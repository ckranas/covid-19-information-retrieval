In order to determine the persistence or not of this centre effect after 1995, we have analysed the outcomes of HSCT in the same population (adults with AML in CR1 given an HLA identical HSCT), performed from 1996 to 2005 in the same transplant centres. Thus, two cohort of patients transplanted in the same 13 EBMT centres were analyzed: 1) 515 patients (aged 16-54 years), transplanted between 1987 and 1995 and 2) 455 patients transplanted (aged 16-55 years) between 1996 and 2005. Transplant related mortality (TRM), relapse incidence(RI) and leukaemia free survival (LFS) were analysed in regression models taking into account centre effect adjusted for relevant covariates, such as age, WBC, FAB classification, time from CR1 to transplant, source of stem cells, T-cell depletion, female donor to male recipient. Results: outcomes estimated at 5 year are listed in the table below in cohort one and two. Range [minimum and maximum] of each outcome are reported according to the transplant centres.",

Gregoire Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, B) Seventy-eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received a single dose of 8-Gy total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide for conditioning. By reducing the dose of TBI, the intention was to minimize toxicity while keeping antileukemic activity. Patients and methods: TBI was delivered over 6 h, with a mean dose rate of 2.2 cGy/min. The patients received bone marrow (n=51) or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (n=27) from siblings (n=67) or from an alternative donor (n=11). Forty-nine patients had a transplant in first remission (CR), 15 in second or later remission, and 14 had untreated relapse or refractory disease. Ten patients had a good prognosis karyotype, 40 had a normal diploid karyotype, and 25 had poor prognosis cytogenetics. No mitoses could be obtained in 3 patients.",

PGP was over-expressed in 12 patients (24%). Median age was 45 years (range: 16-69) and median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 7 months (range: 1-135). Twenty-eight patients (55%) had a sibling donor, 23 an unrelated one. HSC source was bone marrow in 30 cases, peripheral blood in 21. Twenty-eight transplants were performed in first (n=23) or subsequent (n=5) remission. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 40 cases (78%), non-myeloablative in 11. Results: Transplant related mortality was 22% (11 cases). Acute GvHD (n=3) and infections (n=5) were the principal causes of mortality. Median OS was 41 months; survival was similar in the 12 PGP+ patients (38 months) and in the 39 PGP-cases (43 months) (p=0.50). The OS of the transplanted patients was significantly longer than in 98 CN AML patients (33 PGP+ and 59 PGP-) who did not received HSCT (41 vs 12 months, p<0.001). The advantage of transplantation was evident both in the PGP+ (38 vs 6 months, p=0.005) and in the PGP-(43 vs 12 months, p=0.007) cases. Conclusions: Allogeneic HSCT is an effective therapy in CN AML, especially in cases with high risk, such as overexpression of PGP. Transplant overcomes the impact of PGP on survival and may be therefore pursued in patients who display this high risk feature at diagnosis.",

Therefore, adequate prognostic criteria are required for selecting pts who can benefit from this approach. The aim of this report was to assess prognostic factors affecting OS in a cohort of 42 AML pts who received alloHSCT as salvage treatment following a risk-oriented frontline chemotherapy. Forty-two out of 145 AML pts in first relapse after frontline chemotherapy (NILG-AML01-00) received allograft as salvage therapy. They all expressed adverse prognostic factors such as age >45yr (n=27) and high risk FAB subtypes M0,M6,M7, biphenotypic leukemia or MDS-associated AML (n=9). Many were defined at high risk at diagnosis (n=28), or had a relapse free interval (RFI) <6 months (n=11). At time of transplantation 10 did not received reinduction therapy (BM blasts <15%), 27(64%) were in CR2 and 5(12%) in PR. The donor was matched related for 19(45%), matched unrelated for 15(36%) and haploidentical for 8 pts(19%). Stem cell source was PB in 27, BM in 10 and CB in 5 pts. Thirty-one pts received myeloablative conditioning (MA), and 11(26%) a reduced intensity one (RIC). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation of several diagnosis/relapse/transplant-related risk factors with OS. After a median follow up of 10 mos. (range 3-49) the projected 3-yr OS was 17% and 14 pts(33%) were in CCR2. Seventeen pts relapsed at a median time of 6 mos. from transplant, 14/31(45%) conditioned with a MA and 3/11(27%) with a RIC. Among the 15 pts transplanted with active disease, 12(80%) achieved CR2 after alloHSCT and 4(26%) are in CCR2. Nineteen pts developed acute or chronic GVHD. The pts who received a MA regimen died of treatment related toxicity (12%). Univariate analysis showed high risk AML, RFI <6 mo, ECOG-performance status (PS) >0 and unfavorable karyotype at diagnosis to be predictive for a poor outcome (p<0.05). By Cox multivariate analysis only short RFI and PS maintained an independent prognostic value (p=0.033 and 0.034, respectively). Our report suggests that salvage allograft should be offered preferentially to pts with a RFI >6 mos. and very good PS. RIC seems to be as effective and less toxic than MA conditioning regimen. Prospective studies including a large number of allotransplanted cases are required for confirming the role of RIC in AML salvage strategies.",

Valcarcel (1) , R. Martino (1) Background: The use of reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) reduces non-relapse mortality (NRM) allowing long term disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) through graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect in patients considered not eligible for convenitonal Allogeneic HSCT (Allo-SCT). In this multicenter, prospective study we report our experience with RIC regimen based on fludarabine and busulfan prior to allo-SCT as treatment of AML/MDS. Patients and methods: We included all 93 consecutive patients with AML and MDS who underwent RIC-Allo-SCT from an HLA identical sibling, in 6 Spanish centers since 1998 to 2005. There were 59 AML and 34 MDS. Median age was 58 (range 21-70)years. Follow up for survivors was 43 (3-89) months. Conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 150 mg/m\u00b2 and busulfan 8-10 mg/kg. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A and a short course of methotrexate or mycofenolate mofetil. Results: The patients received a RIC regimen for advanced age \u00b1 comorbidities (83%) previous SCT \u00b1 advanced age (9%) or active infection, poor PS, or other comorbidities (8%). 30% of patients were in advanced phase at SCT. Cumulative Incicidence (Cu In) of acute and chronic GVHD was 33% (95% CI 25-44) and 54% (95% CI 44-65%) respectively. The 100-day and 1-year Cu In NRM was 8% and 17% respectively; grade II-IV acute GVHD was de most important variable associated with NRM HR (3.7 (95% CI 1.4-13) P=0.005) in multivariate analyses (MA). Relapse Cu In was 37% (95% CI 28-50%); the absence of chronic GVHD (HR:6.5 (95%CI:3.1-13.8) P<0.001) and an advanced disease status (HR 2.2 (1.1-4.4) P=0.03) were related with a higher risk of relapse in MA. The 4-years DFS was 43% (33-53%); the absence of chronic GVHD (HR: 5.3 (2.4-13.8) P<0.001) and an advanced disease status (HR 2.6 (1.2-5.4) P=0.01) showed worse DFS in MA. The 4-year probability of OS was 45% (95% CI 33-57%) for the whole group. OS for AML and MDS was 42% (95% CI 28-56%) and 49% (95% CI 31-76%) (P=0.4). The absence of chronic GVHD was the only factor associated with worse OS HR 6.1 (95% CI: 3.3-11.3) P<0.001 in MA. Conclusion:Our results supports the use of our RIC as a curative option for those patients with high risk NRM for conventional allo-SCT but who can benefit from GVL effect. The development of chronic GVHD was associated with better outcome (lower relapse rate and better DFS and OS) Patients (pts.) with refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after multiple chemotherapy cycles have a particular poor prognosis. In this prospective study, 20 pts. (median age 55 years, range 19-67 years) with detection of blasts > 20 % in bone marrow aspirates before scheduled transplantation have been enrolled for a sequential high-dose Melphalan therapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning. So far, 17 pts. have undergone the sequential therapy, while 3 pts. are still under treatment. Fourteen pts. received 140 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan and 6 pts. 200 mg/m\u00b2. The median interval between melphalan and start of the conditioning regimen was 11 days (range 6-24 days). Blast clearance was checked by bone marrow aspiration prior to start of conditioning regimen. Eleven patients underwent a conditioning regimen with total body irradiation (TBI) and fludarabin and 6 pts. with treosulfan and fludarabin. Six pts. were transplanted with an identical sibling donor, 2 with a haploidentical familiar donor, and 9 pts. with matched unrelated donors. The acute toxicity was as follows: nephrotoxicity grade 0 n=8, grade I-II n=8, grade III-IV n=1, hepatotoxicity grade 0 n=5, grade I-II n= 10, grade III-IV n= 2, mucocitis grade 0 n=6, grade I-II n=4, grade III-IV n=7 After a median follow up of 130 days for surviving pts. after transplant, the overall survival estimate at 2 years after transplant was 65 % (11/17 patients). The treatment related mortality was 23 %, four pts. died due to infectious complications (n=3) and acute graft versus host disease grade IV (n=1). Three pts. (18 %) developed a relapse up to 150 days after transplant. Two of these three pts. (66 %) died due to the relapse, while 1 patient survives in remission.",

Lee (1) Purpose: Recently, we demonstrated the positive impact of imatinib interim therapy on the curative potential of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) (Blood 2003; 102:3068 & Blood 2005; 105:3449) . However, a proportion of patients continue to eventually die as a result of disease recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors affecting transplantation outcome, mainly focusing on the prognostic relevance of minimal residual disease (MRD) level. Patients and Methods: Between 2000 and 2005, 51 adults with Ph+ ALL who completed induction chemotherapy and intended to undergo imatinib interim therapy followed by allogeneic SCT were enrolled in this study. For MRD assessment, patients' bone marrow samples were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity, 10 -5 ). Results: At the time of enrollment (after induction chemotherapy), 41 patients (80.4%) achieved complete remission (CR) . After the first imatinib cycle, 39 of the 41 patients in CR remained in sustained first CR, while the other 2 patients relapsed. In the remaining 10 refractory patients, 7 achieved a new CR after the first imatinib cycle. The kinetics of MRD correlated well with the patients' clinical course. Overall, the BCR-ABL/ABL ratios were decreased in 45 patients (88.2%), which included 18 (35.3%) molecular CR after the imatinib interim therapy. A total of 50 patients underwent allogeneic SCT from matched sibling (n=33) or unrelated (n=17) donors, and among them, 46 (86.2%) received transplants in first CR. With a median follow-up duration of 40 months (range, 6+ to 67+ months) after SCT, the actuarial 3-year relapse, nonrelapse mortality, diseasefree survival, and overall survival rates were 17.1%\u00b16.1%, 15.9%\u00b16.2%, 69.1%\u00b17.4%, and 72.5%\u00b17.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that an MRD level of greater than 10\u00b3 after the first imatinib cycle was the most powerful predictor of relapse (39.9%\u00b114.8% versus 4.8%\u00b14.6%, p=0.024, RR=12.0) and disease-free survival (39.1%\u00b113.1% versus 86.7%\u00b17.3%, p=0.007, RR=8.9). Conclusion: In the setting of allogeneic SCT after front-line imatinib interim therapy, prospective MRD monitoring may allow us to identify subgroups of Ph+ ALL patients at high risk of relapse at an earlier stage of treatment. Purpose: Data from recent studies using risk-based approaches suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) clearly benefits certain patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), such as those with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL. In contrast, the role of allogeneic SCT for Ph-negative ALL remains unclear because interpretation of transplantation outcome is complicated by the criteria used to select patients and by the relatively small number of patients studied. The aim of the present study was to evaluate risk factors affecting clinical outcome and the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect for 149 adults with Phnegative ALL who were treated with allogeneic SCT during the last 10 years (1995 to 2004) . Patients and methods: The study population was 149 consecutive adults receiving an allogeneic SCT from matched sibling (n=109) or unrelated (n=40; 27 matched, 13 allelemismatched) donors. Their median age was 27 years (range, 15-61 years). One hundred fourteen (76.5%) patients had high-risk criteria. One hundred seventeen (78.5%) were transplanted in first complete remission (CR1); 12 (8.1%) in CR2; and 20 (13.4%) were resistant to chemotherapy before transplantation. Most patients (n=140, 94.0%) received a preparative treatment of total body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen (TBI/cyclophosphamide for CR1, TBI/cytarabine/melphalan for >CR1). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was attempted by administering calcineurin inhibitor plus methotrexate. Results: With a median follow-up of 53 months (range, 18+ to 130+ months), the 5-year probability of disease-free survival (DFS) was 51.3%\u00b14.2% for all patients; 62.9%\u00b14.6% for patients in CR1; and 9.4%\u00b15.2% for patients in >CR1 at transplantation. There was no difference in DFS for sibling and unrelated transplant patients in CR1 (64.4%\u00b15.3% versus 58.8%\u00b19.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that the most powerful predictive factor affecting relapse and DFS was disease status at the time of transplantation (CR1 versus >CR1, p<0.001). The presence of chronic GVHD was also found to be significantly associated with favorable outcome (p=0.001). Conclusion: Our data suggest that allogeneic SCT should be performed in CR1 in adults with Ph-negative ALL. The presence of chronic GVHD results in better DFS, indicating a clinically important GVL effect. Further studies to develop treatment strategies to reduce leukemic cell burden and to enhance GVL effect are needed.",

Bartolozzi, C. Orsi, A. Messori, E. Tendi, S. Guidi, A. Bosi Careggi Hospital (Florence, I) Allogeneic transplantation in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1) has been studied in a limited number of clinical trials. However, no systematic analysis has yet been done to assess whether this treatment option improves overall or event-free survival and to determine the magnitude of the survival benefit if any. We conducted a survival meta-analysis to compare allogeneic transplantation vs. standard chemotherapy (or autologous transplantation) in patients with ALL in CR1 on the basis of an intention to treat approach. Our study included the controlled clinical trials published in English from 2000 to 2005. The literature search was mainly based on MEDLINE. The event-free individual survival data were reconstructed on the basis of published information and Kaplan-Meier graphs. We generated the meta-analytic event-free survival curves for patients given allogeneic transplant and for controls (standard chemotherapy or autologous transplantation) and determined statistical significance using log-rank test and Cox analysis. After including 4 studies in our meta-analysis, total of 293 patients for the allogeneic transplantation group and 479 for the control group were examined. Our results showed that the event-free survival difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant (chi-square by log-rank test = 6.54, p = 0.011). The Cox analysis calculated a relative risk for event occurrence of 0.79 for the experimental group vs. the controls (95%CI: 0.66 to 0.96; p=0.017). Secondary analyses gave essentially the same result even in the case where we included two more small-scale negative studies in which the experimental arm included allogeneic transplants from related or unrelated donors. The mean survival gain was 1 year per patient; the cost per life-year gained was less than the conventional threshold of 50,000 Euros. On the basis of our meta-analysis, allogeneic transplantation in patients with ALL in CR1 confers a statistically significant event-free survival benefit as compared with standard chemotherapy or autologous transplantation. Its costeffectiveness profile is acceptable.",

B. Dengler, M. Stelljes, C. Theuser, C. Schmid, U. Hegenbart, J. Kienast, A.D. Ho, G. Ehninger, P. Dreger, M. Bornh\u00e4user on behalf of the German Cooperative Transplant Study Group (GCTSG) Prognosis of patients (pts.) with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or advanced myelodysplasia (MDS) is poor. Preliminary reports suggest that induction of aplasia by a standard AML regimen followed by reduced intensity conditioned stem cell transplantation (RIC-SCT) in aplasia may be an effective strategy in this situation. A survey was conducted by the German Cooperative Transplant Study Group (GCTSG) to investigate the outcome after such an approach. Data on 44 pts. (24m, 20f, median age 49y, range 19-66) with high-risk MDS (9), relapsed (16) or primary refractory AML (19) were reported by 3 centers. Pts. received aplasiainducing chemotherapy with the following regimens: idarubicine / fludarabine / ara-C (16), daunorubicine / ara-C (15), fludarabine / ara-C / amsacrine (5), or other ara-C-based schedules (8). Subsequent transplant conditioning therapy consisted of melphalan (150mg/m\u00b2) plus fludarabine (150mg/m\u00b2) in n=28, TBI (8Gy) plus fludarabine (150mg/m\u00b2) in n=11, and TBI (4Gy) plus cyclophosphamide (80-120mg/kg) in n=5 and was commenced after a median of 15 days (8-40) from the start of chemotherapy. Allogeneic peripheral blood (41) or bone marrow (3) stem cells from sibling (16), matched unrelated donors (18) or mismatched donors (10) were infused thereafter. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was performed with cyclosporin A monotherapy (33) or by combination of a calcineurine inhibitor and methotrexate (11), n=31 received additional anti-thymocyte globuline. 43 pts. achieved stable engraftment and 41 showed >90% donor chimerism after 28-90 days. Grade 2-3 acute GVHD occurred in 34%, whereas limited or extensive chronic GVHD was seen in 26% of evaluable pts. 100-day mortality rate was 24%: 5 pts. succumbed to treatment related complications, 4 to disease relapse. The median follow up is 200 days . Actuarial survival rates (Kaplan-Meier analysis) are 56.6% and 29.5% at 6 and 12 months, whilst actuarial progression free survival rates are 42% and 30.8% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. This multi-center retrospective analysis suggests feasibility of the approach combining leukemia burden reduction by standard AML induction chemotherapy followed by RIC-SCT performed in aplasia. Treatment-related complications were comparable to those of a conventional transplant setting. Prospective studies are needed to assess whether durable remissions are achievable in patients with these otherwise fatal conditions.",

Uharek Charit\u00e9 (Berlin, D) In this study we analyzed 43 patients (24 male, 19 female) with AML who underwent related (17) and unrelated (26) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Fifteen patients received standard myeloablative and 28 Treosulfan-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). The mean age was 53 in in patients with standard conditioning. Genetic analysis was performed in all patients at diagnosis and all through different stages of the disease. To detect genetic aberrations we used G-banding, FISH, and PCR. For quantitative chimerism investigation we used AmpFISTR\u00ae Identifier\u00ae PCR Amplification KIT (Applied Biosystems) contains fluorescent-labeled primer pairs for simultaneous amplification of 16 different loci each. We evaluated chimerism in bone marrow aspirate (BM) and in CD34+ cells on days +28, +56, +100, +180, +360, and at end of investigation. FISH with specific probes for sex chromosomes were exercised after sex-mismatch SCT. The data was compared with minimal residual disease (MRD). Both standard and RIC regimens were well tolerated. All patients engrafted. Early chimerism analysis (day +28) showed that all patients with standard conditioning and 69% of patients with RIC had complete chimerism (CC) in BM. Interestingly, all patients after RIC SCT with CC at day +56 in BM did not develop relapse. By contrast, 70% of patients which had a relapse showed mixed chimerism (MC) on day +56 after RIC SCT. We suggest that the chimerism data at day +56 is important factor for relapse in patients after RIC SCT. We observed a trend to a higher level of chimerism on days +28; +56, and +100 in patients after standard conditioning versus RIC. It is necessary to note that the relapse rate was significant above in RIC patients (39%) than in patients with standard conditioning (19%) (log rank, p<0,05). Quantitative chimerism analysis in CD34+ cells was more sensitive to detect relapse in the early terms. MRD assessment from days +28 till day +100 after SCT allowed identification of patients at risk of relapse. After a median follow-up of 556 days, 28 (65%) out of the 43 patients remain alive, 26 (60%) patients keep complete remission and CC. In conclusion, simultaneous studies of both chimerism and MRD are a useful tool in order to predict risk of relapse in patients undergoing SCT and so can be helpful for individualizing treatment strategies after transplant.",

Vey (1) (1)Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F); (2)CHU de Bordeaux (Bordeaux, F); (3)Centre Jean Perrin (Clermont-Ferrand, F) We have previously shown that RIC-based ASCT can be safely used in AML pts after intensive consolidation chemotherapy. In the current update report, we asked whether leukemic control was maintained after a longer follow-up. 37 pts (age:51 (range,26-60)) with high risk clinical characteristics (n=26;70%) (Age>50 (N=22,59%); associated severe comorbidity (N=10;30%)) and/or poor risk leukemic features (n=24;65%; poor Cytogenetics (N=13,35%); failure of first induction (n=10,27%); secondary leukemia (n=4;11%), high WBC count (n=5;14%) or partial remission (n=1,3%)) were included. After CR1, all patients received a low dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy followed one month later by one course of high dose cytarabine (24 g/m\u00b2) and anthracycline (HIDAC). Pts were then scheduled to receive RIC ASCT (fluda.,180 mg/m\u00b2; Bu, 8 mg/kg; Thymoglobulin, 2.5 to 10 mg/kg) followed with BMT (n=10;28%) or PBSCT (n=26;72%). However after treating the first pts, it appears that this schedule was not associated with prohibitive toxicity. Thus, all following pts were proposed to receive one month after HIDAC, one course of melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2) (HDMEL) with auto-SCT that preceded the RIC ASCT. Overall, 21 pts received HIDAC only and 16 HIDAC and HDMEL. Median FU is 3 y. (16-70 m.) . 15 pts experienced aGVHD (Grade 1:7;Grade 2:4;Grade 3-4:4). The CI of grade 2-4 aGVHD was 22% (9-35). 33 pts (90%) were evaluable for cGVHD: 10 and 14 pts presented a limited and extensive form respectively. The CI of cGVHD was 65 % (50-80). Three deaths were attributed to non-relapse causes (aGVHD:1;cGVHD:2;CI of non-relapse death (NRD):8% (95%CI: 0-17). In all, 8 pts relapsed at 5 m. (2-19) (CI:22%; (95%CI, . Relapse was associated with the abence of cGVHD (cGVHD:4% (4-12), no cGVHD 44% (12-76), P=0.02), and at a lesser extent with the intensity of prior consolidation chemotherapy (HIDAC:33% (13-53); HIDAC+AUTO;6% (0-19%), P=0.06). 26 pts are still alive in CR1 for an overall survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS) probability estimates at 4 years of 67 % (95%CI, 49-81%) and 68% (95%CI, 50-81%) respectively.",

Kim, S.Y. Kim, K.S. Eom, J.W. Lee, C.C. Kim Catholic University of Korea (Seoul, KOR) Objectives: t(9;22)(q34;q11) in de novo AML is very rarely found in only 1-2% of newly diagnosed patients. Ph+ AML represents a clinically distinct entity with poor outcome and has been considered at high risk of treatment failure or early relapse with standard chemotherapy. Methods: Imatinib (Glivec, STI571) has been successfully used in CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We applied the concept of the imatinib interim therapy for newly diagnosed Ph+ AML and monitored the status of minimal residual disease (MRD) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). We performed 8 cases of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) so far. In all cases, the disease status before a first imatinib cycle was complete remission (CR). Subsequently, all cases received 1~2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy followed by a second imatinib cycle bridging the time to HSCT. The preparative regimen consisted of total body irradiation (1320 cGy) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). Cyclosporin or tacrolimus plus methotrexate were used to prevent graftversus host disease. For MRD monitoring, all cases were analyzed by RQ-PCR and the samples were collected at diagnosis, before and after imatinib therapy, and then at 21days and every 3-month after HSCT. Results: After the first imatinib cycle, all patients remained at least in sustained CR and the BCR-ABL transcript decreased compared to the level of post-induction period with a variable degree. All patients received the second imatinib cycle following consolidation chemotherapy or during pre-transplant period. After the second imatinib cycle, the BCR-ABL transcript rapidly decreased to an undetectable status in most cases. Finally, all patients underwent HSCT in a favourable status and are alive in a leukemia free status in the range of 3~42 months after HSCT. Thus, it should be considered to undergo allogeneic HSCT, considering the poor prognosis of Ph+ AML and the possibility of resistance to imatinib as in CML and Ph+ ALL. Conclusion: The present study is the first report that successfully incorporates imatinib into standard chemotherapy as an alternative for bridging to HSCT in Ph+ AML. As a firstline imatinib interim therapy, it appears to be a useful strategy to bridge the time to HSCT for patients with Ph+ AML. Further follow-up with a sizable population is needed to define the impact of imatinib on the long-term outcome of transplantation for AML.",

HDAC, auto PBPCT and allogeneic BMT after post remission therapy were given as last consolidation therapy in Intermediate Risk Group (IPG) based on cytogenetics using MRC definition. We studied complete remission, relapse, toxic death, DFS and OS. Inclusion criteria were age<65, PS<3 with reasonable organ functions, cardiac ejection fraction>50%, bilirubin<2.0mg/dl, creatinine<2mg/dl in de novo AML, secondary AML and RAEB-T. The aims of this prospective intention to treat analysis was to compare the CR, recovery kinetics, DFS and OS in IPG based on cytogenetics with different consolidation treatment modalities. Three plus seven(Idarubicin 12mg/m\u00b2, D1-D3; Ara-C 100mg/m\u00b2, D1-D7) were given to de novo AML, secondary AML and RAEB-T. Three times of post remission therapy including HDAC, or auto PBPCT followed by two times of post remission therapy was given to IPG. If HLA-identical sibling was available, then allo BMT was tried after 1st postremission therapy. 194 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 32.5months. Among them, 92.3% was de novo AML. Over all remission rate after 1st induction(3+7) was 69.9%. Relapse rate after induction was 40.5%. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity were found in 26.1% during induction therapy. Median days for ANC >500/\u00b5l and platelet>20k/\u00b5l during induction were 22 days and 21 days respectively. Toxicities profiles including mucositis hepatic, cardiac and bleeding episodes are similar on 3 different therapy modalities(HDAC, auto PBPCT and allo BMT). So far, this trial seems to be tolerable in terms of toxicities, during induction and post remission therapies. Among IPG, auto PBPCT arm had tendency of superior median survival in terms of OS and LFS without statistical differences (HDAC:8m, allograft:8m) . This intention to treat trial, which started in Jan, 2000, has been going on until now in order to have better statistical power for the subset analysis.",

(Brescia, I) Background: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and normal karyotype represent about 40-50% of all AML cases. Despite being included in an \"intermediate\" risk group, they display an heterogeneous clinical course. Thus, post-induction therapy, including the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) is still under debate in these patients. Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins over-expression is associated with worse prognosis in acute leukemias, and we have found that P-glycoprotein (PGP) positivity is related with a reduced overall survival (OS) also in cytogenetically normal (CN) AML patients. Objectives: We analyzed the outcome of allogeneic HSCT in 51 patients with CN AML, correlating the outcome of transplant with PGP expression at diagnosis. We also compared the survival in the transplanted patients with 98 cases of CN AML who did not received allogeneic HSCT. Methods: Fifty-one CN AML patients who were considered at high risk and had an HLA identical donor underwent to allogeneic HSCT at our Centre. High risk was defined according to initial clinical presentation (WBC >30x10 elderly patients from an allogeneic stem cell transplantation after a reduced conditioning regimen compared with a conventional chemotherapy? Patients and methods: 87 pts. with age > 55 years (41 pts. with normal/good risk karyotyp) were treated with a conventional chemotherapy. 44 pts. underwent SCT after a reduced intensity conditioning (14 pts. with identical sibling donor, 30 pts. with unrelated donor). 19 pts. of this group with normal/good karyotyp. Results: 5 years overall survival in the SCT-group was 47%, in the chemotherapy group 17% (p=0.01). 5 years OS in patients with normal and good risk karyotyp was 58% in the SCT group versus 20% in chemotherapy patients (p =0.07). In transplanted patients with 1.complete remission was the 5 years OS 61%, in the chemotherapy group 26%. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that patients with acute myeloid leukemia, who receive an allogeneic stem cell transplantation have a better outcome, compared to standard chemotherapy. SCT after reduced-intensity chemotherapy produce a long-term survival. Rate of relapse and refractory is higher in the group of standard treatment. Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia profit from allogeneic haematopoetic cell transplantation after reduced-intensity conditioning.",

Allogeneic SCT was also proposed to refractory patients with a donor (24 patients). 111 patients had an identical sibling donor identified during first line therapy and 9 at the time of relapse. Geno-identical allogeneic SCT was performed in 55 patients, and 3 patients received DLI. 44 transplantations were performed from an unrelated donor (of which 4 from cord blood). A higher survival rate was observed when SCT was performed in second CR as compared to SCT performed at the time of relapse (p = 0.02) or after failure of chemotherapy (p = 0.005). 3-year survival tended to be better with a phenothan with a geno-identical donor (31% vs 21%). Relapse incidence was 41% vs 64% at 3 years, while toxicity-related mortality was 46% vs 37% at 1 year.

Our aim was to demonstrate whether a MRT-PCR system might be successfully used to screen a large number of patients with acute leukemia and compare the result with that of chromosome studies. Design and method: Frozen bone marrow cells from patients, who were diagnosed with acute leukemia at Ajou university hospital between September 1994 and May 2006, were used for MRT-PCR. In all samples with a known conventional cytogenetic results, we performed MRT-PCR and compared with conventional cytogenetic study regarding the concordance rate and analyzed discordant cases regarding their types. Results: 132 samples (68 male and 64 female patients) were analyzed, and there were 99 AML, 25 ALL, 5 biphenotypic leukemia, 2 Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and 1 patient of Hairy cell leukemia. We successfully obtained the mRNA from all frozen samples. In 30 cases, we identified gene abnormalities with chromosome studies and most of them (24/30), the same abnormalities were detected with MRT-PCR method. In 102 patients with normal karyotype by cytogenetic technique, we identified 30 translocations of clinical significance by MRT-PCR method. In these 30 discordant cases, there were 8 cases with t(8;21), 5 cases with t(15;17), 4 cases with t(9;22), 4 cases with t(9;11), 2 cases with t(11;19) and 7 others [t(9;9), inv(16), t(10;11), t(1;19), t(4;11), t(11,21), TAL 1d (40kb deletion)] In 99 AML patients, We found MRT-PCR was comparable to chromosome study for prognosis (MRT-PCR; p=0.013, chromosome study; p=0.042) Conclusion: There were 72.7% concordance between cytogenetic technique and MRT-PCR. Furthermore clinically significant translocations were detected by MRT-PCR in 30 of 102 normal karyotype patients, indicating improved sensitivity with MRT-PCR. Further investigations are needed to ascertain the usefulness of MRT-PCR as the screening tool of leukemic genetic abnormalities.",

Pollio, P. Correale, F.P. Tambaro, P. Morabito, C. Lopardo, A. Viola, G. Mele Cardarelli Hospital (Naples, I) Background: While several studies have investigated factors influencing rates and quantity of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization in patients with non myeloid malignancies, there are very few reports on low number of patients concerning the efficiency of PBSC mobilization in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed the effects of different potentially influential variables on mobilization of CD34 positive (CD34+) from a series of 160 consecutive patients with AML in first complete remission (CR1). Patients and methods: Data were collected from a cohort of 160 consecutive patients with AML in CR1. The median age was 52 years (14-78). There were 134 patients with de novo AML (84%) and 26 patients (26%) with secondary AML (s-AML). According to MRC criteria, cytogenetic findings at diagnosis were classified as favourable in 11%, intermediate in 69%, and adverse in 20% of patients. Patients up to 60 years (n=116, 72%) received anthracycline based induction and consolidation, while those aged more than 60 (n=44, 28%) were treated in induction/consolidation with fludarabine/ARA-C given as continuous sequential infusion. The following variables were analyzed: age > or < 60 years, de novo vs. s-AML, anthracycline vs. fludarabine based treatment, cytogenetics at diagnosis, presence of FLT3 /kg, range 2,6-152,6) obtained with a median of 2 apheresis (range [1] [2] [3] [4] . Either univariate or multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate significant influence for any parameter which were considered into the study. In particular no effect was observed as median number of CD34+ cell collection, median number of apheresis, peak of SC in PB and median number of CD34+ cells collected per single apheresis were concerned. In addition, none of the above parameters was significantly related to hematopoietic reconstitution after autologous stem cell transplantation in terms of WBC and platelet recovery. Conclusion: We conclude that successful mobilization in AML is unpredictable by using the variables analyzed in our study. In particular, elderly age per se does not represent an unfavourable factor for mobilization.",

Whenever a second complete remission (CR) is attained, the median duration of the second relapse-free interval (RFI) is generally considerably shorter than that of the first RFI at least in pts not eligible for transplant procedures. The aims of our study were to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy, of a salvage chemotherapy showed in Tab 1. Pts achieving CR were scheduled to receive a consolidation course with the same drug and schedule, followed by an allogenic transplantation. At our center 13 pts were treated according to this protocol; 11 of the 13 pts were in first relapse, while 2 were refractory to first line chemotherapy. The main characteristics of the pts are shown in the table 2. The overall response rate was 85% (7 CR, 2 CRp and 2 PR). Two pts, refractory to first line chemotherapy, showed no response and died. Extrahematological toxicity was mild: only 1 pt suffered from grade 3 oral mucositis. No pt presented alopecia. Recovery was evaluable in 9/13 pts. The median time required to attain an absolute neutrophil count in excess of 0.5 x 109/L was 14 days (range 8-62). A sustained platelet count exceeding 50 x 109/L was reached after a median of 31 days (range 19-62). Eight pts had fever (3 documented infections, 3 FUO and 2 pneumonias). Empirical antifungal therapy was administered to 2 pts because of persistence of fever. Of the 9 patients in second CR, 1 relapsed after consolidation and died, 1 underwent a sibling transplant and is alive in second CR 3 months after SCT, 1 pt received an haploidentical transplant and is alive in second CR, 1 pt, relapsed after a sibling transplant in first CR, is alive in third CR after an extramedullary relapse, 1 pt is currently undergoing an allogenic transplant, 1 died after an unrelated donor transplant of transplant-related mortality, 2 pt died while waiting for an allogenic transplant, 1 due to CNS relapse and the other of hematological relapse and 1 pt developed an important aplasia after consolidation treatment. Two pts who achieved a PR relapsed rapidly, after consolidation therapy, and died. Despite the relatively small cohort of pts, the regimen utilized seems promising and feasible allowing to proceed to a SCT transplant in the majority of AML pts with relapsed or resistant disease. A longer follow-up and a prospective multicenter study is necessary to conclusively validate our data.",

Methods: AML patients in first relapse received salvage therapy with 200 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan and autologous PBSC, which had been cryopreserved in early CR1. Subsequently an allogeneic donor was searched and a consolidating allogeneic transplant scheduled within 2 -3 months. Results: Eighteen consecutive patients with AML in first relapse who had cryopreserved autologous PBSC are evaluable. The median age was 48 (range 29-61) years. Sixteen of 18 pts. (89%) achieved a second CR and 16/18 pts. (89%) achieved a consolidating allogeneic transplant in CR2 (n=14) or PR2 (n=2) from a related (n=3) or unrelated (n=13) donor within a median of 2,4 (1,9 -4,5 ) months after HD-Mel. Treatment-related mortality was 0/18 after HD-Mel and 4/16 (25%) after the subsequent allograft; 4 patients died due to relapse and 10 patients are alive in CR with a follow-up of median 20 (range 6 -66) months and a projected long-term survival of 50%. Conclusions: Salvage therapy using HD-Mel in relapsed AML is superior to any other reported salvage regimen, however more patients need to be studied to confirm these results.",

            "text": "Methods: The material of the study -bone marrow from 79 children with initial diagnosed ALL, 37 children with initial diagnosed AML and 7 controls (leukocytes peripheral blood from healthy donors). We studied the quantities of several proteins cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk2 and cdk4) and cyclins (cyclin D, cyclin E), E2F1, pRb, caspase 3 and 8, Bclx, Bax, p53 by Western blotting. The rate of proliferating cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, using nuclear cell proliferation-associated antigen (Ki67). The level of spontaneous apoptosis was estimated by flowcytometry as the number of cells after propidium iodide and annexin V staining. Results: The levels of expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4 and level spontaneous apoptosis was much higher of initial B-ALL in children in comparison with T-ALL, pro-B-ALL and controls(P<0.05). The positive rates of proliferation activity cell (Ki67) was much higher of initial T-ALL in children in comparison with B-ALL. The levels of expression of cdk2, cdk4 and level spontaneous apoptosis in complete remission ALL was higher than in relapse samples (p<0.05). The Ki67 and the levels of expression of Bax in cell in relapse was higher than in complete remission ALL samples (p<0.05). The probability of 5-year DFS in patients with high levels of cyclin D, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4 and level spontaneous apoptosis was 99% versus 77%, 76%, 82%, 81% and 79% in patients with low levels of these proteins (p<0.05). The probability of 5-year DFS in patients with low levels of Ki67 was 93% versus 61% in patients with high levels of these proteins (p<0.05). Conclusions: Expression rates of cyclin D, cyclin E, cdk2, cdk4, Ki67 and the level spontaneous apoptosis have clinical and prognostic significance in childhood leukemia. The initial high levels of cyclin D, E, cdk2, cdk4 and the level spontaneous apoptosis in leukemic cells are associated with good prognosis of 5 years disease-free survival. The initial low levels of Ki67 in leukemic cells are associated with good prognosis of 5 years disease-free survival. (2)Charles University Hospital (Hradec Kralove, CZ) Aim: Assessment of acute and chronic cardiotoxicity in patients treated for acute leukemia with biochemical markers -N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB mass); echocardiography (ECHO) and electrocardiography (ECG). Patients and methods: Twenty six adult acute leukemia patients (mean age 46.2\u00b112.4 years, 15 males) treated with 2-6 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT), followed by myeloablative preparative regimen (PR) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were studied. Cardiac evaluation was performed at the baseline (before CT), after first CT (cumulative ANT dose 136.3\u00b128.3 mg/m\u00b2), after last CT (cumulative ANT dose 464.4.3\u00b1117.5 mg/m\u00b2) and circa 6 months after completion of CT (6 Mo after CT). Results: The results are summarized in the Table. Six months after CT, NT-proBNP concentrations correlated with systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction on ECHO -(r=0,514; p<0.01) and (r=0,587; p<0.01). Decreased QRS voltage on ECG correlated with systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction on ECHO -(r=0.660; p<0.001) and (r=0,592; p<0.01). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate acute and chronic cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines in combination with PR and HCT. Clinical manifestation of cardiotoxicity in terms of heart failure developed in 2 (7.7 %) patients. In asymptomatic patients, abnormal cardiac findings (NT-proBNP elevations, diastolic LV dysfunction, QTc prolongation) represent subclinical cardiotoxicity, which indicates a risk for development of heart failure and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. In regard of late anthracycline cardiotoxicity, Intensive consolidation stragegies proofed to be safe and effective in patients below 60 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Several studies tried to transfer these positive experiences onto elderly patients. Due to extensive toxicity and therapy-related mortality those strategies failed to show any benefit for elderly patients (R.J. Mayer et al, NEJM, 1994,331(14) :896; R.M. Stone et al, Blood,2001,98(3) :548). Autologous and allogenic transplantation after high dose Busulfan (BU) have been shown to be very safe in patients (pts.) with chronic myeloid leukemia (E. Olavaria et al, BJH,2000,108:769) . BU is an effective drug also in acute myeloid leukemia. Therefore we performed a pilot study in 18 elderly pts. with AML. Median age was 63 years (range 58-67). High dose regimen consisted in oral BU 4x1mg/kg x 4 days followed by autologous stem cell (SC)transplantation three days later. SCs were harvested after two or three cycles of induction/consolidation chemotherapy with G-CSF support. A median of 4.8 (1.1-12. 3) CD34/kg progenitor cells were collected. Median duration to reach leucocytes >1000/\u00b5l and platelets >20.000/\u00b5l was 12 and 15 days, respectively. We reported in 2003 that this approach is safe without any toxic death (Bone Marrow Transpl , 31, Suppl.1, #640) . Now we report the follow-up of these 18 patients (pts.)with a median of 53,5 months for the surviving pts.. Seven out of 18 pts. (39%) and 6 out of 11 pts. with standard risk AML (54%), respectively, are still disease-free. In contrast, 6 out of 7 pts. with high-risk cytogenetics or secondary AML relapsed within a median of 12 months (3-49). All pts. in complete remission have an excellent performance status. Conclusion: High dose BU with autologous SC support as consolidation therapy is promising in elderly standard risk AML pts. and should be compared prospectively with dose reduced allogeneic transplantation. Relapse free survival and quality of life should be the objectives.",

In the past, high-dose regimens utilized in ASCT were derived from allogeneic setting. Since these regimens (TBI-Cy, BU-Cy, BU-VP-Cy) provide both cytoreduction and immunosuppression to facilitate the allogeneic engraftment, we evaluated the efficacy of a regimen that theorically gives the maximum therapy to eradicate the disease. Between April 1997 and May 2006, 29 AML patients in Complete Remission (CR) (16 females and 13 males; median age 52 years, range 17-70 with 9 patients > 60 years; 9 patients had FAB M1, 9 FAB M2, 8 FAB M4 and 3 had a secondary AML) underwent ASCT. Conditioning regimen consisted of 4d Busulphan (4 mg/ Kg from day -5 to -2) followed by Melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2) for 1d (day -1); BU-MEL doses were reduced (3 mg/Kg for 4d and 120 mg/m\u00b2, respectively) in patients > 60 years. Unpurged peripheral blood stem cells in 24 (83%) patients were used, while 5 (17%) patients reinfused bone marrow receiving respectively a median of 3.9 x 106/Kg CD34+ cells (range 0.96-11.5) and 1.45 x 108/Kg nucleated cells (range 0.29-2.6). All patients achieved full hematological recovery. Median number of days to neutrophil count of 0.5 x 109/l and platelet count of 20 x 109/l was 14 (range 12-22) and 18.5 (range 13-50) with no significant differences between the two groups <60 years and >60 years. Transplant related mortality was 3.5% with 1 patient died for septicemia. As major extra-hematological treatment-related toxicity 21 (73%) patients developed a mucositis episode which was severe (grade III-IV WHO) in 15 of them. There were 16 documented bacterial infections, while 8 patients had fever of unknown origin. After a median followup for surviving patients of 30 months from ASCT, 22 patients (74%) are alive and 21 (70%) are in continous CR. In particular, analysis of two groups <60 years and >60 years showed OS and DFS values respectively of 85% vs 50% and 79% vs 46%. In conclusion, despite the reduced number of patients and the short follow-up, our results demonstrated the feasibility of BU-MEL regimen as conditioning treatment for AML patients who will undergo ASCT also in elderly and secondarily the efficacy of this schedule as evidenced by the high number of continous CR in patients <60 years. It remains to evaluate the exact role of this approach in patients >60 years, where the acceptable toxicity is not associated with encouraging results.",

Schmitt (1) (1)University Clinic Ulm (Ulm, D); (2)Southeast University Medical School (Nanjing, RC) Background: For patients at relapse or with residual disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT), we have the therapeutical option to administer one of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib (Glivec), nilotinib (Tasigna; AMN107) and dasatinib (Sprycel; BMS-354825) which will inhibit the proliferation of CML progenitor cells, but might also hamper the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect considered to be crucial for the eradication of the disease. Moreover, CD8+ T cells specific for cytomegalovirus (CMVpp65) might be impaired. Objectives: We wondered if TKIs might afflict antileukemic/viral CD8+ T cells, as well as CD4+CD25hi T cells regulating the GVL. Methods: Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib were added at concentrations of 0-20 \u00b5M, 0-4 \u00b5M and 0-50 nM respectively to proliferation assays of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+ T cells. The influence of TKIs on apoptosis was measured by bromodeoxyuridine/ annexin V. Mixed lymphocyte peptide cultures (MLPCs) were performed with peptides derived from a) influenza matrix protein (IMP) as a recall antigen, b) CMVpp65 as a viral antigen and c) the receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility (RHAMM-R3) as a leukaemia-associated antigen. CD8+ T cells from these MLPCs from healthy donors and patients with CML after allo-PSCT by tetramer staining/multi-color flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays, as well as CD4+CD25hi Tcells after 3 days of culture with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Results: Proliferation of CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells was significantly inhibited by TKIs without increase of T cell apoptosis. The release of interferon gamma and granzyme B by CD8+ HLA-A2/tetramer+CD45RA+ CD27-CD28-CCR7effector T cells specific for IMP, CMVpp65 and RHAMM-R3 was inhibited by all TKIs in a dose-dependent fashion and correlating to the time of TKI exposure. The inhibition was reversible after removal of the drugs from the MLPC. The proliferation and function of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+GITR+ TGF\u00df1+CD69+CD152+ regulatory T cells were also significantly inhibited by TKIs in a dose-related fashion. The potency of T cell inhibition was imatinib:nilotinib:dasatinib = 1:2:40 in therapeutical serum respectively culture medium levels (2 \u00b5M:1 \u00b5M: 25 nM). Conclusion: When administering TKIs to patients after allo-PBSCT, the inhibition of both CD8+ and CD4+CD25hi T cells must be taken into consideration with respect to GVL and antiviral T cell response.",

Their effects on GvHD vs GvL, remains to be defined. A cohort of 291 CML HLA matched sibling transplants with known clinical risk factors as defined by the EBMT risk score, were typed for NHPs (IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-g, TNF-a, TNFR 11), steroid hormone receptors (VDR and ER-a) and NOD2/CARD15 mutations. TNFRII-196 allele R; IL-10 ATA/ACC; IL-1 Ra (allele 2) and IL-4-T were significantly associated with survival using univariate analysis. Two clinical Cox proportional hazards models were generated and used as a basis for further development: (i) using the EBMT risk score as a single variable on an ordinal scale or (ii) using the individual clinical factors of the EBMT risk score as categorical variables. After step-wise variable selection using the significant genetic factors, the resulting multivariate models indicated that absence of TNFRII-196 R, i.e. down regulation of TNF in the recipient, absence of IL-10 ATA/ACC, i.e. intermediate IL-10 production in the donor and presence of IL-1Ra (allele 2) i.e. down regulation of IL-1 in the donor were associated with poor outcome.

Cirmena, A. Garuti, A.M. Raiola, A. Ibatici, M. van Lint, F. Patrone, F. Frassoni, A. Bacigalupo S.Martino's Hospital (Genoa, I) Background: Molecular monitoring of the BCR-ABL transcripts in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) provides important information about the leukemia cell mass and the response to therapy. After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) patients with persistently positive levels of BCR-ABL transcript have a molecular relapse and some of these patients progress to develop a cytogenetic or hematologic relapse. Objectives: To test whether molecular detection of BCR-ABL transcripts is comparable using peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirate samples after allogeneic HSCT. Patients and Methods: BCR-ABL transcripts were monitored the interval of time 2003 -2005 in 118 patients who received an allogeneic HSCT in chronic or advanced disease phase. BCR-ABL transcripts were evaluated concomitantly in 200 blood samples and 200 marrow samples (total 400 determinations) using real time PCR (QRT-PCR) assay to analyze BCR-ABL gene rearrangement (p210 b2a2 and b3a2). A complete molecular response (CMR) both for PB and BM we defined has undetectable levels of p210 and Major molecular response (MMR) was defined when p210/ABL ratios where <0.02%. Results: 135 double BM+PB determinations (67%) proved BCR-ABL negative; 61 double determinations (31%) were classified as \"persistently positive\" both in peripheral blood and in blood marrow; 4 determinations (2%) were discordant. Therefore 196/200 BCR-ABL determinations in peripheral blood and bone marrow (98 %) were concordant (Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.871; 95% CI 0.832 -0.902). QRT-PCR assay's sensibility and specificity were respectively 93.5% and 98.5%; positive and negative predictive values were respectively 96.7% and 97.1%. Conclusions. This study shows that BCR-ABL QRT PCR monitoring of CML patients after allogeneic HSCT with peripheral blood cells is concordant with bone marrow cells in 98% of cases, and thus may be used to monitor the disease. This may be relevant for patients, especially when quality of life issues are discussed together with the need for posttransplant monitoring. as conditioning regimen. The first twenty patients received 75 mg Campath as part of the conditioning regimen. The second cohort of twenty patients received Campath as a conventional cytoreductive treatment with the last application scheduled 14 days before SCT. The median age was 54 years (range, 35 to 65 years) and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4. The observation of late secondary graft failure in the first cohort of patients led to the analysis of lineage-specific engraftment and Campath levels on the day of transplant. Results: Data on Campath levels and lineage-specific chimerism are available for 24 patients. The median Campath level at the day of SCT was 110 ng/mL (range, <31.25 to 1820). After establishing the association of the Campath level with the time to complete (>95% donor chimerism) T-cell engraftment in a cox regression model (p=0.036) an arbitrary cut-off level of 250 ng/mL Campath was defined. 7 patients had Campath levels above this treshold, while 17 patients had lower plasma levels. The cumulative incidences of complete CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell chimerism at day +100 were 14% and 29% in patients with Campath levels >250 ng/mL compared to 82% both in patients with antibody levels <250 ng/mL (CD4subset, p=0.006; CD8-subset, p=0.017). Other potential factors like the type of study treatment, the CD34-count and CD3-count of the graft or the donor type did not have a significant impact on the kinetics of T-cell engraftment. Despite the use of donor lymphocytes to convert incomplete T-cell engraftment the cumulative incidence of progression at 1-year was 48% in patients with Campath levels > 250 ng/mL compared to 12% in patients with levels <250 ng/mL (graytest, p=0.043). Conclusions: A level > 250 ng/mL of Campath at the day of SCT may be a risk factor for delayed T-cell engraftment in patients who receive reduced intensity conditioning with Busulphan and Fludarabine. Whether delayed T-cell engraftment leads to an increase incidence of progression deserves further investigation.",

Kim, H. Messner, M. Minden, V. Gupta, J. Kuruvilla, J. Lipton Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, CAN) The introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) improved patients' survival and resulted in current trend of avoiding up-front allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in CML patients although allogeneic SCT is the only known curative treatment option for CML. The current recommendation for allogeneic SCT is for the cases resistant or intolerant to IM. The clearance kinetics of BCR/ABL transcript after allogeneic SCT, especially in IM resistant case is still to be elucidated. The current study investigated the kinetics of BCR/ABL mRNA transcript reduction after allogeneic SCT, and compared between IM na\u00efve/responsive and resistant groups. Since 2002, 16 CML cases were transplanted at PMH, Toronto, ON, Canada (median age 40 years (19-60 years), 6 male and 10 female, 15 myeloablative TBI-based and 1 nonmyeloablative conditioning, 10 sibling and 6 unrelated transplantation). Eight patients were IM na\u00efve (n=4), intolerant (n=2) or responsive case (n=2; Group A), while 8 patients were IM resistant case (no molecular response, n=7 and loss of response n=1; Group B) including T315I (n=1), F359V (n=1) and A459K mutation (n=1). No difference was noted between 2 groups in terms of age, disease stage at presentation and at the time of transplantation. The prior dose of IM before SCT in group B was 800mg/day (n=7) and 600mg/day (n=1). The reduction of BCR/ABL mRNA transcript below 5.0 log reduction was achieved within median 2 months in group A, while within 9 months in group B (p=0.007). The serial measures of BCR/ABL mRNA using quantitative PCR showed significant delay of clearance of BCR/ABL mRNA in group B at 4 months (4.34 vs 2.25 log reduction, p=0.002) and 6 months (4.41 vs 2.47 log reduction, p=0.003) compared to group A. However, after 9 months after SCT, no difference of BCR/ABL mRNA transcript levels was noted between 2 groups. Overall survival rate was similar between 2 groups (p=0.435) with median follow-up of 22 months among survivors. The CML cases resistant to IM seemed to have delayed clearance of BCR/ABL mRNA transcript after allogeneic SCT. Further study including large number of patients will be necessary to reach a clear conclusion on this issue. The GVHD titration up to 9 months after allogeneic SCT for IM resistant case will be a reasonable approach to induce more graft-versus-leukemia effect, and to achieve in-depth remission in IM resistant CML patients. Before conditioning, 302 autoT and 143 alloT were evaluated for disease status: 100 and 26 patients were in CR, 170 and 55 in PR, 4 and 13 in stable disease, 28 and 49 in progressive disease for autoT and alloT respectively. Among alloT patients, 73 received reduced intensity conditioning and 85 standard conditioning (72 Cyt+TBI, 33 Fluda+TBI, 23 Fluda+Bu+ATG, 8 Cyt+Bu and 21 other) . Before autoT the conditioning consisted of 224 Cyt+TBI, 45 BEAM and 44 other. After alloT, 71 patients developed an acute GVHD > grade II and 60 developed a chronic GVHD. The non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 29%. With a mean follow-up of 28 months for autoT and 40 months for alloT, the probabilities of 3-year, 5-year and 8-year overall survival were 80%, 66%, 45.5% after autoT and 52%, 48% and 35% after alloT respectively. An analysis aimed to determine the percentage of long-term survivors, or patients focused on the final plateau of survival curves was performed on alloT and autoT groups. A mixture model, gfcure with Splus statistical package determined the percentages of long-term survivors and its adequacy was verified graphically. The percentage of longterm survivors for the autoT group was 1.2%, with a mean survival length for uncured population of 160 months, both curves were close and consequently show good adequacy and the absence of a final plateau (Fig1). The percentage of long-term survivors for alloT was 34% (Fig 2) showing rather good adequacy. The study of the impact of usual prognosis factors (age, time diagnosis-transplant, sex match, HLA match, CMV status, type of conditioning, BM or PBSC, ABO compatibility and disease status before transplantation) on the percentage of long-term survivors showed that only the status of disease at transplant had a significant impact: (CR vs SD or PD, p=0.01 and PR vs SD or PD, HR: 0.30 [0.09-0.96] p=0.04). This study pointed out the possibility of curing B-CLL patients who responded to conventional chemotherapy with allogeneic transplantation.",

Arat Ankara University School of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Introduction: Imatinib has become the standard primary approach for the treatment of a newly diagnosed chronic phase myeloid leukemia (CML) patient, recently. Complete cytogenetic response is achieved on the majority of patients under treatment, but the disease remains in molecular level and after discontinuation of the drug, relapses occur inevitably. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is still the only curative treatment modality. In imatinib era centers are referring only the patients, who has imatinib resistance or patients with high relapse risk to transplant centers. Secondly, the period from diagnosis to transplantation is an important nominator. We have performed a case-matched control analysis in our CML (n=173) cohort. Patients and methods: CML patients who received imatinib before transplantation (n=20), were matched retrospectively according to EBMT (Gratwohl) score with imatinib naive ones (n=40) in 1:2 ratio. The median age at transplant in the imatinib group was 39 (19-57), gender F/M: 10/10, disease status 1st CP:13, 2nd CP: 4, AP: 2, BP: 1. The median imatinib dose that was used until transplantation was 200 gr, and imatinib therapy was discontinued at a median of 17.5 (7-210) days prior to transplantation. Only one of 20 patients was in molecular remission before transplantation. The median age of 40 patients in imatinib na\u00efve historical control group was 34 years (14-53), gender F/M: 14/26, and disease status 1st CP:32, 2nd CP:2, AP: 3, BP: 3. Results: The pretransplant variables were homogenous within groups with the exception of the time from diagnosis to transplant as expected. There was no significant difference in engrafment kinetics between the two groups. The cytogenetic response, transplantation related mortality, the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD were not significantly different in two groups . Moreover, no significant difference was observed till now in 2-year's disease free survival and overall survival estimations (Table) . Conclusion: Our single center retrospective case-matched analysis is in concordance with several recent reports. We observed that imatinib use prior to AHSCT does not negatively affect the early transplant related outcome and our 2 year's survival analysis. We have to wait for long term analysis of imatinib receiving transplant recipients for emergence of unwanted complications like late relapses.",

The median interval diagnosis-transplant was 12 Mo (2 Mo-24 years). Before transplant, 136 pts received hydroxyurea (HU) alone, 62 IFN-a (with 26+AraC) and only 9 received imatinib. EBMT scores were 0 (n=3), 1 (n=49), 2 (n=64), 3 (n=54), 4 (n=25), 5 (n=9), 6 (n=3). Stem cell sources were PBSC (n=16), BM (n=187), and BM+PBSC (n=4), from 182 HLA identical related and 25 unrelated donors. Seven pts received reduced intensity conditioning regimen, 200 received standard conditioning (125 +TBI and 75 -TBI). Of the 203 evaluated pts, the majority was transplanted in chronic phase (n=163), 19 in accelerated phase and 20 in blast crisis. After transplant, 197 engrafted, 103 pts developed an aGVHD grade II (51 grades III+IV) and 63 developed a cGVHD (29 limited/34 extensive). Forty-nine pts relapsed: 17 hematological, 7 cytogenetic, 1 molecular and 24 unspecified. At latest follow-up, 90 pts were alive, 18 with a limited and 12 with an extensive cGVHD, 117 pts died, 114 of whom the causes were known with 99 nonrelapse causes (35 GVHD, 3 second malignancies and 51 other causes), 12 from disease progression and 3 from unrelated causes. Median follow-up was 144 months, the 3year and 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 42% and 32.6%, 30% and 25.3% respectively. A multivariate analysis (age, pre-transplant status, EBMT score, graft, sex matching, HLA matching, conditioning, pretransplant treatment, TBI, interval diagnosis-transplant) showed a significant negative impact of the pre-transplant disease status on EFS (HR=2.24 (0.28-2.87), p=0.004), a significant impact of the EBMT score on EFS (HR=1.28 (0.07-3.13), p=0.0017), and on OS (HR=1.36 (0.08-3.71), p=0.0002). OS was negatively influenced by the pretransplant disease status (HR=2.07 (0.29-2.47), p=0.01) and ), p=0.01, and positively influenced by the sex mismatch (HR=0.55 (0.29-2.02), p=0.04).

Schetelig (1) (1)University Hospital Dresden (Dresden, D); (2)Hospital Chemnitz (Chemnitz, D) ; (3)German Clinic of Diagnostics (Wiesbaden, D) Objectives: In a first cohort of patients with B-CLL in an ongoing study on allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT) after reduced intensity conditioning with Fludarabine and Busulfan a cumulative dose of 75 mg Campath was given between day -9 and day -5 (Bu/Flu/Cam) plus Cyclosporine as GVHD-prophylaxis. Because of considerable infectious complications in this cohort of patients, the mode of Campath treatment was changed. The second cohort of patients received Campath as pre-conditioning therapy for one month with the last dose scheduled for day -14 (preCam/Bu/Flu), and Methotrexate was added to CSA. The aim of our investigation was to compare the reconstitution of T cell counts as surrogate marker of the immune competence. Patients and Methods: In 38 patients (12 after Bu/Flu/Cam and 26 after preCam/Bu/Flu) a number of overall 398 fourcolor flow cytometric measurements were performed to follow the reconstitution of CD3/CD4/CD8 and CD56 absolute counts (per \u00b5l) after aSCT (at least at days 30/100/180/365). Chimerism analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations were performed, too. The Campath level at the day of transplant was analysed with an ELISA for both cohorts. Results: Immune reconstitution after preCam/Bu/Flu was significantly faster than after Bu/Flu/Cam. Early T cell reconstitution at day 30 was significantly better after preCam/Bu/Flu -median CD3 absolute counts: 259 vs. 79/\u00b5l, p=0.026; CD4: 112 vs. 28/\u00b5l, p=0.011 and CD8: 129 vs. 39/\u00b5l, p=0.038. At day 100 CD4 counts remained significantly higher (224 vs. 77/\u00b5l, p=0.014 ). Normal T cell counts were achieved significantly earlier after preCam/Bu/Flu: day 87 vs. day 269 (p=0.007) after aSCT. NK cells at day 100 and even at day 365 were significantly lower after preCam/Bu/Flu -135 vs. 403/\u00b5l, p=0.003 and 124 vs. 282/\u00b5l, p=0.001. The CD4 count is known to be a critical value in the resistance to infections. Therefore, we analysed the time to achieve an absolute donor /kg CD34+ cells were collected after the 1st mobilisation attempt in 83 patients (65 %), whereas 45 patients (35 %) experienced a mobilisation failure according to this definition. No differences were observed between these groups in regard to gender, age, time from diagnosis to mobilisation, number of treatment lines, number of fludarabine courses, time from the last chemotherapy to mobilisation, disease status or amount of marrow infiltration at the time of mobilisation. Patients who failed to achieve collection of at least 2 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells had lower median platelet counts at the time of mobilisation (146 vs. 162 x 10 9 /l, P=0.019). Altogether 30 % of the patients who failed to achieve this goal had platelet counts < 100 x 10 9 /l compared to only 4 % of those with successful collections (P=0.001). Fourteen patients received a re-mobilisation course, which was successful in seven patients (50 %). To conclude, progenitor cell mobilisation is a problem in many patients with CLL. An adequate marrow function including platelet counts > 100 x 10 9 /l seems to be an important factor in terms of successful progenitor cell collection.",

Nagler, A. Vivante, L. Trakhtenbrot , R. Loewenthal, G. Rechavi, N. Amariglio, A. Shimoni , Y. Cohen Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Ramat Gan, IL) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo SCT) is currently the only curative treatment in classic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) and is often performed in advanced disease stages. JAK2 V617F mutation is thought to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of MPD. There is limited data on patients (pts) with JAK2 V617F undergoing alloSCT and on the course of this mutation in the post transplantation period. To investigate the course of JAK2 V617F mutation in pts undergoing alloSCT, we developed a sensitive and quantitative high throughput assay. JAK2 mutation detection was carried out using a chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) with a specific primer extension assay designed to detect the JAK2 V617F mutation. The level of mutation was calculated by the following formula: % T allele = (AUC T allele) x 100 / (AUC T allele +AUC G allele). T allele proportions were compared with routine methods for chimerism detection. Thirteen pts underwent alloSCT in the study period (1.2001-6.2006) , mean age 59 (34-72) years, 8 males and 5 females. Their diagnoses included idiopathic myelofibrosis -5, post polycythemia myelofibrosis -2, post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis -1 and sAML -5. JAK2 V617F was found in 7/13 (54%) pts, their clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 . All but one pt had more than 50% of the mutated allele (mean T allele 74%, range 16-98%), suggesting the existence of a homozygous clone for this mutation in most pts at the time of alloSCT. Compared to pts without JAK2 V617F, more pts with JAK2 V617F underwent alloSCT due to sAML (4/7 vs. 1/6) and more have undergone splenectomy (4/7 vs. 1/6) (ns). Disease duration (227 vs. 126 months) and median survival (863 vs. 871 days) was the same in both groups. After alloSCT, level of the mutant T allele decreased from baseline in 4 patients and remained unchanged in one. There was a very high correlation between the decrease in the mutant T allele and the decrease in host cells as detected by FISH (n=1) and microsatelites (n=3) (r=0.97, p<0.001). In summary, in our cohort pts with JAK V617F MPD and clinical indication for alloSCT were mostly homozygous for the mutation and they seemed to have a more aggressive clinical behavior than pts without the mutation. The good correlation between JAK2 V617F and other methods for chimerism detection in the post alloSCT period suggests that our novel sequenom based assay may be used for follow up in pts with MPD undergoing alloSCT.",

Ugur Bilgin, S.M. Bakanay, H. Koc, M. Beksac, O. Ilhan, M. Ozcan, G. Gurman, M. Arat Ankara University School of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is the gold standard for relapse after alloHSCT. The role of single agent or combined application of imatinib,which is highly effective for induction of molecular remission in CML patients, in post alloHSCT relapse is still an open question. In this single center study, we retrospectively analyzed molecular response and graft functions of relapsed CML patients after transplantation, who received imatinib only (n=10), Imatinib+DLI (n=9). The median age of patients in the imatinib group (group 1) was 29 (range, 19-54) , F/M:3/7. Nine patients were in CP1 and one was in CP2 at the time of transplantation. In the combination group (group 2), the median age was 41 years (20-54) , F/M:3/6. In group 2 the status of patients at transplantation was CP1: 4, AP: 3 and BP:1. Three patients received reduced intensity and the remaining myeloablative conditioning. Molecular remission (MR) was defined as; complete negativity of RQ-PCR (<3 log). The great majority of the patients achieving MR proved to be in complete chimeric (CC) status. After 6 months of follow-up; 9 of 10 patients treated with only imatinib (90%) achieved MR at median 3(2-5)months. Only one patient remained refractory to treatment and died because of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Two patients relapsed after 6 months, received DLI, one of them died of DLI induced GVHD, the other one obtained MR. After 12 months of follow-up, 3 of 7 patients relapsed and 2 had remission after addition of DLI to imatinib. At the end of 12 months in group 1 only four patients remained in sustained MR with Imatinib only (40%) and three after combination with DLI (70%). In group 2, 4of 9 patients were treated with upfront DLI plus imatinib and 5 of 9 patients with imatinib followed by DLI up to 6 months. After 6 months of follow up; 5 patients remained refractory but 4 patients achieved MR (44%). At the end of 12 months; 3 of the 4 patients were still in molecular remission (33%). Two patients died of progressive disease, 3 patients remained refractory (recurrent relapse) and one patient experienced molecular relapse. Our single center experience has shown that MR and CC status is achievable after imatinib in relapsed CML patients after alloHSCT but the response is not durable. DLI synergized with imatinib for induction of MR but the cumulative high risk CML patients in group 2 caused to low remission rates. DLI only should be the standard approach in CML patients with molecular relapse.",

Bokemeyer, B. Fehse, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center (Hamburg, D) Polyclonal antithymocyte globulins (ATG) are used in allogeneic stem cell transplantation mainly due to their anti-T cell activity. ATG contains antibodies targeting antigens expressed on various hematopoietic cells. Because of the known effects of ATG on B cells, we assessed anti-CLL activity of two commercially available ATGs at clinically relevant concentrations (10 -100\u00b5g/ml) compared to Alemtuzumab (1-10\u00b5g/ml) in CLL samples from 16 patients. Cytotoxicity was determined by staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and flow cytometry. ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F) and Thymoglobulin at 100\u00b5g/ml induced a mean of 30.2% and 53.7% apoptosis. Alemtuzumab did not induce complement-independent cytotoxicity. Addition of complement strongly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of both ATG preparations. At 100\u00b5g/ml mean complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was 68.5% for ATG-F, 82.4% for Thymoglobulin and 61% for Alemtuzumab (10\u00b5g/ml). CDC was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both ATGs enhanced the effect of Fludarabine. Absorption on primary T cells revealed that the anti-CLL effect of ATG was in part due to antibodies targeting antigens not expressed on primary T cells. We conclude that ATG is an effective agent against CLL in vitro.",

Lange (2) (1)L.Hirszfeld Institute (Wroclaw, PL); (2)Lower Silesian Center for Cellular Transplantation (Wroclaw, PL) Allotransplantation in CML offers long lasting remission which largely depends on the immunological surveillance employing alloreactivity. Therefore we studied a group of 31 patients from 0,4 to 12 years (median: 4,4 years) post HSCT for the level of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and T cell subsets in blood. Five and 26 patients received myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning, respectively and were transplanted from 17 sibling or 14 unrelated donors. TREC numbers were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and T cell subsets CD4+CD27+CD45RO, CD4+CD27-CD45RO+, CD4+CCR7+ and CD4+CCR7-were described by flow cytometry. Sixteen patients (51,6%) were TREC positive (mean number 559,98, from 1,30 to 4412,00). TREC positive patients were not significantly younger than TREC-patients (28 vs 37 years) and not significantly more recent post transplant. TREC positive patients differ from their TREC negative counter partners with respect to: I. lower frequency of cGvHD (3/16 vs 8/15, p=0,044) II. higher proportion of CD4+CCR7+ cells (5,07\u00b10,75% vs 2,67\u00b10,33%, p=0,02) III. higher proportion of CD4+CD27+CD45RO-(3,67\u00b10,61% vs 2,45\u00b10,55%, p=0,089) IV. lower proportion of CD4+CD27-CD45RO+ cells population (5,38\u00b10,87%, vs 9,09\u00b11,67% p=0,093) V. the presence of post transplant chimerism was complete in all TREC positive but mixed in 3 out of 15 TREC negative pts. VI. post transplant relapse which was seen only in TREC negative patients We conclude that the presence of TREC is affected by cGvHD and older age at transplant and favoured the presence in blood of naive and central memory cells.

Cevreska, I. Panovska-Stavridis, M. Ivanovski, A. Stojanovik, B. Georgievski University Clinical Center Skopje (Skopje, MK) In spite of the treatment progress for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the last few years, the disease remains incurable. Although, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is still considered as experimental approach for CLL and is associated with a number of risks to a number of progressive CLLs is being offered. The mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (VH) genes is a major prognostic indicator for the clinical course and outcome of the CLL patients. More recently, additional prognostic categories have been identified by recognizing disease subsets which utilize unique VH genes. Examples include the V3-21, V1-69 and V3-72 genes which are invariably associated with progressive and stable disease, respectively. The aim of our study was to investigate the possibility to identify early after diagnosis suitable CLL candidates for alloSCT among CLL subsets that utilize unique VH genes. Methods: The study group consisted of 106 consecutive CLLs that had been diagnosed at our Institution prior to 2000, according to standard morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria. VH gene family usage and mutational status were obtained by direct sequencing of RT-PCR amplified RNA samples. Correlations between the different CLL subsets were made using standard statistical tests. Our results showed that 61 (57,6 %) patients utilize mutated VH genes. The most frequently rearranged VH gene in our CLLs was V1-69 gene, in all 25 cases (23.6%) with unmutated sequence. We compared the overall survival (OS) of the V1-69 subgroup against all the other patients. The two groups were comparable regarding the sex, age, total tumor mass (TTM) score and Rai stage. The VH1-69 group has median OS of 56.7 months and all others patients have median OS of 125. 8,(p<0.0001). Further analyzes of the survival between VH1-69 cases and all other unmutated VH genes showed no differences between the two subgroups regarding the age, gender, TTM score, Rai stage and OS. No other unique VH gene, utilized in our study group, had frequency important of analyzing. Our data do not support the thesis that patients expressing V1-69 gene form a distinct subgroup of CLL patients, but our results confirmed that CLL with unmutated VH gene sequence has poorer OS. We suggest that all younger patients that utilize unmutated VH genes should be consider as candidates for early alloSCT, immediately after the first complete remission, if HLA identical donor is available.",

Kr\u00f6ger, T. de Witte on behalf of the EBMT-CLWP Cytogenetics (CG) represent one of the most important prognostic factors for pts with MDS, being therefore required by the IPSS to predict life-expectancy. However, the impact of CG on the outcome of pts undergoing allo-HSCT for MDS is still unclear. We aimed to retrospectively assess the impact of CG on overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), relapse probability (REL), and TRM in pts with MDS/sAML undergoing allo-HSCT from HLA-identical siblings. Data from 1506 pts with MDS/sAML who underwent a first allograft from HLA-identical siblings from 1981 to 2006 reported to EBMT were assessed. The following covariates were included: CG (good-vs standard-vs high-risk according to the IPSS); stage at HSCT (untreated vs treated in CR vs treated not in CR); FAB classification (RA/RARS vs RAEB/CMML vs RAEB-t/sAML); age; time from dx to HSCT (<5 vs 5 to 8 vs > 8 months); calendar year in which HSCT was performed; type of conditioning (standard vs RIC); source of stem cells (BM vs PB). A complete information dataset was available in 839 pts. 18% of pts had RA or RARS, 29% had RAEB or CMML, and 53% had RAEB-t or sAML. Age was >50 years in 24%. CG classified 56% of pts as good-, 23% as intermediate-, and 21% as high-risk. At the time of HSCT, 39% were untreated; among treated pts, 52% were in CR. A RIC regimen was administered to 15%. Source of stem cell was PB in 43%. By univariate analysis, subdivision of pts in the IPSS riskcategories for CG associated with significantly different OS (at 60 mos, alive pts in good-, interm.-, and high-risk groups were 47%, 40% and 31%, respectively), RFS (alive pts at 60 mos 43%, 40% and 23%, respectively), relapse probability (34%, 35% and 57% at 60 mos, respectively) and TRM (34%, 40% and 43% at 60 mos, respectively). By multivariate COX, CG and age were the variables associated with all the outcomes. FAB classification together with stage at HSCT associated with OS, RFS, and REL; conditioning intensity associated both with TRM and REL. Concerning REL, the interval between diagnosis and HSCT was also significant, whereas the source of stem cells associated only with OS, with the hazard associated with PB being higher in comparison to BM. In summary, this study showed that CG have strong prognostic impact on outcome of pts undergoing allo-HSCT from HLA-identical siblings for MDS/sAML and should be taken into consideration when selecting candidates for this treatment strategy. Detailed analyses will be presented.",

Pascutto, G. Bandini, R. Fanin, A. Bosi for GITMO In this retrospective multicenter study, we report the outcome of 231 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent transplantation with a human leukocyte antigen identical sibling donor (group A: 160 pts) or with an unrelated well-matched volunteer donor (group B: 71 pts.). All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Those who transplanted from an HLA unrelated donor received, in addition, ATG at the dose of 7.5 mg -10 mg/Kg recipient body weight. The median age of patients was 42.7 years (range 17.3 -66 years); 126 were males and 105 females. The age and sex distribution were comparable in the two groups, as well as the disease status at transplant. The overall survival (OS) was not significantly different in the two groups (5-year survival for group A: 38.5%; group B: 37% log-rank test: p= 0.17). The prevalence of acute GvHD was similar in the two groups: 41% in group A and 37.5% in group B. The relapse rate was significantly increased (log-rank test: p=0.02) in patients receiving an HLA identical sibling transplant (5-year cumulative probability of relapse = 46.6%) compared to patients with an unrelated well-matched donor (20.6%). The 5year non-relapse mortality rate was lower in sibling transplants (37.1% vs. 46.8%, log-rank test: p=0.03). Although the OS is similar in the two groups, the lower relapse rate in group B suggests a stronger graft versus myelodysplasia effect in this subgroup of patients. In this view, the use of a reduced intensity regimen in patients undergoing transplantation with an unrelated donor might lead to an improvement in the outcome P456 Equal effectiveness of haematopoietic stem cell tranplantation for patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia induced by prior curative cytotoxic therapy R.

Beelen University Hospital of Essen (Essen, D) Therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS) and acute leukemia (t-AML) are reported to imply a worse prognosis as compared to de novo MDS and s-AML. Between 04/94 and 10/06, 147 patients (median age 47 years) with MDS received allogeneic HSCT in our center including 11 patients with t-MDS and 24 with t-AML. Treatment related disease was induced by prior chemotherapy for NHL (n=11), HD (n=9), gynaecologic malignancies (n=8), testicular cancer (n=4), endocrine malignancies (n=2), ALL (n=1). The outcome of HSCT in patients with de novo and therapy-related diseases were compared. The effects of prior cytotoxic exposure, cytogenetics, IPSS, donor type, and disease stage were appraised to determine influences on overall survival, disease free survival, relapse, and non relapse mortality (OS, DFS, REL, and NRM). We found no difference in OS, EFS, REL, NRM for t-MDS/t-AML compared to MDS/s-AML. Using the Kaplan Meyer method OS was 37% and 36% (Log Rank p=0,45), EFS was 36% and 37% (Log Rank p=0,34), relapse occurred in 25% and 20% (Log Rank p=0,47), NRM in 49% and 47% (Log Rank p=0,53) for MDS/s-AML and t-MDS/t-AML after a follow-up of 10 years, respectively. Subgroup analysis for MDS and t-MDS as well as for s-AML and t-AML generated similar results. Cox Regression was performed to identify disease related risk factors. Only advanced disease stage was identified to worsen outcome: REL, OS, and EFS (p=0.02). Advanced disease state is associated with an inferior OS (48% vs. 24%), EFS (46% vs. 22%), and an increased relapse ratio (39% vs. 13%). Alternative donor and matched sibling donor grafts had similar results. In this analysis no influence of prior cytotoxic exposure, cytogenetic abnormalities according to the IPSS classification, as well as IPSS Score for MDS at diagnosis on above mentioned endpoints was detectable.",

Kr\u00f6ger (1) The V617F-JAK2-mutation occurs in about 50 % of patients with myelofibrosis and is a reliable marker to monitor residual disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The establishment of valid complete remission criteria for myelofibrosis especially after allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains a major issue. We developed a new, highly sensitive real-time PCR to monitor and quantify V617F-JAK2-positive cells after dose-reduced allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The mutated differs from wild-type JAK2 allele by just one nucleotide exchange (G \u00e0 T) leading to the valine phenylalanine (V \u00e0 F) transition. Using PrimerExpress\u00ae we designed a TaqMan\u00ae PCR where the reverse primer (RP) terminates at the (3';) nucleotide corresponding to this point mutation. Thus, this reverse primer should bind with higher affinity to the mutated than to the wild-type allele. To increase the specificity while conserving optimal sensitivity of the MRDspecific PCR we generated a set of primers shortened each time by one nucleotide at their 5' end. In parallel, all those shortened primers were designed to contain an additional mutation at the third to last 3' position. This allowed us to identify the reverse primer combining high specificity with so far not reported sensitivity (0.01 %). After 22 allogeneic stem cell transplantation procedures in 21 JAK2-positive patients with myelofibrosis, 78 % became PCR-negative. In 15 out of 17 patients (88 %), JAK2 remained negative after a median follow-up of 20 months. JAK2-negativity was achieved after a median of 89 days post allograft (range, 19 -750 days). A significant inverse correlation was seen for JAK2-positivity and donor cell chimerism (r: -0.91, p < 0.001). Four of five patients who never achieved JAK2-negativity fulfilled during the entire follow-up all criteria for complete remission recently proposed by the Internationaal Working Group. Suggesting a major role for JAK2 measurement to determine depths of remission. In one case, residual JAK2 positive cells could be eliminated by donor lymphocyte infusion, supporting the graft versus myelofibrosis effect. In conclusion, allogeneic stem cell transplantation after dose-reduced conditioning induces high rates of molecular remission in JAK2-positive myelofibrosis patients and quantification. V617F-Jak2 mutation by real-time PCR allows detecting minimal residual disease to guide adoptive immunotherapy.",

Willasch (1) , G. Schneider (2), B.S. Reincke (1) Characterization of increasing mixed chimerism offers the possibility to identify patients with impending relapse. Several prospective trials showed, that pre-emptive immunotherapy can principally prevent relapse in these high risk patients. However, these studies were not able to identify ongoing relapse in all patients. Possible reasons might be the moderate sensitivity (1E-2) of the applied methods as well as the fact that relapse can develop within days. Short tandem repeat PCR (STR-PCR) is the gold standard for characterization of chimerism. However, due to technical reasons this method shows a limited sensitivity of 1E-2. Our goal was to establish a chimerism analysis method with high informativity, sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy. The improvement of sensitivity is achievable by a quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) approach with sequence polymorphisms (SPs) as targets. SPs represent the most frequent genetic variation. Most of the SPs are biallelic and differ only in one single nucleotide. In this study, a panel of 29 selected markers was evaluated in 317 patients with leukemia and MDS, who received allo-SCT. Marker specific dilutions from volunteers' DNA served as standard for quantification of chimerism. In total, 5415 post-transplant samples were analyzed. Recipient genotype discrimination was possible in 96% with a mean number of 2.5 (1 to 7) markers. Sensitivity of the method was 1E-3 in 83.3% of the assays. It was possible to very accurately detect autologous signals from 0 to 0.5% [confidence interval (CI) 95% \u00b1 0.2], from 0.5 to 1% (CI 95% \u00b1 0.4), from 1 to 2% (CI 95% \u00b1 0.6) and from 2 to 5% (CI 95% \u00b1 1.2). Reproducibility of the quantified signals was independent from the amount of DNA. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a SP-chimerism system allowing to perform routine chimerism analyses for virtually all patients with high sensitivity, excellent reproducibility and accuracy. Quantification of chimerism is reliably possible with marker-specific standard dilution series from volunteers. We provide unequivocal data on CIs 95% of autologous signals for measuring changes of autologous signals in consecutive samples as statistically significant or not. This is an important prerequisite for reliable assessment of the clinical impact of dynamic developments of chimerism. The system allows conducting prospective studies to evaluate whether SP-RQ-PCR is superior to STR-PCR in terms of clinical impact of chimerism.",

Esser, A. Willasch, E. Rettinger, U. Koehl, S. Kuci, T. Klingebiel University Children's Hospital (Frankfurt, D) Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMA) is a rare and aggressive disease of childhood and adolescence. According to the German CWS 96 Study, patients above the age of ten with bone and or bone marrow metastasis and an alveolar histology do not have a realistic chance to survive their disease (2 years EFS: 0%). Therefore, we were evaluating whether allogeneic cell therapy might be an option to improve these patients' prognosis. For effective allogeneic stem cell transplantation an important prerequisite is a cellular target on the malignant cells. Such a target can be the Wilmstumour Gen 1 Peptide (WT1). We could show that RMA tumours and RMA cell lines express WT1 as high as AML cells. As this tumour entity also expresses HLA-class 1 antigens on the cell surface, alveolar RMA patients fulfil substantial requirements to be good candidates for allo-SCT. Based on these findings, we started a pilot trial in which 9 patients were included. All patients have had an alveolar subtype (n=9). Median age was 17.5 years (range: 5.0 to 27.2). Patients were treated in CR 1 (n=4), CR2 (n=1) or PR (n=4). As patients were heavily pre-treated with chemo-and radiotherapy and two of them have had already high dose chemotherapy, a reduced conditioning regimen was chosen. This consisted of fludarabine 150mg/m\u00b2, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 and 10 days of OKT3. All patients received a CD3/CD19 depleted peripheral stem cell grafts from either an HLA haploidentical family donor (n=8) or from a HLA identical sibling (n=1). The median number of stem cells was 7.7x10 6 CD34 pos cell/kg with a substantial number of NK, monocytes and dendritic cells. All patients showed rapid and sustained engraftment with an ANC >1000 on day 12 (range: 9-16) and more than 20.000 Thrombocytes on day 16 (range: 12-19). GVHD grade 0-I occurred in 6 patients, grade II in 2 patients and grade III in one patient. All patients responded to transplantation and achieved complete remission (n=9; 100%) on day 60 post transplant. Consecutively, three patients relapsed; one patient died of TRM and one due to non-TRM reasons. From the relapsing patients 1 could be rescued by additional treatment. At present 5/9 patients are alive and in complete remission with a median survival time of 246 days (68 to 374 days). In conclusion, allogeneic stem cell transplantation seems to be a promising approach in the treatment of patients with high risk RMA who otherwise did not have a realistic chance to survive.",

Veys Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is caused by defective expression of the beta-2 integrin, CD18, and can result in life threatening infections in the first few years of life. The CD18 molecule forms part of the lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) when associated with CD11a, Mac-1 with CD11b and p150-95 with CD11c. These molecular complexes are essential for effective migration and homing of immune cells, including neutrophils, dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers the possibility of curative therapy for LAD, however conventional myeloablative conditioning may not be sufficient to result in complete donor chimaerism (Thomas et al Blood; 86: 1629-35) , and agents such as Etoposide may be required in addition to Busulphan and Cyclophosphamide. This may lead to significant toxicity and a mortality rate of over 25% was reported in this European study that treated 14 patients. An alternative strategy might be to use a more immunosuppressive but less myeloablative conditioning regimen. We report our experience in transplanting LAD deficiency over a 20 year period: The first 3 children all succumbed after myeloablative SCT. Five subsequent children received matched unrelated donor T cell replete bone marrow grafts following conditioning with Melphalan (140/m\u00b2), Fludarabine (150/m\u00b2) and Alemtuzamab (1mg/kg). All had successful multi-lineage reconstitution with full donor chimaerism in four patients and 94% in the fifth. Complete immunological reconstitution was confirmed by mitogen proliferation assays, and detection of normal antibody responses in the four patients vaccinated to date. Normal levels of CD18 expression were confirmed by flow cytometry. All patients are alive and well, and remain free of infective complications. Our experience highlights the benefits of reduced intensity conditioning for LAD and emphasises the importance of treating patients early after diagnosis and before serious infective complications develop.",

Kalwak, J. Owoc-Lempach, A. Dyla, E. Gorczynska, M. Ussowicz, D. Turkiewicz, M. Slociak, D. W\u00f3jcik, A. Chybicka Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) The aim of the study was to analyze the correlation between the number of grafted CD34+ and CD3+ cells/kg and the incidence of severe GvHD in children undergoing allogeneic HCT from HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donors (UD). 115 pts (median age 11.4; ALL n=41, AML n=22, CML n=21, MDS/JMML n=10, NHL/HD n=4, SAA/FA n=13, SCID/WAS n=4) underwent unmanipulated allogeneic BMT (n=34) or PBSCT (n=81) from UD between 1999 and 2005. There were 88 matched-and 27 mismatched donor-recipient pairs, respectively (acc. to BFM). Among 88 matched pairs, 51 were 10/10 HLA-allele matched, whereas in another 37 cases 9/10 alleles were matched. In the mismatched group there were 22 pairs with a 8/10 allele-match and 5 pairs with a 7/10 allelematch, respectively. No single DRB1* mismatch was accepted. For in-vivo TCD pts were given either median 30 mg/kg ATG-Fresenius (94 pts) or 10 mg/kg Thymoglobuline (21 pts). A distinct correlation between the degree of HLA-match and the risk of grades III-IV aGvHD was found (p=0.04; Cox univariate analysis). Probability of aGvHD was 0.34 and 0.17 in the mismatched/matched groups, respectively. No difference was observed in the probability of extensive cGvHD (0.33 vs 0.2 in the mismatched vs matched groups; p=NS). Cox model disclosed no correlation between the number of grafted CD34+ cells/kg or CD3+ cells/kg and the incidence of severe acute or chronic GvHD and no influence of other factors incl. stem cell source, sex mismatch or ATG brand. Pts in the mismatched group were given slightly higher numbers of CD3+ cells/kg (4.9 vs 3.0 x 10 8 in the matched group) and similar numbers of CD34+ cells/kg (median 8.1 vs 8.9 x 10 6 in the matched group). Despite a higher incidence of severe aGvHD in the mismatched group, probability of 5-year survival was slightly better in that group (pS = 0.61 vs pS = 0.52 in the matched group, p=NS). In conclusion, there is no correlation between the numbers of grafted CD34+ cells/kg and CD3+ cells/kg and the incidence of severe GvHD in the UD setting in children. It is safe and feasible to perform allogeneic transplants from mismatched UD, provided a detailed selection of > 1 HLA-allelemismatched donors is performed. It is not necessary to limit the number of transplanted CD34+ cells to 6-8 x 10 6 /kg, which had been previously suggested by studies performed in Europe or USA in adults. Further studies are warranted to compare results of unmanipulated and TCD-mismatched UD or haploidentical transplants.",

Imai (1) We analyzed retrospectively the stem cell transplantations (SCTs) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in Japan between 1981 and 2005. 143 cases were diagnosed as SCID and 100 cases were reported to be transplanted. Of these 72 times of SCTs of 68 cases were analyzed. B+ SCID patients were 44 cases, B-SCID patients were 15 cases and other types including Omenn syndrome were 9 cases. 13 cases were transplanted below 3 months of age. Bone marrow (BM) from HLA matched related donor (MRD) including matched sibling donor (MSD), BM from HLA matched unrelated donor (UR-BM), BM from mismatch related donor (mMRD), and cord blood (CB) were transplanted in 16, 4, 29 and 19 cases, respectively. 43 cases were transplanted without conditioning. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) were performed in 12 and 13 cases respectively. Death until 40 days after SCT was observed in 12 cases. 9 cases were dead during 40 days and 1 year after SCT. 5 cases were dead after 1 year of SCTs. Early deaths were mostly related to pre-SCT pulmonary infections especially due to cytomegalovirus. Late deaths were related to insufficient engraftment of lymphocytes. No significant difference of prognosis was observed among the types of SCID. Overall survival (OS) rate for patients receiving UR-CB (4years-OS: 79.0%) was comparable to those of MRD-BM (5 years-OS: 87.5%) and significantly superior to those of UR-BM mMRD (5 years-OS: 50.0%) and mMRD (5 years-OS: 50.7%).

Reports on bone marrow transplantation in children with DS are limited. Methods: Histories of 11 children with acute leukaemia and DS who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in eight German/Austrian BMT centers between 1996 and 2006 were analysed retrospectively. Indications for transplantation were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in 8 cases (2 x first complete remission (CR1, 4 x CR2, and 2 x CR3) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in 3 cases (2 x CR2 and 1 x partial response after first relapse). Five children received a graft from an HLA-matched sibling, four from an HLA-matched unrelated donor, one from an HLA-matched mother, and one from an haploidentical mother. Conditioning regimens included total body irradiation (TBI) in seven children. A reduced intensity (RIC) protocol containing 2 Gy TBI and fludarabin was given to two patients, another five received a myeloablative regimen with 12 Gy TBI either combined with cyclophosphamide or etoposid. Treosulfan or busulfan were used in the remaining four children. Results: 4/11 (36%) patients are alive at 8, 12, 39, and 63 months after BMT. Three of them were treated with 12 Gy TBI, one received busulfan instead. Main cause of treatment failure was relapse. All relapsed patients (5/11) died 3, 7.5, 8.5, 13, and 20 months after BMT, respectively. 2 children died of transplant related complications, one from severe exfoliative dermatitis and sepsis after a treosulfan-containing regimen, the other from GVHD-related infections after RIC. Unusual regimen related toxicity (RRT) was reported in 3/11 (27%) patients, including exfoliative dermatitis, sepsis, pancreatitis, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, and severe stomatitis. Acute GvHD of the skin was observed in 10/11 patients. Conclusion: In our small group of patients relapse was the major cause of death rather than RRT.

El-Solh King Faisal Specialist Hospital (Riyadh, SA) Severe congenital cytopenia (SCN) and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) are constitutional bone marrow disorders that present with a specific single lineage cytopenia Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the treatment of choice for SCN patients who failed G-CSF treatment or developed myelodysplasia or leukemia and, for DBA patients who required high doses or failed corticosteroid therapy. We report on 15 (median age of 5 years, range of 0.4 to 12.2) constitutional single cytopenia patients (5 SCN and 10 DBA) who were transplanted between 1993 and 2006.The reason for transplantation in all cases is failure of medical treatment. None has developed myelodysplasia or leukemia. All patients had received HLA-identical graft from sibling in14 patients and from mother in the remaining patient. They were conditioned with standard doses of busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU/CY) regimen. ATG was added to the regimen only for heavily transfused patients (6 patients). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine (CSA) only in 2 patients or CSA and short course of methotrexate (MTX) in the remaining patients. Myeloid engraftment was achieved in all patients. Platelets failed to engraft in one DBA patient and another one died early prior to platelet engraftment. Two DBA patients rejected their grafts 1 and 9 months post transplant. One continued to be transfusion dependant and the other one failed the second and third transplants and subsequently died of disseminated candidiasis 10 months post the first transplant. Two other patients (DBA and SCN) succumbed to pulmonary complications 1and12 months post transplantation, respectively. Acute GvHD was seen in one patient and chronic gut GvHD in another. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival for the whole group were 86.2% and 75.4 % respectively.

The grafts were related marrows in 9 patients (HLA-identical relative n= 8 and one-antigen mismatched mother n=1) or mismatched unrelated cord in 2 patients. Six patients were conditioned with busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU/CY) regimen and the remaining five patients were conditioned with busulfan, cyclophosphamide and Etoposide (BU/CY/VP-16) in standard dosages. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and short-course of methotrexate in 7 patients or steroid in 2 patients. All patients but one engrafted at a median time of 25 days (range: 15-34) post stem cell infusion. Grade 1 acute skin GVHD was observed in one patient only and veno-occlussive disease (VOD) in 3 patients. Three out of the eleven patients relapsed at a median time of 42 days post transplant and subsequently died of progressive disease. One engrafted patients lost his graft at 245 days post transplant and had autologous marrow recovery and remained in remission for 8 years post transplant. One patient failed to engraft and died of severe VOD and sepsis. All patients who received VP-16 as a part of their conditioning regimen continued to be long-term survivors. In summary, allogeneic SCT has dramatically improved the JMML survival. Adding VP-16 to the conditioning regimen might have a favorable outcome however this finding merits a prospective evaluation in a larger cohort of patients.",

            "text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acquired severe aplastic anaemia in paediatric patients in the Czech Republic -clinical outcomes: retrospective study (1991 -2006) E. Pindurova (1) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a standard part of a treatment algorithm in childhood acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA), either as a first option in case when HLA matched sibling (MSD) is available or as an alternative given to the patients who failed previous immunosuppressive therapy (IST). In a summarizing report, we analyze our 16year (I/1991 -X/2006 ) experience with allo-SCT for SAA in children all over the Czech Republic. At the only pediatric transplant centre providing allo-SCT in our country so far 34 patients (17 male, 17 female) of median age 13 years (range 2 -18) underwent SCT for hepatitis associated SAA (n=7), idiopathic SAA(n=26) or MSAA/MDS-RC (n=1). 25 children (73.5%) underwent SCT using MSD (2-27 years, median 14). 9 of them (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) received prior SCT corticoids and/or anabolics, 16 underwent SCT as the treatment of choice. The interval between diagnosis and transplantation ranged from 15 to 1250 days (median 32). Bone marrow (BM) was used as a stem cell source in all but 4 (16%) patients, who received PBSC (combined with BM in one). 84% of patients were conditioned with ALG/ATG and cyclophosphamide (CYC). With standard MTX/CsA prophylaxis, acute GVHD grade II-IV developed in 12.5% and extensive chronic GVHD in 14 % of them. 9 patients, who failed previous even repeated courses of IST (ALG or ATG/CsA), received grafts from unrelated donors (UD; n=8) or HLA identical parent (n=1). The interval between diagnosis and transplantation ranged from 212 to 1713 days (median 360). 8 patients were conditioned with fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) (6-14.4 Gy) and CYC (120mg/kg), 1 patient received single dose TBI (200cGy), fludarabine and CYC. All received ATG. Acute graft rejection occurred in the latter patient, who afterwards received a second graft from the same donor. Acute GVHD grade II-IV was observed in 66%, chronic GVHD occured so far in 28% of patients in risk. At a median follow up of 68 months the overall survival of the whole cohort is 94%, with transplantrelated mortality of 6% (mucor and aGVHD gr.III-IV were the primary causes of death in two patients). Our experience is proving the benefits of allo-SCT in children suffering from SAA, current conditioning regimen used in MSD SCT is satisfactory. We are now focusing on decreasing the risk of later side effects by reducing TBI in recipients of grafts from UD.

Sims-Poston, P. Eldridge, G. Hale St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, USA) Objectives: CD34+-selection of hematopoietic grafts for patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is frequently used to obtain a tumorfree graft. The majority of published experience is with peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) products; only scant information has been published on bone marrow grafts. We reviewed our experience using CD34+-selection of bone marrow grafts in children undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Methods: After obtaining institutional approval, we performed a retrospective review of the medical records of patients who underwent autologous stem cell collection at St. Jude. From January 1, 1999 , to December 31, 2003 , 373 patients underwent autologous HSCT; 133 received marrow grafts, 232 received PBSC grafts, and 8 received a combination. Seventeen patients, 15 with neuroblastoma and 2 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, underwent bone marrow harvests for CD34+-selection of their stem cell grafts. Grafts were analyzed for residual tumor when appropriate. All grafts were included in the processing analysis. Results: Seventeen patients had 20 grafts processed on the Isolex 300i Magnetic Cell Selection System\u00ae device, and 16 received 19 CD34 purified grafts. Four patients were not included in the engraftment analysis: a) one did not receive the collected product, b) one received a tandem product, and c) two received products that were composed of 2 or 3 combined purified products. Following selection, marrow grafts contained a median of 1.4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (range, 0.09 -8.3 x 106/kg) and a median of 0.014 x108 TNC cells/kg (range, 0.001 -0.09 x 108/kg). The median CD34% recovery was 30.9% (range, 9.3-57.1%), with the median CD34 purity being 95.5% (range, 62.2%-98.8%). All patients engrafted. The median time to ANC 500/mm\u00b3 was 19 days (range, 12 -35 days), and to platelet recovery was 28 days (range 18 -37 days). No patient died from transplant-related complications. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that CD34+-selection of marrow grafts is feasible and these grafts are able to successfully reconstitute hematopoiesis in patients undergoing autologous BMT. To our knowledge, this is the first series describing CD34+-selection involving bone marrow grafts.",

Okuma, D. Srivastava, G. Hale St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, USA) Objective: Prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), all patients (pts) underwent CT chest, abdomen, and sinus to screen for infections. However, it is unclear whether this extensive imaging evaluation is warranted. Methods: Medical records of HSCT pts at St. Jude from Jan. 1, 2004 1, to Dec. 31, 2005 were reviewed. Of 198 pts identified, 11 were excluded for tandem HSCTs, no pre-HSCT scans performed, or greater than 2 months between imaging and HSCT; 187 were included in the final analysis. Results: 131 pts received allogeneic (allo) grafts and 56 autologous (auto) grafts; females compromised 51 allo and 25 auto pts. The mean age at HSCT was 10.6 years (allo) and 10 years (auto). 73 allo and 39 auto pts were Caucasian. Peripheral blood stem cell (60%) or bone marrow (40%) grafts were infused. Of the allo pts, 48.1% received related mismatched grafts and 30.5% received HLA-matched unrelated grafts. Clinical symptoms and physical examination were reviewed in the medical record to correlate with imaging findings; >85% of the allo and >80% of auto pts did not have sinus, pulmonary, cardiac or gastrointestinal symptoms. >89% of pts had no prior fungal infection. Statistical analysis of demographic characteristics to predict who would be at risk for abnormal CT findings identified a trend towards significance only in the auto cohort. Males were more likely to have abnormal abdominal findings than females (P=0.053), and the other race group was less likely to have abnormal sinus findings than Caucasians (P=0.038). For those with abnormal CT findings, the existence of a relationship between findings being 1) primary disease and non-infectious related (DR) and 2) infectious related and not related to the primary disease (DU) was investigated. For allo pts with abnormal chest/abdominal CTs, only diagnosis at enrollment showed a trend towards significant difference between those with DR findings and those with DU findings (P=0.046, chest; P=0.029, abdomen). For auto pts, age at HSCT showed a trend towards significant difference between those with DR chest abnormalities and DU findings (P=0.055) while diagnosis was significant for abdominal abnormalities (P=0.018). Conclusion: Based on these findings, routine CT imaging of the chest and abdomen may not be warranted in asymptomatic pts; this change would decrease patients' radiation exposure. Sinus imaging, which was frequently abnormal, may be justified to help plan post-HSCT supportive care.",

After the promising result of the pilot study (Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004. 34; 939) , phase II prospective multicenter clinical trial was performed with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus thymoglobulin conditioning regimen to allow good engraftment in unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for SAA and preliminary results are presented here. Ten patients underwent BMT with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -9, -8, -7 & -6), fludarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2 once daily i.v. on days -5, -4, -3 & -2) and thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -3, -2 & -1) from HLA matched unrelated donors. GVHD prophylaxis regimen was composed of cyclosporine, methotrexate (15 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. on day 1, 10 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. on days 3 and 6) and thymoglobulin (1.25 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days 7, 9 and 11). The median infused cell dose of nucleated cells and CD34 positive cells were 3.3x10 8 /kg (1.6-33.9x10 8 /kg) and 2.9x10 6 /kg (1.5-14.7x10 6 /kg), respectively. The median number of days required for ANC of more than 0.5x10 9 /l and 1.0x10 9 /l were 16.5 days (10-35 days) and 19 days (11-40 days), respectively. Complete donor type hematologic recovery was achieved in all patients. Five patient developed grade II-III acute GVHD resolved after treatment. Three patients died about 2 months after BMT owing to the coagulopathy, pneumonia, and cardiac infarction, respectively. All the other 7 patients are still alive with median 136 days. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus thymoglobulin conditioning allows for the promising result of good engraftment, although serious events occurred in some patients. More patients will be enrolled in this study to detect improvement of engraftment and survival rate than historical control in literatures.",

Between I/1994 and VII/2006 a total of 120 children with acute leukemia (ALL -79, AML -36 and acute hybrid leukemia; AHL -5) were transplanted at our unit. The median age at first SCT was 9,4 years (ranged 1,5 to 20,5). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (48), unrelated donors (63), matched family donors (3) or mismatched family donors (6). Eight grafts were T-cell depleted. EFS of this cohort is 57%, 18% died due to transplant related mortality (TRM), 13% died in a consequence of leukemia relapse. Post-transplant relapse following first allogeneic SCT was documented in 34 (28%) patients (23 ALL, 11 AML) 34 to 1091 days (median 191) after SCT. Intensive therapy of hematological relapse was initiated in 18 (53%) patients (11 ALL, 7 AML). Chemotherapy (CHT) was aplied to 10 patients (6 ALL, 4 AML), CHT combined with donor lymphocyte infusion in 4 ALL patients, gemtuzumab ozogamicin in 2 AML patients and dasatinib in one patient with Ph+ ALL. Additional local radiotherapy was applied in 2 patients with ocular and testicular relapse respectively, 1 patient underwent second SCT without previous CHT. Mixed chimerism was documented in peripheral blood samples using PCR of VNTR in 16 of 18 patients at the start of posttransplant relapse treatment. After the first line treatment 3 patients (ALL) died due to infectious complications and 5 patients (2 ALL, 3 AML) due to disease progression/further relapse. One patient treated for isolated testicular relapse of ALL is alive in further complete remission 13 months after diagnosis of post-transplant relapse and was not retransplanted. Nine patients underwent second allogeneic SCT using the same (8) or other (1) donor in hematological remission 10,5-39 months (median 16) after the first SCT, all of them again achieved complete donor chimerism before second transplantation. Three of 9 patients died due to TRM (1) or further relapse of leukemia (2). Six patients (2 ALL, 4 AML) are alive and well in continuous complete remission 4 to 113 months (median 22.5) after second SCT. In both surviving ALL patients minimal residual disease (MRD) was detectable prior to first SCT and they achieved MRD negativity before second transplantation. Intensive chemotherapy and retransplantation might be considered in patients in a good clinical status. Partially supported by VZ FNM MZ 000 64203 P472 Favourable long-term survival and low incidence of GvHD after transplantation of positive selected stem cells with T-cell add-backs from unrelated donors in children P. Lang (1) There is still a significant risk of GvHD in transplantation of peripheral stem cells from matched unrelated donors, despite the use of ATG and pharmacological prophylaxis. Especially in the case of young pediatric patients and adult donors, grafts with high numbers of stem cells but also with extreme amounts of T cells can be obtained. We present a current update of a clinical study with T cell reduced grafts in 22 patients, which offer both large stem cell numbers and clearly defined amounts of T cells. Positive selection of peripheral stem cells was done with CD34 or CD133 coated magnetic microbeads and the CliniMACS\u2122 device. Afterwards, an unselected aliquot containing 10x10 6 /kg T cells was added to the purified stem cells and infused on day 0, resulting in a median T cell depletion of 2 log. The diagnoses were: acute lymphatic leukemia (n=9; CR1=4, CR2=5), NHL (n=1) acute (n=5; CR1=1, CR2=4) and chronic myeloic leukemias (n=3), MDS (n=3) and Wiskott-Aldrich (n=1). Median age was 10 years (0.5-18). The donors were matched for HLA-A/B (medium resolution typing) and DRB1/DQB1 (high resolution). A short course of MTX (2-3x10 mg/m\u00b2) and CSA (2-3 mg/kg, adjusted to blood levels) until day 100 were given. 21/22 patients had primary engraftment with a median time to ANC >500 of 18 days (12-60). No G-CSF was given. One patient rejected his graft and was successfully retransplanted from another MUD. Platelet recovery was fast (median time to reach independence from substitution: 20 days). Mean numbers of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ on day 180 (365) were 259/\u00b5l (868/\u00b5l), 100/\u00b5l (400/\u00b5l) and 146/\u00b5l (456/\u00b5l). 19/22 patients had GvHD grade 0-I (86%), 1 and 2 patients had grade II and III, (5%, 10%) respectively. Chronic GvHD occurred in 2 patients (10%). 15/22 patients are alive with a median follow up of 3 years (1.5-5) . 3 year EFS was 64% (all patients), 50% (ALL/NHL) and 73% (myeloic leukemias /MDS). Relapse probability at 2 years was 25%, probability of TRM at 2 years was 15%. Causes of death were relapse (n=4) and infections (n=3). Thus, stable and favourable survival rates with a low incidence of GvHD were achieved. The method allows to administer clearly defined T cell numbers independent from the size of the grafts. This may be of advantage in particular in small children and if the donor does not accept a bone marrow harvest: all available stem cells can be infused without the limitation of unacceptable high T cell numbers. Objectives: Although survival rates of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increase in the last decades, the subgroup of patients with refractory acute leukemia (RAL) still have a very bad outcome. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains the therapy with the highest potential for cure. However, the rapid course of RAL often allows only limited time to identify an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor. Haploidentical family members are readily available. Based on the encouraging data obtained from adults in the HLAidentical setting (Schmid et al., Blood 2006) we adapted the FLAMSA-RIC protocol for haploidentical SCT in children with RAL. Methods: Five children (age 1.5-15 years) with RAL (2x ALL, 3x AML) received a SCT from their haplo-identical mothers. The three AML patients showed blasts in the bone marrow (BM) at the time of SCT, one ALL patient was in aplasia, one was in cytological remission. Conditioning consisted of high dose cytosine arabinoside, amsacrine and fludarabine (FLAMSA), followed by total body irradiation with 4 Gy (age >2 years) or half doses of i.v. busulfan (<2 years), followed by cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin. The recipients receive unmanipulated BM on day 0 and CD6-depleted peripheral blood stem cells at day 6. Cyclosporine A and methotrexate were given in standard doses for graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Results: Conditioning was well tolerated. All patients showed stable engraftment (d+19 -+38). Four of five showed a full donor chimerism on d+30 in the BM, in three of them full chimerism still remains. Three patients developed acute GvHD I-II, two patients suffered from extended chronic GvHD. All episodes of GvHD respond to immunsuppressive treatment. Further complications consisted of Adenovirus and Introduction and methods: Incidence, chacteristics and outcome of stem cell transplant (SCT) pediatric patients requiring intensive care was studied retrospectively in a teaching hospital for infectious diseases. Results: Pediatric stem cell transplantation was performed in 182 children in our institution between 1992 and 2006. Several patients required more than one SCT (n=192). From the 182 pediatric patients with SCT, 40 patients (22%) had 54 admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Mean age of the 24 boys and 16 girls was 85 \u00b1 64 (median= 66) months. Mean PRISM-score on admission was 7\u00b16 (median= 6). Overall mortality was 21/40 (52,5 %). The most frequent reasons for PICU admission were pulmonary complications 30/54 (55,5%), hemodinamic failure 4/54 (7,5%), neurologic disease 8/54 (15%) and other 12/54 (22%). Distribution according to days from SCT to admission in PICU was: 10/54 (0-30 days), 14/54 (31-100 days), 30/54 (>100 days). Mechanical ventilation (MV) was required in 27 of the 54 admissions (50 %). Mortality in patients requiring MV and not requiring MV was 19/25 (76%) and 2/15 (13 %), respectively. Acut respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed in 14 patients with a mortality rate 11/14 (78%). Twenty-seven patients had multiorgan failure (MOF) involving 3 or more organs. Sepsis was proven in 20/54 cases (37% of all admissions) with a high mortality rate (80%). Distribution of 20 patients according to graft versus host disease (GVHD) was 9/20 Grad III-IV and 11/20 Grad I-II. Discussion: Mortality rate was high in patients with sepsis, ARDS, MOF and in mechanically ventilated children. Our results indicate that in case of life-threatening complications, requirement for PICU support is indicated in SCT children, because the overall survival was 46% and 24% in ventilated patients.",

Darbyshire Birmingham Children's Hospital (Birmingham, UK) Malignant infantile osteopetrosis (MIOP) is a lethal disorder of osteoclast dysfunction. Haematopoietic stem transplantation is the only curative treatment currently available. The best results are seen with a fully matched sibling donor; however the use of alternate donors is being explored. Early allografting is essential in order to minimise permanent neurosensory deficit. We studied 5 children with MIOP who underwent 8 allograft procedures in our unit in 3 years. The mean age was 18 months (2-53 months). Donors were matched sibling (n=1), unrelated cord (n=2) and haploidentical parent (n=5). The mean CD34 dose was 8.4X106/kg and a dose of 10X106/kg was achieved with all haploidentical grafts. Common conditioning regimes were used. Haploidentical grafts were T cell depleted and patients received serotherapy (ALG in 4 and OKT3 in 1). Cyclosporine was used for graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis in all cases. Neutrophil engraftment was seen at a mean of 15 days (range 11-20 days) and platelet engraftment at a mean of 49 days (range 12-60 days). 3 episodes of primary graft rejection occurred in 2 patients. Both these patients engrafted successfully after a haploidentical parent was used. 3 patients showed complete chimerism (CC) at day 28 and this has persisted. 2 patients that showed increasing mixed chimerism (i-MC) were treated with escalating doses of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) with fludarabine. This resulted in CC in one patient and stable mixed chimerism in the other. 4 patients developed grade 2 acute skin GvHD (2 post-DLI), 1 patient developed chronic skin GvHD. Clinical improvement or stabilisation was seen in 4 patients. Disease progression occurred in 1 patient in spite of CC. There was no transplant related mortality. 1 patient developed acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura which needed immunoglobulin therapy. Hypercalcemia needing pamidronate therapy was seen in 1 patient. Both have resolved. We have shown that the use of alternate stem cell donors, especially haploidentical parents, in the absence of a fully matched sibling donor, is a safe, readily available and effective transplant option that is likely to improve the outcome in children with malignant osteopetrosis.",

Enhancement of neutrophils recovery and peripheral blood progenitor cells mobilization S. Dallorso (1) Children's Hospital (Turin, I) Objectives: to evaluate efficacy of peg-filgrastim (PEG), administrated after chemotherapy, in enhancing neutrophils recovery and peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) mobilization, in children suffering from malignant tumours. Methods: From August 2005 to October 2006 25 children received at least 1 dose of PEG and were assessable. Diagnosis were Neuroblastoma (10), bone (8), brain (3) and renal tumours (2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hepatoblastoma. Inclusion criteria were: age < 18 years, diagnosis of high-risk solid tumour or non-Hodgkin lymphoma without marrow involvement, myelosuppressive treatment, Karnofsky status > 50 and adequate renal, hepatic and cardiac function. A single subcutaneous injection of PEG, at dose of 100 mcg/kg, was given 3 days after the end of chemotherapy. Primary endpoint: duration of grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophils count (ANC) < 0.5 x 10 9 /L). Secondary endpoints: incidence and characteristics of febrile neutropenia (FN), myeloid recovery (ANC > 0.5 x 10 9 /L), characteristics of PBPC mobilization (days from CD34 + cells raise until their fall <20 CD34+ cells/microL (threshold level for collection) and of PBPC harvest (CD34+ cells x 10 6 /kg/apheresis). Chemotherapy before PEG was: Cyclo and Etoposide alone or in combination, IVADO (Ifo+VCR+Doxo+Act-D), Ifo+ Carbo+ Etoposide, Topotecan+ VCR+ Doxo. Results: All patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia, lasting a median of 5 days. Only 2 patients complained about mild bone pain responsive to paracetamol. Myeloid recovery occurred at a median of 6 days (range 4-9) from PEG administration. Threshold CD34+ cells level for PBPC collection was reached in 14 out of 20 children in whom CD34 was monitored (median value 147/microL, range 20-421) and lasted for a median of 6 days (range 4-9). 12 children, candidate to autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) were able to collect more than 4 x 10 6 /kg CD 34+ cells. In 10 cases only one apheresis was performed. Conclusions: PEG can be safely administered in children, myeloid recovery is similar to that seen with filgrastim, PBPC mobilization was possible in 70% of attempts. Failures were observed in patients older than 10 years, heavily pre-treated S81 or with previous spinal radiotherapy. A collection window wider than that usually observed with filgrastim was often observed. A prospective randomized comparative study is then needed and it is in progress at our Institutions.",

Chybicka Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) The aim of the study was to analyze outcome in heavily pretransfused children with SAA undergoing allogeneic HSCT after conditioning containing treosulfan, cyclophosphamide and ATG in comparison with pts conditioned without treosulfan. Twelve pts (Group 1) with median age 10.8 years (range 4.5-17.8), median interval between dgn and HSCT 705 days (range 75-4968) underwent allogeneic HSCT from unrelated donors (UD, 10 pts) or from matched sibling donors (MSD, 2 pts) after conditioning regimen consisted of TREO 30g/m\u00b2, CY 120 mg/kg and ATG-Fresenius 30mg/kg. All pts but one received an immunosuppressive treatment before HSCT and all were transfusion-dependent. Source of SC was PB in 9 pts with median of CD 34+ cells 13.7 x10( 6 )/kg and BM in 3 pts with median of CD 34+ cells 2.3 x10 6 /kg. Thirteen pts (Group 2) with median age 12.8 years (range 1.6-20), with shorter median interval between dgn and HSCT 173 days (range 30-1338) underwent allogeneic HSCT from UD (4 pts), MSD (8 pts) and from HLA-mismatched relative (1pt) after conditioning regimen consisting of : CY 120 and ATG (9 pts), CY 120, FLU 120, ATG or Campath (3pts) and BU 16, FLU 120, CY 120 and ATG (1pt). All pts but six received an immunosuppressive treatment before HSCT and all were transfusion-dependent. Source of SC was PB (4 pts) with median of CD 34+ cells 5.3 x10 6 /kg and BM (9 pts) with median of CD 34+ cells 1.3 x10 6 /kg. In the Group 1 no graft failure occurred. Engraftment with ANC (>500/ul) and platelet (>50 000/mcl) occurred at a median of 16 days (range 14-25) and 21 days (range 12-37), respectively. Two pts died before engraftment because of sepsis and cerebral edema, respectively. With a median follow-up of 522 days (range 48-841) 8/12 pts survived with complete chimerism (CC) in 5 cases or mixed chimerism (MC) in 3 cases. Two further pts died due to TTP and cerebral haemorrhage, respectively. In the Group 2 all pts but one engrafted with neutrophil and platelet recovery occurring at a median of 16 days (range 11-24) and 32 days (range 14-960), respectively. With a median follow-up of 1837 days (range 813-2949) 8/13 pts survived with CC in 1 case or MC in 7 cases. 2 pts required a second HSCT from the same donor because of graft rejection, 2 pts relapsed. 5 pts died due to TRM.

Brault (1), The classical schema of Peripheral Stem Cell (PSC) mobilization [chemotherapy (CT)+ GCSF or GCSF in steady state] are efficient to collect frequently a sufficient number of CD34+ cells to administer high dose chemotherapy (CT). However there is a low fraction of patients (pts) who are \"poor mobilizer\". We report the results of the combination of Stem Cell Factor (SCF) S/C at 20 \u00b5g/kg/d with GCSF (5 or 10 \u00b5g/kg/d) used in Onco-Pediatric patients in this special context. Patients: Between 11/2000 and 08/2006, 32 children, median age=14,2 years [range: 1,1-22,2] , with high risk solid tumor (neuroblastoma=8, ewing-PNET=6, rhabdomyosarcoma=4, medulloblastoma=3, nephroblastoma=2, osteosarcoma=2, others solid tumors=3) or lymphoma (Hodgkin Disease=3, Burkitt type=1), with a mean of 2 [1] [2] [3] mobilization failure were treated with SCF+GCSF in steady state (30 mobilizations) or after chemotherapy (4 mobilizations). 2 pts were twice mobilized with this association. Median number of prior chemotherapy cycles was 7 . The SCF was administered during hospitalization after a medical treatment combining Cetirizine, Ranitidine and Salbutamol. Results: No serious anaphylactic effect due to SCF was observed. After a mean delay of 4 [3-7] days for the pts mobilized in steady state and 15 days for the pts mobilized by CT, 44 leukapheresis were performed among 23/32 pts with a mean of 2 [1] [2] [3] [4] leukapheresis by pt. Harvest allows 2, 83 [0, [5] [6] [7] 27] x 10 6 CD34+/kg and 29,41 [6, x 10 4 CFUGM/kg per child. The correlation CD34+/CFUGM (10,3) was adequat. The number of circulating CD34+ cells is higher at d5 [22(9-40)/\u00b5l] for the pts collected in steady state. 14/32 pts had a PSC collection > 2,5 x 10 6 CD34+/kg. Other hematopoietic stem cell collection was necessary in 9 cases (bone marrow=4). 21/32 pts received at least 1 [1] [2] [3] intensive treatment with autologous PSC alone or with bone marrow transplantation. Conclusion: With non toxicity, the combination of SCF+GCSF is efficient to collect PSC in 72% of poor mobilizer oncopediatric pts, allowing a collection of more than 2,5 x 10 6 CD34+/kg among 44% of them.",

Using the principle of the Kleihauer test which relies on the acid resistance of foetal cells we postulated that this represented Hb F red cells within the peripheral blood. In this paper we document the Hb F output of engrafted cord blood transplant recipients. Hb F levels were determined by flow cytometry in 4 patients undergoing cord transplantation, minimum follow up time was 6 months. These 4 patients have been transplanted for metabolic disorders, unlike the majority of case reports reporting Hb F levels have been based on patients transplanted for red cell disorders. The results show mean levels of Hb F at 3 months of 50%, and at 6 months levels of 24%. Peak levels occurred at 116 days post transplant. 3 patients achieved full chimeric status, and achieved HbF levels of 50, 43, and 83 at 3 months, whilst the patient who achieved chimerism of 40%, HbF levels at 3 months of 22%.",

Sung, H.L. Jung, H.K. Park, H.A. Kim, H.H. Koo Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, KOR) The number of total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34+ cells has been a commonly used standard to predict engraftment after cord blood transplantation (CBT). Although colony forming units-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) is a representative for clonogenic potential, no study has clearly documented the clinical impact of post-thaw CFU-GM on engraftment in human subjects after CBT. To investigate the clinical relevance of CFU-GM in CBT for pediatric patients, we performed CFU-GM assay using post-thaw cord blood samples along with the counts of TNC, CD34+ cells, and CD3+ cells. A total of 71 cord blood units prepared for 53 recipients (double unit transplant in 18 patients) were evaluated after thawing. At least 4/6 matched units were selected for transplantation. Except for 4 patients with marrow failure such as aplastic or Fanconi anemia, patients were conditioned with a myeloablative regimen. The infused cell dose per kg of recipient weight was as follows: CFU-GM 1.64\u00b11.83x10 5 , TNC 5.15\u00b12.50x10 7 , CD34+ 1.93\u00b11.52x10 5 , and CD3+ 1.06\u00b10.96x10 7 . Among the 4 parameters of cell dose, CFU-GM and CD34+ counts were significantly lower in those who failed to show donor-derived hematopoiesis (P=0.028 and 0.005, respectively). CFU-GM, TNC, and CD34+ counts were well correlated to engraftment of donorderived neutrophils (P=0.004, 0.037 and 0.004, respectively), whereas only CFU-GM showed a significant correlation to platelet engraftment (r=-0.385, P=0.024). In double unit transplants, CFU-GM count was the only significant variable predicting engraftment of predominating unit among the cell dose parameters (P=0.006). We conclude that post-thaw CFU-GM is a reliable predictor of predominating unit as well as of rapid engraftment after CBT. It would be beneficial to perform CFU-GM assay for several candidate cord blood units in advance if the cord blood bank could provide small aliquots of cryopreserved samples before CBT to avoid selecting the unit that might possess a low clonogenic potential.",

Ilari, M.A. De Ioris, R. Pessolano, A. Castellano, A. Serra, A. Jenkner, L. De Sio, R. Cozza, P. Fidani, C. De Laurentis, A. Donfrancesco Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9 IRCCS (Rome, I) Objective: to asses efficacy and safety of high dose chemotherapy (HDC) with Thiotepa (TT), Cyclophosphamide (CPM) and Etopside (VP16) followed by hematopoietic stemcell-rescue in high risk Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors (ESFT) paediatric patients. Methods: from November 1998 to March 2006, 17 pts ( M/F 7/10) with high risk ESFT were included in our study. Patients were considered high risk if they had one of the following risk factors: tumor volume > 200 ml, a poor prognosis tumor site (pelvis, chest wall, vertebra) or metastasis. treated with high dose TT (750 mg/m\u00b2), CPM (60 mg/kg), VP16 (600 mg/m\u00b2) (ETC conditioning regimen) followed by autologous stem-cellrescue. Median age at diagnosis and at transplantation was 6,9 yr (range 1-13 yr) and 7,6 yr (range 1,6-13,7 yr) respectively. Primary tumour was localised in extremities (6), pelvis (3), paravetebral (3), chest wall (3), abdomen (1), and skull (1) . Metastatic disease was detected in 6 pts: lung metastasis alone in 4 cases; lung, bone marrow infiltration and brain localisation in one and diffuse bone marrow infiltration in another one. Before HDC all pts received 7 courses of induction chemotherapy based on Ifosfamide, VP16, Carboplatin, CPM, Adriamicine, Vincristine. Surgery was performed in 12 pts. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 10 pts and partial response (PR) in 7 pts. Three of 6 metastatic pts were in CR after conventional chemotherapy and surgery. Results: Toxicity, evaluated according to Bearman classification, was mainly haematological. Median absolute neutrophil count recovery > 500/mm\u00b3 was at day 10+ (range 6-27). Median platelet recovery > 50000/mm\u00b3 was at day 19 + (range 9-114). Oral mucositis was reported in 11 pts: grade II in 9 and grade III in 2. Diarrhoea grade I was reported in 1 pt and grade II in 2 pts. No HDC related death occurred. At a median overall survival from diagnosis of 43 months (16-104 months) 11 pts are alive in CR, 1 pt is alive in PR and 5 pts are died for recurrence after HDC. Relapsed occurred at a median of 7,5 months (range 3,4-11) from HDC. Kaplan Meier 5 yr OS and PFS was 65% in all population and respectively Kaplan-Meier 5yr OS was 78% in non-metastatic pts and 45% in metastatic pts. Conclusions: preliminary evaluation shows feasibility of HDC with ETC conditioning regimen in the high risk ESFT pts treatment with promising results in term of survival and acceptable toxicity. Further study warrants to evaluate response rate of ETC HDC.",

Abrahamsson (2) (1)Gothenburg University (Gothenburg, S); (2)The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital (Gothenburg, S) Aim of the study: To determine the correlation between increased mixed chimerism (IMC) in T-, B-and myeloid (M) cells and immuno-reconstitution after paediatric stem cell transplantation (SCT). Material and Methods: Forty-six consecutive children with malignant and non-malignant disorders underwent 51 SCT during 2000 -2006. The patients were followed for 24 months after SCT. Chimerism was analyzed by PCR analysis of short tandem repeats on separated T, B and myeloid cells. IMC was defined as an increase of recipient DNA >10% above the lowest value after SCT in any cell-line at >2 consecutive samples. Lymphocyte subsets were analysed by flow cytometry and the proliferative response of lymphocytes after PHA or ConA stimulation was measured. T cell excision circles (TREC) were determined by PCR. All patients were investigated before transplantation and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after. Results: IMC was present in 11 SCT. The regeneration of lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD3+4+, CD3+8+, CD4+45RA+, CD4+45RO+ , CD8+45RA+, CD8+45RO+ and CD19+) was not significantly different in patients with or without IMC. Response to PHA or ConA and level of TREC were also similar in both groups. After 24 months 50% of patients still had subnormal levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Conclusion: In this single centre material the presence of IMC did not correlate with delayed immuno-reconstitution. This finding needs to be substantiated in a larger material. Furthermore, two years after SCT, half of the patients still had T cell dysfunction.",

Kowalczyk Children's University Hospital (Lublin, PL) The second stem cell transplantation is burdened with high risk complication, however it is the only treatment option for some patients. Patients: From1999 to 2006 in our BMT unit 162 children have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): 83-autologous (auto SCT) and 79-allogeneic (alloSCT). In 2 patients after auto SCT second autologous procedure was performed. 8 children were transplanted twice from allogeneic donors (3-sibling, 5-unrelated) and in all those patients in both procedures the donors were the same. The overall number of patients subjected retransplatation in our Unit was 10 (6,1%), aged from 5 months to 18 years (median 8,5 years).Among those children 5 suffered from malignancies (AML-1, sAML-1, ALL-1, NHL-2) while 5 had nonmalignant diseases (SAA-3, S.Omenn-1, S. Wiscott Aldrich-1). Indication for second SCT in the group with malignancies was relapse, and in group of patients with nonmalignant diseases -was rejection or graft failure. The interval between first and second transplantation range from 1 to 29 months (median 12,5 months). At the moment of second SCT 4 children with malignancies were in CR (3 in CR2, 1 in CR3), and one child was in partial remission (PR). Conditioning before second SCT was myeloablative in 3 procedures, reduce intensivity (RIC) in 5 and 2 children (SAA) received ATG only as preparative regime. Results: 9/10 patients engrafted. 4/5 children retransplanted due to relapse are alive and are still in remission, with observation time from 6 to 74 months (median 30 months). Among 5 children with nonmalignant diseases 4 are alive: 3 with complete hematopoietic recovery and 1 with twolineage hematopoetic recovery. The most serious complications were: posttransplant limfoproliferative disease (PLTD-2 patients), and GvHD (III0 -1, IV0-1). The other transplantation-related complications (infection, organ toxicity) were mild. 2 children died (20%): 1 due to GvHD IV0 and 1 due to PLTD. Conclusions: Our results suggest, that second SCT may be considered as therapeutic option for patients with relapse or graft failure. The choice of preparative regimen should be made individually, depending on the patient condition, diseases status and previous treatment. Transplant-related toxicity and mortality in our group of patients are acceptable, which may be granted nonmyeloablative conditioning in 70% of the all procedures. Long term observation is needed for better evaluation of second SCT results.",

Koscinska (1) , B. Wysoczanska (2), A. Lange (1) (1)Lower Silesian Center for Cellular Transplantation (Wroclaw, PL); (2)L.Hirszfeld Institute (Wroclaw, PL) Twenty five immunodeficiency children SCID (13) and non-SCID (12) were transplanted in our BMT unit. Five, 7 and 13 children were transplanted from sibling, haploidentical and unrelated donors, respectively. In 3, 10 and 12 cases the transplantation procedure resulted in autologous reconstitution (AR), mixed chimerism (MC) and complete chimerism (CC), respectively. In haploidentical transplants CD3+ cells were only partially removed with the use of counter-flow centrifugal elutriation. T cells were also present (add-back) in one out of 2 transplant materials obtained by positive selection of CD34+ cells. Chimerism post transplant (detected with the use of informative gene STR alleles detection) was analyzed in association with the presence of KIR ligands and KIR genes (Olerup-SSP Kit) in donors and recipients. HLA-C typing was performed by PCR-SSP at the high resolution level. HLA-C specificities were divided into C1 and C2 subgroups according the published literature data. Association between the level of chimerism and the presence of C1 and C2 specificities, and number of the presence of activatory KIR genes in donor was analyzed. It was found that: (i) Complete chimerism was more frequent in patients transplanted with donors carrying more than one activatory KIR genes (9/11 vs 4/10, p=0,09) (ii) The presence of more than one activatory KIR genes in donors and/or a lack in recipient C1 or C2 specificity present in a donor favored occurrence of complete chimerism after HSCT (11/12 vs 4/10, p=0,015). Conclusions: mixed chimerism post HSCT was more frequent in children receiving transplant from donors having only one 2DS4 gene. Therefore the activation of activatory KIR favors graft vs host reactivity. The hypothesis that NK cells play a role in this reactivity was further supported by the finding that a lack of C1 or C2 specificity in recipients which were present in the donors also favored complete chimerism.

Fagioli Regina Margherita Children Hospital (Turin, I) Objectives: To collect, process and transplant haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) there are standardized procedures. These require specific haematological and laboratory knowledge and firm quality controls applied to all processes from cell manipulation up to patient infusion, in order to guarantee both safety and clinical efficacy. Therefore, quality assurance is a high interest topic at all levels of HSC transplantation. The implementation of a Quality Management System (QMS), according to ISO9001 and JACIE Standards arises from the necessity to optimise the quality our Paediatric HSC Transplantation Programme provides in a general context of improving health care quality, and to reach a high level of practice in accordance with agreed standards of excellence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of our QMS on the quality of the clinical activities one year on from implementation. Methods: In order to assess the QMS of our Paediatric autologous and allogeneic HSC Transplantation Programme, we established an integrated team from the Clinical and the Processing Units (under the HSC Transplantation Unit), and the Aphaeresis Unit of Transfusion Medicine Service, coordinated by the Programme Director. Each unit had previously followed independent approaches to draw up Quality Manuals (QMs) according to ISO9001 standards. In addition to those QMs, in order to comply with JACIE Standards, we organized detailed Standard Operating Procedure manuals, containing written policies and procedures addressing collection, processing and clinical activities. All personnel had been involved in common training meetings and in the drawing up of the documents. The impact of quality parameters on HSC transplantation was assessed by evaluating process indicators. Results: Our integrated Transplantation Programme applied for JACIE accreditation in February 2005 and, after the December 2005 on-site inspection, obtained JACIE Accreditation in August 2006. An analysis of 2005 outcome indicators revealed an improvement of process performance compared to 2004, and the joint discussion between the three units of common indicators led to advances in our QMS. Conclusions: The good grounding of ISO9001 QMS, the joint efforts of the integrated team towards JACIE implementation, and the involvement of all personnel have been fundamental for the improvement of clinical activity of our Transplantation Programme in the context of JACIE Accreditation.",

Patients and Methods: Between January 2003 and October 2006,104 pediatric patients received allogenic HSCT at KHCC.Nine patients(8.6%)developed clinical and radiological features consistent with Pres. Results: The median age of the affected patients was 7 years,6 were males & 3 females. Tow third of the patients had non-malignant diseases;Thalassemia(n=3),Aplastic Anemia(n=1),Fanconi Anemia(n=1)and Sickle Cell Anemia (n=1),while one third had malignant disorders;Acute Leukemia (n=2)and MDS/AML (n=1).Eight patients received myeloablative conditioning while one patient received nonmyeloablative conditioning prior to HSCT. PRES occurred at a median of 91 days(range, 23 -114 days).All patients developed visual disturbances, head ache,seizure and elevation of blood pressure.All patients were receiving Calcineurines at the time PRES occurred(8 patients received cyclosporine and one patient received FK-506).Also all patients were receiving steroid at more than 1mg/kg for GvHD at the time of PRES.MRI showed abnormalities in all patients including occipital lobe involvement in all patients,the parietal lobe was involved in 7 patients,temporal lobe in 6 patients,frontal lobe in 4 patients,periventricular in 2 patients,brain stem in 1 patient and cerebullar lobes in1 patient.Eight(89%)patients had changes that were symmetrical and about half of the cases demonstrated variable degree of enhancement.Complete resolution of radiological findings was observed in 7 out of 8 patients within a median period of 39 days.After a median follow up of 16 months(2.5-20 months),all patients survived except the patient who had partial radiological remission;experienced relapse of PRES after 5.5 months with deterioration of neurological status that led to death. Conclusion: PRES is a relatively frequent complication of pediatric allogenic HSCT.It appears that the incidence of PRES following HSCT for non-malignant disorder is high. Concomitant administration of steroid and calcineurines seems to be an important risk factor for the development of PRES. Patients with noncomplete radiological remission should be followed up for the possibility of relapse.",

Bertrand Debrousse Hospital (Lyon, F) Although IV form of busulfan seems to allow to achieve a safe and efficient systemic exposure, young children less than 9 kg might present over or under dosage with the recommended regimen (i.e. 1 mg/kg/dose), both with oral or IV form. To evaluate which dosage regimen was necessary to achieve target AUC, 19 patients, weighting between 3.9 and 8.5 kg and receiving busulfan (IV : 4, oral : 15) with BU Bayesian individualization of dosage regimens were enrolled. Mean total dose was 15.3 mg/kg but with very large range (8,7 -24,5 mg/kg). Thirty seven percent of patients received a higher dose than 16 mg/kg while 53 % received a lower one. Incidence of VOD was 26.3%. Patients with VOD received doses of busulfan varying from 10.2 to 24.5 mg/kg and AUC values were all in the target range (971 to 1164 \u00b5M.min). Incidence of mixed engraftment <95% donor was 42%. Mean AUC reached in patients with complete engraftment was not different from those of patients with mixed chimerism. Significant linear relationship was found between the estimated dose per 6 hour dosing interval necessary to reach a target AUC value of 4 \u00b5g.h.ml-1 and body weight (p< 0.001). The optimal doses of busulfan per 6 hour dosing interval should be: 0.8 mg/kg for BW between 4 and 6 kg, 0.9 mg/kg for BW between 6 and 8 kg, and 1.0 mg/kg for BW around 9 kg.",

Salmon (1) , A. Babin-Boilletot (2) (1)CHU Nancy H\u00f4pital d'Enfants France (Vandoeuvre les Nancy, F); (2)CHU Haute Pierre (Strasbourg, F) In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), disease free survival (DFS) is quite low for children after a relapse. These patients should be considered as candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In France, children with ALL relapse between April 1997 and November 2002 were included in Cooprall protocol, 173 children in group G2 (early extramedullar relapse in ALL high risk, isolated marrow relapse or combined in ALL HR, in T ALL, and isolated marrow relapse or combined in B ALL six months after the end of treatment). Once the second remission obtained and the avaibility of a donor, the allograft was performed.128 B ALL, 40 T ALL, 5 ALL (no clearly defined) were included. The average time between the first complete remission and the relapse is 21.9 months (1.8 months-7.3 years). Second or subsequent complete remission was obtained for 130 children (75%). 5 of them received an autograft, all died (4 relapse, 1 toxicity); 3 lost sight of the fact. For 30 children, allogeneic BMT was not possible (early relapse or/and no donor available). 92 children received an allogeneic BMT: 33 HLA matched related donor (MRD), 2 HLA mismatched related donor (MMRD) and 57 matched unrelated donor (MUD) including 21 cord blood (CB), 33 bone marrow (BM), 3 peripheric stem cell (CSP). The 92 conditioning regimens were myeloablativ: total body irradiation-aracytine-melphalan was the most used. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis varied over years and teams: methotrexate and cyclosporine A was the most frequent (n=38). The cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) at J100 was 3% for MRD BMT; 14% for MUD CB transplantation; 19% for MUD (BM and CSP). Relapse occurred in 31 patients (9 MRD, 9 CB, 13 BMT). The 2 patients (MMRD) are still alive without GVHD. Acute GVHD (d II) and chronic GHVD developed respectively in 46.6 %, 21% for MRD BMT, 31.5%, 9% for MUD CB transplantation and 63.3%, 2.7% for MUD BMT. Overall survival was 40%. DFS was 41%. The cumulative estimate for relapse after BMT was 38%. Actually, TRM seems to be lower than 5-10 years before. If MRD is not available, MUD or CB should be considered for paediatrics patients with high risk ALL.",

Grund (1) As demonstrated previously in children not eligible for conventional myeloablative conditioning, the treosulfan (TREO) based preparative regimen for allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) demonstrates almost exclusively mucosal toxicity, along with sufficient myeloablative and antileukemic effects (Wachowiak et al., 2005) . However, until now infectious complications in this group of patients were not analysed. Between 2000-2005 total of 51 children, including 42 with hematological malignancies and 9 with congenital disorders underwent allo-HSCT after conditioning with TREO-based regimen. Out of 42 patients (pts) with usually advanced hematological malignances 19 obtained HSCT from MSD, and 23 from MUD. Among 9 pts with congenital diseases 5 were transplanted from MSD, and 4 from MUD. As preparative regimen TREO (3x10-14 g/m\u00b2) was given i.v. in various combination with other cytostatics according to diagnosis, risk factors of regimen related toxicity and/or regimen used for first HSCT. Prior MUD-HSCT and in all pts with congenital disorders ATG (n=27) or Campath (n=4) was given. GvHD prophylaxis usually consisted of cyclosporine CsA+MTX (n=24) or CsA (n=18). Prior HSCT in 16 (31.4%) pts infections with high risk of reactivation or progression occurred. One child was conditioned and transplanted in course of pneumonia. By day +100 in 42 pts with malignancy 38 infections were documented, including 22 viral (52%), 10 bacterial (24%), and 5 fungal (12%). FUO was observed in 5 (12%) pts. One (2.4%) early infection-related death occurred in patient, who after MUD-HSCT developed ADV infection with multiorgan failure (day +66). In addition 2 (5%) pts died late after MUD-HSCT in course of chronic GvHD due to fungal infection (day +634 and +865). By day +100 among 9 pts with congenital disorders 8 (89%) demonstrated 13 episodes of infection, including 6 viral (46%), 6 bacterial (46%), and one fungal (8%). In pts transplanted for congenital disorders neither early nor late infection-related death occured. All-in, out of 51 pts studied 3 (5.9%) died in result of infectious complication. Conclusions: Profile, incidence and timing of infections observed in children conditioned for allo-HSCT with TREO-based regimen were comparable to those observed after conventional regimens. Despite of high risk of transplant relate complications the rate of fatal infections in studied group of children was low, both in early and late post HSCT period. Supported by grant 2PO5E04829",

Kawano, K. Tabuchi, S. Kato for the HSCT Committee of Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology An oral preparation of busulfan (BU) has been widely used in Japan as a part of a conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before the quite recent introduction of an intravenous preparation of BU. To characterize the potential advantages/disadvantages of this medication in pediatric patients, we retrospectively analyzed the database of the Japan Pediatric HSCT Registry to compare outcomes after HSCT with those following a regimen containing oral BU (16 mg/kg) and total bodyirradiation TBI (=>12Gy), particularly focusing on engraftment and the occurrence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Between Jan 2000 and Dec 2004, 195 children (122 male and 73 female) were treated with a BU-containing regimen. Their diseases were ALL (n=41), AML (51), MDS (30), CML (12), and others (31). The median age of the patients was 5 years (range, 3 mo-15y). As a control group, 622 children (median age, 8 years; range, 8mo-15y) who underwent HSCT with a TBI-containing regimen were also analyzed. Their diseases were ALL (n=385), AML (130), CML (21), MDS (37), and others (49). Patients who received any fludarabine-or other iradiation-containing regimens were excluded from the study. As a result, in HLA-matched allogeneic transplantation, the graft engraftment rate was 94.3% and 95.8%, in BU-and TBIcontaining regimens, respectively, and this difference was not statistically significant. In HLA-mismatched transplantation, there was no significant difference (p=0.1459) between BU-(79.6%) and TBI-containing regimens (87.3%). For the analysis of VOD, 141 cases with the BU-regimen and 444 with the TBI regimen were eligible. The incidence of VOD was significantly higher in BU-(10.6%) than in TBI-regimen (4.7 %, p=0.018), and this was due to the high rate (23.5%) of VOD in mismatched cases with BU-regimen. There was no significant difference in the day +100 survival rates (72.2 % and 70.4%, respectively). In conclusion, conditioning with an oral BU-containing regimen does not seem to carry a significant risk of engraftment failure or the occurrence of VOD due to variable plasma concentrations of the drug compared to a TBI-regimen in HLAmatched transplantation, but such associations were confirmed in mismatched transplantation. This may suggest that oral BU should not be used in this clinical setting.",

S\u00e1nchez de Toledo Hospital Infantil Vall d'Hebon (Barcelona, E) Hurler Syndrome, an inborn error of metabolism due to deficiency of a-L-iduronidase enzyme, produces accumulation of heparin and dermatan sulphates, causing hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, cardiomyopathy and progressive neurologic deterioration, generally leading to death before the age of 8. HCT can improve the clinical course. Eight patients with Hurler Syndrome (4 boys/ 4 girls), who received a HCT, median age at diagnosis 10m (6m-5y) with severe phenotype in 6 and moderate in 2 are presented. Three received enzyme replacement therapy prior to transplant. Median age at transplant was 26m (17m-10a). Four patients received an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow donor transplant (ISDT) and 4 an unrelated donor transplant (UDT) (2 BM/2 UCB). Conditioning regimen consisted of BU 16-20 mg/kg and CY 200 mg/kg in ISDT and BU+CY+ATG or TNI 6 Gy in UDT. GVHD prophylaxis in BMT consisted of CyA+MTX and, in UCBT CyA+prednisone. All patients engrafted except one who died from disease progression. Five patients presented grade I GVHD and 2 grade II. None of the patients developed chronic GVHD. Seven patients are alive with complete donor chimerism and normal a-L-iduronidase levels or levels comparable to those of the donor. Visceromegalies present in 4 patients remitted. Cardiomyopathy present in 3 patients improved. Skeletal abnormalities failed to improve in all cases. Neurologic development in patients transplanted before the age of 2 was normal. In patients transplanted between the ages of 2 and 3, neurologic damage did not progress. Finally, two patients with a moderate phenotype transplanted at the ages of 5 and 10, respectively, did not later develop severe neurologic damage. Patients with Hurler Syndrome undergoing HCT have prolonged survival and, if it is performed early , do not present neurologic deterioration.

Aytac, S. Yalcin, O. Kucukbayrak, M. Cetin, M. Tuncer, I. Tezcan, D. Uckan Hacettepe University (Ankara, TR) Objective: Study reports show that immune reconstitution takes longer time in malignant diseases when compared to non-malignant disorders and immune deficiencies after bone marrow transplantation. We aimed to determine immune reconstitution on the basis of lymphocyte subpopulations of our patients and retrospectively studied them in a group of 73 children after bone marrow transplantation. Method: Absolute CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8, CD3, CD19, CD3+NK, NK, CD3/DR, HLA-DR subsets of 73 patients were evaluated at +1, +3 and +6 months of transplantation. The underlying disease was a malignant disease in 27, nonmalignant in 32 and an immune deficiency disorder in 14 patients. The latter group of patients were excluded from the study, as they were not given conditioning regimen because of their underlying disease. In the study group (n=59) there were 34 boys and 25 girls, ages ranging from 6 months to 20 years (median 7). BuCy or CyTBI (with or without etoposide, melphalan or ATG) was the conditioning regimen in 49 patients, while 10 patients were treated with reduced intensity therapy. The donors were HLA 6/6 matched family member in 55 patients and 1-3 antigen mismatched related donor in 4. The mean engrafment days for WBC and platelets were 22,95\u00b118,17 and 29,40\u00b116,18 days. Results: There were no significant differences in the absolute CD4, CD8, CD3, CD19, CD3+NK, NK, CD3/DR, HLA-DR levels or CD4/8 ratio after bone marrow transplantation between malignant and non-malignant patients` groups during the follow-up period (p>0,05). In addition, the relapse rate among patients with malignant diseases did not show any correlation with absolute numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations or the CD4/CD8 ratios. Conclusion: In this pediatric group of patients the kinetics of immune reconstitution was comparable between those with malignant or non-malignant disease. In previous studies the delayed reconstitution in malignant diseases had been attributed to older age of patients in that group. Thus, our findings with comparable data may suggest a role for better preservation of thymic reserve in the pediatric age patients.",

Prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of cyclosporine for all patients (with monitoring of ciclosporine levels) and anti-thymocyte globulins for unrelated donors. Results: One hundred and forty seven transplantation were performed, 92 for malignancy and 55 for other diseases. Donors were of unrelated origin for 82 patients, familial HLA identical for 59 and haploidentical for 6. Thirteen children (8.8%) developed severe neurological events after a median of 42 days (range 4 to 310 days) from HSCT. Those events includes: convulsions related to cyclosporine A (CsA) neurotoxicity (n=3) or to other aetiology (n=2), intracranial hypertension related to CsA (n=2), viral infection of central nervous system (n=3), irradiation or chemotherapy related toxic leucoencephalopathy (n=2) and early cerebral leukaemia relapse (n=1). HSCT was performed for malignant disease in 7 patients, myelodysplasia, severe aplastic anaemia or Fanconi anemia in 4 and sickle cell disease in 2. Median age at HSCT was older in patients with neurological complications (11.9 years) than in the other group of patients who received an HCST at the same period (5.5 years). Allogenic HSCT with unrelated donor was performed in 55% of cases in both groups. TBI containing regimen was administered in 38% of patients that developed neurological symptoms and 34% in the other group (p=ns). All patients received CsA as GVHD prophylaxis. The incidence of GVHD was the same in both groups. No patient died because of neurological complications. Conclusion: Incidence of severe neurological complications was low in our experience as compared to literature data and didn't lead to death of the patients in any cases. We found no factors that could increase the risk of such complications (no influence of the type of HSCT, GVHD, conditioning regimen).",

Frassoni S.Martino's Hospital (Genoa, I) Background: Following the experienced of the Perugia group, who first introduced thiotepa (THIO) in allogeneic stem cell transplantsd (HSCT), we have developed several conditioning regimens, including THIO, cyclophopshamide (CY), Fludarabine (FLU), melfalan (MEL) and TBI mainly for patients above the age 45. Aim of the study: assess the outcome of patients undergoing an allogeneic HSCT with a THIO based conditioning regimen. Patients: 374 patients were allografted with a THIO based regimen, between 1994 and 2005, from HLA identical siblings (n=221) or family partially mismatched (n=67) or unrelated (n=86) donors. Median patient age was 48 years (range16-.67). The stem cell source was unmanipulated in all cases, either bone marrow (n=276) or peripheral blood (n=98). The conditioniong regimens were classified as reduced intensity (n=177) (THIO+CY or THIO+FLU) or intensified (n=197) (THIO +CY with MEL or TBI 200r). The disease was in 1stCR (n=221) or more advanced phase (n=153). Diagnosis were as follows chronic myeloproliferative disease (n=123), acute leukemia (n=120), myelodisplasia (n=46), other (n=85, including lymphoma and myeloma). All, patients received cyclosporin methotrexate GvHD prophylaxis. Alternative donor transplants received additional anti-thymocyte globulin in the conditioning. The median follow up for surviving patients is 5 years (range 1-12 years) Results: The actuarial 10 year survival is 40%, (60% vs 30% in CR1 or >CR1 disease). The cumulative incidence (CI) of transplant related mortality (TRM) at 10 years is 29% (18% vs 36% for CR1 or >CR1 disease); TRM for CR1 patients grafted from identical siblings (n=94) is 12%. Acute GvHD grade III-IV was seen in 6% of sibling HSCT and 12% of alternative donor grafts. CI of relapse related death (RRD) at 10 years was 27% (18% vs 32% in CR1 or >CR1). In multivariate analysis on survival and TRM, significant predictors were disease phase and intensity of the conditioning (RR 1.66 for intensified regimens). These two variables (disease phase and conditioning intensity) were also significant predictors of TRM. Conclusions: This 12 year study, shows that THIO based regimens produce encouraging long term survival, with low incidence of GvHD and TRM, when used in combination with CY or FLU alone. The addition of MEL or TBI reduces RRD, but increases significantly TRM and does not improve survival Disease phase remains a major predictor of outcome.",

Marit, C. Foucaud, M.S Dilhuydy, F. Bijou, C. Melot, V. Frossard, N. Milpied CHU Bordeaux (Bordeaux, F) We have evaluated the outcome of RIC in 128 adult pts with malignant disease (AML: 54, MM: 31, NHL: 14, MDS: 8, ALL: 6, CML: 4, CLL: 3, MPD:3, MDS/MPD:2 and Solid tumor: 2) between October 1997 and August 2006. There were 87 female, median age was 56 yo (50-65). Pts had received a median of 2 line of treatment before RIC (0-5). Forty-four had a previous autologous transplant. At time of RIC, 32 patients were refractory or in relapse while 57 were in CR (Ist: 33; 2d or more : 24). The donor was an id sib for 93 and a MUD in 35 (with 1allelic mismatch in 6). Overall 81 had ATG as part of cond reg. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA or CSA-MTX in 109 pts, 19 had CSA-MMF. With a median FU of surviving pts of 30 m (3-110) the survival (OS) and EFS are 45% and 39% at 3y and 33% and 32% at 5y respectively. Sixty-nine pts died with (50% relapse and 50% toxicity).The probability of TRM at 100 d and 3 y are 10% and 31% respectively. The 5y probability of relapse is 49%. These figures are strictly superimposable for pts with Myeloid or Lymphoid disease. The factors affecting significantly (p<0.05) the 5y OS and EFS were: disease status at time of RIC (OS:40% CR vs 26%; EFS: 40% in CR, 30% in CP and 18% in progressive disease), an id sib as donor (OS:64% vs 25%; EFS: 35% vs 30%), having an aGVHD grade 1 or 2 ( OS: 43% vs 10% if aGVHD grade 3-4; EFS: 40% vs 15%), and a CGVHD limited or extensive (OS: 50% vs 23% if no CGVHD; EFS: 50% vs 24%). The factors that affected the risk of relapse was the occurence of an acute and or chronic GVHD. The TRM was significantly increased in pts with previous autologous transplant, an aGVHD. EFS and TRM is affected in pts with previous autologous transplant. Conclusion: The extended follow-up in this series of pts older than 50 years, identifies a high risk of disease relapse and TRM but provides evidence that RIC allografts can produce sustained DFS in a significant number of patients with controlled disease. The best results are achieved in patients in CR.",

Nicolini (1) Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is increasingly used for patients not considered candidates for conventional Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Longlasting mixed hematopoiesis has been considered a hallmark of RIC in the first clinical trials but this may no longer be the case for the RIC applied to date. Here we report the occurrence of mixed chimerism (MC) analyzed by PCRamplification of short tandem repeats in granulocytes and T cells purified using Whole Blood magnetic MicroBeads and an autoMACS Separator from 24 patients after HSCT following 4 different Fludarabine (Flu) based protocols. Twenty-four adults transplanted for MM with good partial responses (7), for ALL (2), AML (8), CML (1), NHL (2) or HD (2) in complete remission (CR) or for treated MDS (2) were enrolled in the study. All patients engrafted successfully. Blood from patients in CR were tested at d+28, d+60, d+90 and for approximately half of patients also at d+180. The following 4 RIC based protocols have been used: A) Flu: 30 mg/m\u00b2 (Flu30) d-4 to d-2 + TBI 2 Grays at d0 (n=4), B) Flu30 d-6 to d-2 + Busulfan (Bu) 4mg/kg d-5 to d-4 + ATG 2.5 mg/kg d-4 (n=9), C) Flu30 d-7 to d-3 + Melphalan 140mg/m\u00b2 on d-2 + Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) 20mg d-8 to d-4 (n=5) and D) same as RIC B but patients received Alemtuzumab T-cell depleted grafts with an add back of 130x10 6 T cells/kg at d+1 (n=6). GVHD prophylaxis consisted mostly of MMF d+1 to d+28 in combination with CSA tapered during the second and third month. After RIC B, C or D, all granulocytes at d+28 were of donor origin indicating that hematopoiesis of the recipient had ceased. By contrast, traces of recipient granulocytes (max 15%) limited to the first d+28 sample were detected in patients after RIC A. In patients who had received Alemtuzumab in vivo (RIC C), T cell MC occurred occasionally, scattered over 30% of the samples, but half of patients after RIC B and all patients after RIC A or RIC D had T cells of mixed origin that, once present at d+28, persisted through all the samples tested. T cell MC was most prominent in patients receiving ex vivo T cell depleted grafts (RIC D). We conclude that recipient hematopoiesis reflected by MC in lineages other than T cells is rare in patients after Flu-based RIC and virtually absent when Flu is used together with Bu or Me. By contrast, T cell MC is frequent and its extent is subjective to differences in the T cell depletion methods applied.",

In fact, the majority of patients experience relapse either after conventional chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). In 2004, we have demonstrated that allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) is an attractive salvage strategy. Therefore, we extended our previous observations to 32 patients. All patients received several courses of debulkying chemotherapy followed by allo-SCT with a RIC regimen. Ten patients (31%) received T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab. Patients' median age was 42 years (range, 15-64). Histologic PTCL subtypes included: unspecified (n=14), ALCL (n=8; n=5 ALK neg, n=3 ALK pos), AILD (n=4), intestinal (n=3), lymphoblastic (n=2), panniculitislike T-cell lymphoma (n=1). Twenty-seven pts (84%) received transplant from HLA-identical sibling donor, 3 from haploidentical donor and 2 from unrelated donor. The median time from diagnosis to allo-SCT was 16 months (range, 6-100). Seven-teen patients (53%) had failed a previous auto and 22 pts (68%) had received more than 2 lines of therapies. Disease status at time of allograft was CR in 9 cases, PR in 14 cases, and PD in 8 cases, and untested in one case. At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 6-86), 22 (69%) were alive (n= 16 in CR, n= 2 PR, n=4 PD) and 10 died (n=7 disease, n=3 toxicity). The estimated 5 year OS and PFS projections were 62% (95% CI, 42-82%) and 53% (95% CI, 35-71%), respectively. After allo-SCT, the disease relapsed/progressed in 14 patients (44%) at median time of 5 months (range, 2-12): 7 died of disease and 7 are still alive (4 responded to chemotherapy and/or DLI). Patients receiving allo-SCT more than 1 year after diagnosis have better PFS and OS (PFS: 57% versus 42%, P=0.5; OS: 69% versus 44%, P=0.4). We did not observe a significant difference in PFS and OS between patients with specific versus unspecified variants (PFS: 57% versus 46%, P=0.9; OS: 73% versus 55%, P=0.8). Based on these findings, allo-SCT is an effective salvage strategy for PTCL. Due to the limited number of patients, it is difficult to evaluate which subtype respond better.",

El-Solh King Faisal Specialist Hospital (Riyadh, SA) Background: The only curative modality for patients (pts) with primary immune deficiency disorders (PID) is allogeneic stem sell transplantation (ASCT). Over the years, the results of ASCT in pts with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) have improved but pts with non-SCID PID are still a challenging group since they require conditioning before SCT and the results with myeloablative regimens have generally been disappointing with the major causes of death being infections and toxicity. We report here 12 pts with non-SCID PID who were transplanted using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. Patients and methods: From May 2005 to July 2006, 12 pts with confirmed PID underwent ASCT at our institution; 7 pts had Bare Lymphocyte syndrome, 2 pts had Wiskott Aldrich syndrome (WAS), 1 patient (pt) had chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), one had Omenn syndrome, and one had CD40 ligand deficiency. Upon admission for SCT, none of the pts had evidence of active infections or significant organ dysfunction. The stem cell source was bone marrow from matched related donors in 10 pts and partially matched unrelated cord blood in 2 pts; the CD34 dose for pts with matched ASCT was 6 x 10 6 /kg (range, 3.9-12 x 10 6 /kg). The conditioning was with fludarabin 30 mg/m\u00b2/dose x 5 days, melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2/dose for one dose and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 5 mg/kg for 2 doses pre-SCT and 2 doses post SCT; the CGD pt received Campath 0.2 mg/kg/dose for 5 doses instead of ATG. CSA was given for GVHD prophylaxis at the standard doses; cord blood transplant pts received steroids in addition. Results: The regimen was overall well tolerated, one pt died before engraftment at 55 days due to respiratory failure. Ten pts engrafted with a median time to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 10 9 /L of 12.5 days, and a median time to a platelet count of 20 x 10 9 /L of 24 days; chimerism (assessed by short tandem repeats, STR) ranged from 24% to 100% in the lymphoid line. Acute GVHD grade 2 developed in 5 pts (40%), all responded to steroids therapy and are in remission now. Eleven pts remain alive; the one year overall survival and event free survival are 91% and 81% respectively. All engrafted pts are well now with no major infections and the 2 pts with WAS have normal platelet counts. Conclusions: The results of non-myeloablative conditioning in ASCT of pts with non-SCID PID are encouraging. Longer follow up is needed to determine the durability of engraftment.",

Patients and Methods: 58 high risk AML patients undergoing C-HSCT (n=31) or RIC-HSCT (n=26) from January 1996 to May 2006 were analyzed. Median age was 34 years (14 to 58) for C-HSCT and 53 years (39 to 68) for RIC-HSCT (p<0.001). 84% vs 78% of patients were in 1st or 2nd CR and 9.7% vs 11% were in progression /relapse at transplant in C-HSCT vs RIC-HCST. 71% and 55% of patients undergoing C-HSCT vs RIC-HSCT had a pre-transplant Charlson score of 0-1 (p=0.22). Three and 11% of patients had received a previous transplantation, respectively (p= 0.11). 10% vs 19% of patients received HSCT from an unrelated donor among those undergoing C-HSCT vs RIC-HSCT, respectively (p=0.27). Finally, regarding source of progenitor cells, 80% vs 100% of patients undergoing C-HSCT vs RIC-HSCT received peripheral blood progenitor cells (p=0.01). Results: 93% C-HSCT vs 81.5% RIC-HSCT of patients reached CR after the transplant (p= 0.17). Regarding relapse rate 26% vs 15% of patients relapsed after transplantation, respectively (p= 0.24). The incidences of grades 2-4 aGVHD were 57% and 31% in C-HSCT vs RIC-HSCT patients, respectively (p= 0.13), while the incidence of extensive cGVHD was 45% vs 60% (p=0.05).

H\u00f6cker Medical University (Vienna, A) Anti-D alloimmunization develops in up to 20% of RhDnegative patients on chemotherapy following exposure to RhD antigen, but is reported to be rare in recipients of haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), especially following myeloablative conditioning. The objective of our study was to evaluate the incidence of anti-D alloimmunization after D-mismatched HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). From 112 consecutive patients receiving RIC-HSCT between April 1999 and March 2006, 26 patients had a D-mismatched donor. Twelve RhD-positive patients had a RhD-negative donor, 14 RhD-negative patients received a RhD-positive graft. RIC consisted of fludarabine (3x30mg/m\u00b2) and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) or polychemotherapy containing amsacrine (4x100mg/m\u00b2), fludarabine (3x30mg/m\u00b2), cytarabine (4x2g/m\u00b2), cyclophosphamide (2x40-60mg/kg), ATG (3x10-20mg/kg) and 4 Gy TBI. For GvHD prophylaxis cyclosporin A and mycophenolate mofetil were given. After HSCT, red blood cell support consisted of donor Rh-type RBCs. After a median follow-up of 30 months, 17 patients with a Dmismatch donor are alive. Two RhD-negative patients died within 10 days after HSCT and were not evaluable for anti-D alloimmunization. Eight patients developed acute GvHD between days 7 and 52 and 11 patients chronic GvHD between days 75 and 274 after transplantation, respectively. RhD-positive patients with RhD-negative donors received a median of 11 (range, 0-92) RhD-negative RBC units during a median of 229 days (range, 0-38 mos.) after HSCT. RhDnegative patients with RhD-positive donors were transfused with a median of 11 (range, 0-44) RhD-positive RBC units during a median of 60 days (range, 0-54 mos). None of the 24 evaluable patients developed an anti-D antibody after a median serological follow-up of 290 days (range, 14 days to 4 years) after transplantation. There was no difference in transfusion requirements between D-mismatched vs. Dmatched patients. Reduced-intensity conditioning containing fludarabine and/or ATG effectively prevented anti-D formation in both RhDnegative recipients of a RhD-positive graft and RhD-positive recipients of a RhD-negative graft in our group of patients. To avoid transfusion related anti-D formation after D-mismatched HSCT, donor Rh-type RBCs should be given from the day of stem cell graft infusion.",

            "text": "In patients with aplastic anaemia, conditioning with reduced-intensity followed by infusion of T-cell depleted grafts is associated with limited transplant related morbidity and universal survival N. Novitzky (1) Introduction: The survival of patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for aplastic anaemia (AA) has improved significantly, but many patients develop extensive graft vs. host disease (GvHD), with the associated morbidity and mortality. T-cell depletion of grafts decreases the incidence and severity of GvHD but may result in greater risk of graft failure. Patients and methods: Between 2004 and 2006, 16 patients with AA were conditioned with fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 for 5 consecutive days (150 mg/m\u00b2) followed by cyclophosphamide (CFM) 120 mg/kg. In addition 2 (one with Fanconi's anaemia) received busulfan 8 mg/kg instead of CFM. HLA identical sibling donors were mobilised with filgrastim (5-10 ug/kg) for 5 days. Donor cells were quantitated and the CD34+ cell number determined. PBPC grafts were then incubated \"in the bag\" with alumtuzumab (1 mg/10 9 mononuclear cells) at 20\u00b0C for 30 minutes. In addition, patients received cyclosporin from day -1 and continued for 90 days. End points were OS, DFS, incidence and severity of GvHD. Results: Median age was 21.5 (7-49) years and 4/15 was females. Median CD34+ cell infused was 3.93 x 10 6 /kg, containing median of 22.2 x 1 4 /kg CFU-GM. The median \"ex vivo\" alumtuzumab dose employed was 10 mg (range 5-10 mg). There was universal engraftment and leukocytes reached 0.5 x 10 9 /L at a median of 12 days (8-17) post transplantation. Extra haematological toxicity of the conditioning was limited to grade I-II intestinal side effects. Eight individuals did not develop pyrexia during the neutropenic period. No patient developed GvHD. Two subjects had CMV reactivation (pp65+) and responded to therapy with gancyclovir. Another two developed reactivation reactivation of BK virus and haemorrhagic cystitis. One patient developed delayed graft failure 6 months post SCT and recovered following a second T-cell depleted transplant with similar conditioning. Donor-recipient sex mismatch was present in 6 instances and post transplant bone marrow karyotype analysis showed that haematopoiesis was of donor's origin in each case. All patients survive at a median of 651 days (range 60-1353) with normal blood parameters. Conclusion: Purine analogues in combination with alkylators are a sufficiently intense immunosuppressive conditioning to allow successful engraftment of T-cell depleted PBPC grafts in AA. Alumtuzumab \"in the bag\" led to excellent GvHD prophylaxis, resulting in minimal morbidity of the procedure.",

Czibere, H. Pape, N. Safaian, M. Kondakci, U. Germing, R. Haas, G. Kobbe Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf (Duesseldorf, D) In this prospective study we evaluated a combination of tacrolimus (FK506) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis following nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) from matched unrelated donors (MUD). Forty-four patients (median age, 52 years), suffering as well from advanced hematological malignancies as from additional comorbidities, unable to undergo conventional myeloablative conditioning because of unacceptable treatment related risks, received fludarabine (30mg/m\u00b2, day -4 to day -2) and totalbody irridation (TBI, 2Gy, day 0), directly followed by an infusion of peripheral blood stem cells from matched unrelated donors. As GvHD prophylaxis a combination of oral Tacrolimus at 0,15mg/kg twice daily (from day -1) and oral MMF at 15mg/kg twice daily (from day 0) was applied. MMF was tapered from day +28 to day +50 in patients without occurrence of any acute GVHD symptoms. Tacrolimus was tapered from day +70 to day +100 in patients suffering from aggressive malignancies (n=29), and from day +100 in those with indolent malignancies (n=15). Regimen related toxicities were mild. Fourty-two (95%) patients had engraftment of donor cells and 39 Patients (89%) achieved a complete donor chimerism after PBSCT. Two patients experienced non-fatal early graft-rejection. The incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD were 56% (n = 25) and 4,5% (n = 2), respectively. First symptoms of acute GvHD were diagnosed at a median of day +75 (range 12-99). Thirty-two patients were evaluable for chronic GvHD. Of these, 18 patients (56%) developed cGvHD, 10 (31%) showed limited and 8 (25%) experienced extensive disease. Thirteen Patients (29%) died from relapse or progressive disease. Treatment related deaths from GvHD and associated complications occurred in 12 Patients (27%). After a median follow-up of 653 days (range, 31 -2054 days), 19 patients (43%) are alive. Median overall survival was 474 days. The use of tacrolimus/MMF after MUD non-myeloablative PBSCT in patients with advanced hematological malignancies shows encouraging rates of GvHD control without significant increase in toxicity. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only potential curative therapy for patients with low/intermediate grade non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). High treatment related mortality (TRM) and toxicity using conventional high dose conditioning regimens excluded most patients with low/intermediate grade NHL from this treatment modality given their intense pretreatment, frequent comorbidities and older age. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allow successful allogeneic HCT even in patients with contraindications for conventional HCT. RIC HCT can induce potent graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects with promising results even in advanced patients with NHL. Results appear to be best in patients with low tumor burden at the time of HCT. Combined use of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with RIC may increase anti-lymphoma activity of the conditioning and improve engraftment without increased toxicity to non-target organs. We initiated a multicenter phase I/II study combining RIT using yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan on day -14 with fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 day -4 to-2) and 2 Gy TBI (day 0) followed by an HLA-matched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft on day 0 for treatment of patients with advanced lgNHL. For postgrafting immunosuppression the patients receive mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. So far, 14 patients have been enrolled. Diagnoses were follicular lymphoma (n=7), mantle cell lymphoma (n=4) and chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=3). Median age was 56 (range, 47-67) years. Patients were \"high risk\" with refractory disease or relapse after preceding HCT. Nine patients are evaluable for engraftment. Their PBSC grafts from either matched related (n=1) or matched unrelated donors (n=8) contained a median of 5.6x 10 6 (range, 2.6-14.7x10 6 ) CD34+cells/kg. The regimen was very well tolerated with no additional toxicity attributable to RIT. Engraftment was rapid and sustained with median time to >500 granulocytes/\u00b5L of 17 (range, 0-25) days and 2 patients with a nadir <20000 platelets/\u00b5L for 1 or 11 days, respectively. No TRM in the first 100 days was observed. Incidence of grade II-IV GVHD to date was 33% with grade II=1 and III=2. Median follow-up is still short with 99 (range, 49-154) days, therefore definite evaluation for tumor response and graft-versus-host disease is still pending. In conclusion, a combination of RIT with RIC is feasible with no additional toxicity due to RIT and stable engraftment in all patients.",

Freund, C. Junghanss University of Rostock (Rostock, D) Background: Everolimus (RAD) is an inhibitor of m-TOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and has been shown to prevent graft rejection in kidney, heart, and lung transplantation. Combination of RAD and cyclosporine A (CSA) resulted in synergistic immunosuppressive activity and allowed CSA dose reduction leading to an improved safety S91 profile. No data are available about RAD pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Here, we analysed pharmacokinetics of RAD and RAD/CSA in dogs to determine the dosing scheme for subsequent nonmyeloablative HSCT. Methods: Healthy dogs were given different doses of RAD (BID, PO) alone or combined with 15 mg/kg CSA BID PO for 5 days. At day 5 blood samples were collected before and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h after the morning dose. RAD concentrations were analysed by a fluorescence-polarisationimmunoassay. Initial RAD dose of 1.5 mg BID was adapted in subsequent experiments to reach targeted trough level of 3-8 ng/ml, as recommended in solid organ transplantation. Hematotoxicity, blood lipids, and creatinine were monitored. Results: At a dose of 1.5 mg RAD alone (n = 4) the median trough level was 6.2 (range 4.8-13.1) ng/ml, cmax was 16.2 (12.6-27.1) ng/ml and the corresponding AUC amounted to 117 (96-197) ng/ml*h. However, 1.5 mg RAD/CSA (n = 2) caused an increase in median trough level to 28.7 (24. 1-33.4 ) ng/ml, in cmax to 77.2 (76.7-77.6) ng/ml, and in AUC to 643 (579-707) ng/ml*h. After RAD dose reduction to 0.5 mg (n = 2) and 0.25 mg (n = 2) trough levels were 14.5 (14.1-14.9) ng/ml and 6.6 (5.5-7.7) ng/ml, cmax were 28.7 (22.1-27.5) ng/ml and 11.7 (9.4-14.0), and AUC were 190 (159-220) ng/ml*h and 97 (85-110) ng/ml*h, respectively. Trough concentrations and cmax correlated with AUC (r = 0.927 and 0.966, respectively; p < 0.01 both). CSA blood concentrations were unaffected by different RAD doses. At 0.25 and 0.5 mg RAD/CSA and 1.5 mg RAD alone hematologic parameters, blood lipids, and creatinine values remained within normal limits. Increased toxicity (severe diarrhea and hypercholesterolemia) was observed at 1.5 mg RAD/CSA. Conclusion: RAD and CSA show a linear correlation in dogs. Application of 0.25 mg RAD in combination with 15 mg/kg CSA BID leads to trough levels of 3-8 ng/ml in healthy animals and is well tolerated. This regimen is currently tested in a nonmyeloablative canine HSCT model (data will be presented).",

Anagnostopoulos G.Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a severe complication even in patients undergoing reduced intensity regimen allogeneic transplantation (RIC-HCT). We retrospectively investigated the incidence and risk factors for CMV infection and CMV disease and their effect on OS and TRM following RIC-HCT in 37 patients aged 50(15-63) years old. Thirty-five were allografted from siblings and 2 from matched unrelated donors. Median follow-up time was 16 months. According to donor/recipient (D/R) CMV-seropositivity status, 32 patients were evaluated as high risk for CMV infection (D/R: +/+), 3 low risk (D/R: -/-) and 2 intermediate risk. All the conditioning regimens were Fludarabine-based (33 reduced intensity, 4 non myeloablative). ATG was applied in 19 patients. The median graft cell-dose administered was CD34: 5.6x10 6 /kg, CD3: 4.8x10 8 /kg, CD4: 2.75x10 8 /kg. All patients received antiviral prophylaxis with valacyclovir plus multipotent immunoglobulin (IVIG). CMV infection was evaluated by serological and molecular methods (real-time PCR) weekly during the first trimester and on clinical indications afterwards. CMV infection was defined as the presence of at least one PCR-positive sample (serum, gastric juice, BAL, CSF) plus clinical manifestations. In a total, 548 samples were examined with real-time PCR; seven patients were diagnosed with CMV infection, 3 with CMV disease while on immunosuppression. At a median time of 6 months the estimated incidence of CMV infection was 37% and of CMV disease 13%. In a multivariate analysis, age, CMV-status, ATG, aGvHD, cGvHD, CD34, CD3, CD4 graft cell-dose were investigated as possible risk factors. A lower dose of CD4 graft cells was significantly associated with the presence of CMV infection and CMV disease (p=0.008). Patients diagnosed with CMV infection were treated with either ganciclovir, valganciclovir or foscarnet plus IVIG. In our study, the reactivation of CMV has not been identified as a statistical significant factor affecting the outcome in terms of OS and TRM. The OS was strongly associated with advanced disease status at HCT and aGvHD (p<0.05). Patients undergoing RIC-HCT are at risk for CMV-infection or disease especially those with low dose of CD4 graft cells. Close monitoring for CMVload is of clinical importance throughout immunosuppression period.",

Tsirigotis, R. Or, M.Y. Shapira, M. Bitan, S. Samuel, Y. Polyansky, A. Ackerstein, B. Gesundheit, S. Slavin, I.B. Resnick Hadassah Hebrew University (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: The influence of graft composition on the outcome of allogeneic non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) using mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) remains controversial. In this study, we analyzed the impact of CD34 and CD3 cell doses on the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after PBSC using a standard NST regimen. Patients and methods: A total of 103 consecutive patients with various malignancies were included in this study. Preparative conditioning consisted of a combination of fludarabine 180 mg/m\u00b2, oral busulfan 8 mg/kg or intravenous busulfex 6.4 mg/kg, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, Fresenius) 40 mg/kg. Results: Data analysis did not reveal any association between CD34 and CD3 cell dose and the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD (table) . Spearman's rank correlation of the number of CD34 and CD3 in the stem cell inoculum, grade of acute and severity of chronic GVHD did not show any significant association either ('p' range from 0.062 to 0.926). Conclusion: Following NST, neither the dose of CD34 nor the number of CD3 T cells in the stem cell inoculum influenced the incidence or severity of acute or chronic GVHD. The incidence of GVHD is probably dependent on the degree of alloreactivity between the donor and the recipient, which may vary between each donor-recipient pair, thus suggesting that a personalized approach may be mandatory to control GVHD in recipients of T cell repleted allografts. Table: Influence of infused CD34+ cell dose on the incidence of GVHD (compared groups with cell dose higher or lower than median, and higher than 75 percentile versus lower than 25 percentile).",

Kolb GSF (Munich, D) Background: In the past years, an increasing number of nucleic acid based drugs (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, ribozymes, RNA interference, defibrotide) have been identified and already tested in clinical trials. But until now, no information is available whether these treatment approaches might interfere with chemically and structurally related drugs, e.g. nucleoside analogues (NA) used in cancer or in antiviral therapy. Objective: In the current survey we investigated, whether addition of single-stranded (ss) polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRN) could interfere with the cytotoxic effects of NAs (e.g. fludarabine, cytarabine) on lymphocytes or myeloid blasts in vitro. Methods: For this purpose, T-lymphocytes or CD33 positive myeloid blasts (purity >95%) were labelled with [1\u00b5M] carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (5(6)-CFDA-SE) and incubated with different concentrations of fludarabine or cytarabine (200\u00b5M, 20\u00b5M und 2\u00b5M). Cellular proliferation was induced by addition of CD3/CD28 Dynabeads for the Tcells, or a cytokine cocktail containing 50ng/mL of SCF, 50ng/mL of IL-3, 200ng/mL of GM-CSF, 100ng/mL of G-CSF, 2 U/mL of EPO, 0.47g/L of human transferrin, and 5\u00d710-5mmol/L of 2-ME for the myeloid blasts. Defibrotide and random PDRNs of different length (20-80b) and concentrations were added immediately or with a delay of 24, 48 or 72 hours to the assay. After 5 days, quantitative CFDA distribution was measured by flow cytometry to assess the cellular proliferation of the T cells and the myeloid blasts. Moreover, cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Results: PDRNs of different length and composition could antagonize the cytotoxic effects of NAs (fludarabine, cytarabine) in both, T-cells and myeloid blasts. Thereby, the antagonistic effects of PDRNs revealed to be concentrationand time dependent. Moreover interference with aequimolar concentrations of PDRNs could be detected even with a delay of 48 hours. Of importance, the concentration of NAs used in these experiments, referred to concentrations applied in standard clinical treatment protocols. Conclusion: Treatment approaches using nucleic acid based drugs might be critical in context with NAs like fludarabine and cytarabine and diminish the efficacy of these drugs. Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanism of these effects.",

Blaise Institute Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Few data are currently available regarding platelets transfusion needs and the kinetics and predictive factors for platelets recovery after educed-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). In this study, we analyzed the profile of platelets recovery and transfusion needs in the first 100 days after sibling PBSC RIC in a single institution series of 166 consecutive transplantations. Patients and graft characteristics were: age 49 y. (range: 18-70), diagnoses: 66 myeloid malignancies (40%), 64 lymphoid malignancies (39%), and 36 metastatic solid tumors (21%). 112 pts (67%) received an ATG-based RIC, while 54 pts (33%) received a low dose irradiation-based RIC. 75 pts (45%) developed grade 2-4 acute GVHD. Platelets recovery (>20 G/L) was observed at a median of 9 days (range: 0-99). The kinetics profile of platelets recovery is shown in the figure below. In the whole study population, the nadir was observed around day +7 after allo-SCT, and a plateau was reached about day +35. Filtered and irradiated donor apheresis platelets were used and patients needed a median of 1 unit (range: 0-53). In this series, 83 pts (50%) did not require any platelets transfusion during the follow-up period (median follow-up: 442 days) and 83 patients (50%) received at least one transfusion of platelets (54 were not transfused beyond day +100 after allo-SCT). Platelets count prior to RIC allo-SCT (median count 144 G/L; HR 0.44 (0.28-0.7) p=0.002), conditioning regimen (use of ATG; HR 1.86 (1.08-3.2) p=0.025) and the occurrence of acute (HR 1.54 (1.17-2.01); p=0.001) and severe GVHD (HR 2.36 (1.38-3.05) p=0.0006; 82% of patients with grade 3-4 acute GVHD were transfused) were the parameters significantly associated with platelets transfusion needs in multivariate analysis. In this cohort, 145 pts could be assessed for platelets recovery at day +100: among them, 99 (68%) had a platelet count >99 G/L. Univariate analysis found a significant impact of acute GVHD (p=0.0001) and platelet count prior to conditioning (p=0.012) but only acute GVHD ); p=0.001) was associated with a delayed platelet recovery in a multivariate model. No impacts of pathology, GVHD prophylaxis regimen or CD34+ cell dose were demonstrated. Overall, these observations show a significantly lower rate of platelets transfusions and a quicker kinetic of platelets recovery after RIC allo-SCT and point out the effect of acute GVHD. Treosulfan has recently demonstrated antileukaemic and immunosuppressive activity in pre-allogeneic HSCT in high risk hematologic patients. Therefore we started a Treosulfanbased conditioning with the aim to find a less toxic, safer and efficient treatment for patients with high risk malignancies, non fitting age and comorbidity criteria with standard conditioning regimens. Evaluations of TRM, OS, DFS, and relapse were secondary objectives. Since July 2005 to October 2006 , 31 patients (16 males, 15 females ) entered this study. Mean age was 42 years (range 17-65). Underlying diseases were: Acute Leukemias(8 ALL, 8 AML), 3 CML, 3 MM, 6 MDS, 1 hystiocitic sarcoma, 1 HD, 1 Myelofibrosis). All patients were heavily pretreated; only 13/31 were in CR at the moment of transplant; mean Hematopoietic cell transplant-comorbidity index (HCT-CI ) was 2 according to the Seattle criteria. Conditioning consisted of Treosulfan 12-14 gr/m 2 for 3 days in combination with Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 for 5 days. Cyclosporine plus short MTX were used as GVHD prophylaxis; anti-Thymocyte globulin was used in patients receiving PBSCs and MUD transplants. Seventeen patients received HSCs from HLA identical siblings and 14 from match unrelated donors. Source of stem cells were bone marrow in 9 patients and peripheral blood stem cells in 22 patients. Twenty-nine patients (93%) engrafted; mean time to neutrophil >500 x10 9 /L was 16 days (range 10-26), to platelets >20000x10 9 /L was 16 days (range 10-24). One patient did not engraft (a sAML patient with previous thyroid cancer and I 131 radiation);one patient was not evaluable for early death at day +9. Four patients experienced GI toxicity (two grade II, two grade I), one patient had grade II liver toxicity and five grade I, one patient had grade I renal toxicity. Six patients presented aGvHD (four grade I, two grade II ). One patient had Cr-GVHD and it was limited. Twenty patients are alive: KM probabilities of survival at 3 and 15 months were 81%(95%CI 67-96%)and 48%(95%CI 24-72%), respectively. Fithteen out of 31 patients are in complete remission with a median followup of 8 months (range 1-15 months ). Eleven patients died: 8 for recurrent disease, 3 for TRM. This preliminary study underlines that Treosulfan-Fludarabine can be safely associated in pre-allogeneic conditioning regimen even in high risk patients. Longer follow up is necessary to evaluate the anti-tumor capacity of this regimen.",

Shimoni, T. Zwas, Y. Oksman, I. Hardan, N. Shem-Tov, R. Yerushalmi, A. Avigdor, I. Ben-Bassat, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel-Hashomer, IL) Allogeneic SCT is an effective therapy in lymphoma by providing both intensive chemotherapy and graft-versuslymphoma effect. Thus, allogeneic SCT is associated with reduced incidence of relapse compared to autologous SCT. However, myeloablative allogeneic SCT is associated with high risk for non-relapse mortality (NRM) in heavily pretreated lymphoma patients (pts). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) reduces NRM rate, but is associated with high-risk for relapse in active disease. This study was designed to explore the safety and outcome following inclusion of Zevalin with RIC regimens prior to allogeneic SCT in pts with refractory lymphoma with an attempt to augment anti-lymphoma effect of RIC while maintaining reduced NRM. The study included 12 pts, median age 54 years (range, 37-62), having SCT from an HLA matched sibling (n=7) or matched unrelated donor (n=5). Histology was diffuse large cell (n=3), transformed low grade (n=7) or mantle cell lymphoma (n=2). The median number of prior therapies was 4 (range, 2-6) and 4 pts have previously failed an autologous SCT. All pts had active disease by PET-CT at SCT and 3 pts also had extensive marrow involvement. Rituximab 250 mg/m\u00b2 followed by Zevalin 0.4 mCi/kg were given on day -14 and fludarabine combined with iv busulfan (n= 6) or melphalan (n=6) was started on day -6. All pts engrafted, a median of 14 days after SCT (10-22). Nine pts are evaluable for response; 5 achieved CR, 4 achieved PR, 1 died early and 2 are too early for evaluation. With a median follow-up of 9 months (range, 1-27), 6 pts are alive. The estimated 1-year PFS is 34%. Only 2 pts relapsed with a cumulative incidence of 20%. One pt died early after SCT of multi-organ toxicity. Two pts died of acute GVHD and one of chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade III-IV was 60% and the rate of NRM was 46%. The inclusion of Zevalin in RIC allogeneic SCT is feasible with no impairment in engraftment and relatively low organ toxicity in heavily pretreated pts with refractory lymphoma. The low incidence of relapse suggests an augmented anti-lymphoma effect. NRM was relatively high due to increased incidence of severe acute GVHD. This is probably related to the planned early withdrawal of immunesuppression. Zevalin in combination with allogeneic SCT merits further study. Better results may be achieved in pts earlier in disease course and with longer duration of immune suppression.",

            "text": "Fludarabine and melphalan conditioning with tacrolimus as GvHD prophylaxis is effective reduced-intensity combination regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients compared to conventional regimen O. Imataki, H. Ohnishi, A. Kitanaka, Y. Kubota, T. Tanaka, T. Ishida Kagawa University (Kagawa, JP) Purpose: Controlling regimen-related toxicities and GVHD was critical issues for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) recipients with increasing age. Among various RIST regimens, a combination of fludarabine and melphalan (FM) has limited transplantation-related mortality (TRM) by using an appropriate immunosuppressant. We retrospectively compared an efficacy of RIST with conventional SCT. Methods: Eighty-two consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic SCT in our hospital from October 1998 to July 2006 for hematological malignancies were enrolled in this study. RIST was performed since August 2000 in our hospital. Preparation for RIST was consisted with 25 mg/m 2 fludarabine on days -6 to -2 and melphalan 70 mg/m 2 on days -3 to -2. Melphalan dose was modified according to the patients' age, condition and disease status as following; (1) reduction to 40 mg/m 2 for the high ages older than 50 years or recipients with organ dysfunction, (2) escalation to 90 mg/m 2 for the nonremission cases before transplantation. GVHD prophylaxis for RIST was tacrolimus alone or occasionally incorporated with short term methotrexate. Conventional regimen was with high dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (12 Gy) or busulfan and high dose cyclophosphamide. Cord blood stem cell transplantation case was excluded. Results: Among 82 patients, 42 cases received conventional SCT and 40 did RIST. The median age was 43 years (range, 16-71 years) in both, 35 years for conventional SCT and 51 years for RIST. Stem cell source was 26 cases of bone marrow (BM) and 16 of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) in conventional SCT and 21 of BM and 19 of PBSC in RIST. HLA full-matched donor was available in 69% (29/42) cases in conventional SCT and 75% (30/40) in RIST. In both groups, 4 patients developed engraftment failure and the residues achieved to engraftment on median day 14. The probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 17% (7/42) in conventional SCT and 8% (3/40) in RIST. Grade II to IV GVHD occurred in 38% in conventional SCT and 28% in RIST. Grade III to IV GVHD was represented in 17% in conventional SCT and 18% in RIST. Overall survival observed in 1035 days of median follow-up time was equally 43%. Conclusion: RIST with FM incorporated tacrolimus exploited the low TRM incidence and had a moderate risk of GVHD in Japanese patients. It is suggestive that our regimen might exert a potential benefit of graft-versus-tumor effect in RIST comparative to conventional SCT. Background: Nonmyeloablative regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have been developed for patients ineligible for myeloablative conditioning to reduce the regimen-related toxicities (RRT) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Methods: In this retrospective analysis describing our results after the first HCT in patients with AML and CML after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), we compare RRT and NRM with group of patients after myeloablative conditioning (MC). The RIC and MC groups were balanced regarding the diagnosis and disease stage. The RIC patients, however, significantly differed from MC patients in median age (51y vs. 37 y). The RIC consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m S94 (total dose 8-12 mg/kg), and ATG Fresenius (10 mg/kg/d; 4 days), post-transplant immunosuppression was mostly cyclosporine alone. The conventional regimen was busulfan (total dose 14-16 mg/kg) + cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) followed by post-transplant cyclosporine and methotrexate. In both groups, PBSC from related donors were mostly used as a stem cell source. RRT were graded using Seattle toxicity criteria. Results: The RIC vs. MC group had a median follow up 1019.5 vs. 1049 days, respectively. None or mild RRT was more frequent and severe RRT less frequent in RIC group in comparison with MC group (Tab 1). Sixteen percent and 17 % of patients in the RIC and MC group did not achieve a complete chimerism, usually for early disease progression, or graft rejection. Median time to achievement a complete chimerism was 83.5 vs. 82 days for RIC and MC, respectively. Concerning aGvHD, the incidence and severity was less in the RIC group (Tab. 1). Nine/16 AML patients (56%) in RIC group relapsed and 4 of them died (44%), whereas 9/20 AML patients (45%) relapsed and 7 of them died (78%) in MC group. Twenty/22 (91%) RIC CML patients are in molecular remission (MR) versus 20/25 (80%) CML patients from MC group. Mortality from any cause was 18% vs. 36%, NRM was 5% vs. 19%, early TRM was 2.5% (for disease progression) vs. 17%, late TRM was 5% vs. 2% for RIC and MC patients, respectively. Conclusion: Reduced intensity conditioning containing fludarabine, busulfan, and ATG Fresenius is very well tolerated regimen, with lower RRT, NRM, early and late TRM than conventional myeloablative regimen. This regimen can completely replace standard conditioning in patients with myeloid malignancies. The HDT with ASCT for breast cancer (BC) was frequently used in nineties. Randomized trials however failed to prove any significant outcome benefit over control arms and the number of transplants has declined to zero. We present the long term follow up of our patients treated in those days. Patients: There were performed 77 transplant procedures from Sept 1994 till Oct 2001 in 60 patients. The median age at ASCT was 47.5 (21-61), median interval from dg to ASCT was 0,6y (0,3-11.8). The stage was classified as I in 7%, II 47%, III 37% and IV 10% at time of dg. The reason for HDT was an adujvant approach in pts with high relapse risk ( LN involved) in 57% pts, neoadjuvant setting in inflammatory BC in 5% pts, primary metastatic disease in 10% and relaps/progression/resistance after/to previous therapy in 28% pts. Tandem HDT approach was planned in 18 pts (30%). Peripheral blood progenitor cells was used in all pts, additional BM in two procedures. The majority of HDT regimens for single transplant approach (n 42) was represented by CTCb (54%) and ICE (24%). The first HDT in tandem program consisted out of melphalan and paclitaxel in 67% and melphalan alone in 28% of cases. The 2nd HDT was performed in 17 pts (one pt did not proceed to 2nd HDT due to disease progression) and the most frequent used regimen was CTCb (88%). The median follow-up is 7 years. Results: All patients engrafted. There were observed 39 events during the follow up, disease progression or relapse in 36 (60%) pts and treatment related mortality in 3 pts (5%). All together 35 (58%) deaths was observed. The 5y probability of progression free survival for adjuvant th, primary metastatic and relapsed/resistant pts resp. was as follows: 59%, 33% and 12% resp. (p<0.005). The relapse risk at 5y was 39%, 60% and 81% resp. (p<0.005). Overall survival at 5y was 61%, 33% and 18% resp. (p<0.005). No secondary malignancy has been observed. Conclusion: The longterm outcome of pts who underwent the HDT with ASCT for BC is presented with the significant difference among the distinct subgroups. Nowadays there is not possible to consider the HDT for pts eligible for biological therapy based on the hormonal receptors positivity and/or HER-2 positivity and new chemotherapeutic drugs. The patients who are negative in all three biological markers can be however eligible for prospective trials. The inclusion criteria and possible trial design will be disscused. relapse, or tumor that displayed germ cell histology in obtained tissue specimens. Other 3 had secondary neoplasm (or malignancies that evolved from residual teratoma) -AML, fibrosarcoma and neuroendocrinal carcinoma. Of the 17 patients with relapse / secondary neoplasm, 15 received further treatment. This treatment consisted of surgery alone in 2 patients, chemotherapy alone in 2, radiotherapy alone in 1, combined surgery + chemotherapy in 5, chemotherapy + surgery +radiotherapy in 3 and chemotherapy + radiotherapy in 1 patient. Systemic therapy consisted of paclitaxel/gemcitabine combinations in GCT patients, and disease specific regimens in patients with secondary neoplasms. Results: Median survival from the moment of relapse was 95 days (3 months) in all patients, and 178 days (6 months) in the group of 14 patients who received further treatment. In patients who received no further treatment median survival from the moment of relapse was only 25 days. Three patients are still alive with survival times 37,4; 24, 3 and 6,2 months from the moment of relapse. In all of those three patients relapse was confined to a single metastatic site, they received multimodal treatment (chemotherapy + surgery or radiotherapy) and all of them achieved CR in the course of palliative therapy.",

Lyu (1) Background: Since 1970's Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) committee has conducted various treatment strategies for pediatric soft tissue sarcoma patients. Recently, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HDC/PBSCT) has been tried for these high-risk patients by some institutes, but the results seem controversial, until these days. Patients and Methods: This study was performed based on the retrospective review of medical records of patients with RMS in a single institute. Thirty-one patients who had been diagnosed as RMS and treated in Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea from 1982 were enrolled in this study. All of these patients were classified as high-risk RMS (stage III & IV). Results: Median follow up period for all patients were 3.1 years. The 3-year event free survival (EFS) for patients who underwent HDC/PBSCT and only chemotherapy were 43 \u00b1 16% and 20 \u00b1 8%, respectively (P=0.11). But, patients who respond well to conventional induction chemotherapy (complete response or very good partial response) showed 3year EFS as 80 \u00b1 16%, while 23 \u00b1 9% for HDC/PBSCT and chemotherapy group, respectively (P=0.04). Especially, patients with preoperative (TNM) stage IV presented 43 \u00b1 16% for HDC/PBSCT group and 0% for chemotherapy group (P=0.002). Conclusion: High dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation seems to achieve prolonged remissions in pediatric high risk RMS. It must be considered in patients who are in VGPR or CR following conventional-dose therapy to do HDT/PBSCT for pediatric high risk RMS, especially TNM stage IV.",

Pts were all treated with 5 cycles of induction chemotherapy (adriamycin, cisplatin, ifosfamide and etoposide); resection of the primary tumor was performed after the 4th or 5th cycle, and radiation therapy was given to any gross residual tumor and/or metastatic site remaining positive on the MIBG scan before SCT. Bone marrow harvest was done after the 3rd or 4th cycle, purging was achieved by the CD34 positive selection method. Median CD 34 count was 3.82 x 10 6 /kg (range, 1.2-11.4 10 6 /kg). The conditioning was with carboplatin, melphalan and etoposide. Stage IV pts (11) received total body irradiation (TBI); and those with stage III disease (4) did not. Cis Retinoic acid was given orally for 6 months post transplant. Results: The regimen was overall well tolerated, all patients developed mucositis grade IV. All pts engrafted with a median time to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 10 9 /L of 15 days (range, 11-48 days), and a median time to a platelet count of 20 x 10 9 /L of 46 days (range, 24-134 days). CMV infection (detected by CMV antigenemia test) developed in 5 pts (33%). Two deaths occurred; one was at 49 days post SCT due to sepsis and the other was late due to refractory CMV infection. The overall event free survival is 86.7 % at 26 months post SCT. Conclusions: Our results are encouraging, although longer follow up is necessary. CMV infection may be a problem in this population when purging with CD34 + positive selection method, likely due to the delayed immune reconstitution after SCT. Introduction: Autologous HSCT has been increasingly employed for the treatment of severe progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Actively inflammatory phases of the disease are believed to be the ideal target of the procedure. We analyzed the Italian GITMO-Neuro database in order to evaluate different outcome according to this variable. Patients and methods: Forty-six MS patients, aged between 16 and 52 years (median 36 years), 30 females and 16 males, were reported to our database. All of them were mobilized with Cyclophosphamide 4 g/m 2 and G-CSF; unmanipulated PBSC were infused after BEAM conditioning regimen and ATG administration. Disease phase were 27 Secondary Progressive (SP), 16 Relapsing Remitting (RR), 3 of them classified as malignant diseases of Marburg type, 1 Primary Progressive (PP) and 2 Optical neuromyelitis. Results: All the patients engrafted but one (RR) who died 27 days after HSCT for a septic shock. Data are shown only about SP and RR forms. EDSS disability scale modification according to baseline is available in 40 patients (14 RR and 26 SP), and is reported in the following graphic. Median follow-up time in the two groups is 22,5 (1-96) and 21,5 (6-84) months respectively. Chi square analysis showed a statistically significant difference (p=0,008).",

Annaloro (1) The relatively few but encouraging reports concerning autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) describe the use of selected CD34 cells. We autografted four CD patients (three males aged 26, 28 and 45 years, and one female aged 35 years) who had a CD activity index of >200 and were refractory to at least four lines of conventional therapy including salicylates, corticosteroids, azathioprine and infliximab. Disease activity manifested as relapsing peri-rectal abscesses in all four patients, two of whom were also affected by refractory intestinal bleeding requiring regular transfusions. Unselected PBSCs were collected after mobilisation with CTX 1.5 g/m\u00b2 and G-CSF 10 mg/kg. The conditioning regimen included CTX 50 mg/kg on days -5 to -2, and rabbit antithymocyte globulin 2.5 mg/kg on days -4 to -2. No growth factors were administered after PBSC infusion. All of the patients developed febrile episodes, but none required empirical antifungal therapy; one patient also experienced BKpositive hemorrhagic cystitis, which resolved after intravenous hyperhydration. The patients reached unsupported platelet counts of 50,000/l eight or nine days after AHSCT, and neutrophil counts of 500/l after respectively 10, 11, 12 and 13 days. They were all discharged after peripheral hematopoietic recovery, with the remission of baseline CD symptoms and without developing any further signs of disease activity. Intestinal bleeding recurred in one patient one month after AHSCT, whereas no abscesses were observed during the 12month follow-up; the other patients are disease free three, seven and eight months after AHSCT. CD is a pathogenetically self-standing immune-mediated disorder, which enabled us to evaluate the feasibility of AHSCT using unselected PBSC after a conventional conditioning regimen. Transplantation allowed our patients with end-stage CD at least a transient remission, with an acceptable rate of procedure-related complications and prompt peripheral recovery. As in the case of all preliminary reports, it is not clear whether the single early relapse reflects the worst prognosis of the patient, or if the disease-free survival of the others simply reflects the short period of follow-up; however, the results suggest that AHSCT with unselected PBSCs may find a reasonable place in at least in some subsets of patients with advanced CD. Previous studies showed durable responses in two thirds of patients up to 3 yrs after HSCT (1) . This treatment modality is now further investigated through the ASTIS-trial (autologous stem cell transplantation international scleroderma trial), a prospective, controlled, randomized trial to compare safety and efficacy of HDIT + HSCT versus monthly i.v. cyclophosphamide in SSc patients at risk of major organ failure or early mortality. Objectives: To evaluate whether HDIT + HSCT is superior over conventional treatment in terms of safety and efficacy in SSc patients, and to assess potential predictive factors of response. Methods: SSc patients with early active diffuse disease with or without major organ involvement are eligible. SSc patients randomized to the transplant arm undergo mobilization with cyclophosphamide 2x2 g/m\u00b2, conditioning with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg, rbATG 7.5 mg/kg, followed by reinfusion of CD34+ selected autologous HSCT. Those randomized to the control arm are treated with 12x monthly i.v. bolus cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m\u00b2. The primary endpoint is event-free survival, defined as survival until death or development of major organ failure during 2 years follow-up. Objectives:",

We describe three patients with progressive CIDP refractory to conventional treatments who were treated with cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) autologous stem cell transplant. Methods: All immunosuppressives except steroids and intravenous immune globulin (IvIg) were stopped prior to stem cell mobilisation with cyclophosphamide 2g/m\u00b2/day for two days and filgrastim 10mcg/kg/day from day 6. Peripheral blood stem cells were harvested on days 12 to 13. Transplant conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg/day on days -6 to -3 inclusive followed by methylprednisolone 2mg/kg/day and rabbit ATG 2.5mg/kg/day on days -3 to -1 inclusive. Results: Three patients with CIDP (two paraproteinassociated) were treated; the median age was 40 years (range 29 -72). Patients had received a median of 7 prior immunosuppressive therapies; all had previously received steroids, plasmapheresis, IvIg and rituximab. Stem cell mobilisation and harvest was successful in all patients with a median yield of 16.7 x10 6 /kg CD34 cells. Pre-transplant, median Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS) score was 7, median Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score was 46, and median 10 metre walk time was 11.5s (one patient could not walk). A median of 5.2 x10 6 /kg CD34 cells were infused. All patients had grade 4 neutropenia; one required prolonged intensive care support. All patients engrafted (median neutrophil engraftment 12 days; median platelet engraftment 17 days). At 6 -12 months posttransplant, median ONLS score was 7, median MRC sum score was 48 and median 10 metre walk time was 9.6s (one patient could not walk). At last follow-up (median 12 months) all patients are alive. Two of three report significant improvement in function; one reports worsening of function. Serial lymphocyte subset analysis shows a marked posttransplant fall in CD4 and CD8 counts, but increase in or preservation of natural killer cell numbers in all patients. Conclusions: Cyclophosphamide/ATG autologous stem cell transplant may prove an effective treatment for refractory CIDP, but is associated with significant toxicities. A randomised study comparing autologous transplant with conventional immunosuppressive treatments is warranted.",

Skin grafting (donor BALB/c; third party C3H) was performed one day after BMT to assess tolerance. Chimerism in peripheral blood was followed by FCM analysis. Mice were sacrificed at 16 weeks post-BMT. Anti-dsDNA antibody IgG (ANA) titer was measured by ELISA. Peripheral blood counting was performed by autoanalyzer. Microscopic structural changes in spleen were investigated. Results: 3 Gy TBI on day -1 with anti-CD40LmAb and BMT on day 0 allowed induction of high levels of multi-lineage mixed chimerism (donor CD4+ T cell; 52.2\u00b19.5 % and CD8+ T cell; 42.4\u00b18.5 % at 14 wks). No clinical signs of GVHD were shown. There was no significant difference in anti-dsDNA IgG titer between chimeric mice (27.6\u00b127.6 mg/ml) and BXSB mice (31.1\u00b127.6 mg/ml) (p=0.77).

            "text": "Background: High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) infusion is being used as an alternative treatment for auto-immune diseases like systemic multiple sclerosis (SMS) refractory to immunossupressive therapy. However, the toxicity of this aggressive treatment is still a concern. We report our experience with 2 different high-dose conditioning regimens in patients with SMS, and their clinical efficacy and toxicity. Methods: We studied 41 patients (24 women, 17 men; median age, 42 years: range, 27-53 years) with progressive SMS (median EDSS score= 6.5). All patients were mobilized with cyclophophamide (2g/m 2 ) and G-CSF . No CD34+ selection was performed. Twenty one patients (51,2%) were treated with BEAM regimen plus equine antithymocyte globulin and 20 patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (200mg/Kg; Cy-200) plus rabbit antithymocyte globulin. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and EDSS. Results: Post-transplant hematopoietic recovery was successful in all patients and the median time to engraftment was 9 days (range 7-10 days). Thirty-five patients had enough follow-up time for evaluation. Three patients (all in the BEAM group) died: sepsis, alveolar hemorrhage and conditioning regimen toxicity. In the Cy-200 group, 10 patients (10/14; 71,4%) responded to the treatment (the disease stabilized or improved) , and in the BEAM group, 12 patients (12/18; 66,6%) responded. Treatment failure, defined by an EDSS increase, was seen in 10 patients (31,2%). No gadolinium enhanced lesion was seen on post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging in the 28 patients analyzed. The principal early toxicities were: fever during neutropenia (46%), infection (20%) and allergic reactions with antithymocite globulin (12,5%). The BEAM group presented more clinical complications (71,4%) than the Cy-200 group (40%); p=0.04. The main late events were also infectious, but 3 patients presented with deep venous thrombosis. These late adverse effects occurred in both groups: 63,0% with BEAM and 35% with Cy-200 (p=0.08). Conclusions: More intensive immunosuppressive regimens, like BEAM, did not seem to yield better results in terms of clinical efficacy than Cy-200. Even though this initial conclusion need to be confirmed with longer follow-up to observe disease progression and relapse, the greater incidence of some serious side effects, does not favor this intensive regimen. Median baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) was 6,0 (4,5-6,5). Methods: We used granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for mobilization. High-dose immunosuppressive therapy included BEAM+ATG (antithymocyte globuline) in 10 patients and Fludarabine+Melphalane + ALG in 3 respectively. Regimen-related toxicities were mild. Period after SCT was associated with transient worsening of neurological symptoms in all patients: emphasis ataxia, paresis and in 2 cases acute bladder dysfunction. Estimate EDSS was conducted at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 months and every 6 months after SCT; MRI was conducted at base-line and every 6 months after SCT. Results: We carefully observe 10 patients after SCT. With a median follow-up of 17,9 (range, 3 -36) months. EDSS decreased in 2 patients, 1 patient has progressive and other patients are stable. MRI plaque of 6 patients had not changes after SCT (in different terms). Oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid decreased in 2 patients across 9 months and 1 year after SCT. We detect negative correlation between effects of SCT and duration disease/ degree EDSS. Conclusion: Clinical response was observed in most patients (9 of 10) after SCT. These findings confirm that SCT might be considered as an effective treatment for MS. was 66% at 100 months. PFS of MS patients was 89% at 100 months, but 23% for the others. This difference may be interpreted as the effect of the combination of the more intensive conditioning regimen for the MS patients (BEAM) than for the others (Thiotepa-cyclophosphamide: TT) with possibly intrinsic disease characteristics. This 10.years experience confirms the view that autologous 5CT may significantly alter the progression of SADS.Elegant studies argue for a renewal of the T cell repertoire, but no equivalent studies have made in patients treated with high-dose immunosuppression alone.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been proposed as a new therapeutic strategy in patients refractory to conventional treatments. In our Institution 7 patients with early (< 4 years) active diffuse cutaneous SSc (M/F 1/6, median age 38 years, range 21-59) were treated with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen followed by AHSCT. All the patients had a modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) greater than 14. The aims of the study were primarily the reduction of mRSS and of the disease activity, and secondly the improvement of physician global assessment (PGA), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and visceral function tests. Skin score and visceral function evaluation were recorded 3 and 6 months after transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cells were mobilised using CTX (4g/m2) and filgrastim (10mcg/Kg/day). After leukapheresis CD34+ cells were positively selected. Conditioning regimen included i.v. CTX (50 mg/Kg on days -5 through -2) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/Kg on days -3 through -1). The median number of reinfused CD34+ cells was 5.1 x 106/Kg (range 2-5.9). All of the patients experienced at least one febrile episode during post-transplant neutropenia which completely resolved after hematopoietic recovery. No grade III-IV extra-hematologic toxicity and treatment related mortality were observed. Six months after AHSCT all patients showed a significant reduction in mRSS (-65%, p<0.001) and disease activity (-85%, p<0.0001). Improvement of PGA and HAQ scores were documented, whereas no significant changes in the lung, heart and kidney function were observed. According to this preliminary experience the prompt clinical improvement of skin involvement is significant. The lack of visceral improvement may be due to the relatively short duration of follow up. We conclude that AHSCT is feasible and effective in selected patients with early severe SSc.",

The rationale is to establish a resetting of autoimmune disease through the administration of an immunoablative regimen followed by reinfusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. The primary goal of this therapy is to improve quality of life, induce a remission of the disease and increase survival. Monthly pulsed cyclophosphamide is currently used for the conventional treatment of SSc. Objectives: to evaluate dose intensification of CYC in diffuse cutanteous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc).patients resistant to conventional therapy. Patients and methods: Three patients (1 male and 2 females) with severe dcSSc were screened for HSCT and were found to be not eligible for the ASTIS prospective trial due to the cumulative dose of CYC previously administered. Prior to HSCT, patients were assessed with physical examination, modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), chest CT scan, pulmonary function test with DLCO, cardiac echocolordoppler and HAQ. A mobilization regimen with CYC 4g/m\u00b2 and recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rHu G-CSF), was used for all patients. The graft was manipulated through selection of CD 34 + cells and patients were conditioned with Cyc 200 mg/Kg/ and intravenous rbATG (Thymoglobulin) 7,5 mg/Kg. Results: All patients engrafted and were discharged from the BMT unit within the normal time range. They were followed up with periodical physical examination, routine laboratory tests and instrumental examinations according to rheumatological practice. The median follow up time was 15 months (range 6-36). No opportunistic infections have been observed during 2 years of follow up. No transplant related toxicity was reported. Skin score and HAQ improved significantly in all patients. Lung function was stable.

Methods: In cooperative study, from 01.2004 to 09.2006 18 patients with rapidly evolving secondary progressive MS were transplanted, after original conditioning regimen, with unmanipulated autologous peripheral blood SC mobilized with high-dose cyclophosphomide (CY), ATG and granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (GCSF). During pretransplantation phase in vivo T cell depletion with Leicladin was perfomed. Patients were considered for inclusion if MS had been diagnosed using Poser's criteria. MRI with contrast enhancement and EVP investigation were perfomed monthly for a pretreatment period of 3-6 months and compared with serial MRI and EVP following 6 months and then once every 3 months. Results: Mobolization was successful in all cases, and a median nuber of 7.4 x 10 x 6/kg CD34+ cells were collected. The median follow-up is now 18 months(range 4 to 36 months).

Conclusion: ASCT is considered an important new promising theraputic procedure for refractive autoimmune disease like MS because of lower transplant-related mortality and greater feasibility than allogenic transplantation. These results demonstrate that the theraputic sequence \"in vivo T cell depletion-CY-GCSF-ASCT\" has the capacity to suppress MR-enhancing activity, improve EVP data, an effect that sustained with time. ASCT cannot be recomended as standard therapy for severe and rapidly worsening MS. The final impact of this procedure on MS course remains to be established. A high incidence of auto-GvHD was observed after an alemtuzumab containing myeloablative conditioning regimen and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with CLL. We performed a detailed analysis of the defects of immune reconstitution in patients receiving alemtuzumab and analysed the influence of auto-GvHD on minimal residual disease. We treated 27 patients with CLL (Binet B / C) with autologous SCT in two trials of the German CLL Study Group at the University of Ulm. In the CLL3 trial (n=11) autologous SCT was performed after standard conditioning (TBI/Cy). Patients in the CLL3C trial (n=16) received additional alemtuzumab before SCT. Blood samples were analysed for intracellular cytokine production (IL2, INF-y). Immune reconstitution was assessed by immunophenotypic analysis of different lymphocyte subsets (CD45RA, RO, CD27, CD62L, CD28, CD4, CD25, FoxP3, CD152 (CTLA-4), CD69, GITR). T cell receptor repertoire was assessed by spectratyping. There were no skin rashes or auto-GvHD in the standard TBI/Cy group. In contrast, 12 of 16 patients (75%) receiving Alem/TBI/Cy developed a skin rash between 43 and 601 days after SCT. In 7 patients a clinical diagnosis of auto-GvHD was S100 made. The median duration of GvHD was 517 days (range 60-867). The reconstitution of CD4 and CD8 positive cells was severely delayed in the Alem/TBI/Cy group with a particular depletion of CD8+ cells for up to 2 years. The CD4/CD8 ratio was abnormally high in the Alem/TBI/Cy group. This increased ratio was mainly caused by the extreme CD4/8 ratio imbalance in patients with GvHD. Interestingly, histology showed a predominant invasion of the skin by CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Molecular analysis revealed oligoclonal expansion of T cells in the skin biopsy samples of patients with GvHD with similar V\u00df subfamilies (BV3, BV18)(n=3). Detailed analysis of the immune reconstitution will be presented. The addition of alemtuzumab led to continuous MRD negativity in 10/14 patients (71%) compared to 0/7 patients receiving TBI/Cy (p=0.0039). Within the Alem/TBI/Cy group continuous MRD negativity was observed in 6/6 patients with auto-GvHD (100%) vs. 4/8 patients without auto-GvHD (50%; p=0.08) ). The current study demonstrates a remarkable incidence of a GvHD-like syndrome attributable to the addition of alemtuzumab to the conditioning regimen before autologous SCT in patients with CLL. Longer follow-up will show if the GvHD-like syndrome will lead to prolonged MRD negativity. (1) (",

The enzyme promotes cell adhesion, migration and invasion and plays a significant role in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. We investigated the effect of heparanase in models of stem cell transplantation, in order to evaluate its potential function in the development and maturation of stem cells and hematopoietic progenitors. Applying a mouse model of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we evaluated the effect of heparanase on the engraftment process and the development of graftversus-host disease (GVHD). It was found that white blood cells (WBC) counts in the peripheral blood of the donor were significantly higher in heparanase treated mice, reaching peak levels two days after administration. The spleens of the heparanase treated mice were significantly bigger with less WBC content but with higher total number of stem cells (evaluated by CFU counts). Analysis of the recipient mice, demonstrated a better and faster engraftment in mice receiving cells from donors that were treated with heparanase. While control mice rapidly developed signs of GVHD (i.e., weight loss, hair loss, diarrhea) and died after 12 days, heparanase treated mice showed only a mild appearance of GVHD, and died only 27 days post transplantation, indicating a significant improvement in survival. Next, we applied a murine model of transgenic mice over-expressing heparanase as the recipients of BMT. Monitoring clinical parameters of GVHD, the transgenic mice showed 100% survival on day 40 post transplantation, compared to 50% survival on day 14 in the control group. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that heparanase modified the function of T cells following transplantation. It inhibited the activation of T cells through modulation of their repertoire of cytokines indicated by a marked increase in the levels of Interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6 and IL-10, and a parallel decrease in IL-12, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-alfa and interferon (IFN)-gamma. T cell activation was inhibited regardless of whether the cells were incubated with active or latent heparanase. Moreover, by using point mutated inactive enzyme, we have found that the documented cytokine shift was independent of heparanase enzymatic activity. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, a direct effect of heparanase on T-cell activation and cytokine profile, resulting in beneficial therapeutic outcome in vivo.",

            "text": "A novel means of immunosuppression in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the use of multipotent, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). MSC have been shown to be nonimmunogenic and actively suppress T cell function and ameliorate GVHD clinically. Despite this, there is a paucity of pre-clinical data and a lack of consensus as to the efficacy of MSC. Our aim was to determine the optimal dose and time of MSC administration for the treatment of murine GVHD. We examined the effects of intraperitoneally injected, donorderived MSC in two murine models of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the first and most severe model, BALB/c (H-2d) mice were myeloablatively conditioned and transplanted with bone marrow and spleen from a major histocompatability complex (MHC) mismatched donor (UBI-GFP/Bl6 (H-2b)). MSC were injected either 4 hours prior to HSCT (0, 3x10 5 or 4x10 5 per mouse) or 24 hours post HSCT (0, 2x10 4 , 2x10 5 , 3x10 5 or 4x10 5 per mouse). Mice were monitored for the onset and severity of GVHD. In MHC mismatched HSCT recipients, doses of 3x10 5 (p<0.01) and 4x10 5 (p<0.05) MSC infused post-transplantation showed greater survival than controls, or recipients injected pretransplantation. Death from GVHD in the post-transplant MSC cohort was delayed by up to 33 days (figure 1). In MSC treated mice we observed no negative effects of MSC on donor cell engraftment and less diarrhoea (indicative of reduced gut GVHD) was seen as compared to controls. In our second model mimicking that of sibling transplantation in the clinic, MHC matched, multiple minor mismatch model donor cells (UBI-GFP/Bl6 (H-2b)) were injected into BALB.B (H-2b) mice that were conditioned and transplanted as above. MSC were injected either pre or post transplantation and monitored for onset and severity of GVHD. We showed a similar result to that seen in the full MHC mismatch model, with injection of MSC post transplantation showing increased (although not significant) survival when compared to controls or mice injected with MSC pre-transplantation (figure 2). Death by GVHD in these animals was delayed by up to 44 days. In conclusion, injecting MSC post-transplantation, not pretransplantation, has significant consequences on survival and elucidation of the mechanism by which these cells act may lead to wider application of HSCT.",

Munster, A. Rice Mater Medical Research Institute (South Brisbane, AUS) Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is a major limitation to the widespread application of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Pre-transplant myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens controls malignancy, ablates host immune responses and facilitates haematopoietic reconstitution, but they are associated with significant treatment related mortality (TRM). Conditioning drives host dendritic cell (DC) and donor T-cell interactions resulting in GVHD. Reducing the intensity of the conditioning (RIC) regimen maintains anti-leukaemic activity and reduces TRM but the overall incidence of GVHD is unchanged. No clinically relevant in vivo murine models of RIC allogeneic HSCT exist, preventing studies into the mechanism of RIC-associated delayed-onset GVHD. We have developed two RIC HSCT models ( -2d] ) that result in delayed onset GVHD, recapitulating that seen in the clinic. In the fully MHC mismatched HSCT model, whilst there was no difference in overall survival between RIC and MAC HSCT recipients, RIC HSCT recipients required sacrifice for lethal GVHD significantly later (d+23.11\u00b12.88, n=9) than MAC recipients (d+6.6\u00b10.1, n=23; p<0.000001). In the MHC matched, miHA mismatched HSCT model, more RIC HSCT recipients survived until d+90 than MAC recipients (p<0.001) and those RIC recipients requiring sacrifice were taken significantly later (d+60\u00b17.9, n=11) than their MAC counterparts (d+23.04\u00b11 (n=24); p<0.000001; Fig 1) . The development of these models has allowed the effect of RIC on chimerism and DC chimerism and subsequent GVHD to be investigated. RIC activates and increases overall DC numbers post-transplantation without triggering early GVHD. Delayed onset GVHD in these RIC HSCT recipients is characterized by the persistence of host DC and delayed emergence of activated donor DC (Fig 2) . Significantly, excess activated host DC in the BM of RIC mice was the only difference between RIC and MAC mice in the absence of donor cells. RIC does not alter levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa and IL-1b\u0192w\u0192nsecreted during conditioning or early post transplant. After HSCT this excess of activated host DC should be expected to cause earlier or more severe GVHD but the reverse was true suggesting that the pathogenesis of RICassociated delayed onset GVHD is different to that seen in the MAC setting.",

We have studied this using novel pDC depleting reagents in well-defined murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and G-CSF mobilized stem cell transplantation (SCT) . Surprisingly, donor pDC reconstituted very early after either allogeneic transplant, comprising up to 28% of the splenic cells 7 days after transplant before rapidly declining to undetectable levels 4 weeks later. In contrast, reconstitution of pDC occurred more slowly but was sustained in T cell depleted allogeneic transplant recipients in which graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was absent. Specific depletion of donor pDC in bone marrow grafts by antibody (120G8) significantly increased GVHD (survival: 0% v 43%, P<0.01, 120G8 v control mAb), despite the rapid reconstitution of pDC after BMT. Additional sustained depletion of pDC after allogeneic BMT prevented donor pDC reconstitution and further increased GVHD severity (clinical scores: 4.7 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 3.8 \u00b1 0.1, P<0.01, 120G8 vs control mAb), confirming that bone marrow derived pDC indeed promote transplant tolerance. Furthermore, immature reconstituting donor pDCs suppressed donor CD4+ T cell proliferation and TNF secretion after BMT and induced a 3fold expansion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg, P<0.01) without alteration of Th1/Th2 differentiation. In the SCT model, depletion of pDC within splenic grafts throughout or after G-CSF mobilization had no effect on GVHD mortality and morbidity. In contrast, G-CSF driven reconstitution of immature pDC (low levels of CD40 and CD86) within grafts following depletion prior to G-CSF administration resulted in a 2-fold increase in the numbers of Treg (P<0.05) and significantly improved GVHD (survival: 56% v 0%, P<0.01). This was the result of reduced levels of TNF in the sera (222 \u00b1 27.5 pg/ml v 461 \u00b1 99.2 pg/ml, P<0.05) since the protective effects of these immature pDC were lost when TNF deficient grafts were transplanted. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that donor pDC can attenuate GVHD, due to their ability to inhibit the CD4 dependent inflammatory arm of GVHD. However, this is requisite on pDC being immature, a constitutive property of marrow pDC which can be promoted in the periphery by G-CSF.",

K\u00f6rm\u00f6czi, I. Lohmann, K. Feldmann, M. Kouba, P. Kalhs, C. Zielinski, W. Pickl Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, A) Introduction: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and a leading cause of nonrelapse mortality resulting from profound immunodeficiency. Currently, biology-based markers both for diagnosis and monitoring disease activity of cGVHD as well as its functional consequences on the immune system are lacking. Methods: Within nine months 70 consecutive patients a median of 47 (range, 4-150) months after HSCT were enrolled into the study, including 21 without any history of cGVHD and 49 with active or resolved cGVHD. Evaluations comprised clinical parameters including cGVHD severity according to the NIH Consensus Development Project and treatment, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and infections according to the Infection Module of Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute. Peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry after staining for CD19+, staining for surface Ig and the B cell memory marker CD27+ and staining for CD21, which is absent on immature/transitional B lymphocytes. Results: No significant differences in absolute B, T, and NKcell numbers between the groups with and without cGVHD were observed. Elevated numbers (>15%) of immature/transitional CD19+/CD21-B lymphocytes were significantly associated with occurrence of severe infections (p=0.001). All patients with active cGVHD and elevated numbers (>15%) of CD19+/CD21-B lymphocytes had experienced severe infections. In contrast, only 21% of patients with active cGVHD and low immature/transitional B cell numbers had a history of severe infections (p<0.0001). The relative and absolute numbers of both non-class-switched and class-switched memory B cells were significantly lower in patients with active cGVHD when compared to patients never experiencing cGVHD (p=0.003 and 0.001). Preliminary data obtained from patients studied repeatedly support a trend towards normalization of B cell homeostasis in patients with decreasing cGVHD activity whereas ongoing active cGVHD was associated with continuous B cell disturbance in PB. Conclusions: Perturbation of circulating B lymphocyte compartments identifies cGVHD patients at risk for severe infections and may serve as novel biomarkers for monitoring cGVHD activity and its impact on the immune system. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) has been associated with clinical improvement in refractory acute or chronic GvHD. Immunological mechanisms of action of ECP are still under investigation. We have evaluated the immunological changes in frequency, immune-phenotype and functionality of circulating T-reg cells in 10 patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transpantation, affected by acute (n=3) or chronic (n=7) refractory GvHD. Patients were affected by cutaneous GvHD, with the exception of 3 patients who also presented hepatic GvHD. Patients received between 14 and 24 ECPs. T-reg were monitored by immune-phenotyping with CD3, CD4, CD25 and GITR antibodies. Further analysis included CD62L, CD45RO and intracytoplasmatic staining of Foxp-3 on gated CD4-CD25 bright cells. T-reg CD25 bright cells were then sorted to perform functional assays by IFNgamma ELISPOT (to check the inhibitory capacity in an allogeniec co-culture) and RQ-PCR for Foxp-3, TGF-beta and IL-10 mRNA quantification. ECP was accompanied by a significant increase of circulating CD4-CD25+ cells after 6 procedures, going from 10.6 to 28.3% of total CD4 (p<0.05), with a simultaneous increase of GITR expression on CD4-CD25+ cells (from 15% to 36.6%, p<0.05). This increase was sustained after 14 procedures. CD4-CD25 bright cells were almost totally positive for CD62L, CD45RO and Fox-P3 expression. Sorted CD4-CD25 bright cells were potently inhibitory towards CD25-negative cells when matched with an allogeneic target (IFN-gamma secretion was reduced for >80%, as detected by ELISPOT) and such capacity was dependent on cell-to-cell contact, as demonstrated by transwell experiments. RT-PCR revealed a significant expression of Fox-p3 in CD4-CD25+ cells when compared to CD25-negative cells (p<0.01), but there was no expression of TGF-beta and IL-10. All the patients presented an improvement of GvHD, tapering off or discontinuing other immunosuppressive drugs, at a median follow-up of 9 months after the first ECP. Even though the number of patients is limited, nevertheless our study shows a temporal correlation between ECP and increased percentages of circulating T-reg cells, which are GITR, CD62L and Foxp3-positive, do not secrete inhibitory cytokines, but present a strong inhibitory function mediated by cell-to-cell contact. Future studies on a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up will ultimately demonstrate the real impact of T-reg cells in mediating the clinical effect of ECP.",

            "text": "Objectives: The diagnosis of hepatic GvHD is often complicated, even if bioptical material is present. Because of their pivotal role in the induction of tolerance, we have recently proposed to include the number of Foxp3+ cells as a novel immunological marker to discriminate between infectious causes of inflammation and GvHD in pts. with enteropathy (Blood 107, 2006) . We have now extended our investigations to pts. with signs of severe liver disease after allogeneic SCT. In particular, we focussed on infiltrating FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in the portal field of the liver. Methods: A total of 90 paraffin-embedded tissue samples of liver biopsies of 86 patients (17 of patients with suspected GvHD, 22 of patients with suspected rejection after liver transplantation, 25 specimen of patients with hepatitis C and 26 with autoimmune hepatitis) were analysed by double immunoenzymatic labeling. Serial sections were stained conventional HE, and immunhistologically for CD8 and FOXP3. Results: All samples with histologically proven acute GvHD, liver graft rejection as well as hepatitis C, or autoimmune hepatitis showed a significant increase of infiltrating T cells. As expected, the dominating lymphocyte subset was CD8+ and was localized in the portal fields (PF) of the liver (e.g. mean 15 \u00b1 3 CD8+ /PF in GvHD). Although the numbers of CD8+ effector T cells were similar in all four groups, patients with GvHD and patients with liver rejection after liver transplantation had significantly reduced numbers of FOXP3+ T cells compared to hepatitis C or autoimmunhepatitis, resulting in a low FOXP3/CD8 ratio. Conclusion: As in gastrointestinal GvHD, the number of regulatory T cells is significantly decreased in the portal fields of patients with hepatic GvHD. Evaluation of the FOXP3+ T cells may also be a helpful marker in the diagnosis of GvHD vs infectious diseases of the liver. Future studies will show if adoptive immunotherapy with regulatory T cells will be able to adjust this deficiency and help to reduce the severity of hepatic GvHD.",

Currently, there is no standard therapy for steroid-resistant aGvHD. Here we report our experience with 14 pts suffering from steroidresistant gut aGvHD since late 2004 (13 pts de novo, 1 DLIassociated). Clinical diagnosis was histologically confirmed. Description: The patients' median age was 57y (22-68): diagnosis AML (n=8), MM (n=3) and ALL, MDS and lymphoma (each n=1). All but two had advanced disease prior to transplant. Acute GvHD started at median day 55 (33-176) after PBSCT from MRD(n=1)/MUD(n=12), and 387 days following the first DLI, respectively. All 14/14 pts presented with aGvHD of the gut (III n=7, IV n=7); additional manifestations were the skin (6/14) and liver (1/14) . Steroid resistance was defined as persistence of GvHD after 7d of prednisolon 2 x 1 mg/kg/day. Methods: Campath 1H (Alemtuzumab) was given at a total dose of 10 mg once weekly with up to 4 (median 2) doses. 1 patient received 2 courses of pentostatin additionally. All patients were treated with broad antibiotic, antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis. Results: GvHD completely resolved in 13/14 pts as determined by clinical criteria. 12/14 pts were also evaluated by colonoscopy and in 11/14 aGvHD grade 0 or I was confirmed by histology. Median duration to response from the initial dose of campath was 22 d (11-78). 12/14 pts could be discharged from hospital. With a median follow-up period of 7.5 months (3-17) since the onset of aGvHD, 8/14 pts are alive and well. In total 6 pts died: due to relapse (n=2) (which were chemotherapyrefractory pre-transplant), infection (n=3), and in the context of aGvHD and toxicity (n=1). Conclusion: Low-dose Campath is a promising, highly-active therapeutic option in steroid-resistant acute gut GvHD. Infections are of particular concern in this situation. Further trials are warranted to determine ideal schedules and dosages. Introduction: Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is increasingly incorporated into conditioning in unrelated stem cell transplantation. Several brands of ATG with different antibody spectrum and potency are available. Little is known about their potentially different effects in this setting. We reported on the immune reconstitution of 108 patients (pts) with haematological malignancies after unrelated transplants and conditioning with either rabbit ATG Genzyme (ThymoglobulinR, ATG-G) or ATG FreseniusR (ATG-F) (BMT 2004, 33, S3) . Here we analyse their clinical outcome. Patients: 66 pts (cohort1) received ATG-G, the following 42 pts (cohort2) ATG-F. There were no differences between the groups regarding age, Karnofsky index, disease or risk status, CMV risk and match. 31% had one class I Ag MM or one class II allel MM. Cohort2 had more primary AML (36 vs 17%), reduced conditioning (47 vs 26%), MMF (+CSA) instead of MTX (26 vs 5%) and slightly more PBSC (60 vs 42%). 71% of ATG-G pts received the product from day (d)-5 to -2, the later ones from d-4 to -1, whereas ATG-F pts had ATG from d-3 to -1. Most pts of cohort1 had a daily ATG-G dose of 2,5 compared to 15-20 mg/kg BW ATG-F in cohort 2. Results: At a md follow up of 938 d there was no significant difference in engraftment, chimerism, disease status or overall survival (OS). Probability of OS for cohort1 was 63% and 69% for cohort2 (p=0,25). There was a trend towards more frequent (73 vs 57%) and earlier readmissions (md 158 vs 209 d) in ATG-G pts. ATG-G pts had a md of 3 infectious episodes between d30 an 365 compared to 2 in ATG-F. Infections were categorized as equally severe in both groups. Acute GvHD\u00b0II-IV was seen in 64% of ATG-G compared to 43% of ATG-F pts (p=0,03). 76% of cohort1 and 67% of cohort2 developed chronic GvHD (p=0,38) which was extended in 64 vs 39% (p=0,04) and lasted longer in cohort1 (md 296 vs 69 d, p=0,03). ATG-G pts had more liver (p=0,05) whereas ATG-F pts had more skin (p=0,04) and gut cGvHD (p=0,04). Conclusion: Both treatments gave good results in matched and mismatched unrelated donor transplants without significant differences in overall and disease free survival. Progress in donor selection, immunosuppressive and antiinfectious drugs and conditioning may work in favour of cohort 2. Still at the given schedule a probably lower aequivalence dose of ATG-F prevented at least as much severe cGvHD as ATG-G. Differences in type of cGvHD seem to emerge which need further evaluation.",

The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-I) sirolimus and everolimus are immunosuppressants that have activity in the prevention and treatment of acute GVHD. Sirolimus in combination with calcineurininhibitors (CNI) has also been shown to have activity in chronic GVHD, however at the cost of considerable toxicity. Since mTOR-I exert their action by blocking interleukin 2 receptor signaling and thus arresting the cells at G1 phase they are promising candidates for tolerance induction. In addition, they also have antiangiogenic and antiproliferative activity. We hypothesized that treatment of cGVHD with mTOR-I and without CNI would be more effective in inducing tolerance than the combination of both and would have a lower toxicity profile. In this retrospective analysis we report 27 patients (pts) with severe cGVHD treated with mTOR-I (everolimus n=18; sirolimus n=9). Two pts terminated treatment prematurely because of adverse events (1xsevere cough; 1xhypertriglyceridemia). Ten pts had de novo cGVHD, 5 progressive cGVHD developing from acute GVHD and 10 had cGVHD following donor lymphocyte transfusions. Organ involvement included skin (scleroderma) in 20, lungs in 11, mucous membranes in 9, liver in 5, gut in 1 and eyes in 3 pts. Sixteen pts received mTOR-I in combination with steroids (n=16), one received a monotherapy and 8 pts received additional immunosuppressive drugs, no CNI however. To further reduce the risk of adverse events drug trough levels were monitored and the dosing was adjusted to low therapeutical levels (3-8 ng/ml). Nine pts had a complete response and 10 a partial response with an overall response rate of 70%. Steroids could be tapered and stopped in 10 out of 18 surviving pts. No difference was observed in everolimus-and sirolimus-treated pts. Major adverse events possibly related to mTOR-I were hyperlipidaemia and impaired wound healing, especially in pts with ulcerative lesions of skin or mucous membranes. None of the pts developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and infectious complications were rare. Seven pts died, 4 of the non-responders either due to cGVHD (n=2) or infection (n=2) and 3 of the responders due to relapse of the underlying malignancy. The median follow-up for surviving pts is 15 months. Controlled trials comparing this approach with alternative strategies are warranted. (1) Activating and inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are expressed on NK cells and a subset of T cells. KIR genotype is characterized by two main haplotypes: haplotype A including KIR2DS4 as the only activating KIR and haplotype B with varying number of activating KIRs. The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate prognostic significance of KIR genotype, including the presence of particular genes in the donor and the recipient as well as incompatibility in respective loci. Mismatches in graft-vs.-host (GVH) direction were considered if gene was present in the recipient and absent in the donor. Incompatibility in HVG direction was recognized in opposite situation. Seventy patients with hematological malignancies, aged 32.5 (18-58)y, given transplant from an HLA-identical sibling (n=28) or matched unrelated donor (n=42) were included. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative and based on chemotherapy alone (76%) or TBI (24%). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin, methotrexate, and, in case of MUD-HSCT, pre-transplant ATG. In a multivariate analysis the OS rate was negatively affected by KIR2DS4 incompatibility (48% vs. 83%; RR=4.4; p=0.01), and the presence of B haplotype in the donor (69% vs. 94%, RR=10.45; p=0.03), together with higher recipient age, unrelated donor, and blood group mismatch. Increasing number of activating KIR mismatches in HVG direction (analyzed as continues variable) was associated with decreased DFS (RR=3.45; p=0.008), increased NRM (RR=1.43, p=0.02), and the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (RR=1.35; p=0.03). Any KIR2DS4 incompatibility resulted in increased incidence of NRM (R=7.56, p=0.001). KIR2DS4 mismatch in GVH direction was associated with higher risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (RR=3.74; p=0.04) and extensive chronic GVHD (R=2.38; p=0.03), whereas mismatch in HVG direction resulted in increased risk of CMV infection (RR=4.67; p=0.02). Inhibitory KIR genotype was not found to influence any of the study end-points. Conclusions: Increasing number of activating KIRs in the donor, in particular in the absence of their couterparts in the recipient, seems to enhance GVH alloreactivity resulting in impaired survival. Whether this effect is associated with the activity of NK cells or KIR-bearing T cells requires further investigation. The role of KIR2DS4 appears diverse. Our results suggest that it may serve as minor histocompatibility antigen when expressed in the recipient and not in the donor.",

In order to study the role of IL-7 on thymopoiesis and peripheral T cell expansion and reconstitution from uncommitted stem cells in the setting of stem cell transplantation, we applied recombinant human IL-7 (rIL-7) in an experimental model of murine syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using in vitro incubated bone marrow cells (BMC), followed by in vivo administration of rIL-7. Results showed a two-fold increase in BMC cellularity after in vitro incubation of bone marrow cells with rIL-7, associated with an enhanced reconstitution of BMC and thymocytes at 45 days post transplant. In addition to increased cellularity, mice treated with rIL-7 also showed enhanced proliferative responses to mitogenic stimulation. Furthermore, riL-7 significantly increased rearrangement activating gene (RAG-1) expression and promoted V beta 8 (D)j gene rearrangement of the T cell receptor in the thymus. Treatment with rIL-7 induced secretion of IL-2 by thymic cells in vitro. The finding that rIL-7 induces expansion of BMC, enhances differentiation and proliferation of immature lymphocytes, thus counteracting post BMT immune deficiency, makes it a promising new agent for clinical application for treatment of immune deficiency and for enhancing immunohematopoietic reconstitution of stem cell allograft recipients.",

            "text": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 has been recently identified as a major receptor for LPS. It is possible that mutations of TLR-4 have been associated with LPS hyporesponsiveness, thereby reducing the risk of acute GVHD in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, stimulation of TLRs may also initiates a signaling cascade for induction of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to microbial eradication. Therefore, mutations of TLR-4 may increase risk of microbial infection, thereby accelerating acute GVHD in allogeneic HSCT recipients. Retrospective studies to determine the frequency of TLR-4 mutations and their possible association with acute GVHD contradict each other. In the present study, we examined the association of TLR-4 mutations in host and donor cells and the risk for acute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT. To examine the role of TLR-4 in host cells, we analyzed TLR-4 expression in the intestine by immunohistochemistry. Lethally irradiated C3H/HeN mice received allogeneic HSCT from C57BL/6 donors. TLR-4 expression in the intestinal epithelial cells was significantly increased after GVHD induction. Next, we used a mouse strain (C3H/HeJ) that has a single amino acid substitution in its TLR-4 as recipients in an allogeneic HSCT. Lethally irradiated either C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ hosts received HSCT from C57BL/6 donors. C3H/HeN recipients receiving C57BL/6 donors developed significantly less GVHD as measured by mortality and intestinal histopathology compared with C3H/HeJ recipients receiving C57BL/6 donors. Next, we examined the role of TLR-4 in donor cells. Lethally irradiated C57BL/6 hosts received allogeneic HSCT from either C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ donors. Mice receiving C3H/HeJ donors developed significantly less GVHD as measured by mortality and intestinal histopathology compared with mice receiving C3H/HeN donors. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR-4 in host cells is crucial in the microbial eradication in the intestine and the protection of intestinal GVHD, while responsiveness of donor cells to LPS may be an important risk factor for acute GVHD.",

Platzbecker, C. Pabst, C. Theuser, E. Ehninger, M. Bornh\u00e4user University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus (Dresden, D) Objectives: Recently, high numbers of regulatory T-cells within the stem cell graft were described to be associated with less graft versus host disease (GVHD) after related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Studies in mice also suggest a distinct role of gamma/delta TCR+ T-cells in mediating GVHD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define the yet unknown role of regulatory and gamma/delta TCR+ T-cells in human PBSCT from unrelated donors. Methods: The frequency of both T-cell subsets within the graft was analyzed in 63 patients receiving matched unrelated allogeneic PBSCT after a busulfan or TBI based intensive conditioning. No ATG was used during conditioning and all patients received unmanipulated PBSC on day 0 containing a median of 7.6 x106/kg CD34+ cells (range 3.4-17.9). All patients were given cyclosporine A and methothrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The respective amounts of T-cell subsets in the graft were quantified by flowcytometry and PCR and further correlated with clinical outcome. Results: The grafts contained a median of 11.2 x10 6 /kg CD4+foxp3+ and 9.8 x106/kg gamma/delta TCR+ T-cells, respectively. Patients receiving more CD4+foxp3+ cells had a lower cumulative incidence of acute GVHD II-IV (44% vs. 65%, p=0.03). Interestingly, in patients who received higher concentrations of donor gamma/delta TCR+ T-cells acute GVHD II-IV was more frequent (66% vs. 40%, p=0.02). In multivariate analysis only the graft concentration of gamma/delta TCR+ T-cells (p=0.002) and a positive CMVstatus of the recipient (p=0.03) were significantly associated with the occurrence of acute GVHD II-IV. Conclusion: Graft composition of T-cell subsets seems to affect the outcome of patients receiving allogeneic PBSCT from unrelated donors. Therefore, selective manipulation or add-back of particular subsets might be a promising strategy to reduce the incidence of GVHD. (1) ",

Since apoptosis is the histopathological hallmark in GVHD, we investigated whether the caspase-cleaved neoepitope of cytokeratin 18 fragments (CK18F) released during apoptosis might be a serum marker for ongoing GVHDinduced target organ destruction. Serum CK18F kinetics was monitored by M30 antibody-based ELISA in 51 patients who fulfilled histopathological and/or clinical criteria diagnostic for GvHD. Both intestinal and hepatic GVHD were associated with significant elevations of CK18F levels over baseline (6.3\u00b13.8 fold and 4.6\u00b10.8 fold, respectively), whereas isolated skin GVHD was accompanied by only slight CK18F changes. Responses of hepato-intestinal GVHD to immunosuppressive therapy were mirrored by CK18F decreases. The extent of CK18F increases correlated with serological severity of acute (r=0.96) and chronic (r=0.76) liver GVHD. Clinical conditions that might represent relevant differential diagnoses, such as non-complicated, infectionrelated diarrhea and toxic hyperbilirubinemia were not associated with CK18F rises. In conclusion, CK18F monitoring provides the first marker for quantitative assessment of GVHD-associated apoptotic activity in intestinal and hepatic GVHD and for distinguishing active GVHD from irreversible end organ damage. Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate how CK18F may assist in diagnosis, differentiation, prognosis, and treatment guidance of GVHD. Patients with very high risk hematologic malignancies who cannot find an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor can benefit from haplo-mismatched transplantation. The latter is, however, complicated by frequent and severe infectious complications and disease relapse due to delayed immune reconstitution.",

We present results of an ongoing Phase I clinical trial of haplo-mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) supplemented with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) PDT depleted of host-reactive T cells. Nine high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies (5 AML relapsed or refractory, 2 MDS, 1 NHL, 1 refractory CLL) entered the trial (6 M, 3 F) and are evaluable for acute GVHD and immune reconstitution. Donor mononuclear cells (MNCs) were incubated with recipient MNCs for 4 days, exposed to TH9402 PDT, stored frozen, and administered on day 30 after transplant at graded DLI dose levels: 1x10 4 (1pt), 5x10 4 (3pts), 1.3x10 5 (3pts) and 3.2x10 5 (2pts) CD3+ cells/kg. Anti-host cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) were depleted from DLIs by approximately 1.5 logs, and flow cytometry showed greater than 90% elimination of activated T cells (CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+) by TH9402 PDT. Median age at SCT was 55 years (range: 21-58). The myeloablative regimen consisted of TBI (1200 cGy), thiotepa (5 mg/kg) and fludarabine (40 mg/m 2 /dayx5 days) followed by infusion of CD3 depleted HSC grafts. No GVHD prophylaxis was administered. All patients showed durable trilineage hematologic engraftment and complete donor chimerism. No patient developed acute GVHD (grade II-IV), while 3 patients developed signs of chronic GVHD. Five patients died: one (cohort 1) of a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, one (cohort 2) of relapsed AML, and 3 (cohort 2 and 3) of infectious complications. Two pts recovered greater than 0.3x10 9 CD3+ and CD4+ cells/L at 2 and 5 months post-DLI, and 4 pts had >0.2x10 9 CD3+ cells/L at 6 mo post-DLI. The overall disease-free-survival and survival are 44% at 1 year (median follow-up: 10.3 mo). Our results indicate that the post-transplant infusion of a PDT treated DLI is feasible, does not induce acute GVHD, and may accelerate T cell reconstitution. This PDT strategy could represent an appealing alternative for patients in the higher age range who are at high risk for GVHD.",

In recent reports also acute GvHD (as an expression of alloreactivity) has shown some response to ECP. From 1996 to 2006 we have been treating with ECP 23 patients with steroid-refractory acute GvHD, after receiving a stem cell transplantation from a full matched or 1-antigen mismatched related or unrelated donor. Their median age was 41 (range 18-66) and diagnoses were as follows: 5 chronic myeloid leukemia, 8 acute leukemia, 3 myelodysplastic syndrome, 2 multiple myeloma, 2 myelofibrosis, 3 aplastic anemia; 40% of these patients was not transplanted in complete remission. The median duration of ECP treatment was 6.6 months (range 0-32.8), and the median number of ECP cycles (1 cycle=2 treatments) was 10 (range 1-25). After three months of therapy 56% (13 of 23) of patients improved aGvHD manifestations (52% improved, 4% had a complete resolution). An improvement was obtained in 80% (8 of 10) of patients with global grade II aGvHD, 71% (5 of 7) with grade III and none (0 of 6) with grade IV. 70% of patients with a skin disease responded to ECP treatment, 57% of those with liver aGvHD and 65% with gut involvement (this series had no patients with grade +++ aGvHD of the gut). ECP treatment started after a median time of 56 days (range 14-148) from aGvHD onset; in both groups of patients, treated before and after 56 days, 54% respoded to ECP. Overall survival after a mean follow-up of 24 months (range 11-61) is 52% (12 of 23); seven patients (30%) died of uncontrolled aGvHD during ECP treatment, two patients (9%) died of infection, and two (9%) of disease relapse. Among ECP responding patients 100% progressed into a chronic GvHD (31% had a limited and 69% an extensive diesease); 70% of them achieved a complete resolution of cGvHD manifestations during follow-up, with only 15% discontinuing immunosuppression after 26 to 30 months from stem cell transplantation (SCT). In 46% of patients immunosoppressive therapy could be tapered at a median time of 13 months from SCT(range 5-26). In conclusion : this study confirms that ECP has a role in the management of steroid refractory acute GvHD. Responses are obtained with time and one needs to be patient. We were particularly impressed with responses in patients with gut GvHD. Objectives: pts with cGVHD not responding to steroids have a poor prognosis. Everolimus, (RAD001, Certican) a new mTOR antagonist, only known as immunosuppressant in organ transplantation, has not been used in treatment of pts with GVHD after allo-SCT. Here we report our experience in a retrospective analysis of 14 pts with hematologic malignancies after a median follow up of 17,54 months (range: 6,31-53,7 mo). Pts and methods: 14 pts (AML 7, CML 2, CLL 2, NHL 1, MM 1) with a median age of 48,8 years underwent allo-SCT from April 2002 to December 2005. Myeloablative conditioning was used in 8, reduced-intensity conditioning in 6 pts. All pts received peripheral stem cells, 11 from HLA-identical related donors, 3 from matched unrelated donors. GVHD-prophylaxis consisted of CsA/Mycophenolat (MPA) in 10 pts, CsA/Campath 100 mg in 4 pts. ATG as rejection prophylaxis was used in 4 pts. CMV-serostatus was positive in 9 pts., with seronegative donors in 4. Results: acute GVHD occurred in 10/14 (71,4%), grade II-IV in 6 (42,9). All pts developed cGVHD with limited disease in 3 (21,4%) and extensive disease in 11 (78,6%). At the time of starting treatment with RAD001, all pts were on steroids and under second line therapy with tacrolimus/MPA in 4 (28,6%) or more than second line treatment in 10 (71,4%). The starting dose of Certican was 2 x 0,75 mg/day orally until reaching plasma levels of 3-8 ug/l. Median treatment duration was 154,5 days (range: 4-585). Following adverse events occurred: TTP/HUS/haemolytic anemia (MAHA) in 5 pts (35,7%), hyperlipidemia in 4 ( 28,6%), LDH elevation in 3 (21,4%). Treatment had to be terminated due to adverse event (TTP) in 5 pts (35,7%). CMV infection was observed in 3 with spontaneous resolvement in 2 pts. Outcome: 7 pts are alive, 2 pts died due to GVHD, 5 due to infection. Response of GVHD: CR was achieved in 5 (38%), PR in 2 (15,4%), no change in 2 and progression in 4 (30,8%). Conclusions: we have observed a high overall response of pts with advanced cGVHD under treatment with RAD001, treatment was well tolerated with a high compliance due to application. TTP remains the major problem with an incidence of approximately 35%. Our experience suggests that further prospective studies are warranted.",

Ditschkowski, R. Trenschel, H. Ottinger, D. Beelen University Hospital of Essen (Essen, D) The application of DLI for treatment of relapse is a widely used therapy option after allogeneic transplantation. But one of the major complication of this therapy modality is the occurrence of severe acute GVHD. Here we evaluated the incidence of acute GVHD after adoptive application of DLI with increasing T cell doses post transplantation of highly purified CD34+ cells in patients transplanted from HLA identical siblings for various haematological diseases. DLI was applied with a starting dose of CD3+ 3,3x 105 at day 90, thereafter DLI was administered at day 135 post transplant and in case of MRD or relapse. 57 patients transplanted for CML (n=52), AML (n=2), ALL (n=1) and multiple myeloma (n=2) received DLI afer transplantation. 19% of the patients had a progressive disease stage at time point of transplantation and 81% a standard disease stage at time point of transplantation. DLI was applied five times at median (range1-8) with increasing T cell doses. At median a T cell dose of 3,3 x106 CD3+ cells/kg/BW were applied until a haematological or molecular response was achieved. After transplantation acute GVHD grade 1 was diagnosed in 15% of patients and acute GVHD grade 2 in 3% of patients. In none of the patients a GVHD grade 3-4 occurred, whereas 85% of the patients had no GVHD. After DLIs, acute GVHD grade 1 was diagnosed in 18% if patients and acute GVHD grade 2 in 14% of patients. Severe GVHD occurred in 12% of the patients, whereas no GVHD was seen in 56% of the patients after DLI. Four of the seven patients who suffered from severe GVHD died. The estimate to develop a GVHD grade2-4 after transplantation and DLI was only 27%. A haematological disease reoccurrence were found in 14% only. The concept of transplantation if highly purified CD34+ cells and adoptive DLI was associated with a low five-year estimate for TRM and disease free survival of 80% for all patients and 90% for CML-patients. Introduction and aim: Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is the most common late complication of allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplantation (AHCT). The most characteristic expression of cutaneous involvement in cGVHD includes lichenoid and/or sclerodermatous manifestations, pigment and mucosal changes. Lichenoid lesions usually occur in early cGVHD and clinically resemble idiopatic lichen planus. Patients with cutenous changes showing all the typical histological aspects of lichenoid GVHD seem to have a worse prognosis.",

It is characterized by fibrosis and in severe forms patients mobility and quality of life is affected. In this study we retrospectively analysed the demographic data and life expectancy of patients with chronic skin GVHD according to type of their skin involvement proven by skin biopsies. Method and results: Allogeneic transplants performed in 428 patients between 1988-2006 in our center. Mean age 31.2 (5-64) years, M/F: 248/180, diagnosis were 144 CML, 148 AML, 50 ALL, 22 SAA, 20 MDS, 11 MM, 6 lymphoma, 5 FAA and 22 other diseases. 357 of the patients received ablative conditioning mostly busulphan based non-TBI regimens with short term CSA and MTX GVHD prophylaxis. We observed cGvHD in 160 out of 314 patients surviving after +100th day at postranplantation;114 (71.3%) had limited and 46 (28.7%) had extensive cGVHD. All donors were HLA identical siblings. Stem cell source was periperal blood in 245 and bone marrow in 183 of the patients. In our patient cohort chronic GVHD incidence was 50.9 %. In the cGVHD group 32.5 % (n=52) of the patients had skin involvement. Distrubution of these 52 patients according to histopatologic diagnosis were 61.5% lichenoid, 23.1% sclerodermoid and 15.4% were other hystopathologic types. Patient characteristic were summarized in the table. All patients received MP\u00b1CSA for initial treatment. Mycophenolate mofetil was given to patients steroid-refractory or dependent cases. ECP was applied to steroid refractory or intolerant progressive patients. Conclusion: Our 52 patients with pathologically proven and histologically subgrouped cutaneous cGVHD did not differ in terms of long term transplant outcome. We conducted a phase II trial to test the role of second line treatment using mcophenolate mofetil (MMF) associated or not to FK506 in steroid resistant aGVHD in 53 patients. Four criteria of steroid-resistant aGVHD were defined: A) no improvement of signs of skin GVHD after one week of treatment with prednisolone 2mg/kg; B) signs of skin progression or no response of visceral (gut or liver) GVHD 3 days after treatment; C) visceral signs of progression 2 days after treatment; D) progression to organ stage 4, 1 day after treatment. Response of signs of aGVHD to MMF (30mg/kg/day) or FK506 (0.05mg/kg/day) was defined as complete remission (CR)(all organs); partial remission (PR) or failure (progression even in only one organ). HSCT were performed between 1999 and 2004 for patients with hematological malignancies (73%) or aplastic syndromes (27%). Median age was 29y(5-58) and median follow-up was 24mo . The donor was HLA identical in 43% and unrelated in 57%. Myeloablative regimen was used in 77%. As GVHD prophylaxis CsA+MTX was used in 26 patients, CsA alone in 14 and in 3 patients CsA+steroids. Bone Marrow cells were used in 62%, PB in 25% and Cord Blood in 13%. Treatment of aGVHD consisted of prednisolone 2mg/kg IV in all patients associated to CsA. Once criteria of resistance were established, CsA was stopped and replaced by MMF and/or FK506. FK was not added if renal insufficiency was observed. Criteria of steroid-resistant aGVHD were A in 7 patients; B in 26; C in 19, and D in 1 patient. Steroid resistant acute GVHD grade I was observed in 9 patients(17%); II in 26(49%); III in 19(36%) and IV in 3(6%). MMF was used in 15 patients(28%) and associated to FK506 in 38(72%). Median time to start second line treatment was 16days (7-100). CR in skin was observed in 74% of the patients, 66% in gut and 75% in liver. However, overall CR was observed in 21 patients (40%), partial response in 5 (9%) and failure in 27 (51%). Median time to obtain CR/ PR was 8 d(2-20). Cumulative incidence of CR was 39%. Age, CMV status, source of cells, conditioning regimen, HLA incompatibility and MMF alone or associated to FK were not associated with CR. Overall survival was 35\u00b17%; it was 74\u00b110% for 21 patients achieving CR; 5\u00b14% for 27 non-responders and 1 out 5 patients with PR. In conclusion, use of MMF and/or FK506 is an option to treat steroid resistant GVHD but did not result in 1-year survival that would justify to set-up a larger randomized study.",

            "text": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a major cause of mortality after allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT). IPS pathophysiology includes the secretion of inflammatory cyto-and chemokines along with the recruitment of donor T cells and monocytes/macrophages. We have previously shown, that inflammatory CC-and CXC-chemokines, increasingly expressed in the lungs after allo-SCT, play a critical role in this context, as abrogating the interaction of only one of these chemokines with its respective receptor was able to partially reduce pulmonary injury. The novel broad spectrum chemokine inhibitor (BSCI) BIM-58001 suppresses the in vitro-and in vivo-migration of leukocytes in response to several CC-and CXC-chemokines. We therefore hypothesized, that after allo SCT the administration of BIM-58001 inhibits chemokine-induced migration of donor effector cells to the lung, thereby reducing injury and improving pulmonary function (PF). Lethally irradiated B6D2F1 mice were transplanted with either syngeneic (syn) B6D2F1 or allo C57BL/6 bone marrow and T cells. IPS progressively developed in allo recipients until week 6. Chemokine expression of MCP-1, RANTES, Mip-1 alpha peaked around day + 14, whereas Mig and IP-10 levels remained continuously elevated. Next, animals were treated with either BIM-58001 or vehicle control (vc) from day 0 to day +14, analyzed on day +42 and histopathological changes were correlated with PF. Compared to vc and BIM-58001 treated syn controls, allo recipients treated with vc showed significant damage to the lung with increased inflammatory cell infiltrates in the alveoli, interstitial spaces, around vessels and around bronchial structures. These changes correlated with impaired PF (figure 1). In contrast, when treated with BIM-58001, allo recipients demonstrated a clear reduction in pulmonary pathology along with PF improvement. Next, we assessed the effect of BIM-58001 treatment later during IPS development by giving BIM-58001 or vc from day +15 until day +42. Again, animals were analyzed on day +42 for histopathological changes and PF. Interestingly, this time no significant S108 differences were seen between groups after allo-SCT, suggesting that interrupting early chemokine signalling is more efficient. In conclusion, our data show, that usage of BSCI may provide a new tool in the prevention and treatment of IPS, and that early intervention is critical to hinder the cascade of events during IPS development.",

Jenke, P. Lorenz, A. Kiani, J. Schetelig, G. Ehninger, E. Schleyer, M. Bornh\u00e4user University Hospital Dresden (Dresden, D) Purpose: We performed a prospective phase I/II trial targeting daily MMF doses according to MPA AUC levels. Patients and Methods: Twenty-nine patients (18 male, 11 female) with a median age of 53 years were included. The indication for allogeneic transplantation from matched sibling (n=7) and unrelated donors (n=22) was high-risk AML/MDS (n=19) or relapsed lymphoma/multiple myeloma (n=10). Conditioning therapy included 30 mg/m\u00b2 Fludarabine on days -9 to -6 combined with intravenous Busulfan 3.45 mg/kg from day -5 to day -2. Tacrolimus was given orally starting on day -1 in order to achieve trough blood levels of 5-10 ng/ml. MMF was started on day 0 at 3 g intravenously bid. AUC measurements of MPA and its metabolite MPAG by HPLC were scheduled on day 4, 7, and 11 after transplantation. The MMF dose was modified in order to achieve an AUC of 35-60 \u00b5g/ml*h. Results: The dose of MMF had to be increased in 15/29 (52%) patients to 3.5-5 g every 12 hours on day 5. No patient required a reduction of dosing on day 4. With the respective dose adjustments 36% and 80% of patients reached the AUC target on day 7 and 11, respectively. There was no direct association between dose level and extramedullary toxicity. Early grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 4 patients and lead to a reduction of MMF back to 2 g bid, although a direct association to the study drug was difficult to prove given the direct toxic effects of the preceding conditioning regimen. Trilineage engraftment and complete donor chimerism was observed in 28 out of 29 patients included. Only one out seven patients with a matched related donor experienced acute GvHD > grade II, which was due to non-compliance in the outpatient setting. The respective proportion of grade III-IV acute GvHD in the unrelated setting was 7/28 (25%). With a median follow-up of 18 months 15 (52%) patients are alive and 14 are in complete remission. So far, 8 out of 24 evaluable patients (33%) suffer from limited (n=3) or extensive (n=5) chronic GvHD. A retrospective analysis revealed a significant correlation between Cmax levels and the AUC for MPA (r=0.48; p<0.0001). The respective target Cmax was shown to be between 16 and 25 \u00b5g/ml. Conclusion: Given the high-risk patient population with 70% unrelated donors, the clinical results observed with the combination of tacrolimus and MMF as prophylactic regimen are encouraging. A simplified MMF targeting strategy based on MPA Cmax levels seems to be warranted in future trials.",

Fuji, S. Kim, S. Mori, T. Fukuda, R. Tanosaki, Y. Heike, K. Tobinai, Y. Takaue National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: In a mouse model, Ferrara et al. clearly showed that inflammatory cytokines play a primary role in the afferent and effector phases of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). In the human setting, C-reactive protein (CRP) is a simple and reliable marker of inflammation, represented by infectious diseases, when the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IL-6, is increased. In our routine transplant procedure, the CRP level is measured serially at least three times a week. In this study, the correlation between the pre-engraftment CRP value and clinical events was analyzed to test whether the CRP value could be used as a practical surrogate marker of inflammation that leads to post-transplant complications including aGVHD. Methods: The data from a cohort of 118 consecutive adult patients with hematological malignancies who were treated between January 2002 and July 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. Sixteen patients were excluded due to graft failure, preexisting neutropenia and previous allogeneic transplant. The remaining 102 patients (median age, 36 y; 18-57 y) were categorized according to the maximum CRP value during neutropenia before engraftment. All patients received myeloablative conditioning regimens including TBI-based (n=49) and non-TBI-based (n=53) regimens. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine-(n=71) and tacrolimusbased regimens (n=31). The \"low CRP\" group (CRP < 15 mg/dl) included 70 patients and the \"high CRP\" group (CRP>15 mg/dl) included 32 patients. The primary endpoint of this study was the occurrence of grade II-IV aGVHD. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Results: Grade II-IV and grade III-IV aGVHD were both more frequent in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group (p<0.001 and p=0.047, respectively). A Cox proportional hazard model showed that a high CRP level and HLAmismatch were associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV aGVHD. OS tended to be worse in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group (p=0.08). NRM was significantly higher in the high CRP group than in the low CRP group (p=0.004). A Cox proportional hazard model showed that a high CRP level and older age were associated with a high NRM rate. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the pre-engraftment CRP value in humans reflects inflammation that could lead to the development of aGVHD and subsequent NRM, as has been proposed in a mouse model. The goal in GvHD prophylaxis is to find a combination of immunosuppressive (IS) drugs, which preserve a high graft versus malignancy (GvM)-effect with no, tolerable or curable GvHD. Alemtuzumab (MabCampathTM) was introduced in combination with calcineurin antagonists for GvHDprophylaxis in high-doses resulting in a high rate of primary graft failure, posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD), viral infections and relapse. Within a protocol we used low dose Alemtuzumab in combination with CSA starting with 2x20mg/d (day-2 and day -1, group 40)(10/2002 -06/2005), deescalating the dose to 2x10mg/d (day -2 and day -1, group 20) (07/2005 -05 /2006) and since June 2006 to 10mg/d on day -1(group 10) in HLA identical sibling or MUD alloTX. Patients: Overall, 174 consecutive pts. (group 40 n=74; group 20 n= 65; group 10 n=35) received after a mainly fludarabinebased reduced intensity conditioning (99%; 98%; 94%) a graft (PBSC in 99%) from a sibling (40%; 32%; 23%) or MUD (60%; 68%; 77%). Diagnosis were mainly AML/MDS (40%; 78%; 77%) or lymphoma/MM (51%; 23%; 14%). Remission at TX was mainly advanced disease stage/ >CR1 (92%; 86%; 87%), also reflected by the fact that within each group 45%, 22% and 37% received their second transplantation, respectively. All pts. received standard care including aciclovir prophylaxis till day +100, PjP-prophylaxis starting day +25 and weekly CMV-PCR diagnostic procedures. Results: Primary graft failure was observed in one pt. each in groups 40 and 10; both have been rescued with an additional graft. The incidence of acute GvHD II-IV and III-IV was identical in each group (23% and 8% in group 40, 25% and 8% in group 20, 23% and 8% in group 10), respectively. Until day +100 30 pts. died (17pts.; 7pts.; 6pts.). Comparing the groups causes of death were relapse (44%; 43%; 57%), non-viral-infection (17%; 29%; 0%), viral infection (17%; 0%;14%), aGvHD (6%; 0%; 0%) and others (17%; 29%; 29%). In group 40 (n=3) and group 20 (n=4) PTLDs was observed. CMV reactivation was treated in up to 53% of the pts. at risk (recipient and/or donor with positive CMV-serology) Conclusion: Dose deescalation of Alemtuzumab as part of our GvHD-prophylaxis from 40mg to 10mg absolutely, is feasible, with low incidence of acute GvHD in all dose groups for MUD as well as in sibling alloTX.",

We present our preliminary results with a direct depletion procedure using antiCD3/antiCD19 coated magnetic microbeads and the CliniMACS device. Only patients with high risk malignancies (n=30, most of them had active disease or relapsed after previous trp.) or with nonmalignant diseases and high risk of graft failure (n=2) were included. The diagnoses were: AML/MDS/CML (n=16), ALL(n=6), relapsed Neuroblastoma / Ewing-/ Rhabdomyosarcoma (n=8), SAA, PNH (n=2); Remission status: NR=11, 2nd transplantation=10, CR/CP1=3, CR2-4=6. The patients received either TBI or Bu based standard conditioning regimens (n=9) or a toxicity reduced protocol (Flud, TT, Mel, OKT3, MMF, n=23). The grafts comprised a median number of 16x10 6 /kg (7-41) stem cells as well as high amounts of NK-cells (137x10 6 (9-550)) with 49x10 3 /kg (7-200) residual CD3+ cells and <0.01% CD20+ cells. Primary engraftment occurred in 90% of patients (after reconditioning and second stem cell donation: 100%). Median time to reach >500 neutrophiles/ul and independence from platelet substitution was 11 and 9 days respectively. Recovery of CD3+ cells was favorable (d90: 320/ul, d180: 600/ul). Acute GvHD grade 0-1 occurred in 72%, 25% had GvHD grade II and one patient had grade III. Limited chronic GvHD occurred in 4 patients. No transplant related mortality (TRM) and, in particular, no lethal infections were observed. 17/32 patients (53%) were alive with a median follow up of 0.6 years (0.2 -2.9). Single cause of death was relapse. Disease status was predictive: 9/12 patients with leukemias and active disease relapsed, whereas only 2/10 patients in CR relapsed. 4/8 patients with solid tumors are alive. The toxicity-reduced conditioning regimen helped to avoid TRM, despite intensive pretreatment (including previous transplantation) of the patients. Conclusions: our preliminary results indicate that CD3/CD19 selected grafts can improve immune reconstitution and TRM. Engraftment rates similar to that of patients with myeloablative standard conditioning regimens and positive selected haploidentical stem cells could be achieved, although most patients of the study group received an intensity reduced regimen. However, the outcome was poor in patients with active disease. Thus, further options have to be investigated to increase the potential antileukemic activity of donor derived effector cells.",

We investigated previously described post HSCT complication related genetic polymorphisms and compared the frequency of developing non-infectious pulmonary dysfunction (NIPD), acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) with that of allele frequency and clinical factors in Japanese population. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of complication and donor/recipients polymorphisms of ACE, GSTM1, S110 NOD2/CARD15, FCLR3, VDR, PAI1, CD14 and some cytokines and chemokine (TNFa, IL1a, IL6, IL10, RANTES) in 126 Japanese patients who underwent HSCT from HLAidentical sibling donor. Clinical factors such as recipient age, gender mismatch, disease stage and conditioning regimen were included in the analysis. NIPD patients were high frequent rate of the genotype of ACE DD, IL6-634 GG, and TNFa-857 AA or CA (p = 0.0017, 0.048 and 0.048 respectively). GSTM1 null genotype was significantly low frequency among sever aGVHD (grade III to IV) patients (p = 0.012). FCLR3 CC genotype was significantly low frequency among cGVHD patients (p = 0.0080). Although previous studies demonstrated strong evidence of the association between NOD2/CARD15 SNP13 and sever aGVHD, we could not find the SNP among Japanese population. To decide NOD2/CARD15 haplotype in Japanese, we typed new three SNPs based on international HapMap project.

            "text": "Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising candidates for a growing spectrum of regenerative and immunomodulatory cellular therapies. Translation of auspicious experimental results into clinical applications has been limited by the dependence of MSC propagation from fetal bovine serum (FBS). We analyzed the capacity of human platelet lysate (HPL) to replace FBS for clinical scale MSC propagation. HPL could be efficiently produced from buffy coats. Multiplex analyses allowed delineating a distinct HPL growth factor profile. Using a previously established two-step clinical scale procedure, HPL was reproducibly more efficient than FBS in supporting MSC outgrowth. Using only 3 x 10 5 primary culturederived MSC we obtained mean 4.36 \u00b1 0,51 x 10 8 MSC within a single secondary 11-13 day culture step. Although morphologically distinct, HPL-MSC and FBS-MSC did not differ significantly regarding immunophenotype, differentiation potential in vitro and lack of tumorigenicity in nude mice in vivo. Replacing FBS with HPL excludes bovine prion, viral and zoonose contamination of the stem cell product. This new efficient FBS-free two-step-procedure for clinical scale MSC propagation will largely facilitate rational clinical testing of MSC based therapies. Based on this protocol a clinical trial for the treatment of steroid-refractory Graft versus Host Disease with HPL-MSC has been initiated. In this pilot study we investigated the feasibility and clinical value of an intensive regimen for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis in unmanipulated bone marrow transplantation from HLA-haploidentical related donor. Eleven patients with a median age of 35 years (12-59) were transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (n=8), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=1), myelodisplastic syndrome (n=1) and plasmacell leukemia (n=1). All donors were HLA identical at 1 haplotype and mismatched for 2 or 3 loci on the unshared haplotype. The conditioning regimen consisted of Cytarabine 3 g/sqm/d for 3 days and Cyclophosphamide 45 mg/Kg/d for 2 days combined with 10 Gy fractionated-total body irradiation (n=4), or Treosulfan 14 g/sqm/d for 3 days (n=3) or i.v Busulfan 3,2 mg/Kg/d for 3 days (n=2) Because of graft failure following a double haploidentical T-cell depleted or an autologous PBSC transplant, 2 patients were prepared with Fludarabine alone 40 mg/sqm/d for 3 days. As part of the conditioning regimen, all patients received Fresenius antithymocyte globulin at 5 mg/Kg/d from day -4 to -1. As GvHD prophylaxis, the patients received Cyclosporine at 1,5-3 mg/Kg/day i.v. from day -7 to +28 and orally at 5 mg/Kg until day +365; Methotrexate 15 mg/sqm on day +1 and 10 mg/sqm on day +3, +6 and +11; Mycophenolate mofetil 1 g/d from day +7 to +100; Basiliximab 20 mg i.v. on day 0 and +4. Donors were primed with Filgrastim at 3-4 microg/Kg/d from day -7 to -1. Bone marrow cells were infused fresh and unmanipulated. The median dose of nucleated cells, CD34+ and CD3+ cells was 6,6x108/kg (1, (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) 8) , 2,3x106/Kg (1, 06) and 30, 8x106/Kg (16, 6) respectively. Ten patients engrafted with a median time of 21 days to reach >0.5 x109/L PMNs and 26 days to reach >25x109/L platelets. Six patients had no evidence of acute GvHD and 4 showed clinical manifestation of grade I. No patient had evidence of chronic GvHD. Two patients (18%) died, 1 of septic shock on day +8 and 1 of multi-organ failure on day 35. Nine out of 11 patients are now living and doing well in hematological remission after a median follow-up of 122 days (range, 35-479). The small number of patients described here does not permit any final conclusion. Nevertheless, the regimen of GVHD prophylaxis seems to be very effective in the setting of the unmanipulated haploidentical transplant.",

            "text": "Successful therapy of steroid-refractory acute graftversus-host disease with sequential alemtuzumab R. Repp, A. Claviez, N. Schub, B. Gahn, A. Schrauder, M. Gramatzki University of Kiel (Kiel, D) After allogeneic stem cell transplantation severe acute graftversus-host disease (GvHD) is the major limitation of this treatment modality. While in acute GvHD addition of steroids to immunosuppressive prophylaxis lead to a response rate of 30% to 70%, treatment options of steroid resistant acute GvHD are limited and no accepted standard for salvage therapy exists. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a commercially available humanized antibody targeting the CD52 antigen, which is expressed on T-cells, B-cells and on some monocyte derived dendritic cells. For years, Alemtuzumab has been shown to be effective in GvHD prevention when used in conditioning regimes, however infectious complications did limit this approach when routinely applied. In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of sequential alemtuzumab for severe acute GvHD, ten patients with steroid-resistant acute GvHD of grade III or IV involving the gut or/and liver were treated in our Division. The initial three patients, all with advanced grade IV GvHD of the liver and already receiving cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and high-dose steroids, were treated with up to 80 mg of alemtuzumab followed by additional 40 mg CD52 antibody within the next four weeks. While dramatic clinical responses were seen, such as a bilirubin level of 48 mg/dl returning to normal within 6 weeks, virus reactivation and bacterial infections were limiting this approach. Although pronounced lymphocyte depletion seems inevitable for efficacy, additional patients were treated with lower doses of 20 to 30 mg Alemtuzumab, repeated approximately every two weeks, while concomitant immunosuppressive drugs could be tapered within 3 to 4 weeks. Acute GvHD improved in all patients treated so far. A complete response of liver and gut GvHD was seen in two patients, an additional patient developed a vanishing bile duct syndrome but has no S111 evidence of ongoing GvHD. Another two patients are still on treatment with major improvement of gut and liver-GVHD, respectively. Thus, alemtuzumab given sequentially in moderate doses shows promising activity in severe, steroid refractory acute GvHD. However, monitoring for infectious complications, particularly by reactivated viruses (CMV, adenovirus) is mandatory for months after treatment. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) is a frequent and often serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). While the impact of HLA-A,B,C mismatches at the antigen (i.e. low resolution or 2 digits) and the allelic (i.e. high resolution or 4 digits) level on acute GvHD has been intensively studied, corresponding data for chronic GvHD (cGvHD)are sparse. Thus, the impact of HLA-A,B,C allele mismatches on cGvHD risk was studied in a cohort of 177 consecutive unrelated transplants by means of uni-and multivariate statistical analysis. The entry critera of the study were as follows: Patient age > 15 years, underlying disease CML, AML or ALL, no graft manipulation (e.g. no T-cell depletion), use of standard regimens for conditioning (total body irradiation 4 x 2.5 Gy plus cyclophosphamide) and GvHD prophylaxis (CSA plus short course MTX), donorrecipient HLA-identity according to our pre-transplant typing routine (i.e. identity of HLA-A,B,C at the antigen and of DRB1,DQB1 at the allelic level). Retrospective sequence based typing was used to assess the HLA-A,B,C alleles of donors and recipients. Impact of allele mismatches on outcome was evaluated after stratification for nil, one and two or more discrepancies. Enrolled into the analysis were n=138 patients surviving day 100 post transplant of whom n=90 (65%) developed cGvHD (de novo/ secondary chronic n=5/n=133, limited/extended (n=54/n=36) respectively. Cross table analysis/ Fisher`s exact test revealed a clear correlation of cGvHD with acute GvHD (p<0.001), but only a trend towards an increased risk of cGVHD incidence with increasing number of HLA-A,B,C allele mismatches (p=0.08 with 0,1 and two or more mismatches being present in about 46%, 34% and 19% of the cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis could also confirm this trend (p=0.06). After correction for disease status, multivariate stepwise backward analysis excluded patient and donor age as well as stem cell source and sex mismatch from the Cox model, leaving the number of allele mismatches as the only independent risk factor for cGvHD (RR: 1.2, p=0.2, i.e. not significant). Thus (1) if present at all HLA-A,B,C allele mismatches have only a very moderate biological impact on cGvHD risk and (2) donors with these type of mismatches should not be excluded from donation in clinically urgent settings if no fully matched donor is available in time. Auto/alloimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory liver disease characterized histological by a dense mononuclear cell infiltrate in the portal tract and serological by the presence of non-organ and liver-specific antibodies, high transaminases and increased levels of IgG. The relation between allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and auto/alloimmune disease is complex. To examine this association, we retrospectively studied 1,189 allogeneic patients (median age 41, range 15-68 years) between May 1996 and December 2005. Among these patients, 243 (20.4%) developed hepatic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (124 pts had a hepatic GvHD of grade > II). We followed 25 patients (11 male, 14 female) in whom GvHD of the liver presented with marked elevation of serum aminotransferases, clinically resembling acute hepatitis and auto/antibodies characteristics for AIH. The median age at transplant was 35.0 (range, 16-54) years. Onset of liver dysfunction was at 286 days (range, 55-2766) after HSCT. Median peak serum was 312 (range 105-1750) U/L for alanine aminotransferase, 629 (133-2410) U/L for gamma-glutamyl transferase and 1.74 (0.5-23.4) mg/dl for bilirubin. The autoantibody profiles of AIH were 60% for anti-nuclear antibody, 44% for antibodies to liverkidney microsomes, 24% for antibodies to smooth-muscle antigens, 28% for anti-mitochondrial antibody, 16% for antibodies to actin, 8% for antibodies to nucleoli, and 4% for other autoantibodies. AIH had a higher prevalence in younger and in female patients. AIH occurred in 92% in patients, who were transplanted with G-CSF mobilized and peripherally collected stem cells (PSC), but in only 8% in patients with bone marrow (BM) source (p<0.02), comparing all transplanted patients (922 PSC, 267 BM). Stem cell grafts from matched sibling donor or matched unrelated donor were similar in the two groups. Acute GvHD of grade > II occurred more frequently in the groups with AIH (15/25 vs. 489/1189, p<0.002), and chronic GvHD (11 limited, 14 extensive) was ascertained in all AIH patients vs. 43.7% in all transplanted patients (p<0.0001). Three patients with AIH died from pulmonary bleeding, chronic GvHD, and relapse, whereas 22 patients with AIH are still alive (88%) at a median survival time of 2570 days. In conclusion, our evaluation confirms a strong association between G-CSF mobilized PSC, chronic GvHD and the development of AIH. Non classical HLA-G Class I molecules exert their immunomodulatory function by interaction with certain receptors on immune effector cells. These molecules are encoded by a gene mapped on the short arm of Chromosome 6, telomeric to the classical HLA-A, -B, and -C genes. HLA-G allelic variants may be also characterized by a 14 bp deletioninsertion polymorphism located in the 3' UT region of the HLA-G gene. The presence of the 14 bp insertion is known to generate an additional splice whereby 92 bases are removed from the start of exon 8. HLA-G mRNAs having the 92-base deletion are more stable than the complete mRNA forms, suggesting that this region may be involved in the mechanisms controlling post-transcriptional regulation of HLA-G molecule associated with allelic variants. We investigated the influence of the 14bp deletion/insertion polymorphism on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients affected by thalassemia major. Forty-five thalassemia patients transplanted from an unrelated donor were enrolled in the study. The conditioning regimen was the same in all patients. All donor/recipient pairs were HLA class I and II complitely identical at molecular level. All donor/ recipient pairs were analyzed for the presence of the 14bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the HLA-G gene. Out of 45 transplanted patients, 32 (71%) are thalassemia free survivall, 7 rejected, 6 patients died. 12 (27%) developed grade II-IV acute GvHD. The frequencies of the 14bp deletion or insertion were 55% and 45% respectively, which was analogous to that found in other studies. Ninety percent of the recipients had the same polymorphism as their donor. Patients that were homozygous or heterozygous for the 14bp deletion had a higher risk of developing GvHD compared to patients with the 14bp insertion (RR = 18.20; 95% CI 0.88 -375.17; p = 0.019). The frequency of rejection was similar in the two groups of examined patients. The number of genetic factors capable of influencing the outcome of HSCT is steadily rising. Careful evaluation of the KIR gene profile, the 14 bp polymorphism of the HLA-G gene and the interleukin 10 promotor in donor/recipient pairs should make it possible to better assess the risk for GvHD and/or rejection and consequently, to adjust immunosuppressive therapy, all of which will most certainly reflect positively on the outcome of transplantation. Background: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used successfully for reconstitution of haematolymphopoiesis in the bone marrow and provides curative therapy for a number of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Preconditioning of the recipient with a proper preparative regimen is an essential prerequisite for HSCT. Transplantation related complications such as graft versus host disease (GVHD), drug toxicity, veno-oclussive disease, hypothyroidism, cataract, pulmonary complication, and hemorrhagic cystitis are limiting factors for HSCT. At the present the majority of GVHD mice models are based on the use of radiotherapy as a conditioning regimen. However, these models can't cover the variety of HSCT in clinical settings. Many patients are conditioned with chemotherapy, which may affect the occurrence and rate of transplantation related complications. Aims: To establish a mice model of GVHD using the chemotherapy as conditioning regimen. Methods: Female BALB/c and male C57BL/6 mice were used in the study. Group I-IV considered for allogeneic BMT and group V and VI considered for syngeneic BMT. Group I-IV included dose escalation of busulfan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy). Conditioning started at day -7 days using Bu 20 or 25 mg/kg/day for four days followed by Cy 100 or 150 mg/kg/day for two days in the allogeneic setting. Syngeneic control mice received Bu 20 or 25 mg/kg/day for four days followed by Cy 100 mg/kg/day for two days. Both Bu and Cy administrated as IP. GVHD was studied by histological analysis of skin, intestine and liver. The chimerism and engraftment were surveyed by FACS analysis. The plasma levels of cytokine were measured by Multiplex illumination assay. Results: Symptoms of acute GVHD started at day + 5 post transplantation. GVHD signs were found as histological changes in affected organs in all allogeneic transplanted mice but none of the syngeneic groups. Engraftment, H-2Kb (donor MHC class I) versus H-2Kd (recipient MHC class I) was established successfully in all groups and found from day +7. Mortality rate increased by increment of conditioning dose and survival was poorest in group II and IV (Bu 20-Cy 150 and Bu25-Cy150, mg/kg/day). Conclusion: We have established a new mouse model of GVHD using chemotherapy that is compatible of conditioning in human. This model can also be used to study the basic mechanisms underlying GVHD that might be caused by the effect of the conditioning regimen on different cell sub-populations.",

Aker, M. Bitan, I. Zilberman, S. Miron, L. Yoffe, A. Levovic, S. Slavin, A. Verstandig Hadassah -Hebrew University (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: It has been previously shown by us, that intraarterial (IA) targeted steroid therapy may be useful even in steroid refractory hepatic graft vs. host disease (GVHD). In the 1st protocol, an intermediate dose steroid with low dose methotrexate was used (protocol I). Due to suspected toxicity of methotrexate, it was omitted and substituted with high dose steroids (protocol II). Patients and methods: 7 patients with steroid resistant/dependent GVHD were treated with protocol I and 13 with protocol II at time of analysis. Serum bilirubin level was followed for the evaluation of efficacy. Results: Median time from stem cell transplantation (SCT) to IA and from GVHD to IA tended to be longer in the patients treated with protocol II. No life threatening event was seen with protocol II. Four out of 7 and 10/12 patients responded to the treatment (protocol I and protocol II respectively - figure  1 ). There was a trend toward faster time to response in the patients treated with protocol II (table 1). one out of 7 and 7/12 patients are long term survivors in the 2 protocols respectively. Conclusion: Intra-arterial catheter guided steroid therapy for steroid resistant/dependent GVHD with high dose steroids is at least as good as intermediate dose steroids with methotrexate and may be safer. Among 372 consecutive recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, grafted between January 2000 and September 2005, 340 patients survived more than 3 months after HSCT and were included in the study. Both pediatric and adult patients were included. The median age was 38 (1-67) years. There were 206 males and 134 females. Among the donors 194 were unrelated and 146 related. Myeloablative conditioning was used in 190 and RIC in 150 patients. The stem cell sources were; PBSC in 226, bone marrow in 101 and cord blood in 13. Most of the patients had a haematological malignancy (n=252), but 45 had a non malignant disorder and 43 a solid tumor. A total of 98 (27%) patients developed cGVHD, 79 (81%) mild, 14 (14%) moderate and 5 (5%) severe. The 3-year overall survival in patients without cGVHD was 58% and in patients with mild, moderate and severe it was 74%, 71% and 60% (p=0.02), respectively. We analyzed 18 potential risk factors for cGVHD. In the multivariate analysis, a sibling donor (RH, 1.69, 95% CI, 1.13-2.52; p=0.01), recipient age >40 years (RH, 1.58; CI 1.03-2.43; p=0.04) and year of HSCT (RH, 0.88; CI 0.78-0.99; p=0.04) were independent risk factors for all grades of cGHVD. However, in the PBSC group the 3-year probability of cGVHD were 41% vs 24% in recipients of BM, but PBSC were not a significant risk-factor in multivariate analysis; (RH, 1.62; CI 0.97-2.71, p=0.06). Surprisingly, the risk for developing cGVHD at our center has decreased during the more recent years in spite of the increased use of PBSC. The reason for the increased cGVHD risk in sibling transplants might be due to the shorter immunosuppressive treatment, usually 2 months vs. 6 months after an unrelated transplantation.",

Bilger, A. Laplace, B. Lioure, A. Bohbot, V. Liu, P. Lutz, N. Entz Werle, N. Cojean, R. Herbrecht CHU de Hautepierre (Strasbourg, F) The recent article by Couriel et al and the NIH consensus renew interest and motivation for the evaluation of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in the management of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD. We report 22 cases of steroid refractory GVHD, including 2 patients with acute GVHD, treated by ECP between 1996 and 2006. Median age was 45 years (15-58), 7/22 patients were female. Twelve patients received myeloablative regimens and 10 reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Only 3/22 patients had a matched unrelated donor. Stem cell source was bone marrow in 7 patients and peripherical blood in 15 patients. All patients received ECP using the Therakos system. Median time between transplantation and start of ECP was 482 days (51-2784). Of the 20 patients treated for extensive cGHVD, 13 presented a progressive and 7 a de novo form.The schedule of ECP was 2 procedures every 2 weeks for 3 months, 2 procedures per month for 6 months and 2 every 2 months for 1 year.All patients were evaluated by the same two physicians. The organs involved were the skin in all patients with a sclerodermal form in 6 cases, the mouth in 15 patients, the eyes in 8 patients, the liver in 5 patients and the lung in 2 patients. No gastrointestinal GVHD was initially observed. Patients received a median number of 32 procedures (10-44) in a median of 406 (61-876) days. The response rate by organ was 88% for oral mucosa, 80% for eyes, 73% for skin, 60% for liver; however 6 patients progressed with pulmonary GVHD. Using the criteria of Rubegni et al to evaluate the overall response, the ECP was determinant in 3 patients (14%), good in 8 patients (36%) and ineffective in 11 patients (50%). The median follow up was 22 months (5-57),the overall survival was 51% at 3 years; the survival for responders vs non-responders was 68% vs 38% (p=0.047) Nine patients died, 2 from relapse. When we examined patient characteristics and correlation with response, we found no difference with respect to age,type of conditioning regimen, source of cells,Akpek prognostic score and time of transplant to ECP. Only de novo onset cGVHD correlated with response. Thus, our results confirm the data of ECP in cGVHD in overall response and response rate by organ with large differences in efficacy according to the type of organ involved, better survival for responders. It is difficult, however, to find predictive factors for response and to define time to response. Introduction: Classically the conditioning for transplantation has been myeloablative, but this has been associated with substantial transplant related mortality, particularly from GvHD. Reduced intensity conditioning is immunosuppressive and has lower treatment related mortality (TRM), but is associated with high rates of GvHD and disease recurrence. To better decide on conditioning strategies, we prospectively studied the outcome of patients who received similar GvHD prophylaxis after myeloablative conditioning. Patients & methods: Patients with haematological malignancies, in remission or still responsive to chemotherapy, who had an HLA identical sibling were offered T-cell depleted stem cell grafts. Conditioning was with ablative doses of either chemotherapy or total body radiotherapy. Stem cells were mobilised with G-CSF (5-10ug/kg x 5) and grafts were harvested by large volume apheresis. GvHD prophylaxis was by \"ex vivo\" incubation of grafts with CAMPATH-1 H (1 mg/10 9 mononuclear cells) at 20oC, and therapeutic doses of cyclosporin until day 90. End points were rate of GvHD, toxicity, TRM, disease recurrence rate and overall survival (OS) time. Results: 92 patients with median age of 44 (17-62) years were enrolled. The diagnosis was acute leukaemia (ALL in 7) in CR in 39, myeloproliferative disorders in 16, lymphoproliferative disease in 25, and multiple myeloma in 11. Median transplanted CD34+ cell number was 2.69 (1-12. 3) and the median dose of CAMPATh-1H was 10 (range 7.5-45) mg. Median time to engraftment was 11 days. At 6 months post transplantation, 8 patients with CML received prophylaxis with donor lymphocytes. Overall, 21 (23%) individuals died, while treatment related mortality occurred in 17% (n= 16; VOD 3, infections in 8, pneumonitis in 2, lymphoma in 1 and GvHD in 2). GvHD (>grade 1) occurred in 8 patients, was controlled with further immunosuppression but led to death from infections in 6. Disease recurrence was seen in 14, but 7 with CML or myeloma responded to DLI. At a median follow up of 688 days, 73% survive disease free. Cox analysis showed that occurrence of GvHD was associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: Myeloablative conditioning is well tolerated in patients receiving T-cell depleted grafts and treatment related mortality of <20% can be expected with this strategy. This information is useful to more precisely select patients who would benefit most from reduced intensity conditioning schedules. ATG, given during conditioning regimen, reduces the risk of severe aGVHD as well as of chronic GVHD in stem cell recipients. ATG-Fresenius(40 mg/kg b.w.) was originally recommended for BuFluATG nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. We employed this dose of ATG in our GVHD prophylactic strategy for MRD and MUD nonmyeloablative as well as for MUD myeloablative transplantations. First we were using ATG 40mg/kg b.w., later we reduced the dose to 20 mg/kg b.w., given as a single dose on D-1 in MRD as well as in MUD (10/10 HR matched) transplantations with CSA alone postransplant. In HSCT from mismatched donors we continued in administration of 40 mg ATG/kg b.w.( 20 mg/kg b.w. infused D-2 and D-1), and we added MMF to CSA postransplant. Regimen with 20 mg/kg b.w. ATG in fully matched HSCT (Goup I) was used in 55 patients (12 CML, 13 AML, 7 MDS, 7 MPS, 5 NHL, 7 CLL, 1 HD, 1 MM), 18 MRD and 37 MUD, 25 RIC and 30 myeloablative SCT. Regimen with 40 mg/kg b.w. of ATG in mismatched HSCT (Group II) was used in 58 patients ( 19 CML, 13 AML, 11 ALL, 7 MDS, 2 CLL, 2 MMM, 2 NHL, 1 MM and 1 HD). The most frequent mismatch in this cohort of the patients was class I. and II. combined mismatch (31%) followed by isolated C locus mismatch (26%). Multiple mismatches in class I were present in 22% and one single mismatch on A or B loci in 7% of the pts. 3% pts received graft with one and 8% with multiple mismatches in class II. HLA. 41 patiens had MMF+CSA and 17 had CSA alone postransplant. Results:",

It has been shown perforin-positive lymphocytes infiltrate lesions of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), however granzyme (Gr) production of these cells in patients after SCT has not been studied yet. Aim of this study was therefore to search for a possible correlation between in vivo GrA and GrB levels and the occurrence of complications after SCT. GrA and GrB levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) from a cohort of 86 HLAidentical and HLA-mismatched SCT patients at various time points before and after SCT. Accordingly, patients were divided into a high and a low Gr-producing group when Gr levels exceeded or fell below median Gr levels at least at two time points. Further evaluations were performed on a study cohort of 70 HLA-identical, sibling or unrelated high-risk SCT recipients. A clear association between high GrA and GrB levels and the occurrence of chronic GvHD was detected. The risk of developing this complication in the sub-cohort transplanted with a myeloablative conditioning regimen was 74% for high GrA and 86% for high GrB producers versus 43% for low GrA and 46% for low GrB producers (p=0.089 and p=0.082, respectively). The same pattern was observed in the sibling sub-cohort producing high GrB levels (75% versus 45%; p=0.043). In contrast, patients transplanted under reducedintensity conditions and releasing high GrA and GrB levels displayed a decreased incidence of developing acute GvHD. Nevertheless, high GrB producers of this sub-cohort showed a reduced survival (24% vs 51% (p=0.096)). Patients transplanted with an HLA-identical sibling and releasing high GrB levels tended to have a lower risk of relapse (24% vs 50% (p=0.077)).

Horvath, V. Budinsky, J. Kayserova, R. Formankova, J. Stary, P. Sedlacek, J. Bartunkova, R. Spisek Charles University (Prague, CZ) Allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with myeloablative conditioning represents a unique opportunity to monitor the kinetics of reconstitution of hematopoetic cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most efficient antigen presenting cells. Two distinct subsets of DCs have been identified, myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) that have different roles in the regulation of immunity. In immature state DCs express low levels of costimulatory molecules and have very low capacity to stimulate antigen specific T cells. After activation, DCs undergo a process termed maturation characterized by an increased expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokine production. Mature DCs migrate to lymphoid organs and activate antigen specific T cells. In this pilot study, we analyzed the kinetics of DCs subsets reconstitution in 5 patients (age range: 5-18 years) undergoing unmanipulated allo-HSCT from unrelated donor. Myeloid DCs were defined as lineage -, CD11c+, HLA-DR+ and pDCs as lineage -, CD123+ and HLA-DR+. We further evaluated activation status of circulating DCs by simultaneous monitoring of expression of costimulatory molecules CD80, CD83 and CD86. Peripheral blood DCs were monitored from the earliest phase of hematopoetic reconstitution. Both mDCs and pDCs appeared at earliest stages after engraftment and relative numbers within white blood cells compartment peaked between days 19-25 after HSCT. Their proportion then gradually declined and steady-state absolute levels found in the control group were reached between days 80-180 after BMT for mDCs and beyond day 180 for pDCs. Expression of costimulatory molecules, especially CD83 and CD86 transiently increased between days 15 and 35 and then went back to low steady state levels. Interestingly, patients who developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) had lower absolute numbers of circulating DCs before appearance of clinical symptoms. Administration of glucocorticoids for the treatment of aGVHD abrogated circulating pDCs and led to a rapid decrease of mDCs within 24h similarly to the findings in systemic autoimmune diseases. In this pilot study the development of aGVHD was preceded by decreased numbers of circulating DCs though now we would like to confirm this hypothesis in larger series of patients.

Stenevi, C. Hansson, M. Brune Gothenburg University (Gothenburg, S) Objective: To assess the presence and quantity of donor myofibroblasts in the conjunctiva of long-term follow-up patients without symptomatic GvHD. Patients: Eight women, median age 44 (32-57) yrs, with CML (n=4), AML (n=3), or Mb Waldenstr\u00f6m all allografted from male donors (3 siblings, 5 unrelated) using bone marrow (n=2) or peripheral blood stem cells (n=6), after full (n=2) or reduced (n=6) conditioning. Samples were obtained a median of 58 (12-93) months after transplantation. All pts were without signs and symptoms of systemic or local GVHD. Two pts were on prednisolone (5 mg) after previous GvHD. Methods: Conjunctival cells were sampled from pts by blotting the eye with a sterile filter membrane, lifting an imprint from the ocular surface. Cells thus obtained, were immediately fixed and analysed on the filter using immunohistochemistry using the myofibroblast (MFB) marker alpha-SMA (Smooth Muscle Actin). Donor cells were identified using sexchromosome specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Cells were typically arranged in a monolayer, predominated by recipient epithelial cells. Myofibroblasts accounted for 16% (range 10-19) of all cells on the filter. Of these cells 72% (23-93) were of donor origin. Discussion: Myofibroblasts are associated with wound-healing and the formation of fibrosis. However, the patients in this study did not show any signs of ocular disease and the fraction of MFB present did not vary in spite of a wide range of variables such as duration from transplant, diagnosis and stem cell source. The finding of MFB of both donor and recipient origin in allografted pts is intriguing and suggests that MFB may have differentiated not only from progenitors or stem cells in the graft, but also from remaining recipient cells. The role of conjunctival donor and recipient MFB, as well as the differentiation route(s) of these cells after allo-SCT is currently under study. Introduction: Graft versus host disease (GVHD) still is the major draw-back of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). In its resistant form, it carries high morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of GVHD therapy is preventive and once it is developed the first line therapy is systematically high dose steroids, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus. It has been shown by us and other groups, that intra-arterial targeted steroid therapy may be useful even in steroid refractory GVHD. Methods: A total 35 patients with 37 cases of steroid resistant/dependent gastrointestinal (GI) (n=16), hepatic (n=15) or combined (n=6) GVHD, were included and given intra-arterial treatment, for one or more of the following arteries -the hepatic, gastro-duodenal, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, internal iliacs. We defined GI partial response and complete response as the day that symptoms decrease or resolved, respectively. Hepatic partial response and complete response were defined as the day that bilirubin level began to decrease or decreased below 30% of initial level, respectively. Results: The procedure was safe with only 1 major complication (renal failure and pancytopenia). We found that Intra-arterial catheter guided steroid therapy was associated with partial and complete remission among patients with steroid resistant or dependent GI or Hepatic GVHD. Hepatic partial response was observed in 14 (66.6%) patients among whom 7 (33.3%) reached complete response. GI partial response was observed in 19 (86.4%) patients among whom 12 (54.4%) reached complete response. An early administration of the local therapy, female gender, myeloid basic disease, and a non-active status of the basic disease at the day of transplantation were found related for predicting a better response for the intra-arterial treatment. Conclusion: Intra-arterial catheter guided steroid therapy is safe and effective in steroid resistant or dependent GVHD. A further research is warranted characterizing the patients benefit most.",

Based on our previous experience, we saw that liver GvHD not associated with gut GvHD had very encouraging response rate to the treatment with pulse cyclophosphamide (Cy). Here we update our previous data and add further information based on larger group of patients and longer follow-up. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 18 patients (pts) after allogeneic PBSC transplantation: 10 pts had acute GvHD (2 pts grade I, 5 pts grade II, 3 pts grade III), 3 pts had chronic extensive GvHD and 5 pts developed liver GvHD upon DLI. Three pts had only liver GvHD, 15 pts had GvHD with involvement of liver and/or oral mucosa, or skin. Furthermore, all pts had hepatitic variant of the liver GvHD (serum aminotransferase ALT or AST elevation above 5 times the upper normal limit). Classical elevation of bilirubin was observed in 11 pts. All pts were treated by cyclosporine A and steroids before pulse Cy. Pulse Cy was administered at a median dose of 1g/m\u00b2; 12 pts received one pulse Cy, 6 pts received two pulses of Cy for slow response. Complete response (CR) was defined as resolution of GvHD manifestation, partial response (PR) as a decrease in organ stage by 1 or decrease in aminotransferase levels to values under 50% of initial level. Patients with no response were signed as NR. Results: There were 45% CR (8/18), 33% PR (6/18) and 22% NR (4/18). However, in 4 pts with NR their clinical status stabilized and they responded to another GvHD treatment. No death from GvHD were observed, however, one patient died from relapse of leukemia. Leukopenia and neutropenia WHO grade 4 developed in 4 patients. When myelosuppression occurred, it was usually short-lived (2-5 days). Importantly, no influence of pulse Cy on chimerism and disease status was observed.

A. Ng, R. Hoyt, A. Grigg, A. Roberts, D. Curtis, J. Szer, D. Ritchie Royal Melbourne Hospital (Melbourne, AUS) Introduction: GVHD is a significant complication of allogeneic SCT. Transplant models suggest a relationship between the degree of mucositis, systemic cytokine levels and acute GVHD severity. Lower GVHD rates associated with RIC are hypothesised to be due in part to lower rates of severe mucositis, however, this hypothesis has not been systematically assessed in clinical cohorts. We undertook a retrospective analysis to explore the relationship between conditioning regimen intensity, mucositis severity and the incidence and severity of acute GVHD. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing histocompatible sibling allogeneic SCT between 1999 and 2004 were identified from the institutional database and classified according to conditioning regimen, maximum mucositis severity by WHO grading, and the incidence and maximum grade of acute GVHD. Comparative statistical analysis was performed using two-sided Fisher's exact test, unless otherwise stated. Results: 151 patients were identified: 54% male, median age 45 years (range 17-66). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 108 patients: Bu( 16mg/kg) -Cy (120mg/kg) (n=30), Cy (120mg/kg)-TBI (12Gy) (n=30), TBI (13.2Gy)-etoposide (60mg/kg) (n=16) and Flu (125mg/m\u00b2)-Mel (120mg/m\u00b2) (n=32). High-dose Flu (125mg/m\u00b2)-Cy (60mg/kg) (n=23) and low-dose Flu (125mg/m\u00b2)-Cy (1g/m\u00b2) (n=20) were RIC regimens. All patients received GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporin and methotrexate+/-prednisolone). The severity of mucositis varied by conditioning regimen (1 way ANOVA, p<0.0001), with TBI-etoposide associated with greatest and Flu-Cy regimens associated with the least mucosal toxicity (Figure 1 ). Acute GVHD occurred in 89 of 151 (59%); grade I (n=18), II (n=51), III (n=14), IV (n=6) (Figure 2 ). The incidence of acute grade II-IV GVHD was less with RIC (Flu-Cy) compared to myeloablative regimens (p=0.029), but no significant difference in incidence was detected between different myeloablative regimens (p=0.33). Notably, the incidence of grade II-IV mucositis was significantly related to grade II-IV gastrointestinal tract (GIT) acute GVHD (p=0.0065). Conclusion: The incidence and severity of mucositis varied according to conditioning regimen. The incidence of acute grade II-IV GVHD was notably less in the RIC cohort, which also had less grade 2-4 mucositis compared to myeloablative regimens. This suggests that regimen-induced mucositis is a risk-factor for acute GVHD, especially GIT GVHD. Mucositis severity, however, was not predictive of GVHD severity.",

Miron, A. Levovic, S. Slavin, R. Or Hadassah -Hebrew University Medical Center (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: Alefacept (AMEVIVE\u00ae) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that consists of the extracellular CD2-binding portion of the human leukocyte function antigen-3 (LFA-3) linked to the Fc (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) portion of human IgG1. We have recently shown its effect in acute, steroid resistant/dependent GVHD. In this study, we describe the effect of alefacept treatment on chronic extensive graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Patients and methods: A total of 12 patients (13 cGVHD episodes) were included in this study, 7 males and 5 females with median age 27 years (range 3-60 years). Basic disease was AML (n=5), ALL (n=3), NHL (n=1), hemophagocytosis (n=1) and malignant melanoma (n=1). Seven patients were transplanted from HLA-A, B, C and high resolution DR fully matched family members (siblings=6, father=1); 2 patients received stem cell graft from fully matched unrelated donor (MUD) non-reactive in mixed lymphocyte culture; 2 from mismatched family members and 1 from a matched unrelated cord blood unit. All patients had an extensive cGVHD. Alefacept dose for children was 15mg given intramuscularly (IM) once weekly. The dose for adults was 30mg IM once weekly. Results: a median of 9 (range 1-25 injections were given to the patients. Eight out of 12 patients (9/13 episodes) showed response. The median time to initial response was 2.25 weeks (range 1-8). The response was either marked (n=3), moderate (n=2) or minimal (n=4). One patient with pulmonary GVHD had a consistent improvement (figure 1). In 2 responding patients, the response was only temporary. Treatment complications included infection (n=3), pericarditis (n=1) and squamous cell carcinoma of the lip (n=1). All these events may be related to other drugs given simultaneously. Currently, 7/12 patients are alive all with stable or improved cGVHD. Five patients died due to GVHD progression. Conclusion: Alefacept is effective for the treatment of cGVHD, dose and treatment's time intervals should be explored. Introduction: Alefacept (AMEVIVE\u00ae) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that consists of the extracellular CD2-binding portion of the human leukocyte function antigen-3 linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. We have recently published preliminary data demonstrating its effect in acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). In this study, we followed the subpopulations in the peripheral blood lymphoid cells of patients treated with alefacept due to chronic extensive GVHD (cGVHD). Patients and methods: seven patients were included in this study, 5 males and 2 females with median age 23 years (range 3-47 years). All were heavily pretreated with multiple immunosuppressive agents due to cGVHD. Alefacept was given 15mg given intramuscularly (IM) once weekly in children and 30mg IM once weekly in adults. Peripheral blood was analyzed throughout the treatment for the number and ratio of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD45RA and CD45RO positive cells. Results: informative data was acquired from 6 patients, In general, there was a decrease of the percentage of total lymphocytes, both B and T cells, in most patients under the treatment of alefacept. A significant reduction of memory cells (CD45RO+) as compared to na\u00efve (CD45RA+) cells was seen in all patients (figure 1). Additionally, we found In some patients, a decrease of the percentage of the sub-types of T cells, including cytotoxic T cells or reduction of the percentage of B cells. Conclusion: as reported in psoriatic patients treated with alefacept, we found an increase in the percentage of na\u00efve T cells following alefacept treatment in patients with cGVHD. These results make alefacept a promising new agent for clinical application for treatment of patients with cGVHD.",

Remberger Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, S) Background: Second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been previously reported as a treatment option in cases of disease relapse or graft failure. In this retrospective study we present data resulting from retransplantations carried out at a single institution between years 1985 and 2006. Material and Methods: Thirty-seven patients with a haematological malignancy underwent a second HSCT due to relapse (n=29) or graft failure (n=8). Median age was 19 years (range 2 -60). The donor was changed for 6 patients. GVHD prophylaxis was introduced in 19 patients, while 18 received no prophylaxis. A bone marrow graft was used in 18 patients, while 19 received PBSC. Conditioning was chemotherapy (n=33) or TBI based regimen (n=2), while 2 patients received no conditioning. Donors were matched related (n=18), matched unrelated (n=14) and mismatched (n=5). Incidence of and parameters influencing mortality, GVHD development and relapse of disease after retransplantation have been analyzed. Results: The overall 5-year survival after retransplantation was 15%, and transplantation-related mortality was 41%. Incidence of acute GVHD, grades II-IV, was 62%, with PBSC being a risk factor for development (p<0.05). The incidence of chronic GVHD was 30%. The incidence of relapse after retransplantation was 46% and was not associated with GVHD prophylaxis or GVHD status of the patient. Univariate analysis showed a better survival for patients with GVHD grades 0-II (19%) in comparison to grades III-IV (0%), p<0.05. Also, bone marrow as graft source and a female donor to male recipient could be identified as risk factors for inferior survival after retransplantation (p<0.05). In multivariate analysis acute GVHD grades III -IV (p<0.001) and a bone marrow graft (p=0.004) were significantly correlated to an inferior survival. Patients, having one of these factors (n=23) or both (n= 2) showed poorer 1-year survival (30% and 0%) compared to patients having none of the risk factors (n=12, 75%). Patients with acute GVHD grades III-IV (n=7) showed poorer survival (0%) compared to patients with marrow as graft source (n=16, 38%). Conclusions: Retransplantation is associated with poor survival and high incidence of moderate to severe acute GVHD. Although the size of the study limits conclusions, it is suggested to use PBSC as stem cell source and to prevent development of severe acute GVHD. Recent evidence highlights an implication of B lymphocytes in the development and sustainment of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvH). The monoclonal anti-CD20-antibody rituximab has proven effective against steroid refractory cGvH. Data on the role of B lymphocytes in acute GvH (aGvH) is sparse. We report on a reduction of the incidence of aGvH in patients receiving rituximab as an element of conditioning as compared to patients conditioned without rituximab. All 11 patients receiving rituximab suffered from CD20 positive Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma (NHL). All patients received cyclosporine and either mycophenolate or short course methotrexate immunosuppression. Only patients beyond day 25 are included in the analysis; as of november 23rd, 2006 median follow up is 178 days (range 29 to 448 days). Out of 9 patients receiving rituximab as an element of conditioning, 2 (18.2 %) developed moderate aGvH. Out of 18 patients who did not receive rituximab during conditioning, 13 (72.2 %) developed moderate to severe aGvH. 2 patients developed severe acute GvH after early cessation of immunosuppression and / or donor lymphocyte infusion for progressive disease. If removed from this analysis, 11 out of 16 patients (68.8 %) developed aGvH after conditioning without rituximab. Taken together, these data present a trend that in patients conditioned with rituximab acute GvH occurs less frequently. These are amongst the first data indicating that rituximab might suppress the development of acute GvH. They are in accordance with work published before yet this is the first study systematically comparing two groups of patients. At present, no data exploring the influence of CD20 positive B lymphocytes or the effect of rituximab on graft-versus-tumor effects exist. It therefore remains to be investigated whether the suggested suppression of GvH by rituximab benefits overall survival by reducing transplantation related mortality or whether it is associated with a higher relapse rate due to an abrogated graft versus tumor effect. Furthermore, it remains to be elucidated whether the administration of rituximab before transplantation or during the restoration of the allogeneic immune system exerts prophylactic effects against chronic GvH and whether this influences both graft versus tumor effects and survival. Finally, we conclude that the addition of rituximab to the treatment of severe steroid refractory acute graft versus host reactions has to be tested in randomized trials.",

Thi\u00e9baut, X. Thomas, Y. Chelgoum, S. Ducastelle, J. Troncy, M. Clark, F. Nicolini H\u00f4pital Edouard Herriot (Lyon, F) We studied the impact of demographic, pre and posttransplant parameters on chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurrences in 141 allogeneic reduced intensity conditioning transplant (RICT were in CR (28%), 54 in PR (38%), 4 in stable disease and 43 in progressive disease (30%). The median interval between diagnosis and transplant was 20 months (5 -300). We observed 10 graft failures, 51 patients (39.5%) developed acute GVHD II and 54 (42%) chronic GVHD (28 limited -26 extensive). At the last follow-up, 73 patients (52%) relapsed and 97 patients had died (55 from TRM causes and 42 from relapse), 43 (30.5%) received DLI. The 3-year probability of overall survival was 28.5% and TRM at 1 year and 3 years was 24% and 34% respectively. We analysed in multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model the relation between chronic GVHD occurrence and (1) demographic parameters: donor and recipient age, sex matching (2) pre and post-transplant variables: HLA matching, number of previous transplant, CMV status (D/R), ABO compatibility, interval diagnosis-transplant, HSC source, CD34+ cell number, CD3+ cell number, conditioning, ATG dose, status of disease, acute GVHD and DLI. We did not find any significant impact factor on chronic GVHD occurrence. Due to these negative predictive findings and too few patients, it is vital to do prospective trials in RICT focused on chronic GVHD prevention and/or early treatment. Background: Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) is a major complication during the first 100 days after Allogenic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT). Gastrointestinal (GI) aGVHD shows a progressive worsening of the symptoms, but the prognosis may be improved by an early diagnosis and timely treatment. Differential diagnoses include intestinal infections and chemo/radiotherapy side-effects. Conventional diagnostic procedures include the histologic assessment of the upper and lower GI tract, requiring invasive endoscopic procedures in severely ill patients. Aim Aim of the present study was to determine whether High Resolution Sonography (HRS) of the bowel may represent a useful non invasive procedure for the diagnosis and assessment of aGVHD and whether HRS may be helpful for a timely treatment of aGVHD. Methods: From August 2004 to September 2006, 24 patients (15M, 45 yrs, range 18-58) underwent AHSCT (patients received: 15/24 peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and 9/24 bone marrow transplantation). Indication for AHSCT was: ALL in 3 pts, AML in 8 pts, CML in 2 pts, NHL in 6 pts, HL in 1 pt, multiple mieloma in 3 and myelodisplastic syndrome in 1 patient. GI symptoms were observed in 18/24 patients, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea, intestinal bleeding. Symptoms onset began after a median of 59 days (range 10-100) from AHSCT. Within 24 hours from the onset of GI symptoms, HRS was performed by using a 7 MHz linear and a 3.5 MHz convex array transducers. HRS changes included: increased bowel wall thickness and small bowel and/or colon dilation. Results: Among the 18 patients with GI symptoms, aGVHD was confirmed by clinical assessment in 10 patients, by histology in 6 patients. In 10/10 patients who developed aGVHD after AHSCT, HRS revealed at least one site of involvement as defined by an increased bowel wall thickness. An increased small bowel wall thickness was found in 8/10 patients with aGVHD. In 8/10 aGVHD patients a thickening of the colonic wall (either in ascending and/or distal colon) was found. In 6/10 aGVHD patients both small and large bowel appeared to be involved. Conclusion: HRS is a feasible and non-invasive diagnostic tool which may provide useful information for a prompt and appropriate treatment of patients with suspected aGVHD. The possible role of HRS for predicting the development of aGVHD and for grading its severity warrants evaluation in prospective studies. Chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) incidence and severity are generally found to be greater after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) than after bone marrow transplantation, and some studies increased mortality from cGvHD, particularly the extensive type. In vivo, T-cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is an effective strategy for decreasing the incidence of cGvHD but may include side effects such as high risk of infection and relapse. The main utilization of ATG has been as prophylaxis of GvHD in unrelated bone marrow transplantation but few data are available on myeloablative HLA-identical sibling PBSCT. In our study we evaluated the incidence of infections, relapse and cGvHD in 28 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission after a peripheral stem cell myeloablative HLA-identical sibling transplant. Conditioning regimen was oral busulfan (16 mg/Kg), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/Kg) and ATG-Thymoglobuline (4 mg/Kg total dose given on days -2 and -1); the median dose of CD34+ cells and CD3+ cells infused was 4.6 x10 6 /Kg (range 3.1-9) and 250 x10 6 /Kg (range 84-442), respectively. GvHD prophylaxis was Cyclosporin A (2 mg/Kg/Die) and short-term Methotrexate (15 mg/m\u00b2 on day +1, 10 mg/m\u00b2 on day +3, +6, +11). The median time to neutrophil (>0.5 x10 9 /L) and platelet (>20 x10 9 /L) engraftment was 15 (range 13-17) and 18 (range 15-20) days, respectively. Acute GvHD grade I-II was observed in 5/28 or 18%; no patients experienced aGvHD grade III-IV. CMV antigenemia was monitored twice a week for the first 100 days; 15/28 (54%) patients developed CMV reactivation but no CMV disease occurred. As to immunological recovery, the median number of CD3+ and CD4+ after 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation was 690, 850, 930 and 125, 214, 256/microL, respectively; the median number of CD8 and NK cells after 1, 3 and 6 months was 430, 538, 653 and 216, 156, 230/microL, respectively. At a median observation time of 32 months (range 8-55) the overall cGvHD was 5/28 (18%) (limited 3/5 or 10% and extensive 2/5 or 8%); the relapse rate was 7/28 or 25%. Our data suggest that low dose of ATG is effective in preventing acute and chronic GvHD without increase in relapse; prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the role of ATG in AML undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical sibling.",

Lauria Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese (Siena, I) Photopheresis (extracorporeal photochemotherapy, ECP) characterized by exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to the photosensiting agent 8-methoxypsoralen and UV-A radiation, has been shown to be effective in treatment of selected oncological and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, recent reports indicate that this therapy is promising also in patients who develop Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematological malignancies. We present 19 patients (with a median age of 48 years): 13 developed an acute GvHD (aGvHD, 11 grade II, 1 grade III and 1 grade IV) and 6 a chronic GvHD (cGvHD, 3 limited and 3 extensive) after (HSCT) and were referred to ECP. All patients were refractory or poor responders to steroid therapy. Seventeen patients received a stem cell grafting from sibling donor and 2 from unrelated donors while 8 were treated with an ablative conditioning and 11 with a nonmyeloablative regimen. The stem cell were collected from peripheral blood in 18 cases and from bone marrow in 1 case. The majority of patients had skin and liver involvement (only 3 patients with aGvHD had gut manifestations). The ECP procedure was performed using the UVAR XTS photopheresis system (Therakos Inc., West Chester, PA, USA). Patients were treated on 2 consecutive days (one cycle) every week for two months, every two weeks for the following two months and then ECP was tapered on an individual basis. The median number of treatments was 21 and no adverse events were observed. Of the 13 aGvHD patients, 7 (54%) achieved a complete resolution (CP) of GvHD manifestations, 2 (15%) a partial remission (PR) and 4 no response. In the 6 cGvHD patients, 3 obtained a CR and the other 3 a PR. The immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued in 32% of patients (all cases with grade II aGvHD or limited cGvHD) and reduced in 37%. Our findings suggest that ECP is an effective adjunct therapy for both acute and chronic GvHD with cutaneous and liver involvement. In addition, this beneficial effect is obtained without the complications typically encountered with immunosuppressive regimens used to control GvHD. However, in patients with aGvHD grade IV or extensive cGvHD other therapeutic options are warrented. Randomized studies on a larger number of patients are needed to confirm the efficacy of ECP in GvHD and its role in the treatment of this complications after HSCT.",

Afanasyev State I.Pavlov Medical University (St. Petersburg, RUS) Myeloablative conditioning regimen followed by allo-HSCT from HLA-identical donors has become a curative treatment option for patients with a number of hematologic malignancies. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is used in the conditioning regimens for donor transplants to reduce the risk of GvHD and rejection. Reduce intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) is important option for treatment patients > 50 yo and heavy-pretreated. We analyzed the outcome of 125 high-risk pts with hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies receiving myeloablative and RIC regimen for allo-SCT from HLAidentical donors with or without ATG. Since 2000 we have performed 125 allo-HSCT (88 (70%) with ATG and 37 (30%)without ATG) for the patients: AML (n=26), ALL (n=55), CML (n=17), NHL (n=7), AA (n=7), HD (n=4), MDS (n=3), osteomyelofibrosis (n=1), solid tumor (n=1). All patients were stratified into two groups according to the risk of diseases recurrence: 1) Low risk 2 complete remission/chronic phase (57 pts) 2) High risk >2 complete remission, no remission, partial remission, progression diseases (64 pts) and the other diseases: Kostmann's syndrome (n=1), hypereosinophilic syndrome (n=1), Krabbe disease (n=1), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n=1). Dose of ATG was 60 mg/kg.b.w. (45-120). Myeloablative conditioning regimen consisted mainly of Bu-Cy-55 pts (44%), RIC-Flu-Cy-70 pts (56%). The GvHD prophylaxis was: short term MTX and CsA. Results: The rate of GvHD grade 0-II in pts with ATG was 83% (67 pts), GvHD grade III-IV -17% (14 pts). The rate of GvHD 0-II in group pts without ATG was 78% (22 pts) and GvHD III-IV-22% (6 pts). In ATG group we observed primary rejection in 7 pts (8%). In the group without ATG primary rejection was higher (7 pts (19%)). Two pts without ATG died after engraftment because of severe infections without signs of acute GVHD. TMR in the group with ATG was 56% (49 pts), without ATG -67% (25 pts). OS within 6 years in pts with ATG was 44%, without ATG -33% (p=0.04). Conclusion: The use of ATG in conditioning regimen reduces the incidence of acute GvHD grade III-IV, reduces risk primary rejection and increases overall survival in patients after both related and unrelated allo-HSCT without increased risk of relapse. Introduction: Budesonide (BUD) is a highly potent steroid with a low bioavailability and has been used for topical treatment of oral manifestations of GVHD as well as gastrointestinal GVHD. Here, we present the results of a retrospective evaluation of the efficacy of BUD in treatment of mild or moderate chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Methods: Eleven patients median age 52 years (41-65) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies receiving single agent treatment with BUD for cGVHD were evaluated for response. The stem cell source consisted of peripheral blood stem cells (n=10) or bone marrow (n=1). The donor types were matched unrelated donor (n=7), mismatched unrelated donor (n=2), and matched sibling donor (n=2). Six patients had prior acute GVHD grade 2-3, while the remaining 5 patients developed de novo cGVHD. Three patients had isolated gastrointestinal involvement of cGVHD and 8 patients had mild multi-organ involvement including gastrointestinal (n=8), skin (n=4), and liver (n=4) manifestations. Four patients received Cyclosporin (CsA) at the time of onset of cGVHD, which was continued during treatment with BUD. Diagnosis of cGVHD was confirmed by histology (skin n=1, duodenum/stomach n=9) in 10 patients. Treatment consisted of BUD with an initial dose of 3x3mg orally. Results: Complete resolution of cGVHD was achieved in 6 patients, one patient had complete resolution of all clinical symptoms of cGVHD but persisting thrombocytopenia and two patients achieved partial remission (PR) of cGVHD. Two patients progressed on BUD and responded subsequently to systemic steroids. Two patients relapsed with cGVHD after withdrawal of BUD and 7 patients are currently on BUD. Ten patients are currently alive with a median follow up of 168 days after start of BUD. One patient with PR died due to invasive mycosis. Beside response of gastrointestinal involvement of cGVHD responses have been observed in liver manifestations (n=2), lungs (n=1), skin (n=2) and eyes (n=2). Conclusion: BUD represents a treatment option in mild to moderate cGVHD, which is well tolerated and associated with a high response rate in gastrointestinal manifestations of cGVHD. Furthermore systemic responses have been observed. The observed relapse of symptoms of cGVHD after withdrawal of BUD may be due to a dominating local effect on cGVHD and best treatment duration has yet to be determined. Introduction: Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGVHD) is still one of the more important causes of Morbidity/Mortality related to the allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (aSCT).The increase of aSCT in the few last years, with clear benefits, requires to improve diagnoses and prognostic criteria of cGVHD, in order to establish the suitable treatment, without losing GVL effect. Purpose: to analyze, to re-classify and to compare two internationally adopted classifications, in cGVHD, in order to improve future treatments with immunosuppressive drugs. High dose chemotherapy (HDC) used to treat haematological malignancy is known to damage the mature marrow stromal microenvironment. The extent that marrow MSCs are damaged by HDC is unknown. If damage to marrow MSCs is substantial, cultured autologous or allogeneic MSCs are a therapeutic possibility. We have compared the proliferative capacity and cluster of differentiation (CD) marker expression of marrow MSCs from patients with haematological malignancies who have received no treatment, low, or high dose chemotherapy. All MSC cultures were processed with minor modifications as described by Wexler et al. 2003 . Primary cultures established from treated marrows displayed a mixed morphology compared to those from untreated marrows which grew as a typical densely packed fibroblast like monolayer. The proliferation of marrow MSCs from patients who have received HDC, n=25 was significantly reduced when compared to MSCs from patients who had received no prior chemotherapy treatment, n=20, (p<0.01). MSCs from treated patients were phenotypically similar to MSCs from untreated patients as follows; CD105+, CD166+, CD29+, CD44+, CD45neg, (p>0.84). However, the level of MSC CD44 expression after 2nd passage was significantly lower in patients who had received HDC than in untreated patients, (p<0.05). The frequency of colony-forming unit-fibroblasts (CFU-F) in the second passage MSC population was determined using a standard CFU-F assay. The number of CFU-F in each sample was correlated to its MSC proliferation capacity at 2nd passage. Although there was a significant reduction in MSC proliferation in the HDC group (p<0.05), there was no significant difference in the number of CFU-F present in culture from patients receiving HDC and patients who had received no prior treatment, (p>0.30). There was a positive correlation between the number of CFU-F and the proliferative capacity in MSC cultures from patients who had received no prior chemotherapy (p<0.05), this was not evident in the HDC group, (p>0.64). We conclude that marrow MSCs sustain prolonged injury due to recurrent courses of HDC. The reduction in proliferative capacity and changes in adhesion molecule expression observed could disrupt vital interactions between MSC and HSC within the bone marrow microenvironment. ",

We have now examined the CD44 expression on marrow MSC from haematologically normal donors, before and after in-vitro treatment with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs including cyclophosphamide with or without S9 liver extract, vincristine and chlorambucil. Drugs were added to the cultures in therapeutic concentrations for 48 hours. In addition we have investigated the use of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) as a cyto-protective agent against chemotherapeutic damage to MSC in culture. After in-vitro treatment of normal donor MSC, significant reductions in CD44 expression were observed with all drugs tested, (p<0.05). Decreased levels of CD44 expression on MSC were evident up to twelve weeks post in-vitro treatment with cyclophosphamide + S9 liver extract (figure 1). CD44 protein expression on MSC was also examined in untreated and cyclophosphamide + S9 in-vitro treated samples using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis immuno-blots. The CD44 expression pattern was altered after treatment, indicating that exposure of MSC to cyclophosphamide may alter CD44 structurally as well as quantitatively on the membrane surface of MSC. The cyto-protective role of KGF to MSC was tested. KGF was added to MSC cultures 48hrs, 24hrs, and 4hrs prior to the invitro treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The addition of KGF to MSC prior to treatment with cyclophosphamide + S9 liver extract resulted in significant preservation of CD44 expression, (p<0.05). We conclude that in-vitro treatment of normal donor MSCs with chemotherapeutic agents causes prolonged injury as previously shown in patient MSC exposed in-vivo to high dose chemotherapy regimens. This study demonstrates that KGF protects normal donor MSC from in-vitro damage by cyclophosphamide. It is possible that KGF given prior to HDC may protect the marrow microenvironment in the clinical setting.",

MSCs are able to modulate T cell functions in vitro and, upon in vivo administration, ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the mechanism by which MSCs exert their effect is largely unknown. Here we analyze the global transcriptional profile of therapeutic MSCs and compare it with 486 publicly available microarray datasets from other mouse tissues and cell types. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering identified a unique pattern of gene expression capable of distinctively classifying MSCs from other tissues and cells. Analysis of absolute and relative abundance of transcripts in all cell types revealed that the set of transcripts uniquely expressed by MSCs is enriched in transcription factors and in components of the Wnt signaling pathway. This analysis also identified a set of genes specifically involved in the HSC niche. Interestingly, some of these genes play a role in the maintenance of HSCs in a quiescent state supporting their survival but preventing them from proliferating and differentiating. These findings provide novel and important insights on the mechanisms of T cell function regulation by MSCs and help to cement the rationale for their application in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

            "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are part of the bone marrow where they provide signals supporting survival and growth of bystander haematopoietic stem cells (HSC). MSC modulate also the immune response as they inhibit proliferation of lymphocytes. In order to investigate whether MSC can support survival of T cells we investigated MSC capacity of rescuing T lymphocytes from cell death induced by different mechanisms. We observed that MSC prolong survival of unstimulated T cells and apoptosis-prone thymocytes cultured under starving condition. MSC rescued T cells from activation induced cell death (AICD) by downregulation of Fas receptor and Fas ligand on T cell surface and inhibition of endogenous proteases involved in cell death. MSC dampened also Fas receptor mediated apoptosis of CD95 expressing Jurkat leukemic T cells. In contrast, rescue from AICD was not associated with a significant change of Bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis induced by cell stress. Accordingly, MSC exhibited a mild capacity of rescuing Jurkat cells from chemically induced apoptosis, a process disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential regulated by Bcl-2. These results suggest that MSC interfere with the Fas receptor regulated process of programmed cell death. Overall MSC can inhibit proliferation of activated T cells while supporting their survival in a quiescent state providing a model of their activity inside the HSC niche. Busulphan (Bu) given in myeloablative doses is a frequent component of cytotoxic preparative regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Variations in the area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) for Bu may result in over/under dosing, which may increase the risk of toxicity or reduce efficacy. A pharmacokinetically guided test dose strategy prior to administration of high dose Bu may be utilized to achieve a specific target AUC. Previously we have shown that exposure to Bu as indicated by AUC above 6000 microM.min is associated with poorer clinical outcome. Objectives: Our aim was to avoid toxic levels of Bu exposure above an AUC of 6000 microM.min and to accurately and consistently adjust dose prior to the first day of intravenous (IV) Bu treatment based on the kinetics of a reduced test dose given a few days prior to the high dose treatment. Methods: Pharmacokinetic (PK) monitoring was conducted for both the test dose and day one of high dose IV Bu. For the test dose 0.8 mg/kg of IV Bu was administered at a fixed infusion rate a minimum of two days before the first 3.2 mg/kg IV Bu dose. If the test dose predicted an AUC of 6000 microM.min or above the Bu dose for day one was reduced to target an AUC of 5500 microM.min. Bu concentrations in plasma were determined by UV-HPLC. All PK data were analyzed by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin Version 5.0.1 software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Results: To date 53 patients have been monitored for Bu levels using this test dose strategy. The test dose has an excellent predictive performance for day one AUC of high dose Bu. Bias as determined by the average percent error for day one AUC of Bu as predicted by the test dose was 2.08%, with a 95% confidence interval of +0.29% to +3.87%. The range of percent error for the test dose predicted AUC for day one Bu was -9.06% to +21.34%, with 98% of the predictions falling below 20% error and 89% falling below 10% error. The test dose predicted that day one AUC for two of the patients would have exceeded the critical value of 6000 microM.min. Bu dose was successfully reduced in these two patients to target an AUC of 5500 microM.min. Conclusions: This pharmacokinetically guided test dose strategy for monitoring IV Bu is highly accurate, consistent, and reliable. Using this strategy toxic exposure level of Bu can be avoided; furthermore this strategy offers the promise of targeted individualized dosing for IV Bu.",

The level of \"CFU-EC\" has even been described to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes and may identify patients at increased cardiovascular risk. The precise mechanisms underlying \"CFU-EC\" formation and their cellular composition are unknown. We performed detailed subtractive \"CFU-EC\" analyses in blood samples of 18 healthy volunteers. The impact of various blood cell types and kinetics of protein and gene expression were studied by cell sorting, flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR and full genome microarray analyses. \"CFU-EC\"-derived soluble factors were measured by multiplex cytokine display and functionally tested during endothelial network formation. \"CFU-EC\" contained more than 99% CD45+ nucleated hematopoietic cells mainly comprising T cells and monocytes admixed with B and NK cells. Interestingly, purified T-cells plus monocytes were able to form \"CFU-EC\" clusters. The complete lack of colony formation after depletion of T cells or monocytes was contrasted by an unaffected \"CFU-EC\" formation after depletion of CD34+ progenitors. Gene expression profiling revealed an activation of various immune function-related biological processes but no changes in pathways assigned to angiogenesis. Soluble factors derived from \"CFU-EC\" cultures supported the vascular regenerative function of three different types of EC in vitro. Unravelling \"CFU-EC\" formation as a result of a functional crosstalk between T cells and monocytes shifts expectations on vascular regenerative medicine. The data support a switch from a singular view on circulating endothelial progenitors towards models that recognize the contribution of immune cell functions during vascular regeneration. Natural killer (Nk) cells have been shown to play an important role in the graft versus leukaemia reaction especially after haploidentical transplantation. Leukaemia reactive Nk clones could be observed only in the first few months after transplantation ant this may be correlated to an increased number of KIR negative and KIR single positive Nk cells in patients in this time period post transplantation. A better understanding of Nk differentiation stages could help to decode the mechanisms underlying these observations. Several in vitro systems for the in vitro generation of human natural killer cells have been described, most using cord blood stem cells, murine stroma cell lines and different cytokines. We developed an in vitro system using autologous or allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells as feeder layer and a cytokine combination previously shown to be optimal for Nk development on a murine fetal liver cell line (Miller et al Blood. 2001; 98:705-713) . Nk cells developed through different stages of maturation in regard to expression of CD117 and CD94 which have been described in isolated Nk cells from human lymph nodes. We found a early expression of NKp44 and CD161, while expression of other NCRs, NKG2A and NKG2D occurred later. These still KIR-negative, NKG2A positive and NCR positive Nk cells showed production of interferon-gamma and a good cytolytic activity against K562. If such KIR-negative Nk cells also have a good activity against leukaemic blasts remains to be investigated. As we use human mesenchymal stem cells and not a murine stroma cell line our system would allow the generation of such KIR negative and cytolytic Nk cells according to GMP. Background: The most popular conditioning regimens without total body irradiation (TBI) , is busulfan -cyclophosphamide (BU-CY). BU is now available in the intravenous formulation and has been used in conjunction with fludarabine. Thiotepa (THIO) is a myeloablative agent, which has also been used in regimens with or without TBI. Aim of the study: The aim of the present study was to compare two different conditioning regimens , one based on i.v. BU (developed in Alberta Canada ) and one based on i.v. THIO (developed in Genova Italy). Patients and regimens: The analysis is restricted to 104 patients with leukemia , over the age of 40 allografted between 1999 and 2005, grafted from an HLA identical sibling. Patients transplanted in Alberta (n=57) received i.v. BU 3.2 mg/kg/day x4 with fludarabine 50 mg/m\u00b2x5 with low dose antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Patients grafted in Genova (n=47) received thiotepa 10-15 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide 100-150 mg/kg and no ATG. GvHD prophylaxis was Cyclosporin Methotrexate for all patients. The two groups were balanced for diagnosis (p=0.5) (AML (33,29) ALL (7,3) CML (17,15), and disease phase (p=0.1) (1st CR 44,30) ; BU patients were younger (p=0.0003) (median age 47 vs 53) and received more frequently peripheral blood (PB) grafts (p=0.0001) (72% vs 15%). Median follow up for surviving patients was 4,6 years.",

Whether these regimens can be modified to reduce leukemia relapse, with low dose TBI or additional myeloablative agents, is being currently explored. High-dose therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is a main indication for relapsed or high-risk first remission aggressive non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (nHL) and plays a role for relapsed follicular lymphoma. Preliminary studies suggest that Y-90 ibritumonab tiuxetan in combination with high dose therapy and autologous stem transplantation is associated with high response rates, durable remissions and acceptable toxicity. We evaluated the combination of Y-90 ibritumonab tiuxetan at standard dose (0.4 mCi/Kg) plus high dose regimen (BEAM) in 9 patients with advanced stage nHL who failed to achieve complete remission (CR) after first line chemotherapy. Methods: The treatment plan is shown in figure 1 . PBSCs were collected after mobilization with DHAP and G-CSF. Patients' characteristics are shown in table 1. Results: The median CD34+ cells infused was 7.92 x 10 6 /Kg (range 3.2-21.6). The median time to platelet counts higher than 20x10 9 /L were 15 days (range, 9-28 days). The median time to an absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5x10 9 /L were 10 days (range, 8-14) .

No grade IV mucositis was documented. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 88% of cases. Median time onset and the duration of fever were day +2 (range, 1-4) and 4 days (range, 1-12). We observed 1 episode of FUO, 4 pneumonitis and 5 blood stream infections, mainly by Gram+. One patient developed an atrial fibrillation. Median follow-up is 77 days (range, 36-300). The overall response rate is 78% with CR in 56% of the patients. Median time to progression was 92 days (2 cases). One patient died for documented viral encephalitis at day +70. Conclusion: The use of RIT plus BEAM provides sufficient results (CR 56%) with sustained engraftment, an acceptable extra-haematological toxicity and a rapid immunological recovery. The power of this program needs to be assessed in a larger series of patients and in a multicenter setting.",

(1) (1)Universiity of Genoa (Genoa, I); (2)Gaslini Institute (Genoa, I) Several evidences demonstrate that murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSC) modulate many immune functions of T, B, NK lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC). Here we addressed the effect of bone marrow derived mMSC on DC maturation, effector functions and T cells priming. In the presence of mMSC at different concentrations, maturation of bone marrow precursors to DC was strongly impaired as depicted by an arrest of cell division and a significant decrease of CD11c positive DC grown in the presence of mMSC as compared to controls. After DC activation by LPS exposure, DC treated with mMSC during maturation, showed a decreased expression of CD83 and an impaired secretion of IL-12. Similarly, mMSC-treated mature DC downregulated MHC class I and class II as well as CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules in comparison to controls. Finally, DC matured in the presence of mMSC showed an impaired capacity to prime CD4+ T cells obtained from the spleen of tetanus toxoid immunized mice. Interestingly, a similar defect of effector functions was observed also when mature DC where exposed to mMSC only during LPS activation. Overall, these findings suggest that the immunoregulatory activity of MSC on T cell functions is the result also of a direct effect on DC and therefore support MSC utilization for the modulation of abnormal immune responses. Objective: Our aim for this study was to describe the outcome of blood and marrow transplantation in patients with class 3 Thalassemia major. Methods: Since December 1992 till July 2006, fifty-two patients with Thalassemia class 3 received blood and marrow transplantation from their Human Leukocyte Antigen(HLA)identical siblings. Thirty-two patients received bone marrow and twenty patients received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Conditioning regimen in 47 patients was Cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg/day (from day -5 to -2) and Busulfan 3.5 mg/kg/day (from day -9 to -6) and in these patients Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen was Cyclosporine.A (CY.A) 1.5mg/kg /day/IV (day -3), then 3mg/kg/day IV (days +7, +11), then 12.5 mg/kg/day/PO and Methotrexate 10mg/m\u00b2 (day +1), 6mg/m\u00b2 (days +3, +6). Conditioning regimen in 5 patients was Fludarabin 40 mg/m\u00b2 (from -6 to -2) and Busulfan 4 mg/kg (from -5 to -2) and in this patients GVHD prophylaxis regimen was (CY.A) 3 mg/kg/day IV (days +3 and +7), then 12.5 mg/kg/day PO. Results: Median age at time of transplantation was 8.5 years (age range: 1-26), Male/Female: 21/31.Median time of absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 10 9 /L was +14 and Median time of platelet recovery > 20 x 10 9 /L was +25. At present 42 out of 52 are alive and 10 patients died due to acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, rejection, veno-occlusive disease, infection and the others. Thirty-four patients (64%) developed acute GVHD (grade 1 = 13, grade 2 = 7, grade 3= 10, grade 4= 4). Three patients (5.8%) developed chronic GVHD (limited= 2, extensive= 1). 8-year disease free survival were 73.17%. 8year overall survival were 79.85%. Conclusion: According to this study, for an acceptable outcome in Thalassemia class 3 We need better conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens to decrease cardiopulmonary and liver complications. The results of blood and marrow transplantation showed that it is better than supportive therapy such as transfusion and desferal therapy.",

Josefsen, L. Forfang, A. Blystad, M. Dyrhaug, G. Kvalheim Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical (Oslo, N) The expression of the CD34 antigen on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and immature hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) are widely used to characterize a cell population which also include cells with self-renewal potential. However, previous findings suggest that early HPC might lack CD34 expression, further demonstrating the complexity of early hematopoiesis. A novel Hoechst 33342 dye efflux assay has been developed which identifies a population of immature HPC termed side population (SP) cells. In several previous studies the SP cells examined in mononuclear cell (MNC) fractions were shown to be predominantly CD34 negative. In this study we examined whether SP cells were present in highly purified CD34+ (98-99%) cells from PBPC in patients with Hodgkin lymphomas. Furthermore, we examined whether variations in the level of SP+ cells influenced short term engraftment. Highly enriched CD34+ cells were isolated from PBPC obtained from patients with Hodgkin lymphomas. To identify the SP+ cells, enriched CD34+ cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye. Using flowcytometric techniques (FACStar+, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) we were able to visualize the dye efflux in SP+ cells. The cells were phenotyped using PE or FITC conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD34, CD38, CD133 and Thy-1. The percentage of SP+ cells in the CD34+ cell fraction varied. Interestingly, we observed that 0,3-69% of the total CD34+ cell population were SP+ cells. We obtained similar results in both freshly isolated as well as in thawed CD34+ cells. Except for a higher level of CD133+ cells in the SP+CD34+ cell fraction compared to the SP-CD34+ cell fraction, the phenotypical profile of the two cell populations were comparable with regard to these antigens. The frequency of LTC-IC was markedly increased in SP+CD34+ cells compared to SP-CD34+ cells, in line with previous reports. We did not observe significant differences in short term engraftment (ANC>05, Trombocytes>20) with regard to percentage of SP+ cells. Moreover, the number of CD34 positive cells reinfused and CFU-C was not correlated to the number of SP positive cells, but number of CD34+ cells were correlated to CFU-C. In conclusion, Immature SP+ cells are present at variable levels in CD34+ cells obtained from human PBPC. However, the level of SP cells was not correlated to the number of CD34+ cells or CFU-C, and variation in number of SP cells did not influence time to short term engraftment.",

Maccario (1) Recently it has been demonstrated that also MSC express several TLR (TLR 1-6 and 9). Aim of the study was to investigate the effect of human MSC on immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion induced in vitro by TLR3/TLR3-ligand interaction. In preliminary experiments, we observed that addition of the TLR3-ligand Poly-IC (20 ug/ml) to MSC culture determined up-regulation of surface HLA-class I (MFI 204 in the presence vs. MFI 77 in the absence of Poly-IC) and a sharp increase in IL-6 production (17,5 ng/ml in the presence vs. 0.9 ng/ml in the absence of Poly-IC). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of two healthy donors (Don) were then cultured in the presence or absence of Poly-IC and of autologous (auto) or allogeneic (allo) MSC (PBMC:MSC ratio, 40:1);10 ng/ml of rIL-2 were added to culture medium. After 7-day culture, a higher % of activated B-lymphocytes (CD27bright on gated CD20+ cells) was observed in the presence rather than in the absence of MSC (Don 1: PBMC alone 12%, PBMC+Poly-IC 23%, PBMC+Poly-IC+MSC-auto 56%, PBMC+Poly-IC+MSCallo 33%. Don 2: PBMC alone 2%, PBMC+Poly-IC 6%, PBMC+Poly-IC+MSC-auto 22%, PBMC+Poly-IC+MSC-allo 12%). Addition of allo-MSC caused more than 50% decrease in cell recovery evaluated after 10-day culture, if compared with addition of Poly-IC or Poly-IC+MSC-auto. Evaluation of Ig secretion (ng/ml) in 10-day culture supernatants demonstrated an enhancing effect of both auto and allo MSC on IgG and IgM secretion for both Don, and on IgA secretion only for Don 1 (Table) . Further experiments are in progress to confirm data obtained with TLR3-ligand and to investigate the role of other TLR-ligands.",

The H and H-active antigens are strongly expressed on CD34+ and in megakaryocytic progenitors. The H-antigen seems to play an important roll in mediating stroma cell adhesion (fibroblasts and extra cellular matrix proteins) and so improving megakaryocytic expansion and long-term preservation. Objective and methods: The aim of our study was to find a possible relationship between the patient ABO group and the platelet as well as the leukocyte engraftment. We made a retrospective study including all the patients submitted to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) from June 1996 to June 2006 in our center. We also evaluated other factors influencing engraftment like gender, age, diagnosis and CD34+ doses. Results: Engraftment data was only available in 129 of a total of 167 patients submitted to ASCT. Platelet and leukocyte engraftment was delayed in all patients who received a CD34+ ASCT dose lower than 3x10 6 per Kg (table 1) . Analyzing the data we found that group O patients who received a CD34+ ASCT dose above 5x10 6 per Kg presented a later engraftment than the non-group O patients (table 2) . Conclusion: ABO group may play an important role in platelet engraftment especially at higher CD34+ doses delaying platelet recovery in Group O patients.",

Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, IL) While umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an attractive source for transplantation, major disadvantage is its relative low number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A rational approach thus involves ex-vivo expansion of UCB-derived HSCs. However, the current expansion processes are laborious, expensive and also providing unwanted differentiated sub-populations. As it has been reported that the multidrug transporter MDR1 (ABCB1) gene product (Pgp) is over-expressed in various stem cells relatively to their differentiated progeny, we compared the expression level and activity of Pgp in UCBderived CD133+ HSCs relatively to CD133-cells. Moreover, we reasoned that higher Pgp activity in these CD133+ HSCs will make them more resistant to cytostatic agents as colchicine (COL) and thus its administration during the expansion process could be applicable to their selection and enrichment. Towards this end, we isolated CD133+ HSCs from UCB of various donors (n=6) by CD133immunomagnetic separation (MACS). Pgp-expression level was measured by flow cytometry using the Pgp-antibodies MRK-16, and its activity was measured by efflux assay of the Pgp-substrate Rh123. We further analyzed the CD133+/Pgp+ and the CD34+/CD38-/Pgp+ subsets during 8 weeks of standard procedure of their expansion in the absence or the presence of COL. Analyses of freshly isolated CD133+ HSCs indicated that the majority (>92%) of these HSCs express Pgp on the cell surface. Moreover, the Pgp is functional as the cellular level of Rh123 was approx. 260-fold lower relatively to CD133 negative cells and the Pgp modulator R-VRP inhibited the efflux of Rh123. Analyses after ex-vivo expansion demonstrated a significant dose-dependent enrichment of CD133+ cell fraction by COL. At optimal COL dose (2.5 ng/ml), the fold-enrichment of CD133+/CD34+/CD38-HSCs was 5.2 \u00b1 2.3 higher than in its absence. At 8 weeks of expansion the CD133+ cell number increased from 10 5 cells to 0.56\u00b10.19 x10 9 and 1.60\u00b10.41 x10 9 in the absence and presence of COL, respectively and thus the total yield of CD133+ HSCs after expansion in the presence of COL was 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 fold higher than in its absence. The long exposure of CD133+ HSCs to COL at the expansion process did not affect their ability to form various hematopoietic colonies in semisolid culture after COL removal. In conclusion, we show that UCBderived HSCs over-express a functional Pgp and this may be beneficial for their expansion ex-vivo towards clinical transplantation. Cord blood (CB) constitutes an easily accessible source of hematopoietic progenitors suitable for transplantation and recently its feasibility as a source of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is assessed. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal culture conditions for the expansion of CB MSC, to assess their functional and immunophenotypic characteristics and to compare them with bone marrow (BM) MSC from children. Eighteen CB samples from full term deliveries were analyzed and the results were compared with MSC from 23 BM from children with benign hematological disorders without BM involvement (ITP n=13, autoimmune neutropenia n=10). Culture conditions were initially based on the technique used for the isolation of BM MSC and sequentially different culture conditions were tried in order to optimize MSC expansion. They included different cell concentrations, enrichment of the culture medium with FGF-2, different concentrations of the specially selected FCS, different culture surface area and pretreatment of the culture plate with FCS. BM derived mononuclear cells formed stroma that reached confluency in 17\u00b10.9 days. Cell doubling time was 3.6\u00b10.15 days at the first passage (P1) and remained the same until P3. Following stroma formation, no hematopoietic markers were expressed whereas CD105, CD29, CD44, CD146 were detected at a percentage of > 85%. Histochemical and molecular analysis showed that BM MSC had the capacity to differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes. Isolation of CB MSC was achieved in 25% of the samples cultured under optimal conditions which were found to be the higher initial concentration of cells (3x10 6 cells/cm\u00b2), the enrichment of the culture medium with FCS (20% compared to 10% of the BM protocol), the addition of 5ng/ml FGF-2 (1ng/ml in the BM protocol), the pretreatment of the culture surface with FCS and the initial volume of the sample (> 40 ml). MSC were morphologically similar to the ones derived from BM, but appeared late in culture requiring 34 days to reach confluency and 55 days from P1 to P2. Immunophenotypic analysis of P1 cells showed no expression of CD34 while CD45 ranged from 0-17.83% and CD105 ranged from 49-83%. CFU-F colonies were developed in one case. These findings suggest that CB cannot be regarded as a sufficient source of MSC for clinical use. Intense research should continue on the optimal culture conditions and further focus on the search of alternative sources.",

Sanchez-Hernandez, C. Manzano, D. Barroso, G. Iglesias, P. Balsalobre, D. Serrano, R. Carrion, A. Gomez-Pineda, J. Diez-Martin, I. Bu\u00f1o Hosp. G.U. Gregorio Mara\u00f1on (Madrid, E) Background: Allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cell transplantation (SCT) shows some advantages (HLA matching requirements or availability) respect to SCT using other sources of matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cells. However, it is correlated with slower engraftment, increasing risk of infections and early mortality. It has been recently shown that co-infusion of third party donor (TPD) CD34+ cells (dual SCT) is useful to speed up engraftment. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of lineage-specific chimerism quantification in the management of this transplant setting. Patients and methods: 8 dual SCT (Tables 1, 2) in 7 patients (1 CML-BC, 2 AML-M2, 1 AML-M4, 1 ALL-Ph+, 1 biphen. ALL, 1 NHL). Chimerism was analyzed by STR-PCR (AmpFlSTR SGM Plus, Applied Biosystems; sensitivity 1%) and quantitative real-time PCR (qrt-PCR) of null alleles and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (Light Cycler, Roche; sensitivity 0,01%). Peripheral blood (PB) and leukocyte lineages (T cells, CD3+, and myeloid cells, CD15+), isolated by positive selection using automated immunomagnetic technology (AutoMACS, Miltenyi Biotec), were analyzed weekly. Bone marrow (BM) was analyzed at days +30, +100, +180 and +365). Results: 4/8 cases showed recipient cells in PB after dual SCT during a median period of 12 days (range 4-18 days). In three patients no TPD cells were observed after dual SCT. 5/8 cases showed initially TPD cells in PB which were progressively replaced by UCB cells. UCB complete chimerism (UCB-CC, absence of recipient and TPD cells even in qrt-PCR assays) was acquired in a median of 22.5 days (range 18-39). In 3/8 cases, recipient cells were found once CC had been acquired, which allowed early diagnosis of 1 graft rejection and 2 relapses. One patient developed a ganglionar relapse in CC. T cells (CD3+) were mainly of UCB origin early after dual SCT and reached UCB-CC a median of 7 days (range 0-21) before PB. However, myeloid cells (CD15+) derived primarily from the TPD and reached CC together with the PB. TPD cellularity favoured early engraftment (before UCB-CC took place) in 3 cases. Conclusions: Lineage-specific chimerism quantification allowed a close monitoring of the dynamics of engraftment of cells of both donors which is of key importance in this SCT setting. Moreover, lineage-specific chimerism analysis was useful to diagnose one graft rejection and two out of three relapses.",

Soci\u00e9 Hopital Saint Louis (Paris, F) We have performed a phase II study on 16 dCBT from 2004 to 2006. Ten patients had high risk malignant disorders (ALL=1, AML+MDS=6, CML=3) and 6 high risk of rejection (SAA=4, PNH=1 and Fanconi Anemia=1). Among them, 4 received a dCBT as a rescue of previous non-engrafted transplants (2 SAA, 1 AML and 1 CML). Analyses of T, B and NK cells phenotype were performed once a month during the first 3 months and every two months until 12 months. The median age was 21 years (11-42), the median weight 63 kg (30-90) and the median follow-up time was 6 months (3-18). Conditioning regimen varied according to disease (myeloablative) or second transplant (reduced intensity), all except two patients have received ATG. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted in Cyclosporine A + steroids in 12 patients and associated to MMF in 4. Results: 2 patients did not engraft (both with SAA), one patient relapsed 8 days after dCBT, and 13 patients engrafted at a median of 23 days (14-42). Chimerism available in 12 patients before day 100 showed both CB units in 7 patients. After day 100, in 9 evaluable patients, 3 patients had evidence of both CB units engraftment. Grades II-III acute GVHD was observed in 5 patients (grade II in 4 and grade III in 1) and chronic GVHD in 7 out of 12 at risk. During the first 100 days, 9 CMV infections were diagnosed; 4 HSV (resistant to acyclovir); 3 HHV6 infections; 3 EBV infections; 3 adenovirus disease, 4 SRV infections, 3 septicemia, 3 fungal infections, 1 disseminated toxoplasmosis. After day 100, we observed 4 CMV infections, 1 CMV and 1 adenovirus disease, 3 HSV and 1 EBV infections. Severe lymphopenia was observed in all patients (median of 259mm\u00b3 at 3 months (n=14); 389 at 6 months (n=13) and 480 at 12 months (n=8). Median number of CD3/CD4 at 3, 6 and 12 months were: 8, 15 and 46 mm\u00b3 respectively; of NK cells 203, 249 and 115mm\u00b3, and of B cells was 0, 0 and 110 mm\u00b3, respectively. At 6 months overall survival was 58\u00b114% and event-free survival was 52\u00b114%. Six patients died, 2 of relapse and 4 from infections. Three out of 4 patients have been rescued of previous non engraftment and are alive and well (4 -18 months after dCBT). In conclusion, despite the short follow-up dCBT seems to be an option to treat patients with high risk diseases and without a suitable compatible HLA donor. High incidence of infections and delayed immune recovery are major problems after dCBT. In absence of related or unrelated donor, cord blood is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells. We report here the preliminary results of unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in adults in France. Between October 2003 and April 2006, 42 patients (pts) received UCBT after RIC associating cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg (D-6), fludarabine 40 mg/m\u00b2/d (D-6 to D-2) and total body irradiation at 2 Gy. GVHD prophylaxis associated ciclosporine et mycophenolate mofetyl from D-3. G-CSF was started from D+1 until 5x10 9 WBC/L. Pts characteristics were: median age: 48\u00b113 (16-69); weight: 64\u00b111 kg (45-90); recipient gender: 15 males/27 females; CMV seropositivity in 24 pts; major and minor ABO incompatibility in 18 and 9 respectively. Diagnosis: 3 ALL (1 CR1, 2 CR2), 21 AML (8 CR1; 12 CR2; 1 CR3), 4 MDS, 2 CML, 2 CLL, 1 Waldenstr\u00f6m, 3 follicular lymphoma, 1 Hodgkin disease, 3 myeloma, 1 PNH, 1 SAA. Five pts received double cord units. Graft characteristics in the 37 single unit UCBT were: number of nuclear cells and CD34 collected: 3.63x10 7 /kg (2.6-5,2) et 1.4x10 5 /kg (0.5-6.5); HLA compatibility 4/6 in 27 (in HLA class I: 17, class I plus class II: 10). Results: median day to obtain 0.5x10 9 ANC: D15\u00b18 (0-39). Full chimerism was present in 29 pts, autologous reconstitution in 2, early relapse in 6 pts (not yet evaluated in 5).

Chiusolo, G. Reddiconto, S. Sica, G. Leone Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, I) Hemopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) can be identified by the expression of the CD34 antigen. Previous studies showed that HPC circulates in the peripheral blood during engraftment after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Thus we investigated the kinetics of appearance of CD34+ cells after autologous PBSCT (aPBSCT), its correlation with haematological engraftment and the immunophenotypic characteristics of the HPC. We studied the percentage of CD34+ cell in peripheral blood every other day from day +2 until patient discharge in 29 patients (pts) (table 1) treated with aPBSCT for haematological malignancy. These cells were detectable starting from day +8 after transplantation. The peak of the CD34+ cells was at day +12 (range 10-16) when the number of CD34+cells/mmc was 6.85 (range 0.6-116). Statistical analysis showed a significant negative correlation (r-0.44, p=0.022) between age of pts and peak of CD34+, while a significant positive correlation (r0.41, p=0.031) between age and day of CD34+ peak. There was a significant correlation between total number of CD34+cells/kg infused and percentage of CD34+ peak (r0.42, p=0.027). Furthermore we observed a significant positive correlation between day of CD34+ peak and time to absolute lymphocyte count >0.5x10 9 /l (r0.54, p=0.003) and to absolute neutrophil count >0.5x10 9 /l (r0.47, p=0.012). Subsequently we compared the immunophenotypic profiles of the HPC circulating after aPBSCT in 12 pts (table 1) on day +11 and+14 to profile of the HPC mobilized in 3 pts using chemotherapy and growth factors administration. The CD34+ cell subset almost entirely expressed HLA-Dr, 50% of cells were CD38+, 74% were CD133+ on day 11 and 59% on day 14, only 47% on day 11 and 19% on day 14 expressed CD33 (myeloid committed). Thus the majority of HPC were pluripotent cells. Interestingly the major difference between HPC circulating after aPBSCT and during mobilization was the expression of the CD117: 41% and 36% on day 11 and 14 after a PBSCT respectively and 4% only in mobilized HPC ( figure 1 ). This result could clearly differentiate mobilized HPC from circulating HPC after transplant. Thus the latter cells might be considered as surrogate marker of bone marrow reserve. Furthermore they seem to be more prone to interact with the hemopoietic niche thought the persistent high expression of CD117, adhesion molecule. Further analysis of CD34+ subset are ongoing to confirm these data and to clarify their significance. The incidence of graft failure in patients undergoing volunteer unrelated donor(VUD) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) is 2-5%. As a precautionary measure, many centres perform autologous backup stem cell harvest prior to transplantation. Due to the potential risk of leukaemic transformation with the use of G-CSF, many centres prefer to perform bone marrow harvests in patients with myeloid malignancies. However, the cost of each BMH is approximately \u00a33000, and the procedure carries the inherent risk of general anaesthesia, together with the need for inpatient stay and possible blood transfusion post procedure. We retrospectively identified 53 patients with myeloid malignancies who received a back up BMH performed over a 4 year period, all of whom underwent VUD HSCT(6 myeloablative,47 RIC). Median age of recipients was 52 years(range:16-71). The median platelet count was 141.5(range:15-380), with median BM cellularity at harvest was 35%(range:5-95%). The median CD34+ yield of 0.65x106/kg(range:0.3-6.88). 65% patients required blood transfusion post procedure(median of 2 units) with a median admission of 2 nights. On analysis, there was no correlation between age or platelet count and CD34+ yield. However, patients with BM cellularity >25% had significantly improved median CD34+ yield compared with those <25% (0.99 vs 0.35, p=0.004). Stem cells were re-infused in only 2 patients(pancytopenia post-adenovirus infection=1, secondary autologous transplant=1). Both patients died from transplantrelated complications. Our data suggest very infrequent use of backup BMH even for VUD HSCT. In addition, the cell yield from these procedures is often sub-optimal. As the procedure involves considerable cost, exposure to potential complications, blood transfusion and increasing demand on storage space, we propose that back up bone marrow harvests should be considered on individual basis.",

Cerretti (1) Umbilical cord blood (UCB) represents a valid alternative haematopoietic stem cell source for pts who need an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) but lack an HLA matched related donor. The widespread applicability of UCB has been limited by the low number of cells contained in a single CB unit, which can negatively affect the probability of hematopoieitc engraftment. The increased risk of graft failure after unrelated UCB SCT represents an indication to cryopreserve patient's stem cells as rescue. Aim: In order to re-define whether the back-up collection continues to be mandatory for pts undergoing UCBT, we have reviewed the use of stem cell back-up in a large cohort of UCBT recipients for whom a stem cell rescue was prospectively planned. Methods: We have collected data from 4 SCT Units in Rome. The resulting database consisted of a cohort of 118 pts (81 children\\37 adults), submitted to UCBT between June1995 and October 2006. There were 94 AL (32 AML/62 ALL), 10 MDS, 6 Lymphomas and 8 other diseases. Median age and body weight was 12 years (1-60) and 44 kg (6-100), respectively. Median number of infused NCx10 7 /kg, CD34+x10 5 /kg and CFU-GMx10 4/ kg was 3.3, 2.3 and 1.5, respectively. According to serologic (class-I) or high resolution HLA-typing (class-II), 4 pts received an HLA matched UCB, which was different at 1 or 2 HLA loci in 51 and 59 pts, respectively. A stem cell rescue was provided from 116 out of 118 pts. Results: Overall, 103 pts engrafted (87%) within 100 days with a median time to achieve PMN>500 of 25 days (11-99), 11 pts died of TRM. Four pts, all transplanted before 2002 and receiving NC < 2.5x10 7 /kg, failed to engraft and infused the autologous back-up at 38, 46, 48 and 50 days, respectively. An autologous reconstitution was observed on day +74 in 1 patient, while 2 pts died of acute GVHD and 1 of infection.This analysis has shown that the back-up was required in only 3.4% of pts and was successful in only 0.8% of all transplanted pts. Conclusions: At present, the significant improvement in the selection of both pts and cord blood units and the use of double UCB units have significantly reduce the risk of graft failure after UCBT. Moreover, reservation of a second UCB unit or the use of an haploidentical related donor can be offered to pts who need an urgent stem cell rescue following UCBT failure. Therefore, the policy to provide pts of an autologous stem cell rescue should not be considered mandatory for UCBT procedure.",

Reinhardt, P. Schauwecker, K. Schwarz, E. Krug, B. Maccari, H. Schrezenmeier, M. Wiesneth IKT Ulm (Ulm, D) Purpose: Bone marrow (BM) is an important source of hematopoetic progenitor cells (HPC). For small volume recipients, AB0-incompatible transplants (Tx), cryopreservation or manipulation, the collected BM requires a safe and effective red blood cell-(RBC) and volume-reduction without significantloss of HPC. Methods: 40 BM-aspirates for transplantations requiring an RBC-and vol.-reduction were analysed retrospectively. ACD-A was added to the collected BM to 10% (vol/vol) and transferred to a BM processing set (Gambro, BCT) in the clean room. The BM was processed >4 times on a CobeSpectra cell separator using the respective BM-setting (all Gambro, BCT) in essence following manufacturer instructions. Enriched MNC fractions were usually collected sequentially in 2 bags. Vol.-and RBC-reduction, MNC-, CD34and CD3-recovery as well as clonogenic assays (MethoCult, StemCell Technologies) were assessed. Results: 28 BM-Tx were AB0-incompatible, 27 Tx were for patients weighing <40kg (6-38 kg) and most transplants were to be partially cryopreserved. The original BM vol. ranged 310-2228 ml with an average Hct of 29% i.e. 81-624 ml of RBC. Cytapheresis lasted 100-150 min. The BM-vol. was processed 4 to 16 times (average 8). The initial vol. was reduced in average to 14% (final volume 61-359 ml) and a Hct of 6% (RBC 1-29 ml) in collection bag 1; in bag 2 a vol. of 34-124 ml (8%) and an average Hct of 5%. As expected the recovery of NC was low (bag 1=34%, bag 2=6%), better for MNC (bag 1=55%, bag 2=10%)and very good for CD34 (bag 1=83%, bag 2=13%) and CD3 (bag 1=86%, bag 2=14%). The recovery of BFU-E and CFU-GEMM in 20 assayed transplants revealed no loss of HPC, but instead suggested an improved regenerative potential in vitro of the volume-and RBCreduced transplants (recovery BFU-E median=133% p=0.28, CFU-GEMM median=169% p=0.0009, all MethoCult). Conclusions: To maintain the Hct between 2-7 % in the collected MNC-layer is technically challenging. Processing the initial vol. 4-6 times usually allows the recovery of >80% of CD34 and CD3 cells (bag 1), additional proc. (bag 2) may be useful as back-up. Tests to clarify the surprisingly high recovery of CFU are currently in progress. Cytapheresis is an efficient and GMP-compatible technique to reduce RBC`s and vol. of BM-Tx even for AB0-incompatible Tx of infants or further processing without major loss of HPC`s.",

Giustolisi Ospedale Ferrarotto (Catania, I) Number of infused cells has an important effect on patient's survival. Patients receiving a number of CD34+ cells below median have an inferior survival than those receiving a superior amount of progenitor cells. Median CD34+ cells content of Bone Marrow harvests in normal donors is usually reported to be between 2.4 and 2.7 x 10 6 /CD34 cells and that of TNC (total nucleated cells) between to be 2.3 and 3.2 x 10 8 /Kg. In order to increase the median number of CD34 cells infused we have optimized our bone marrow harvest techniques. 60 consecutive patients who underwent in our institution HSC Transplant from HLA identical sibling using BM or PBSC were studied; 35 patients received BM harvests and 25 received PBSC with a target infusion dose of 5 x10 6 /Kg CD34+. The HSC source (BM or PBSC) was choosen at physician discretion on the basis of disease stage, donor sex and ABOincompatibility. Optimization of BM Harvests was obtained using large and multiple-bore needle (11 gauges), small volume of aspiration (3-5 ml), performing 5-10 skin punctures for each side and allowing only to experienced physicians to perform the procedure. During this study our laboratory participated to an external quality control (UKNEQAS) for CD34 enumeration obtaining results comprised between 25-75 percentiles. /Kg recipient weight also in PBSC group (range 3.4-10.2 -p= 0.7). GVHD prophylaxis was done in both groups with CSA plus MTX and median number of MTX doses was not different in BM and PBSC groups (3.41 versus 3.48), Engraftment time to Neutrophils > 0.5 x 10 9 /L was comparable in the two groups (respectively 18.3 in BM vs 18.0 in PBSC group,log rank p value = 0.4). A count of PLT > 50 x 10e9/L was reached faster in PBSC group (median 15.1 days) than to BM group (median 18.2 days -Log rank p value = 0.08).

El-Solh King Faisal Specialist Hospital (Riyadh, SA) Background: For patients (pts) lacking a suitable matched related donor, unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) has emerged as a valid alternative with many advantages such as easy procurement, and acceptable outcome even with partial HLA mismatches. We report here our experience at King Faisal Specialist Hospital (KFSHRC) in 51 pts who underwent partially matched unrelated CBT. Patients and methods: From January 2003 till October 2006, we performed 54 CBT on 51 pts; second transplants (3 pts) are excluded from this analysis. Conditioning was according to the disease in addition to antithymocyte globulins (ATG); 2 pts received reduced intensity conditioning. GvHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporin and methylprednisolone. All pts received GCSF from day +1 until engraftment. Results: Forty three pts engrafted (88%), median time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 0.5 x 10 9 /L was 17 days (range, 10-49 days), and median time to a platelet count of 20 x 10 9 /L was 45 days (range, 18-149); chimerism, assessed by short tandem repeats (STR), ranged from 24% to 100%. Acute GvHD grade II-IV developed in 12 pts (23 %) and acute GvHD grade III-IV developed in 6 pts (12%). CMV infection developed in 26 pts (51%), 2 of them developed CMV disease (retinitis in one and pneumonitis in another). Twenty nine pts are currently alive (56.9 %), with a probability of overall and event-free survival at 46 months of 45.5% and 35.5 % respectively. A trend of improvement was noted in the results over the years; when calculated for pts transplanted in 2003-2004 only, the one-year probability of overall and event free survival was 51.5% and 43.5% respectively versus a one-year probability of overall and event free survival of 67.7% and 50.5% respectively for pts transplanted in [2005] [2006] . For pts with acute leukemia (11 pts), the one-year probability of overall and event-free survival was 40.4% and 36.4 % respectively, and for pts with immune deficiency disorders (16 pts), the one-year probability of overall and event-free survival was 55% and 50% respectively. Conclusions: At KFSHRC, CBT offers a reasonable chance of event free survival to pts who lack matched related donors with acceptable results. CMV infection is a major cause of morbidity in this population. The improvement noted in the survival of pts in the 2005-2006 era is probably due to a better selection of pts as well as improved supportive care and prompt management of complications.",

Kerguelen Fuentes, M. Martin Salces, F. Hern\u00e1ndez-Navarro, R. Arrieta H.U. La Paz (Madrid, E) Previous studies have proposed combination of various factors that predict poor mobilization after GCSF stimulation. However, there is no single clinical or laboratory test that reliably correlates with PBPC mobilization potential before growth factor administration. Peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (PCD34) reliably correlates with PBPC mobilization and yield after growth factor administration. We have prospectively followed 130 autologous PBPC transplant candidates, from the time of initial evaluation to transplant, to evaluate factors that predict poor autologous PBPC collection. The patients'median age was 42 (range 1-68).76 of the 130 patients were diagnosed of non-Hodgkin's disease, 33 had Hodking's disease and the remaining 21 had Multiple Myeloma. Between inclusion criterios were patients which were mobilized with G-CSF a 10-20 mg/kg. Our evaluation showed platelet count prior to growth factor administration significantly correlated with total CD34+ cell yield (spearman: r = 0.281,p< 0.05). In adition,daily platelet count during PBSC harvest correlated with CD34+ cell yield for the day (spearman: r = 0.267,p>0.05 in the first harvest, spearman: r = 0.636, p< 0.05 in the second harvest, spearman: r = 0.671, p< 0.05 in the third harvest , spearman: r = -1.000, p> 0.05 in the four harvest ). Using multiple linear regression model (F=19.1,p <0.001, R2 0.64 ), we have determined type of disease (p=0.037) and platelet count (p=0.031), significantly correlate with total CD34+ cell yield but not patients\u00b4s age (p=0.7). Further analysis showed low baseline platelet count before growth factor administration prediction poor mobilization. Using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC), we have determined that platelet count of 258,000 ul was the best cut/off collecting at least 2 million Kg CD34+ cells with sensitivity of 54 % and specificity of 100% . Baseline platelet count is a sensitive indicator of autologus PBPC mobilization and may be considereted prior to growth factor administration to determinate optimal period to mobilization patients for autologous PBPC collection.",

Cupelli (1) Background: more than 60% of patients with haematological malignancies are submitted to allogeneic stem cell transplant utilizing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from HLA identical sibling. The influence of the lymphocyte subsets in the apheretic product on the outcome of transplant is not clear. Aim: the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the lymphocyte subsets and the CD34+ cell dose on the outcome of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Methods: thirty-nine patients receiving PBSCT from HLA identical sibling for haematological malignancies (16 acute myeloid leukaemias, 3 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, 7 multiple myelomas, 6 lymphomas, 5 myelodisplastic syndromes, 1 aplastic anemia and 1 chronic myeloproliferative disease) were analyzed. T cells (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+), B cells (CD19+) NK cells (CD56+/16+) and CD34+ cells were evaluated in the apheretic product by immunophenotypic analysis using appropriate monoclonal antibodies enumerating each subpopulation as absolute cell count and proportion of the total lymphocytes. Results: median number of infused cells per kilogram of recipient are reported in the table. In multivariate analysis, early disease status at transplant and a lower number of CD19+ cells were associated with a better overall survival (OS). Risk of death was increased in patients receiving >0.5 x 10 8 CD19+ cells infused/kg (HR = 6.4, p = 0.01). The incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was 36%. In multivariate analysis the disease status and the number of CD19+ cells correlated significantly with the incidence of acute GVHD (p= 0.03). A trend for higher transplant related mortality (TRM) was seen with a greater number of CD19+ cells, but this correlation was not significant (p= 0.14). Disease-free-survival (DFS) was better for patients receiving a lower number of CD19+ and CD56+ cells (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). Eleven of 36 patients at risk experienced chronic GVHD, not influenced, however, by lymphocyte subsets.",

Marec-Berard Centre Leon Berard (Lyon, F) Purpose: The collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) by leukapheresis requires two venous accesses (VA), one for the inflow and one for the outflow. The use of a totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD) has never been reported in this setting. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the use of TIVAD (systematically inserted at the time of diagnosis) for performing leukapheresis by means of a continuous flowblood cell separator (Spectra-Gambro BCT, France). The objective was to obtain 2x106 CD34+/kg per graft. The second VA was either peripheral when possible or a temporary central VA inserted before the first apheresis. The study was conducted between 01-2000 and 06-2005 on 64 patients (including 41 children) who required intensification for the treatment of a solid tumor. Results: Mean body weight was 26kg (range 8-91kg) for a median age of 8.5 years (range 0.7-66years). 115 leukapheresis were performed with a mean of 1.79 apheresis/patient. The second VA was cubital vein in 85 procedures and a temporary central VA in 30. The mean duration of each apheresis was 3 hours (range 30-274mn). The mean flow rate was 41.3ml/min (range 12-85ml/mn). The mean collection rate was 59.2% for CD34+cells and 70% for mononuclear cells. The total number of CD34+cells collected was 2.5x106/kg per apheresis (range 0.3-20x106/kg), and 5.9 x106/kg per patient (range 2.4-33x106/kg). Several complications occurred during hospitalization for leukapheresis: 1 catheter-related sepsis (0.86%), 4 catheter occlusions (3.47%) and 8 cases of hemodynamic instability related to extracorporeal volume. Weight <10Kg is a risk factor of complication (p=0.0006). Only 2/115 procedures were interrupted because of complication (1 obstruction of peripheral catheter and 1 catheter-related sepsis). Conclusion: TIVAD are effective and safe for PBSC collection and is consistent qualitatively and quantitatively with published reports. Placement of a second central VA (requiring general anaesthesia for children) could be avoided in a majority of patients.",

Antonenas, K. Bradstock, P.J. Shaw, D.J. Gottlieb Westmead Hospital (Sydney, AUS) Background: Engraftment after Unrelated Cord Blood (UCB) transplantation is highly dependent on total nucleated cell (TNC) count and CD34+ cell content. Typically TNC and CD34+ counts provided to transplant centres are determined before freezing of CB units. No data are available to determine whether thawed CB units actually contain the TNC and CD34+ cell numbers determined by collection centres. We compared cell numbers after CB units were thawed immediately before infusion with those provided by CB Banks. Methods: 39 CB units were received at our laboratory for transplantation. All except 3 CB units were thawed without washing prior to infusion. Units had been stored in liquid nitrogen for a mean duration of 3.5 years (range 1-7 yrs) prior to infusion. TNC and CD34+ counts were determined immediately post-thaw. Results: The mean recovery for TNC count for the 39 units analysed was 78% (range 54-108%). 14/39 CB units had TNC recoveries < 70%. 11/39 CB units had <2x10 7 TNC/Kg according to post-thaw counts. Eight received a second cord unit but 3 received a single unit (cell doses 1.5, 1.48 and 1.6 x10 7 TNC/Kg respectively). The mean recovery for viable CD34+ cell count was 67% (range 10-160%). 19/31 CB units had viable CD34 recoveries < 70%. 29/39 CB units contained <2x10 5 viable CD34/Kg according to post-thaw counts. Conclusions: There is a consistent reduction in TNC and CD34+ cell numbers observed by transplant centres postthaw when compared with those reported before freezing. This may result in infusion of cell numbers considered inadequate for successful CB transplantation. Correlation between post-thaw TNC and CD34+ cell counts and transplant outcomes is required. Pending this, we recommend that all CB Banks provide TNC and CD34+ cell numbers on thawed pilot vials to provide some guide to transplant physicians at the time of unit selection.",

We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of a cytarabinebased stem cell mobilisation schedule in heavily pre-treated patients who had previously failed cyclosphophamide-based mobilisation. Methods: Five patients who had previously failed peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation with intravenous cyclophosphamide 1.5 mg/m\u00b2 (single dose) and lenograstim 5mcg/kg/day received cytarabine-based stem cell mobilisation. Patients received six doses of intravenous cytarabine 800 mg/m\u00b2 12-hourly (total dose 4.8 g/m\u00b2 cytarabine); lenograstim 5 mcg/kg/day was commenced the day after chemotherapy (day 4). Peripheral blood CD34 count was estimated daily from day 14, and peripheral blood stem cell harvest performed if the CD34 count was > 5 cells/uL. Results: Five patients (4 with myeloma, 1 with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) received cytarabine-based stem cell mobilisation. The median age was 56 years (range 45 -61). The patients had received a median of three (range 3 -5) prior lines of chemotherapy, which included prior melphalan autologous stem cell transplant in four out of five patients. The patients had failed a median of one (range 1 -2) prior cyclophosphamide-based stem cell mobilisations. Two patients required hospital admission for febrile neutropenia (one patient) or bleeding (one patient) following cytarabinebased stem cell mobilisation. Three out of five patients required platelet transfusions for severe thrombocytopenia; none required red cells. There were no treatment-related deaths. All patients achieved a peripheral blood CD34 count > 5 cells/uL and underwent apheresis. The median CD34positive stem cell harvest was 4.4 x10 6 /kg (range 1.92 -7.16), achieved over a median of 2 harvest days (range 1 -2). Conclusion: Cytarabine-based stem cell mobilisation schedule is highly effective in patients who have previously failed cyclophosphamide mobilisation, but may lead to hospital admission for febrile neutropenia or bleeding. Patients receiving cytarabine-based stem cell mobilisation should be monitored closely and facilities for rapid admission and treatment should be available.",

McFarland (1) Background: AMD3100, a selective antagonist of CXCR4, mobilizes long-term repopulating HSCs with adequate homing and engraftment capacity. The aim of this study was to generate pharmacokinetic results for AMD3100 after a 240 \u00b5g/kg subcutaneous injection (s.c.) in Multiple Myeloma (MM), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin's Disease (HD)patients that had been pretreated with G-CSF. Methods: PK parameters were determined from samples obtained immediately prior to dosing, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the injection of the first dose of AMD3100, and just prior to apheresis. Samples were available from 4 MM pts, 3 NHL pts, and 5 HD pts. Results: Following s.c. administration at 240 \u00b5g/kg median maximum plasma concentrations of 1020 ng ml-1, 821 ng ml-1, and 872 ng ml-1 were observed at 0.15-1 h for MM, NHL, and HD patients respectively. Furthermore, MM, NHL, and HD patients had median elimination half lives of 4.68 h, 4.46 h, and 3.69 h and median area under the concentration-time curves of 3973 hr*ng ml-1, 2781 h*ng ml-1, and 3305 h*ng ml-1 respectively.

Malischnik, E. Rohde, K. Schallmoser, V. Bjelic-Radisic, G. Lanzer, W. Linkesch, D. Strunk Medical University Graz (Graz, A) Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an easily accessible source for multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and is generally believed to provide MSC with a higher proliferative potential compared to adult bone marrow (BM). Limitations in cell number and strict dependence of expansion procedures from selected lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS) obviously hampered the progress of clinical applications with UCB-derived MSC. We analyzed isolation and proliferative potential of human UCB-MSC as compared to BM-MSC under optimized ex vivo culture conditions. We further investigated the impact of human platelet lysate (HPL) as an alternative to replace fetal bovine serum for clinical scale expansion of both types of MSC. Progenitor cell function was determined by CFU-F assays and correlated to acquisition of cellular senescence over time. MSC functions were studied combined with multiplex cytokine display and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. MSC could be reproducibly propagated from UCB with and without FBS. MSC propagation was effective in 46% of UCB samples compared to 100% of BM samples. A UCB sample volume > 40mL correlated with a higher probability of successful outgrowth. Once established, the proliferation kinetics of UCB-MSC did not differ significantly from that of BM-MSC under optimized culture conditions resulting in a mean maximum of 40 population doublings after only 10 weeks. A clinical quantity of more than 1 billion MSC could be obtained from BM-MSC within shorter time compared to UCB-MSC due to significant differences in primary cell amounts. Vascular regenerative function in matrigel assays in vitro was more efficient in BM-MSC. Functional integrity of UCB-MSC was further confirmed by testing their hematopoietic support and immune inhibitory properties. We demonstrate for the first time that human MSC can be obtained and propagated to a clinical quantity from UCB in a completely FBS-free system although with lower efficiency compared to BM. Surprisingly, our data argue against a generally superior proliferative potential of UCB-MSC. Additional functional differences indicate the need for further studies to select the appropriate cell source for defined therapeutic approaches. Recovery of neutrophil numbers after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is closely associated with graft CD34+ cell dose. Predicting the speed of platelet recovery is more difficult but would be of value given that a significant minority of patients experience delayed platelet recovery and bleeding complications after transplantation. In this study we retrospectively analysed the graft composition of 41 patients who underwent autologous transplantation, using peripheral blood stem cells to assess the utility of CD110 (c-mpl) expression on CD34+ cells as a predictor of platelet engraftment (ie. time to platelet count greater than 20 x 10 9 /L for seven consecutive days without the need for platelet transfusion). Absolute CD34+ cells and CD34 subsets expressing CD110 were enumerated using an in-house single platform viable CD34 flow cytometry assay (BMT, 2005) . Of the 41 patients 9 required at least 21 days for platelet engraftment. These patients received a median graft dose of 5.5 x 10 4 CD34+CD110+ cells/kg compared with a median dose of 16.0 x 10 4 cells/kg received by patients who experienced platelet engraftment within 21 days of transplant (p=0.002). In contrast, there was no difference in the number of CD34+ cells/kg infused (4.6 v 3.0 x 10 6 /kg for < versus >21 days to platelet engraftment respectively, p=0.07). There was a weak correlation between the absolute number of CD34+ cells and the number of CD34+CD110+ cells in the graft (r\u00b2 = 0.48). Similarly there was no correlation between the percentage of CD34+ cells expressing c-mpl and the speed of platelet engraftment (8.1 v 5.8%) for > or < 21 days for platelet engraftment respectively, p=0.39). Patients with >21 days platelet engraftment received platelet transfusions more often than those with <21 days for platelet engraftment (median 9 v 2 transfusions, p <0.001). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed, non parametric Mann Whitney U-test. The absolute number of CD34+/CD110+ cells /kg infused at time of transplantation appears to be an important factor identifying patients at risk of delayed (>21 days) platelet engraftment. Those with <6 x 10 4 are at particularly high risk of delayed (>21 days) platelet engraftment requiring multiple transfusion after transplantation.",

Lipton, M. Minden, V. Gupta, J. Kuruvilla, H. Messner Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, CAN) Over the last 3 years, the allogeneic BMT program at PMH conducted a prospective study using cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). A preliminary report (Kim et al, IBMTR 2007) showed an equivalent transplant outcome compared to fresh PBSCT in terms of overall survival, mortality and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In the current study, we analyzed the impact of cryopreservation on the recovery of absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) after allogeneic PBSCT. A total of 89 patients received cryopreserved PBSCT between Sep 2003~Dec 2005. 106 patients transplanted with fresh PBSCT between Jun 2001~Aug 2003 served as historical control. A gradual rise in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) was observed after allogeneic PBSCT for both groups. The absolute numbers varied considerably between individual patients. The overall pattern of lymphocyte recovery was indistinguishable (p=0.926) for both groups. A differnce in overall survival (p= 0.921), non relapse mortality (p=0.835) and recurrence rate (p= 0.342) was not observed. However a difference was seen when the outcome of patients with differing ALCs was examined separately. Cryopreserved and fresh PBSCT resulted in ALCs of >1.0x109/L on day 30 in 42 and 47% of patients (p=0.434).The overall survival of patients and their survival at distinct time points at 1 and 2 years with an ALC at day 30 of > 1.0x109/L was superior to that of patients with an ALC of <1.0x109/L. The observation was made for both cryopreserved (p=0.046) and fresh grafts (p=0.014). Based on the eqiuvalent outcome the data of both patient groups (n=195) were pooled to facilitate further subgroup analyses. The group with high ALC over 1.0x109/L showed 77% and 71% of 1-and 2-year(s) overall survival rates, while those with low ALC less than 1.0x109/L at day 30 showed 58% and 48% of survival, respectively (p=0.004). The 1-year non-relapse mortality was significantly different favoring a high ALC group (14\u00b14% vs 26\u00b15%, p=0.011). The high ALC group seemed to have a trend towards a lower incidence of recurrence compared to the group with a low ALC recovery (9% vs22%) (p=0.078). In conclusion, ALCs at day 30 can predict transplant outcomes including overall survival and non-relapse mortality after allogeneic PBSCT. Cryopreservation does not seem to influence lymphocyte recovery and transplant outcomes as measured by overall survival, non-relapse mortality and relapse after allogeneic PBSCT.",

Lasebai, K. Hill, C. Hurlock, J. Newman, N. McKeag, V. Kitchker, S. Churchill, D. Richardson, K. Orchard Southampton University Hospital (Southampton, UK) Introduction: As part of the quality management programme of the Wessex Blood and Marrow Transplantation service and in response to national health strategies to minimise blood product usage, we reviewed cellular blood product transfusion requirements during the transplant episode for patients undergoing autologous and allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). Objective: To report the cellular blood product transfusion requirements and costs for patients during the acute admission for autologous and allogeneic HSCT over a twelve month period from 2005-06. Design: Retrospective observational study Setting: Regional HSCT centre Patients: Autologous and Allogeneic HSCT recipients during their acute transplant episode. All autologous and 18/20 allogeneic transplants were performed with peripheral blood stem cells. 2/20 allogeneic transplants were performed with bone marrow alone. Method: Review of clinical and laboratory data of the patients admitted for HSCT in the financial year April 05 -March 06 (inclusive). Use of plasma components was not assessed, as these products were rarely used during the acute transplant phase. The cellular blood product requirements from the time of admission up to time of discharge were recorded. Results: 2/40 autologous transplant patients received no blood products.15/40 autologous recipients and 2/8 allogeneic recipients received no red blood cells (RBC). The typical blood product cost (based on median number of products received) was autologous -\u20ac1450, RIC allogeneic -\u20ac3583 and full intensity allogeneic -\u20ac6944. Conclusions: Results show a clear difference in the median blood product requirements dependent on the type of transplant. There was no difference in blood product requirements between BEAM and high dose Melphalan conditioning for the autologous recipients. The increased RBC requirements in 4/20 allograft recipients could be predicted from major ABO incompatibility or bone marrow as source of stem cells. The wide range of variability in platelet requirements in 5/20 of the allograft recipients was not predictable and depended on individual patient characteristics including cerebral haemorrhage, veno-occlusive disease and therapeutic anticoagulation. These results show that blood product costs are only a small proportion (approx. 5%) of the total cost of stem cell transplantation. The results of this study will be used as a standard of care for our future blood product usage to ensure this remains consistent. For successful engraftment an auto-PBSC graft should contain adequate number of CD34+ cells of at least 2x106/kg. Some factors related to patients such as advanced age, underlying disease, heavy pretreatment, radiotherapy prior to mobilization etc. may play important role at poor mobilization and collection. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficiency of subsequent attempts to mobilize and collect stem cells in poor mobilizing lymphoma and myeloma patients. Patients: Between 1999 and 2006 in 285 adult patients with myeloma (n=99) or lymphoma (n=186) auto-PBSC mobilization was done in our center. However, adequate stem cell dose was not reached in 30 patients (10.5 %, F/M: 14/16). Median age was 44 years (range, 16-66). Their diagnoses were 18 lymphoma (NHL:11; HL:7) and 12 myeloma. Data were retrospectively collected from Apheresis Unit's database. Results: In 23 out of 30 patients a second mobilization regimen was used for auto-PBSC collection. We evaluated these poor mobilizing patients in two groups according the success after subsequent mobilizing (Table-1 ). Group I: In 16 patients (53.3 %) adequate CD34+ cell dose was reached after the use of a second mobilization regimen Group II: In 7 patients (23.3%) we failed to collect the minimum number of CD34+ cells. We also analyzed the patients in the group I into three different subgroups as follows: Group Ia (n=8): First mobilization regimen was unsuccessful for the collection, but adequate CD34+ cells was obtained after a second mobilization regimen; Group Ib (n=5): First mobilization regimen has reached the target CD34+ cell dose, but a second mobilization regimen was used due to additional requirement of higher CD34+ cells, but adequate CD34+ cell was not obtained. In this group a second mobilization regimen was tried in 3 patients after high dose therapy. Group Ic (n=3): The target CD34+ cell dose was achieved in total after subsequent attempts of mobilizations. Conclusion: In over 90 % of our myeloma and lymphoma patient cohort our hemapheresis center was able to collect adequate CD34+ cells after first mobilization attempt. Secondary mobilization attempts could reach the required target number of CD34+ cells in only about half of the patients failing first mobilization. In the light of existing data an experienced hemapheresis center is able to collect sufficient autologous stem cells in the majority of the patients including poor mobilizers.",

            "text": "Chimerism after multi-donor SCT: principles and paradigms for a quantitative analytic approach D. Kristt (1) Multi-donor (MD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is increasingly used to expedite engraftment and improve outcome of SCT. Although chimerism (Chm) testing is essential for following engraftment status, MD transplantation (MDT) may result in complete allelic sharing that precludes using standard methods for quantitative monitoring. Consequently, the goals of this project were to: (1) analyze theoretical MD Chm models for the relationship of alleles to their components; (2) formulate principles for quantitative MD Chm testing, using STR-PCR, based on the theoretical analysis; (3) develop a practical approach for routine monitoring of MD Chm. The project's results are represented by the following paradigm: STAGE 1. Identifying the chimeric components: When using the typical three or four peaked chimeric locus as a model, the relative \"quantity\" of DNA in each of the alleles allows distinguishing the following chimeric configurations: D1 (Donor #1), D1+D2, D2, R (Recipient), R+D1, R+D2. We posit that the quantity of DNA in a shared allele will be a multiple of a non-shared allele. This permits numerically identifying the \"absence\" of an expected signal representing D1, D2 and/or R. Therefore, Stage 1 data also are a basis to establish 0% or 100% Chm. STAGE 2. Defining a MD-informative locus: We found that the following criteria are required to utilize a locus for quantitation: (1) a configuration whereby D1 and/or D2 have an allele not present in R prior to SCT; (2) D1 and D2 may share this allele. STAGE 3. Computing % Mixed Chm: We extended the usual locus D:R ratio statement to MD SCT as follows: %Donor Chm = Sum-DNA MD / Sum-DNA (R+MD); where MD=D1+D2. Due to allelic sharing, the DNA measurements need \"validation\" that can be achieved using an expression for optimum performance: [R-1+ (D1-1) + (D2-1)] = [R-2 + (D1-2) + (D2-2)] (Leukemia 2006; 20, 1169) . The algorithm's 3stages are required for \"inter-current\" MDTs. The stages also are individually useful for analyzing aspects of serial singledonor, and in-utero SCTs. In conclusion, this work represents the first algorithmic quantitative approach for assessing MD chimerisms. The stages of the paradigm can be used in concert, or independently, to accommodate a range of MD situations. Using this algorithm, it becomes possible to routinely track the progressive changes in Chm status after a MDT. Assessing the latter is the main justification for performing \"quantitative\" Chm monitoring. In our facility more than 600 unrelated blood stem cell donor searches (UDS) are performed annually. The average searching time is approximately 70 days. However, this strongly varies depending on the patient's HLA phenotype frequency. We have developed an algorithm, based on the HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies as well as on the DRB1-DQB1 linkage disequilibrium, which allows an estimation of the search complexity and determines the number of donors to be requested for confirmatory typing (CT). We hypothesized that our algorithm would correlate with the UDS duration as well as with the number of HLA-identical donors found. HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies were calculated based on a dataset of 65752 individuals published by the National Marrow Donor Program. HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotype frequencies were retrieved from different literature sources. Information on HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies within two-digit defined allele groups are of importance, since in most cases only a low resolution typing of donors is available at the time of UDS initiation. HLA-DRB1 alleles with a frequency of >80%, 20-79% and <20% within their allele group were considered as very frequent, frequent and rare, respectively. In addition, an association between a particular HLA-DRB1 allele and a certain DQB1 allele of >80%, 20-79% and <20% was considered as very frequent, frequent and rare, respectively. The rarest allele or haplotype assignment defined the probability of finding a fully compatible donor. For the patients with high, medium or low probability, 2-3, 4 or 5-6 potentially matched unrelated donors were requested for CT at the initiation of the UDS, respectively. In a group of 128 patients, the UDS duration and the average number of identified donors was calculated. The average UDS duration was 29, 52 and 146 days in the groups with high, medium and low probability, respectively. In average 2,8 donors were found in the group with high, 1,8 donors in the group with medium and 0,8 donors in the group with low probability. An HLA-DRB1-DQB1-identical donor was found for 100%, 81% and 42% of patients with high, medium or low probability, respectively. Established algorithm shows a significant correlation between UDS duration and search success rate and can be used for the prediction of these search characteristics. A more precise differentiation of the number of donors, to be requested for CT, should allow further reduction of expenses in the UDS process without prolongation of the UDS duration.",

Platzbecker, S. Zapf, C. Theuser, A. Schmidt, C. Rutt, G. Ehninger, M. Bornh\u00e4user University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus (Dresden, D) Objectives: Hematopoietic progenitor cells from unrelated donors are increasingly used for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). A second donation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow is widely accepted in case of graft failure of relapse. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcome of seventy (n=70) patients with hematological malignancies (AML/MDS n=29, CML n=19, ALL n=17, other n=5) receiving a second SCT using PBSC (n=67) or bone marrow (n=3) from the same unrelated donors. Patients had a median age of 30 years (range 1-59) and the reason for a second donation of stem cells consisted of either relapse (n=37) or graft failure (n=33). Whereas in 21 patients no conditioning was used in the remaining patients it was busulfan or TBI-based in the majority of cases. Results: After a median follow-up of 33 months (range 7.9-76.2) after 2nd SCT a total of 55 patients died due to treatment-related mortality (63%) or relapse (16%) resulting in a median overall survival (OS) for all patients of 3 months. The OS was significantly better in patients < 50 years (38 vs. 8 %, p=0.01) and in case of graft failure (37% vs. 7%, p=0.02). Time interval between SCT, HLA-disparity, disease type (AML/MDS vs. CML vs. ALL), infused CD34+ cells/kg or graft source at first transplant had no impact. Conclusion: These data show the lack of efficacy of a second infusion of HSC from the same donor especially in older patients and in cases in which relapse of malignancy is the reason for second transplant. Given the currently unknown long-term effects of a repeated exposure to G-CSF, the factors mentioned above should be kept in mind whenever a request for a second HSC donation is considered.",

Karas University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Backround: RIC allograft allows the SCT even in the elderly. However their siblings are naturally older and the question is whether younger age of unrelated donors could compensate for the higher immune incompatibility. The superiority of younger donor age was shown in the setting of conventional HSCT; however for the RIC the data are limited. Method and Patients: Retrospective analysis of group of 62 consecutive patients 55 years of age (median 60 years, range 55-68) allografted either with related (SIB group, n=32, median age 60;55-68) or unrelated, 9-10/10 HLA allele-level matched donors (MUD group, n=30, median age 60;55-68). Groups were well balanced for disease characteristics. SIB has more CMV matched pairs (90vs 60%, p=0.007), more female donors (53 vs. 23%,p=0.02) and longer follow-up (33 mts; 5-56 vs. 16 mts; 5-40, p=0,03). As expected, the MUD received significantly more CD 34+ (6.1 vs. 4.3 10 6 /kg, p<0.0001) and T-cells (2.8 vs.2.6x10 8 /kg, p<0.001). Results: For all pts (median follow-up of 20 mts, 5-56), the 3year Kaplan-Meier OS and EFS probabilities were 32% and 29%, whereas overall NRM 39% (24/62) and relapse rate 45% (19/48). After splitting to SIB vs. MUD the figures were as follows: number of surviving pts 11/32 (34%) vs. 15/30 (50%) resulting in 3y OS probabilities for SIB and MUD of 29% and 42% (p=0,85) whereas the corresponding figures for EFS were 22% and 34% (p=0,42). The relapse rates were significantly higher in the SIB -54% vs. 23%, p=0,009; on the contrary there was a nonsignificant trend for lower 100-day and 1-year NRM in the SIB (19% vs.27%, p=0,55 and 34% vs.43%, p=0,61). Rejections (altogether 8/54 of evaluable pts), occurred more frequently in the SIB (20% vs. 8% in MUD), again statistically nonsignificant (p=0,28).The incidences of gr. II-IV aGVHD and cGVHD were also similar (SIBxMUD: 25% vs. 37%,p=0,41 and 50% vs. 59%, p=0,57). Conclusions: Our results clearly indicate that unrelated donors did not adversely affect RIC-SCT outcome in the patients aged 55. We even observed trend for better outcome for MUD, probably due to the better disease control. The intriguing question whether a younger allele-matched unrelated donor is superior to an older HLA-identical sibling donor is thus arising and should be tested in larger patient's cohort. If confirmed, we should not be reluctant with MUD in older pts and the priority of sibling donor would be challenged when younger MUD will be available.",

Guenther (1) Filgrastim is not only known to mobilize CD34+ progenitor cells but acts also as a pleiotropic immune modulator. We started to conduct the systematic donor follow-up in March 2004 after Filgrastim mob. in healthy donors. The follow-up focused on lab testing incl. lymphocyte subsets and the reports of adverse events i.e. infectious episodes or other symptoms. Mat. and meth.: 233 consecutive PBSC donors were tested at different time points (1, 3, 6 mths) after stem cell collection. Lab. testing included blood count and diff. count, lymphocyte subsets (CD3, 4, 8, 19, 16/56) , LDH, Crea, aP, GPT, Uric acid. All donors received questionnaires. In case of adverse events donors were contacted. Results: Overall 82% of donors responded at any time point. Blood count: after 1 mth 88% of samples were normal; 9 donors had leukopenia (min 2.7 G), 2 thrombopenia and 7 low Hb. The diff. count showed neutropenia (6 donors), eosinophilia or lymphocytosis. Lymph. subsets were abnormal in 36%, predominantly affecting NK-and B-cells. Lab. findings were abnormal in 32% incl. elevated uric acid (13 donors), Crea. (14 donors), GPT, GOT and LDH. These changes were demonstrable up to six mths in some donors tested or appeared de novo after mths. We did not expect long-lasting effects on leukocyte counts or lymph. subsets and renal parameters changes. The significance of these findings is not clear. The donors reported some infectious episodes following stem cell mobilization (n=5: bronchitis, atypical pneumonia, herpes, influenza-like affection), some allergic episodes (exanthema, newly aquired allergic reaction to apitoxin) and autoimmune-like symptoms (n=8) as tendovaginitis, fibromyalgia, arthralgia, new onset of thyreoiditis. We could not establish a correlation between abnormal lab. testing and the onset of adverse events due to the lack of samples tested at that time point. Conclusion: We demonstrated that some of the healthy donors show long-lasting alterations of the blood count, differential count and lymphocyte subsets and renal parameters after Filgrastim mobilization for peripheral blood stem cell collection. The significance, if any, remains to be clarified. The reports of adverse events including infectious episodes and signs of autoimmune disorder should be analyzed carefully. The data support the need for a systematic donor follow-up. Data should be exchanged between Donor centres and evaluated in order to define possible side-effects in the long-term follow-up.",

Mob. had to be discontinued and stem cell collection could\u00b4nt be performed. Physical examination of the 38 yrs old male donor did not show any pathological findings with normal functions of heart, liver, kidney and lung (incl. chest-x-ray), no allergic asthma nor pulmonary disease but smoker. He received the standard dose of Filgrastim of 11 mg/kg (split in two doses) for 4 days. On day 3 of mob. the donor developed massive hemoptysis and cough, but no dyspnea or fever. He contacted the DC\u00b4s physician on duty. The chest x-ray performed in an emergency ambulance showed diffuse infiltrates in the middle and lower parts of the lung.The next day (day 4 of mob.) the donor had to be admitted to hospital with continuing hemoptysis, dyspnea and hypoxemia (O2 < 55 mmHg). Filgrastim was discontinued immediately. The donor received oxygen and clarithomycin as an underlying infection could not be ruled out. He gradually improved and could be discharged 4 days later with only very mild hemoptysis and a normalized blood gas status. The pulmonary CT-scan showed diffuse opaque infiltrates with accentuation of the lower parts. The broncho-alveolar lavage demonstrated diffuse hemorrhage. The histological analysis was normal. The donor had no excessive leukocytosis (44 G/l) or other abnormal lab. findings at the onset of lung toxicity. The donor recovered completely as shown in the control examination performed two mths later. Fortunately an alternative fully matched unrelated donor could be identified within 24 hrs in our registry. The bone marrow was performed one day after the scheduled PBSC collection. The patient, who was fully conditioned, did receive a stem cell graft in time and recovered. Conclusion: It is recommended to monitor PBSC donors closely with respect to pulmonary symptoms and other complications during Filgrastim mob. as not only pat. with malignant diseases and concomitant chemotherapy may experience ARDS-like toxicity but also healthy donors. Donors with pulmonary symptoms should be admitted to hospital immediately.This report demonstrates the necessity of a 24h on duty physician (donor centre) who is experienced in PBSC mobilization and cytokine side-effects. This is the first report of hemoptysis during Filgrastim mobilization in a healthy donor. Fortunately the donor recovered but had to be hospitalized for some days. Aim: To analyse factors influencing the total CD34+ cells contained in the allograft product after G-CSF-mediated mobilization in healthy donor. Method: A retrospective analyze was performed on 535 healthy donors mobilized with 10 mucrog/kg/d in 25 French centres from 2001 to 2005. The studied factors were: age, sex and donor weight, recipient weight, number of daily G-CSF administrations, day of first aphaeresis, number of aphaeresis, circulating CD34+ cell rate before donation and number of treated blood mass. Results: In multivariate analysis, as expected, the most important factor correlated to CD34+ cells contained in the final product, is circulating CD34+ cells before the first donation (p<0.0001). Moreover male donor (p=0.0003), donor weight (p=0.005), two daily G-CSF injection (p=0.03), number of treated blood mass (p=0.02) were associated with high CD34+ cells contained in the allograft product. Factors influencing the CD34+ cell circulating rate before the first donation were two daily injections of GCSF (p=0.0007), donor age (p=0.04), and first aphaeresis performed at d5 (p=0.0003). On a pragmatic level, table 1 resume different strategic procedures. Conclusion: Two daily injection of 5 mucrog/kg of G-CSF and first aphaeresis performed at J5 seems to be the best strategy to obtain the CD34+ cell count required for an allogeneic HSC graft containing at least 4, 6 or 8X10 6 CD34+ cells. Randomized study must be performed to confirm these findings. ",

Our group has shown that for most of our patients the search time span, not the number of donors available, is the major influencing factor determining the chance of reaching transplantation for the majority of patients. Search facilitating tools such as the match programs of Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide and the European Marrow Donors Information System make an efficient and fast unrelated donor search possible. The Europdonor Transplant Centre Coordination Unit has been offering prospective search prognosis (PSP) for patients that are not in direct need of transplantation (e.g. patients that receive treatment such as Gleevec, ATG etc.) but may need a transplantation in future. If the likelihood of finding an acceptable unrelated donor is poor, the transplant centre (TC) might consider to start an unrelated donors search (UDS) instead of awaiting the outcome of initial treatment. The objective of this study was to validate the prognostic value of PSP. A group of 108 patients were enrolled in the PSP study. Five patients were excluded due to preliminary death. All patients were typed for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 on high resolution DNA. HLA haplotypes were confirmed where possible. The likelihood of finding a donor was determined based on the available donors and cord blood units in BMDW and the chances that available donors are allele matched with the patient and matched for additional loci such as HLA-C and -DQB1. In order to do this we used published data on frequency of alleles in a given population and linkage disequilibrium between the different loci. In 53% of all cases, a 10/10 match was predicted; for 96% this prediction was correct. In 29% of all cases, a 9/10 match was predicted as best donor; this was correct for 54%. However, for 34% a 10/10 match was identified. A poor prognosis was predicted for 18 % of all patients; for these patients a 9/10 match was found in 27%, no donor in 33% and 40% resulted in a suitable cord blood unit. These results show that PSP can point out for which patient a 10/10 match is likely to be found, but that the PSP underestimates the chance of finding acceptable donors (10/10 or 9/10). PSP is a practical tool to enhance the efficiency in UDS but still needs some adjustments. It can help TC's decide on several choices namely: cord blood or stem cell donor, start urgently or wait for the results of alternative therapy, and which planning.",

We have investigated whether this remains the case when all patients (pts) receive fludarabine (Flu)/busulphan (Bu) based conditioning (FLUBUP) with Thymoglobulin (TG) included in the graftversus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We treated 350 pts between 05/99 and 05/05 with Flu 50mg/m\u00b2 x 5, intravenous Bu (Busulfex, PDL Pharma) 3.2 mg/kg daily x 4 \u00b1 total body irradiation (TBI) 200cGy x 2. Prophylaxis for GVHD was cyclosporine A, methotrexate and TG (Genzyme) 4.5 mg/kg total dose. Patients were divided into four groups depending on donor -205 MRD, 22 genotypically mismatched family members (MMRD), 83 unrelated donors (UD) matched for HLA-A, -B, C, DR & DQ (MUD) and 40 UD mismatched by 1-3 alleles/antigens (MMUD). The proportion of LR pts (acute leukemia CR1/2, CML CP1) was 42%, 55%, 58% and 33% in the 4 groups respectively. Median age was 44 years (range 18-63). Five-year survival (OS) estimates for LR, high-risk and combined groups were MRD 80%, 47%, 60%, MMRD 74%, 40%, 58%, MUD 75%, 39%, 57%, MMUD 53%, 37%, 38% rspectively. By Cox regression analysis MRD, MMRD and MUD SCT had similar outcomes and were combined for a more robust analysis. The hazard ratio for OS for MMUD vs all others was 2.03 (95% CI 1.31-3.16, p = 0.002). This was largely accounted for by a difference in OS of LR pts at 53% for MMUD vs 77% for the other 3 groups (p = 0.03). After adjusting for gender, risk group, patient age (continuous), donor age (continuous), TBI, stem cell source, female donor to male recipient, CMV status and CD34+ cell dose (continuous) the hazard ratio was 1.69 (1.04-2.74) (p = 0.03). The cumulative incidence of relapse mortality was similar across all 4 groups, the difference in outcome was mostly due to transplant-related mortality (TRM). The cumulative incidence of TRM at 3 years was 31.6% (17.5%-46.7%) for MMUD vs 14.5% (10.8%-18.8%) for all others. We conclude that the FLUBUP protocol \u00b1 TBI with TG gives comparable OS for recipients of SCT from all donors apart from MMUD. As with other myeloablative protocols differences between donors are more apparent in LR pts. Patients with LR disease should be advised of the increased risk of SCT when the latter donors are the only ones available. Of the 24 patients who were retransplanted a different donor was used in 6 patients including 2 patients who had three allogeneic transplants. 24 patients had a second stem cell donation within 8 months (1.5 -48) median time period post transplant. 91 patients required 368 DLI infusions over a period of 5 years with median time to first infusion being 7(3-52) months. 2 second donation requests were declined and one was delayed due to donor unavailability.107/220(48.6%)of patients receiving nonmyeloablative allografts required second donation compared to 8/58(13.7%) myeloablative HSCT. Our data demonstrates that upto half the patients receiving a non myeloablative HSCT would be likely to need a second donation.In donor counselling sessions, practicality of second donation is discussed briefly, but we do not provide donors with data such as time to second donation and its frequency. We realise,due to heterogeneity in conditioning protocols,nature of disease and status at time of transplant it is difficult to inform donors about the prospect of second donation. We propose that bone marrow registries should prospectively collect data on second donation requests made by individual transplant centres and reliably inform future practice.",

The average volume upon reception was 95 \u00b1 37 mL, with 87.5 \u00b1 47 x107 CD45+ cells and 3.2 \u00b1 5.1 x106 CD34+ cells; thus 30/50 CB met the minimal volume (80mL) required to qualify unrelated CB collection by the French Cord Blood Bank Network (R\u00e9seau Fran\u00e7ais du Sang Placentaire, RFSP, FranceCord) and 22/50 met the minimal progenitor cell content (>2x106 CD34+ cells). In many cases, part or all of the virological testing necessary to secure safety was missing, as well as the demonstration of geno-identity or lack of genoidentity between the affected patient and the neonate. Finally -since February 1997 -two affected children in this cohort were transplanted, one with the CB collected at birth from his geno-identical sibling, the second one with a bone marrow collection from a sibling whose CB was cryopreserved. We conclude that related CB collection can be organized, in case that the mother of an affected child is pregnant again, even when the birth clinic is not routinely engaged in CB collection. The use of related CB for allogeneic transplantation of siblings affected with constitutional or acquired disorders will benefit from a better definition of national and international rules for validation, determination of HLA-compatibility and clinical decisions. Allo-reactivity of natural killer (NK) cells has been observed after haplo-mismatch hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with killer cell immunoglobuline-like receptor (KIR)ligand mismatch in Graft-versus-Host (GvH) direction. The occurrence of allo-reactive NK cells is correlated with a favorable influence on relapse rates, engraftment and incidence of GvH disease. We study prospectively the incidence and impact of allo-reactive NK cells after HLA A, B, DR and DQ-matched HSCT on a functional level. Patients (pts) receiving an allogeneic HSCT are consecutively registered and monitored repeatedly post HSCT. From 4/04 to 8/06 107 pts entered the study. History, chimerism (PCR), immune-reconstitution (FACS) and frequencies of functional active and allo-reactive NK cells (Granzyme B ELISpot) are analyzed in 22 pts so far. Pts suffered from AML (9), CML (3), ALL (2), NHL (6), MM (13q-) (1) and OMF (1) . 15 pts received myeloablative (8 x TBI/Cy, 7 x FBC12) and 7 pts received reduced conditioning regimen FB8. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of CsA or tacrolimus and short course MMF without T cell depletion in 21/22 pts. In 5/22 pts we detected alloreactive NK cells at d +128 (case #19), +56 (#8), +355 (#1), +364 (#22) and +379 (#13). 5/22 pts (#1, 13, 19, 8, 22) were transplanted with KIR-ligand mismatch in GvH direction. In two of these pts we detected allo-reactive NK cells at d +355 (#1) and +379 (#13) in PB. In three pts (#9, 12, 21) NK alloreactivity remained absent despite KIR-ligand mismatch. 17/22 pts were transplanted in KIR-ligand match. In 3 of these pts we detected allo-reactive NK cells in PB at d +56 (#8), +128 (#19), +364 (#22). In 14/17 pts transplanted in KIRligand match no allo-reactive NK cells occurred. In 3/22 pts (#4, 6, 12) NK cell activity was absent at all, correlated with acute GvHD and use of glucosteroids. All other cases showed at least once active NK cells in PB. After median observation time of 258 d, 2 pts died due to relapse (#3, 12), 12 pts died in CR due to infection (8) or GvHD (4). None of the pts with NK cell allo-reactivity experienced relapse. We observed previously unknown late occurrence of allo-reactive NK cells transplanted in KIR-ligand mismatch regardless of myeloablative or reduced conditioning. Some cases transplanted in KIR-ligand mismatch lacked allo-reactive NK cells after HSCT, which may explain heterogeneous results from retrospective studies investigating the influence of KIRligand mismatch in HSCT.",

Nucleated cells returned to 4.5 (median value) one year after donation. No particularities of blood counts were noted in the donors after one year. Under G-CSF, 39/49 (79%) reported bone pain, 6/49 (12%) persons reported fever and/ or flew like symptoms, 5/49 (10%) individuals had fatigue, 4/49 (8%) had a head ache. During apheresis, the most prominent side effect was citrate toxicity, (15/49, 30%), 16/49 donors (32%) had fatigue and 5/49 (10%) persons reported to have nausea. PBSC-donors underwent a health check 1, 7, 14 days and 1, 3, 6 months after harvest and then annually. In the framework of these checks, donors were interviewed about their health situation. This was used as the basis for detailed donor follow up. After PBSC donation, 4 donors reported to have joint pain and swelling of at least one joint. In addition, 6 donors reported to have had neurovegetative disturbances after donation. In 2 cases, this was accompanied by a neurological problem (1 tinnitus, 1 paraesthesia of the hand) and in one case with inflammation in two joints. Furthermore, a second case of tinnitus was noted. Beyond that, 6 donors reported to have had severe infections (1 tonsillitis, 2 pneumonias, 1 candida-infection, 2 cases of influenza). One donor had the excision of a polyp of the jejunum. One donor had a long lasting phase of neutropenia of 2 years following PBSC donation but has finally returned to normal. In conclusion, we now overlook the follow up of 49 PBSC donations with more than 6o donor years after harvest.

Now we present an update of the ongoing study and a comparison with a retrospective cohort of donors who received daily conventional Filgrastim (FIL) to mobilize allogeneic PBSC. Thirty-five donors (15 related, 20 unrelated, 23 male, 12 female, median age 40 years) were mobilised with PEGFIL. Donors received a single s.c. injection of 2 vials (12 mg) PEGFIL (Neulasta\u2122, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, USA) resulting in a median dose of 161 \u00b5g/kg body weight (range 126-203) on day 1. FIL (Neupogen\u2122, Amgen Inc.) was used for mobilization in 64 donors (2 related, 62 unrelated, 44 male, 20 female, median age 31 years) at a dose of 10 \u00b5g/kg on days 1 to 5. Monitoring included blood cell counts, number of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood (PB-CD34) and cytokine related side effects. Leukaphereses (LPH) started on day 5. PBSC were collected by large-volume LPH (4x blood volume) using Cobe Spectra 7.0 (Gambro BCT Inc.). In all donors sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells for allografting could be collected. PB-CD34+ count on day 5 was significantly higher after PEGFIL compared to FIL (72/\u00b5l vs. 53/\u00b5l, p=0.03). Whereas an LPH on day 6 had to be performed only in 6 donors (17%) after PEGFIL, a second procedure was needed in 56/64 (87%) donors who had received daily FIL. The harvest results of both cohorts are presented in the table. Although CD34+ yields on day 5 (LPH-1) were significantly higher after PEGFIL than after FIL the total numbers of collected stem cells were not different. The worse yields on day 6 (LPH-2) in the PEGFIL cohort correspond to the observation that PB-CD34+ cells were higher on day 4 than on day 6, which is in contrast to the kinetics of CD34+ mobilization with conventional G-CSFs. The incidence of bone pain and headache was similar in both cohorts. However, there were a significantly higher number of donors who received PEGFIL who characterized the symptoms as severe.",

Donors and methods: Parents of children undergoing haploidentical PBSCT or UCBT were asked to donate 50 cc of bone marrow 4-5 weeks prior to HSCT. Parents of children with non-steroid responsive aGvHD (grade III-IV) were asked at the time of treatment failure. Bone marrow was aspirated either under general or local anesthesia. Haplo-identical PBSC donors received in addition 5 days of G-CSF immediately before stem cell harvest. Donors could also consent for additional MSC's to be donated for research or use as 3rd party donations for other patients. Donors were cleared for donation by an independent physician. Results: Twenty-two (8 mothers, 14 fathers)of 23 parents asked, agreed to donate bone marrow for MSC expansion and all uses. Median age was 39 years (range 26-55). One parent whose child died before receiving MSC's requested their use as 3rd party donations. Thirty patients (included 4 adults) were treated with MSC's (10 haplo-identical PBSCT, 8 UCBT and 12 aGvHD). Only 19 patients (63%) received MSC's from a parent, the remaining treatments being 3rd party. All donors were considered suitable for PBSC or BM donation, although excess weight, mild hypertension and depression were documented in a minority of donors. No adverse events were documented after bone marrow donation, but one parent suffered severe bone pain requiring opiate analgesia, during G-CSF administration. At 6 weeks follow up no adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: MSC donation either alone or in combination with stem cell mobilization can be achieved without major problems. Parental donor commitment is definitely related to the needs of the child. However, donor altruism to include other unknown patients was in this study without limitation. It is therefore essential when introducing experimental treatments to establish a balance between donor's commitment and patient's needs.",

Two hundred stem cell transplant patients (pts) were treated between 05/99 and 07/05 with Flu 50mg/m\u00b2 daily x 5 and intravenous Bu (Busulfex, PDL Pharma) 3.2 mg/kg daily x 4.

Cell source from matched sibling donors was mobilised blood cells in 172 and marrow in 28. Median age was 46 (range 18-65) and follow-up of survivors was 13-87 months (median 42). For low-risk (LR, acute leukaemia CR1/CR2, CML CP1) pts projected 5 year TRM and overall survival (OS) was 4% and 76% for those 45 years old (n = 54) and 6% and 83% for those >45 (n = 31). For high-risk (HR) pts TRM was 6% vs 27% (18% at one year) (p = 0.04) and OS 64% vs 37% (p = 0.046) in younger (n = 40) and older (n = 75) pts respectively. To correct for imbalance in HR diagnoses we matched each of 17 younger HR (YHR) pts with 2 older HR (OHR) pts by diagnosis and details of stage and thereafter for other risk factors. For the YHR and OHR pts respectively OS was 70% vs 37% (p = 0.02), TRM 0 vs 34% (p = 0.02) and relapse 64% (48% at 3 years) vs 46% at 3 and 5 years (p = ns). For a more robust analysis of the whole data set OHR pts were compared with the other 3 groups combined giving TRM of 27% vs 5% respectively (p= 0.0003).

Nine of 14 non-relapse deaths in the OHR group were related to GVHD or its treatment compared with 3 of 6 in all others (p value for GHVD related death = 0.01). These data provide some support for our practice of using this regimen in all adults, regardless of age. The effect of age on TRM is only apparent in HR pts and is not explained by heterogeneity in diagnoses. High-risk older pts experience more GVHD and more GVHD related death than others but TRM is no higher than reported with many non-myeloablative regimens. It is possible that these pts might benefit from additional GVHD prophylaxis.",

Engraftment after both syngeneic (n=8) as well as autologous (n=67) was seen significantly earlier than after allogeneic (n=449) HSCT (day 9.63\u00b11.19 and 11.54\u00b11.65 vs. 16.04\u00b14.00; p<0.0001). The engraftment delay in autologous as compared to syngeneic HSCT is still significant (p<0,005) pointing to an influence of primary disease and/or previous chemotherapy cycles on the engraftment of autologous HSC.

            "text": "Background: Transplantation of G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood cells is the current standard practice in allogeneic transplantation. Alternative mobilization agents are available or under investigation. Different mobilization strategies may affect graft composition, i.e., the relative contribution of lymphocyte subsets and NK cells, and ultimately impact immune reconstitution and transplant outcome. Methods: From December 1994 to July 2006, a total of 566 donors have undergone peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and apheresis at the Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine. The database registered 604 individual cases of mobilization and apheresis; 529 mobilization records contained full data on subset cell collection on apheresis Day 1. Retrospective analysis of this large database allows the comparison of graft composition between various standard mobilization regimens, as well as an investigational agent, AMD3100. Results: The age of donors ranged from 1 month to 78 years, with a median age of 45.5 years; 57% were male. Donors were mobilized with G-CSF (55%), G-CSF/GM (29%), GM (7%), or AMD3100 (3%). Median CD34+/kg collected was 7.00 x 10E6; range 8.19E4 -2.02E8. Median absolute CD34 yield on apheresis Day 1 by mobilization regimen is shown in figure 1 . Mobilization regimen affects graft composition. Compared to G-CSF, GM-containing mobilization regimens have signficantly reduced levels of absolute CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-lymphocytes (2.2 v 1.36 x 1E10, 1.47 v 0.99 x 1E10, 5.4 v 2.55 x 1E9, resp.). In contrast, AMD3100 is associated with increased absolute levels of these subtypes (3.51, 2.4, and 9.49, resp.). Subset yields expressed as absolute subset cell/ absolute CD34 are summarized in Table 1 . While the ratio's appear similar between G-CSF and GM-regimen, AMD1300-mobilized grafts have higher ratio's of all subsets analysed.",

This large database will be further evaluated for pt outcome. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been exclusively used in normal donors to mobilize circulating stem cells. G-CSF is well tolerated by healthy donors. Severe side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment G-CSF are infrequent. We report a case of a 6-year old allogeneic PBSC donor observed to have rhabdomyolysis after G-CSF therapy. The donor received G-CSF (filgrastim, 10 \u00b5g/kg/day, 5 days, SQ) to mobilize PBSC. On the third and fourth days of filgrastim, the donor complained of slight bone pain; paracetamol was given at a 250 mg dose. One day later, donor suffered from bone pain, myalgia and vomiting. Laboratory analysis showed: CPK=1095 U/L (40-226), LDH= 312 U/L (100-190), AST= 85 U/L (0-40), uric acid= 8,5 mg/dL (2,6-8), Cr=0,5 mg/dL (0.6-1.3), BUN=10 mg/dL (6-20), K= 3,3 mmol/L (3,6-5,1), WBC= 39.800 /\u00b5L, Hb= 12,5 g/dL, Hct= 37,4% and platelet= 350.000 /\u00b5L. Urine examination showed a high myoglobin level (110 ng/mL). In this case, a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made with clinic and laboratory findings. Intravenous hydration, potassium replacement and alkalization of the urine by adding sodium bicarbonate were performed. Subsequently, donor's muscular signs and symptoms improved, and the laboratory examination results returned to normal after three days. Stem cells were harvested from peripheral blood on fifth day of G-CSF therapy. In conclusion, G-CSF and/or paracetamol may cause rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, serum CPK levels should be followed carefully in an allogeneic PBSC harvest setting, especially in donors with myalgia.",

            "text": "Background: relapse remains a significant problem in patients with acute leucemia undergoing an allogeneic HSCT. A marker of disease predicting hematologic relapse would be useful to monitor patients post-transplant. Aim of the study. To assess the role of WT1 expression in AML patients after allogeneic HSCT Methods: We studied 54 patients with AML who received an allogeneic HSCT between 2004 and 2006 in our Unit. WT1 mRNA levels of expression were normalized with respect to the number of Abl transcripts and expressed as WT1 copy numbers every 104 copies of ABL. Data obtained from the quantitative assessment of the WT1 transcript in 20 normal bone marrow controls showed values in the range between 3 and 180 WT1 copies /104 ABL. MRD was considered positive when WT1 copy numbers every 104 copies of ABL were greater to 180. Patients bone marrow cells were monitored for WT1 expression, and cytology, at day +30 and every month untile day +180. Escalating dose donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given , when possible, in MRD+ patients. Results: WT1 was found positive (>180) in 12 patients (22%) at a median interval from HSCT of 120 days (range 38-180) and always negative in 42 patients (78%). Hematologic relapse was seen in 8/12 MRD+ patients (66%) and 9/42 (21%) MRD-patients (p=0.005). Of the 12 MRD+ patients 4 received DLI (MRD+DLI+) on the basis of their WT1 expression: 1 relapsed, 3 remain in remission with a negative WT1 expression. GvHD developed in 2/4 patients receiving DLI. Of the 8 patients MRD+ who did not receive DLI (MRD+DLI-) 6 relapsed (p=0.1). There is a statistical difference in relapse for MRD-and MRD+DLI+ patients (n=46, 10 relapses) and MRD+DLI-patients (n=8, 6 relapses )(p=0.005). Relapse related death in these 2 groups of patients is 4/46 (10%) in MRD-or MRD+DLI+ and 3/6 (50%) in MRD+DLI-. Conclusions: This study suggests that WT1 expression can be used as a marker of MRD in patients with AML , following an allogeneic HSCT: relapse is significantly more frequent in MRD+ as compared to MRD-patients. In addition, infusion of donor lymphocytes in MRD+ patients may reduce their risk of relapse and of relapse related death. After T-cell depleted (TCD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) is a useful tool for early prediction of disease relapse because it allows the prompt intervention with preemptive immunotherapy strategies. A molecular marker for MRD study is available only for a small number of hematologic malignancies. Hematopoietic chimerism (HC) has been proposed as a surrogate marker for MRD. We have previously developed a semiquantitative method for HC analysis based on studying patient and donor-specific HLA alleles by PCR and reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotides (HLA method) which was shown to have a higher sensitivity (1%) and a higher predictive power for disease relapse than PCR-STR, the standard method for HC study (BMT 2006; 37,s1:Ab824) . Here, we report on an investigational study aimed at comparing study of HC by the HLA method with standard flow cytometry analysis of tumor-specific cell surface markers on a limited number of cells, for detection of MRD after allogeneic HSCT. We performed a monthly follow-up of 59 TCD-HSCT for high risk acute leukemia from alternative donor (43 haplo, 15 MUD, 1 UCB) for the state of HC and phenotype in bone marrow samples in parallel by HLA-method and by standard flow cytometry. The stage of disease at HSCT was complete remission (44.1%) or advanced disease (55.9%). The median follow-up with HC analysis and flow cytometry analysis was 139 days. Total number of relapses was 20 (18 hematologic, 1 cytogenetic, 1 molecular). 11/20 (55%) relapses were predicted by the HLA method only; 5/20 (25%) relapses were predicted by the HLA method and by standard flow cytometry; 4/20 relapses (20%) were not predicted. There were no relapses predicted by standard flow cytometry alone. In total, the HLA method predicted 16/20 relapses (80%), whereas standard flow cytometry predicted 5/20 (25%) relapses. The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 52 (21-261) and 36 (14-57) days, respectively, by the HLA method and standard flow cytometry. We conclude that HC analysis based on the study of mismatched HLA alleles after TCD-HSCT for high risk leukemia is a sensitive tool for early prediction of disease relapse. In particular, this assay has a higher sensitivity than standard flow cytometry. These data underline the usefulness of recently developed flow cytometry assays which allow MRD detection at higher levels of sensitivity. Efficacy of MM treatment is evaluated by morphological and immunochemical methods. Improvement of transplantation strategies and novel therapies result in a better treatment outcome. This gives rise to the need for sensitive methods to detect the minimal residual disease (MRD). Qualitative molecular monitoring using allele (patient)-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the immunoglobulin heave chain (IgH) is well established to detect clonotypic myeloma cells during and after therapy. The aim of study was monitoring of MRD in patients with MM after highdose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous PBSCT and thalidomide therapy. Materials and methods: 41 patients with untreated MM were included in the trial. Molecular marker (clonally rearranged V-D-J regions) was revealed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with family-specific primers (VHL, VHD). RNA was extracted from bone marrows samples. The patient-specific primers were generated after sequencing of amplified fragments. MRD was evaluated using nested-PCR on bone marrows DNA samples of MM patients. The first round of PCR was performed using family-specific primers, the second one -with patient-specific oligonucleotide. Method sensitivity equaled 10-3-10-4. Results: Clonal rearrangements of VH-genes were detected in 37 (90%) of 41 patients. More than half of patients with MM demonstrated VH3-family and about 25% of patients -VH1-family of IgH. Comparison of primary structures of VH-genes exhibiting clonal rearrangements and of germinal VH-genes revealed somatic mutations in 100% of cases (homology level ranged from 72,4 to 96%). Molecular monitoring of treatment efficacy was performed on 11 patients received HDT followed by autologous PBSCT. Partial remission was documented in 6 cases, complete remission (CR) -in 5 of 11 patients (45.4%). Three patients from those with CR showed molecular remission (MR) also. Overall follow-up period came to 12, 27 and 33 months in these patients and they still remain in MR. MRD persistence was observed in 2 patients, one of them developed MM relapse after 11 months following second transplantation, while another patient has been remaining in hematological remission for 20 months. Conclusion: Current study provides evidences for correlation of molecular status with clinical disease course. However, we suggest hopefully that the treatment approach in MM patients will depend on MRD detection results in the nearest future.",

            "text": "Introduction: Several techniques are available for detecting mixed chimerism after bone marrow transplantation (BMT); one example is STR-PCR. However, this technique requires DNA sample from both donor and recipient before BMT for interpretation of the result. One approach to this is the sex identification of both male and female cells in the cell mixtures of patients after the sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation. In humans, the amelogenin gene is present on both the X and the Y chromosomes. However, there are size differences in this gene between these chromosomes, which have been utilized for sexing in forensic casework and prenatal identification. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the application of the amelogenin gene for assessment of chimerism in PBL and/or BM samples of patients who had received sex-mismatched BMT. Methods: PCR techniques using a set of amelogenin primer alone or in combination with STR primers were first preformed on whole WBC and/or BMA samples, and in some cases on isolated T-cell and granulocytes subsets of 30 recipient patients. Then, between September 2000 and April 2006, more than 1400 samples from 300 BMT patients suffering from different types of leukemia and non-malignant hematologic were evaluated for detection of chimerism after the transplantation. Result: About 51% of patients were received sex-mismatched BMT. In 98% of cases, amelogenin marker in combination with STR markers has been used without a single falsepositive or negative results, as confirmed by clinical outcome. In 5% of the cases, when there was no pre-BMT sample from either donor or recipient, the applicability of this assay has become of crucial important to our treating physicians. Conclusion: The application of amelogenin marker alone or in combination with STR system can be used for relative quantitative analysis of mixed chimerism and for observing kinetics of engraftment in patients who have sex-mismatched BMT. Comparison of values obtained with amelogenin PCR analysis showed an excellent correlation with the STR-PCR results. Introduction: The outcome of B-cell lymphoma has definitely improved since the introduction of the anti-CD20 Rituximab, which can be effectively combined into conventional chemotherapy regimens. Rituximab can also be added to high-dose chemotherapy programs with autograft. However, the clinical benefit of combining Rituximab and autograftbased programs has not been proved yet. This issue is addressed in the present study. Patients and Methods: Data were collected from 957 B-cell lymphoma patients undergoing a high-dose sequential (HDS) chemotherapy program, at 10 Italian Centers associated to GITIL (Gruppo Italiano Terapie Innovative nei Linfomi). Although the HDS schedule has been introduced almost 20 yrs. ago, most patients were treated in the last decade. They received either the original HDS scheme or the hd-Ara-Csupplemented scheme developed for mantle-cell and diffuse large cell lymphoma; overall, Rituximab was added to HDS (R+) in 483 patients, the remaining 474 received Rituximabfree HDS (R-). All patients entered the HDS-protocols due to high-risk prognostic features, their median age was 49 yrs. (range 17-70); 403 patients (232 R+) had low-grade and 554 (251 R+) had intermediate/high grade B-cell lymphoma; HDS was delivered to 542 (259 R+) patients at diagnosis and to 415 (224 R+) at first or subsequent disease recurrence. Results: at a median follow-up of 5 yrs., the 5-yr Overall Survival (OS) and Event-free Survival (EFS) projections were 66% and 55%, respectively, with a significantly better outcome for patients treated at diagnosis (5-yr OS: 72%, EFS: 61%) compared to patients at relapse (5-yr OS: 56%, EFS: 45%). As shown in Table 1 , Rituximab addition was associated with significant improvements; in particular, a significant improvement was observed for the EFS projection both in patients at diagnosis and at disease recurrence; moreover, the benefit of Rituximab was clear both in low-grade (5-yr EFS: 65% for R+ vs. 41% for R-) and intermediate/high-grade subtypes (5-yr EFS: 64% for R+ vs. 52% for R-). In the Cox multivariate analysis, Rituximab addition confirmed its significant impact on the EFS. Conclusions: the addition of Rituximab to high-dose programs with autograft may improve response and long-term outcome in high-risk B-cell lymphoma patients.",

Tarella (1) (1) Introduction: The outcome of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLB-CL) patients has definitely improved since the introduction of the anti-CD20 Rituximab, which can be effectively combined into conventional chemotherapy regimens Indeed, Rituximab-supplemented CHOP is now considered the most effective treatment option for DLB-CL. However, despite the inclusion of Rituximab, there is still a marked difference in the outcome between patients with adverse IPI prognostic factors and those without. Rituximabsupplemented intensive programs with autograft might represent an effective alternative to R-CHOP in DLB-CL patients with unfavorable clinical presentation. Aim of the study: To perform a multicenter, prospective study evaluating applicability and efficacy of the combination of Rituximab and high-dose (hd) sequential chemotherapy delivered with multiple autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) support (R-HDS-maps regimen) in previouslyuntreated patients with DLB-CL and scores 2-3 of the ageadjusted IPI (aaIPI) prognostic classification. Treatment schedule. R-HDS-maps includes: i. 3 APO courses; ii. sequential administration of hd-cyclophosphamide (CY), hd-Ara-C, both supplemented with Rituximab, hdetoposide/Cisplatin, with PBPC harvests following hd-CY and hd-Ara-C; iii. hd-Mitoxantrone + L-Pam + 2 further Rituximab doses; iv. involved-field radiotherapy. PBPC rescue was scheduled following Ara-C, etoposide/Cisplatin and Mitoxantrone/L-Pam. Results: Six hematological Centers affiliated to GITIL (Gruppo Italiano Terapie Innovative nei Linfomi) participated to the prospective trial. Between 1999 and 2004, 112 consecutive patients (74 score 2, 38 score 3) entered the study protocol and received the R-HDS-maps regimen. There were 5 early and 2 late toxic deaths. Overall 90 patients (80%) reached CR and, at a median follow-up of 48 mos., 87 (78%) patients are alive, 82 (73%) in continuous CR, with 4-yr overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) projections of 76% (C.I. 68-85%) and 73% (C.I. 64-81%), respectively. Conclusion: The results of the prospective trial show that R-HDS-maps is feasible at the multicenter level, with acceptable toxicity, and leads to prolonged survival in a high proportion of patients. These observations give further support to the use of early-intensified chemotherapy regimens, possibly supplemented with Rituximab, in younger patients with highrisk DLB-CL. Introduction: Several observations stressed the importance of achieving an adequate tumor shrinking as a preliminary step prior to high-dose therapy and autograft. This concept was considered while designing the high-dose sequential (HDS) S145 chemotherapy program (Gianni & Bonadonna, 1989) . Indeed, the HDS approach is characterized by the combination of an early dose-intensification followed by a conclusive phase with high-dose therapy and autograft with peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). The HDS program has been extensively used in the management of both non-Hodgkin s (NHL) and Hodgkin s Lymphoma (HL). The outcome of a large series of lymphoma patients treated with the HDS approach at 10 Centers associated to GITIL is here reported. Patients and methods: Data were collected on 1,266 patients, who received either the original or slightly modified HDS regimen. There were 213 HL and 1,053 NHL patients (630 aggressive, 423 low-grade); median age was 46 yrs, 57% were male. Overall, 671 (53%) patients received HDS as salvage treatment whereas 595 (47%) had HDS front-line. Most patients were autografted with PBPC, few received BM cells (alone or with PBPC); 158 (12%) patients did not undergo autograft, due to toxicity, disease progression, or poor harvests. Results: Overall, 1,013 (80%) patients reached Complete Remission (CR) following HDS program. Up to now, 93 (7%) patients died for early/late toxicities, 328 (26%) died for lymphoma, 844 are known to be alive; at a median follow-up of 5 yrs, the 5-yr Overall Survival (OS) projection is 64%. As shown in Table 1 , a markedly higher survival was observed in patients achieving CR vs. those not in CR, including Partial Remission, Stable or Progressive disease. On multivariate Cox analysis, both status at HDS (diagnosis vs relapse) and post-HDS response (CR vs. no CR) maintained a significant impact on the 5-yr OS. Conclusions: i. the long-term outcome of lymphoma patients receiving the HDS program is definitely good in patients achieving CR; ii. given their poor outcome, early salvage treatment options, including allogeneic transplant, should be considered for those patients unable to reach CR following a HDS treatment approach.",

            "text": "High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (aSCT) have an established therapeutic role in patients (pts) with chemosensitive relapse of aggressive lymphoma. However, aSCT has only limited success when performed in refractory or progressive stage of the disease. The expected long-term progression-free survival (PFS) in this setting is less than 20%. This study was designed to explore the safety and outcome following inclusion of Zevalin in the conditioning regimen given prior to aSCT in pts with refractory lymphoma. The study included 23 pts, median age 55 years (range, 35-66). Histology was diffuse large cell (n=15), transformed low grade (n=7) and mantle cell lymphoma (n=1). Disease status was primary refractory (n=11) or refractory relapse (n=12), and 14 pts had bulky disease at aSCT. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range, 1-6). Rituximab 250 mg/m\u00b2 followed by Zevalin 0.4 mCi/kg were given on day -14 and high-dose BEAM chemotherapy started on day -6. All pts engrafted, a median of 10 days after aSCT (9-22). Zevalin had no impact on engraftment kinetics. Twenty-one pts are evaluable for response; 11 achieved CR, 9 achieved PR, 5 of whom converted to CR with additional radiation therapy to residual disease (overall 16/21 achieved CR), 1 pt did not respond. With a median follow-up of 17 months (range, 6-27), 16 pts are alive. The estimated 2-year overall and progression-free survival were 67% (95% CI, 46-87%) and 52% (95% CI, 31-72%). Seven pts relapsed or did not respond, all within 6 months of aSCT. The 2-year cumulative relapse incidence is 31% (95% CI, 17-57%). There were no early infusion reactions associated with Zevalin. Two pts died of multi-organ toxicities early after aSCT. One died from an infection and one of bronchiolitis obliterans, 4 and 5 months after SCT, respectively. The day100 rate of nonrelapse mortality is 9%. This rate can be expected in such heavily pretreated pts and there was no additional toxicity related to Zevalin. In conclusion, inclusion of Zevalin in the conditioning regimen prior to aSCT is relatively safe and may improve outcome in pts with refractory lymphoma. Although excess non-relapse mortality can not be ruled out, relapse rate was low resulting in improved PFS. Zevalin in combination with aSCT merits further study in larger scale randomized studies and standard risk pts with chemosensitive disease may also benefit from this combination. We present feasibility and toxicity results of a phase I/II study of HD-Zevalin with PBSC support in resistant-refractory NHL pts. From 04/04 to 11/06, 20 pts were enrolled. Median age was 66.5ys (21-75). 17/20 pts had advanced stage disease (III/IV) at diagnosis. 12 had DLBCL, 4 MCL, 2 FL, 1 transformed FL and 1 transformed MZL. Median number of prior therapies was 3 (1-6), including Rituximab, RT and HD-CT. Three Zevalin activity levels were fixed: 30, 45, 56 MBq/kg; 4 pts at the first, 4 at the second and 12 at the third level. One week before treatment all patients underwent dosimetry with Indium-111 (111In) ibritumomab-tiuxetan in order to assess organ doses and plan the activity level. ASC were reinfused 13 day after Zevalin. On d28 from reinfusion engraftment was considered to be delayed if ANC<1.0x109/L or PLT<20.0x109/L. Results: Dosimetry showed acceptable radiation-absorbed doses to normal organs in all cases. Median adsorbed doses (mGy/MBq): 0.8\u00b10.2 (RM), 3.0\u00b11.7 (heart wall), 1.7\u00b10.8 (lungs), 3.9\u00b12.3 (liver), 2.5\u00b11.6 (spleen), 2.2\u00b11.1 (kidneys), 3.0\u00b11.0 (testes), 0.6\u00b10.1 (total-body). Only 1 pt received 30Gy to the liver, without developing toxicity. Median activity of 90Y-Zevalin delivered: 3.5 GBq, range 2.1 -5. 55 GBq; 10 pts received more than 3,7 GBq. All patients engrafted promptly after ASC transplantation. PLT and ANC-count nadirs were reached 8 and 4 days after transplantation, with median values of 11x109/L PLT (4-35) and 0.01x109/L ANC (0.01-1.09). The time of nadir did not change as a function of 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan dose. Median time to engraftment was 12 (0-22) and 19 (1-48) for PLT and ANC respectively. One transient acute G3 liver toxicity was observed at the 3rd level and 1 pt died 4 months after treatment due to HCV reactivation. 18/20 pts are evaluable for response: 7CR, 4PR, 1SD, 6PD. Conclusion: Zevalin at myeloablative activity is feasible with PBSC support and it could be safely delivered also in elderly pts. We suggest dosimetry in order to avoid unpredictable toxicity and an activity of 45 MBq/kg in heavily pretreated pts. Clinical efficacy and mild treatment-related toxicities suggest HD-Zevalin is an interesting modality treatment to be further investigated as an alternative therapeutic option in ABMT setting. We are continuing our experience in order to verify initial results.",

Eligibility was based on age-adjusted IPI 2 (125 pts) or according to the Italian Lymphoma Intergroup score 3 (11 pts). 136 pts were stratified according to histology (grade I or II 101, grade III 35) and randomized (68 each). Clinical features were: median age 50 yrs. (22-60), stage III-IV 98%, elevated LDH 78%, bulky disease 66%, B symptoms 47%, extranodal disease (other than BM) 45%, ECOG PS >1 47%. R-HDS has been already described (Ladetto et al ASH 2005) . The CHOP-R arm consisted of CHOP and Rituximab delivered sequentially as already published(Rambaldi et al Blood 2002). Cross-over was allowed in case of CHOP-R failure. Centralized minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis with the bcl-2/IgH was planned on BM. Analysis was intention to treat. Toxic deaths were 4 (2 in each arm); in addition 1 solid cancer and 2 MDS-ANLL occurred in the R-HDS arm and 1 solid cancer in the CHOP-R arm. CR rates were 59% with CHOP-R and 85% with R-HDS (p<0.001). Progressions were 28% with CHOP-R and 10% with R-HDS (p<0.025). At 36 months EFS and PFS for CHOP-R are 36% and 38% while for R-HDS are 66% and 72% (EFS: figure 1a) . The better outcome for R-HDS was seen both in grade I, II and grade III pts. OS at 36 months was 83% in each arm. Cross-over from CHOP-R to R-HDS was chosen in 67% patients failing CHOP-R with a CR rate of 73%. MRD analysis is available in 44% of pts. A stable molecular remission (MR) was achieved in 26% of CHOP-R pts and 78% of R-HDS pts (p<0,001). A persistent MR was associated to an improved PFS (p<0,001) (figure 1b). Interestingly, PFS of PCR+ and PCR-pts was similar, regardless of the treatment received: 3-years PFS for PCR+ pts was 25% for CHOP-R and 32% for R-HDS, while 3-years PFS for PCR-pts was 67% with CHOP-R and 76% with R-HDS). This is the first randomized study with a significant proportion of molecularly-studied pts in FL and compares for the first time an intensified versus a conventional schedule in the Rituximab age. Conclusions are: a) R-HDS induces more CRs and ensures a better EFS and PFS compared to CHOP-R in this rare and aggressive population of pts. b) R-HDS induces more MRs; c) the similar outcome in PCR+ and PCRpts, regardless of treatment received, indicates that the superior outcome of R-HDS is largely explained by the superior rate of MRs achieved with the intensified treatment. Background: Sezary syndrome (SS), tumor-stage Mycosis Fungoides (t-sMF) and other cutaneous T-cell Lymphomas (CTCL) in advanced stage or refractory to front-line chemotherapy are generally considered incurable with currently available treatments.In this context the role of the allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) should be explored in order to investigate if an immunotherapeutic effect of \"Graft versus Tumor\" does exist against such dismal diseases. Patients and Methods: From May 2004 to Agust 2006, 5 patients with a median age of 48 years (range, 28-62)underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for SS (n=2), t-sMF (n=1), Panniculitis (n=1)and CD30+ T-cell Lymphoma (n=1). was The median time from diagnosis to SCT was 5 years (range, 2-10) with a median number of 3 (range 2-4) lines of given therapies . Four patients were grafted from an HLA identical sibling, while the patient with CTCL received a single, unrelated, 2 HLA antigen mismatched cord blood unit. The chemotherapy based conditioning regimens were myeloablative in 2 patients with t-sMF and CTCL and nonmyeloablative in the 3 patients affected by SS or Panniculitis Results: All patients engrafted with complete clinical remission. Furthermore, molecular disease remission and chimerism of full donor origin were detected at 60 days after SCT. No patient developed acute GVHD, while extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 2 patients. No other major complication was observed. The relapse occurred in one patient with SS at 270 days after transplant and a further complete remission was achieved by 2 DLI infusions from the original donor, after an induced cutaneous acuteGVHD. At a median follow-up of 21 months (range, 4-31 ), all patients are alive and in complete remission. Conclusion: Despite the small number of patients, our results suggest that allogeneic SCT seems a very effective therapy for different T-cell cutaneous lymphomas, which can be particularly sensitive to its GvT immunotherapeutic activity .",

We report a retrospective analysis of allo-SCT in patients with lymphoma from four centers in years 1999-2006. Methods: We analysed 78 patients (pts), sex ratio M/F 49/29. Histological subtypes were: Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma (HL) n=18, diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) n=16, follicular lymphoma (FL) n=17, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) n=9, peripheral T-cell lymphoma n=8, and 10 other lymphomas. Median age was 45 years. Donors were identical siblings (IS) in 48 pts (62%) or unrelated volunteers (UD) in 30 (38%). Sixty (77%) pts received reduce-intensity conditioning (RIC), eighteen (23%) were treated with myeloablative conditioning (MC). Forty-one (53%) pts had previous autologous SCT. At time of allo-SCT, forty-eight (62%) pts had chemosensitive disease, twenty-four (31%) were chemoresistant (six were untested). Median interval from diagnosis to SCT was 25 months (2-198). Results: Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) occurred in 26 (33%) pts (17x grade 1-2, 9x grade 3-4). Of the 53 evaluable pts nineteen (36%) developed chronic GVHD. Overall 100-day and 1-year resp 3-years TRM rates were 27%,33% and 33% resp. (22%,30% and 30% for RIC, 39%, 44% and 44% for MC). Relapse incidence was 26%. With a median folow-up of 26 months (3-109) of living pts, actuarial overall survival (OS) at 3 years is 44%, event free survival (EFS) 42% and relaps rate 45%. The 3-years OS of pts with HL, DLCL, FCL, MCL and PTL is 65%, 23%, 53%, 32% and 88% resp (DLCL vs PTL, p=0,01 and PTL vs all others, p=0,01). Pts with chemoresistant disease had significantly less outcome (3y OS 22% vs 56%,p=0,002). There was no correlation between GVHD and relapse rate. There was no significant diference in 3y OS between pts treated with MC and RIC (54% vs 42%), between IS and UD (46% vs 48%), or between pts with vs without previous ASCT (35% vs 52%, p=0,14). At time of last follow-up 41 pts are dead. Conclusion: Allogeneic SCT represents an effective therapeutic option for patients with poor prognosis lymphoma, however TRM as well as relapse risk are still high. RIC may be an option for erderly patients but it\u00b4s not clear if offer the same effectivity as standard MC. Transplants from UD and IS had the same outcome.

We analyzed the EBMT experience of 129 patients, who underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Median age at SCT was 50 years (range 2-74), 6 patients were <18 years and 21 patients >60 years old. Histological subtypes were diffuse large B-cell (63), Burkitt's (8), Tlymphoblastic (7), B-lymphoblastic (5), follicular (7), other lowgrade (6), Hodgkin's (3), and various differently specified (30). At diagnosis testicular involvement alone was found in 36 patients (28%) and additional extranodal involvement in 41 (32%), most frequently bone marrow (24), central nervous system (10), lung (8), bones (5) and gastrointestinal tract (5). Elevated serum LDH was found in 35/87 patients (40%) and systemic symptoms in 31/96 (32%). Median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 9 months (2.3-92). Disease status at ASCT was CR1 in 45 patients (31%), CR2 in 26 (20%), PR1 in 27 (21%), refractory relapse in 15 (12%) and others in 16 patients. Stem-cell source was bone marrow in 16 patients, PBSC in 109 and both in 4. TBI was used for conditioning in 19 patients (15%). The regimens more frequently used were BEAM in 64, Cy-TBI in 12 and BEAC in 7. Seven patients died from non-relapse mortality (NRM) and 59 progressed / relapsed post-transplant, with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 6% and 46%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 25 months (range 1-152), 74 patients are alive, 60 of them disease-free, with a KM probability of OS and PFS at 2 years of 58% and 48%. PFS at 2 years for patients transplanted in CR1 was 57%, for those transplanted in CR2 44%, in first PR 45% and in refractory relapse 46%. On multivariate analysis, disease status at ASCT (others vs CR1; p=0.04) and the presence of additional extranodal involvement at diagnosis (p=0.001) correlated with higher risk of relapse after ASCT. A trend to a lower risk of relapse (p=0.06) was observed for patients receiving TBI. Disease status at ASCT (other vs CR1; p=0.015) and the presence of additional extranodal involvement (p=0.008) predicted for a shorter PFS. In conclusion, the factor with a higher impact on the outcome after ASCT was the presence of other extranodal involvement. Better results are expected when the procedure is performed in first CR. Finally, TBI-containing regimens seem to be associated with a lower risk of relapse.",

Methods: we retrospectively analyzed 47 lymphoma patients, 10 with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 37 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), treated with HDS followed by ASCT, between February 1999 and March 2006 at our institution. The median age was 45 years old (range: 18-69), and patients were treated upfront (if they had an age-adjusted IPI 2 at diagnosis) or at relapse after conventional first-line chemotherapy; FDG-PET scans were all performed at our institution within 46 days before ASCT. HDS scheme is a sequence of different chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, etoposide, cysplatine) administered at high doses at established intervals. The most common conditioning regimen was mitoxantrone and highdose melphalan. Results: with a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 8-81), no significant differences in PFS or OS were observed between PET-positive and PET-negative group ( fig.1 ); the median PFS and the OS for both groups were not reached. However, a significant difference was observed in patients who received HDS for relapsed disease (n=33) when we compared OS with respect to FDG-PET status before ASCT ( fig.2) . The 2-year OS was 90% vs 51% in PET-negative (n=23) and PET-positive (n=10) group, respectively. The median OS was not reached in any of the 2 groups. Interestingly, all the 13 patients affected by lymphomas other than HD and diffuse-large-B-cell and Hodgkin's lymphomas (7 follicular lymphomas, 2 anaplastic T-cell lymphomas, 2 mantle-cell lymphomas and 2 MALT lymphomas) reached FDG-PET negativity, probably due to the impact of doseintensity of the above-mentioned chemotherapeutic regimen on the metabolic activity of these hystotypes. Conclusion: pre-transplant FDG-PET is predictive of survival in relapsed patients affected by HD and NHL treated with HDS followed by ASCT. Patients with positive pre-transplant FDG-PET should be considered candidate to tandem autologous and allogeneic transplantation.",

            "text": "Introduction: Prognosis of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) is considered dismal not only after antracyclinecontaining chemoterapy but also after autoSCT. Regarding this clinical studies incorporating aloSCT as up-front therapy have been drafted. But PTCLs are a heterogenous group of malignancies, experience with auto SCT is limited and controversial (particularly in up-front treatment), experience with autoSCT in single histologic subtypes is missing at all. The aim of our study was to perform a retrospective analysis of peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified (PTCLu) as the largest subgroup of PTCLs in terms of autoSCT performed in CR1 or after first relaps. Methods: All T-NHL treated in years 96-05 were histologically reviewed. Pts. with PTCLu and treated with/without autoSCT were selected. OS of all transplanted pts. and OS of pts. transplanted up-front and after first relaps were analysed. Results were compared with the group of pts. treated in the same period without autoSCT and reasons for diversed treatment were analysed. Results: Histological specimens of 54 pts. with T-NHL were reviewed. PTCLu has been confirmed in 27 cases. 16 pts (median age 46,5 years) underwent autoSCT (5x in CR1, 11x after first relaps ). 11 pts. (median age 66 years) were not transplanted (4 because of death during induction, 4 because of fast and chemoresistant relaps, 2 because of high age). Median follow-up of both groups is 6 years. OS of all transplanted pts. is 67%, OS of pts. transplanted in CR1 and after relaps is 66% and 58%, p=0,5056. No pt. with relaps after SCT survives. OS of the non-transplanted group is 9%, only one pt has been surviving for 10 months. Conclusions: Despite the objection a cohort of any subgroup of PTCLs must be small for a single center study and biased by retrospective analysis we strongly believe: 1) OS of pts. with chemosensitive PTCLu transplanted in CR1 might be much better, even excellent, compared to OS of pts. with T-NHL in all. 2) AutoSCT seems to reach excellent outcome even in pts. with PTCLu after chemosensitive relaps. 3) Only pts. with PTCLu chemoresistant/progressive to first line antracycline-containing chemotherapy have very dismal prognosis and should be considered for innovative treatments like alloSCT. This subgroup seems to consist of significantly older pts. and RIC protocols should be considered.",

M\u00fcller, R. Marks, C. Ostertag, J. Finke University Hospital (Freiburg, D) Purpose: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) have a dismal prognosis despite initial response to steroids and radiotherapy (RT). Addition of high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) to RT has improved the prognosis of patients (pts) with PCNSL. However, the majority of pts eventually relapse. High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) with consolidating whole-brain radiation (WBRT) showed favourable results in a recent phase II trial with 30 pts. (Illerhaus et al., J Clin Oncol. 2006 ). However, the rate of leukoencephalopathy (5 of 30) was of concern. Here we present the results of a monocentric pilot study using early HDT and ASCT for PCNSL without obligatory WBRT to reduce neurotoxicity for patients (pts) under 65 yrs. Patients and Methods: Chemotherapy treatment included 3 sequential steps: 1) induction with up to 4 cycles of high-dose systemic methotrexate (8 g/m\u00b2); 2) two cycles AraC (2x 3 g/m\u00b2) and thiotepa (40 mg/m\u00b2) followed by rG-CSF and stem cell mobilization; 3) conditioning regimen with BCNU (400 mg/m\u00b2) and thiotepa (4x5 mg/kgBW) followed by ASCT. WBRT was restricted to incomplete responders after HDT + ASCT. Results: Eleven patients with PCNSL with a median age of 54 yrs (range 38-67) were enrolled. Objective response was 9 of 11 (7 CR, 2 PR). Two refractory diseases were observed, one after AraC/Thiotepa, the other after HDT and ASCT. Both pts with PR after ASCT received WBRT resulting in a sustained complete remission. During follow-up one patient died because of early systemic and cerebral relapse from CR 8 months after ASCT. Treatment related mortality was 0%. With a median follow-up of 19 months (range: 2-44) 8 of 11 (73%) patients are alive in CR and in good condition without clinical signs of leukoencephalopathy. Conclusion: Sequential systemic application of maximum dosed cytostatic agents followed by HDT+ASCT without obligatory WBRT is highly effective as initial therapy for patients with PCNSL. HDT + ASCT was tolerated well, with little acute toxicity. A multicenter phase two study using this protocol will be implemented in January 2007.",

Responses have been retrospectively assessed using International Workshop Criteria. Pts typically received 2-3 cycles of platinum-based salvage therapy to assess chemotherapy sensitivity; responding pts proceeded to PBSC mobilization or bone marrow harvest and subsequent ASCT. The intensive therapy regimen typically consisted of high-dose VP16 60 mg/kg day -4 and melphalan 180 mg/m\u00b2 day -3 with stem cell infusion day 0 (TBI day -2 to 0 if used). Pts with bulky disease at relapse (> 5cm) received involved field radiation post-ASCT. Results: 467 pts were identified with 57% male and 43% female. The median age at ASCT was 49.8 (range 19 -67). Disease status at ASCT was: CR/CRU 39.4%, PR 57.4%, SD 1.5% and unknown 1.5%. NHL histology was: DLBC 52.8%, Transformed 15.4%, follicular 12.4%, T-cell: 12.4% and other: 7%. Stem cell source was: peripheral blood 59.1%, bone marrow: 29.8% and mixed 11.1%. The high dose therapy regimen was VP16 60 mg/kg + melphalan 180 mg/m\u00b2: 77%, VP16 60 mg/kg + melphalan 160 mg/m\u00b2+ 12 Gy TBI: 19% and other: 4%. With a follow-up of up to 210 months post-ASCT (median 22 months), the overall survival of the entire cohort is 51.9% and the progression-free survival is 52.6%. Causes of death were recurrent disease: 31%, treatment-related mortality (TRM): 7%, other non-relapse mortality: 6% and unknown: 4%. Conclusions: With an experience of over 450 transplants employing VP16/melphalan based HDCT, long-term OS and PFS are approximately 50% with an acceptable TRM. These results demonstrate that VP16/melphalan is a regimen with excellent long-term toxicity and provides excellent long-term disease control of NHL. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL). We report here our experience in 25 consecutive patients transplanted in a single center for high grade (n=17) or follicular NHL (FL; n=8). In the high grade NHL group, median age was 46 (range, 24-63) years, and all 17 patients received 2 or more previous chemotherapy regimens prior to RIC allo-SCT. In addition, 12 patients (71%) had failed autologous SCT and 6 patients (35%) had chemoresistant disease at time of allo-SCT. Among the 8 patients transplanted for a heavily pretreated follicular NHL (FL), median age was 52 (range, 34-59) years and median number of prior lines of therapy was 3 (range, 2-5), with 3 patients (38%) having chemoresistant diseases and 4 patients (50%) relapsing after autologous SCT. Among the 17 patients with aggressive high grade NHL, we compared the outcome of T-cell and B-cell aggressive NHL. With a median follow-up of 15.4 (range, 3.4-65.2) months, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 6%, (95%CI, 0.3%-31%) and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher in the T-cell as compared to the B-cell group (P= 0.03; 100% vs. 40% at 3 years). In the FL group, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 25% (95%CI, 3%-65%). Six patients (75%) showed objective disease response with complete remission (CR) occurring concomitantly to graft-versus-host disease, including one CR after donor lymphocytes infusion. With a median follow-up of 19 (range, 7-85) months, 6 patients from the FL group are still alive of whom 5 in CR. We conclude that a potent graft-vs.-lymphoma (GVL) may be achieved in FL patients, even those with chemoresistant disease or who have relapsed after autologous SCT. In the high grade NHL group, strategies aiming to enhance the GVL effect (Rituximab-based RIC and/or Rituximab maintenance therapy) in the B cell subtype are still needed. However, RIC allo-SCT is a feasible and promising strategy for aggressive NHL, with particularly low toxicity, and T-cell aggressive NHL benefiting most from a potent GVL effect, likely overcoming the poor prognosis usually associated with this phenotype.",

Patients and methods: Twenty eight patients underwent to a single autologous stem cell transplantation (s-HDC), 18 to tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (t-HDC). At the time of transplantation in s-HDC group, 50% of patients were in CR, 35% in partial remission (PR), 14% in progressive disease (PD). In t-HDC group, 38% of patients were in CR, 50%, in PR and 11% in PD. In s-HDC, 4 patients (14%) received BEAM (BCNU 300 mg/m\u00b2 day -6, VP-16 800 mg/m\u00b2 and cytarabine 1600 mg/m\u00b2 in 4 days, melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 day -1); ten patients (36%) high dose melphalan (200 mg/m\u00b2, at day -1); 14 (50%) received TM regimen (Thiotepa 600 mg/m\u00b2 day -3, PAM 160 mg/m\u00b2 day -1). In t-HDC the first course of HDC consisted of MEL200 and the second one of BEAM. Overall survival (OS) and freedom from progression (FFP) were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The CR rate was 71% in s-HDC and 87% after t-HDC (p= 0.6), meanwhile the PR rate was 11% s-HDC and 17% in t-HDT. With a median follow-up time of 30.5 (1-102) months, the 3-year overall survival and freedom from progression in s-HDC 66% and 52%, and in t-HDT were 83% and 77 %, respectively. In both groups, no statistical differences were seen in hematological and extra hematological toxicity and 100-day treatment-related mortality was null. Conclusions: Tandem HDC is feasible and safe in poor prognosis NHL. It seems to improve clinical results compared to a standard approach with single HDC. Long-term follow-up of a larger cohort of patients and a randomized study will be needed to confirm the overall efficacy of this strategy and to evaluate long-term toxicity.",

The purpose of this study is to report our experience with HDC and ASCT in PR-HL. Patients and Methods: From 1996 to May 2006, 66 consecutive patients with HL who failed induction chemotherapy i.e. partial response (PR), no response (NR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or relapsing within 3 months of finishing the planned treatment received salvage chemotherapy followed by BEAM as HDC. Patients with progressive disease on salvage chemotherapy were not eligible for HDC ASCT. Impact of various prognostic factors prior to the initiation of salvage chemotherapy on events free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS ) was evaluated using multivariate regression analysis Results: Male 35 (53 %), female 31 (47 %), Median age at diagnosis 21 years and at ASCT 22.75 years. Prior to salvage chemotherapy, stages I:II:III:IV were 2:21:14:29, bulky disease ( 8 cm) in 18 (27 %), involvement of mediastinum in 50 (79 %), spleen 17 (26 %) and extranodal-site in 31 (47 %) patients. 23 (35%) had short lived CR, and 16 (24 %) had prior XRT. 38 patients (58 %) had tissue confirmation at relapse/progression. ESHAP was used as first line salvage in 60 patients (92 %); median cycles given were 3. Disease evaluation post ASCT showed overall response in 50 patients (77 %); CR 43 (65 %), PR 14 (21 %), NR / SD 3 (5%) and PD in 13 (20 %) patients. 2 patients had treatment related mortality. 24 out of 53 patients (45 %) with no CR prior to ASCT achieved CR after ASCT. 12 (28 %) of 42 patients in CR post HDC ASCT relapsed. Median followup: from diagnosis 36 months and from HDC and ASCT 18 months; EFS is 38 %; 31 (47 %) remain in CR, 19 ( 29 %) died of disease and 14 ( 21 %) were alive with disease at last followup. Conclusion: In patients with PR-HL, ESHAP + BEAM combination results in 76 % response rate with 43 % CR rate. Despite this high responsiveness, almost quarter of patients with CR relapsed. 29 % patients died due to disease. At a median follow up of 18 months, EFS is only 38 %. We failed to identify impact of any prognostic factor on EFS and OS. Better understanding and treatment strategies are needed for this group of patients. S. Akhtar, A. Al-Zahrani, M. Rahal, A.

Maghfoor King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (Riyadh, SA) Objective: To evaluate the outcome of patients treated with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stemcell transplant (HDC ASCT) for relapsed or refractory diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) at our institution. Material and Methods: From 1996 to May 2006, 63 consecutive patients with DLCL who received either ESHAP alone or ESHAP alternating with some other salvage chemotherapy regimen prior to ASCT were identified. Responding patients received ESHAP for mobilization of PBSC followed by BEAM as HDC. Refractory disease is defined as patient who failed induction chemotherapy i.e. partial response (PR), no response (NR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). Results: Males 36 , females 27, median age at diagnosis 35 years ( 14 to 67 years) and at transplant 41 years ( 14 to 67 years). Stage at initial diagnosis I (13), II (16), III (14), IV (18). Initial chemotherapy was CHOP in 50 patients (79%). (71%) had prior CR / CRu, 17 (27%) patients had primary refractory disease. 44 patients (70%) had 3 cycles and 10 (16%) had 4 cycles of ESHAP. 18 (28%) had CR /CRu prior to HDC ASC. Median follow up is 35 months from diagnosis and 18 months after HDC ASCT. 44 (70%) patients had CR / CRu after HDC ASCT. 10 (22%) had no response or progressive disease post HDC ASCT. 26 (41%) patients with PR after ESHAP achieved CR as a result of HDC ASCT. As of September 2006, 27 (43%) patients are in CR. 20 (32%) had relapsed, 31 ( 49%) had died. For the whole group, median OS from diagnosis is 68 months and from ASCT is 43 months. EFS is 44% for the whole group. Median OS for 45 relapsed patients is 98 months (from diagnosis) and 50 months (from ASCT ) and for 18 primary refractory patients, 28 months and 12 months respectively. OS from diagnosis and HDC ASCT was better in favor of relapse vs primary refractory disease; P = 0.015 and p = 0.027 respectively. Conclusion: Although we have 70% CR rate in this group, 46% of total CR patients have relapsed and EFS is only 43%. Out come of primary refractory disease is even worse. Better treatment strategies are urgently needed for these groups of patients.",

Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft has displaced bone marrow (BM) because of faster engraftment and benefits both in the harvest and handling of the graft. However, in heavily pretreated patients the mobilization may fail and BM may remain the only available source of graft. We have analyzed the outcome of autologous transplantation in NHL according to the type of the graft. 106 adult patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital in 1991-2006 were studied retrospectively. The graft was BM in 26 and PBSC in 80 cases. Marrow graft was used in most cases because of mobilization failure (17/26) or heavy pretreatment predicting poor mobilization. According to the WHO classification the type of NHL was diffuse large B-cell in 40 patients, follicular in 38 and transformed follicular in 5 patients, peripheral T-cell in 7 patients, anaplastic T-cell in 8 patients, and other in 8 patients. Of the patients 54 were males and 52 females. At transplantation the median age was 48 years (range 20-65 years). 40 patients were in CR1, 38 in PR1. In 7 patients the disease was primarily refractory. 21 patients were in CR2 or PR after relapse. Before the intensive treatment the median number of CHOP-like treatments given was 10 (range 4-24) in the BM group and 7 (3-16) in the PBSC group. The median number of mononuclear cells in the BM grafts was 0.33x10 8 /kg (range 0.11-1.4). In the PBSC grafts the median number of CD34+ cells was 4.0x10 6 /kg (0.46-13.2). The median engraftment time (neutrophils >0.5x10 9 /l) in the BM group was 18 days (9-93) and in the PBSC group 12 days (8-33).

Hatoum, Z. Salem, A. Tawil, G. Zaatari, A. Bazarbachi American University of Beirut (Beirut, LBN) Hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphoma (HS GD TCL) is a distinct clinico-pathological entity among peripheral T-cell lymphomas (TCL) with an extremely poor prognosis. Recently, we have shown that the selective proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Btz) induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in malignant but not normal T cells supporting a potential therapeutic role for Btz in TCL (Nasr et al Oncogene 2005;24:419-30). We report a 33 year-old woman who presented with hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with increased erythroblasts and dyserythropoiesis. Laparoscopic splenectomy revealed expansion of the red pulp with dilatation of the sinusoids containing atypical lymphoid cells and abundant hemophagocytosis. Liver biopsy revealed diffuse sinusoidal dilatation containing the same atypical lymphoid cells which were strongly + for CD2, CD3, CD7, CD56, TiA-1 and CD45RO while CD5 was negative. Molecular testing confirmed the rearrangement of the gammadelta chains of the T-cell receptor and the diagnosis of HS GD TCL. She received 4 cycles of platinum-cytarabine based therapy (ESHAP). Repeat liver biopsy showed minimal response. After informed consent, she received Btz (Velcade 1 mg/m\u00b2/day on days 1 and 5) with a modified high dose CHOP chemotherapy (ACVB) with G-CSF support every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. Because of potential additive peripheral neurotoxicity with Btz, vincristin was deleted from the first 2 cycles. This treatment was well tolerated; two cycles were complicated by febrile neutropenia and 2 cycles by transient grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Laparoscopic liver biopsy showed almost complete remission (CR) with a single small atypical lymphoid infiltrate. The patient then underwent stem cell mobilization with high dose cyclophosphamide+G-CSF followed by stem cell collection and cryopreservation. She then received BEAM conditioning regimen followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (APSCT). The post-transplant course was relatively smooth with WBC and platelet engraftment at 9 and 6 days respectively. Three years after diagnosis and 26 months after transplantation the patient is still in CR. These data demonstrate that the combination of Btz and high dose CHOP-like chemotherapy followed by APSCT is a feasible and potentially efficient way to treat HS GD TCL. The remarkable efficacy of this combination in a patient with HS GD TCL stresses the need for further trials of this regimen in peripheral TCL.",

Abdul Hai, M.Y. Shapira, L. Weiss, S. Reich, S. Slavin Hadassah -Hebrew University (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: Thiotepa (TH), an ethylene amide, developed by Lederle Laboratories in 1952, possesses mechlorethaminelike alkylating activity and has been used clinically more than 40 years. It is utilized especially in breast cancer, carcinomatous meningitis and for bladder carcinoma. In the last years, the use of the drug has been restored due to the ability of significantly increase the dose 10-22 fold, in comparison to only 3-5 fold in most of other anti-tumor agents, while rescue was done by reinfusion of cryopreserved autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cells. Yet, there is no sufficient information about its administration in high doses with or without other chemotherapeutic agents in lymphatic malignancies. Methods: One day following inoculation of BALB/c mice with between 105 to 108 BCL1 leukemia cells (simulating various pre-transplant leukemia loads) each mice group received one of the \"induction-like\" irradiation and/or cytotoxic containing conditioning regimens simulating the common BMT induction methods. Five to 11 days from the end of treatment, adoptive transfer to untreated BALB/c mice was done in order to evaluate the effect of the induction treatment and the residual disease. Recipients were observed for the development of leukemia for at least 150 days. Splenomegaly and peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were monitored to confirm presence of leukemia and to determine if leukemia was indeed the cause of death. Results: given alone, high dose TH did not change the time for appearance of leukemia. The cyclophosphamide (CY) containing regimens were the most effective ones. Combining CY with TH showed borderline significance (p=0.067) when AT was done on day 5 as compared to the BU-TH combination. Additionally, in a different study, a synergistic effect have been seen in the combination of TH-CY (none of the animals developed leukemia) whereas 4/10 animals in the CY-TBI group developed leukemia (p=0.029, figure 1 ). Conclusion: although TH did not show a significant effect against BCL1 leukemia, its combination with CY is promising.",

Martinelli European Institute of Oncology (Milan, I) High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) with peripheral blood stem cell support can provide sustained remissions in pts with refractory/relapsed HL. We report a retrospective analysis of 71 consecutive HL (34 recurrent and 37 refractory) pts who were submitted to HDT between 1995 and 2006 in our institution. The major part of pts had nodular sclerosis HL (63 pts). Stage at diagnosis was II in 45 pts and III-IV in 26 pts. ABVD, MOPP, hybrid regimens represented the first-line therapy in 36 of pts while 35 pts received a chemoradiotherapy combination. Median age at transplantation time was 32 years (range18-56). Before HDT, pts had been treated with a median of two chemotherapy lines (range 1-4). Two cycles of ESHAP regimen was the induction therapy. At the time of transplantation, 21 (29 %) pts were in CR, 37 (52%) in PR, 8 (11%) had SD/PD and for 5 pts response data was not available. All pts were conditioned with chemotherapy: 59 received BEAM and 13 pts Idarubicine (15mg/sqmx3d)/LPAM (180mg/sqm) combination. Radiotherapy was performed after transplantation in 13 pts. No treatment related mortality was observed and engraftment was achieved in all pts. Two pts developed ITP after 43 and 10.5 months from transplant and one patient developed an AML after 49 months from transplant. Fifty-two (73.2%) out of 71 pts achieved CR (27 of recurrent and in 25 of refractory pts), 8/71 (12%) a PR and 11/71 (15%) a SD/PD. With a median follow-up of 23 months (range 2-112), 44/71 pts are in continuous CR, while 26/71 progressed and twelve died because of their disease. Our data support the activity of HDT in this subset of pts, mainly in the relapsed pts (DFS 70% in relapsed vs 54% in refractory pts). Refractory pts can also benefit of the salvage therapy although more efficacious alternative therapeutic options should be proposed; the role of non-myeloablative transplant procedure in pts with an identical sibling donor after HDT is under investigation.",

            "text": "Optimal strategy for progenitor cell mobilisation in patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is unknown. We analysed efficiency and toxicity of mobilisation therapy in this patient category. Between 1998 and 2005 altogether 88 patients with relapsed DLBCL (58 M, 30 F) with a median age of 53 yrs (23-69) received either cyclophosphamide (CY) plus G-CSF (N=45) or diseasespecific chemotherapy (CT) plus G-CSF (N=43) for mobilisation of progenitor cells in five Finnish centres. The most common CT regimens were CHOP-like (N=12), VIG (N=10) and dexa-BEAM (N=8). At least 2 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells were collected after the first mobilisation attempt in 69 patients (78 %). This goal was achieved in 82 % of patients in CY-group and in 72 % of patients mobilised with CT + G-CSF (P=NS). No differences were observed in the median number of aphaeresis between these groups (2 vs. 2), but the median number of CD34+ cells collected tended to be higher in patients mobilised with CY + G-CSF (5.0 vs. 3.4 x 10 6 /kg, P=0.069). Neutropenic fever was more common in the CYgroups (38 % vs. 14 %, P=0.03) and the in-hospital stay during aphaeresis and supportive care longer (5 vs 3 days, P=004). Rituximab was used during relapse treatment in 26 % of the patients but did not have effect on mobilisation efficiency. In this retrospective survey, no clear preferences suggesting superiority of one approach over another was observed. Thus local preferences and need for effective disease control seem to be decisive in regard to optimal mobilisation strategy in this patient group. Since a significant proportion of patients with relapsed DLBCL are difficult to mobilise with either strategies, novel agents for mobilisation are needed. A. Szomor, M. David, T. Vidra, H. Losonczy University Pecs (Pecs, HUN) Objectives: Two hundred and fifteen patients underwent autologous hemopoetic stem cell transplantation in our clinic. Fifty four of them (25%) had diffuse large B-cell (DLCL) lymphoma. Monoclonal anti-CD20 therapy (Rituximab) has been available since November 2002 in Hungary. In vivo purging with Rituximab is proven to prolong survival after hemopoetic stem cell transplantation. Methods: Main demographic data, the number of apheresis, the cryopreserved stem cell count and the transplantation outcome were compared in stem cell mobilization regimens containing Rituximab (Group A) with regimens without Rituximab (Group B). Results: Figure  Conclusions : Addition of Rituximab to mobilization regimens has no adverse effects on stem cell harvesting (number of apheresis procedures, CD34 + cell counts and time to engraftment). It is safe and produces durable remissions.",

            "text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is currently being used as upfront or salvage therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with MM (n=89) who underwent allo-SCT in our institution between 2000 and 2006. Indications for upfront allo-SCT were chromosome 13 deletion, beta-2-microglobulin >3 mg/l (n=27) or primary progressive disease (n=4). Indications for allo-SCT as salvage treatment were relapse after auto-SCT (n=47) or progressive MM after first-line therapy (n=11). In all upfront patients, allo-SCT was applied 3-6 months after an auto-SCT. Conditioning with 2 Gy total body irradiation and fludarabine (90 mg/m\u00b2) was used in all but 6 patients who received melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 + fludarabine 90 mg/m\u00b2. Of note, no patient had in-vivo or ex-vivo T cell depletion. Median age was 52 (range 29-69) years. Donors were related in 49 patients and unrelated in 40 patients. In 24 patients at least one antigen or allele mismatch out of ten loci was present. Twelve patients (13%) were in CR prior to allo-SCT. Results: As best response, 32/81 patients (40%) achieved CR after allo-SCT. After a median follow-up of 17 months (range 0,5 -76), median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9 months and 39 months, respectively. Incidence of chronic GvHD was 79% (2/3 extensive). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 16%. Significant factors for OS and EFS were achievement of CR after allo-SCT (p<0.001) and the presence of chronic GvHD (p<0.01). Patients with upfront SCT showed a significant prolonged OS (p=0.04), but EFS was not different. No significant differences regarding OS and EFS were observed between related vs. unrelated donors and matched vs. mismatched donors. Conclusions: Disease recurrence or progression remains the major cause of treatment failure after allo-SCT in high risk MM. The favorable impact of chronic GVHD on disease control confirms the importance of the GvM effect. Further concepts are necessary to increase CR rates, to prevent relapse or progression e.g. using maintenance strategies, and to reduce TRM after allo-SCT.",

Ruutu Helsinki University Central Hospital (Helsinki, FIN) At the Helsinki University Central Hospital 106 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have been treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) since 1987. The conditioning was at first myeloablative (MA), but since 1999 reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) after autologous SCT has mostly been used. MA conditioning has been considered only in young patients with aggressive disease. Of the patients 53 were male and 53 female. The median number of chemotherapy lines was 1 (range 1-7) before allogeneic SCT. In addition, prior autologous SCT had been performed to 55 patients. The median time from diagnosis to allogeneic SCT was 12 (4-168) months, and the time between autologous and allogeneic SCT 6 (2-146) months. At the time of allogeneic SCT 13 patients were in CR, 73 in PR, 3 in MR, 4 had SD, and 13 showed progression. The median age at the time of allogeneic SCT was 49 (27-65) years. 90 patients had a sibling donor: 86 were HLA -identical, one 1 antigen mismatch, and 3 syngeneic. 16 patients had an HLA-matched unrelated donor. The conditioning was MA in 52 and RIC in 54 patients. The MA conditioning consisted of Cy/TBI in 37, Cy/Bu in 4, HDMel/TBI in 3, and Treosulphan/Fld in 8 patients. RIC was the Seattle protocol in 45, reduced Treosulphan/Fld in 8, and Fld/Cy in 1 patient. 44 patients received a BM graft and 62 patients a PB graft. As GVHD prophylaxis, 27 patients were given Cya/Mtx, 28 Cya/Mtx/MP, 3 Mtx/MP, 45 Cya/MMF, and 3 nothing (syngeneic). The median follow-up time from allogeneic SCT was 34 (1.6-206) months. Until 1995 MA allogeneic SCT was performed to 18 heavily treated patients and all but one of them have died. Among the 88 (34 MA and 54 RIC) patients transplanted since 1995 the OS was 50% at 61 months post SCT and there were no deaths after 61 months. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade 2-4 was 28%. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 72%, 58% in the MA and 83% in the RIC patients (p=0.074). There was no statistical difference in the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD by donor (72 siblings/16 unrelated). 100-day transplant related mortality was 4.5%. Of the 60 patients alive, the maximum response achieved so far is CR in 28, PR in 19 and 13 have progressive disease. The cause of death in the patients transplanted after 1995 was MM in 17, GVHD in 7, and infection in 4 patients. In conclusion, in the present material early transplant related mortality is low and the survival is encouraging.",

Naro, L. Siracusano, P. Sciarrone University of Messina (Messina, I) In multiple myeloma the frequency of p53 deletions detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is reported to range from 9%to 34% and associated with poor survival. We investigated the relevance of p53 deletions to the clinical outcome of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Material and Methods: Between January 1998 and December 2003, 50 patients were diagnosed and treated for MM with high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT. All patients received 4 cycles of the VAD regimen (Vincristine, Adriamycin, and Dexamethasone) followed by stem cell mobilization with Cyclophosphamide 5 g/m\u00b2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and 1 course of melphalan 200 mg/m 2 immediately prior to ASCT. To detect p53 deletions, a Spectrum Red-labeled DNA probe (LSI p53 Vysis) specific for the p53 locus on 17p13.1 was combined with a Spectrum Green-labeled probe for the chromosome 17 alphasatellite-DNA centromere. Results: An interstitial p53 deletion identified by one red (p53) and 2 green (CEP17) signals was detected in 7 of 50 patients. The median percent of myeloma cells with an interstitial p53 deletion was 47% (range, 28%-90%). A FISH analysis informative for t(4;14),13q status and t(11;14) was available for all cases. Patients with p53 deletions had significantly higher serum calcium and creatinine levels, but there was no significant correlation between p53 status and C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin level and lytic bone lesions. The overall response rates were similar in patients with and without p53 deletions (65% versus 69%, respectively). However, patients with p53 deletions had significantly shorter PFS (median,8.1 months) than patients without p53 deletions (median, 26.1 months, OS was also significantly shorter (median, 13.7 months) for patients with a p53 deletion than for patients without a deletion (median, 46.1 months). Conclusion: p53 deletions in pts with multiple myeloma treated with high-dose chemotherapy is an independent risk factor for both PFS and OS.",

Mohty Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) The role of RIC allo-SCT in MM is still controversial. This single centre study aimed to evaluate RIC allo-SCT for relapsed MM, using a genetic randomization through a donor vs. no donor comparison. Between 2002 and 2005, 32 patients with relapsed or refractory MM, and with an identified sibling, were referred to our centre for HLA typing. In all, 19 patients (59%; donor group) had an HLA-identical sibling donor, while the remaining 13 pts (41%; no donor group) had no HLA-identical sibling donor. There were no significant differences between these two groups that were comparable as for demographic, disease and prognosis factors. Median age was 54 (range, 37-65), and all pts had previously failed auto-SCT. Pts from the no donor group received salvage therapy including thal., bortezomib, dex., and/or additional high dose chemotherapy. Among the 19 pts from the donor group , 18 (95%) could proceed to allo-SCT. With a median overall FU of 36 m., 11 patients (85%;95%CI:54-98%) from the no donor group had disease progression despite salvage therapy, and only 6 of them are still alive, of whom 5 (80%) in progressive disease at last FU. In contrast, only 5 pts (28%;P=0.001) from the donor group progressed after RIC allo-SCT. In the RIC allo-SCT group, 10 pts (56%;95%CI;33-79%) are still alive, with 4 pts being in CR, and 5 in PR or VGPR. Only one patient is currently experiencing disease progression and receiving salvage therapy. Interestingly, 11 pts (61%;95%CI,39-83%) from the RIC allo-SCT group showed objective disease response, usually concurrent to chronic GVHD. In all, 6 pts died from TRM for an overall incidence of TRM of 33% (95%CI,11-55%) in this population of heavily pretreated and relapsed or refractory MM population. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the KM estimate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the donor group as compared to the no donor group (P=0.01;46%vs.8% at 3 y.; Fig. below) . In all, these results compare favorably with those achieved using other standard non-allo-SCT salvage therapies for relapsed MM. Therefore, RIC allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling is a feasible and potential therapy that should be proposed for refractory or relapsed MM, since a potent graft-vs.-MM effect can be induced despite heavy pretreatments, allowing for significantly longer PFS. Also, the latter results are expected to be further improved with the systematic and early use of maintenance therapies after RIC allo-SCT.",

Mohty Institute Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) The aim of this retrospective single centre study was to determine the frequency, characteristics, and reversibility of PN from bortezomib treatment of 100 consecutive advanced multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with bortezomib. PN was evaluated by investigator neurological examination at baseline, during the study, and at last follow-up. Patients characteristics at baseline prior to bortezomib initiation were as follow: median age: 60 (range,27-77), prior history of diabetes: n=8 (8%), prior auto-SCT: n=76 (76%), prior treatment with thalidomide: n=75 (75%) with a median dose of 200 (range,50-600) mg for a median duration of 8 (range,1-61) months. Median duration between thalidomide discontinuation and bortezomib initiation was 5 (range,0-43) m. Before treatment with bortezomib, 48 pts (48%) already had some form of PN [grade 1,n=27(56%);grade 2,n=16(33%); grade 3,n=5(11%)]. With a median FU of 8 (range, 0.1-32) months from bortezomib initiation, pts from this series received a median of 4 (range, 1-12) cycles of bortezomib. Bortezomib-related emergent PN was observed in 38 pts (38%;95%CI,28-47%), with grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 PN occurring in 17 (45%), 15 (39%), 5 (13%) and 1 (3%) pts respectively. Median time to onset of bortezomib-related PN was 53 (range, 11-182) days after bortezomib initiation. In most cases (n=30; 79%), pts had sensory symptoms, while 8 pts (21%) experienced both sensory and motor symptoms. Bortezomib-related PN led to dose reduction or discontinuation in 18 pts. Of the 38 pts with bortezomibrelated PN, resolution to baseline or improvement occurred in 20 (53%) pts, at a median time of 3 (range, 1-8) m. In multivariate analysis, the total number of cycles of bortezomib (less or more than 4 cycles), and a prior history of treatment with thalidomide were the strongest parameters significantly associated with an increased incidence of bortezomib-related PN (P=0.03; OR=2.6;95%CI,1.1-6.1 and P=0.02;OR=3.9;95%CI, 1.2-12.6 respectively). The finding that the development of bortezomib-related PN seems to be dependent of the patient history of prior neurotoxic therapy with thalidomide, raises the question of the optimal sequence and schedule of administration of these anti-MM effective drugs as single agents, but also in combination.",

Mohty Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is currently under investigation for advanced multiple myeloma (MM) with promising results in terms of feasibility and toxicity. However, MM progression is still a matter of concern after such approaches. Bortezomib has demonstrated activity and safety in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM. In addition, animal data suggested that bortezomib may have immunomodulatory effects impacting GVHD activity. This report describes the outcome of 12 MM pts who received bortezomib (1.0 or 1.3 mg/m 2 IV bolus on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, every 21 days) as salvage therapy after progression following RIC allo-SCT. Median age of pts was 51 (27-58) y. and all patients have failed auto-SCT prior to RIC allo-SCT. Median duration between allo-SCT and bortezomib initiation was 17 (1-65) months. 7 pts failed thalidomide prior to bortezomib. Also, 5 patients failed to respond to DLI. At time of bortezomib initiation, 9 pts (75%) were in progressive disease and 3 pts (25%) were in PR. None of the 12 pts had active GVHD, and all of them were off immunosuppressive therapy. Patients received a median of 8 (1-13) cycles of bortezomib (+dex. in 8 pts). During bortezomib therapy, 2 pts experienced limited chronic GVHD that did not require systemic immunosuppression. Among other toxicities, 3 pts experienced exacerbation of prior peripheral neuropathy that was manageable through bortezomib dose reduction. Also, 4 cases of mild (grade 1 or 2) thrombopenia were encountered. With a median FU of 7 (2-35) m. from bortezomib initiation and 48 (16-123) m. from RIC allo-SCT, 7 pts (58%) had an objective disease response (1 CR, 3 VGPR, 3 PR) and 1 patient had a SD. 4 pts continued to progress (of whom 3 died of their disease). In all, we conclude that bortezomib is an efficient salvage therapy without induction of significant deleterious GVHD. Drug-related side effects were limited and manageable after dose reduction. Thus, it represents a valid option for MM pts progressing after RIC allo-SCT. These results provide the framework for testing the earlier use of bortezomib in MM pts undergoing RIC allo-SCT, especially those pts who do not develop alloimmune reactions and/or those pts who do not achieve disease response early after allo-SCT.",

The objective of this study is to define the role PET-CT in assessing the extent of active disease at the time of initial presentation and in evaluating treatment response in MM. We studied 25 previously untreated MM patients at diagnosis, after induction therapy and 3 months after ASCT. The results of PET-CT scans were compared with standard whole skeletal survey and whole spine Magnetic Resonance (MR) at diagnosis and with clinical response to treatment at restaging. Thirteen patients were male, 12 female, median age was 59 years (range 44-69), 14 had IgG, 9 IgA monoclonal protein and one had a Bence Jones MM. Two patients had stage IA MM, 4 had stage IIA and1 9 stage IIIA MM according with Durie and Salmon classification. The patients underwent induction therapy consisting of thalidomide plus dexamethasone or VAD for 4 months, then proceeded to collection of PBSC mobilized by 4 g/m\u00b2 Cyclophosphamide + G-CSF and myeloablative treatment with 200 mg/m\u00b2 Melphalan. At diagnosis PET-CT scans were negative in 10 patients (40%) and positive in 15 patients (60%). PET-CT scans and skeletal radiographic findings were concordant in 16/25 patients (64%). In 5/25 cases (20%) PET-CT scans detected more disease sites than skeletal survey or MR (all bone lesions). MR showed a focal pattern of bone marrow involvement of a few vertebras in 4 patients, who had both negative radiographic and PET-TAC findings. Twenty-one patients had a restaging after induction chemotherapy (3) or after ASCT (18). Out of 16 responsive patients, 9 had positive PET-CT scans at diagnosis: 5 showed a significant reduction of the number and the extension of the sites of abnormal uptake after therapy and 4 patients, who obtained a complete remission (negative serum immunofixation) after ASCT, achieved a negative PET-CT scan. We conclude that in our series of newly diagnosed MM PET-CT could identify additional sites of diseases to skeletal survey or MR in 5/25 (20%) of the patients. In other 4/15 patients (16%) whole spine MR could identify minimal involvement of single vertebras, that were not recognized by PET-CT and skeletal survey. Moreover, all the 9 patients with pre-treatment positive PET -CT scans showed a reduction (5) or a disappearance (4) of the sites of abnormal uptake after therapy, that correlated with clinical response.",

This disease can be cured by conventional allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) with high transplant-related mortality (TRM). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens followed by re-infusion of allogeneic stem cells have been proposed to reduce the TRM and keep a graft-versusmyeloma (GVM) effect. However, this technique is hampered by important rates of relapse and the monitoring of chimerism status is of help to modulate the immunosuppressive regimen and thus, the GVM effect by allogeneic effector cells. To date, STR chimerism status was followed-up in total peripheral blood (PB) or total BM cells after transplantation but these methods failed to detect early relapses. In order to improve the follow-up, we have used a BM CD138+ cell enrichment technique combined to real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) to assess the chimerism status of such cells after allo-SCT. Fourty-two samples from 17 MM patients (pts) have been analysed from 72 days to 4 years after conventional (1) or RIC allo-SCT (16 pts). Samples were analysed from BM using a CD138 cell purification technique (Miltenyi Biotec\u00ae). DNA was extracted and RQ-PCR was performed as previously described by Alizadeh. Mixed Chimerism (MC) was defined as the presence of 0.2% recipient cells (RC). The purity of CD138+ after enrichment was on average 19.6% (1.34-93 .5) on all BM samples. For all 17 pts, at least once, while total BM cell chimerism was total donor (TD), CD138+ assessment detected RC (3.2-8.6%) at 2 years post-allo SCT. Three pts exhibited increased CD138+ RC few weeks prior to clinical relapse ( Figure 1 ). In other 3 pts, the impact of therapeutic measures (DLI, immunosuppressive modulation, bortezomib) was closely correlated to variations of CD138+ chimerism status. A stable CD138+ MC with constant levels of serum paraprotein demonstrated the absence of significant relapse in one patient.",

Results: Renal excretion was determined to be a major mechanism of clearance for AMD3100, with 60 % of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine of volunteers with normal renal function over 24 hours post administration. Pharmacokinetic characteristics for volunteers with either no, mild, or severe RI are summarized in Table 1 . Compared to volunteers with normal renal function (CLcr > 90 ml/min), AUC0-24 increased 40 % in volunteers with moderate RI (CLcr = 31-50 ml/min) and 37 % in those with severe RI (CLCR < 31 ml/min). Half-life increased from 4.9 hours in volunteers with normal renal function, to 11.6, and 17.3 hours in those with moderate and severe RI respectively. Renal clearance of AMD3100 decreased from 40.3 ml/min in volunteers with normal renal function, to 15.3 and 5.0 ml/min in those with moderate and severe RI respectively. Conclusions: The increase of T1/2 in pts with RI is consistent with renal excretion being a major clearance mechanism for AMD3100. As the effect of RI on systemic exposure to AMD3100 was < 50% increase in AUC, utilization of AMD3100 for stem cell mobilization at the 240 ug/kg dose in MM pts with RI is feasible.",

However, high relapse rates suggest that molecular remissions are not complete. Thus, the follow-up of MRD after Allo-SCT is a major prognostic factor, particularly in the RIC setting. The careful monitoring of BM plasma cell (CD138+) chimerism should allow us to detect patients (pts) at high-risk of clinical relapse and lead to therapeutic intervention. In this study, we analysed the CD138+ chimerism kinetics by RQ-PCR in 13 MM pts that underwent RIC Allo-SCT in our center recently, and determined its utility in predicting relapse/progression over conventional follow-up parameters (Total BM and PB CD3+ chimerism, paraprotein analysis). Mixed chimerism was defined as the persistence of 0.2% of recipient cells. Median age was 51 (35-61) years with 10 M and 3 F. All pts were in stage III (9 A, 4 B) at diagnosis with 8 IgG, 3 IgA, 2 light chains. Ten pts had 2 lines and 3 one, prior to Allo-SCT; all had recieved autologous PBSCT (11, 1 and 2, 2). At Allo-SCT 11 pts were in PR and 2 in CR. Conditionings were Flu-Bu-ATG for 8 and Flu-TBI for 5. Stem cell source was PBSC for 12 and BM+PBSC for 1, GVHD prophylaxis consisted in 9 Ciclo alone, combined to MMF in 4. Eight pts developed aGVHD (3 pts>II) and 6 a cGVHD (5 extensive). Median follow-up was 21 (4-64) Mo. A the last follow-up 11 pts were alive with 8 in relapse. A median of 2.9 (range 2-6) BM samples were analysed/pt from 2 to 55 Mo. post-tranplant. After BM CD138+ magnetic purification, purity was 26.5 (4-93.5)%. In 3 pts, while total BM and PB CD3+ chimerism remained total donor, a decrease in CD138+ donor chimerism with time was observed and correlated with a BM and (+extra-medullar in 2) relapse, whereas immunofixation remained persistently negative for 2 of them ( Figure 1 ). In all relapsed pts, median time prediction to clinical progression was 3 (3-4) Mo. In 4 relapsed pts, a progressive CD138+ increasing donor chimerism was correlated with a clinical response after post-transplant retreatment (all with Bortezomib). In 2 pts a Graft Versus MM effect was shown with increasing CD138+ donor chimerism while immunosuppression was withdrawn. These preliminary data suggest that the follow-up of BM CD138+ donor chimerism after RIC Allo-SCT is a useful tool to monitor disease response/resistance and drive quick therapeutic intervention, and maybe improve the results of RIC Allo-SCT in MM.",

We report results of 408 patients (pts) with MM after ASCT from the Czech Transplant Registry. The data from 6 transplant centers were analysed with aims to evaluate outcomes of ASCT and to detect significant prognostic parameters. Methods: We have retrospectively evaluated 408 pts with MM undergoing ASCT between 1994 and 2005, median follow up from ASCT is 33 months, range 1-117 months. Subgroup of 44 pts was more than 10 years from ASCT. At diagnosis, 32 pts (8%) had stage I according to Durie-Salmon (DS), 117 pts (29%) stage II and 259 pts (63%) stage III. The median age was 56 years. Most of pts (83%) were transplanted to one year from diagnosis. One transplant was performed at 229 pts (56%), 2 or more transplants at 179 pts (44%). Results: Following ASCT, 94 pts (23%) were in complete remission (CR). The median progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survivals were 27.5 and 62.3 months, respectively. Significant prognostic parameters for poor survival were: clinical stage III according to DS (p = 0.005), IgA type of monoclonal immunoglobulin (p = 0.003), renal impairment with serum creatinine at diagnosis above 2mg/dl (p under 0.001), no achievement of CR after ASCT (p under 0.001). Correlation between PFS and OS was found, pts with PFS under 30 months had significantly shorter OS than others (p under 0.001). Patients with progression of MM to one year after transplant had very poor prognosis, median PFS of this subgroup was 7.3 months only and median OS was 21.6 months. Long-term outcomes of ASCT were evaluated in subgroup of 44 pts, who had been transplanted before 1997: 12 pts (27%) are alive, only 4 pts (8%) are disease free. The status of disease before ASCT, age, number of transplants (1 versus 2), time from diagnosis to transplant did not significantly affect OS after ASCT. Conclusion: In our group of pts the survival after ASCT correlated with clinical response after transplant (CR versus non CR), stage according to DS (III versus I+II), type of paraprotein (IgA versus others) and renal impairment at diagnosis. The most significant parameters for better survival of MM pts after transplant are: no presence of renal impairment at diagnosis and achievement of CR after transplantation.

Twenty-one pts were treated with autografting followed by reduced intensity conditioning allotransplantation. All these patients received HD Melphalan (200 mg/mq) followed by autologous PB-SCT. After a median of 90 days, the pts underwent RICT (Fludarabine + 2 Gy TBI). Acute GVhD prophylaxis consisted of MM and cyclosporine. Chimerism analysis was performed using STR-PCR and donor engraftment was evaluated at day +15,+30,+45,+60,+90 on unfractionated BM cells. All pts received a HLA identical donor mobilized PBSC and the graft contained a median of 3,3 x 10E6 (range 1-6,8) CD34+ cells/kg body weight. After RICT, on day +15, 3 (13%) pts showed a complete donor chimerism; on day +90, 21 (90%) showed a complete donor chimerism; two pts with mixed chimerism received a DLI on day +30 and one of these achieved full donor chimerism. Six pts received a conventional hematopoietic SCT. All patients showed a complete donor chimerism at the time of engraftment. Results: For RICT pts grade I-II and III acute GVHD occurred in 5 (22%) and 1 (4%) pts respectively. Five patients (22%) developed a mild and 4 (19%) an extensive chronic GVHD.

Instead the pts that received a myeloablative conditioning regimen, grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 3 patient and one of these died for aGVHD. All pts developed mild chronic GVHD. Two patients relapsed and died. To date, 3 patients are alive and are in CCR at + 37 and +13 and +12 months. No patients died after RICT. Pancytopenia after RICT was minimal and sustained allogeneic stem cell engraftment occurred in 90% of patients. A good correlation between GVHD, full chimerism and remission was found.",

Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)is an effective standard treatment for MM patients and previous data showed that it is feasible also in elderly patients. A program of ASCT with early discharge in elderly patients with MM was started in December 2001 at our department with the following inclusion criteria: age 60-75 years (y), performance status 0-1 (WHO), absence of severe comorbidities, availability of a caregiver, estimated current time to reach the transplant centre no more than 40 minutes and good compliance to homing therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled: 17 male and 10 female with a median age of 65 y (range 60-74); 48% patients were over 65 y and 11% over 70 y; all of them were analysed according to the intention criteria to perform an early discharge within 24 hours post stem cells reinfusion, with clinical and laboratory surveillance 3 times a week until the complete haematological recovery. The conditioning regimen was high dose Melphalan (200 mg/mq) with previous infusion of Amifostine 750 mg; 13 patients transplanted until 2004 received the combination of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 gamma/die s.c. plus erytropoietin 10000 UI/die s.c. starting from day +1 until the complete haematological reconstitution; the others received pegylated G-CSF 1 fl s.c. and darbepoietin 500 mcg 1 fl s.c. at the day +1. The median of CD34+ x 10 6 /kg cells reinfused was 6 (range 1-10.9) and a speed engraftment was observed in all patients with a median of 10 days (range 8-15) for absolute neutrophil count >500/mcl and 12 days (range 9-27) for platelets > 20000/mcl. The median of transfusion requirement was 0 and 1 for red cell and platelets units, respectively. Severe mucositis (grade 3-4 WHO) was observed in only two patients (7%) and neutropenic fever (> 38\u00b0C) in four (14%) with a consequent second hospitalization in these six patients (22 % of all the transplants); transplant-related mortality at day +90 was 0. Our preliminary data suggest that ASCT with early discharge is feasible in elderly patients with MM with a speed engraftment, very low transfusion requirement and negligible severe extrahaematological toxicity.",

Not complete response (near CR, partial remission, minimal response, stabilization disease) was received in 12 (57%) patients with CG genotype, 7 (64%) patients with CC genotype and in none of the patients with GG genotype. 6 patients after VAD therapy received autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (APSCT). 3 patients with CG genotype after APSCT stayed alive during 3 years. 3 patients with other genotypes had relapse and died. 13 patients with multiple myeloma after ineffective VAD therapy as second line therapy received treatment by velcade (bortezomib) 1,3 mg/m 2 at 1, 4, 8, 11 days and dexametazone 20 mg at 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 days every over 10 days. Patients received 8 such courses. 6 (46%) patients reached CR, 1(8%) patient -near CR, 2 (15%) -partial remission, 2 (15%) -stable disease, 2 (15%) -progression disease. Efficacy of velcade was not dependent on G+647C polymorphisms of glucocorticoid receptor gene (2 intron). Preliminary results may indicate the greater efficacy of VAD therapy in patients with CG genotype, that should be taken into consideration in pretransplant preparing of patients with multiple myeloma.

Sierra Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, E) Objective: To analyze the tolerance and effectiveness of an autologous stem cell transplantation procedure(ASCT) in patients(pts) with myeloma(MM) 65 years. Patients and methods: From a total number of 191 ASCT for MM performed in our center from June'1991 to June'2006, 35 of them(18%) have been performed in pts 65 years.There are 22 males with a median age at diagnosis of 66(range,59-71) yrs and at ASCT of 68(range,65-72)yrs.Twenty pts(57%) presented with stage III at diagnosis and 7 pts(20%) had renal function impairment.The induction therapy consisted of alternating cycles of VBCMP/VBAD in 31 pts(88%),2 pts received the VAD protocol(6%) and the remaining 2 pts(6%) received alternating cycles of bortezomib plus dexametasone.Median time from diagnosis to ASCT was of 11 months.Seven pts(20%) were autografted in complete remission(CR) with IF-, 24 pts(68%) in partial remission(PR), 2 pts(6%) with minimal response and 2 pts(6%) with progressive disease. Conditioning regimen consisted of highdose melphalan (200mg/m\u00b2 iv) in 30 pts (86%),melphalan plus oral busulfan in 3 pts (8%), mephalan plus TBI in 1 patient (3%) and BEAM in the remaining patient.The median number of CD34+ cells x106/Kg infused was 4.2(range, 1.7-7.4 ). G-CSF(5ug/kg/day,sc) was administered in all cases from day +7 after ASCT to neutrophil recovery. Results: Thirty-four pts(97%) engrafted with a median time of neutrophil engraftment(>0.5x109/l) of 12 days (range,9-18) ,platelet recovery was also fast and complete.One patient did not engraft due to early transplant related mortality (TRM).Grade III gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in 3 (8%) pts and gIII/IV oral mucositis in 7(20%) pts. Febrile neutropenia was present in 88% of the pts analyzed(n=31).Two pts(6%) died from transplant-related causes before day +100 after ASCT.Late TRM(>100 days after ASCT) was 0%. Overall disease response at 3 months after ASCT was 43% with 5 pts(14%) achieving a CR (with negative IF) and 7 pts(20%) achieving a PR. Nine patients (26%) received a 2nd ASCT at a median time of 6(range,4-9) months from the first one.Early and late TRM after this 2nd autologous procedure was 0% in both instances.None of these patients achieved a CR after the 2nd ASCT.2-years overall survival for the whole series is 71%\u00b17%. Conclusions: ASCT can be considered a therapeutic option in elderly pts with symptomatic MM.Early and late TRM as well as response rate after ASCT are similar to what is seen in younger pts with this disease.",

Patients and methods: There were 4 males with a median age at diagnosis of 51(range,43-63)yrs. Eight pts received a previous autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), 7 of them as a part of a tandem procedure (ASCT+RIC-Allo), and 1 patient received two prior ASCT. Median time between diagnosis and RIC-Allo was 15(range,12-69) mo. Three pts(33%) were allografted in partial remission(PR), 2 patients(22%) in stable disease(SD) and 4 patients(44%) in progressive disease(PD). The conditioning regimen was iv fludarabine 150 mg/m\u00b2 plus melphalan 70mg/m\u00b2. Graft-versushost-disease prophylaxis consisted of ciclosporine A plus mycofenolate mofetil. BTZ was administered alone as a 21day cycle (1.3 mg/m2 iv on days +1,+4,+8 and +11). One patient was treated with the combination of bortezomib and dexametasone. Results. BTZ was started 29(6-68) mo [median (range)] from the RIC-Allo. Seven pts(77%) presented with PD before BTZ, 1 patient(11%) with PR and 1 patient(11%) with SD. The median number of cycles of BTZ was 4(range,2-8). Severe grade III/IV thrombocytopenia was observed in 1 patient(11%) and grade IV neutropenia in another patient. Grade II neuropathy was observed in 2 patients(22%) and grade III neuropathy in 1 patient(11%). Grade II gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in 2 patients(22%) and 1 patient(11%) had a hepatitis B virus reactivation. One patient had to stop therapy because of grade III neuropathy and 1 patient because of grade IV thrombocytopenia. The response rate(RR) was 66%(CR, n=2; PR,n=4) after a median number of 4 cycles of BTZ. Median time to achieve the best response was 4.5(range,1.8-11) mo. Two patients(22%) progressed under BTZ and 1 patient remained in SD. After a median follow-up of 6 mo after finishing therapy, the RR is 55%(CR,n=2; PR, n=3), 3 patients present with PD and one patient has died from disease progression. Conclusion: BTZ is a feasible salvage therapy for MM pts progressing or relapsing after a RIC-Allo procedure. Toxicity profile is acceptable and overall RR high taking into account the bad prognosis of the pts included in the analysis.",

Kuliczkowski Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) Background: Gamma-delta T lymphocytes (gd) appear a immune response to acute lymphoblastic leukemia following allogenic BMT, resultating in improved relapse-free survival for those patients, who survive 100 days from transplant. Activated gd T cells express antigens CD25+ or CD69+ on their surface. Aim: Gamma-delta T-cell mean percentage (%) in peripheral blood in multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphoma malignum (NHL) patients treated megachemotherapy (mega-chmt) with autologous bone marrow transplantation. (auto-BMT) was investigated. Material and methods: 10 patients (pts): 6 MM and 4 NHL pts treated in Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation Wroclaw Medical University, Poland and 14 healthy controls were included into analysis. Among 6 MM pts 2 were in II, 3 in III stages, 1 pt was MM non-secretorius, according to Durie-Salomon classification. 4 pts were classifieled to A and 2 to B groups. Ammong 4 NHL pts 3 were in IVA and 1 pt in IVB stages according to Ann-Arbor classification. Blood samples were taken before and after mega-chmt + auto-BMT. gd T cells were estimated by flow-cytometry (FACS), using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs: TCRgamma1-FITC (Becton-Dickinson), CD14-RPE, CD45-FITC, CD25-RPE, CD69-RPE (DAKO) and IgG1kappa-FITC and IgG1-RPE as negative controls. Results: Mean % of total gd T lymphocytes in peripheral blood before mega-chmt+autoBMT was 1,72 of all MM and 3,63 of all NHL pts. It was lower than in control group 5,63%. In MM pts, after mega-chmt+auto-BMT,gd T cells mean % increased to 3,73, compared before treatment, but was also lower than in healthy volunteers. Similarly, after mega-chmt+auto-BMT in MM pts activated gd T CD25+ and gd T CD69+ cells mean % were higher than before transplantation (gd T CD25+: 0,36 vs 0,06 and gd T CD69+: 0,85 vs 0,35). Instead in NHL pts after mega-chmt+auto-BMT, dg T cells mean % decreased to 1,13, compared before treatment 3,63 and was lower than in healthy volunteers 5,63. After mega-chmt+auto-BMT in NHL pts activated gd T CD69+ cells mean % were lower than before treatment(0,16 vs 0,52), but gd t CD25+ cell mean% no changed. All MM and NHL pts (100 %) stayed in complete remission (RC) 6 months after mega-chmt+autoBMT. Conclusions: This study shows a favorable trend, that in MM pts the increase and in NHL pts the decrease of all gd T lymphocytes and activated gd T cells subpopulations in peripheral blood after mega-chmt+auto-BMT may be connected with normal immunological reconstruction after transplantation and can indicate better prognosis, because all of studies pts stayed in complete remission half a year after transplantation. Our studied patients group is small, so it needs a further examination.",

We report the results of ASCT used as upfront therapy in 71 pts with stage III (Durie-Salmon) MM autotransplanted between March 1997 and October 2006 in the two major BMT units in Lebanon. Median age was 49 years (29-70). There were 49 males and 22 females. Twelve pts (17%) were in stage IIIB. IgG, IgA and light chain were the most frequent types (58%, 21% and 17% respectively). Sixtysix pts (93%) received VAD protocol (3-6 cycles) and 4 pts (6%) received thalidomide + dexamethasone. Seventy pts received autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (APSCT). Cyclophosphamide (4-5g/m\u00b2) followed by G-CSF (10\u00b5g/kg/day) were given for peripheral stem cell mobilization. The median number of CD34 + cells collected was 10.24 x 106/kg (1.36-60) . High dose chemotherapy consisted of Melphalan which was given at a dose of 200mg/m\u00b2 in 60 pts (85%); the others received Melphalan at a dose of 140mg/m\u00b2. Fifty-nine pts (83%) underwent one ASCT and 12 pts (17%) underwent tandem ASCT. The median number of CD34 + cells transplanted was 5.79 x 106/kg (1.36-20) per transplant for the pts who underwent APSCT. Bisphosphonates were given IV to all pts for about 2 years after ASCT. Response was assessed according to the EBMT criteria (Blade J. et al, Br J Haematol, 1998 . 102: 1115 -1123 . Disease status before ASCT was as follows: 8 pts (11%) were refractory, 4 pts (6%) had minimal response, 54 pts (76%) had partial response and 5 pts (7%) were in complete remission (CR). Transplantationrelated mortality rate was 1.4%. Twenty-one pts (30%) were in CR after ASCT. Thirty-six pts (51%) who relapsed or progressed after ASCT received thalidomide \u00b1 dexamethasone (30 pts), a second ASCT (4 pts) and Velcade (2 pts). The median overall survival (OS) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) were 60 and 32 months respectively ( Figure 1 ). In conclusion, the feasibility of APSCT for MM in Lebanon was acceptable with an OS and PFS rates comparable to the EBMT registry.",

Chakraverty Royal Free Hospital (London, UK) The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of EBV viraemia and PTLD following SCT with CAMPATH-1H T-cell depletion (TCD, in vivo or 'in the bag') in adult patients (pts). We have previously shown that high doses of in vivo CAMPATH-1H (100mg) are cleared from the circulation more slowly that CAMPATH-1H (20mg) 'in the bag'. Weekly quantitative PCR for EBV DNA in peripheral blood was performed in 37 pts transplanted over an 18 months. 19 received a Cyclophosphamide-TBI-based conditioning (\u00b1 Fludarabine) with CAMPATH-1H 20mg 'in the bag' and 18 received conditioning with Fludarabine, Melphalan and CAMPATH-1H in vivo (FMC, CAMPATH-1H doses 100mg n=14, 40mg n=2, 30mg n=1, 20mg n=1). EBV viraemia was defined as >200 copies/ml. Pts with a viral load >40000 copies/ml had CT scans, bone marrow and CSF examination to exclude PTLD and were treated with one dose of rituximab (375/m2). Median patient age was 44 (range 15-67). Diagnoses were AML/MDS (21), Myelofibrosis (6), CLL (2), NHL (5), Hodgkin (3). Donors were matched/1 ag mismatched related (18), matched unrelated (8) and mismatched unrelated (11). 94% of pts were EBV seropositive. EBV serostatus was avaliable in 28/37 donors and 93% were positive. 38% of pts reactivated EBV over a median follow up time of 6mo (range 0.4-18). The incidence was 55.6% for FMC with in vivo CAMPATH-1H vs. 21% for myeloablative SCT with CAMPATH-1H 'in the bag' (p<0.05). Median time to EBV reactivation post SCT was 70 days (range 21-180). 9/10 of the pts who reactivated in the FMC group had received 100mg of CAMPATH-1H and 1 pt 20mg. At the time of EBV reactivation 13/14 pts were on immunosuppression, 3 had chronic GVHD but none had acute GVHD. None of the pts had symptoms or clinical findings related to EBV infection or PTLD. Median peak viral load was 14027 copies/ml (range 1000-2,352,829). 5/14 pts had a viral load > 40000 copies /ml and were fully staged with none of them showing evidence of PTLD, and subsequently treated with rituximab. Median duration of viraemia was 56 days (range 11-340). 4/9 nontreated pts remained intermittently positive on a low level for > 6 mo. All pts treated with Rituximab became EBV DNA negative rapidly (median 15 days). None of the pts studied developed PTLD. The incidence of EBV viraemia post-SCT is high following TCD with CAMPATH-1H, and significantly higher with in vivo CAMPATH-1H. Using a pre-emptive approach of rituximab for high levels of EBV viraemia, no patients developed PTLD.",

Whereas tetramer staining is sufficient to determine the frequency of antigen specific T cells, the assessment of their cytotoxic potential requires functional assays. Here, we have used the CD107a degranulation assay along with 8-color flowcytometry to determine ex-vivo T-cell degranulation after stimulation with CMV IE-1 and pp65 peptide pools in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT). Material and Methods: T cells from 6 healthy CMV exposed donors and 16 allotransplanted patients were stimulated with peptide pools representing the pp65 (UL83) and IE-1 (UL123) proteins. T-cell activation was determined by intracellular staining for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-2. Activated Tcells were assessed for CD107a expression as a measure of degranulation. Results: A specific CD8+ T cell response against pp65 was observed in 6/6, against IE-1 in 5/6 healthy donors and in 11/16 and 9/16 allotransplanted patients, respectively. Healthy donors presented slightly higher numbers of effector type (CD3+/CD8+/CD28-) T cells against pp65 (77% vs. 61%) and IE-1 (87% vs. 65%). However, there was no difference between healthy donors and transplant recipients regarding the number of degranulating CD8 T-cells, neither in regards of pp65 (78% vs. 75%) nor in regards of IE-1 (74% vs. 75%). Also, there was no significant difference between healthy donors and patients in terms of cytokine production. Conclusion: We conclude, that pp65-as well as IE-1-specific T-cells are equally effective inducers of hCMV-specific T cell responses after allo SCT. Moreover there is no significant difference between healthy donors and allotransplanted patients concerning the percentage of specific effector T cells and, most importantly, the ability of pp65 or IE-1 induced degranulation of CMV-specific T cells. According to our data, the quality of CMV-specific T cell responses is not impaired in allotransplanted patients.In order to look into this matter further, the granule content will have to be examined.",

Methods: A research was performed in the eleven Spanish pediatrics centers in which SCT was applied from 1985 to 2005. All patients under 15 years of age who had received an allogeneic (n=1073) or autologous (n=1539) were included. Results: Five cases of MBI were diagnosed among the 1073 allogeneic SCT (0.47%). No cases of MBI were recorder in the autologous SCT recipients. Underlyng disease was ALL in four patients and hemophagocitic lymphohistiocytosis in 1.All recipients were considerer not at risk for MBI at pre-SCT visit and had not been vaccinated with BCG. The 5 patients had been transplanted from matched donors (3 related and 2 unrelated). The diagnosis was made at a median of 120 days after SCT (range 90 to 540 days). The mean time interval between the first symptoms attributable to MBI and diagnosis was 39 days. All patiens had a normal total neutrophil count at diagnosis of MBI. Lung was the organ involved in the 5 patients.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been increasingly associated to lower respiratory tract infection in HSCT recipients, with mortality rates up to 50% in some series. No data on the occurrence of HMPV infection in HSCT recipients has been reported in Brazil. Methods: HMPV was detected by PCR with primers complementary to the N region of HMPV genome. To determine HMPV group, amplified products were sequenced (Big-Dye, Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the software SeqMan (DNA-Star, ABI). limited. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and semi-nested PCR with primers complementary to RSV genes G e F were performed in samples that tested positive by IFA. PCR products were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing of Cterminal region of the gene G for typing (in group A or B) and genotyping (Peret et al, 1998) . Results: Of the seven strains analyzed from HSCT recipients during 2001, only two belonged to group B, the other five belonged to group A. Of these seven strains, three were identical and were from patients assisting the outpatient HSCT Unit. In 2002, of the nine strains analyzed, three belonged to group A and the other six belonged to group B. Five strains were identical and were also from the outpatient setting suggesting that nosocomial transmission in the Day-Hospital unit was more likely. Two strains isolated from 2001 were identical to two strains isolated Nosocomial transmission was more likely to occur at the HSCT Day-hospital as compared to the HSCT ward. Infection control practices should be also implemented at Day-hospital Units to avoid nosocomial transmission of RSV and other respiratory viruses in outpatient units.",

Particular Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types are implicated in the genesis of cervical cancer. No study has prospectively evaluated the occurrence of HPV infection, cytological alterations and the risk factors associated with progression to cervical cancer in HSCT recipients. Methods: Women admitted to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the BMT Unit of Amaral Carvalho Foundation in Ja\u00fa, SP, Brazil, were invited to participate in this prospective study. Gynecological examination and cervical samples were taken pre-transplant and at regular intervals thereafter (+90, +180, +365). Information about the use immunosuppressive drugs, GVHD, CD4 and CD* counts, sexual activity, menopause symptoms, etc, was prospectively taken in each visit. HPV was detected by PCR and HPV typing was performed by RFLP. Results: 30 women were enrolled in the study so far. Median age was 32 years, ranging from 15 to 50 years old. Twentytwo patients received an allogeneic graft (one mismatch, 21 full match) and the remaining 8 were autologous transplants. Underlying diseases (UD) were AML in 10, CML in 8, MM in 4, HD in 3, and other in 5 patients. The median time from diagnosis of UD to transplant was 222.5 (46 -4497) days. HPV was detected in 6 patients (20%) pre-HSCT. HPV types were 51, 59 (in two patients), 33, 45 and 16. Types 16 and 45 are considered of high risk for the development of neoplasia. Six of the 30 patients (20%)died during follow-up. The remaining 24 patients have been followed-up for a median of 150 days. Five of the 6 patients with HPV positive cervical samples pre-transplant remained so (with same HPV type) in consecutive samples tested. Conclusions: Prevalence of HPV infection pre transplant was 20%. HPV (same types) tend to persist months after HSCT. In the present series two patients were identified with HPV types considered of high risk for the development of neoplasia.",

Aoun, P. Lewalle, N. Meuleman, P. Martiat, D. Bron Institut Jules Bordet (Brussels, B) Background: Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (EBV-R) occurs in up to 50% of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) patients (pts) and can lead to a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) which is a rare (<5% HSCT) but lifethreatening complication. The main risk factor for PTLD is T-cell depletion but predictive markers for PTLD development after EBV-R are unknown. Preemptive therapy (PT) with anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (RTX) has shown efficacy in abrogating PTLD-related mortality, but indications and duration of PT remain unknown. Methods: From 08/2000 to 09/2006, pts undergoing alloHSCT were monitored weekly for EBV-R by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on peripheral blood mononucleated cells. The criteria for PT with RTX were 2 consecutive rising viral loads (VL) of 10,000 copies/mL or a single VL 40,000/mL. [12,480 -268,118] copies/mL at initiation of RTX. PT was started after a median of 6.5 days of PCR result [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Median number of weekly cycles of PT was 3 [1] [2] [3] [4] . 17 (89%) patients had sustained normal VL after PT. 1 pt presented a serious adverse reaction to RTX that was discontinued. He developed PTLD and died from aGVHD. 7 pts (37%) had a normal VL after a single cycle of RTX. In the 2 pts who received 4 cycles, one had responded to the first cycle and the other died from aGVHD before PCR negativity. Conclusion: Our observations confirm that PT with RTX is an effective strategy to prevent PTLD in HSCT. All pts should be monitored weekly for EBV-R until withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. Increased VL should be treated with RTX and duration of therapy can be tailored weekly to minimize costs and side effects. This attitude deserves to be further confirmed in prospective trials. Objective: Antifungal prophylaxis with azoles is effective in decreasing the frequency of invasive fungal infections in highrisk patients with hematologic malignancies including stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. However, there is concern that prophylaxis may increase the frequency of non-albicans Candida species and promote azole resistance. This study evaluated Candida colonization and azole susceptibility during 2 clinical trials comparing posaconazole (POS), fluconazole (FLU), and itraconazole (ITZ) for prophylaxis. Methods: Colonization and susceptibility were assessed in 2 large studies (N=600 and N=602) comparing POS vs. FLU or ITZ for prophylaxis in SCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease or patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing induction chemotherapy. Samples from mouth, throat, urine, and stool were collected. Breakthrough infections were matched to colonization data. Results: Some species transitions were noted upon comparing isolates at baseline and during days 29-42 of prophylaxis: C. albicans decreased from 31% (165/534) to 6% (13/221) on POS, 28% (132/473) to 9% (16/174) on FLU; C. glabrata increased from 6% (32/534) to 9% (19/221) on POS, 7% (32/473) to 8% (14/174) on FLU; C. krusei changed from 3% (17/534) to <1% (1/221) on POS, 3% (12/473) to 5% (8/174) on FLU. For subjects with the same species at baseline and end of treatment a > 4-fold minimum inhibitory concentration increase in any azole was observed in: C. albicans, 2/25 and 4/26 POS and FLU patients, respectively, and C. glabrata, 9/20 and 5/12 POS and FLU patients, respectively. Breakthrough infections by colonizing Candida species occurred while on study drug in 2 POS (2 C. glabrata) and 2 FLU (C. albicans and C. krusei) patients and 3 POS (2 C. glabrata and 1 C. krusei) and 4 FLU (4 C. glabrata) patients after removal of the study drug Conclusion: Species transition and decreased susceptibility to azoles were infrequent. C. glabrata was the colonizing organism most frequently associated with infections during and after azole prophylaxis.",

Stadler, C. Barkam, E. Dammann, L. Hoy, S. Buchholz, B. Hertenstein, J. Krauter, M. Eder, A. Ganser Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) Background: Valganciclovir (VGC), an orally available prodrug of ganciclovir (GCV), has been shown to effectively clear CMV viraemia in several smaller studies of patients treated preemptively for CMV reactivation after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), without significant early toxicity observed. Since VGC obviates hospitalisation, it is increasingly being adopted, although not licensed, in allogeneic HSCT. Patients and methods: We evaluated efficacy and long-term safety of preemptive therapies for the first episode of CMV reactivation in all consecutive patients allotransplanted at our institution between 1996 and 2006. Among 164 patients treated for CMV viraemia, 76 received oral VGC (44 as first, second, or third line therapy, and 32 for oral maintenance after GCV, Foscarnet (FCN), or Cidofovir (CDF) treatment), while 88 were given GCV, FCN, or CDF, only. Despite the retrospective study design, both the VGC and the non-VGC group were comparable for demographic, disease-and transplant-related data such as gender, diagnosis, and donor type. In accordance with historical trends in HSCT, VGC patients were generally older and more of them had received reduced intensity conditioning, whereas less non-VGC patients had been taking haematotoxic or nephrotoxic comedication. Results: In both groups, the rate of CMV clearance was similar (VGC 74% vs. non-VGC 70%). As expected, hospitalisation for pre-emptive therapy was significantly lower in VGC-treated patients. Conversely, severe neutropenias (including two cases of agranulocytosis) occurred more frequently in the VGC group (18% vs. 8% in the non-VGC group), especially in patients with VGC maintenance therapy (22%), accounting for significantly increased subsequent rehospitalisation in the VGC group (mean, 7.7 days vs. 0.6 days for non-VGC patients). There was no difference between the groups in total hospitalisation requirement for both initial preemptive therapy and later treatment of complications. Conclusions: In our retrospective evaluation, the initial advantage of oral VGC for pre-emptive therapy of CMV reactivation after allogeneic HSCT was outbalanced by its long-term suppressive effect on granulopoiesis. Our data further indicate that oral VGC maintenance after CMV clearance may carry serious risks, especially when used with haematotoxic comedication. Further, prospective studies on long-term safety of VGC in patients after allogeneic HSCT seem warranted. (1) Patients and methods: A total of 269 consecutive HSCT cases were retrospectively analysed. Virus shedding (VSh) had been monitored by detection of BKV-infected epithelial cells in the urine using direct immunofluorescence method (DIF). Our objective was to find some (if any) correlation between certain variables (age, sex, conditioning regimen, relation between donor and recipient /RDR/, graft-versus-host disease /GvHD/) and VSh intensity (ratio of infected cells in urine sample: ICR). Relation between the above mentioned variables and the degree of HC was also analyzed. Furthermore, relation between ICR and the degree of HC was examined and, finally, we mapped and correlated the seasonal changes of VSh to the prevalence of HC. Results: The diagnosis of post-transplant BKV infection was established in 31/269 (11,5%) cases. Symptoms of HC were present in 27 cases while in the remaining 4 cases only symptomless VSh was registered. There were 116 DIF-tests performed on the materials of our 31 cases. Significant correlation (p 0.05) was found to the ratio of positive DIF-results with respect to age (children>adults) and GvHD (GvHD>no GvHD). ICR and RDR were also significantly related (more intensive VSh in case of unrelated donor). The degree of HC only correlated significantly with ICR. We also found two peaks on the trend line of the monthly ratio of positive DIF-results (December/March) followed by corresponding peaks of the prevalence of HC (February/May). Conclusions: Our results indicate that post-transplant BKV shedding is more frequent in children and patients with GvHD; VSh is more intensive in patients with unrelated donors; HC is more severe in the case of high ICR values and, finally, VSh and the prevalence of HC show corresponding seasonal patterns with peaks in the winter and in the spring.",

CC-chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) and CXC receptor-4 (CXCR4) are known to be involved in perpetuation of HIV infection (as co-receptors for HIV entry). The clinical course of this infection is favored by the presence of the 32-nucleotide deletion within the CCR5 gene (CCR5-Delta32) and A at the -801 position within the 3'UTR of the stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) encoding gene. SDF-1 is a CXCR4 ligand. The CCR5 deletion mutation results in a nonfunctional chemokine receptor. The effects of the SDF-1-3'A on HIV infection and AIDS progression have been attributed to the altered amount of SDF-1. In the present study the CCR5-Delta32 polymorphism and the A/G substitution within the SDF-1 gene were analyzed in 76 HSCT donor-recipient pairs and related with EBV load. Viral load were assessed 2-3 months after transplantation in blood cells employing a real-time PCR technique. The detection threshold for viral reactivation equaled 10 EBV-DNA copies/10 5 cells. EBV reactivation was apparent in 27 patients. The CCR5-Delta32 and SDF-1 (-801 G/A) polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR and PCR-RFLP technique, respectively. Distributions of CCR5 and SDF-1 genotypes were similar in patients and donors. The higher number of EBV copies were detected in patients lacking CCR5-Delta32 deletion (0.42 vs 0.13, p=0.026) No association was found for the donor CCR5 polymorphism. No significant correlation was observed between EBV reactivation and the presence of the SDF-1-3'A allele either in recipients or donors of HSCT. In conclusion, the susceptibility for EBV reactivation appeared to be associated with the recipient CCR5-Delta32 allele, but not with the SDF-1 polymorphism. The latter one might be explain by the lack of evidence for the contribution of the SDF-1 (-801 A/G) polymorphism to the amount of the SDF-1 mRNA in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells. These results suggest (in opposite to HIV infection) the involvement of CXCR4 independent mechanisms in EBV reactivation.

Number of copies from 10 to 99 and that equal or higher than 100 per 10 5 cells were recognized as positive and highly positive (severe load), respectively. MUD transplanted pts had significantly higher number of CMV copies than those receiving sibling transplantation (mean\u00b1sem: 914\u00b1243 vs 91\u00b138 CMV DNA copies/10 5 cells, p=0.008, Mann-Whitney U test (U MW test)). Patients with aGvHD grades II and/or extensive cGvHD had higher number of CMV copies than those who lacked or had only grade I aGvHD or limited cGvHD (612\u00b1207 vs 451\u00b1161 CMV copies/10 5 cells, p=0.025, U MW test). Only 2 out of 14 pts receiving Campath in comparison to 25 out of 43 pts on ATG and to 6 out of 15 pts not receiving antilymphocyte antibodies as a part of conditioning regimen had aGvHD grades II and/or extensive cGvHD (chi square=8.44, p<0.025). The use of Campath reduced the risk of aGvHD but was associated with a higher incidence of severe CMV load as compared to pts not receiving anti-lymphocyte antibodies (448\u00b1262 vs 25\u00b120 CMV copies/10 5 cells, p=0.004, U MW test). The pts with a fatal outcome of HSCT had a higher frequency of severe CMV load as compared to the group of pts enjoying long term survival (12/20 vs 14/52, p=0.010, Fisher's exact test). 18 pts were followed from day 11 to 2 yrs post transplant for a percentage of CD8high+ PRO5 pentamer HLA-A*0201/NLVPMVATV (CMV pp65)+ cells. It was found that proportion of this pentamer staining positive cells was significantly lower in pts post HSCT at the time of CMV reactivation as compared to staining results at observation points when pts lacked CMV DNA copies (0.30\u00b10.06 vs 0.77\u00b10.19%, p=0.008, U MW test). From the latter observation it was also apparent that proportion of CMV pentamers lower than 0.30% in lymphocytes gate is highly predictive of CMV reactivation. This study shows that higher risk of CMV reactivation associates with: (i) MUD donor transplantation, (ii) the presence of sever acute or extensive GvHD (iii) the use of Campath for conditioning and more specifically with a low proportion of CMV specific C8+ cells. The latter measurement may provide an argument to implement anti-CMV pre-emptive treatment. This work was supported by FP6 grant AlloStem.",

Jaskula (1) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is a serious complication affecting the recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). IFN-gamma is an important antiviral factor and polymorphism within the IFNG gene is associated with expression of this gene and protein production and also with the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Our former studies also showed that the presence of the IFNG 3/3 low producer genotype in the patients was associated with a lower susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. In the present study IFNG polymorphic features were related with CMV load. Sixty seven patients (30 HLA-matched sibling and 37 matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant recipients) were analyzed for microsatellite polymorphism (CA)n within the first intron of the IFNG gene by PCR-STR technique and for CMV DNA copies with the use of a real-time PCR. Number of CMV DNA copies in peripheral blood cells were determined in patients within the observation period ranging from day 7 to 100 post HSCT with 5 measurements per patients in an average. A higher number of CMV copies were detected in patients having the IFNG 3/3 low producer genotype in comparison to the recipients with other IFNG genotypes (mean\u00b1sem: 1044\u00b1405 vs 448\u00b1148 CMV copies/10 5 cells, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test (U MW test)).

This observation was also valid when the patients were divided into groups: (i) receiving reduced intensive conditioning regimen (1229\u00b1475 vs 550\u00b1257 CMV copies/10 5 cells, p<0.001 U MW test); (ii) receiving Campath (1124\u00b1641 vs 71\u00b171, p=0.013, U MW test) or (iii) ATG (1079\u00b1550 vs 556\u00b1268, p=0.035, U MW test).

Pts characteristics are as follow: median age: 50 (18-68)y. 68 pts (43%) had a myeloid malignancy, whereas 66 (41%) had a lymphoid malignancy. 25 pts (16%) had a metastatic non-hematological malignancies. 24 pts (15%) received bone marrow (BM), while 135 pts (85%) received PBSCs. In addition to fludarabine and busulfan, the RIC regimen included high dose ATG in 20 pts (13%) and low dose ATG in 95 (60%). 24 pts (15%) received fludarabine, busulfan and TLI, while the remaining 24 pts (15%) received fludarabine and low dose TBI. With a median FU of 19 (range,6-90) m., 120 pts (75%) experienced at least one infectious episode (total, 366) beyond the first 6 months after allo-SCT, at a median of 8 (range,6-34) m. 212 infectious episodes (58%) required hospitalization (7% in the ICU) for a median duration of 10 (1-91)d. 144 episodes (39%) could be documented (bacterial,n=48;viral,n=78; fungal,n=18) . Documented infections were: gram negative bacteria (18%), other bacteria (15%), CMV positive antigenemia (17%), HSV (19%), VZV (15%), other viruses (3%), aspergillus (6%), candida species (6%), other (1%). 76% of pts with an infection were under systemic immunosuppressive therapy for chronic GVHD at time of infection. Moreover, 85 pts (71%) experienced more than one infectious episode (median,2;range,1-12). In multivariate analysis, active or prior history of extensive chronic GVHD and the use of a BM graft were the strongest factors significantly associated with an increased risk of long term infections (P=0.0003;RR=2.04;95%CI,1.4-3.0; and P=0.005;RR=2;95%CI,1.2-3.2 respectively), highlighting the raising concern about the deleterious impact of severe chronic GVHD occurring after RIC allo-SCT, but also the protective effect of donor origin immunity based on graft content. In this series, the overall long term TRM was 11% (n=18), of whom 12 deaths were attributed to chronic GVHD and its complications including infections, and 5 deaths solely attributed to infections. In all, these results suggest that, despite reduction in early toxicity associated with the use of RIC regimens, long term debilitating chronic GVHD and its corollary of continuous immunosuppression and subsequent infections are still a matter of concern. Prospective efforts to develop optimal antimicrobial preventive strategies are needed.",

Mohty Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Although promising results have been reported in regards to engraftment and early transplant-related toxicities, graftversus-host disease (GVHD) and its corollary of long-term detrimental immunosuppressive therapy and opportunistic infections, remain a matter of concern after RIC allo-SCT. We and others have previously shown that the use of high doses of steroids for GVHD treatment represent a major risk factor for long-term infections, with invasive aspergillosis (IA) being the principal cause of infectious-related mortality, suggesting that efforts are warranted to develop optimal antifungal preventive strategies in specific subgroup of patients after RIC allo-SCT. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility and tolerance of weekly prophylactic administration of once-weekly high-dose (7.5 mg/kg; Ambisome\u00ae) L-AmB therapy in 21 adult patients receiving high dose steroids (2 mg/Kg/day) for acute GVHD therapy after RIC allo-SCT. The median age of recipients was 51 (range, 18-70) years. Seven patients had a myeloid malignancy, whereas 11 patients were diagnosed with lymphoid malignancies. The remaining 3 patients were treated for metastatic non-hematological malignancies. In addition to multiple lines of previous chemotherapy, 10 patients from this study had received prior auto-SCT. A sustained ANC of more than 500/\u00ecL, was reached at a median of 19 (range, 6-28) days. Per protocol, all patients had acute GVHD (11 grade 2, 10 grade 3-4) occurring at a median of 42 (range, 12-84) days after allo-SCT. Patients received a median of 4 (range, 1-8) infusions of L-AmB. Seven patients (33%; 95%CI, 13-53%) discontinued taking the study drug due to study drug-related adverse events, including elevated serum creatinine (>1.5 times from baseline values; n=5), hypotension and pain (n=1), and chest pain and arrhythmia (n=1). The overall frequency of infusion-related reactions was 29% (n=6; 95%CI, 10-48%), but these reactions were always transient and relieved by stopping the infusion or administering paracetamol. With a median follow-up of 377 (range, 74-983) days, no deaths were attributed to fungal infections, although the study was not powered to assess efficacy. This safety data provide support for a prospective efficacy study of this prophylaxis strategy, because this approach may provide useful protection against fungal infections, and may help further improving the outcome of RIC or nonmyeloablative allo-SCT. (1) Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) has been reported in 3.6%-68% of patients given HSCT. Recently, its pathogenesis has been associated to infection or reactivation of polioma virus, especially BK virus. From September 2001 to March 2006, we analyzed prospectively 74 patients who underwent allo-HSCT to assess the 100-day incidence of HC and its association with BK infection as determined by PCR on blood and urine. They were 44 males and 30 females, with median age at transplant of 9.6 years (range 0.5-17); affected by malignant disease, 61 patients, or non-malignant disease, 13 patients. 16 of 74 patients developed 17 episodes of HC within day +100. The cumulative incidence of HC was 22% (C.I. 12-31). The median time from HSCT to HC was 35 days (range 6-56); and the median duration of HC was 11 days (range 1-44). HC was classified as grade I, II, III, IV in 4, 8, 4, and 1 patients respectively. After a median f-up of 1.2 years, range 0.1-4, HC patients, compared to non-HC patients, had a lower OS, 37% vs 54%, p 0.009; and a lower EFS, 38% vs 57%, p 0.017; though the 100-day TRM resulted similar, 6% vs 5%, p 0.9. BK virus on urine by PCR was detected in 14 of 16 HC episodes investigated; whilst BK was found on blood by PCR in 9 of 12 HC episodes tested. Weekly monitoring of all transplanted patients from January 2005 to March 2006 showed a significant association between at least 2 consecutive positive PCR for BK on blood or urine and HC, p 0.003 and < 0.001, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of quantitative BK-PCR results by ROC curve showed that a cut-off of 9 x 106 genomic copies/ml on urine had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 90% for HC; whilst a cut-off of 1 x 103 genomic copies/ml on blood had a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 93% for HC. In conclusion, BK viruria and BK viremia are significantly associated to HC in pediatric allo-HSCT patients; moreover, BK load on urine has an higher predictive value for HC than BK load on blood. Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and neutropenic patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are at high risk for the development of invasive fungal infections (IFI). In 2 large, comparative, clinical trials (N~1200), the azole posaconazole (POS) was evaluated vs fluconazole (FLU) or itraconazole for prophylaxis in these high-risk patients. The objective of this analysis was to investigate the relationship between POS pharmacokinetics and common adverse events identified in these trials. Methods: 301 HSCT recipients with graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (study 1) and 304 neutropenic AML or MDS (study 2) were randomized to receive oral POS 200 mg three times daily. POS average and maximum plasma concentrations (Cav and Cmax) were determined and their relationship to adverse events was analyzed. Results: POS plasma concentrations were available for 246 (study 1) and 215 (study 2) patients (table) . Although the mean Cav and Cmax differed between the 2 patient populations, the frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) was similar. Disorders of the gastrointestinal system were most commonly reported, including nausea (7%, 7%), vomiting (4%, 5%) and diarrhea (3%, 7%) for study 1, study 2, respectively. POS plasma levels were not associated with the incidence of AEs, including those involving the central nervous system, visual disturbances, and increases in liver enzymes. Overall, the safety and tolerability of POS were similar to that of FLU. Conclusion: POS prophylaxis was well tolerated in HSCT recipients with GVHD and neutropenic AML/MDS patients at high risk for development of an IFI. No association was found between POS plasma concentrations and AEs commonly related to azole therapy. P708 P2X7 receptor polymorphism and clinical outcomes in HLA-matched sibling allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation I. Kim, K.-H. Lee, K.-H. Kim, J.-W. Kim, J.-Y. Lee, D.-Y. Kim, B.-S. Kim, S.-Y. Oh, S.-W. Han, S.-Y. Kim, E.-K. Park, S.-M. Bang, S.-S. Yoon, J.-S. Lee, S. Park, B.K.K. Kim Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, KOR) The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is a key player in the processing and release of IL-1. To evaluate whether the A1513C polymorphism of P2X7R is related to allogeneic stem cell transplantation outcome, we performed association analysis between this polymorphism and clinical outcome in patients treated by HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation. Patients (n=152) with a malignancy or aplastic anemia underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation at a single institute. The frequencies of the A and C alleles in all 295 study subjects were 72% and 28%, respectively. Patient genotypes were; AA in 75, AC in 58, and CC in 12, and donor genotypes were AA in 74, AC in 70, and CC in 6. Overall survival was significantly shorter for recipients with the CC genotype than for those with the AA or AC genotypes (92 days for 1513CC vs. 821 days for 1513AA or 1513AC, P=.012), and for recipients from donors with the CC genotype than for recipients from donors with the AA or AC genotypes (63 days for 1513CC vs. 702 days for 1513AA or 1513AC, P=.024). Multivariate analyses, which included sex, age, transplant method (reduced intensity conditioning vs. conventional conditioning), stem cell source, risk group, and P2X7R recipient and donor genotype, identified a high-risk group (hazard ratio 3.25, 95% confidence interval 1.83~5.77) and a donor 1513CC genotype (hazard ratio 2.66, 95% confidence interval 1.02~6.91) as risk factors of a shorter survival. Microbiologically documented bacteremia occurred in 66.7% of recipients with the CC donor genotype and in 17.6% of recipients that received transplants of the AA or AC genotypes (P=0.014). We conclude that the A1513C polymorphism in the P2X7R gene is related to the occurrence of infections and survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Thus, the determination of this polymorphism may be helpful for the optimal selection of patients and donors.",

Chakrabarti, H. Buyck, S. Ball, L. O'Regan, P. Rice, J. Marsh St George's Hospital (London, UK) EBV-LPD is a serious and often fatal post-transplant complication which has a widely variable incidence depending on the several factors such as donor and recipient seropositivity, T cell depletion, use of serotherapy, steroids and GVHD. We reviewed the incidence of EBV-LPD in 89 patients (median age, 20 yrs, range 4-53) with acquired aplastic anaemia (AAA) receiving allogeneic transplantation from a related (n=69) or unrelated (n=20) donor between 1989 and 2006. 78 patients received conventional conditioning (CIC) with cyclophosphamide (200mg/kg) alongwith ATG or Campath, whilst 11 received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with fludarabine, reduced dose cyclophosphamide and Campath or ATG. The overall incidence of EBV-LPD was 5 % (4/89) with no cases diagnosed in those receiving an allograft for malignant diseases (n=57) or constitutional bone marrow failure syndromes (n=30) during the same period. There was no impact of age, gender, donor status, CMV seropositivity, GVHD and graft cell dose on the occurrence of LPD. There was no influence of serotherapy used in conditioning either, with 1/19 patients receiving ATG and 3/63 receiving Campath developing LPD. However, prior use of ATG as immunosuppressive therapy had a strong influence on development of LPD with an incidence of 11.3 \u00b15.3% (4/40), compared to none in those not exposed to ATG before transplantation (p=0.02). The incidence of LPD in those receiving RIC was 18.2 \u00b1 11% (2/11), compared to 2.9 \u00b1 2% (2/78) for those receiving CIC (p=0.02). Three patients survived with withdrawal of immunosuppression, DLI or DLI and rituximab. The lymphoproliferation was identified as that of host origin in all 3 patients evaluated. This is the first study on the incidence of LPD in AAA who unlike those with malignant diseases are not exposed to cytotoxic therapy prior to transplant, but are often exposed to anti-T cell therapy. Prior treatment with ALG and nonmyeloablative conditioning might play a role in preferential survival of residual B lymphocytes of host origin, creating a unique environment for host derived EBV-lymphoproliferation. Use of Campath at high doses might protect against EBV-LPD as previously reported, but reduced dose Campath does not seem to have a similar effect, at least in this group of patients. In conclusion, patients with AAA who have received prior treatment with ATG are likely to be at a higher risk of developing EBV-LPD, more so, in association with RIC. Introduction: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role for detecting conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns comprising fungal structures. Activation of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) as well as mobilization of antigen presenting cells is important for successful clearance of fungal infections. Here, the role of TLR2 and TLR4 for activation of PMNs and immature dendritic cells (iDCs) through Aspergillus fumigatus was analyzed. Material and Methods: Generation of iDCs was achieved by cultivating monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. PMNs were obtained from fresh blood. In blocking studies, cells were preincubated with anti-TLR2 and / or anti-TLR4 antibody before stimulation with Aspergillus fumigatus germinating conidia. For RNA interference (RNAi) experiments, iDCs were transfected with short-interfering RNA (siRNA) via electroporation and gene expression was controlled by quantitative real-time PCR. Oxidative burst of PMNs was induced after contact with Aspergillus or TLR2 ligand zymosan. Release of oxygen intermediates could be significantly reduced if PMNs were preincubated with anti-TLR2 antibody. Results: In contrast to monocytes, cytokine secretion (IL-12 and TNF-a) of iDCs was not altered if anti-TLR antibodies were used. To study the role of TLR2 and TLR4 more detailed, an RNAi system for iDCs was established to downregulate gene expression. Determination of siRNA transfection rate revealed an efficiency of about 85% and allowed significant downregulation of TLR2 and TLR4 (> 90%). In accordance to blocking studies, expression of IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-a was not reduced after TLR2 or TLR4 siRNA transfection and stimulation with Aspergillus. Conclusions: TLR2 plays an important role in the induction of the oxidative burst of PMNs whereas cytokine release of iDCs seems to be independent of TLR2 / TLR4 signalling. The established siRNA system allows the detection of receptors responsible for activation of iDCs.",

Nikiforakis Evangelismos Hospital (Athens, GR) A proportion of cases of hemorrhagic cystitis(HC) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are associated with infection from BKV. Supportive treatment is not sufficient for the relief of symptoms in many patients with BKV-associated HC. Cidofovir is an antiviral agent active against BKV but its experience in BKV-associated HC is anecdotal and the optimal dose schedule of the drug has not been determined. We administered weekly high-dose cidofovir in 5 patients for the treatment of 6 episodes of symptomatic BKV-associated HC, which were refractory to first-line therapy with hydration and continuous bladder irrigation. One patient was treated twice with cidofovir for 2 temporally separated episodes of HC, combined with papillary necrosis and ureteritis respectively. All 5 patients were males, aged 21-44 years and had received grafts from siblings (n=2), matched unrelated (n=1) or haploidentical (n=1) donors. The median time from transplantation to diagnosis of HC was 61.5 (26-303)days. In all cases the development of HC was associated with severe immunosuppression due to profound lymphopenia or treatment for GVHD. BKV-associated HC was confirmed by detection of BKV in the urine by real-time PCR (1.5 \u00d7 10 7 -5.5 \u00d7 10 9 copies/ml). In 2 episodes, the patients also developed BKV viremia (5.0-9.9 \u00d7 10\u00b3 copies/ml). The median time from the manifestation of symptoms to initiation of cidofovir was 12(range, 4-53) days. Cidofovir was started at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/week intravenously over 1 hour. Subsequent doses of 5 mg/kg were given at weekly intervals for a total of 4-6 doses. Oral probenecid and intravenous hydration were also administered. No patient developed renal toxicity. In 5 of the 6 cases, clinical improvement of patients was observed with a median time to response of 5 (range, 3-8) days and complete resolution of symptoms of HC was achieved in these 5 cases after 4 to 6 doses of cidofovir. BKV viral load was monitored weekly in urine and blood during therapy. Clinical responses did not correlate with a reduction in viral load in urine. Concurrent CMV infection needed no further treatment.",

None of the children at the time of diagnosis showed clinical signs of severe infection, mild diarrhea has appeared in two. In all children we have detected significant viral load in blood (1.8x10 3 -1.7x10 7 /ml), and also in stool (2,6x10 4 -4x10 10 /ml). In four with higher load we have started cidofovir (CDV) 1mg/kg/dose 3x weekly and hygiene-epidemiological (HE) regime of the transplant unit was even more restricted (restriction of contacts, gloves, etc.). After introduction of this regime no new infection with AdV was observed in next 4 months. We have documented the positive effect of CDV (prevention of further increase). Viral load in blood disappeared in three children, in two decreased. Reconstitution of immunity played crucial role in all cases. Two patients died 5.6 and 3.2 months after HSCT (severe GvHD in one, disseminated AdV infection and intracranial hemorrhage in one). In later patient samples from the autopsy were tested by PCR and we have detected AdV 31 in most of the organs. Because there was no change in type of transplants, supportive care, regime, etc. at our unit compare to previous period we assume that spreading of AdV on the unit reflected increased adenovirus infections observed in general population by National reference laboratory. At least in some of patients with AdV31 there is clear epidemiological connection and therefore it is obvious that the original source in them was the same. We have documented that strict HE regime is the efficient way how to prevent further spread of infection and CDV may be effective to control the infection at least in some patients.

Weissinger Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation contributes to morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Risk factors for the reactivation of CMV are the conditioning regimen and graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, like T-cell depletion of the graft, the development and the treatment of acute or chronic GvHD. In addition, transplantation of a CMV-seropositive recipient with cells a CMV-seronegative donor comprises a risk factor for recurrent reactivation of CMV. Since T-cells play an important role in the control of viral reactivation, we started to evaluate the number of CMV-specific T cells in our patient cohort after allogeneic HSCT. To improve understanding of reactivation and restoration of CMV-immunity, we established a FACS based assay for monitoring absolute numbers of CMV-reactive cytotoxic Tcells using MHC-I-Peptide-tetramers available for the major HLA class I groups. The available tetramers allow monitoring of about 63% of our patients. The screening interval for CMVepitope specific CD8+ T-cells was prior to HSCT and on days +50, +80, +100, + 180 and +365 or weekly at the time of CMV reactivation or increased immunosuppressive treatment due to development of GvHD. To date we have enrolled 27 patients in this screening. Of these, 12 CMV-seropositive recipients were transplanted from CMV-seronegative donors. Trends of CMV-specifiv T-cell reconstitution after HSCT are currently available for 9 patients. All patients with more than 10 CMV-specific T-cells per microliter blood experienced no CMV reactivation. Two of these patients were transplanted from seronegative donors. In both patients CMV-reactive T-cells (total of 13 to 59 cells per \u00b5l) were detected around day +50 and seem to provide protection against CMV ( Figure 1 ). Our data indicate that monitoring of CMV-specific T-cells is well suited to predict the risk of CMV-reactivation and/or protection against reactivation due to recipient/donor CMV-specific T-cells under certain conditions. Thus monitoring of the persistence or development of virus-specific T-cells after HSCT will lead to the detection of patients at risk for viral reactivation and may allow early detection of patients profiting from CMV-specific T-cell transfer.",

            "text": "Introduction: Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has remained a major cause of morbidity and mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). All antiviral drugs currently used for the treatment of CMV infection target the viral DNA polymerase, and are often limited by bone marrow and renal toxicity, low oral bioavailability, and the development of antiviral drug resistance. Recently, the non-toxic anti-malaria drug artesunate, has been shown to be a highly effective inhibitor of CMV in vitro and in an experimental animal model. Here, we describe the first clinical use of artesunate in the SCT setting. Case report: A 12 years old boy, with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy underwent a haploidentical SCT from his father with T cell depletion. Following this treatment, the patient developed CMV infection. He was treated with foscarnet because of severe myelosuppression precluding ganciclovir therapy with initial partial response. However his viral load subsequently increased during treatment. Foscarnet was discontinued. Treatment trials with cidofovir and ganciclovir, combined with two courses of high dose immunoglobulin were unsuccessful, and the CMV DNA load increased to 1.15 x10 6 copies/ml. At this point, all conventional anti-CMV drugs were discontinued, and oral treatment with artesunate (100 mg/d) was initiated on a compassionate basis. A dramatic decrease in viral load was noted with 2-, 3-, and 4-log reduction in viral load within 10, 21, and 28 days of artesunate therapy, respectively. No side effects were observed during a month of artesunate treatment. The patient had no rebound viremia during a 60 days follow up after completion of therapy. Conclusion: Artesunate proved to be a highly effective inhibitor of CMV replication in a high risk immune suppressed patient following mismatched SCT, and should be considered in similar cases of clinically drug-resistant CMV infection. A clinical trial of preemptive artesunate treatment in patients undergoing SCT is currently underway at our center. IB Resnick and MY Shapira contributed equally to this report.

Pagliuca, G.J. Mufti Kings College Hospital (London, UK) Adenovirus(Adv) infections are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic HSCT. We retrospectively analysed the incidence, risk factors and outcome of symptomatic adenovirus infection among allogeneic HSCT recipients at a single UK centre from Jan 2003 to May 2005. All patients were screened twice weekly for a minimum of 6 months for the presence of Adv in the peripheral blood by DNA-PCR. A total of 183 patients received an allogeneic HSCT during the study period, of which 13 patients(7%) developed Adv infection. The median age of recipients developing Adv was 44 years(range:18-62). 12/13 patients(92%) received alemtuzumab as part of their conditioning. 10 patients(76%) received RIC. 7 patients(53%) received stem cells from a matched unrelated donor. The stem cell source was PBSC in 8 patients(61%). The median time to initial Adv detection was 40 days post-HSCT(range:11-160). Adv was isolated in urine in 5/13 cases(38%), stool in 9/13(69%), peripheral blood in 10/13(76%), nasal pharyngeal aspiration(NPA) in 8/13(61%) and one patient had skin involvement. In 30%(4/13) Adv was isolated in four sites(blood, urine, stool and NPA) and mortality rate in this group was 100%. The major presenting symptoms at the time of diagnosis were diarrhoea(9/13), haematuria(4/13). 7 patients(53%) had GvHD at time of diagnosis. Severe lymphocytopenia(<0.3x109/L) at the time of first detection was noted in 80% of recipients, and 12/13 patients were in receipt of concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. 11/13 cases were treated with Cidofovir as first line treatment and 2/11 patients subsequently received alternative treatment with Forscanet(1), Ribavirin + adenovirus specific cytotoxic Tcell lymphocytes (1) . The overall mortality rate was 76%(10/13) and the median time to death after initial Adv detection was 23.5 days. All 10 patients who died had 2 or more organ failure, and 8/10 had viral infections including CMV(n=7), BK/JK virus(n=4),Others(n=2). The 3 surviving patients had Adv detected in the peripheral blood(2), and via NPA(1), and none developed end-organ damage. In a cohort of patients predominately receiving alemtuzumab as part of the conditioning regimen, we report a 7% incidence of Adv post-HSCT. Patients developing Adv were more likely to have concurrent GvHD and to be receiving immunosuppression. In addition prognosis was poorer in those patients who had multiple organ damage or disseminated infection (isolating Adv from 3 or more sites). (1) Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for significant mortality in myeloma patients where the humoral response is defective. In addition, protective immunity is lost following stem cell transplant. Immunisation with pneumococcal polysaccharide (PS) vaccine is poorly efficacious in this group. Conjugation of PS antigens to a protein carrier renders vaccines more immunogenic via T-cell dependency. Impressive results in children lend themselves to evaluation in other high risk groups.",

Following vaccination the median number of serotypes with protective antibody levels increased to 4 in both groups (range 0-7). 5 patients, (21%) achieved full protection. Antibody levels doubled in both groups for a median of 5.5 serotypes (range 0-7)and quadrupled for a median of 3 serotypes (range 0-7). Conclusions: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevenar appears to be immunogenic for some individuals in this group. Most patients did achieve an increase in baseline antibody levels, however, it did not provide cover in all cases to all serotypes. Further studies are required to determine optimal dosage and predictors of response prior to its introduction in clinical practice. Pseudomonas aeruginosa represents one of the main causes of nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients, responsible for high morbidity and mortality. From May to September 2006, in the Bone Marrow Unit of the Careggi Hospital in Florence, Italy, 5 severe P. aeruginosa bloodstream infections were diagnosed in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (3 autologous and 2 allogeneic transplants). All isolates resulted phenotipically similar (same biochemical pattern, same pattern of sensitivity to antibiotics). But only three of the pts (2 pts with acute leukemia receiving allogeneic transplant and one pt with non Hodgkin Lymphoma receiving autologous transplantation) had shared the same room in different periods. In the hypothesis of a possible environmental source of the infection, samples for microbiological evaluation (phenotyping analysis and AFLPamplified fragment-length polymorphism) were collected from different sources that had potential for cross-contamination throughout the Bone Marrow transplantation Unit including the electrolytic disinfectant used for medication of skin and mucosae (Irgasan) and facilities (5% Antisapril). A strain of P. aeruginosa with the same phenotype of patients was isolated from the Irgasan soap. To confirm the hypothesis of the clonal origin of the isolates and of the transmission of the infection through the soap, a molecular typing by AFLP was performed on the P. aeruginosa isolates from the 5 blood cultures and the soap.",

Gozzini, L. Lombardini, R. Saccardi, A. Vannucchi, A. Bosi Careggi Hospital (Florence, I) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients. Risk factors are donor/recipient CMV status, type of transplant and acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). PCR-based CMV DNA detection assays are the most sensitive methods for monitoring CMV reactivation. Currently prophylactic or preemptive antiviral treatment, are used for prevention of CMV disease but their role is still debated . We analysed the impact of antiviral prophylaxis on CMV reactivation in 191 consecutive patients treated with myelotoxic allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in our Unit from January 1999 to October 2006. Two consecutive series of patients received different antiviral prophylaxis: 90 pts transplanted from January 1999 to December 2001 received acyclovir i.v. 750mg three times per day from the start of conditioning to day +20 and then 400 mg twice a day by mouth until d +180; 101 pts from January 2002 received gancyclovir 10mg/kg/day from start of conditioning to day -2 and foscarnet 90mg/kg/day from d +4 to d + 20 and then acyclovir 400 mg twice a day by mouth until d +180. All pts were monitored by quantitative-PCR on plasma and cells once a week from d +21. We considered as CMV reactivation a DNA load >104 copies/ml or an increase of 1x103 copies/ml in two consecutive detections. The two series of pts were comparable for CMV serum status recipient (pos 68 vs 86; p0.22), donor type ( IS 51vs55, VUD 39 vs46; p0.46), aGVHD incidence (27 vs 32 pts; p0.6) but not for stem cell source (BM 45 vs 30, PB 41 vs 106; p0.016), according to the transplant era. Interestingly CMV reactivation was similar in the two groups (29 pts vs 38 pts; p0.68). In univariate and multivariate analysis CMV reactivation was significantly correlated with the donor type (p0.001), stem cell source (p0.037), CMV serum status (p0.002), aGVHD (p0.000) but not with the type of prophylaxis (p0.68). Our results suggest that the introduction of ganciclovir plus foscarnet in CMV prophylaxis did not result in a significant improvement in CMV reactivation rate. A. Chukhlovin, M. Ovsyannikova, E. Semenova, O. Pankratova , L. Zubarovskaya, B. Afanasyev St. Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University (St. Petersburg, RUS) Objectives: Herpesviruses are known to reside in most healthy humans, and undergo reactivation in immunocompromised hosts, e.g., following alloHSCT. Hence, the aim of our study was to assess efficiency of PCR monitoring for assessment of viremia in various variants of HSCT. Patients and methods: The study included 100 young patients (mean age 19 years) subjected to allo-HSCT, mostly for ALL (n=45), AML (n=21), and CML (n=12). Bone marrow and PBSC were transfused, resp., in 31% and 69% of cases. Transplantation from matched unrelated donors was made in 63%. Reduced conditioning regimens were applied for 54% of the patients. Virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies were detected by ELISA technique. Monitoring of HSV type 1 and 2, CMV, and EBV DNA by means of PCR in blood and marrow keukocytes was carried out weekly before HSCT and for at least 6 weeks post-transplant. Allele-specific PCR was applied for matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1, 1G/2G) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, 4G/5G), and MDR-1 (C3435T) gene variants. Statistical evaluation was performed by means of non-parametric criteria. Results: 1. As expected, serological studies of patients and donors pretransplant have shown high prevalence of CMVseropositivity in the patient-donor pairs. The post-transplant PCR-positive state (determined as >2 positive findings until d+100) was detected in 33%, 24%, and 26% for, resp., HSV, EBV and CMV. No gross correlations were observed between incidence of the three viral pathogens in blood cells, and source of transplant, age or sex of the patients. However, EBV-and CMV-positivity in myeloablative transplants was observed more common than in HSCT with reduced conditioning. (P<0.005) .",

Use of monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 20 (Rituximab\u00ae) dramatically improved the management of EBV reactivation. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence of lymphoproliferative disease, EBV reactivation and effectiveness of preemptive and curative therapy by Rituximab\u00ae in pediatric URD HSCT. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the cohort of children who received an HSCT with an URD in our institution between January 2001 and September 2006. The EBV DNA load was measured weekly in whole blood by a quantitative real time PCR until the third month following HSCT. Viral genome detection was considered positive when DNA quantification was above 10 copies/mL. EBV disease was defined by positive detection of viral DNA and clinical manifestations including fever associated with cutaneous rash or a lymphoproliferative syndrome. All patients received antithymocytes globulines (ATG) in the conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis by ciclopsorine and no T-cell depletion. Results: Seventy-seven patients were eligible for the study among 134 children who received HSCT. Four patients were excluded because of early death (within 30 days after HSCT). The hematopoietic stem cell source was bone marrow for 53 patients, peripheral stem cells for 6 and cord blood for 14. Thirty-three patients with seronegative donor and recipient were not monitored, none had EBV disease. Among the 40 monitored patients, 27 had a quantifiable viral genome: 6 were not treated, with a median viral load of 4880 copies/ml (range from 200 to 30000 copies/ml). None developed EBV disease. Fourteen patients were treated preemptively with a median viral load of 11295 copies/mL (range from 1950 to 50000) and among them none developed an EBV disease. Seven patients presented a rapid EBV disease without previous increasing viral load ; they all received Rituximab\u00ae and one patient died from EBV and VRS pneumopathy. None of the patients treated, curatively or preemptively had severe adverse event reliable to Rituximab\u00ae. Conclusion: This study suggests that: -Rituximab\u00ae preemptive treatment is efficient and safe with a low average threshold value of more than 10000 copies/mL. The number of Rituximab\u00ae injections should be adapted to evolution of viral load. -Rituximab\u00ae curative treatment is efficient for patients with EBV disease, without serious adverse effects. CMV disease is a major complication during HSCT procedure. Monitoring of viral reactivation and preemptive therapy are now generalised practices. However, the threshold value of CMV DNA quantification for starting preemptive treatment is still a debated question. Objectives: To analyse the incidence of CMV asymptomatic reactivation, CMV disease, and the results of curative and preemptive therapy in paediatric unrelated HSCT. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data from all patients receiving an HSCT from an unrelated donor between January 2000 and September 2006. Viral DNA quantification was monitored weekly until the third month following HSCT by quantitative PCR assay. Viral genome detection even if not quantifiable was considered positive. Cut-off for quantification was 500 copies/mL. CMV disease was defined by positive detection of viral DNA and clinical manifestations including fever associated with cutaneous rash, pneumopathy, intestinal or ocular symptoms. All patients received anti-thymocyte globuline as part of conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis by ciclopsorine . Results: One hundred and sixty two children were transplanted during the study period, 91 patients were eligible for the study. Four patients, without CMV disease, were not included because of early death. The hematopoietic stem cell source was bone marrow for 66 patients, peripheral stem cells for 7 and cord blood for 14. Forty seven patients with negative donor and recipient serostatus were not monitored and didn't have a CMV disease. Forty patients were either seropositive for the CMV and/or had a positive donor. Seventeen of them always had a negative viral load. Two patients had severe combined immunodeficiency revealed by a CMV disease previously to HCST. Sixteen patients were initially CMV positive below 500 copies/mL, among them, 5 were not treated, and 11 were subsequently treated because of an increasing viral load (median 2300 copy/ml). One patient developed a CMV disease. Five patients were initially CMV positive > 500 copy/ml (median 3600) and were all treated, 2/5 developed a CMV disease despite preemptive therapy and one died from CMV. Conclusion: All but one patients preemptively treated recovered, with a low rate of CMV disease. There was no severe adverse event reliable to antiviral therapy. All the patients who reached a viral load of 500 copies/ml subsequently need treatment, so the threshold value of 500 copies/mL for starting treatment is effective and safe.",

It is licensed in Australia for the treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients over the age of 12 years, but is nephrotoxic and contraindicated with the use of other concomitant nephrotoxic agents. Licensed drug information recommends an aggressive hydration regimen. Despite this it is a valuable anti-viral agent, particularly in the setting of blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). This study assessed the safety of CDV in a high-risk paediatric population. Methods: 234 CDV infusions in 23 patients were studied. The CDV dose, renal function, other drugs given and adverse events were obtained from the notes. Patients: were 5months -19years (mean 6.6 years); male 17, female 6; 16 were post allogeneic BMT, 4 post autoBMT, 3 other malignancies. The indication for CDV was adenovirus isolate in 20; adenovirus prophylaxis as part of haplo-identical BMT in 2, and in 1 for sepsis without an identified organism. CDV dose was 1mg/kg (117, 50%), 3mg/kg (70, 30%) and 5mg/kg (47, 20%). CDV was given with a regimen of oral probenecid 40mg/kg at hour -3, 20ml/kg of intravenous 0.9% NaCl from hour -1 to 0, CDV infusion with 20ml/kg 0.9% NaCl from hour 0 to +1, maintenance intravenous fluids from hour +1 to +3, followed by oral probenecid 20mg/kg at hour +3 and +9. All patients were receiving concomitant nephrotoxins: 17% receiving 1; 17% receiving 2; 22% receiving 3 and 43%receiving 4 or more agents. Results:There was no significant change in serum creatinine for any doses or on overall analysis (paired T-Test, SPSS). The only change in urea was a decrease, most likely reflecting improved hydration with CDV. In the 19 patients with normal renal function pre-CDV, there was no evidence of nephrotoxicity with CDV. In 4 (17%) with pre-existing renal impairment, there was no deterioration in renal function. Symptomatically CDV was tolerated by 20 (87%) patients without adverse events. The only toxicity attributable to CDV therapy was 2 patients with pre-existing pneumonitis postallogeneic BMT, where the fluid regimen precipitated respiratory deterioration secondary to fluid overload. Conclusions: CDV is safe and well-tolerated in this high-risk paediatric population, even with concomitant nephrotoxic agents. Given this, the amount of hydration fluids should be reviewed, particularly in patients with pulmonary co-morbidity.",

Mucosal damage is a known risk factor of Gram-positive bacteraemia in transplant patients who develop fever during neutropenia. We were interested to see when the nadir of citrulline was reached after high-dose melphalan (HDM) and its relationship to the onset of neutropenic fever and bacteraemia. Methods: We evaluated 29 patients who underwent consecutively an autologous haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after HDM 100 mg/m\u00b2 (day -3 and -2). Plasma citrulline was collected before starting conditioning therapy and 3 times weekly thereafter until discharge. Blood cultures were taken at the onset of fever both peripherally and via each lumen of the catheter before starting empirical antimicrobial therapy. Results: The baseline mean citrulline concentration was 28 \u00b5mol/L, which is lower than the 35 \u00b5mol/L that is found for healthy individuals. The nadir of citrulline (mean 6.7 \u00b5mol/L) was rapidly reached on HSCT day +8. 20 patients developed fever during neutropenia, but bacteraemia was detected in only 10 cases (50%) The organisms cultured included Streptococcus mitis (in 5 patients) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (in 8 patients); in 5 patients the infections were polymicrobial. Patients with bacteraemia had citrulline values below 10 \u00b5mol/L (range 2-9). The mean (5.5 \u00b5mol/L) was significantly lower (p= 0.02, 95% CI 0.8-8.4) than for patients without bacteraemia (10.2 \u00b5mol/L). No differences in the duration and extent of neutropenia, leukopenia or CRP levels were found. Citrulline concentrations only increased gradually and were still significantly low at a mean of 12 \u00b5mol/L when patients were discharged (figure 1). Conclusion: The occurrence of bacteremia coincides with very low serum citrulline levels rather than the onset of neutropenia, supporting the consideration that mucosal barrier injury is a major risk factor for infectious complications of cytotoxic therapy.",

Fassas G. Papanicolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) A rising incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) has been reported in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloTx) despite the use of primary antifungal prophylaxis. Introduction of novel strategies in alloTx field demands the research of new risk factors predisposing to IFI. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and risk factors for IFI in a group of 135 allografted patients during 2002-2006, aged 36(7-63) years. No patient received chemotherapy for relapse post alloTx. Thirty patients received a reduced intensity regimen. Sibling donors were 107, unrelated volunteers (VUD) 25, haploidenticals 3. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was administrated in 41 patients, in 38 as part of preparative regimen and in 3 as therapy for refractory graftversus-host disease (GvHD). Twenty seven patients received antiCD20 (Rituximab) as management for EBV overload (>1000 genomes/ml in 2 consecutive samples) and 2 for refractory thrombotic thrombopenic purpura. In 99 patients high levels of serum ferritin were detected and 35/99 received Desferioxamine (DFO) for coexisting haemochromatosis. Previously resolved IFI was reported in 15/135 patients. In a median time of 5 months (0.5-28), 34/135 patients developed IFI (probability 40% at 4.5 years). According to EORTC 6 cases were probable, and 28 possible. In univariate analysis IFI pre-Tx, refractory chronic GvHD, ferritin level >2000ng/ml, alternative vs sibling donor and administration of ATG, DFO or rituximab were proven significant risk factors (p<0.05). Appearance of acute GvHD showed tendency to significance (p:0.07). Multivariate analysis revealed as risk factors IFI pre-Tx (p:0.0004), ferritin>2000ng/ml (p:0.01), use of DFO (p:0.05), Rituximab administration (p:0.01), while advanced disease (p:0.06), and acute GvHD (p:0.08) retained tendency to significance. Rituximab probably induces development of IFI through either suppression of B-cells, which are necessary to expand cytotoxic populations, or possibly caused immune neutropenia. Ferum-DFO complex may be used by fungi as growth factor. Considering that Rituximab as well as DFO are crucial agents to manage serious complications after alloTx, further studies are needed to define their possible involvement in fungal infections.",

Krauter, B. Hertenstein, A. Ganser, M. Eder Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) Introduction: Toxoplasma disease (TD) after SCT is a rare complication with high mortality even with specific therapy. TD usually results from reactivation of latent infection due to immunosuppression. We report on 11 cases with local or disseminated TD and retrospectively analyse patient characteristics, potential risk-factors, therapy, and outcome in our institution. Patients and methods: The incidence of proven, probable or possible TD (Martino et al. 2000) from 01/95 to 12/05 is 2.4/100 allogeneic SCT. TD-patients with AML (n=4), CML (n=5), myeloma (n=1), and PNH (n=1) were transplanted with BM (n=2) or PBSC (n=9) from MUD (n=4), MMUD (n=3) and MRD (n=4). Conditioning was TBI/Cy (n=5), Bu/Cy (n=1), FLAMSA/TBI/Cy (n=4), and Flu/Mel (n=1) with CSA/MTX (n=5), CSA/MMF (n=4), CSA/Pred (n=1), and T-cell depletion (n=1) as GvHD prophylaxis. 4 patients suffered from definitive TD with 3 diagnosed at autopsy (1 myocardial, 2 disseminated). Two patients had probable TD based on clinical evidence and positive PCR from peripheral blood samples. In 3 cases clinical findings with cranial CT/MRI (n=2) suggested possible TD. TD manifestation was disseminated (4), cerebral (2), myocardial (1), retinal (1) and BM (1) . Two patients were treated based on serologic findings only. 9/11 TD patients were seropositive for T. gondii before SCT, for two patients pretransplant serology was not available. Median time to TD onset was 86 days (30-685) with 9 patients under immunosuppression, two due to aGvHD and cGvHD. One patient was neutropenic and one had no immunosuppressive treatment. At diagnosis of TD none patient received cotrimoxazole but 8 pentacarinat for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. TD patients diagnosed at lifetime received treatment with pyrimethamine (n=5), atovaquone (n=2) or cotrimoxazole (n=1) in combination with sulfonamides and/or clindamycin. Five patients responded and are alive with a median follow-up of 1.7 years (0.8-10.7). One patient responded with PCR negativity but died due to leukemic relapse, a second died because of TD and leukemic relapse, and the third due to a combination of cerebral toxoplasmosis and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Conclusion: TD is a rare complication after allogeneic SCT with multiple clinical manifestations and significant mortality even under specific therapy. TD diagnosis may be difficult and requires imaging and PCR methods. Prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole as early as possible in seropositive SCT patients should be considered. Impaired T cell reconstitution after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of T-cell reconstitution after SCT determined newly generated T lymphocytes by T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) in addition to the proliferation of donor \"memory\" T lymphocytes. The occurrence of TRECs seems to be associated with the restoration of the T-cell receptor repertoire and may lead to a lower incidence of infections after SCT. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of T cell depletion by anti-thymocyte globulin on T cell neogenesis. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is established as part of the conditioning regimen in matched unrelated donor situation and in order to reduce graft versus host disease (GVHD). Patients who had received ATG (ATG-Fresenius mostly) showed significantly less CD3+ T cells in the first 6 months than patients without ATG (mean 4.3 \u00b1 0.7 and mean 17.1 \u00b1 3.1, p= 0.0005). T cell neogenesis in these patients was analyzed by determining CD4+/CD45RA+ positive T lymphocytes by flow cytometry and TREC-positive T cells by real time PCR. The percentage of CD45RA+ T-cells among CD4+ T-cells in patients who did not receive ATG did not change significantly 1 month after transplantation and thereafter. Elevated levels of TRECS were not found in these patients. In patients receiving ATG and myeloablative transplantation two groups of patients could be defined by their percentage of CD4+/CD45RA+ Tcells and TRECs early after transplantation. A subpopulation of patients after ATG had elevated frequencies of CD4+/CD45RA+ T-cells and TRECs. When reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was performed with ATG application, TREC-positive CD3 T cells were found elevated more frequently.",

We reviewed the clinical records of 103 SCT patients (pts) who received C since then, to the exclusion of pts treated for a probable or definite IA.. Definitions of invasive aspergillosis (IA) were made according to consensus criteria (Ascioglu, 2002) . Results: We recorded 6 breakthrough (BT) IA (IA occurring > 6 days (d) after C initiation), among which 1 proven and 5 probable infections. Aspergillus sp. was isolated in 4 pts: A. fumigatus (n = 2), A. ustus (n = 1), and A. nidulans (n = 1). The 100-day cumulative incidence post C initiation, with death as a competing factor, was 6% (95%CI: 1-11). Patient and IA main characteristics, and susceptibility testing of the isolates are shown in table. Median age was 28 years. Median time to IA diagnosis was 93 days post transplant (range: 47 to 188). Median duration of C treatment before IA diagnosis was 32 days (range: 7 to 197). Susceptibility testing of breakthrough Aspergillus isolates showed that 2 out of 4 isolates tested have high MEC to caspofungin. Voriconazole induced 2/6 CR. However, all pts ultimately died a median of 5 weeks after IA diagnosis. Conclusions: Whether this high incidence of BT IA in SCT pts under C therapy represents a clinically meaningful limitation of C in this population of pts, or is only a reflection of their poor immune status is unknown. Method: To measure the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) virus load in patients with stem cell transplantation (SCT), we developed a highly sensitive and quantitative PCR assay using LightCycler. A plasmid containing a target sequence from the BALF5 gene of EBV was constructed as a positive control template. After purification of the EBV clone and calculation of copy number, the standard curve was constructed by using serial dilution of the plasmid clone. Sequential blood samples (275 samples) were collected from 35 patients as monthly intervals up to at least 6 months post-BMT. A TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay was developed and standardized to quantify EBV DNA copy number in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of SCT patients. Results: The real-time PCR assay could detect from 2 to over 107 copies of EBV DNA with a wide linear range. Viral DNA could be detected in majority of PBMNC samples collected from 35 patients during the follow up. The threshold for normal EBV viral load in our experiment was defined as 1x102 EBV genomes/ 2x105 PBMNC. In this study, no patient developed PTLD during the follow up post transplant; however, EBV copy number in 22 samples (3 patients) was higher than the threshold value with symptoms like fever and pulmonary nodes. The mean EBV DNA copy number in these patients was 104 copies per 2\u00d7105 PBMNC. Conclusion: These results suggest that the real-time PCR assay is useful for quantification of EBV viral load and for monitoring the virus reactivation in BMT patients. S.H. Ghaffari, N. Obeidi, K. Alimoghaddam, M. Dehghan, A. Ghavamzadeh Tehran University Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been recognized as the most important viral pathogen in persons undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In this study, we present the development of a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay to quantify human cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of bone marrow transplantation patients. Materials and Methods: A plasmid containing the target sequence from the pp65 region (UL83) of CMV was constructed as a positive control template. Serial dilutions of 107 to 101 plasmids per assay were prepared. Sequential blood samples (415 specimens) were collected from 51 patients as weekly intervals until day 100 after transplantation. CMV DNA was quantified by RQ-PCR in parallel with the pp65 antigenemia assay in PBL samples. Results: The real-time PCR assay could detect from 10 to over 107 copies of CMV DNA with a wide linear range. Realtime PCR assay results correlated with those of the CMV pp65 antigenemia assay (P < 0.01). CMV DNA was detected by RQ-PCR in 13 patients a mean of 15 days prior to the appearance of antigenemia. About 76% of patients developed more than one episode of CMV replication. If copy number of CMV was increased, preemptive therapy was initiated. The administration of anti-CMV drugs led to a rapid decrease in the numbers of viral copies and positive nuclei. After preemptive therapy, 16 days (7-21 days) needed the result of RQ-PCR to become negative. Conclusion: The TaqMan real-time assay may be a useful tool for rapid quantification of CMV infection and for monitoring of CMV reactivation in bone marrow transplantation recipients. RQ-PCR was more sensitive than pp65 Antigenemia. After preemptive therapy, negative results of RQ-PCR were the best indicator for determining of successful treatment. If copy number of CMV increased one log, CMV reactivation developed 1.22 fold. There were no significant differences observed in frequency and causes of infections. However of the 8 patients with very low MBL levels (<400ng/ml) 5 died of transplant related mortality (TRM) (2 patients from sepsis, 1 from infection and GVHD, 1 from toxicity and 1 from a new malignancy). This is twice the TRM seen in the group as a whole (62% vs 30%).",

MBL deficiency is associated with infection, engraftment and GvHD, which may be related to the higher mortality. A.P. Iori, E. Iannella, G.F. Torelli, F. Milano, A. Capobianchi, B. Lucarelli, L. Malandruccolo, W. Barberi, E. Arleo, P. Martino, R. Fo\u00e0, G. Gentile University Sapienza (Rome, I) High dose Acyclovir (ACV) has been shown to reduce the risk of CMV infection and improved overall survival in stem cell transplant (SCT), in a european, multicentric, randomized study (Prentice,Lancet 1994) . We retrospectively compared two groups of patients who underwent an allogeneic SCT, both receiving i.v. ACV (15 mg/Kg/day) from day -7 to day +20 after transplant followed by low-dose oral (200 mg x 4/day) (group A) or high-dose oral (800 mg x 4/day) (group B) AVC for a period of 6 months. Aim of the study was to evaluate whether there was any difference in the rate of CMV infection, CMV disease, adverse events, probability of survival and transplant related mortality (TRM) between the two groups. We analyzed 108 patients (60 in group A, 48 in group B) at risk of CMV infection (recipient and/or donor seropositive for CMV), managed between January 1999 and July 2006.CMV infection was monitored by pp65 antigenemia assay. Preemptive therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet was used on the basis of pp65 antigenemia positivity. The two groups were comparable for age, sex, hematological disease, disease phase at transplant, CMV serology, combination between donor and recipient at transplant, HLA compatibility, conditioning regimens and supportive therapy. No differences were observed between the two groups considering the rate of engraftment and acute and chronic GVHD. Cumulative incidence of CMV infection was 70% in group A and 60% in group B; this difference was not statistically significant. CMV disease was observed in 2 patients in group A and in 1 patient in group B. Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections were not observed in both groups during the first 6 months after transplant. Observed adverse events that were possibly related to the treatment were nausea and vomiting (55% group in A vs 66% in group B) and creatinine increase (>1.5mg/dl) (45% group in group A vs 56% in group B).The 1year cumulative incidence of TRM was 17% and 21% for groups A and B respectively; the difference was not statistically significant. The 1-year probability of survival by the Kaplan-Meier method was 78% and 75% for group A and B respectively. The 5-year probability of survival was similar between the two groups (63% for group A vs 53% for group B; p=0.5). In conclusion we didn't observe any difference in the incidence of CMV infection, CMV disease, survival or TRM between the two groups. Larger, randomized studies are required to confirm these results.",

Klinker Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik II (Wuerzburg, D) Objectives: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a life threatening complication in patients with haematological malignancies, especially after allogenic stem cell transplantation. As these patients often receive quite a number of different medications drug interactions are a relevant problem. Voriconazole is broadly used in treatment of IFI. Metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) it shows in addition inhibiting and inducing activity for several isoenzymes (2C9, 2C19 and 3A4). For the proton pump-inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole inhibition of several isoenzymes (e.g. 2C9, 2C10, 2D6, 3A4) could be demonstrated. This may cause reduced metabolization of voriconazole. On the other hand the direct effect of increased gastric pH may reduce absorption of the azole. Indeed, for the comedication of omeprazole an increased area under the curve of voriconazole has been demonstrated. Other PPIs have different affinity to CYP enzymes; for pantoprazole e.g. a higher inhibitory activity on CYP 2C9 and 3A4 has been shown. Therefore we investigated the plasma through concentrations (PC) of voriconazole depending on the comedication of pantoprazole. Methods: A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was established to determine PC of voriconazole. Plasma samples from haematological patients with oral voriconazole treatment have been collected and voriconazole concentrations determined. The results were analyzed in correlation to the comedication of pantoprazole. Results: We analyzed 130 samples from 42 patients, 23 samples without comedication (group 1), and 107 from patients also receiving pantoprazole (group 2). PC showed a broad range; in group 1 37 have been below 200 ng/ ml and no above 10.000 ng/ml, in group 2 26 (25%) have been below 200 ng/ ml and 4 above 10.000 ng/ml 4. Average PC have been 1212 ng/ml (median 463, interquartiles Range (IQR) 62,5 -1717,5 for group 1) and 1840 ng/ml (median 803, IQR 206,5 -2199 for group2). In Mann-Whitney-U-Test the difference was not significant. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis we could show that comedication of the PPI pantoprazole did not reduce the PC of voriconazole. Similar to the data shown for omeprazole there is a tendency to higher plasma levels. This was not significant, probably due to the broad range of plasma levels detected. As only few PC have been above 10.000 ng/ml an increased toxicity seems not to be likely and no dose adjustment should be recommended so far. Background: Human lactoferrin is a natural defence protein present in several body fluids and the secondary granulae of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Lactoferrin has pleiotropic functions including broad anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating activity, properties of interest in the treatment of infectious and inflammatory complications in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, in which levels of lactoferrin are decreased. The peptide comprising the N-terminal 11 amino acids of the human lactoferrin protein, representing the first cationic domain (hLF1-11), has been shown more effective in vitro and in vivo than the full length protein and other peptide fragments thereof. Results from animal models representing systemic fungal and local bacterial infection have shown hLF1-11 to be a promising agent in HSCT management, in which transplantation-related morbidity and mortality due to infections remains high. Aim: To determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of 5 mg hLF1-11 given to autologous HSCT recipients following conditioning with high dose melphalan (HDM). Methods: Patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma received one dosage of 5 mg hLF1-11 administered intravenously at 1 ml/min in 20 minutes on the day of transplantation. Follow up was 28 days during which side effects, laboratory results and electrocardiograms were monitored. Results: As scheduled eight patients (N = 8) were included and received the full dose of study drug on day 0 of HSCT. No infusion reactions occurred and the study patients reported no complaints spontaneously. No changes were noticed on electrocardiography. One patient (SC12001) developed elevated transaminase levels four days following HSCT, with AST elevated 5 times (198 U/l) and ALT 7 times (336 U/l) the ULN, meaning a grade 2 respectively 3 adverse event according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Since concomitant drug use including fluconazole could also have caused these abnormalities, this side effect was rated possibly related to the administration of hLF1-11. Spontaneous and full recovery occurred not necessitating any interventions. Otherwise no adverse events occurred, other than those expected for patients undergoing HSCT. Conclusion: Administration of a single dose of 5 mg hLF1-11 was well tolerated and proved safe in patients receiving autologous HSCT following HDM.",

Feliu Hospital Germans Trias (Badalona, E) Objetive: To evaluate prospectively the usefulness of periodic measurement of the serum concentrations of galactomannan antigen in patients with acute leukemia (AL) or stem cell transplantation (SCT) to predict invasive fungal infections. Patients and methods. All consecutive patients from one center on intensive treatment for AL or submitted to SCT during two years (2004) (2005) were evaluated prospectively. Serum galactomannan antigen levels were measured by ELISA twice weekly from admission to discharge. Values over 0.5 ng/mL were considered positive for fungal infection suspicion. Results: A hundred and eighty-nine patients were recruited (33 AML, 12 ALL, 40 allo-SCT and 54 auto-SCT). Out of 1,443 determinations, 59 (4%) were positive, corresponding to 28 episodes (26 patients,16 males, median age 47 years, range 15-70). Diagnoses of these patients were AML 17 (60%, 8 during induction treatment, 5 during consolidation and 4 during allo SCT), ALL 3 (9%) (1 during induction and 1 allo-SCT), 12 (43%) during allo-SCT and 1 during auto-SCT. In 13/28 episodes (46%) the subsequent galactomannan measurement was negative and, consequently, were considered not evaluable and no further action was taken. In 9 out of these 13 episodes borderline values (0.5 to 1 ng/mL) were found. In 15/28 (54%) the positivity persisted in the subsequent determination and were considered as having probable Aspergillus infection. In 4 of the probable infections no focality could be identified and empirical treatment was administered (voriconazol 2, liposomal amphotericin 1 and caspofungin 1) up to negativization of the galactomannan level. Eleven patients presented focal or systemic infection (8 pulmonary, 3 invasive fungal infection -IFI). Treatments included voriconazol (4), liposomal amphotericin (2), caspofungin (1) or associations (4) and the outcome was fovorable in 6/11 (55%). Five patients died (3 of them with a confirmed IFI). Globally, a favorable evolution was observed in 10/15 (67%) episodes. Conclusion: Sequential measurements of galactomannan antigen allowed the detection and preemptive treatment of probable Aspergillus infections. This approach was mainly useful in patients with AML and in those submitted to allo-SCT. Supported in part by the grant P/EF-05 of the Jos\u00e9 Carreras Foundation.",

Shakiba Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, IR) Background and objectives: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) recipients. Its incidence has varied from 7-70% in BMT patients. HC presentations are classified to early and late onset and one of the causative agents of late onset HC is viral infections. In this study we evaluated the role of BK polyoma virus (BKV) infections in late onset HC and the prevalence of this viral infection in BMT recipients were determined. Material and methods: We studied 30 recipients and 24 donors.Total number of 293 EDTA treated blood samples and 293 urine samples were collected from BMT recipients and donors. One sample was collected before transplantation from BMT recipients and donors and also one sample per week for 100 days from BMT recipients. BKV-monoplex in house PCR were used for determination of this virus prevalence in patients. Also data of this investigation were statistically analyzed with version 12 of SPSS. Results: Incidence of HC in BMT recipients with measurement of RBC in urine (grade of 0-4 HC) and with sonographic records of bladder bleeding were 53.3% and 36.7% respectively. Significant correlations were found between BKV -PCR positive results and HC presentation. Conclusion: Due to significant correlations of HC clinical presentations with positive results of BKV-PCR test early diagnosis and treatment of this viral infection have a critical role in prevention and management of HC disorder in BMT recipients.

Results: Early CMV-infection developed in 55 (62,5%) pts, more frequently in pts 10 y.o. -17(77,3%) and 11-15 y.o. -17(77,3%) than in pts 16-21 y.o. -9(45,0%) and adults -12(50,0%), p=0,004. There was tendency to more frequent development of CMV-reactivation in seropositive pts vs primary infection in seronegative ones (49(66,2%) vs 6(42,9%), p=0,089) with highest rate in D/R \"-/+\" cases (80%(24 pts), p=0,012). The rate of CMV-infection was higher after allo-HSCT from MUD than MRD (38(69,1%) vs 17(51,5%), p=0,07) and after myeloablative conditioning than after RIC (33(76,7%) vs 22(48,9%), p=0,013). There was no significant difference between rate of CMV-infeciton in groups with/without ATG (40(64,5%) vs 15(57,7%)). Active CMVinfection considerably delayed the time of engraftment of white blood cells 1,0x10 9 (D+21,9 vs 17,3 in pts without CMV, p=0,006), granulocytes 0,5x10 9 (D+22,2 vs 17,7, p=0,01) and platelets 50x10 9 (D+27,5 vs 20,2, p=0,02). Conclusion: The rate of early CMV-infection after allo-HSCT is higher in children 15 y.o., in seropositive pts, especially in cases with D/R \"-/+\", after allo-HSCT from MUD and myeloablative conditioning. ATG didn't influent on the rate of CMV-infection in our study. Active CMV-infection delays the time of engraftment.",

Matsuno, S. Seo, N. Uchida, K. Masuoka, A. Yoneyama, A. Wake Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: Therapeutic outcomes for hematological diseases have recently been markedly improved due to the introduction of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), improvement of therapeutic regimens, and advancement of supportive therapy. Although invasive fungal infection (IFI) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in HSCT, the proper regimen of prophylaxis as well as treatment of IFI has not been clearly established. In this study, we retrospectively surveyed the incidence of IFI after minimized cord blood transplantation (CBT) performed at our hospital to investigate the effectiveness of antifungal agents for prevention of IFI. Methods: A retrospective survey on the prevention of fungal infection was performed in 183 patients (AML 40, ML 32, MDS 25, ALL24, ATL 21, MDS+AML 12, CML 7, AA 4, MM 3, others 15 ) who underwent minimized CBT (188 transplantations) at our hospital between March 2002 and December 2005. The presence or absence of IFI (fungal breakthrough) within 50 days after transplantation, mainly Aspergillus infection, was surveyed. Results: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was observed after 3 transplantations in 3 patients. These patients had been continuously treated with fluconazole (FLCZ) before and after transplantation, and IPA developed during the treatment (3/71, incidence rate: 4%). These patients were treated with amphotericin B and/or micafungin (MCFG) after the onset, but died of pulmonary aspergillosis. In contrast, no breakthrough IFI occurred in a group (46 patients) in which FLCZ was changed to MCFG immediately at the sign of infection such as fever despite the administration of FLCZ before and after transplantation. Conclusion: Although oral FLCZ is administered to prevent fungal infection before and after transplantation, this agent has a weak antifungal activity against Aspergillus sp. A regimen to change FLCZ to MCFG immediately after a sign of fungal infection appears is recommended not only for the prevention of fungal infection but also for the avoidance of adverse events caused by immunosuppressants because MCFG is less interactive with them. Moreover, a regimen switching FLCZ to MCFG promptly after transplantation should be considered.",

Simeone, M. Cerno, R. Fanin University Hospital (Udine, I) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common complication after allogeneic SCT. Valganciclovir hydrochloride (VALCYTE-VGC) is a pro-drug of ganciclovir, orally available, that has been used in CMV infection in high-risk solid organ transplants (donor positive, recipient negative).The primary aims of our study were the assessment of efficacy and safety of VGC as pre-emptive therapy of CMV disease after allogeneic BMT. In this abstract we are reporting the preliminary results (first 10 patients)of this study. During a five-month-period VGC was administered to 10 consecutive outpatients (pts) with a CMV infection which was diagnosed after a median time of 86 days (range 59-480) from transplant. There were 6 males and 4 females (myelofibrosis 2, leukemia 4, myeloma 2, lymphoma 2). The median age was 55 years (range 43-66); 7/10 pts underwent BMT from unrelated and 3/10 from related donors; 7/10 (70%) pts received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC); CMV prophylaxis consisted in acyclovir in all cases. Pre-transplant CMV serology showed that in 100 % of cases either recipient and/or donor were positive (D+/R+=5/10, D-/R+=5/10. At the onset of CMV infection 9/10 (90%) pts have an acute or chronic graft versus host disease for which were received therapy including prednisone plus other immunosuppressive agents. The pp65 antigenemia assay were positive in all cases with a mean number of positive nuclei of 21\u00b135. The starting treatment dosage of VGC was 900 mg twice a day and it was continued until the CMV antigenemia and viremia (CMV-DNA in the pheripheral blood) became negative in two consecutive samples. Results: All 10 cases obtained a clearance of antigenemia after a median of 8 days of VGC therapy (range 5-16 days)[ Figure 1 ]; viremia became negative in all cases. The median length of manteinance therapy with VGC (900 mg daily) was 21 days (range 8-32). Only one patient developed a mild deterioration of renal function that required dose adjustment (VGC 450 mg daily); mild anemia was reported in 3/10 (30%) pts, neutropenia in 5/10 (50%) pts and thrombocytopenia in 4/10 (40%)[ Figure 2 ]. Conclusions: 1)Pre-emptive therapy with VGC after allogeneic SCT seems to be safe and effective (with a rapid clearance of antigenemia and viremia.",

Majka Jagiellonian University Medical College (Cracow, PL) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HSCT. Developing reliable methods detecting CMV infection is important to identify patients at risk. The aim of this study was to compare two methods: CMV pp65 antigen and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) DNA-CMV assays. CMV antigen was detected in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) by immunohistochemical staining using Clonab CMV Kit (Biotest). The test was considered positive when pp65 was detected in one or more leukocyte per 2.6x105 PBL. CMV-DNA loads in patients plasma was measured by TaqMan. PCR was considered positive when more than 1 copy of CMV DNA per 1ml of plasma was detected. The evaluation was performed in 3 consecutive years. In 2004 only antigenemia studies were performed. Assessing 81 samples we obtained 27% positive, 56% negative and 6% doubtful results. In 11% of samples repetition of the study was necessary because of technical reasons. In 2005 160 samples were evaluated using antigenemia assay, 11 of which were also analysed by qRT-PCR. Using both methods we obtained 14%/18% positive, 79%/82% negative and 2%/0% doubtful results, respectively. Among samples assessed by antigenemia assay 4% required repetitions. In 2006 83 samples were assessed with the use antigenemia assay and 131 samples by qRT-PCR method. The results were as follows: 19%/9% positive, 52%/82% negative, 11%/0% doubtful results, respectively. A determination of pp65 antigen had to be repeated in 18% cases, in 2% samples inhibition of PCR was observed. In 51 cases were evaluated with both methods. In this group 4% samples were doubtful with the antigenemia but positive with the qRT-PCR and 8% samples were positive in antigenaemia assay, while in the qRT-PCR they were negative. In 29% of cases immunohistochemical staining had to be repeated. Comparison of these two methods showed that positive results were found in 20% vs 15%, negative in 62% vs 82%, doubtful in 6% vs 0% and repetition necessity in 11% vs 1%, respectively. Reevaluation of the antigenemia study increased costs and delayed introduction of treatment. Moreover, positive and doubtful results in absence of infection caused exposure to risk of unnecessary treatment and increased costs. A time needed to obtain results was much shorter for qRT-PCR, which could be of great value in immunocompromised patients. A. Nihtinen, L. Volin, V.-J. Anttila, E. Juvonen, T. Ruutu Helsinki University Central Hospital (Helsinki, FIN) Recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and patients with acute leukaemia are at high risk for invasive mould infections. Since little is known about the incidence of these infections in a setting of a relapse after an allogeneic SCT, a retrospective study was performed. Between January 1 2000 and December 31 2005, 220 adult patients (114 AML, 65 ALL, 39 MDS, 2 other) with a median age of 46 years (range 17 -65) received an allogeneic SCT at the Helsinki University Central Hospital. At the time of transplantation, 119 patients were in first remission. The donor was an HLAidentical sibling in 123 cases and unrelated in 97. Of the grafts, 129 were PB and 91 BM. As conditioning, Cy+TBI was used for 181, Busulfan for 10 and Treosulfan for 22. Reduced intensity conditioning according to the Seattle protocol was given to 7 patients. ATG was given to 89 patients with an unrelated donor as a part of the conditioning. After the transplantation, acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grade 2-4 was seen in 22 patients, five of these patients later had a relapse. Of the 92 patients with chronic GVHD (limited 48, extensive 44), 10 relapsed. With a median follow up time of 690 days (range 6 -2297), 74 (31 AML, 24 ALL, 17 MDS, 2 other) patients have relapsed. The median time from transplantation to relapse was 184 days (range 16-1621). The relapse was treated with chemotherapy alone in 23, chemotherapy + DLI in 32, DLI alone in one and palliative care in 18 patients. No systemic fungal prophylaxis was used. Invasive mould infection was diagnosed in eight of the 74 (10.8%) relapsed patients and three of the 146 patients without a relapse (2%) (p 0.008). In the group of relapsed patients, a proven Aspergillus infection was seen in four patients, Fusarium in one patient (blood culture) and Mucor in one patient (orbita). Two patients had a probable Aspergillus infection. All eight patients had received a combination of chemotherapy and DLI for their relapse and had developed GVHD. Of the relapsed patients, 64 (86.5%) have died of the haematological malignancy. Of the eight patients with a mould infection, one is alive 483 days after the relapse. In the nonrelapse group of patients, 111/146 are alive. In conclusion, the incidence of invasive mould infections was significantly increased in patients with acute leukaemia or MDS relapsing after an allogeneic SCT and systemic prophylaxis should therefore be considered for these patients.",

Pieroni (1) Leprosy is an infectious disease with severe skin and peripheral nerves lesions. We reported the association of leprosy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) on six patients. The first one developed erythematous plaques on the limbs without neurosensitive symptoms on D+222. Biopsy showed lepromatous leprosy (LL), treatment was rifampicine, clofazimine and dapsone (RCD), improvement occurred after 30 days. A type II reverse reaction was treated with prednisone plus thalidomide and cleared leprosy lesions. The second case developed annular erythematous skin plaques on the face and limbs 174 days after AHSCT. Biopsy showed borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy, treatment with RCD improved the lesions after 30 days. The third case presented erythematous painless plaques on the right shoulder 43 months after AHSCT. Biopsy showed borderline tuberculoid leprosy, monotherapy with clofazimine did not clear lesions after six months. The fourth case had a previous history of LL without lesions before the AHSCT. On D+318, cutaneous cGVHD was associated with sharp pain and paresthesia in the upper and lower limbs. Nerve biopsy showed tuberculoid leprosy. No treatment was given after AHSCT and currently he presents paresthesis in the lower finger tips. The fifth case presented erythematous plaques on the trunk, abdomen, cripples and buttocks, after one week of treatment with hydroxyurea for CML. Biopsy showed BL leprosy. Initial treatment with ofloxacin and dapsone was done with regression of lesions after 28 days. After D+229 atypical type I reverse reaction developed and presented intermittent corticosteroid-dependent course. In the last follow-up there was no evidence of leprosy. The sixth case had brownish plaques on the trunk, buttocks and limbs, with a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. Before AHSCT bacilloscopy of the lesions was consistent with leprosy and treatment with ofloxacin was initiated. The patient died of pneumonia on D+13 after AHSCT. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the six patients showing that the association of leprosy and AHSCT may occur like de novo opportunistic mycobacterium infection, immune mediated reaction exacerbated by GVHD in a previously treated leprosy patient and simultaneous occurrence of leprosy and a potentially transplantable disease. Thus, leprosy must be considered in the differential diagnosis of skin and neurological lesions after AHSCT and does not seen to be a contraindication for the procedure.",

Thiebaut (1) , M. Perraud (1), D. Lyonnet (1), S. Ozil (2) (1)H\u00f4pital E. Herriot (Lyon, F); (2)Delta Protection (Lyon, F) Background: Patients (pts) with long neutropenia are at high risk to develop poor prognosis invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (API). Pulmonary Computed Tomography Scans (CT scan) allow earlier diagnosis of API and improve management. However, CT scans require disrupting isolation, which is potentially dangerous. We propose a diving suit to preserve the preventive isolation. Material and Methods: The diving suit is personal, sterile, ambulatory and transparent for monitoring, visual and verbal contact. It has a self-contained ventilation station with a 12hour air supply. Air contamination is controlled with 2 HEPA filters. Fifteen pts treated for acute leukaemia tested it after giving informed consent. Results: The diving suit is validated for air contamination, physiological (CO2), CT scan feasibility and pt acceptance. All pts (5 male, 10 females) presented a severe neutropenia (PNN < 0.5 G/l more than 10 days) at time of CT scan. Three pts had already had a pulmonary CT scan before using the suit and 2 claimed to be claustrophobic. No pt described dyspnea (pain or discomfort). All pts felt reassured and agreed to a new CT scan with this outfit. Two pts had another CT scan with the suit for suspicion of API. The diving suit was very easy to manipulate and did not disrupt monitoring or treatment administration. It was also compatible with Doppler and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. For one pt with an anti-bacteriologic drug resistant fever, 3 thoracic CT scans were performed (1 per week) without any sign of API. The 4th CT scan showed an API diagnosis with halo sign. This diagnosis was confirmed by histology after surgery. In this case, contamination was not possible during the first CT scan because of the diving suit. Conclusion: Pulmonary CT scans very often need to be performed in neutropenic pts to diagnosis API. Ambulatory, personal protective clothing preserves isolation for immunocompromised pts during a CT scan. It can also be proposed for medical staff protection when treating patients with SARS or other highly contagious agents. Unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has been used as an alternative treatment for hematological malignancies in pediatric patients. Outcome of UCBT has been related to the total nucleated cell dose and number of HLA-A, -B, -DR compatibilities; but other prognostic factors could be implicated. Recent findings indicate that the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be affected by NK cell alloreactivity via killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs). The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of donor-recipient HLA and KIR genotypes on the outcome of UCBT in 48 pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. Our results with donor-recipient pairs characterized by missing donor HLA ligand in the recipient (HLA-C1, HLA-C2 or HLA-Bw4) for corresponding donor KIR, not only failed to show any beneficial effect but also indicated trends for a deleterious effect on DFS (p=0.09), a higher relapse frequency (p=0.08) and a lower aGVHD rate (p=0.03). The latter finding contrasts with those from previous reports on HSCT and could be due to an education of na\u00efve cord blood NK cells after transplantation. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that KIR3DS1 positive in donor is an independent predictor of disease relapse (p=0.03) whether in the presence or absence of recipient KIR3DS1. This is the first study to analyze the influence of HLA and KIR genotypes in donors and recipients on the outcome of UCBT in pediatrics patients. We observed no beneficial effect on relapse frequency in patients lacking HLA ligand for donor inhibitory KIR. This could be due to an educational effect of the na\u00efve NK cells from the donor. The main finding was that presence of KIR3DS1 in donor is an independent factor of disease relapse in UCBT. Our data suggest that HLA and KIR genotypes are implicated in the outcome of UCBT and could be helpful for graft selection. These preliminary results will require confirmation in larger retrospective multicenter trials as well as in prospective trials. Further study will also be needed to determine the biological relevance of these data and propose an algorithm of selection of CB associating the HLA and KIR genotypes. Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HHCT) after high dose conditioning with CD34-selected stem cells has been complicated by high regimen related toxicities, slow engraftment and delayed immune reconstitution leading to increased treatment related mortality (TRM). A new regimen using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and graft CD3/CD19 depletion with anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 coated microbeads on a CliniMACS device may allow HHCT with lower toxicity and faster engraftment. CD3/CD19 depleted grafts not only contain CD34+ stem cells but also CD34 negative progenitors, natural killer-, graft-facilitating-and dendritic-cells. RIC was performed with fludarabine (150-200 mg/m\u00b2), thiotepa (10 mg/kg), melphalan (120 mg/m\u00b2) and OKT-3 (5 mg/day, day -5 to +14) and no posttransplant immunosuppression. Twenty seven patients (median age=41 (range, 21-59) years) have been transplanted with this regimen. Diagnosis were AML (n=15), ALL (n=7), NHL (n=2), MM (n=2) and CML (n=1). Patients were \"high risk\" with refractory disease or relapse after preceding HCT. The CD3/CD19 depleted haploidentical grafts contained a median of 7.6 x 10 6 (range, 3.4-17x10 6 ) CD34+cells/kg, 5.4x10 4 (range, 0.006-44x10 4 ) CD3+T-cells/kg and 7. 5x10 7 (range, 0.02-37.3 x10 7 ) CD56+cells/kg. Donor-recipient KIR-ligandmismatch was found in 17 of 27 patients. The regimen was well tolerated with maximum acute toxicity being grade 2-3 mucositis. Because of severe neurotoxicity in 4 patients treated with 200 mg/m\u00b2 fludarabine, the dose was reduced to 150 mg/m\u00b2 with no further cases of neuropathy thereafter.",

Lang (1) Graft failure is a rare but life-threatening complication after transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells. Treatment comprises immunoablative reconditioning regimens and a second stem cell donation from the same or from a different donor as soon as possible to minimize the time of pancytopenia and its sequelae. We report a cohort of 11 pediatric patients with leukemias (acute lymphatic n=4, acute or chronic myeloic / MDS n=4) and severe aplastic anemia (n=3) who experienced graft failure (nonengraftment,n=1; rejection, n=10) after TBI, busulphan or melphalan based myeloablative transplantation from mismatched related donors (MMRD) (n=6) or after cord blood / matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation (n=5) between 2000 and 2005. In the latter the original donor was not available a second time. Thus, all patients were retransplanted with CD34+ positive selected or CD3/CD19 depleted stem cells from a second, haploidentical parental donor (MACS method, Miltenyi Biotec). Median time span from diagnosis of graft rejection to second transplantation was 9 days. The reconditioning regimens consisted of total lymphoid irradiation or cyclophosphamide, thiotepa (5mg/kg), fludarabine (120 mg/m\u00b2) and ATG /OKT3. A median number of 25x10E6/kg of body weight stem cells with 95.000/kg residual T cells were infused. Mofetilmycophenolat was given as GvHD prophylaxis, if residual T cells exceeded 25 000/kg bw. 7/10 evaluable patients had therapy resistant fever and high levels of LDH (median of maximum values: 929 (347-1422 IU/ml). Flow cytometry analyses revealed a predominance of CD3+8+ lymphocytes and an almost complete decrease of B and NK subsets. Sustained engraftment was achieved in all patients (ANC>500/ l: 9 (11-32) days). No GvHD > grade II was observed. T cell recovery was delayed, however no lethal viral infection occurred. Severe organ toxicity was observed in 2 patients (BOOP, hemorrhagic cystits) and moderate mucositis in 11 patients. 8/11 patients are disease free (median follow up 1.9 (1.0-6.9) years; 1 year EFS=73%). Causes of death were: BOOP (n=1), infection (n=1); only one patient with refractory AML relapsed. Thus, transplantation of stem cells from haploidentical donors represents a realistic option to rescue patients with graft failure within a short time span and for whom a second donation of the original donor is not available. The use of a different donor may help to avoid a second rejection.",

The mean recovery of NC, WBC and MNC after manual volume reduction was 85\u00b19%; 84\u00b19% and 82\u00b19.5% and for the automated sytem 85\u00b19.4, 86\u00b19.8 and 84.5\u00b17.6%.

Lowdell Royal Free & UCL Medical School (London, UK) In October 2006 the second technical annex to the EU Tissues & Cells Directive was published (2006/83/EC) which determined the appropriate conditions for \"open\" processing to be Grade A air in a Grade D background. Grade A air is achieved by processing within a class II microbiological cabinet. The standard for grade D air is a maximum of 3500000 particles >0.5 microns in size per m\u00b3 of air and 20000 >5.0 microns. This standard is below that already required or in use in some member states (e.g. Gemany and UK) but is above those required by JACIE/FACT. It is significantly below the standard required for manufacture of somatic cell therapy pharmaceutical products for clinical trials. HPC transplants have been performed in many EU MS for over 25 years and the great majority have involved products which were procured and/or processed in \"open\" conditions in a grade A environment in a conventional laboratory which did not meet even grade D standards. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the frequency of bacterial contamination of HPC-A and HPC-M received and released by our laboratory over the 25 years of HPC transplantation. All products received by the laboratory were tested for aerobic and anaerobic contaminants at reception and post-processing. The data were compared with products received/released post-2002. Pre 2002 data included 1648 allogeneic or autologous HPC-M or HPC-A which were compared with 332 products produced in clean-room conditions. These frequencies of contamination were not significantly different to those observed after relocation into clean-room facilities. 11 patients received an HPC product which was known to be microbially contaminated. No adverse events were reported and all engrafted with no significant delay. Conclusions: The chance of microbial contamination of an HPC product is mostly determined by the harvesting procedure and not the laboratory processing. The incidence of laboratory-acquired microbial contamination is low and is affected by the degree of processing, cryopreservation being associated with a doubling of risk in the case of HPC-M. We can find no evidence of a reduction in this risk following the relocation into clean-room laboratories.",

Nagler (1) Currently, most of the cord blood banks (CBB) cryopreserve human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) units as a mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction using DMSO which results in 20-30% cell loss. The units are usually stored in liquid nitrogen (LN) tanks. Long term storage in LN is costly, requires means to avoid transient warming events and there is a risk (although small) of cross contamination between stored samples. One way to avoid these problems is by lyophilization. Lyophilization is a process in which ice crystals sublimate (form vapor without going through the liquid phase) resulting in a dry, stable and low weight sample. We have developed a freezing apparatus named the Multi Thermal Gradient (MTG) device. This device is based on directional freezing technology and enables the precise control of ice crystal morphology during the freezing process, thus making the use of intracellular cryoprotectant agents (CPAs) redundant. HUCB units from consenting mothers were split into 2 portions and a comparison between fresh un-manipulated CB cells and cells that underwent lyophilization was performed. The MNC fraction was separated on an F/H gradient. A freezing solution named IMT-2 was added to the cell pellet and 2.5 ml of the cell suspension were put in a glass test tube and frozen using the MTG-516 freezing apparatus. After freezing, samples were placed in a commercial lyophilizer for 3.5 days. Rehydration was done by adding 2.4 ml of double distilled water (DDW) pre-warmed to 37\u00baC. After lyophilization and rehydration samples were evaluated for: viability, CFU-GM growth and CD34+ cell number. Viability was assayed by live/dead fluorescent stains using SYBR/PI. GM-CFU frequencies were assessed in semisolid cultures and CD34+ expression was assessed by FACS. Viability after lyophilization was 89.21\u00b11.5% as compared to fresh CB cells. The number of CD34+ cells was 15,600 cells/ml before freezing and 17,450\u00b1150cells/ml after lyophilization. GM-CFU growth after lyophilization was reduced by only 30% as compared to the fresh un-manipulated sample.",

Lemarie (1) Objectives: A major factor that affects cord blood (CB) transplantation outcome is cell dose. Cell loss consecutive to post thaw processing is reported to be unpredictable and sometimes significant. The goal of our study was to analyze a single centre experience of CB thawing for transplantation, in order to evaluate the influence of volume-reduction before freezing and post-thaw processing on cell recovery after thawing. Methods: Sixty-one unrelated CB were thawed at a unique cell therapy facility from December 2004 to November 2006. Thirty CB had been volume-reduced before freezing, and 31 had been frozen without volume-reduction (whole CB). To obtain a graft volume below 10ml/kg, CB were either washed after thawing using a standard SOP based on P. Rubinstein technique (n=48; volume-reduced and whole CB), or diluted to obtain a final DMSO concentration below 1% (n=13; volumereduced CB). At the end of the post-thaw processing, the Total Nuclear Cells (TNC) count was measured with an automatic counter, whereas the viable CD34+ cell count was measured by cytometry with the Stemkit\u00ae single platform assay. After infusion, potential immediate adverse events were graded according to the CTC-NCI classification. Results: At thawing, the median TNC recoveries were 84% and 76% for volume-reduced and whole CB respectively. The median CD34+ cell recoveries were identical in the 2 subgroups (60%). Considering volume-reduced CB, the median TNC recoveries were 74% and 85% respectively for CB that were washed (n=15) or diluted (n=13) after thawing. The median CD34+ recoveries were 48% and 80% respectively for washed (n=17) or diluted (n=10) CB. Patient immediate tolerance to infusion was reported for 43 transplantations. Two grade 2 adverse events occurred: one in the diluted CB subgroup (n=10) and one in the volumereduced CB subgroup washed after thawing (n=33). Haematopoietic reconstitution and chimerism could not be analyzed due to variability of multiple factors: patients adults versus pediatrics, myeloablative versus reduced intensity conditioning regimens, single versus double CB transplantations. Conclusion: We conclude that processing of CB after thawing has to be adapted to frozen unit characteristics. The initial washing SOP described by P. Rubinstein in 1998 concerned CB frozen without volume reduction. To optimize the cell recovery of volume-reduced CB after thawing, CB may simply be diluted to reduce the DMSO concentration if the patient weight allows it.",

Management of early graft failure has been problematic as the risk of fatal infectious complications increases with the time of pancytopenia and retransplantation preceded by a conventional myeloablative conditioning regimen is associated with high rates of cumulative organ toxicity such as pneumonitis and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Therefore we elected to prove an experimental primarily immunosuppressive TLI-based reconditioning regimen in order to obtain rapid engraftment paralleled by low treatment toxicity. 14 patients (7 adults and 7 children) with a variety of hematologic malignant diseases underwent TLI-based reconditioning regimen with 7 Gy single dose application plus OKT3/ antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/ fludarabine, followed by an infusion of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from related/ unrelated donors. Eleven of 14 recipients were evaluable for engraftment following TLI-based reconditioning since three adults died (day 2/ 5/ 15) due to infectious complications. Remaining four adults initially engrafted at a median of 13,5 days (range 11-16 days) whereas six of seven children had sustained engraftment with a median of 10 days (range 9-32 days). TLIbased reconditioning was well-tolerated with no severe toxicity concerning the thyroid gland, lung, liver and bladder. Overall/ disease-free survival for the whole cohort was 42,8%. After a median follow-up of 681 days, in children disease-free/ overall survival are 85,7%/ 85,7%, respectively. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that in heavily pretreated patients with graft failure/ graft rejection after HSCT, TLI-based reconditioning regimens allow sustained engraftment paralleled by minimal toxicity potentially leading to long-term survival.",

Chabannon Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Autologous hematopoietic stem cell graft thawing and washing before infusion is systematically performed in some transplant centers to limit DMSO-related complications and to standardize the thawing step. Total nucleated cells (TNC) viability and CD34+ cell recovery are considered and recorded as the main quality parameters for the thawing process. We report on a retrospective cohort of 370 hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) grafts washed and assessed at a unique cell therapy facility, the biological and clinical factors associated with a low TNC viability in the thawed cell product. HSC bags were thawed with a traditional waterbath (n=165) or using a dry thawing device (n=205). The washing procedure was performed on a standard centrifuge after dilution (n=210), or using a closed automated washing device, CytoMate (n=160). CD34+ cell recuperation and TNC viability were measured on the infused cell product, using the StemKit single platform assay that includes the 7-AAD viability dye. We defined the low TNC viability group as the first quartile of our population (n=90), that includes HSC grafts characterized by a TNC viability lower than 55% (25th percentile). Median TNC viability was 50% for this group and 70% for the high TNC viability group (n=280). Median CD34+ cell content before cryopreservation was 5.5x10 6 /kg and 5.0x10 6 /kg for the low and high TNC viability groups, respectively. Median viable CD34+ cell recuperation after thawing and washing was 74% for the low TNC viability group, as compared to 77% for the remaining grafts. Both groups had an identical number of infused viable CD34+ cells (3.9x10 6 /kg) and a similar hematopoietic reconstitution: 12.0 days to reach a circulating neutrophil count of 0.5x109/L after infusion. Significant differences between these groups were only observed for the absolute number of granulocytes in the apheresis product (13x10 9 for the low TNC viability group versus 7x10 9 ) and the occurrence of infusion-related adverse events (17% in the low TNC viability group versus 7%).",

Chabannon Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Thawing and washing of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) grafts before infusion is for some transplant centers a routine procedure. Each year, more than 300 HSC graft are thawed at our institution, a procedure that still requires a waterbath. This open system is operator-dependant and not convenient to handle in a cGMP facility, due to daily change of water. We thus evaluated an automated, closed thawing system, CytoTherm CT-D2, for its ability to preserve HSC viability and recuperation after thawing. Previous pre-clinical experiments performed on 8 disqualified apheresis products that were divided in 2 identical cryobags revealed comparable CD34+ cell recuperation and nucleated cell viability between our traditional waterbath-based technique and the dry thawer. Based on these results, we decided to use this device for autologous HSC graft thawing. We here report our data on the first 100 transplantations using the CytoTherm CT-D2, as compared to 100 historical procedures using a conventional waterbath. Measured water temperature for each of the 2 systems was set to 40\u00b0C. Average number of thawed bags was 2.0 for each condition, and numbers of CD34+ cells before cryopreservation were 5.4x10 6 /kg for the waterbath group, and 5.0x10 6 /kg for the CytoTherm group. After thawing, all grafts were diluted 2-fold and supernatant was removed following a 15 min centrifugation step. Average viable CD34+ cell recuperation measured on the final product was comparable (85% versus 83% with the CytoTherm CT-D2). Total nucleated cell viability was 63% when using the CytoTherm as compared to 59% when using the waterbath, as evaluated with the StemKit single platform assay. Time to reach a circulating neutrophil count of 0.5x109/L after infusion was 12.0 days for both groups of patients. CD34+ cell recuperation and total nucleated cell viability, measured on 100 thawing procedures, were equivalent to the traditional waterbath technique. Our data suggest that this closed, fully standardized automated system, drastically reduces water handling, potentially limits water-borne contaminations and has to be preferred in cGMP facilities. Background: Effective T-cell depletion is a prerequisite for haploidentical stem cell transplantation. We investigated the performance of magnetic cell sorting (MACS)-based direct large-scale T-cell depletion, which is an attractive alternative to standard stem cell enrichment procedures. Study design and methods: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were harvested from 11 HLA-haploidentical family donors. T-cells labelled with anti-CD3 coated beads were depleted with the CliniMACS device using either the Depletion 2. 1 (D2.1, n=12) or the novel D3.1 (n=11) program. If indicated, additional positive CD34-selections were performed (n=6). Eleven patients received T-cell depleted grafts after reduced-intensity conditioning. Results: The median log10 T-cell depletion was better with the D2.1 compared to the D3.1 program(log 3.6 vs. log 2.3, p<0.05) and could be further improved by introducing a blocking step (log 4.5 and log 3.4, respectively). D3.1 was superior to D2.1 (p<0.05) in median recovery of CD34+ cells (90 % vs. 78 %) and in median recovery of CD3 negative cells (87 % vs. 76 %). Total processing times were 1.7 to 5.3 hours (D2.1) and 1.0 to 2.5 hours (D3.1). The transplanted grafts (directly T-cell depleted products \u00b1 CD34+ selected cells) contained a median of 10.5\u00d710 6 /kg CD34+, 0.93\u00d710 5 /kg CD3+, and 11.6\u00d710 6 /kg CD56+. Rapid engraftment was achieved in 10 patients. The incidence of acute GvHD was < 20% (grade I/II) and 0% (grade III/IV). Conclusion: Both, the D2.1 and the novel D3.1 program enable effective, time-saving large-scale T-cell depletion. Combining direct depletion techniques with standard CD34selection enables the composition of grafts optimized to the specific requirements of the patients.",

On the other hand, extensive manipulation of thawed cells could reduce the number of haemopoietic progenitors in the graft, and potentially jeopardize haematologic recovery. In order to avoid these problems, we have developed a semi-automated method for removal of DMSO from thawed leukaphereses products using the COBE 2991 cell processor. We have also analysed haematologic recovery after the reinfusion of washed cells in haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Methods: A total of 275 aphereses products from 91 consecutive patients undergoing transplantation at a single institution were processed. After thawing in a 37\u00ba C water bath, cell suspensions were 50% diluted in an hypertonic solution containing saline dextran, human albumin, and acidcitrate-dextrose (ACD-A). Cells were centrifuged and washed in the COBE 2991 cell processor. Quality controls included cell counts, viability, CD34+ cell enumeration, microbiological cultures and haemopoietic progenitor cell assays (CFU-GM, CFU-E) Results: There were no adverse events during cell manipulation. All microbiological controls were sterile. After washing, recovery of total nucleated cells was 76.4 %. Recovery of CD34+ cells was 143 %. Functional cultures showed 65 % and 71% recovery of CFU-GM and CFU-E, respectively. Neutrophil engraftment occurred at a median of 10 days (8-15), whereas platelet engraftment occurred at day 12 (8-60). Conclusions: our results demonstrate that washing thawed leukaphereses cell products prior to reinfusion, is safe and does not preclude haemopoietic reconstitution.",

Cells were frozen in 10% DMSO and autologous plasma at concentrations of <150,000 cells/ml in pilot tubes in tandem with bags containing the PBSC units. Samples were thawed after a minimum of 24 hours in liquid nitrogen. Immediately after thawing at 38o, an equal volume of FACS buffer (PBS + 2% fetal calf serum) was added. 150 ul of the sample was immediately analyzed for total nucleated cell (TNC) count and differential, viability (trypan blue exclusion), and CD34+ cell count (IM aliquot), and the remainder was washed (centrifugation 200g x 10 min, 4o), resuspended in FACS buffer, and then analyzed as above (WASH aliquot). CFU-GM colony growth from both aliquots was assessed in GM-CSF supplemented 0.9% methylcellulose. Mean TNC recovery (% of pre-freezing values) was lower in WASH vs. IM aliquots (56% vs. 94%, respectively (p<.0001), and mean viabilities of the samples were 75% and 79% (p=0.004). Mean number of granulocytes was similar in both aliquots. Mean CD34+ cell recovery was lower in WASH vs. IM aliquots (28% vs. 53%, p<0.0001). Mean CFU-GM colonies/1 x 105 cells were 12 vs. 76 in WASH and IM aliquots, respectively (p<.001). In a separate experiment, IM cells were analyzed immediately or incubated at 4o for 30 minutes before analysis. Incubation did not effect TNC recovery, viability, or the number of CFU-GM/ 1 x 105 cells, while mean CD34+ cell recovery rose to 71% vs. 53% in unincubated samples(p=.012). It is likely that this increase in CD34+ cell recovery results from enhanced of antigenicity/presentation of the thawed CD34 molecule on the surface of incubated cells, rather than from increased expression of this protein on cells. Post-thaw evaluation of cryopreserved G-CSF molibilized PBSC should be performed on diluted but otherwise unmanipulated cells that have been incubated at 4o for at least 30 minutes.",

Humpe (1) Purpose: Processing of cellular therapeutics in an open system according to GMP guidelines requires a cleanroom grade A with surrounding grade B conditions. A new closed bag system with an incorporated DMSO-resistant sterile filter (C3 Cell Freeze TM, CharterMedical) offers the opportunity to process cellular products outside of cleanroom facilities. To test the capacity of the filter challenge experiments with bacteria were performed. Methods: 3 different batches (#06C10, #06D21, and #108763) of the systems were challenged with defined suspensions of Bacillus subtilis strain ATCC 6051 or Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC 14990. 20ml of DMSO with a final load of 10E+03, 10E+04, 10E+05, or 10E+06 bacteria/ml and 20ml of NaCl 0.9% with a bacterial load of 10E+06 bacteria/ml were applied to the sterile filter. Samples for evaluation of bacterial growth were taken before and after passage of the filter. Bacterial titers were counted after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C at ambient air and agar plates screened for crosscontaminations. In addition, in the S. epidermidis series samples before and after passage of the filter were tested by quantitative Real-Time PCR with Staphylococcus spec. specific primers and an universal 16SrRNA TaqMan probe using a LightCycler 2.0 instrument (Roche) and the QuantiTec Probe PCR Kit (Qiagen). Results: In the S. epidermidis series samples taken before filtration revealed no bacterial growth when suspended in DMSO. Nevertheless, PCR analyses of the same series after filtration still revealed positive results. Challenging with B. subtilis, a more DMSO-resistant bacterium, revealed a filter failure of lot # 108763 regardless of the applied medium (DMSO or NaCl 0.9%). The other filter lots tested successfully retained the inoculated bacteria. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the reliability of closed systems for cryopreservation of cellular products is dependent on a sufficient and effective quality control and assurance system both on the side of the manufacturer of sterile filters and on the side of the distributor of the whole system.

Uharek Charit\u00e9 University Hospital (Berlin, D) Background: NK cells are important mediators of graft-versusleukemia activity. Since ATG and monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for in vivo T cell depletion to prevent GvHD, we investigated the effect of different types of serotherapy on the frequency and function of NK cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Induction of apoptosis in vitro: NK cells and T cells were separated from PBMCs by positive and negative selection of CD56 and CD3 (Micro Beads). Cells were incubated with Thymoglobulin, Lymphoglobulin, ATG Fresenius, Alemtuzmab and OKT3 in concentrations ranging from 0.001 \u00b5g/ml to 1000 \u00b5g/ml for 72 hours. Cell death and Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using the propidium iodide and the Annexin V-FITC Detection Kit. NK cell activity in vivo: PBMCs of 34 patients at day +30 after allogeneic HSCT were coincubated for 3 hours with the NK sensitive cell line HL60, NK cells were stained (CD56, CD3) and CD107a expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Results: In vitro: NK cells were affected differentially by the antibodies: OKT3 did not induce apoptosis; Lymphoglobulin >10 \u00b5g/ml was needed to induce apoptosis in >50% of NK cells; in contrast <1 \u00b5g/ml Alemtuzumab, Thymoglogulin or ATG-Fresenius induced apoptosis in >50% of NK cells. T cells were effected equally by the antibodies: for induction of apoptosis in >50% of T cells >10 \u00b5g/ml of all tested antibodies were needed. In vivo: Fourteen pts received Thymoglobulin, ten pts Alemtuzumab and ten patients no T cell depletion. The median NK cell (T cell) count was: 250 /\u00b5l (630 /\u00b5l) in pts without T cell depletion, 400 /\u00b5l (630 /\u00b5l) in pts with Thymoglobulin and 100 /\u00b5l (100 /\u00b5l) in pts receiving Alemtuzumab (p<0.0005). The median percentage of degranulating NK cells was 4,4% without T cell depletion, 2,8% when Thymoglobulin was used and 0,8% when Alemtuzumab was given (p<0.0005). Conclusion: The antibodies used for T cell depletion differentially impact NK cells and T cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we found that low concentrations of Thymoglobulin, Alemtuzumab and ATG-Fresenius induced NK cell apoptosis, whereas high concentrations of Lymphoglobulin were needed to induce NK cell apoptosis. In patients receiving T cell depletion with Alemtuzumab, NK cell activity and T cell counts were considerably reduced. In contrast, Thymoglobulin had only moderate impact on the NK cell activity in the early phase post allogeneic HSCT.",

Greb, D. Niederwieser, S. Tschiedel University of Leipzig (Leipzig, D) Objective: Minor histocompatibility antigens are considered responsible for both GvHD as well as GvT effects after HCT. In the present analysis we investigated the endogenous HA-1specific immune response in HLA-A*0201 HA-1 positive patients after HA-1-mismatched HCT in conjunction with the clinical course. Methods: A total of 9 HLA-A*0201 HA-1 positive patients with hematological malignancies received HCT from a HLAmatched HA-1-mismatched donor, 7 of them with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). The appearence of HA-1-specific T-cells was monitored with HLA-A*0201/HA-1 Tetramers and the IFN-g Elispot Assay. From 2 patients T-cell lines were generated at different time points after engraftment. Results: Tetramer staining detected the emergence of significant numbers of HA-1-specific T-cells in 3 of the 9 patients, 2 of them with RIC and 1 after conventional HCT. During the first 3 months after HCT, frequencies of up to 0.18% HA-1-specific T-cells occurred and increased further with time. In the first RIC patient frequencies of maximum 0.24% were detected and strong HA-1-specific reactions could be observed by Elispot after discontinuation of immunosuppression at day 1000 post HCT. The second RIC patient required continuous immunosuppression to control GvHD. After tapering CycA, increases in HA-1-specific T-cell frequency were associated with reduction of tumor cell burden (increase of donor CD34+ chimerism and decrease in leukemic host CD34+ cells). Contrary, augmented immunosuppression was associated with lower HA-1-specific T-cell numbers and reappearance of tumor cells. In this patient the fluctuations in HA-1-specific T-cell frequency were not detected by Elispot. The third patient had a maximum of 0.17% HA-1-specific T-cells 557 days post transplant while in molecular remission of the disease. T-cell lines were generated from PBMC of the 2 RIC patients and showed strong HA-1-specific reactions. Tetramer staining showed up to 77.2% HA-1-specific CD8+ T-cells in the cell lines after 6 weeks of culture. Conclusions: HA-1-specific immune reactions are observed in vivo after HA-1-mismatched HCT. Reactivity to HA-1 increases during the first 3 months after HCT and after discontinuation or reduction of immunosuppression. Tetramer staining is more sensitive than the Elispot Assay in monitoring the HA-1-specific immune response. T-cell lines can be established from PBMC of in vivo sensitized patients independent from the frequency of HA-1-specific T-cells.",

Hendriks, A. Schattenberg, F. Preijers, T. de Witte, N. Schaap Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (Nijmegen, NL) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens may be of benefit in older patients. However, the probability of relapse may be higher compared to patients transplanted with standard conditioning regimens. In addition the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) may be relatively high which may have impact on quality of life and late mortality. In this study we evaluated outcome of partial T cell-depleted allogeneic SCT together with pre-emptive and therapeutic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in 71 patients older than 50 years (median age, 55 years). Patients were transplanted for acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission (n = 24), acute lymphoid leukaemia in first and second remission (n = 4), chronic myeloid leukaemia in first chronic phase (n = 12), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (n = 4), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 16) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 11). The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg body weight, idarubicine 42 mg/m\u00b2 (in 64 patients) and total body irradiation 9 Gy (TBI). In 10 patients busulphan replaced TBI. Donors were HLA-identical siblings. Stem cells were derived from either bone marrow (n = 53, fixed dose of T lymphocytes: 0.7 x 10 6/ kg) or from peripheral blood (n = 18, fixed T cell dose: 0.1 x 10 6 /kg). Pre-emptive DLI was given to patients if they developed acute GVHD grade 1 without the occurrence of chronic GVHD. The median follow-up was 4.4 years (median, 0.5-10.0). After SCT, acute GVHD grade 2 occurred in 26% of patients. Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 16% of patients. 17 patients received pre-emptive DLI. 17 out of 21 relapsed patients after SCT were treated with therapeutic DLI and 9 of them responded. The two years probability of nonrelapse mortality was 29% in all patients. The 4 years probabilities of relapse, current relapse (defined as persisting or recurrent relapse after DLI), survival, leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and current LFS (defined as LFS after DLI) for all patients were 40% (molecular relapse included), 26%, 59%, 40% and 50% respectively. We conclude that T cell-depleted SCT combined with preemptive and therapeutic DLI is a feasible procedure in patients older than 50 years. The low incidence of extensive chronic GVHD (16%) and a plateau in the survival curve of these patients after median 2 years may exceed the results obtained by RIC transplantation strategies.",

In this study, we investigate the potential use of recombinant human IL-7 for facilitation of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by T cells following transplantation in a murine model. GVL effects were induced in (BALB/cxC57BL/6)F1 mice 24 hours after conditioning with Cyclophosphamide by transplantation of C57BL/6 spleen cells activated or na\u00efve with BCL1, followed by treatment of recipients with one or two cycles of IL-7 in vivo. Administration of IL-7 improved disease-free survival: 67% of mice treated with IL-7 remained alive and disease free >60 days, in comparison to 17% of the controls (p<0.05). Similar results were obtained when C57BL/6 spleen cells sensitized against irradiated BCL1 cells in the presence of IL-7 were transplanted to F1 mice, followed by IL-7 treatment in vivo. Of the BALB/c mice that received spleen cells from F1 mice treated with IL-7 following transplantation of C57BL/6 spleen cells sensitized with irradiated BCL1 in the presence of IL-7, only 29% developed leukemia, as compared to 79% in the control group (p<0.05). Mice treated with IL-7 showed increased splenic and thymic cellularity and improved T celldependent proliferative responses compared to the controls (p<0.05). Based on the murine data, IL-7 may provide a novel tool to enhance immune reconstitution following transplantation of mismatched stem cells, as well as for enhancement of GVL effects mediated by alloreactive lymphocytes.",

To provide rationale for GvL-enhancing immunotherapeutic strategies focused on such effectors, we performed an ex-vivo assessment of the functional status of early reconstituted, resting NK cells following HSCT by a novel CD107a degranulation assay. Methods: Blood samples at two different timepoints after HSCT -engraftment and day 60 -have been obtained from 12 patients undergoing HSCT for hematological malignancies. No GvHD was present at the time of sampling. To induce the degranulation of resting NK cells, whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and K562 erythroblastoid cell line were cocultured for 4h to 5h at a ratio of 10/1 respectively. Cells were subsequently immunostained with anti-CD3, anti-CD56, anti-CD107a fluorescence conjugated monoclonal antibodies and CD107a-positive NK cells were assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. For each sample, NK baseline degranulation was used as negative control. The degranulation potential of reconstituted NK cells was compared to the degranulation potential of NK cells obtained from healthy donors. Concomitantly to the degranulation assay, an extensive phenotypic profile -including natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) 1-2-3, killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs) -2DL1-2/3, NKG2A/D, CD16 -of resting, unmanipulated NK cells has been performed in an attempt to correlate specific phenotypic patterns to the NK functional state. Results: 1. At engraftment, early reconstituted, resting NK cells did not significantly differ from adult NK cells from healthy donors in terms of CD107a expression after K562-mediated triggering. 2. Patients could be divided in two groups according to the kinetic of expression of CD107a along reconstitution. In the first group (n=5), CD107a expression increased in the first two months following HSCT, while in the second (n=7) it decreased. The differential expression (ExpressionDay60-ExpressionEngraftment) of NCR2 (NKp30) was strictly related to the one of CD107a (r value: 0,9214; p <0,01). Conclusions: Early reconstituted NK cells after HLA-matched HSCT display lytic potential and might reveal promising targets for immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at the enhancement of GvL effect. Their functional state may vary over time and might be at least under the control of the up/down-regulation of NCR2. S185 busulfan/fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Results. In patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n=18), regardless of conditioning type, no relapse occurred following transplants meeting both, a high (above median) natural killer (NK) cell count and missing KIR ligand, compared to all other AML/MDS patients (0% vs. 44%; p=0.049). Quantitative graft composition was found to have significant impact exclusively in RIC transplants. Here, a trend towards reduced relapse incidence was found in patients receiving high numbers of NK cells (p=0.09). Overall survival (OS) was superior in recipients of high T cell numbers (p=0.01). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly reduced in patients receiving high T cell numbers (p=0.046). Multivariate analysis, including KIR-ligand matching, showed the probability of relapse to be significantly decreased only in patients receiving high NK cell numbers (p=0.039). Conclusion. These data suggest that both, the number of transplanted NK cells, and their KIR genotype in relation to the given HLA-type, play a role in the graft-versus-malignancy effect in HLA-identical PBSCT. Quantitative graft composition influenced outcome only in RIC transplants, while missing KIR ligand(s) improved the relapse incidence particularly in AML and MDS patients.

On average 27-32/25-34% DC in AML/MDS could be generated with 45-52/39-52% mature (CD83+) and 31-33/32-40% migratory (CCR7+) DC. 52-66/54-59% of those DC were leukemia-derived (DCleu); on average 43-48/43-49% of blasts were convertible to DCleu..

            "text": "(1st an 2nd authors contributed equally) Relapse remains the major cause of death after allogeneic transplantation in children with high risk malignancies. T cell mediated Graf versus host Disease (GvHD) has been shown to be associated with Graft versus Leukemia (GvL) effects, but also natural killer (NK) cells and other cells may exert cytotoxic activity. Thus, we evaluated the feasibility of low dose interleukin (IL) 2 therapy in patients with very high risk of relapse after transplantation of completely T cell depleted stem cells from matched unrelated (n=2) and mismatched related donors (n=9) and analyzed the effects on NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. Diagnoses and remission status: AML/MDS, n=5 (NR1, 2, or second transplantation), ALL, n=2 (NR, CR3), JMML, n=1 (NR), Ewing sarcoma, n=2 (NR1, NR2). No posttransplant GvHD prophylaxis was given. IL2 (1 Mio IU/square meter) was administered s.c. 3x/week for a median time of 73 days (15-250). 10 patients received IL 2 in order to prevent relapse, starting at day 41(13-77), one patient received IL2 after having relapsed, in combination with low dose chemotherapy. The regimen was well tolerated without severe side effects (transient fever (n=4), fatigue (n=3), local inflammation (n=4), possible induction of GvHD II-IV (n=2)). Cytotoxicity assays against the standard cell line K562 were performed in 9 patients (2-4 experiments per patient, 1-2, 3-4, 4-8, and 12-24 weeks after start of IL2). In 8/9 patients a high and stable NK cell mediated specific lysis of K 562 was observed (median lysis at E:T=20:1: 50%). In 5 patients, lysis during IL2 therapy was compared with the NK activity before IL2 administration: in 5/5 patients, NK activity was substantially enhanced by in vivo IL2 injections (11% pre IL2 vs. 41, 47, (3) (4) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . 7 patients relapsed despite treatment between 41 and 319 (median 100) days. 3/11 patients are disease free (4-5 years posttransplant). Conclusions: sustained, low dose IL2 administration is feasible in children after transplantation from alternative donors without severe side effects for several months. GvHD was induced only in two patients and a continuously high NK activity could be achieved. However, the majority (63%) of our very high risk patients relapsed. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of long-term administration of IL2. Treatment of patients with hematological malignancies and relapse or with primary refractory disease presents a therapeutic challenge. Results with direct allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are unsatisfactory and forced reinduction chemotherapy adds toxicity or can induce prolonged aplasia. Double allogeneic HSCT (dHSCT) may improve the antileukemic effect by the two conditioning regimens and add safety to the procedure by shortening the aplasia without GvHD by a first T-cell depleted HSCT. We followed this strategy over the last ten years in 25 selected patients with advanced disease (19 male, 6 female, median age 37 years, range 5-70). Inclusion criteria were informed consent and willingness of patients and donors as well as a sufficiently good general health status for such an intensive treatment. 17 patients received dHSCT after a previous HSCT (14 patients after one, 3 patients after 2 previous HSCT) after a median of 308 days (range 99-2212) and 8 patients as primary rescue therapy. The first dHSCT was based on intensive chemotherapy or high-dose melphalan; the second T-replete HSCT was performed immediately after recovery from the first HSCT (median 29 days, 24-61) and was based on TBI\u00b1chemotherapy or BuCy depending on prior irradiation or on BEAM-TBI in patients with HD. Donors were HLA-identical siblings for 22 patients, haploidentical donors for 2, and a syngeneic twin for 1 patient. Ten patients (40%) are still alive with a median follow-up of 390 days (27-3666). The 1-year probability of survival is 53% (95%-CI 33-74%). Five patients (20%) died of transplantrelated mortality (2 infections, 2 VOD, 1 heart failure), 10 patients (40%) died of relapse or progression despite this intesified procedure. Only one patient experienced grade II acute GvHD in between the dHSCT, 8 patients after the second dHSCT (maximal grade II). In conclusion, dHSCT can be performed with acceptable toxicity and TRM and may induce long-term remission in some patients. DHSCT might be further investigated as primary therapy for high risk or refractory leukemias.",

Fourteen patients with a sustained autologous documented hematopoiesis and lasting remission were identified. None of these received a second allogeneic graft after the autologous recovery. For two cases a donor lymphocytes infusion was used. The characteristics of the patients at transplantation were as followed: acute leukemia (AL = 5 in CR), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML = 3, one in acute phase and 2 Phi+ in chronic phase), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS = 4), CLL (n = 1, progressive disease), refractory myeloma (n =1); the conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 11 cases and non myeloablative in 3 cases. A transient engraftment was documented in 5 cases while no engraftment occurred in 9 cases. As of 02/06, only one patient (CML in acute phase) died because of relapse, one is lost to follow up and 10 are alive and in CR. The range time of CR after autologous reconstitution was 7,5 to 238 months (median 102 months). The remission in the 2 CML (chronic phase) patients after autologous reconstitution was not supported by imatinib treatment. While one cannot exclude that a least a proportion of the 14 patients were cured prior to alloSCT and/or that some of the remission were in relation with the conditioning regimen, this retrospective analysis data does suggest an efficient GvL effect can be observed without a sustained donor chimerism. The transient presence of donor T cells might indeed be sufficient to induce a powerful and long-lasting GvT effect.",

We hypothetized that NK cells activated by KIR receptors disparity as well as T-cells will mediate graft vs NB effect after mismatched SCT transplant. Seven pts (4 M, 3 F) with stage IV NB with bone and/or BM involvement underwent G-CSF mobilized haploSCT from 3/6 HLA mismatched relatives (3 mothers, 4 fathers). Five pts were in PR (MIBG I123 positive bony lesions), one had PD, one pt with recurrent disease 8 mo after autologous SCT was in 2nd CR after resection of solitary CNS metastasis. The median age of pair recipient/donor was 4.0 (2.5-9) and 33 (29-42) years, respectively. RIC regimen included Flu 180 mg/m\u00b2, and ATG 40 mg/kg in combination with Bu 8 mg/kg (n=5) or Treosulfan 30000 mg/m\u00b2 (n=2). The median numbers of CD34+ and CD3+ were 7.9 (2.9-35)x106/kg and 4.3 (2.7-6.7)x108/kg. Cells were infused after incubation with vincristine and methylprednisolone. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of 3 doses of MTX and cyclosporine A. Five pts developed GI and/or liver toxicity of stage>2. All pts engrafted with WBC>1.0x109/l on d11 (10-18), PLTs>20x109/l on d16 (13-100). Full donor chimerism (CC) was achieved by d30 in all pts and remained stable for all period of the follow-up. One pt did not develop any acute GvHD, 3 pts had gr. I GvHD, 1 pt had gr. II GvHD, and 2 pts had gr. III at 100 days after SCT. Acute GvHD was treated with steroids, MMF, ATG, MTX or cyclophosphamide. Three out of 4 long term survivors had localized chronic GvHD. One pt died on d +50 from interstitial pneumonia and VOD. Four pts progressed 1, 5, 5, and 5 mos. after graft. In all these pts immunosupression was stopped. GvHD reached gr. I in 1 and gr. II in 3 pts. Two pts died from DP in 2 and 12 mo. after SCT. Three pts are alive. One pt is in CR 12 mo after SCT (clearance of MIBG I123 5 mo post-SCT). Two pts with PD are alive with at 11 and 12 mo post-SCT. One of these pts is on low dose of MMF and received 5 courses of cis-retinoid acid. This pt has a SD in bone and BM. Another pt with brain metastasis relapsed in CNS 5 mos after SCT (5 metastases) and received 2 courses of CT and RT with a good response based on negative MIBG I123 scan. We conclude that haploidentical PBSCT with RIC regimen in NB pts with very poor prognosis is feasibleOur experience with using RIC in NB pts demonstrated evidence of graft vs NB effect and could be a promising approach to create a basis for immunotherapy.",

Lewalle, J. Kwan, J. Bennani, I. Ahmad, M. Aoun, D. Bron, R. Rouas, A. Delforge, P. Martiat Institut Bordet, ULB (Brussels, B) We initiated a three-step phase I study trying improve transplant related mortality, relapse rate and immunity: first G-CSF + DLI, secondly GM-CSF + DLI, and next patient and disease adapted strategy (step 3). This paper reports the outcome of the 25 evaluable patients included in step 3 which consists of a patient adapted strategy: no more aspecific DLI (only secondary prophylactic selective anti-CMV DLI) ; in myeloid disorders with NK allo-reactivity: no GF. In the other cases, GM-CSF (at a reduced total dose of 500 mcg) is given over 5 days. The follow-up range of these 25 patients is currently 40 to 3 months. Overall, TRM at day 100 was 4/25, reflecting the good tolerance of the conditioning in a heavily pre-treated population (median age : 38). NRR-mortality (7/25) at one year remains acceptable in such a group of patients and was higher in the GM-CSF group (5 vs 2), mainly due to a higher incidence of aGVHD and immunosuppressive therapy. More importantly, the overall relapse rate (6/25), equally balanced (3 vs 3) between the two group, strongly suggests a GVL effect induced by GM-CSF. The overall DFS is 13/25 with a median follow-up for patients at risk of 30 months, which is rather good in this type of patients. We conclude that our current strategy drastically improves the relapse rate in patients who do not benefit from NK allo-reactivity, at the expense of a higher incidence of GVHD. M.Y. Shapira, L. Weiss, S. Reich, M. Zeira, S. Slavin Hadassah University Hospital (Jerusalem, IL) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a modulator of the glutathione cellular content effects and a known antioxidant. In stem cell transplantation (SCT), NAC was suggested for prevention and treatment of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). We investigated wether it is safe to include NAC in the treatment of patients during and following SCT by assessment of the possible effect of NAC on lymphokine activated cells (LAK) activity and graft-vs.-leukemia effect (GVL) in murine models. After 10 days of either oral or intraperitoneal NAC treatment in doses in the range of treatment in humans, the cytotoxic activity of the LAK cells against Yac cells (H-2a, an NK sensitive tumor cell line) did not significantly differ from LAK activity generated from spleen cells obtained from untreated controls. However, NAC slightly suppressed GVL in animals transplanted from C57BL/6 into (BALB/c x C57BL/6) F1 and inoculated with BCL1 leukemia (the appearance of BCL1 leukemia in 8/36 animals treated with NAC as compared to 0/20 in the transplantation control group, p=0.023, figure 1 ). In spite of this mild GVL suppression, no negative effect on engraftment, as judged by achievement of donor chimerism, was seen. We conclude that though further clinical studies are warranted, the use of NAC in SCT seems relatively safe in regard to the GVL effect.",

Hubner (1) Acquired Severe Aplastic Anemia (aSAA) is a rare disease characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity. There is good clinical and laboratory evidence that a T-cell mediated immune attack against stem-and progenitor cells located in bone marrow plays an important role in the pathogenesis of aSAA. If aSAA is indeed mediated by antigen-specific lymphocytes, putative autoimmune T-cell clones should be dominantly expanded in bone marrow compared to peripheral blood. Thus, we characterized the Tcell receptor (TCR) repertoire in 3 newly diagnosed aSAA patients by V beta-/J beta specific PCR-based spectratyping analysis and compared the results with 3 age-matched healthy donors. In the bone marrow of aSAA patients we found an extremely skewed TCR-repertoire of CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes compared to the corresponding repertoire in peripheral blood as well as in bone marrow and blood of the healthy control group. In addition to the oligoclonal skewing we found even an unexpectedly high number of monoclonal expansions in bone marrow. Molecular analysis of 37 (CD4) and 55 (CD8) CDR3 regions of those Tcell clones did not reveal a) a preferential usage of specific V beta families b) J beta-segments and c) uncommon features in CDR3 sizes compared to V(D)J-rearranged sequences in the ImMunoGeneTics database. These findings allow us to analyze putatively new autoimmune T-cell clones in detail and provide further evidence that SAA is mediated by an strong autoimmune T-cell response.",

HLA-identical siblings marrow was used as the stem cell source in all patients.

Further prospective studies are needed to compare the outcome of this regimen with other accepted standard conditioning regimens for transplantation in aplastic anemia. Purpose: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are increasingly used for therapy of GvHD or immunosuppression in autoimmune diseases. It was hypothesized that MSC from aplastic anemia patients are less immunosuppressive thus allowing immunoreaction against autologous hematopoesis. While the immunosuppressive effect of healthy MSC can be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo models as well as in clinical studies there is uncertainty about the mechanism. Methods and Results: MSC from bone marrow were characterized by FACS (CD9+, CD44+, CD105+, CD34-, CD45-) and differentiation assays. In a standard mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) MSC in a ratio of 1:1 to the responder cells clearly suppressed the MLR reaction (80-100% reduction of proliferation). A 1:10 ratio of MSC:responders was not effective in most experiments and at a 1:100 ratio we never observed a suppressive effect. MSC from patients with aplastic anemia were studied for their immosuppressive potential. In all experiments (n=5) suppression of proliferation was observed contrary to the results of other groups (Bacigalupo A et al.Exp Hematol. 2005, 33:819) . In experiments with MSC supernatant we did not find any suppressive effect. In contrast there was some effect when we put the MSC in a transwell system (roughly 50% suppression of proliferation). Data in the literature on the mechanism are very controversial. Among others it was proposed that prostaglandin mediates the effect. However by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin and NS398 we could not reduce the MLR-suppressive effect of MSC. Currently we are investigating whether depletion of tryptophan plays an important role.",

HSCT leads to complete hematopoietic recovery and cure of disease in 60 to 80% of patients Materials and methods: During an 91 months period (from May 1998 to November 2005)69 patients with SAA (idiopathic:66,HPN:2,post hepatitis:1) received 72 allogenic HSCT and 3 boosts from HLA-identical sibling donors; median age 19 years (5 to 40), 36 patients under 20 years and 3 over 30 years; sex ratio:1,65; median interval from diagnosis to allograft 12,8 months (1,5 to 114); all patients were transfused but 47 (68,1%) had received more than 20 transfusions before allograft.Twenty four patients (43,8%) had previously immunosuppressive therapy failure. All patients received conditioning with procarbazine 37,5 mg/kg,Cy 200 mg/kg and ATG (Fresenius) 40 mg/kg and GVHD prophylaxis with methotrexate/cyclosporin (Seattle). Nine patients received bone marrow transplant (within one boost) of median mononuclear cells 4,32x10 /kg (range 2-7) and 60 patients peripheral blood stem cell (within 2 boosts and 3 additional transplant for 2 patients) of median CD34+cells 3,55x10 /kg(0,6-26). At September 2006 maximal follow up is 101 months and minimal 11 months. Results:The median time to engraftment was 20 days (10 to 32). Fifty two patients (75,4%) are alive with successful engraftment after median follow up 51 months (11 to 96 months). Four patients (5,8%) rejected graft and one patient is alive after successful second transplant.A late loss of stem cell transplant characterized by pancytopenia and successful hematopoietic complete recovery after boost was observed in 2 patients. Acute GVHD accured in 16 patients (25,8%) with 6 grade II-IV and chronic GVHD in 20 patients (37,7%), extensive in 10. Seventeen patients (24,6%) died: 14 (20,2%) of TRM (infectious:7, GVHD: 4, cerebral hemorrhage: 1, cardiomyopathy: 6, metabolic disorder: 1) and 3 after graft failure (4,3%). Chimerism data (PCR-STR) were available for 27 patients and all achieved 100% donor chimerism with median follow up 60,5 months (15,5 to 96 months). Actuarial overall survival is 75% at 8 years. Conclusion:Our results confirm that HSTC is the choice treatment for aquired severe aplastic anaemia patients under 30 years.",

Kreipe, J. Krauter, B. Hertenstein, A. Ganser, M. Eder Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) Introduction: Acquired bone marrow aplasia in adults may be due to rare diseases such as aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Patients and Methods: We report the outcome of allogeneic SCT for consecutive patients with AA (n=18), PNH (n=4, one aplastic patient), and hypoplastic MDS as defined by bone marrow histology (n=11). MDS patients were classified as RA (n=2), RCMD (n=3), RAEB (n=5, 2 with myelofibrosis), and unclassified MDS (n=1). Median age was 28.5 years (17-45) for AA and PNH, and 46 years (33-64) for MDS patients. Karyotyp was normal in 21 cases with AA/PNH; 6 and 3 of 9 evaluable MDS patients had unfavourable (monosomy 7) and intermediate cytogenetics, respectively. AA and PNH patients (13 patients pretreated by conventional immunosuppressive therapy) were transplanted with BM (n=18) or PBSC (n=4) from either matched (n=10), haploidentical (n=1) or syngeneic (n=2) family donors or matched (n=7) and mismatched (n=2) unrelated donors. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA/MTX (n=17), CSA/Pred (n=2), CSA and T-cell depletion (n=1) and none for both syngeneic transplantations. MDS patients were transplanted with BM (n=5) or PBSC (n=6) from matched related (n=5) or unrelated (n=6) donors. Seven patients received CSA/MTX, three CSA/MMF, and one CSA/Pred for GvHD prophylaxis. Conditioning for the AA/PNH-group varied depending on disease and donor type and mainly included cyclophsophamide/ATG (n=9) and fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/ATG with or without low-dose body irradiation (n=6). In the MDS-group eight patients received oral or iv busulfan/cyclophosphamide and three FLAMSA/TBI/Cy (Schmid et al. JCO, 2005) for conditioning. With a median follow-up of 39 months (range 4 -132) for the AA/PNH group all but one PNH patient have had favourable outcomes (> 95% survival) with high performance status independent of donor type and pre-treatment. Acute and chronic GvHD was observed in 35% and 21%. In contrast, survival for MDS patients was only 33% with a median followup of 16 months (range 10-102). All deaths were due to treatment related mortality. Acute and chronic GvHD occured in 50% and 59% of evaluable MDS patients, respectively. Conclusion: Whereas allogeneic SCT for AA has proven very successful independent of donor type and pre-treatment allogeneic SCT for patients with hypoplastic MDS results in much lower overall survival due to high post-transplant morbidity and mortality.",

Ryan St. James's Hospital (Dublin, IRL) Aplastic Anaemia is a haematological disorder characterised by failure of development of maturing blood cell precursors resulting in pancytopenia. Spontaneous marrow recovery is rare, and treatment options include immunosuppression and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We aimed to determine the outcome of patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in our centre. Method: We identified all patients with severe aplastic anaemia treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in St. James's Hospital. Their charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data, their conditioning regimens and establish their subsequent outcomes. End-points included chimerism status, full blood count and renal function at 1 year and also morbidity including renal impairment, graft versus host disease, bone density abnormalities and endocrine disturbance. Results: Between February 1987 and August 2005, 26 allogeneic bone marrow transplants were carried out on patients with severe aplastic anaemia (15 male and 11 female). The average age at transplantation was 18years (median 17 years, range 12-31 years). Follow-up was for an average of 8 years (median follow-up 10 years, range 4-19 years). The most commonly used conditioning regimen was Cyclophosphamide/ATG. Chimera analysis at one year posttransplant revealed complete donor chimera in 10 patients, 3 of whom had graft versus host disease. 11 patients had a mixed chimera profile and a further 2 displayed complete recipient reconstitution. Persistent pancytopenia was seen in 3 patients with a mixed chimeric profile, all of whom had a chimera of less than 95%.",

Argiolu Ospedale per le Microcitemie (Cagliari, I) Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder associated with congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure and increased risk of leukaemia and other cancers. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is presently the best treatment for FA patients developing bone marrow failure. Success for HSCT in patients with an HLA identical sibling donor is 70%, whereas in those transplanted from an unrelated donor figures are reported in the range of 29-43%, with graft rejection, GvHD and regimen related toxicity being the main causes of failure. These results have limited the ability to perform marrow transplantation other than with HLA identical siblings for this disease. Recently a fludarabine (FLU) based cytoreductive regimen has been successfully used in T cell depleted haploidentical/mismatched transplant of FA patients. Between June 1999 and September 2005, four patients with FA (three with bone marrow failure and one with MDS) underwent HSCT in Cagliari. Patients' characteristics, conditioning regimen and outcome are shown in Table 1 . Conclusions. All three patients transplanted with reduced doses of Cyclophosphamide (CY), FLU and ATG (Thymoglobuline) engrafted promptly, achieved full haematopoietic chimerism (VNTR mean 13 days) and adequate immunological recovery. Neither patient developed toxicity, nor GvHD. UPN 77, transplanted with a more aggressive preparatory regimen for the development of clonal disease (MDS), showed erythroderma and acute/chronic limited GvHD. Fludarabine-based regimen could also be proposed to cure FA patients with clonal disease and without an HLA matched donor, decreasing the long term side effects of other more toxic regimens.",

F\u00fchrer (1) Since the results of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from matched unrelated donors (MUD) have improved in severe aplastic anemia (SAA), BMT from MUD has become an accepted second line therapy for children not responding to the first course of immunosuppressive therapy (IST). However, non-engraftment and early rejection are still important reasons for treatment failure and death. Because of the high risk for lethal bacterial or fungal infections, immediate re-transplantation must be considered. In this situation the conditioning regimen should be highly immunoablative to allow for engraftment but less toxic to prevent acute tissue damage and consecutive increase of the risk for graft-versus host disease (GVHD). We report on three patients (pts.) who developed SAA at age 7, 11 and 17 years and underwent MUD BMT 12, 94 and 120 months after 1 -2 unsuccessful courses of combined IST with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CSA). Two pts. received unmanipulated BM from a 8 and 9/10 compatible donor (2,4 and 1,3 x 106 CD34 positive cells/kg BW) respectively, one patient received T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from a 10/10 matched donor (4,5 x 106 CD34, 10,4 x 104 CD3 pos. cells/kg BW). Conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (Cy), Flud-Arabin and serotherapy. The pt. with the T-depleted graft received 2 x 2.5 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in addition. All three pts. rejected their graft and were successfully regrafted from the same donor after an intensive immunablative conditioning based on Cy (2 x 60 mg/kg), Flud-Arabin and serotherapy with OKT3 \u00b1 ATG. The graft consisted of unmanipulated PBSC in all three pts. (8.1, 8.7 and 11.6 CD34/kg BW). No significant toxicity was seen after the 2nd transplant. All three pts. showed prompt (range 10 -13 days) and stable engraftment with complete donor chimerism. Two pts. developed mild acute GvHD (I-II) of the skin, and one pt. suffers from limited chronic GvHD. We conclude that in young pts. with SAA re-transplantation from the same MUD after non-engraftment or early graft failure can be performed successfully with unmanipulated PBSC after an immunoablative conditioning regimen containing Cy, Flud-Arabin and OKT3 alone or in combination with ATG. Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (STC) is curative in patients (pts) with Thalassemia major with outcome depending on age and disease status at SCT. We report here our experience. Patients and methods: from January 1998 to July 2006, 62 cases of SCT were performed on 59 pts with a-Thalassemia; 7 pts had hepatitis C with stable liver condition. Conditioning was with one of 2 regimens, regimen A (24 pts): Busulfan (BU), Cyclophosphamide (CY) and anti-thymocyte globulins, and regimen B (38 pts): BU/CY only. GvHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporine and methotrexate in both regimens; those undergoing second SCT were conditioned with CY and total body irradiation (TBI). Median age at SCT was 5 years (range, 1.5-13.9 years). Pts were classified according to disease severity; mild (23 pts), moderate (25 pts) and severe (12) based on hepatomegaly, regular transfusion and chelation plus the level of ferritin. The source of stem cells was unmanipulated marrows from HLA-matched related donors; the median CD34+ cells was 7 x 10 6 /kg (range, 1.6-17 x 10 6 /kg). Engraftment was assessed by VNTR/STR or FISH. Results: All pts engrafted; median time to ANC of 0.5 x 10 9 /l was 20 days (range, 11-29 days) and median time to self sustained platelet count of 20 x 10 9 /l was 31 days (range, 16-68 days). Donor chimerism ranged from 59 % to 100 %. The 5 year probability of overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for all pts was 94% and 77% respectively. The 5-year probability of OS and EFS for pts with mild disease was 96% and 83% respectively and for pts with moderate and severe disease the 5-year probability of OS and EFS was 89% and 73% respectively. All pts with hepatitis C had stable liver condition post SCT and remain alive; with only one graft rejection. Pts who had second SCT remain alive and free of disease at (271, 503, and 1449 days post SCT for the 3 pts. The incidence of grade III-IV GvHD was 25% in pts with severe disease, 20% in pts with moderate disease and 13% for pts mild disease, graft rejection rate was 25% in pts with severe disease and 13 % in pts with mild disease. Conclusion: The outcome of allogeneic SCT at KFSHRC is satisfactory.",

            "text": "Unusual late rejection of the first graft seven years after allogeneic transplant for thalassaemia successfully treated with second BMT C. Giardini (1) We report an unusual case of late rejection with autologous reconstitution after BMT for thalassemia. A three years old female patient was submitted to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on February 1998 for Thalassemia major (Class of risk 1) from her HLA identical brother. Conditioning regimen consisted of Busulfan 16 mg/kg and Cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg. The post-transplant course was uncomplicated, with only a grade 1 skin acute GvHD. After hematological reconstitution, sexual chromosome marker has been repeatedly studied to follow an incomplete donor engraftment, with a persistent and increasing percentage of recipient cells documented on bone marrow. Despite this progressive decrement of donor cells percentage, the patient maintained a Hemoglobin level between 10 to 11 and she was transfusion-free and free of symptoms of the genetic disease until late 2005, when the patient was again referred to us for progressive anemization. At that time, the donor chimerism was found to be only 5% and the patient became again transfusion-dependent. On May 2006 the patient has been submitted to a second transplant using the same HLA identical family donor. The conditioning regimen consisted on: THIOTHEPA 8 mg/kg, TREOSULFAN 14 g/mq/day for 3 days, FLUDARABINE 40 mg/mq/day for 3 days. The post-transplant course was again uncomplicated with no evidence of acute GvHD. The posttransplant chimerism study showed: Day +21: 100% donor cells; 6 months after BMT: 92% donor cells. The patient is continuing the post-transplant follow-up and Cyclosporine tapering. Conclusions: This is the latest rejection with autologous reconstitution ever documented after a transplant in Thalassemia. The progressive loss of the allogeneic graft is really unusual even in mixed chimeras, where the situation of mixed chimerism is generally considered to be \"persistent\" and stable after one year of post-transplant follow-up. Although the follow-up after the second BMT is still short, the conditioning regimen employed (without the use of Cyclophosphamide) leads to eradication of the thalassemic marrow without significant organ toxicity and is considered promising for further clinical investigation. Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia (CHH) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, caused by mutations in the RMPR gene, characterised by prenatal onset of growth failure with metaphyseal chrondrodysplasia and different grades of immunodeficiency. Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) has been suggested for rare patients presenting with severe immunodeficiency. Here, we summarise the indications, complications, outcome and immune reconstitution in six patients from 3 centres after HSCT. See table for the details. All patients received Busulfan-based conditioning and replete marrow. All achieved full donor chimerism. Normal T and B cell numbers were achieved. T-cell function with normalization of mitogen-and antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation was seen in all patients. Immunoglobulin levels were normal in 2 patients, whereas 3 patients exhibit continuous absent production of IgA. Specific antibody production against protein and polysaccharide antigens has normalized in all 5 surviving patients. Autoimmune phenomena disappeared after successful HSCT. As yet, no secondary malignancy has been observed. We conclude that HSCT treatment is successful at correcting the immunodeficiency in patients with CHH. These patients may have immunological investigations that are reassuringly normal, but experience infections that are more significant and serious than the immunological function would suggest. Careful clinical evaluation is necessary, and in patients with clinical evidence of immunodeficiency, HSCT should be performed before severe organ damage, severe autoimmune phenomena or malignancy occur to avoid-transplant related mortality. Hurler Syndrome is corrected by allogeneic BMT by the action of donor enzyme on recipient tissue. In this paper we describe monitoring of 39 patients transplanted in 2 centres to determine donor chimerism, enzyme level and residual substrate -expressed as dermatan sulphate to chondroitin sulphate ratio. We show that in fully engrafted recipients the enzyme level, expressed as \u00b5mol/g total protein/hr, post transplant is 24.2 from an unrelated donor and 10.2 from a heterozygote family donor (P<0.0001). There is a tight relationship between mean post-transplant enzyme level and residual substrate -Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Rho) was -0.76 and -0.80 at 12 and 24 months respectively (P<0.0001). We propose that these differences affect patient outcome. As unrelated donor transplant outcomes improve and especially given the higher levels of donor cell engraftment following cord transplants our data might influence donor selection.",

G\u00fcng\u00f6r (1) The prognosis of children with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency after HSCT is poor because of a high incidence of transplant-related lethal complications and rejection. Five children (1-6 years) with proven PNPdeficiency (with mild to moderate neurological symptoms), opportunistic viral infections, or autoimmune disease (AIHA, ITP) received reduced toxicity (n=4) or myeloablative (n=1) conditioning regimens using alternative donors. In 3 of 5 patients, reduced intensity conditioning regimens comprised fludarabine (5 x 30 mg/qm), melphalan (140 mg/qm) and in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit ATG-Genzyme (4 x 5 mg/kg) or Campath IH (5 x 0.2 mg/kg) followed by transplantation of maternal HLA-phenoidentical BM (pat. 1), haploidentical T-cell depleted (pat. 2) and paternal HLA phenoidentical PBSC (pat. 5). The second low-toxicity conditioning regimen used, consisted of intravenous busulfan (13.2 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), rabbit ATG-Fresenius (40 mg/kg) and PBSC from a MUD donor (pat. 3). Full myeloablative conditioning with busulfan (16 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) together with in vitro T cell depletion of a MUD BM transplant using Campath 1M (with T cell addback) and in vivo T-cell depletion using Campath IG was used in patient 4. After timely hematopoietic engraftment and completed T-cell reconstitution, persisting viral and autoimmune diseases resolved. Because of decreasing donor chimerism, patient 1 received a single DLI infusion; while patient 2 required boosting with haploidentical stem cells (SCB) after a single dose of melphalan (140 mg/qm). All patients achieved full long-term donor chimerism except patient 4 who shows stable mixed chimerism (23 % donor) 9 years after MUD transplant. Patient 5 developed GVHD grade III of the gut with good response to therapy. After a follow-up period of 54-171 months, all patients are alive and well without signs of chronic GHVD and with completed T-and B-cell immune reconstitution. PNP activity of red cells is normal in all patients except in patient 4 with pre BMT levels in red cells but normal levels in leukocytes. Low toxicity conditioning regimens using alternative donors are feasible in high-risk children with PNP-deficiency. Autologous reconstitution still remains a complicating factor, however DLI or SCB therapy are appropriate to induce long-term sustained full donor chimerism. Importantly, neurological PNP-related disease did not progress after HSCT.",

Slatter (1) Introduction: Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) are primary T cell differentiation defects with/out defects in B and NK cells. Results from treatment by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have improved over the past two decades due to better diagnosis, stem cell sources, chemotherapy conditioning regimens and new methods for detecting and treating viral and fungal infection. For many patients without an HLA-identical relative or unrelated donor, T cell depleted (TCD) haplo-identical family transplants have been successful with survival rates of 80-90% over the last 5 years. Methods to remove viable T cells from the graft include addition of anti-CD52 antibodies and, more recently, CD34+ positive HSC-selection with magnetic bead-labelled antibodies. We have previously presented results of long-term follow up of children who received anti-CD52 TCD marrow between 1987-19981. We compared the quality of engraftment in these patients with more recent patients who received CD34+ positive HSC-selected product. Methods: Survivors with SCID who received CD52 TCD or CD34+ HSC-selected HSCT were reviewed. Chimerism, T and B cell subsets, and immunoglobulin level at last follow up, were examined. The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA analyses were used to determine differences between groups. Results: 19 patients received CD52-treated, 19 received CD34-treated HSC. There were no statistically significant differences in myeloid chimerism, T cell numbers, new thymic emigrants, B cell or memory B cell numbers. There was no significant difference in donor B cell chimerism between the groups. The only significant difference was that more patients who received CD52-treated HSC had IgG class-switched B cells (p=0.023) and discontinued IVIG (0.049) than CD34treated patients. More patients with common gamma chain (CgC) or JAK3 SCID in the CD52-treated group had donor B cells (4/5) than similar patients in the CD34-treated group (1/10), although patient numbers were small (p=0.054). Conclusion: There appear to be no long-term differences in immune reconstitution or chimerism between patients receiving CD52-or CD34-treated HSC. Differences in B cell function/IVIG requirement are likely due to uneven patient mix between groups, with more CgC/JAK3 patients in the CD34treated group, most having dysfunctional recipient B cells. Objective: Malignant infantile osteopetrosis (MIOP) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by dysfunctional osteoclasts, leading to thickened bony trabeculae, decreased bone marrow space, and eventually bone marrow failure. Clinically, MIOP children have classic facial features, such as macrocephaly, frontal bossing and microagnathia, and a small thorax, all due to the lack of bone remodeling. These features may potentially place these children at significant risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic hypoxemia, and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, to objectively document OSA and determine the extent, a comprehensive airway evaluation was performed with results impacting management.",

            "text": "Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 7 patients with MIOP treated at St. Jude. To evaluate for OSA, 6 children underwent polysomnograms during the prehematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) evaluation; one patient had the initial polysomnogram 3 years after HSCT. To determine the existence of a relationship between OSA and radiological imaging, initial chest radiographs were given a severity score by a single radiologist and bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by QCT in 5 children and resulted as a Z-score. Results: Pre-HSCT patients had a median respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of 17.51 (range, 6.67 -25.28; normal 0-2), indicating OSA, and a median minimal oxygen saturation of 79% (range, 68%-88%), indicating intermittent hypoxemia. For those who had BMD studies, the median Z-score was 27.3 (range, 22.4-32.6). Neither the chest radiograph score nor the BMD correlated with the severity of the OSA measured by the RDI. Four patients received tracheostomies either prior to or during the peri-HSCT period, and 2 underwent tonsillectomy/ adenoidectomy pre-HSCT. Three surviving children underwent polysomnograms at least a year post-HSCT and had a median RDI of 1.3 (range, 0.46-2.3), indicating near to complete resolution of OSA. Conclusions: Using a quantitative approach, our study demonstrates that MIOP children have significant OSA and hypoxemia, which is unrelated to their BMD. Upon successful HSCT, OSA resolves but these children may benefit from aggressive airway management prior to HSCT. Severe OSA is a not a contraindication for HSCT in MIOP children, but aggressive airway evaluation and management pre-HSCT may reduce the risk of life-threatening pulmonary complications known to occur during HSCT.",

Tono (1) X-linked recessive anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (XL-EDA-ID) is a developmental and immunologic disorder caused by hypomorphic mutations in the nuclear factor-k B essential modulator (NEMO) gene. Affected boys are susceptible to infections with various microorganisms, mostly pyogenic bacteria and mycobacteria. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is thought to be the only curative treatment, but successful SCT has not yet been reported, one of the probable reasons was concern for regimen related toxicity due to their increase in apoptosis. We here report the first successful treatment of the disorder by SCT. The patient was a 3-year-old boy, born from mother with mild incontinentia pigmenti. He had frequent episodes of bacterial enterocolitis and sepsis. Mutation analysis revealed NEMO mutation (1167 insC) in both the patient and his mother. Flow cytometry analysis showed lower NEMO expression in each PBMC lineage, and CD40L induced less up-regulation of CD23, CD54, CD86, and CD95 in the patient's cells. The patient did not have an HLA-matched related or unrelated bone marrow donor. At 2.5 years of age, he suffered severe pyloric stenosis following gastric ulcers and Candida glabrata sepsis. For this life threatening episode, an unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) was performed at 3 years of age after written consent was obtained from his parents. Pretransplant conditioning consisted of fludarabin (30 mg/m\u00b2/d) from day -7 to day -3, melpharan (70 mg/m\u00b2/d) from day -6 to day -5, and rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) (2.5 mg/kg/d) from day -5 to day -1. The patient received 4.6 x 10 7 total nucleated cells/kg from a male donor. The recipient and the donor were one antigen mismatched by serology. GvHD-prophylaxis was planned with FK506 and MTX, but MTX was quitted after the second administration since it caused severe hepatic toxicity. Engraftment was documented on day +19, with an absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10 9 cells/L. Following uneventful engraftment with just grade 1 acute GvHD, NEMO protein expression was normalized and cytokine response was significantly improved. Lineage-specific genetic analysis confirmed full donor chimerism. Ten months after UCBT, the patient is in perfect performance status. This outcome shows that correction of immunodeficiency associated with NEMO mutation is possible by SCT with a reduced-intensity regimen and UCB can be a suitable alternative source for affected patients.",

Elhasid (1) Background: Deficiency of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) results in progressive fatal mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease, clinically defined by gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, peripheral neuropathy, white-matter changes in brain MRI. The cause for this disease is believed to be the toxic accumulation of thymidine and deoxyuridine which generate imbalanced mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphopahte pool, which in turn is responsible for the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutagenesis and depletion. The appeal of TP deficiency as a candidate disease for curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) arose from the clinical observation that infusions of platelets, which contain abundant functional TP, reduced circulating levels of thymidine and deoxyuridine in 3 patients. Methods and results: A 10-year old patient with MNGIE disease underwent HSCT from her HLA identical mother. Conditioning regimen included: busulphan 16mg/kg, cyclophosphamide 200mg/kg, anti thymocyte globulin (ATG, Fresenius) 25mg/kg, and fludarabine 200mg/kg. In order to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), moderate T cell depletion, giving 10 5 /kg donor T cells, was performed using positive selection of CD34 cells by immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). On day 0 she received 10.5 x 10 6 /kg CD34 cells and 10 5 /kg T cells.",

Concomitant with engraftment, 12 days post transplantation, the concentration of serum thymidine and deoxyuridine declined markedly, and became undetectable 27 days following transplantation. Six months later signs of cachexia disappeared and she gained 9kg. Acute GVHD grade II (eosinophilia, skin rash and mild diarrhea) occurred 40 days post transplantation and was treated with prednisone 2mg/kg with prompt response. Later she developed chronic GVHD treated with cyclosporine, prednisone and photopheresis with improvement. She is now 15 months post transplantation with stable GVHD and complete donor chimerism. Conclusion: These results constitute a proof of concept that restoration of TP activity by HSCT can ameliorate biochemical imbalances that cause the disease. The weight gain could indicate improvement in gastrointestinal function. Close clinical follow-up is needed to evaluate the long-term, multisystemic efficacy of this treatment.",

As of June 2006, 491 MPS I patients were enrolled in the Registry with 110 (26%) reporting to ever having received Haematological Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and 85 (77%) reported a date for HSCT within the selected time interval of 1995 to 2006. Of these 85 patients, 27 (32%) also received enzyme replacement therapy, and 22 patients with a mean time of 5 months prior to HSCT. Seventy four (87%) of the 85 patients reported a 1st transplant prior to age 2, with 23 (27%) reporting a transplant before the age of 1 and 51 (60%) reporting a transplant between age 1 and 2.

Corti (1) Cardiac involvement is common in mucopolysaccharidosis I-H (MPS I-H). In untreated patients it contributes to the relentlessy lethal course of the disease. Eight children (1 M, 7 F), diagnosed with MPS I-H (median age 1.2 yrs, range 0.5-1.5), were referred to our center for HCT. They underwent echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter. A scoring system that combined echocardiogram findings was used to determine cardiac severity scores (3-point scale for each cardiac anomaly: 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe) at baseline and at latest evaluation. Cardiac involvement was present in 6 pts. before HCT (requiring standard cardiac medications in 4) with a cardiac severity score ranging from 1 to 3.5. The most common finding was involvement of the mitral valve (present in 6), often associated with aortic valve insufficiency (in 5), asymmetric septal hypertrophy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (in 3), pericardial effusion (in 2) and tricuspid valve involvement (in 1). Median age at HCT was 1.7 yrs (range 1.2-2.5); the 2 most recent cases received enzymatic replacement therapy from diagnosis to 1 month after HCT, when normal endogenous enzymatic activity was detected. Conditioning regimen was BuCy and ATG; fludarabine was added in 3 cases (2 of them at 2nd HCT). HCT was performed in all, but one, cases from an unrelated donor (URD). Two patients, after graft rejection (8 and 11 months after HCT), successfully underwent a 2nd URD-HCT (13 and 20 months after the first transplant). One patient died 1 year after HCT from a matched family donor, for immune complications during rejection. Normal enzymatic activity level and stable complete (in 6) or partial (in 1) chimerism have been periodically documented in the 7 survivors. The follow-up after HCT is too short in 2 patients for assessing HCT long-term impact on heart function; in the other 5 patient (median age 7.9 yrs, range 7.0-8.5; median post-HCT follow-up 6.2 yrs, range 5.4-6.9), cardiac impairment continued to mildly progress over the first 2 years following HCT (median cardiac severity score 4.5, range 3.5-5.5), but then stabilised in 3 and even improved in 2 cases (median cardiac severity score 4.0, range 1.5-4.5); at the latest follow-up only 2 patients require cardiac medications.",

Darbyshire Birmingham Children's Hospital, UK (Birmingham, UK) We present a single-centre experience of haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with metabolic disorders. 19 children with various metabolic disorders (osteopetrosis-8, Adrenoleukodystrophy(ALD)-5, congenital erythropoietic porphyria-1, Hurler's syndrome-2, Mannosidosis-2, Glycogen storage disease-1) received HSCT between 1991 HSCT between -2006 HSCT between (14 between 2000 HSCT between -2006 . There were 14 males and 5 females. Median age at HSCT was 18 months (range 2 months to 13 years). 6 had matched unrelated donor graft, 1 had haploidentical PBSC graft, which was TCell depleted (TCD) before re-infusion & 12 received HSCT from matched family donors, parent-6, siblings-4, sibling cord-2. Most received similar conditioning regimen: Fludarabine, Busulphan &cyclophosphamide .3 patients who had multiple HSCT received slightly different conditioning regimen. None of our patients had any conditioning related toxicity. All engrafted within 2-3 weeks post-HSCT. 3 patients rejected their first HSCT between 1-8 weeks post engraftment. 2 had a second successful transplant from the same donor. 1 patient had multiple HSCT, and presently is well 2 years post his successful HSCT. 1 patient who received haploidentical PBSC from mother, became mixed chimaeric but became fully donor chimaeric following use of fludarabine and DLI. Our observed rejection rate is 15%. 15 alive patients are mainly/fully donor chimaeric and well after a median follow up of 4 years (range 5 months-15 yrs). 4 patients died (ALD-2, osteopetrosis-2) within 6-16 weeks post transplant due to disease progression (ALD) and infection related complications. Mortality was observed more frequently amongst the older patients. Children who died were aged 3 months, 8, 10 and 13 years each.6 of 18 (33%) had grade 2-4 graft versus host disease (GVHD) involving skin, gut, liver or a combination. Steroids were used to treat GVHD in all patients, and in 2 patients immunosuppressive therapy was changed from cyclosporin to tacrolimus. All 15 patients alive are also disease free with resolution/improvement/stabilisation of preHSCT disease related symptoms including normalisation of blood counts, reduced infections and progression in previous delayed development. Conclusion: Our single centre experience shows that HSCT even with alternative donors, is successful in metabolic disorders . Early diagnosis and early transplantation with specialists in metabolic disorders involved in decision making will probably result with best outcomes. Allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can provide a lifelong correction of the enzymatic deficiency in lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). Here, we report the follow-up on nine children with LSD transplanted with a fludarabine based conditioning regimen that includes T-cell depletion for all MUD and MMFD transplantations (Grigull et al. BMT 2005) . Patients: 8 patients had Hurler's disease (MPS1H) and one alpha-Mannosidosis (MAN). By the time of SCT the children were 10 months to 3.75 years old. MPS1H and MAN were diagnosed clinically and by reduced leukocyte alpha-iduronidase or mannosidase activity, respectively The preparative regimen consisted of busulfan, fludarabine and anti-thymocyte globuline. For MMFD and MUD transplantations, melphalan was added. 1 patient was transplanted with full bone marrow from an HLAidentical sibling donor, GVHD-prophylaxis was CSA+MTX. 3 patients were transplanted from their haploidentical mothers and 5 from unrelated donors, all received CD-34+-selected PBSC (CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotech), mean CD34+ cell doses were 37.3 x 106/kg (range 10,0-54,8), residual CD3+ cell content was 3.8 x 104/kg (range 0,0-5.4). 7 patients had no post-transplant immunosuppression, 1 received MMF because of a residual CD3+ cell number of > 5 x 104/kg. Results: All children are alive 3 months to 5 years after SCT and show donor-derived hematopoiesis. PMN > 0.5/nl was seen after 15.3 days (range 10-21), platelet counts > 50/nl were reached after 16.5 days (range 9-25). The patient with MAN rejected and required re-transplantation and a T-cell boost. No GvHD > grade I occurred, no toxicity > grade II was seen in the MPS1H-patients, the MAN patient required intensive care for a systemic inflammatory response during his graft rejection. 1 MPS1H patient developed a subdural hematoma on day 6 after SCT necessitating surgical removal. In 6 children, complete donor chimerism was achieved; 3 patients have mixed chimerism. In 3 patients, donorlymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given to stabilize or convert mixed to full chimerism. Conclusion: SCT is the therapy of choice in children with MPS1H. This follow-up shows that a fludarabine based conditioning regimen in combination with a CD34-selected graft is safe, non-toxic and effective in achieving stable engraftment in MPS-1H. More patients are needed to answer the question whether these results can be reproduced in MAN-patients.",

Mialou (1) Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the best therapy to cure children with combined immunodeficiency. However, previous opportunistic infection and organ dysfunction can be a barrier to the success of the transplant procedure with high infectious and toxic mortality. Methods: A 9-year-old boy presented in early childhood with Hyper IgM syndrome without CD40 ligand deficiency. Despite immunoglobulin substitution, continuous prophylactic and curative antibiotics, he presented with many complications consisting of bronchiectasis, severe cryptosporidiosis with admission in intensive care unit for 15 days, asymptomatic viral infection with CMV and EBV (increasing viral load) and adenovirus gut infection and severe immunologic deficiency (with CD3+:1100/\u00b5l, CD4+: 200/\u00b5l and IgM: 1.02 g/l) There was no HLA identical familial donor and due to the poor general condition we decided to peform an unrelated HSCT with a 4/6 HLA cord blood and reduced intensity conditioning with Fludarabine (150 mg/m\u00b2), melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2) and Anti-thymocytes globulin (10 mg/Kg). Cyclosporine and corticosteroids were used as GVH prophylaxis. Anti-infectious prophylaxis consisted in a laminar airflow room, bactrim as pneumocystis prophylaxis, gut decontamination, weekly Ig substitution, cidofovir to prevent CMV and adenovirus infection and prophylactic anti-CD20 to prevent EBV lymphoproliferative disease. Cryptosporidiosis was treated with nitazoxanide and azithromycine. Results: Haematologic recovery occured at day 30 with a complete chimerism (100% donors cells) at day 32. There was no metablic or toxic complication and the HSCT was only complicated only by a CMV reactivation (increased viral load) which was treated by switch from cidofavir to foscarnet and ganciclovir. Six months after HSCT this boy was alive and well, without any infectious disease. Treatment for cryptosporidiosis was withdrawn. Immune reconstitution status showed CD3+: 700/\u00b5l, CD4+: 150/\u00b5l and CD19+ B cell count at 250/\u00b5l) with a 100% donor chimerism. Conclusion: The prophylactic use of anti-viral and anti-CD20 injection can avoid the risk of severe viral reactivation in a very immunocompromised child during a HSCT procedure with a RIC regimen and a cord blood transplant.",

Malcus (1) Objectives: MHC class II deficiency (MHCII-Def) is a severe immunodeficiency characterized by deficient T helper celldependent immunity. The curative treatment of this immunodeficiency consists of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the success rate of early immunological recovery in this disease is poor. Moreover, it has been suggested that T-cell immunity may be impaired later in life because of long-term graft failure or accelerated loss of thymus output. To address this issue, we compared immunological parameters of 2 MHCII-Def sibling patients (P1 and P2) with those of their HLA-identical sibling donors (D1 and D2). One of the patients (P2) presented long-term impaired immune reconstitution with autoimmune disease (Evans's syndrome). During the late follow-up care, P2 was treated by anti-CD20. Methods: P1 and P2 received respectively bone marrow and cord blood transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors D1 and D2, in 1998 and 1995 after a conditioning regimen consisting of Busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Eight and eleven years after HSCT, chimerism (in P1 and P2), qualitative and quantitative T receptor Vbeta family complementary-determining region 3 sequence mRNA (TCRV-b CDR) analysis (TcLandscape\u00ae), lymphocyte subtypes (T, B, NK, CD45RA, CD31, CD45RO, DR, flow cytometry FC500\u00ae Beckman-Coulter) and lymphocyte specific proliferation were assessed in P1, P2, D1 and D2. Results: The chimerism analysis revealed that P1 cells were all of donor origin whereas in P2, cells were mixed recipient/donor origin (70% cells from donor and 8% CD3 cells from the recipient). P1 and P2 had quasi-normal standard lymphocyte subset values and normal MHCII expression but P2 had no B cell and his specific proliferative T cell response was not observed. In P2, TCRV-b CDR was more skewed (6/26 altered V-b families vs. P1 2/26, D1 3/26 and D2 1/26) and less up-regulated (1/26 V-b families vs. P1 5/26, D1 3/26 and P2 6/26). Moreover recent thymic emigrant (RTE) CD4 cells (CD31+CD45RA+CD4+) were deeply decreased in P2 compared with P1, D1 and D2 RTE (2% vs. 17%, 41% and 31% respectively). Conclusion: Chimerism analysis showed different patterns of engraftment in the two patients. Slight alterations of immunological parameters were found in both patients P1 and P2 compared with sibling donors. But only, the very low thymic lymphocyte output evaluated by RTE CD4+ cells could account for the worse long term immune reconstitution observed in P2 patient.",

Wake, N. Uchida, S. Takagi, D. Kato, H. Yamamoto, Y. Matsuhashi, S. Seo, N. Matsuno, K. Masuoka, S. Miyakoshi, A. Yoneyama, S. Taniguchi Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Objectives: Non-infectious pulmonary complications (NIPC) are fatal disorders following allogeneic SCT. NIPCs includes idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), which occurs early period, and late onset NIPCs (LONIPCs) such as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), and interstitial pneumonia (IP). There has been little information on NIPCs following cord blood transplantation (CBT). We tried to characterize NIPCs after CBT by estimating the incidence, types of NIPC, and prognosis, and to identify risk factors for them. Methods: We reviewed medical records of 223 patients with hematological diseases who had received CBT between Jan. 2002 and Dec. 2005 at Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Median age was 55 years (17 E9). Most of them had diseases in advanced status (n=198). Median follow-up time was 601 days (111-1544). Most of our pre-transplant conditioning were reduced intensity consisted of fludarabine, melphalan and TBI 4Gy (n=189). Cyclosporine (CSP) (n=97) or tacrolimus (Tac) alone (n=126) were used as GVHD prophylaxis. HLA disparities were as follows; 6/6 (n=6), 5/6 (n=47), 4/6 (n=174), and 3/6 (n=2). Diagnosis was made by Chest X-ray, computed tomography, broncho-alveolar lavage and pulmonary function test. Results: The incidence of IPS was 20.6% (n=46), with median onset of 17 days post-transplant (2-57). Among IPS patients, 17 cases were accompanied by pleural effusion. LONIPCs were observed in 13 cases (5.8%), including 3 cases of COP, 8 cases of IP, and 2 cases of BO. Multivariate analysis revealed 3 risk factors for NIPC; GVHD prophylaxis with CSP over Tac (p=0.036, RR 1.65), grade III-IV acute GVHD over grade 0-II (p=0.007, RR 1.84), and 2 and greater HLA mismatch over less than 2 (p=0.046, RR 1.587). Overall survival (OS) of the patients with IPS was 22.1 % at day100 despite high dose steroid therapy. Interestingly, day100 OS of IPS with pleural effusion (PE) was significantly better than those without PE (44.2% and 10.0%, p=0.003). Cases with LONIPCs responded favorably to low dose steroid therapy. Among LONIPC patients, those who had LONIPC later than day 100 post-transplant (n=3), no one required long-term oxygen therapy or died directly from respiratory failure due to the lung diseases. Conclusion: The incidence of IPS was relatively high, whereas that of LONIPCs was low after reduced-intensity CBT. CBT may reduce the late pulmonary complication and improve the quality of life in hematological patients.",

Tarella University of Turin (Turin, I) Background: sMDS and AML may occur following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). A retrospective analysis at our Institution showed a 5-year cumulative probability of developing sMDS/AML of 4.8% for lymphoma patients who underwent high-dose chemotherapy (HDS) and ASCT. The molecular pathogenesis of sMDS/AML remains uncertain and we still lack a simple and wildly-applicable method to predict the rising of sMDS/AML. We recently observed a marked telomere shortening in hematopoietic cells of autografted lymphoma patients that persists at long-term. AIM In this study, we assessed post-ASCT telomere dynamics in order to verify whether accelerated telomere loss in hematopoietic cells might underlie the pathophysiology of sMDS/AML. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed telomere restriction fragments length (TRF-L)of BM cells from 35 longterm survivors autografted lymphoma patients (22M/13F) and 51 healthy donors (31M/20F). Among the 35 autografted patients we studied also 5 patients who developped sMDS/AML (2 AML,2 clinical sMDS,1 persistent pancitopenia with cytogenetic abnormalities). Patient median age at followup was 51 yrs (24-68 yrs) while donor median age was 53 yrs (18-82 yrs). The sMDS/AML patients do not differ from the other autografted patients in terms of clinical features and no differences were found in terms of CD34+ cells reinfused. Median follow-up from ASCT was 6 yrs (3.5-10 yrs). All patients were in CCR since autograft at the time of TRF-L analysis. Results: Patient TRF-L was compared to that of donors and a significant telomere loss was observed in patients ( Fig. panel A, squares and grey circles). Indeed, patient median TRF-L was 6739bp (4472-9004) while donor median TRF-L was 7791bp (5836-11058) (p<0.005). Of note all the sMDS/AML patients had a TRF-L shorter than the median TRF-L of autografted patients (Fig. panel A, black circles) . Thus, comparing only age-matched autografted patients (12) and healthy subjects (19), we found that of sMDS/AML patients had TRF-L significantly shorter than both donors and autografted patients (median TRF-L 5738bp, range 4472-6493, p<0.0005 and p<0.01, respectively) (Fig. panel B) . Conclusion: A)patients with short telomeres seem to have a higher risk of developing sMDS/AML suggesting that telomere loss may be relevant to the pathogenesis of sMDS; B) if these results will be confirmed on larger and independent populations, they will add further knowledge into the pathogenesis of sMDS.",

D'Amico, A. Viola, M. Alberti, D. Graziano, C. Falco, F. Ferrara Cardarelli Hospital (Naples, I) Background: High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) represents standard practice for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Accordingly, there is a growing demand for ASCT resulting in increased pressure on available hospital beds. The main advantages of at-home ASCT are the improvement in the quality of life and the decrease in the number of days during which patients need hospitalization, with a consequent reduction of costs, risk of nosocomial infections, and more rational utilization of beds. The aim of this study was to confirm the feasibility and safety of performing ASCT on an outpatient basis, according to an early discharge method. Patients and methods: A total of 107 cases out of 124 consecutively autograft procedures for 101 patients affected by MM in partial or complete remission were selected to receive ASCT on an outpatient basis. In particular, after conditioning with high-dose melphalan and stem cell infusion, patients were programmed to go home and to be rehospitalized in the case of febrile neutropenia or other severe toxicities. The remaining 17 cases were excluded from the program because of poor performance status (n=4), BEAM conditioning (n=8), geographical distance and/or lack of caregiver (n=7), more than one reason being present in 2 cases. All asked patients accepted the outpatient-based procedure. Results: Out of 107 cases, 83 (78%) did spend the aplastic phase entirely at home following high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell infusion. A second hospital admission was required in 24 patients (22%). Febrile neutropenia and severe mucositis needing total parenteral nutrition were the most frequent causes of hospitalization (45 and 38%, respectively). However, there were no documented infections and either fever or mucositis was easily resolved at the time of hematopoietic recovery in all patients. Neither patient's nor disease's characteristics before ASCT were found to be related to need for re-hospitalization. Of note, percent of second admission was 43% in the initial 30 patients and 14% in the following 77 procedures (p:0.002). Conclusion: We conclude that ASCT on an outpatient basis is feasible and safe in patients with MM and more than 75% of patients are entirely manageable at home, provided that a caregiver is available. A progressive increase in expertise results in a significant reduction of hospitalization.",

Soci\u00e9 Saint Louis Hospital ApHp (Paris, F) Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective therapy for children with hematologic malignancies. However, many long term complications are observed with a longer follow-up. Few data is available analyzing psycho-social aspects and risk factors of various long term complications in a same cohort of children. We have reviewed the charts of 112 children younger than 16 years, transplanted for hematologic malignancies between 1985 and 2000 at Saint Louis Hospital, and who survived at least 1 year after transplant. Median age at transplant was 8 years (0.73-15) and median follow-up from 1 year after transplantation was 8 years (0.3-16.5). Most children had acute leukemia (n=101,90%) were transplanted with an HLA-identical sibling S200 donor (n=92). Total body irradiation (TBI) was used in 87 patient as part of conditioning regimen and fractionated TBI (FTBI) was used since march 1994 in 37 patients. At 10 years, overall survival was 75\u00b15%, transplant related mortality (TRM) 18\u00b14 and relapse 14\u00b13%. Ten year cumulative incidence of severe infections (mostly bacterial) was 31%\u00b14 (n=33); it was 44\u00b14% for cataract (n=48); 20\u00b14% for pulmonary dysfunction (n=20); 29\u00b15% for osteoarticular complications (n=27); 36\u00b14% for hypothyroidism (n=36); 11\u00b13% for cardiac complications and 7\u00b13% for secondary malignancies (n=8). The number of complications per patient increased with time, from 1 at a median observation time of 73 months to 3 at a median of 120 months. Chronic GVHD was significantly associated with higher risk of pulmonary dysfunction (p=0.02). In a multivariate analysis, risk of infections were associated with older patients (>10 years at transplant) (p=0.004)and positive CMV serology (p=0.01). However, single dose TBI or only TBI was the most important factor among other factors that increased the risk of cataract (p<0.001), pulmonary (p=0.004), osteoarticular (p=0.04) and thyroid complications (p<0.0001). Concerning psychological health and social issues; half of the patients had psychological disturbance (depression, eating behavior disorder). Twelve patients achieved superior level studies and 69 had scholar difficulties. In conclusion with a longer follow-up in survivors of HSCT long term complications become an important issue. Development of less toxic conditioning regimen, avoid single dose TBI and probably better control of chronic GVHD may prevent late effects and improve quality of life of long term survivors.",

Esp\u00e9rou (1) Introduction: In children and adolescents allogeneic (allo-) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a standard therapeutic option, but its use remains limited by the risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM). Busulfan (Bu) is often included in conditioning regimens but under-or overdosing may have a fatal outcome. We published that instead of an age-based dosing a body-weight-(BW) based calculation of IVBu can successfully target a therapeutic blood exposure without any dose adjustment (Vassal G et al BMT 2006) . This approach was applied prospectively and we report here the final clinical results. Patients and Methods: 36 children (21 boys/15 girls); median age 7.5 y (range 0.3 to 17.2 y) and weight 27 kg (range 5.0 to 62.0). IVBu (Busilvex\u00ae) was given over 2 h q6h x 16 doses at: 1.0 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 0.95 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg for patients(pts) with <9 kg, 9 to <16 kg, 16-23 kg, >23-34 kg, and >34 kg BW, respectively. Cy was administered at 50 mg/kg qdx4. Clonazepam was used as seizures prophylaxis. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was given according to local practice. Indications for HSCT were: AML (n= 17: 14 CR1), ALL (n= 1), CML (n= 3), MDS (n= 1), SAA (n= 1); SCD (n= 7), thalassemia (n= 1), Wiskott-Aldrich (n= 3), LAD (n= 1), and CGD (n= 1). Pts received bone marrow (n= 35), and PBPC (n= 1) containing 6.4 x10 6 CD34+/kg (range 1.1-29) from matched related (28/36) or unrelated (5/36) donors.",

Nasilowska-Adamska (1) In this multi-center study we assessed the ability of palifermin (rHu-KGF1) to reduce the incidence, duration and severity of OM induced by high-dose chemotherapy followed by alloSCT in patients with hematological diseases. We also evaluated the requirement for analgesics and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administered because of OM. Moreover, the influence of palifermin on the engraftment and length of hospitalization after alloSCT was assessed in this study. Methods and Results: Sixty two patients with hematological diseases were enrolled to the study. Thirty one of them (50%) received palifermin (60 microg/kg/day) for three consecutive days before and after conditioning therapy. Each reporting center submitted equal number of patients to palifermin and control group. The patients in retrospective control group were similar to patients in palifermin group in terms of sex, age, diagnosis, type of donor-related/unrelated, type of transplantmyeloablative/reduced intensity conditioning, conditioning regimens and risk of OM. OM was assessed daily after alloSCT according to the World Health Organization (WHO) scale. The incidence of OM of WHO grade 1-4 was 69,5 percent in palifermin group and 95,8 percent in control group and grade 3-4 was 16,6 percent in palifermin group and 66,6 percent in control group. The median duration of OM grade 1-4 was 5,5 days (range, 0 to 19) in palifermin group and 12 days (range, 0 to 32) in control group. As compared with control, palifermin was also associated with significant reductions in the use of analgesics ( 41vs.87,5 percent ), opioid analgesics ( 37,5 vs. 83,3 percent) and TPN ( 25 vs. 70 percent). No significant differences in the median duration of hospitalization were observed between groups. Also palifermin did not appear to impair engraftment . The drug was generally well tolerated. Adverse events, mainly rash, pruritus, erythema, generalized edema, mouth/tongue thickness and discoloration and taste alteration were mild to moderate in severity and were transient. Conclusions: Administration of palifermin significantly reduced the incidence, severity and duration of OM and did not have negative effect on engraftment in the patients with hematological diseases after alloSCT. It was generally well tolerated and safe.",

Mattsson Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge (Stockholm, S) Methods: We retrospectively analysed all allogeneic SCT patients treated at the intensive care unit (ICU) from January 1995 to December 2005 at Karolinska University-Hospital, Huddinge. During this period 661 patients underwent allogeneic SCT at our centre. Ninety-one patients were admitted to the ICU, 4 patients were admitted twice. The median age of the patients was 34 (1-67) years. Twenty-six (29%) were children younger than 18 years. Diagnoses were: acute leukaemia (n=43), CML (n=17), solid tumors (n=7), other malignancy (n=15) and non-malignant disease (n=9). Thirty-one donors were HLA-identical related, 46 MUD and 14 patients received HLA-mismatched grafts. Conditioning was TBI-based (n=44), chemotherapy (n=28) or nonmyeloablative(n=19). Sixty-three patients received ATG before SCT. GVHD prophylaxis was mainly a combination of cyclosporine A and methotrexate. The patients were monitored for respiration mode, need of vasopressor treatment, Apache-score and SOFA-score. Patients younger than 10 years were not analysed with Apache-score or SOFAscore. Results: Reasons for ICU-admission were: respiratory insufficiency (n=39), septicemia (n=29), neurological symptoms (n=11) or others (n=16). Fifty-three patients died in the ICU and further 14 within 1 month after discharge from the ICU. Median time from SCT to ICU admission was 69 (-24 -1572 days) and median stay at ICU was 4 (1-60) days. Median time from ICU-admission to death was 14 (0-612) days. The survival after ICU admission day 100 was 22% and 16% at 1 year. Median SOFA-score was 10 (1-17). SOFA-score was predictive for survival after admission to the ICU. Patients with SOFA-score <8 (n=24) showed 54% survival compared to 23% with SOFA-score 8-11 (n=24) and no survival with SOFA-score >11 (n=23) (p<0.0001). No patient transplanted for a second time survived ICU treatment compared to 34% survival in patients receiving the first SCT (p=0.003). Patients receiving TBI as conditioning treatment showed less survival compared to patients given only chemotherapy (14% vs. 45%, p=0.02). Conclusion: Long-time survival in SCT-patients treated at the ICU is relatively poor. The SOFA-score was predictive for prognosis in SCT-patients treated at the ICU.",

Massenkeil (1) Loss of bone density after SCT has been observed in radiologic analyses (Ebeling 1999 , Schulte 2000 , Massenkeil 2001 . We have studied pathologic bone mass alterations in bone marrow biopsies after SCT. 67 patients after allogeneic SCT were included in this analysis. Median age was 36 years (range 17-56), 35 M, 32 F. Diagnoses: ALL 27 patients (pts.), AML 14, MDS 6, CML 20. 38 pts. were in 1. CR or 1. cP, 29 were transplanted with advanced disease. 64 received standard high-dose conditioning and 3 were transplanted after reduced intensity conditioning. 42 received bone marrow and 25 mobilized peripheral blood as stem cell source. 40 pts. were transplanted from HLA-identical related and 27 from unrelated donors. 31 bone marrow biopsies underwent Micro-CT (Scanco, Zurich, CH) and were analysed for parameters of trabecular structure after 3-D reconstruction. Results: Median bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), which serves as a parameter of histopathologic bone mass was 13.7% before SCT (range 8.6-44.4), well below the osteopathologic threshold for osteoporosis (appx. 18%). At first follow-up 6-9 months after SCT, BV/TV had dropped to 10.1% (5.9-24.6%) and at 1-2 years after SCT BV/TV was still below the pre-SCT values at 12.2% (6.1-19.3%). Number of trabecules (Tb.N.) dropped from 1.63/mm (range 0.93-2.32/mm) to 1.34 (1.01-5.61) after 6-9 months and slightly increased to 1.54 (1.26-1.88) after 1-2 years. Trabecular thickness (Tb. Th.) fell from 0.20 mm before SCT (normal Tb. Th. 0.20-0.30 mm) (range 0.16-0.49 mm) to a minimum of 0.16mm (0.14-0.25mm). As a consequence, intertrabecular space (Tb.Sp., normal appx. 0.60mm) increased from 0.60mm (0.36-1.11mm) to 0.73 mm (0.23-1.04) after SCT.",

Clausen, B. Kircher Innsbruck Medical University (Innsbruck, A) Background: Liver toxicity is a frequent complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a high mortality in its severe form. Marked elevations of coagulation parameters, adhesion molecules, and of pro inflammatory cytokines occur in patients with liver toxicity although the exact mechanisms of endothelial injury still remain elusive. Vascular endothelial growth factor and activin-A, a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, are important for endothelial integrity and tissue repair. Methods: We therefore serially measured vascular endothelial growth factor and activin-A serum levels in seventy patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Results: Vascular endothelial growth factor serum levels were significantly decreased within the first two weeks after the transplant, returned to pre transplant levels after hematopoietic regeneration, and were inversely correlated with total maximal serum bilirubin and with the number of days with serum bilirubin >2 mg/dL with day +20. Patients with high vascular endothelial growth factor levels (> 151.2 pg/mL) on day +15 had a significantly faster hematopoietic recovery and a significantly better overall survival due to less transplantrelated mortality and a lower incidence of severe acute graftversus-host disease. Even in a multivariate Cox model high vascular endothelial growth factor levels on day +15 were associated with a significantly lower risk for death. No correlation was found between activin-A serum levels and liver toxicity, overall survival, or graft-versus-host disease. Conclusion: Monitoring of vascular endothelial growth factor levels following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might help to identify patients with a very high risk for transplant-related complications including severe acute graft-versus-host disease.",

Papanicolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is a common complication post-allogeneic transplantation (alloTx). Total body irradiation (TBI) as pathogenic factor of endothelium damage has been associated with the appearance of MAHA. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and the predisposing factors of MAHA in 48 consecutive alloTx performed in 45 patients (29 male and 16 female) with a median age of 27(7-54) years diagnosed with lymphoid malignancies between 2000-2006. Three of them were transplanted twice because of relapsed disease. Disease status was: CR (24), relapse (12), and refractory (12). Sibling donors were 40 and matched unrelated 8. ABO incompatibility was marked in 11 alloTx. Twenty three patients received TBIbased conditioning regimen, 25 non TBI-based. A linear accelerator type 600C Varian was used and irradiation was delivered by a two oppose fields technique (anteriorposterior), with the patient in a lateral decubidus. Body dose was 14.4 Gy and lung dose 12 Gy, divided in 6 fragments over 3 days. Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) prophylaxis consisted of CSP/MTX (39) and Tacrolimus/MTX (9). MAHA staging was estimated according to LDH value and the percentage of schistocytes. Seventeen patients developed MAHA grade>2 with a cumulative incidence of 40%. TBI was found to be significant factor for MAHA gr>2 (p=0.02) in a univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis the presence of aGvHD, disease status, female sex and tacrolimus were significant factors for MAHA gr>2 (p<0.05). In order to identify possible factors enhancing the endothelium damage post TBI, age, immunosuppressive agents, aGvHD, disease status, ABO-incompatibility, infection, sex, donor type and body mass index (BMI) were multivariably analyzed in the separate group of patients conditioned with TBI-based regimen. BMI 24 was found to be strongly associated with MAHA gr>2, with a 9-fold possibility of occurrence (p=0.0001). Significant adverse factors were also viral infection (p=0.01) and Tacrolimus (p=0.002). Adipose tissue affects the distribution of irradiation. Given as a fact that smaller endothelium surface exists in adipose tissue, possibly non-overweight patients receive higher irradiation dose in a larger endothelium surface. The current study indicates that further investigation is needed regarding the role of the peripheral vascular tissue and the techniques of compensation, in order to reduce the complications of TBI.",

Hildebrandt University of Regensburg Medical School (Regensburg, D) Using rodent models of allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT) is important to study transplantassociated complications such as graft-versus-host disease and lung injury (LI). While changes in histopatholoy, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity and cytokines have been the hallmark of experimental LI, pulmonary function (PF) tests have been only sporadically used to determine the extent of disease. Here, we characterized breathing patterns and PF after allo-SCT using a well established murine model. Lethally irradiated B6D2F1 mice received bone marrow and T cells from either syngeneic (syn) or allo C57BL/6 mice. In vivo breathing patterns (tidal volume (TV), respiratory rate (RR), minute ventilation (MV),inspiratory (Ti) and expiratory (Te) time , peak inspiratory (PIF) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates) were determined weekly for 6 weeks. On day +42, lung volumes (vital capacity (VC), forced VC (FVC), functional residual capacity (FRC), forced expiratory volume (FEV) at 50ms and forced expiratory flow (FEF) at 25ms) were measured and animals were sacrificed for histopathologic analysis. Compared to syn and naive controls, allo recipients showed a significant decrease in MV from week 1 until week 6 due to decrease in RR and TV along with dramatically increasing Te (figure 1). PIF and PEF were also strongly reduced, whereas Ti remained normal. A decrease of MV <45% was associated with increased mortality (p=0.041). Lung compliance was reduced as early as one week after SCT (86.8% of naive; p<0.01). Parallel to these changes in breathing patterns, allo recipients showed progressive interstital, alveolar, peribronchial and periluminal inflammatory cell infiltrates. In addition, on day+42, animals after allo SCT demonstrated clear evidence of obstructive changes in PF when compared to syn controls (FEV50: 58.1 vs. 70.4%, p=0.04; FEF25: 49.9 vs. 74.3% , p=0.03; % = relative to naive; figure 2 ). VC was also reduced after allo-SCT, although not significantly. In summary, we characterize for the first time changes in breathing patterns plus PF during the course of acute LI after experimental allo SCT. Allo recipients show insufficient ventilation starting at 1 week after SCT due to combined restrictive and progressively obstructive changes in the lung. In addition to post mortem obtained parameters of LI, PF testing provides an important in vivo tool to understand better the pathophysiology of this serious complication after allo SCT. Background: A regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide is standard therapy before transplantation of allogeneic stem cells in hematologic malignancies. We evaluated the hypothesis that fludarabine can replace cyclophosphamide in myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Methods: From September 1998 to November 2006, 95 consecutive patients (male: n = 54; median age: 36, range 17-54 years) with hematologic malignancies underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical donors following busulfan+cyclophosphamide (BuCy, n = 55) or busulfan+fludarabine (BuFlu, n = 40). The patients were affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 60), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 12), chronic myeolgenous leukemia (CML, n = 10), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 6), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 5), and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 2). We evaluated the efficacy of fludarabine in HLA-identical allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared to cyclophosphamide. Results: No significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics, stem cell source, type of donor, GVHD prophylaxis, or infused cell dose were observed between the two groups. However, a shorter duration of engraftment (P = 0.001), lower incidence of acute and chronic GVHD (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively), and non-relapse mortality (P = 0.039) were observed in BuFlu group. Furthermore, event-free survival and overall survival were significantly higher in BuFlu group compared to BuCy group (P = 0.036 and P = 0.002, respectively). After adjustment for age, risk status of disease, GVHD prophylaxis and donor type, BuFlu regimen was independent favorable risk factor for event-free survival (HR, 0.165; 95% CI, 0.045-0.062; P = 0.006) and overall survival (HR, 0.170; 0.037-0.768; P = 0.021). Conclusion: From this retrospective analysis we concluded that Fludarabine based myeloablative conditioning regimen is superior to standard BuCy regimen in HLA matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Chae (1) Background: Previous studies demonstrated that in vivo administration of alemtuzumab (an anti-CD52 antibody) was effective in decreasing the incidence of GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, major concerns of serious infections have been raised because of its negative impact on the host's immune recovery after transplantation. Patients and methods: Thirty-five patients receiving allogeneic SCT with alemtuzumab-containing conditioning regimen were classified to two groups (low dose, treated with <50mg of alemtuzumab; high dose group, with 50mg) based on the median dose of alemtuzumab (50mg), and were evaluated for the incidence of CMV antigenemia or disease, clinical outcomes and complications. Results: Among thirty-five patients with hematologic malignancies, 17 (48.6%) were high risk. All recipients (9 BM, 26 PB) and donors were CMV-seropositive before transplantation. The median dose of alemtuzumab was 50mg (range, 20-75). The median survival duration was 14.03 months (range, 0.67-24.10) and 2 year survival rate was 47.0%. The probability of non-relapse mortality at 100 days and 2 year was 13.6% and 29.7%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at day 100 was 24.7%. The overall incidence of chronic GVHD was 20.8%, including an 8.3% incidence of extensive chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidence of CMV antigenemia was 70.2% (n = 24). There were no statistical differences in engraftment (P = 0.573), acute and chronic GVHD (P = 0.359 and P = 0.335, respectively), relapse (P = 0.849), mortality (P = 0.229), CMV antigenemia (P = 0.227) or overall survival (P = 0.510) between the two groups. Conclusion: Our study has shown that alemtuzumab was effective for GVHD prevention but caused a high incidence of CMV antigenemia regardless of its dose. Thus a low dose alemtuzumab (<50mg) seems to be preferable in allogeneic SCT setting with CMV seropositive recipient and donor both.",

Kudo, Y. Ikeda, S. Kondo Keio University School of Medicine (Tokyo, JP) Background and Purpose: Much of the research on HCT survivors has mainly focused on major medical events rather than daily health issues and QOL, and systemic information has not been available in routine monitoring and management of health care needs after 5 years for this population. The aim of this study is to clarify health problems and health-related QOL for 5 years< survivors after HCT. Patients and Methods: Between 1983 and 2001, 204 patients with hematologic diseases underwent allogeneic HCT at Keio BMT Program. 106 are currently alive and disease-free for 5 < years. Medical Outcome Survey-Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires for QOL and self-reported questionnaire for 85 diseases and symptoms were sent to 102 out of 106 patients and the answers of 84 (84%) patients responded were analyzed. Results: The median age of patients at the time of transplant was 38 (range 15-54), and 80 (95%) underwent HCT for hematological malignancies. 11 were still on immunosuppressants. The most frequent self-reported health problem was eye problems (64%) followed by bone-skeletal (38%) and skin problems (31%). Neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and oral problems were also reported in about 20-25% of patients. In addition, long-term survivors reported problems regarding sexuality issues (42%) and financial problems (45%) The mean score of each SF-36 dimensions of all long-term survivors was the same as that of age-and sex-matched control; however, 25 out of 84 (29.7%) had SF-36 dimensions which score was lower than that of control population. The median number of impaired SF-36 dimensions per patient was 1.8 ranging from 1 to 8. Many of the self-reported health problems were significantly associated with low scores of SF-36 dimensions except for social functioning in univariate analysis, and dimensions representing physical aspects of QOL were affected more than those representing mental aspects of QOL. Multivariate analysis showed that oral (p=0.01), neuro-psychiatric (p=0.03), musculoskeletal (p=0.01), endocrine (p=0.04), and skin (p=0.006) problems remained as significant factors of impairing QOL assessed by SF-36. In addition to those health problems, financial problems but not problems regarding sexuality was associated with impaired SF-36 dimensions(p=0.01). Conclusion: Although indistinguishable in many aspects, long term survivors after HCT should be carefully monitored for health problems described above to improve their QOL. Objectives: In addition to the primary goal of estimating oral mucositis (OM) incidence and duration, the POMA study aimed to assess patterns of OM prophylaxis and treatment in European practice. Methods: Patients (pts.) with multiple myeloma (MM) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), receiving high dose melphalan or BEAM followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation, were prospectively observed until 30 days post transplant or hospital discharge. OM assessments used the WHO scale.",

            "text": "Microsatellite instability in second primary neoplasms after childhood cancer K.-K. Kober (1) Objectives: A defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system increases the risk of developing a malignant neoplasm. The MMR defective mutator phenotype is characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI is seen in patients with colon carcinoma and associated tumours, in not related tumours a form of MSI called 'elevated microsatellite alterations of selected tetranucleotide repeats' (EMAST) is observed. In childhood malignant neoplasms a higher rate of predisposing factors has to be expected because of the early onset. Indeed MSI is found in a relevant percentage in childhood malignancies. Furthermore, individuals suffering form second primary neoplasms (SPN) are supposed to have an increased load of genetic risk factors. Several publications describe a clearly increased rate of MSI in SPN (Gafanovich, Cancer 1999; Casorelli, DNA Repair 2003) . To date it is not possible to answer the question whether a) the preceding chemotherapy is inducing MSI and thereby increasing the risk of a second neoplasm, or b) the individuals with MSI-positive tumours represent a high risk group with primary mutator phenotype, cumulating two hazardous factors: the basal increased risk of developing a neoplasm and the increased vulnerability to the mutagenicity of the applied chemotherapy. Patients and methods: MSI is analysed by PCR and fragment length analysis. Because of the sensitive methodology samples of poor DNA quality can be included, e.g. paraffin embedded tissue or bone-marrow smears. Furthermore an approach has been established to evaluate the MSI status without the need of reference tissue (as peripheral blood) to minimize the logistic efforts. From all individuals with SPN registered at the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR) in Mainz (< 400 patients), samples of 172 patients are collected. Results: Table 1 shows the results of a pilot study including 47 samples of SPN and 33 samples of independent primary neoplasms. Conclusions: MSI is more frequent in SPNs than in primary neoplasms. The predominant form of MSI is EMAST in both groups. If DNA is available, the corresponding primary malignancy of the patients with SPN will be evaluated to answer the question mentioned above whether MSI is a primary underlying defect or a secondary treatment induced phenomenon. The influence of the applied therapy, especially of certain high risk elements, e.g. stem cell transplantation and administration of alkylating drugs, will be studied.",

Scherwath, A. Zander, U. Koch University Medical Center Hamburg (Hamburg, D) Purpose: In the course of high-dose chemotherapy neuropsychological complications are observed in a significant portion of patients. Remarkably, studies show that cognitive dysfunctions may be already present before the onset of therapy. One reason for this observation could be the influence of distress related to the specific treatment modalities at admission for HSCT. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the specific effects of treatment modalities and treatment-related psychological distress on cognitive functions before the onset of HSCT. Method: Patients scheduled for high-dose therapy and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation were admitted to an ongoing prospective multicenter study. They were assessed with a standardized neuropsychological test battery, measuring cognitive performance in the domains of memory, learning and attention. Furthermore subjects filled out the Cancer Treatment Distress Scale (CTXD; Syrjala 2005), a self-report questionnaire with 7 subscales related to specific features of HSCT. Results: Baseline data of 60 patients from one study center will be presented. Cognitive impairments were found in a subgroup of patients with percentages of impairments ranging from 5% to 20%, being most pronounced in the verbal learning domain. Subdimensions of treatment-related distress were significantly, but moderately (r=-.26 to -.35) related with several areas of cognitive performance. Conclusion:",

Only 15 (30%) patients had LFTs which were in the normal range. 35/50 (70%) patients had at least one persistently abnormal LFT and 21/50 (42%) patients had at least one parameter greater than twice the upper limit of the normal range. Of 7 patients whose transaminases were more than double the normal range (\u00b1 elevated gamma GT), two patients had hepatits C, one had biopsy proven GVHD and four had a presumptive diagnosis of fatty liver based on US appearance and evidence of dyslipidaemia (cholesterol>6mmol/l, HDL/cholesterol ratio >5). One of these four patients had received a liver transplant 10 years previously for liver GVHD Of 14 patients whose gamma GT was more than double the normal range (mean 162iu/l range 62-539) without significantly elevated transaminases (<2x normal), two had liver biopsies confirming diagnoses of iron overload and GVHD. Of the remaining 12 patients, 8/12 had dyslipidaemia and 2/12 had elevated ferritins (>1000ug/l). Of the 8 patients with dyslipidaemia, liver US data were available for 6. Three had an appearance suggestive of fatty change and 1 had mildly increased echogenicity. Two US scans were normal. Of the 4 patients with a cholesterol less than 6 mmol/l, two patients had alcohol consumption in excess of 21 units per week but there were no additional risk factors for liver disease (ferritin normal, liver autoantibodies negative) Long term survivors of SCT have a high prevalence of liver dysfunction of which the commonest cause is hepatic steatosis associated with dyslipidaemia. Dasatinib is a dual SRC/ABL TK inhibitor being used in advanced Chronic Myelogynous Leukemia (CML) or refractory Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Most of these pts will eventually undergo SCT, raising the question of whether pre-SCT Dasatinib therapy will increase transplant related complications and/or adversely affect outcome. We report thirteen pts: CML-11 (CP1-4, low sokal score-3, high sokal score-1, CP2-2, AP-3, BC-2) and Ph+ ALL -2 who received Dasatinib prior to alloSCT (n=12) or autoSCT (n=1). Donors were matched unrelated-7, matched siblings-4 or mismatch related donor (haploSCT) -1. Seven were male and 6 female with a median age of 45 (16-56) years. First line therapies included Hydroxyurea or Interferon followed by Imatinib for the CP CML pts and chemotherapy followed by Imatinib for the advanced CML and Ph+ ALL pts. All pts subsequently received Dasatinib 70mg x 2/day due to resistance to Imatinib, resulting in complete hematological response in 11 pts., as well as complete (n=6) or partial cytogenetic response (CyR) (n=2) prior to SCT. Three pts did not achieve CyR prior to SCT. The pts were conditioned with either a myeloablative protocol (n=8) or a reduced intensity protocol (n=5). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA and MTX (n=11) or complete Tcell depletion (n=1). Pts received a mobilized peripheral blood stem cell graft (n=12) or BM graft (n=1) with 8.7 (5-24) x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.

Pfreundschuh University Hospital Homburg (Homburg, D) Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cells (=HSCs) are known to have robust mechanisms to overcome short term proliferative stress during infections, chemotherapy or even single stem cell transplantation procedures. Here we have studied telomere length, the ability to mobilize HSCs and proliferative responses of lymphocytes from Aggressive NHL (=aNHL) patients and one seminoma patient after repetitive cycles of high dose chemotherapy. Methods: 6 previously untreated aNHL patients with an age adjusted International Prognostic Index (= IPI, IPI 2) were treated in the Phase III MegaCHOEP trial (one course hiCHOEP und 3 courses MegaCHOEP + Rituximab and autologous stem cell support, including stem cell apheresis before each cycle of high dose chemotherapy). Also one patient diagnosed with seminoma (induction cheomotherapy: cisplatin, Etoposid und ifosphamid for stem cell mobilisation and 3 repetitive cycles of high dose chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Etoposid, including stem cell support from the first apheresis procedure) was studied. Telomere length analyses by FlowFish were done before and after repetitive cycles of chemotherapy and at a follow up date. Furthermore the amount of mobilized CD34+ HSC in apheresis products after each cycle of chemotherapy was determined in n=17 aNHL patients. Flow-cytometric analysis of proliferative responses from CD3+ lymphocytes was quantified (n=4). Results: Telomere length decrease significantly in after three autologous transplantations in granulocytes (p<0.048) but not in lymphocytes (p=0.20) from aNHL patients. Even follow up samples showed that telomere shortening could not be compensated by replicative reserve of HSCs. In contrast, telomere length was stable in one seminoma patient. Furthermore, lymphocyte proliferation decreased alongside with telomere shortening in the lymphocyte compartment, but was not statistically significant (n=4, decrease from an average of 27.0% to 16.0%, p=0.3). Parallel to telomere shortening, the percentage of mobilized CD34+ HSC per total leukocytes during leukapheresis decreased significantly with each consecutive cycle of apheresis/ stem cell transplantation in patients with aNHL (average 6,18% during 1st apheresis procedure to 1,49% for the 3rd apheresis procedure, p=0.006). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that repetitive autografting causes permanent telomere erosion in aNHL patients granulocytes and results in significant reduction of the HSCs mobilized to the peripheral blood.",

Wolterbeek, I. van Gils, A. Lankester, R. Bredius, J.J. Schweizer LUMC (Leiden, NL) Several studies have shown that the prevalence of persistently or recurrently elevated liver enzymes late after haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (SCT) varies from 40 to 58%. Aetiology includes viral hepatitis, iron overload, autoimmune hepatitis and/or chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) in a majority of these patients, but in some aetiology remains unclear. Aim of the study: was to establish the prevalence and clinical relevance of elevated liver enzymes in children surviving long term after SCT in a country with a low prevalence of HBV and HCV among blood donors. Methods: A single centre retrospective study was performed, in which AST and ALT values from before SCT until 2 years after SCT were collected in all children transplanted between 1980 and 2002. Patient characteristics such as age, sex, diagnosis, type of transplant and conditioning regimen and post-transplant complications involving the liver (venoocclusive disease, acute GvHD, viral reactivation) were collected. We applied the Chi-square test and univariate logistic regression analysis to analyse possible risk factors for abnormal liver enzymes 2 years after SCT. Results: 290 of 455 patients who underwent SCT were alive 2 years after SCT. In survivors median age at SCT was 7.1 years and the majority were transplanted for a haematological malignancy and with bone marrow of a matched sibling donor. In 59% of patients conditioning included TBI. AST and ALT were assessed at 2 years after SCT in 210 patients and values were above normal in 97 (46%). In 22 patients (10.5%) AST and/or ALT value was at least twice the upper limit of normal. In 15 of these 22 patients aetiology could be studied and was consistent with iron overload in 7, including one with severe haemochromatosis, portal hypertension and oesophagus varices, cGvHD in 4 (1 died) and unknown aetiology in 4 patients. None of these 15 patients had chronic viral hepatitis. Risk factors for elevated liver enzymes were also studied and will be presented. Conclusions: The prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes in our centre is not different from the prevalence reported in previous studies. Like previous studies, ours showed that all but 2 of 97 patients with abnormal liver enzymes were asymptomatic. Aetiology was different from that reported in other studies however, i.e. no chronic viral hepatitis was found. Longer follow-up is needed to establish the clinical relevance of elevated liver enzymes late after SCT.",

Helbig, B. Stella-Holowiecka, J. Wojnar, M. Krawczyk, S. Kyrcz-Krzemien, M. Sadus-Wojciechowska, M. Markiewicz, M. Kopera, I. Wylezol, J. Holowiecki Silesian Medical University (Katowice, PL) Background: Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) following ABOmismatched allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) results from the presence of recipient-derived, residual lymphocytes B or plasma cells, which can produce isohemagglutinins against donor erythroid cells. Material and methods: Between 1993-2006, 548 patients underwent alloSCT for malignant and non-malignant haematologic disorders. In 44 (8%) we revealed major and major-minor ABO blood group incompatibility between donor and recipient. Bone marrow grafts were major ABO incompatible in 30 patients, there was bi-directional mismatch in remaining 14 patients. Results: Stem cell donors were HLA identical siblings in 26 patients, 18 recipients received transplant from unrelated donors. The source of stem cells were: bone marrow (BM) in 30 patients, peripheral blood (PB) in 9 pts and BM+PB in 5 cases. 21 patients received transplant for acute myeloid leukemia, 10 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 7 for chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 for severe aplastic anaemia, 1 for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, 1 for myelodysplastic syndrome, 1 for Hodgkin lymphoma and 1 for multiple myeloma. Conditioning regimens consisted of busulphan and cyclophosphamide in 17 pts, treosulphan and fludarabine (n=10), cyclophospamide alone (n=4), total body irridation with cyclophosphamide (n=5), treosulphan and cyclophosphamide (n=3), busuphan and fludarabine in 1 patient and others regimens in remaining 4 patients. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate (Mtx) in 39 pts, Mtx and prednisone in 7 pts and CsA alone in 3 patients. The median number of transplanted mononuclear cells was: 4.74x10 8 /kg (range 0. 1-26.4 ) including CD34+ cells-3.02x10 6 /kg (range 0.9-21.7). Granulocyte engraftment >0.5x10 9 /L occurred after median of 21 days (7-32) and platelet exceeded >50x10 9 /L after median of 23.5 day (12-109). Acute GVHD developed in 23 patients (52%). Six patients (13%) transplanted with major and bi-directional ABO-incompatibility developed PRCA. The long-term treatment using different strategies (plasmapheresis, EPO, CsA off, donor lymphocyte infusion, rituximab) resulted in erythroid recovery in 5 out of 6 patients after median of 13 months (3-16). Median follow-up of PRCA group is 37 months(16-51).Median RBCs transfusion was 10.1 litres (2.2-15.9). Conclusions: PRCA after ABO-incompatible alloSCT requires long-lasting treatment, but majority of patients achieve complete erythroid recovery. Background: Glutamine (GLN), usually defined a \"non essential\" amino acid, is one of the most important substrate for ammonia genesis in the gut and for acid-base homeostasis regulation in kidney. Moreover, it plays an important role in the glutathione's synthesis and in promoting the growth of fibroblasts, lymphocytes and enterocytes. On the other hand, the fish-oil-derived n 3 fatty acids (n-3FA) have been referred to interfere with inflammatory and immune response by regulating prostaglandins, Tromboxane A2 and leukotrienes synthesis. Patients and Methods: From 2000 to 2002, 29 patients undergoing autologous SCT for malignant hematological diseases entered the study comparing standard TPN regimen (Group A: n = 16) with a TPN regimen containing GLN (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) at dose of 0.22g/kg/day (Group B: n = 13) The patients in the 2 groups were comparable for age, diagnosis, pre-transplant therapy and pre-transplant conditioning regimens. Isonitrogeneous and isocaloric TPN was started on day +1 after SCT and discontinued when patients recovered oral intake for 50% of nutritional support. No difference in terms of gastro-intestinal toxicity and general patient outcome was observed between group A and B. From 2003 to 2005, 16 patients with similar characteristics received TPN containing GLN at dosage 0.22 g/K/day plus fish-oil n-3 fatty acid ( n-3FA Omegaven, Fresenius) at dosage of 1.5ml/kg.These patients (Group C) were retrospectively compared with the other two groups (A and B) of patients for a number of variables: length of hospitalization, number days on TPN, duration of febrile neutropenia, number days on antibiotic therapy, use of antifungal drugs, days to PMN engraftment, grade of mucositis, diarrhea and hemesis. Results: The use of GLN -EPA enriched TPN (group C) was significantly associated with lower length of hospitalization (p =0.001), lower duration of febrile neutropenia (p=0.006) reduced number of days on antibiotic therapy (p=0.008), and on TPN (p=0.004), reduced use of antifungal drugs and lower incidence and severity of mucositis. No difference was observed for number of days to PMN engraftment. Conclusion: Our retrospective study strongly suggests that a number of clinical outcomes can be improved in patients undergoing an autologous transplant by the use of GLN-n3FA enriched TPN and provides the clinical base for designing a prospective randomized trial.",

Behre University of Halle-Wittenberg (Halle, D) Background: Oral mucositis (OM) and intestinal mucositis (IM) following autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) result in significant morbidity. Treatment with keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) reduces the extent of OM and IM. The extent of IM is difficult to determine. Citrulline, an amino acid mainly synthesized in the small intestine, serves as a marker of small intestine injury. Aim of the present study was to determine the extent of OM and IM before and after the introduction of KGF in the treatment of OM and IM. Methods: Since 05/2006 the extent of OM and IM in autologous and allogeneic HSCT was evaluated prospectively. Beside routine clinical and laboratory values including the daily oral mucositis score (DMS) and daily gut score (DGS) the plasma citrulline level was determined in week 1 (W1), week 2 (W2) and week 3 (W3) following HSCT. Moreover the dosage of therapeutic intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic treatment with meropeneme, piperacilline/combactam and teicoplanin in addition to antibiotic prophylaxis was noted. Since 09/2006 KGF (60\u00b5g/kg body weight per day, for 3 days before conditioning therapy respectively after HSCT) was applied to all patients (pt) undergoing HSCT in our institution. Pt with oropharyngeal radiotherapy were excluded from analysis. Results: Until 11/2006 20 pt (2f/18m) were evaluated. 15 of these pt underwent autologous and 5 allogenic HSCT. 5 of the autologous and 3 of the allogenic transplanted pt received KGF. In pt with KGF clinically significant OM and moderate to severe IM were seen less often (W1: 1/8 pt vs. 3/12 pt and W2: 1/8 pt vs. 2/12 pt without KGF). CRP (in mg/l) was lower in the group of pt with KGF (W2: average 69.9 (min 9.4 -max 174.2) vs. 109.9 (min 6.0 -max 259.8) in pt without KGF). All these differences were statistically non significant. Citrulline serum levels (in \u00b5mol/l) were significantly higher in pt receiving KGF (W2: average 24 vs. 15.2 in pt without KGF (p = 0.002)). The need for therapeutic i.v. antibiotics was lower for pt receiving KGF (average of 5.43 days vs. 13.23 days for pt without KGF (p = 0.037)). Subgroup analysis confirmed the described tendencies in autologous HSCT. Summary: Even in this small number of pt a positive effect of KGF on oral and intestinal mucositis was detectable. The reduced need for therapeutic i.v. antibiotics seen as a tendency in this study should be re-evaluated in a larger group of pt to prove the cost effectiveness of KGF treatment.",

Bitencourt, C. de Medeiros, J. Zanis Neto, I. Kafka, E. Cesario, J. Pelaez, R. Pasquini Federal University of Parana (Curitiba, BR) Although we find in the literature a great number of recent publications, there is still limited data regarding quality of life(QOL) for pts transplanted in developing countries. Low income, low level of education and sanitary measures will directly affect the life of pts transplanted in these countries and QOL should be analyzed within this scenario. Material and methods: 312 pts, 18 years or older and surviving more than 10 years after transplant were identified in our registry. 100 pts were lost to follow-up and 212pts were contacted by the first author at a median time of 12,5 years after transplant ( range: 10-23,8y). All of them agreed to answer a set of questionnaires regarding QOL. Gender: 137M/75F. Median age at transplant: 21y(3-51y) Median age at evaluation : 34,8y (18-64y). All pts received bone marrow from related (208) or unrelated (4) donors. 18 pts received a 2nd transplant. Malignant diseases: 42,5%. Non malignant diseases:57,5%. 212 adults recruited at a regional blood bank were used as controls.Median age:34,4y. Gender:103M/109F(p<0,001). Results: Quality of life as well as overall health was significantly better in pts than in the control group (p< 0,001). They also had a better functional well being when compared to controls (p<0,001). Even though most pts came from a low socio-economic background there was no significant difference between social classes or academic level. Pts had more fatigue, more sexual dysfunction (especially women) and more cognitive deficits when compared to controls but these symptoms did not change what they felt about their overall health status. No statistical difference was found between both groups regarding mood disorders (depression or anxiety) or family and social well being. No difference was found between pts having GVHD or not. 53pts transplanted below the age of 13 remember very little about the procedure but confirm the importance of family support at that time.",

Biron, C. Carrie Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard (Lyon, F) Purpose: To determine the risk of second malignant neoplasms in patients who had total body irradiation (TBI) as a part of conditioning regimen before bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Patients and methods: Between 1980 and 1998 500 patients underwent intensive chemotherapy withTBI (8-12 Gy in 4-6 fractions/2-3 days in 90% of patients). Patients were included in a program of allogeneic(22.4% ) and autologous (77.2% ) BMT The majority of cases were Non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (233 patients), neuroblastoma (92 cases ) and acute lymphatic leukemia(87 cases) .Age of the patients ranged from 1-70 years .All cases that developed second malignancies were recorded and the incidence was compared to that in the general population. Results: Median Follow up from BMT was 8.5 years (range 5-21 years). Twenty second malignancies were observed (18 solid tumors and 2 acute mylogenous leukemia).The most frequent malignant diseases were neoplasms of the thyroid (4patints ) and lung (3 cases ) One of the patients developed 2 second malignancies (skin and parotid).There were 11 males and 8 females with a median age of 35 (range 2-64) at the time of BMT.Median time to develop a second malignancy was 5 years (range 1-17).The initial diagnosis was NHL in 9 patients (47.4%), 15 patients (78.9%) had autologous BMT .Second malignancy was the cause of death in 13 patients. Patients' characteristics and type of conditioning chemotherapy regimen used were investigated for their ability to predict the development of second cancer and none was found to be significant. Conclusion: Long follow up for patients who received TBI before BMT demonstrates an increased incidence of second malignant neoplasms which can be an important cause of death in long-term survivors of BMT. This incidence continues to rise and prolonged follow up is extremely important.",

In the literature, diseases like Beh\u00e7et's Disease and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, with similar inflammatory ulcerative oral lesions, are found to have pathogenetic relationships with HLA system. Objectives: Aim of this study was to define, if there is any relationship between oral mucositis seen in posttransplant setting and the HLA system. Material and methods: Study was conducted retrospectively in 202 patients of a single transplant center, who were transplanted in previous 5 years. To increase the statistical power of the results, corrected p values according to Bonferroni method were used in determination of significance. Results: Post-transplant mucositis occured in 160 (79,6 %) of the patients, which was mild in 31,2 %, and severe in 68,5 % of them. Duration of the mucositis was 12,5 (\u00b17) days. As an indicator of severity, need for total parenteral nutrition and/or narcotic analgesic treatment was seen in 42,7 % of the cases. HLA-DRB11 antigen was detected to be a strong protective factor against the development of mucositis and the severity of mucositis (OR: 0,33, p=0,006). HLA-A24 (OR: 0,30, p=0,02), B53 (OR: 0,02, p=0,02), and DRB15 (OR:0,31, p=0,04) were protective against mucositis. A24 was also a decreasing factor for severity of the mucositis (Trends test: 0,014). All of the cases expressing HLA-A33 and DRB16 phenotype developed mucositis, so these antigens are thought to be risk factors for OM. Mucositis severity was higher in cases with HLA B41 antigen (OR: 26.3, p=0,02). HLA-A30 (OR: 8,23, p=:0,03), A68 (OR:46.5, p=0,02), B8 (OR:3,77, p=:0,03), and B15 (OR: 21.6, p=0,008) expressing patients are susceptible for severe mucositis that needs therapeutic intervention. Patients with HLA-C3 phenotype had lower risk for severe mucositis requiring therapeutic intervention (OR:0,24, p=0,04). Conclusion: Some specific HLA groups are related to development of post-transplant mucositis. This shows the role of immune system in the pathogenesis of oral mucositis so in the future, patients expressing these HLA antigens should be evaluated accordingly about the risk of developing mucositis in the clinics. Objectives: Veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) is a serious complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with broad ranges of incidence variability among institutions. Our goal was to determine the incidence, severity, and outcome of VOD in a uniform series of patients that underwent allogeneic transplantation in the last ten years at our hospital. Methods: We reviewed the clinical charts of all consecutive patients that underwent allogeneic HSCT from January 1996 to January 2006. Data collection included variables known to affect VOD: baseline haematological disease and phase, conditioning regimen, VOD prophylaxis, preexisting liver disease, use of specific antibiotics during HSCT and source of haematopoietic cells. VOD was diagnosed clinically according to the Seattle criteria and classified retrospectively as mild, moderate and severe. Results: Out of 133 allogeneic transplants, we detected 22 cases of VOD with an overall incidence of 16%. The general characteristics of this patients are showed in Table 1 . There were 12 male and 10 female. 2 patients had undertaken double autologous transplants. The underlying disease and other clinical characteristics are described in Table 1 . Pretransplant elevated serum AST concentration was described in 3 patients (13%, median ALT 101 UI/L, range 70 to 136). The VOD prophylaxis was low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in 15 (54%) patients, ursodeoxycholic acid 1 (4,5%) or both in 6 (36%) patients. Use of specific antibiotics that have been associated with VOD was as follows: acyclovir (81%), vancomycin (18%) and amphotericin (13%). 18 patients required diuretics and other supportive therapy and 4 patients (18%) were treated specifically with defibrotide. VOD was graded as mild in 4 (18%), moderate in 15 (68%) and severe in 2 (9%) patients. There was only one death attributable to VOD and multiorgan failure. Conclusion: The overall incidence of VOD in our series was 16%, similar to that described by other groups. We did not find any specific correlation, probably due to the low number of events. New prophylactic and treatment approaches are required to decrease the incidence, morbidity and mortality of this complication.",

Elad, B. Gesundheit, R. Or, S. Slavin Hadassah University Hospital (Jerusalem, IL) Most of the hematological malignancies where allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a therapeutic option occur in elderly patients. Additionally, in this age group, the probability of finding a matched sibling donor decreases due to mortality and co-morbidities of patient s siblings which may exclude them from donation. In such case, SCT from an unrelated donor (UD) can offer a therapeutic solution for elderly patients in need although such a procedure is considered more hazardous than SCT from a matched sibling (mostly due to procedure and GVHD related morbidity and mortality). We present our data on transplantation, in 68 elderly (age 55 years) patients that underwent SCT from a matched sibling (n=51) or UD (n=17) mostly using fludarabine-based regimen (table 1). Median recipient age was 58.3y in the sibling group and 60.8y in the UD group (NS) (range 55-69.5y and 55-75y, respectively). With a median follow-up of 40 months of the survivors after sibling SCT, the 1-year OS was 32%. Similarly, in the UD group the 1-year OS was 35% (survivors median follow-up 48.5m) (NS). Transplant related mortality occurred in 22/49 (45%) and 9/17 (53%) of the patients transplanted from sibling or UD respectively (NS). Occurrence of acute GVHD was noted in 26/43 and 7/11 (figure 1) evaluable patients transplanted from matched sibling or UD respectively (NS). Diagnosis of chronic GVHD was made in 50% (14/28) and 63% (5/8) of the patients in the sibling and UD group correspondingly. GVHD related mortality occurred in 11 and 2 patients, respectively. We conclude that using fludarabine based regimen, allogeneic SCT from an UD is equally effective as in patients undergoing SCT from matched family member. Age per-se should not be currently used as an exclusion criterion for either initiation of donor search or SCT from UD.",

Cavagna (1) Oral mucositis (OM) is an acute, severe and often doselimiting toxicity in patients undergoing Hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). OM significantly affects functional status and patient's quality of life; however, until recently, no effective therapy was available for this condition. Palifermin (Kepivance\u00ae) is a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor that stimulates proliferation, differentiation, and migration of epithelial cells. Palifermin has been shown to decrease the incidence and duration of severe OM in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy and HSCT (Spielberger NEJM 2004) . The safety and efficacy of palifermin have not been established in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. We report the results of an Expanded Access Program conducted in Italy from July 2005 through October 2006. After obtaining ethics committee approval, 29 centers administered palifermin 60 mcg/kg/day intravenously on 3 consecutive days before the conditioning regimen and on 3 consecutive days immediately after the day of stem cell infusion. Data from 140 patients (76 men, 64 women; median age 51.5 years, range 18-72) were analyzed. The most common diagnoses were multiple myeloma (MM) (n=55) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n=56). Conditioning therapy and supportive care were administered according to standard institutional practice (highdose melphalan for MM and the BEAM regimen for NHL). OM was evaluated daily for 28 days after transplantation or until severe OM resolution using the World Health Organization (WHO) oral-toxicity scale. The incidence of severe OM (Grade 3-4) was 12.7 % and the incidence of ulcerative OM was 31.3%. The mean duration was 2.1 \u00b1 3.8 days (CI,1.4-2.7) in patients with OM Grade 0-4, 8.6 \u00b1 3.6 days (CI, 6.8-10.4) in patients with OM Grade 3-4, and 6.6 \u00b1 4.0 (CI, 5.4-7.8) in patients with OM Grade 2-4. Adverse events due to Palifermin (rash, pruritus, erythema, mouth and tongue disorders, and taste alteration) were mild to moderate in severity and were transient. The frequency of these adverse events was consistent with those observed in clinical trials. In conclusion, we observed that treatment with palifermin reduces the incidence and duration of OM if compared with historical data(Sonis Cancer 2004), offering effective OM prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is considered a major cause of morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and its overall incidence is approximately 10%. Symptoms range from microscopic hematuria to painful, massive hematuria, urinary obstruction due to clots formation and renal failure. Conventional therapies including pain relief, hyperhydration, bladder irrigation and antiviral drugs result often ineffective. Invasive intervention such as fulguration, vescical air embolism and partial or total cystectomy employed in life-threatening conditions are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Fibrin glue is an hemostatic agent derived from plasma coagulation proteins. It is biocompatible and biodegradable and not associated with inflammation, foreign body reaction, tissue necrosis or extensive fibrosis. Reabsorption of fibrin clot is achieved during normal wound healing within few days after application and its activity for tissue repair process is well known. We aimed at evaluating the efficacy of fibrin glue, obtained from fresh frozen plasma, in the treatment of two female patients, aged 46 and 41 years, who developed a severe HC following an unrelated cord blood and an haploidentical HSCT, respectively. Both patients were prepared with an intensive, chemotherapy-based, myeloablative conditioning regimen. The first symptoms of HC occurred at 60 and 42 days after transplant. Both patients received all the sequence of the conventional therapy, including hyperhydration, bladder irrigation, anti viral therapy against isolated cytomegalovirus, polyomavirus and BK virus, supportive therapy and massive platelet and red blood cell concentrates. Nevertheless, HC was unresponsive with persistence of gross hematuria and clot formation. Using a specially designed single-use endoscopic catheter (Vivostat Endoscopic Application System), after a carbon dioxide insufflation fibrin sealant was applied on large bleeding surfaces of the vesical mucosa through a cystoscope. Due to the preformed nozzle, the spray tip could easily be manipulated in many directions and fibrin sealant applied to all the row surfaces. After 10 days, complete regression of HC symptoms was achieved in both patients, who remain well and free of transfusions. Fibrin Glue seems to be an effective approach to the treatment of refractory HC and its early usage in the course of this complication should be considered.",

Miranda (1) Oral mucositis (OM) is a complication of intensive chemo and radiotherapy with no effective treatment. Palifermin (PAL) is a recombinant keratinocyte growth factor that decreases the incidence and duration of OM in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving myeloablative chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and severity of OM. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of PAL in these patients. Observational, retrospective and multicenter study in patients with hematologic malignancies who received PAL in the setting of autologous SCT. Fifty-two PAL treated patients were included, 54% male, mean age 47\u00b112 years old. The diagnosis were Multiple Myeloma (MM) (N=15), Hodgkin's Disease (N=11), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (N=16), Acute Leukemia (AL) (N=7) and others (N=3). The majority of patients were conditioned with BEAM/BEAM-like regimens (52%) and high dose melfalan (31%). World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Toxicity Scale was considered to score OM. Fifty-four percent of the enrolled patients showed OM, 50% male, mean age 46\u00b112 years old. OM appeared after 16\u00b17 days of conditioning regimen, median WHO score of 1 for 8\u00b16 days (mean). Forty-eight percent of all patients needed opioid analgesics, median WHO score of 1 for 8\u00b12 days (mean). Sixty-nine percent of the patients tolerated solid food (Grade 0-2), 21% liquids only (Grade 3) and 9% nothing per os (Grade 4). Seven patients received parenteral nutrition (6 due to OM), median WHO score of 1 for 12\u00b19 days (mean). OM affected mostly patients with MM (N=11) and AL (N=6). Bleeding was referred by 6 patients, 15 mentioned tongue scalloping and 16 reported saliva alterations. The most frequent ulcerations were on the cheeks (57%), right ventral identical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation S213 and lateral tongue (27%) and soft palate (25%). Left cheek, right cheek and soft palate were the most reported as erythema sites (75%, 64% and 57%, respectively). Adverse events were reported in 40 patients. Rash (N=36), pruritus (N=29), weight increase (N=18) and edema (N=8) were probably related to PAL and were transient. Diarrhoea (N=34) was interpreted as a result of the conditioning regimen. Although the mean duration of OM was 8 days, most of the patients reported a mild grade of OM according to WHO. Palifermin was easy to use and the adverse events were easily manageable. Further studies are needed to access the full benefits of Palifermin.",

Leone Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Roma (Rome, I) Many reports indicate different incidence of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) and solid tumor in patients receiving autologous transplantation for lymphoprolipherative disorders (LPD). We conducted a retrospective study in a selected group of 142 patients out of 323 undergone to autologous transplantation for LPD between January 1988 and December 2004. The risk factor was evaluated with univariata and multivariata analysis including: gender, sex, age, diagnosis, radiotherapy and chemotherapy before conditioning regimen, disease status at PBSCT, type of harvest. Out of 142 patients included in the study, 3 (2.1%) (2.48% at 5 years) developed sMDS/AML at 6, 15 and 41 months after PBSCT respectively for NHL, CLL and NHL. One patient died 6 months after diagnosis of sAML, two patients are alive after allogeneic stem cell transplantion at 7 and 35 months respectively after diagnosis of sMDS/AML. At univariate analysis diagnosis and use of drugs were the only variables significantly associated with the development of sAML/MDS, with higher incidence rate in patients with CLL (p = 0.045), and in patient who received fludarabine (p = 0.0005) and monoclonal antibody (p = 0.012). At multivariate analysis, the variables associated to sAML/MDS were fludarabine and disease status at PBSCT (PD respect to CR). Out of 142 patients considered, 3 patients (2.1%) developed a solid neoplasia, one affected by HD and two with LNH. The patients who developed secondary solid neoplasia (pancreas, colon and lung) 24, 46, 127 months respectively after autologous transplant died at median time of 4 months (range 3-33 months) from second diagnosis. At univariate analysis we found that radiotherapy (p = 0.021), and monoclonal antibodies (p = 0.028) were significantly associated with the development of secondary solid neoplasia. Multivariate analysis confirmed the results of univariata analysis. The low incidence of sAML/MDS after ASCT could be abscribed to the stringent criteria lead to establish the real incidence of sMDS/AML due to prior chemo-radiotherapy excluding: the use of chemo-radiotherapy or biological response modifiers after autotransplant for progression disease requiring treatment, cytogenetical alteration before conditioning regimen, low risk MDS during the first year after aPBSCT. The absence of TBI as conditioning regimen could explain the low icidence of secondary solid tumor (expecially skin and bladder neoplasia).",

Kato (1) , Y. Matsuhashi (1) , N. Matsuno (1), A. Wake (1), S. Miyakoshi (2), S. Taniguchi (1) (1)Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP); (2)Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Backgrounds: For more than 10 years, umbilical cord blood has become an alternative stem cell source for the patients with hematological malignancies requiring allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Cord blood transplantation (CBT) can be performed more quickly than other stem cell transplantation, since cord blood units are preserved in the deep freeze and even three HLA mismatched donors are acceptable. Considering these advantage, we examined the feasibility of CBT including reduced-intensity regimens for adult relapsed patients after allogeneic transplantation. Patients/methods: We reviewed medical records of 32 patients who received CBT at Toranomon Hospital between November 2003 and October 2006. Median age of the patients was 36 years old (range, 18-66). Underlying diseases were acute leukemia (n=25), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n=1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=2) and lymphoma (n=4). The stem cell source of the first transplantation were bone marrow from sibling donor (n=3), bone marrow from unrelated donor (n=10), peripheral blood stem cell from sibling donor (n=7) and unrelated cord blood (n=12). Conditioning regimens comprised fludarabine 125-180 mg/m\u00b2 in several combination with melphalan 80-140 mg/m\u00b2, Busulfan 8-16mg/kg and total body irradiation (4-8 Gy). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine alone (n=4) or tacrolimus alone (n=28). Median number of total nucleated cells and CD34+ cells was 2.56x10 7 cells/kg (1.91-5.94 ) and 0.86x10 5 cells/kg (0.57-1.77), respectively. HLA disparities were 5/6 (n=3), 4/6 (n=26) and 3/6 (n=3). Results: Median observation period after the second transplantation was 78 days (range, 9-485). Overall survival for 1 year was 25% and 18 patients were died of disease progression (n=7) and infection (n=11). Six of 18 dead patients showed engraftment failure. No grade IV toxicities (NCI-CTC Ver.3.0) were observed. Patients with stronger conditioning regimen (such as Flu 180mg/m\u00b2 + Mel 140mg/m\u00b2) presented higher survival rate compared to the patients with reduced-intensity regimen (64% vs 23%). The stage of the disease in the second transplantation, the duration between two transplantations and HLA disparities did not influence the outcome. Discussion: We demonstrated that CBT could be an available and feasible treatment for the relapsed patients after stem cell transplantation. Moreover, the death rate from regimen related toxicities are acceptable even in the patients with an advanced disease.",

Fischler, G. St\u00fcssi, M. Maggiorini, U. Schanz, J.D. Seebach University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, CH) Objectives: Patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have one of the highest mortality rates compared to other ICU patients. Several parameters including need for mechanical ventilation, number of organ dysfunctions and time from transplantation to ICU admission have been related to outcome. Here, we analyzed the clinical parameters of this poor risk patient group in comparison to recipients of allogeneic solid organ transplantation (SOT) admitted to ICU. Methods: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed on all patients admitted to the medical ICU between 2000 and 2004 who had received an allogeneic HSCT or SOT previously. Primarily, overall survival, causes of death, and quality of life at 6 mo were evaluated. In addition, causes leading to ICU admission, time from transplantation to ICU, time from ICU admission to death, number of organ failures and treatment were analyzed. Results: Out of 131 allogeneic HSCT performed 15 patients (11%) were admitted to the ICU 16 times with a 6 mo ICU survival rate of 20% (3/15). The 6 month survival rate after transplantation was 20% in the ICU group compared to 95% (110/116) of the non-ICU group. The three surviving HSCT patients were admitted to ICU 13.7 mo after transplantation, compared to 2.7 months in the 12 patients who died. In the latter death occurred 15 d (0-36 d) following ICU admission. In the same time period a total of 161 SOT patients were admitted to the ICU (27% [average of 120 SOT/year]), with a 6 mo ICU survival rate of 72.2% (114/161). Time from transplantation to ICU admission was 80.5 mo in the solid organ group compared to 4.8 mo after HSCT. Time from ICU admission to death in the SOT group was 9 d (1-530 d) . A detailed analysis of the causes leading to ICU admission, number of organ failures, and required ICU treatment will be presented as well as causes of death. Conclusion: The ICU admission rate of our HSCT patients was low compared to previously published data with a similar 6 mo survival rate. In contrast, SOT recipients admitted to the ICU had a much higher survival rate, and a much longer time between transplantation and ICU admission. These differences reflect the different pattern of risk factors associated with HSCT and SOT, respectively, and will be discussed in the light of the detailed analyses of the events leading to ICU admission.",

            "text": "Very low long-term survival in adult patients needing mechanical ventilator treatment for more than four days after allogeneic stem cell transplantation L.J.C. Brinch (1) Introduction: Patients with respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilator treatment for more than 24 hours after allogeneic stem cell transplantation have a poor prognosis. This is especially the case in patients with bilirubin >68 mmol/L and /or creatinin >177 mmol/L during the first 3-4 days of ventilator treatment, vasopressor treatment for more than 4 hours per 24 hours in the first 3-4 days, and/or lung injury with a need for inspiratory oxygen concentration of more that 60% or a PEEP of more than 5 cm H 2 O 24 to 72 hours after start of ventilator treatment. Two large retrospective studies from the 90-ties have described more than 95% death rate in such patients, and more that 80% in patients not having the mentioned high risk features. Aims of study: To investigate whether these results might have improved during the last 5 years and with the purpose of developing guidelines for intensive care of patients needing mechanical ventilator treatment, we undertook a retrospective survey of Nordic centres performing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 10 Nordic transplant centres asking for the total number of patients transplanted during 2001 until 31.12.2005. We asked how many patients were treated with a mechanical ventilator and how many patients with the above mentioned characteristics were discharged alive from the hospital and how many were still alive after one year. Results: 5 of 10 centres returned the questionnaire. In those centres a total of 711 patients were transplanted. 56 were treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. 11 of these patients were discharged from the intensive care unit, 8 patients could be discharged from the transplant hospital, of whom 2 were still on ventilator treatment. Only 4 patients were alive more that 1 year after transplant.",

Kobbe, N. Hieronimus, T. Graef, I. Bruns, A. Czibere, F. Zohren, N. Safaian, U. Steidl, U. Germing, R. Haas, R. Fenk Heinrich Heine University (Duesseldorf, D) Background: A 6-day course of Palifermin, a human recombinant keratinocyte growth factor has been shown to reduce mucositis and need for supportive care after a very intensive, TBI containing high-dose conditioning regimen. We here combined a short-course of Palifermin (3 days) before high-dose Melphalan (HDM) and a single dose of Pegfilgrastim after stem cell infusion to reduce toxicity in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and methods: So far 18 patients (the Pal-Peg group, 9 male, 9 female, median age 59, range 45-73) with MM myeloma received 3 daily injections of Palifermin (60ug/kg/d) before HDT. At least 24 hours after the last Palifermin dose patients were treated with HDM (median dose 200mg/m\u00b2, range 100-200) followed by ASCT of a median of 3.5 CD34+cells/kg (range 1.9-18.8). Pegfilgrastim (6mg) was given one day after blood stem cell infusion. This group of patients was compared to a previous cohort of 21 patients (the Peg-only-group, 9 male, 12 female, median age 57, range 39-69) with multiple myeloma who had received no Palifermin. In these patients a median of 4.5 CD34+cells/kg (range 2 -12) and a single dose of 6mg Pegfilgrastim were given after HDM. Patients in the Pal-Peg group had more advanced disease. Results: Time to hematopoietic reconstitution was not significantly different in both groups with a median time to a WBC >1x10 9 /l of 11 days (range 9-13) in the Pal-Peg group and 10 days (median, range 9-14) in the Peg-only group. The the same was true for platelet reconstitution. Due to a markedly reduced incidence and severity of mucositis in the Pal-Peg group the duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter (median 17 days, range 13-23 vs 21 days, range 15-34, p<0.05). In addition the need for iv antibiotics (median 0 days, range 0-9 vs 4 days, range 0-21, p<0.05), morphine (median 0 days, range 0-12 vs 4 days, range 0-21) parenteral nutrition (median 0 days, range 0-12 vs 6 days, 0-16, p<0.05) and erythrocyte transfusions (median 0, range 0-4 vs 2, range 0-14, p<0.05) was significantly reduced. Conclusion: The combined use of a 3-day short course of Palifermin before HDM and a single dose of Pegfilgrastim after stem cell transplantation significantly reduces toxicity in patients with multiple myeloma and improves patient convenience. Our data clearly favours the use of Palifermin to reduce toxicity of HDM in patients with MM. However, the need for the full 6 day course seems at least questionable. +ASCT. Median EDSS at base-line was 6.0 (range 1.5 -8.0). The median follow-up duration was 18 months (range 6 -84 months). Neurological and QoL evaluation was provided at baseline, at discharge, at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter following HDCT+ASCT. FACT-BMT and FAMS were used for QoL evaluation. All 27 patients with the follow-up longer than 1 year, included in the analysis, experienced a clinical stabilization or improvement. More than half of them improved: 6 patients showed significant improvement in EDSS (by more than 1.0 point), 4 patients improved by 1.0 point, and 5 patients -by 0.5 points on EDSS. Twelve patients achieved stabilization. Two patients deteriorated to a worse score after 18 months of stabilization; 2 other patients progressed after 12 and 30 months of improvement, respectively. All the patients with clinical stabilization and improvement had negative MRI scans. Out of 21 patients included in the analysis of QoL response 19 exhibited improved QoL 6 months post-transplantation. At one year after HDCT+ASCT 1 patient exhibited a maximal QoL response; 3 patients -good QoL response; 7 patientsmoderate QoL response and 8 patients -minimal QoL response. At 2.5 years post-transplantation 3 more patients had a maximal QoL response. Further QoL improvement was observed at longer follow-up. In conclusion, clinical response was observed in 100% of MS patients after early, conventional and salvage HDCT+ASCT. The majority of patients with clinical response had a good or moderate QoL response. Further studies should be done to investigate the clinical and patient-reported outcomes in MS patients receiving early, conventional and salvage transplantation to better define treatment success. The method of gene transfer into progenitor cells is critical as viral vector transduction involves the risk of tumor induction by non-specific genomic integration. Non-viral transfection systems often fail due to low transfection efficiency. However, gene transfer into human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor (HPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is an essential tool for in vitro-and in vivo-applications and therapeutic strategies such as tissue engineering and gene therapy. We recently reported an transient genetic labelling of human CD34+ HPC with deltaLNGFR-plasmid-DNA for in vivo application: Transient transfection was efficient for both, CD34+ HSC (41%\u00b12.0% ) and leukemia cell lines (55%\u00b14.9%) using the method of nucleofection. Moreover, mature myeloid cells (CD66b+) derived from transfected human CD34+ HPC and leukemia cells maintained deltaLNGFR expression at a high percentage (70% \u00b1 1.6% and 58% \u00b1 2% respectively). In this work, we investigated labelling of CD34+ HPC with mRNA. Human CD34+ HPC and human MSC were transfected with in vitro-transcribed mRNA for deltaLNGFR, a marker gene approved for human in vivo-application, using nucleofection. EGFP was used as a control. 24h after nucleofection, FACS-analysis showed a higher transfection efficiency compared to plasmid transfected CD34+ HPC and MSC: A high transfection frequency was found for mRNAtransfected HPCs using deltaLNGFR (82.4\u00b19.7%) and EGFP (88.7\u00b12.6%). We found also a high transfection rate for MSC using the marker genes deltaLNGFR (92.4\u00b13.6%) and EGFP (83.3\u00b14.1%). Cell viability was not affected by mRNAtransfection. Moreover, differentiation assays of deltaLNGFRselected MSC after transfection, showed that differentiation of MSC into mesenchymal cells like chondrocytes, adipocytes and osteoblasts was not affected by mRNA nucleofection.",

Guglielmi, S. Bergantini, S. Iacobelli, A. van Biezen, E. Olavarria, A. Gratwohl, A. Schattenberg, L. Verdonck, D. Niederwieser, T. de Witte on behalf of the Chronic Leukaemia Working Party of the EBMT Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have radically changed the prognosis of patients (pts) relapsing after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Major obstacles to success with DLI are represented by leukemia resistance and by secondary GvHD (GvHD2). The best result of is when a patient treated with DLI achieve a durable molecular remission (MR) without experiencing GvHD2. It is unclear which factors may predict for such a favourable outcome when CML pts are treated with DLI. We retrospectively identified 500 pts, treated with DLI for CML relapse (16% molecular, 30% cytogenetic, 42% haematological chronic, 12% hematological accelerated) at 68 EBMT centres before 2004: 73% had an HLA-identical sibling donor, 27%unrelated. Single (58%) or multiple (42%) infusions were given. Results: 340 pts(68%)achieved MR in a median of 7.5 months, 44% had GvHD2 in a median of 3 months, 16 pts recurred at a median of 19 months. Actuarial probability of being alive in MR without GvHD2 was 29% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. We studied the prognostic effect of following factors: patient age at DLI, donor type, donor sex, sex mismatch with the donor, phase at SCT, stem cell source, T-depletion, total body irradiation in the conditioning regimen, GvHD prior to DLI, interval from SCT to DLI, type of relapse. Multivariate analysis with a Cox model adjusted for the period of DLI (<1998 vs >1997), showed that chronic GvHD after transplant and prior to relapse (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.5, 95CI: 1.2-1.9, p<0.001), an interval from SCT to DLI <1 year (HR: 1.7, 95CI: 1.3-2.2, p<0.001), and hematological relapse (HR: 1.6, 95CI: 1.2-2.0, p<0.001), were adverse features. 94 pts (20%), 222 (48%), 133 (28%), and 17 (4%) had 0, 1, 2, and 3 adverse features, respectively. Survival in remission without experiencing GvHD2 at 5 years improved from 14%, 30%, to 56% in pts with 2-3, 1, and 0 adverse features, respectively. We conclude that: [a] pure GvL effect (ie. durable remission without GvHD2) was observed in more than 25% of pts treated with DLI for CML relapsing after allogeneic SCT; [b] occurrence of chronic GvHD prior to relapse, the interval from SCT to DLI, and the type of relapse are the main factors associated with the chance of a pure GvL effect; [c] pts treated with DLI beyond 1 year from SCT for a molecular/cytogenetic relapse that was not preceded by chronic GvHD have more than 50% chance of exploiting the pure GvL effect.",

            "text": "Objectives: The therapeutic effect of haplo-identical stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in malignancies and non-malignant diseases depends on reactivity of the graft against undesirable target cells of host origin. The mandatory T cell depletion (TCD) across MHC as the only approach for successful prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can cause graft failure, delayed immune reconstitution and lack of graft-vs.-malignancy effects. Our goal was to induce GVM effects following HSCT while avoiding GVHD. Scientific background. GVHD is induced by alloreactive donor derived T lymphocytes. Previous investigations in murine models suggest that neither na\u00efve nor rIL-2 activated NK cells can cause GVHD. Patients and Methods: Treatment with irradiated lymphokineactivated killer cells (ILAK): was performed in 7 patients after T cell depleted haploidentical HSCT from related donors. All patients had high risk diseases: 3 ALL, 3 AML and 1 X-ALD. Total 17 procedures were performed from 1 to 4 procedures per patient; interval between infusions was 6 to 68 (median 17) days in each session. Donor cells were incubated in the presence of rIL-2 for 96 hours, irradiated with 15 to 30 Gy and infused in doses from 0.7 to 6.2 (median 2.3) x10 7 per kg. In vitro cytotoxicity was controlled for each cell sample. Results: Four out of 7 patients developed symptoms of acute GVHD: 1 grade I, 2 grade III and 1 grade III-IV. In all but one case acute symptoms were reversible with conventional treatment. In one patient we saw no symptoms of GvHD with transition of mixed to 100% donor chimerism. In the last patient effect was difficult to estimate as immediately after the first iLAK infusion relapse of his ALL developed which required appropriate treatment with chemotherapy. In one case after 3 infusions of iLAK, an episode of acute GVHD transformed to chronic gastrointestinal GVHD. Overall survival in this high risk group is 2 out of 7, all five deceased patients suffered relapse of their leukemia, and mortality was not associated with iLAK infusion. Both surviving patients are free of any undesired consequences of iLAK infusion with no chronic GVHD. Conclusion: iLAK can be a safe, inexpensive tool for cellular immunotherapy of residual disease while avoiding severe GVHD after HSCT. The exact dose of ionizing radiation required for complete prevention of GVHD while retaining GVM effects in man, as observed in preclinical animal models, must be determined in a prospective clinical trial. *Igor B. Resnick and Michael Y. Shapira contributed equally to this study.",

Dulphy (1) NK cells constitute a main actor of the anti-tumour immune response. They are divided in two sub-populations according to the expression of CD56. CD56brigth NK cells are specialized in inflammatory cytokines production whereas CD56dim cells are mainly cytotoxic. We investigated the reconstitution of both sub-populations in 43 HLA-matched non T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell donor-recipient pairs using flow cytometry-based analysis. The study was performed on samples before and at 3, 6 and 12 months after graft. We confirmed the early expansion of NK cells as compared to T-cells. However this expansion is observed only for CD56bright cells, resulting in the modification of the ratio between the NK sub-populations. This perturbation is observed for at least one year after graft. Recipient CD56brigth NK cells show an overexpression of the activating receptors NKG2D and NKp46 and the inhibitory receptor NKG2A as compared to donor CD56brigth populations. Interestingly the intra-cellular perforin is also overexpressed in recipient CD56brigth NK cells and this overexpression correlates with the occurrence of acute Graftversus-Host disease. We confirmed the capacity of recipient CD56bright NK cells to degranulate perforin and to expose CD107a on the cell-surface during lysis of target cells. Our results would suggest an impact of NK cell sub-populations on the induction of GvH reaction in HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients.",

Aloisi, F. Aversa, M.F. Martelli, A. Velardi University of Perugia (Perugia, I) After haploidentical stem cell transplantation immune recovery is inevitably slow and infectious related mortality is about 30-40%. Immune reconstitution could be improved by infusing donor T cells, but the obstacle is Graft-versus-Host Disease. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction, alloantigen-stimulated T cells uptake 4,5-dibromorhodamine methyl ester (TH9402), a compound that is structurally similar to rhodamine. TH9402 preferentially localizes in mitochondria and when exposed to 500-600 nm wave-length visible light delivered through the TheraluxTM device (Celmed, Montreal, Canada) it becomes highly cytotoxic through oxidative damage. This study investigated a range of parameters, and combinations thereof, with the aim of achieving optimal T cell allodepletion and preservation of pathogen-specific responses. We report on 9 clinical scale dry-runs which reproducibly yielded the following results. PBMC were stimulated with haploidentical irradiated (20 Gy) PBMC in a MLR. Cells were then incubated with TH9402 and exposed to light delivered through the TheraluxTM device. Optimal conditions for T cell allodepletion emerged as: 1) duration of mixed lymphocyte reaction: 24 hours; 2) responder cell concentration: 3-5 x 106/ml; 3) TH9402 concentration: 5 \u00ecM; 4) quantity of internalized TH9402, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI): 20,000-25,000 MFI;",

In all groups studied, MSCs at P2 expressed higher levels of p53, Rb and H-Ras and lower levels of p16 in comparison to MNCs from the same patients. More specifically, statistical significant differences between MNCs and MSCs at P2 were shown on the expression levels of p53, Rb and H-Ras, in the ITP group. Similar expression patterns were found in neutropenia apart from p53 and in solid tumor samples with the exception of H-Ras. However, there were no differences in expression levels between passages P2 and P6 and between P2 and HUVEC. In ALL samples though, expression levels were similar between MNCs and MSCs at P2. These results indicate that despite the differences in oncogene and TSG expression levels between MNCs and MSCs, the profile of the same genes does not change during cultivation of MSCs up to passage 6. This finding, combined with the similar expression levels between MSCs and HUVEC cells, suggests that MSCs may not be transformed for a number of serial passages.",

Giebel (1) NK cells are considered to play a role in anti-infectious and anti-leukemic reactions. Their phenotypic maturation is gradual and is expected to eventually resemble the donor-type pattern. The goal of this study was to assess factors influencing NK cell maturation and association of this process with clinical outcome. Seventy adult patients with hematological malignancies given alloHSCT from sibling (n=28) or unrelated (n=42) donor were included. NK cell phenotype was studied in the donor before HSCT and in the recipient on days +28, +56, +100 and +180, using antibodies specific for KIR2DL1/DS1, KIR2DL2-3/DS2, KIR3DL1/DS1, and NKG2A. Individual pattern was created for each donor based on frequencies of NK cells expressing respective receptors together with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). To quantify differences between donor and recipient after alloHSCT, we developed a new discrepancy index (DI) based on sum of differences defined as distances in coordinate system constructed by frequencies and MFI axes. DI equaled 8.0 (3.2-15.1) on day +28 and decreased to 7.4 (2.6-15.0) on day +56 (p=0.003, vs. d. +28), 6.3 (2.3-15.0) on day +100 (p=0.001, vs. d. +28), and 6.2 (1.8-11.4) on day +180 (p=0.0005, vs. d. +28). At all time-points NK cells had increased expression of NKG2A compared to the donors. On days +28, +56, and +100 DI values correlated negatively with the number of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ cells, and were increased for patients receiving steroids for the treatment of acute GVHD. A positive correlation was found between the DI and a maximum dose of methylpredisolone but not with the grade of acute GVHD. On day +180 DI was increased for patients receiving CsA (p=0.04) which, however, did not depend on the presence of chronic GVHD. The OS rate at 18 months was higher for patients with DI <9 vs. >9 on day +28 (83% vs. 64%, p=0.04). The difference resulted from NRM, which was associated with late fatal infections (10% vs. 32%, respectively, p=0.02). Conclusions: The pattern of NK cell phenotypic reconstitution after alloHSCT generally tends to recapitulate the donor-type. The process is negatively affected by the use of steroids and cyclosporin, and seems to be parallel to reconstitution of T cells. In turns, delayed maturation of NK cells may contribute to impaired anti-infectious defense translating into decreased survival. The proposed discrepancy index appears feasible to quantify differences between donor and recipient NK cell phenotype pattern.",

D'Arena, L. Aloj, G. Corazzelli, F. Frigeri, S. Lastoria, A. Pinto National Cancer Institute, Fond. Pascale (Naples, I) Objectives: The use of prophylactic G-CSF is associated to the increase of bone marrow (BM) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake as detected by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In contrast, no data is available as to changes in BM FDGuptake during peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization. This study was aimed at investigating patterns of BM FDG uptake during mobilization as quantified by Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) determinations. We also evaluated whether PET scanning may turn of value for identifying good and poor mobilizers. To our knowledge, this is the first PETbased study in this setting. Methods: Nine patients(pts)(M/F=6/3), median age 41 yrs (r 33-60), with relapsed lymphoma (NHL/HD=8/1) without BM involvement, were accrued after informed consent. Baseline PET was obtained at relapse, before salvage therapy and any CSF administration. After salvage regimes, pts were mobilized by VRL/CTX or idARA-C; G-CSF (10 ug/kg/day) was given from day +4 through apheresis. PET scans were obtained on day +9 or +10 (after nadir with a WBC>1000/ul). SUVmax and average (avg) were measured (whole lumbar spine and bilateral iliac regions) and compared to SUV of the same BM regions at baseline PET. The aim was to calculate a BM specific D-SUV (mobilizing vs steady-state D-SUV) for each single patient. Results: Five pts mobilized PBSC (median CD34 peak 42.8/ul, r 27.9-280.5/ul; median CD34 in the harvest 3.3 x 10 6 /Kg, r 2.1-12.5) while 4 pts were poor mobilizers (median CD34 peak 10.9/ul, r 7.5-14.1/ul). In the group of good mobilizers, apheresis was performed at CD34 peak (day +11,+13), with a median of 1 apheresis/pt (r 1-2). Unexpectedly, effective mobilization was associated with a low BM uptake of FDG: median BM D-SUVmax and D-SUVavg of 3.0 (r 1.0-3.8) and 3.3 (r 0.9-3.9), respectively. In contrast, poor mobilizers displayed a median D-SUVmax and D-SUVavg of 5.7 (r 2.4-12.8) and 6.9 (r 4.1-14.2), respectively. Conclusions: While BM FDG uptake usually increases upon CSF administration, our results suggest that PBSC mobilization may be associated with a complex metabolic pattern of BM as detected by PET. We documented that, 48 to 72 hrs before CD34 peak, poor mobilizers display a higher BM FDG uptake (D-SUV>4) as compared to good mobilizers (D-SUV<4). These preliminary results indicate that BM PET may represent a new tool for early identification of poor mobilizers allowing a timely modification of the mobilization strategy to possibly rescue the procedure.",

MSCs can suppress immune response by multiple mechanisms. GVHD still remains the major complication of allo-HSCT, especially MUD and haploidentical setting. The usage of MSCs for prophylaxis and treatment of severe GVHD (both acute and chronic) seems to be reasonable (K.LeBlank,2004). Patients and methods: From 10.2005 till 11.2006 7 patients (pts) received co-transplantation of HSC and MSCs for prophylaxis of GVHD and 7 pts received isolated infusions of MSCs for treatment of acute and chronic steroid-resistant (aGVHD, chGVHD). Diagnosis of patients (pts): AML-4, ALL-5, MDS-1, CML-BC-2, NHL-2. Related allo-HSC was performed in 6 pts, MUD-6 pts, haploidentical (haplo)-2 pts.",

The number of episodes of respiratory tract infection during follow-up varied from 1 to 4, median 1.6 episodes per patient. Ten of the 155 patients (6.5%) acquired HMPV infection. The prevalence was 7% in 2001, 3.1% in 2002 and 10.6% in 2003. HMPV was detected during fall, winter and spring months. Eight of the 10 HMPV positive samples were sequenced. Both HMPV group A and B circulated each year. In 2001, 2 of the 3 HMPV detected (75%) belonged to group A; in 2002 group A and B circulated equally and in 2003, HMPV group A (75%) predominated over group B. One patient died on day +16, eight days after HMPV infection was diagnosed. However, death could not be attributed to HMPV since influenza B coinfection was detected in this case. Conclusions: Prevalence rates of HMPV infection in HSCT recipients living in Brazil were similar to those observed in northern hemisphere. The majority of HMPV infections were diagnosed in late winter and spring.

Zander (2) (1)Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK); (2)University Medical Centre Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) Introduction: Life-threatening complications such as graftversus-host disease and infection remain major barriers to the success of allogenic bone marrow transplantation (aBMT). A growing body of evidence indicates that genetic factors are involved in an increased risk of infection.Genetic factors within the innate immune system are increasingly being identified and their role in a clinical setting is under investigation. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has emerged as an important innate host defense molecule.MBL binds a range of pathogens independently of antibody and activates complement lysis and phagocytosis.It is a C-type serum lectin produced by the liver, and it responds as an acute-phase reactant.MBL is a central player in the innate immune response. Objectives: We investigated whether NBL gene polymorphisms causing low levels of MBL are associated with the development of infection and GvHD in patients undergoing aBMT. Methods: From 01/2001 to 10/2003 a total of 131 patients (age range 14 to 69 years, mean 43.5) were enrolled in a combined retro-and prospective study. Frequency, causes of infections and episodes of GVHD were recorded, and MBL genotype of recipient and donor were determined by heteroduplex analysis and MBL phenotype by ELISAs. Serial MBL concentrations were also measured pre BMT, day 0-45 and day 46-7 post aBMT, and the results correlated with the MBL genotype (A/A indicating wild type, A/O indicating heterozygous for MBL structural-gene mutations and O/O indicating homozygous, for such mutations). Results: MBL concentrations increased between days 0 and 45 in all patients (A/A p<0,001) from pre-transplant levels. Between days 46-75 levels fell significantly (A/A p<0.0001, A/O p=0.005 and O/O p=0.005).",

Only 3 patients (pts) had candidemia [C. parapsilosis (Cp) n=2; C. guilliermondii (Cg) n=1)]. All were on Caspofungin (C) therapy. Pt 1 A 18 year-old male with aplastic anemia received a 1st unrelated SCT in 01/2004 without engraftment (E). He later had a definite lung invasive aspergillosis (IA) treated with Voriconazole (V). He received a 2nd unrelated cord blood transplant in 05/2005. V was continued as 2ry prophylaxis. V was switched to C on day (d) 7. On d 48, a blood culture (BC) was positive (+) for Cp. C was stopped [total treatment duration (TTD) = 47 d] and liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) was started. Due to the pt's poor condition, the central vein catheter (CVC) was not removed. BCs became negative on d 54. The pt died from multi-organ failure and no E on d 72. Skin and throat colonization (Co) with Cp was documented from d 39. Pt 2 A 46-year old male with ALL received a genoidentical SCT in 05/2005. Antifungal prophylaxis (AP) consisted of fluconazole (F). C was empirically started on d 6.

A clinical trial with 0.4mg/kg of Etanercept twice/week in FA patients with severe marrow hypocellularity (less than 25%), no overt MDS or leukemia who lack a stem cell donor was approved by Gaslini Institute Ethical Committee (EC). MN, boy 9 years and GD, boy 7 years entered the trial 12 and 8 months after diagnosis of FA, with deteriorating blood counts and unavailability of stem cell donor. Marrow apoptosis of MN after Etanercept start decreased (annexin V+ cells) and so did intracellular TNF-a and IFN-g. Committed progenitor growth mildly increased after Etanercept start in both MN and GD. LTCIC were 0 in both MN and GD prior to and after therapy. Etanercept neither improved nor worsened blood count and transfusion frequency in both patients. No relevant side effects occurred. The drug reached a plateau in peripheral serum of 0.4mg/ml in both patients after 2 months and a level of 0.12-0.27mg/ml in the marrow after 1 month. TNF-a increased in peripheral serum to 140-270pg/ml and in marrow serum to 100-180pg/ml. Levels were 2500-5000-fold lower than those of serum Etanercept and 1500-3500-fold lower than those of marrow Etanercept. Bioassay showed that both serum and marrow TNF-a were biologically inactive. MN was transplanted 100 days after start of Etanercept with an 8/10 antigen compatible donor identified 30 days earlier. GD is still on Etanercept, 5 months after start. No optimal stem cell donor is identified as yet. These data show: 1. Etanercept was safe in the treated patients. 2. The drug reaches the marrow in biologically active amounts. 3. The initial increase of TNF-a is not biologically active as it is neutralized by Etanercept as shown by the lack of activity in the bioassay. 4. No relevant impact was seen on the blood count and transfusion requirement. 5. Marrow apoptosis, progenitor growth and cytokine burden were improved thus suggesting that the drug may have a role in contrasting marrow failure progression of FA. Points 4. and 5 can be explained by the too advanced stage of marrow failure that while precluding gross haematological improvements might have allowed subclinical changes. The EC of Gaslini Institute, has now approved a protocol amendment to enrol patients at an earlier stage of marrow failure. This may enable to evaluate the impact of this experimental treatment also on blood and marrow cellularity.(4%). Height (HT), weight (WT), pubertal status and IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels were assessed at each visit. A growth hormone (GH) stimulation test (arginine test) was performed before SCT and when indicated after SCT. Results: The median maximum GH peak (maxGH) in the arginine test before SCT was 8.8 ng/ml (0.4 -44.7), N = 172, with 19 4 ng/ml (group 1), 27% > 4 and <8 ng/ml (group 2) and 54% 8 ng/ml (group 3). maxGH was not correlated to IGF-I (SDS) and IGFBP-3 (SDS) levels, HT-SDS, difference between HT-SDS and target HT-SDS (delta THT), changes in HT-SDS (delta HT-SDS) during follow-up and prior radiotherapy treatment. maxGH was negatively correlated to BMI (SDS). IGF-I (SDS) and IGFBP-3 (SDS) levels were pos. correlated over the entire follow-up period. Increases in IGF-I (delta IGF-I) within the first year pos. correlated with delta IGF-I during further follow-up. Delta IGF-I and delta IGFBP-3 were pos. correlated during 3 years after SCT. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were pos. correlated with HT-SDS over the entire follow-up. Prior radiotherapy was not correlated to HT-SDS, delta THT and IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels. Delta HTSDS after 2, 3, 4 and 5 years was correlated with radiotherapy given as part of the SCT regimen. Taking HT-SDS before SCT into account, HT-SDS after 1 to 5 years was correlated to the presence or absence of radiotherapy for SCT. Delta HT-SDS was pos. correlated to delta WT-SDS over the entire follow-up period. Delta HT-SDS after \u00bd and 1 year were pos. correlated with delta HT-SDS during further follow-up. Conclusions: Early increases after SCT in HT-SDS, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 may enable us to predict changes during later followup. After SCT, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 seem to be in part differentially regulated.

            "text": "Efficient prevention of veno-occlusive disease of the liver with defibrotide after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. An extended study Y. Chalandon, E. Roosnek, C. Helg, F. Verholen, S. Knipp, H. Ozsahin, J. Passweg University Hospital of Geneva (Geneva, CH) Veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) of the liver is reported to occur in 10-30% of patients after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with mortality rates up to 50%. We previously reported a pilot study of VOD prophylaxis with defibrotide (Prociclide Crinos, Como, Italy) showing a significantly lower rate of VOD as compared to historical controls. We now report the results of an extended study. Between 2000 and 2006, 157 consecutive patients were transplanted for hematological diseases. Median age was 43 y (range 5-61 y), M/F: 96/61; diagnosis was AML=42, ALL=19, CML=28, MDS/MPS=24, lymphoma=22, MM=12, AA=7, solid tumor=3. Donors were HLA-identical siblings (65%), unrelated (32%) mismatched relatives (3%). Stem cell source was peripheral blood (87%) or bone marrow (13%). The transplants were T-cell depleted by CAMPATH-1H in vitro, with (73%) or without (7%) T-cell add-back or left unmanipulated (20%). Conditioning was myeloablative with CyTBI (53%), BuCy (10%) other myeloablative (7%) or nonmyeloablative (30%) using Fludara/Bu/ATG. GVHD prophylaxis was CSA with or without MTX or MMF. Nine pts received a second transplant for relapse or graft failure. Defibrotide was given intravenously 6 hourly starting prior to conditioning up to day +21 posttransplant (dose range 20-30 mg/kg) in addition to low dose heparin. The Baltimore criteria were used to score VOD. Results: No VOD was observed after 165 transplants. Defibrotide was well tolerated and no side effects were attributed to this medication. Median peak levels of bilirubin were 21 umol/l (range 9-286 umol/l), aPTT: 34.5 sec (range 24-83 sec) and fibrinogen: 7.1 g/l (range 3.1-10 g/l). Day 100 survival was 91.5% (95% CI 87-96%). With a median followup of 33 mths (range 3-83 mths), 2 year OS, TRM and RR were 62% (95% CI 56-70%), 17.5% (95% CI 11-24%) and 35.5% (95% CI 26.5-44.5%) respectively. The incidence of aGVHD II was 25 % (95% CI 4-39%). Conclusion: The results of this extended study suggest that defibrotide is an effective prophylaxis for VOD.",

Goldstone University College London Hospital (London, UK) Background: Since the onset of the ambulatory care (AC) initiative at University College London Hospitals (UCLH), over 250 patients have received acute haematology treatments previously delivered as in-patients. In order to maximise efficiency in the AC facility and ensure robust governance all aspects of the service have been audited prospectively. Aims: The primary aim of the AC service is to safely transfer the delivery of in-patient treatments to the ambulatory setting. Objectives: \u2022 To define eligibility of patients for outpatient/ambulatory transplant \u2022 To identify and minimise risk factors when adapting inpatient transplant treatments to the ambulatory setting \u2022 To determine reasons for and potential median day of transfer to hospital for specific transplant protocols Sample: Since December 2004 108 patients have received either autologous or low intensity allogenic (LI) transplantation in AC; 50 (46%) a BEAM autograft, 29 (27%) a Melphalan autograft and 29 (27%) a LI allogenic transplant. Results/Discussion: Audit results show reasons for hospital transfer from AC fall into 7 categories: GI symptoms, febrile neutropenia, non-neutropenic fever, fatigue, anxiety, drug reactions and carer issues. Data allows the identification of median day of hospitalisation for transplant patients; day +3 for BEAM autograft, day +4 for Melphalan autograft and day+4 for LI allogenic transplant. Of the 108 transplant patients in AC 13 (12%) have required out-of-hours hospital admissions due to febrile neutropenia, 5(38%), GI symptoms,3 (23%), drug reactions, 3(23%), non-neutropenic infections, 1(8%) and anxiety 1(8%). Infection issues, including infectious seasonal outbreaks, continue to pose a risk and complicate hospital admissions from AC. In order to reduce risk to all patients, Unit policies have been amended and practice reviewed within the ongoing audit. Conclusion: Our findings augment data presented at EMBT 2006; for eligible patients, autograft and allograft transplantation remain suitable ambulatory treatments in the hotel setting. A diverse patient-mix is necessary to optimise AC space and staff resources and robust out-of-hour policies, risk management and infection control procedures are fundamental in order to provide a safe AC service. Admission to hospital for these transplant patients is ultimately inevitable. However, efficiencies in in-patient bed usage, cost savings and improvements in patient satisfaction are advantageous.",

Arat School of Medicine, Ankara University (Ankara, TR) STRs were widely used for monitoring of chimerism after allo-HCT. The effect of STR disparity on allo-HCT has been analyzed in a few studies. We aimed to evaluate the impact of STR disparity on allo-HCT outcome retrospectively in our single center cohort. Between Sep 2000 and May 2005, total 88 patients (F/M:45/43) underwent allo-HCT from an HLA-S198 identical sibling donor (PB/BM: 71/17) Median age was 34 ys (16-64). Multiplex PCR was performed to amplify 16 STR loci (D3S1358, HUMvWA, D16S539,D2S1338, Amelogenin,D8S1179, D21S11,D18S51, D19S433, THO1, FGA, D7S820, CSF1PO, D13S317, TPOX, D5S818) (ABI Prism 310). These loci were classified as full-and partialmatched, and full mismatched(mm) between donors and recipients.Results:D2S1338 locus (full matched, 21.6%-n=19; partial matched 50 %-n=44 and full mm 28.4 %-n=25) was the most informative one, but CSF1PO (43.2 %, n=4; 52.2 %, n=46 and 4.5%, n=38, respectively) was the least. The general incidences of acute(a) severe and chronic(c)GvHD were 29.5% and 61.8%. Full mm in TPOX locus (p=0.04) led to more acute severe GvHD than in partial matched or full matched loci. However, full mm in D2S1338 locus significantly decreased the incidence of aGvHD in patients with partial matched and full matched loci (5.3%, 29.5% and 48%, respectively p=0.009). However, more cGvHD was only seen in the patients with full matched D7S820 donors (p=0.04). In our cohort,2-year probability of disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS) were 53.1% \u00b15.9 and 66.2 %\u00b15.6, respectively in mean 46.5\u00b13.8 moths of follow-up. Although the full-mm in D8S1179 locus increased the relapse incidence (62.5% vs 33.3% vs 18.8%, p=0.04), there was a tendency to a decrease of DFS in patients with full-mm CSF1PO or partial matched D7S820 (p=0.06). Early transplant-related mortality increased in patients with D7S820 full-mm (p=0.02). This unfavorable effect was reflected on OS (p=0.002).Besides, patients with full-mm TPOX locus had a decreased probability of OS. TPOX and D7S820 were also less informative resembling CSF1PO.We were not able to show any correlation of stem cell source, conditioning regimen, donor or recipient age, and sex mm on early TRM, aGVHD, cGVHD, and OS rate. Conclusion:The presence of STR disparity could be associated with the development of complications and unfavorable survival probability after allo-HCT from HLAidentical siblings.This analysis approach should be repeated on partial matched and unrelated donor transplants.",

Zanni , M. Magni, A. Rambaldi, F. Benedetti, R. Rosato, R. Passera, K. Patti, F. Ciceri, A. Gallamini, S. Cortellazzo, I. Majolino, S. Mirto, P. Corradini, M. Boccadoro, A. Andreini, T. Barbui, A.M. Gianni, C. Tarella on behalf of GITIL Introduction: The occurrence of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemias (sMDS/AL) is a critical issue in the autograft setting, and represents a major cause of failure in both non-Hodgkin s (NHL) and Hodgkin s Lymphoma (HL) potentially cured after high-dose chemotherapy. However, the reported cumulative incidences of sMDS/AL are quite various, ranging between 3 up to 24%. Aim of the study: To evaluate the frequency and risk factors of sMDS/AL in a large series of lymphoma patients, treated with high-dose sequential (HDS) regimen followed by Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells (PBPC) autograft. Methods: During the last 2 decades 1266 lymphoma patients were treated with HDS at 10 Italian Centers associated to GITIL. All patients received either the original or somewhat modified HDS regimen with autograft; PBPC were usually collected after hd.cyclophosphamide; PBPC harvested after a second mobilization procedure with hd-Ara-C were employed in a subgroup of patients. The series included 213 HL and 1053 NHL patients (630 high-grade and 423 low-grade NHL). Median age was 46 yrs. Overall, 595 patients received HDS as first-line therapy, and 671 patients as salvage treatment. Most patients were autografted with PBPC (median CD34+ve cells: 8x106/kg) and only few patients received BM cells. TBI was employed only in 7% of patients. Results: At a median follow-up of 5 yrs, the 5-yr Overall Survival (OS) projection is 64%. Overall, 38 (3%) patients developed sMDS/AL, with a cumulative incidence of sMDS/AL of 4.2% at 5 yrs. Median time of sMDS/AL occurrence was 2.2 yrs since autograft. Several clinical parameters, including age, sex, histology, disease status, BM involvement, were assessed for possible association with sMDS/AL occurrence; however, none of them appeared to be of relevance. Patients autografted with PBPC collected after hd-Ara-C had a higher risk of sMDS/AL development. On multivariate analysis this was the only parameter marginally associated with sMDS/AL occurrence. Conclusions: Overall, the incidence of sMDS/AL observed following HDS is among the lowest reported so far in lymphoma patients treated with high-dose therapy and autograft. The autograft performed with large quantities of CD34+ve cells and the preferential use of TBI-free conditioning regimens might have lowered the risk of sMDS/AL occurrence. In addition, the study suggests that the type of graft employed in the autografting procedure may be critical for sMDS/AL development.",

            "text": "Neurologic complication of cyclosporine in bone marrow transplanted thalassaemic patients, a 10-year experience M. Ramzi, A. Parhizkar, H. Haghighi Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, IR) Background: Cyclosporine neurotoxicity is an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), reported as the most common neurologic complication of BMT. Identification of risk factors can help physicians to predict the probability of this complication, so prepare to detect and manage it at early stages and decrease complications. Goal of this study was determination of frequency, presentations and risk factors of neurotoxicity of cyclosporine in thalasemic patients after allogenic BMT. Methods: During 10 years 117 thalasemic patients underwent allogenic marrow transplantation. Conditioning chemotherapy regimen were Busulfan and cyclophosphamide \u00b1 antithymocyte globulin. The GVHD prophylaxis regimen was cyclosporine and methyl prednisolone with or without methotrexate. In order to find any risk factor many clinical features were compared between patients with cyclosporine neurotoxicity and ones without it. We used statistic methods. Results: Cyclosporine induced neurotoxicity was developed in 27(23.1%) of patients at an average time of 39.1 days posttransplantation. It was responsible for 42.8% of all-causes of neurologic sequella in bone marrow transplanted thalasemic patients. Headache was the most common manifestation of cyclosporine neurotoxicity in these patients (74%). Other neurotoxic manifestations in order of frequency were: Seizure(62.9%) ,Decrease-level of consciousness (55.6%), visual problems(33.3%). Patients with cyclosporine neurotoxicity were significantly older than ones without it (P=0.037). Blood pressure and serum creatinine level of patients with cyclosporine neurotoxicity at the time of presentation were significantly elevated with respect to admission time (P=0.000, 0.009 in order) but BUN was not different (P=0.101). Analysis of risk factors showed that degree of splenomegally, status of chelation therapy and Pesaro risk classification group are significantly related to cyclosporine neurotoxicity in univariate analysis(P=0.05, 0.004, 0.012 in order). Conclusion: Cyclosporine induced neurotoxicity has a considerable incidence in bone marrow transplanted thalasemic patients (23.1%) causing significant morbidity. This study shows that irregular chelation, large splenomegally (4 cm or above) or presence of splenectomy and Pesaro risk classification group III significantly increase the risk of cyclosporine neurotoxicity.Aims: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) -associated microangiopathy (TAM) is one of the important complication. We have previously reported the intestinal type of TAM (i-TAM), which was clinically similar to gut GVHD, worse prognosis and might be associated with immunosuppressant. Gut GVHD is well documented pathologically as apoptotic enterocolitis. However, i-TAM has not been well described pathologically. Aims of this study are to establish the histological criteria of i-TAM distinguishing from gut-GVHD and to show the frequency of i-TAM. Cases and pathological examinations: We have reviewed 74 cases of biopsy materials under colonoscopy from our SCT case file (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . Non-GVHD gut complication cases were selected by following eligibility, without evidence of acute skin GVHD, no evidence of CMV infection, biopsied within 3 days after clinical symptoms and without additional immunosuppressive therapy. All cases were histologically examined focusing on the characteristic findings; 1. apoptotic enterocolitis with intraepithelial lymphocytes infiltration (gut-GVHD), 2. microangiopathy of capillary and small vessels, 3. cryptogenic epithelial cells degeneration without apoptosis, 4. crypt ghost with wedge shaped ischemic changes, 5. residual neuroendocrine cells nest, 6. platelet thrombi, 7. hemorrhage (2-7 were i-TAM), 8. CMV inclusion cells. Results: 5 cases were fulfilling the eligibility and also clinical TAM criteria. 4 of them were showed i-TAM as ischemic colitis with microangiopathy, non-apoptotic enterocolitis and 1 of CMV colitis, respectively. These 4 cases were showed microangiopathy, endothelial cells degeneration, wall thickening with myxofibromatous degeneration and decreased vascular myocyte. Cryptogenic degeneration without apoptosis was observed in all. Platelet thrombi were observed in 1 case. Residual neuroendocrine cells nests were observed in 2 cases. 74 cases were histologically subdivided into 8 of gut-GVHD, 10 of gut-GVHD and i-TAM, 33 of i-TAM, 8 of CMV enterocolitis and 16 of others by according histological findings. i-TAM cases had each 2-5 findings with various grade and no evidence of apoptotic changes. Platelets thrombi were rarely observed. Conclusion: i-TAM could be defined pathologically as ischemic enterocolitis with microangiopathy and non-apoptotic enteropathy. i-TAM was high frequent HSCT complication than gut-GVHD. Reference to specific findings is need for differential diagnosis between i-TAM and gut-GVHD.",

Stancheva, E. Semenova, N. Zubarovskaya, O. Paina, E. Morozova, S. Bondarenko, E. Darskaya, L. Zubarovskaya, B. Afanasyev St. Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University (St. Petersburg, RUS) Myeloablative conditioning regimens have severe organotoxicity with different complications. The goal of many investigations is to find the medicine with sufficient myeloablative effect and lower organotoxicity. One of candidates with such options is treosulfan (\"Medac\"). The aim of our study: to estimate efficacy and toxicity of two conditioning regimens in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT): treosulfan (TREO) + cyclophosphamid (CY) (1-st group) and busulfan (BU) + CY (2-nd group).The allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in patients with relapsed or secondary hematological malignancies occurring after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) is the potential curative salvage treatment option. However, cumulative toxicity of chemo-and radiotherapy remains the main cause of early mortality. We evaluated long-term outcome of alloHCT following autoHCT after median 24 (5-73) months in 14 pts, median age 38 (27-53) years with relapsed or secondary hematological malignancies. The indication for alloHCT was relapse of AML (4 pts), CML (3 pts) or lymphoma (5 pts: 2-HD, 1-NHL, 2-MM) and secondary AML after lymphoma treatment in 2 pts. Different conditioning regimen were used: fludarabine-based reduced intensity regimen in 9 pts, TBI/Cy in 2 pts, and Treo/Cy, BuCy2, and BEAM respectively in 3 other pts. The patients received infusion of filgastrim-mobilized PBSC (11 pts), bone marrow cells (1 patient) or cord blood (1 patient) from HLA-matched sibling (11 pts), HLA-mismatched sibling (1 patient) or unrelated HLA-matched donor (1 pts). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA and a short course of MTX in 10 pts or CsA and MMF in 4 pts. ATG was added in 5 pts. Two patients developed non-fatal early complication of vascular origin (SOS-1, capillary leak syndrome-1). The incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV was 29% (4/14 pts). Chronic GvHD occurred in 7/12 (58%) pts surviving day 100, extensive in 6 cases. With a median follow-up of 20 (2-123) months 6/14 pts died, 1 in first 100 days after alloHCT due to multiorgandysfunction syndrome and 5 after 100 days (GVHD-2, relapse-1, pulmonary hemorrhage-1, HUS-1). OS and PFS were 45% (95% CI 14-76) and 47% (95% CI 17-78) respectively at 5 years estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The cumulative incidence of NRM was 46% (95% CI 24-90). Conclusions: Our findings on a limited number of pts confirmed that alloHCT may offer a sustained remission in high proportion of poor prognosis patients with relapsed or secondary hematological malignancies after autoHCT with acceptable early toxicity, but still high NRM. Reduced intensity or low-toxicity conditioning regimen should be considered to reduce the rate of side effects. High incidence of chronic GVHD remains the main cause of morbidity. It suggests that new GVHD prophylaxis strategy should be studied in further clinical trials for heavily pretreated patients with advanced hematological malignancies.",

Koristek, M. Tomiska, E. Tesarova, J. Mayer Masaryk University Hospital (Brno, CZ) Introduction and Methods: Several side effects of ATG are described. However, ATG-caused acute hemolysis has not been systematically studied. In context with our retrospective data presented on EBMT 2006 meeting, we designed a prospective study protocol of monitoring the patient with ATG administration during the period January -October 2006. The patients (pts) were immunohematologicaly tested before, during, and after the ATG administration. Standard laboratory markers of hemolysis and the clinical status of the patient were also monitored. Results: Ten pts were eligible (Bu+Flu+ATG, n=3; Bu+Cy+ATG, n=1; FLAMSA+Cy+ATG, n=4), transplanted mostly for myeloid malignancies, and aplastic anemia, n=2.None of these pts showed any signs of hemolysis or the presence of anti-erythrocytes antibodies before conditioning. ATG (Fresenius) was given either at the dose 10 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days or 20 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days. Eight of 10 pts (80%) showed elevated bilirubin and LDH levels, all pts (100%) showed elevated free plasma hemoglobin and decrease in haptoglobin. Nine of 10 pts (90%) showed decrease in hemoglobin level more than 20g/L after the 2nd dose of ATG. Platelet count decreased rapidly in all pts (100%) during the administration of ATG. Number of substituted packed red blood cells units ranged from 2 to 8 units and number of platelet transfusion units ranged from 2 to 5 during 5 days from the start of the ATG. Screening papaintests gave unspecific positivity, but both the indirect and direct antiglobulin tests were negative. We performed 5 tests to detect the reactivity of serum with erythrocytes incubated with ATG and the reactivity of serum in the presence of ATG. We compared them with negative controls. Both tests with erythrocytes incubated with ATG and tests with ATG administration to serum-erythrocytes reaction were positive for hemolysis. Conclusion: ATG causes hemolysis laboratory and also clinically. The action of ATG is doubled -in immunocomplex reaction and the adsorbtion on pts erythrocytes but the direct antiglobulin test was never positive. We can only speculate that the antibody reaction passed but the antibody is unstable a can be detected only in enzymatic tests. ATG administration is linked with potentially clinically serious hemolysis requiring therapy and with unspecific immunohematological reactions for hemolysis.",

Parikh Tata Memorial Hospital (Mumbai, IND) Objective: Late persistent decline in platelet count after primary engraftment of platelets not due to relapse, called secondary failure of platelet recovery, (SFPR) is a significant problem after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The reported incidence in literature is approximately 20%. We analyzed the incidence, clinical features, risk factors and outcome of SFPR in Indian patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and outcome of SFPR in Indian patients undergoing allogenic HSCT. SFPR was defined as decline in platelet count below 20,000/mm 3 for 7 consecutives days or requiring platelet transfusion after achieving sustained platelet count over 50,000/mm 3 without transfusion for 7 consecutive days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.(HSCT). Results: The study population consisted of 210 consecutives patients who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation at our centre between 1983-Aug 2006. Majority of these patients were males (81%) and most common indication for transplant was Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (81%). 21/210 (10%) developed SFPR. Median time of onset of SFPR after HSCT was 65 days (34-254). 13 patients (61.9%) had associated neutropenia. Immediate post transplant complications in these group were acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) followed by sepsis and venoocclusive disease. 3/21 patients who developed SFPR were CMV positive and 2/21 developed antiplatelet antibodies. The most common factors associated with SFPR were GVHD, CMV DNA positivity and infection.15/21(71%) died following SFPR, median survival after HSCT being 150 days (49-810). Conclusion: Secondary failure of platelet recovery is a significant problem after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and is associated with high mortality. Thrombocytopenia leads to utilization of substantial financial resources also. Further studies are needed to understand the pathogenesis of this entity so that effective preventive strategies can be planned. non selected cancer patients (pts). This study involved 2068 pts (879 female, 1189 male) and 86 clinical departments, including hematology departments with 419 pts either hospitalized (n=391) or ambulatory (n=28). Height, current and usual body weight were assessed and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Malnutrition was defined when BMI<18.5 (18-74 yrs) or BMI<21 ( 75 yrs) and/or when pts presented weight loss 10% from the beginning of the disease. On the 2068 pts, nutritional status was available for 1903 pts (377 pts in hematology with 73 autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplant (HSCT) pts and 37 allogeneic HSCT pts). Overall, the prevalence of malnutrition was 39%. Among the 377 pts presenting a hematological malignancy, 34% were severely malnourished (36% lymphoid versus 30% myeloid malignancies). The prevalence of malnutrition was particularly high for ALL pts (48%; n=31), Band T-NHLs (39%; n=108), multiple myeloma (36%; n=69), and for CLL (44%; n=16). In-pts were significantly more affected by malnutrition than out-pts (35% versus 15%). Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) conducted on the whole population revealed mainly 3 anti-tumoral treatments significantly associated with malnutrition: previous radiotherapy, allogeneic graft and chemotherapy. Indeed, whatever the tumor localization, age and tumoral staging, radiotherapy increased by 1.53 (OR) the probability of being malnourished (CI:1.21-1.93; p=0.0004) whereas previous allogeneic HSCT or chemotherapy multiplied the same malnutrition risk by, respectively, 3.97 (1.12-14.09; p=0.033) and 1.40 (1.05-1.89; p=0.023). Furthermore, age and tumoral staging were also significant factors associated with malnutrition (OR between 1.01 and 2.97; p<0.05). Considering the global population of cancer pts, near 1 over 2 pts (47.3%) did not receive any nutritional support. For the hematology population, only 44.5% of the malnourished pts received nutritional support. The high prevalence of malnutrition in onco-hematology (34%) impair the dose-intensity of chemoradiotherapy, prolong intervals between chemotherapy courses, alter the quality of life of pts and may favor infectious complications, a factor that could be even more determining when considering HSCT pts. This underlines the absolute requirement for optimal nutrition care in these pts.",

Herein we present an analysis of the procedure feasibility and safety together with the longitudinal biological study regarding (a) the possible therapeutic mobilization process of both peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and early-late endothelial CD34+ cells ( EPC), and (b) the modification of humoral factors potentially related to HPC mobilization and mechanism of tissue repair. Patients and Methods: Between March 2004 and October 2006, a total of 37 patients who had suffered from acute transmural myocardial infarction less than 6 months before admission, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less 35, were recruited. The patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BMMC or placebo implantation plus conventional CABG, serial samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum and plasma were collected before and after surgery. Results: No procedure related side effects, especially no significant arrhythmogenic effects of BMMC transplantation have been observed so far. Two patients died due to nontransplantation related cause after some months from the procedure cardiac related. A first group of 16 patients, with 6 and 12 months follow-up, showed a significant improvement both in LVEF and in LV volumes (P<0.01). Flow cytometric analysis of PBMC of all patients showed that, after intervention, absolute number/ml of HPC co-expressing CD34+/CD133+ was statistically higher at + 24 h. as compared with the baseline value (P<0.005). Similarly, an early and transient increase of mature EPC co-expressing CD34+/CD31+, peaked already at + 24 h. (P<0.0001). A significant higher number of EPC co-expressing CD34+/CD117+ and CD34+/ VEGFR-2+ peaked at + 24 h and +7 days (P<0.003, P<0.001, respectively). Both circulating HPC and EPC returned to baseline levels within 30 days, after surgical intervention. Serum VEGF-2 level was over-secreted at +7 days (23,25 vs 570,3 + SD 473 pg/mL, P<0.0001), returning to baseline values at + 30 days. The plasma SDF-1 alpha level was significantly appreciable within 24 hours post-surgery (400,32 vs 889 + SD 250 pg/mL, P<0.003), being higher at +30 days (400,32 vs 1420 + SD pg/mL, 744, P<0.0001). Interestingly, in a first group of patients with 6 and 12months-follow-up, the systemic homing factor production showed a significant value than those found at baseline (p<0.001, p<0.02, respectively).We found a strong correlation between secretion fashion of SDF-1 alpha and CD62E/CD11b expression on PBMC (p<0.0001). Of interest, a small group of patients showed no difference of circulating CD34+ cell subsets and cytokines secretion before and after intervention Conclusion: From our experience certain interim conclusions can be drawn. One, adjunctive bone marrow-derived cell implantation at the time of bypass surgery appears to be feasible and safe. The second conclusion is that both cell and placebo infusion in infarcted patients could regulate endothelial progenitor cell mobilization and angiogenic/homing factors which might act to recruit circulating stem cells to the ischemic heart. Of interest, only few cases showed no substantial modification of biological parameters. However, we are not able to provide any definitive conclusion on the association between biological results and clinical outcome since this study is still blinded.",

Shevchenko (1) Treatment outcomes in MS patients after HDCT+ASCT are under-reported. We aimed to study clinical treatment response and quality of life (QoL) treatment response in MS patients after early, conventional and salvage HDCT +ASCT. Forty patients with MS (secondary progressive -19 patients, primary progressive -10, progressive-relapsing -1, relapsingremitting -10) from 6 medical centers were included in this study -(mean age -32.0, range: 17-51; male/female -16/24). Seven patients underwent early HDCT +ASCT, 30 patientsconventional HDCT+ASCT and 3 patients -salvage HDCT S217 pharmacologic and toxicologic responses. Previous studies on genetic polymorphisms of CYP 2C19 showed that individuals could be classified into the following groups: poor metabolizer (PMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and extensive metabolizers (EMs). Patients receiving an allogeneic transplant are faced to use a huge number of different kind of drugs, i.e. for immunesuppression, chemotherapeutical agents, or anti-infectious medication. Never before the influence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP 2C19 on patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation, was evaluated. Methods: Here we genotyped in a retrospective study 290 patients for CYP 2C19 expression who underwent allogeneic transplantation for various diseases and analyzed their outcome. Genotyping of CYP 2C19 was performed by realtime PCR. Results: 201 patients (72,5%) were genotyped as EMs, 71 patients (24,5%) as IMs and nine patients (3,1%) as PMs. From the donors 208 donors (71,7%) were EMs and had a homozygous wild-type gene, 68 donors (23,4%) were genotyped as IMs and had a heterozygous genotype, and 14 donors (4,8%) were typed as PMs with a homozygous gene mutation. Calculated genotype frequencies did not differ from that reported earlier by other studies for caucasiens. Five-year estimate for TRM was highest in PM-patients with 50% +18,6 % compared to EM patients (25,1 % + 3,7 % [p<0.018]) and IM patients 22,7 % + 5,6 % [p<0.042]), whereas the five-year estimate for relapse or overall survival were not statistically different between the groups. No differences for five-year estimates for TRM, relapse rate, or OS were seen in patients with either EM-, IM-or PM donors. No statistic differences were found in the incidence of acute GVHD grade 2-4 within the study groups. Conclusions: These results suggests that patients with loss-offunction polymorphism of CYP450 2C19 do have an increased TRM after transplantation. Genotyping for CYP450 2C19 might help to identify patients with higher risk for TRM. Impaired immune reconstitution after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) remains a major obstacle to its clinical application. Enhancing thymus-dependent immune reconstitution is the most efficient way to improve post transplant immune recovery. Key players in human T cell development are bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and cytokines such as interleukin-7 (IL-7) which modulate the immature thymocytes differentiation. Human MSCs can be engineered to produce IL-7. They home to bone marrow, spleen and thymus (Di Ianni et al., Hum Gene Ther 16:752; 2005) . In the present study we co-transplanted 5x105 human IL-7 engineered MSCs (hMSC-IL-7) producing 1000pg/ml together with 1x106 human CD34+ stem cells into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. We investigated the effects on immune reconstitution in bone marrow, spleen and thymus by staining with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and by measuring T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) levels by real time PCR. Immunohistological analysis detected human CD3+ cells in the thymus and spleen of NOD/SCID mice cotransplanted with human CD34+ cells and hMSC-IL7 cells. TREC levels were significantly increased in thymus, bone marrow and spleen (17894\u00b11634 copies/\u00ecg DNA; 161\u00b118 copies/\u00ecg DNA; 2106\u00b190 copies/\u00ecg DNA respectively). In mice transplanted with CD34 cells alone, no human CD3 cells were detected in any organ. No trecs were found. In conclusion hMSC-IL-7 cells could restore thymopoiesis of allo-BMT recipient by reconstructing thymic microenvironment and delivering an effective concentration of IL-7 directly into the thymus. Thus, the use of hMSC-IL-7 cells may be therapeutically useful for enhancing immune reconstitution after allo-BMT. Background: Human MSC are multipotent cells that are promising candidates for clinical cell therapy approaches such as GvHD treatment and cell replacement strategies. However, the culture of MSC requires fetal calf serum which is considered a high-risk ancilliary product and, therefore, should be avoided. Therefore, we aimed to develop a serum-free culture system that allows to effectively propoagate MSC invitro. Materials and methods: MSC were generated from human bone marrow using standard methods. Kryopreserved MSC were thawed and allowed to attach in complete MSC medium for three days (1000 MSC/well). Thereafter, cells were washed and cultured in either standard MSC medium or serum-free CellGro culture medium \u00b1 cytokines. Functional tests including differentiation assays, LTC-IC assays as well as gene-expression profiling were performed. Results: Without cytokine stimulation, MSC numbers decreased over time under serum-free conditions (2% \u00b1 0.05% of serum controls after 4 weeks culture). Among the cytokines and cytokine doses tested, was the combination of PDGF-BB (100 ng/mL) plus bFGF (1.0 ng/mL) both necessary and sufficient to amplify MSC to levels comparable to standard serum-containing cultures (33 \u00b1 11.3-fold and 32 \u00b1 9.6-fold, respectively, after 4 weeks culture). The addition of SCF and IL-3 markedly inhibited MSC growth, an effect that was even more pronounced when additional cytokines such as IL-6, Flt3-ligand, thrombopoietin, and IL-1 were added. PDGF + FGF-stimulated serum-free cultured MSC showed a typical spindle-shaped morphology and expressed MSC surface markers (CD73/CD90/MHC-Ipos, CD14/CD34/CD45neg). Moreover, these MSC effectively supported hematopoiesis when used as feeder cells in standard long-term culture initiating cell assays and they were capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. Gene-expression profile comparison of serumfree MSC vs. MSC grown in standard serum-containing culture revealed a total of 486 differentially expressed genes. Conclusion: Taken together, our data demonstrate that human MSC can be propagated under defined serum-free GMP conditions at efficiencies matching standard serum-containing culture by supplementing PDGF-BB and bFGF.",

Soluble factors produced by BM-MSCs were suggested to play a role in the inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) response. Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is nonclassic MHC class I molecule characterized by a limited polymorphism and a splicing mechanism that regulates membrane and soluble isoforms (sHLA-G). Since IL-10 upmodulates sHLA-G production and increased IL-10 levels were reported in MLR/MSCs culture supernatants, we investigated sHLA-G production by MSCs obtained from different sources (BM, dental pulp, amniotic membrane, chorion, skin). The results showed the presence of detectable sHLA-G molecules in the supernatants of either MLR/MSCs or MSC/phytoemoagglutinin (PHA) stimulated cultures but not in S218 controls. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of HLA-G m-RNA in MLR/MSCs cultures. The extent of sHLA-G production, as well as MSC lymphoproliferative response was dependent on MSC aging (MSCs culture passages: T1-T10) and MSC source. The sHLA-G production is also positively correlated with the in vitro MSCs immunosuppressive capacities. In situ immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that both (activated) MSCs and CD14+ monocytes could produce sHLA-G. Overall these data suggest a functional role for HLA-G antigens in mediating inhibition of the allogeneic response.",

Potter Royal Marsden Hospital (Sutton, UK) Between 1973 and 2003, 747 patients (M: 430, F:317; age: 29yr, range:1-65) who survived at least 1 yr. post SCT and were 15 to 65 years of age (range:15-71) at the last follow-up (LFU) were analysed to assess the outcome of pregnancies. At the time of SCT, 138 patients were pre-pubertal (M: 79, F: 59, p=0.8). Transplants were allogeneic (n=429, median age: 28yr), autologous (n=304, median age: 32) or syngeneic (n=14, median age: 37) performed for Ac. Leukaemia (n=583), Chr. Leukaemia (n=82) or other diseases (n=82).Conditioning included TBI in 561 patients (single fraction:478, fractionated: 83) and 168 patients also received cranial radiation. Stem cell source was marrow (n=573), PBSC (n=166) or both (n=8). GVHD prophylaxis was CyA alone (n=188), CyA with another agent (n=227) or other measures (n=14). The overall survival was 65% at 10yr (median FU: 7yr). 27 patients (10 females and 17 partners of male patients) had 42 pregnancies and sired 45 children (4 twin pregnancies). The probability of conception was 4% at 10yr. Pregnancies occurred in 17/429 allografts (3.96%; 6/186 females; 11/243 males), 8/304 autograft patients (2.63%; 4/123 females, 4/181 males) and 2/14 syngeneic transplants (14.3%; 0/8 females, 2/6 males). Amongst 10 female patients 3 had assisted conception. Amongst 17 partners of male patients, 6 had assisted, 10 had natural and 1 had assisted and natural conception. In univariate analysis chances of pregnancy were higher with age at SCT> 15yr.(5% vs. 1% at 10 yr., p<0.001), non-TBI conditioning (9% vs. 2%, p=0.001), age 20-45 yr.at LFU (5% vs. 2%, p=0.005) and use of PBSC (8% vs. 5%, p<0.001). Use of PBSC and non-TBI conditioning had significant correlation explaining the association. Multi-variate analysis identified non-TBI conditioning (RR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.7-8.3, p=0.001), age at transplant>15 yr. (RR: 11.6, 95% CI: 1.6-86.3, p=0.02) and age of 20-45 at LFU (RR: 5.53, 95% CI: 1.9-16.1, p=0.002) as independent predictors.Two pregnancies resulted in miscarriages leading to 3 foetal deaths (2/42, 5%; 3/45, 7%). Four babies were born prematurely and required admission to neonatal unit and 2 died after 6 weeks. None had congenital malformations. Currently, 40 children are alive and well; 26 after natural conception and 14 after assisted fertilization. In conclusion, even though the chances of conception are lower in patients undergoing transplant pregnancy outcomes following natural and assisted conception are likely to be similar. T regulatory (T reg) cells constitute 1-2% of peripheral blood cells in adults and function prevalently as immunosuppressors. 70% of T reg are memory/effector cells with a CD45RO+ phenotype; the others have a naive T cell phenotype (CD45RA+). In the present study, we investigated the effects of human recombinant IL-7 (rIL-7), human mesenchymal cells (hMSC) and hMSC engineered with the IL-7 gene (hMSC/IL-7) on regulatory T cells expressing a memory (CD4/CD25/CD45RO) or naive (CD4/CD25/CD45RA) phenotype. T cells from healthy donors were enriched by immnuselection to provide populations of CD45RA+ cells (95 % \u00b1 2.9) and CD45RO+ cells (97 % \u00b1 0.25). Enriched naive and memory cells were cultured in presence rIL-7 (100 ng/ml), hMSC (ratio 5:1) or hMSC/IL-7 (ratio 5:1). After 7 days' culture in the naive T cell population the T reg starting fraction of 0.05 % \u00b1 0.01 of CD4/CD25 positive cells, did not change in the presence of rIL-7 while it rose to 0.2 % \u00b1 0.14 in presence of human MSC and reached 1.67 % \u00b1 0.6 in presence of IL-7 engineered human MSC. In the memory T cell population the T reg starting fraction of 0.3 % \u00b1 0.05 of CD4/CD25 positive cells, did not change in presence of rIL-7 while it rose 1.5 % \u00b1 0.9 in the presence of human MSC and more interestingly reached 11.55 % \u00b1 7.5 in the presence of human IL-7 engineered-MSC. In the naive T reg starting fraction 3 % \u00b1 1.2 expressed CD127 which was down-regulated to 0.96 % \u00b1 0.5 in the presence of rIL-7, to 0.29 % \u00b1 0.2 with human MSC and to 0.37 % \u00b1 0.02 with human IL-7engineered-MSC. Memory T reg cells expressed CD127 in 15% \u00b1 1.2 of the starting fraction which was down-regulated to 1.2 % \u00b1 0.45 in the presence of rIL-7, to 1.32 % \u00b1 0.34 with hMSC and to 4.01% \u00b1 0.74 in presence of hMSC/IL-7. FoxP3 expression was measured by real time quantitative PCR in sort-purified subsets of peripheral blood, identified by staining with a combination of CD4, CD25, CD45RA or CD45RO. In na\u00efve T reg FoxP3 expression was increased 1.15 fold in the presence of hMSC and 2.7 fold in presence of hMSC/IL-7. In memory T reg FoxP3 expression was increased 1.14 fold in the presence of hMSC and 2.67 fold in presence of hMSC/IL-7. Given the different responses to IL-7/engineered and non engineered stromal cells, it appears that different regulatory systems may underlie different functions within the T reg sub-populations.",

Moreover, several studies have been initiated regarding the use of hMSCs in the prophylaxis of GvHD. Since thymoglobulin has being routinely used for the GvHDprophylaxis in unrelated-and within the studies in related donor transplants we examined for the first time the in vitro effect of thymoglobulin (0-200ug/ml) on immunomodulatory and differentiation function of hMSCs (0.1-10% endconcentration). In addition, we examined if the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, RANTES and MCP-1 by hMSCs has been influenced by Thymoglobulin. Methods and Results: Thymoglobulin binds to hMSCs and down regulates the HLA-I class expression. The expression of CD54, CD105, CD73 and CD90 on hMSCs has not been influenced by thymoglobulin. hMSCs significantly reduced the proliferation of lymphocytes tested in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) in a dose dependent manner. However, thymoglobulin caused increased proliferation of lymphocytes compared to MLC with untreated hMSC (0.01) (Fig. 1 ).",

Conclusion: Our data have shown for the first time that Thymoglobulin suppress the immunomodulatory effect of hMSCs in vitro without influencing their differentiation capacity. This finding offers new insight into the interactions between hMSCs and Thymoglobulin, suggesting that in vivo effect of hMSCs in GvHD could be altered.",

Le Blanc Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, S) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can differentiate to several mesenchymal tissues and have been suggested to be used for tissue repair. We explored the possibility to use MSC to heal chemoirradiation-induced tissue toxicity. Ten consecutive patients who were treated with MSC due to tissue toxicity following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were included. Median age was 48 (13-64) years. Seven had severe hemorrhagic cystitis grades 2-5, two had pneumomediastinum and one had perforated colon diverticulitis and peritonitis. MSC were from HLAmismatched (n=11), from HLA-haploidentical donors (n=3) or HLA-identical siblings (n=2). MSC were given i.v. and median cell dose was 1.0 (range 0.7-2) x 10 6 /kg. Two patients with severe hemorrhagic cystitis had decreased transfusion requirements after MSC infusion, but died of multiorgan failure. In one of them, MSC donor DNA was demonstrated in the urinary bladder. In five patients, severe hemorrhagic cystitis cleared after MSC infusion. In two patients, pneumomediastinum disappeared after MSC infusions. A patient with steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease of the gut experienced perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis that was reversed twice by MSC. To conclude, MSC is a novel therapy for therapy-induced tissue toxicity that deserves further evaluation. and pheno",

Monocytes were obtained from buffy-coats of blood donations (n=10) by adherence. They were cultured in the presence of VEGF (10ng/ml), FGF (2ng/ml) and IGF (1ng/ml). Immunophenotypic analysis were performed before and 26 days after initiating the culture using the following monoclonal Antibodies (McAb): CD13, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD31, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD64, CD105, CD133, KDR, Lysozyme,Vecadherine and vWF. \"In vivo\" studies were performed in a mouse model of ischaemia. Acute hind limb ischaemia was induced after ligation and excision of the left femoral artery in 6 swiss-nu/nu 6-8 weeks old mice. Revascularization was measured by two approaches: blood flow using a laser Doppler device (moor LAB server) and by assessing capillary density (number vessels/um\u00b2). Two groups of mousse were used for the study: one receiving 105 monocytes (n=6) and other in which only a saline solution was injected (control group) (n=6). Blood flow was measured the day before artery ligation (basal) and on days +1, +7, +14 and +28. On that day, mice were sacrified and capillaries counted in both vastus muscles (ischaemic and non ischaemic) by using immunochemistry with anti-CD31McAb.The Visilog program was used in order to obtain the number of capillaries/sample. Monocytes purity after adherence was 87% (75-92). These cells expressed the following markers: CD13, CD31, CD33, CD45, CD64, lysozyme CD15, CD105, CD16, Ve-cadherine but were negative for CD34, CD133 and vWF. 1.3% of cells expressed the KDR antigen. After 28 days in culture all hematopoietic and myeloid specific markers showed a decreased expression when compared to that of the basal population. Regarding CD14 expression, two cell subpopulations could be observed: one positive (69%) and one negative (31%) and both of them expressed the KDR antigen. Blood flow increased after ischaemia in both groups of animals at day +7, +14 and +28 but always recovery was faster in mice receiving monocytes. This difference was statistically at day +14. The number of capillaries was significantly higher in mice receiving monocytes. In no case we observed a monocytes incorporated into a mouse vessels.",

It is unknown if new non-chemotherapeutic agents following ASCT might ensure further cytoreduction allowing patients to enter MR. In this study we assessed this hypothesis by consolidating with Bortezomib, Thalidomide and Dexamethsone (VTD) patients achieving CR or VGPR following an ASCT-containing regimen. Patients and methods: Patients were eligible if they had: 1) a molecular marker based on the IgH rearrangment; 2) a documented CR or VGPR following ASCT. The VDT had to be started within 6 months from ASCT. Each cycle included: a) Bortezomib 1.6 mg/m\u00b2 as an IV injection once weekly (on days 1, 8, 15, 22) followed by a 13-day rest period (days 23-35); b) Thalidomide at the initial dose of 50 mg/day PO once daily, with increments of 50 mg every 7 days to acceptable tolerance (maximum 200 mg); c) Dexamethasone 20 mg/day PO once daily, on days 1 to 4, 8 to 11 and 15 to 18 followed by a 17-day rest period (days 19-35) A total of 4 cycles were delivered. Bone marrow samples for molecular analysis were taken at study entry, after two and four courses, and then at three months intervals. Minimal residual disease (MRD) has been evaluated using clone-specific primers by nested PCR and real time PCR as published elsewhere (Voena et al, Leukemia 1997 and Ladetto et al Biol Bone Marrow Transpl 2000) . Results: 21 Patients have entered the study so far. One was already PCR negative after ASCT, one is not evaluable due to early toxicity. 10 patients have been evaluated only after two courses and eleven also at the end of the program. For seven patients also follow-up samples at three and six months are available. Nested PCR was always PCR positive with the exception of three patients. One had a PCR-negative sample after 50% of consolidation therapy but reverted to PCR positivity at the end of treatment and during follow-up. One patient is PCR-negative after two courses but we do not have subsequent follow-up samples. Only one patient achieved PCR negativity following two VTD courses and mantained MR during follow-up. Real time PCR is available in six patients. In four a reduction of tumor burden was observed following VTD treatment (median reduction 0.77 log). Discussion: Consolidation with VTD is active on MRD as documented by real time PCR. However in most patients, VTD seems unable to reduce the tumor load below the sensitivity threshold of PCR.",

Soci\u00e9 H\u00f4pital Saint Louis (Paris, F) After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), early infections represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality but little information has been previously reported on late infections. Late infections incidence and risk 2 .Only under these conditions were the frequencies (by limiting dilution analyses) of alloantigen-specific T cells maximally reduced, i.e., 3,583 \u00b1 1,909 (mean \u00b1 SD) times, when compared with non TH9402-treated cells. Pathogen-specific responses to pathogen antigens such as CMV, Adenovirus, V-Z, Aspergillus, Candida, Toxoplasma were retained, although with a 63 \u00b1 22 times reduction in frequency. This remarkable drop in frequency of alloreactive T cells is expected to allow safe infusion of relatively large numbers of T cells across histocompatibility barriers for adoptive transfer of donor immunity. Consequently, a clinical trial is being designed to incorporate infusion of photo-allodepleted donor T cells after haploidentical stem cell transplantation with the aim of decreasing infection-related mortality. (1) Study design and methods: Six MNC collections obtained by using a continuuos flow cell separator (COBE Spectra) were processed with the Elutra system. The monocyte-enriched fraction was differentiated into DCs by sequential addition of GM-CSF, IL-4, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, IL1-beta, TNF-alpha and poly (I:C). DC were pulsed with a pool of 47 MHC class I and II binding CMV peptides derived from different CMV proteins (pp65, pp50, pp150 and IE1) for simultaneous expansion of CD8 and CD4 T-cell lines. Lymphocytes were then stimulated with mature autologous CMV peptide pulsed-DC for 3 rounds of weekly stimulation. Results: MNC collections contained a median of 10.03 x 109 total nucleated cell count, with a median 78.5 % lymphocytes and 15 % monocytes content. Elutriation procedure took a mean of 59 \u00b1 4 minutes. After elutriation mean monocyte yield was 0.89 \u00b1 0.65 x 109, with a 51.0 \u00b1 31.6 % recovery and a 51.1 \u00b1 35.4 % purity. We observed a significant correlation when basal monocyte content was related to the postelutriation recovery (P< 0.0116). In fact, when the basal product contained more than 1.5 x 109 monocytes we observed both an higher purity (81v s 45 %) and recovery (74 vs 37 %) when compared with products with lower monocyte contents. At the end of the differentiation process >60% of plated monocytes were differentiated into DCs and a robust enrichment in CMV antigen-specific T cells was observed in all samples (average percentage of pentamer+ CD8+ cells=35% compared to the initial value = 2%) Conclusion: Our findings might be helpful in appropriately tailoring MNC collection from healthy donors, in order to maximize the efficiency of the elutriation system and to subsequentely obtain an optimal monocyte-enriched yield for further DC generation together with lymphocyte-enriched ancillary units to be stimulated by CMV-pulsed DC. Moreover, the elutration procedure proved to be more cost effective than immunomagnetic methods.",

Human NKT cells, which is very small population in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), effectively proliferated by using a specific ligand aplhagalactosylseramide (alpha-GalCer), while in cancer patients, this proliferation is suppressed. Object: We analyzed characteristics of PBMC taken from cancer patients to identify the factors that contributed to ex vivo expansion of Vaplha2+ NKT cells and compared to those from healthy volunteers. Methods: PBMC were collected from healthy volunteers (n=10) and colon cancer patients (n=17). PBMC were cultured in AIM-V medium supplemented with 5% auto-plasma, 100 ng/mL aplha-GalCer and 100 U/mL recombinant human IL-2, which was supplied every 3 days. On day 12, expansion efficacy of Vaplha2+ NKT cells was calculated. To evaluate the contribution of CD14+ cells, we sorted CD14+ cells from healthy donors and co-cultured them with a CD14-negative fraction including NKT cell precursor from cancer patients. Results: Although the proportions of Vaplha24+ NKT cells in peripheral blood before culture were comparable between healthy donors and cancer patients (0.02\u00b10.036 vs 0.02\u00b10.026 %, P=0.49), the number of cultured Vaplha24+ NKT cells derived from cancer patients was less than that in healthy donors with marginal significance (472\u00b1886 vs 7.85\u00b111.2, x 10\u00b2/mL, P=0.06). There were no significant recovery of NKT cell expansion observed, in culture with healthy donors' plasma (1.01\u00b11.11 patient auto-plasma vs 1.26\u00b11.82 healthy donors plasma, x 10\u00b2/mL, P=0.78), nor in culture with healthy donors' CD14+ cell (1.05\u00b10.70 patient CD14+ cells vs 26.4\u00b129.3 healthy donor CD14+ cells, x 10\u00b2/mL, P=0.09). Specific surface markers (CD94, CD69, CD161, NKG2A and NKG2D) on NKT cells between healthy donors and cancer patients before culture were not significantly different. Conclusions: Previous our data demonstrated that the expression of CD1d molecules on CD14+ cells was lower in cancer patients than that in healthy donors. However, CD14+ cell obtained from healthy donor could not overcome the reduced expansion of NKT cells in cancer patients. Those results might suggest that Vaplha24+ NKT cell in cancer patient lose a potentiality to expand, in other mechanisms related to common NK cell activation mechanisms. D. Choumerianou, E. Linardakis, H. Dimitriou, E. Stiakaki, C. Perdikogianni, G. Martimianaki, M. Kalmanti University of Crete (Heraklion Crete, GR) Recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can become targets of neoplastic transformation leading to cells with malignant potential. We studied the expression profile of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSG), known to play an important role in the malignant transformation of cells. We assessed their expression levels in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNCs) and compared them to the respective ones in MSCs as well as their levels in different MSC passages (P). MNCs and MSCs were isolated from BM of children diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, n=8), autoimmune neutropenia (n=5), solid tumors without BM involvement (n=6) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia lines the 196R allele transduces TNF signalling more effectively than 196M. The 196R allele has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and with the severity of rheumatoid arthritis and acute GvHD (aGvHD). We investigated the impact of donor and recipient TNFR II 196 genotypes on survival in Danish SCT patients. Patients and methods: TNFR II 196 genotypes were determined in amplified genomic DNA by using restriction enzymes and agarose gel electrophoresis. Transplants with either matched sibling donors (n=159) or matched unrelated donors (MUD) (n=102) were included by the availability of DNA. The indications for SCT were ALL (n=58), CML (n=59), AML (n=63), MDS (n=15), other types of haematologic malignancy (n=28) and non-malignant disorders (n=38). The logrank test was applied. Results: In sibling transplants the 196 RR genotype of the donor was associated with decreased overall survival (p=0,041). A selective analysis of treatment related mortality showed the same pattern (p= 0,015). There was no significant association between TNFR II 196 genotypes and the frequency or grade of aGvHD, and TNFR II 196 genotypes were unrelated to the risk of relapse of leukaemia. Carriage of the R allele by the recipient was not associated with survival or with aGvHD. In MUD transplants we did not observe any association between TNFR II 196 genotypes and outcome. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the TNFR II 196R allele of the donor is associated with treatment related mortality in sibling donor SCT, and points to TNF as a mediator in the pathogenesis of treatment related complications. Selection of donors based on TNFR II 196 typing, in addition to HLAtyping, may help to reduce treatment related mortality in SCT.",

Laurenti, G. Leone, P. Chiusolo, S. Sica Catholic University S. Cuore (Rome, I) HSCT may be associated with a variety of complications such as GVHD and major non infectious transplant-related complications (TRC). Although HLA compatibility has the central role in selecting donors and determining transplant outcome, the sequencing of the human genome has revealed numerous non HLA encoded single nucleotide polymorphisms whose significance in allogenic HSCT could be relevant. Due to these polymorphisms patients may be predisposed to releasing high levels of certain cytokines pre and post trasplant during the \"cytokine storm\" and therefore be more predisposed and/or protected from GVHD and mortality. In our study we examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms at position 677 and 1298 in the MTHFR gene, at -308 in the TNF alfa gene and -252 in the TNF beta gene, at -1082 and -592 in the IL10 gene, at -238 in the IL10 receptor gene and at 908, 702, 1007 in the NOD2/CARD15 gene, on incidence of GVHD (grade II-IV) and mortality in a group of 35 patients submitted to allogenic HSCT from 2004 in our institute and in their donors respectively. Variant genotypes were determined using PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphisms, except for variant 1007 and 702 determined using allelic specific PCR. Table 1 presents patients' characteristics. Kaplan Meyer incidence curves , with differences compared by the Log-Rank test, was used to assess the association between polymorphisms and clinical covariates (age, disease status, regimen conditioning, gender compatibility, HLA mismatches) and GVHD development and mortality. The level of significance was performed to p<0.05. Our results showed that global incidence of GVHD( grade III-IV) was 25.7%. In univariate analysis we found an association statistically significant between development of GVHD and TNF beta homozygous variant recipient (p: 0.02) and TNF alfa homozygous variant donor (p:0.001). We did not observe significant differences between genotypic variants and clinical characteristics versus acute GVHD. Regarding mortality we found a higher incidence in patients with TNF beta and alfa homozygous variant(p=0.0004, p=0.02) and IL10 -1082 heterozygous variant (p=0.005); in addition we observed that the patients with advanced status disease had a lower survival( p=0.002) . These data suggest that the determination of functional genotypes in the cytokine pathways may have clinical utility for risk assessment, counseling and treatment planning before trasplantation.",

Gregorio Mara\u00f1on (Madrid, E) Background: Polymorphisms in regulatory sequences of cytokine genes are known to influence their expression and, therefore, the intensity of the immune response. Some of such polymorphisms have been associated with the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Objective: To evaluate the association between donor (D) and recipient (R) genotype for the IL-10 gene -1082 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and -1064 STR (short tandem repeat) polymorphism with the dynamics of chimerism and the development of complications after SCT. Patients and methods: 24 HLA-matched conventional SCT. IL-10 genotypes were determined in an -1082 SNP allele-specific PCR (A vs G) including the -1064 STR in the product which is revealed by capillary electrophoresis. Results were analyzed using Fisher's exact test due to the reduced sample size. Results: The frequency of alloreactive genotypes (AA or A) for the SNP was 37,5% AA and 79,2% A in the D and 33,3 AA and 95,8% A in the R . No association was observed between the homozygous or heterozygous presence in the D or R of the alloreactive allele for the SNP genotype and the dynamics of chimerism or complications post-SCT. Alleles 4 to 10 for the STR genotype were found in contrast to previous reports (alleles 7-16). The frequency of alloreactive alleles (homozygous, +/+, or heterozygous, +), with greater number of dinucleotide repeats (alleles 8-10 in the present series) for the STR was 8,3% +/+ and 62,5% + in the D and 8,3% +/+ and 50% + in the R. The presence of alloreactive alleles (heterozygous) in the donor was significantly associated with the development of extense chronic GVHD (EcGVHD, Table  1 ). In patients transplanted from such donors, the incidence of mixed chimerism (MC) in peripheral blood during the first month post-SCT was lower although without statistical significance ( Table 1 ). The higher alloreactivity of these donors favors the establishment of complete chimerism and therefore, increases the incidence of EcGVHD.Conclusions: The present study shows an association between the presence in the donor of alloreactive alleles for the IL-10 -1064 STR polymorphism and the development of EcGVHD, in a chimerism mediated fashion, after HLA-S225 identical SCT. The analysis of a larger number of patients as well as further cytokines will eventually allow to confirm these observations and to establish this type of studies as a means for an improved management of transplanted patients.",

Cuore (Rome, I) The inflammatory response following the activation of imflammatory cells by bacterial compounds is a further important player in the induction of severe complications following HSCT. The NOD2/CARD15 protein has been described as an intracellular sensor to muramyl dipeptide mediating consecutive nuclear factor-kB activation and belongs to a large family of protein involved in intracellular pathogen recognition. Its expression is restricted to intestinal epithelial cells and cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Three common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the leucine -rich repeats domain R702W, G908R and L1007finsC, might be associated with an abnormal inflammatory response against normal bacterial flora by diminishing NFkB response. These variants are associated with a higher incidence of acute GVHD and transplant related mortality after allogeneic SCT due to transplant related toxicity and sepsis. Our purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of these variant polymorphisms in both subsets of patients submitted to auto (56 pts) and alloSCT (35 pts) and their influence on mortality in the autoSCT group and GVHD and mortality in the alloSCT respectively. Patient's characteristics are described in Table 1 . Variant genotype 908 was determined using PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphisms , while variant 1007 and 702 was determined using allelic specific PCR. Kaplan Meyer incidence curves , with differences compared by the Log-Rank test, was used to assess the association between polymorphisms and clinical covariates (age, disease status, regimen conditioning, gender compatibility, HLA mismatches) and GVHD development and mortality. The level of significance was performed to p<0.05. In the subgroup of pts submitted to autoSCT we did not find any correlation between NOD2/CARD15 polymorphisms and overall survival, transplant related toxicity and incidence of sepsis. (p=ns). In the subgroup of patients submitted to alloSCT no association was found between the same polymorphisms and the incidence of GVHD and mortality. This is the first study regarding the influence of NOD2/CARD15 in a autoSCT set of patients and we did not demonstrate any correlation with transplant related complications. In the allogeneic subgroup we were not able to demonstrate any correlation with mortality and incidence of GVHD probably due to the low number of patients and the dishomogeneity of conditioning regimens.",

Herriot (Lyon, F) Introduction: After 2 years of work, our haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant programme was accredited by JACIE for autologous and allogeneic transplantation in adult patients, collection of bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor and therapeutic cells and cell processing. This accreditation is effective from June 2005 to June 2008. The purpose of this abstract is to describe the follow-up of this quality management plan. Results: In 2005, 51 allogeneic and 40 autologous HSC transplantations were performed in our department. Two quality management reviews were done the first year: doctors, nurses, nurse supervisors, and secretaries were present. The first decision was to modify the operation schedule with fewer.meetings. One area to improve is the collection of nonconformity where failure to transmit information was the most frequent. Only 8 cases were collected in 2005, which seems erroneous with respect to the number of transplants per year. To involve the nurses in the quality management, an annual nurse report review with criteria proposed by nurses was proposed. On the contrary, clinical report review, bone marrow collection review, and follow-up indicators are successful. However, annual review procedures are long and difficult to maintain. For allogeneic transplantation, 38 standard operating procedures (SOP) were written, six of which need to be modified for example \"Choice of cell source\" and \"Choice of conditioning regimen\". We have integrated cord blood transplantation, not performed here before accreditation, and reduced conditioning regimens. Two SOP for autologous transplantation and 9 SOP for both allo and auto transplants must be changed according to new comparative studies and new drugs. Sixteen register documents have to be modified or removed. The review procedure is tedious, requires working groups and above all demands heavy secretarial support. The main difficulty is the loss of our JACIE secretarial support immediately after our accreditation in June 2005. Conclusion: JACIE accreditation is an interesting challenge, however the follow up of the programme is difficult due to lack of time and resources. For other teams, we suggest paying careful attention to the feasibility of their programme. (1) , G. Kvalheim (1) (1) Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical (Oslo, N) ; (2) Dynal-Invitrogen (Oslo, N) Background: T regulatory cells (Treg) are a subset of T lymphocytes defined by CD4+CD25+ markers and high FOXP3 expression. They play a key role in self-reactivity and alloreactivity control. In allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), these cells could be potential useful in reducing graft versus host disease without impairing graft versus tumor effect. Objective: To optimize the in vitro T-cell expansion conditions for clinical grade production of Treg cells. Material and methods: CD4+ cells were obtained by positive and negative immunomagnetic selection from peripheral blood derived lymphocytes. CD4+ cells were stimulated with anti CD3/CD28-coated Dynabeads at a bead/cell ratio of 3:1. The cells were cultured with X-VIVO20 media, autologous plasma, IL2, IL4 and with and without Sirolimus. At day 12 cells were washed and depleted of CD3/CD28 Dynabeads. After 24 h reincubation with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads, cytokine secretion was analyzed in the supernatant by BioPlex. Cell phenotype and FOXP3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and suppressive capacitive was measured using standard proliferation assay. Results: 80% of CD4+ cells cultured with Sirolimus expressed CD25 and secreted low levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. In contrast, only 20% of CD4+ cells cultured without Sirolimus expressed CD25 and secreted high level of Th1 cytokines. Culture conditions either with or without Sirolimus resulted in the same number of FOXP3+ cells. However, cells cultured with Sirolimus showed strong suppressive capacity and could suppress CD4+CD25-T cell proliferation by 80% even at 1:32 ratio of CD4+CD25-:CD4+CD25+ cells. Conclusions: Sirolimus induces generation of Treg cells with a strong inhibitory power over CD4+ CD25-cells proliferation. Key words: T cells, T regulatory cells, sirolimus, hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. Syngeneic rejection of high grade lymphoma is hampered by several mechanisms including fast growth of the lymphoma, secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and low expression of MHC molecules. To better understand the immunological mechanisms behind lymphoma rejection we have developed a murine model that allows us to investigate anti lymphoma immunity directed against a single minor antigen. Using a C57BL/6 c-myc transgenic mouse lymphoma model, we established primary lymphoma cell lines that were transduced by an MSV based retroviral vector containing chicken ovalbumin (OVA) and IRES-GFP. Control cell lines were transduced with an IRES-GFP containing vector. When cells were subcutaneously injected (0.1 Mio) into syngeneic C57BL/6 GFP transgenic mice that are tolerant to GFP, we could show that introduction of OVA markedly slowed down tumour growth relative to control vector transduced cells. Mice receiving control vector transduced cells developed lethal lymphoma within 23 days whereas OVA transduced lymphoma progressed slowly after 28 days. This delay was accompanied by a loss of GFP expression within the developing lymphoma, indicating a selection for non-transduced cells within the injected cell-suspension. Thus GFP/OVA expressing cells were successfully deleted. In control vector transduced cells GFP expression was present in the developing tumours. When splenic T-cells were isolated from mice that rejected OVA expressing lymphoma we found up to 0.6% T-cells specific for SIINFEKL, a peptide deriving from OVA. When lymphoma cells were analysed for MHC class I and II expression before injection we found that MHC expression was very low compared to wild type B-cells of C57BL/6 mice. After injection of control vector transduced cells we observed an up to 8fold increase in MHC class I and up to 20fold induction of MHC class II expression on lymphoma cells. By contrast, upregulation of MHC class I and II was much more pronounced in OVA/GFP expressing lymphoma with up to 18 fold induction of MHC class I and up to 100fold induction of MHC class II. GFP negative lymphomas from different mice were explanted and recultured. MHC class I and II levels dropped to values observed before injection within 14 days. Induction of MHC class I and II expression could be partly restored by treatment with murine IFNg (100U/ml) up to 2fold for MHC class I and 12 fold for MHC class II respectively.The results indicate strong tumour editing by infiltrating host T-cells.",

Mattsson (1) Background: Evaluation of patient and donor sera using cytotoxic crossmatch analysis prior to allogeneic SCT is a routine procedure in many centers. However, the predictive value of cytotoxic crossmatch analysis prior to SCT is unclear. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the clinical impact of cytotoxic T-and B-cell crossmatches before SCT performed at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge between January 2000 and June 2005. Crossmatch analysis was performed in patients receiving grafts from unrelated donors. During this period 257 patients received stem cells from unrelated donors. Crossmatching was performed in 157 patients. Median age of the patients was 35 (0-67) years. Diagnoses were: acute leukemia (n=58), CML (n=27), other hematological malignancies (n=31), solid tumors (n=22) and non-malignant disease (n=19). Fifty-four patients received bone marrow and 103 patients were grafted with PBSC. Fully matched grafts (6/6) were given to 130 patients. Twenty-six patients received an allele mismatched graft and one patient received a graft with one major antigen mismatch. Thirty-three patients received TBI based conditioning regimen, 50 were given BuCy, 53 patients received non-myeloablative and 21 patients received other conditioning protocols. All patients received ATG before SCT. Most patients received a combination cyclosporine and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. Results: Ninety patients are still alive. Acute GVHD grade I was diagnosed in 41 (26%) patients and grades II-IV in 50 (32%). Rejection was diagnosed using chimerism analysis in 15 patients (10%). In 11 of these patients cytotoxic crossmatching was performed before SCT. One of 11 patients with rejection was positive in T-cell crossmatching in HVGdirection and 4/11 in B-cell crossmatching. No correlation was found between cytotoxic crossmatching and GVHD. Only two patients with GVHD grades II-IV had a positive T-cell crossmatch before SCT. Concerning rejection, T-cell crossmatching showed a sensitivity of 9% and a specificity of 97% in the present study. For acute GVHD T-cell crossmatching showed a sensitivity of 3% and a specificity of 98%. A positive crossmatch before SCT had no effect on survival in this study as compared to patients with a negative crossmatch. Conclusion: Cytotoxic T-and/or B-cell crossmatching before SCT is not predictive for either rejection or GVHD. We therefore currently evaluate novel crossmatch tests prior to SCT with better predictive value at our center. Retroviral vectors containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a reporter gene are widely used. Whether the expression of GFP from retroviral constructs enhances immunogenicity of transduced cells is presently under debate. By using a transgenic mouse lymphoma model, where the human proto-oncogene c-myc is driven by parts of the immunoglobulin lambda locus representing a t(8;22) translocation as found in Burkitt\u00b4s lymphoma, we developed a model to test whether GFP expressed in lymphoma cells can serve as a minor antigen. C57BL/6 lambda-hu-c-myc transgenic mice were crossbred with C57BL/6UBC-GFP transgenic mice, giving rise to a \"green\" lymphoma within 200 days post birth. These cells exhibit two potential minor antigens in WT C57BL/6 mice: GFP and the human c-myc gene. Peptide prediction of GFP in the context of MHC H2Kb and H2Db revealed several octamers and nonamers as possibly immunogenic. Primary cell lines from GFP transgenic lymphoma were established and cells were injected after irradiation into wild type C57BL6 mice. After booster injection after 4-6 mice a strong antibody response towards GFP was detectable in the serum as measured by ELISA. Similar results were observed when GFP protein was used for vaccination. In order to compare immunogenicity of GFP negative and GFP positive primary cell lines we retrovirally transduced GFP negative lymphoma cells with an MSV based IRES-GFP containing vector. After cell sorting, GFPtransduced lymphoma cells displayed up to 98% GFP expression. This phenotype was maintained in culture over several weeks. When retrovirally transduced GFP positive lymphoma cells were subcutaneously injected into wild type C57BL/6 mice (0.1 Mio. cells), lymphoma development was slowed down compared to C57BL/6 UBC-GFP transgenic hosts, which are tolerant towards GFP. C57BL/6UBC-GFP transgenic mice developed lethal systemic lymphoma within 20 days whereas wild type C57BL/6 mice displayed lymphoma progression only after 28 days. Explanted lymphomas from wild type C57BL/6 hosts displayed reduced GFP expression and were partially GFP negative, indicating a selection for low GFP expression within the injected lymphoma cell suspension. These data indicate that GFP can serve as a minor antigen since rejection of lymphoma in C57BL/6 UBC-GFP transgenic mice could not be observed. Reconstitution of hematopoiesis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) occurs via a reservoir of donor CD34+ HSC. CD34+/VEGFR-2+ is a primitive, quiescent subpopulation of HSC known to generate hematopoietic or endothelial progeny in vitro and in vivo. Here, we hypothesized that donor-specific antibodies to the CD34+/VEGFR-2+ stem cell population may be associated with rejections after HSCT. Ten patients without and eleven with rejections after HSCT were included. We provide novel evidence that significantly higher numbers of patients with rejections 8/11 (73 %), while 0/10 in the controls had antibodies against donor CD34+/VEGF-R2+ cells, but not CD34-/VEGFR-2-cells. Importantly, in seven transplantations, antibodies against donor CD34+/VEGF-R2+ cells were detected already prior to transplantation. These were of the IgG+IgM class and titres increased in the post-transplantation period and were present before any signs of clinical rejection. We demonstrate that purified IgG fractions from patients with rejections but not controls, lysed donor CD34+/VEGFR-2+ stem cells and significantly decreased the ability of these cells to form hematopoietic and endothelial colonies and tube-formation in matrigels. We will also present data on how antibody mediated rejection of HSC may be avoided. A 2-year-old girl with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was transplanted in April 2005. The patient rejected the graft verified with chimerism analysis. She was re-transplanted in September 2006. We will show data on how plasmapheresis, rituximab and development of acute GVHD grade III saved the transplant. The patient is today in good clinical condition and complete donor chimera. We conclude that donor-specific antibodies to CD34+/VEGFR-2+HSC may significantly contribute to the rejection process after HSCT.",

            "text": "GvHD prophylaxis with sirolimus in combination with mycophenolate mofetil in allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high-risk leukaemia patients M. Schleuning, D. Judith, A. Bertelsmann, Z. Jedlickova, M. Heshmat, H. Baurmann, R. Schwerdtfeger German Diagnostic Clinic Foundation (Wiesbaden, D) Sirolimus, an immunosuppressant structurally related to the calcineurininhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus, exerts its action in a later stage of T-cell activation by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thus blocking the interleukin 2 receptor signaling. In addition to its immunosuppressive effects sirolimus also has potent antineoplastic activity. Sirolimus has been used successfully in solid organ transplantation and in combination with CNI for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We hypothesized that replacing CNI with sirolimus would preserve effective prophylaxis of GVHD while enhancing the antileukemic potential of allogeneic SCT at a low toxicity profile. Within the FLAMSA-RIC protocol for high risk leukemia we enrolled 5 high risk patients (pts) in a pilot trial to test the efficacy of sirolimus in combination with MMF without CNI in allowing engraftment and preventing GVHD after allogeneic SCT from HLA-matched related (n=2) and unrelated donors (n=3). All but one pt also received ATG during conditioning. The underlying diagnoses were refractory T-ALL with complex karyotype (n=1), refractory AML with flt3-ITD (n=3), CML in refractory myeloid blast crisis (n=1). One pt died in aplasia on d +6 from aspergillosis and pulmonary bleeding. The remaining pts engrafted after a median of 19 days. Grade I GVHD occurred in 3 pts and was limited to the skin. One patient developed signs of chronic GVHD after cessation of immunosuppression which improved after resumption of sirolimus treatment. Despite the one death from aspergillosis peritransplantation toxicity was mild. One pt suffered from HHV6-associated erosive gastritis, which necessitated laser coagulation and her condition improved only after terminating sirolimus at day +48. None of the pts developed thrombotic microangiopathy or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. At a median follow-up of 118 days after transplantation all 4 pts are alive and in complete remission. Although the follow-up is rather short sirolimus in combination with MMF seems to be a promising alternative to CNI-based regimens for GVHD prophylaxis after allogeneic SCT. Engraftment was ensured, although it might be delayed to some extent. Transplant-related toxicity was modest, as was acute GVHD. So far no relapse occurred in this high-risk population. In conclusion, sirolimus-based GVHD prophylactic regimens deserve further investigation. Backgrounds: Improved neovascularization is an important therapeutic goal after myocardial infarction and limb ischemia. In the recent years, increasing evidence suggests that bonemarrow derived circulating cells home the sites of ischemia and contribute to the formation of new blood. The direct injection of bone marrow cells (BMCs) in the ischemic sites nevertheless contributes to neovascularization though the mechanism is unknown. Aims: This study focuses on the angiogenic roles of BMCs in C57BL/6 hind-limb ischemic mice. We examined whether the BMCs might induce the angiogenesis in a mouse model of hind limb ischemia and evaluated the expression of related molecules. Methods: BMCs were obtained from C57BL/6. Unilateral hind limb ischemia was surgically induced by femoral artery ligation in C57BL/6 mice (control group; n=4), autologous BM-MNCs (transplantation group; n=6, 1.58 \u00b1 0.3 x107 cells/animal) were transplanted into the ischemic limbs after 10 days. The capillary/muscle ratios were evaluated and VEGF, eNOS, SDF-1, CXCR-4 and MMP-9 assayed in tissue homogenates using western blotting. Results: The capillary/ muscle ratio was elevated continuously in BMCs transplantation group. 4 weeks later transplantation group had a higher capillary/ muscle ratio (1.07 \u00b1 0.03) than control (0.62 \u00b1 0.12, p<0.05). VEGF was not expressed after femoral artery dissection but it was expressed only 2 days after BMCs were injected in the ischemic sites. The expression of SDF-1 was detected in the ischemic sites on day 2 and day 3 after femoral artery dissection, and 7 days after BMCs injection. CXCR-4 was up-regulated transplantation group more than control and normalized in 14 days. Conclusions: The direct local transplantation of autologous BMCs augments the neovascularization in the ischemic tissues. And the expression of VEGF after the injection of BMCs induces the expression of SDF-1 and mobilizes the CXCR-4 cells in ischemic sites. Hematopoetic stem cells (HSC) are investigated for their regenerative potential through transdifferentiation (stem cell plasticity), cell fusion, or cytokine mediated effects. Animal studies have shown G-CSF to improve organ damage e.g. in myocardial infarction or after irradiation, possibly by localizing HSC to damaged tissues. Local injection of HSC is investigated in many different settings. We here describe a patient treated successfully with bone marrow derived HSC injected locally for radionecrosis after radiation therapy to the cervix. A 36 years old female, diagnosed with epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix (FIGO IIB N1) with bilateral extended iliac lymph node involvement was treated by pelvic radiotherapy (45Gy (pelvis) + 10Gy (parametria and cervix) + 12Gy (iliac lymph nodes) + 21Gy (cervical brachytherapy associated with radiosensitizing cisplatin) over 2 mths. One mth after treatment, she complained of abdominal and groin pain, malodorous vaginal discharge, left leg proximal weakness, painful defecation and asthenia. Clinical examination showed necrosis of the cervix confirmed by MRI. In spite of local treatment necrosis progressed. Based on limited animal data and after obtaining ethics approval the patient was treated on a 2-step experimental HSC protocol. First, G-CSF was used at 1 mth after diagnosis to \"mobilize\" HSC to the necrotic tissue (5 mg/kg sc bid for 5 days). CD34+ counts increased to 10 5 /ml on d5 (undetectable on d0 and d11). Second, because of continued progression of necrosis at 2 mths, 110 ml of bone marrow (harvested by sternal and anterior iliac puncture) was injected peri-lesionally (4 injections) after isolation by Ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Total CD34+ counts were 6.4x10 6 (0.1x10 6 /kg), CFU-GM 1.1x10 6 (1.8x10 4 /kg). Half of the HSC were given immediately (the other half was cryopreserved for a later use). There were no complications associated with the injections. On d21 after HSC injection progression of the necrosis stopped with revascularization at the edges, improvement in odor, defecation and weakness. Through the necrosed cervix, remaining intrauterine necrotic tissue was removed. As of last observation the necrotic process has been stopped. These results suggest that peri-lesional injection of HSC for radionecrosis is feasible and may possibly contribute to tissue regeneration. Future studies are planed to confirm those encouraging results and to try to understand the mechanisms involved. (1) Preclinical studies have shown the potential of these cells to ameliorate the outcome of Acute Myocardial Infarct animal models. Our goal was to assess the feasibility, security and efficacy of the intracoronarial injection of BMSC. Methods: We recruited 13 consecutive patients, age 49 \u00b1 10, 12 of them male, who fulfilled the following criteria: successful reperfusion by primary angioplasty in the first 12 h of the AMI (TIMI flow 3, residual stenosis <30%), at least 2 non viable adjacent segments by gadolinium magnetic resonance (GMR) and age 18 to 75. Patients were given conventional postAMI treatment with beta-blockers, statins, ACEI and double antiaggregation. 60 mL of bone marrow were extracted 9,9\u00b13,4 days post-AMI. Ficoll gradient was performed obtaining 340\u00b1140 x10 6 mononuclear cells with a median of 6,6x10 6 CD34+ cells that were resuspended in 20 mL of autologous plasma and immediately infused by coronary catheterism. Efficacy of the procedure was evaluated one year later by GMR measuring necrotic mass (NM), left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and telediastolic (TDV) and telesystolic volume (TSV). Results: There were no adverse events related to the procedure during the time of the study. No significant difference was observed between the basal and one year GMR results: NM (gr) 17,16\u00b110,83 vs 18,24\u00b112,18 (p=0,38,) LVEF(%) 42,26\u00b17,02 vs 41,27\u00b17,6 (p=0,53), TDV (mL) 192, 55\u00b144, 7 vs 195, 13\u00b161, 3 (p=0, 95) , TSV (mL) 112,9\u00b138,7 vs 120,56\u00b147,11 (p=0,95). Conclusions: Intracoronary infusion of BMSC is a feasible and secure procedure. In our study we observed no significant improvement on the necrosis mass or in the left ventricle function parameters. These results are in consonance with the recently published randomized studies in which no benefit was observed among the patients with mild ventricular disfunction.",

Mart\u00ednez, J.M. Moraleda Hospital Morales Meseguer (Murcia, E) Background and Objectives: No effective treatment is available for demyelinizating neurodegenerative diseases. Our goal was to asses the ability of umbilical cord blood stem cells to regenerate a demyelinizating injury. Methods: A demyelinizating injury in the right parietal hemisphere was performed by intracerebral infusion of LaLysolecitin to 59 mice of 4 to 8 weeks of age. Fresh umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were infused in the opposite hemisphere. These cells were previously labelled with CellTracker Orange (n=22) or with Qtracker 605 (n=8). Non labelled cells were infused in 12 mice. Control mice were infused with saline (n=8), the supernatant of the last wash of the labelling with either CellTracker (n=5) or Qtracker's (n=2). No infusion was performed in 2 mice. The animals were sacrificed 1 (n=8), 7 (n=8), 15 (n=19) or 30 (n=24) days after the infusion. Immunofluorescence with anti-Human Nuclei, anti-HLA ABC and anti-CD45 was done to check the human origin of the cells, with anti-Doublecortin and anti-Nestin to assess their differentiation into neural stem cells, with anti-bIIItubulin to check their differentiation into neurons, anti-NG2 and anti-AA3 for oligodendrocytes and anti-GFAP for astrocytes. Results: A median of 250.000 mononuclear cells with 755 CD34+ and 531 CD133+ cells were infused. One day after the infusion, CD45, HLA ABC, Human nuclei and CellTracker labelled immunopositive cells were observed in the infusion place and in the corpus callosum, crossing to the opposite hemisphere in coincidence with the presence of hemorrhage. Mice brains with survival >1 week showed the presence of cells with a brownish, autofluorescent, Sudan black positive material in the same locations where the hemorrhage had been localized. Some of these cells were positive for CellTracker and QTracker. We did not see any human antigens\u00b4 positive cells in these brains and colabelling of CellTracker or QTracker positive cells with the brain cells antigens studied was not observed. Conclusions: Human cord blood cells survive in the adult mice at least for 1 day, and migrate towards the injured area. After one week the human cells disappear and are replaced by cells containing a hemofucsin-like material. Some of these cells contain CellTracker or QTracker suggesting that they are mice phagocytic cells and that the human cells have suffered an immunological rejection. Immunosupression of the animals is necessary to obtain stable human grafts.",
