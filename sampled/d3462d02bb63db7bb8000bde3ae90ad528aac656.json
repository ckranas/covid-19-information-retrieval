Methods A total number of 252 patients with anterior Mandibular fracture were selected for the study and divided randomly into two groups, Group A 126 patients and Group B 126 Patients. The Group A patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation using conventional titanium miniplates and Group B patients underwent the same using customised titanium CRB omega miniplate. The surgeries were carried out by the same operating surgeon. Duration of surgery was measured for every case from the placement of incision to the closure of defect. Subsequent postoperative follow up for occlusion, postoperative complications like paraesthesia, infection, hardware failure were assessed. Radiological healing was evaluated for all patients at 1st, 3rd and 6th months post operatively. Results A major difference in results of surgery is seen between both the groups with less duration of surgery and less postoperative complications like paraesthesia, infection, hardware failure along with good radiological bone healing seen in customised omega CRB miniplate (Group B) patients.",

Abstract Background/Introduction Trauma to face, particularly above the level of mouth, require a careful examination to assess ophthalmic and orbital injuries. Inappropriate diagnosis and inadequate care for these injuries can result in blindness with social and medico legal implications. The early detection of vision threatening injuries and timely referral to an ophthalmologist is needed to reduce the incidence of vision loss in midface trauma. By the study we can assess the prevalence of ophthalmic and orbital injuries in midface fractures and how often a surgical intervention is required in the correction of these injuries. The co-relationship between various midface fractures and ophthalmic injuries is assessed in this study.",

TCR is a triad of bradycardia, bradypnea and gastric motility changes due to the efferent activation of the vagal nerve in response to the pressure distribution in V5. TCR is seen in most of faciomaxillary procedures in maxilla or mandible. It is important to have knowledge of this sudden physiological response in maxillofacial surgery.

About 37 patients were observed with significant bradycardia which resolved with the cessation of stimulus, however 1 patients developed asystole which needed administration of atropine. Conclusions TCR is a physiologic response which may mimic a closed cranial injury or a cardiac dysarrythmia in a post traumatic patient. Though the reflex resolves without complications however whenever surgery is planned in maxillofacial region and if TCR is anticipated, continuous and closed ECG monitoring is important. The reflex cannot be neglected in maxillofacial injuries. ",

The treatment options in the management of maxillofacial injuries are numerous and not without controversies. The management of trauma evolved from the supportive bandage to splints and has changed from close to open reduction and direct fixation using bone plates and screws. Michelet et al began experimenting with mono-cortical non compression miniplates. He described the treatment of fractures using small, easily bendable, non compression miniplates, anchored with mono-cortical screws. Champy et al. showed that the superior mandibular border was subjected to tension and splaying, and the inferior border was subjected to compression plates placed along the ideal line of osteosynthesis were thought to provide optimal fixation and stability. As these plates were small and the screws mono-cortical, it simplified surgery and reduce surgical morbidity.

            "text": "Abstract Background/Introduction Injuries to the face, head and neck are relatively common and yet, in the overall trauma literature, very little attention has been paid to malunited fracture cases of maxillofacial region. Fractures of maxillofacial region have been treated by a number of methods, including closed reduction, external pin fixation, internal wire fixation and more recently, open reduction and internal stable fixation using plates and/ or screws. In last few years maxillofacial surgery emerged out as major field in modern era of surgical practice. But due to lack of awareness and specialist expertise availability in most of the areas of our country such injuries may go undiagnosed or most of the times wrongly diagnosed and treated as well. Malunited fractures have always been a big challenge to the surgeon. As such there is no treatment protocol available in the literature which can guide us to build a definitive line of treatment in managing these fractures. However we can follow certain basic principles for management of post traumatic skeletal deformity. Most important of all in approaching such cases is to have a proper history and requirement of the patient. The one which is most concerned to the patient should be on top priority. Occlusion is a point on which no compromise is acceptable. Minimally invasive procedures and relatively simple measures can sometimes yield a marked improvement in net result. So a calculated approach should be taken while operating such cases. Treat each case as a new case and set criteria of your own depending upon the patient situation and its requirement. This paper is all about presenting such few cases of malunion treated in our unit and discuss the challenges and complications encountered during their management. ",

Abstract Background/Introduction Bone plates and screws have today become the mainstay in the management of fractures in the maxillofacial region. The screw head allows for the attachment of the screwdriver and to arrest forward motion. Monocortical screws for use in internal fixation are commonly available with a single slot and a cruciate slot, the later said to provide a measure of redundancy. Despite this the monoslotted screws are in widespread use in the Indian Subcontinent. The authors have endeavoured to verify the touted advantage of the cross slotted monocortical screws as against the monoslotted screws in rampant use today.",

Abstract Background/Introduction Orthognathic surgery and distraction osteogenesis are the most favored surgical treatment modalities for cleft maxillary hypoplasia. Distraction has various benefits over orthognathic surgery such as evading bone grafting and donor site morbidity and its concurrent expansion of soft tissue envelope. Maxillary distraction with Rigid External Distraction (RED) device has proved to be effective in treating cleft maxillary hypoplasia. However, there are a few disadvantages such as an expensive halo frame and patient discomfort whereas Anterior Maxillary Distraction (AMD) with a tooth borne appliance is more patient compliant. On review of literature, there are no reports comparing the airway and only a report comparing the profile changes of cleft patients on RED and AMD.",

Abstract Background/Introduction Conventionally, autogenous bone graft was considered the gold standard in the maxillary sinus floor grafting procedures. However, following research and advances in the field of implant dentistry, many substitutes were devised. These included synthetic graft materials which avoided the common complications associated with autogenous graft materials. Later, certain growth factors were discovered which enhanced and accelerated the bone formation process and was initially used only in conjunction with graft materials. However, later many studies were conducted to decisively prove that growth factors alone were required for the bone forming process irrespective of the use of graft materials.",

The outcome variables were maximum voluntary mouth opening, deviation on mouth opening, pain-visual analog scale, joint sounds (crepitations/clicking). Results 54 patients, including 28 females and 26 males were studied. The age group was 25 to 40 years. Patients received 3 injections of hyaluronic acid at 10 days interval according to their symptoms. 38 patients showed a significant reduction in symptoms after the first injection.

Conclusions Intra articular injection of Hyaluronic acid is a highly effective treatment modality in patients with TMJ OA, non-responsive to other conservative measures. Abstract Background/Introduction TMJ ankylosis is a common debilitating disease affecting a large number of patients particularly affecting young growing children (1) . The most common cause leading to TMJ ankylosis has been attributed to childhood trauma to mandible (1) . The main modality of treatment is interpositional arthroplasty. There are number of interpositional material utilized for the treatment including temporalis muscle, temporalis fascia, skin, costocondral graft, fat and even alloplastic material etc. The main problem in the management of the disease has been recurrence of the problem if proper post operative physiotherapy is not followed by patients. Post operative physiotherapy is affected by many factors especially pain at surgical site postoperatively. Dermal fat has been successfully utilized as an interpositional material in the long run (2) . Objectives This study was planned to assess the success of dermal fat as interpositional material in maintaining adequate pain free post surgical mouth opening and the eventual fate of dermal fat graft at the grafted site. Methods Inclusion criteria: 1. All TMJ ankylosis patients reporting to Dept of OMFS irrespective of age and sex. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients refusing the surgery. 2. Any medical and surgical condition contraindicating the harvest of graft. 3. Pregnant patients. Method: Preauricular incision for removal of ankylotic mass, creating a gap of at least 1.0 cm intraoperatively, achieving intraoperative mouth opening of atleast 3.5cm, contralateral coronoidectomy if required, filling the gap with abdominal dermis fat. Assessing pain at 1 week and 30 days postoperatively by Visual Analogue scale.",

Difficulty in mouth opening and vigorous post operative exercise are troublesome for the patient if Temporalis muscle is used as the interposition material due to compression of the nerves which may subsequently reduce the mouth opening. An ugly bulging in the temporal region after harvesting of that side may not be neglected. However the versatility of the Temporalis Myofacial flap technique in Interpositional material is not certain and failure may occur. The jaw movements and physiotherapy are well tolerated and maintained by patients if the gaps were filled with dermis fat grafts. The dermis fat graft minimizes the occurrence of excessive joint fibrosis and heterotopic calcification and consequently providing improved range of motion. Graft procurement is quick and easy with minimal morbidity and the wound and scar in the anatomical skin creases are accepted cosmetically. The results obtained in our study are highly satisfactory and encouraging, supporting the role of dermis fat graft as the interposition material in TMJ Ankylosis cases especially in children. However, a large sample size and a longer follow-up period are required to consolidate the findings. The pathogenesis of OSMF suggested that exposure to arecanut (Arecacatechu) containing products with or without tobacco currently believed to lead to OSF in individuals with genetic immunologic or nutritional predisposition to the disease. These collagen fibers are non degradable and the phagocytic activity is minimized. As the disease progresses various cardinal features established like pain on palpation in the sites where submucosal fibrotic bands are developing, trismus is caused mostly by fibrosis in the dense tissue around the ptery-gomandibular raphae but it is and it is also observed that it may be because of involvement of muscles of mastication. There are fewer evidences supporting this hypothesis. So we planned to conduct a study to evaluate involvement of muscles of mastication in OSMF using ultrasonography and subsequent Myotomy of the involved muscles to see improvement in mouth opening.",

Two techniques exist for identification of the facial nerve, namely the antegrade and retrograde techniques. The retrograde technique involves tracing a peripheral branch proximally towards the trunk. Several anatomical landmarks have been listed for antegrade dissection of the facial nerve trunk and its branches distally. These anatomical landmarks are the cartilaginous tragal pointer, digastric ridge, stylomastoid foramen, tympano mastoid suture line and mastoid process. We propose identification of two landmarks, the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle's mastoid insertion and the posterior belly of digastric (PBD) muscle's mastoid insertion to serve as easy and consistent superficial landmarks to trace the main trunk of the facial nerve.",

Methods 16 patients of unilateral parotid gland disease underwent superficial parotidectomies by the same surgical team from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016. 10 were male and 6 female. Institutional ethical committee clearance was taken for this study. Mean age of the patients was 42 years and mean duration of presentation of symptoms was 1.2 years. All patients were subjected to MRI for purpose of imaging and a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was carried out in all patients to confirm the diagnosis prior to listing the patient for surgery. 12 patients were diagnosed with benign salivary gland tumors (9 pleomorphic adenomas, 2 basal cell adenomas and 1 Warthin's tumor) and 4 with chronic non specific sialadenitis of the parotid gland. Routine investigations were ordered and pre anesthetic check up carried out. Detailed informed consent listing out all possible complications with emphasis on facial nerve palsy was obtained from the patient. Endotracheal intubation was carried out and surgery performed under general anaesthesia. Aseptic scrubbing and draping was performed and 1;80,000 concentrated Adrenaline solution infiltrated along the proposed incision line for vasoconstriction. Modified Blair's lazy S incision was made (Fig 1) and flap raised in a sub platysmal plane in the cervical region and along the superficial musculo aponeurotic (SMAS) layer over the parotid gland to expose the glistening white parotid fascia/capsule (Fig 2) . Sharp dissection is carried out upto the depth of the parotid fascia in the preauricular area and through platysma in the cervical region. Anterior and posterior flaps are then raised along this relatively avascular plane, to expose the parotid gland anteriorly and the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly. Great care should be taken not to raise an excessively thin flap which can cause ''button-holing'' and also increases the chances of Frey's syndrome developing post operatively. The anterior border of the SCM which was identified is used to expose the tail of the parotid. The fascia overlying the muscle provides a safe plane to elevate the tail of the gland. Sharp dissection is carried out to separate the tail of the parotid gland off the SCM and also the cartilaginous external auditory canal. The greater auricular nerve running on the superficial surface of the SCM is identified and divided as close to the parotid gland as possible in an attempt to preserve the posterior branch if possible which may also serve as a potential nerve graft if required. Next, the skeletonised anterior border of SCM is retracted inferiorly to expose the PBD muscle which is then cleanly separated and visualised. The mastoid process is palpated and the mastoid insertions of both the SCM and the PBD dissected and exposed. The facial nerve trunk (FNT) can be found exiting the stylomastoid foramen just above the attachment of the PBD to the mastoid process (Fig 3) . Thereafter, using bipolar cautery and sharp dissection, the cervicofacial and temporofacial divisions are exposed and the 'pes anserinus' dissected while bluntly lifting off the superficial lobe of the parotid gland from the nerve branches (Fig 4) .",

The landmarks described are consistent, superficial, easily distinguishable and in close proximity to the facial nerve trunk, thereby allowing easier exposure of the same. In our study, we have observed and demonstrated that rather than relying on anatomical landmarks such as the tragal pointer which is inconsistent, inaccurate and vague or bony landmarks such as the tymanomastoid fissure, styloid process, mastoid tip and stylomastoid foramen which require deeper dissection and can cause inadvertent damage to the facial nerve trunk, the mastoid heads of the SCM and the PBD are relatively superficial, easy to dissect, consistent and reliable landmarks to locate the FNT with minimal post op paresis/neuropraxia.",

Prof. Messerklinger's work in late 1960s and early 1970s on sinus mucosa and mucocilliary transport has proved that the pathology is not principally in the larger sinuses but is secondary to impaired drainage caused by the disease in the ethmoidal air cells blocking their natural Ostia in the middle turbinate which leads to stagnation of secretions and hence, persistent infection resulting in a vicious cycle causing mucosal swelling that can be so gross as to appear ''irreversible.

The postoperative phase is characterized by signs and symptoms such as pain, oedema, restricted opening of the mouth and potential loss of function, due to the inflammatory response to the surgery. Dexamethasone is quite widely used to minimize pain, and principally oedema, after third molar extractions. Despite this, researchers have suggested further studies using Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors for oral surgery.

The sensory component of the cervical plexus can be blocked separately and easily by a superficial cervical plexus block. Both motor and sensory block can be obtained by deep cervical plexus block. Minor transient side effects are common to deep cervical plexus blocks, but they are rarely of any consequence. Recent years have seen an increase in interest in the use of the cervical plexus block, because its popularity for surgical procedures such as carotid endarterectomies has grown. An understanding of the anatomy and principles of this anesthetic technique will enable the clinician to offer the patient and surgeon an important anesthetic option.",

Substantial evidence also points to the fact that patients understand significantly less than we think.

PRF was first described by Choukran et al. in the year 2001. its not only has a workable three dimension architecture but exhibits varied potent local properties such as cell migration, cell attachment, cell proliferation and cell differentiation. it has been shown as an ideal biomaterial. To prepare PRF, 20 ml of the blood was withdrawn from the patient's antecubital vein and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000rpm per minute. In vitro studies have proved that PRF releases autologous growth factors gradually for at least one week and upto 28 days. PRF when used in conjunction with bone grafts offers several advantages including better wound healing, bone growth and maturation, graft stabilization, wound sealing and hemostasis and improving handling properties of the graft materials. Clinical trials have suggested the combination of bone grafts and growth factors combined with PRF may be suitable for enhanced bone density. PRF can also be obtained in the form of membrane by squeezing out fluid in the fibrin clot, thus it acts as both healing and interposition biomaterial. As healing material it accelerates wound closure and mucosal healing due to fibrin bandage and growth factor release. As interposition material, it avoids therapy invagination of undesired cells, thereby behaves as a competitive barrier between desired and undesired cells. Placement of DFDBA in the extraction socket provide scaffold for bone remodelling around the tooth. PRF clot mixed with DFDBA allowed rapid healing. Radicular cysts were treated by combination of endodontic therapy followed by surgical management with PRF and bioactive glass. The results showed that its an effective modality of regenarative treatment for radicular cysts. PRF is safely used in large perforation which might occur during sinus lifting with the presence of an antral pseudocyst. PRF has advantages for oral surgery operation, such as no chemical additives, reduced production time, easy application, and good adaptation to the operation area. Objectives Not applicable.

There is a continuing evolution in surgical approaches for accesses to these tumours. During the last century there have been frequent periods when a number of methods have competed as alternative surgical techniques for better outcome to the patient. Each of these approaches is associated with pros and cons and it remains to be seen whether these innovations are advantageous or not.

The most appropriate application is to enable the predictable intrusion and distalization of maxillary and mandibular molars. In the posterior maxilla, centering the miniplate on the zygomatic buttress ensures the best stability. Location of the incision is particularly important, more so if tooth intrusion is intended. Traditionally vestibular approach has been used for fixation of zygomaticomaxillary buttress region transorally. The disadvantages are limited access and visualization of the buttress, the most distal portion of the incision is difficult to suture, and the buccal fat pad often interferes with both the operation and closure. A newly designed curvilinear oblique incision to access the zygomatic buttress, improves the access, avoids excessive muscle stripping and aids in tension free closure. ",

Immobilization with maxillomandibular fixation and/or splints, removal of diseased teeth in the fracture line, external fixation, use of antibiotics, debridement, and rigid internal fixation has played a role in management. Perhaps the most important advance was the realization that infected fractures also result from moving fragments and nonvital bone, not just bacteria. Controlling movement and eliminating the dead bone allowed body defenses to also eliminate bacteria. The next logical step in the evolution of treatment was primary bone grafting of the resulting defect following application of rigid internal fixation and debridement of the dead bone.",

Currently there is a greater understanding of the complex anatomy of the orbit and changes that occur within the orbit from disruption of its contents caused by trauma. Practitioners generally agree that the optimal treatment is to restore the normal bony architecture and reduce the herniated orbital tissues. Despite advances made in understanding of the injury, wide variation still exists in the method of reconstruction.",

The major clinical manifestation is skeletal fragility. Other extraskeletal manifestations include hearing loss, dentinogenesis imperfecta, blue/gray sclerae, hypercalciuria, aortic root dilatation, and neurologic conditions. An eight and half year old patient reported to our department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with a history of fall at home while playing 4 days earlier with swelling of left TMJ area. He was diagnosed with a left subcondylar fracture which was managed conservatively. Hardly two months later he again reported with a right side fracture of body of mandible which happened due to fall again while playing and was treated conservatively. Due to increased bone fragility with increased incidence of fracture the patient was sent for a through medical examination and was diagnosed with osteogenisis imperfecta. Increased fracture risk in individuals with OI could stem from a combination of reduced bone mass, decreased bone material and quality. The reduced bone mass can lead to increased stresses within the bone as a result of a smaller area of bone tissue present to support physiological loads contributing to bone fragility in OI. Therefore goals of the treatment in OI are to decrease pain and fractures and to maximize mobility. Physical therapy/rehabilitation is particularly important in children to prevent fractures as well as to increase strength and mobility during fracture recovery as observed in our patient.",

Abstract Background/Introduction Locking plate systems offer advantages like, it becomes unnecessary for the plate to intimately contact the underlying bone in all areas. As the screws are tightened, they ''lock'' to the plate, thus stabilizing the segments without the need to compress the bone to the plate. Moreover it also decreases the hardware usage in the operating table and also aids in the decrease in the operating time. It also decreases the amount of infection and other hardware related problems. Many studies demonstrated that treating anterior mandibular fractures with the use of single locking reconstruction plates, placed at the inferior border of the mandible, could neutralize compression and tensile forces, obviating the use of a second plate at the superior border of the mandible. Moreover with this study it was observed that there were no disturbances in the post-operative occlusion and fracture stability was also seen post-operatively. As torsional forces in the parasymphysis region are very high, Champy had used upper plate as tension band but many surgeons think lower arch bar can be used as a tension band and eliminate the need for upper plate.",

Injuries resulting from firearms in India are fortunately rare, compare to the the United States and certain Latin American nations, where death and injury from firearms are a relatively common occurrence. Although the incidence has increased during past decades, People who remain alive after multiple injury require the coordination of multiple surgical disciplines to optimize the functional and aesthetic consequence. Definitive management of patients with ballistic injury remains controversial in terms of reconstruction of bone and soft tissue defects. However there is consensus about the four main steps in the management of patients with gunshot wounds to the face: securing on airway, controlling haemorrhage, identifying other injuries, and repair of the traumatic facial deformities.",

Individuals with clefts of the lip, palate, or alveolus often require interdisciplinary treatment into adulthood. The complexity of the tissues and structures involved in cleft palates pose a significant challenge to the treating surgeon. A multitude of surgical techniques have been described to repair clefts of the lip, palate, or alveolus, Bone grafting is carried out to consolidate the dental arch correlated with the stage of canine development the surgical repair of cleft palates is not without consequence. The disturbance of facial growth in multiple dimensions is often the result of cleft palate surgery. Donor site morbidity after bone graft harvest remains a recognized limitation in the reconstruction of the cleft primary palate. The field of tissue engineering aims to restore function to or replace damaged or diseased tissues through the application of engineering and biologic principles.

A free segment of bone is gradually moved across the osseous defect. After the transport bone reaches the other end, compression forces are applied till the transport and target segments are fused. This novel biological transport disc represents an effective non-secondary injury method to enhance new bone formation in non-vascular transport distraction osteogenesis. Objectives 1. To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of transport distraction. 2. To review the current concepts and application of transport distraction in maxillomandibular defects. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent transport distraction for the correction of different defects.

In most cases of masseter hypertrophy it is bilateral and symmetric, but asymmetry is not unusual. The masseter muscle is essential for adequate mastication and is located laterally to the mandibular ramus, and thus plays an important role in facial esthetics. A hypertrophied masseter will alter facial lines, generating discomfort, and negative cosmetic impacts in many patients. Muscle function may also be impaired, thus introducing conditions such as trismus, protrusion, and bruxism. Masseter hypertrophy leads to the prominent mandibular angle which is considered to be aesthetically unacceptable. Here we report the management of bilateral massetric hypertrophy by a surgical intraoral approach involving the debulking of the masseter muscle with bicorticalostectomy of the angle of the mandible.

For being a competent Rhinoplasty Surgeon, the complete understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the nasal structure is essential. The manipulation of the four parameters: The Tripod, Pedestal, Dorsum & Soft tissue envelope allows the surgeon to recreate the desired alterations. An absolute understanding of the grafting materials with the proficiency of the surgeon, is used to meet the unique needs of the patient. The most commonly used Autograft in Rhinoplasty is Septal Cartilage. Used in case of spreader, alar or tip grafting. The most commonly used Allograft is A-cellular Dermal Matrix, used as a graft camouflage. The Alloplastic grafts used in Cosmetic Rhinoplasty range from silicone to poly-tetra-flouro-ethylene to poly-diaxone in cases of a deficient nasal dorsum. As conclusion, the Autologous septal cartilage is the gold standard for graft material in cosmetic rhinoplasty.

It can be roughly divided into facelift surgery and nonoperative, less invasive procedures, like fatgrafts, fillers, botox injections, thread-lifts or laserbrasion.

Abstract Background/Introduction Three dimensional (3D) printing has been widely adopted in medical fields. Application of the 3D printing technique has even been extended to bio-cell printing for 3D tissue/organ development, the creation of scaffolds for tissue engineering, and actual clinical application for various medical parts. Of various medical fields, craniofacial plastic surgery is one of areas that pioneered the use of the 3D printing concept. Rapid Prototype technology was introduced in the 1990s to medicine via computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM).the medical models or bio-models based on the 3D printing technique represent 1:1 scale portions of the human anatomical region of interest obtained via 3D medical imaging. The procedure for the fabrication of medical models consists of multiple steps: (1) acquisition of high-quality volumetric 3D image data of the anatomical structure to be modeled, (2) 3D image processing to extract the region of interest from the surrounding tissues, (3) mathematical surface modeling of the anatomic surfaces, (4) formatting of data for rapid prototyping, (5) model building, and (6) Quality assurance of the model and its dimensional accuracy.

Abstract Background/Introduction Implant therapy is in the age of being increasingly aesthetically driven, not merely restorative. With the increasing popularity of immediate implants, particularly with anterior tooth extraction, the relevance of socket changes following extraction has come to the fore. Healing of extraction sockets undergoes a remodelling process which leads to horizontal and vertical bone loss. There have been several strategies employed to minimize these aesthetic problems using grafting technique to retain the original dimensions of the bone after extraction which require the use of bone grafting materials, additional surgical site morbidity and there still remains an uncertainty of the long term outcomes. Socket shield technique has demonstrated the potential in preventing buccal bone from resorption in animal and clinical studies. Methods 30 cases done at our institute with mean follow up of 6 months were included. The procedures considered were onlay bone grafts, khoury technique, ridge split, sandwich technique, bone shield and Titanium mesh. Success and related morbidities of the augmentation procedures were analyzed. Results A total of 30 cases were reviewed. However, it was difficult to demonstrate that one surgical procedure offered better outcomes than other. Conclusions Every augmentation procedure requires substantial planning and different augmentation technique. Every surgical procedure presents advantages and disadvantages. Priority should be given to those procedures which are simpler and less invasive, involve less risk of complications and reach their goals within the shortest time frame.",

Dental implant generally has a high success rate, but there is a group of cases in which implants fail. Infection is thought to play an important role in the failure, as implant placement surgery is of the clean contaminated type. The contamination of the implant surface by bacterial biofilm during surgical procedure can lead to an inflammatory process of the hard and soft tissues thus decreasing the implant success rate. Many different techniques have been used to avoid infection during surgical procedure such as the use of chlorhexidine mouth wash rinse before the intervention, double aspiration to avoid salivary contamination of the surgical wound, reducing the amount of saliva secreted using atropine and by the use of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens. Many studies suggested that use of prophylactic antibiotic prior to implant surgery will significantly reduce implant failure.",

PDT is an excitation of photosensitizers induced in the body by exposing it to light of appropriate wavelength. Objectives PDT is a Minimal invasive therapy and overcomes the complications of conventional surgical procedures, chemotherapy and radiotherapy that are associated further with tissue impairment and cosmetic defects. Methods PDT is local than a systemic treatment, involving photosensitizers e.g. Photofrin, ALA, Foscan that are preferentially concentrated in neoplastic cells, followed by local illumination of tumor with an appropriate light wavelength to activate the specific drug which interacts with the molecular oxygen and generates the singlet oxygen that is highly toxic and reactive. This singlet oxygen kills the tumor cells by apoptosis or necrosis diffusing 0.02 micrometer tissue. So, tissue penetration depth is desirably restricted by the wavelength of light used to activate the photosensitizers. Results PDT is effective over conventional therapies for the treatment of early (Cis, T1, T2) squamous cell cancers of the head and neck. Conclusions PDT a promising therapy used in association with surgery to increase tumor-free margins that ultimately increases the cure rates. Hence, PDT is used in curative and palliative treatment of refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with minimum recurrence but maximum success rates. Clinical trials & evidences proves PDT to be a good treatment substitute for localized, superficial tumors, and precancerous lesions with excellent & functional cosmetic results that enhances the quality of life of squamous cell carcinoma patients.

Anger was not a factor seen among any caregiver except 3 cases where the caregiver was young and financially compromised which might have been the main problem. Almost 90% of the caregivers were afraid and uncertain of what the future holds for their relative. The remaining 10% were financially and education wise more well to do, more aware and had an idea about what the prognosis of the disease could be. Strain and health was not seen to be a hindrance factor in about 37 patients. The remaining, including the ones over 55 years of age, had health problems of their own and were suffering from the same. Financial expenses were found to be significant in this study with most of the caregivers being below Rs. 5000 p.m slab. But owing to various insurance schemes a little of the burden was found to be taken off from the caregivers mind. Even then almost 95% of the caregivers thought that what they were doing for caring for their relative was not enough and they wanted to do a better job at their treatment. About 20 caregivers felt that they have lost control of their private life since the onset and diagnosis of the patients illness but when questioned about the same, about 10 patients had personal problems of their own in the household which made balancing the jobs difficult. About 98% of the caregivers felt that their relative had full expectations of ONLY him/ her to take care of him/her. Only 2 caregivers thought that they would like to probably hand over the care of their relative to someone else as they thought themselves incapable of taking care of the patient longer.

Abstract Background/Introduction White lesions both physiologic as well as pathologic are relatively frequent in the oral cavity, the most common pathology being oral leukoplakia. There are many variants of Oral Leukoplakia, one of which is proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL). PVL is a rare clinico pathological entity, which is slow growing, long term progressive lesion, but remains an enigmatic and difficult to define. The etiology of PVL remains still unclear. Tobacco use does not seem to have a significant influence on the appearance of PVL. These lesions may occur both in smokers and non smokers. Various case have presented PVL as a disease with aggressive biological behavior due to its high probability of recurrence and a high rate of Malignant transformation. Prognosis is poor for this seemingly harmless appearing lesion of the oral mucosa. The complete excision and definitive treatment modality are need of time. Objectives To evaluate the use of different treatment options in the management of PVL. Methods All patients reporting to Dept.of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery between June 2015-June 2017 were included in study. Total 28 patients [M-19, F-9] age 25 yr to 58 yrs with leucoplakia lesion on more than one sight in same oral cavity were included in study. Histopathological diagnosis were confirmed on Biopsy. Patients with medically compromised condition & with biopsy showing malignancy were excluded from the study.

Abstract Background/Introduction Tissue assessment and diagnosis are critical in the clinical management of cancer patients and more so during surgical excision for margin evaluation. Conventional methods for histopathological tissue diagnosis are labor-and time-intensive and can delay decision making during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Molecular analysis of cancer tissues offers the exciting opportunity to incorporate cancer specific biomarkers into clinical decision making for improved cancer detection and diagnosis, one of them being Mass Spectrometry Imaging. Objectives One of the greatest challenges cancer surgeon faces is determining the delicate boundary between cancerous and normal tissues to achieve negative margins for invasive and carcinoma in situ while optimizing aesthetic outcomes. Thus, accurate negative margin assessment and complete tumour excision are highly desirable for prolonged disease free and overall survival.",

The distal part of fibula helps in stabilising ankle joint. 10 cm of lower part of fibula is very important for stability of ankle joint. Study of perforators & vascular supply of fibula is desirable. It is currently used to reconstruct bone defects, particularly during limb reconstruction and in maxillofacial reconstruction following benign & malignant jaw tumour ablation. Larger fibular flaps are preferably taken from left side as it is non-dominant. Though it has several advantages, the procedure can lead to disrupt lower limb's function.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful reconstruction performed for treating a mandibular defect by using autologous human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in a patient with plexiform ameloblastoma. In this article, we report the result of the mandibular reconstruction with autologous human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and autogenous bone graft, followed by the placement of osteointegrated dental implant and prosthodontic treatment in a patientwith plexiform ameloblastoma. Objectives reconstruction with autologous human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and autogenous bone graft, followed by the placement of osteointegrated dental implant and prosthodontic treatment in a patient with plexiform ameloblastoma. Methods Under general anesthesia, the patient's right mandibular defect was exposed via intraoral approach. The cortical block bone was harvested in the opposite buccal area. It was fixed using plates and screws as a scaffold for the formation of a bone tray. Then, AHBMMSCs (4.8 107 cells/1.6 mL) were injected into the scaffold. Differentiated autologous osteoblasts (RMS Ossron; Sewoncellontech, Seoul, South Korea) were mixed with fibrin glue (Greenplast; Green Cross, Yongin, South Korea) in a 1:1 ratio and applied (Fig. 2) . At a postoperative 3-month follow-up, AHBM-MSCs were injected again into the mandibular defect area for the acceleration of bone formation.",

Alternatively, use of tissue engineering showed exciting promising results at preclinical level and in the limited clinical trial.

Surgical technique have become more aggressive, with primary surgical repair directed at restoring bony orbital volume and contour while repositioning herniated orbital tissues. Numerous materials -both naturally occurring and synthetic substances -are available for reconstructing damaged orbital walls to restore orbital volume. Autogenous materials remain the gold standard to which other materials are compared yet Alloplasts have gained popularity for orbital wall reconstruction for their ease of use and elimination of the need for a second operation and its associated morbidity. Objectives This paper seeks to address the controversy regarding application of two very commonly used alloplastic materials-Titanium mesh and Prolene through a series of cases. Methods Titanium mesh has good biocompatibility and is easily adjustable. It is easy to trim and mould exactly to the orbital contour. Because of the mesh structure, connective tissue can grow around and through the implant, preventing its migration. It can be reliably fixed with screws in areas such as the infraorbital border and can be sterilized in autoclaves. Prolene mesh is composed of high-density micropores connected to each other, which allows fibrovascular tissues to advance into the implant. This structure provides certain rigidity to the polyethylene and allows it to automatically fixate to the adjacent tissues. It is strong yet flexible and easy to contour and shape using scissors or a scalpel, and it can be contoured into the desired shape.",

Usually there are two types of treatment given, surgical, which includes arthroscopy, acupuncture, arthrocentesis in TMD and non surgical, includes physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, NSAIDS, local anesthetics, TMJ injections, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, occlusal appliance therapy and occlusal adjustments. Arthrocentesis is joint lavage which washes out the inflammatory mediators, thereby, relieving pain. Arthrocentesis is a relatively simple office procedure which allows expansion of the joint space, lysis of adhesions and lavage via blind input and outflow catheters. However, surgeons can be faced with some clinical difficulties with two needles during the procedure such as displacement of the needles during the irrigation and difficulty of inserting the outflow needle in the right place. To combat this difficulty, TMJ lavage with double needle in a single canula has been documented in the literature. However it was not in routine use probably because of the lack of presentation. The purpose of this presentation is to describe this instrument and state the advantages of the technique.",

The joint space is not encroached upon, but since the pterygoid plates from which both the pterygoid muscles originate are detached, the spasm in these muscles is presumably relieved. The anterior and upward pull on the condyle is reduced, which in turn reduces the pressure on the retrodiscal lamina and alleviates the pain. Since the joint space is under less pressure, there is a better chance for the marginally displaced disc to return to its normal position. It can be deduced that the joint becomes lax and the movements become smoother, thus inducing less strain in the posterior lamina.",

Recurrent Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation is characterized by a condyle that slides over the articular eminence, catches briefly beyond the eminence, and then returns to the fossa. There are well-documented surgical and conservative treatments for chronic recurrent dislocation of the TMJ, and the injection of sclerosing solution around the articular capsule and/or into the articular cavity has benn proposed as a nonsurgical treatment, and Autologus blood injection around the articular capsule and/or into the articular cavity also recently used. 1973 Schulz was the first to report experience with it to treat recurrent condylar dislocation. The rationale of ABI is that blood is injected into the pericapsular tissues and the superior joint space. The bleeding into the pericapsular tissues as a result of the introduction of a needle will create a bed for the formation of fibrous tissue. The role of ABI into the superior joint space is not fully understood, but it may lead to the formation of intercompartmental adhesions. Importantly, restrained mandibular movement is the key to the success of the procedure. recently injection of autologous blood (ABI) around the articular capsule/or into the articular cavity has been described. The procedure is easy, and causes no foreign body reaction.",

Moreover, surgical stents are fabricated using computed tomography (CT) images in the field of dental implantology3. It is necessary to move forward and adopt this technology in the fabrication of complex forms of molds in order to provide individualized medical services. For example, easier production of customized and reconstruction plates and morphologic reconstruction of bony defect areas are possible uses of 3D printing in fracture surgery or reconstructive surgery. The 3D printing technique can also be utilized in other areas of oral and maxillofacial surgery. For example, it would be very helpful to be able to design and fabricate a customized non-absorbable barrier of titanium mesh. Results 3D printing is an evolving field.

The head and neck region is rarely involved with extremely rare muscular involvement, this being the first case of intramasseteric SCH. Objectives This report attempts to add this rare case to the pre-existing data along with the review of literature. Methods A clinically and radiographically misdiagnosed case (FNAC, contrast CT, HR USG, angiogram and MRI) of intramasseteric vascular malformation reported with a history of gradual enlargement of the swelling over the past two and a half years, which increased in size in reclined position and regressed in erect position and compression.

The histopathological features suggested ossifying fibroma based on biopsy specimen taken from periphery of the lesion. Deeper tissue/excision biopsy gave the impression of aggressive cementoossifying fibroma. Since the time elapsed for the surgery was short, patient is on regular follow up and radiological monitoring. Conclusions Fibro-osseous lesions of maxillofacial region represents a diverse group of conditions in which the diagnosis is difficult to establish. Lack of standardised terminology and classification of central or intraosseous cement-osseous lesions of the jaws have long posed a dilemma for clinicians. Until 1948 it was believed that fibrous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma were the same entity. Distinguishing the fibro-osseous lesions was an irksome task. Therefore, the case presented in this review had a multi-disciplinary approach; a team of oral pathology and oral radiology apart from the maxillofacial team were involved in the proposition for the final diagnosis and treatment of the lesion. Achieving an accurate final diagnosis is of primordial concern since it will command appropriate therapeutic action. Correlation between the biologic behaviour of the lesion and clinical, radiologic and histopathologic data is essential in reaching an accurate diagnosis.",

Due to its rare incidence, there are few studies focusing on its radiological characteristics. When ameloblastic carcinoma demonstrates an aggressive appearance, it may be diagnosed as a malignant tumor; however, in cases showing a nonaggressive appearance, it is difficult to distinguish ameloblastic carcinoma from ameloblastoma. Clinically, ameloblastic carcinoma is more aggressive than most typical ameloblastomas with extensive local destruction, perforation of the cortical plate, extension into surrounding soft tissues, numerous recurrent lesions, and metastasis, usually to cervical lymph nodes. The radiographic appearance of ameloblastic carcinoma is consistent with that of ameloblastoma except for occasional presence of some focal radiopacities, apparently reflecting dystrophic calcification. Histologically, the tumor cells resemble cells seen in ameloblastoma but show cytologic atypia, cellular pleomorphism, nuclear hyperchromatism, mitoses, and vascular and neural invasion. We report a case of a 44-year old male patient, with a history of swelling over the right mandibular ramus region two years back for which surgical excision was performed and histopathological examination was suggestive of Ameloblastic Carcinoma.

This leads to formation of fibrotic bands that ultimately results in restricted mouth opening (trismus). Burning sensation of the oral mucosa while taking hot or spicy food is the other clinical feature. It primarily affects the buccal mucosa but may involve various parts of the oral cavity and often extends to the pharynx. The disease is predominently found in Indian subcontinents, due to deleterious tobacco chewing habits present in the inhabitants. OSMF can be managed by conservative (intralesional corticosteroids plus oral supplements) or surgical means. However, the conservative management is limited only for mild cases of OSMF. Surgery is indicated for patients with marked limitation of mouth opening.

Even apparently innocuous forms of trauma such as denture-related injury, ulcers, or tooth extraction can overwhelm the reparative capacity of the radiationinjured bone. Traditionally, 3 grades of disease (I, II, III) are recognized. Grade I ORN is the most common presentation. Exposed alveolar bone is observed. Grade II designates ORN that does not respond to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy and requires sequestrectomy/saucerization.

Abstract Background/Introduction Growth factors are protein, which regulates the complex processes of wound healing, main role on Cell migration, Cell proliferation and Angiogenesis in tissue regeneration phase. As first generation of platelet concentrate, platelet rich plasma (PRP) and Platelet rich in growth factor (PRGF) was well known. As second generation of platelet aggregation, Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) but the PRF protocol doesn't need biochemical additives like bovine thrombin and chemical additives as Calcium Chloride to make gel condition, So PRF is free from the concern of cross-contamination. Third generation Early accelerated tissue healing using adult blood derived stem cells (CGF Compared to PRF, CGF is attained by single centrifugation using special centrifuge, results in fibrin rich blocks that are much larger, denser and richer in CGF than common PRF, So better regenerative capacity and higher versatility. In addition CGF doesn't require any chemical or allergenic additives, such as bovine thrombin or anticoagulants, so is free from viral transmission disease.",

Conclusions CGF is an innovative method for producing a fibrin matrix with concentrated growth factors and its clinical applications are presently being investigated. CGF was reported to have a good regenerative capacity and a high versatility on sinus and alveolar ridge augmentation (Sohn et al., 2009) . Similarly to PRF (Dohan Ehrenfest et al., 2009 , 2010 Dohan et al., 2006a, b; Mosesson, 2005) , CGF has a complex tridimensional architecture which makes it a real platelet, leukocyte and growth factor-rich fibrin biomaterial. In particular, the platelets and the dense fibrin network make large clusters of coagulation in the initial millimetres of the membrane beyond the red blood cell base, as confirmed by SEM analysis. The presence of growth factors, such as TGF-b1 and VEGF, is important for stimulating cell proliferation, matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis during healing processes (Grainger et al., 2000 , Intini, 2009 Rodella et al., 2010) . Our data confirmed the presence of TGF-b1 and VEGF in CGF and demonstrate a similar pattern of expression also in RBC layer. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the presence of TGF-b1 and VEGF in CGF and RBC layers, suggesting that improved CGF procedure could optimize the amount of growth factors in the CGF layer or, alternatively, a possible use of RBC layer in clinical applications. Moreover, the presence of CD34 positive cells within the CGF network could lead to investigate their clinical implications.",

This was in addition to extraction of offending tooth/teeth where applicable. The complications recorded were septicaemia, necrotising fascitis, laryngeal spasm and renal failure. Conclusions Ludwig's angina is a life threatening, soft tissue infection of the submandibular, submental and sublingual fascial spaces bilaterally. If vigilant for its clinical presentation and aware of its potential for rapid compromise of the patients airway, clinicians can intervene early in order to prevent its most dire consequences. The classic manifestations of these infections, such as high fever, systemic toxicity, and local signs may be absent due to widespread use of antibiotics and/or profound immune suppression. Their tendency to cause oedema, distortion of fascial spaces and obstruction of airway pose a great challenge for treating physicians and anesthesiologists; airway control is of paramount importance, and attention to this consideration, combined with antibiotic therapy, surgical drainage, and modern intensive care, have all contributed to a declining mortality. Early and liberal consultation with otolaryngology and anesthesiology services will assure the greatest hope for speedy airway control, prompt institution of intravenous antibiotic therapy, and an uncomplicated recovery from this rare and dreaded condition.

Patel Karnavati School of Dentistry, Uvarsad, Gandhinagar, Gujarat Abstract Background/Introduction Maintenance of alveolar bone width and height following tooth loss is essential with regard to the restoration of missing teeth with endosseous dental implants or prosthodontic approach. A various amount of alveolar ridge resorption is likely to occur after tooth extraction at buccal and lingual alveolar bone plates. Alendronate is well known for its potent inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) could serve as a resorbable membrane for guided bone regeneration (GBR), that allows the migration of osteogenic and angiogenic cells and permits the underlying blood clot to mineralize. Objectives objective of this study is to compare and evaluate the synergistic effect of alendronate and PRF in to extraction socket. Methods Twenty patients with age between 25 and 65 years were selected from the out patient department of Oral and maxillofacial department, Karnavati school of dentistry. The patients were divided into two groups: 10 patients in each group. In 1 group after the extraction of teeth from molars to midline the sockets were irrigated with saline and sutured on right side, on left side PRF was placed and sutured. In the other group the right side was treated the same way after extraction as in first group where as in the left side sockets PRF soaked in 20mg/ml alendronate was placed and sutured. Patients were evaluated: clinically for any local irritation, socket closure, swelling and pain; Radiologically with orthopantomograph or IOPA X-rays were taken immediately after the extraction, 1 month after extraction and 3 months after extraction to determine the amount of bone loss prevented.",

Voltaire Peripheral nerve damage associated with third molar extraction is almost exclusively reported as a somatosensory change (primarily involving touch), but studies on chemogustatory changes are minimal or less documented. Objectives 1. To evaluate changes in gustatory sensations with Claussen's 5-Komponent-Chemo-Gustometry. 2. To establish a statistical corelation between type of impaction, Pederson's difficulty index score and incidence of suprathreshold taste change. Methods A total of 60 subjects were included in the study. Chemogustatory evaluation was perfomed pre and postoperatively by dividing the subjects into group 1 (difficulty index score 3-4), group 2 (difficulty index score 5-6) and group 3 (difficulty index score 7-8). The contralateral side of the included patient was considered as control. Five variant chemical stimuli with three differential concentrations were used: -Sweet-glucose in solution -Salty-sodium chloride solutions -Sour-citric acid -Bitter-quinine solution -Bitter-phenylthiourea. Results Group 3 subjects showed higher incidence of increase in taste threshold with statistical significant P value of 0.001. -Salty and sour taste have more predilection for increased taste threshold. Conclusions Suprathreshold taste changes occur after surgical removal of an impacted mandibular third molar with high difficulty index score. These deficits maybe the result of nerve compression, laceration or stretch, but get resolved within three months. Increased awareness of these complications will allow the practitioner to effectively communicate with patients prior to the surgical procedure. ",

Abstract Background/Introduction Implant dentistry has evolved into the main stream of restorative practices all over the world. When performing an implant surgery it is crucial to place implants in optimal position as on prosthetic rehabilitation plan. A surgical stent is essential for correct placement of implant during surgery, even with surgical stent the implant placement is not always as intended as there are iatrogenic errors. To eliminate such discrepancies, an extra component with the surgical stent has been designed at the same time, an attempt is made to access the bone width using a Intraoral radiographic horizontal and vertical positioner.",

To rehabilitate these minuses, techniques have been improved over time. Since 1990 growth factors, platelet concentrates, biomaterials, scaffolds and autologous tissues serve these purposes in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The frontier of regenerative medicine is represented by the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). With increasingly sophisticated technology to support MSCs manipulation, they are undoubtedly the future of regenerative medicine and they are showing perceptives unimaginable just a few years ago. Oral cavity turned out to be an important source of MSCs with the advantage to be easily accessible to the surgeon thus avoiding to increase the morbidity of the patient.",

            "text": "Abstract Background/Introduction Transplantation is defined as the transfer (engraftment) of human cells, tissues or organs from a donor to recipient with an aim of restoring function(s) in the body. On December 23rd, 1954, the first organ transplantation was carried out in the history of surgery and it is one of the most important findings in the field of transplantation. A kidney was transplanted between two identical twin brothers Richard & Ronald Herrick by Dr. Joseph Hume at Brighton, Birmingham for which the operating surgeon received the noble prize. Since then we have come a long way to reach our present state. But in almost every country the number of willing organ donors falls short of the number of people on the waiting list by many thousands. Asian countries in particular have significant disparity between the number of waiting organ recipients and willing organ donors. The main reason for this disparity is the non-willingness of individuals for organ donation. Many factors must be taken into account when studying the knowledge and attitudes of people towards organ donation. A variety of factors influence these attitudes towards organ donation and these factors vary greatly with geographic location, education level and other factors. As health care personnel we remain one of the most reliable sources for general population to get information about a relatively safe procedure. But, before we impart knowledge, we ourselves must be thoroughly informed about organ donation. Basic information on procedures, pros and cons and the ethical issues involving organ donation should be included in the dental and medical undergraduate curriculum, so that future doctors can become informed advocates. dental students and the staff members from the dental college. From the medical college, samples were collected from the undergraduate students and the staff members. Anonymity and confidentiality of respondents were maintained and participation was voluntary. A 39 item self-administered questionnaire was developed based on previous studies (2, 5, (7) (8) (9) (10) . The questionnaire comprised of four sections. The first section of the questionnaire gathered the demographic details from the students, which included age, gender, year of study, religion and parents education level. The remaining three sections consisted of questions to judge the knowledge, attitude and practices of the individuals towards organ donation. Some questions were based on the dichotomous scale whereas other questions were based on a four point likert scale. After obtaining permission from the higher authorities the questionnaires were distributed to the students during lecture classes. The participants were instructed not to discuss with one another to avoid the possibility of a bias or a confounding factor. Only questionnaires which were fully completed were included in the study. Once the questionnaires were completed the data was compiled into a = 117) , 29. 4 % were 18 years of age (n = 182), 9 % were 19 years of age (9.0 %), 12. 6 % were 20 years of age (n = 78), 16. 3 % were 21 years of age (n = 101), 9. 9 % were 22 years of age (n = 61), 2. 6 % were 23 years of age (n = 16) and 1. 4 % were 24 years of age and above (n = 8).",

This prepares the alveolar bone volume both vertically and laterally for the implant to be placed. Bone harvested from the mandibular symphysis is mainly cortical in nature, allowing application of rigid fixation in situ and thus providing good primary stability. These grafts can be easily carved to intimately fill in defects and provide good alveolar contour. In our case we have used chin graft in the region of 11, 12 and the result has been very good.",

Numerous methods are illustrated in the literature to produce profound regional anaesthesia and selection of the specific technique is determined, in large part, by the nature of the treatment to be provided. Complete maxillary nerve block is not commonly required because they are believed to be difficult and may be associated with complications. Literature review suggests that an extra oral technique to anesthetise the maxillary nerve via the suprazygomatic approach is more safe and efficacious. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of extra oral maxillary nerve block through suprazygomatic approach from frontozygomatic angle in patients undergoing isolated zygomatic arch fracture reduction. Objectives 1. To assess the pain during zygomatic arch fracture reduction by VAS scale. 2. To assess the time required for the onset of anesthesia (subjective symptoms). 3.

Methods the case with diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was selected and treated by cryotherapy with ablation nerve branch, and patient was followed on regular interval. Results the patient was followed for long period and was asymptomatic. Conclusions cryotherapy is an important asset in treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. It is a very simple, reversible, reliable and repeatable procedure with no mortality and with a negligible and transient morbidity. Abstract Background/Introduction Alveolar ridge resorption is inevitable in all post extraction cases. Retaining its shape & size is needed for prosthetic rehabilitation in aesthetic and functional position. It can be achieved by ridge preservation through modified extraction technique and use of autogenic or allogenic graft materials. Autogenous bone graft is still considered the gold standard, in spite of the need for harvesting bone and possible surgical morbidity. Objectives It is well-know that jawbones, alveolar bone, and teeth develop from cells of the neural crest and many proteins are common in formation of bone, dentin, and cementum. Dentin and bone having same biochemical similarities led to the idea of using it as a bone regeneration material. In this graft dentin, which comprises more than 85% of hydroxyapatite, can serve as native bone grafting material. Recently, several studies have reported that extracted teeth, which undergo a process of cleaning, grinding, demineralization, and sterilization, can be a very effective bone graft to fill alveolar bone defects. Methods A total of 4 graft sites in 2 patients were included in this study. A alveolar bone augmentation immediately after dental extraction.

If a bleeding point is localised then chemical or electrocautery is performed. If unsuccessful further management takes a stepwise approach; initially anterior packing with medicated gauze or sponge and if unsuccessful, more advanced techniques such as compressive balloons or posterior nasal packing may be used.

            "text": "Abstract Background/Introduction Quantum dots (QDs) were developed on the interdisciplinary advancement of nanotechnology, chemistry, and optics. The unique optical properties of QDs have shown promising prospects in the personalized surgical treatment for cancer patients. QDs are nanocrystals (with a diameter of 2-10 nm) composed of elements belonging to group II-IV or group III-V. Compared with traditional fluorescence markers, QDs have narrow emission spectrum, wide excitation spectrum, high intensity of fluorescence, and good photochemical stability due to the quantum size and dielectric confinement effects. In addition, any emission spectrum from ultraviolet to nearinfrared (or from blue to red) under the same excitation wavelength of light can be obtained by changing the particle size of QDs. These optical characteristics of QDs are not possessed by any of the current fluorescent probes, including a variety of organic fluorescent dyes and fluorescent proteins. Particularly, the fluorescence of recently developed QDs with an emission of near-infrared wavelength from 700 nm to 900 nm has strong penetration in human tissues, which is extremely suitable for visible in-vivo medical imaging. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common oral cancers. Because most oral cancers are diagnosed and treated at an advanced stage, the overall 5-year survival rate is only 50-60% presently. It has been reported that the 5-year survival rate for patients of oral cancers that are diagnosed and treated at an early stage is over 80%. Thus, early diagnosis is vital to improve patient quality of life and survival rate. Recent research has demonstrated that surface-modified QDs conjugated with membrane-penetrating polypeptides can be used in labelling various types of cells, not only rapidly and efficiently but also with no damage to the live cells. Fluorescent probes have been developed by conjugating QDs with target molecules (eg. antibodies and peptides) and have been used for in-vivo visualization of cancer cells and tumour angiogenesis, sentinel lymph node detection, and imaging of drug targeting studies. These studies have demonstrated that excellent optical properties of QDs have promising prospects in visualization of cancer development and personalized therapies.",

Quantum dot-based visual in vivo imaging for oral squamous cell carcinoma in mice: The use of conjugate membrane-penetrating polypeptide-conjugated near-infrared quantum dots to label oral squamous carcinoma BcaCD885 cells through endocytosis (Qtracker QD800, Invitrogen, CA, USA). The maximum emission wavelength of the QDs is 800 nm, and a custom peptide is used to deliver QDs into the cytoplasm of live cells with no cell-type specificity. Qtracker QD800-labelled BcaCD885 cells (BcaCD885/QD800) were implanted into nude mice for in vivo imaging and the sensitivity and dynamic imaging conditions of Qtracker QD800 were investigated as a visual in vivo detection modality for BcaCD885 cells.

We then observed the proliferation, adherence and chemotaxis of the QD800-labeled Tca8003 cells. These results provided theoretical bases to reveal if the visualized tumour cells labelled by peptide-conjugated near-infrared fluorescent QDs reflected the actual genesis, development, infiltration and metastasis of tumours in vivo.

In-vivo imaging of oral squamous cell carcinoma by EGFR monoclonal antibody conjugated near-infrared quantum dots in mice: Quantum dots with an emission wavelength of 800 nm (QD800) were conjugated to monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, resulting in the probe designated as QD800-EGFR Ab. OSCC cell line (BcaCD885) expressing high levels of EGFR was transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice cheeks to develop an OSCC animal model.

The minimum detectable counts of BcaCD885 cells for QD800-based in vivo imaging were 1-104 in the dorsum subcutaneous, back muscle and under the cheek oral mucosa. As tissue depth increased, the detectable fluorescence intensity dropped; as cell counts increased, the fluorescence intensity and the visual image duration also increased, especially for the QD800-labeled BcaCD885 cells in which counts of 1-106 were visual imaged in the dorsum subcutaneous, back muscle and under the cheek oral mucosa for 16 days. Yang K, Li Z, Cao Y, Yu X, Mei J, et al.

The results showed that there was no significant difference between the results of Tca8113 cells labelled with NIRF-QD800 and those of unlabeled Tca8113 cells, suggesting that the proliferation, invasion, adherence and chemotaxis of Tca8113 cells were not affected by NIRF-QD800.

In-vivo imaging of oral squamous cell carcinoma by EGFR monoclonal antibody conjugated near-infrared quantum dots in mice In-vivo imaging and immune-histochemical examination of the tumours showed that intravenously injected QD800-EGFR Ab probe could bind EGFR expressed on BcaCD885 cells. Fluorescence signals of BcaCD885 cells labelled with QD800-EGFR Ab probe could be clearly detected, and these fluorescence signals lasted for 24 hours. The most complete tumour images with maximal signal-tonoise ratio were observed from 15 minutes to 6 hours after injection of the probe.

            "text": "The early detection of cancer is one of the key factors for cancer treatment. Currently, the methods with good sensitivity for early detection of cancer, such as CT and MRI, can only detect tumours consisting of millions of cells. As for BcaCD885/QD800 used by Yang et al., injection points in the dorsum subcutaneous, dorsum muscle and under the cheek oral mucosa were fluorescently detectable with as little as 1-104 cells. This finding suggested that QD800-based imaging, compared with traditional CT and MRI, increased the sensitivity of the early diagnosis of cancer by more than 100-fold. Gao et al. forecast that near-infrared QD-labeled cells would improve the sensitivity of detection to 10-100 cells with the development of stronger tissue-penetrating near-infrared QDs. At the same time, the QD800-based imaging methods are simple, safe, lowcost, easy-to-use and particularly suitable for direct visualization of cancer cells in surgery. At present, clinicians lack the visual screening method for the carcinoma edges during surgery and thus they can only define the tumour boundaries by palpation and experience, resulting in residual cancer cells around the carcinoma edges in up to 40% of patients with head and neck cancers, which greatly affects the survival rate of patients. It's believed that with the development of quantum dot imaging technology, clinicians can make accurate visual identification on the carcinoma edges, the residual cancer cells and the lymph node metastasis of cancer cells in operation, with the aids of a conventional imaging device and a pocket sized near-infrared excitation light source and receiver, so as to achieve a real treatment tailored to the individual surgery.

The surgeon needs access to an unobstructed field and, in most instances, maxillomandibular fixation is required intraoperatively for adequate reconstruction of facial fractures. Presence of fracture of the base of the skull& Comminuted midfacial fractures cause physical obstruction to the passage of nasotracheal tube. Surgical reconstruction often involves maxillo-mandibular fixation in the intraoperative period to restore the patient's dental occlusion. This precludes the use of oral endotracheal intubation. Tracheostomy may involve a significant risk of iatrogenic complications, such as tracheal stenosis, internal emphysema, damage to the laryngeal nerves, tracheoesophageal fistula and scarring A useful alternative method of managing the airway intraoperatively is by submental endotracheal intubation, which allows tracheal intubation by passing the tube through the floor of the mouth. First reported by Francisco Hernandez Altemir in 1986 as a procedure that could avoid tracheostomy and allow for the concomitant restoration of occlusion and reduction of facial fractures in patients ineligible for nasoendotracheal intubation.",

Followed by blunt dissection was done through the subcutaneous fat, platysma, investing layer of deep cervical fascia, anterior bellies of digastric, geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles. Mouth opening was maintained using a gag or dental prop and the tongue was retracted, exposing the floor of the mouth. Pair of medium-sized artery forceps was introduced into the submental incision, until the tip of the artery forceps tented the mucosa of the floor of the mouth. Then tented oral mucosa was incised to see the tip of the artery forceps into the oral cavity taking care to avoid damage to the sublingual and submandibular duct and lingual nerve. Blades of the artery forceps were separated to a distance equal to the diameter of the tube. Pilot tube was grasped by the artery forceps and pulled through the passage in the floor of the mouth. Patient's lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen for five minutes. Then tip of the artery forceps was quickly re-inserted through the submental incision. The tracheal tube was briefly disconnected from the breathing circuit and the universal connector was removed. Then the end of tracheal tube was grasped and pulled out in the oral-to-skin direction. The connector was re-attached, the cuff reinflated and the tracheal tube reconnected to the breathing circuit. The position of the tracheal tube was checked using capnography and chest auscultation.

Abstract Background/Introduction Haptics, a term that was derived from the Greek word ''haptesthai'' meaning ''pertaining to the sense of touch'' which is added to present virtual reality technology which provides a true 3D experience for maxillofacial surgeons. Methods ''In virtual reality surgeons interacts with two dimensional sensory modalities that is visual and auditory but in advanced virtual reality of haptic technology adds third dimension by recreating the sense of touch through applying forces, vibrations or motions to the user along with visual and audio aids. Since 2013 research focused on tactile interaction with holograms and distant objects by adding haptic feedback, which is successfully applied in advancements in medical, surgical, educational and other industries. Haptic technology provides tactile and resistance feedback to surgeons, as they makes an incision they feel ligaments, manipulating fracture segments, contouring bone grafts as if working directly on the patient. Haptic technology simulate operations and allow surgeons for precise preoperative planning especially in maxillofacial trauma, oncosurgery, orthognathic surgeries, palpating myofacial trigger points and also helps to simulate surgery for training purposes for surgical students to practice and train more. Methods An Oral and Maxillofacial surgeon (OMFS) is highly likely to face plethora of medico legal cases (MLC) in day to day practice. However there are vast lacunae in recording, analysing and understanding of the correct method of dealing with such cases. Medical jurisprudence is interesting and serious. Correct interpretation of an injury in MLC needs utmost level of objectivity, observation skill, analytical ability and integrity. The OMFS should have an understanding of the law and legal system and can be a good witness in deciding true justice. However practitioners get anxious and apprehensive as they have to interact with individuals and systems outside the normal realm of practice. In today's arena, it is of utmost importance to be aware of legal system and law of particular country. The OMFS needs to have thorough understanding in recording and maintenance of the details of all MLCs and should have through knowledge of presenting the same in court. Professional guidelines for expert witness are often not well recognised as those relating to the clinical practice. This presentation provides a bird's eye view into the details of registration of MLC, examination and recording of injuries, collecting medicolegal evidences and writing a medico legal report. Also it highlights the court proceedings and possible questions that may be faced by the surgeon in the court.",

However, the etiology has to be ascertained for definitive treatment. Only after a systematic and careful evaluation can a treating surgeon be aware of the underlying cause. Though dental causes predominate in the diagnosis of orofacial pain, the rare cause of facial pain have to be excluded, which would prevent unnecessary and fruitless dental treatment. Pain is the most frequent cause of suffering and disability. Misdiagnosis and multiple failed treatments are common in some patient population. Patients with orofacial pain frequently undergo numerous dental procedures that fail to eliminate symptoms, and are often referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon for evaluation and treatment. Facial pain can be the presenting, and sometimes the only, complaint of many disorders that originate from cranial structures. Patients with pharyngodynia, neck, and facial pain can lead to an extensive differential diagnosis. Vague orofacial pain associated with elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament has been known as Eagle syndrome may be taken in account. American otorhinolaryngologist Watt Weems Eagle in 1937 defined ''stylalgia'' as an autonomous entity related to abnormal length of the styloid process or to mineralization of the stylohyoid ligament complex.

In recent time procedures like PET, SPECT, lymph node scintigraphy /sentinel lymph node has made nuclear medicine as adjunct in modern diagnostic arena and justifies its use in dental disease as well. Nuclear medicine utilizes the accumulating action of radioisotopes in cells and so after injecting them, with a help of a specialized gamma camera images are taken at a certain time interval to detect distribution and quantification of isotopes and hence metabolic activity. Head and neck tumors, salivary gland disease, and various metabolic as well as infectious processes of the head and neck region are the areas where radio isotopic scanning can be used in oral and maxillofacial disorders. Plain films radiographs, CT scan and MRI scan are able to provide good soft and hard tissue imaging only when morphological change have occurred but nuclear scanning precede them in diagnosis by detecting metabolic changes earlier than to be seen as morphological changes. With all these observations a dentist must be aware of this specialty and discussion and emphasis should be laid on this for a successful diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

            "text": "To provide an overview of modern nuclear medicine and exemplify its application in the diagnosis and treatment of oral and maxillofacial diseases. Methods Bone Scanning Bone scan uses a radiopharmaceutical technetium-99m labeled with diphosphonates having half-life of six hours and emission of 140kev gamma energy. Since the adsorption of diphosphonates to hydroxyapaptite is 40 times more than organic matrix its uptake correlates with degree of mineralization. Areas of increase uptake is called 'hot spot' whereas areas of decrease uptake is called 'cold spot'. Lesions resulting from radiation treatment, local vascular compromise, prosthetic joint, early osteomyelitis, multiple myeloma, and avascular necrosis which causes area of decrease uptake or cold spot is also seen on bone scan. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the radiopharmaceutical most commonly used in PET scanning. FDG is a glucose analog that is transported into cells and phosphorylated like glucose, but the metabolism stops at this point and the phosphorylated FDG becomes trapped in the cell and starts to accumulate. Most tumors, with a more rapid growth rate, have an increased rate of glucose use due to an increased rate of glycolysis compared to normal tissue or scar tissue. Consequently, FDG preferentially accumulates in tumor cells and demonstrates an increased uptake especially in poorly differentiated tumors. The accumulated FDG is detectable to the PET camera. Lymphoscintigraphy Technetium 99m sulfur-colloid is injected in four to six subcutaneous sites around the neoplastic lesion. The radioactive colloid will be carried away in the lymphatic channels to the first echelon lymph node draining that area, the so-called sentinel node. The sentinel node is felt to be the best predictor of nodal spread of the tumor. The pattern of lymphatic spread and the sentinel node can then be imaged using a gamma camera. One to two hours later, in the operating room, the surgeon using a hand held gamma counter is able to localize the node and remove it. Salivary Gland Studies The major salivary glands with a functioning parenchyma have the ability to take up technetium 99m pertechnetate in sufficient quantities to be imaged, since the Te99 mimics chloride influx into the acinar cells. Scintigraphy involves administering a radioactive tracer with an affinity for the organ or tissue of interest; the distribution of the radioactivity is then recorded with a scintillation camera. SPECT It is an extension of conventional bone scan as it utilizes tomographic technology to provide 3-dimensional images (axial, coronal and sagittal) which thereby facilitates more accurate interpretation and better localization of bone pathology, Results Bone scanning (Dale, Baur et al.) Bone scans can be used to diagnose and differentiate osteomyelitis from cellulitis, as well as detect primary and metastatic malignant disease. They can also be used to assess the vascularity of bone grafts and contribute to the diagnosis of various metabolic bone diseases such as fibrous dysplasia, Paget's disease, TMJ osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is important to keep in mind a bone scan can detect 10-15% mineral loss, while standard radiographs will only visualize a bony defect after 35-50% mineral loss. Overall the scan has a high sensitivity but low specificity, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Dale, Baur et al.) PET can be used to assess the response of a tumor to treatment, diagnose recurrence, detect residual disease, or detect distant unknown metastases. PET scanning is helpful in evaluating a neck mass or evaluating a neck without palpable adenopathy (staged as a N0 neck) in oral squamous cell carcinoma. PET is especially useful when trying to localize an occult primary tumor. PET has not shown any usefulness in pre-operative evaluation of salivary gland neoplasms. In OSCCA, there has been a great deal of interest in using PET to evaluate the clinically N0 neck for occult or micrometastasis before any changes are visible on CT or MRI. False positives can also occur in conditions such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Overall, while the sensitivity can be lacking, the specificity is high. Lymphoscintigraphy (Goyal, Khanna, et al.) Sentinel node mapping is a technique which uses the property of carcinomas to spread via lymphatics. Sentinel node is first draining node of a particular anatomical area. In carcinomas, sentinel node is primary node carrying metastatic cells via lymphatics which further drain into subsequent nodes. If sentinel node is diagnosed to be involved then chances of lymphatic spread to other nodes is present. It prevents unnecessary surgical intervention if sentinel node is found to be negative for metastases. Salivary Gland Studies (Dale, Baur et al.) Scintigraphy of these glands is used for functional evaluation and evaluating mass lesions. Mass lesions in a gland usually present as areas of decreased uptake, with the notable exception of Wharthin's tumor and oncocytomas which demonstrate increased uptake and decreased washout time. Patients with Sjogren's Syndrome may have poor uptake of the radiopharmaceutical and poor response to stimulation. Acute inflammation of the glands usually demonstrates increased uptake and increased washout, whereas chronic inflammation shows decreased uptake. SPECT Various uses of SPECT includes assess the mandibular invasion of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) determining in the therapeutic course in patients with asymmetrical mandibular condylar hyperplasia and to assess the osseous integration process of dental implants.

To avoid and overcome these disadvantages, bone substitutes are under development as an alternative to autogenous bone. Dentin and bone having same biochemical similarities led to the idea of using it as a bone regenerative material. Objectives This poster discusses the development and clinical use of demineralized dentin matrix (DDM) produced from the patient's own extracted teeth, to repair alveolar bone defects. Methods Both vital and non vital extracted teeth after removal of soft tissue and callus, where rinsed twice in phosphate buffered saline. The teeth was then crushed in a dentin grinder, the resultant particle were washed in 1. oM sodium chloride and partially demineralised for sometime. This was then mixed with PRF and used as grafts.",

            "text": "Intermaxillary fixation [tying/alignment of upper and lower teeth together in a prespecified position (satisfactory dental occlusion/maximum intercuspation)] is one of the treatment modalities employed in the management of facial jaw fractures since times immemorial. It has also been used to orient the upper (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible) in various other surgical procedures such as orthognathic surgery, tumor/cancer resection surgery etc. There are various ways of achieving intermaxillary fixation (IMF) mentioned in the literature viz., Gilmer's wiring, Risdon's wiring, arch bar wiring, Ivy eyelet wiring, intermaxillary fixation screws, orthodontic brackets, bracket bars bonded to the teeth, adhesive cast and thermoforming splints, buttons or beads and wires, Dimac wires, Rapid IMF etc. The technique mentioned here is novel, innovative and has bare minimum disadvantages as compared to all the previous techniques. Technique: A pre-specified 26 gauge Stainless Steel wire of 6 inches/ 15cm length is stretched and straightened to release the inner stresses. Wiring involves one corresponding tooth on each side (right and left), in both upper and lower arches, say 2 nd premolar and/or central incisor. For demonstration purposes, we use artificial dental models and consider 2 nd premolar of left upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) arch. Both ends of the straightened wire are passed from buccal (outer) to palatal (inner) side through the mesial and distal interdental spaces (as shown in photograph no. 1). Now the wire that was passed from the mesial interdental space of maxillary left 2 nd premolar should be directed through the distal interdental space of mandibular left 2 nd premolar while coming out from lingual (inside) to the buccal (outside) and the wire that was passed through the distal interdental space of maxillary left 2 nd premolar was brought buccally (outside) from the lingual (inside) side through the mesial interdental space of mandibular left 2 nd premolar (as shown in photograph no. 2).",

Reconstruction of the hollowing defect after parotidectomy becomes essential part of the surgery now days. The percentage of Frey's syndrome (FS) postoperatively [1] was between 12.5 to 62%. FS and contour deformity (CD) significantly reduces a quality of life of the patient [2] . Many space filling techniques to prevent CD and FS have been documented in the literature after parotidectomy. They are Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle flap, Platysma muscle flap (PMF), Temporoparietal fascia (TPF), Superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), Buccal fat pad (BFP). Non-vascularized tissues such as dermal fat graft, fat injections at subdermal layer, acellular dermal allograft and artificial material such as ethisorb or gore-tex [3] . SCM muscle flap creates a hollow deformity of the upper neck at the donor site, especially in thin and young patients. When large inferiorly based flap was raised and when the patient turns his or her head away from the donor side it becomes more obvious (Fig. 1 ) [4] . PMF is very thin and required expertise. All other techniques required another incision or dissection which increases post-operative discomfort of the patients. To eliminate all these complications, we recommended posterior belly of digastric muscle (PBDM) flap ( Fig. 2) after superficial parotidectomy to prevent CD and FS. We have used this technique successfully in 5 patients without any complications. After identification of facial nerve trunk, the conventional anterograde nerve dissection was carried out carefully followed by superficial parotidectomy. The digastric tendon was incised at the greater cornu of the hyoid bone (Fig. 3 ) and the flap was reflected easily. The PBDM was sutured to the remaining dense fascia of the parotid bed and tendon was sutured in the pre auricular area just above the auriculotemporal nerve course to prevent FS post-operatively (Fig. 4) . Advantages of PBDM PBDM originates from the mastoid notch lies between the mastoid and styloid process, very close to the stylomastoid foramen and inserted on the digastric tendon. It is considered by many as a landmark to identify the facial nerve [5] . It is encountered during the surgery and that's why easy to dissect. No extra incision or dissection required. The branch of occipital artery which supplies the muscle was preserved. It can be easily used without any complications in young patients and patients with thin neck. There was no donor site morbidity and no post-operative contour deformity was noticed. Excellent postoperative results were noticed after reconstruction with PBDM flap (Figs. 5, 6 ). Disadvantage PBDM is short in comparison to other flaps but eliminates all the drawbacks of other flaps mentioned above. In conclusion, we present an innovative and simple method of PBDM transposition to eliminate the CD after superficial Parotidectomy.",

In Maxillofacial Trauma, the evolving trends have shown a steady paradigm shift towards minimally invasive procedures when approaching facial fractures from the extra-oral approach. The aim of these minimally invasive procedures has been to achieve restoration of original form and function without compromising the aesthetic outcome. Conventional surgical approaches to the central midface describe incisions which allow for proper visualisation of the fracture fragments to aid in their reduction and fixation. The attachment of the medial canthal ligament to the NOE Complex and its disruption during the fracture play a vital role in the treatment planning and surgical intervention. Markowitz Type 1 and Type 2NOE fractures can be unilateral or bilateral and are characterized by the medial canthal ligament being attached to a bone fragment which may or may not have significant displacement. The innovative novel approach of transcutaneo-periosteal plates (TCPP system) was conceptualized by the authors as a minimalistic but effective design template to aid in anatomic reduction and dynamic fixation without the need for placing an incision in the treatment of Markowitz Type 1 & 2 fractures of the NOE complex fractures. The dynamic fixation refers to the fixation principle which allows for real time manipulation of the template by digital compression in the postoperative period allowing for the moulding of the NOE Complex into its desired form and function. A detailed clinical study of the versatility and viability of the TCCP System was undertaken as a one year fellowship scientific study by the author during his one year AOMSI fellowship in Cranio-Maxillofacial Trauma at a Tier 1 Trauma Centre.",

            "text": "Abstract This paper describes the technique of performing gap Arthroplasty in Temporomandibular Joint Ankylosis (TMJA) by transoral access. Treatment of TMJA by creating an adequate gap is paramount in preventing any future recurrence and this can be achieved only when good access is gained to this complex anatomical joint. Five patients with eight TMJA were treated by gap arthroplasty using intraoral approach. The average mouth opening before surgery was 8.6mm and an average mouth opening achieved post surgery was 37.9mm. The average follow up time was 9 months and none of the patient had any recurrence or significant complications during or after surgery. Our technique relies on using a stable landmark to trace the superior most extent of the Ankylotic mass and thereby facilitate in removing the entire mass including the medial extent. We found that even though transoral access is technically challenging and took an average time of 84 minutes, it has many advantages over conventional extra oral approaches in terms of facial scar or facial nerve injuries. Authors also emphasise on the importance of good post operative physiotherapy and pre surgical patient counselling to prevent future recurrence. Transoral Gap arthroplasty for Temporo Mandibular Joint Ankylosis Temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) is a common condition in India. In spite of attempts to prevent its incidence by timely and appropriate management of mandibular condyle fractures in both pediatric and adult populations, it is still seen quite rampantly. Ankylosis of temporomandibular joint is an extremely debilitating condition especially when it affects the joint in its growing stages. Apart from causing severe facial disfigurement, it also alters the patients eating habits and speech ability. It aggravates psychological stress, prevents the patient from maintaining good oral hygiene resulting in dental decay, loss of multiple teeth and hampers the quality of life 1. Treatment of ankylosis is often challenging and many surgical techniques have been reported in the literature. Since the times of Esmarch, 1851 who was credited with performing first ever osteotomy for ankylosis to the times of Abbe (1880) and Risdon (1934) , who introduced the concepts of gap arthroplasty and interpositional arthroplasty respectively, to today's times, the debate still rages on, on the choice of ideal treatment 2, 3. Kaban and et al. 4 outlined the protocol for management of TMJA in 1990 which is universally followed and was later modified by the same author 5 in 2009. Accessing the temporomandibular apparatus or the ankylotic mass, by choosing from myriad of extra oral incisions and techniques so far reported, had always been an impending challenge to the surgeon in terms of i) gaining adequate visibility, ii) minimizing facial scar, iii) negotiating facial nerve and auriculotemporal nerves to prevent their injuries, iv) to reduce intra-operative and postoperative hemorrhage, v) occasional anatomic deformity of the ear vi) surgical infection vii) salivary fistula and sialocele 6. Many authors tried to circumvent these complications approaching the joint trans orally. However, E. C. Ko and S. Lai 7 in 2009 were the first and only authors to report transoral access for the treatment of TMJA. In this article we report our experiences with transoral access to the TMJA and describe our surgical technique which differs from that of E. C. KO et al on certain important aspect.",

            "text": "Eight TMJA in a series of 5 patients were operated for gap arthroplasty transorally between February 2012 and August 2013. The average age of the patient at the time of surgery was 14.4 yrs and none of them were recurrent cases. Two of the patients had Sawhney's class I type of ankylosis and three of them had type II ankylosis. The average mouth opening at the time of surgery was 8.6mm with the lowest being 4mm and the highest 14mm. All patients had history of trauma to the mandible with two of them reporting with history of prolonged Maxillomandibular fixation. Follow up ranged from 3 months to 20 months with mean follow up of 9 months. No interpositioning material or substance was used in any of the cases. Physiotherapy and mouth opening exercises were started on 1st post operative day with increasing intensity towards the 7th day. Patients were generally discharged on 3rd post operative day and reviewed once a week for the first month and once a month for the rest of follow up period. Condylar reconstruction is contemplated after one year of ankylosis free period and this is achieved using ramus distractors. (Table 1) . Surgical Technique Nasotracheal intubation was done to administer anaesthesia on all five patients with the aid of blind awake technique. Following this, the incision site was infiltrated with 10 cc of lignocaine and adrenaline of 1: 200000 concentrations. With adequate retraction, mucosal incision was made along the external oblique ridge beginning from mandibular 1st molar, posteriorly along the anterior border of ramus. Mucoperiosteal flap was raised on lateral and medial surface of mandible down to the angle region and superiorly until the inserting fibers of temporalis muscle were visualized. They were incised and retracted upwards with the aid of forked ramus retractor almost till the tip of coronoid. A malleable retractor is then placed at the inner aspect of the ramus to protect the internal maxillary artery that lies immediately deep to the condylar neck and the channel retractor moved upwards for better access to the ankylosed area. An osteotomy was performed at the base of coronoid process running obliquely upwards towards the sigmoid notch. The osteotomy was completed with the aid of osteotomes and the coronoid was retrieved transorally after detaching the remaining fibers of temporalis. Once the coronoid was out, an attempt was made to increase the mouth opening with the aid of Hiesters mouth opener. In bilateral ankylosis, the same was attempted after completing coronoidectomy on both the sides. It was observed that mouth opening improved by an average of 3 mm after unilateral coronoidectomy and 5mm after bilateral resections. A mouth prop was placed interocclusally on the contra lateral side to maintain the mouth opening. The dissection was carried out superiorly towards the zygomatic arch and once it was identified, a periosteal incision was made at its inferior border and subperiosteal dissection was carried out along the arch posteriorly to trace the anterior and superior extent of the ankylotic mass and glenoid fossa. Once the superior extent of the ankylotic mass was delineated, an osteotome or surgical bur was used to separate it from the glenoid fossa. Another osteotomy was initiated at about 1.5 cm below the previous one to create an adequate gap.

In bilateral cases, the similar procedure was repeated on the opposite side. After release the mandible was vigorously opened and mobilized to release any leftover fibrous union.

            "text": "The ultimate goals of treating TMJA is to restore mouth opening to at least 35 mm, prevent any further recurrence and to restore as near normal ramal height as possible either by reconstruction or by distraction osteogenesis. To achieve these goals, the foremost important thing is to gain a good access to the joint area which helps in adequate resection of the ankylotic mass. The variety of incisions and techniques described in the published data on approaches to the condyle 8, reflects the complexity of the anatomy of this region and the importance of preservation of vital structures in the pathway. The classical pre auricular approach described by Blair 9 , Dingman 10 and the modified versions of Al-Kayat, Bramley 11 and popowich 12 carry the risk of injuring peripheral branches of facial nerve and an unsightly scar on the face. The post auricular incision described by Alexander 13 gives the best cosmetic result as it is hidden in the post auricular crease. Injuries to the facial nerve are minimal with this approach but in cases of massive ankylosis, it might be difficult to reach the anterior extent of the ankylotic mass and also could result in residual ear deformity or auricular stenosis. Vishal Bansal et al. 6 in comparing the pre auricular approach with post auricular in 30 joints with TMJA have outlined many benefits of this approach but also suggested that this approach might lead to more intra operative hemorrhage and the prolonged time to expose the joint as chief disadvantages. Politi et al. 14 proposed a surgical technique called ''deep subfascial approach'', in which they claimed no transient or permanent facial nerve injury by developing an additional protective fascial layer when the dissection was performed deep to the deep temporalis fascia. The bicoronal approach flap described by Pogrel et al. 15 , in bilateral ankylosis cases carries no special advantage over two separate bilateral preauricular incisions with temporal extensions. In our view it has additional burden of more blood loss, longer duration and has no advantage of wider exposure and access to the ankylosed mass as compared to the conventional pre auricular approach.",

            "text": "Although many authors 16, 17 in the past have described intra oral approach to the condyles, to treat various problems related to it, it was E. C. Ko et al 7 who first published this technique to treat TMJA. We observed similar advantages and disadvantages with our technique as described by Ko et al which are, absence of facial scar, less possibility of injuring the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerves, no sialocele, simultaneous coronoidectomy via the same incision, ability to protect internal maxillary artery by placing a retractor on medial surface of ramus and thus reducing chances of hemorrhage. The disadvantages with this technique like, limited surgical field, the requirement to have a good sense of orientation and the limitations regarding the selection of interpositional material are also agreed upon. We differ from Ko et al in terms of surgical technique, in which they advocate retaining the superior part of the ankylotic mass without any attempt at removing it to prevent possible risk of middle cranial fossa perforation. Salins 3 clearly reiterated the importance of complete excision of ankylotic mass to prevent chances of reankylosis. He stated that partial excision of the ankylotic bone often results in reorganization of the entire mass and complete encapsulation of materials used for interposition. The bridging ankylotic mass continues to grow without any signs of remodeling and is augmented on the medial side by tough fibrous scar which makes the second intervention even more challenging. Similarly Kaban 4 and Raveh et al 18 emphasized on complete excision of the ankylotic mass to prevent reankylosis. Our technique of complete removal of the ankylotic mass relies on tracing the superior most extent of the mass at its junction with the cranial base by using the inferior border of zygomatic arch as a key anatomical landmark. In our case series we did not use any interpositioning material, not for the reason that it is technically more challenging by transoral approach but for the reason that we believe aggressive post operative physiotherapy and proper counselling of the patient prior to surgery are the most important factors in preventing reankylosis. Application of endoscopic technique in transoral approach to TMJA is irrefutable as described by Sembronio et al 20 . It is easy to check the medial aspect of the resection and intraoral endoscopic guidance may be useful to safely remove the ankylotic mass and anchor the temporalis muscle and fascia flap more accurately, reducing the risk of re-ankylosis. Though transoral approach cannot be employed in every case of ankylosis, especially in massive and recurrent cases, the option of using it should always be borne in mind whenever possible and should be augmented with an endoscope to improve the accuracy when available.

Various methods for maxillomandibular fixation are prevalent; wiring alone or wiring of archbar being the most commonly used method. But this exposes the operator to many communicable viral and bacterial infections by perforating injuries as well causes considerable insult to the periodontium and is painful and uncomfortable for the patient.

Methodology The present study included 30 patients who required maxillo-mandibular fixation as a part of their treatment for maxillofacial injuries. Maxillo-mandibular fixation using orthodontic brackets and fiber-reinforced composite was done and patients were followed up for 8 weeks. Occlusion, inter-incisal mouth opening, Loe and Sillness gingival index, incidence of debonding, any perforating injury to the operator were assessed during the study. Results Satisfactory occlusion was achieved in all the patients at 8 weeks post-operatively, mean mouth opening achieved at the end of 2 months was 39.2 mm, mean gingival index was below 1, incidence of debonding was 23.33% and incidence of glove perforation was 0. Conclusion Application of fibre-reinforced composite and orthodontic brackets behave more like a customized archbar where the fibre-reinforced composite provides horizontal stability and brackets act as cleats for application of elastics. From this study, we conclude that this method is highly beneficial in preventing perforating injuries to the operator, especially in cases of patients with positive viral markers. The respect for periodontal tissues, bloodless application and removal and ease of oral hygiene maintenance are other advantages of this technique. Introduction Trauma to the facial region frequently results in injuries to soft tissue, teeth and major skeletal components of the face. One of the main challenges in the management of maxillofacial trauma is to consistently restore patients back to their pre-injury form and function. In the proper reduction of fractures of tooth-bearing bones, it is important to place the teeth into the pre-injury occlusal relationship.",

Aesthetic appearance of this appliance can further be increased by using ceramic brackets which are far less noticeable and can be used in patients with active social life. Conclusion Application of fibre-reinforced composite and orthodontic brackets behave more like a customized archbar where the fibrereinforced composite provides horizontal stability and brackets act as cleats for application of elastics. From the results of this study, we conclude that this method is highly beneficial in preventing perforating injuries to the operator, especially in cases of patients with positive viral markers. Due to painless application and removal, this method is highly advantageous in paediatric and adolescent patients as the armamentarium required and the appliance itself appear far less threatening. The respect for periodontal tissues, bloodless application and removal, and ease of oral hygiene maintenance is another advantages of this technique as low mean gingival index was noticed in our study. Hence, this technique could be a useful alternative to conventional wiring techniques.",

Each feeding system has advantages with their disadvantages. Some feeder bottles requires continuous involvement and close attention of the parent to maintain actuate flow at regular intervals. Another challenge that families encounter is the cost associated with specialty feeding systems. The associated cost can add additional stress to the families and caregivers of cleft children. 2 Ultimately, parents of most cleft palate babies take to feeding with spoon. By this method, very small quantities of fluid are administered at a time hence it is time consuming and has potential for the baby to remain undernourished. 3 To overcome these challenges, study was to design assistive devices of cleft palate and formulated the following objectives",

Prior art has produced a feeding plate which fits into the palate and seals off the cleft in both the lip and the palate. This enables the infant to generate intraoral negative pressure to pull nourishment from conventional bottles. 3 Next, it has used long feeders on a bottle such that the milk is directly injected into the infant's throat so that he may swallow the milk without sucking. This method is an attempt to bypass the problem of the infant's inability to suck and causes frequent choking and aspiration and prevents the child from developing the muscles of the mouth which are believed to aid in language articulation in later life. 7 Parents of such infants have to take extra care while feeding the babies; the correct angle has to be maintained to prevent entry of food into the nasal passage.",

Hence it requires continuous involvement and close attention of the parent. The Haberman Bottle fits the bill when it comes to utility as it regulates flow without any intervention. The Haberman Feeder is activated by tongue and gums. A one-way valve separates the nipple from the bottle. Milk cannot flow back into the bottle and is replenished continuously as the baby feeds. A slit valve opening near the tip of the nipple shuts between jaw compressions, preventing the baby from being overwhelmed with milk. Stopping or reducing the flow of milk is controlled by rotation of the nipple in the baby's mouth. However the cost of Haberman feeder is too much in Indian Scenario.",

A choice can be made from a set of plates based on the extent to which flow rate has to be changed. The highest flow rate will be achieved when there is no orifice plate. As milk flows through orifice plates, the effective pressure head of the flowing milk is decreased, and flow rate at outlet of orifice is controlled.",

Patients of condylar fracture treated by other approaches than retromandibular approach and with preoperative facial paralysis were excluded. The data collected were age, gender, mechanism of injury, anatomic location, concomitant facial fractures, follow-up time and complications. Results 26 patients, 31 condyles (19 males, 7 females); age-19 to 55 years, mean-(39.3 \u00b1 4.1) met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up time for all patients was at least 6 months. 3 cases (9.68%) of temporary facial nerve paralysis, 1 cases (3.2%) of infection, 1 case of salivary fistula, 1 case of deranged occlusion and 1 case of chin deviation were observed. There were no cases of sialocele.

Dr V Yuvaraj, Professor 1. Dept of Dentistry, Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry; 2. Dept of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Indira Gandhi Institute of Dental Sciences, Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth University, Pondicherry Abstract Background/Introduction Of the many chronic painful conditions, Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) affecting the orofacial region needs the particular attention of physicians and surgeons, especially those specializing in the maxillofacial region. Treatment protocols for management of classic TN include pharmacology and surgical intervention. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons have traditionally employed the peripheral neurectomy in the surgical management of TN. Objectives This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of peripheral neurectomy in the management of TN with regards to a) the relief of symptoms in comparison with standard neurosurgical procedures and b) the duration of pain relief and complications observed compared to standard neurosurgical procedures. Methods The review of the literature was done according to PRISMA guidelines and included randomised controlled trials, reviews and prospective clinical studies involving surgical procedures for the management of TN. The primary outcomes evaluated were a) Initial relief of pain b) Duration of relief of pain c) Complications observed with ablative procedures and d) Recurrence of symptoms. A total of 43 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Results In a total of 7913 patients from the 43 studies, central procedures were found to have best results for both quality and duration of pain relief. Percutaneous and peripheral procedures were associated with increased recurrence rates. The consolidated rates of complication for peripheral, percutaneous and central procedures were 39.46%, 65.42% and 10.41% respectively. The use of Peripheral Neurectomy alone in the management of classic TN was observed in 10 studies. Conclusions Peripheral neurectomy in Trigeminal Neuralgia is associated with lesser quality of pain relief in comparison to central neurosurgical procedures. It also provides only short to medium term pain relief. Most studies with the use of peripheral neurectomy involved only a small group of patients with short follow-up periods. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons must not consider the peripheral neurectomy as the first surgical option in the management of classic TN. Long term results can be achieved better with appropriate central neurosurgical procedures and pharmacotherapy. References/Bibliography 1. Akheel M, Tomar SS.

Patil School of Dentistry and HospitalAbstract Background/Introduction Introduction:Standards for an aesthetic face are dynamic. Chin forms the strong aesthetic sub-unit of the face.the idea of chin augmentation or enhancement is to preserve the inverted triangle of youth and have a good chin projection. Objectives Indications:A receding or weak chin is a significant aesthetic impediment to a pleasing face. Poor projecting chin can hamper the outcome of a good Orthognathic surgery. Poorly projected chin is one of the indications for increasing its projection and its convexity in the profile view for aesthetically pleasing facial appearance. Methods This poster discusses various procedures to augment chin using different types of chin implants, dermal fillers,fat grafting, etc., the choice of implant materials are Gortex, Silastic, Medpor, Mersilene. With respect to implant placement, in surgical technique, an intraoral or a submental incision may be used to develop subperiosteal or a supraperiosteal pocket, depending on the preference. A drain may or may not be used.ResultsChin augmentation is an effective way of improving chin projection.ConclusionsWith properly sized implant, chin augmentation offers an easy and effective means of correcting the deficiency by derma fillers or fat grafting can improve the chin soft tissue projection.",

Platelet-rich fibrin was first developed in 2001 by Choukroun. But despite of its good clinical success certain disadvantages including possible health hazards with silica activators in glass tubes, amount of growth factors incorporated in the fibrin clot etc. led to development of newer techniques. T-PRF is a newer generation of PRF, developed by Tunali et al, where more biocompatible class IV titanium is used. Titanium tubes may be more effective at activating platelets than the glass tubes used by Choukroun in his platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) method. Another recent development is advanced PRF (A-PRF), developed by Choukroun et al, which is prepared by lowering the centrifugation speed and time, due to which leukocytes are incorporated more in the fibrin clot and hence, fasten the speed of wound healing. Also, the use of platelet concentrates in ''liquid'' form, remained an important indication in various applications leading to the development of i-PRF (injectable).

The conventional measures to estimate infections such as evaluation of WBC count and ESR are valuable in determining state of patient at testing time. However, the predictability of these is limited. A better knowledge of the inflammatory cascade has given new insights and provided several mediators that in conjunction with the clinical manifestations can be useful as markers of infection. One such mediator is C-reactive protein (CRP) and is probably the most widely used marker.

Methods Study included 300 oral cancer patients and tumor size was noted. A questionnaire was prepared to find out the reason behind such late presentation. Time lapse was also noted between first presentation of any sign/symptom or first notification by the patient till patient reported to our department.ResultsSelf negligence, reluctant attitude towards health and negative attitude of relatives towards cancer patient was big reason for late reporting. Even misguidance/inability to diagnose lesion by local doctors was another big reasons for late referral to onco centers.ConclusionsAwareness is required in rural areas for issues related to health. Even health professionals of rural areas require training to screen out suspected cancerous lesions.

The ideal width of the surgical margin for oral cancer has always been an issue of debate. Microscopic tumor at the inked resection margin increases the chance of local recurrence by a factor of 2. The most widely accepted definition of a close margin is tumor within 5 mm of the inked resection margin. This an arbitrary designation and when recurrence rates are specifically cited for close margins, they are generally less than the rate observed for patients with tumor at the inked resection margin. Patients with clear but close margins are often considered from a clinical standpoint to have positive or inadequate margins. The precise definition of the clear or adequate surgical margin is an important prognostic consideration with clinical implications in the selection of patients for adjunctive treatment.ObjectivesThe aim of this review is to evaluate the definition of close margin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and its possible prognostic significance.

We present a study of evaluation of SAN of patients who had underwent exclusively selective neck dissection for squamous cell carcinoma involving head and neck region over a period of 5 years prospectively. We identified the SAN in all SND done patients by dissecting the sternocleidomastoid muscle and retracting it posteriorly to identify the entry point of SAN nerve at the junction of upper third and middle third of posterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Identified SAN were retracted with use of vessel loop to prevent it from injury during surgery. It was then meticulous dissection were carried out to clear level IIa and IIb group of lymph nodes. All patients shoulder function was assessed pre operatively and post operatively by the arm abduction test. Based on the abduction of arm resulting in a value from 1 (abduction \\ 90 degree) to value 5 (abduction [180 degree). Results Almost all patients got symptomatic relief from the disease. Patient's interincisal mouth opening increased significantly. All patients can take regular diet.

A majority of these (80%) are at Stage III or IV at the time of presentation. The anatomy and physiology of the muscle predispose to an early invasion and cervical metastasis of buccal carcinoma. Cervical metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor. Studies have quoted that of all the buccal In view of the above reports, deciding on the type of neck dissection that should be performed for a N? neck is a longstanding topic of debate. Various neck dissections have been advocated taking into consideration the natural progression of the disease, the T and N status and adverse tumor and nodal factors.

Epub 2014 Oct 31.Dr. Apoorva Mishra, Dr. Rajanikanth, Dr. Rajiv Borle, Dr. Nitin Bhola, Dr. Anendd Jadhav, Dr. Bhushan Mundada Results Hearing impairment and ETD was found to be statistically significant in OSMF patients as compared to normal patients. Severity of Hearing Impairment was found more in advanced stage of fibrosis i.e. Clinical Stage III & Functional stage C. Mild to Moderate type of Hearing loss was seen more in Stage IIIC. ETD was also predominantly present in Stage IIIC OSMF patients. Correlation of age with various clinical & functional stages was found to be positive. Correlation of different clinical & functional stages of OSMF with Hearing Loss after Pure Tone Audiometry, ETD after Impedance Audiometry was found to be positive. Conclusions From the present study it is evident that that with advancing stages of OSMF conductive hearing impairment increases as well as ETD. ABS00806 Effect of Clinical, Demographic and Pathological Factors on Disease Free Survival Rate of Patients Having Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Oral Submucous Fibrosis: A Retrospective Study More than 90% of all oral cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). One of the most important risk factors for oral SCC is the use of tobacco (in all forms) or betel quid which also serves as a causative factor for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). There has been increased incidence of concomitant association of OSCC & OSMF in recent times. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of individual variables on disease free survival in patients having OSCC along with OSMF. Methods A retrospective observational study was carried out in which records of patients were retrieved from 2011 to 2014. A total of 78 patients having OSCC with OSMF were taken up for the study. Patient's present clinical information was obtained through telephone call.Patients were evaluated on demographic, clinical and pathological fronts and its effect on disease free survival was studied.ResultsOverall disease free survival was found to be 84.62%. Patients with negative margins had substantially low recurrence as compared to those who had positive surgical margins. In regards to the present study recurrence was present in 12 cases, which was found to be the sole factor having profound impact on survival. Rest all variables had no significant impact on disease free survival. Good survival rate can be obtained with primary surgical treatment. Pre operative assessment of factors such as stage of lesion, cervical lymph node metastasis, extra capsular spread, staging of OSCC, grading of OSMF play a crucial role in predicting recurrence postoperatively. Thus to improve survival rate, recurrence has to be minimized which in turn is controlled by above factors.Dr Bhushan Mundada, Dr Nitin Bhola, Dr Rajiv Borle, Dr Anendd JadhavAbstract Background/Introduction Salivary fistulas are a well-known sequel of parotidectomy, and successful treatment with botulinum toxin has been demonstrated in individual cases. Objectives Squamous cell carcinoma of buccal mucosa and gingivobuccal sulcus is an aggressive form of oral carcinoma with a high recurrence rate. Injury to the parotid duct is often unavoidable when surgically treating mentioned sites because of the intimate anatomic relation among the buccal mucosa, Stensen duct, and parotid gland. It is often difficult to achieve negative margins and preserve the integrity of the parotid duct. Sialocele formation is a frequent and untoward complication owing to extravasation of saliva into the surgical defect, which delays healing, creates fistulas, and produces painful facial swelling. Currently, no consensus exists regarding the management of a parotid sialocele. Multiple investigators have described different modalities of treatment.",

This becomes even more apparent in advanced age. Objectives This paper aims to highlight the challenges faced by the surgeon in the coverage of such defects by reporting two cases in male patients, both aged above the 5th decade of life. Objective: To highlight some of the pitfalls and technique sensitivity of the two flaps used to cover the defects and the ensuing complications that were age, surgical technique and post op care related. The use of free flaps has become the state of the art for reconstruction of oral and maxillofacial defects in the present era. But free flap transfer cannot be used for all patients at every institute since it requires special techniques and equipments as in the case of microsurgery. So locoregional flaps play a crucial role in many of the oncological cases. Conventional flap like pectoralis major remains versatile and reliable flap for primary and secondary reconstruction. Many qualities of this flap such as its proximity to the head and neck region, the reliability of its pedicle and short learning curve, have contributed to the widespread use of this flap and its overall good success rates. Complication rates in this flap vary from 13% to 65%. This flap is now popularized in developing countries with limited medical resources. It seems that the role of PMMC in head and neck reconstruction has shifted from a ''workhorse flap'' to a ''salvage flap'' in the era of free flaps. Furthermore, technique modifications of flap harvesting not only ensure its reliability but also decreases the donor site functional impairment. In this paper we would like to share our experience in using this flap as both a workhorse as well as a salvage flap mainly emphasizing on the different harvesting techniques and complications.",

There are various classifications based on anatomical site, number of fragments, relationship of the fracture to the site of injury, presence or absence of teeth, direction of fracture and favorability. However, in recent times there is change in the fracture pattern owing to varying etiology and different type of injury.ObjectivesTo emphasize the importance of customizing the classical treatment protocol for unusual pattern of mandibular fractures. Methods A retrospective study of the unusual patterns of the fracture mandible were analyzed. The management protocols followed for these situations during the period of three years (April 2014 -august 2017) were summarized. Results will be formulated.Conclusions These unusual fracture patterns do not come under any of the standard classifications and treatment protocols. Hence, there is a need for formulating an appropriate surgical approach, reduction technique and fixation modalities.

Dental College and Hospital, Ahmedabad Abstract Background/Introduction Nasal bone fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) either use unsightly incisions directly in the glabellar region or cumbersome hemicoronal or bicoronal incisions. Till date, subbrow approach has been used in management of frontal sinus fractures. Here we propose a smaller similar version for management of nasal fractures. A bicoronal approach offers adequate exposure but has several disadvantages. Other more direct incisions, such as frontalis rhytid, butterfly, 'H', though are smaller give conspicuous scars. The main problem of nasal fractures is aesthetic deformity of face and if the surgical approach leaves a scar, it should not be considered for treatment. Objectives To evaluate a modification of subbrow incision as an approach for ORIF of nasal fractures. Methods For this study, 10 adult patients having nasal bone fractures requiring ORIF were selected. INCLUSION CRITERIA -Patients with displaced nasal bone fractures, with or without concomitant midface and those not possible to fix with closed reduction. EXCLUSION CRI-TERIA -Patients with undisplaced isolated nasal bone fracture. -Patients with cranial fractures requiring bicoronal approach. The incision line was started from the medial most part of the eyebrow to a point slightly medial to the medial limbus axis line following precisely the lower edge of the eyebrow to obtain an inconspicuous scar. Results Stable fixation, restoration of contour deformities and barely visible scars with no postoperative complications were results observed using this approach. Conclusions The modified subbrow approach offers a good cosmetic result and adequate accessibility to perform ORIF of nasal bone fractures. Dr. Sonal Anchlia, Dr. Ramyata Dayatar, Dr. Shishir kumar, Dr. Nisarg Patel, Dr. Dhruvi Shukla Government Dental College & Hospital, Ahmedabad Abstract Background/Introduction Traditionally, in fractures of the zygomaticomaxillary complex, two separate 2 D plates have been used, one in the infraorbital region and the other in the zygomatic buttress/maxilla region. ObjectivesThe aim of our study was to prove the usefulness of three dimensional (3D) plates in zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures by giving it 3D stability, using only one 3D plate instead of two 2D plates, thereby, not only reducing the implant material but also obviating the need for extraoral orbital incisions. Methods 20 patients of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures were treated using single 3D plates intraorally over zygoma/maxilla to fix both infraorbital rim and zygomaticomaxillary buttress simultaneously instead of two 2D miniplates in the same regions. Patients were assessed postoperatively for occlusion discrepancy, malar asymmetry, neurosurgery deficit, wound dehiscence, local infection, mobility of fracture segment, nonunion or malunion, residual cosmetic deformity and Interincisal opening. Results 34.54% less incisions and 29.06% less miniplates were required when method was used for fixing 3D plates in zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. The only postoperative complications observe were maxillary sinusitis, wound dehiscence, occlusal discrepancy and infection in one patient each (13.34%). Conclusions Thus, the use of 3D plates in the management of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures gives good results in terms of both function and esthetics. They stabilize the bone fragments in three dimensions because of their closed quadrangular geometric shape and also result in less number of incisions and less amount of hardware.

Unilateral fractures occurs 3 times more than bi-lateral condylar fractures. The absolute indication of open treatment are condylar fractures with considerable dislocations, when closed treatment doesn't restabilize occlusion. Open reduction aims at anatomical repositioning and rigid fixation of the fragments, occlussal stability, rapid return to function, maintenance of vertical ramal height, and less long term TMJ dysfunction. Methods of open reduction and internal fixation for the condylar fracture includes kirschner wires, intra osseous wiring, mini plates(2D) & lag screws. Mustafa Farmand in 1992 developed 3D plates and advocated better bio geometry to provide stable fixation over 2D plates. Quadrangle geometry of plates assures 3D stability of fracture sites & offers good resistance against torque forces. Objectives Objective of our study was to evaluate clinical results and to assess efficacy, stability and rigidity of 3D plates for osteosynthesis in mandibular condylar fracture.

T@Gmail.Com Mobile No: 7350016876; Email Id: Abhaydatarkar@Yahoo.Com Abstract Background/Introduction Frontal sinus fractures comprise 5-30% of maxillofacial fractures, with isolated anterior table fractures accounting for 33% of frontal sinus fractures. Anterior table frontal sinus fractures can result in aesthetically displeasing contour deformities. Acute anterior table frontal sinus fractures that are depressed may be reduced with an open, closed, or endoscope-assisted approach. Delayed contour deformity camouflage can be achieved using bone grafts, titanium meshes, methyl methacrylate, hydroxyapatite cement, and polyether ether ketone implants. Objectives 1.the aim of frontal sinus fracture repair is to restore form and function and to prevent delayed complications. 2. Timing of surgical repair of frontal sinus fracture i.e. acute versus delayed. Methods A total of 34 patients have been included having frontal sinus fracture of age 22-58 years (male pt -27, female pt -7). Fractures involving only anterior table are surgically corrected within 14 days of trauma. Depressed fractures of frontal bone involving both anterior and posterior table are considered for delayed approach.

The progressive irreversible fibrosis of the submucosa causes reduction in mouth opening, Burning sensation while having spicy food. Predictably the release of the fibrotic bands has been the basis of all surgical techniques employed, while medical interventions(Stage I & II) have delt on the suppression of the inflammatory response and prevention of progressive fibrosis. Surgical intervention is recommended for patients with severe reduction in mouth opening (Stage III & Stage IV) the surgical management of this condition involves releasing of the fibrous bands and interpositional grafts to retain the increased mouth opening. Various procedures and graft material have been utilised with differing success rates. Different Surgical modalities include Lasers, Usage of Local Flaps (Intraoral &Extraoral), Grafts, Coronoidectomies/muscle myotomies.

The IHS suggests a classification of TN as either classic (essential or idiopathic) TN (CTN) or symptomatic TN (STN; pain indistinguishable from that of CTN, but caused by a demonstrable structural lesion other than vascular compression). The diagnosis of CTN requires the absence of a clinically evident neurological deficit. CTN starts in the second or third divisions, affecting the cheek or the chin [International Headache Society, 2004]. The ophthalmic division alone is involved in less than 5% of cases [De Simone et al. 2005]. The single attack generally lasts from less than a seconds, patient may clutch the hand over face and experience severe lancinating pain associated with spasmodic contraction of facial muscles during attacks.

These are most common tumours of infancy (10%) with F:M ratio of 3:1, 60% of these occur in head and neck. They can cause aesthetic and functional impairment, depending on location. The most common site is the upper lip but can occur on tongue, buccal mucosa and palate. Objectives To Evaluate Use Of Percutaneous Injections Of Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate In Management Of Hemangiomas And Vascular Malformations. Methods MRI, USG, CT Angiography techniques are used as diagnostic aids. The conservative modalities for hemangioma as well as vascular malformations, Sclerotherapy is an effective method which produces endothelial damage that results in permanent endofibrosis and clinical obliteration of the vessel. Various sclerosing agents used are osmotic agents, hypertonic saline solution, detergent solutions like sodium morrhuate, ethanolamine oleate, sodium tetradecyl sulphate, polidocanol & sclerosant foam. These agents induce sclerosis on venous endothelium via interference with cell membrane lipids until either diluted or inactivated by serum surfactants. Results cases of Haemangioma's and vascular malformations in aesthetic zone of maxillofacial region were successfully managed with sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl sulphate injections.

In advanced cases thick fibrotic bands extend from subepithelial connective tissue to muscle layer. 1 Chronic mechanical trauma due to sharp remaining teeth, less than ideal fillings prosthesis and loose anchoring attachments have been report etiology for oral squamous cell carcinoma in OSF patients. 2 Trauma to mucosa acts as a promotional stimulus in inducing epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma initiated with carcino-gen like with betel nut, tobacco. 3 In order to avoid chronic mechanical irritation in posterior part of buccal mucosa adjacent to the malposed upper and lower third molar, extraction of malposed third molar is necessary. Trismus caused by fibrosis makes it difficult for the removal of third molar due to reduced mouth opening, limited access and reduced visibility.Improper instrumentation due to the inadequacy of intraoral space leads to the difficulty of anaesthetizing the region, inability to place the forcep etc. Any attempt to open the mouth forcefully during extraction may tear the buccal mucosa leading to excessive bleeding and further aggravating the fibrosis in that region.To avoid and overcome these problems the following measures can be adopted so that the extraction of malposed third molar becomes easier:1. Vazironi Akinosi block should be used instead of inferior alveolar nerve block for mandibular third molar. Posterior superior alveolar nerve and greater palatine nerve block should be used for maxillary third molar. 2. The adjacent buccal mucosa is to be anaesthetized topically. 3. 24-guage standard stainless steel wire is to be used. This wire is to be cut obliquely and introduced through the interdental space of the second and third molar. The two ends of the wire are then twisted tightly around the crown to prevent them from slipping. 4. The tooth is elevated with the help of an elevator. While elevating the tooth, precaution should be taken that the adjacent buccal mucosa is in a relaxed position. This can be accomplished by asking the patient to close the mouth while elevating the tooth. 5. After elevating the tooth, it is pulled out of the socket with the help of a twisted wire instead of applying the forceps. ",

            "text": "Airway management is a difficult task in complex craniomaxillofacial trauma. The choice of intubation technique depends on good assessment from the neurosurgeon, maxillofacial surgeon as well as the anaesthetist. Nasal intubation after severe craniomaxillofacial may result in meningitis or it can also lead to passage of tube intracranially in patients with frontobasilar fractures. To avoid this complication, oral intubation may be preferred, but this may interfere with the placement of intermaxillary fixation (IMF) to establish the patient's occlusion in the intraoperative period. To enable IMF to be placed, tracheostomy may be indicated but this carries significant morbidity.An alternative to tracheostomy i.e. submental intubation was first described by Hernandez Altemir in 1986. The submental intubation with conventional Altemir's technique and few of its modification has been used largely in maxillofacial injury cases. This paper highlights a modification of submental intubation incision in patients with panfacial injuries, to treat complex mandibular fractures.",

In cases of comminuted mandibular symphysis fractures subsequent modification of the conventional technique of submental intubation was planned. Conventional oral intubation was carried out using flexo-metallic endotracheal tube. Using aseptic technique the skin of the neck and submandibular area was scrubbed and prepared. The conventional incision of submental intubation was modified to gain better access and to avoid a second intraoral surgical wound to reduce and fix mandibular symphysis and parasymphysis fractures. The conventional submental incision was marked and bilaterally lateral extensions were marked at an obtuse angle from the conventional incision, along the curvature of the mandible 2cm below the inferior border of mandible. Length of these horizontal lateral extensions were modified depending on the fracture site and exposure needed.After local infiltration of LA, the incision was made using no 15 surgical blade. Blunt dissection was carried upto the inferior border of mandible. A curved hemostat was passed along the lingual surface of mandible to reach the floor of the mouth, taking care to avoid injury to submandibular gland duct, and an incision was taken in the floor of the mouth to pass the hemostat in the oral cavity. ET tube was disconnected and shifted along with the cuff from oral cavity to submental region through the intraoral incision. After reconnecting the ET Tube it was secured to the inferior flap with 1-0 mersilk for stabilization.Full thickness skin flap was raised to expose the mandibular symphysis fracture. The fracture site was exposed, reduced and fixed with miniplates. Discussion Airway management for patients afflicted with panfacial fractures is a challenge for the anaesthetic team. In addition, the maxillofacial surgeon requires intraoperative MMF to achieve satisfactory surgical outcomes. This necessitates modification of the standard anaesthesia techniques. Submental intubation with midline incision is used frequently, but modifying the incision for treatment of mandibular fractures has been rarely mentioned.It has various advantages like a second intraoral incision is not required for management of mandibular fractures in symphysis, parasymphysis and body regions. It reduces surgical time. It provides an extraoral approach for fixation of the fracture, hence providing good accessibility, with minimal scar. In edentulous patients stripping of periosteum intraorally compromises blood supply to mandible hence this extraoral approach is preferred. In case of comminuted fractures involving both the cortices, extraoral approach is preferred as managing lingual cortex is difficult intra orally and needs separation of geniohyoid and genioglossus muscle which is avoided extraorally. Loss of sulcus depth and ptosis of mentalis muscle may also be reduced.",
