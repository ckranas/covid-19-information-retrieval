            "text": "Mutations in CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) cause cystic fibrosis. Many of the disease causing mutations disrupt the folding, transport, or function of the protein. CFTR is folded cotranslationally and multiple interactions with many partners are involved in proper folding and transport to the plasma membrane. The disease-causing folding mutations disrupt these processes leading to an inability of CFTR to reach the later stages in the secretory pathway and to degradation of the immature protein. These early interactions are critical decision points as interference with the later quality control, for example at the terminal stage of degradation, does not lead to improved folding. To test the hypothesis that altered interactions of the mutant CFTR with the partner proteins reflect early and exploitable quality control mechanisms, site-specific photocrosslinking, involving tRNA-mediated incorporation of photocrosslinking probes into the CFTR nascent chains during in vitro translation, was utilized to identify the factors that preferentially interact with mutant CFTR. Proteins that preferentially recognized the mutant chains were identified by utilizing biochemical reconstitution and the crosslinking assay in combination with mass spectrometry. The first set of proteins identified reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism of quality control and include those implicated in regulating mRNA stability, translational elongation, and targeting of the nascent chain for degradation -providing a system for regulating the expression of the mutant chains at an early step. Understanding the process of selectivity of this quality control system may uncover novel targets for intervention in the pathogenesis of CF.",

High throughput screenings for small molecules to overcome this defect have yielded several partially effective \"correctors.\" However none of the compounds yet discovered restore cell surface function of the mutant to more than a few percent of the wild-type level. Neither the mechanism by which this degree of correction is achieved nor why it is so limited is understood. However, recent studies of both the first nucleotide domain (NBD1) from which F508 is deleted and full-length \u2206F508 CFTR suggest that the limitation may be due to the need to both thermally stabilize NBD1 and repair (\"patch\") its interface with the second membrane-spanning domain (MSD2). In this study, we found that several of the more effective correctors including VX-809 did not restore channel thermal stability or the metabolic life of \u2206F508 CFTR although they did promote the global assembly of the multi-domain protein in which formation of the NBD1-MSD2 interface is a crucial step. The effect of VX-809 was much more potent when combined with second site mutations in NBD1 that promote \u2206F508 CFTR maturation and thermally stabilize channel activity, but to a lesser extent when combined with NBD1/MSD2 patching mutants. VX-809 was not effective in promoting other misprocessing mutants present in NBD1, but it did correct disease-associated mutations in various cytoplasmic loops (CL1-CL4). These findings indicate that a primary short-coming of existing correctors discovered in cell-based screens is their inability to restore thermodynamic stability to \u2206F508 CFTR and emphasize the need to identify compounds with this ability. The combination of existing correctors (\"assembly promoters\") with NBD1 thermal stabilizers may provide a more complete therapeutic strategy for CF patients with the \u2206F508 mutation.

However, compounds that correct the F508del mutation and confer \u2265 20% wild type activity in primary airway epithelial cells have not been readily identified. The inability to obtain robust and therapeutically relevant levels of F508del CFTR correction by a single molecule may in some cases reflect diminished pools of Band B substrate (i.e. from blunted F508del synthesis and/or increased degradation). In the present experiments, we observed markedly diminished steady state levels of F508del (Band B) compared to WT CFTR protein in HeLa and bronchial epithelial cells, even when massive levels of F508del mRNA were overexpressed. In human primary airway cells, the paucity of Band B F508del was even more pronounced (in some cases below levels of detection) although F508del and WT mRNA were comparable. These results suggest an approach to improving F508del CFTR maturation that augments the pool of mutant CFTR suitable for folding repair. In this regard, we show that the proteosome inhibitor epoxomycin induces a large increase in F508del Band B, but (as expected) does not enhance CFTR rescue by C18 (a VX-809 analog), indicating accumulation of an irreversibly misfolded F508del intermediate. In an effort to identify novel compounds that augment \"repairable\" F508del protein, we developed a rapid throughput compound library screen. Cell-based imaging was used to semi-quantitatively estimate distribution of F508del CFTR by analysis of two-dimensional images. Cells were permeabilized, labeled with antibodies that recognize internal CFTR epitopes, and monitored using Evotec Opera\u2122, an automated confocal microscopy system. We evaluated ~2000 known bioactive compounds from the NIH Roadmap Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository. A total of 25 primary hits were identified and one compound, 865022, was found to 1) increase CFTR levels in a dose dependent fashion, 2) augment F508del CFTR Band B compared to control, 3) increase cAMP dependent anion efflux in HeLa cells expressing I539T/F508del CFTR, and 4) stimulate CFTR dependent short circuit current in human bronchial epithelial monolayers. Co-treatment with 865022 and C18 synergistically enhanced F508del CFTR dependent ion transport following activation by forskolin or genistein. These results suggest an approach to increase efficiency of pharmacologic intervention by enlarging the corrector-restorable pool of F508del CFTR.",

Antibody reagents that distinguish among various CFTR conformational states could provide a valuable research tool and elucidate mechanisms that underlie defective biogenesis. Based on evidence that CFTR NBD2 requires an NBD1 scaffold for proper folding, we pursued experiments using the second NBD as an antigen in CFTR -/-mice. Over 300 hybridomas were obtained and screened by protein ELISA. Seventy-four positive supernatants were studied by 1) immunoprecipitation under mild denaturating conditions (designed to preserve peptide structure), 2) cell based CFTR binding assays, 3) Western blotting, and 4) epitope mapping. Several robust antibodies to CFTR NBD2 were identified and are being distributed by the CFTR Protein Folding Consortium. One of the new reagents was shown by numerous laboratories to exhibit conformational sensitivity, and discriminate properly folded (versus unfolded) full length CFTR. In another study, because the interaction between cytoplasmic loop 4 (CL4) and the F508 segment of NBD1 is essential for CFTR maturation, 384 hybridomas were tested against these regions. Interestingly, two monoclonal antibodies preferentially recognize wild type versus the mutant full length NBD1 by ELISA. Thirty-one hybridomas against CL4 are currently being evaluated by Western blot and immunoprecipitation (WT versus F508del CFTR grown at 37 o C or 27 o C). Finally, we are developing probes specific for CFTR at the cell surface. Antibodies against extracellular loop 4 (ECL4) have not been previously available, perhaps in part due to bulky polysaccharide attachments that blunt immunogenicity. Accordingly, we devised a strategy to monitor processing of WT or F508del CFTR expressed in a glycan deficient cell line (GnTI-HEK293S). In preliminary studies, we show this model allows WT CFTR to traffic properly to the cell surface (as judged by immunohistochemistry), exhibit surface biotinylation, and retain Clchannel activity. The model also faithfully reproduces the F508del processing defect. Antibodies against ECL4 are being tested as a means to optimize F508del CFTR corrector molecules (by quantitative surface localization) and probe extracellular (\"inward\" versus \"outward\") configurations of CFTR during channel gating. Monoclonal antibodies that discriminate specific CFTR conformations will serve as useful tools for investigating protein biogenesis and drug discovery in the future.",

            "text": "Funded by CFF and NIH. The most common mutation in CFTR, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaF508), destabilizes folding of the NBD1 domain, resulting in impaired trafficking of the mutant channel to the cell surface, poor gating kinetics, and reduced metabolic stability. Stabilization of the deltaF508-NBD1 domain by small molecule binding or facilitation of folding via a chaperonelike mechanism is expected to enhance CFTR trafficking. Recent results (Rabeh et al., Cell 148, 150-163 and Mendoza et al., Cell 148, 164-174) with deltaF508-NBD1-stabilizing mutants, however, suggest that NBD1 stabilization alone is not sufficient for appreciable correction of deltaF508-CFTR, but that additional downstream points in the folding pathway, including proper folding of the NBD1-ICL4 interface are necessary to restore significant levels of CFTR cell surface expression. RDR-1 is a small molecule corrector of deltaF508-CFTR reported to act via binding to NBD1 (Sampson et al., Chemistry and Biology 18,321-242). If this compound stabilized NBD1, we reasoned that this compound would have little activity by itself, but could act in synergy with correctors working downstream of the NBD1 folding. We therefore characterized the corrector activity of RDR-1 alone and in combination with VX-809 in FRT cells by Western blot and in primary human bronchial epithelial cells by short circuit current measurements. RDR-1 corrector activity in hBE cells is not detectable, but RDR-1 significantly enhances the corrector activity of VX-809 when applied to cells for 24 h (but not acutely). Western blots measuring \"C-band\" maturation also indicate a strong synergistic effect of co-correction with RDR-1 and VX-809 compared to either compound alone. We further measured stabilization of NBD1 by RDR-1, comparing differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) with the label-free differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method, using murine and human constructs of willd-type and deltaF508 NBD1 proteins. While our DSF results concur with published results, DSC measurements detected no change in the melting temperature of deltaF508-NBD1. These results suggest that RDR-1 exerts its effects through an alternate mechanism, nevertheless complementary to that of VX-809, but independent of any interaction with NBD1.",

            "text": "CFTR is a chloride channel evolved from the exporter member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) Protein Superfamily. Recent structural/functional studies of CFTR suggest that CFTR employs the evolutionarily conserved structural motifs in its nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) as well as transmembrane domains (TMDs) to enact the function of a gated pore for anion permeation. CFTR is gated by association and dissociation of its two NBDs that are governed by ATP binding and hydrolysis respectively. Singlechannel kinetic data of CFTR have led to a gating model with one-to-one stoichiometry between the gating cycle and the ATP hydrolysis cycle. This strict coupling between NBDs and TMDs fits nicely with the popular alternating access model proposed for ABC transporters at large. However, in a recent report (Jih et al., 2012), by identifying a transient post-hydrolytic state, we raised the possibility that the ATP hydrolysis cycle and the gating cycle may not be strictly coupled. A critical piece of evidence needed to support the non-strict coupling idea is to demonstrate a direct transition from a post-hydrolytic open state to the original ATP-bound pre-hydrolytic open state. Lately, we accidentally found a CFTR mutant (R352C) that exhibits two distinguishable single-channel conductance levels (O1 and O2). Interestingly, the transition of the two open states follows a preferred order (C->O1->O2->C), indicating an input of free energy that drives the predominant O1->O2 transition over the opposite O2->O1 transition. Considering the known mechanism of CFTR gating, the most likely source of such free energy input is ATP-hydrolysis. This idea is supported by the observation that only C->O1->C was seen in the presence of ATP when introducing mutations (e.g., E1371S) that abolish ATP hydrolysis into the R352C channels. However, in the absence of ATP, R352C/E1371S channels exhibit only C->O2->C transitions, indicating that without ATP-induced NBD dimerization, the pore conformation must be different from that opened by ATP-induced NBD dimerization. Statistical analysis of all singlechannel gating events revealed a considerable amount of opening events containing more than one O1->O2 (i.e. C -> (O1->O2)n->C) transition. If we accept the idea that the O1->O2 transition represents the hydrolysis of 1 ATP molecule, these surprising gating transitions would reflect openings embedded with hydrolysis of more than one ATP molecule-a violation of one-to-one stoichiometry. We thus argue that the gating cycle in CFTR is not strictly coupled to ATP hydrolysis cycle. Furthermore, the fact that the post-hydrolytic O2 state is capable of \"re-entering\" the prehydrolytic O1 state indicates that the gate remains open for a finite period after NBD dimer separation and the release of hydrolytic products. In other words, there is a delay for the closing signal transduction from the NBDs to the gate. These new results lead us to propose a new gating model that fea-tures energetically coupled NBDs and TMDs: both NBDs and TMDs hold a certain degree of autonomy to function on their own but conformational changes in each domain are energetically coupled. Importantly, this new model offers a new target for the action of CFTR potentiators.",

To date, the primary defect in protein misfolding has been studied in cell-based assays employing post-translational modification as a biochemical read-out of folding and biosynthetic rescue. We hypothesize that the identification of targeted pharmacological interventions which can effectively ameliorate the misfolding of F508del-CFTR will benefit from studies which directly monitor the folding-unfolding transitions of the purified, full length mutant protein. Our laboratory has developed methods in efficiently purifying full length wildtype (WT-) and F508del-CFTR from a Sf9 cell expression system. The purified CFTR protein is then used for developing biophysical methods to enable future identification of small molecules which directly bind to CFTR to modify folding and unfolding. Toward this goal we have adapted fluorescence based methods described in recent studies of the purified ABC importer of Escherichia coli, BtuCD. These approaches induced in vitro unfolding of the protein by chemical denaturants, guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) and urea, and the subsequent conformational changes were monitored through changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Similarly to BtuCD, n-dodecyl \u03b2-D-maltoside detergent solubilized CFTR is susceptible to unfolding by increasing concentrations of both denaturants. Upon unfolding of native WT-CFTR with increasing concentrations of both denaturants, the peak intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity decreases and the wavelength emission maxima shifts from 323 nm to longer wavelengths of 332 nm which is also commonly known as a red shift. The susceptibility of CFTR to GnHCl is much greater than with urea with 80% of its unfolding occurred at 1 M GnHCl whereas 80% unfolding occurred at 4 M urea. In the case of BtuCD, unfolding at 4 M urea is associated with de-stabilization of the interface between the nucleotide binding domains and the coupling helices presented by the membrane domains. Since this interface is proposed to be disrupted by F508del mutation, our future studies will probe the susceptibility of purified F508del-CFTR protein to urea and predict whether the mutant will have enhanced susceptibility to urea denaturation. Future studies using this approach will test whether certain pharmacological small molecules can significantly decrease the susceptibility to unfolding of F508del-CFTR induced by urea. These studies constitute the first biophysical approaches towards investigating the unfolding of purified full length CFTR which promise to provide insight into the structural basis for F508del-CFTR misfolding as well as to provide an assay for small molecules which act directly to modify such unfolding.

To address this, we analyzed de novo NBD1 folding as the nascent chain is synthesized and emerges from the ribosome using fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between an N-terminal donor (CFP) and a cotranslationally incorporated fluorescent acceptor dye, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. Previous studies using an acceptor probe located at residue 450 in NBD1 revealed that folding is initiated by abrupt compaction of an N-terminal ATP-binding subdomain as residues 515-550 are synthesized. To define the complete NBD1 folding pathway, acceptor probes were incorporated at residues 487 and 567.",

In contrast, when the nascent chain was released from the ribosome, optimal positioning of S6 was achieved at a much shorter length (truncation 500-550). Intriguingly, the discrepancy between folding on the ribosome and off the ribosome was not observed in alpha-subdomain-deleted chains, indicating that the ribosome attachment inhibits NBD1 folding during alpha-subdomain synthesis. For the acceptor at residue 567, located at the N-terminus of S7, maximal FRET was observed after S8 had emerged from the ribosome (truncation 644). Introduction of proline into S8 (I601P) substantially decreased FRET for residue 567, indicating that S7 positioning requires a cooperative movement of S8 to form the four-stranded beta-sheet core (S3, S6, S7, and S8). In addition, D529F, a mutation that enhances NBD1 folding in cells (Mendoza et al., 2012) positioned S7 earlier during synthesis. This suggests that alpha-subdomain folding possibly involving interaction of D529 with R555 impairs the beta-sheet core formation. It is plausible that keeping the alpha-subdomain more flexible and less rigid can assist S7 intercalation to the core, which might be the structural basis for suppressor mutations in alpha-subdomain. In a stark contrast to S6, S7 positioning occurred only for nascent chains that remained attached to the ribosome. Thus, biosynthetic machinery (ribosome and/or cytosolic factors) delays nascent chain folding during alpha-subdomain synthesis but is required to facilitate intercalation of betastrands within the core. Our results suggest that the core formation may represent a limiting step during in vitro refolding, and indicate that NBD1 cotranslational folding requires a series of subdomain compactions that are dynamically regulated by cellular biosynthetic machinery.

The exact mechanisms by which this intrinsically disordered part of the protein regulates the channel and the specific segments important in this regulation are currently unknown. Building on our previous work, here we perform NMR and fluorescence binding studies on non-phosphorylated and highly PKA-phosphorylated states of the isolated human CFTR R region and demonstrate binding of the R region to a number of intramolecular and intermolecular partners. These include human CFTR NBD1, NBD2, and a 42-residue peptide from the C-terminus of CFTR, as well as the STAS domain of the SLC26A3 chloride-bicarbonate exchanger that is a co-regulator of CFTR and the 14-3-3\u03b2 protein implicated in CFTR processing. Analysis of NMR resonance broadening and chemical shift changes upon binding coupled with fluorescence binding measurements provides evidence for multi-site interactions of various segments of the R region and also shows that the same segments interact with different partners. Our data reveal that NBD binding is much stronger to the non-phosphorylated R region while binding to the C-terminus peptide, STAS domain and 14-3-3\u03b2 is stronger in the PKA phosphorylated state. Similar to many other disordered proteins, the R region is a \"hub\" for regulatory protein interactions, which integrates and mediates multiple regulatory signals for CFTR. Based on these binding data, structural models for the dynamic interactions of the R region within full-length CFTR and with 14-3-3 are presented that provide a foundation for further refinement of our understanding of the structural basis of phospho-regulation of CFTR.

Although bacterial lung infection and the resulting inflammation cause most of the morbidity and mortality, how loss of CFTR first disrupts airway host defense has remained uncertain. We asked what abnormalities impair eradication when a bacterium lands on the pristine surface of a newborn CF airway. To investigate these defects, we interrogated the viability of individual bacteria immobilized on solid grids and placed on the airway surface. As a model we studied CF pigs, which spontaneously develop hallmark features of CF lung disease. At birth, their lungs lack infection and inflammation, but have a reduced ability to eradicate bacteria. We found that in newborn wildtype pigs, the thin layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) rapidly killed bacteria in vivo , when removed from the lung, and in primary epithelial cultures. Lack of CFTR reduced bacterial killing. We also found that ASL pH was more acidic in CF, and reducing pH inhibited the antimicrobial activity of ASL. Reducing ASL pH diminished bacterial killing in wild-type pigs, and increasing ASL pH rescued killing in CF pigs. These results directly link the initial host defense defect to loss of CFTR, an anion channel that facilitates HCO 3 transport. Without CFTR, airway epithelial HCO 3 secretion is defective, ASL pH falls and inhibits antimicrobial function, and thereby impairs killing of bacteria that enter the newborn lung. These findings suggest that increasing ASL pH might prevent the initial infection in patients with CF and that assaying ASL pH or bacterial killing could report on the benefit of therapeutic interventions.",

Many obstacles hinder the understanding of CF disease pathogenesis, impeding advancements in understanding how mutations cause disease, and slowing the progress towards new treatments. miRNAs comprise a large family of ~21-nt long non-coding RNAs that function as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in metazoans and plants. While CFTR structure and function is well studied our knowledge of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CFTR expression is incompletely understood. To investigate the role that miRNAs play in regulating CFTR expression, we first profiled miRNA expression in well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia. We hypothesized that miR-138 regulates CFTR expression through its interactions with the transcriptional repressor SIN3A. We validated SIN3A as a miR-138 target. Using ChIP we show that SIN3A interacts with CTCF on the CFTR promoter at the -20.9 kb DHS. Repressing SIN3A with a miR-138 mimic or SIN3A siRNA significantly increased CFTR expression and function in epithelia. Interestingly, transcript profiling analysis demonstrates that miR-138 influences the expression of many proteins known to associate with CFTR, thereby influencing CFTR biosynthesis. Both miR-138 and SIN3A are highly conserved across species, and we replicated these findings in pig airway epithelia, suggesting that the miR-138/SIN3A mediated regulation of CFTR is evolutionarily conserved. The most common CFTR mutation, \u2206F508, causes protein misfolding, degradation, and CF. Remarkably, manipulating the miR-138/SIN3A regulatory network improved the biosynthesis of CFTR-\u2206F508, restoring Cltransport to human CF airway epithelia. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an individual microRNA having such broad regulatory functions.

Neutrophils are key players in fighting infections, but they also are major contributors to the inflammatory response in CF lungs. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms involved in CF airway neutrophil inflammation is relevant to the development of CF therapies. The most recently discovered purinergic receptor subtype, the P2Y14 receptor (P2Y14-R), is not expressed in airway epithelia, but P2Y14-R transcripts are abundantly expressed in peripheral neutrophils. We discovered that UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), the most potent naturally occurring P2Y14-R agonist, is released with mucins from goblet cell-rich epithelia in vitro. Importantly, UDP-Glc accumulates in vivo in CF lung secretions at concentrations (100 -1000 nM) previously reported to promote P2Y14-R-mediated signaling in model cell lines. However, the actions of UDP-Glc on neutrophil responses remain undefined. We tested the hypothesis that UDP-Glc acts as an extracellular signalling molecule for neutrophils by assessing its effect on cell shape and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, chemotaxis, and Rho activation. Fluorescence microscopy analysis indicated that, in the absence of external stimulus, most neutrophils displayed round shape and phalloidin uniformly stained the cortical actin fibres. Incubation of neutrophils with UDP-Glc resulted in changes in cell shape that were accompanied by a sharp increase in the intensity of the cortical actin staining and the formation of a broad ruffle-like structure in one cellular pole. Using a modified Boyden chamber, we demonstrate that UDP-Glc promoted neutrophil chemotaxis (0.1-100 \u00b5M; EC50 = 1.3 \u00b5M), which was blocked by Rho kinase inhibitors. In line with these results, UDP-Glc evoked rapid and robust activation of RhoA in these cells (pulldown assay). Using the HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, we demonstrate that UDP-Glc-evoked responses occurred in a P2Y14-R expression-dependent manner. Ectonucleotidases expressed on airway epithelial cells and neutrophils rapidly hydrolyze extracellular ATP, but incubation of radiotracer UDP-[ 3 H]Glc for up to 1h with human bronchial epithelial cells, isolated human neutrophils, or purulent CF sputum resulted in negligible metabolism of the UDP-sugar, as assessed by HPLC. These results support the notion that UDP-Glc is a stable and potent pro-inflammatory mediator that promotes P2Y14-R-regulated RhoA activation, cytoskeleton rearrangements, and chemotaxis in human neutrophils. Given the high levels of UDP-Glc found in CF lung secretions, our study suggests a role of the neutrophil P2Y14-R as a contributor to lung inflammation in CF.",

Scnn1b transgenic mice overexpress the Scnn1b gene (coding for the epithelial Na + channel subunit, \u03b2ENaC) in airway Clara cells, resulting in increased Na + absorption, airway surface liquid dehydration, mucus adhesion to airway surfaces, and, finally, airway inflammation. These mice provide an excellent animal model to investigate the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis. The characterization of pathophysiology of lung disease in Scnn1b transgenic mice has revealed increased macrophage number, alterations in macrophage morphology, and persistent neutrophilic and transient eosinophilic infiltrates. Macrophages are thought to play a pivotal role in regulating the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of inflammation. However, it is unknown whether macrophages and their activation patterns are involved in the initiation and/or maintenance of airway inflammation in Scnn1b transgenic mice. Therefore, our hypothesis in the study was that the initiation and the course of airway inflammation in Scnn1b transgenic mouse is determined by the macrophage activation patterns. To address this hypothesis, we performed gene expression analysis on granulocytes-depleted BAL macrophages (95.86 \u00b1 0.25 (SEM) % pure populations of macrophages). The gene expression data analyses in control littermates at different age points (1 day, 3 days, 10 days and 6 weeks) revealed age-associated shift in macrophage activation patterns.

            "text": "The outer mouth of the CFTR channel pore is lined by amino acid side chains coming from transmembrane segments (TMs) 6, 11 and 12. However, the relative alignment of these TMs, as well as their relative movements during channel opening and closing are still unknown. To gain three-dimensional structural information on the outer pore, we have studied cross-linking of introduced cysteine residues in the open and closed state. To do this, we mutated pore-lining residues from TM6 (R334, K335 and T338) and TM11/12 (S1118, T1121, T1122, G1127 and T1134) to create 15 cysteine pairs. Proximity of introduced cysteine pairs was determined by sensitivity to externally applied copper (II)-\u03bf-phenanthroline (CuPhe, which induces disulfide bond formation between cysteines) and dithiothreitol (DTT), and inhibition by external cadmium ions, by using whole cell patch clamp recording. We found that when applied to channels activated by forskolin, CuPhe led to a reduction in current amplitude in R334C/T1122C, R334C/G1127C and T338C/S1118C whereas it did not affect the other 12 cysteine pairs, suggesting that these three cysteine pairs are close together and able to form disulfide bonds rapidly in activated channels. We also observed that cadmium coordination occurred between R334C and G1127C and between R334C and T1122C, resulting in strong inhibition relative to single cysteine mutants. Since cross-linking or cadmium coordination by some pairs of cysteines may be possible only in the closed state or in the open state, we examined the state-dependence of CuPhe and cadmium inhibition of R334C/T1122C, R334C/G1127C and T338C/S1118C. In order to isolate the open state, we manipulated NBD function by introducing the E1371Q mutation (which increases channel open probability and slows channel closure). We observed that E1371Q prevented both spontaneous and CuPhe-induced cross-links as well as cadmium coordination between R334C and G1127C, suggesting that R334C and G1127C are close together only in closed channels. E1371Q did not prevent cross-linking or cadmium coordination between R334C and T1122C. Surprisingly, R334C/T1122C/E1371Q formed disulfide cross-links spontaneously, which indicates that R334C and T1122C are close together and able to form spontaneous cross-links in open channels. In the case of T338C/S1118C, E1371Q facilitated cross-linking and also strengthened cadmium inhibition, suggesting that cross-links and cadmium coordination occur preferentially in open channels, implying that T338C and S1118C are closer together in open channels. These results provide us new information on the threedimensional structure of outer mouth of the CFTR channel pore. R334 (TM6) is close to G1127 (TM11) in closed channels, and to T1122 (TM11) in open channels, while T338 (TM6) is close to S1118 (TM11) in open channels. Moreover, the altered relative location of residues in open and in closed channels that we infer allows us to propose that channel opening and closing may be associated with a relative translational movement of TMs 6 and 11, with TM6 moving \"down\" during channel opening.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, caused by mutations such as [\u2206F508] in the CFTR gene, which has a proinflammatory phenotype in the CF lung. This proinflammatory phenotype is due to intrinsic activation of the TNF\u03b1/NF\u03baB signaling pathway in infection-free CF lung epithelial cells, which drives expression of the neutrophil chemokine IL-8 (1-3). However, the mechanism(s) by which mutations in CFTR are accompanied by activation of this pathway are poorly understood. Independent of the CF condition, it is known that TNF\u03b1 binds to the TNFR1 in the plasma membrane, where it can initiate a sequence of phosphorylation-dependent activation steps, first involving the TNFR1 complex, then the IKK'some, and then the NF\u03baB complex. Finally, when I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated and degraded, NF\u03baB,p65 is free to localize into the nucleus, where it binds to the \u03baB site on the IL-8 promoter, This activates synthesis of IL-8 mRNA, and downstream translation into IL-8 protein. However, where (or whether) CFTR might interact with proteins in any of these activation steps remains a matter of conjecture.",

Using a confocal immunohistochemistry approach with CF cells, we found that both mutant and wt forms of CFTR co-localized with TNFR1, as well as other components of TNFR1 complex, in the ER. This interaction appeared to have functional consequences. For example, using a NF\u03baB-luciferase reporter construct in the HEK293 cell system, we found that both [wt] and [\u2206F508] CFTR could enhance TNF\u03b1-activated NF\u03baB activity. Consistently, we found that hyper-expression of either recombinant [\u2206F508] or recombinant [wt]CFTR delayed recovery of I\u03baB\u03b1 after degradation induced by TNF\u03b1, thus leaving NFkB,p65 available for further activation of inflammation. We also found that recombinant forms of both [\u2206F508] and [wt] CFTR could enhance the NF\u03baB luciferase activity that had been induced by any of the four canonical components of the TNFR1 Complex (viz, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2 and RIP). Finally, in the co-immuno-Both an NBD1 conformational defect and altered domain-domain interactions contribute to \u2206F508 CFTR misfolding, leading to severely compromised cell surface functional expression of the mutant CFTR. CFTR NBD1 is composed of an amino terminal, \u03b2-strand-rich \u03b2-subdomain and a carboxy terminal, \u03b1-helix-rich \u03b1-subdomain. F508 resides in the \u03b1-subdomain whereas the DAD endoplasmic reticulum exit code resides in the hinge linking the two subdomains. Using replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation (REMD), we show a temperature-dependent NBD1 misfolding as a result of the \u2206F508 mutation. Consistent with recent biophysical data, we observed a major change in \u03b1-subdomain orientation relative to the \u03b2-subdomain, which is characterized by: 1) altered DAD orientation; 2) a dislocated 509 GVS 511 loop, which is accompanied by V510 solvent exposure; and 3) transformation of the small helix 534 AEKDNIV 540 into a loop. By molecular docking of two known NBD1-binding small molecule correctors on native NBD1 and its various destabilizing conformations sampled by REMD, we identified a small molecule binding pocket in NBD1 which regulates NBD1 misfolding. Using fragment-based virtual screen and molecular design, we built a putative \u2206F508 corrector molecule. Twenty analogues were synthesized and tested for their ability to rescue \u2206F508 CFTR. We found that a number of these candidates improve the processing of \u2206F508 CFTR in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing \u2206F508 CFTR with an efficacy comparable to or above that of a known corrector CFFT VERT-325. While correctors CFNS-0 and CFNS-1 display similar effects on \u2206F508 CFTR processing in HEK293 cells, CFNS-1 dramatically enhances cAMP-induced iodide efflux from a CFBE cell line stably expressing \u2206F508 CFTR but CFNS-0 slightly inhibits it. As the small molecule binding pocket we identified on NBD1 is flanked by V510, a key residue for \u2206F508 rescue and in mediating NBD1-MSD2 interactions, our data point to the possibility that altering NBD1 conformation through small molecule correctors that bind to the identified pocket might simultaneously improve both NBD1 conformation and NBD1-MSD2 interaction, leading to more efficacious rescue. Presently, CFNS-1 is being tested on primary human bronchial epithelial cells from patients with \u2206F508 cystic fibrosis. Further development and optimization based on existing correctors might lead to the generation of highly efficacious small molecules that rescue \u2206F508 CFTR misfolding. VRT-534 (C-18) is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector made available through the CF Foundation for research purposes. We describe some in vitro characteristics of C-18 and the effect of its chiral centers on activity. Extensive medicinal chemistry and SAR analyses on VRT-768, an initial corrector hit, led to several distinct chemical scaffolds, one of which led to VRT-534. The two chiral centers of C-18 allow for four discrete stereoisomers. We studied the corrector activity of the various stereoisomers by monitoring chloride transport in Ussing chamber studies using cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells derived from patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. The chiral center in the benzylic position was found to display a profound effect on the potency. Thus, C-18 (S,R-configuration) was more potent (EC 50 =0.5 \u00b5M) than VRT-535 (R,R-configuration) which had an EC 50 =2.7 \u00b5M. Interestingly, the maximal efficacy of these diastereoisomers was similar. Changing the R-configuration of the hydroxypyrrolidine to S led to 3-fold decrease in potency. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a clear stereochemical preference for a CFTR corrector; this supports a specific interaction with the putative target. The in vitro potency and efficacy of C-18 render it a useful tool for research into CFTR correction.",

            "text": "Here, we further probe the mechanism by which 4PBA, through STAT3 and Elp2, stimulated Hsp70 expression. In our previous work, we demonstrated that 4PBA caused transient phosphorylation of STAT3 and translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus. Since Elp2 does not itself contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), we hypothesized that STAT3 activation/phophosrylation and STAT3's nuclear localization signal (NLS) is required to \"bring\" Elp2/Elongator into the nucleus. We tested this hypothesis using luciferase reporter assays where luciferase expression was controlled by the human Hsp70 promoter, and with overexpression STAT3 and mutant STAT3 constructs, including a constitutively active STAT3 (STAT-3C), STAT3-Y705F that inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT3-S727A that blocks serine phosphorylation. In control experiments in transfected IB3-1 CF bronchiolar epithelial cells similar to our published data (Suaud, et al, JBC, 2011), 4PBA increased Hsp70 promoter driven luciferase expression 1.5-2 fold, and siRNA mediated depletion of Elp2 decreased this luciferase expression by 50% in both cases. Overexpression of WT STAT3 or STAT3C also increased luciferase expression, but did not reverse the effect of Elp2 depletion on Hsp70 promoter function, further suggesting that Elp2 has a major role in regulating Hsp70 expression. Interestingly, transfection of STAT3-S727A also increased luciferase expression to a similar extent as WT STAT3, and transfection of STAT3-Y705F increased luciferase reporter expression to a 2-fold greater extent than WT or STAT3-S727A. Again, these effects were diminished by siRNA-mediated depletion of Elp2. In control experiments, all of these mutant STAT3's maintained the ability to interact with Elp2 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These data suggest that the phosphorylation state of STAT3 is not relevant to the STAT3/Elp2 regulation of Hsp70 expression in response to 4PBA. These data also suggest that testing if the NLS motif of STAT3 is a critical component of the regulation of Hsp70 expression by Elp2/STAT3 in response to 4PBA is warranted.",

            "text": "Supported by grant R01 DK-58046 During CFTR synthesis, heat shock proteins of 70 kDa (Hsp70 and Hsc70), together with their cochaperones, play a key role in deciding whether newly synthesized CFTR successfully traffics to the plasma membrane or is targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. One of the best understood cochaperones in this process is CHIP, a U-boxcontaining ubiquitin E3 ligase that binds the C-terminus of Hsp/c70 via its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif. Once bound, CHIP recruits the E2 enzyme UbcH5a into the Hsc70-CFTR complex and thereby initiates CFTR ubiquitination. Previously we showed that the length of time that Hsc70 remains bound to CFTR during a given binding cycle is a major determinant of Hsc70-stimulated degradation, i.e. longer binding favors ubiquitination (Matsumura et al, Mol. Biol. Cell, 2011). These findings raise the possibility that by preventing Hsc70-CHIP interactions it might be possible to stabilize CFTR at the ER membrane and thereby increase the pool of band-B CFTR available for potential export through the secretory pathway. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which Hsc70 binding to substrate coordinates CHIP-client recognition is not well understood.",

            "text": "To determine where in the catalytic cycle of Hsc70 CHIP acts, we used a dominant negative CHIP mutant (P269A), which lacks a conserved proline in the U-box domain required for E3 ligase activity. CFTR was synthesized in a cell-free system that reconstitutes ubiquitination, membrane extraction and ER associated degradation (ERAD), but lacks transcriptional activity and therefore allows manipulation of ERAD components without activating cellular compensatory mechanisms. In this system, addition of recombinant CHIP had minimal effect on CFTR degradation, whereas P269A CHIP inhibited CFTR ubiquitination and degradation in a dose dependent manner. As expected, both the TPR and mutant U-box domains were required for this inhibitory effect. The concentration of mutant CHIP required for 50% inhibition of CFTR degradation was comparable to endogenous Hsc70 (2.5\u00b5M versus ~2 \u00b5M, respectively), and addition of wild type CHIP, Hsc70, and UbcH5a largely restored CFTR degradation. Thus, P269A CHIP does not simply compete with wild-type CHIP for Hsc70, but rather acts at the level of Hsc70 binding. Interestingly, P269A CHIP did not detectably change CFTR association with Hsc70 or the duration of the Hsc70-CFTR binding cycle. However, the U-box mutation substantially increased CHIP binding to the ADP-bound Hsc70-client complex. These results suggest that reciprocal allosteric interactions between the TPR and U-box domains of CHIP and the substrate-binding and C-terminal domains of Hsc70 regulate the affinity and/or duration of the Hsc70-CHIP complex, which in turn defines protein triage. (Supported by CFFT, NIH, and the Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation.) The primary biochemical defect in most CF patients is caused by misfolding and subsequent degradation of \u2206F508 CFTR. Phe508 is located in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR, where its absence decreases NBD1 folding efficiency (in cells), and thermodynamic stability (in vitro). An important goal in CF therapeutics, therefore, is to understand how NBD1 acquires and maintains its folded state in the cellular environment and to devise pharmacological strategies to improve folding efficiency. To address this problem we developed a FRET-based method to define the NBD1 folding pathway as the nascent chain is synthesized in a cell free extract (Khushoo et al, Mol. Cell. 2011). Our approach is based on the principle that two complementary fluorophores incorporated at specific sites in a nascent protein are brought into close proximity as the domain folds into its native state. Such a change can be detected by an increased efficiency of energy transfer between fluorophores as nascent chain length is increased.",

            "text": "Using this system we showed that NBD1 folding is initiated by compaction of an N-terminal ATP-binding subdomain (residues 389-495), followed by alpha-subdomain folding (residues 495-565) and lastly, formation of the central \u03b1/\u03b2 core containing a six stranded largely parallel \u03b2-sheet (residues 567-~650). The ability to monitor NBD1 folding directly on the ribosome is appealing because these complexes are easily generated in vitro, require little purification, and allow one to access folding intermediates that exist only transiently during CFTR synthesis. Thus they provide a potential means to pharmacologically manipulate the cotranslational folding pathway. While cell free translation systems enable quantitative incorporation of fluorescent probes with extraordinary specificity and selectivity, the concentration of protein obtained from stalled ribosomes is exceedingly low (~1nM). This poses significant challenges to identify small molecules that might promote NBD1 stability or folding efficiency. Miniaturization of this system to monitor folding on a solid support would therefore be a major advantage in extending this system for screening purposes. Towards this goal, we have investigated strategies to affinity capture in vitro-synthesized fluorescently labeled NBD1. Preliminary results demonstrate that as little as 10-100 attomole (10 -18 mole) of protein immobilized on agarose beads can be readily detected by fluorescence microscopy. This signal is amenable to quantitative photobleaching, thus providing a potential means to measure FRET and hence monitor NBD1 folding on a large scale from a single translation reaction. Studies are underway to further optimize nascent chain capture, validate FRET measurements, and examine nascent chain folding properties in this solid state system.

S-Nitrosothiols (SNOs) are endogenous nitrosonium (NO + ) donors with several cell signaling effects and potential relevance to human lung disease. Biochemical evidence suggests that SNOs act on post-translational protein modifications through mechanisms involving S-nitrosylation reactions. Airway epithelial S-nitrosylation signaling disorders have been observed in a wide range of diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). SNOs are normally present in the human airway, but concentrations tend to be low in CF patients. This is likely attributable to up-regulated S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) activity. GSNOR is an enzyme that up-regulates nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiol homeostasis through catabolism of GSNO in tissues and is widely expressed in many tissues, including the lungs. Loss of endogenous GSNOR activity increases cellular NO levels and bioactivities, including CFTR maturation in airway epithelial cells. Previously, we have shown that different SNOs increase the expression, maturation and function of CFTR in polarized and non-polarized human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cells (Mol. Pharmacol. 70: [1435] [1436] [1437] [1438] [1439] [1440] [1441] [1442] 2006 ). Our studies have indicated that the effect of SNO on CFTR maturation may be mediated through the degradation of Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein (Hop), a cochaperone of the major molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90. We have recently shown that GSNO treatment decreases Hop expression and Hop-CFTR interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum of HBAE cells, and that this effect is necessary for the maturation and cell-surface expression of CFTR. We have also determined that SNOs affect Hop expression by S-nitrosylation of cysteine residue C403. Mutation of this residue to C403S prevents GSNO-induced Hop degradation and S-nitrosylation (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107: [11393] [11394] [11395] [11396] [11397] [11398] 2010) . We showed that GSNOR activity is significantly elevated in the mutant HBAE cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR when compared to the wild type HBAE cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated the cellular co-localization of Hop and GSNOR in CFBE41o-cells by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. From this experiment, it appears that GSNOR and Hop interact directly. More recently, we were able to demonstrate that GSNOR knockdown with GSNOR siRNA duplexes increases expression of \u2206F508 CFTR and also decreases Hop expression. At present, we seek to determine whether increasing levels of endogenous GSNOR lead to lower CFTR expression. We also tested the effect of GSNOR inhibitor on CFTR maturation. We transfected HBAE cells with 1 and 2 \u00b5M FLAGtagged GSNOR using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48h of transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed directly on plates using lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. IB analysis was performed using an anti-CFTR monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, cells transfected with FLAG-tagged GSNOR caused a dose-dependent decrease in maturation of CFTR and GSNOR inhibitor reversed the effect. This data suggests that GSNOR inhibitors could potentially become an attractive therapeutic target for CF. This research is supported by CF Foundation and the NIH.",

We found that metrics for correction correlate across multiple compound classes between the conductance and Ussing assays. Our data indicate that this conductance assay may serve as a medium throughput bridge from the HTS flux assay to the Ussing Previous work showed that in the presence of AMP (adenosine 5'monophosphate) CFTR channel activity was coupled to adenylate kinase activity (ATP+AMP\u00c42 ADP). The adenylate kinase inhibitor Ap 5 A (P 1 ,P 5di(adenosine-5\u2032) pentaphosphate) inhibited current. Inhibition was attenuated by increasing the ATP concentration or by adding AMP (1) . Ap 5 A contains two adenosine groups (1 and 2) connected by five phosphate groups allowing it to bind simultaneously to an ATP and an AMP binding-site of an adenylate kinase. While it is well established where ATP interacts with CFTR and other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, the AMP bindingsite of CFTR has remained elusive. Two other ABC proteins, the DNA repair enzyme Rad50 (2) and a structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein, are also known to interact with AMP and to exhibit adenylate kinase activity. The crystal structure of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of the Pyrococcus furiosus SMC protein in complex with Ap 5 A (3) showed the two adenosine moieties of Ap 5 A attached to two binding sites separated by ~15\u00c5. A Mg 2+ ion, adenosine 1, plus \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-phosphates of Ap 5 A bind the canonical Mg 2+ -ATP-binding site on lobe I of the SMC NBD. Adenosine 2 stacks onto the side chain of a conserved glutamine of the Q-loop at the interface of lobe I and lobe II. Based on this structure we hypothesized that the homologous glutamine in CFTR, Q1291, would interact with Ap 5 A. To test this hypothesis we studied the effect of single amino acid substitutions of Q1291 on Ap 5 A inhibition of CFTR currents and CFTR photolabeling with [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A, a photoactivatable analogue of Ap 4 A (P 1 ,P 4 -di(adenosine-5\u2032) tetraphosphate), which also inhibits CFTR current in a similar manner as Ap 5 A. We found that substitution with phenylalanine (F), an amino acid with a larger and bulkier side chain, interfered with Ap 5 A inhibition without affecting the potency of ATP to stimulate current or changing the single channel opening and closing rates in the presence of ATP. When we eliminated the Q1291 side chain by substitution to glycine we observed again current inhibition by Ap 5 A and photolabeling with [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A. However, the apparent K i of Ap 5 A to inhibit current increased. In summary, our data suggest that Q1291 interacts with Ap 5 A but it does not directly interact with ATP. Thus, Q1291 may be part of the AMPbinding site. Identifying key amino acids that are involved in the interaction of Ap 5 A and AMP with CFTR may aid development of new treatments for CFTR-related diseases, like cystic fibrosis or cholera-toxin induced secretory diarrhea.",

A second-generation corrector screen was developed and implemented based on the emerging paradigm that \u2206F508-CFTR misfolding is the consequence of two or more distinct structural defects, such as NBD1 misfolding and impaired domain-domain interactions. The principle of this approach is to screen for compounds in the presence of a known corrector (with reasonably established mechanism as a pharmacological chaperone) or second site mutations (that stabilize NBD1 or the NBD1-MSD2 interface), with the goal of identifying compounds whose additive or synergistic effects can restore \u2206F508-CFTR surface targeting and function close to that of wildtype CFTR. CFBE41o-cells (a CF human bronchial epithelium-derived cell line homozygous for the \u2206F508 mutation) were transduced with lentiviral particles encoding human \u2206F508-CFTR containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in its fourth extracellular loop, controlled by a tetracycline-activated transactivator. \u2206F508-CFTR-HRP was ER-retained under control conditions, but corrected by low-temperature and pharmacological/chemical chaperones including VX-809. The screening assay utilized a robust luminescence read-out of extracellular HRP activity as a measure of \u2206F508-CFTR cell surface expression. Incubation with VX-809 for 24 h at 37\u00b0C gave a ~5-fold increase in luminescence signal with maximum correction at 3 \u00b5M VX-809, which was comparable to that of low temperature rescue (27\u00b0C for 24 h). Initial screening was done using collections of ~4000 approved/investigational drugs and ~15000 synthetic small molecules. More than ten active compounds were identified that gave >50% increase in lumi-nescence signal over that of VX-809. Several potentially interesting drugs/compounds emerged, including the anti-inflammatory suprofen, the anti-hypertensive drug enalapril, the PDE inhibitor zaprinast, and the antiinflammatory meclofenamate. The additivity of effects suggests distinct corrector mechanisms that may involve individual targets, which will be elucidated using biochemical and genetic assays. Second generation corrector screening based on synergy, may yield novel corrector combinations with high efficacy.",

The thermodynamic stability of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR is closely linked with the overall stability of CFTR. Mutations which destabilize NBD1, such as deletion of F508, also destabilize the full-length molecule and lead to processing and gating defects. Thus, the mechanism by which F508 destabilizes NBD1 is directly related to the pathology. Structural studies show that the F508del mutation has only a minor effect on the structure of the ground state of NBD1. Using NMR relaxation experiments we have previously shown that fast timescale (ns-ps) dynamics of the ground state of NBD1 are very similar in the WT, F508del and I539T variants, corroborating the structural studies. The similarity in the pattern of fast dynamics for the three variants indicates that dynamical changes to the ground state of NBD1 do not provide an explanation for deleterious effects of the F508 deletion. However, our NMR dispersion studies show that deletion of F508 increases intermediate timescale (ms-\u00b5s) sampling of an excited state, which might be responsible for inefficient processing of the channel. Similarly, published thermal unfolding transition midpoints for NBD1 are significantly above 37\u00b0C, while low temperature rescue of CFTR requires temperatures below 37\u00b0C, apparently improving even below 26\u00b0C, supporting the idea that defective processing involves an excited state, as recently proposed. Temperature dependent changes in sampling of an excited state may be more directly relevant to understanding misfolding of CFTR than the overall stability of the domain. The nature of the excited state(s) is currently unknown, though hypothesized to involve the \u03b1subdomain. We will show results of residue specific hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments aimed at identifying regions of NBD1 that sample amide exchange competent excited state conformations. Together these studies provide insight into the NBD1's energy landscape and yield critical clues into the nature of excited state(s) relevant to channel processing and gating defects. This work was supported by the CF Foundation Therapeutics. Previously, we have demonstrated the role of PDZ-domain containing protein CAL and its associated proteins in the regulation of the abundance of complex-glycosylated, mature CFTR. We have shown that CAL and the Qbc-type N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (Qbc-SNARE) protein syntaxin 6 (STX6) form a complex and both proteins bind to CFTR. Manipulation of either CAL or STX6 abundance and function by overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediates silencing in multiple cell lines, defining their role as negative regulators of stability of mature CFTR. Recently, we identified the membrane associated ring CH (MARCH) E3 Ubiquitin ligase II (MARCH II) as part of the CAL-complex. Overexpression of MARCH II but not a catalytic dead mutant led to increased ubiquitination of CFTR. Ubiquitination plays a critical role in targeting misfolded CFTR to degradation in both ER and peripheral quality control systems. Overexpression of MARCH II led to dose-dependent degradation of mature CFTR, while silencing of endogenous MARCH II increased the abundance of mature CFTR. Immunoprecipitation of MARCH II brought down CAL, STX6 and CFTR. Furthermore, degradation of CFTR by MARCH II requires the presence of CAL as well as the PDZ motif of CFTR. MARCH II has no effect on ER-localized delta F508 CFTR. Treatment of a HeLa cell line stably expressing delta F508-CFTR with CFTR corrector C18 for 24 hours led to the appearance of mature CFTR. Overexpression of MARCH II led to degradation of C18-rescued CFTR. Importantly, silencing of endogenous MARCH II increased the abundance of rescued CFTR. Taken together, these data suggest that as a part of CAL-complex MARCH II plays an important role in CAL-mediated degradation of mature CFTR, and manipulation of MARCH II levels can influence the effect of CFTR correctors in rescuing delta F508 CFTR. Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. We previously developed and applied fluorescence, cell-based highthroughput screening to identify inhibitors and activators of wildtype CFTR, potentiators and correctors of \u2206F508-CFTR, and inhibitors and activators of CaCCs including TMEM16A. Motivated by the relatively high efficiency and low cost of microfluidics (lab-on-a-chip) technology, here we developed fluorescence, cell-based microfluidics platforms for discovery and characterization of chloride channel modulators, focusing on inhibitors and activators of CFTR and TMEM16A. As done for platereader-based screening, the microfluidics assay utilized FRT cells stably expressing CFTR or TMEM16A together with the iodide-sensing, genetically encoded fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q/I152L/F46L. A multiplexed microfluidics platform was developed for single-shot determination of full concentrationactivity relations in which a 5 x 5 mm square area of adherent cultured cells was exposed for 5-10 min to a pseudo-logarithmic gradient of test compound generated by iterative, two-component channel mixing. Cell fluorescence was imaged following perfusion with an iodide-containing solution to give iodide influx rate at each point in the image field, thus quantifying modulator effects over a wide range of concentrations in a single measurement. IC 50 determined for CFTR and TMEM16A modulators by single-shot microfluidics were in close agreement with conventional platereader measurements. For automated compound screening, a microdroplet-based approach was developed in which cells together with test compound were incubated in a stable aqueous droplet surrounded by oil, and then fused with an iodide-containing droplet to rapidly establish an iodide gradient. Iodide influx was determined from the time course of droplet fluorescence following fusion as measured using an intensifier/CCD camera with submillisecond resolution. The droplet microfluidics platform was validated using known CFTR and TMEM16A modulators. Our results establish microfluidics-based technology for chloride channel drug discovery, which, compared to conventional methods, could reduce costs and increase efficiency. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which codes for a highly regulated apical chloride channel of airway epithelial cells. The most common mutation in CF is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (\u2206F508), which results in a misfolded protein that does not reach the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. Rescue of surface expression of \u2206F508 CFTR by treatment with small-molecule correctors is an important therapeutic approach for improving the quality of life of CF patients. Recent studies revealed that \u2206F508 CFTR rescue efficiency is dependent on the cell model. We study the efficacy of small-molecule cor-rector compounds in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures grown at air-liquid interface as a physiological system that recapitulates the morphology of the human airway epithelium. Viral expression of extracellularly tagged \u2206F508 CFTR was used to visualize turnover of apical \u2206F508 CFTR by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and to quantify \u2206F508 CFTR that has reached the apical membrane by On-Cell Western (Cholon et al. 2010 Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol., 298:L304-14). Western blotting of whole-cell lysates and short circuit current measurements in Ussing chambers were used to characterize rescue of endogenous corrector-treated \u2206F508 CFTR in HAE cultures. We found that small-molecule corrector compounds, such as VX-809, can restore some apical \u2206F508 CFTR function and that various combinations of corrector compounds can act synergistically. However, trafficking studies of corrector-rescued \u2206F508 CFTR show that the rescued mutant protein is less stable at the cell surface and has a significantly shorter half-life than wild-type CFTR. Once internalized, wild-type CFTR is efficiently recycled back to the cell surface while rescued \u2206F508 CFTR is targeted for lysosomal degradation. Application of the specific inhibitors of dynamin-or clathrin-dependent internalization, Dyngo-4a and Pitstop 2, respectively, further increased the efficiency of corrector rescue. Attenuation of cellular lipid levels, such as cholesterol extraction by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, or inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis by miglustat, also enhanced the corrector rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR by augmenting the amount of mutant protein at the surface. Because cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR were shown to accumulate cholesterol, and high cholesterol levels appear to be of disadvantage for rescued \u2206F508 CFTR stability, lowering cholesterol levels may be an effective approach for increasing the amount of \u2206F508 CFTR at the surface of airway epithelial cultures. Successful small-molecule rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR in HAE cultures requires restoration of protein stability and re-establishment of proper trafficking to increase steady-state abundance and ion channel function. Because normal lung function requires sufficient amounts of functional CFTR at the cell surface, data obtained from these studies are directly relevant for improving treatments for CF patients.",

Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), a cytokine that modifies cystic fibrosis lung disease severity, is present at high concentrations in human semen. Since cystic fibrosis is commonly associated with male infertility, experiments were conducted to examine the impact of TGF-\u03b21 on cultured PVD9902 epithelial cells that were derived from porcine vas deferens. In modified Ussing-style flux chambers, PVD9902 monolayers exposed to TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml, 24 hr) exhibited a reduced forskolin-stimulated elevation in short circuit current (Isc). TGF-\u03b21 exposure also decreased Isc induced by a cell permeable cAMP analog. The effect of DASU-02, a selective CFTR inhibitor, on forskolin-stimulated Isc was reduced by TGF-\u03b21. Together these results suggest that TGF-\u03b21 impairs cAMP-mediated anion secretion across vas deferens epithelia by affecting a target downstream from cAMP generation. RT-PCR revealed that TGF-\u03b21 reduced the abundance of mRNA coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Biotinylation and Western blot analysis revealed that TGF-\u03b21 reduced both total CFTR and apical cell surface CFTR expression. Attenuation of the forskolin response by TGF-\u03b21 was fully abrogated in the presence of TGF-\u03b21 receptor inhibitor SB431542. Further, SKF86002, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, reduced the effect of TGF-\u03b21 on forskolin-stimulated anion secretion as well as CFTR mRNA abundance, while anisomycin, an activator of p38 MAPK, mimicked the effect of TGF-\u03b21 on the forskolin response. These data derived from cultured porcine vas deferens epithelial cells, indicate that TGF-\u03b21 binds to its cognate receptor to activate the p38 MAPK pathway and down-regulate CFTR expression, ultimately attenuating anion secretion, which is expected to comprise male fertility. Similar effects on CFTR expression may occur in other epithelial tissues. [NIH HD058398 and RR017686.] CFTR is known to interact with several members of the solute carrier 26 (SLC26A) family of anion channels. Previously, we demonstrated that SLC26A9, which is expressed in lung and gastrointestinal epithelial cells, exhibits chloride channel-like properties. Co-expression of SLC26A9 and wtCFTR in HEK293 cells produced both constitutive currents and enhanced currents stimulated by cAMP/PKA, suggestive of a coordinated regulation between these channels. A physical interaction was also shown using coimmunoprecipitation assays (J Gen Physiol. 2009 Apr;133 (4):421-38). Both CFTR and SLC26A9 contain Class 1 PDZ motifs, which have been proposed to facilitate their interaction by tethering these proteins in close proximity via interactions with PDZ domain proteins. CFTR is known to be regulated by two PDZ domain proteins: CFTR-associated ligand (CAL) and Na + /H + Exchanger Regulatory Factor (NHERF). The half-life and activity of CFTR in the plasma membrane was observed to be reduced by CAL mediated lysosomal degradation, and enhanced by its interaction with NHERF at the plasma membrane (J Biol Chem 2002 Feb 1; 277(5):3520-9). In the present study, we examined the role of PDZ interactions on SLC26A9 expression and function, as well as its interaction with CFTR. In order to examine the role of the PDZ binding motif in SLC26A9, the essential threonine at residue 789 was replaced with alanine by site directed mutagenesis. Using a biotinylation assay, HEK cells expressing SLC26A9 T789A alone showed a significant increase in the expression of the channel in the plasma membrane, compared with wt SLC26A9 expressing HEK cells. Co-expression of SLC26A9 T789A with wtCFTR showed a similar increase in plasma membrane expression of SLC26A9 T789A compared to cells coexpressing wtCFTR with SLC26A9; however, the expression of CFTR at the plasma membrane was not significantly altered. The enhanced plasma membrane abundance of SLC26A9 T789A co-expressed with wtCFTR correlated with a significant increase in the constitutive current, using whole cell patch clamp recordings (-27 \u00b1 3 pA/pF, n=6, SLC26A9 T789A, vs. -17 \u00b1 3, n = 8, SLC26A9, p<0.05), while the response to cAMP/PKA stimulation was unaffected (-189 \u00b1 61 pA/pF, CFTR+SLC26A9 T789A, vs. -236 \u00b1 32 pA/pF, CFTR+SLC26A9), consistent with the biotinylation results. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed an interaction between SLC26A9 and CAL. We propose that the enhanced cell surface abundance and function of SLC26A9 T789A is due to the disruption of its interaction with the PDZ domain protein CAL, which otherwise leads to its lysosomal degradation. In addition, maintenance of the enhanced response to cAMP/PKA stimulation suggests that, with its sufficiently high level of plasma membrane expression, SLC26A9 T789A maintains its functional interaction with wtCFTR in the absence of PDZ domain protein interactions, as has been previously shown for other SLC26A family members (Nature Cell Bio 2004 6(4):343).",

            "text": "Understanding the mode of action of CFTR modulator compounds is key for optimization of CF therapeutics as well as obtaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of CFTR function and misfunction. We have utilized NMR and differential scanning calorimetry to probe the potential direct binding of a number of CFTR modulator compounds to the isolated human CFTR NBD1 (\u2206RI\u2206RE), with both the otherwise wild-type and the F508del mutation. We have previously demonstrated direct binding of CFFT-001, a dual acting corrector-potentiator, to NBD1. Chemical shift changes observed in NMR spectra provide evidence of CFFT-001 binding to the surface of \u03b2-strands S3, S9 and S10 of NBD1 and displacing the transiently engaged C-terminal helices H8 and H9, leading to loss of their helicity. Binding to CFFT-001 also leads to a negative Tm shift or decrease in melting temperature for NBD1, consistent with binding to the NBD1 core and disruption of the C-terminal helices. Recent sequence analysis indicated that the C-terminal strands of NBD1, S9 and S10, are conserved in a CFTR-specific manner. Taken together with our previous work on phosphoregulation of NBD1 interactions with the R region, these results suggest that the S3, S9, S10 surface may be responsible for critical regulatory interactions with helices H8 and H9 and the R region and support this locus as a binding site for a CFTR-specific modulator compound. We have used this experimental data to now generate a docking model for CFFT-001, requiring enhanced sampling REMD simulations to open up the binding site. These simulations are consistent with binding to an excited state of NBD1. A model was proposed for CFFT-001 binding in which reduction of H8 and H9 interactions facilitated removal of the R region from the NBD1 surface including the heterodimer interface, enhancing NBD1:NBD2 interactions and thus the efficiency of gating and folding. Analysis of chemical shifts in NMR spectra upon binding of CFFT-001 now reveal long-range allosteric effects, potentially also contributing to the effect of the CFTR modulator. Results of ongoing studies to probe the similarities and differences in effects of direct binding of other CFTR modulators, including C18, will be reported.

            "text": "Wang, X.; Frizzell, R.A.; Bertrand, C.A. Cell Biology, University of Pittsburgh, school of medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Several members of the SLC26A family of anion transporters have been found to associate with CFTR and participate in a coordinated regulation of both CFTR function and SLC26A activity. Since the different SLC26A family members show significant diversity in function, substrate, and tissue specificity, their coordinated regulation by CFTR may confer the unique anion permeability characteristics of the different organs that are affected by CF. We previously characterized the activity of SLC26A9, and its coordinated regulation by wt CFTR (J Gen Physiol 133:421 2009), using the whole cell patch clamp method in HEK293 cells and human bronchial epithelia. In these studies, SLC26A9 interacted with wt CFTR to enhance both constitutive and cAMP/PKA-stimulated chloride secretion. SLC26A9 expressed alone or with wtCFTR resulted in a constitutive current of -22 \u00b1 6 pA/pF (n=9). During cAMP/PKA activation, cells expressing SLC26A9 plus wtCFTR exhibited a peak current of -311 \u00b1 39 pA/pF (n = 11), compared to -214 \u00b1 38 pA/pF (n=21) for cells expressing wt CFTR alone. In the present study, we utilized excised, inside-out patch clamp methods to determine whether SLC26A9-CFTR interactions modulate the single channel properties of CFTR. In transiently transfected CHO cells expressing wt CFTR alone, single channel deflections with a conductance of 9 \u00b1 1.02 pS (n=25) were observed, consistent with previous studies of wtCFTR. In cells coexpressing SLC26A9 with wtCFTR, the observed single channel conductance was primarily 12 \u00b1 1.1 pS (n=23) following activation of CFTR by PKA + ATP (2mM). No evidence for two populations of channel events was observed, suggesting that this conductance increase was due to CFTR itself. In order to confirm this, a construct consisting of the STAS domain and PDZ motif of SLC26A9 was expressed, and whole cell patch clamp confirmed that this STAS domain construct did not result in a constitutive current. When this STAS domain construct was co-expressed with wt CFTR, the observed single channel conductance upon PKA + ATP activation increased to 11.5 \u00b1 1.1 pS (n=10). These findings suggest that the STAS domain of SLC26A9, in association with CFTR, increased its single channel conductance, as did expression of the full-length SLC26A9. Interestingly, the higher conductance state of CFTR observed in the presence of SLC26A9 showed reduced sensitivity to CFI172 inhibition, from 90 \u00b1 5% (n=4) to 72 \u00b1 7% (n=11; p<0.01). A similar reduction in CFI172 inhibition has been observed in whole cell patch experiments. Under the conditions utilized in these experiments, single channel deflections uniquely associated with SLC26A9 were not observed. At this time, it is not clear whether the single channel conductance of SLC26A9 is significantly less than CFTR, or whether additional co-factors required for SLC26A9 function are lost with patch excision. We conclude that the interaction of the STAS domain of SLC26A9 with wt CFTR increases the single channel conductance of CFTR. This increased conductance may account for the increase in the cAMP/PKAstimulated chloride secretion observed in whole cell experiments. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The major impact of F508del, the most common CFTR variant, is the inability of the protein to fold properly and thus being intracellularly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Indeed, the ER quality control (ERQC) recognizes incorrect folding of F508del-CFTR and sends it to early degradation, thus preventing it from trafficking to the cellular membrane. CFTR biogenesis involves protein interactions that assist in CFTR folding, but can also initiate its degradation when the folded state is not achieved. Prior studies have implicated 14-3-3 proteins in the forward trafficking or cell surface stability of ion channels and receptors through interactions with phosphorylated motifs or by shielding ER retention motifs (RXR) as in prior K channel studies. CFTR contains RXR and kinase phosphorylation sites that serve as candidates for 14-3-3 protein interactions. We previously have shown high expression of 14-3-3 \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b5 isoforms in airway cells, and further, that physical and functional interactions between 14-3-3 and CFTR (both bands B and C) involve the Nterminus and R domain as shown in pairwise binding studies, the latter increased by R region phosphorylation 1 . Additionally our data indicate that 14-3-3 binding and CFTR expression are enhanced by PKA stimulation. We therefore are currently examining the 14-3-3/CFTR interactions in phospho-sites and RXR motif mutants. Preliminary results show that the impact of 14-3-3\u03b2 overexpression is lost when it is co-expressed with phospho-site mutants of CFTR. Conversely RXR mutants remain sensitive to the action of 14-3-3\u03b2 to increase CFTR biogenesis. These data suggest that the major effect of 14-3-3 proteins to increase CFTR expression stems from their interaction with phospho-sites in the R region rather than RXR sites. We are at this time looking at individual interaction sites to determine what role 14-3-3 proteins play in CFTR biogenesis and potentially in its stability at the plasma membrane. Understanding the role of 14-3-3 proteins in the processing of WT and F508del-CFTR should identify novel targets for therapeutic modulation of CFTR biogenesis. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, leading to loss of function and changes in the ion and fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. Like other members of the ABC transporter family, CFTR contains two membrane spanning domains (MSDs) and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The formation of an NBD1/NBD2 heterodimer drives channel opening. The coupling helices at the base of the intracellular domains (ICLs) couple the NBDs to the MSDs of the channel. How are changes on the heterodimer interface transmitted across NBD1 to ICLs? The sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy reveals how the ICL4 binding site of NBD1 is allosterically linked to its heterodimer interface. Titration of an ICL4 \"coupling helix\" peptide led to chemical shift changes at the predicted binding site near the alpha-subdomain of NBD1, as well as in residues of the C-terminal NBD1 helices 8 and 9 (H8/H9), consistent with their destabilization and release from the NBD1 core via an allosteric mechanism. In addition, correlated chemical shifts were observed for residues near the RI-deletion site. We hypothesize that perturbations in one of these correlated regions should cause a reciprocal change in another region. F508del, a CF-causing mutation in the alpha-subdomain, reduces the effects of ICL4 binding on H8/H9. In contrast, F508del-suppressor mutations, F494N and V510D, increase these effects. Helix 8 mutation, Q637R (also a F508del-suppressor), increases the binding effects in the ICL4 binding site. Q637R also alters the dynamics in this region, suggesting that the internal motions of NBD1 are involved in transmitting changes across this plastic domain. The destabilization and release of H8/H9 from the heterodimer interface is strikingly similar to that of the regulatory extension (RE) and R region, which follow helix 9 and become more disordered and less bound to NBD1 upon phosphorylation. The RE and R region regulate NBD dimerization and, ultimately, channel opening and closing. The allosteric effects provide insight into how changes in the dimerization interface may be communicated to the rest of CFTR. This work was supported by the CF Foundation. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) must reside in the apical plasma membrane to perform its primary function as a chloride channel that mediates cAMP-dependent salt and water secretion in epithelial cells. The significance of CFTR's involvement in fluid secretion is evidenced by the most common mutation, F508del, which produces CF disease because the misfolded protein is unable to leave the endoplasmic reticulum. Airway disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in CF, so we chose to investigate apical membrane CFTR trafficking in Calu-3 cells, an airway serous cell model that expresses endogenous CFTR. Data from several laboratories have suggested that not all CFTR goes directly into the membrane from the protein secretory pathway but is retained in a subapical vesicle population that can be mobilized to the membrane upon stimulation. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are known to be responsible for donor/acceptor membrane trafficking and compartment specificity through interactions of vesicle-and target-SNAREs. We examined the expression of the t-SNAREs, syntaxins 1-4, in Calu-3 cells and identified the expression of syntaxins 2 and 4. In primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures, we detected syntaxins 3 and 4. To our surprise, in Calu-3 and HBE cells, we did not detect syntaxin 1A, either by PCR analysis of RNA or by immunoblot for protein analysis, although this syntaxin has been implicated as a negative regulator of CFTR trafficking and activity. Syntaxin 4 and CFTR interacted as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and both co-localized in the apical membrane by indirect immunofluorescence. When RNA from both proteins was co-injected into Xenopus oocytes, CFTR Clcurrents were doubled in contrast to oocytes expressing CFTR alone. Biotinylation experiments showed that cells subjected to cAMP stimulation by forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) exhibited greater quantities of CFTR in the plasma membrane. Using adenovirus-mediated transduction of Calu-3 cells together with functional assays measuring 6-methoxy-N-(3sulfopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ) fluorescence, we demonstrated that the knockdown of syntaxin 4 expression reduced forskolin-stimulated anion efflux compared with cells expressing EGFP alone. These data suggest that syntaxin 4 mediates the insertion of CFTR into the apical membranes of Calu-3 cells to control its apical density and the magnitude of stimulated anion efflux. [ Advances in CF therapeutic research have been hampered by the lack of information about the conformational changes that CFTR undergoes during its gating cycle. Here, we present a new all-atom structural model of the ATP-free conformation of CFTR that is based on homology modeling using the experimentally-determined structure of P-glycoprotein, a closely related mammalian ABC transporter, as a template. We believe that this inward-facing model, which is supported by experimental data, corresponds to the closed state of the CFTR channel, and is notably different from prior homology models of nucleotide-bound CFTR that have been proposed to represent the putative open state conformation. In addition, we performed targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations to explore the conformational transition pathway between these putative end states. Our simulations reveal that the gating transition is initiated by conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR, consistent with the notion that ATP binding regulates the CFTR gating cycle. Analysis of the TMD trajectory also identifies important translation and rotation motions of helices in the transmembrane domain that alter the pore structure of the CFTR mol- P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) (MDR1, ABCB1) is a transmembrane protein, clinically important due to its role as a multidrug resistance efflux transporter. Like CFTR, it is a full transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of proteins. As with most other ABC transporters, P-gp is hypothesized to operate under an alternating access mechanism, transitioning between inward-and outward-facing states during its transport cycle. Molecular models of the outward-facing conformation of human P-gp have previously been constructed by homology modeling using the nucleotide-bound structure of a related bacterial ABC transporter, Sav1866, as a template. The subsequent release of an inward-facing, nucleotide-free crystal structure of murine P-gp has made it possible to investigate the conformational transitions that accompany the transport cycle of this protein. In this study, we performed targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations between the inward-and outward-facing states to model the transport cycle of human P-gp as it exists in the membrane. Our simulations provide insights into the order and relative importance of conformational changes in various structural domains within the protein, and analysis of changes in the pore structure during the gating cycle provides evidence for the alternating access hypothesis of transport in P-gp. Furthermore, pore analysis also indicates a possible pathway through which the translocation cycle of a typical ABC transporter may be modified to lock the pore open at both ends, thereby enabling the channel activity seen uniquely in CFTR. (Support: NIH-DK056481 to N ) have shown that specific substitutions of residues in two of these TMEs have profound effects on channel activity, increasing Po and changing ATP dependence. We have studied six mutations in four different TMEs that had somewhat similar effects on gating accompanied by substantially decreased single channel conductance relative to the wild-type. For some of these variants, the unitary conductances were reduced by as much as 40%. Despite their diminished magnitudes, the temperature and ion concentration dependencies of the reduced single channel conductances of these variants were not different from those of wildtype CFTR. Therefore, the channel pore or rate-limiting step in the permeation pathway was not altered by these substitutions. Consistent with this conclusion, preliminary calculations of pore diameter in structural models of the wild-type and mutant CFTRs revealed that the size of the pore did not significantly differ between the wild type and variant structures. However, although the static structure was unaffected, protein dynamics may vary in the mutants as compared to the wild type, which could significantly change channel behavior. Thus, we postulate two possible mechanisms of the strong impact of TME changes on channel conductance: either that the residues changed may normally contribute to a cytoplasmic vestibule where ions are concentrated proximal to the pore or, alternatively, that they may be dynamically coupled to residues within the pore. To distinguish between these possibilities, we are performing further single channel and biochemical measurements, as well as Molecular Dynamics simulations to detect structural fluctuations and dynamic coupling between distant regions of the channel.

The choice of detergents for the initial solubilization and subsequent purification is critical to the success of this goal. The main focus of the published research efforts have been on the interactions between detergents and the transmembrane domains. However, in order to achieve functional purification of integral membrane proteins, maintaining the stability and function of the extramembranous domains is as important as the transmembrane domains. We therefore studied the interactions between detergents and the first nucleotide-binding domain of human CFTR (hNBD1), an extramembranous domain. We selected members from the three different classes of detergents, non-ionic, zwitterionic and anionic, that were commonly used in membrane protein purification. For example, lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) and perfluorooctanoate (PFO) were anionic detergents that were widely used in CFTR extraction and purification. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) were used to study the effects of the detergents on the thermal stability and secondary structures of isolated hNBD1. The results show that all detergents destabilized hNBD1, causing decreases in both unfolding temperature and enthalpy, albeit to different degrees. Anionic detergents were the stronger denaturants, causing complete denaturation of hNBD1 at modest concentrations; while non-ionic detergents only destabilized it to some extent, without drastic effects on its secondary or tertiary structures. Zwitterionic detergents were harsher than non-ionic detergents, but complete denaturation only occurred at very high concentrations. These effects were similar to the effects of detergents on egg white lysozyme, a well characterized soluble protein. The reversibility of the denaturing effects and the feasibility of using mixed micelle systems will be discussed. In summary, the studies reported here represent the first systematic studies of interactions between detergents and the extramembranous domain of an integral membrane protein. Similar studies can be carried out on other membrane proteins to assist the detergent optimization. The results suggested that the usage of anionic detergents in membrane protein purification is limited due to their denaturing effects on the soluble domains.",

            "text": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation are important regulators of CFTR trafficking and channel gating. Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for identifying the precise locations of such PTMs; however, difficulties purifying large quantities of CFTR have limited previous studies of this type. We are pursuing recombinant technologies and purification methods that recover amounts of CFTR suitable for 1) proteolytic digestion and global analysis of CFTR by MS/MS and 2) monitoring specific locations of predicted PTMs by MRM-MS. An initial approach using a qqQTrap mass spectrometer led to confirmation of seven previously described sites of CFTR phosphorylation and four novel positions for this PTM. We have also shown that several CFTR residues are methylated, provided the first description of CFTR palmitoylation, and identified a single (putative) site of ubiquitination. Recent improvements in CFTR purification have increased yields more than 10fold, and together with a new high resolution, high mass accuracy qqTOF mass spectrometer, we have been able to further refine the analysis. One striking result has been identification of over twenty sites of CFTR ubiquitination (a modification known to govern CFTR degradation from both the ER and plasma membrane compartments). Precise locations of this PTM have been established by MS/MS. In addition, the improved methods allow investigation of PTMs specific to immature (band B) versus mature (band C) CFTR glycoforms as well as wild-type versus F508del CFTR. Our findings also suggest the possibility of previously unappreciated molecular \"switches\" in which two PTMs in close proximity may regulate CFTR gating. For example, four well characterized phosphorylation sites (S686, S700, S712, and S795) are each separated from positions of ubiquitination by a single amino acid, a finding that may help explain the well described refractoriness of F508del CFTR (which is heavily ubiquitinated) to kinase-dependent activation. In other membrane proteins, switch mechanisms such as these control aspects of ion channel function, protein biogenesis, exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, and insertion in the plasma membrane. Further studies regarding interplay of PTMs are therefore expected to provide valuable information regarding wild-type and F508del CFTR biogenesis and gating.",

            "text": "S-Palmitoylation is a critical regulator of membrane protein localization, maturational processing and function of ion channels and ABC transporters. The post-translational modification (PTM) is characterized by attachment of a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid to cysteine sulfhydryl groups. We used both multiple reaction ion monitoring (MRM) and tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry to establish that full-length CFTR is palmitoylated in human cells and confirmed this observation by metabolic labeling with 3 H-palmitic acid. We also established that pharmacologic inhibition of palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP): 1) results in decreased steady state levels of both mature and immature CFTR, 2) abrogates maturation of CFTR band B \u00c7 C (pulse-chase analysis), and 3) decreases CFTR activity in the plasma membrane. The F508del CFTR mutant is also covalently labeled by 3 H-palmitic acid. Although 2-BP causes no obvious effect on F508del CFTR steady state expression or activity at 37\u00b0C, it significantly decreases low temperature correction of the mutant protein. MS/MS and MRM-MS have so far localized palmitoylation to CFTR residues 524 and 1395. Alanine replacement of the cysteine at position 1395 has no effect on wild-type CFTR steady state expression, maturational efficiency, or cell surface activity. In contrast, C524A (within NBD1) led to diminished expression of fully glycosylated band C, blocked maturation of band B \u00c7 C, and reduced CFTR function in living cells. Detailed studies of other cysteine residues (with predicted palmitoylation consensus motifs and at positions in proximity to plasma membrane) are currently in progress. In addition, palmitoyl acyl transferases (PATs) comprise a family of 24 gene products that contain a DHHC motif and mediate palmitoylation of diverse cellular proteins. Recombinant expression of PATs in epithelial cells led to robust effects on CFTR expression and palmitoylation as judged by Western blot and metabolic labeling. Co-immunoprecipitation established a direct interaction between several PATs and either wild-type or F508del CFTR. Together, these findings indicate that palmitoylation plays an important role during trafficking of CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Continued studies of this pathway may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming the processing defect attributable to F508del CFTR.",

Rescued (r)\u2206F508CFTR is conformationally and metabolically unstable and subject to ubiquitination, rapid endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. To test the role of scaffold interactions in r\u2206F508CFTR stability, quantum-dot single particle tracking was used to probe cell surface CFTR interactions in live cells. In several transfected cell types, immediately after low-temperature rescue, the diffusion of r\u2206F508CFTR was identical to that of wild type (wt) CFTR. However, thermal destabilization of r\u2206F508CFTR by incubation at 37 \u00b0C, which causes ubiquitination and enhanced endocytosis, increased r\u2206F508CFTR diffusion. Similar increases in \u2206F508CFTR diffusion compared to wtCFTR were found when \u2206F508CFTR biosynthetic processing was corrected by small molecules (VX-809, CoPo-22), activation of alternative trafficking pathways (GRASP overexpression) or thapsigargin treatment. Perturbation of PDZ domain-interactions that tether CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton by overexpression of the CFTR carboxy-terminus (fused to mCherry) resulted in comparable increased diffusion of wild type and r\u2206F508CFTR. These results suggest that PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins interact with r\u2206F508CFTR at the cell surface, and contribute to channel confinement, albeit to a lesser degree than for the wtCFTR. Modulation of the expression or function of CHIP, a peripheral protein quality control protein, by siRNA knockdown or overexpression of a dominant negative CHIP mutant, reduced r\u2206F508CFTR diffusion, implicating the involvement of CHIP in modulating r\u2206F508CFTR-scaffold interactions. To quantitatively relate r\u2206F508CFTR mobility to endocytosis, a cell line overexpressing the CFTR carboxyl terminus (fused to mCherry) was generated in which wtCFTR mobility was increased to that of r\u2206F508CFTR levels. In this cell type, CFTR endocytosis was increased by ~50%. Our data indicate that: (i) wtCFTR and r\u2206F508CFTR have different cell surface mobility, which is related to r\u2206F508CFTR-PDZ scaffold interactions, (ii) the peripheral quality control protein CHIP is responsible for altered mutant channel mobility, and (iii) at least two distinct mechanisms contribute to enhanced endocytosis of r\u2206F508CFTR compared to wtCFTR.",

            "text": "Supported by NIH and CFF. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) is an ion channel, which is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. CFTR is distinguished from all other related ABC transporters by the presence of an unstructured domain in the middle of the protein's primary sequence known as the regulatory or R-domain. The origin of the CFTR Rdomain has been a mystery until this time; it does not encode any known structural elements or folds and does not contain sequence similarity to any known domain. Comparison of the gene sequence of CFTR to its most closely related ABC transporter, ABCC4, reveals a highly conserved exonintron structure and shows that the R-domain is encoded by an extension of exon 14 in CFTR. The origin of the R-domain can be attributed to the loss of a splice donor site in the CFTR evolutionary lineage after its divergence from ABCC4 via an insertion/deletion event and the subsequent capture of previously intronic sequence as protein coding sequence in CFTR. Evaluation of the phyletic distribution of the R-domain shows that this event occurred near the base of the vertebrate lineage approximately 550-600 million years ago. The R-domain has evolved under purifying selection since that time, consistent with its functional relevance to the CFTR protein, albeit at lower levels of constraint than the other CFTR domains. The site-specific pattern of the R-domain is also distinct from the patterns seen for the other CFTR domains; there are a few highly conserved sites, primarily serine residues that form consensus sequences for PKA-or PKC-dependent phosphorylation, whereas the remaining sites have evolved under weak selective constraint. Thus, the consensus phosphorylation positions in the R-domain appear to have emerged very early in its evolution and have remained unchanged since that time. Origination of protein coding sequence from non-coding (intronic) sequence is thought to be a rare event in evolution, partly due to the low likelihood of non-coding sequence encoding structural motifs or folds. The R-domain remains unstructured, consistent with its origin from non-coding sequence, but seems to have been able to emerge and remain as protein coding sequence via the contribution of substrates for phosphorylation, which in turn may have played an important role in the emergence of the ion channel function of the protein by facilitating a A balance between alveolar liquid absorption and secretion is critical for maintaining optimal alveolar subphase liquid height and facilitating gas exchange in the alveolar space. However, the role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) in this homeostatic process has remained elusive. Using a newly developed porcine model of cystic fibrosis, in which CFTR is absent, we investigated ion transport properties and alveolar liquid transport in isolated type II alveolar epithelial cells (T2AECs) cultured at the air-liquid interface. CFTR was distributed exclusively to the apical surface of cultured T2AECs. Alveolar epithelia from CFTR-/-pigs failed to increase liquid absorption in response to agents that increase cAMP, whereas cAMP-stimulated liquid absorption in CFTR+/epithelia was similar to that in CFTR+/+ epithelia. Expression of recombinant CFTR restored stimulated liquid absorption in CFTR-/-T2AECs but had no effect on CFTR+/+ epithelia. In ex vivo studies of non-perfused lungs, stimulated liquid absorption was defective in CFTR-/-alveolar epithelia but similar between CFTR+/+ and CFTR+/-epithelia. When epithelia were studied at the air-liquid interface, elevating cAMP levels increased subphase liquid height in CFTR+/+ but not in CFTR-/-T2AECs. Our findings demonstrate that CFTR is required for maximal liquid absorption under cAMP stimulation, but it is not the rate-limiting factor. Furthermore, our data define a role for CFTR in liquid secretion by T2AECs. These insights may help to develop new treatment strategies for pulmonary edema and respiratory distress syndrome, diseases in which lung liquid transport is disrupted. CFTR activating molecules identified by high throughput drug screening may exhibit limited solubility in water and are therefore dissolved in solvents such as DMSO or ethanol for experimental testing. During evaluation of novel compounds obtained in this fashion, we serendipitously discovered that agents solubilized in low concentrations of ethanol produce strong activation of wild type CFTR-mediated Cltransport in well characterized primary cell culture models of murine nasal septal (MNSE) and human sinonasal respiratory epithelium (HSNE). Dysfunctional mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a hallmark of many airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). An approach to enhance transepithelial Clsecretion with low concentrations of ethanol, a solvent already present in numerous aerosolized pharmaceuticals, is being pursued by our laboratory. The objectives of the current study were to investigate ethanol for effects on transepithelial Clsecretion and characterize the mechanism that underlies this form of CFTR modulation. Primary MNSE [wild type (wt) and transgenic CFTR-/-] and HSNE cultures were subjected to transepithelial ion transport measurements using pharmacologic manipulation in Ussing chambers. CFTR R-domain phosphorylation and cAMP levels were examined as a test of PKA-dependent activity. Time-dependent and dose-dependent toxicity were also measured using LDH based protocols. A strong increase in CFTR-mediated Cltransport (change in short-circuit current, \u2206ISC) was demonstrated with activation stable at 0.5% ethanol [MNSE; 18.2 +/-2.5 vs. 0.0 (control); p<0.001 and HSNE; 4.6 +/-0.4 vs. 0.0 (control); p<0.001]. Total stimulation (ethanol+forskolin 100nM) was elevated in MNSE [32.7 +/-2.2 vs. 26.6 +/-3.8 (control); p=0.12] but significantly additive to forskolin in HSNE [20.7 +/-1.2 vs. 13.0 +/-0.5 (control); p<0.01]. Effects of ethanol were completely abrogated by INH-172 and CFTR dependence confirmed by lack of stimulation in transgenic CFTR-/-MNSE. There was no increase in cellular cAMP attributable to ethanol at the concentrations studied. R-domain phosphorylation, as judged by a biochemical gel shift assay of recombinant Rdomain, was also unchanged. Incubations up to 24 hours were performed using all concentrations tested and no cellular toxicity noted. The observation that ethanol stimulates transepithelial Clsecretion via CFTR indicates possible use as a topical aerosol delivered alone or in combination with other CFTR activators for treatment of dysfunctional MCC. The same intervention might be used to activate residual CFTR activity (e.g. in the setting of F508del-CFTR pharmacologic correction) and ameliorate underlying mucus obstruction in CF-associated sinusitis. Finally, it should be noted that CFTR activation by potentiators dissolved in ethanol may overestimate potency, and our results emphasize the need for stringent vehicle controls during experimental testing of CFTR modulators in vitro and in vivo. Mutation affects chloride secretion of the epithelial cell lining of the lungs, pancreas and sweat glands. Still little is known about how mutations affect folding and function at the protein level. We have expressed CFTR in the yeast Pichia pastoris for large scale production of wild-type and mutant proteins. To assess their function we have explored the use of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as a molecular probe for chloride channel activity. Halide binding to chloride sensitive YFP mutant H148Q/I153L causes protonation of the chromophore and thus quenching of the YFP fluorescence, which may serve to monitor CFTR's channel activity.",

For this vesicles expressing wild-type human CFTR a codon-optimized CFTR* variant are loaded with YFP protein and fluorescence changes monitored after exchange into iodide containing buffers. Quench occurs due to CFTR channel opening causing an influx of iodide that leads to quenching of the YFP fluorescence. Control experiments using an ATP hydrolysis deficient CFTR* mutant or a channel gating mutant confirmed the fluorescence quench is due to CFTR specific activity. This assay is invaluable for assessing purified CFTR proteins and may be developed into a high throughput screening tool for drugs that correct cystic fibrosis. The regulated trafficking of membrane proteins to and from the cell surface allows cells to rapidly respond to physiological stimuli. Activation of CFTR by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation increases its open probability and facilitates ion transport. Our aim was to investigate whether elevated PKA activity not only increased CFTR gating but also promoted trafficking from an intracellular pool to the cell surface in order to augment cellular conductance. In order to monitor the dynamic and rapid movements of CFTR, we used a fluorogen activating protein fused to the N-terminus via an extra transmembrane linker to selectively label CFTR at the plasma membrane (PM). In a prior study we used this approach to quantify the actions of known F508del CFTR correctors both alone and in combination to detect additivity and synergy. Here, we tracked the movement of CFTR from the cell surface to intracellular compartments and recycling back to the cell surface with live cell fluorescence microscopy. We observed internalization and accumulation from the PM into a coalesced perinuclear compartment at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) which we confirmed by tubulin staining. This intracellular CFTR compartment colocalized closely with the endosomal recycling complex markers, Rab11 and EHD-1 and reached steady-state distribution around 25 minutes. F508del-CFTR which was rescued either by corrector treatment or low temperature incubation also internalized from the PM to a Rab11/EHD1 positive compartment. Little or no colocalization was observed for CFTR WT and the lysosomal marker, Lamp1, consistent with efficient recycling and slow turnover. Alternatively, thermal destabilization of temperature rescued F508del-CFTR resulted in increased targeting to lysosomes. Acute increases in PKA activity by forskolin stimulation depleted this intracellular pool of CFTR by 55%. Stimulation with forskolin was found to inhibit CFTR endocytosis and dramatically reduce intracellular accumulation. Furthermore, PKA activation induced the translocation of CFTR from an intracellular recycling compartment and promoted insertion into the plasma membrane which we observed using TIRF microscopy. These findings indicate that the itinerary of internalized surface CFTR leads into a regulated recycling pathway that contributes to augmented PM channel density in response to secretory stimuli.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the counter regulatory HO-1/CO pathway, which is critical in balancing and limiting the inflammatory response, is defective in CF M\u03a6s through a Cav-1-dependent mechanism, exacerbating the CF M\u03a6's response to LPS. This pathway could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for CF lung disease. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is expressed in airway epithelial cells, and its expression induced in pulmonary diseases characterized by oxidant stress, including CF. HO-1 over-expression protects against P. aeruginosa infection, suggesting induction of HO-1 in CF is cytoprotective in nature and that increasing its expression could potentially be therapeutic against bacterial infection and inflammation. Our laboratory is interested in the role of prostanoid receptors in mediating oxidant stress in airway epithelia. Recently, it was reported that PGE2 can protect against oxidant-induced apoptosis via upregulation of HO-1 mediated by the EP2 receptor. Therefore, using model human airway epithelial cells we have investigated whether activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors induce HO-1 expression and, if so, can this protect the cells against oxidant-induced damage. 16HBEo-cells were treated with 400 \u00b5M H 2 O 2 for 6 hours, a protocol we initially determined induces apoptosis, but not significant levels of death by necrosis (as determined by lactate dehydrogenase assay). Apoptosis was measured via a caspase-3 colorimetric assay. As a positive control, we initially induced HO-1 using the known inducer cobalt protoporphyrin IX (10 \u00b5M), which protected against H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis, and increased HO-1 expression as determined via quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Pharmacological activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors using butaprost and PGE1-OH (both at 10\u00b5M) respectively revealed that EP4 receptor activation protected against H 2 O 2induced apoptosis, while EP2 receptor activation had no effect. PGE2 similarly protected against apoptosis. Interestingly however, whilst protecting against apoptosis, EP2 and EP4 receptor activation had no significant effect on HO-1 expression, either at the gene or protein level. Finally, we investigated whether HO-1 induction or prostanoid receptor activation were protective against H 2 O 2 -induced lipid peroxidation. Treatment with cobalt protoporphyrin IX, butaprost, PGE1-OH or PGE2 were not effective at reducing H 2 O 2 -induced lipid peroxidation. We conclude that whilst EP4 receptor activation is protective against oxidant-stress induced apoptosis in human airway epithelial cells, this mechanism is independent of HO-1 induction, and likely reflects stimulation of PGE2 production. This suggests the EP4 receptor can be protective against oxidative-induced cell death and may represent a novel target for airway diseases characterized by oxidative stress, such as CF.",

Our latest studies analyze CFTR function remote from the respiratory system and demonstrate elevated sweat chloride in healthy smokers (-30.8 mEq, P\u22640.01) and COPD smokers (-30.7 mEq, P<0.05) compared to controls (-17.5 mEq, n>20/group). This is indicative of ~40% reduction in CFTR activity, a value similar to that observed in CFTR related disorders and the first report of acquired CFTR dysfunction at a site not directly exposed to cigarette smoke. Similarly, compared to non-smokers, CFTR-dependent intestinal currents were also reduced in smokers (45% of controls, P<0.05, n=15,6). The systemic nature of the CFTR decrement was further supported by reduced CFTR activity (68%, P<0.01, n=14) in non-CF HBEs exposed to plasma from smokers for 24 hrs compared to plasma from normal controls, suggesting a circulating factor could confer CFTR dysfunction. To confirm these findings in vivo, non-CF mice were exposed twice daily to WCS for 5 and 17 weeks. WCSexposed mice had decreased CFTR activity by NPD (28.9% of controls, P<0.005, n=10), trachea Isc (53%, P<0.05, n=9) and Isc of the distal ileum (84.3%, P<0.05, n=10; and 45%, P<0.001, n=8, after 5 and 17 weeks, respectively).

Nrf2-regulated antioxidant proteins are decreased in CF. We sought to determine whether activation of Nrf2 by consumption of sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts would activate Nrf2 in monocytes and nasal epithelial cells, reduce oxidative metabolites, and reduce PMNs in healthy volunteers (HVs) and subjects with CF. Ten HVs and 5 CF subjects ate 100 gms of broccoli sprouts daily for 5 days. Outcomes included Nrf2 in nasal cells, plasma glutathione (GSH), intracellular GSH and Nrf2 activation in monocytes, urine bromotyrosine, and oral PMNs. Nrf2 was isolated in the cytoplasm of all lymphocytes but in the nucleus from lymphocytes from 1 CF and 7 HVs. HVs had more Nrf2 in lymphocyte cytoplasm than did CF (median pre-treatment values in CF vs. HV: 121,460 vs. 516,095 OD x mm3, p=0.22). Nrf2 was increased post treatment in lymphocyte cytoplasm in 4/5 CF subjects (pre-vs. post-treatment: 121,460 pretreatment vs. 402,261 OD x mm3) compared to HVs (pre-vs. post-treatment: 516,095 vs. 640,867 OD x mm3). The change in Nrf2 did not differ between CF and HV (p=0.86). Nrf2 decreased in the nucleus of lymphocytes from HV (median values pre-vs. post-treatment: 178,961 vs. 9,559 OD x mm3, p=0.08). Nrf2 was detected in epithelial cell cytoplasm of 4/5 CF but only 4/10 HVs. Mean changes in lymphocyte GSH did not differ between the two groups. There was a trend towards increased lymphocyte GSH in HV (p = 0.14). In CF, there was a trend towards decreased plasma GSH (p = 0.07). Four of five CF subjects showed declines in plasma GSH. The mean change in plasma GSH was more negative in CF than in HVs (p=0.023). Post-treatment lymphocyte GSH tended to increase, and plasma GSH was unchanged in HVs. The lack of Nrf2 activation would suggest that less GSH is made in CF cells, thus reducing redox protection. Nine of ten HVs had decreases in mouthwash PMN pre-to post-treatment (p=0.022). Four of five CF subjects demonstrated decreases in mouthwash PMN. Mean change in log 10 (PMN) did not differ between the two groups (p=0.48). The mean change in log 10 (urine bromotyrosine) did not differ significantly from zero in either CF or HVs, and the mean change over time did not differ between the two groups. CF subjects had a higher baseline urine bromotyrosine than did HVs, thus suggesting a high baseline oxidative state (p=0.0013). There were no SAEs during this study. Results suggest that subjects with CF have a high baseline oxidative state and that there is an abnormality in Nrf2 activation. Results also suggest that sulforaphane may attenuate inflammation in CF, possibly through the activation of Nrf2. Supported by the CF Foundation. involvement in lung diseases, the miniscule size of native peripheral airways has limited studies of fluid and electrolyte movements in these structures. For this, we assembled a novel capillary-Ussing chamber (area\u2329 1 mm 2 ) to measure electrolyte transport in small airways (\u22481 mm \u03a6) from pig lung. Transepithelial potentials (V t ) were recorded in open circuit conditions and during brief constant current pulses across the epithelial surface of dissected airways to determine transepithelial conductance (G t ) and equivalent short circuit current (I sc eq ) in the presence and absence of selected inhibitors and agonists. In bilateral Ringer's solution, spontaneous V t , G t and I sc eq were: \u22122.1 \u00b1 0.2 mV, 21.2 \u00b1 0.9 mS/cm 2 , and 44.4 \u00b1 3.9 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n= 37; mean \u00b1 SEM), respectively. Both the Na + conductance inhibitor amiloride and the Cl \u2212 conductance inhibitor niflumic acid depolarized V t , decreased G t , and I sc eq , but unexpectedly, CFTR Cl \u2212 conductance inhibitor GlyH-101 hyperpolarized V t , and decreased G t while slightly increasing I sc eq . Activating CFTR with cAMP agonists significantly depolarized V t and increased G t , without a significant effect on I sc eq . On the other hand, putatively activating Ca ++ activated Cl \u2212 channels (CaCC) with the purinergic agonist UTP, acutely hyperpolarized V t and increased G t and I sc eq significantly above spontaneous levels. When the impermeant anion gluconate completely replaced luminal Cl \u2212 , V t hyperpolarized markedly by nearly \u221240 mV. A luminally directed 2:1 NaCl gradient, hyperpolarized V t indicating that transepithelial Cl \u2212 : Na + selectivity is at least 3:1. These data are consistent with a native airway epithelium that is highly anion-selective and is composed of separate, constitutively and concurrently, active electrolyte secreting and absorbing epithelia. Since small airways are formed of long longitudinal, accordion-like rows of pleats and folds, we propose that the pleats may consist mainly of dedicated secretory cells while the folds consist of absorptive cells.",

            "text": "Supported by the Nancy Olmsted Trust, NIH (RO1-HL084042), and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) is a key regulator of airway surface liquid volume. In the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, relative hyperactivity of ENaC is hypothesized to cause depletion of the periciliary liquid, which impairs mucociliary clearance and portends bacterial colonization of the airway. In our group's studies of the correction of \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking by 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), we demonstrated that ERp29, a novel 29 kDa molecular chaperone of the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), had increased abundance in CF epithelial cells after treatment with 4PBA, and that ERp29 promoted trafficking of both WT and \u2206F508 CFTR (Suaud, et al, JBC, 2011). ERp29 is homologous to the thioredoxins, which are enzymes that catalyze the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bridges. However, ERp29 has only a single cysteine residue (C157) and lacks the C-X-X-C motif that is characteristic of the thioredoxins. We tested the hypotheses that ERp29 would regulate ENaC trafficking and functional expression, and that its single cysteine, C157, would have a critical role in ERp29's regulation of ENaC. To test this hypothesis in epithelial cells, we selected ENaC-overexpressing MDCK cell lines with doxycycline (dox)inducible expression of either WT ERp29 or a mutant ERp29 where C157 was changed to serine (C157S ERp29). In Ussing chambers, dox-induced overexpression of WT ERp29 caused an increase in amiloride-sensitive Isc, or ENaC functional expression. In contrast, overexpression of C157S ERp29 caused a decrease in amiloride-sensitive Isc. These opposite effects correlated with the influence of WT or C157S ERp29 on the whole cell expression of the cleaved form of ENaC's \u03b3-subunit. Overexpression of WT ERp29 increased its whole cell expression, while overexpression of C157S ERp29 decreased it. We also tested the influence of C157S ERp29 on the fraction of cleaved, higher Po versus uncleaved, lower Po ENaC at the apical surface by examining the influence of trypsin on amiloride-sensitive Isc in Ussing chambers. Application of 10 \u00b5g/mL trypsin to the apical surface of MDCK cells overexpressing C157S ERp29 caused a significantly greater fractional increase of amiloride-sensitive Isc compared to the control cells, suggesting that C157S ERp29 inhibited ENaC cleavage. Interestingly, the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of ERp29 expression on amiloride-sensitive Isc was similar to that of C157S ERp29. When MDCK cells were treated with ERp29 siRNA, the fraction of total amiloride-sensitive Isc that was induced by trypsin was significantly greater than control cells treated with non-targeting siRNA. In contrast, overexpression of WT ERp29 decreased the fraction of total amiloride-sensitive Isc induced by trypsin. Finally, overexpression of either WT or C157S ERp29 increased the recovery of \u03b2-ENaC after immunoprecipitation of ERp29. These data support the hypothesis that ERp29 interacts with ENaC and can regulate its functional expression by regulating ENaC subunit cleavage. These data also suggest that C157 is critical for ERp29's regulation of ENaC, but is not a determinant of ERp29's interaction with ENaC. Increased TGF-\u03b21 levels have been found in inflammatory diseases and in CF. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of TGF-\u03b21 are elevated in cystic fibrosis in comparison to non-CF controls, and are associated with neutrophilic inflammation, diminished lung function and increased rates of hospitalization.

            "text": "The clearance of airway mucus represents a primary innate defense mechanism that protects the airways from infectious and toxic agents inhaled during normal breathing. The airway surface layer (ASL) is a critical component of the mucus clearance system and consists of two principal components: 1) the motile mucus layer that traps inhaled particles and 2) the periciliary layer (PCL) which provides a favorable environment for ciliary beating and cell surface lubrication. This system has been traditionally viewed as \"gel-like\" mucus layer propelled by cilia beating in a low viscosity \"watery\" periciliary (or sol) layer. However, this view of the PCL does not adequately explain why mucus does not freely penetrate into the ~200 nm space between cilia. In fact, using a two-dye labeling technique to quantify the permeability of the PCL (i.e. mesh size), we found that polymer molecules and beads with molecular sizes as small as 40 nm in diameter were completely excluded from the PCL of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell cultures, whereas only molecules < 5 nm diameter could gain access to the cell surface. Coupled with data from electron microscopy studies which reveal an electron-dense meshwork surrounding the cilia, we hypothesized that cell surface-tethered glycoproteins form an extracellular brush with a sufficiently high concentration to establish a mesh that prevents both mucus and inhaled particles from penetrating the PCL and reaching the cell surface. In an effort to identify the molecules responsible for the PCL mesh, immunohistochemistry studies revealed the presence of very large membrane-spanning mucins (MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16) attached to cilia, microvilli, and the cell surface of HBE cultures. To understand whether these mucins are involved in establishing the PCL brush, we generated a transgenic mouse lacking Muc1, Muc4, and Muc16. Using excised tissue and cultured cells from wild-type mouse airways, we observed that, like the human airways, molecules of 40 nm diameter were completely excluded from the mouse PCL. In contrast, we found that the PCL mesh permeability was significantly altered in airways derived from the triple MUC knockout mouse. Here, molecules of 40 nm diameter were capable of penetrating the PCL down to a depth of 2.3 \u00b5m from the cell surface, compared to 4.1 \u00b5m in tissues from wild-type animals (i.e. complete exclusion). (Note, the cilia of the mouse respiratory tract are ~4 \u00b5m in length, compared to ~7 \u00b5m in human). Taken together, our results suggest that tethered mucins play a vital role in protecting the airways by establishing a permeability barrier to prevent small infectious agents (e.g. Influenza A, ~100 nm, and RSV, ~120 nm) from gaining access to the cell surface. This work was supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The importance of regulating the hydration of the airway surface layer (ASL) is readily apparent in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), where dysregulation of ion transport leads to unregulated fluid absorptions, mucus plugging, failure of mucociliary clearance (MCC), and eventually, chronic lung disease. Hyperosmotic solutions, such as hypertonic saline (HS), have been used clinically to treat patients with CF, by acting osmotically to draw water out of cells and rehydrate the thick, sticky, mucus. We have previously shown that aerosolized HS applied to cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures, produces only a transient increase in the ASL height (an index of airway hydration), as a result of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)mediated fluid reabsorption. Furthermore, we have previously shown that HS produces a transient, but significant, slowing of cilia beating frequency (CBF), and thus MCC, when delivered as an aerosol to the airway surface. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of both liquid and dry powder formulations of HS (NaCl) to a novel hyperosmotic calcium-based formulation (iCALM) on ASL hydration and CBF. In these studies, we utilized novel nebulization and dry powder delivery systems, capable of mimicking the in vivo delivery rates of hyperosmotic solutions and powders to the lower airways. Consistent with the application of an osmotic agent to the luminal surface of the airways, we found that liquid and powder NaCl and iCALM formulations produced a robust increase in the total ASL height. However, the rates of fluid reabsorption following treatment with the powder reagents (both NaCl and iCALM) were significantly slower than the liquid formulations. As a result, the total hydration power, an integrated measure of change in ASL height overtime, was significantly higher in the powder treated conditions. Second, we found that powder formulations of NaCl and iCALM had a significantly milder affect on CBF, as compared to the liquid formulations. Interestingly, iCALM (both liquid and powder) had a significantly faster recover of CBF following delivery, compared to NaCl. While the mechanism for the hyperosmotic-mediated slowing of CBF is unknown, it is hypothesized to involve cell shrinkage during exposure to hyperosmolar agents. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that iCALM (liquid and powder) and NaCl (powder) produced significantly less cell shrinkage, compared to the traditional liquid NaCl (HS) formulation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that dry powder iCALM, and to a lesser effect NaCl, have superior effects in maintaining airway hydration while minimizing the effect on cilia beating. The net effect of both is a prolonged facilitation of MCC rates. This material is based upon work supported by, or in part by, the US Army Research Laboratory and the US Army Research Office under grant number W911NF-10-1-0382. The role of airway mucus in lung defense is often associated with trapping of particles and pathogens, which are cleared by mucociliary clearance. Recent studies on human purified gel-forming mucins, i.e., MUC5AC and MUC5B, revealed the existence of macromolecular complexes, called mucin interactome, which involve immune/regulatory proteins and might contribute to maintaining lung immune homeostasis. Defective mucus clearance contributes to the pathology of diverse muco-obstructive lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), but the impact of airway mucus obstruction on the mucin interactome is currently unknown. Experimentally, defective mucus clearance has been generated by airway-targeted overexpression of the epithelial Na + channel \u03b2 subunit (encoded by the Scnn1b gene) in murine lungs. Scnn1b-transgenic (Scnn1b-Tg) mice exhibit CF-like lung pathology including airway mucus obstruction, inflammation, and susceptibility to spontaneous bacterial infections. We began to characterize the mucin interactome in Scnn1b-Tg mice and WT littermates using bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL). Pellet and supernatant fractions were obtained by low speed centrifugation, and the pellet was washed with PBS to remove loosely associated components. Guanidine hydrochloride (6M) was added to break noncovalent interactions and disperse the mucus. Refractive index measurement combined with gel filtration was used to determine the mass of total biomolecules (G25 Sephadex) and large complexes (CL2B column, V o volume). As expected, the total biomass was higher in Scnn1b-Tg BAL than in WT. Most of the biomass recovered from Scnn1b-Tg BAL was in the pellet fraction and consisted primarily of large aggregates. The ratio of large aggregates (CL2B) to total biomolecules (G25) was not different between WT and Scnn1b-Tg pellets, indicating coordinate regulation of all mucus components. The CL2B V o fraction was digested with trypsin and subjected to LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, a series of low Mr proteins, such as chitinases, Lplunc1, histones, SP-A, SP-B, SP-D, were detected in the high Mr complexes in addition to Muc5b, indicating interaction of these proteins with mucins. Unfractionated BALs in 6M urea were also subjected to CL2B gel filtration and mass spectrometry. Using a novel label free quantitation technique, ~50 proteins were detectable only in Scnn1b-Tg samples (vomeromodulin, calgranulins, peroxiredoxin, cathelicidin, thioredoxin, CD177, lactoferrin, FIZZ, HMGB1, myeloperoxidase), ~15 proteins increased 2-19 fold (Lplunc1, superoxide dismutase, histones, glutathione S-transferase, YM1, SP-D), and ~10 proteins decreased 4-60 fold (\u03b11-antitrypsin, SP-B, surfactant convertase, contrapsin, CC10, WAP, SP-A) as compared to WT. The effect of selective removal of either gel-forming mucin, i.e., Muc5ac or Muc5b, on the mucin interactome composition is currently being investigated using BALs from mucin-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice and WT littermates. Besides providing insights about the specific function of Muc5ac and Muc5b in airway mucus, this analysis will suggest safety thresholds for therapeutic strategies focused on reducing mucin secretion as a tool to alleviate mucus obstruction. Effective airway gene transfer that could functionally correct the CFTR gene defect in CF airways has been the primary goal of gene therapy development in the CF mouse animal model. We have reported long term (> 12 month) partial CFTR correction in timed-group CF mouse studies 1 .

It has been shown previously that increased mucin concentration (2.5% to 8% solids) and large amounts of extracellular DNA alter the viscoelastic properties of CF mucus and compromise its transport. To reduce the viscosity of CF secretions, a recombinant human DNase (dornase alpha) was developed and is widely used to improve mucus clearance. Extracellular DNA was thought to result from degenerating neutrophils in response to chronic infection, but recently a new function of neu-trophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been discovered whereby neutrophils expulse their nuclear content, forming complex scaffolding of DNA, histones and granular proteins, resembling a spider web, designed to trap pathogens.",

            "text": "We have recently collected pediatric CF bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from exacerbating and non-exacerbating patients and analyzed them using confocal microscopy, refractometry and rheological techniques. From our direct observation of cytocentrifuge preparations, we have detected increased numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in exacerbating patients, and this correlates with changes in rheology and increased mucin concentrations. NETs were tightly interwoven with mucins and the structure of these large polymers (e.g. mucin-DNA networks) varied considerably from patient to patient. In some cases, these networks presented complex levels of scaffolding and showed colossal molecular weights (~2,000 MDa) and substantial sizes (radius of gyratio\u00f1 400nm). In non-exacerbating patients who underwent CT scanning as part of their usual care, increased pellet mass, mucin and extracellular DNA concentrations closely correlated with CT scoring for bronchial wall thickening (BWT), likely an important finding that precedes the onset of bronchiectasis. Unlike exacerbating patients, the majority of cells in these samples were macrophages with fewer neutrophils (mean = 16% as compared to 61% with exacerbation); however, substantial amounts of extracellular DNA that co-localized with citrullinated histones was detected, suggesting that macrophages could also play a role in mucus thickening in CF. Finally, despite the use of rhDNase in many of these patients, our BALF analyses continued to show the persistence of mucin-DNA macrocomplexes, which suggests that rhDNase had incomplete effects on NETs, either because of lack of efficiency or inadequate penetration into the thick mucus.",

            "text": "These data suggest that NET formation may increase during periods of pulmonary exacerbation, and this in turn could contribute to the pathogenesis of CF. Further, it is possible that non-neutrophil cell types (i.e. macrophages) may also contribute to the accumulation of extracellular DNA, perhaps being most important in airways with lesser degrees of chronic inflammation. A better understanding of the role that NETs play in the pathophysiology of CF, and the identification of strategies that better address the problem of mucus-DNA complexes and defective mucus clearance may provide new insights into the treatment of CF. The epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) is responsible for Na + absorption in the kidney, colon and lung. ENaC is made up of three subunits, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Previous studies have shown that ENaC is hyperactive in CF airways, due to a lack of negative regulation of ENaC by CFTR. This leads to a decrease in airway surface liquid (ASL) volume which slows or abolishes mucus transport. The activation of ENaC is dependent on its proteolytic cleavage by enzymes such as neutrophil elastase (NE). We have previously shown that the short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone (SPLUNC1) is a potent negative regulator of ENaC and ASL height. SPLUNC1 binds to and prevents the cleavage of ENaC. In this study we have identified the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 and characterized its interaction with ENaC. The region of SPLUNC1 responsible for ENaC inhibition was identified by measuring the amiloride sensitive ENaC current, I NA , in Xenopus oocytes co-injected with \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 ENaC in the presence of C-terminal SPLUNC1 truncants. Deletion of up to 85% of SPLUNC1 resulted in a similar inhibition of ENaC as seen with full-length SPLUNC1. This narrowed down the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 to residues 22-39. A peptide corresponding to this region, named G22-A39, was synthesized and 10 \u00b5M G22-A39 caused a ~2.5 fold decrease in I NA , indicating that we had identified the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1. SPLUNC1 has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with all three ENaC subunits, when they are expressed at the same time. Through a series of peptide pull-down assays we confirmed that G22-A39 was also able to interact in a similar fashion with all three subunits. However, when the subunits were individually expressed, G22-A39 specifically interacted with only the \u03b2-ENaC subunit in a glycosylation dependent fashion. To determine if G22-A39 was capable of inhibiting ASL hyperabsorption in CF human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs), the change in ASL height in CF HBECs was measured after treatment with G22-A39. Addition of G22-A39 to CF HBECs resulted in an increase in ASL height from 4.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5m to 7.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5m, comparable to normal HBECs. G22-A39 remained active in the presence of activated neutrophil supernatant (ANS), which is derived from human neutrophils and contains high NE and cathepsin activity, suggesting that G22-A39 may prevent ASL hyperabsorption under pathologically relevant conditions. By mass spectrometry, we observed that NE cleavage of purified SPLUNC1 resulted in peptides corresponding to the G22-A39 region. This indicates that the ENaC inhibitory domain is released from SPLUNC1 by neutrophil elastase. The ability of G22-A39 to function in a proteolytically active environment makes G22-A39 a strong therapeutic candidate for restoring ASL height and function in CF patients.

Importantly, RTD-1 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetics with a long terminal half-life in plasma and peak levels 30 times below the in-vitro defined TC 50 . are divided into 11 PDE families on the basis of their kinetic and pharmacologic properties. We have generated preliminary data that identify Type 4 PDEs (PDE4s) as the main regulators of the cAMP-dependent stimulation of CFTR in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs), a model highly relevant to human airway disease. PDE4 inhibition increases basal CFTRdependent short-circuit currents (ISC) to about 30% of the maximal levels induced by forskolin. Given that long-acting \u03b2-adrenergic (\u03b2-AR) agonists are widely used in COPD and CF therapy, we tested whether PDE4 inhibition modulates \u03b2-AR-dependent stimulation of CFTR. PDE4 inhibition potentiated isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated ISC and delayed the return of ISC to basal levels upon termination of \u03b2-AR signaling by treatment with the \u03b2-AR antagonist propranolol. PDE3 has been reported to regulate CFTR in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line T84. However, PDE3 inactivation has little effect on basal CFTR activity in HBEs and does not further stimulate ISC induced by PDE4 inhibition or \u03b2-AR stimulation. In HBEs from \u2206F508-CF patients, PDE4 inhibition or FSK treatment induced small ISC increases in some but not all cultures. To enhance CFTR function, we tested \u2206F508-cultures after partial rescue of CFTR expression through incubation at low temperature (27\u00b0C for 48 h) or treatment with \"small molecule correctors\". Temperature-corrected \u2206F508-HBEs displayed a similar pattern of responses compared to non-CF cultures; but the amplitude of ISC changes was smaller. PDE4 inhibition increased basal ISC, potentiated ISOstimulated ISC, and delayed the return of ISC to basal levels upon termination of \u03b2-AR stimulation. An initial experiment using cultures treated with the \"small-molecule corrector\" VRT325 (20 \u00b5M;37\u00b0C) mirrored the effects of PDE4 inhibition in temperature-corrected HBEs. PDE4 inhibition increased basal ISC in \u2206F508-HBEs to only 30% of the levels obtained with FSK. However, PDE4 inhibition can potentiate the effect of cAMP stimuli, such as \u03b2-AR agonists, to fully activate CFTR. More importantly, PDE4 inhibition represents a viable therapeutic approach given the clinical use of the PDE4 inhibitor Roflumilast, whereas FSK treatment does not. Since restoring 5% of CFTR function may ameliorate the severity of CF, the effects of PDE4 inhibition on ISC in \u2206F508-HBEs have therapeutic relevance. The efficacy of PDE4 inhibition to increase CFTR-dependent ISC increases proportionally with increased CFTR expression (\u2206ISC in non-corrected CF-HBEs < \u2206ISC in corrected CF-HBEs < \u2206ISC in non-CF HBEs). Thus, a treatment regimen combining a PDE4 inhibitor and a CFTR-corrector is a more promising therapeutic approach for CF than either drug by itself.

            "text": "There is broad agreement that inflammation is an early and major contributor to lung disease in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). The CF pig model provides a unique opportunity to study the timing of the onset of infection and inflammation in the CF lung. We previously showed that newborn CF pigs exhibit impaired innate immunity in the absence of pulmonary inflammation. This observation suggests that a host defense defect precedes the onset of inflammation in the CF lung; however, it does not address the possibility that CF lung disease may be further complicated by an impaired ability to respond appropriately to inflammatory stimuli. Here we test the hypothesis that acute inflammatory responses are perturbed in the absence of functional CFTR. We first investigated the responses of newborn CF and non-CF pigs to an inflammatory stimulus, heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (SA). SA was aerosolized into the lungs of newborn CF pigs and non-CF littermate controls. At 4 hours post-instillation, animals were euthanized and pulmonary inflammation was assessed. We found that, for both CF and non-CF pigs, a SA dose of approximately 10 9 CFU equivalents/animal was sufficient to elicit measurable changes in BAL inflammatory cell counts and IL-8 secretion. Overall, total inflammatory cells, PMN counts, and IL-8 production were similar in BAL fluid collected from CF and non-CF lungs after SA exposure, as were levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ). Histopathological analysis confirmed that PMN infiltration in CF lung and trachea tissue was similar to non-CF littermate controls. Furthermore, we failed to detect significant differences in tissue myeloperoxidase activity in CF and non-CF pigs in response to SA challenge. In parallel, we studied well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cultures derived from CF and non-CF pigs. In agreement with our in vivo results, CF and non-CF epithelia treated with inflammatory stimuli (including TNF, heat-killed SA and gentamicin-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa) produced similar levels of IL-8 and exhibited similar levels of NF-\u03baB activation at 1 and 20 hours post stimulation. Transcriptome array analysis of CF and non-CF pulmonary tissue and primary cultures is ongoing. In sum, we failed to find evidence that acute inflammatory responses are altered in newborn CF pigs. Our study does not rule out CF-associated problems with the in vivo resolution phase of the inflammatory response or genotype specific differences in the response to chronic inflammatory stimuli. These combined in vitro and in vivo approaches provide new insights into the complex relationship between loss of CFTR function and pulmonary inflammation. Supported by P01 HL-51670, P01 HL-091842, CFF, HHMI, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust. We recently demonstrated that in addition to apical P2Y2-receptor agonists (e.g., ATP), serine proteases acting via basolateral protease activated receptor (PAR)1 and PAR2, and neutrophil elastase via unknown basolateral receptor/s are potent mucin secretagogues in airway epithelium. Here, we present data indicating that these different agonists require activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) to promote mucin secretion in both normal and CF airway goblet cells. Thus, mucin secretion induced by either PAR1 or PAR2 agonists, ATP, or elastase was markedly reduced in non-CF and CF primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells pre-treated with the ROCK inhibitors H1152 or Y27632. Moreover, mucin secretion in response to PAR agonists or ATP was diminished in HBE cell cultures stably-expressing shRNAs that specifically decreased expression of ROCK1 or ROCK2. Similarly, in airway goblet-like Calu-3 cells, PAR agonist-and elastase-stimulated mucin secretion was also blocked by ROCK inhibitors H1152 and Y27632, as well as ROCK1 and ROCK2 shRNA.",

How this pathology is linked to mutations in the CFTR and abnormal Cl -/HCO 3 transport in CF epithelia remains unclear. Mucin formation, granular storage, and secretion into airway lumen are highly-regulated processes critical for normal lung physiology, yet our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is rudimentary. In this study, to gain mechanistic insights into the mucin secretion process we developed a real-time imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and applied it to acridine orange (AO)-stained Calu-3 cells. Confocal and fluorescence life time microscopy revealed that AO accumulates in high concentrations in intracellular granules producing a distinct red-shift of the fluorescence maximum (from 525-nm to ~650-nm) and a significant increase in the fluorescence life time (from 4.1-ns to ~12-ns) compared to that in the cytoplasm. TIRF microscopy allows the visualization of the exocytosis of such AO-stained granules and the study of the kinetics of postexocytotic swelling of their fluorescently-labeled content with high sensitivity and a high temporal resolution. Mechanical stimulation of Calu-3 cells resulted in multiple secretion events that were seen in TIRF images as rapidly-expanding bright-fluorescence patches. The rate of their size expansion had a time constant \u03c4 between ~300-ms to ~1.5-s. After full expansion the mucus patch showed gradual decay of its fluorescence intensity with \u03c4 of 10-to 25-s. Under our experimental configuration secreted mucus remains in a confined (~0.1 \u00b5m thick) layer between the apical cell membrane and the glass substrate, therefore the decay of fluorescence is mainly due to lateral diffusion of the fluorescent dye AO out of the mucus patch. Analysis of the fluorescence decay indicated that AO diffusion coefficient D (0.75x10 -6 cm 2 /s) was ~10-fold smaller compared to that in bulk aqueous solution, consistent with significantly slower AO diffusion in a mucus gel. Estimates of the final volume of the released granule contents were in the range of 20-to 150-\u00b5m 3 , which represent several-hundred-fold volume expansion for a typical granule of 0.4-\u00b5m to 1-\u00b5m diameter. In summary, the TIRF imaging assay allows the study of exocytosis of single mucin granules and the monitoring in real-time of post-exocytotic mucin swelling with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. This approach should help future investigations of mucin secretion in normal and CF epithelial cells and to test the role of CFTR in this process.

            "text": "Ballard, S.T.; Walker, J.R. Department of Physiology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA Anion secretion across the surface and glandular epithelia of airways is mediated by both CFTR and TMEM16A anion channels which function as the efflux pathway for Cland HCO 3 across the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. Loop diuretics inhibit Clsecretion across airway epithelia through selective blockade of NKCC cotransporters in the basolateral membrane of secretory cells. A previous study with cannulated ex vivo porcine bronchi demonstrated that the loop diuretic bumetanide inhibited acetylcholine-stimulated mucous liquid secretion by 70% (Trout et al. Am J Physiol 275:L1095, 1998). Although it was assumed that all of the bumetanideinsensitive liquid secretion in this study was driven by the active secretion of HCO 3 -, the concentration of HCO 3 in the mucous liquid was only 63.2\u00b1 5.0 meq/L after 2 hr, much lower than the expected anion total of approximately 150 meq/L. This previous finding has two potential explanations. First, the bumetanide-pretreated airways secrete 150 meq HCO 3 -/L with the majority of this anion diffusing out of the airway lumen across the epithelial barrier and being replaced by Clinflux during the 2 hr experiments. Second, a bumetanide-insensitive Clsecretion pathway is also present in porcine airway epithelia that sustains Clsecretion in the presence of this loop diuretic. We tested the first possibility by instilling either isosmotic NaHCO 3 (initially 0 meq Cl -/L) or isosmotic NaCl (initially 0 meq HCO 3 -/L) solutions into the lumen of isolated, cannulated porcine bronchi that were immersed in normal Krebs solution (25 meq HCO 3 -/L; 122 meq Cl -/L). Acetazolamide (10 \u00b5M) was added to the bath to inhibit carbonic anhydrase activity, but no acetylcholine was present. After 2 hr, the HCO 3 concentration in the nominally 150 meq HCO 3 -/L instillates had fallen to 67.8\u00b111.9 meq HCO 3 -/L (n=8), a value that approximated what was previously measured in the study by Trout et al. In the airways that were filled with isosmotic NaCl (initially HCO 3 free), the HCO 3 concentration had risen to 8.2\u00b12.0 meq HCO 3 -/L (n=8). These data confirm the notion that the porcine bronchial epithelium is permeable to HCO 3 and thus cannot maintain large HCO 3 gradients across this barrier over time.",

Dysfunction of CFTR affects multiple organ systems, but most mortality results from lung disease. At birth the CF lung lacks the infection, inflammation, mucus plugging and airway remodeling that characterizes later CF lung disease. Some human studies suggest that mucociliary transport is defective in CF. This has led to the hypothesis that dysfunctional mucociliary transport initiates CF lung disease. However, such studies have not been conducted in newborns and thus mucociliary transport defects might be secondary to disease, rather than directly due to loss of CFTR function. We recently generated a CF pig model that recapitulates many findings seen in humans with CF, including the spontaneous development of lung disease. Within hours of birth, they manifest a host defense defect against bacteria. We hypothesized that newborn CF pigs would exhibit reduced mucociliary transport compared to non-CF pigs. To measure mucociliary transport, we developed a computerized tomography (CT) based assay. Briefly, we delivered radiopaque particles to airways and subsequently acquired serial CT images. Using a Cartesian coordinate system, we determined individual particle locations and quantified individual particle velocities and trajectories. Analysis of particle trajectory revealed that particles preferentially travel to the anterior trachea in a gravity-independent manner. We found that newborn pig non-CF maximum particle velocity was 11\u00b13 mm/min. We are currently analyzing particle velocities in newborn pig CF airways. These studies provide in vivo assessment of 3-dimensional mucociliary transport in newborn pigs. These studies will aid understanding of mucociliary transport and its role in the origin of CF lung disease. Objectives: To determine the effects of hypertonic saline nebulisation during hospitalisation for an exacerbation of CF lung disease on length of hospital stay, day of exacerbation resolution, and improvement in lung function, symptom severity, oxygenation, bacterial load, exercise tolerance and quality of life.",

Airway submucosal glands contribute most of the mucus and antimicrobial factors in the upper airways, which are important for the normal lung host defense. There is increasing evidence that submucosal glands function abnormally in the CF airways. Airway submucosal glands from CF patients and animal models of CF fail to trigger secretion when stimulated with some secretagogues (e.g. vasoactive intestinal peptide and substance P). Thus, it has been proposed that CF airways suffer from reduced delivery of antimicrobial factors and mucus that would abate mucociliary clearance and facilitate infection. However, the effect of inhalation of bacteria on submucosal gland mucus secretion is not fully understood. Our objective is to study the response of airway submucosal gland to bacteria inhalation and the role of CFTR. When inhaled pathogens land on the airway, they trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and these are elevated in CF airways. Thus, we tested the effects of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 on submucosal glands mucus secretions and the role of CFTR. Secretion assay experiment show that all the proinflammatory cytokines tested, IL-1\u03b2 (50 ng mL -1 ), IL-6 (50 ng mL -1 ) and TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng mL -1 ), stimulate submucosal glands mucus secretion through CFTR-dependent mechanism, which can be blocked with CFTRinh 172 (100 \u00b5mol L -1 ). Also, the results indicate that IL-1\u03b2 stimulation triggers a cAMP intracellular second messenger pathway. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase with the blocker SQ22536 (0.5 mmol L -1 ) reduced mucus secretion by IL-1\u03b2-stimulated submucosal glands while treatment increasing cAMP level with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 mmol L -1 ) increased mucus secretion. Using scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique (SIET), that directly measures the flux and species of ion transported across epithelia, we were able to determine that both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 act directly on the serous acini of the glands. These cytokines stimulate transepithelial transport of Na + and Clbut not K + through a cAMP-PKA pathway. The Na + and Cltransport triggered by IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was blocked by the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172. The results indicate that IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, released in response to bacteria, stimulates CFTR-mediated transport that would increase mucus and antimicrobial factors that would help expel the pathogen from the airways. In CF airways, however, this response may be lost, resulting in reduced delivery of antimicrobial factors and development of CF airway disease. This is the first direct measurement of ion transport across a single anatomical domain of the submucosal glands. In the future, the role of the other segments of airway submucosal gland on modulating the ion composition of the secreted fluid will be determined.",

There is evidence showing that cystic fibrosis lung disease reflects the failure of the innate defense mechanisms of the lung against inhaled organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Normal airways are protected from inhaled \"insults\" by a complex immune defense system that includes mucus containing antimicrobial factor that traps and inactivates bacteria favoring clearance from the airways. Recently, it has been suggested that airway submucosal gland dysfunction is a primary defect in CF that may contribute to airway pathobiology. In normal airways inhalation of bacteria would trigger antimicrobial factors and mucus secretion by submucosal glands in the upper airways, but this response would be missing in CF resulting in reduced delivery of antimicrobial factors, thus facilitating infection. However, the response of airway submucosal glands to inhalation of bacteria has never been directly tested. One of the main obstacles to study bacteria-airway interaction in situ is the lack of suitable techniques with appropriate resolution and contrast. There is substantial evidence that synchrotron-based phase contrast imaging (PCI) and diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) can be used to investigate the air/fluid interface in the lung. The large differences in refractive index between the air and fluids/tissue give a very strong refraction signature that is easily detected using phase related imaging methods.",

The profibrotic pathway described here is a cause of lung injury and pulmonary decline in diseases such as IPF, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) and scleroderma-associated ILD, but has not been reported previously in CF. We propose that this pathologic mechanism -which is strongly manifest in both human and porcine cystic fibrosis lungs-confers abnormalities in lung mechanics, gas exchange, and hemodynamics. Importantly, tissues from maturing CF piglets demonstrate pronounced airway and vascular remodeling with extensive myofibroblast proliferation in areas of obliterative fibrosis. The CF pig should therefore serve as an important model to investigate longitudinal fibrogenesis and causative myofibroblast proliferation, including changes that occur at the inception of cystic fibrosis lung injury. To elucidate how ANO1 protein is regulated, we performed micro-RNA (miRNA) profiling because miRNA are an important class of regulators of gene expression. Thus, miRNA are predicted to regulate more than 50% of mammalian proteins.

            "text": "Muc3 (17) Cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to mutations in the CFTR gene, which cause a massively proinflammatory phenotype in the CF airway. The chemical basis of the inflammation is hyper-production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by CF airway epithelial cells, based on both an intrinsic mutation-dependent mechanism, and by infection. In infection-free, cultured CF lung epithelial cells, high levels of the microRNA (miR), miR-155 is responsible for hyperexpression of IL-8. However, whether infection-induced IL-8 expression in CF cells is also mediated by miR-155 is not known. We have hypothesized that miR-155 might be a general mediator of enhanced IL-8 expression in CF cells, either in response to other cytokine/chemokine mediators of inflammation, or following exposure to infectious agents. We have found that a reduction in miR-155 accompanies suppression of IL-8 by either the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, or by inhibition of ambient IL-1\u03b2 with a neutralizing antibody. However, attempts to elevate IL-8 levels with either intact bacteria (viz. a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)), or lipopolysacchride (LPS), were unable to elevate miR-155 above its intrinsically high level in the absence of these agents. Instead, in response to PAinfection, the CF cells modestly suppress the expression of miR-155. Instead, the cells express a novel set of miRs, including miR-215. The predicted module of mRNA targets focus on activation of the NF\u03baB signaling pathway, and on the pro-apoptotic p53 signaling pathway. These data indi-cate that CF lung epithelial cells are at a serious survival disadvantage when confronted with P. aeruginosa, or bacterial cell products. In contrast, GCH is absent in the airway epithelia of newborn CF pigs. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been shown to induce GCH in cultured airway epithelia.",

The amounts of GCH induced in non-CF and CF epithelia were not significantly different. IL-13 administration also led to significant decreases in ciliated cell populations in all treated groups, with these changes again being similar between non-CF and CF epithelia. In summary, IL-13 induces similar GCH in both CF and non-CF airway epithelia. These findings suggest that the GCH found in CF is likely secondary to chronic infection and inflammation rather than a primary consequence of decreased CFTR function. The CF mutant mouse nasal epithelium, excised and in situ, is frequently used as a model of CFTR deficient airway and in pharmacological and therapeutic gene correction studies. However, this tissue is highly complex, consisting of olfactory and respiratory epithelium, as well as an extensive subepithelial gland system covering an intricately septated nasal cavity. Prominent among the reported phenotypic characteristics of CFTR deficient (KO) mice are an enhanced amiloride response, and abnormal mucous blebbing in the nasal airway epithelium. Further, a distinct age dependent degeneration of the neuronal layer of olfactory epithelium is observed (Grubb, 2007; Grubb 2009; Hilliard 2008) . It was suggested that the enhanced amiloride response would indicate enhanced ENaC dependent fluid resorption, and that this could explain the neuronal degeneration.",

Skulls from CFTR deficient and normal mice were collected from animals aged 30-34 weeks (N= 5-10 per experimental group). After fixation and decalcification histological analysis was performed. We could confirm that in CFTR KO (FVB) olfactory epithelium a significant reduction of neuronal cell layer occurred (from average 8 to 3 nuclei, P< 0.01). However, no such degeneration was observed in F508del CFTR (FVB, C57Bl/6, 129/FVB) homozygous mice. We previously reported that excised olfactory epithelium of both CFTR KO (FVB) and F508del CFTR (FVB) show a five to six fold enhanced amiloride response in Ussing chambers. Similar observations were made in F508del CFTR mice backcrossed to C57Bl/6 and in the 129/FVB outbred strain (Wilke, 2011). We can therefore rule out this parameter as a single cause of the neuronal degeneration The lack of neuronal degeneration does correlate with a forskolin response of olfactory epithelium in F508del CFTR (FVB), presumably caused by residual activity of mutant CFTR in this tissue, which is absent in CFTR KO (FVB) (Wilke, 2011). This residual activity, expressed in a specific cell type (brush cell) in the mouse olfactory epithelium, apparently corrects neuronal degeneration. However, the residual CFTR activity was not sufficient to prevent mucous blebbing, which was observed in mutant nasal airway of all F508del CFTR strains, but not in wild-type littermates. Further, it did not prevent the enhanced amiloride response observed under Ussing chamber conditions.",

The relevance of these data for human CF pathology remains to be investigated in the light of reported F508del CFTR expression in nasal airway epithelium. We investigate the molecular pathways involved in CF lung disease to define new druggable targets. We previously observed that lung injury causes sustained induction of the EGFR agonist Amphiregulin (AREG) and IL-6 in F508del CFTR mutant mice (Cftr tm1eur) compared to normal. We hypothesise that these pathways contribute to abnormal resolution of injury (epithelial metaplasia, fibrosis) and inflammation in CF lung disease. Both AREG and the IL-6 co-receptor IL6-R are substrates of the membranebound metalloproteinase (\"sheddase\") ADAM17, allowing trans-activation of neighbouring cells by cleavage of their active extracellular domains.

In the contractile phenotype of human ASM both IL-4 and IgE increase the gene expression of IL-8. Taken together,these data suggest links between increased circulating IgE, such as is seen with atopy, drug allergy and ABPA, and the ASM expression of MLCK, and a short circuit stimulation by IgE and IL-4 of gene expression of IL-8, known to increase the phosphorylation of MLC in CF ASM. Thus, IgE, IL-4 and IL-8 appear to work cooperatively and potentially synergistically to augment the phosphorylation of MLC in ASM and likely contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness in atopic states and with common bacterial infections in CF. Proteolytic cleavage of the endogenous \u03b1 and \u03b3 subunits of ENaC (by channel activating proteases (CAPS)), is a key regulatory mechanism for ENaC channel activity. Excessive ENaC activity is a feature of CF which contributes to the depletion of the ASL (airway surface liquid) with resultant impairment of mucociliary function. Growing evidence suggests protease/protease inhibitor imbalance may underlie increased Na + absorption in CF airway epithelia therefore inhibition of the CAPS-ENaC signalling axis represents a potential therapeutic target to restore mucociliary function.",

In experiments where mucins were assessed by a WGA sandwich ELISA, in which the mucins bind the lectin electrostatically, no effects of MANS, or the control, peptides were observed, for either baseline or agonist stimulated mucin secretion.

Secretion from DNP-IgE sensitized cells was determined as \u03b2-hexosaminidase (\u03b2Hex) release, following 30 m of stimulation with DNP-albumin. \u03b2Hex secretion in MARCKS deficient mast cells was elevated over WT controls at all concentrations tested, by 34 +/-5% and significantly so at the highest dose tested (3 ng/ml). \u03b2Hex secretion from mast cells deficient instead for the related, MARCKS-related protein (MRP) was unaffected, suggesting the stimulatory effects of MARCKS deficiency was specific. The data suggest that MARCKS is not essential for regulated exocytosis, but may instead play a negative modulatory role. To test this notion, the time course of \u03b2Hex release from WT and MARCKS deficient mast cells stimulated to secrete with 3 ng/mL DNP was examined. \u03b2Hex release from MARCKS deficient mast cells was complete just 3 min following stimulation, and was elevated over WT cells at 1, 2, and 3 m; secretion from WT cells was not complete until the 5 m time point.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems, including the airways, and is known to affect women more severely than men. We have previously shown that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), acting through estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ESR1), inhibits store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in airway epithelia and have proposed that this leads to a reduction in Clsecretion. SOCE is regulated by STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ -sensing protein. Depletion of ER-Ca 2+ initiates translocation of STIM1 to the ER-plasma membrane junction where it aggregates and interacts with the store-operated Ca 2+ channel Orai1, to induce Ca 2+ influx. To better understand this process, we tested the hypothesis that ESR1 prevents Ca 2+ influx by inhibiting STIM1 function. Immunofluorescence studies were performed on polarized human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) to determine STIM1 localization. Diffuse STIM1 staining was visible under basal conditions. Upon ER-Ca 2+ depletion, STIM1 translocated to the apical membrane. Pretreatment with E2 prevented STIM1 from translocating to the apical membrane, suggesting that STIM1 motility was inhibited by E2. Calcium imaging studies were also performed on HBECs. Because STIM1 localized to the apical membrane in HBECs we specifically monitored apical Ca 2+ influx by placing the basolateral surface in a calcium free Ringer's solution. We observed a significant decrease in apical Ca 2+ influx in HBECs that were pretreated with E2. This indicates that there is an apical Ca 2+ channel that is inhibited by E2, which is most likely due to mislocalization of STIM1 following ER Ca 2+ depletion. To better study the effects of E2 on STIM1, we utilized HEK293 cells that were expressing fluorescently tagged STIM1 constructs and ESR1-CFP. We found that E2 pretreatment reduced STIM1-STIM1 FRET to basal levels after ER-Ca 2+ depletion, suggesting that E2 inhibits normal aggregation of STIM1. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies revealed that E2 pretreatment significantly decreased STIM1 motility, without inducing puncta formation, and that depletion of ER-Ca 2+ had no further effect. FRAP studies were also performed on a STIM1-YFP truncation mutant (570STOP), which removes 115 amino acids from the cytoplasmic region of STIM1. 570STOP was insensitive to E2, unlike WT STIM1, suggesting that STIM1's C-terminus is required for the inhibitory effect of E2. We next probed the phosphorylation status of STIM1-YFP and 570STOP \u00b1 E2 using a phosphoserine antibody. Under basal conditions, STIM1-YFP was phosphorylated. However, cells that were treated with E2 displayed a significant reduction in phosphorylation. We did not observe 570STOP phosphorylation basally or after E2 treatment, indicating that the C-terminus of STIM1 contains the phosphorylation sites. Overall, these data suggest that E2 inhibits basal phosphorylation of STIM1, which may disable STIM1 aggregation and trafficking to the apical membrane in HBECs.",

There was significant loss of immunoreactivity to both MUC5AC and MUC5B antibodies in CF sputum samples over time, indicating degradation of mucins by proteases within sputum and supported by altered electrophoretic migration. In some subjects mucins are already significantly degraded in expectorated secretions. Secretions retained in the lung may be quite different from those expectorated, in terms both of rheology and biochemistry. This may lead to an under-estimation of the importance of mucins in determining physical properties of mucus in CF. Acute and chronic neutrophilic infiltration underlies pathological changes in numerous disease states, including chronic bronchitis (CB) and cystic fibrosis (CF). Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a prominent neutrophilderived serine protease found in abundance in lung disorders such as CB and CF. Recently, it has been suggested that neutrophilic inflammation may result in an acquired change of epithelial ion transport. For example, in chronic obstructive bronchitis and idiopathic bronchiectasis (two neutrophilic lung disorders) there is evidence for loss of CFTR activity. Chronic inflammation is also a well documented and principal cause of the progression of lung disease in CF.

Measurements were performed post-acquisition from Z-stack images using Imaris\u00ae 3D imaging software for the placement of measurement spheres within the cell borders of GCs and adjacent, non-secretory enterocytes. In studies of enteroids from six WT and CF gender-matched littermate paired mice, pH i was not different between WT and CF GCs (WT= 7.40 \u00b1 0.04; CF= 7.40 \u00b1 0.04, ns, n = 2-3 GCs/culture in 2-3 enteroids/mouse).

            "text": "Conclusions: There are differences in nasal mucosal inflammatory cell populations between CF and WT mice, apparently independent of infection. These data suggest there may be a primary, CFTR related immune dysregulation in the airway mucosa. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) impacts nearly half of the adult CF patients in the U.S. and can start at an early age. The pathological consequences of diabetes in CF patients are severe; CFRD patients have a significant increase in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations and an accelerated decline in lung function resulting in dramatically shortened lifespan. Despite the significant frequency of CFRD, little is known about how the inability to control extracellular glucose levels impacts airway function in CF. Glucose provides an easily metabolized energy source for airway microbes, and high glucose induces oxidative stress, which further promotes an already unbalanced redox environment. In CFBE cells, 16HBE cells, and primary airway epithelial cells, we studied the impact of expression of delF508-CFTR on the two components that comprise the airway glucose barrier: tight junctions, which help limit the flux of glucose into the airway surface liquid, and epithelial cell glucose transporters, which work to remove glucose from the airway surface fluid. Airway epithelial cells express several glucose transporter genes and the insulin receptor gene, as shown by qRT-PCR; levels of several genes were altered in CF cells compared to WT cells. We found that the localization of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter, GLUT4, is altered in CF cells; GLUT4 is predominantly trapped in the ER and perinuclear compartments in CFBE cells expressing delF508-CFTR and does not traffic to the plasma membrane in response to insulin, while GLUT4 trafficked to the membrane efficiently in WT cells. CF cells also exhibited an increase in transepithelial permeability in response to TNF\u03b1 and to high-glucose medium, while WT cells were able to recover tight junction function within 3 hours of exposure. High glucose also induced an increase in paracellular flux of calcein and Texas Red Dextran, and the rates were ~2-fold higher in CF cells compared to WT. Using a dual-luciferase-based reporter assay that measures the activation of transcription factors associated with ER stress and the unfolded protein response, we found that cells expressing delF508-CFTR exhibited ~3.5 fold higher levels of ER stress than cells expressing WT-CFTR. In both cases, ER stress was amplified upon exposure to TNF\u03b1 and to high-glucose medium, although the response was much larger in CF cells. These studies suggest that ER stress amplified by airway epithelial cell expression of delF508-CFTR impairs the airway glucose barrier and may predispose the lungs of CF patients to the detrimental consequences of systemic diabetes associated with CFRD. ( Airway smooth muscle dysfunction and remodeling are found in cystic fibrosis (CF). We have previously found that tracheal airway smooth muscle from newborn CF pigs has an impaired contractile response to acetylcholine and an enhanced relaxation response to isoproterenol. These findings, in addition to the narrowed airways and abnormal appearing airway smooth muscle bundles in newborn CF porcine tracheas, led us to hypothesize that CF airway smooth muscle is in a hyper-contracted state. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated airway relaxation in precision cut lung slices made from non-CF and CF newborn pig tracheal lobes. By using precision cut lung slices, we were able to study airway smooth muscle at its in situ length, smaller lumen airways, and under more in vivo conditions. Following isoproterenol treatment, CF airways tended to relax (increase lumen area) to a greater extent than non-CF airways suggesting that the CF airways are precontracted. We then isolated airway smooth muscle from non-CF and CF newborn pig tracheas to assess phosphorylation of the contractile protein myosin light chain, an indicator of airway smooth muscle contraction. Preliminary studies suggest that the relative ratio of phosphorylated myosin light chain to total myosin light chain was increased in CF compared to non-CF airway smooth muscle samples (35% vs. 18%). These findings suggest that CFTR plays an important role in the regulation of airway smooth muscle contraction and relaxation.",

More importantly these immune proteins are highly degraded in sputum of CF patients, such that only very small amounts of intact, and presumably functional, proteins are present. Given the structural stability of immunoglobulin, this was a striking finding suggesting potent proteolytic cleavage in the bronchoalveolar fluid of CF patients. These preliminary findings suggest that humoral immunity is significantly compromised in the CF lung, which may contribute to persistent colonization and infection with various respiratory pathogens. Our preliminary findings need to be confirmed in a larger sample of CF patients and healthy volunteers. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This gene encodes an ion channel that conducts chloride and bicarbonate. Bacterial tracheobronchitis is one of the hallmarks of CF lung pathology; it occurs early in the disease course and contributes significantly to the pathophysiology. Prior data showed the presence of defective bicarbonate secretion in CF airway epithelia and reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) pH. We hypothesized that reduced pH impairs the activity of ASL antimicrobials. To test this hypothesis in vitro, we used bioluminescent reporter bacterial strains. We incubated E. coli in low nutrient medium (1% Tryptic Soy Broth, 10 mM HEPES) adjusted to a range of pH values from 6.8-8.0. We tested the ability of lysozyme and lactoferrin, the two most abundant antimicrobials in ASL, to kill E. coli. We measured luminescence to assess E. coli viability. We found that as pH values increased, lower concentrations of lysozyme and lactoferrin were required to reduce luminescence by 50% (IC50). We also incubated a luminescent S. aureus; a common pathogen found in CF, with lysozyme and lactoferrin. We found increased killing with higher pH values. To test if bacterial killing by ASL was also pH-dependent, we collected methacholine-stimulated ASL from newborn non-CF pigs and adjusted pH to a range from 6.8-8.0. We used gold grids coated with S. aureus and determined the percentage of live and dead bacteria with SYTO9/PI probes. We found that increasing pH promoted more bacterial killing. These data indicate that within the range of pH 6.8 -8.0, lysozyme, lactoferrin and ASL are more effective in killing bacteria at higher pH values. These results may aid in understanding CF pathogenesis and suggest new therapeutic interventions. Background: Single-cell analysis has recently demonstrated the presence of at least two subsets among live neutrophils that are homing to the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In comparison to their blood counterparts, CF airway neutrophils display pronounced changes in function (e.g., active elastase release) and signaling (e.g., activation of cAMP response element binding protein -CREB-and mammalian target of rapamycin -mTOR-pathways). Thus, live CF airway neutrophils may be key contributors to disease and attractive targets for new therapies. Thus far, live CF airway neutrophils have only been analyzed using immunophenotyping methods. Based on the presence of active CREB and mTOR signaling in these cells, it is conceivable that significant transcriptional changes also occur in these cells, which the present study seeks to identify.",

Our results, based on highly pure populations of live CF airway neutrophils, are consistent with recent studies in diseases other than CF, and challenge the conventional paradigm of mature neutrophils being unable to undergo transcriptional reprogramming. Finally, airway neutrophils sorted into discrete functional subsets show further evidence of transcriptional differentiation. Taken together, our results support the notion that specific functional and transcriptional pathways are at play in live airway neutrophils homing to CF airways. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by chronic bacterial infection of the lung and destruction of lung tissue eventually leading to respiratory failure. CF neutrophils are recruited to the site of infection, yet paradoxically fail to eradicate pathogens. Previous studies have shown that the CFTR is expressed in resting neutrophils and was also detected in phagocytic vacuoles formed after bacterial engulfment. Reported reasons for impaired vacuolar killing include inadequate hypochlorous acid formation and chlorination of phagocytosed bacteria. However, both the generation of reactive oxy-gen species and activation of antibacterial proteases are essential for adequate vacuolar killing. After phagocytosis of microbes in healthy cells, components of the electron transport chain pump electrons across the membrane of the phagocytic vacuole to form superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the lumen. The movement of electrons is compensated by K + and H + resulting in a hypertonic environment of elevated pH (7.8), optimal for granule protease activation. The aim of this project was to evaluate dysregulated K + influx and inadequate alkalization of the phagocytic vacuole as a cause for impaired bacterial killing in CF.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by chronic airways infections that are nearly impossible to eradicate once established. The diseased CF airway hosts a complex milieu of pathogens, inflammatory cells, and a number of complex metabolites and structural molecules many of which have been liberated by inflamed or necrosing neutrophils. These metabolites make sputum a rich but toxic environment for bacterial colonizers which must adapt quickly or perish. P. aeruginosa adapts to this environment, in part, by forming a biofilm.

We have previously shown that agmatine in CF sputum is positively correlated with inflammatory markers and that agmatine is capable of NF-\u03baB mediated inflammatory signaling in both inflammatory cell culture and in mouse lungs. Furthermore agmatine greatly augments LPS induced NF-kB expression in cell culture and in lung injury experiments. As agmatine is produced by inflammatory cells in the presence of LPS, it is possible that agmatine serves as a cytokine, overlapping the role of catecholamines in immune modulation.

We have shown that the inhibition of endosomal trafficking is due to an alteration in cytoskeletal features, where the decrease in acetylated alpha tubulin (AAT) is most pronounced; however, it is unknown how the loss of CFTR function and trafficking are mechanistically connected. To determine whether the decrease in AAT has functional consequences linked to CF and trafficking, acetylation was reestablished with 10 \u00b5M tubastatin, an HDAC6 inhibitor. HDAC6 is a cytosolic histone deacetylase along with being a deacetylase of alpha-tubulin. Inhibition of HDAC6 reestablishes AAT levels in CF epithelial cells.

The most famous iminosugar, N-butyl deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, miglustat) is an inhibitor of the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) which produces an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo and reduces the P. aeruginosa induced immunoreactive ceramide expression (Dechecchi 2011). Considering that miglustat inhibits ceramide glucosyl-transferase (GlcCerT) and non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase (GBA2), it could affect the host response to P. aeruginosa through one or more of these pathways of the SL metabolism. We extended the investigation to other iminosugar-based inhibitors of GlcCerT and GBA2: the galactose analog of miglustat N-butyl deoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) and Genz-529468, a very selective inhibitor of GBA2. Bronchial cells were treated with different doses of miglustat and in parallel with NB-DGJ or Genz-529468, before infection and the expression of IL-8 mRNA was measured 4 hrs later. We found that all these inhibitors have an anti-inflammatory effect, with IC50 values 22 \u00b5M (miglustat), 12 \u00b5M (NB-DGJ) and 7nM (Genz-529468) in IB3-1 cells and 23 \u00b5M (miglustat), 5 \u00b5M (NB-DGJ) and 7nM (Genz-529468) in CuFi-1 cells, indicating that Genz-529468 is very potent in reducing the P. aeruginosa-dependent transcription of IL-8. These results suggest that GBA2 could be at least one of the targets of the anti-inflammatory effect of these iminosugars. Therefore, we transiently transfected CuFi-1 cells with specific siRNA for human GBA2 or control duplex scrambled RNA before infection with P. aeruginosa. We obtained a significant reduction of GBA2 expression by about 60% and, in parallel, a significant decrease of transcription of IL-8 by about 50%. These data indicate that GBA2 could play a role in the SL metabolism linked to ceramidemediated signaling processes. Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that the pharmacological modulation of SL metabolism, that can intercept the ceramide metabolic pathway at many levels, may be an effective approach for the treatment of CF lung inflammation. In this respect iminosugar-based compounds could provide novel therapeutic options to reduce the exaggerated inflammatory response in CF lungs.",

We have previously demonstrated that CF airway neutrophils are not subject to rapid necrosis, as previously thought, but rather undergo complex immunomodulation that involves, among other mechanisms, the active release of elastase-rich granules. While neutrophils respond to an exceptionally diverse and redundant array of activating receptors, less is known about the identity of inhibitory receptors that may modulate these cells. Here, we report the first results from an ongoing large study, in which we are investigating the expression in CF blood and airway neutrophils of two potentially inhibitory receptors. These are the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a G\u03b1 i (and G\u03b1 s -)-protein coupled receptor, and the C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (CLEC12A), an ITIM-associated membrane receptor.",

There was no significant difference in MC1R expression between previously described CD16 hi CD63 lo and CD16 lo CD63 hi (elastase non-releasing and elastasereleasing, respectively) subsets. In contrast with MC1R, CLEC12A expression was unimodal on blood neutrophils but bimodal on airway neutrophils. CLEC12A hi and CLEC12A lo airway subsets, showed 4-fold difference in CLEC12A expression among each other, with respectively higher and lower expression levels than in blood neutrophils. This large difference may be accounted for by divergent regulation of this immunomodulatory molecule among neutrophils immediately upon entering the CF airway environment, or by a post-activation downregulation process. To address this question, we compared activated, elastase-releasing CD16 lo CD63 hi airway neutrophils to their CD16 hi CD63 lo counterparts. Consistent with a post-activation downregulation of CLEC12A, the former showed significantly lower expression than the latter (1847\u00b1363 vs. 5969\u00b11308, P=.02).

To form a crack one needs to: 1) create new mucus-air and PCL-air interfaces; and 2) break possible bonds crossing the two layers. We hypothesize that the abnormal mucus clearance for patients with chronic lung disease is due to both the higher adhesion strength between diseased mucus and epithelial cells as well as the higher cohesion strength of the diseased mucus compared with that for normal (healthy) condition. We have developed peel test and cavitation rheology to quantify the mucus-PCL adhesion strength as well as the mucus cohesion strength. It was found that both the adhesion and cohesion strengths increase at higher mucus concentration corresponding to diseased conditions. Such increase of the adhesion and cohesion strengths could be due to the increase of the density of broken bonds at higher mucus concentration. Moreover, the mucus-PCL adhesion strength increases with the separation rate between mucus and cells, which might be due to the increase of energy dissipated into mucus at higher deformation rate. Our findings suggest that rehydrating mucus might reduce both mucus-PCL adhesion strength and mucus cohesion strength, and therefore, restore effective mucus clearance.

Pulmonary disease in CF is the result of severe airway inflammation characterized by the presence of numerous neutrophils. Both chronic infection and the ensuing tissue destruction contribute to inflammation and lead to fatal respiratory failure. Multiple inflammatory pathways have been investigated in CF but the underlying reason why the neutrophilic response is deregulated in the CF lung remains largely unknown. Tissue injury contributes to inflammation when cell death occurs by necrosis leading to the release of pro-inflammatory factors known as alarmins. Alarmins are related to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) molecules, and promote inflammation through their interaction with members of the IL-1R/Toll-Like Receptor family. The objective of this study was to determine whether alarmins are expressed and play a role in CF, which has not been extensively studied. Using immuno-histochemistry on tissue sections from explanted CF lungs, we discovered the striking presence of the alarmin IL-33 in the nuclei of airway epithelial cells (AECs). IL-33 is a recently identified member of the IL-1 family. Following exposure of AECs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa diffusible material (PsaDM) a strong interaction was found between IL-33 mRNA expression and the absence of CFTR using two-way ANOVA. No interaction was detected for three other alarmins tested (S100A9, HMBG1 and IL-1\u03b1). In addition, using immunofluorescence, IL-33 was detected in the nuclei of CF but not non-CF AECs exposed to PsaDM. Based on these results, we focused our investigation on IL-33 as a likely candidate linked to CF pathology. IL-33 binds the ST2 receptor, which we observed on infiltrating leukocytes in tissue sections from CF lungs. Moreover, we found that ST2 was mostly expressed on neutrophils following isolation of circulating leukocytes from CF patients. These results support the notion that neutrophils are targets of IL-33. We next determined whether IL-33, once released, could contribute to neutrophilic inflammation, based on the recent finding that IL-33 promoted neutrophil recruitment and survival during sepsis (1). Pre-treating neutrophils with IL-33 enhanced their recruitment by bacterial-stimulated AECs media, although IL-33 was not directly chemotactic towards neutrophils. Based on these results, we propose that IL-33 is up regulated in CF lung disease and that the presence of IL-33 in the nucleus of CF AECs act as an inflammatory \"time bomb\" if released by tissue injury to increase neutrophilic airway inflammation. Therefore preventing IL-33 action in CF epithelia may decrease inflammation without fully impairing host defence mechanisms. 1 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which transports chloride ions and glutathione. It is not clear how defective CFTR transport results in the viscous, dehydrated airway surface liquid (ASL) that impairs mucociliary function and facilitates bacterial adherence in CF airways. Emerging evidence suggests the downstream consequences of mutated CFTR impact the ability of the innate immune system to maintain homeostasis in CF airways. Host antimicrobial activity is compromised in CF lungs and there is significantly higher survival of bacteria in CF ASL in vitro. Since CF mucus has decreased microbicidal activity, we hypothesized that expression and secretion of immune proteins is altered in CF ASL. To test the hypothesis, global quantitative proteomics of in vitro CF and non-CF ASL was undertaken with a focus on immune proteins. ASL was collected in vitro from three sets of passage twelve life-extended CF (\u2206F508/\u2206F508) and non-CF human bronchial epithelial cell lines (Fulcher ML et al. 2009 ) differentiated at the air liquid interface for fourteen days. Prior to seeding, cells were labeled by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) by feeding CF cells with \"heavy\" isotopes of arginine and lysine ( 13 C 6 -Arg and 13 C 6 , 15 N 2 -Lys) and control cells with the common \"light\" arginine and lysine isotopes ( 12 C 6 -Arg and ( 12 C 6 , 14 N 2 -Lys). Equal volumes of CF and control apical secretions were combined, separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in-gel digested with trypsin, analyzed by LC-MS-MS/MS, and identified proteins were quantified as the ratio of CF over non-CF. Proteins up-regulated in CF were involved in protein degradation, glutathione synthesis, heat shock, and inflammation. Specific up-regulated immune proteins in CF included proteasome members, annexins, S100A protein, IL-1, and IL-8. Proteins down-regulated in CF were involved in protease inhibition, innate immunity, cell death, chaperone pathways, sodium and chloride transport, immune cell migration, and complement activation. Specific down-regulated immune proteins included clusterin, LPLUNC1, TGF\u03b22, and the proteinase inhibitors neutrophil gelatinase, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, antileukoproteinase, and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1. The advantage of the in vitro secretion model is the ability to study uninfected non-inflammatory conditions. Many of the dysregulated immune proteins reported here are opposite to those reported in secretions from chronically infected CF lungs, indicating that the downstream consequences of CFTR in CF airway cells set the stage for chronic inflammation and infection. Differentially expressed proteins are currently being validated by Western blot of apical secretions from independent CF and non-CF ALI cultures. Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is hallmarked by neutrophilic infiltration and inflammation in the lung, there is growing evidence that the resident alveolar macrophage (AM) may modulate the initiation and progression of pulmonary disease. With the advent of early identification of the CF newborn, the potential to intervene to modify inflammation and infection before respiratory symptoms occur drives the need for such investigations. We hypothesized that cftr mutation increases oxidant stress and impairs phagocytosis in the developing AM and that the availability of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) modulates these changes. We evaluated the newborn offspring of C57Bl/6 cftr knockout (S489X) (KO) gut corrected mice at P7-10 days of life and their wild type littermates (WT). A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) analyzed via HPLC for mixed disulfides (MD), a measurement reflective of glutathione bound to cysteine due to oxidation, and GSSG, the oxidized portion of GSH. In the ELF, MD concentration was >4 fold higher in KO compared to WT (p=0.053) while GSSG was increased three fold in KO compared to WT. There were no differences in the percentage of AM isolated from the ELF between groups (WT-87%, KO-87.5%). However, 60% fewer AM were retrieved in cftr KO pups compared to WT (p<0.01). KO AM lacked cftr immunostaining by confocal fluorescent microscopy. Phagocytosis of FITClabeled Staphylococcus aureus was assessed via confocal fluorescent microscopy. Phagocytosis was dramatically impaired by more than 60% in KO compared to WT AM (p<0.05). Exogenous GSH (200 \u00b5M) treatment normalized phagocytosis in KO AM to WT levels (p<0.05 vs without GSH, p=NS vs WT). These data suggest that at baseline in the asymptomatic newborn mouse, GSH oxidation in the ELF was accompanied by impaired function of the cftr KO AM that was modulated by GSH availability. We postulate that although the neonatal CF lung does not demonstrate overt signs of pathology, newborn AM are altered by cftr mutation and may silently contribute to the development of pathology in the CF lung.",

The role of CFTR in pulmonary immune cells is only partially understood. Pulmonary antigen presenting cells (APC) orchestrate the innate and adaptive immune responses in the lung. The present study analyzes the phenotype and immune stimulatory capacity of APC from CFTR knockout (CF) mice and the effect of altered sphingolipid composition in CF on APC. Total numbers of lung APC were lower in CF mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. Expression levels of the maturation markers MHCII, CD40, and CD86 and of the pattern-recognition receptors toll-like receptors (TLR) TLR1, TLR4 and TLR5 on lung APC were decreased in CF APC. The T cell-stimulatory capacity of CF APC was impaired at baseline and following pulmonary infection with respiratory syncytial virus. The level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a mediator of immune cell migration and activation, was decreased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of CF mice compared to WT controls. Whereas, increased expression of S1P receptors on CF APC was observed in CF APC. Culture of CF lung APC with BALF from WT mice normalized expression of MHCII, CD40, and CD86. Supplementation of CF BALF with S1P rescued the reduced expression of MHCII and CD40 in WT lung APC. These findings suggest that APC are impaired in the CF lung and that low S1P affect lung APC function. This provides a link of defective CFTR and pulmonary innate immune dysfunction in CF.",

PE activity increased significantly above control at all concentrations of acrolein (p<0.05 for treatments 1\u00b5M to 1mM).

Microscopically, when particles are diffusing within a viscoelastic gel such as mucus, their steps are not independent from one another as they would be in a viscous fluid like water. The net result is that if a diffusing particle makes a random step right, it is more likely that its next step will be left, or anti-correlated. We demonstrate that the degree to which the diffusive path of a particle is anti-correlated increases with mucus concentration and that the time scale over which the microscopic memory is present in mucus is similar to the fastest relaxation times observed in our macroscopic experiments.

The innate defense of the lung against extracellular pathogens includes both physical and immunological mechanisms that are dependent upon ion transport. The primary physical defense is mucociliary clearance. When mucociliary clearance fails, as in cystic fibrosis (CF), there is a complex immunological response that protects the host. This includes the production of antimicrobial peptides and chemicals by epithelial cells as well as the generation of cytokines that orchestrate the host defense response. We previously demonstrated that interleukin-17A (IL-17), which is critical in the host response against extracellular bacteria, altered airway surface pH in vitro and increased Pendrin mRNA expression in HBE cells treated with IL-17A up to 48 h. Using immunoblotting and confocal immunofluorescence, we confirmed that Pendrin protein expression is increased in IL-17 treated HBE cells and that it is primarily localized to the mucosal surface of the cells. Functional studies using live cell fluorescence microscopy confirmed a novel Cl -/HCO 3 exchange in normal HBE cells treated with IL-17A that was significantly reduced in the presence of siRNA against Pendrin. To study the expression of Pendrin in vivo we used a pneumonia model in mice. Wild type mice were infected with Klebsiella and Staphlococcus pneumoniae, and sacrificed at 6,18,24,48 and 72 hours. Pendrin expression was significantly increased in the lungs of infected mice as compared to vehicle mice at each time point.

Our group recently showed that incubation of airway epithelial cells in presence of Psa diffusible material (PsaDM) activates the ERK1/2 kinase, an enzyme in the pathway of the MAP kinases (Berube J, et al., JBC 2010). Activation of ERK1/2 by phosphorylation leads to an increased secretion of interleukin (IL) -6 and -8 in normal and CF cells. Moreover, loss of CFTR enhances activation of ERK1/2 and the immune response during incubation with PsaDM. This increased immune response leads to increased neutrophils recruitment by CF cells versus normal cells. Implication of CFTR in this mechanism comes from the fact that its re-expression in CF cells corrects the immune response amplification, making them identical to non-CF cells. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is controlled by two upstream kinases, MEK1 and MEK2. The latter are activated by kinases Raf-1 and/or Tpl-2 which respectively derive their signals from growth factors or pathogen recognition receptors. Our hypothesis is that the inflammation caused by Psa may be reduced by neutralization of the signaling pathways upstream of ERK1/2.

At all time points this leads to greater expression of these enzymes in CF versus wild-type cells. We predict that this will result in greater production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, particularly LTB4 and PGE2, from CF airway epithelium. These changes may play a role in the hyperactive inflammatory response of CF. Type I IFNs have long been recognized as an important mediator of host defense against viral pathogens. In cystic fibrosis (CF), viral infection is associated with acquisition of P. aeruginosa and it has been observed that patients infected with P. aeruginosa have worsened morbidity with subsequent viral infection compared to those without preceding bacterial infection. Previously, groups have proposed that Type I IFN therapy might be an appropriate therapy for viral infection in the setting of CF. A more fundamental question is whether P. aeruginosa induces Type I IFN production in vivo and whether this Type I IFN production contributes to host defense or is detrimental. We infected C57Bl/6 mice with P. aeruginosa and demonstrated significant IFN\u03b2 induction as early as 1 hour post infection. In subsequent studies comparing infected C57Bl/6 and IFNARKO mice, we demonstrated that there was significantly more inflammation in the wild type during the innate immune response. Furthermore, there were significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the IFNARKO mice compared to wild type mice. We conducted additional studies in wild type mice that had been pre-treated with Type I IFN and these mice demonstrated increased neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production when compared to wild type mice that were not pretreated. There was no significant difference in bacterial load in the lung or bacterial dissemination when comparing the infected IFNARKO mice to wild type or the Type I IFN-pretreated wild type mice to those that had not been pretreated. These data demonstrate that Type I IFNs are produced during P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection, contribute to airways inflammation during the innate immune response and do not appear to contribute to host defense in a murine model of P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection. Aim: The objective of this study was to use whole exome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with differential risk for chronic Pa infection.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Risk for diabetes in CF appears to be conferred in part by a combination of common variants involved in T2D (TCF7L2, CDKAL1, and CDKN2A/B), common variants in CF-specific modifier genes (SLC26A9) and rare variants in other modifiers (chr 2q35-36. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive autosomal disease that affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. The most common mutation, \u2206F508, causes incorrect folding of the protein, which induces the missregulation of mucociliary clearance, chronic respiratory infection and lung dysfunction. Genotype/phenotype studies have demonstrated significant variation in the severity of the disease. This variability could be related to epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, of gene expression. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between DNA methylation and gene regulation in CF epithelial cells. A combination of immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA and microarray screening covering all the promoter regions of the human genome was used to study the methylation pattern of CF (CuFi-1/CFBE (\u2206F508 homogyzous)) and non-CF (NuLi-1) or CFTR-corrected (corrCFBE) epithelial cell lines. We observed first an overall hypomethylation of \u2206F508 cell lines with however some hypermethylated regions. Interestingly, when CFTR is corrected in CF cells, the methylation profile of 160 promoters returned to the level observed in non-CF cells. These results suggest the presence of a relationship between CFTR expression and methylation profiles of epithelial cells. Using a redundancy analysis (RDA) we identified 56 regions where 60% of the variance of the methylation profiles was explained by \u2206F508 mutation, and less than 20% by the cell type. In order to link promoter methylation profile to gene expression, the transcription level of genes involved in inflammatory processes, present in the 56 regions previously selected by RDA, was validated by qPCR on CF and non-CF cell lines as well as on bronchial epithelial cells isolated from \u2206F508 homozygous patients and non-CF patients. A strong correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression was found for 3 genes that were downregulated by 50% in CF patients: RGS2 (a regulator of G-protein involved in cytokine release), DHRS9 (dehydrogenase/reductase that promotes insulin resistance) and TULP4 (a cytoplasmic protein that mediates the degradation of target proteins). These results demonstrate that, in a homozygote \u2206F508 background, changes in the DNA methylation profile have an impact on gene regulation in CF patients. Meconium ileus presents at birth in ~15% of infants with cystic fibrosis. Later in life, CF patients also suffer from a range of primary and second complications from intestinal malfunction. While CF mice typically do not die at birth from intestinal complication, they have varying extents of intestinal obstruction at weaning depending on the genetic strain. This strain-tostrain variation in weaning-induced intestinal obstruction in CF mice has strong genetic components. Potential intestinal modifier genes in CFTRknockout mice on mixed genetic backgrounds have been mapped to chromosome 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, and 14. Most of the associated chromosomal locations are either positively or negatively correlated with intestinal obstruction and appear to be inherited in a recessive fashion. Intestinal obstruction at weaning onto solid chow is typically very severe and uniformly lethal in inbred C57BL/6J CFTR-KO and \u2206F508/\u2206F508-CFTR mice. In a \u2206F/\u2206F-CFTR C57BL/6J colony at University of Iowa, we observed the emergence of \u2206F/\u2206F-CFTR mice that survived weaning. For many years, CF mice in this colony uniformly died within 1-4 days following weaning onto solid chow. Through selective inbreeding, a sub-colony was established for which all \u2206F/\u2206F-CFTR mice survive weaning and males, but not female, CF animals remained fertile. The purity of the C57BL/6J background in six surviving \u2206F/\u2206F-CFTR mice was confirmed by genome wide SNP analysis using 334 SNP markers informative for the C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ genetic backgrounds and found to be >99.7% C57BL/6J. Defined breedings of two fertile \u2206F/\u2206F males with wild type C57BL6/10j females was used to evaluate the inheritance pattern of the survival locus in F2 \u2206F508/\u2206F508 offspring derived from F1 WT/\u2206F intercrosses. From a cohort of 346 F2 offspring (of which ~25% were \u2206F/\u2206F) the pattern of inheritance supports a single dominant gene survival locus (29% of F2 \u2206F/\u2206F mice died at weaning and 71% survived). This is extremely close to the 75/25 percent expected distribution of a dominant trait and thus suggestive of a Mendelian inheritance of a monogenic survival locus. Preliminary SNP analysis for C57BL/6J and C57BL/10J markers on a small subset (20 survivors and 5 non-survivors) of the F2 cohort derived from intercrossed F1 C57BL/6 x C57BL/10J mice identify two candidate loci associated with survival (LOD score >2.98 and >2.37). Additional SNP analysis is underway on a larger cohort of CF animals. Both these chromosomal regions appear to be unique from previously identified locations associated with weaning survival in CF mice. Interestingly, short circuit current analysis of intestine segments from surviving mice did not demonstrate cAMP-mediated Clcurrent, suggesting that the genetic survival trait does not restore \u2206F508-CFTR function or alter Clconductance. In summary, we believe we have captured a novel spontaneous genetic alteration that behaves as a dominant modifier gene to prevent intestinal obstruction in an inbred C57BL/6J background. Identification of this gene and its function may yield useful information on CF intestinal pathophysiology. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease that affects approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States. The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which encodes a phosphorylation and ATP regulated anion channel expressed on the apical membrane of epithelia. The most common CF-causing mutation, \u2206F508, has defects in processing and reduced channel function. Recently, our lab has developed CFTR-/-and CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508 pig models that recapitulate human CF disease phenotypes. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that gene therapy and pharmacological approaches can restore channel function, though the current methods have limitations and many questions remain unanswered. In this work we aim to determine when CFTR expression is required to alter the CF phenotype and whether restoring CFTR to CF animals will prevent, forestall or reverse disease phenotypes. To answer these questions we are generating CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508 pigs that express inducible CFTR in affected epithelia (CFTR\u2206F3Tg). We are using a tet system that includes the doxycyclineinducible reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) and a tetracycline-operator (tet-O) to drive inducible expression of CFTR. Cells bearing all the transgenes have been used as donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer to pig oocytes, and the first several litters have produced viable piglets with variable levels of correction of CF newborn phenotypes. This new porcine model should be valuable in directing future approaches to gene therapy and pharmacological therapies and in further elucidating the pathophysiology of the disease. This work is supported by funds from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health training grant NRSA T32 HL007638. Modeling cystic fibrosis (CF) in animals has presented a challenge due to species and strain-dependent variations in phenotype. Developing a CF rat model has many potential advantages: 1) larger size (versus mice) allows for the evaluation of multiple organs, surgical procedures, and measurement of parameters that are otherwise difficult to obtain in mice; 2) rats are a traditional animal model for pharmacologic and toxicologic studies, an increasing priority for analysis of CFTR modulators; 3) rats have an abundance of submucosal glands and mucous goblet cells in the trachea and lobar bronchi compared to mice, increasing the potential for a pulmonary CF phenotype; and 4) antibodies and other reagents are readily available for protein-based studies in rat versus larger animal models. Importance of alternatives to a CF mouse is further indicated by the recent development of genetically modified porcine and ferret models of the disease. In the present study, we applied zinc finger endonuclease (ZFN) technology towards development of a CF rat. We describe the generation of the first CFTR knockout rat on a Sprague-Dawley background via pronuclear microinjection of ZFNs, which bind and cleave double strand DNA in a sequence-specific manner, leading to insertions/deletions following nonhomologous end joining pathway-mediated repair. The CFTR knockout rats carry a 16 base pair deletion in exon 3, creating a frameshift and a premature termination codon in exon 4. Initial breeding of CFTR heterozygous rats resulted in approximately 27% wild-type pups, 45% heterozygous pups, and 27% homozygous null pups, indicating that the mutation is not embryonically lethal. Measurements of intestinal short-circuit current, analysis of airway surface liquid depth, ciliary beating and mucus clearance rates in excised trachea, together with histopathological analysis of lung, intestine, pancreas and other tissues are planned in order to confirm the null phenotype. Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Grant R464-CR07. Recently an effort is being made to develop treatment for premature termination codons (PTCs) causing human genetic diseases, to promote translational readthrough of the PTC leading to full-length functional proteins. We have previously found that the response to readthrough treatment is correlated with the CFTR transcript levels. One mechanism regulating the level of transcripts carrying PTCs is the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The NMD mechanism degrades transcripts carrying PTCs, preventing truncated protein accumulation. The NMD has a crucial post-transcriptional regulatory role that affects the expression of many physiologic transcripts. We have previously found variability in NMD efficiency among different cell lines, indicating that NMD efficiency is an inherent character of cells that can modulate the response to readthrough treatment. NMD substrates encoding membrane or secreted proteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An imbalance between ER protein folding capacity and the level of proteins that cannot be correctly folded activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). UPR alters the transcriptional and translational cellular programs to enable the cells to cope with the stress.",

As some small-molecule CFTR modulators (VX-809, VX-770) start hitting the clinic and other RNA modulators (ataluren, AON, Kinetin, EGCG) increase their therapeutic potential, correct characterization of CFTR mutations becomes crucial to decide on the most adequate therapeutic strategy [2] .",

CFTR transcripts were analysed by RT-PCR [3] upon extraction from native tissues of CF patients with F508del in one allele and one of the following in the other: 711+1G>T(IVS5), 1716+18672A>G(IVS10), 1717-1G>A(IVS11), 1812-1G>A(IVS11), 1898+1G>T(IVS12), 3120+1G>A(IVS16); or missense mutations: G85E(ex3), R334W(ex7), S549R(ex11), A561E(ex12), and I1234V(ex19). Comparing the transcripts' relative levels from both alleles (reference-F508del levels), our data show that only 1717-1G>A, 1812-1G>A, 3120+1G>A and 1716+18672A>G induce transcript degradation (63-80% of degradation) and the following mutations have an impact on splicing: 711+1G>T-Ex5 skipping (in-frame); I1234V-partial ex19 skipping (last 18nts); whereas 3120+1G>A, 1812-1G>A, 1717-1G>A and 1716+18672A>G alter splicing resulting in frameshift thus PTC introduction and mRNA NMD.

Next, we used them to introduce the following CF-related mutations: 711+1G>T, 711+3A>G, 711+5G>A (IVS5); 2789+5G>A (IVS14b); 3272-26A>G (IVS17a) and 3832A>G (IVS19).

The gel forming mucin, MUC5AC, has long been suspected to play important roles in airway innate immunity and CF disease progression, and has recently been shown to be associated with disease severity (Guo, et al, Mucin variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms and severity of cystic fibrosis lung disease: significant association with MUC5AC. PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25452. Epub 2011 Oct 6.). To advance our understanding of MUC5AC function in CF and potential targeted intervention, it is critical to have complete and accurate genomic and mRNA sequence information. The current reference and alternative human genome assemblies are incomplete at the MUC5AC locus with an estimated 50 kb gap in the middle of the gene, largely due to the presence of Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) sequences. We have constructed a complete genomic and mRNA structure of MUC5AC from working draft genome sequence, partial mRNA nucleotide sequences, and the reference genome. Independent validation of the genomic construct was obtained by comparing the de novo assembly of long sequence reads from 3rd-generation PacBio sequencing of human fosmid clones mapped to the reference genome through end-sequencing. The PacBio long sequence reads (up to 10kb) enabled us to perform successfully de novo assembly across the VNTRs. The MUC5AC exon structure and putative mRNA coding sequence were deduced from the draft genomic sequence by comparing to the longest protein sequence from Uniprot database. The draft exon structure and mRNA sequence were largely verified and extended at both ends by next-gen Illumina sequencing of mRNAs from a number of CF patients' nasal scrape samples. We believe the complete draft genomic sequence of MUC5AC will provide a useful tool to study CF, as well as other respiratory diseases, and general MUC5AC biology.",

CFTR mutations cause CF, a disease characterized by decreased hydration of mucus on epithelial surfaces that ultimately causes destruction of the lungs, liver, pancreas, intestine and vas deferens. Although CF inheritance is monogenic, the severity of disease symptoms varies significantly, even in patients with identical CFTR mutations. Thus, identification of the genetic pathways controlling fluid secretion and/or CFTR activity will be an important step towards discovering disease modifier genes and new therapeutic targets for the treatment of CF. Previously, our lab has used forward genetics in the zebrafish system to uncover a conserved regulator of Cftr and characterize fluid secretion in the intestine. We have now identified two new mutants with excess fluid accumulation in the gut. Our preliminary results indicate that one of these mutants shows Cftr-dependent fluid accumulation and analyses are underway to determine if the second mutant displays Cftr-dependent fluid accumulation. Using a combination of positional cloning and candidate gene approaches, the objective of this study is to isolate the mutated loci responsible for the fluid accumulation phenotype in each mutant. We will also characterize the development of other endodermally derived organs (e.g. pancreas, liver) that express cftr. Identification of new regulators of fluid secretion will be the first step towards the development of new pharmacological agents for therapeutic intervention to improve the quality of life for CF patients. . Candidategene modifier studies demonstrate that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs4073) in the IL-8 promoter is associated with CF lung disease severity: In 1,112 CF patients, 2 copies of the rs4073 risk allele (TT) carried a significant association with lung disease severity (p=0.02). This effect was more pronounced in males (n=608; p=0.001). A luciferase reporter assay showed differential IL-8 expression associated with rs4073 genotype in a human airway cell line (9HTEo) (Hillian et al, 2008 Genes & Immun). We hypothesize that differential expression of IL-8 is correlated with rs4073 genotype in vivo.",

The development of hyperglycemia promotes bacterial colonization and accelerates lung decline. The etiology of CFRD is complex and poorly understood. However, pancreatic beta-cells have been shown to express CFTR, and functional CFTR channel activity is needed for normal patterns of insulin secretion (Edlund et al. 2010, Acta Physiologica). Moreover, pancreatic islets from CF ferrets are smaller than normal, and insulin-positive cells progressively decrease after birth (Olivier et al. 2011, Ped Pulmonol) . Additionally, beta-cell distribution is altered in neonatal CF pigs (Meyerholtz et al. 2011, Ped Pulmonol). These findings suggest that early changes in the endocrine pancreas may take place before the destruction of the exocrine tissue in CF.",

National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA Introduction: Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), considered by many to be the most pathogenic NTM in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, clinical effects of M. abscessus infection in CF patients are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to dramatic declines in FEV1. Treatment regimens consist of months of multiple antibiotics often complicated by significant toxicity. Thus, prognostic factors to help guide treatment decisions are needed. M. abscessus exists in two morphotypes: smooth and rough. Differentiating between the morphotypes in clinical laboratories is not routine, and it is not known if morphotype identification would have prognostic value for CF patients. There is evidence that the rough morphotype is more pathogenic than the smooth, but prior animal models have had limited applicability to human CF airways disease due to dominating systemic disease or use of immunocompromised animals. We used a novel immunocompetent murine model of CF M. abscessus pulmonary infection to test our hypothesis that the rough morphotype is more pathogenic than the smooth morphotype.",

Future studies will further evaluate the potential relationship of morphotype to the clinical variability seen in CF patients infected with M. abscessus, as well as the host factors that may influence conversion from the smooth to the rough morphotype. Ongoing studies with this model are also examining the differences in host response between the species of M. abscessus complex (M. abscessus, M. massiliense, M. bolletii). These results may provide important prognostic data that could influence clinical laboratory reporting practices to better guide clinical treatment decisions. Background: CFTR is expressed in the murine and human large intestine, where it contributes to disease morbidity and mortality from bowel obstruction.

Of the many biologically isolated AAV serotypes, AAV1 and AAV6 share the highest degree of sequence homology, with only six different capsid residues. Both have been reported to infect airway epithelium efficiently from apical membrane, but it remains unclear if the two serotypes behave identically in terms of airway transduction. We compared the transduction efficiencies of rAAV1 and rAAV6 in primary polarized human airway epithelia (HAE) and found significant differences in their abilities to transduce epithelia from the apical and basolateral membranes. rAAV1 transduction was ~10-fold higher than rAAV6 following apical infection, while rAAV6 transduction was ~10-fold higher than rAAV1 following basolateral infection. Furthermore, rAAV6 demonstrated significant polarity of transduction (100-fold; basolateral>>apical), while rAAV1 transduced from both membranes with equal efficiency. To evaluate capsid residues responsible for the observed serotype differences, we mutated the six divergent amino acids either alone or in combination. Results from these studies demonstrated that capsid residues 418 and 513 most significantly controlled membrane polarity differences in transduction between serotypes, with the rAAV6-D418E/K513E mutant demonstrating decreased (~10-fold) basolateral transduction and the rAAV1-E418D/E513K mutant demonstrating a transduction polarity identical to rAAV6-WT. However, none of the rAAV6 mutants obtained apical transduction efficiencies of rAAV1-WT, suggesting that all six divergent capsid residues in AAV1 act in concert to improve apical transduction of HAE and thus rAAV1 may be an ideal choice for gene therapy for airway diseases, such as cystic fibrosis.",

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop diabetes mellitus as they age: 50% of patients over 30 years of age have cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD). Prior to CFRD onset, first phase insulin secretion from CF islets is impaired despite capacity for insulin secretion at later points following glucose challenge. After CFRD onset, structural damage to islets is partial and insufficient alone to cause diabetes. The mechanisms of these structural and functional impairments are not known. Utilizing the porcine CF model (both homozygous null and deltaF508 mutations), we studied fetal (day 54, days 83-90), newborn (pig gestation is ~114 days) and postnatal pig pancreas (2-12 months) for structural changes in the islets using insulin and glucagon immunostaining compared to non-CF. We also measured the fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin and glucagon (by ELISA) in newborn CF and non-CF pigs. Random blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured in postnatal pigs (mean age 4 months). Results are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. Whole pancreas sections from CF and non-CF fetal and neonatal pigs showed no difference in alpha (glucagon) or beta (insulin) immunostaining area density. However, when the cellular density was measured within the remnant lobular tissue of neonatal pigs, there was a significant increase in the islet tissue area density of both alpha and beta cells. The area density of insulin and glucagon immunostaining in postnatal pigs was similar to neonates (no difference in the whole pancreas, increased density within the lobular parenchyma) and not different between CF and non-CF pigs. Fasting blood glucose and glucagon levels in CF newborn pigs were not significantly different from non-CF pigs, but the plasma insulin levels were significantly higher in CF newborns (1.5+0.04 \u00b5U/mL n=5 for non-CF, 2.2+0.2 \u00b5U/mL n=7 for CF, p<0.05). In postnatal randomly fed CF pigs, the blood glucose levels were significantly higher compared to non-CF (92+9 mg/dL n=10 for non-CF, 168+28 mg/dL n=6 for CF; p<0.01) with no difference in HbA1c. In conclusion, postnatal CF pigs develop hyperglycemia over time, but the abnormal glycemic regulation in CF pigs is not accompanied by reductions in islet mass. These findings in CF pigs suggest functional abnormalities in CF islets, similar to functional abnormalities postulated in CFRD patients, and/or deficiency in insulin action. Additional studies of these animals may help understanding the pathogenesis of CFRD.",

            "text": "Supported by NIH, CFF, HHMI. Meconium ileus is a life-threatening complication of cystic fibrosis that is present in about 10-20% of CF infants at birth. The CF pig, a large animal model of CF that closely replicates other human CF phenotypes, is born with meconium ileus that is remarkably similar to the human disease. Both porcine models of CF, CFTR -/and CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 , show 100% penetrance of meconium ileus at birth and thus represent a feasible model to study the pathogenesis of meconium ileus. At birth, CFTR mRNA expression was highest in the proximal porcine small intestine and decreased distally. We detected no CFTR mRNA in the CFTR null porcine intestine. Using confocal immunocytochemistry, we detected CFTR primarily in the crypts of the wild-type, but not CF, newborn intestine. Consistent with CFTR expression, we observed forskolin/IBMX-stimulated short circuit current in excised small intestinal and colonic segments bathed in a media containing both HCO 3 and Cland less current in the absence of Cl -, in agreement with CFTR's role in HCO 3 transport. cAMP-stimulated currents were absent or much reduced in intestinal segments from CFTR null animals. Consistent with CFTR's role in fluid transport, we observed fluid secretion in excised ileal segments of wild-type, but not CF piglets. Because meconium ileus develops during fetal development it has been difficult to understand its origins in humans. To understand the pathogenesis of meconium ileus, we asked if there was a correlation between onset of meconium ileus and CFTR in fetal piglets. Preliminary studies revealed that CFTR mRNA is present as early as 41 d gestation, a period that also corresponds to expression of CFTR in both human and mouse intestine. Likewise, we measured forskolin/IBMX-stimulated current in excised intestine from 35 d fetal wildtype piglets. This evidence of CFTR expression and CFTR-mediated anion transport in piglets in the first trimester of gestation precedes the first visible detection of meconium-like lumenal contents at 54 d gestation. These findings suggest that absence of CFTR expression and function contribute to the pathogenesis of meconium ileus in CFTR null piglets.",

            "text": "Several model systems have been developed to study airway epithelial cells under normal (N) and fluid-depleted (FD) conditions. Considerable variability in such factors as airway surface liquid (ASL) depth and composition were found, but there was good evidence that ASL decreased in CF and was attributed to Na + absorption. The resultant dehydration of the ASL in CF is thought to lead to compromised mucociliary clearance (MC) with mucus accumulation and inflammation. Osmotic agents such as hypertonic saline and mannitol deposited into the airway are postulated to reverse the ionic gradients produced by a failure of epithelial cells to secrete Cland consequent increased Na + absorption. The upper palate of Rana catesbiana has been used in our laboratory to study mucus characteristics and mucus clearance under normal and perturbed conditions. In previous studies when the effects of acute injury were evaluated in the epithelial tissue of the palate (as a model for airway cilia) the molecular biology techniques of zymography (for matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs 2 and 9) and Western blot for tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP 1) yielded results consistent with mammalian and clinical studies. We showed that the epithelium of the frog palate can serve, not only as a physiological model for cilia function but also as a model to study inflammatory mediators. In the present study using blockers of Cland HCO 3 -, we created a fluid-depleted frog palate for the study of osmotic agents on MC, surface liquid depth (SLD) and mucus rigidity with an eventual goal to improve available treatments to aid lung function and reduce adverse effects in CF. Employing hypertonic saline (HS) to test the model, we have shown marked improvement in MC from the FD condition that was corroborated with an increase in SLD compared to the FD condition and a decrease in mucus rigidity. These results are consistent with results in mammalian models and clinical studies that concluded the primary action of an osmolyte placed in the airway is to draw water out of the epithelial cells into the surface liquid and mucus improving MC. Using this model it is possible to create N, FD and restored conditions in the same ex-vivo experiment. Our results corroborated with those obtained in more elaborate mammalian model systems that showed it would be a valid model in which to initially test new osmotic agents. Two recent sets (n=5 each) of experiments using nebulized 2% saline + isotonic Frog Ringer's (2/3 R+ 1/3 distilled water) in one experiment and high molecular weight dextran in another, were more effective than 2% saline alone to restore MC. To show repeatability, the %coefficient of variation of MC was determined in each individual experiment and the sets compared using a t-test which showed no difference in two separate sets of studies of the MC times under N conditions. Thus we can conclude that experiments under relatively standard conditions with subjects drawn from the same population offer a very stable estimate of error variance that can only add confidence to these results. Therefore further studies on these agents or combination of agents are recommended in this model to benefit CF treatment. Study supported by the CIHR.",

We have previously shown that female wild-type mice (Wt, C57BL/6J) fed a genistein-containing diet (600 mg/kg food, 600G) for 1-month have significantly elevated basal levels of jejunal chloride (Cl) secretion (measured as transepithelial short circuit current, Isc) compared to mice fed a genistein-free diet (0G). In Wt mice, this was a gender-specific response to 600G diet; there was no response in males. In this study, we fed male and female R117H cystic fibrosis (CF) mice, either 600G or 0G diet for 1month. Basal Isc was unchanged in 600G male mice (39.2\u00b111.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 , n=9) compared to 0G controls (34.9\u00b17.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 , n=9). Basal Isc was unchanged in 600G female mice (36.7\u00b18.6 \u00b5A/cm 2 , n=10) compared to 0G controls (29.3\u00b16.5 \u00b5A/cm 2 , n=7). Comparable steady-state increases in Isc in response to forskolin (10 \u00b5M, bilateral) were observed in 600G and 0G male and female mice. There was no effect of the inhibitor of the Na/K/2Cl co-transporter, bumetanide (100 \u00b5M, basolateral), on the forskolin-stimulated Isc in either 600G or 0G fed male and female mice. There was no difference in the % inhibition following the addition of acetazolamide (100 \u00b5M, bilateral) to block the bicarbonate secretory component, in 600G fed males (10.3\u00b12.6 %, n=9) and 600G fed females (3.5\u00b14.2 %, n=10), compared to their respective controls. In the male (n=8) and female (n=3-4) R117H mice, there were no measurable changes in jejunum morphology with the diets (villi length, number of goblet cells per villi, crypt depth, number of goblet cells per crypt). These data suggest that in both male and female R117H mice, a 4-week diet treatment with genistein, at this dose of 600G, does not provide any improvements in the overall magnitude of basal or forskolinmediated secretion. These results are in stark contrast to the gender-dependent effects of the same dose and duration of dietary genistein on Wt mice. We have developed a genome-wide phenotyping approach for S. cerevisiae designed to understand regulators of F670del-Yor1 biogenesis as a molecular model for F508del-CFTR. This strategy employs the genomic set of S. cerevisiae loss of function alleles for assessment of gene interactions, defined as a functional dependency of the F670del-Yor1 phenotype on other genes. The S. cerevisiae genome does not contain CFTR, but does include members of the broader ABC transporter family among which the phenylalanine corresponding to F508 is highly conserved. F670del-Yor1 is a mutation that has been characterized for its similarity to F508del-CFTR in terms of protein misfolding and defective cellular trafficking. Yor1 functions as a drug pump, and is the primary cellular resistance factor for the mitochondrial poison, oliogmycin. When cultured on media containing oligomycin, cell proliferation is dramatically influenced by alterations in the biogenesis of F670del-Yor1. By combining the F670del-Yor1 allele into the collection of 5000 S. cerevisiae gene deletion strains, we have shown by quantitative phenotyping that there are hundreds of interacting genes modulating F670del-Yor1 biogenesis. We observe that the network influencing F670del-Yor1 bears strong resemblance to the corresponding network that underlies trafficking of F508del-CFTR, based on homology with human genes reported in the literature. Similarly, we found that the F670del-Yor1 gene network is predictive of novel gene interactions that influence F508del-CFTR processing. In light of these initial results, we recently advanced the predictive power of the model by use of secondary assays designed to prioritize gene interactions most relevant to cystic fibrosis, including: 1) delineating F670del-Yor1 gene interactions that are promoter independent (which we expect to be of highest translational relevance). To address this question, we expressed F670del-Yor1 from distinct promoters and repeated the genome-wide phenotypic survey; 2) establishing F670del-Yor1-dependence of each gene interaction. This is important to exclude genes that directly influence oligomycin sensitivity, independent of F670del-Yor1. We addressed this by quantifying oligomycin resistance when F670del-Yor1 is not expressed in the yeast deletion strain library. In addition to confirming the primary screen, these secondary analyses provide a highly accurate, robust, and detailed view of the F670del-Yor1 interaction network with regard to genes most likely to have human homologs and modulate F508del-CFTR trafficking. The overall approach defines an unbiased screen for CF relevant therapeutic targets and a model for higher order network analysis. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF). For decades, nervous system abnormalities have been reported in patients with CF. However, it has remained possible that such defects were secondary consequences of the disease. To explore this issue, we studied CFTR-/-pigs, which develop disease that closely matches that in people with CF, and assessed the nervous system in newborns. Consistent with earlier reports, we found CFTR transcripts in the central and peripheral nervous systems. We found glial cells to be an important site of CFTR expression and activity, and loss of CFTR affected glial cell Ca 2+ signaling. Because glial cells support axons, we examined axon structure and function in nerve bundles and found reduced axon density in CFTR-/-pigs. Ultrastructural examination revealed myelin sheath abnormalities with characteristics similar to, but less severe than those in known neuropathies. Consistent with this, genes associated with demyelinating and dysmyelinating diseases, including myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein and myelin protein zero were increased in CFTR-/-pigs. To test for functional consequences, we measured the conduction velocity of trigeminal and sciatic nerves and found it to be reduced. In addition, auditory brainstem evoked potentials revealed defects in auditory nerve function. Interestingly, intermediate phenotypes were often observed in CFTR+/-pigs, suggesting a gene dosage effect. These results indicate that loss of CFTR directly affects nervous system function and may explain the longstanding, but previously unexplained findings of altered neural function in people with CF. They also raise the questions of whether nervous system abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of CF or produce a phenotype in people heterozygous for CFTR mutations.",

            "text": "Supported by HHMI, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and NIH (2T32HL007121-36). There are currently over 1,900 different mutations that have been identified in CFTR. For a vast majority of these mutations, the effect on protein expression, processing, and function remains unknown. Cell-based systems can be useful in the evaluation of mutation effect upon function. However, uniform levels of CFTR expression are desirable so that the effect of mutations is correctly interpreted. Transient transfection of cell lines leads to a high level of expression in only a minor subset of cells while stable expression using an expression plasmid under antibiotic selection leads to highly variable expression. One approach to alleviate this variability is to integrate a recombinase target site into the genome so that only one heterologous cDNA is expressed per cell as previously demonstrated for MDCK cells (1) and fetal rat thyroid cells (2) . However, neither cell line is human in origin or derived from tissues affected in CF (e.g. airways). To address this issue, we selected a human bronchial epithelial cell line derived from a CF patient (CFBE41o-; F508del/F508del) for the introduction of recombinase-mediated single cDNA integration. The expression of endogenous CFTR RNA was found to be negligible in several CFBE clonal lines when analyzed by RT-PCR. CFTR protein was also not detected by Western blot indicating that endogenous CFTR will not interfere with functional interpretation of exogenous CFTR mutants. CFBE cells were transfected with pFRT/lacZeo, a plasmid containing an FRT site for targeted recombination, as well as a Zeocin resistance gene for clonal selection. Four Zeocin-resistant cells lines were obtained and integration was checked by Southern blot using a probe specific for the Zeocin resistance gene. After digestion of the genomic DNA with three different restriction enzymes, all four clones revealed bands of the expected plasmid size of 8.1kb, indicating the presence of episomal plasmid. Further inspection of the pFRT vector revealed that it contains the SV40 origin of replication (SV40 ori). CFBEs were immortalized using a plasmid containing the SV40 virus and express the large T antigen, which binds the SV40 ori and enables episomal replication of the pFRT plasmid. To obtain genomic integration of the plasmid, three nucleotides of the SV40 ori were mutated that had previously been shown to prevent large T antigen mediated replication (3). After transfection and selection, single colonies were isolated to create six clones. Integration events were evaluated by Southern blot using EcoRV digested genomic DNA. The blot revealed no bands at the expected plasmid size and a genomic band of approximately 3kb for three of the six clones. These results confirm that a single genomic integration event has occurred for three of the clones, and that the plasmid is no longer able to replicate episomally via its SV40 ori. The CFBE cell line with the FRT recombinase target site provides a new human epithelial cell-based tool to study the effect of disease-associated mutations upon CFTR function. Cystic fibrosis is a disease characterized by mucosal buildup in several organs due to defective fluid secretion caused by mutations in a chloride channel, CFTR. In addition to decreased lung function, many patients also develop pancreatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis related diabetes, and liver fibrosis. Although CFTR has been well characterized in vitro, the pathophysiology of the CF remains poorly understood. With the development of new animal models of CF, symptoms of liver and pancreas disease have been identified early in life, indicating that the defects in the function of these organs may arise during their morphogenesis. To identify the role of CFTR during organogenesis of the liver and pancreas we turned to the zebrafish, a well characterized developmental model. We developed several new reagents which have allowed us to investigate the developmental functions of cftr. Using immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and live imaging of a GFP-tagged cftr transgenic line, we have found that cftr is expressed in the exocrine pancreas and liver. To determine whether cftr is required for the development of these organs we generated cftr mutant zebrafish using TAL Effector Nucleases and utilized an antisense morpholino against Cftr. In addition to zebrafish-specific defects in fluid secretion early in development, analysis of mutants revealed that cftr is required for the morphogenesis of the zebrafish liver and pancreas. In mutant zebrafish, the size of the liver and exocrine pancreas are reduced. In addition, the \u03b2cells of the pancreatic islet are reduced similar to the reduction observed in human patients. Importantly, these phenotypes are observed before the liver and pancreas begin to function, indicating that these morphogenesis defects precede tissue destruction due to blockage of the organ ducts. Together, these studies reveal that cftr is a critical component of zebrafish organogenesis and indicate that the symptoms observed in human patients may arise during development. Transgenic cystic fibrosis (CF) murine models have greatly facilitated studies of CF pathogenesis and treatment. We recently described and characterized primary cell culture of murine nasal septal epithelium (MNSE) grown at an air-liquid interface that demonstrates excellent differentiation and robust, physiologic ciliary beat frequency stimulated by ATP and other agonists. Small rodents, however, do not reproduce key aspects of human airway physiology. For example, molecules developed with the intent of restoring CFTR function may exhibit species specificity -a fact underscored by lack of CFTR activation in MNSE by the potentiator VX-770. As experimental epithelia, rabbit tissue provides an excellent model for studies of human sinus disease. Rabbit sinonasal epithelium consists of 80 to 90% ciliated cells -similar to the human sinus and nasal cavities -and in vivo methods for investigating rabbit sinusitis are well established and suited for studies of therapeutic intervention. The objectives of the current experiments were to develop primary rabbit nasal septal epithelial (RNSE) cultures and evaluate their usefulness as a model of transepithelial transport and CFTR function in particular. RNSE was cultured at an air-liquid interface on filter supports to confluence and full differentiation. One rabbit septum yielded an average of 180 cultures (20-fold higher than a murine septum). Optimization of culture conditions was conducted to achieve approximately 80-90% ciliated cells as judged by scanning electron microscopy. Differentiation occurred within 14 days and all inserts attained resistance > 500 \u2126/cm 2 . Monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers to investigate pharmacologic manipulation of ion transport. RNSE exhibited a change in forskolin-stimulated current (\u2206Isc in \u00b5A/cm 2 ) compared to MNSE (6.3 +/-0.2 vs. 16.8 +/-2.1, respectively; p<0.0001). However, VX-770 stimulated CFTR-mediated Clsecretion in RNSE (1.4+/-0.1) whereas no measurable response was detected in MNSE. All cultures demonstrated inhibition of forskolin and VX-770 stimulated current by the CFTR inhibitor INH-172 (5 \u00b5M). In summary, standardized, well characterized RNSE cultures represent a useful model for studying CFTR activity, and provide advantages over murine nasal epithelial tissues. Culture yield from the rabbit septum is 20fold greater than the murine septum. Although forskolin-dependent Clsecretion was modest in comparison to MNSE, activation with VX-770 indicates important molecular similarities between rabbit and human CFTR, including usefulness of rabbit epithelial cultures for testing CFTR potentiation in the future. The CFTR-\u2206F508 mutation has a high carrier frequency, and female carriers have decreased blood pressures. CF patient bronchial smooth muscle cells have decreased calcium flux, but CFTR-null mouse aortic smooth muscle cells have a paradoxical increase in vasoconstriction. We speculated that intracellular retention of the dysfunctional CFTR protein produced by the \u2206F508 mutation interferes with calcium mobilization and decreases myogenic tone.",

We speculate sarcoplasmic reticulum retention of CFTR-\u2206F508 interferes with calcium channel activation, decreases vascular resistance and contributes to the lower arterial pressures seen in those carrying the \u2206F508 mutation. In newborn CF pigs we have observed tracheal cartilage ring defects, abnormal appearing airway smooth muscle bundles, and reduced tracheal and mainstem bronchi caliber. Additional studies using micro-CT based imaging of the newborn pig tracheal lobe, the porcine equivalent of the human right upper lobe, have found that the percentage of CF airway size reduction was greatest for the large airways and tapered as they became smaller and more peripheral. In this study, we asked if the CF pig tracheal lobe volume is normal at birth and if distal airspace development is dependent upon CFTR. Tracheal lobes from non-CF and CF newborn pigs were instillation fixed at a pressure of 20 cmH 2 O and CT scanned. The lobes were manually segmented from the scans to acquire an estimate of lobar volume. The average tracheal lobe volume in non-CF was 8.45 \u00b1 0.48 cm 3 and in CF 6.95 \u00b1 0.45 cm 3 (p < 0.05), a reduction of approximately twenty percent. A similar trend was observed when we measured total lung volume with CT in spontaneously breathing newborn pigs (81.2 \u00b1 5.3 cm3 vs. 63.8 \u00b1 7.1 cm 3 for non-CF and CF, respectively). Following CT scanning, the tracheal lobes were processed for morphological assessment. Mean linear intercept, an estimate of the volume to surface ratio of acinar airspaces, was determined based upon tracheal lobe histology. No statistically significant differences were found between genotypic groups. The mean linear intercept length was 65 \u00b1 2.5 \u00b5m for non-CF and 60 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5m for CF. In summary, in the newborn CF pig lung we have observed a reduction in caliber of the large airways and in lung size. Additional morphometric studies of alveolar size, number, and surface area will be required to fully understand the extent of these congenital abnormalities and their importance in the pathogenesis of early CF lung disease.",

We have recently established conditions allowing long-term expansion of epithelial organoids from human intestine, recapitulating essential features of the in vivo tissue architecture. Here, we apply this technology to study primary intestinal organoids of patients that suffer from cystic fibrosis (CF). As expected, we found CFTR located at the apical membrane of cells in the organoids. Forskolin induces a rapid swelling of wild-type organoids, but not of organoids derived from CFTR-deficient mice or CF patients. This phenomenon is phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Function of the common, temperature-sensitive CFTR-F508del mutant is restored upon incubation at low temperature, as well as by the corrector compounds VRT-325, Corr-4a, VX-809 and the potentiator VX-770. In organoids derived from different CFTR F508del homozygous patients, we observed differential capacity of (combinations of) drugs to restore CFTR function suggesting patient-specific drug efficacy. We have also established methods to measure drug efficacy in CF organoids grown from rectal biopsies after their use in intestinal current measurements (ICM), and found correlation between ICM and our novel forskolin-induced swelling assay. This relatively simple and robust assay will facilitate diagnosis, functional studies, drug development as well as personalized medicine approaches in CF. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) causes significant progressive pulmonary disease; identification of predictors of response to long term therapy is important given that CF treatment is life-long, onerous, expensive and complex. The efficacy and safety of Bronchitol TM (inhaled dry powder mannitol) has been established in two large phase III trials (CF-310, CF-302). We sought to determine the independent contribution of baseline factors to treatment response from this population, and establish whether early FEV1 response might be useful in predicting longer term impact on lung function.",

Previously, our laboratories showed that using a structure-based approach, the novel aminoglycoside derivative NB54 exhibited reduced cellular toxicity while also demonstrating efficacy that equaled that observed with gentamicin in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we provide new evidence that a second generation of aminoglycoside derivatives, NB74, NB84, and NB124, further enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity, resulting in translational readthrough that exceeds gentamicin and other prior aminoglycoside derivatives.",

The current results support further research efforts to optimize synthetic aminoglycosides for translational readthrough, and could result in agents suitable for long-term treatment of the basic CF defect found in ~10% of CF patients and many other genetic diseases. Triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are synthetic molecules that are capable of binding to targeted sites in genomic DNA, enhancing the homologous recombination of short 50-60 base-pair \"donor DNA\" fragments. This results in specific genome modification. Unlike plasmid delivery or whole-gene insertion, this type of gene modification is both heritable and constitutes true site-specific gene editing.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects approximately 30,000 people in the US and 70,000 worldwide. This relatively small patient population poses challenges to researchers especially considering most studies do not allow participants to be enrolled in multiple clinical trials simultaneously and that specific inclusion/exclusion criteria make the eligible patient population smaller yet. Phase 2 proof of concept studies in CF can easily be underpowered simply due to feasibility issues. New and promising therapies or drugs may be prematurely abandoned in early phases as a result of a small, underpowered study. Given the orphan status of CF, maximizing the efficiency of Phase 2 studies is paramount.",

            "text": "Through a review of published clinical trial data and simulation we conclude that a 1 month study can be conducted most effectively in an \"off\" SOC period to avoid a possible treatment effect washout or \"ceiling\" effect from SOC. The efficiency of a 2-4 month study design differs by endpoint and timing of SOC. For example, timing of enrollment can affect power by up to 7% when conducting a time to event analysis of pulmonary exacerbations. Likewise, allocating more subjects to receive treatment over placebo can reduce overall sample size by 8% when a response to treatment is highly variable in a biologic marker. Wading through the complexity and interrelatedness of these and other design considerations, while preserving clinical relevance, can be confusing. We give design recommendations for several scenarios commonly seen in CF research. Rationale: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) are a key outcome in pivotal cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical trials. During a trial however, physicians prescribe treatment based on their own diagnoses rather than whether an a priori PE definition is met. Thus, it is common for antibiotics to be given during a clinical trial for events not considered a PE. The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of this non-PE antibiotic usage on the risk of a subsequent protocol-defined PE. The hypothesis is that among younger CF patients with more mild disease, treating early with antibiotics could reduce the risk of a subsequent PE, and ultimately produce an attenuated treatment effect for the PE endpoint in a randomized clinical trial.",

A single serum iron reading may be useful in assessing future need for antibiotics.

Our observation that Aspergillus colonization was associated with a higher risk of receiving antibiotics contributes to a mixed body of literature on this topic. The manner by which these factors impact antibiotic prescribing practices should be prospectively studied using validated symptom inventories and a specific definition for CF pulmonary exacerbation. Background: Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an anabolic hormone that reduces protein turnover and gluconeogenesis, enhances glucose utilization by muscle, and promotes weight gain.

A direct relationship between IGF-1 and FEV1% before and after treatment raises the possibility that IGF-1 could serve as a surrogate endpoint for pulmonary function in clinical trials. In the context of therapy for CFPE, IGF-1 is closely correlated with biomarkers of iron homeostasis, suggesting a possible role for IGF-1 in regulating iron bioavailability during inflammatory states. The novel observation of an indirect correlation between IGF1-and A1AT also warrants future investigation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is generally diagnosed early in childhood and is characterised by sustained neutrophil dominated inflammation from a very young age. Conversely, recruited neutrophils are ineffective in the clearance of bacteria and play a significant role in development of bronchiectasis. Identification of agents modulating neutrophil migration constitutes a relevant therapeutic goal for reducing inflammation and subsequent tissue destruction. Studies have shown that SLPI is anti-inflammatory in such disorders as atherosclerosis and lung emphysema.

            "text": "Jih, K.; Hwang, T. University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA VX-770 (Kalydeco) is the first CF drug that targets directly the root of CF pathogenesis, namely the malfunction of CFTR channels. Although proven effective in clinical trials, very little is known about its mechanism of action. VX-770 potentiates WT-CFTR as well as many disease-associated mutations by prolonging their open time. Since the traditional strict coupling model for CFTR gating demands that the formation and separation of the NBD dimer are obligatorily coupled to the opening and closing of the gate respectively, the only two ways to prolong the open time is to delay NBD dimer separation or to impede ATP hydrolysis. But none of these two possible mechanisms can offer a nice explanation for the effect of VX-770 on G551D-CFTR, a mutation that likely prevents NBD dimerization from happening due to its unique position in the signature sequence and for the same reason eliminates ATP hydrolysis. Recently, we identified a new pathway in CFTR gating that allows ATP to capture the post-hydrolytic channels before the gate closes and shuffle it back to \"re-enter\" the original pre-hydrolytic open state to initiate another hydrolysis cycle. Inspired by this finding, we proposed that VX-770 promotes such a \"re-entry\" pathway by stabilizing the post-hydrolytic open state. Such a \"re-entry\" pathway delays channel closure by recycling the about-to-close post-hydrolytic channel for another round of ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, the length of each opening burst is correlated to the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed. This hypothesis is supported by several unpublished findings. First, we found that ATP-independent activity of WT-CFTR is increased by >6 fold in the presence of VX-770, a consequence of stabilizing the post-hydrolytic open state. This finding also provides a nice explanation for how VX-770 works on G551D-CFTR as G551D-CFTR channels lose all ATP-dependent activity yet retain intact ATP-independent opening events. Second, since the \"re-entry\" pathway requires binding of ATP to the post-hydrolytic open state, it is predicted that the frequency of the \"re-entry\" events depends on [ATP]. Consistent with this idea, we found that the open time of WT-CFTR is significantly prolonged at high [ATP] (882 \u00b1 141 ms, n = 25 in 10 mM versus 438 \u00b1 34 ms, n = 17 in 100 \u00b5M) in the presence of VX-770. The most compelling evidence came from studying a mutant CFTR, R352C, that allows us to \"see\" ATP hydrolysis taking place within each opening burst. In the presence of VX-770, we found more opening events containing hydrolysis of more than 1 ATP molecule. VX-770 is the progenitor of medication targeting CFTR, but it benefits only a small portion of the CF population. Thus, understanding its mechanism and site of action is pivotal for future development of new drugs that could benefit more CF patients. Our ongoing efforts to improve pulmonary gene transfer for the treatment of lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to the development of a lentiviral vector (SIV) pseudotyped with the Sendai virus envelope proteins F and HN (Kobayashi, J Virol, Mitomo. Mol Therapy 2010). Moving novel therapies to the clinic requires that relevant evidence for both safety and efficacy is gathered in appropriate models. Here, we begin to place this vector onto a translational pathway to the clinic and provide a body of supportive evidence for F/HN-pseudotyped SIV as a potential gene transfer agent for CF. These include: (1) a single dose produces lung expression for the lifetime of the mouse (approximately 2 years), (2) only brief contact time (seconds) is needed to achieve transduction, (3) repeated daily administration leads to a dose-related increase in gene expression, (4) repeated monthly administration to mouse lower airways is feasible without loss of gene expression, (5) no evidence of chronic toxicity during a 2 year study period, (6) F/HN-SIV transduction generates persistent gene expression in human differentiated airway cultures, and human lung slices, and transduces freshly obtained primary human airway epithelial cells. The data support F/HN-SIV as a promising vector for pulmonary gene therapy for a number of diseases including CF and we are now undertaking the necessary refinements to progress this vector into clinical trials.",

Treatment time is shorter for TIM than for TBM and is not impacted by reduced FEV 1 In cystic fibrosis (CF), the lower output of chloride results in greater sodium reabsorption to maintain the chloride/sodium balance within the cell. The malfunctioning CFTR channel results in deficiency in the absorption of chloride and also in poor absorption of sodium, since the ducts of the normal CFTR sweat gland stimulates the sodium channel.

It consists of generic and CF-specific scales that measure respiratory symptoms, health perceptions and daily functioning in several domains (i.e., physical, social, treatment burden) over the past 2 weeks. It has developmentally appropriate versions for children, ages 6 to 11 (interviewer administered), and self-report versions for ages 12 -13, and 14 through adulthood. In STRIVE, results from the child and adolescent/adult versions were pooled. In ENVISION, both the child interview and parent/caregiver versions were used. Each domain is scored on a 100point scale, with higher scores indicating better HRQOL. For the CFQ-R Respiratory Symptoms Scale, a difference of at least 4 points is considered the minimal important difference (MID). MIDs for other domains are being established.

Thus, pharmaceutical enhancement of \u2206F508-CFTR targeting to neutrophil phagosomes may alleviate or rescue the phagocytic defect. To test the hypothesis, we established three promyelocytic cell lines which expressed EGFP alone (PLB-985-EGFP), EGFP-wt-CFTR (PLB-985-EFGP-wt-CFTR) or EFGP-\u2206F508-CFTR (PLB-985-EFGP-\u2206F508-CFTR), respectively. These cells were differentiated into neutrophil-like cells after DMSO induction for 5 days. Phagosomal isolation and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that both wild-type CFTR and \u2206F508-CFTR were capable of trafficking to the phagosomes, but the wildtype CFTR targeted the organelle more efficiently and ~4 fold higher than the mutant one. This finding indicates that there exists a molecular mechanism for \u2206F508-CFTR to be recruited to phagosomes, albeit less efficiently. Corrector drug VX809 was applied to the DMSO-differentiating cells at various doses (0, 0.3, 3 \u00b5M). The expression of EGFP-wt-CFTR and EFGP-\u2206F508-CFTR in the isolated phagosomes was compared. The data showed that VX809 significantly affected EFGP-\u2206F508-CFTR phagosomal targeting in a dose-dependent manner. The high-dose VX809 (3 \u00b5M) increased the mutant CFTR targeting by ~1.5-2 fold. In contrast, the compound had little effect on the wild-type CFTR targeting. This preliminary study suggests the feasibility of pharmaceutical modulation of \u2206F508-CFTR in CF neutrophils to rescue their microbicidal defect. Moreover, the established system will be useful for compound screening to search for effective CFTR correctors in neutrophils.

Background: Previous studies have suggested a female disadvantage with respect to survival in cystic fibrosis (CF).

The explanation for this gender disparity is largely unknown and supports the need for further investigation into the mechanism, including evaluation of sex hormone mediated effects. To evaluate systemic, CFTR-directed therapeutics, we developed an optical bioassay that monitors CFTR-dependent and -independent sweat secretion in parallel for ~50 individual, identified glands in a subject; each gland is assessed before and after treatment. In this assay, CFTR-dependent secretion is stimulated with an intradermal injection of a \"beta-cocktail\" consisting of isoproterenol and aminophylline (to activate CFTR) and atropine (to block cholinergically-stimulated sweating). Sweat gland size and cholinergically-stimulated secretion rates vary markedly. Therefore, CFTR-dependent, beta-sweat rates are expressed by their ratio to CFTRindependent, cholinergically-stimulated sweat rates for each identified gland. We initially treated the cholinergic and adrenergically stimulated sweat sessions as independent. However, Sato, (AJP, 1983, 245, C189) determined that cholinergic stimulation strongly potentiates beta-adrenergically stimulated production of cAMP, but did not determine if this influenced secretory rates. We found that prior stimulation with 1 \u00b5M methacholine (15 min, just prior to beta test) exerted a profound potentiating effect on the subsequent secretory response to cocktail. The plot shows final volumes of 34 identified glands that were followed across 2 cocktail-only conditions (C1, C2) and 3 MCh-cocktail conditions (MC1-3), plus mean volume for all glands in each condition. The average across condition C1, C2 = 2.8 +/-1.6 and MC1-3 =13.7 +/-6.1 nL/gland/20 min. The average potentiation factor (MC/C) was 4.89. With identified glands as the units of analysis a paired t test gave P= 1 x 10 -13 and analysis using lmer from R (R_Development_Core_Team. 2011, R Foundation for Statistical Computing: Vienna, Austria) on log transformed data gave t = 14.57. MCh Potentiation Factors (PFs) were estimated for 4 other subjects: 3 had a mean PF of 2.2 and one of 27.6. No response in MC condition was observed in 11/12 pancreatic insufficient CF subjects, or if the beta agonists were omitted from the cocktail (atropine only). Potentiation, because it is CFTR-dependent, increases assay sensitivity for partially functional CFTR.",

Because systemic CFTR-directed therapeutics act directly on CFTR within sweat gland cells, individual glands become the units of analysis for within-gland, paired statistical treatments that provide sufficient statistical power to quantify treatment effects for that individual. This could help identify individuals who are likely to benefit from CFTR potentiators. Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics-WINE08A0. To identify exacerbations, clinicians rely on changes in clinical symptoms or impaired lung function. The latter is often a later marker of disease; therefore, specific biomarkers of the inflammatory and immune response are needed to improve the care of CF patients. We previously demonstrated that costimulatory dyads, including CD40-CD40L, CD 80/86-CD28/CTLA4, and OX40L-OX40 are capable of regulating inflammation in multiple inflammatory disorders and expression levels of cell bound and soluble isoforms serve as biomarkers for disease activity in sepsis, SLE, and MI.

The CF Pulmonary Guidelines (2010) advocate bronchial artery embolization in CF patients with massive hemoptysis who are clinically unstable. However, no consensus is reported on the management of massive and submassive hemoptysis in clinically stable patients. We hypothesize that the use of betablockade will decrease mean arterial pressure resulting in lower bronchial artery blood flow and subsequently, decrease the frequency and severity of hemoptysis, rate of hospitalizations, and usage of intravenous antibiotic.",

Betablocker therapy appears to maintain an effective safety profile in CF. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a massive migration of neutrophils into the airways, release of reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes, and ultimately deterioration in pulmonary function. Studies have shown that neutrophil count and activity are strong correlates of disease severity in CF. The chemokine receptor CXCR2 is expressed on the surface of neutrophils and bronchial epithelial cells and mediates neutrophil recruitment through binding of interleukin-8 (CXCL-8). We hypothesize that CXCR2 antagonists can reduce neutrophil migration and may have therapeutic use in patients with CF.",

Sixteen antagonists showed potent antagonism of CXCR2 with IC 50 values less than 20 \u00b5M. Cytotoxicity of these compounds was determined over a 4 log range of concentrations using MTT assays in the CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 human bronchial epithelial cell lines (with CF and non-CF phenotypes respectively). Compounds that exhibited less than 10% cytotoxicity at the highest concentration were selected for further experiments in a human neutrophil chemotaxis assay to investigate anti-inflammatory dose-response. In this assay, neutrophils were isolated from blood collected from healthy human volunteers, and were then incubated with CXCR2 antagonists over 4 logs of concentration. The neutrophils were added to the top plate of a membrane-based plate insert system, and CXCL-8 was added to the bottom plate.

The most frequent mutation in cystic fibrosis, \u2206F508, causes the arrest of the CFTR protein in the ER and its degradation. Drug-like molecules called correctors are able to improve \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking. However, correctors are characterized by a relatively low efficacy, particularly in primary airway epithelial cells. Indeed, the activity of \u2206F508-CFTR correctors is largely influenced by cell background. In addition, the additivity/synergy observed between correctors, indicates that different treatments work by different mechanisms, and that cross-talk among different mechanisms may occur. These mechanisms may be universal or cell type specific. Therefore, novel strategies are required to develop rescue maneuvers that are more effective in the epithelial cells of CF patients.",

Based on the degree of interactions observed in these studies, ivacaftor dose reduction is recommended when co-administering with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and when administering to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Strong CYP inducers would be expected to substantially lower ivacaftor exposure and may affect efficacy. Caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended during co-administering of ivacaftor with some CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. Health practitioners should consult the ivacaftor package insert prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions and dosing recommendations. Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is the leading pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis, resulting in a strong inflammatory response and is a major contributing factor to the overall lung damage. It has been shown previously that P38 inhibitors can suppress the inflammatory response caused by PA, which could be an exaggerated response in CF. Specific kinase inhibitors are currently also being developed for a range of indications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of kinase signaling in, and the effectiveness of kinase inhibitors to suppress, PA-induced cytokine release in bronchial epithelial cells.",

Analysis of individual fatty acid levels or fatty acid ratios cannot reliably differentiate between CF and control samples because there are unresolved inconsistencies in their direction of change, even amongst arachidonic, linoleic, and docosahexanoic acids.(1) However, blood fatty acid profiles could be used as an outcome measure for CF therapies if there were a more comprehensive mode of analysis.

Indeed, resveratrol has been reported to increase CFTR expression and to increase cAMP stimulated chloride secretion across epithelial cells. However such effects have been reported using concentrations of resveratrol far in excess (>500 \u00b5M) of those achievable in human plasma (5-10 \u00b5M). We sought to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on CFTR expression and chloride secretion at clinically relevant concentrations. Resveratrol is a PDE inhibitor, increasing cAMP concentrations. Alone, resveratrol caused a dose-dependent increase in chloride secretion from T84 cells. In addition, resveratrol augmented the effects of submaximal levels of forskolin, consistent with actions mediated by the cAMP pathway. High concentrations of resveratrol were also able to cause a modest increase in CFTR levels when CFTR expressing 293 cells were incubated with compound overnight. Primary airway cells from a patient homozygous for the DF508 mutation were incubated overnight with 10 \u00b5M resveratrol. No increase in forskolin mediated currents was observed from resveratrol treated cells; though cells exposed to known CFTR correctors were responsive. We conclude that while high levels of resveratrol are effective in vitro, the low achievable levels of resveratrol in plasma suggest that resveratrol will have little beneficial effect in treating patients with cystic fibrosis.

The underlying gene defect responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) was identified in 1989 and there has been considerable interest in developing gene therapy based therapeutics for the disease ever since. Numerous studies and trials involving viral and liposomal vectors for plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery have occurred, however due to safety concerns and lack of efficacy a successful therapy has yet to be developed. The use of biodegradable polymers provides a potentially safe and effective alternative to viral and liposomal vectors for the delivery of pDNA to cells. In prior work, polymers have been found to be limited in different ways: nanoparticles of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are non-toxic but low in efficiency whereas nanocomplexes of poly(beta-amino) esters (PBAE) are higher in efficiency but toxic. Here, we optimize the formulation of nanoparticles (NP) by blending PLGA with PBAE for use as gene delivery vehicles. Particles of different weight/weight (wt/wt) ratios of the two polymers were characterized for size, morphology, plasmid DNA (pDNA) loading and surface charge. NPs containing PBAE were more effective at cellular internalization and transfection of cells CF cells (CFBE41o-, F508del-CFTR) than NPs lacking the PBAE polymer. However, along with these delivery benefits, PBAE formulations still exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Surface coating of these blended particles with the cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) mTAT, bPrPp and MPG via a PEGylated phospholipid linker (DSPE-PEG2000) resulted in NPs that reduced surface charge and cellular toxicity to levels comparable with NPs formulated with only PLGA. Additionally, these coated nanoparticles showed an improvement in pDNA loading, intracellular uptake and transfection efficiency, when compared to NPs lacking the surface coating. Although all particles with a CPP coating outperformed unmodified NPs, respectively, bPrPp and MPG coating resulted in 3 and 4.5X more pDNA loading than unmodified particles and approximately an order of magnitude improvement on transfection efficiency in CFBE41ocells.",

Progressive lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial infections in the lungs of CF patients are typified by bacterial overproduction of alginate or extracellular polysaccharide. Current therapies include physiotherapy, antibiotic and mucolytic treatments. OligoG is a low molecular weight (ca. 2600 MW) oligosaccharide nanomedicine based on a defined alginate oligomer with 90-95% of the monomer residues as G-blocks. OligoG alginates possess many advantages, being biodegradable, effectively inert, non-toxic and safe for in vivo use (Clinical Phase 1 studies; EudraCT number: 2009-009330-33, www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00970346). The ability of OligoG to potentiate the activity of antimicrobial/antibiotic therapy and disrupt in vitro biofilms has previously been demonstrated in conventional microbiological assays, scanning electron-and confocal laser scanning-microscopy. In preliminary rheological studies, we demonstrated that OligoG is able to reduce CF sputum viscosity in vitro; potentially aiding the disruption of CF sputum and facilitating its clearance from the diseased lung.",

The ability of OligoG to reduce CF sputum viscoelasticity, potentiate the activity of Pulmozyme\u00ae, together with its previously described ability to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against multi-drug resistant bacteria, highlights its potential utility in the treatment of CF. In this respect, OligoG is now undergoing Phase IIa human trials (EudraCT number: 2010-023090-19, www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01465529). In cystic fibrosis, the mutant CFTR gene results in decreased Clsecretion and hyperabsorption of Na + in the airway leading to dehydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer. The reduction of ASL height impairs mucocillary clearance and favours lung infection and inflammation which lead into a progressive lung destruction. The eicosanoid lipoxin A4 (LXA4) described as a signal for the resolution of inflammation is decreased in the lungs of patients with CF (Karp et al, 2004). We previously reported that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) a pro-resolution anti-inflammatory lipid mediator stimulates Clsecretion (Urbach et al, 2003), ZO-1 expression and increases transepithelial electrical resistance in human airway epithelial cells (Urbach et al, 2008). Using confocal microscopy, luciferin/luciferase and gentamicin invasion assay we investigated the effect of LXA4 (1nM) on ASL height, on epithelial repair and on invasion of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells by P. aeruginosa. Airway epithelial cells were cultured from bronchial brushing obtained through the SHIELD CF study (Study of Host Immunity and Early Lung Disease in CF). We found that LXA4 increased the ASL height in a dose and time dependent manner in both the HBE and CFBE cells. The effect of LXA4 on the ASL height was mediated by the Boc-2 sensitive FPR2 receptor, apical ATP release, P2Y11 purino-receptor activation and subsequent stimulation of Clsecretion. LXA4 also significantly stimulated epithelial repair in CF and non-CF airway epithelial cells. Cell proliferation and repair induced by LXA4 were found to be mediated by KATP channel activation. Finally, LXA4 delayed the invasion of HBE and CFBE cells by P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, we reported a novel role for LXA4 in increasing ASL height, stimulating epithelial repair and delaying the invasion of P. aeruginosa, which could lead to a new therapeutic route for CF patients.",

Introduction: Evaluating therapies that target the basic defect in infants and young children with CF will require repeated assessments in order to monitor lung disease progression. MRI is a safe, non-invasive procedure capable of providing quantitative assessments of pulmonary function without radiation. An oxygen-enhanced (OE)-MRI technique has been shown to reliably assess regional lung dysfunction in CF patients with established lung disease.

            "text": "Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that OE-MRI may be able to sensitively detect early-stage CF lung disease. The next step is to test younger patients. Ongoing studies in CF patients will provide additional information to evaluate OE-MRI as a tool to safely monitor early-stage lung disease progression and response to therapy in infants and young children. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bacterial infections in the lungs of CF patients are typified by bacterial overproduction of extracellular polysaccharide such as alginate. We have previously shown that OligoG, derived and processed from alginate, an oligomer of the sodium salt of (1-4) linked \u03b1-L-guluronic acid (G), composed of 90-95% G (MW 2600 g mol -1 ) potentiates the activity of conventional antibiotics (up to 500-fold) against a range of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, and that OligoG has an ability to modify the rheology and structure of biofilms of P. aeruginosa . Whilst these effects have been extensively characterized, the mechanism and interaction with the bacterial surface is not well understood. We studied the interaction of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and OligoG on cell surface structure (using atomic force microscopy; AFM), surface charge and cellular assembly (using sizing and zeta-potential analysis) and cell motility. In addition, the reversibility of the interaction was studied to determine the stability of OligoG/PAO1 binding on exposure to hydrodynamic shear. AFM analysis was performed on P. aeruginosa (PAO1) biofilms after washing and treatment with OligoG (0.5-10%, 20 mins) using a Dimension 3100 AFM (Bruker). Sizing and zetapotential analyses were performed in electrolyte solutions of 0.1-0.001 M NaCl at pH 5, 7 and 9. Hydrodynamic shear experiments repeated the analyses following a rigorous 3 min washing regime (x2; 5,500 g). The ability of OligoG (at concentrations <10%) to affect bacterial motility was also studied by incorporating OligoG either into Isosensitest agar plates or into motility test agar (MTA) \"stab\" inoculations containing a redox indicator and observing bacterial spread of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) and Proteus mirabilis (NSM6) across/through the agar. AFM studies demonstrated the uniform distribution of OligoG on the bacterial surface following treatment. OligoG treatment increased the overall negative bacterial surface charge (at all observed pH values; p>0.05). These changes were associated with 2-3 fold changes in cell-size as a result of \"cell-clumping\" and was not reversible even after exposure to hydrodynamic shear. OligoG inhibited bacterial motility in a clear, dose-dependent manner. OligoG concentrations >6% almost completely inhibited motility in P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli. This study demonstrated that not only was irreversible binding of the OligoG to the bacterial cell surface of PAO1 in biofilms observed, but this binding was shown to modify the surface structure, surface charge as well as biofilm assembly and bacterial cell motility. These physical, surface-charge and structural effects may, in part, explain the observed action of OligoG on bacterial assembly, biofilm formation and antibiotic potentiation that has been previously described. Objectives: Ivacaftor has been shown to improve FEV 1 in subjects \u22656 years of age who have the G551D mutation. Drugs targeting the basic defect in CFTR may benefit patients with early stage disease, but demonstrating this can be difficult. FEV 1 may be of limited value whereas a more sensitive test such as lung clearance index (LCI) may be more useful.",

We then used mass spectrometry to analyze differences in metabolites and proteins to determine which pathways were significantly impacted by CFTR inhibition.

The data on a metabolic shift toward glycolysis in CF primary cells, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were also confirmed by biochemical measures that indicated an upregulation in phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate. We conclude that the upregulation of glycolysis is related to CFTR dysfunction as evidenced by the impact of CFTR inhibition in nonCF primary cells, and independent studies conducted in 2 different primary cell types in 2 different labs.

The activation of Nrf2 decreases inflammatory signaling in CF epithelia to nonCF levels and improves redox balance. To examine the mechanism by which Nrf2 activation in CF cells is protective, we used LCMS to identify the change in GSH and protein oxidation following treatment with the triterpenoids CDDO and CDDO-Me.

We found that whole cell GSH levels ranged between 2.4-3.2 mM in DMSO treated CF and nonCF cells. Rebound was diminished in DMSO treated CF cells versus DMSO treated nonCF cells, with a drop of ~63% in GSH levels at 5 min which returned to 86% of levels in CF cells untreated with H 2 O 2 by 90 min. Conversely, nonCF cells exhibited an increase in GSH of 87% following a 5 min exposure to H 2 O 2 , which remained elevated for 90 min.

It is well accepted that CFTR functions as an epithelial ion transporter of chloride and bicarbonate on the surface of human airways, and emerging evidence suggests these defects can also alter the physical and functional properties of airway mucus. Analysis of airway mucus from newborn CFTR (-/-) pigs in situ using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching shows that it is highly viscous compared to CFTR (+/+) littermate controls (t\u00bd = 12.9 \u00b1 1.0 sec CFTR (-/-) vs. 9.2 \u00b1 0.9 sec CFTR (+/+), P<0.05, N=20), demonstrating that viscosity may be an important abnormality of the CF defect. Our previous studies have shown that one micron resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (\u00b5OCT) can quantitatively assess ASL and PCL depths, ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and mucociliary transport rates (MCT), all without the use of contrast dyes, exogenous microparticles, or other manipulations. In the present report, we have further advanced the methodology and developed a technique for native particle tracking microrheology to measure mean squared displacement (MSD) caused by Brownian motion to derive dynamic viscosity and validated the method by fluorescence microparticle tracking in preparation for in situ and in vivo measurements of mucus viscosity using \u00b5OCT.",

Rhinovirus accounted for 72% of identified viruses, metapneumovirus 13.2%, adenovirus 4.1%, influenza A 3.6%, influenza B 2.5%, parainfluenza 2.5% and RSV 2%. In cystic fibrosis (CF), mutations in CFTR reduce or eliminate chloride secretion in the lung and thereby reduce the volume of airway surface liquid (ASL), which in turn suppresses mucociliary clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogens trapped in the mucus. Accordingly, individuals with CF are susceptible to chronic infections, primarily by the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa, which is particularly difficult to eradicate due to the high basal levels of antibiotic resistance and the ability of P. aeruginosa to form antimicrobial resistant biofilms. Over time the CF lung evolves into a highly inflamed and purulent environment that is the proximate cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Little is known about the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa establishes biofilms in the host, but it has been reported that CF patients show a reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa acquired during respiratory viral infections and 85% of new pseudomonal colonization in CF patients followed a respiratory viral infection within 3 weeks. We hypothesized that virus co-infection promotes biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa. Using a live-cell imaging approach to grow P. aeruginosa biofilms on polarized human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated a dramatic increase in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on airway cells in the presence of a viral co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Similar increases in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth were demonstrated when airway cells were co-infected with the respiratory viruses human rhinovirus-14 and adenovirus-5. RSV co-infection with CF non-mucoid and mucoid P. aeruginosa clinical isolates produced increased biofilm growth on polarized airway epithelial cells. Notably, RSV dramatically augmented P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on polarized CF primary airway epithelial cells. Virus co-infection did not induce cytotoxicity or enhance the attachment of P. aeruginosa to the airway epithelium, but did promote a more rapid maturation of the biofilm, as demonstrated by earlier expression of the biofilm marker gene tolA and earlier loss of the planktonic marker gene, fliC. Finally, in vivo co-infection studies demonstrated a profoundly increased bacterial burden in mice co-infected with influenza A virus, as compared to P. aeruginosa alone, at 24 hours post-inoculation of P. aeruginosa. The current study provides evidence that respiratory viral infections can enhance the development of P. aeruginosa biofilms and suggests a potential role for respiratory viral infections in the transition of P. aeruginosa to chronic colonization in CF patients. While it has been well documented that viral infections are often accompanied by a secondary bacterial infection, this is the first study linking viral co-infection to the establishment of chronic bacterial colonization and biofilm formation, with important implications in the progression of CF lung disease. This work was supported by NIH grants R00HL098342-01 and P30DK072506. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a common trigger that promotes acute pulmonary exacerbation in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). We recently demonstrated that CF airway epithelial cells exhibit greater sensitivity to RSV infection, including enhanced monolayer disruption and markedly elevated viral replication. Previous studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinase -9 (MMP-9) activity is increased in CF airway secretions, due in part to elastase-driven conversion of MMP-9 zymogen to active enzyme, and degradation of the MMP-9 inhibitor, TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase)-1 by elastase. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that RSV is a specific stimulus for MMP-9 release from airway epithelial cells, and that children with RSV-induced respiratory failure have elevated MMP-9 activity relative to normal and disease controls.",

In patient samples following 48hour intubation, active MMP-9 was approximately 8-fold higher in children with RSV bronchiolitis (n=28), compared to ALI subjects without RSV (n=23). Low levels of MMP-9 were observed in normal controls (n=10), whereas the highest levels of MMP-9 were noted in subjects with RSV bronchiolitis who later developed ALI, suggesting the importance of an interaction between airway epithelial damage, matrix remodeling and MMP-9 dysregulation following RSV infection.

The RP73 genome encodes 5975 ORFs but lacks an entire cluster of 32 genes from PA1694 to PA1725 encoding the type III secretion system. The genome sequence of RP73 indicated the deletion of genes involved in twitching motility, pilA, pilV, pilW, pilY2 and fimT, a deletion in pilC and a stop codon after 138 amino acid in pilO. Phenotypic analysis of RP73 showed no twitching motility. The 46 genes involved in swarming motility are present; although RP73 showed motility defects. We identified genetic variations in both the lpxO2 and oprH genes involved in LPS biosynthesis.

            "text": "Supported by NHLBI R01HL098084. The transition of bacterial infections from acute to chronic infections often involves the development of bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are sessile communities of bacteria that are characterized by an inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents. The combination of an upregulation of antibiotic resistance genes and production of a polymeric matrix surrounding the biofilm serves to protect the biofilm community of bacteria from the hostile environment in the host. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a biofilm-producing, opportunistic pathogen critical to the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Little is known about the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa establishes biofilms in the host, but it has been reported that CF patients show a reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa acquired during respiratory viral infections and 85% of new pseudomonal colonization in CF patients followed a respiratory viral infection within 3 weeks. Furthermore, seasonal trends in influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections significantly correlate with the acquisition of the first P. aeruginosa culture, as well as chronic infection with P. aeruginosa, in CF patients. We hypothesized that virus co-infection stimulates biofilm growth and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. Using live-cell imaging, as well as plate-based approaches to grow P. aeruginosa biofilms on human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated a dramatic increase in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on polarized human airway cells in the presence of respiratory virus co-infection. The common CF viral pathogens, RSV, human rhinovirus-14 (hRV) and adenovirus (AdV) dramatically increased P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on airway cells, 4.6+/-0.65, 3.4+/-1.2 and 4.4+/-1.1 fold over control, respectively. To explore the mechanism and potential clinical consequences of this enhanced bacterial biofilm growth in the presence of respiratory virus co-infection, we examined the antibiotic resistance of the virus-stimulated bacterial biofilms. Notably, in the presence of RSV, hRV or AdV co-infection, P. aeruginosa more rapidly acquired antibiotic resistance to tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, two frontline antibiotics used to treat P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients. The enhanced antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa in the presence of virus co-infection corresponded to increased expression of the antibiotic resistance genes mexA, mexX and ampC, thus providing a potential mechanism for the enhanced antibiotic resistance to the aminoglycoside and quinolone classes of antibiotics. In summary, this study reports that respiratory virus co-infection promotes the biofilm growth and antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa and provides important implications in the acquisition of chronic P. aeruginosa infection in CF patients, a critical window in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. This work was supported by NIH grants R00HL098342-01 and P30DK072506. Background: In CF airways, infections are typically dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Permanent eradication of P. aeruginosa in CF airways is impossible because, as current evidence suggests, P. aeruginosa forms antibiotic-resistant biofilms in the CF lung. Iron has been shown to promote P. aeruginosa biofilm formation on airway cells and, for reasons that are still largely unknown, the iron concentration in the airway surface liquid (ASL) of CF lung is 400-times higher than in a non-CF lung. Chelating iron may be a promising new therapy to eliminate P. aeruginosa biofilm formation on CF airway epithelial cells. Here, we investigate whether P. aeruginosa biofilms would become more susceptible to the action of inhaled tobramycin in the presence of ALX-009, a newly designated orphan drug containing lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein with bactericidal activity and hypothiocyanite (OSCN -).",

There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics (age at registry entry, gender, BMI z-score) for those receiving flucloxacillin or no prophylaxis and for those included or excluded. In a model including gender, age at first entry to the registry and DNase use, flucloxacillin use was not associated with a reduction in the rate of first acquisition of S. aureus (hazard ratio (SE) 1.16 (0.32) 95% CI 0.67, 1.99, p=0.62). There was also no difference in the number of positive cultures of S. aureus over time (p=0.29). However, flucloxacillin use was associated with a significant increased hazard of first isolation of P. aeruginosa (HR 2.39 (0.51) 95% CI 1.57, 3.64, p<0.001) and more positive cultures of P. aeruginosa over time (p<0.001).",

Introduction: Chronic P. aeruginosa infection is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis and is mediated, in part, by the biofilm mode of growth. Biofilms confer protection from the host immune system and antibiotic resistance. Mannitol has been shown to affect the behaviour of other Gram negative bacteria and so we were interested in the effect upon P. aeruginosa.",

In patients with positive serology, a Papositive OP culture was significantly more likely in the ensuing 12 months than in those with negative Pa serology. Pa serology may therefore help to define CF patients at higher risk of developing Pa infection. Support: CFF EPIC09K0 (Rosenfeld). Patients with CF suffer from chronic lower respiratory tract infections caused by microbes that are often recalcitrant to clinically prescribed therapies. Previous reports suggest that during exacerbation, the sputum densities of dominant CF pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) remain relatively unchanged over time, resulting from genetic adaptation and microevolution of the initial infecting strains. The potential clinical impacts of this phenomenon remain poorly studied in chronic infections. To examine correlations between intraclonal diversity within P. aeruginosa populations in the CF lung, adaptive resistance and the specificity of targeted treatments, we have characterized the morphologic, phenotypic and genotypic attributes of sequential bacterial isolates from a CF patient chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa. A total of 400 clones were recovered from 11 expectorated sputum samples produced by a single female patient attending the Adult CF Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto, ON) between Nov. 2010 and Nov. 2011. Colonies were classified into morphotypes by visual inspection on LB and Columbia + 5% Sheep's Blood agar and screened for phenotypic traits including biofilm formation, motility, antimicrobial susceptibility and pyocyanin overproduction, using standard protocols. Genomes from at least 28 of these clones were sequenced by standard paired-end Illumina sequencing and the reads assembled with the Burrows Wheeler Assembler, a reference-mapping tool. The genome of the PAO1 strain was used as the reference and single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified with SAMTOOLS. Variable regions were identified and characterized with CLC Genomics and in-house JAVA programs. Distinct colony morphologies were documented on a per-sample basis, with up to 3 confirmed mucoid P. aeruginosa variants present within a single sample. Sequential morphotype-specific isolates were found to differ in all tested phenotypes, particularly in both swimming and twitching motilities when incubated at either 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. Furthermore, preliminary inspection of the genomic content of the first sequenced isolates revealed dynamic changes in the genome of P. aeruginosa as well as common genetic signatures across all samples. We present an in-depth, longitudinal analysis of adaptive radiation within P. aeruginosa populations in the CF lung. Similar to recent studies, we suggest that current methods of susceptibility profiling may underestimate the true resistance potential of CF pathogen populations, leading to possible treatment failure. This work is supported by an Emerging Team Grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CF Canada, and the National Sanitarium Association. Background: SA SCVs emerge frequently during many chronic infections, including in CF airways. These slow-growing variants, which are frequently missed by clinical laboratories, can be selected in vitro by exposure to certain antibiotics and by growth with P. aeruginosa. Different SCV types are selected by these different conditions, resulting in different predicted antibiotic susceptibilities. Exactly how SA SCVs are selected during CF infections, their associations with clinical outcomes, and how best to treat them are poorly understood.",

MLST was the best method for predicting unique strains and has the potential to be a cost efficient, high throughput first-pass typing method.

Results: A total of 709 patients were followed over the 12 year study period; 101 patients underwent a lung transplantation (of which 29 died) and an additional 58 patients died (total 159 events). The Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 1 ) demonstrated that patients who ever had chronic S. maltophilia infection were more likely to die or undergo a lung transplantation than patients who were never infected with S. maltophilia (p<0.0001).

MRSA prevalence at our CF center has been well above the national average, ranging from 40 to 42.5% of our population over the past five years.

However, we have seen a decline in the rate of acquisition of MRSA in our pediatric population after instituting a strict infection control policy and cohorting infants to a separate clinic day. Median age of MRSA acquisition has also decreased, possibly due to an influx of younger patients diagnosed by newborn screening. MRSA colonization rates at our center have remained relatively stable in comparison to the national average, which has continued to rise. Given the association between persistent MRSA colonization and increased rate of decline in lung function, we must continue to work toward controlling the spread of MRSA in the CF population through careful attention to infection control. Recently, in situations where a bacterial pathogen is also highly antibiotic resistant, the efficacy of bacteriophage therapy has come under increasing scrutiny. In this regard, bacteriophage therapy may be especially applicable to infections caused by the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) since members of the Bcc are highly antibiotic resistant. Bcc infections can significantly reduce the life expectancy of CF patients and in severe cases can lead to \"cepacia syndrome,\" which is characterized by a rapid deterioration of pulmonary function. A therapy that utilizes bacteriophages (or phages) to specifically target Bcc species would complement current chemical antibiotic therapeutic regimens. Phages are bacterial viruses that exclusively attack and lyse particular species or strains of bacteria. Here we demonstrate effective phage therapy for different strains of the Bcc in an aerosol mouse model, including important improvements over previous descriptions of Bcc phage therapy. Using a Nose Only Inhalation Device, we show in an immune-compromised murine infection model that aerosol phage therapy is safe and effective. Using 5 different phages specifically active against two different B. cenocepacia strains, we observe three to five log decreases in bacterial numbers in the lungs, with treatment delays of between 24 and 48 hours post-infection. In addition, we observe in vitro that some Bcc bacteriophage can provide a dual role in combating the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Finally, we examine the possibility of phage loss from the lungs, which could result in a reduction of phage therapy effectiveness. Our data suggests that intranasal aerosol delivery of phages to the bacterial site of infection in lungs is more effective than intraperitoneal delivery of the phages. Our results suggest that Bcc phage therapy can effectively clear bacterial infections from lungs by a magnitude of up to 5 log units and with a treatment delay of up to 48 hours in this infection model. Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause for lower respiratory tract infections and a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality among infants and young children. For patients with CF, RSV infection, like other viral infections is implicated in causing respiratory symptoms. While no vaccination is available, prophylaxis with palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae, MedImmune), a monoclonal antibody has been approved. In infants with CF, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) qualifies the recommendation for palivizumab immunoprophylaxis because of the absence of clinical trials evidence.",

These findings suggest immediate type reactions as underlying cause. Facing the high prevalence and severity of HRPA, the insecurity of attending physicians and the consecutive limitations of therapeutic options, we see an urgent need for further identification of HRPAs immunology and the development of diagnostic algorithms for clinical use.

P. aeruginosa (PA), widespread in nature, can successfully colonize the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and subsequently develop \"a chronic phenotype\" caused by adaptive mutations in the genome. In young CF patients antibiotic therapy can effectively eradicate P. aeruginosa from the lungs, but in many patients recurrent colonization with the same initial clone is observed, and it was speculated that the bacteria could hide in one or more protected niches in the body. We have therefore investigated the early genetic adaptive changes in PA colonizing the paranasal sinuses and lungs of young CF patients to elucidate whether the sinuses constitute protected niches providing foci for adaptation.",

This genotypically distinct isolate may have initially been below detection limits or may represent a new colonization. In general, PA from CF and BE formed distinct PFGE groups, suggesting genotypic differences between isolates cultured from CF and BE patients. Grouping of isolates according to MLVA type yielded results which were concordant to PFGE; however, as MLVA is rapid, less subjective and as discriminatory for typing PA, it is a potentially more useful method than PFGE for large-scale surveillance and epidemiological studies of PA in the respiratory clinic. Future work will determine if any phenotypic differences (e.g. antibiotic sensitivities) are observed between groups and further isolates from both CF, BE and other respiratory conditions are currently under investigation. P. aeruginosa is one of only a few bacterial species capable of producing the virulence factor hydrogen cyanide (HCN). HCN is detectable in the sputum of CF patients at concentrations >200 \u00b5M and its presence is negatively correlated with lung function (FEV 1% CN-negative: 46.0 \u00b1 6.7%; CN-positive: 26.8 \u00b1 3.8%; p<0.01). Our work explores the possible mechanisms for this association, focussing on the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations of HCN on human respiratory epithelial cell function. Concentrations of HCN similar to those found in sputum were found to inhibit ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of healthy human nasal epithelium (n=6) after 60 min (150 \u00b5M: 47% fall, p=0.021; 75 \u00b5M: 32% fall, p=0.0450). Samples from CF patients (n=3) showed similar results (150 \u00b5M: 55% fall, p=0.02). The decrease was not due to loss of viability (ns, p=0.2036) and was reversible, in that CBF rapidly recovered to control levels when HCN was removed. The toxic P. aeruginosa exoproduct pyocyanin is also detectable in sputum at concentrations >75 \u00b5M. Pyocyanin has previously been shown to inhibit CBF in an ATP-dependent manner. We looked at the combined effect of pyocyanin and cyanide on CBF. Ciliated strips of human nasal epithelium were obtained from the inferior turbinate of healthy volunteers with a cytology brush and CBF in the presence or absence of cyanide, pyocyanin, or a combination of both, was measured at 37\u00b0C using light microscopy. CBF measurements were also carried out on airway liquid interface cultures (ALIs). ATP measurements were performed on 16-HBE cells. After 60 min, the addition of either cyanide (75 \u00b5M: 42% fall p=0.025) or pyocyanin (75 \u00b5M: 27% fall p=0.025) decreased the CBF of nasal brushings (n=3). The effect of treatment with cyanide and pyocyanin was significantly greater than that with pyocyanin alone (51% fall p=0.024). Preliminary CBF measurements on the ALIs (n=2) support this finding (KCN 75 \u00b5M: 21% fall, pyocyanin 75 \u00b5M: 5% fall, KCN 75 \u00b5M + pyocyanin 75 \u00b5M: 63% fall). ATP measurements confirmed that pyocyanin depletes cellular ATP levels (75 \u00b5M: 55% fall, p<0.0005; 150 \u00b5M: 60% fall p<0.0005). Interestingly, KCN did not cause a fall in ATP (ns at 75 \u00b5M and 150 \u00b5M). Combined treatment with cyanide and pyocyanin did not decrease ATP levels more than pyocyanin alone (ns, p=0.256). These results suggest that cyanide and pyocyanin inhibit ciliary beat through different mechanisms. In addition, the presence of cyanide in the lung appears to exacerbate the effect of pyocyanin alone, causing a marked decrease in CBF in vitro. If this was of a sufficient magnitude to impair mucociliary clearance in vivo, it could provide an explanation for the link with increased disease severity observed in CF patients with detectable levels of cyanide in the airway. Others include levofloxacin, ceftazidime and ticarcillin/clavulanate. Since 2008, our institution has experienced a decrease in susceptibility to TMP/SMZ from 100% to 94%. Susceptibilities to other antibiotics have also decreased and we had several CF patients with allergies to alternative agents thus making treatment challenging. We worked with our microbiology department to expand susceptibility testing for SM for other options (outpatient and inpatient treatment). We expanded the current panel of TMP/SMZ, levofloxacin. ticarcillin/clavulanate and ceftazidime to add minocycline, colistin and tigecycline. As part of this quality improvement initiative, we performed outcome studies assessing retrospective evaluation on the effectiveness of extended susceptibility testing and impact on treatment outcomes at our center.",

Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) are the most common pathogens in CF airway infections. PA infects up to 80% of adult patients, causing airway inflammation and tissue destruction, which leads to lung function decline and increased mortality. SA infects up to 30% of adult CF patients, but its role in lung disease and inflammation is still poorly understood. Sagel et al found that PA and SA co-infections have an additive effect on lung inflammation in young children (Sagel 2009).

The inability of CF patients to resolve airway infections points to dysregulated innate immune defenses. Since iron is essential for bacterial growth, upon infection the host limits the bioavailability of iron by up-regulating expression of hepcidin, the master iron regulating hormone, which limits iron uptake from the gut and retains iron in macrophages. This host defense strategy is known as the iron-limiting innate immune defense. Pyocyanin (PCN), a major virulence factor secreted from P. aeruginosa, is a cytotoxic redoxactive small molecule that exerts detrimental effects on host cells. The cytotoxic effects of PCN on CF bronchial epithelial cells are well established. However, the effect of PCN on iron-limiting innate immune defenses in macrophages is not known. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of PCN on hepcidin and other iron-regulated proteins in macrophages.",

Upon phagocytosis of invading pathogens, the respiratory burst is triggered as a defense mechanism that leads to ROS release required for the oxidative killing of invading pathogens. PCN inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, ROS release from macrophages triggered by phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan. PCN also inhibited TLR ligandinduced nitric oxide release from macrophages. In contrast, PCN amplified autophagy formation induced by TLR ligands. This may be due to PCN's ability to inhibit cellular respiration in mitochondria, since damaged mitochondria are recycled via autophagy. The data suggest that PCN's modulatory effects on macrophages support P. aeruginosa survival in the host. Further, PCN induced expression of hepcidin, which causes iron retention in macrophages. Increased labile iron in macrophages is toxic and leads to oxidative stress. PCN also up-regulated expression of NRAMP1 in human and murine macrophages. NRAMP1 controls iron export from phagosomes and late endosomes and therefore plays a very important role in cellular iron homeostasis and host defense.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Pyocyanin helps P. aeruginosa to persist in the CF host by modulating macrophage innate immune defenses. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) is a respiratory pathogen and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but its role in cystic fibrosis (CF) has not been well studied. An unexpectedly frequent number of SP were recovered from the sputum of pediatric CF patients, with a surprisingly high incidence of highly mucoid SP phenotype. Other mucoid bacteria, predominately Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been directly associated with CF respiratory decline, although the adaptive significance of mucoidy is not fully understood. It is also unclear whether mucoid SP contributes to respiratory failure among patients with CF. We investigated susceptibility to mucoid and non-mucoid SP and associated inflammation, using a mouse model of pneumococcal infection in CF. We hypothesized that highly mucoid SP would cause more severe lung disease than non-mucoid SP, and do so more readily in CFTRm1Unc\u2212/\u2212(FABPhCFTR) (CF-mice) than in CFTRm1Unc+/+FABPhCFTR) (WT-mice). Congenic CF-mice and WTmice were infected intranasally with 5x10 5 CFU SP. CHB756 (a highly mucoid capsular serotype 3 isolate), WU2 (a less mucoid capsular serotype 3 isolate), and CHB1058 (a non-mucoid capsular serotype 19A isolate) were compared. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, lung homogenates, and blood were collected from mice 5 days post-infection. CF-mice infected with CHB756 were more susceptible to infection than their wild type counterparts as indicated by higher bacterial burden from lung tissue and BAL fluids and/or higher mortality rates (P=0.0196); however, no significant difference in susceptibility was observed between CF-and WT-mice infected with either WU2 or CHB1058. Among CF-mice, infection with CHB756 resulted in significantly more profound disease than did infection with WU2 (P=0.0008) or CHB1058 (P\u2264 0.001). In a separate set of experiments, CF and WT-mice were infected intranasally with 1x10 5 CFU highly mucoid CHB756. BAL was collected 24 hours post-infection and TNF-\u03b1 quantified. CF-mice had a significantly higher bacterial burden than WT-mice (P=0.0026); however they also produced significantly lower TNF-\u03b1 per unit CFU compared to WT-animals (P=0.0069). Our results indicate that highly mucoid serotype 3 SP may cause more severe lung disease than non-mucoid SP, and does so more readily in the lungs of CF-mice than in the lungs of WT-animals. Infection with mucoid SP in CF-mice is also associated with decreased production of TNF-\u03b1. The results of this study support the association of highly mucoid SP with poor prognosis in a murine model of CF, and provide a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism that favors mucoidy in cystic fibrosis airways.

Isolates have been stored at -70 o C and cataloged. Many of the isolates that are available have linked clinical data that can be used for epidemiologic studies and to evaluate clinical status at the time isolates were obtained. The process for researchers to obtain these isolates is initiated by an email to the CF Isolate Core at Seattle Children's (CFIsolateCore@seattlechildrens.org). Researchers will be asked to provide some basic information on planned studies and the characteristics of isolates requested. Subsequently, a Materials Transfer Agreement will be established and the isolates retrieved from the archive and shipped to the requester. Some clinical data can be provided in a de-identified fashion. However, if additional information is needed, an IRB application must submitted to Seattle Children's. Isolates from research studies conducted through the TDN can also be obtained for specific studies along with linked study data. There is a separate process for these requests which should be submitted to the TDN.

As the disease progresses, strain variants can be distinguished from the strain initially acquired. However, the contribution of P. aeruginosa adaptation to lung disease is not completely understood. Comparing sequential strains isolated from a CF patient in multihost pathogenesis system, including non-mammalian and mammalian hosts, our previous works showed that P. aeruginosa early strains were lethal, while late adapted clonal isolates were attenuated in acute virulence but retained their capacity to persist in murine lungs (Bragonzi, AJRCCM 2009; Cigana, PlosOne 2010; Lor\u00e8, PlosOne 2012). To dissect the contribution of P. aeruginosa patho-adaptive strains during the progression of lung disease, we report the host-response in murine models of acute and chronic infection. As a model system in studying long term and persistent CF infections, the agar beads mouse model was used in a time course for up to three months in C57Bl/6 mice and Cftr tm1UNC TgN(FABPCFTR) mice. Bacterial count, inflammation and lung pathology were evaluated. During acute infection, cytokines and chemokines amounts in the whole lungs by bioplex assay were lower after infection with late patho-adaptive strains compared with early strain, confirming that late strains have evolved the capacity to evade innate immune system detection. After one month of chronic infection with P. aeruginosa late strains, cytokines/chemokines involved in leukocytes recruitments (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, KC, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-2) were lower than after acute infection. Impressively, MCP-1, IL-17, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, correlated to tissue damage control, were maintained during acute and chronic infection, indicating a continuous and elevated triggering of specific pathways. In addition, high amounts of sulphated glycosaminoglycan in lung homogenates, detected by a dye-binding assay, and TGF-\u03b2 production, measured by bioplex, were found in chronic infection, suggesting that late adapted strains may induce damage to airways. Histopathological examination of lung tissue sections showed that late adapted strains induced mucinpositive goblet cells metaplasia, collagen deposition and apoptosis, typical hallmarks of damage in the airway of CF patients. P. aeruginosa immunofluorescence staining showed that the persisting bacterial cells were localized in the bronchial lumen both in the beads and in biofilm-like structures.",

Because C12 may be present in high concentrations in biofilms (estimates range to 100 \u00b5M) and C12 has high lipid solubility, multiple cell types are likely to be exposed to C12 in CF lungs, including fibroblasts, epithelia, endothelia, macrophages and mast cells. C12 induces apoptosis and alters inflammatory responses in multiple types of host cells, though effects on inflammatory processes appear to depend on cell type and the specific response being measured. Biofilms elicit C12-like, proapoptotic effects on mitochondrial membrane potential, Ca 2+ signaling and IL8 secretion of airway epithelia (Schwarzer Cell Micro 14:698-709, 2012). C12 also triggers the unfolded protein response (Kravchenko, JBC 281: 2006 ). The present work tested whether bax and bak were involved in the effects of C12 on fibroblasts. In wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (wt MEF's) C12 (50\u00b5M) elicited, within 60 mins, typical apoptosis-associated effects, including blebbing of plasma membranes, condensation of nuclei, release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol and activation of caspase 3/7. C12 also caused, within 3-15 mins, Ca 2+ to be released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol and mitochondria to depolarize. C12 caused none of these effects in bax -/-/bak -/-(dko) MEF's. C12 had contradictory effects on NF-\u03ba\u0392 in wt MEF's, causing NF-\u03baB p65 to enter the nucleus from the cytosol during the first 45 mins of treatment (immunofluorescence), but inhibiting NF-\u03baB-regulated activity (luciferase expression) measured at 4 hrs. C12 also had contradictory effects on proinflammatory cytokine genes in wt MEF's: C12 stimulated expression (QPCR) but inhibited secretion (ELISA) of IL6 and KC in both untreated and in TNF\u03b1-treated wt MEF's. In contrast, C12 had no effect on either activity of NF-\u03ba\u0392 or expression/secretion of IL6 and KC in either untreated or in TNF\u03b1-treated dko MEF's (all at 4 hrs). Thus, C12-triggered apoptosis and inflammation responses all required bax/bak. It is proposed that C12 regulates bax/bak (or closely associated protein), which orchestrates a wide array of cellular events and signaling in host cells: (i) depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential; (ii) release of cytochrome C (followed by activation of caspase 3/7 and apoptosis); (iii) activation of IP 3 receptor (followed by release of Ca 2+ from the ER into the cytosol); (iv) activation of NF-\u03baB (and expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes); (v) inhibition of cytokine production and secretion resulting from effects of C12 to trigger ER stress and inhibit protein synthesis. These C12-triggered, bax/bax-dependent responses share many characteristics with those triggered by pattern associated molecular pattern receptors (e.g., TLR's and NODs).

It has been recently demonstrated that the detection of MRSA in the respiratory tract of CF patients is associated with worse survival; moreover, MRSA is a leading pathogen in ICUs also. Based on their genetic background, and in particular the genetic mobile element Staphylococcal Chromosome Cassette mec (SCCmec), it is possible to distinguish between community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). This distinction is important due to the high hospitalisation rate of both CF and ICU patients. Although several epidemic clones have been already described worldwide, data concerning genetic background of both CF and ICU patients are often scanty.

Aspergillus fumigatus is a frequent colonizer and pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF). Although allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is associated with deterioration of lung function, the relative contribution of A. fumigatus colonization versus host Th17-driven inflammation to the disease is not clear. We evaluated parameters of adaptive Th1/Th17/regulatory T (Treg) cell immunity to A. fumigatus in Cftr tm1Unc (Cftr-/-) mice, reported to mimic, to some extent, human CF as well as in human CF. Despite visible signs of inflammatory pathology in the lung parenchyma, and in the face of the heightened inflammatory response, only a moderate fungal growth in the lungs of Cftr-/-mice was observed. High levels of inflammatory cytokines, IL-17A and TNF-\u03b1 and neutrophils could be detected in these mice. Differences were observed in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) gene expression and protein in Cftr-/-mice as well as human CF compared to the corresponding controls. The tryptophan kynurenin pathway was down-regulated in experimental CF and correlated with an imbalanced Th17/Treg cell responses in the lungs. SNP analysis confirmed IDO deficiency in CF patients. Exogenous supply of kynurenins or IFN-\u03b3, or prevention of Th17 cell activation restored protective immunity to the fungus and improved lung inflammation and pathology in experimental CF. These data are a proof-of-concept demonstration that targeting the Th17/IDO/Treg imbalance and tryptophan kynurenin metabolism could have therapeutic and immunorestoration potential in CF. Background and Objectives: A primary cause of morbidity and mortality for CF patients is chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.) lung infection, and the acquired P.a. phenotypes of mucoidy, antibiotic (Ab) resistance, and quorum sensing deficiency. We hypothesize that specific volatile biomarkers exist for the mutations that confer these phenotypes, making it possible to detect the P.a. phenotype in the lung via breath analysis. In this work we have identified the putative biomarkers for the Ab-resistance mutation, mexA, using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographytime-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS) and artificial neural network analysis (ANN), and validated them using P.a. clinical isolates bearing this hallmark mutation for Ab resistance.",

Our long term goal is to understand how Pseudomonas aeruginosa detects and responds to the host, particularly in relation to the mammalian lung. We have used the P. aeruginosa response to pulmonary surfactant and human respiratory epithelial cells to identify transcripts induced in these conditions. Using this strategy, we identified a set of transcripts, PA5325, PA5328-PA5326, and ceramidase (PaCD), which are strongly and coordinately induced in response to these host-related environments. We noted that the PA5325 gene was divergently transcribed from an uncharacterized AraC-family transcription factor, PA5324.

            "text": "We determined that the PA5324 transcription factor controls PA5325, PA5328-PA5326, and PaCD transcription in response to host-derived sphingosine. Control is due to direct and specific binding of PA5324 to the regulated promoters. PA5324 could control transcription in response to sphingosine induction in an E. coli heterologous system, supporting a direct detection of sphingosine by PA5324. Based on these results, we have renamed PA5324 the Sphingosine Regulator (SphR). The SphR-controlled transcripts are induced in response to lung surfactant, respiratory epithelial cells, and during contact with macrophages. Deletion of sphR eliminates ceramidase activity and reduces hemolysis, phenocopying an alkaline ceramidase mutation. This is the first identification of a sphingosine-sensitive transcription factor in bacteria. We predict that SphR transcriptional regulation is important in response to many eukaryotic infection sites. This response to sphingosine may be of specific importance in the CF lung where ceramide accumulation would provide abundant precursor material to generate sphingosine. We are currently investigating the importance of this regulation in mouse models of lung infection.

Objectives: Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is used to treat CF patients and is partly metabolised in the liver by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Earlier studies has shown that CIP concentration can vary a lot from patient to patient, which can result in treatment failure. This variation may partly be explained by the differences in CYP3A4 enzyme activity. We used a Monte Carlo simulation to predict treatment outcome with one or two or three doses a day of oral 500 mg CIP on sensitive P. aeruginosa strains.

Background: Chronic pulmonary disease is characterized by a cycle of inflammation and infection and it is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is known that one of the major pathogens for the CF lung is Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Once chronic Pa infection is established, elimination of the microorganism from the airways is difficult, while eradication of Pa by early treatment of the first colonization has been documented. One of the most concerning consequences of treating these infections is the emergence of resistant organisms. Therefore there are limited therapeutic options available.

Cumulative antibiotic use is not an independent risk factor for S. maltophilia acquisition in the CF lung but may simply be a marker of increased disease severity. Further studies, particularly in a pediatric population, need to investigate the timing of exposures to other infections and antibiotic use, to better understand the mechanism behind acquisition of S. maltophilia. In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients the normal community of commensal bacteria in the gut can be affected by intestinal exocrine malfunction, antibiotic usage and swallowing of infected respiratory mucus. However, CFrelated gut dysbiosis has only recently been subjected to detailed investigation. Herein we report on the integrated metaproteomic, metagenomic and metabolomic workflow for monitoring gut microbiota composition. Twenty-four faecal samples were collected from cystic fibrosis young patients (age range 0-6 years) and 6 faecal samples from healthy children. All samples were processed for peptide, DNA and metabolite analysis. Protein content was analyzed with a shotgun metaproteomic approach by a nano-scale LC-MS2 set-up (Bruker amaZon-ETD) and filtered for operational taxon units (OTUs) assignment. OTUs were corroborated by hybridization of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene variable regions against the human intestinal tract microarray platform HITChip. In order to evaluate the volatile metabolites a gas-chromatographic (GC)-mass spectrometer (MS)/solid-phase microextraction (SPME) analysis was performed on Agilent Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC gas-chromatograph equipped with a MS detector 5970MSD (Hewlett-Packard, Geneva, Switzerland). 1 H-NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian 400 MHz Mercury-plus NMR. Pre-analytical steps of the metaproteomics workflow were devised to improve hit coverage, while the OTUs repository was guaranteed by metagenomics entries. 1 H-NMR and GC-MS/SPME were used to identify and quantify fecal metabolites.",

Unfortunately, PtgC was annotated in PGD as \"hypothetical protein,\" i.e. no experimental evidence of in vivo expression was available and thus its existence had only been predicted during bioinformatic genome analysis. To provide evidence of PtgC expression, we isolated membrane fractions, digested them with trypsin and identified the resulting tryptic peptides through Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT). Among the peptides identified by this approach, we found 6 peptides belonging to the PtgC periplasmic domain. These results validate PtgC expression and strongly suggest that PtgC localizes in membrane compartments. To assess whether the conservation of the structural TG domain correlated with transglutaminase activity, an N-(His)10-PtgC periplasmic domain (PtgCPD) was purified and tested through a colorimetric microassay, using purified guinea pig transglutaminase as positive control. PtgCPD displayed a positive transglutaminase test, with a specific activity that was about 45% of that of the guinea pig counterpart. We plan to design and test inhibitors of PtgCPD transglutaminase activity, which will be further assayed for antimicrobial effects on P. aeruginosa, both on cultured bacteria and in animal models of lung infection. Moreover, we plan to test in animal models the effectiveness of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), targeting the ptgC mRNA, which were shown to elicit growth inhibition of cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Surface-associated proteins play a key role in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Given these roles, identification and characterization of such proteins may lead to novel antibacterial targets. In addition, since surface proteins face the host immune system, they may be basic elements of effective vaccines. We report on specific magneto-capturing followed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) for the analysis of surface-exposed proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) were activated making them able to establish covalent bonds with proteins. Given their chemical composition, size (average diameter = 70-90 nm), and negative charge, these NPs were expected to be atoxic for bacterial cells. Indeed, viable counts of bacterial cells incubated with and without NPs indicated no lethality. Transmission electron microscopy evidence also indicated that NPs were unable to get through the cell envelope and distributed instead over the cell surface. Furthermore, we demonstrated that only activated NPs could collect proteins from cells whereas no proteins were detected in controls experiments carried out with NPs inactivated prior to exposure to cells. These features supported the development of a method for magneto-capturing surface-exposed proteins that greatly improves sensitivity and specificity of previous methods such as surface \"shaving\" with proteases. Briefly, activated NPs were incubated with bacterial cells and, subsequently, their reactive groups were inactivated. Cells were disrupted, and NPs were magnetically separated from cell extracts, washed several times, and tested for protein and cell membrane content. Consequently the NPs bound to cell envelope structures (NP-Enve-lope) were digested by trypsin to shave protruding protein domains. Tryptic peptides shaved from NP-Envelope were identified by MudPIT analysis. Alternatively, heat and detergents were used to remove from NP-Envelope all envelope material but proteins covalently bound to NPs, which were identified by MudPIT analysis. Shedding of proteins and proteins released by spontaneous cell lysis were monitored through control experiments.",

A relevant number of proteins with high localization confidence in outer membrane, along with pilin and FliD (a flagellar hook-associated protein) or outer membrane porin family proteins, were identified. A feature of this approach that is relevant to vaccine development is the possibility to obtain information about protein topology by the direct identification with MudPIT of domains exposed from membrane layers. Therefore, our results might contribute to accelerating the process of vaccine target identification and development. Table. Conclusions: There was no difference in GM values between the 3 groups. Paradoxically the CC group had lower GM values than the others. No AE were reported in CC group (p <0.05), while 6 AE were reported in the IC group (4 ABPA, 1 CPA and 1 aspergilloma) and 1 (ABPA) in NC group. In CF high levels of Aspergillus GM on sputum could indicate a possible marker of pulmonary AE, above all in IC patients. Given the small population, further studies are needed to estabilish the role of sputum GM in CF.

Its prevalence is underestimated and its role in the evolution of the CF lung disease is not known. Moreover, its pathogenicity in the pediatric CF population has never been studied.

However, samples collected during periods of relative have lower levels of intersample diversity (beta diversity) and show high levels of ecosystem similarity, suggesting that exacerbations are represented by deviations from a stable equilibrium community. In addition, our results underscore the importance of anaerobic bacteria in cystic fibrosis. Greater than 92% of specimens are positive for organisms from the genus Prevotella, and greater than 89% are positive for Veillonella.

Work is ongoing to explore the effect of this intervention in a chronic Pa infection model using bioluminescence as a read out of bacterial burden. Cystic fibrosis is a disease that is newly diagnosed in 1000 children each year. The number one cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis disease is through bacterial infection in the lungs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key player in acute and chronic lung infections. There is growing evidence that chronic infections involve the biofilm form of the bacteria. Thus far, in vitro research into bacterial-mammalian interactions have focused on planktonic bacteria, which is not reflective of chronic infections. Studies examining the interaction of biofilm with host cells are sparse and have involved infecting mice with specific biofilm-mutants and examining the disease outcome; or through the isolation of bacterial species from the sputum of infected patients and examining their in vitro characteristics. These studies are not only expensive and time-consuming but they also cannot interpret specific cell interactions during the infection. This research program has established an in vitro system for the co-culture of biofilm or planktonic Pseudomonas bacteria with human lung epithelial A549 cells that reflects key aspects of clinical chronic and acute lung infections. This system involves the growth of biofilm on a 96-peg lid, which can subsequently be transferred into plates containing A549 cells. With this system, we established that planktonic exposure produced pronounced cell rounding and cytoskeletal dysregulation as well as bacterial internalization but not from biofilm exposure, which is consistent with clinical data for acute and chronic lung infections. Biofilm stimulated an increase in epithelial metabolism, bringing the cells out of their quiescent state, as well as stimulating an increase in IL-8 production, which is reflective of chronic infections. We also found that pre-treatment of the biofilm with the innate immune peptide LL-37 caused the biofilm to stimulate an increase in IL-8 production by A549 cells, a potentially unfavorable result. Using this co-culture system we were able to determine that biofilm secretes a soluble factor that causes morphological A549 cell changes and this factor is absent in planktonic coculture. Interestingly, growing the biofilm in the presence of LL-37 obliterates the release of the factor. This secreted factor in biofilm P. aeruginosa infections could serve as a target for therapeutics to reduce inflammation and cell damage in chronic infections. Based on the data summarized, the value of this co-culture system for the delineation of key differences in biofilm or planktonic bacterial interactions with lung epithelia has been clearly demonstrated.",

We recommend careful assessments of those presenting with vasculitis in order to better characterize this process and so guide better treatments. influenzae, and non-mucoidal Pseudomonas aeroginosa (NM-Pa) are the most common organisms found in younger patients with CF. Of these three only Pa has been currently recognized as causing potential long-term changes in the airways after chronic exposure.

            "text": "Conclusions: Currently there are no guidelines as to whether treatment of first or recurrent growth of organisms other than Pa is beneficial. To begin the process of establishing treatment guidelines for new CF pathogens in young patients, the first step would be to identify the most common organisms and investigate clinical correlations. This will be important in ultimately determining appropriate treatment guidelines. In the initial part of our study, we identified the most common organisms found on first culture results of patients 0 to 4 years of age. We will next gather important clinical data such as number of exacerbations, lung function and CT results, to decide which organisms deserve attention for attempted early eradication. Approval of a drug for use in CF patients requires a high standard of safety, including determining the impact on sputum bacterial density, antimicrobial susceptibility, and emerging pathogens in the CF airway. The Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) Center for CF Microbiology (CCFM) is a national resource center that uses state of the art CF microbiology methods to perform the microbiology for clinical trials in CF. The CCFM has been involved in studies for many agents in the CFF Drug Pipeline, including TOBI\u00ae, azithromycin, Cayston\u00ae, Arikace\u00ae, Kalyde-co\u00ae, and KB001. CCFM technologists are very experienced, performing thousands of CF cultures each year for almost two decades. This experience has led to many discoveries and innovations in CF microbiology including a proposal to eliminate sputum gram stains for CF samples, recommendations for a molecular identification schema for non-lactose-fermenting gram negative bacilli, and detection of small colony variant (SCV) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. We routinely perform quantitative bacterial cultures using multiple serial dilutions plated onto up to 10 different selective media, a technique that is not available in most clinical or commercial laboratories, because it is very labor intensive. This method enables detection and isolation of even fastidious bacteria, as well as quantitation of specific organisms. Decrease in sputum bacterial density has been both a primary and a secondary endpoint in many studies. Cultures for fungi and acid fast bacteria are performed using CF-specific protocols including the use of a double decontamination technique (initial decontamination by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine -NaOH, followed by a second decontamination of the sediment by oxalic acid) for isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Organisms are identified in the CCFM laboratory using state of the art techniques including limited biochemical testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization with detection by a time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF). The laboratory has also developed methodology and standards for detection and classification of bacterial small colony variants of Staphylococcus aureus. Both classical and molecular testing methods are used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, as appropriate for study needs. Additional services provided by the CCFM include initial consultation for proposed studies to identify the key microbiology testing components necessary, development of study-specific microbiology specifications, and archiving of study isolates that, with permission, may become a part of the TDN specimen bank and can be linked to study data. The infrastructure for the CCFM is funded by the CF Foundation, to enable the laboratory to maintain high standards and experienced staff. Costs for specific studies are based on testing requested and are borne by the study sponsors.",

            "text": "Supported by the CF Foundation. The Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa establishes lifelong infections in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections are enabled by formation of biofilms, antibiotic-tolerant aggregations of bacteria. P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in the CF lung is a complex process leading to a decrease in production of factors typically associated with virulence, such as toxins, and an increase in production of secreted polysaccharides. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing this switch to biofilm formation in the CF lung will aid the identification of novel therapies to thwart these actions. We have recently discovered a magnesium transporter in P. aeruginosa, called MgtE, that inhibits the expression of the bacterial Type III Secretion System (T3SS). Because a decrease in T3SS production is one hallmark of the chronic CF biofilm phenotype, factors that induce expression of the mgtE gene might influence biofilm formation in the CF lung. We have previously found that the antibiotic tobramycin enhances mgtE transcription. Our objective in this current study was to determine whether other antibiotics also influence mgtE transcription. Using quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we tested the effect of 12 antibiotics from 9 different antibiotic classes on mgtE transcription. Nine out of 12 of these antibiotics induced transcription of mgtE. To determine whether this effect was part of a general stress response, we screened a mutant library for mutants in genes connected with stress pathways in P. aeruginosa. We found potential regulatory interactions between MgtE and AlgR. Importantly, AlgR also regulates synthesis of the exopolysaccharide alginate, which is produced in large amounts in CF-related P. aeruginosa biofilms. Our results suggest that antibiotics in the CF lung environment can enhance mgtE gene transcription, which in turn can inhibit T3SS and possibly influence alginate production through AlgR. Through this and additional studies, we can obtain a better understanding of how signals present in the CF lung environment influence formation of P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and chronic infection.",

Dept. of Biology, Indiana Univ./Purdue Univ., Indianapolis, IN, USA Background: Magnesium is an essential element in many cellular functions for both humans and bacteria.

A bacterial species especially well-equipped for this purpose is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most formidable pathogens in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). When P. aeruginosa encounters variations in nutrient availability, as may be the case in CF lung infections, it responds by altering expression of a number of virulence factors, including biofilm formation, motility, toxin release, and antibiotic resistance.",

However, both the previous and new EP maintained similar efficacy compared to historical data. While overall eradication rates were similar, a portion of our patients required the addition of systemic antibiotics to achieve SE. We are uncertain whether this tier escalation is due to an unintended adverse effect of AZM on PsA eradication or the result of selection bias. Limitations to this study include but are not limited to small sample size and perhaps inadequate dosing of AZM. Antibiotics remain a cornerstone of therapy with standard microbiologic cultures of cystic fibrosis (CF) airway secretions and their antibiotic sensitivity testing guiding therapy. However, in many cases therapy remains largely empiric, particularly in advanced disease. Metagenomic analysis is a sequence-based analysis of the collective genomes and provides a more comprehensive and culture-independent assessment of the microbial and viral communities, yielding not only taxonomic but also critical functional information such as microbial virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, and metabolic profiles. We hypothesize that metagenomic analysis of CF airway sputum provides complementary information to standard microbiology assessments that may inform clinical decision-making.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, results in a lung environment that is highly conducive to chronic polymicrobial infection. Pulmonary disease resulting from these chronic infections is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adult CF patients. Conventional culturing methods have identified several key pathogens associated with the cystic fibrosis lung. However, with the advent of deep sequencing technology, a more complete survey of all the bacteria in the CF lung, the CF lung microbiome, can now be made. We followed the dynamics of the CF lung microbiome in nine adult patients with CF throughout the course of a clinical exacerbation. Consistent with previous microbiome studies, we do not find a particular organism or set of organisms that predicts an exacerbation. Instead, we find that the bacterial communities are consistent within a patient and durable throughout the course of infection. Over 120 bacterial genera were detected in this study. Despite this large number of genera, we find that the bacterial communities of all nine patients can be described by relatively few genera. That is, a genus that is highly abundant in a single patient is also highly prevalent across patients. Although the mere presence or absence of a particular set of organisms is not enough to predict an exacerbation, given the correlation between abundance and prevalence, investigation into the molecular mechanisms of polymicrobial infections among a few highly abundant genera will likely yield important insights into respiratory infections in CF as a whole. A major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) is respiratory failure from Pseudomonas aeruginosa-associated chronic lung infection. Other conditions associated with P. aeruginosa infection include bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urinary tract infections and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa results, in part, from secreted effector and virulence factors that facilitate its growth, invasion and cytotoxicity. The expression of many P. aeruginosa effectors is coordinated by bacterial signalling molecules, including N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C12). In addition, C12 activates multiple host responses including apoptosis, phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and eIF2\u03b1, and c-jun transcription. Cell damage, including apoptotic cell death, has been reported to occur in the CF lung. We hypothesized that C12-induced apoptosis in CF lung epithelia enhances Pseudomonas pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we identified smallmolecule inhibitors of C12-induced cellular responses using cell-based screening approaches. We identified triazoloquinoline (TQ) as inhibitors of C12-induced apoptosis in several cell types relevant to CF lung disease. In cultured macrophage-like (RAW) cells, the most potent TQ inhibited apoptosis following 25 \u00b5M C12 with IC50 ~150 nM, with near complete inhibition at higher TQ concentrations. C12-induced apoptosis was also strongly inhibited by TQ in primary cell cultures, including murine embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages. In all cells tested, TQ did not inhibit apoptosis caused by anisomycin or staurosporine, suggesting selectivity for C12-induced apoptosis. In addition to inhibiting apoptosis, mechanistic studies indicated that TQ partially inhibited C12-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eIF2\u03b1 (~50% inhibition at 1000 nM), but did not affect C12-induced c-jun synthesis. These studies establish TQ compounds as inhibitors of C12-induced cellular responses involved in apoptosis that are of utility to investigate C12-induced host responses in the CF lung. TQs or related inhibitors of C12-induced apoptosis provide a new potential therapeutic approach against P. aeruginosa that is quite different from conventional antimicrobials.",

With a recent surge in cystic fibrosis (CF) microbiome research comes debate and uncertainty associated with the selection of appropriate methods for the extraction of DNA. Culture-independent community profiling methods have been noted to occasionally miss species detected using culture based methods. To examine the extent of extraction-based species bias, we tested two popular DNA extraction kits with Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial controls, mixed-species communities of defined composition, and expectorated sputum samples from patients with CF. We evaluated DNA extraction kits effectiveness by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and 16S rRNA library construction. A mock community was constructed by mixing equal optical densities of eight overnight individual cultures of Burkholderia cepacia, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia amylovora, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus mutans. The manufacturer's protocols for the DNeasy\u00ae Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) and Mobio UltraClean\u00ae Soil DNA Isolation Kit with varying the condition of bead beating, presence/absence of lysozyme and/or sputolysin were tested. DNA from these extractions was used as template in amplifications with the universal 8F and 926R primers. The resulting PCR products were digested with CfoI and separated using the ABI system. The peaks generated were analysed to determine the species composition produced by each DNA extraction. Individual species TRFLP runs were included as references. Sputum samples from CF patients attending the Adult CF Clinic were also tested by sequencing of 16S rRNA libraries. Variability in purity and total DNA recovery was observed amongst all extraction methods tested. Most species in the mock community were detected in all extraction methods, but with differences in profiles noted between kits. Lysozyme pretreatment resulted in improved detection of Gram positive species, both in the mock community and in sputum samples. Extraction using the Qiagen DNeasy kit with lysozyme pre-treatment resulted in broader diversity detected within sputum samples than the Mobio Soil DNA Isolation Kit, largely resulting from better detection of Gram positives. These results highlight the potential for introduction of biases in culture-independent characterization of mixed bacterial community samples based on the DNA extraction method used, and indicate the importance of optimizing DNA extraction protocols used in culture-independent studies of the CF microbiome.",

            "text": "Damage to the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients occurs in a heterogeneous pattern with the apical regions generally becoming more damaged than the lower lungs. The etiology of this disease heterogeneity remains elusive. The strong association between P. aeruginosa infection and lung function declines raise the possibility that differences in bacterial functions could contribute to disease heterogeneity. Our lab and others have found that infecting P. aeruginosa strains evolve to produce a diverse population of genetic variants within the lungs of CF patients. We hypothesized that P. aeruginosa variants residing in highly damaged lung regions may have more injury potential than bacteria found in areas of mild disease. To address this hypothesis, we obtained secretions from lobar regions of explanted CF lungs and selected several hundred P. aeruginosa isolates from each region for phenotype testing. Using a combination of phenotype tests, we categorized the P. aeruginosa population into variant subpopulations. The bacteria were confirmed to be derived from a common ancestral strain by DNA fingerprinting. Surprisingly, different subpopulations dominated in the major anatomical lung regions of all four lungs we have studied. Sequence analysis, protein expression assays, and phenotypic tests of P. aeruginosa from one lung revealed that the predominant isolates in the upper lobe (the most injured region) were more capable of expressing type III secretion exotoxins as compared to isolates from areas of the lung with less injury. This phenotype caused enhanced cytoxicity to eukaryotic cells in vitro, and increased virulence in a mouse lung infection model. Together, these data suggest that regional differences in CF airway P. aeruginosa populations could contribute to heterogeneous lung disease in CF patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that significantly contributes to the decline in airway function and an increase in patient mortality in cystic fibrosis. Chronic airway infection by Pseudomonas induces sustained immune and inflammatory responses that result in damage to the airway. Pseudomonas ability to resist host defenses is aided by the secretion of virulence factors and the formation of biofilms. Secreted virulence factors act to modulate host immune and inflammatory responses. Biofilms encapsulate the bacteria, protecting them from host defenses and limiting therapeutic delivery. Among the virulence factors, a variety of proteases are secreted from Pseudomonas. Alkaline protease (AP), a zinc-metalloprotease, has been associated with Pseudomonas infection in the cystic fibrosis lung. Previous work suggests that protease secretion is correlated with bacterial exacerbation in the airway, though the mechanisms are unknown.",

            "text": "Recent studies suggest that misregulation of protease activities in the cystic fibrosis lung may alter water absorption and mucocilliary clearance through proteolytic processing of ENaC. To evaluate the potential role of AP in altered ENaC activation, AP was purified and its folding, activity and ability to activate ENaC were assessed. Previously, we have shown that AP folding is coupled with calcium binding to a conserved Repeats-in-ToXin (RTX) domain. Here we show that AP folding was efficient under pH and calcium conditions thought to be in the airway surface liquid of normal and CF lungs. Short circuit measurements of ENaC in polarized monolayers indicated that AP activated ENaC in immortalized cell lines. This increase in ENaC activity was kinetically distinct from that elicited by trypsin or elastase treatment and resulted in submaximal activation of ENaC. Heterologously expressed ENaC, with mutations in either the alpha or gamma subunit cleavage sites, demonstrated that the activation of ENaC was mediated by gamma subunit cleavage. Finally, post-transplant, primary human bronchial epithelial cells from both CF and non-CF patients showed ENaC activation after treatment with AP. Based on these data, patho-mechanisms associated with AP in the CF lung are proposed wherein secretion of AP leads to local, decreased airway surface liquid volume and a corresponding decrease in mucocilliary clearance of pulmonary pathogens. Thus, local remodeling of the CF airway may be induced by secreted factors from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in order to favor pathogen adherence and colonization.

Introduction: X-ray velocimetry (XV) is a new imaging method that combines synchrotron-based phase contrast X-ray imaging with motion tracking methods used in fluid mechanics to detect the presence of lung disease. Structural changes that occur during lung disease alter the flow of air and the motion of the lungs, whether by obstruction increasing airway resistance, or by changes to lung parenchyma altering the mechanical properties of the tissue. Altered or abnormal motion of the lungs is thus also an indicator of disease. The XV technique is extremely sensitive to small changes in lung function as it is able to measure motion at thousands of points across the lungs in 4 dimensions (3 spatial dimensions over time), providing \"pin-point spirometry\". As a demonstration of the technique's ability to characterise CF-like lung disease, we applied XV to adult \u03b2-ENaC mice.",

Radiographic abnormalities are seen in the majority of individuals due to viscous secretions, with subsequent mucosal thickening and polypoid obstruction. In many cases, chronic infection of the sinuses is associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms and lower quality of life scores. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is an effective procedure for the management of chronic symptomatic sinusitis in patients with CF, but recurrence of sinus disease is common. Dornase alfa (DNase) decreases the viscosity of airway secretions and has been shown to improve lung function in patients with CF.

This study was supported by a research grant from Genentech. Improved care of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has altered the prognosis to such an extent that almost all children reach adult life. As life expectancy increases, new clinical problems become evident. CF is a chronic inflammatory disease and the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is well recognised, however it's believed that atherosclerosis is rare in CF. Increased arterial stiffness is an early feature of atherosclerosis and has been shown in adult CF patients. Arterial compliance is the inverse of stiffness and arterial distensibility is the change in vessel area for a given pressure change. Both decrease with atherosclerosis. We hypothesised that CF children would have altered aortic compliance and distensibility. Furthermore these differences would be exaggerated in the presence of CF diabetes and worsening lung function.",

We subsequently examined consistency of dornase alfa therapy at the patient level by identifying the number of recorded medication switches (on to off or off to on) during the period. Patients were included if they had at least 3 encounters with dornase alfa and did not appear to initiate or discontinue therapy during the period. Inconsistent therapy was defined as having \u22653 documented switches, or 2 switches with \u22652 consecutive encounters where dornase alfa was not indicated. In other words, consistent therapy was defined as always on dornase alfa or just a single encounter without dornase alfa. Multivariable logistic regression, stratified by age group, was used to identify patient factors associated with inconsistent documented dornase alfa therapy.",

Rates of inconsistent dornase alfa therapy, as well as patient-level predictors of inconsistency, vary by age.

Background: Atypical or non-classic cystic fibrosis (CF) often presents as a diagnostic dilemma. A patient typically presents with at least one organ phenotype that resembles CF, normal (<40 mEq/L) or borderline (40-60 mEq/L) sweat chloride (Cl -), and one or fewer mutations in CFTR. We tested the hypothesis that a nasal potential difference (NPD) could discriminate between non-CF, CF, and atypical CF in one or more of the following measures: baseline PD, response to amiloride, and/or response to low Clcombined with isoproterenol.",

Background: The lung clearance index (LCI), measured by multiple breath washout (MBW), has been shown to be a sensitive maker of early CF lung disease (1) and we have recently demonstrated that it can be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials (2) . LCI, however, is affected by changes in breathing pattern which may impact on test variability especially in infants and young children. Moment analysis of MBW parameters assesses the shape (skewness) of the washout curve and has been shown to be less affected by variability in breathing frequency or tidal volume. Moment analysis is performed by setting the starting gas concentration at 100% and by plotting end-tidal gas concentrations against the number of lung turnovers (FRCs). Moment 0 is the area under this curve while moments 1 and 2 represent single and double multiplications with the number of lung turnovers. Results are then expressed as moment ratios (\u00b51/\u00b50 and \u00b52/\u00b50 ) with higher moment ratios being more reflective of ventilation inhomogeneity (VI) in the periphery of the lung.",

The role of small airway fibrosis in non-endstage CF lung disease has not been commonly described, and represents a novel aspect of lung pathology shared with other CF-affected organs (pancreas, liver). Investigating CF-relevant mechanisms of tissue remodeling and fibrosis may offer novel insight into the pathophysiology of CF respiratory decline refractory to conventional therapy. Results: CF-PI and PCD patients were similar in current age and both were significantly younger than the CF-PS group. CF-PI patients were diagnosed earlier than CF-PS and PCD patients (p<0.001). Mean FEV 1 was similar in the three groups however, FEV 1 had a strong negative correlation with age among CF patients as a group (r=-0.349, p<0.001) and in both CF subgroups: CF-PI (r=-0.348, p=0.018) and CF-PS (r=-0.474, p=0.022). Among PCD patients the correlation was not statistically significant (r=-0.358, p=0.061). Interestingly, patients with CF as a group (p<0.001) and CF-PI and CF-PS as a subgroups (p=0.006 and 0.001, respectively) had a signifi-cantly higher body mass index (BMI) than patients with PCD. A strong correlation between BMI and FEV 1 was found in the CF-PI group (r=0.338, p=0.007) and, to a lesser extent, in the PCD group (r=0.438, p=0.06). No correlation was found between BMI and FEV 1 in the CF-PS group (r=-0.05, p=0.77), who maintained stable and good BMI values at all ages. CT-TBS was highest (worse structural disease) in the CF-PI group and lower and very similar in the CF-PS and PCD groups. In the CF-PI group, most of the pathology was found in the upper lobes, in PCD in the middle and lower lobes and no consistent lobar pattern was seen in the CF-PS group. In both CF groups CT-TBS had a strong negative correlation with FEV 1 ; however, in PCD there was no correlation between CT-TBS and FEV 1 .

Ten patients were diagnosed due to bronchiectasis and 10 had a non-respiratory cause (infertility (6), family history (3) and malabsorption (1)). Median sweat chloride level was 64nmol/L; 75% had level >60nmol/L and 25% indeterminate/normal level. The diagnosis of CF was made in 19/20 (95%) using a combination of sweat test and genotype. Late diagnosed patients had a significantly lower prevalence of DF508 mutation (0% homozygous, 60% heterozygous and 40% no DF508 mutation).

In response to CF centre treatment and care they do demonstrate significant improvements in both nutritional and respiratory status, especially those with bronchiectasis and pancreatic sufficiency. Improved prognosis highlights the importance of diagnostic testing for CF in patients with unexplained bronchiectasis with repeat sweat tests and extended genetic mutation analysis. Background and Aims: Beneficial effects of nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are well documented. Long term use of HS increases mucociliary clearance and lung function and decreases pulmonary exacerbations. The aim of this study was to determine if the inhalation of a higher volume (10 mL) of HS increases the time without pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients compared with the inhalation of a standard volume (5 mL).",

Vitamin D 25-OH levels were introduced in different models as either continuous or categorical variables (> 30 vs. <30). The probability (log-odds) of a pulmonary exacerbation within one year after vitamin D measurement was modeled using repeated measures logistic regression with covariates of age, sex, age at CF diagnosis, pancreatic status, BMI z-score, and chronic infection status for Pseudomonas and MRSA.

Background: Airway surface liquid (ASL) height is compromised in CF lung pathogenesis. Inhaled hypertonic saline (HS), osmotically drawing water from the interstitium to the ASL, has been shown to decrease the number and severity of exacerbations, reducing lung disease progression rate. HS, though desirable, convenient and safe, is associated with bronchoconstriction and irritation of the mucosa of the higher airways which can reduce adherence. Hyaluronic acid (HA), known for its hydrating properties, has recently been studied for its barrier role in the matrix.

Higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this population is previously unreported as is the more common occurrence of CF liver disease. We also report a novel CFTR gene mutation. Background: Cystic fibrosis is associated with altered plasma fatty acid levels. A deficiency of essential fatty acids like linoleic acid (LA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and increased levels of arachidonic acid (AA) have been described in patients with cystic fibrosis. Supplementation of high doses of omega-3 fatty acids was effective in terms of correction of the lipid imbalance but data on improvement in lung function and other clinical aspects are not conclusive. Maybe altered metabolization of AA and DHA to pro-resolving lipid mediators like lipoxins, protectins and resolvins play a major role on clinical impact of supplementation therapy. Therefore, in our study we focused on mild cystic fibrosis patients where endogenous proinflammatory signals are supposed to be dampened by pro-resolving control mechanisms.",

CF patients without (n=19) and with (n=13) SAD were examined by body plethysmography and induced sputum was analyzed for differential cell count and sputum inflammatory biomarkers were measured by RT-PCR and cytometric bead array (CBA).

However, CF patients with and without SAD did not differ significantly in terms of PUFA levels suggesting limited inflammation in mild CF disease. It is possible that these mild CF patients benefit from intervention with omega-3 fatty acids to a greater extent than patients with moderate or severe CF lung disease. Background: Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy and hypertonic saline are two well established therapies used to aid airway clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF). Poor ventilation and obstruction begin in the peripheral airways in patients with CF, therefore methods of targeting deposition of medications to these regions may be beneficial. It is well known that patients with CF have a high treatment burden, and high levels of non-adherence to airway clearance techniques (ACT), especially in adolescence. This is a major challenge for those caring for patients with CF. Combining PEP with the inhalation of an aerosol has been described in the literature in adult populations, showing generation of smaller aerosol particle size and a proportional redistribution of aerosol to the peripheral airways. This therapy is used in clinics around Australia, however no published data exists on patient acceptability, clinical effectiveness, or effects on adherence.",

Dynamic hyperinflation is difficult to predict from FEV 1 , therefore, CPET is a useful tool to directly determine its presence. Comprehensive PR includes education regarding pulmonary disorders, exercise training, nutrition classes, and psychosocial counseling. Traditional PR programs for patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD have shown positive outcomes. In addition, physical activity has been shown to benefit cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. As a result, PR may be a beneficial intervention for CF. However, few centers have designed PR programs for CF patients and there are no current studies describing the outcomes of PR programs for CF patients.

[1] suggest that the maximum heart rate after 6-MWT approximates the heart rate at anaerobic threshold during formal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in CF patients, which could allow for greater refinement of exercise prescription. We sought to identify predictive factors for 6-MWD during hospital admission for CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPE).",

Resting tachycardia is commonly observed in patients with severelyreduced lung function, but FEV1% alone does not predict 6-MWD. Patients with lower baseline heart rates and cardiac reserve are likely to walk farther, probably due to better overall conditioning. That older patients recovered faster and weighed more than younger patients likely reflects a bias toward longevity in those with milder CF phenotypes. The UK economic climate has brought an increased requirement to justify physiotherapy staffing levels. The in-patient physiotherapy workforce is reduced at our adult CF centre during weekend days compared to weekdays; interventions are provided by a less concentrated and specialist work force during weekend days. Routine objective physiotherapy patient assessment includes measurement of daily wet sputum weight and spirometry (admission and then twice weekly). This provides opportunity to evaluate the effect of the differing work force on these outcomes.",

Men appeared to like exercise while women were more ambivalent; however both felt the most important reasons to exercise were to keep fit and healthy, to make them feel good, and to help clear their chests, while improving bowel function was seen as least important. Few perceived any significant barriers to exercise except lack of motivation and having no time (reported more by women than men, p=0.002 and 0.021 respectively). Overall exercise was felt to be more important to people now compared with when they were 16-18yrs old (65% M, 59% F) although over half felt their level of exercise had decreased as they had aged (53% M, 59% F).",

They participate in a large variety of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, with around 60% achieving the UK Government's recommendations for 150 minutes of moderately intense exercise in 30-minute sessions/week. Few barriers were identified to exercise; moreover the benefits were clearly appreciated, and its importance was felt to grow with age. Survival differences may relate, in part, to exercise intensity at different stages of life; prospective studies are necessary to elucidate this further. Exercise tolerance is reduced in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ventilatory limitation, peripheral skeletal muscle weakness and poor nutritional status may contribute to exercise intolerance. The mechanisms of exertional dyspnoea are less understood, but it seems that dynamic hyperinflation may play a role. So we investigated the role of exercise dynamic hyperinflation on breathlessness (DYS) and leg fatigue (LEG) in CF patients. Seventeen stable CF patients (32\u00b18SD yrs; FEV1 2.66\u00b10.7 L; 68\u00b116% pred; inspiratory capacity (IC) 3.4\u00b11.0 L), during constant load cycle ergometry at 80% VO 2 max were studied. Intensity of breathlessness and leg fatigue, by Borg scale, and IC were recorded every 2 minutes. The individual slopes of the change in IC vs DYS and IC vs LEG were also computed.",

In addition, resting IC did not predict the rate of change in DYS or LEG.

Introduction: Physical activity is associated with acute changes in the levels of inflammatory mediators. The effect chronic physical activity plays on markers of inflammation is less defined. We sought to understand this better by measuring time spent in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and correlating to interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) in persons with cystic fibrosis and controls.",

IL-6 also is a key regulator of other cytokines by stimulating IL-10 and IL-1ra production and inhibiting TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production. Multiple studies have shown significant increases in IL-6 during exercise so the positive correlation between IL-6 and MVPA was not surprising. The reason the correlation was found in persons with CF but not controls is unknown. Physical activity was measured in the week after serum was drawn so the IL-6 may have been reflective of recent physical activity rather than chronic physical activity. This may be supported by the fact that IL-6 was higher in persons with CF than controls (10.6 pg/mL versus 4.1 pg/mL) but this difference did not meet significance (p=0.08). Serum IL-8 was found to be higher in persons with CF than controls. We also found serum IL-8 to be correlated with FEV1. This correlation has also been found by other investigators but our PPMC was higher (-0.56 versus -0.37). This is likely explained by our smaller sample size. Further studies are needed to better understand the correlation physical activity may have on inflammation in persons with CF. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis is the third most common lung transplant diagnosis in the United States. The top five in order from most common to least common are COPD, IPF, CF, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, and sarcoidosis. Outcomes for patients on the waiting list with CF have not been recently analyzed.

However, with the implementation of the Lung Allocation Score in 2005 there has been a significant increase in the percentage of patients receiving transplants and a significant decrease in those dying on the waiting list. This would indicate that in the first five years since implementation, the Lung Allocation score has improved waiting list outcomes for the majority of cystic fibrosis patients. The data showing more patients too sick to transplant may reflect an increase in late stage referrals, and earlier discussion of transplant options or referral for transplant evaluation may be indicated for certain patients. Bilateral lung transplant is a treatment for end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease when there is no further treatment available. The aim of lung transplant is to improve patient life expectancy. CF is the leading indication for lung transplant in adolescents (12-17) accounting for 72% of all lung transplants in this age group. Survival for pediatric lung transplant is similar to that of the adult population. The half-life of adult recipients was 5.4 years compared with 5.5 years in pediatric recipients.

Methods: Starting 16Jul07 all infants born in CA were screened for CF using the CA model which has 4 steps: (1) measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in all newborn blood spot specimens, (2) specially designed CA (29-40) CFTR mutation panel testing of specimens with high IRT values (\u226562 ng/mL, top 1.5%), (3) CFTR full gene sequence analysis of specimens found to have only 1 mutation in Step 2, and (4) referring infants with 2 or more mutations/variants to CF Care Centers (CFCs) for sweat chloride (SC) testing and follow up. Infants with only 1 mutation detected are not referred for sweat testing; their mothers are sent a letter describing the infant's carrier status and offered telephone genetic counseling. CFCs are asked to report all newly diagnosed CF cases not referred to them by the screening program (false negatives (FN)). Beginning 1Jul10, the program was expanded to include parent testing for families of Step 3 positive babies without a clinical diagnosis and without CFTR variants known to be in trans.",

We have previously shown that infants with CF who achieved catch-up weight gain and recovered their birth weight z-scores by age 2 years (\"responders\") have better lung function and chest x-ray scores (CXR) at age 6 years than infants who did not recover their birth weight zscores by age 2. In addition, this early life weight recovery had a stronger effect on pulmonary status at age 6 than growth patterns during ages 2-6 (Pediatrics 2009;123:714).

Hypotheses grouped into four main areas: equipment factors, patient selection factors, staff training, and sweat collection technique. We confirmed with on-site consultation with Wescor that our equipment and techniques were good. We determined that babies with QNS ST did not differ significantly in age, weight, acuity of illness or reported skin color from babies who had sufficient sweat. We also determined that QNS ST did not localize to particular technicians. In November, 2011 and January 2012 we had site visits from Drs. S. McColley and V. LeGrys, who reviewed each step of our ST process. From November 2011, we began implementing small cycles of change that included use of warming blankets to swaddle during the collection; use of disposable stretch tape to secure both the stimulation gels and collection device to the infant's arm; discontinued the use of the inner thigh as a collection site; changed the position of the stimulating electrodes to the more distal volar forearm (near the wrist); and began collecting from each forearm on each patient.",

The lab team felt that those processes that had the most impact on collection was the use of disposable stretch tape to secure the stimulation gel and the collection device, the use of the forearm rather than the thigh, and the positioning of the electrode toward the wrist instead of the elbow. We are monitoring QNS rates to verify these initial improved results. This project was supported by a grant from the CF Foundation supporting the Illinois NBS QI Collaborative (MCCOLL11Q10). Medicaid (MAX) data contain comprehensive reimbursed health services claims but lack clinical parameters. CF Patient Registry (CFPR) collects clinical information but provides quarterly updates on selected health services such as drug exposure. Because CFPR only collects limited non-unique direct patient identifiers, linking to other data sources presents a methodological challenge. We present a method illustrating the use of deterministic patient-matching algorithm to link CFPR and MAX. MAX (at least 2-CF claims) and CFPR patients born between 01/01/1981 and 12/31/2006 were included. The following identifiers were examined for linking plausibility: date of birth, last four digits of social security number, zipcode, gender, date of sweat test, date of gene testing and date of hospital service by assessing the percentage of unique records in each dataset for each variable and percentage of uniqueness of various combination. Only variable combinations with a 99% level of uniqueness were considered for defining the deterministic rules; a total of nine linkage rules were established. We examined the linking performance of each rule as the proportion linked one-to-one to the registry and ascertained the validation parameters of these rules in the context of a selected gold standard (rule with the highest linkage performance) (see table) .",

Our protocol, though designed to reduce the rates of AKI in this population, has illuminated the problem and suggests that the incidence of AKI is higher than what is reported in the literature. Through increased screening with SCr, CF patients with AKI can be more readily identified, prevention of severe AKI can be avoided, and complications of AKI can be better managed. Studies are needed to find preventive strategies to reduce AKI, thereby decreasing morbidity, and to assess the cost-benefit ratio of such screening. CF carrier testing is nowadays offered to many couples, regardless of a negative CF family history. Such testing is not infrequently performed by sequencing all or most exons or by employing panels which include mutations of unclear clinical liability. Hence, carrier couples are occasionally detected where one or two partners carry a mutation whose potential for causing CF is unknown or unclear. It is virtually impossible to predict if their children carrying both the maternal and the paternal mutation will be affected by CF. Most of these children have intermediate or even negative borderline sweat chloride values at birth, and years of follow-up may be necessary to find out if they will develop clinical characteristics compatible with CF or a CFTR-related disorder.",

Parental understanding of CF disease can be difficult to predict, with only maternal level of education having a modest correlation with knowledge score. Similarly, clinical outcome can be difficult to predict, with above average parental understanding of CF disease not associated with improved clinical score at age six months. To improve upon these initial measures, we will utilize the knowledge assessment to address areas of improvement in CF education and the 10-point clinical score to track clinical outcomes. Future longitudinal studies will assess whether improving CF knowledge alters clinical outcomes. Illinois initiated newborn screening in 2008 using the IRT/DNA method. The Illinois Newborn Screening Program tracks a variety of metrics, including sweat test quantity not sufficient (QNS) rates. Due to consistently high QNS rates, a consortium of 15 programs in IL and MO that are responsible for provision of sweat testing and related care for babies born in IL was formed in August 2010. Our specific aim for this project was to reduce the proportion of QNS sweat tests to < 10% at all CF NBS follow-up programs.",

The need for quality improvement (QI) in sweat testing for newborn screening programs has been recognized. Quantity not sufficient (QNS) rates for sweat collection are a particularly vexing problem for newborn screening programs. A ten percent QNS rate has been established as a target for sweat testing in infants < 3 months of age. In the year preceding this QI project, our QNS rate for sweat tests in infants < 3 months of age was approximately 20%.

Ongoing review of patients to determine the best timing for testing in an individual patient is in progress. As we continue to track these data, identifying characteristics which may predict an individual patient's ability to provide an adequate sweat sample will allow for better utilization of the sweat chloride lab resources and less frustration for the families and patients. Novel approaches, such as center level analysis and risk adjustment, are necessary to overcome such biases. The impact of risk adjustment on such models, however, is not known.",

Introduction: Routine care is paramount for maintenance of health for patients with cystic fibrosis. As part of the CF Foundation's recommendations for maintenance of care, quarterly visits at an accredited CF center are recommended for all patients. Despite this recommendation, compliance with quarterly visits remains one of the lowest achieved recommended metrics tracked by the CF Foundation. In 2010, the national average for completion of quarterly visits (with 4 cultures and 2 PFTs) was 28.1% for patients \u2265 18 years of age. The Drexel Adult CF Center has traditionally achieved compliance with this metric significantly below the national average. In the year preceding this Quality Improvement Initiative, our center had 16.1% of eligible adults attain this goal. The purpose of this project was to utilize strategies developed as part of the AQI2 Program to increase patient adherence with this valuable metric.",

The Drexel Lead Team used brainstorming techniques and fishbone diagrams to identify perceived obstacles to adherence with routine clinic appointments. From this list, team voting was used to identify the most significant issues facing our patients. In conjunction with patient and family representatives, educational programs were developed to ascertain CF-specific knowledge bases of our patients in order to determine areas of deficiency to target educational programs.

We mapped our current process and assessed for challenges and barriers to our stated goals. Areas of specific concern included: a) multiple patient handoffs, b) inconsistent communication between care providers, c) poorly defined long term plan of care, and d) limited active patient and family participation. To address these varied concerns, we designed an admission Road Map; a standardized tool with key elements customized for each patient, resulting in an individualized admission plan. This allows for more consistent, efficient, and organized communication between various providers and the patient/family. To foster active family participation, personal goals and family centered rounds are stressed in the tool. Training on Road Map usage was given for the complete inpatient and outpatient teams, and after a trial it was implemented for all admissions.",

Next steps include the transition of this tool to an electronic medical record and continued assessments of overall patient care and satisfaction. This project is supported by a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Our pediatric CF center in Northern California cares for approximately 170 patients, one third of whom are primarily Spanish speaking. 12% of our patients and families are noncompliant with their quarterly clinic visits. In addition, 40% of our eligible patients comply with their yearly oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and 45% of our patients have a body mass index (BMI) of less than the 50th percentile. Our hypothesis is that these outcomes are in part a consequence of a lack of education and knowledge of cystic fibrosis. Our CF team created a CF patient binder which includes a \"CF Action Plan\" with the primary objective to enhance patient/family education and organization. Our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life for our patients and families. Secondary objectives include determining if the CF patient binder, Action Plan and appointment reminders will 1) improve clinic visit frequency; 2) improve adherence with OGTT; and 3) improve growth parameters as measured by BMI.",

Parent comments about transition all indicated a desire for involvement in the process. Pilot data showed deficiencies in our current transition process that will be targeted for improvement. Integration of parent readiness with ongoing patient readiness may result in more successful transition from the pediatric to adult CF care team. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are afflicted with this disease. Management of CF has improved significantly over the past several decades and life expectancy has been steadily increasing. CF is no longer a disease confined to the pediatric healthcare arena; 40 years ago, it was rare for a person with CF to live to adulthood, however today more than half of people with CF are over 18. Transitioning to adult care can be a challenge for patients with CF, the families that love them and the clinicians that treat them. Little is known about how best to effectively help people with CF transition from being \"pediatric patients\" to \"adult partners\" in the management of their disease. Understanding the nuances of transition is an important first step in promoting effective adult healthcare for persons with CF. The aim of this study was to learn and explore perspectives on this transition in healthcare from the point of view of adults with CF (primary participants; N=3) and key players in their lives (parents, pediatric providers and adult CF doctors).",

Introduction: Transition of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) to an adult program traditionally occurs between the ages of 18-21 years. It is optimal for patients to be well prepared for transition and taking control of CF care. There are times when pre-planning has not been ideal and patients and families are not \"ready\" for transition. There is also the reluctance of the physi-cian and staff to send the patient out into the world of adult care. This seemed to be the situation at the Baylor CF Center. Transition was slow to occur; many patients were close to or a few years over the age of 21 when transition occurred. Thus, there was a need for a more organized and consistent transition procedure. Barriers included a separate location, staff, and hospital for the adult program, and a large group of pediatricians who were not synchronized in their practices regarding transition.",

Some of these barriers include: lack of adult physicians with experience treating cystic fibrosis, an inability to form transition support groups due to infection control issues and insurance coverage. Barriers are also present within the family system: parents' fear of letting go of their child, feeling helpless, fear of role loss and reluctance to sever the ties with their pediatrician. While the issues mentioned above are only some of the barriers to transition it is evident that by addressing these and other issues over the timeline of a patient's experience with their pediatrician, from diagnosis to transition to adult care, the family will see transition as the necessary next step in their continuum of care, organized to suit the patient's individual needs and supported and bridged by the pediatric CF center team.",

The main barrier we have found to adherence with this protocol is patients' difficulty remembering to take the vitamin D, either every week or every two weeks depending on the season. One helpful intervention to improve adherence to this protocol has been to encourage patients and families to place reminders on their calendars at home or in their cell phones.",

Introduction: Nutrition in the preschool child with cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a critical issue in preserving long-term respiratory function. Despite frequent monitoring and extensive education, approximately half of 2 year olds remain less than the 50th percentile for weight. As part of the CF newborn screening quality improvement (QI) consortium, we are addressing barriers to improved infant nutrition and ultimately, improved lung function and life expectancy. To identify factors contributing to sub-optimal nutrition early in life, we surveyed all parents of children aged 2-6 years with CF attending the Washington University CF Center clinic. Our questions addressed food choice, mealtime behavior, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and food security to examine for potential contributors to growth delay.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) has a direct impact on lung function resulting in aerobic dysfunction and progressive limitation in physical activity. Exercise training has been shown to be efficacious in decreasing symptoms related to CF by improving cardiopulmonary fitness, enhancing sputum clearance, and decreasing breathlessness. Based on the importance of exercise for patients with CF, a QI project was initiated by the Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital CF Center for our nearly 300 adult patients to receive a graded exercise test (GXT) annually and at time of hospital discharge. As participants in the adult QI initiative (AQI2), we developed our program with the objective of launching a feasible assessment of exercise tolerance to prescribe an individualized exercise program and educate patients on the benefits of regular exercise. The gold standard for exercise testing is with measurement of peak VO 2 via expired gas analysis. The need for physician presence, cardiac monitoring and time constraints necessitated the use of a sub-maximal exercise test.",

Annual GXTs were scheduled to follow clinic appointments. Hospitalized patients were all tested within 24 hours of planned hospital discharge. For patients initially tested while inpatient, follow-up outpatient GXT were completed within 3 to 6 months to obtain follow-up data and to provide feedback following the initiation of a regular exercise program. Existing sub-maximal exercise tests were found to be too challenging for some patients. Our incremental treadmill test starts at a slower speed while increasing the speed during higher levels once maximal incline of our treadmill had been reached. The combination of these changes resulted in patients' ability to complete more stages with an approximate one metabolic equivalent (METS) increase per stage. Results of the exercise test were used to prescribe both continuous and interval aerobic exercise based on peak METS and RPE (rating of perceived exertion). These data, follow-up responses to initial 5 questions, CFQ-R pre-GXT and at 1 year follow-up, were then input into the patient's medical record and shared with staff members.",

This study provides some guidance in assessing the improvement in health outcomes that one may expect when a person chooses to stop working. Background: Financial sustainability is paramount to the success of any clinical research program. UHCMC has successfully developed an effective and strategic financial management system for the cystic fibrosis (CF) program. Four areas within the CF program were identified to streamline financial management and improve efficiencies: research billing, crossfunctional communications, contract negotiation, and the revenue cycle. The Center for Clinical Research and Technology (CCRT) at UHCMC has managed and implemented a system that provides continuity within the research billing practices of the CF program. Regulatory compliance with research billing practices is a core function to streamline processes and remains consistent with Health Care Finance Administration guidelines. These practices can also be applied across other disciplines within clinical research. By engaging the Institution's centralized research office, efficiencies in overall programmatic and administrative support to the research programs can be achieved. Through careful legal review, the CCRT executes research agreements that comply with sponsor, institutional and federal regulations and policies. The CF Operations Manager (CFOM) partners with the CCRT to ensure that a proper budget is developed, fiscal guidelines are followed, revenue is tracked and collected, and regulatory compliance with research subject billing policies are met by maintaining up-to-date information on regulations and associated codes.

Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, OH, USA Background: Standardized, evidence-based treatment algorithms for the management of acute and chronic illness eliminate unnecessary variation in care, improve compliance with evidence-based treatment guidelines, decrease medication errors, decrease costs, and readily identify patients who do not respond to therapy as expected. The CF Center at Akron Children's Hospital became interested in the criteria for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in 2004 as part of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Quality Improvement (QI) Initiative. Using the available medical literature on pulmonary exacerbations, our CF center developed a clinical Pulmonary Exacerbation Score (PES) designed to identify patients experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation that has been previously described. With the assistance of a previous QI grant, we further developed a standardized approach to treating pulmonary exacerbations and developed a comprehensive, evidence-based pulmonary exacerbation treatment (PExT) algorithm for mild (PES 5-7), moderate (PES 8-12) and severe (PES > 12) exacerbations. This algorithm includes both outpatient and inpatient components. Follow-up reassessment periods were also standardized as part of this algorithm and its implementation was associated with a dramatic reduction in variability of time to follow-up assessment.",

Furthermore, some of our CF providers have not adhered to the follow-up recommendations as strictly as others. Thus, although variation in time to follow-up was drastically reduced after PExT implementation, not all patients meet the recommended 1 to 2-3 week follow-up criteria. Our CF center is implementing a pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) clinic in our pediatric and adolescent patients to facilitate improved patient accessibility to clinic appointments, ensure real time data acquisition regarding resolution of PEx symptoms, and provide consistent care with one provider to standardize follow up and minimize variation in care. Having consistent providers (2-3) staff this clinic will minimize variation, allowing more consistent exacerbation care. Adherence to the recommendations from the PExT will be monitored weekly and be presented to the QI team.",

We will monitor individual patient's FEV1 measurements pre-and post-implementation of the PEx clinic. PES and PExT use and adherence to the treatment recommendations will be monitored weekly, with a goal of > 90% use by all providers. We will obtain information regarding exacerbation rate of our population, duration of antibiotic treatment, variation from recommended follow-up, and the percentage of patients with exacerbations that are seen in the PEx clinic and percentage of patients seen in other CF clinics. We will be adding these metrics to our current dashboard of metrics. Studies have shown that patient adherence to medication therapy is driven by their knowledge and understanding of treatment. The medication indication, administration, and outcome of therapy are essential facts for patients upon prescribing. Cystic fibrosis patients are a high risk population for poly-pharmacy and medication non-compliance. Although lung disease is the primary cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis, adequate nutrition is of great importance. Due to impaired pancreatic function, these patients are at high risk for malabsorption of fats and fat soluble vitamins. Therefore, supplementation of vitamins A-D-E-K is vital for growth and development in this population. We conducted a year long study at the Mountain State Cystic Fibrosis Center in which we evaluated the patients knowledge of their vitamin therapy prior to and post-education. Additionally, we measured the patient's vitamin levels pre-and post-education to assess compliance. The purpose of this study was to determine if patient education regarding their vitamin regimen directly impacted adherence.",

At this time, 23 patients completed the pre-test, and 108 patients (81%) completed both the pre-and post-test. We observed a significant increase in scores in both our patient and caregiver post-tests. More interestingly, this directly correlated with an increase in our patient's vitamin A, D, or E levels. Of the 108 patients that completed both pre-and post-tests, 54 had one or more sub-therapeutic vitamin level for vitamins A, D, or E. Of the 54 patients with sub-therapeutic levels, 38 had post-test labs obtained. One or more vitamin A, D, or E levels reached a therapeutic value after the post-test in 21 patients. The results showed a 55% increase of 1 or more vitamin levels from sub-therapeutic to therapeutic following education. Our study validates and supports the idea that informational interventions which educate patients about their condition will allow for the patients to have more control of their disease, and be more likely to comply. Background: CFRD is a common complication in adults with cystic fibrosis. CFRD is found in 35% of adults aged 20 to 29 and 43% for those over 30 years old. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, American Diabetes Association and the Pediatric Endocrine Society recently put together guidelines with recommendations that CF patients should be screened with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) once a year after age 10. A 2-hour OGTT is recommended to screen for CFRD. After reviewing our CF center data from 2011, we acknowledged a crucial need for increased vigilance with screening for CFRD.",

Our team then reviewed the patient and clinic barriers associated with this low rate of compliance with OGTT. These included convenience, time, and CF clinician compliance. Our clinic OGTT process was first reviewed and amended by our CF endocrinologist. In order to streamline the process and be more cost efficient and ensure patient compliance, we determined that our glucose load would be 2 cans of regular coke (or 81 grams of carbohydrate). A patient education form was developed, which included details and information on CFRD, as well as the importance of screening. An additional informational sheet was developed that outlined 2 options for obtaining an OGTT. These options included either using a local lab or physician's office near the patient's home versus having their OGTT done in our hospital lab, the previous standard for screening. Once our educational materials were ready, we sent out an email to our adult CF patients utilizing our electronic mailing list, which outlined our quality improvement (QI) initiative regarding the importance of CFRD screening with the informational sheets attached. We also put signs in each of our clinic rooms as a highly visible reminder to both patients and clinicians to discuss annual CFRD screening at each clinic visit.",

However, the open-ended questions revealed a high degree of patient frustration with limited suggestions for improvement. The discrepancy in the results may be related to the test design. Patients may have chosen a multiple choice answer which indicated satisfaction with the change in IC while taking the opportunity to express their feelings in the more subjective open ended questions. Nonetheless, these results are the basis for development and implementation of change ideas to improve the experience of patients with CF during their hospitalization. We plan to continue soliciting patient and family feedback as new ideas are tested. Methods: In 2011 we changed our CF center policy to recommend cholecalciferol (D3), either 1,000 or 2,000 units/day in addition to CF-specific vitamins for all patients.

This may be because patients do not adhere to prescribed recommendations or because this amount of vitamin D supplementation is inadequate. We came close to but did not meet our quality improvement goals. Based on our initial data we conclude that: 1) most patients need at least Step 1 supplementation with vitamin D3; 2) it is important to check 25-OH-vitamin D levels to assure the routine doses are adequate; and 3) it is important to re-check levels after dose escalation to assess whether or not further intervention is required. Finding out how patients and families experience the care provided by CF staff is important for improving the quality of services. In 2009, we developed a CF-specific patients' experience questionnaire from interviews with focus groups of patients and parents (1) .

Series of survey codes were assigned in such a manner as to identify a CF center. Within a center each patient/family was assigned a unique code to protect their privacy. Respondents accessed the survey using a web-site or calling a toll-free number and using voice recognition software. Center-specific reports were generated that showed their positive response ratings for each question compared to overall and also across center comparison for those that had more than 10 respondents. The reports were distributed to all participating centers and they were asked to complete a follow-up survey to collect feedback on the report format and usefulness.",

Background and Aim: The normal mucus layer coating the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is one of the first lines of innate host defense. However, in cystic fibrosis (CF), mucus obstruction always occurs in the distal small intestine, not in the colon, even though the colon has more goblet cells and a thicker mucus layer, which indicates that the HCO 3 secretion critical for mucus formation in the colon may not be limited to CFTR-dependent transport. Therefore, we hypothesize that both CFTR-dependent and -independent HCO 3 secretion can function similar to CFTR-dependent HCO 3 secretion in regulating mucus viscosity.",

Serum IRT levels were determined by the double-antibody radioimmunoassay technique in subjects with CF. To determine whether the risk of CFRD was associated with IRT, we used both longitudinal linear mixed models that simultaneously account for the limits of detection of the assay (values less than 3 ng/mL), and Cox proportional hazards regression. After natural log transformation of IRT and age to satisfy linear model assumptions, we estimated subject-specific IRT measurements at birth (intercept) and rate of decline, and used these as predictors of CFRD in a Cox proportional hazards model to account for the time-to-event nature of CFRD.",

Background/Objectives: Besides maldigestion, malabsorption and mucus accumulation cystic fibrosis patients also exhibit moderate intestinal inflammation, which etiology is still ill defined. Given the role of the CFTR in modulating pro-inflammatory responses in several tissues and its high expression in the intestinal epithelium, we hypothesize that CFTR dysfunction may play a role in the onset of intestinal inflammation. We carried out studies aimed at investigating the role of CFTR in intestinal inflammation using the human intestinal cell line Caco-2/15.",

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been proposed as a potential cause. Large doses of PERT have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy in individuals with and without CF. Increased intestinal permeability has also been reported with PERT, unrelated to the cause of pancreatic insufficiency (PI).

Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA Introduction: CF patients typically experience reduced growth; both body weight and height are low for age, resulting in lower BMI. Despite nutritional intervention (high-fat high-energy diets) to improve body composition and support growth, children and young adults with CF still have impaired growth and low adiposity. This suggests that simply increasing caloric/lipid intakes may not readily improve adiposity and BMI. The reasons for low rate of adipose tissue growth are not clear. The few existing studies in CF patients indicate adipose tissue energy imbalance via decreased lipid uptake and increased breakdown. Using CF mouse models, we previously showed that CF mice have low lipogenesis and adipose tissue lipid uptake contributing to retarded lean phenotype. Feeding CF mice highfat diet to overcome low lipogenesis rates did not result in weight gain indicating defect of lipid uptake and/or elevated lipid oxidation. The increased lipid breakdown in CF patients is likely driven by the reported elevated resting energy expenditure (REE) strongly associated with severe CF genotypes, i.e. F508del. In some studies, REE was elevated in spite of good nutritional status, normal lung function, and good athletic level indicating basic metabolic dysfunction in substrate utilization. Concomitant with elevated REE, studies reported elevated respiratory quotient (RQ) indicating shift in substrate utilization towards higher reliance on carbohydrates. We hypothesized that similar to CF patients, CF mice have elevated resting energy expenditure and substrate utilization contributing to the poor growth phenotype.",

The correlation between BMI, lung function and outcomes in CF patients is well documented. Many CF adults need to increase their energy intake significantly in order to achieve their BMI goal. Tube feedings (TF) are one way to accomplish this.

            "text": "We found that the moderately severe patient population had better GT outcomes. We believe that this is because TFs were initiated before advanced lung disease was irreversibly established. We recommend early education on use and benefits of enteral nutrition to help change the mind set of patients/families that GTs are a last resort. GT placement should be recommended and started at the earliest of point of intervention possible. Evidence-based care guidelines for TF in CF are needed. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The pancreas is universally involved in CF with progression to pancreatic insufficiency in most cases within the first few years of life. Pancreatic insufficiency correlates with the severity of lung disease and CF-related diabetes (CFRD), therefore preserving pancreatic function in CF may have an important impact on disease morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no treatments to prevent the pancreatic disease progression in CF. Gene therapy has the potential to cure CF, as it addresses the root cause of the disease, but gene transfer studies have not been done in humans with CF and other pancreatic diseases, because the current methods are ineffective and unsafe in rodent models. As CF mice do not develop pancreatic disease similar to humans, it is difficult to develop a gene transfer approach in this model. Pancreatic and airway histopathology and physiology are very similar between humans and pigs with CF, therefore the CF pig model creates an excellent opportunity for studying gene therapy in this model. Currently, gene therapy cannot be fully explored in the CF pig model because there are no studies showing the transduction efficiency of pig pancreas with gene transfer vectors. Using a novel and minimally invasive transumbilical catheterization technique, we delivered a vector with a known affinity to pancreas, adenoassociated virus 9 (AAV9) to deliver the green fluorescent protein (selfcomplementary (sc) AAV9-eGFP) or sham vehicle control to the artery that supplies major branches to the pancreas (celiac artery) of wild-type newborn pigs (n=10). We selected AAV9 as studies in other models have documented its remarkable ability to transduce a variety of organs. Three different doses were given (2.5 x 10 11 ,1.2 x 10 12 or 2.5 x 10 12 vector genomes (vg)/animal) and results were evaluated at two time points (30 and 90 days). The pancreatic eGFP expression was determined with immunofluorescence, and morphometry was performed using ImageJ. At 90 days, eGFP expression was dose dependently and stably expressed in the centroacinar cells, intercalated, and intralobular ducts, co-localizing with CFTR expression, as well as in small and large interlobular pancreatic ducts. Ten random pancreatic fields (20x magnification) were assessed per animal with an average eGFP transduction of 20% (2.5 x10 12 vg dose). The histopathological assessment of tissues showed normal architecture with no inflammatory response. These results show the successful transduction of pancreatic cells by AAV9sc-eGFP and offer a novel and minimally invasive method for gene delivery that has the potential to be translated to humans with CF. Future studies will evaluate the efficacy of this approach using a porcine CFTR vector in the newborn CF pig model. Introduction: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is commonly reported in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). Treatment of EPI with porcine-derived pancreatic enzyme products improves malabsorption signs and symptoms. The efficacy and safety of ZENPEP\u00ae (pancrelipase delayedrelease capsules) have been previously established in subjects with EPI and CF aged <7 years. 1 A capsule containing 3,000 USP lipase units was developed for infants and small children to provide a more age-and weightappropriate dosing option and reduce the need to divide contents of higherdose capsules.",

These findings demonstrate consistent improvement in individual growth percentiles. Promotion of normal growth has been associated with better pulmonary function and survival in CF subjects. 2 To the extent of the authors' knowledge, this is the first long-term study reported in this pediatric population. There is increasing evidence to suggest the presence of chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Some CF patients continue to have very severe gastrointestinal symptoms despite conventional CF treatment. In our centre, these patients are managed in a CF gastroenterology clinic, jointly with a paediatric gastroenterologist. A number have required GI endoscopy and biopsy. The aim of our study was to characterise these patients and determine whether endoscopy and biopsy changed their management. We reviewed all the patients seen in the CF gastroenterology clinic from 2004-2009, who had GI endoscopies performed. The GI symptoms these patients were experiencing included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, rectal bleeding, failure to thrive, loose stools and constipation. Twelve patients had GI endoscopies with mucosal biopsies performed. The median [Interquartile range (IQR)] age at referral to the CF gastroenterology clinic was 4[0.9-8]years. Their body mass index (BMI) was 15.2[13.7-15.5]. Twenty-five percent were homozygous delta F508. Two patients had previously had meconium ileus as neonates requiring surgical intervention. One other patient had needed abdominal surgery for intussusception. Ninety-two percent were pancreatic insufficient, 25% were chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 17% were on regularly 3 monthly intravenous antibiotics. Of the 10 patients who were able to perform spirometry, FEV1 was 101[67-125]% predicted. Nine of the 12 patients had evidence of mucosal inflammation in their biopsies, including duodenitis with eosinophilic infiltrate, chronic non-specific inactive gastritis, enteropathy with partial villous atrophy, and non-specific colitis. Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory therapies were commenced in these 9 patients, including prednisolone, azathioprine, methotrexate, ketotifen, mesalazine and sulphasalazine as well as the use of parenteral nutrition and elemental feeds. All the patients clinically responded to therapy. Five of the patients commenced on anti-inflammatory therapy had repeat biopsies 1-5 years following commencement of treatment and all showed histological improvement of the mucosal inflammation. GI endoscopy with mucosal biopsy has a significant role to play in the management of CF children with severe GI disease. In our study, it influenced the management in 75% of patients with severe GI symptoms. Furthermore, if GI mucosal inflammation is identified on biopsy, management with immunomodulatory agents may be clinically beneficial. is malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Approximately 90% of CF patients require additional supplementation of these vitamins. Furthermore, 81% of patients with CF may be vitamin D insufficient. CF patients often receive proton pump inhibitors (PPI) to facilitate absorption of enzymes in the intestinal tract as well as treatment of gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD). Recent studies have linked PPI therapy to an increased risk of fractures in healthy patients due to impaired calcium absorption; an important consideration given the high risk of osteoporosis (25%) and osteopenia (40%) in CF. This retrospective analysis investigated the association between PPI use and vitamin D level in CF.",

Introduction: Although current guidance suggests an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to diagnose CFRD, this uses glucose thresholds derived from a non-CF population to prevent micro-vascular complications. However, in CF, glucose handling is variable and a single OGTT based on these thresholds may be misleading. CGM has been validated for use in CF 1 , allows evaluation of a glycemic profile up to 120 hours, is a stronger predictor for the development of CFRD than OGTT 2 , and a glucose \u2265 7.8 mmol/L for \u2265 4.5% CGM time is associated with declining weight and lung function 3 .",

Additionally, the concurrent mapping of food and exercise diaries to CGM results is of educational benefit allowing the fine tuning of any adjustments of treatment. Introduction: In the normal population, blood sugar levels after an oral glucose load increase throughout the day 1 and it has been suggested that impaired glucose tolerance later in the day may be an early sign of diabetes: if current oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) diagnostic criteria were applied to patients tested in the afternoon, half of all cases of undiagnosed diabetes would be captured 2 . This is particularly important in CF, where glucose handling is known to be deficient, even in those without established CF-related diabetes (CFRD).

            "text": "Conclusions: This study demonstrates an increase in glucose intolerance as the day progresses in the CF population with a greater 30 minute glucose excursion in the afternoon and evening, attributed to a diminished pancreatic response to a glycemic stimulus. The clinical implications of this study are important for the diagnosis and management of CFRD, questioning whether an OGTT should be done later in the day to provide a more accurate screening method that allows for an earlier diagnosis of CFRD The pathogenesis of CFRD is complex and incompletely understood. Oxidative stress is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Redox imbalance to a more oxidizing state is the precursor of oxidative stress but also is a regulator of a variety of cell functions -the most relevant to diabetes being the effect on insulin secretion and glucose uptake. Since CF is a disease of oxidative stress, the goal of this study was to elucidate whether redox balance is altered with the development of CFRD. We hypothesized that measuring redox potentials (Eh) at baseline and following glucose challenge in CF subjects with varying degrees of glucose intolerance would uncover a biochemical phenotype that could directly contribute to the pathogenesis of CFRD. Blood was drawn for measurement of redox status of the major redox couple in blood, cysteine/cystine (Cys/CySS) and glucose before and 2hrs after ingestion of 75 gms of an oral glucose solution. Subjects were 16 to 40 years of age and consisted of 15 healthy controls (Con) with normal glucose tolerance (NGT); 11 CF with NGT; 16 CF with prediabetes (CFPD, defined as fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl and/or 2hr between 140 and 199 mg/dl); and 11 with CFRD (2hr glucose > 199 mg/dl with 1 subject also having fasting > 125 mg/dl). Statistical differences between the 4 groups were determined by ANOVA. At baseline, Con-NGT and CF-NGT had plasma redox status in the normal range (Eh Cys/CySS [x\u00b1SEM] = -86\u00b12.34 mV and -80\u00b14.17 mV respectively) whereas CFPD and CFRD showed significant redox imbalance to the oxidizing state (Eh Cys/CySS = -73\u00b13.62 mV and -71\u00b14.36 mV respectively, p<0.05, note that less negative = more oxidizing). This degree of imbalance is large. For example, redox status becomes more oxidizing in adults with aging at a rate of 1 mV per 5 years. Thus, these teens and young adults with CFPD and CFRD have the redox values of an octogenarian. At 2hrs after glucose challenge, CF-NGT had a marked acute redox imbalance to the oxidizing state, CFPD and CFRD had worsening redox imbalance, and Con-NGT redox status was unchanged. This resulted in CF-NGT, CFPD, and CFRD all having the same level of redox imbalance to the oxidizing state at 2hrs post glucose which was significantly different from control (2 hour Eh Cys/CySS: Con-NGT = -84\u00b12.59, CF-NGT= -63\u00b14.67, CFPD= -60\u00b14.22, CFRD= -63\u00b12.45, p<0.05). Finally, there was no correlation between the degree of hyperglycemia and the degree of redox imbalance. In summary, subjects with CF prediabetes or diabetes have severe systemic redox imbalance to the oxidizing state. Furthermore, glucose challenge in CF causes acute redox imbalance without necessarily causing hyperglycemia. Since the degree of redox imbalance seen is potentially severe enough to damage islet cells, we speculate this discovery needs further evaluation as a mechanism for the development of CFRD.

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is now recognized as the most common co-morbidity associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting more than 50% of patients over the age of 30. Despite profound morbidity and increased mortality associated with CFRD, little is known about the pathology of this disease, in part due to unavailability of CFRD animal models. Utilizing a murine model of CFRD, we explored our hypothesis that elevated airway glucose in CFRD is associated with reduced lung bacterial clearance.",

Many cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer postprandial glucose abnormalities including hyperglycemia and reactive hypoglycemia. The most important factors thought to contribute to these abnormalities include impaired first phase insulin secretion and maladaptive second phase insulin secretion. However, additional contributing factors may also include altered secretion of glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Impaired first phase insulin secretion and altered second phase insulin secretion are two features that the CF ferret models shares with human CF patients. Because there are no reports evaluating mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) in ferret, the first goal of this study was to establish MMTT procedures in juvenile wild-type ferrets and define normal baseline postprandial glucose and hormone secretion profiles for insulin, glucagon, GIP and GLP-1. Juvenile ferrets (5 -12 weeks) were fasted for 3 hrs prior to the MMTTs. The MMTT was initiated by feeding the animals a quantity of food normalized to a body surface area estimate (BSAE in cm 2 ) of each animal (body weight [g] x body length [cm])0.5. For unweaned kits, MMTTs utilized only liquid diet (Elecare). For weaned kits, a mixture of Elecare and canned food was used. Hormone and glucose profiles were measured at 15-30 minute intervals during the MMTT. In WT animals (N=5), postprandial glucose was well maintained within a 110-160 mg/dL range, with peaks in plasma insulin, GLP-1, and GIP by 30 minutes and a slow return to near baseline by 120 minutes. By contrast, changes in plasma glucagon levels were generally inversely correlated with changes in plasma insulin (i.e., glucagon levels decreased as insulin levels increased and vice versa). These postprandial hormone responses in the ferret are similar to those in humans. MMTT analysis of three sibling pairs of juvenile CF and non-CF ferrets (age 60-90 days of age) demonstrated a variety of abnormal glucose responses in CF animals. Although all CF animals demonstrated postprandial peak glucose >200 mg/dL, the kinetics of the rise and fall in blood glucose varied between animals. For example, two CF animals retained significantly elevated Gluc120min values (389+/-56 mg/dL, N=6 measurements on 2 animals) as compared to non-CF controls (134+/-9 mg/dL, N=9 measurements on 3 animals). By contrast, the third CF animal demonstrated postprandial Gluc120min values (128+/-36 mg/dL, N=3 measurements on 1 animal) not significantly different from normal. Despite these observed differences in MMTT profiles of CF animals, the average glucose profile for CF animals was significantly different from non-CF animals at all time points in the glucose curve. Additionally, AUC0-120min was also significantly (P<0.0001) higher for CF (37,281 +/-4520) as compared to non-CF (15,293 +/-1005) animals. These studies lay an important foundation for understanding postprandial alterations in islet and enteroinsular axis hormones responsible for abnormal glucose regulation in CF following feeding. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a common co-morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Pancreatic endocrine destruction and impaired insulin responses are features of CFRD. It remains unclear whether alterations in insulin secretion in CF are solely secondary to exocrine pancreatic damage or if they also involve islet-intrinsic defects. To address this question, we evaluated insulin secretion in newborn CF and non-CF ferrets and isolated islets. Newborn CF kits demonstrated significant abnormalities in the kinetics of insulin secretion, including impaired first phase insulin (IFPI) secretion (6-fold) and dramatically accentuated late phase insulin (~10-fold) in response to glucose and/or L-arginine challenge. Interestingly, in the nonfasted state, newborn CF kits demonstrated widely variant and elevated insulin, insulin/glucose, C-peptide, and C-peptide/glucose levels in comparison to controls. The molar ratio of plasma C-peptide/insulin was not significantly different between CF and non-CF animals, indicating that the elevated insulin levels in CF kits represents bona fide insulin hypersecretion. In non-CF nursing newborns, glucose and insulin levels were positively correlated (P<0.0468), but this was not the case in CF kits (P=0.7743), supporting the hypothesis that insulin secretion by the CF pancreas is not properly regulated. To evaluate whether components of this insulin dysregulation are intrinsic to the CF islet, we performed studies in isolated cultured neonatal CF and non-CF ferret islets. Interestingly, CF islets had a significantly higher (5.3-fold) percent insulin secretion at 2 mM glucose in comparison to non-CF controls. Hypersecretion of insulin by CF islets at low glucose was blocked by activation of K-ATP channels with 100 \u00b5M diazoxide, suggesting that CFTR defects in the \u03b2-cell inhibit K-ATP channels to potentiate insulin secretion in a glucose-independent manner. Similar to in vivo findings in nursing CF kits, the variance in values for percent insulin secretion by CF islets at low glucose was significantly greater than their non-CF controls (P<0.0001), suggesting dysregulated insulin secretion by the CF islet. Following stimulation with 30 mM glucose, non-CF islets demonstrated a significant induction in percent insulin secretion (5.1-fold), while the percent insulin secretion for CF islets was not significantly different at low and high glucose. These alterations were reflected in a 4-fold reduced insulin secretory index in response to glucose challenge for CF islets as compared to non-CF islets. These findings provide strong supports that islet-intrinsic CFTR defects alter glucose-responsive insulin secretion by the \u03b2-cell in CF. Full blown cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) occurs in about 40-50% of adults with CF, however, as many as 75% of CF patients exhibit some form of glucose intolerance. It is not known why only certain patients develop CFRD, even though the majority of patients are exocrine pancreatic insufficient, indicating that atrophy/fibrosis of the pancreas is not the only culprit. The CF mouse model does not exhibit pancreatic insufficiency; therefore, the CF mouse represents a good model to study insulin regulation by tissues in the CF context without pancreas atrophy.",

Glucose values (mg/dL) for males: WT 205.4 \u00b1 8.7, n = 10; \u2206F508 171.6 \u00b1 17.8, n = 5; R117H 170.8 \u00b1 12.7, n = 8, p = 0.034. For females: WT 182 \u00b1 7.8, n = 12; \u2206F508 127.7 \u00b1 14.6, n = 6, p = 0.002; R117H 170.8 \u00b1 12.7, n = 8, p = 0.04. In all cases, fasting glucose level was statistically lower in CF mice, except for \u2206F508 males where significance was not reached, but the same trend was observed. Lower glucose fasting values in CF mice could reflect a different size of glycogen pools since CF mice are smaller, and have less fat and muscle mass than WT. To further explore the role of muscle, if any, we extracted RNA from calf muscles of pristine 8-week-old \u2206F508 female mice and their WT littermates at rest (4 mice per group). cRNA was amplified and hybridized to Illumina's MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip. Out of the 10,890 genes considered present in skeletal muscle at rest, 678 were differentially expressed in CF vs. WT, 400 up-regulated and 278 down-regulated. Pathway Studio was used to find correlations between the differentially expressed genes and known diseases/perturbed states. Among the most prevalent ones were diabetes mellitus, fibrosis, inflammation, and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. NF-\u03baB has been shown to be involved in these processes leading to muscle-wasting and skeletal muscle insulin resistance, with the latter occurring even before there is \u03b2-cell failure. Nutrient supply through insulin/PI3K and muscle contraction through AMPK are the main signaling pathways regulating GLUT4 translocation in muscle. Several genes in both pathways (Insr, p110, Akt, AMPK\u03b3) have higher mRNA expression levels in CF skeletal muscle, which supposedly will lead to higher glucose utilization by muscle. Both pathways converge at the level of AS160, whose phosphorylation removes the \"brake\" of Rab proteins and allows the mobilization of GLUT4. An isoform of AS160, Tbc1d1, has decreased expression in CF skeletal muscle. At the moment, we do not know if this decrease in message, reflects a decrease in phosphorylation of AS160 and how this affects GLUT4 mobilization. Since the majority of the proteins involved in these pathways exert their action by changing their phosphorylated states, we are in the process of looking at global phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle of our CF mice at rest and during exercise. Our preliminary data indicates impairment of glucose utilization in skeletal muscle of CF mice in the absence of pancreatic insufficiency. Supported by NIH grant GM088823.",

MT Cystic Fibrosis Center, Billings, MT, USA There exists research related to the genetic mutations of cystic fibrosis that occur in the Hutterite population, but no research currently exists to explain the impact of quality of life that a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis has on this group of genetic isolates. Seven of the nine Hutterite families, representing 6 of the 8 affected colonies in Montana were interviewed and asked a series of questions to determine the impact of cystic fibrosis on their day to day life and, conversely, the perceived impact that being Hutterite has on their disease management. Eight out of eight medical professionals specializing in cystic fibrosis who respond to the needs of the Hutterite population in Montana were interviewed. Interview questions were designed to determine how medical professionals perceive Hutterite patients, the impact that being Hutterite has on cystic fibrosis care and the responsiveness of the medical community to this population's needs. The results indicated that both the Hutterites and the medical professionals perceive that medical care received is as good as the general population. Both groups acknowledged the negative impact that farm work has on cystic fibrosis management. The Hutterites perceive colony life as an overall benefit and their beliefs seem to limit stigmas commonly attached to cystic fibrosis. The medical professionals perceive colony life to more negatively impact care. This study was limited to Montanans who all share the same genetic mutation and no comparative quality of life study was performed on English Montanans diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Compartive interviews need to take place in other areas of the United States and Canada to more fully understand the risks and beneifts to disease management and quality of life that come with being Hutterite diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.",

Techniques such as motivational interviewing were researched for use by healthcare providers, but might also be relevant for parent-to-child or peer-to-peer interactions among \"adherence practitioners.\" Finally, research documented the occurrence of overadherence (e.g., ineffective precautions due to fear of P. aeruginosa exposure); this problem is of potential importance to \"adherence practitioners\" because overadherence consumes resources that might be better used in other ways.",

The diagnosis of a chronic illness has significant emotional impacts for both the patient and family. Many studies have focused on maladaptive coping techniques of people living with chronic illness. One of the primary roles of psychosocial professionals (social workers, child life therapists, psychologists) is to help patients and families identify and use a variety of coping strategies. Due to infection control issues in CF, children are not allowed to participate in activities like camps or support groups involving interpersonal contact. A literature review was conducted by the authors for alternative coping strategies that could be implemented. Bead programs are being widely used in other areas of chronic illness for pediatric patients, such as oncology and congenital heart defects (Beads of Courage\u00a9, Heart Beads, Bravery Beads). The bead programs have served as a coping strategy and narrative to the child's journey with their disease. Research has also described how parents' use of emotional support assisted in their adaptation to their child's CF.",

In recent years several new contraceptive methods have become available and patients seek sexual health information from a number of healthcare professionals.",

Of these, 132(88%) were pancreatic insufficient, 55(36%) had CFRD, 46% were colonised with Pseudomonas and 22(15%) post-lung transplantation. Ninety women (60%) were taking contraception, 28 (19%) did not require and 32 (21%) were not using any contraception (lower than the figure of 30-50% previously published). Reasons for not requiring contraception: 2 currently pregnant, 8 trying to conceive, 4 known conception problems, 7 no partner or were not heterosexual, and 7 post-menopausal. The most common method of contraception used in 90 women was the OCP (34%) followed by condoms (20%), depot (17%), implant (13%), coil (10%), tubal ligation (4%), hysterectomy (1%) and male vasectomy (1%). Thirteen different brands of COCP were used (12% on 20\u00b5g, 46% on 30\u00b5g and 42% on 35\u00b5g strength of ethinylestradiol. Women using the implant or depot were significantly younger (median age 21yrs and 23yrs) than those using OCP (26 yrs), coil (27yrs) and condoms (33 yrs). Fifty-three percent of women received contraceptive advice from their GP with only 19% from the CF team.",

The majority of women are making active contra-ceptive choices, however 1 in 5 are not using any contraception. Accurate documentation of contraceptive choice is thus an essential part of reproductive health counseling to highlight those at risk of an unplanned pregnancy. CF teams need training in the full range of modern contraceptive methods available. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is diagnosed at about two months of age at our center and causes difficulty in the early mother-child relationship and more generally in the family as a whole. Cystic fibrosis is a chronic progressive desease, still fatal to this day, and it creates an important feeling of loss in the parent's life. This could affect the style of attachment in the mother-child relationship, and it is hypothesized that it could affect the child's emotional and psychological growth characterictics.",

In the sample there is a prevalence of unsure attachment with the reference figure, and deficient strategies in affective information processing (A); cognitive information processing (C); or in cognitive or affective information processing (A/C) in a different primary relationship.

The CF team has reached out to our ethics consultation service and held individual sessions and multidisciplinary meetings with the patients and spouses to explore some key questions: how will the knowledge of a new diagnosis that includes male infertility impact the parent/child relationships? What is the appropriate age to discuss the issue of non-biological parents with children and how does this impact on the child's sense of identity? What impact will the \"secret-keeping\" have on the family dynamic? Providing appropriate, tailored support and guidance to the patients surrounding issues of disclosure of the CF diagnosis and infertility is an evolving and ongoing challenge. There has been growing recognition that some patients perceive positive life changes (\"posttraumatic growth\") as well as more debilitating ones in response to severe illness.

Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of concurrent Cftr-mediated HCO 3 secretion during mucus exocytosis/solubilization (Garcia MAS et al. J Clin Invest 119:2613-2622, 2009), but reports of Cftr expression in intestinal goblet cells are conflicting. Surprisingly little is known of goblet cell (GC) physiology, in particular, intracellular pH (pH i ) regulation in normal and CF epithelium. In these studies, the pH i of well-differentiated GCs and adjacent enterocytes was measured in the crypt epithelium of primary, 3D gel cultures from wildtype (WT) and CF murine intestine (enteroids). Enteroids are epithelial structures possessing a central cavity with regenerating crypts that faithfully recapitulate intestinal epithelium (Liu J et al.

Background: The paranasal sinuses are often colonized with lung pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia multivorans) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The paranasal sinuses may be a bacterial reservoir for initiation or maintenance of deleterious pulmonary infections. Whether sinus surgery has any impact on colonization/infection of the lower airways is controversial. Aim: Various clinical outcomes of extensive sinus surgery followed by two weeks of intravenous antibiotics and six months of local antibiotics by nasal rinsing were assessed. Materials: Danish CF patients with extensive sinus surgery performed during 2007-2011, n=106. Methods: Data were prospectively ascertained and observations before and after surgery was compared: Six months and one year pre-and postoperative frequencies of lower airway cultures positive for CF-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, lung function tests (FEV1 and FVC), BMI, and IgG serum antibodies to P. aeruginosa; questionnaires on symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (SNOT-22), questionnaires on general disease-specific health-related qualify of life (HRQOL), and finally surgical complications were assessed. Results: Sinus surgery and nasal irrigations accomplished reduction in frequencies of pulmonary cultures with CF-pathogenic bacteria irrespective of pre-operative pulmonary infection status (38% vs. 30%, p<0.01). Furthermore, sinus surgery and nasal irrigations decreased self reported symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (SNOT-22) observed 3 and 12 months postoperatively (score 20 vs. 11, p<0.01 and 20 vs. 14, p<0.01), and increased HRQOL observed 6 months (p<0.05) and twelve months (non-significant) post-operatively. No irreversibly surgical complications were seen. Sinus surgery had no effects on lung function, BMI or specific antibodies to P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: Combined extensive sinus surgery and post-operative antibiotic treatment reduce the frequency of pulmonary samples positive for CF-pathogenic bacteria six months and one year after surgery. In addition, we substantiate that sinus surgery relieves symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis in CF patients and improves quality of life. 292 PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA MODULATES THE PHOSPHORYLATION CHANGES OF SCAFFOLDING PROTEINS AND APICAL EXPRESSION OF CFTR IN AIRWAYS Tamanini, A. 1 ; Rubino, R. 2 ; Bezzerri, V. 1 ; Favia, M. 2 ; Facchini, M. 3 ; Paroni, M. 3 ; Dechecchi, M. 1 ; Tebon, M. 1 ; Iannucci, A. 5 ; Riederer, B. 4 ; Singh, A.K. 4 ; Seidler, U. 4 ; Bragonzi, A. 3 ; Cabrini, G. 1 ; Reshkin, S.J. 2 1.

Laboratory of Pathology, Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy Although therapies have augmented the life span of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, chronic infection and inflammation represent key pathogenetic events of lung damage and respiratory insufficiency. P. aeruginosa infections of the host airway cell have been shown to decrease apical expression of both wild-type (wt) and F508del CFTR (Swiatecka-Urban A. et al. 2002, Guerra L. et al. 2005, Kwon SH. et al. 2007). Recently, a factor secreted by P. aeruginosa called CFTR inhibitor factor (Cif) has been identified which has an inhibitory effect on a deubiquitinating enzyme (Bomberger J.M. et al. 2011).The host cell intracellular molecular mechanism(s) underlying this P. aeruginosa infection-dependent inhibition of CFTR membrane recycling could involve other pathways. Recent work has shown that the PDZ domain adaptor protein, NHERF1, finely regulates both wt and F508del CFTR membrane recycling through its association with the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of CFTR (Favia M. et al. 2010).",

Columbia University, New York, NY, USA Introduction: Studies on MRSA types among patients with CF have shown mixed genetic background in the U.S. [Gilkman D et al. 2008 and Muhlebach M et al. 2011.] Based on typing using the Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) the majority are SCCmec II, the type historically originating in hospitals. About 30% are SCCmec IV, historically seen in community based infections and most are the endemic strain USA300. Risk factors for SCCmec II MRSA in non-CF subjects include contact with the medical system, recent use of antibiotics, and indwelling lines. Aim: Patients with CF meet many to all of these risk factors but carry different MRSA SCCmec types. Here we evaluate subject characteristics and risk factors of MRSA acquisition based on SCCmec typing. Methods: STAR-CF is a prospective, observational study at 7 CF centers in the U.S.A. The MRSA isolates are obtained from routine clinical cultures and typed by PCR assessment for SCCmec type and PVL presence [Goodrich J et al. 2009]. Clinical information is obtained from the CF Patient Registry. Statistical analyses are performed in SAS. Results: Clinical information and MRSA isolates from 274 patients are included, of these 196 are SCCmec II, 45 SCCmec IV PVL+, and 35",

Cystic Fibrosis Centre, IRCCS G. Gaslini, Genoa, Italy; 2. Division of Infectious Diseases, San Martino University Hospital and University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous fungus found worldwide. Up to 50% of the cystic fibrosis (CF) population is colonized in lung by A. fumigatus. The detection of galactomannan (GM) performed in respiratory specimens is a new valuable test for the diagnosis of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), even in non-neutropenic high risk populations. CF patients rarely develop IPA, while a subset of them could develop various Aspergillus events (AE) such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergillomas and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). The aim of this study was to determine if CF patients with chronic Aspergillus colonization have different galactomannan levels in sputum compared to patients with intermittent or no Aspergillus colonization. Methods: Sputa from 42 CF adult patients in stable respiratory conditions were tested for the presence of GM between July 2011 and February 2012. All subjects were classified according to their respiratory culture status in the previous yr; (1) chronic colonization (CC): \u22652 positive cultures for A. fumigatus in a given yr, (2) intermittent colonization (IC): 1 positive culture for A. fumigatus in a given yr or a previous positive culture in the last 3 yrs, (3) never colonization (NC): no cultures positive for A. fumigatus. Baseline demographic, clinical and microbiological data were recorded and included at the time of sputum collection. The GM antigen test was performed by sandwich ELISA (Platelia TM Aspergillus, BIO-RAD-Marnes-La-Coquette, France) and the results were interpreted according to the manufacturer recommendations. The samples with an optical density index (ODI) >0.5 were considered positive. Results: The main results are shown in the",

Prior to the institution of infection control measures in 1995, new infections with BCC were primarily caused by epidemic clones of B. cenocepacia belonging to the RAPD 01, 02, 04 and 06 lineages. Following the introduction of infection control measures, the acquisition of epidemic clones of B. cenocepacia almost completely ceased; however, new infections with other BCC bacteria have continued. The majority of new infections after 1995 were identified as non-clonal isolates of B. multivorans indicating a shift in the epidemiology of BCC in CF, consistent with observations at other centres. Infection with BCC organisms other than B. cenocepacia or B. multivorans occurred at a low rate, with small numbers of B. vietnamiensis, B. stabilis, B. cepacia, BCC Taxon K, B. anthina, B. metallica as well as the non-BCC bacterium B. gladioli.

CF and PCD Center, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; 2. Pediatrics, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; 3. Radiology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel Background: Pulmonary disease in both CF and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused by impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) through different molecular mechanisms. Patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency (CF-PI) have malabsorption with worse nutritional status, are diagnosed earlier and have worse survival compared to patients with CF and pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS). Patients with PCD do not have gastrointestinal disease and malnutrition and therefore might have disease similar to CF-PS. Aim:To compare lung disease expression between patients with CF-PI, CF-PS and PCD. Patients and Methods: Patients (n=164) followed at Hadassah Medical Center were included: 88 with CF-PI, 42 with CF-PS (130 CF) and 34 with PCD. Clinical status, microbiology, FEV 1 and high resolution CT-total Brody Score (CT-TBS) were analyzed.",

Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; 2. Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA; 3. ICON Late Phase & Outcomes Research, San Francisco, CA, USA Background: Unsurprisingly, a high rate of decline in lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is a predictor of subsequent loss of lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Van-denBranden et al. (Pediatr Pulmonol 2012; 47:135-143) showed that variability around the FEV1 trend line in adolescence independently predicted subsequent drop in FEV1. Our objective was to assess several measures of FEV1 variability as predictors of lung function decline.",

Regional Adult CF Centre, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom Introduction: Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is prevalent in adults with CF and results from suboptimal bone mass accrual in childhood and premature bone loss in adult life. The pathophysiology of bone disease in CF is multifactorial. Low BMD leads to bone fragility, fractures, pain, increased disability and an accelerated decline in lung function. With improved survival early prevention strategies and interventions to reduce risk factors are important and may alter the natural course of CF related bone disease.",

Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Center, UAB, Birmingham, AL, USA CF airways are characterized by a persistent neutrophilc inflammatory response.Recently, our laboratory has described a novel neutrophil chemoattractant derived from collagen, proline-glycine-proline (PGP), as a critical regulator of this dysregulated inflammatory response. This peptide is generated by a discrete protease cascade; the terminal enzyme in the cascade, prolyl endopeptidase (PE), is expressed in neutrophils but it is unknown if lung structural cells express this enzyme. The purpose of this study was to examine expression of this enzyme in bronchial epithelial cells and to determine if cells expressing mutant F508del vs wildtype (WT) CFTR differentially express prolyl endopeptidase.Initially, lysates from mulitple cells lines (parental CFBE, Calu-3, 16-HBE) demonstrated variable PE expression by Western blot, RT-PCR, and PE activity assay. CFBE cells stably overexpressing WT or F508del also showed increased PE expression but F508del cells demonstrated increased expression compared to WT cells. Primary human airway epithelial (HBE) cells from F508del CF patients also demonstrated elevated active PE compared to primary HBE cells from non-lung disease controls with WT CFTR. Lysates from primary HBE cells co-incubated with collagen generated PGP, with increased PGP production observed with the F508del cells. The generation of PGP from primary HBE cells was inhibited by the addition of S-17092, a cell-permeant PE inhibitor.In conclusion, PE is expressed in airway epithelial cells. Cells expressing F508del have increased PE expression. Lysates from primary airway epithelial cells are capable of generating PGP from collagen and inhibiting PE blocks PGP production. These findings offer additional insights into unique mechanisms by which airway epithelial cells may contribute to ongoing neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease.Supported by NIH (HL 102371).",

Our central hypothesis is that antimicrobial activity of glandular secretions from CF subjects is less effective. We are using saliva as a surrogate for airway mucus because they share many antimicrobials and MUC5B, but whereas airway gland mucus samples are scant and rare, saliva can be easily, safely, and repeatedly collected in large volumes. Furthermore, prior studies detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in CF but not in non-CF saliva. PA/well).

The treatment differences for the Body, Emotion, and Digestive scales (2.7, 2.1, and 0.5 points, respectively) were better in the ivacaftor vs. placebo groups, although these differences were not statistically significant (P=0.0857, P=0.0956, P=0.7317, respectively). No other domains showed statistically significant treatment effects in ENVISION, except for Weight and Body Image scores through Week 48 on the CFQ-R Parent version. Conclusions: Both studies demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in respiratory symptoms that were rapid, durable, and of comparable magnitude.

A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) to time of death or lung transplantation adjusting for age, gender, genotype, pancreatic status, CF related diabetes (CFRD), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), body mass index, number of pulmonary exacerbations, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and chronic S. maltophilia infection (>2 positive cultures /yr).",

Pediatrics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA; 4. Clinical Microbiology, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA Background: Contaminated nebulizers are a potential source of infection of the respiratory tract of CF patients. Different methods, including steam-sterilization, have been proposed to disinfect home nebulizers but no single method is universally accepted. We hypothesized that baby-bottle steam sterilizers would be an effective and user-friendly method to disinfect home nebulizers. Methods: We inoculated three different home nebulizers (Pari LC Plus. eflow Rapid and Altera), at three different locations with the common CF respiratory pathogens methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300), Burkholderia cepaciae (ATCC 25416), Haemophilus influenzae (ATCC 25416),Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (ATCC 51331) and a non mucoid and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853 and clinical isolate). The nebulizers were then placed in either the AVENT (Philips) or the NUK Quick & Ready (Gerber) baby bottle steam sterilizer and the machines used with tap water per the manufacturer's instructions. The inoculated sites on each nebulizer were swabbed for bacterial growth after steam treatment. In a control set of experiments, inoculated nebulizers were placed in the machine for the same time period without turning the machine on and the nebulizers were reswabbed for bacterial growth. Steam treatment was tested with a wet drop of bacterial inoculum, dried inoculum, and inoculum mixed with de-identified discarded CF sputum samples. Results: The AVENT (Philips) and the NUK Quick & Ready (Gerber) steam sterilizers effectively disinfected home nebulizers. With an average inoculum of 4x10 5 -2x10 6 organisms, we did not recover viable bacteria of any strain under each of the conditions tested (Table 1). After increasing the inoculum of P.aeruginosa and S.aureus to 3x10 8 we still failed to recover viable bacteria after steam treatment. Conclusions: Steam treatment is an effective method to disinfect home nebulizers inoculated in vitro with common respiratory CF pathogens justifying future studies of patient nebulizers to confirm the value of steam sterlilization in the clinical setting.

Anti-Pseudomonas antibodies have been measured since 2008 using Pseudomonas-CF IgG antigen ELISA testing kit from Statens Serum Institut, Denmark. Clearance of Psa is defined as 3 consecutive negative cultures for Psa over a 6 month period (Leeds criteria). Results: During the 16 years that we have followed this eradication protocol at our clinic, 95 patients had \"first growth\" Psa cultures (i.e. all previous cultures were negative for Psa) and were treated with the described protocol. The mean age at first growth of Psa was 7 years of age (range 6 months to 16 years of age). The average number of patients with a first growth Psa was 7 per year (range 2-14 per year). Psa clearance success rate in this group of patients was 96%. At the time of first growth Psa, anti-Psa antibody levels were available in 16 first growth patients, 14 (87%) were antibody negative. All Psa were classic strains. Since the institution of this early eradication protocol, the percentage of CF children attending our clinic who are chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa has steadily declined from 44% in 1995 to 14% in 2011.",

Pediatric Pulmonary & Sleep Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA; 2. Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA; 3. Mycobacteria/Nocardia Laboratory, University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler, TX, USA Background: Previous studies have reported poorer clinical outcomes in adults with Mycobacterium abscessus (recently reclassified as M. abscessus subsp. abscessus) lung disease compared to those infected with M. mas-siliense (reclassified as M. abscessus subsp. massiliense). Whether this translates to the pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) population is unknown. Objective: To evaluate differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes in children with CF infected with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus versus subsp. massiliense. Methods: We retrospectively identified all CF patients less than 21 years old at our center with at least 2 positive sputum or bronchial cultures for M. abscessus complex during the years 2000-2011. We performed molecular identification of stored isolates to allow for comparisons of clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients with probable pulmonary infection with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and those with M. abscessus subsp. massiliense. Results: We identified 10 patients with at least 2 positive cultures for M. abscessus complex and clinical evidence of pulmonary infection for which isolates for molecular identification were available. Half of the patients were M. abscessus subsp. abscessus positive. Nine of the patients received antimycobacterial therapy. We found no significant differences in clinical characteristics or outcomes between patients infected with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus versus those with positive cultures for M. abscessus subsp. massiliense",

Discussion: Patients who are compliant with attendance at routine clinic appointments (surrogates being attendance at dietary visits and completion of routine PFTs and sputum cultures) have better knowledge of their disease. Unfortunately, this does not translate into better controlled disease as FEV1 or BMI are not affected. Targeting improvement of patient education and knowledge may help improve compliance of clinic attendance and adherence of routine screening evaluations. Our hope is that the knowledge survey can allow us to plan our educational goals for our teens and improve their self-management and success of transition of care.

The median (IQR) PERT dose used was 5173 (3198-6480) unit/kg/day. There was no difference between stool calprotectin levels among patients with PERT <5173 vs. >5173 unit/kg/day (median [IQR] = 92.2 [36.2-184.8] vs. 61.3 [43.9-121.2]; p=0.73). Among PI CF patients, there was no correlation between stool calprotectin levels and PERT dose (r= -0.08; p=0.68). Conclusion: PI CF patients have elevated stool calprotectin indicating intestinal inflammation. In contrast, PS CF patients have normal stool calprotectin levels. There was no association between PERT dose and intestinal inflammation. These findings suggest that PERT, given at recommended doses, is unlikely to be the primary cause of intestinal inflammation in CF. Intestinal inflammation in PI may reflect altered intestinal milieu due to severity of CFTR dysfunction.LOW SERUM LINOLEIC ACID (THE PRINCIPAL ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID) IS PREVALENT IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF LIFE AND EARLY ADOLESCENCE Lai, H.J. 1,2 ; Shoff, S.M. 1 ; Zhang, Z. 1 1. Nutritional Sciences, UW-Madison, Madison, WI, USA; 2. Pediatrics, UW-Madison, Madison, WI, USA Background: Many studies have demonstrated essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency, particularly low serum level of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6), and its negative impact on growth and pulmonary outcomes in patients with CF. However, it is unclear whether these findings apply to young children diagnosed through newborn screening followed by more aggressive nutritional care emphasized in recent years. In addition, little is known on EFA status in adolescents with CF. Methods: In the Wisconsin Routine CF NBS study which followed 152 children born during 1994-2010 in the Madison and Milwaukee Pediatric CF Centers, serum fatty acids were measured in the annual blood specimens (non-fasting) obtained as part of routine clinical care beginning in 2006. Of the 152 patients, a total of 356 fatty acid measurements were available from 136 (89.5%) patients ranging from age 1.5 months to 16.0 years [28 (21%), 37 (27%), 42 (31%), 17 (13%) and 12 (9%) patients had 1-5 yearly measurements, respectively]. Fatty acid levels were expressed as molar percentage of total fatty acids. Poor EFA status was defined by serum LA below 26% (Pediatr Res 1985;19:104) or triene/tetraene ratio above 0.02, 0.04 or 0.2 (JPGN 2008;47:635; AJCN;1969:32:2390). Of the 136 patients included in the study, 19 (14%) were pancreatic sufficient [PS, defined as having a PS mutation (JCF 2008;7:179) and not taking pancreatic enzymes], 27 (20%) had meconium ileus (MI) and 90 (66%) had no MI but were pancreatic insufficient (PI).",

            "text": "Introduction: Screening for CFRD with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is time consuming and often requires a separate laboratory appointment to complete. Given the busy schedules of adults, many patients are not able to complete the CFF recommendation for annual CFRD screening, which is reflected by the consistently low national rates. As a quality improvement project at our center, we examined the feasibility of a nurseinitiated OGGT protocol within the context of a routine clinic appointment.Methods: We developed an algorithm to incorporate non-fasting screening similar to those used in gestational diabetes into routine clinic appointments. We also validated the use of point-of-care (POC) glucose testing by comparing this with venous sampling drawn simultaneously and sent for standard testing. All adult patients without a diagnosis of CFRD were eligible for the In-Clinic OGTT protocol (IC-OGTT). Patients underwent POC glucose testing at presentation to clinic and ingested a 75g glucose solution under nursing supervision if the POC glucose level was below a pre-determined threshold. Following the completion of the clinic appointment, a timed venous blood draw was collected at 2-hours in conjunction with a repeat POC glucose to assess for variance in these two testing techniques. Patients were considered to be screen negative if 2-hour venous glucose was below 140, as per CFRD guideline values. Serum values of >140 were referred for formal laboratory testing.Results: We screened 5 patients for the IC-OGTT protocol, with all eligible patients meeting criteria to proceed with IC-OGTT. Baseline POC testing values were low (median 98\u00b114 mg/dL) and significantly below the pre-established cutoff suggesting glucose administration to be safe. Normal 2-hour serum glucose values were obtained in 4 of 5 patients using this technique. The mean POC testing values was significantly higher than simultaneously collected venous samples (median 113\u00b145 vs 71\u00b145 mg/mL for POC and venous respectively, p<0.05) and no POC value underestimated the venous sample value. Our data suggest that POC testing may overestimate the glucose values. The results suggest that In-Clinic OGTT testing is a safe and feasible screening method for CFRD in adults with CF. Imple-",

In general, patient satisfaction with home IV therapy was high, but modifications will be needed to improve health care and guide future practice. Results of the survey will lead to improvements in communication via early identification of a home care plan and easier access to outpatient assistance. It may be beneficial to increase the amount of instructions and discharge education to patients by providing individualized daily schedules for medication administration and ACT, as well as to assess each patient's need for outpatient support to develop improved communication. Background: Prior studies have found low rates of medication adherence. However, most of these studies have been conducted with small samples which limits the reliability of these estimates overall, by specific drug type and by patient subgroups.",

Medication possession ratios (MPR) for each drug were computed during a 12-month period for each patient. A composite MPR (CMPR) was calculated as the average of each pulmonary drug's MPR. If a demographic characteristic was significant in the CMPR, the association was examined by drug, except for colistin and aztreonam lysine, whose small sample sizes precluded subgroup analysis.Results: See table for the overall CMPR and individual drug MPRs. Colistin (n=166) and aztreonam lysine (n=65) MPRs were 42.4\u00b135.2 and 47.0\u00b131.4, respectively. Age was significantly associated with CMPR and all age groups had lower adherence relative to the 6-10 year olds; this association held for each drug. Women had lower CMPRs than men (p<.001). There were no gender differences for dornase alpha (p=.13) or hypertonic saline (p=.49); however women had significantly lower adherence to azithromycin than men (p<.001) with a similar trend for tobramycin (p=.06). As the number of prescribed pulmonary medications increased, so did the CMPR and each individual medication's MPRs.Conclusion: Overall rates of adherence to pulmonary medications were below 50%. Age differences found in other studies were replicated in this larger sample. Women had lower adherence than men, but only for antibiotic therapy. Our results contradict the common belief that adherence decreases with more prescribed medications and requires further evaluation. Effective strategies are need to support and improve CF medication adherence.Supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Eighteen care centers participate in iCARE. Percent Agreement and a Kappa statistic were used to determine agreement. A p>.05 for the Kappa statistic indicates poor agreement.Results: There was a median (IQR) of 17 (7,20) responses per care center. Eighty-seven percent or more of parents and teens reported the care team asked about adherence to pulmonary medicines, enzymes and airway clearance every visit (%Agreement between teen and parent=82-87%; Kappa=.17-.33, ps<.01). Few families reported discussing barriers to adherence at every visit (Teen=37%, Parent=29%; %Agreement=53%; Kappa=.21, p<.01) or receiving advice on how to remember to do treatments (Teen=38%, Parent=31%; %Agreement=54%; Kappa=.25, p<.01). Teens were more likely than parents to say they were taught something new about airway clearance (71% vs. 61%, p<.01) and nutrition (79% vs. 63%, p<.01). Although a similar proportion agreed that nutritional information was \"very helpful,\" (Teen=59%, Parent=72%; %Agreement=62%; Kappa=.25, p<.01), perceptions of airway clearance education was rated by parents more often as \"very helpful\" (Teen=67%, Parent=83%; %Agree-ment=62%; Kappa=.06, p=.15). Teens were less likely than parents to report they felt \"completely\" comfortable asking questions during a visit (Teen=56%, Parent=88%; %Agreement=55%; Kappa=.03, p=.23) or discussing treatment barriers (Teen=58%, Parent=73%; %Agreement=52%; Kappa=.05, p=.15). Adolescents (51%) and parents (69%) generally agreed that they were \"very satisfied\" with the help they received on following a treatment plan (%Agreement=61%; Kappa=.22, p<.01) and the majority rated their overall quality of care as \"excellent\" (Teen=71%, Parent=75%; %Agreement=71%; Kappa=.28, p<.01).Conclusion: Treatment adherence appears to be assessed at every visit, while barriers to adherence are addressed less often. Only half of teens and two thirds of parents were very satisfied with the adherence support they received. While teens were more likely to report that they received education, they found this information less helpful and were more uncomfortable talking with the care team than their parents. The vast majority reported Objective: To implement best practices for diagnosis and treatment of nutritional failure and lung inflammation in order to achieve better health care provider adherence to the Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Practice Guidelines.Methods: Best practice treatment plans for both nutrition and lower airway inflammation (LAI) were implemented on January 1, 2010. \"Best practices\" were based on CF Foundation guidelines, evidence-based medicine, as well as feedback from the local CF Family Advisory Board. Best practices were developed and agreed on by all members of the health care team at the CF center at the University of Iowa. Diagnoses for nutritional status and lung inflammation were based on objective criteria and each diagnosis was associated with specific best practices. The main outcome measure was if patients' medications/treatments were consistent with the agreed upon best practices for their diagnosis. Two tools were utilized to help increase adherence to best practices and were tracked as secondary outcome measures: (1) use of the correct diagnoses; and (2) if issues pertinent to the best practice plans were discussed in the \"Plan\" section of the clinic note. Health care provider adherence to utilizing diagnoses, treatment plans consistent with these best practices, and discussing this in the clinic note were measured by reviewing medical charts from July 2009 -June 2011. The proportion of clinic encounters consistent with the best practice plans was calculated and compared over quarterly time-points. Periodic feedback with provider-specific data was used to help increase adherence to best practices.Results: The proportion of clinic visits where the provider completely followed nutrition best practices increased from 60.11% to 79.19% (p=0.09), and LAI best practices increased from 65.62% to 85.36% (p=0.02), from baseline to 18 months post-intervention. The use of nutritional diagnosis and its discussion in the clinical plan increased from 14.86% to 65.17% and 63.14% to 91.93%, respectively. Similarly diagnosis of LAI and its discussion increased from 1.29% to 50.24% and 27.06% to 85.33%, respectively.Conclusion: Implementation of best practice plans for nutritional and pulmonary issues in CF resulted in more uniform care of CF patients. Having objective criteria for diagnoses and agreed-on treatment plans for each of those diagnoses allowed for monitoring and individual feedback. Increases in utilization of correct diagnoses and discussion of the best practice in the clinic note were associated with improvements in physician best practice adherence.Supported by a grant from the CF Foundation (STARNE09AI).",

In cystic fibrosis (CF), the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) is an important value in the management of CF. Treatment and disease management decisions are made as a result of these values. Individuals with CF do not know their FEV1 value between center visits or how it is impacted by exacerbation or airway clearance (ACT) activities.Objective: This study will provide FEV1 and exacerbation data to the individual on a daily basis. This information provides a foundation to make daily, self-management decisions on how to plan the course of the day in terms of stepping-up ACT and treatment needs.Method: This is an observational study performed over a 2 to 3 month time period between center visits. Forty-four patients were given a PIKO 6 spirometer as well as exacerbation score (based on the Akron Children's Hospital exacerbation score). The patients were instructed to perform and measure FEV1 daily as well as a self-assessment of exacerbation. These values were documented on their daily log. As a result, if the patient noted a decline in FEV1 or a rise in their exacerbation score, they would step-up their ACT activities. If their exacerbation score reached 3 on a 10 point scale, for more than 3 days or reached 5 on the 10 point scale, they were instructed to call the center and report their data. CFQ-R scores were obtained at first visit and then at the end of the study. A six question poststudy questionnaire was given at the end of the study.Results: The pre-and post-CFQ-R overall was: 73.34 pre-study, 72.01 post-study which does not appear to be a significant reduction in CFQ-R. The mean FEV1 pre-study was 2.39 L and post-study was 2.44 L. Minimal change was noted. The mean exacerbation score pre-study was 2.66 and post-study was 1.87 on a 10 point scale. This represents a 30% reduction in exacerbation score post study. When asked, \"I feel the SUBB study helped me to understand my disease better,\" 20 of the respondents \"agreed\" and 13 \"strongly agreed.\" When asked, \"I understand and I am able to identify CF pulmonary exacerbation better since I participated in the SUBB study,\" 19 of the 38 respondents \"agreed\" and 14 \"strongly agreed.\" When asked, \"The SUBB Study helped me to identify the times I needed to step-up my airway clearance activities,\" 16 \"agreed\" and 16 \"strongly agreed.\"Conclusion: Using home spirometry may help to identify early exacerbation in CF. Home spirometry and daily assessment of exacerbation helped patients to see directly the impact of pulmonary exacerbation in their lives. While the results were positive overall, further studies such as a blinded, multi-center study should be accomplished to further investigate results.*This study was a part of the CF Foundation AQI2 Program.

            "text": "Methods: Subjects with CF and PI participated in a 12-month doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled supplementation trial of LYX vs. placebo. Both supplements had similar calorie (303 or 456 kcal/d) and total fat content (11 or 18g fat/d) with the same 5:1 \u03c96: \u03c93 fat ratio, and no fat soluble vitamins except for \u03b1-tocopherol which was higher in LYX than placebo (4.8 and 1.6 mg/d, respectively). Serum vitA (retinol), vitE (\u03b1-tocopherol, \u03b3-tocopherol, \u03b1-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio), vitD (25OHD), vitK (undercarboxylated osteocalcin [%ucOC] and plasma proteins induced by vit K absence-factor II [PIVKA II]) levels were assessed at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Dietary and supplemental intakes of fat soluble vitamins were assessed by a 3 day weighed food record and DRIs were calculated as %RDA and %AI.Results: 70 subjects (30 females, mean 10.4\u00b12.9 years) completed the 12 month LXS (n=31) or placebo (n=39) trial. At baseline 8% were vitK deficient based on serum %ucOC >50%, 19% were deficient based on PIVKA II levels >2ng/mL. 4.5% were vitD deficient with serum levels <20ng/mL. No one was vitA deficient (<20 ng/dL). 17% had low \u03b1-tocopherol levels based on an \u03b1-tocopherol:cholesterol ratio <5.4 mg/g. Dietary (food) and supplemental (vitamin pills) intakes were respectively 186%+602% RDA for vitA, 50%+263% RDA for vitD, 124%+1661%RDA for vitE, 112%+1225% AI for vitK. Overall retinol levels increased significantly by 3 and 12 months after adjusting for dietary and supplemental intake of vitA and %ucOC decreased significantly at 12 months after adjusting for intake. No significant changes were evident in 25OHD, PIVKA II, vitE levels (not shown). When run separately by group these results were the same in LYX and placebo except for \u03b1-tocopherol which increased significantly at 3 months in LXS only (p=0.018).Conclusions: In children with CF and PI on a high fat nutritional intervention, vitA and vitK status improved after 12 months (both LYX and placebo), while vitD status remained unchanged. VitE status only improved in subjects receiving LYX. The improvements in vitA and K may be related to the intervention and to the placebo or possibly to improved adherence to CF care.Supported by NIDDK (R44DK060302), Clinical Translational Research Center (UL1RR024134), Nutrition Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.Significantly different than baseline *p\u22640.05, **p\u22640.01 GROWTH CHARTS DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS  OF LIFE IN BREASTFED AND FORMULA-FED INFANTS  WITH We recently reported that CF infants exclusively breastfed for longer than two months experienced reduced weight gain compared to those exclusively breastfed for a shorter duration or formula-fed (AJCN 2011;93:1038). It is unclear whether these differences remain if the 2006 WHO growth charts are used instead of the 2000 CDC growth charts. This is important to assess because the WHO reference population weighs more before six months of age, but less thereafter until age 2 compared to the CDC reference population, while the WHO reference population is taller than the CDC reference population through age 2 years. More importantly, the 2012 AAP policy endorses WHO growth charts for monitoring growth between 0-2 years and this recommendation may be adopted in the care of CF infants.",

            "text": "Methods: Growth of the study population examined in our previous report was re-evaluated using the WHO growth charts as the standard to calculate weight and length percentiles. Briefly, the study population included 103 children born during 1994-2006 and enrolled in the Wisconsin Routine CF Newborn Screening Study. Of the 103 infants, 24 had MI, 9 had pancreatic sufficiency (PS, defined as having at least one PS mutation and not taking pancreatic enzymes), and 70 had pancreatic insufficiency (PI) but not MI. The 70 PI infants were classified into 5 feeding groups: exclusively breastfed longer than 2 months (n=10), exclusively breastfed 1-1.9 mo (n=8), exclusively breastfed < 1 mo (n=16), exclusively fed formula containing standard caloric density of 20 kcal/oz (n=22), and exclusively fed formula with caloric density >22 kcal/oz for some duration during infancy (n=14).Results: Overall, length percentiles did not differ significantly with age during the first 2 years but WHO percentiles (42.9 \u00b1 30.3) were consistently lower than CDC percentiles (47.1 \u00b1 28.5), p < 0.0001. On the other hand, WHO weight percentiles were higher at birth (47.3 \u00b1 28.5), lower between 2-6 months of age (30.1 \u00b1 25.0), and higher between 9-24 months (53.5 \u00b1 25.7) compared to CDC percentiles (38.9 \u00b1 26.5, 35.9 \u00b1 25.9, and 37.8 \u00b1 26.8 at birth, 2-6, and 9-24 months, respectively), p < 0.0001. These trends were observed within each feeding group, and the magnitude of differences between WHO and CDC weight percentiles did not differ significantly among the 5 feeding groups, p=0.1. In other words, use of WHO instead of CDC growth standards shifted percentiles systematically and consistently for all feeding groups. Therefore, even though the percentile values changed using WHO instead of CDC standards, our previous observation that infants exclusively breastfed longer than 2 months had reduced weight gain compared to the other 4 feeding groups remained unchanged.Conclusions: In our study population, regardless of the use of WHO or CDC growth charts, CF infants exclusively breastfed longer than 2 months had reduced weight gain compared to those exclusively breastfed for a shorter duration or formula-fed. Nevertheless, use of WHO growth charts resulted in lower weight percentiles during the first 6 months and lower length percentiles throughout the first two years of life, which may affect treatment decisions for nutrition intervention. Background: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) increases during adolescence, a critical period for pubertal linear growth. Our previous analyses showed that about 40% of adolescents experienced impaired pubertal linear growth, i.e., delayed and/or attenuated peak height velocity (PHV). We hypothesize that impaired pubertal growth predisposes adolescents to a greater risk of developing CFRD by age 20 years.Methods: Data from the 1986-2008 CF Foundation Patient Registry were utilized. Patients born 1984-1987 (age 18-21 by 2008) with at least one height measurement per year were included in analyses (n=2372). Age and younger cohort (54.1 \u00b1 28.8 versus 44.5 \u00b1 29.0 in the older cohort, p=0.04). However, length-for-age was lower in the younger (39.4 \u00b1 27.2) compared to the older cohort (51.6 \u00b1 27.4), p=0.007. Results were similar when analyses were restricted to PI patients. More infants in the younger cohort were ever breastfed (78%) compared to the older cohort (53%, p=0.01). Exclusive breastfeeding duration in the younger cohort (2.6 months) was twice that in the older cohort (1.3 months), p=0.01. A greater percentage of children in the younger cohort received high calorie supplementation (78%) than in the older cohort (34%), p<0.0001. Age at start of supplementation did not differ between younger and older cohorts (5.5 versus 5.1 months, p=0.79). Ever breastfeeding and supplementation rates were similarly distributed among MI, PS and PI in both cohorts. Children in the younger cohort cumulatively visited their CF providers more often by 6 months (4.5 visits) and 24 months of age (13.7 visits), compared to 3.3 visits (p=0.001) and 10.2 visits (p<0.0001), respectively, in the older cohort.Conclusion: A greater focus on nutrition management in children with CF aged 0-24 months born after 2005 was confirmed by more frequent clinic visits and a greater prevalence of calorie supplementation. The impact of the shift in clinical practice on growth is less clear because of higher weightfor-length but lower length-for-age percentile in the younger cohort. Background: An impaired intestinal digestion capacity is one of the main factors responsible for malnutrition in CF. Currently no methods are available to acutely measure the digestion rate of protein and fat and the effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme preparations in CF.Methods: We developed a stable isotope method to quantify fat and protein digestion rate in healthy subjects (n=8) and patients with CF (n=19) requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. We tested this method in the CF group by examining the acute response in digestion rate to intake of pancreatic enzymes. Fat and protein digestion rate were measured during standardized continuous feeding during 6hr (via sip feeding every 20 min or feeding tube if present) of Ensure Plus (amount based on 1/3 of daily energy requirement of protein). We added to the nutrition the stable isotopes of 1,1,1-13C3-tripalmitin and 2,2-H2-palmitic acid to measure fat digestion rate (= ratio [1-13C] palmitic acid to [2,2-2H2]palmitic acid), and 15N-spirulina protein and 2H5-phenylalanine (PHE) to measure protein digestion rate (= ratio [15N]PHE to [2H5]PHE). Pancreatic enzyme (Creon\u00ae) intake in CF took place at 2h into feeding and the dose was based on the fat content of the meal (4000u/g fat intake). Blood sampling was done every 20 min until the end of the study. Tracer-tracee ratios of the stable isotopes were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Statistics was done using unpaired ttest and two-way ANOVA.Results: Compared to healthy subjects, protein and fat digestion rate during feeding were both reduced to 48% of normal in the CF group. After intake of the pancreatic enzymes, 100 min were needed before protein digestion rate reached its maximal value of 97% of normal. Protein digestion started to decrease again 160 min after enzyme intake. Intake of the pancreatic enzymes gradually increased fat digestion to 80% of normal at 4h after the enzyme intake. Stratification of the CF group in children (n=10, age: 14.9\u00b10.2y, FEV1:82\u00b11%pred) and adults (n=9, age:28.6\u00b10.8y, FEV1:64\u00b13%pred.) showed a comparable protein but lower fat digestion rate in CF children during feeding (34 vs. 63% resp., P<0.05). The increase in protein digestion rate after enzyme intake was not different between children and adults with CF. We observed for fat digestion rate a significant group (P<0.001) and time effect (P<0.01) but no interaction, indicating that the increase in fat digestion rate after pancreatic enzyme intake was compa-only 1 patient demonstrating high serum corrected calcium (2.76nmol/L) who was otherwise asymptomatic; levels corrected with reduction in associated calcium supplements.Conclusion: High-dose vitamin D supplementation given as cholecalciferol 50-100,000IU weekly is safe, well tolerated and effective in correcting low levels in adult CF patients. By our protocol adequate levels were achieved in 96% of the cohort and have been successfully maintained by the vast majority thereafter. Objectives: Delay in the gastric emptying rate (GER) in patients with CF can have important clinical consequences. However, GER assessment is problematic: previous studies have employed expensive scintigraphic techniques, which are unsuitable for routine use and have produced conflicting results because of the complexity and variability of meals used. We have assessed the use of a novel ultrasonographic technique to assess GER in subjects with CF and healthy controls with a 3.5-MHz abdominal transducer probe measuring gastric antral size 1 , using liquid and mixed meals.",

            "text": "Methods: After an overnight fast, 6 healthy controls (mean age 28 \u00b1 3 years, 50% male) and 19 non-diabetic CF subjects (mean age 27 \u00b1 6 years, 3 pancreatic sufficient, 84% male) consumed 113 mLs (made up to 200 mLs with water) of Polycal \u00ae , a liquid energy supplement and on a separate day, a standard mixed meal (75 g carbohydrate), within 10 minutes. Regular ultrasound measurements were made in the supine position for 2 hours. GER \u226563% at 90 minutes is considered normal.Results: Healthy controls had normal GER at 90 minutes for both types of meal, but compared to controls, there was a decrease in GER at 90 (p<0.001) and 120 minutes (p<0.0008) in CF subjects following both types of meal (see table) . Only 6 CF patients (2 pancreatic sufficient) had GER \u226563% at 90 minutes.Conclusions: This study shows that this novel bedside ultrasound technique provides a simple method of assessing GER in CF patients and confirms that those without known cystic-fibrosis related diabetes have delayed gastric emptying for both liquid and mixed meals. This investigation will aid the improved nutritional management of these patients Objectives: In normal subjects, plasma glucose levels (both fasting and after an oral glucose challenge) increase throughout the day 1 , and these changes are influenced by gastric emptying, which is in turn slowed by hyperglycemia 2 . Although increased glucose levels are common in CF patients without known CF related diabetes (CFRD), there have been no studies looking at the diurnal variation of gastric emptying and its interaction with blood glucose levels in this population. To study this further, using ultrasonography 3 we looked at the diurnal variation in gastric emptying rate (GER) in adult CF patients and correlated this with blood glucose levels.Method: Following a fast of at least 10 hours, 19 CF subjects (mean age 27 \u00b1 5 years) without known CFRD consumed a standard mixed meal at 0800, 1300 and 1800 hours, on the same day. GER was assessed with a 3.5-MHz abdominal transducer probe measuring gastric antral size, where a GER of \u226563% at 90 minutes is considered normal. Plasma glucose measurements were carried out at baseline, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following completion of each meal, and the area under the curve (AUC Glucose ) calculated for the 120 minute duration.Results: See table: GER at 90 minutes was reduced throughout the day. Following the morning meal, GER at 90 minutes and the AUC Glucose were inversely correlated (r=-0.47, p=0.04). The AUC Glucose increased in the evening but there was no correlation with the 90 minute GER.Conclusions: This study demonstrates altered gastric emptying in CF subjects. However, there does not appear to be a decrease in GER as the day progresses. The inverse relationship in the morning between glucose and GER suggests hyperglycaemia is related to a decreased GER. Further studies are needed to evaluate the causative and contributory factors for the diurnal variation in blood glucose. Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Vitamin D deficiency is associated with worse health outcomes in the general population including reduced bone mineral density, increased risk of diabetes, cancer and worse lung function. Vitamin D supplementation is standard practice in CF; however, the dose needed to normalize serum levels is unclear.",

Inclusion criteria included CF patients older than 18 years of age with vitamin D deficiency defined as serum 25OHD level <75 nmol/L. Exclusion criteria included individuals with a history of hypercalcemia, renal stones, psychiatric history, use of tanning beds/travel to sunny locations within the study period, transplantation, pregnancy or lactation. Participants received a daily dose of 5000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo in addition to their standard vitamin D supplementation for 12 weeks. Participants and study investigators were blinded to the treatment groups. The primary outcome measure was the change in mean serum 25OHD levels. Other variables collected were genotype, pancreatic status, age, gender, microbiology, body mass index (BMI), and lung function. Descriptive statistics were conducted for continuous variables (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) and proportions for categorical variables. Independent sample t-test or chi square test was used to test for differences as appropriate.Results: Interim results are reported. To date, 67 patients were randomized to the treatment arm (n=33) or placebo (n=34). Preliminary data analyses are available on 40 subjects (18 cholecalciferol, 22 placebo). Baseline demographics of the study population (n=40): mean age 34.4 \u00b1 1.4 yrs, were excluded. The difference in AMH remained significant (17.2 vs 30.7 pmol/L; P=0.02).Conclusions: Our results confirm that the mean AMH in women with CF is lower than that of healthy women, suggesting that reduced ovarian reserve may play a significant role in the fertility of women with CF. Future research is needed to determine how the ovarian reserve of women with CF changes over time, how it affects their reproductive success and if these findings apply to female CF carriers.Supported by a grant from Cystic Fibrosis Canada. Introduction: Although the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the recommended diagnostic test for diabetes, it is not physiological and in CF it has poor reproducibility. Non-glucose dietary constituents also influence insulin secretion, and although the metabolic responses to different types of meal have been well described in normal and diabetic subjects 1 , there have been no studies in CF. The purpose of this study was to compare the metabolic responses of a standardized validated mixed meal test (MMT) with the OGTT in CF subjects.",

Plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide were measured and the areas under the curve (AUC) calculated. First (1-Ph) and second (2-Ph) phase insulin responses (markers of \u03b2-cell function) were determined using the Stumvoll equations 2 .Results: See Table. AUC glucose in CF was higher after both OGTT (p=0.002) and MMT (p<0.0001), and the 1-Ph (p=0.02) and 2-Ph (p=0.04) responses were diminished, compared to the controls. Furthermore, the MMT 1-PH response was lower (p=0.03) in CF subjects compared to the OGTT. There was a significant correlation between the OGTT and MMT for AUC glucose (r=0.84; p<0.0001) and AUC insulin (r=0.47; p=0.02). Finally, in the CF subjects the 120-minute plasma glucose levels showed a strong correlation (r=0.53; p=0.005) between the MMT and OGTT.Conclusions: This study shows that a diminished first phase insulin response, an early marker of CFRD, occurs in adult CF patients without known diabetes. Furthermore, the mixed meal test, a more physiological representation of daily carbohydrate intake, correlates well with the OGTT and can be used to assess glucose handling in this at risk patient group. The clinical application of the mixed meal as a standard test for diagnostic purposes in those with CF deserves further investigation for the early assessment of \u03b2-cell function. Background: In normal individuals, the early insulin response to an oral glucose load is greatest early in the day 1 and contributes to the rapid glucose clearance seen in the morning. However, although CF patients without known CF-related diabetes (CFRD) have poor glucose handling, their pattern of insulin release in response to a glycemic stimulus throughout the day has not previously been studied. To look at this further, we compared the pancreatic \u03b2-cell response in CF patients without CFRD with a healthy control population to identical meals at different times in the day.",

Insulin and glucose levels were measured at 0,30,60,90 and 120 minutes for each test. The area under the curve for the early (first 30-minutes, AUC 30 ), the entire (120minutes, AUC 120 ) durations for glucose and insulin, and the mean time to reach a peak insulin level were calculated. In addition the first (1-Ph) and second (2-Ph) phases of insulin release (markers of \u03b2 cell function 3 ) were determined.Results: See Table ( mean \u00b1 SEM). CF subjects had a higher glucose AUC 30 and AUC 120 and lower insulin AUC 30 and AUC 120 than healthy controls. There was a more marked increase (p=0.02) in the time to peak insulin and decrease in insulin AUC 30 (p=0.002) in the afternoon and a decrease in the 1-Ph response through the day, compared to healthy controls. However, CF subjects showed an increased 1-Ph response in the afternoon (p=0.02) in keeping with a lower glucose AUC 30 and AUC 120 . The 2-Ph response was lower than in healthy controls in the morning (p=0.001) and evening (p=0.02).Conclusions: This study has demonstrated an increase in glucose intolerance and a longer time for insulin release to achieve glucostasis, as the day progresses. This has important clinical implications as this study shows the variability of pancreatic \u03b2-cell functioning through the day and introduces the concept of \"pancreatic fatigue\" in CF. This raises the question of whether dynamic testing for CFRD should be carried out later in the day, when the pancreatic endocrine function may be more vulnerable.

Lumbar and total body bone mineral densities (BMD) were examined using dual energy x ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR 4500 and LUNAR). Determinants of bone health and disease severity were collected including, but not limited to, mutations in the CFTR gene, FEV1, corticosteroid exposure, calcium and vitamin D intakes, level of physical activity, anthropometrics and serum and urine minerals and 25-OH-D. In addition, a thoracolumbar spine anteroposterior radiograph was done for each child.Results: To date, about 100 children have been recruited and data on 19 children from 1 center (Chicoutimi) are presented. The cohort was constituted of Caucasians, 63% of girls and 37% of boys, with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years old (mean 10 years). Mutation analysis revealed that 3 patients were homozygote \u2206F508, 9 patients were heterozygote \u2206F508 and 7 patients had different mutations. The majority of the children had a mild pulmonary disease (15/19), a normal weight and an insufficiency in vitamin D (14/19). Bone ages were concordant with chronological ages. The BMD Z scores were all normal except for one case; the mean was negative (-0.74) and values ranged from -2 to 1.2. BMD were corrected for height. Bone mineral apparent densities (BMAD) were calculated. No patients presented spine fractures on thoracolumbar spine radiographs, but 3 reported fractures of superior extremities.Conclusions: To date, we report a normal bone health status in this subsample of children with a mild CF. No fragility fractures were described. Future analysis will be done with the entire cohort to identify the best predictors of BMD in CF children.

Introduction and Purpose: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a growing complication in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, little is known about how CFRD affects peripheral nerves and their function related to gait parameters, sensation and balance. Deficits in gait and balance characteristics have been noted in Type 1 and 2 diabetes, and have been found to correlate with fall risk in these populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if adults with CFRD manifested any deficits in sensation, gait characteristics or balance abilities when compared to CF adults without CFRD.",

Comparisons between groups on all variables were performed via t-test, with p<0.05 considered significant.Results: There were no differences between groups in sensation or balance tests.

In gait analysis, the CFRD group had a significantly (p<0.05) slower gait velocity (1.18 m/sec vs. 1.43 m/sec), shorter step length (64 cm vs. 75 cm), and shorter stride length (128 cm vs. 155 cm) than the CF only group. All but 1 in the CFRD group had gait velocities below norms for age-related healthy populations.Conclusions: In our preliminary study, CFRD appears to decrease gait speed compared to adults with CF alone. This decrease in gait velocity is below norms for young adults without CF. Participants with CFRD altered their gait characteristics perhaps to compensate for peripheral nerve impairment. There were no detectable impairments of sensation or balance related to CFRD. CF disease or its treatment appears to impair vestibular function, regardless of CFRD status. This finding is consistent with other literature in CF and may be related to use of ototoxic antibiotic regimens.Clinical Implications: Adults with CFRD have changes in gait patterns that may increase their risk of falling. These changes are not detectable with testing of sensation. Gait velocity has been implicated in predicting overall health and mobility status for other populations and may be an important test for adults with CF as well. Adults with CF may have impaired vestibular function, which may further restrict their mobility and functional status. These deficits are targets for physical therapy intervention to maximize the health and function of adults with CF, particularly those with CFRD. Background: In children with cystic fibrosis (CF), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) typically develop from adolescence onwards and coincides with deteriorating lung function. We hypothesized that chronic hyperglycaemia is common even before the onset of IGT/CFRD and is associated with early reduction in lung function.",

            "text": "Methods: At a tertiary care CF clinic HbA1c was recorded annually in 70 (46 boys, 76% homozygous, 23% heterozygous for deltaF508 mutation) children between 2005 to 2010 along with age appropriate pulmonary function testing (n=41). OGTTs were performed annually from age 10yrs onwards according to national guidelines (n=35). Twelve children who developed impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes as defined by OGTTbased WHO criteria, or HbA1c>6.5 %, had their data censored at the time of ascertainment of those conditions. Chronic hyperglycaemia was defined as HbA1c >5.7% . Within-individual changes in HbA1c, or OGTT parameters (glucose and insulin), were related to changes in lung function parameters (FEF25-75, FEV1 and FVC, each expressed as percentage expected for age, sex and height) using mixed models with age and BMI z-score as covariates.Results: Mean age at first assessment was 6.9(1-15)yrs when mean(SD) FEV1 was 89(20)% predicted. Mean number of annual assessments was 2 (range 1-5). Prevalence of chronic hyperglycaemia increased with age from 22.4% in <5yrs, 41.2% at 5-10yrs, and 59.6% at >10yrs. Within-individual rises in HbA1c were associated with reductions in predicted FEF25-75 (a marker of small airway flow) (44% decline per 1% rise in HbA1c; p=0.002) Security benefits can result in adults with CF obtaining coverage and access to care and medication needed to treat CF. While the focus of CF research has been primarily aimed at disease and symptom management, reproductive health and sexuality are underreported. These issues are becoming increasingly important as our female patients are reaching child-bearing age. The objective of this study was to better elucidate women's health issues in CF. Women were recruited at their routine scheduled clinic visit at the Adult CF Center at the Keck Hospital of USC under an IRB-approved protocol. An anonymous survey was distributed to all women with CF. Data collected included patient demographics, age of menarche, menstruation cycles, regular women's health follow up with pap smears, performance of breast self-examinations, presence or absence of urinary incontinence and how CF affects quality of life. The survey was given to patients as they came to their quarterly visit. Thirteen of 76 (17%) female CF patients were given and 13/ 13 responded to the survey. Median age was 32 years (range 25 -40 years). Median age of menarche was 13 years (range 9-16 years). Eight of 13 (61%) reported normal menstruation. Four of 13 (31%) reported hemoptysis at the time of the menstrual cycle. The median age of sexual activity was 19.5 years, while only 10/13 (77%) reported having a pap smear in the last 2 years. Two of 13 (15%) reported performing monthly breast self-examinations. Seven of 13 (54%) reported occasionally performing breast self-examination. Nine of 13 (69%) reported urinary incontinence ranging from occasional to up to 5 or more years. With respect to sexuality, 5/13 (38%) viewed themselves as looking different from other women, with 2/13 (15%) not liking their physical appearance. Three of 13 (23%) stated that CF affected their desire of getting into a long-term relationship. Four of 13 (31%) perceived that men would not want to be involved in a relationship with them and similar numbers believed that CF made them less desirable. Women who did not have these perceptions tended to have a higher number of sexual partners. With better insight into reproductive health issues and sexuality, women with CF may receive better comprehensive care.Reference Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) have improved life expectancy compared to 2000 cohort data. With these improvements, women with CF are at risk for sexual and psychosocial health-related issues. While the focus of CF research has been primarily aimed at disease and symptom management, there are limited data on how women with CF understand and deal with their sexual and psychosocial health. Dealing with issues related to sexuality is becoming increasingly important as patients are reaching child-bearing age. The objective of the study is to better elucidate gynecological health issues in women with CF. Women were recruited at their routine scheduled clinic visit at the Adult CF Center at the Keck Hospital of USC under an IRBapproved protocol. An anonymous survey was distributed to all women with CF. Data collected included demographics, age of menarche, sexual activity, types of contraception, pregnancy, and sexual relationships. Survey was given to 13 of the 76 female CF patients as they presented for their quarterly visit. Thirteen of 13 responded to the survey. Median age was 32 years (range 25 -40 years). The median age of menarche was 13 years (range 9-16 years). The median time for initiation of sexual activity was 18 years. Although 13 respondents were in monogamous relationships at the time of the survey, the median number of sexual partners was 5 (1-24). Eleven of 13 (85%) women used some method of birth control method, with the majority 5/18 (38%) of women utilizing the withdrawal method as their primary mode of birth control. Unprotected sexual intercourse was reported in 8/12 women (66%). None of the women reported having had an abortion. Five of 13 (38%) had contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD). STDs documented were: herpes simplex virus (2), Chlamydia (2), human papilloma virus (5), and gonorrhea (1). Three of 13 or 23% admitted to experiencing sexual abuse and 3/13 (23%) physical abuse. Six of 13 (46%) admitted to experiencing emotional abuse in their lifetime. Three of 13 (23%) wanted to become pregnant in the future. Three of 13 (23) did not want to have a child in the future. In response to whether their health care provider answered questions about sexual health, 9/13 (69%) agreed that the provider did address their sex questions. Lastly, 9/13 (69%) of the women were comfortable discussing sex with the CF provider. With better insight into sexual and psychosocial health related issues, women with CF may receive better comprehensive care. Novel therapies in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have resulted in a significant improvement in life expectancy. Though the majority of CF patients now transition to adult care, CF remains a fatal disease. It is well documented that care for CF patients is challenging, as they suffer from complex medical and psychosocial issues. By virtue of their limited life expectancy, CF patients are often forced to consider end of life decisions at an age when most of their peers are planning for marriage, children and new careers. As a result, CF teams are challenged with not only providing medical care to prolong life, but also simultaneously addressing psychosocial care, complex symptom management and end of life planning. Our CF providers shared with us their challenges in trying to accomplish these goals, and felt that earlier involvement of palliative care (PC) would enhance their ability to care for their patients.",

In addition, PC teams assist in the development of realistic goals of care and facilitate advance care planning. Over the last several years, PC teams have increasingly become involved in the care of patients with chronic diseases such as heart failure and chronic lung disease, but integration of PC into the CF population remains minimal.Our CF providers initially consulted PC on inpatients whose life expectancy was days. Discussions with CF providers revealed that these consultations were \"too late to provide significant action.\" To address this challenge, we developed a model that incorporates the PC provider into the outpatient CF team. In addition, PC is now consulted for most all CF admissions, not just those with limited life expectancy.We will review our experience with this new clinical model that integrates PC upstream into the care of CF patients. We will discuss the frequency and severity of symptoms and common psychosocial barriers to optimal care. We will report the prevalence of advance care directive documentation before and after implementation of this new model and our experience with patients' willingness to discuss death and dying. Finally, we will present our innovative \"Cystic Fibrosis Goals of Care Form\" and how this dovetails into ongoing advance care directive and symptom management assessments.Care for CF patients will continue to become more complex as life expectancy increases. Previous studies on early integration of PC into chronic disease care has demonstrated improved symptom management, enhanced advance care planning and in some cases increased life expectancy. We hope to see similar clinical benefits as a result of this new model that integrates palliative care into the chronic care model for CF.",

Psychology, Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive disease affecting multiple organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal system. Pain is a significant, but under-studied complication of CF and may be related to disease progression, which can include chronic pulmonary infections and decreased lung function, and increased treatments, such as airway clearance and intravenous antibiotics. The relationship between pain and other outcome variables, such as emotional functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), is largely unknown in this population. The purpose of this study is to systematically assess pain in adolescents and young adults with CF and evaluate associations between pain, internalizing psychological symptoms, and HRQOL.Methods: The current study is part of an ongoing, NIH SBIR Phase II randomized, controlled trial being conducted at 6 CF centers. Participants complete a battery of measures during four consecutive clinic visits assessing pain, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and HRQOL. Participants also completed supplementary online pain diaries for the 6 days following each clinic visit. Diaries assessed pain intensity, location, duration, affective rating, and coping response.Results: Preliminary results were analyzed from the baseline visit (N=94). Mean age was 15.69 years (SD=2.91), 62% were female; 57% Caucasian, 16% Hispanic, and 9% African American. Mean FEV1% predicted of 79.89% (SD = 25.90) was in the mild range of severity. An average of 4.4 (out of 6 or 73.33%) of pain diaries were completed, with approximately 50% of participants completing all 6 diaries. At least one pain episode was reported by 34% of participants across the 6 days. Of those who experienced pain, mean intensity was 3.81 (out of 10 points). The most frequent location of pain was the stomach (66%), head/neck (50%), and chest (50%). Most frequently used coping mechanisms were: resting (72%) and taking medication (66%). Structural Equation Modeling evaluated the unique contributions of internalizing symptoms on pain and HRQOL. Pain intensity was regressed on age and disease severity (FEV1% predicted) to control for demographic characteristics. Next, internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) were included as independent, exogenous variables in the model. The final step included a latent, endogenous HRQOL variable, with indicators from the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), including Respiratory Symptoms, Treatment Burden, and Social Functioning. The final model fit the data, \u03c72 (32) = 16.14, p = .097 (RMSEA = .079, SRMR = .07). Results indicated that symptoms of depression and/or anxiety significantly predicted both reports of pain and HRQOL, after controlling for age and disease severity.Conclusions: These results indicate that pain is experienced quite commonly by adolescents and young adults with CF and illustrate the importance of measuring other factors that may affect pain perceptions, such as psychological distress. Analyses indicated that patients with more anxious and depressive symptoms reported more pain and worse HRQOL. Regular assessment of pain, psychological distress, and HRQOL is recommended.Funding provided by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Background: Adolescence and emerging adulthood are two of the most challenging phases of development, and include a shift toward greater independence and responsibility, and in those with cystic fibrosis (CF), new challenges related to the progression of the disease and decreases in treatment adherence. Infection control guidelines prohibit face-to-face contact and thus, most peer-to-peer support has been drastically reduced. The major aim of CFfone was to evaluate the benefits of an online peer support program for adolescents and young adults with CF on outcomes, such as knowledge of disease management, perceived social support, psychological wellbeing, and HRQOL. The aim of the current study was to examine the social networking (SN) behaviors of these participants prior to engaging in the CFfone intervention.Methods: This SBIR Phase II randomized, controlled trial is being conducted at 6 CF centers across the U.S. Before being randomized to either CFfone.com or a CF educational website, participants completed the following measures: 1) Knowledge of Disease Management (General Health, Lung Health, Nutrition, and Treatment), 2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; anxiety and depression), 3) Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R; Treatment Burden, Social Functioning, and Respiratory Symptoms), 4) Daily Pain Assessment Questionnaire for CF (DPAQ-CF), and 5) Social Networking Survey.Results: Baseline data on 100 patients with CF were collected; mean age of participants was 15.69 years (SD=2.91), 62% were female, 57% Caucasian, 16% Hispanic, and 9% African American. Mean FEV1% predicted was 79.89% (SD = 25.90) indicating mild disease severity. At baseline, 60% of participants used SN sites to communicate with friends; only 20% communicated online with others with CF. Surprisingly, only 20% of participants searched for CF-related resources on the internet -predominantly on cff.org. When viewing CF-related sites, 20% were looking for information about CF, 8% were looking for information about new treatments, 7% were interested in support, 6% were providing support, and 9% were trying to meet new people. Adolescents' knowledge scores on the KDM were highest on Lung Health (M=66.8; SD=20.1) and lowest on Nutrition (M=50.2%; SD=19.3), indicating significant gaps in knowledge. Preliminary results indicated that those who felt more supported by their CF friends had lower depressive (r = -.26, p = <.01) and anxious symptoms (r = -.19, p =.04), and higher Social Functioning scores (r = .22, p =.02). Importantly, those who had a personal cell phone at Baseline also reported higher Social Functioning scores on the CFQ-R (T = 2.3, p =.02).Conclusions: Social networking sites for adolescents and young adults with CF may be useful for increasing knowledge of disease management, increasing perceptions of social support and improving mental health and quality of life. Our next step will be a prospective evaluation of the effects of CFfone vs. an educational control condition on the outcomes described above.Funding Provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed through established CF list servs to assess team member perceived obstacles to end of life care. The tool was developed based on barriers to palliative care listed in the International Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Manual of Palliative Care 2nd Edition. Also included were potential obstacles from published articles on end of life or palliative care in CF and potential obstacles identified through experience of the author. 26 obstacles were included and consisted of those related primarily to the CF team, patient and family, and specific to CF.",

CF team members lack of communication skill to discuss endof-life issues 6.Patient-family disagreement about treatment options 7.Patient belief that prognosis is better than what they are told 8.Close relationships developed between teams and family members 9.CF team member lack of education in CF specific palliative and end-of-life care 10. Lack of comfort of CF teams to conduct difficult discussions or deliver bad news Conclusion: As new therapies emerge and excitement builds in the quest for a cure, it is essential to remember those who may not live to realize that dream. CF teams must endeavor to provide the highest quality care across the continuum, including end of life. Educational opportunities must be provided to CF teams that address general principles of palliative care as well as the most common obstacles to provision of palliative or end-of-life care in CF. Adherence to CF treatments is a significant public health problem, especially during adolescence when patients begin assuming responsibility for their health and this responsibility is shifted away from the parents. Poor adherence can have serious consequences, including increased morbidity and mortality, reduced quality of life, and greater health care costs.

            "text": "Methods: This is a retrospective study of adolescents with CF aged 12-21 years who were diagnosed at the time of an \"index\" clinical encounter with a depressive disorder by Children's Hospital Boston Psychiatry Consultation Service between 2009-2011. This group was matched to a group of nondepressed adolescents with CF on the basis of age, gender, and severity of lung disease at the time of an index clinical encounter. Data was collected for both groups for the 12 months prior to and 12 months following the respective index clinical encounter. The following variables were examined across both groups: FEV1, BMI, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, Vitamin D and HgbA1c values, respiratory colonization and CF-related complications. Analyses between health care variables and mental health outcomes included descriptive statistics and t-tests.Results: Among the group of 20 adolescents diagnosed with a depressive disorder, 12 (60%) were male and the mean age was 16.6 years (SD=2.5). Both the depressed and nondepressed group had moderate illness severity in the 12 months prior to and after their index encounter, with neither group showing a significant change in lung function over these two periods of time. Both groups had borderline underweight-healthy BMI. There was a significant decrease in BMI for the depressed group after diagnosis of depression (p<.01) that was not found in the nondepressed group. The depressed group also showed trends of increased frequency of exacerbations and elevated HgbA1c values post-index time that were not found in the non-depressed group. Both groups were described in terms of health care outcomes including: Vitamin D values, respiratory colonization and CFassociated complications, which did not demonstrate statistical significance.Conclusions: Adolescent CF patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder appear to have moderate illness severity, and demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in BMI following diagnosis, along with trends of increasing frequency of exacerbations and elevated HgbA1c values. As BMI is often used as a primary predictor of future decline in lung function, and exacerbation frequency is an important marker of disease severity, these findings highlight the negative impact depressive disorders have on critical health outcomes for this population and suggest depressive disorders as a potential target for clinical intervention. Future directions of study include larger sample groups, longer time frames, earlier identification of depressive disorders, and investigation of impact of other disorders such as anxiety on medical outcomes. Lastly, further study holds the promise of improving morbidity and mortality in the adolescent CF population through timely recognition and treatment of depressive disorders. Background: Research indicates that behavioral interventions are effective in improving adherence; however, training and support are needed to transport these interventions to medical settings. The degree to which interventions are implemented as intended, or \"treatment fidelity,\" can significantly enhance their effectiveness. Fidelity is unlikely to improve as a result of experience alone, but has been shown to increase with ongoing clinical supervision, in which a supervisor reviews each session and provides feedback. In the context of a problem-solving (PS) intervention for teens with CF (iCARE), the current study examined predictors of treatment fidelity over time, including number of PS sessions conducted, number of supervision sessions received, prior mental health training, and initial fidelity.",

Trained behavioral interventionists (BIs), including nurses, social workers, physicians, and other multidisciplinary team members, conduct PS sessions with adolescents and parents to identify adherence barriers and brainstorm solutions. The first session with each participant is video-taped and reviewed by a clinical supervisor, who provides ongoing supervision and feedback by phone. Taped sessions are rated for treatment fidelity by 3 trained raters on a scale of 0 to 35.Results: Preliminary results are reported on 235 sessions by 34 BIs (52% mental health (MH) professionals) at 13 CF centers. Across BIs, mean number of completed sessions was 30.52 (range: 2-94) and mean number of supervisions was 4.12 (range: 1-11). No statistically significant differences in initial fidelity scores (prior to any supervision) were found between MH (M= 21.53, SD= 4.49) and non-MH professionals (M= 19.12, SD= 4.75, t (26)= -1.37, p >.05). After supervision sessions were implemented, the strongest predictor of most recent fidelity score was number of supervision sessions received (\u03b2= .63, p< .01), followed by MH professional status (\u03b2= .43, p< .01). In contrast, number of PS sessions conducted was not related to fidelity (\u03b2= -.14, p>.05). Finally, initial fidelity score (prior to supervision) was not predictive of subsequent fidelity (\u03b2= .25, p>.05). The overall model explained 54% of variance in treatment fidelity (R= .73, R square= .54).Conclusions: Results indicated that phone supervision significantly improved interventionists' fidelity to the PS intervention; experience alone did not. Although MH professionals did not initially score higher on fidelity than those with less formal MH training (e.g., physicians), they were more responsive to supervision over time. In sum, clinical supervision was the strongest predictor of treatment fidelity, highlighting its effectiveness at supporting HCPs in implementing behavioral interventions in CF clinics.",

The healthcare provider (HCP) facilitated a PS session with the teen and parent. Short phrases and multiple examples were used to aid comprehension of PS steps. Other modifications included frequent praise for on-task behavior, guided questions, and modeling of PS techniques. Due to the adolescent's limited writing skills, the HCP documented the solutions generated during PS.Results: In Session 1 of PS, the adolescent problem-solved vitamin adherence (barrier: forgetting). Possible solutions included using a pill box for day of the week and computerized reminders. Unique barriers emerged, such as the adolescent's self-reported difficulty remembering the day of the week. He opted to reduce memory demands by taking two vitamins once a day, instead of one vitamin twice daily. Future sessions will: 1) utilize a colorful visual flow-chart depicting each PS step, and 2) allow the adolescent to draw pictures of each solution to maintain his engagement. Results of two upcoming PS sessions and the adolescent's success at implementing solutions are forthcoming.Conclusions: The high rates of ASDs indicate that PS should be adapted appropriately, with concomitant training of HCPs to implement modifications. Some features of ASDs may predict greater success of behavioral adherence interventions, including preference for routines and an absence of \"social desirability\" responding (e.g., exaggerating adherence behaviors). Further, teens with ASDs benefit from many of the same behavioral strategies as most adolescents, including labeled praise, immediate feedback, cell phone reminders, and modeling.

Common themes about teens' interests, needs and concerns will be provided, illustrated and discussed.Health care providers are often puzzled or frustrated by the fact that youth with cystic fibrosis and their families do not follow the treatment plan as completely as the healthcare team would like. Teens and their parents, on the other hand, may be frustrated when healthcare providers do not understand their \"whole lives\" -the additional demands placed on them, competing needs and priorities, beliefs about health and how they balance healthcare with other life events. These differing views can lead to a lack of trust on both sides and a stalemate in the treatment process, resulting in a major barrier to successful healthcare. The goal of this project was to reverse this negative cycle: to empower teens with cystic fibrosis to show healthcare providers about their lives and to help healthcare providers understand and appreciate the lives of participants. As providers better understand families and families feel more understood, trust and partnership will develop, enhancing the treatment process .The goals of this project were: 1) to learn from teens about their lives with cystic fibrosis and 2) to empower these teens in their own care. These goals were accomplished by loaning camcorders to teens with cystic fibrosis and asking them to \"teach your provider about your condition.\" Teens were encouraged to film family members, interests and activities, school and work, friends and social life, medications and treatments, views of healthcare and any other aspect of life they consider important in understanding them. Teens were also asked to use the camcorder to create a \"video diary,\" talking about their feelings and observations about events and relationships in their lives.Videotapes were then transcribed and are currently being analyzed qualitatively for themes. VIA is based in grounded theory which examines and structures data to build theoretical models rather than use data to test a predetermined hypothesis. We plan to identify primary themes related to adherence, relationship with the healthcare provider, outside interests and health beliefs.Video Intervention/Prevention Assessment, or VIA, is a well established technique, developed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Patients are given camcorders and are asked to videotape their day-to-day lives, with an emphasis on depicting how their illness affects their lives. From the analyzed data, health care providers and health professions students learn about the needs, interests, values and concerns of teens with cystic fibrosis as a group. More on the BCH VIA program can be found at http://www.viaproject.org/.This project was funded in part by the Herbert Bearman Foundation. The purpose of this study is to assess how aware children with cystic fibrosis (CF) ages 7 -20 are of the shortened life expectancy (SLE) associated with CF, as reported by their parents/caregivers. The study also explored the ways the children learned about the SLE in CF and the impact this awareness had on them. Finally, the study solicited recommendations and questions from parents/caregivers about how this topic should be handled. IRB restrictions precluded asking the children directly.",

            "text": "Background: Currently, only limited and outdated literature-written when CF patients died at a very young age-exists on the subject of pediatric patients' awareness of the SLE associated with CF. Existing studies on SLE in children focus on illnesses such as cancer, when death is imminent. These studies note that attempting to shield children from the truth can be harmful, preventing them from communicating with and confiding in those doing the shielding and leading to anxiety, isolation and a sense of loss of control. Understanding the topic of how best to discuss SLE and the impact this has on children can inform and improve the care we provide.Methods: Surveys containing 31 multiple choice and open-ended questions were given to interested parents/caregivers of children with CF between the ages of 7-21 at the University of Florida Pediatric Pulmonary Clinic. Due to the sensitive nature of this topic letters informing parents/caregivers that they would be approached about this study were sent to their homes, in advance of the study. In clinic, the social worker asked whether or not the parents would be interested in participating and, if so, asked them to sign a consent form. Parents/caregivers were then instructed to complete the survey and leave it in a designated box near the check-out desk. The box was emptied only every 3-4 weeks, so that it would not be possible to link families attending clinic on a given day with the surveys in the box.Interim Analyses: Interim (pilot) analyses were conducted with 19 surveys. The small sample size thus far allowed only descriptive analyses of the data. Twelve of the 19 respondents reported that their child was aware, two weren't sure and five said their child was unaware, of the SLE in CF. Average age when children became aware was 10.4. In six cases parents had informed the child about SLE. In four instances, physicians (n=3) or other members of the CF healthcare team (n=1) had discussed SLE with the child. When asked their preferences, all respondents felt that a parent should be involved in the process. Nine respondents preferred that a parent and team members be involved. Attitudes of children in response to learning about the SLE varied between neutral (n=6) and scared/sad (n=6). Current attitudes of these children varied between motivated to fight CF (n=8), neutral (n=2) and discouraged (n=1). Parents' beliefs and attitudes were often conveyed in the surveys. . Future Plans: Final analyses will be conducted in September 2012 and will include updated descriptive analyses, as well as correlations between sociodemographic variables and patients' attitudes related to SLE. Americans. However, little is known about the role of R/S beliefs in CF treatment adherence, nor about their potential interaction with parental depression. R/S coping, defined as, \"the search for significance, in ways related to the sacred\" has mixed health associations, although negative R/S coping (attributing CF to divine punishment, the work of the devil, or feeling abandoned by the divine or one's congregation) is usually related to poorer health outcomes. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) as a conceptual model, we hypothesize that R/S beliefs relate to adherence determinants (perceived treatment effectiveness, perceived norms, and self-efficacy) and that depression is related to both negative R/S coping and adherence determinants.",

            "text": "Methods: N=130 parents of children with CF aged 3 months to 13 years are being recruited from 2 centers (Cincinnati, OH and Birmingham, AL) to complete questionnaires based on TRA constructs and R/S constructs. Daily phone diaries are being used to obtain treatment adherence behavior.Results: Preliminary analysis is based on n=96 parents (67% female; n=130 anticipated by 7/1/12). Mean child age is 6.4 years (SD 4.2); 49% female. Mean adherence to airway clearance was 63\u00b124%. Body sanctification (the imbuing of one's body (or one's child's body) with sacred significance) was associated with adherence intentions for mothers and fathers (rho=0.192; p=0.065; n=93). Fathers who imbued their child's body with sacred significance had higher levels of perceived treatment effectiveness (rho=0.360, p=0.043, n=32). Almost half (47%) of parents reported depressive symptoms above cutoff for clinical significance; depression correlated inversely with motivation for treatment completion (rho=-0.28; p=0.008); body sanctification (rho=-0.0304, p=0.004) and positively with negative R/S coping (rho=0.520; p<0.01; n=87). Self-efficacy for completing airway clearance correlated with treatment intentions (rho=0.403, p<0.001), as did perceived behavioral norms (rho=0.309, p=0.003).Discussion: R/S beliefs relate to adherence determinants and adherence behaviors. The prevalence of depression in this sample is 6x the national average and depression is related to adherence determinants, body sanctification, negative R/S coping and adherence behavior. These findings extend the literature by incorporating important psychosocial factors into the understanding of adherence and have implications for clinical interventions. To the extent that depression relates to negative R/S coping, addressing either issue may function to decrease both. Future studies will explore integration of R/S issues into disease self-management and test potential R/S interventions to improve adherence. The financial stressors involved in cystic fibrosis (CF) medical care are widely recognized. However, current assessment is limited to anecdotal social worker assessments with limited data captured by the CFF registry. To better understand the economic difficulties that our families face, the Cystic Fibrosis Center of Chicago developed a financial survey. Our intent was to identify the major economic challenges so that priority could be given to the most pressing needs.Methods: We developed a nine question financial survey that was introduced to families upon check-in for routine office visits. While families were encouraged to complete the survey, it was not mandatory. Questions were selected to address insurance status and stability, to identify difficulties paying for healthcare, to determine gaps in healthcare coverage (i.e., services and medications), to assess awareness of assistance programs, and to evaluate desire for additional financial counseling. All surveys collected over the past 4.5 years were reviewed. While families completed multiple surveys over this time period, 106 (73% of a possible 146) represented the most recent survey and were included for analysis.Results: Results indicated that the majority of individuals had PPO insurance coverage followed by Medicaid. The majority did not anticipate a change in insurance over the upcoming 12 months. The ability to make all co-pays and pay for all CF services was surprisingly high (88%, 94% respectively). The majority of patients were aware of dornase alfa, tobramycin inhalation solution and Cystic Fibrosis Institute financial assistance programs. A minimal percentage of patients felt they required additional financial counseling. Of the families who identifed a not-covered service, most cited vitamins, followed by g-tube feedings, nutritional supplements and physical therapy.Discussion: The low rate of uninsured patients is consistent with the private practice patient population. The lack of difficulty with co-pays and payment of CF services may also be indicative of this population; however, it most likely reflects the high baseline level of attention given to our families' financial needs. The high percentage of patients who were aware of assistance programs coupled with the low rate of families who sought additional financial counseling is consistent with this theory. On several occasions utilization of this survey identified potential problems that were able to be proactively addressed. One limitation of this analysis was that data was not collected on 27% of our center population. This may be reflective of low utilization of the survey at off-site locations, patients whose health status interfered with routine office visits, and patients who were uninterested in completing the voluntary survey. Given the ease of administration, immediate benefit of information provided, and more global utility of this data analysis, regular utilization of the survey will be encouraged. Issue: Depression co-exists with chronic illness and decreases capacity for self-management and adherence to medical treatment recommendations. Guidelines recommend depression screening and advocacy for follow up treatment as a strategy to support self-management in chronic conditions. Our cystic fibrosis (CF) clinic did not have a formal process for screening adolescents with CF for depression.",

A valid measure that records adherence to medications and airway clearance in a young population would be a useful tool for both research and clinical practice. We developed, in collaboration with CF specialists from several centres, the Delay, Omission and Refusal Scale (DORS). We refined it in focus groups with caregivers and tested inter-rater reliability (0.91). The measure uses a parent completed checklist followed by a telephone interview to improve recall and data quality. DORS focuses on adherence behaviours rather than total amount of medication taken in order to obtain a more relevant account of adherence.Aims: To test if a high DORS score is associated with a history of adverse behaviours in children with CF.Methods: At baseline caregivers of children aged between 3 to 13 years with a diagnosis of CF were asked about their child's mental health history and if they had ever been referred for clinical support with \"CF related adverse behaviours.\" At a second time point parents completed the DORS. They recorded episodes of delay, omission and refusal of airway clearance, oral and inhaled medications on a checklist for two weeks. A telephone call at the end of the two weeks collated and expanded on each event to improve data quality. The raw data were converted into a 7 point scale, where 0 = total adherence, 2 = delays occurred due to child refusal, 3 = at least one dose was missed and delays from child refusal, 6 = total refusal to a prescribed medication, and 7 = total refusal to all prescribed medication.Analysis: Children were grouped according to the presence or absence of a history of CF related adverse behaviours and Mann Whitney U-tests were conducted to compare median DORS scores, significance at 0.05 level. Odds ratios are calculated to determine the effect size of the relationship.Results: In all, 113 caregivers reported their child's mental health status at baseline, of those 43 were followed up at the second time point and completed DORS. Fifteen of 43 children were identified as having CF related adverse behaviours. These children had significantly higher median DORS score (4.0) than children with no history (0) (z = -3.53, df = 42, p < 0.001). Odds ratios (OR) show that children were 6.8 (95% CI,1.7-28.1) times more likely to have a history of CF related adverse behaviours when they scored 3 or more on the DORS scale. The OR increased to 16.3 (95% CI: 2.97, 88.9) when they scored 2 or more on the DORS scale.Conclusions: Children with a DORS score greater than 2 are significantly more likely to have previous CF related adverse behaviours reported by their parents/caregivers. These results further strengthen the validity of this tool as a measure of adherence in children with CF.",

Among women with CF, the issue of family planning and sexual reproduction is becoming a more salient issue. According to the CFF (2011) the rate of pregnancies among women with CF continues to rise annually. A better understanding of the salient factors can inform and enhance interventions and approaches that clinical care teams provide for women with CF. This and future work can influence CF centers' policies and procedures in regards to pregnancy among women with CF.Objective: Based upon the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this qualitative study will examine a variety of behavioral influences to identify what factors influence pregnancy intention among women with CF.Methods: Nonprobability, purposive sampling of women with CF who attend an accredited CF center in the Midwest region of the United States will occur. Semi-structured elicitation interviews will be conducted with individual females with CF who are 18 and older using an interview guide based upon the TPB constructs. A purposive sample size will be determined by data saturation. Six in-depth semi-structured interviews will be initially recorded, transcribed, and themes will be coded. Thereafter, further interviews will be collected, with transcription and coding after each interview until saturation occurs or 12 interviews are collected, whichever occurs first. Transcripts will be content analyzed to identify the constructs that contribute to the pregnancy intention of women with CF. Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) occurs in approximately 10% of the general population; patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be more at risk for RLS due to low iron and other aspects of the disease.

In addition, patients completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).

ESS scores were elevated (ESS score > 10) in 4 out of 33 participants (12%), which is consistent with a prevalence of 10-20% found in the general population.

Pediatrics, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Background: Chronic lung infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Although effective respiratory treatments exist to prevent and treat lung infections, adherence to these treatments is suboptimal with estimates at 49%. Examination of barriers to adherence has identified child oppositional behavior as playing a key role. However, to date, no studies directly observing parent-child interactions while children are performing respiratory treatments have been conducted. The objective of this study was to examine parent and child behavior during individual respiratory treatments in their home environment to determine what factors lead to improved adherence. It was expected that parents who provide specific directions and a positive atmosphere during respiratory Patients were monitored by measuring pulse, oxygen saturation, FLACC score for pain and anxiety, questionnaires evaluating response of parents.Results: Preliminary results to date are available for 6 patients (2 females, 4 males). Paired comparison of parental response indicated a significantly more pleasant experience with the Snoezlen environment compared to without (p=0.04). Parents had a lower mean score out of 5 for perception of a traumatic experience (2.67) compared to untreated (4.67) (p=0.04).

This research is on-going.Supported by a grant from Beit Issie Shapira. . Elevated levels of depression and anxiety have previously been associated with declining respiratory function, lower quality of life, and reduced therapeutic regimen adherence in patients with CF. Our objective is to report on a pilot study assessing the feasibility of a mental health screening program initiated within the CF center at Children's Hospital Boston. Two critical components of this study include: (a) suicide screening, and (b) providing mental health referrals and assessing participant ability to engage in outpatient (OP) referrals to mental health treatment.Methods: Participants (n = 36) were consecutively admitted patients (8 years and older) receiving inpatient medical care at Children's Hospital Boston from November 2011 -April 2012. Patients in the age group of 8 -17 years (n = 18) were administered the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). Adult participants (n = 18) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; a depression diagnostic measure), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Patients reporting suicidal ideation or intent on either the CDI or PHQ-9 underwent immediate risk assessment by the study principal investigator. Participants were also assessed at a post-discharge appointment or via telephone to determine if mental health treatment (i.e. outpatient psychotherapy/pharmacology, or other advanced level of care) was accessible and initiated after screening.Results: Participants were 52.8% female (19/36), had a mean age of 19.3 years (SD = 7.6; range of 8 -47) and were almost all Caucasian. Patients who underwent screening represent 52.2% (36/69) of the total patients approached for participation: 12 declined, 15 were missed during their admissions, 3 were of acute status, and 3 could not provide parental consent. In addition, 3 were excluded due to a documented developmental delay. Child participants reported a mean CDI score of 8.0 (SD = 6.2) out of a possible 27, with 4 patients reporting suicidal ideation (\"I think about killing myself but I would not do it\"). This constitutes 11% of the total screened population. Children reported a mean MASC score of 42.7 (SD = 16.1), and six participants reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms, having a t-score of 65 or above on the MASC total score or one of the subscales. The mean PHQ-9 summed score for adults was 3.7 (SD = 2.6) out of a possible 27. The mean anxiety score reported by adults on the BAI was 8.4 (SD = 7.7) out of a possible 61, with a clinically significant score of 36. Of those screened, 4 patients were given referrals for OP providers based on their mental health screening scores. In addition, 11 patients had previously received referrals as part of their care. Further analysis will compare mental health screening results with patients' BMI z-scores, FEV1 results, and psychiatric history to assess feasibility of obtaining follow-up mental health care within the context of patients' health-related outcomes.

Psychology, Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA Objective: Social support from peers with the same chronic illness has been shown to have significant positive psychological and health benefits for the adolescent patients. However, teens with cystic fibrosis (CF) have limited opportunities for face-to-face support because of infection control guidelines. The current study evaluated peer support obtained via CFfone, an online social networking community, in terms of activities and supportive exchanges among participants over a 2 week period.Methods: Participants were website users ranging in age from 11 to 18 years (n=50, 64.7% females). One hundred threads posted on the website in August 2011 were coded with ATLAS.ti. The following themes were examined: 1) types of social support provision (emotional support, informational support, instrumental support, companionship support), 2) types of support requested (same as above), and 3) topic being discussed (CF-related vs. general, non-CF related) during supportive exchange. Use of other website features (private messaging, reminders, educational articles, and Ask Kate) were also examined.Results: Preliminary results indicated that companionship support (e.g. sense of belonging) was the most frequent type of support both provided and requested on the website, followed by emotional support. Companionship support was provided and received most frequently in relation to non-CF topics, whereas emotional support was provided and received primarily in relation to CF topics. The three most frequently discussed topics were: 1) greetings (e.g. hello, goodnight), 2) health (e.g. coughing), and 3) leisure activities (e.g. drawing, shopping). Results indicated that more website users engaged in posting comments on their own and other users' walls (about 54% of users; mean number of comments posted per user = 14.74, SD= 18.29) than utilizing the other website features; private messaging (26% of users; M=8, SD= 7.43), reminders (14% of users; M= 17.57, SD=10.78), and reading educational articles (6% of users; M=1, SD=0). The \"Ask Kate\" feature, which allows users to see frequently asked questions and its responses, was the least used feature of CFfone (0% of users).Conclusions: Findings suggested that CFfone may be a promising intervention for exchanging peer-to-peer support. Adolescents appeared to like and use the posting features more than the educational ones. Future analyses will document the changing patterns of communication on CFfone, over an academic year and as new users join the online community. provide an open forum that offers adult patients the opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns in discussion with other adults with cystic fibrosis. At our center, representatives from the CF care team are present to assist in facilitating the discussion as well as to clarify information. In the support group, patients discuss how CF affects their lives and share their personal experiences. For some patients, this may be their first opportunity to have a face-to-face discussion with another adult with CF. We postulated that this opportunity to talk with other patients may improve individual confidence and level of comfort in communicating with the CF care team. Thus, we sought to evaluate whether participation in adult CF support group improves patient perception of patientcare provider communication and rapport.Methods: We surveyed current participants in the support group for adult CF patients at our center. For comparison, we also surveyed patients from our adult CF program who did not participate in the support group. In the survey, we presented 10 statements related to various aspects of patient comfort regarding communication with others regarding their disease. All patients were asked to respond on an ordinal scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The statements queried were the following: Conclusions: Patient perception of their relationship with their CF team is likely altered by participation in the support group. Analysis of data collected from the survey administered to participating and non-participating patients in the support group will provide insights into patients' perceptions regarding their care and patient-physician rapport. Participation in a dedicated adult CF support group likely fosters patient confidence and perceived knowledge as well as improves overall interaction with the CF program. Support groups are feasible venues for CF patients to come together and discuss issues with their peers. Method: Participants were recruited from a Midwestern, urban regional CF center. Written and verbal assent was obtained from all children and written consent was obtained from primary caregivers. Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards and data was collected in compliance with APA ethical standards. Questionnaires assessed demographic data, treatment adherence, and IC knowledge. Participants were 36 children/adolescents with CF between the ages of 8 and 18 years (range: 8-18, M = 13.33) and a primary caregiver (range: 29 -51 years, M = 41.19); 45.5% were female.

Next, adherence was inversely associated with youth IC knowledge such that youth with CF who were nonadherent had lower IC knowledge scores (r(36) = .-.339, p = .023). Age related differences in knowledge and adherence were also found in the sample. Finally, knowl-edge scores were examined between parents and children; total IC knowledge scores that differed by more than 30% were categorized as \"disagreement\" and the remaining dyads were categorized as \"agreement.\" Agreement was significantly associated with IC adherence such that greater parent/child agreement was associated with pro-adherent behavior (r(36) = .-.362, p = .03).Conclusions: Results suggests that particularly for children/teens, knowledge of IC guidelines is inadequate. Moreover, data are suggestive of a relationship between IC knowledge and adherence and potentially transmission of IC knowledge between parent and child as a positive contribution to IC adherence. Background: The CF Foundation and the CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older receive a seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for children with CF who are at higher risk of morbidity from influenza, including those younger than 5 years of age. Despite these recommendations, many CF children may not receive an influenza vaccination in a timely manner.

            "text": "The purpose of the project was to improve patient access to support for quitting smoking. Unit RNs would be prepared to assess and counsel smokers and have standardized mechanisms to inform the multidisciplinary team about patients' smoking status and readiness to quit.Method: An implementation team was recruited from staff nurses in order to identify gaps in knowledge and resources. Following a baseline survey of nursing practice, knowledge and self-efficacy, nurses received brief education sessions about the optimal process for inpatients. We established a partnership with the Smokers' Helpline to ensure continued support after discharge. Two clinic nurses were trained in intensive tobacco cessation counseling and several inpatient nurses attended one day workshops in smoking cessation. The admission chart was organized to promote completion of the intake form. We used pocket cards to remind nurses of the process and distributed bedside signs to prompt smokers to initiate discussions with their nurse. When initial rates of nursing participation dropped, nurses were reminded to complete the assessment tool and asked to complete a booster session on the minimal intervention process.Results: An initial survey showed that only 26.3% of nurses usually discussed smoking with patients due to concerns about distressing patients and perceived limitations of the nurses' role. Post-education this number increased to 55% while the number of nurses reporting sufficient training increased from 8.6% to 62.5%. Documentation in the existing electronic system did not initially show evidence of interventions. The charting process was improved to include a specialized smoking assessment tool to guide intervention and documentation. Recent audits on the written tool revealed nurses now advise, assess and assist smokers at least 50% of the time and are referring for followup at least 25% of the time.Discussion: The current project gave us an opportunity to optimize the role of nurses and fill a gap in the provision of care. The documentation tool boosted evidence of nursing participation while bedside reminders promoted nurse-client interaction. The small patient population, short hospitalization stays and reluctance to report smoking presented challenges to data collection and analysis. Future plans to improve patient care include communicating about smoking between the inpatient and outpatient areas, optimizing the use of our trained nurses and increasing the number of referrals we make to the Smokers' Helpline and clinics. Methods: Patients (\u22656 years) with a CF diagnosis and \u226518 months of continuous eligibility were identified from the MarketScan\u00ae Medicaid database (1/2005 to 12/2010). Annual healthcare costs incurred by CF patients were measured during a 12 month study period and expressed in 2010 USD. Total healthcare costs were compared across subgroups of CF patients, defined by age, gender and history of hospitalization in the 6 months preceeding the study period, using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.",

            "text": "Results: Among 1,731 patients with CF, the average age was 17.9 years, 50.7% were female and 27.2% were hospitalized within 6 months prior to the study period. Mean total healthcare costs (medical service and pharmacy) to Medicaid were $37,328 \u00b1 58,182 per patient per year, with medical service costs accounting for 55% of total healthcare costs (Table 1) . Mean total healthcare costs varied significantly across age, gender and hospitalization history. As compared to patients aged 6-10 years ($29,076 \u00b1 43,179), costs incurred by patients aged 18-34 ($45,045 \u00b1 69,998, p<.001*) and 11-17 ($43,610 \u00b1 62,982, p<.001*) years were significantly higher whereas costs incurred by those aged 35-64 ($21,382 \u00b1 32,541, p=.104), and \u226565 years ($6,365 \u00b1 7,427, p=.020*) were lower.

Medical service costs made up more than half of the total expenditures for people with CF.Supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. A multi-specialty team of practitioners from the local pediatric CF Centers participated in the CFF sponsored CFRD Collaborative that was held from fall of 2010 to fall of 2011. During the collaborative the team mapped out an ideal process for testing, diagnosing and management of CF related diabetes. The team identified areas needing improvement. One of these was the limited number of patients who had been diagnosed with CFRD who were routinely seen by an endocrinologist. Another was lack of follow up information given to families regarding results of annual oral glucose tolerance tests. As a result of the team's recognition of problems with care and follow up, a combined Endocrine and CF clinic was developed. This combined clinic began in November of 2011 following the completion of the CFRD collaborative. Twice a month, a pediatric endocrinologist attends CF clinic. Her presence in CF clinic has led to several improvements. In the seven months that she has been embedded in CF clinic, she has had 56 patient encounters. Prior to this, 67 patient encounters occurred outside of CF clinic in a one year period. With this rate of visits, she will see 70% more patients in CF clinic than seen outside CF clinic at the completion of the first year. Her presence in CF clinic has also broadened the scope of the endocrine visits. The visits have included meeting with patients with CFRD, meeting to discuss results of the annual Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), meeting regarding bone density issues and meeting to make recommendations related to growth and/or puberty. Prior to her presence in CF clinic, patients had primarily been seen only following a diagnosis with CFRD. Very few patients were seen following a diagnosis of osteoporosis or growth related issues. No patients were seen to review results of the OGTT if the test was normal or indeterminate. The CFRD consensus statement recommends that patients with CFRD have four visits annually with an endocrinologist. Prior to the collaborative, none of our patients met this recommendation. We believe that having an endocrinologist in CF clinic will lead to a dramatic improvement in these visits and we will follow this closely as we near the end of the first year. We hope to expand the presence of the endocrinologist in the CF clinic. Currently, she is present on the days when four of the CF pulmonologists see patients, but not on the days that two other CF pulmonologists see patients. We also hope to have the ability to perform point of care testing of HgbA1C in the CF clinic. This will have a direct impact on care management. Our team is currently collecting satisfaction data related to patient and parent perception of the value of seeing an endocrinologist during CF clinic.Our team's involvement in the CFRD collaborative led to changes in the way we provide care for patients with multiple endocrine issues. With an endocrinologist in CF clinic, we have been able to increase the number of patients seen, increase the frequency of visits for patients with CFRD, broaden the number of issues addressed and provide a proactive, preventive medicine approach to care. We believe that satisfaction with this approach is high, but are currently gathering satisfaction data. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) education is important for inpatient nursing staff because pulmonary treatments and care of multisystem manifestations of CF (i.e. pancreatic insufficiency or CFRD) are of utmost importance on the inpatient unit. Prior to this project, education sessions had been prepared for the nurses by the multidisciplinary CF staff while the nursing staff provided care on the inpatient unit. However, these sessions have been rescheduled several times due to patient care demands. Due to this dilemma, we included the inpatient nursing staff in our CF Family Education Day to provide additional instruction.",

            "text": "Methods: In 2009, inpatient nursing staff from our regional adult and pediatric CF centers attended CF Family Education Day. Eight nurses were present. Their nurse manager provided them with education hours for this 5 hour session. The program was free to both parents and nursing staff. In addition to attendance at this event, select nursing staff members also attended the 2010 NACFC. After attending the meeting, the nurses and the multidisciplinary CF care team presented the information learned from the conference to the hospital CF Family Advisory Council and their nursing colleagues. Given the positive response in the past, a 4-item pre-conference survey on CF issues was administered to assess CF knowledge prior to attendance at the next CF Family Education Day. Added incentive was provided with nursing contact hours to encourage attendance.Results: Inpatient nursing staff attended the 2012 CF Family Education Day, which included topics such as an overview of CF care, Port CF Registry center data, transitioning to adult care and a parenting skills workshop. Survey responses showed that ongoing CF specific education is beneficial. For example, the nursing staff underestimated the average life expectancy of patients with CF. However, following inclusion at CF Family Education Day and the 2010 NACFC, the pediatric inpatient nursing staff has identified ongoing opportunities for education and improvement on the inpatient unit regarding CF care. Quality improvement initiatives such as evaluation of the time it takes to initiate inpatient treatments and accuracy of care are being studied. Together, these endeavors have fostered better collaboration with the inpatient nursing staff in addition to development of new multidisciplinary projects.Conclusion: Including the inpatient nursing staff in the CF Family Education Day was instrumental to increasing their knowledge regarding CF care and integrating them as contributing members of the CF team. The inclusion of the inpatient nursing staff has also fostered quality improvement projects specific to the care of patients with CF. The Toronto Adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Program at St Michael's Hospital was established in 1992 and is North America's largest adult CF program. Two satellite CF clinics were established for patients in northern Ontario communities hundreds of miles away. Frequent follow up in multidisciplinary CF clinics is known to improve patient outcomes. However, satellite clinics do not allow access to the entire multidisciplinary team, as reimbursement is limited for expenses related to physician visits. For appointments at the host hospital scheduling limitations such as accommodating patients' work or school responsibilities, availability of space, the CF physician's schedule, and inclement weather frequently led to last minute clinic cancellations.",

            "text": "The main goals of this initiative were to improve patient care and education by utilizing videoconferencing. Patients would come to Toronto once a year, attend satellite clinics twice a year and have a telemedicine appointment annually.Methods: In July 2010, monthly telemedicine multidisciplinary CF clinics were established to address the barriers that impede access to care. Patients were interviewed by the local nurse and spirometry and bloodwork were done. Results were sent by FAX to the Toronto clinic and the patients were able to see team members by video link.Results: The telemedicine conference visit was used in two major ways -for routine clinic visits and for episodic illness. To date, there have been 71 patients seen by telemedicine conference with 22 monthly clinics held and 10 patients seen outside of the monthly clinics. As time passed clinicians became more experienced with the format and used the telemedicine link in increasingly diverse ways. Several telemedicine clients in remote locations were cared for on home intravenous therapy. One ventilated client was being considered for transplant while hospitalized 800 miles away and was monitored and coached via telemedicine by both the CF and transplant physicians. For a newly diagnosed client the CF doctor used telehealth to explain how to use enzymes. The nurse practitioner was able to present diagrams of the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis by video for the patient to see. The physiotherapist used telemedicine to demonstrate correct technique for airway clearance. The mother of a CF child commented that the drive to the telehealth studio took 15 minutes compared with a 10 hour trip to the Toronto clinic. One patient explained that the trip to Toronto meant interrupting her life-sustaining therapies including masks, physio and exercise.Discussion: Telemedicine improved patient care, reduced patient costs and improved inter-professional collaboration. We were able to strengthen relationships with community partners by incorporating visits with local care teams. The telemedicine visits express our client-centred approach to care by maintaining interprofessional collaboration with the CF team while saving the client time and travel costs. Future plans include continuing to promote attendance at telehealth and possibly considering specialized clinics such as CFRD clinics that could be held via telehealth. The respirology unit at St. Michael's Hospital has 15 beds for adults with cystic fibrosis and other lung disease. However, majority of the admissions are patients with cystic fibrosis at any given time. Most of them are admitted due to pulmonary exacerbation for treatment of IV antibiotics. However, other medical interventions including desensitization to antibiotic, steroid therapy, insulin regimen, oxygen or Bipap may also be initiated. Recent study from Germany involving 670 patients range from 12 to 64 demonstrated that anxiety score were found in 20.6% of patients with CF and recent medical events i.e. hemoptysis or diagnosis of diabetes were assoiciated with anxiety. We too have observed a degree of anxiety and fear in our hospitalized patient as measured by Picker Scores. As part of our corporate imitatives for quality improvement, our ward nurses took on the task to reduce anxiety and fear in our hospitalized patients by utilizing Best Practice Guildeline of Establishing Therapeutic Relationships to ease anxiety and fear.",

A one-hour, interactive education session about how to establish therapeutic relationship and professionalism in nursing was provided. Posters were put in patient rooms to remind patients of the nurses' interest to listen, counsel, address or communicate issues of anxiety and fear. Fifteen patients completed a survey to identify the factors that cause the most anxiety and fear during their hospitalization and these factors were printed on a pocket cards and distributed to all nurses to remind them to address the issues identified. Tape-reporting as a mean to communicate between nursing shifts were replaced by the transfer of accountability (TOA) method, bedside reporting between nurses with patient participation.Picker Scores, chart audits and a unit-specific patient satisfaction survey were used as outcome measures of improvement.Results: Patient identified 10 major factors causing anxiety and fear with separation from home and learning new information about their health being the most anxiety provoking. Chart audit revealed that more nurses addressed anxiety and fear after implementation of the project an increase from 75% to 95% of charts. Patient expressed that TOA provided good communication and opportunities to discuss their fear and anxiety during hospitalization. The ward Picker Score increased from 35% in 2010 to 86% in 2011with higher scores indicating patients' felt their anxiety and fear is being addressed.Conclusion: Patients experience fear and anxiety during the hospital stay and establishing therapeutic relationship between nurses and patients helps ease these concerns. Background: Reduced parental health literacy has been associated with negative health behaviors and outcomes across several pediatric conditions, yet has not been previously studied in CF. CF patients of Hispanic ethnicity have worse pulmonary function and survival. The objective of this pilot study was to assess health literacy in parents of Hispanic and non-Hispanic children with CF. We hypothesized that parents of Hispanic children with CF would have lower health literacy than parents of non-Hispanic CF children.Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 25 parents of Hispanic children with CF and 63 parents of non-Hispanic CF children in a convenience sample; this represented 84.6% of our eligible pediatric population. Health literacy was assessed using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA), a standardized instrument available in both English and Spanish versions. Health literacy scores and categories were compared by child's Hispanic origin as well as additional socioeconomic and demographic parameters.Results: Eighty-four of 88 parents enrolled in the study (95.4%) demonstrated adequate health literacy. While there was a trend for parents of Hispanic CF patients to attain lower health literacy scores than parents of non-Hispanic CF patients, the difference in the mean score of each group was not statistically significant (P=0.17). Nonetheless, parents of Hispanic children were significantly more likely to have inadequate or marginal health literacy (16.0%) than were parents of non-Hispanic children (0.0%), P=0.005. Further investigation revealed that the parent's primary spoken language may be an important factor underlying this disparity, as Spanish-speaking parents attained significantly lower health literacy scores than Englishspeaking parents (P=0.02) and were far more likely to have inadequate or marginal health literacy (26.7% versus 0.0%), P=0.001.Conclusions: While health literacy was largely adequate among parents of children with CF at our center, parents of Hispanic children were significantly more likely to have inadequate or marginal health literacy skills than were parents of non-Hispanic children. The proportion of individuals with inadequate or marginal health literacy was particularly high for parents who speak Spanish as their primary language, despite the opportunity for participants to take the assessment in their language of choice. Although multicenter studies are required to confirm our findings, further investigations should examine whether differences in parental health literacy contribute to outcome disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic CF patients. As predictors of limited health literacy, Hispanic origin and Spanish primary language could also be incorporated into future efforts to screen for this potential barrier to management of CF and to develop interventions for this high-risk population. This study was supported by the 2011 Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Medical School Summer Research Program. Background: Diabetes is the most common secondary complication (co morbidity ) in CF. In addition to the microvascular complications associated with diabetes itself, cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, weight loss and reduced survival by up to 10 years. Routine screening followed by early diagnosis and treatment has improved survival. DAFNE\u00ae (dose adjustment for normal eating) is a structured training programme of flexible intensive insulin management enabling dietary freedom which leads to improvements in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and quality of life in type 1 diabetics. In the UK there are currently no structured education programmes for adults with CFRD and formal carbohydrate counting does not form part of routine CFRD management. To address this we have developed the Diabetes in Cystic Fibrosis -Education (DICE) programme. With permission from the DAFNE\u00ae collaborative the DAFNE\u00ae programme and resources have been adapted specifically for the management of CFRD. Patients with CFRD have been involved in the development of the materials to ensure acceptability and understanding. The course was changed from a 5 day group course to a 1:1 course which involves 4 sessions over a 6 week period. The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether the introduction of an education course teaching patients flexible intensive insulin treatment to allow dietary freedom can improve diabetic control and quality of life for patients with CFRD.",

The course is delivered by 2 educators with support from 2 CF consultants and a DAFNE\u00ae approved diabetologist. All members of the DICE collaborative have received formal DAFNE\u00ae training. Patients attend 4 -3 hour education sessions over a 6 week period and are taught the principles of carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment as part of the programme. At recruitment, 6 and 12 months the following data is recorded -lung function, weight, height, BMI, random glucose, HbA1c, CGMS (6 days) and completion of CFQ-R, ADDQoL, DTSQ and diabetes self-efficacy questionnaires.Results: Twelve patients have been recruited to date. Four have completed the study, 8 are in progress and recruitment continues across both sites with the aim of enrolling 30 patients. Preliminary data have identified some interesting observations; improved self efficacy in the overall management of CF and diabetes, improvements in QOL scores, better understanding of CFRD and a commitment to continue with DICE CFRD management (carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment).Conclusion: Preliminary observations on the impact of this education course have been encouraging with patients reporting improved understanding and confidence in self-management of CFRD. Recruitment is ongoing. Available data for those patients having completed the initial 6 month study period will be presented. Background/Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex and multisystem disease requiring a complicated and time consuming regimen of treatments. Due to the considerable intricacies of care, patients may not understand the rationale behind prescribed therapies and develop the misconception that non-adherence is acceptable. Treatment burden may also lead to non-adherence with nutrition recommendations, medication administration and airway clearance. The primary objective of the study was to assess the impact of intense education related to nutrtrition, airway clearance, infection control, and compliance with therapies. A multisystem questionnaire was developed and implemented to study the change in nutrition and pulmonary endpoints after intense education.",

Patients/families completed a pre-test at the first clinic visit of the year. Upon completing the pre-test, education on prescribed medication administration was provided. During each subsequent clinic visit patients were educated on different facets of the multi-system disease (visit two: airway clearance, visit three: nutrition and visit four: infection control). A post-test was completed after the final education session at the last visit of the year. Nutrition and pulmonary endpoints were collected. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) percentile were averaged over the four visits; levels of vitamin A, D, E were documented from the study year and year prior. Average percent FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75 was recorded. Means and standard deviations were calculated, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test was utilized to determine change in nutrition and pulmonary endpoints. A p-value of 0.05 was utilized to determine significance.Results: Among the 25 subjects no changes were observed among anthropometrics and lung function. Among patients at increased nutrition risk a clinically relevant, but non-significant increase in nutrition and pulmonary endpoints was observed. Results are summarized in the table.Conclusions: In this one-year pilot study, only vitamin A and E status improved after intense patient education. Results indicate pediatric patients/families have moderate knowledge regarding CF disease process and associated therapies (pre-test score 78%). Post-test scores only improved by 2%, indicating more education may be required or that education sessions during the clinic visit may be ineffective. However, a sub-set of patients at increased nutrition risk did experience improved vitamin levels, anthropometrics and lung function. More research is need to determine the effect of education on nutrition and pulmonary endpoints; a larger study population over more than a one year time period may be indicated. A potential for focus could be on patients/families with poor growth.",
