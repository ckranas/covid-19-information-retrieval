GERD causes the interposition of columnar lined esophagus (CLE) between the squamous lined esophagus and the oxyntic mucosa of the proximal stomach (\u00bcsquamo-oxyntic gap). The squamo-oxyntic gap may contain oxyntocardiac, cardiac mucosa AE intestinal metaplasia (Barretts esophagus). Intestinal metaplasia may progress towards esophageal adenocarcinoma (0.5% annual risk). Accordingly Barretts esophagus is recognized as having a cancer risk justifying endoscopic surveillance. Biopsies obtained from the squamocolumnar junction have the highest yield for the assessment of intestinal metaplasia (proofing reflux and cancer risk). Thus the biopsy protocol should include at least 4 quadrant biopsies from the squamocolumnar junction and biopsies obtained at 0.5 cm increments from endoscopically visible tongues or segments of CLE. The proximal to distal length of the squamo-oxyntic gap is assessed by multi level biopsies from the esophago-gastric junction zone.",

Liver transplantation (LT) appears to be the optimal treatment of small and oligocentric hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic livers. Replacement of the cirrhotic liver implies not only the removal of the tumor the cirrhotic liver but also the precancerous tissue. Apart from organ scarcity, another problem in LT is the restriction of this procedure to patients meeting the Milan criteria (MC) which are frequently exceeded during waiting time.

Oesophageal cancer located below the trachea bifurcation requires a transhiatal esophagectomy and also a videoassisted lymphadenectomy is suggested. Gastrointestinal tract continuity is usually restored by a substitute formed from the stomach. The extensive gastric cardia cancer is also problematic, for which we suggest a two-stage procedure: esophagectomy and gastrectomy during the first stage followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The restoration of gastrointestinal continuity is made with the use of the distal part of the ileum and the right colon during the second stage.

Cancers of the colon and rectum are the third most common site of new cancer cases and cancer deaths. Hepatic metastasis is one of the most frequent sites of metastatic disease. Infact, 35-55% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop hepatic metastasis. Patients who are able to undergo complete resection of their hepatic metastases have the best chance of long-term survival. Survival following hepatic resection of colorectal metastasis now approaches 35-50%. However, approximately 65% of patients will have a recurrence at 5 years.

The development of new molecular targeted therapies (bevacizumab and cetuximab) has also produced encouraging results and approximately 15-30% of patients with initially unresectable disease can be downsized with preoperative chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is employed in patients with initially resectable disease. One potential benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be to allow an initially resectable lesion to be resected with a more parenchymal sparing resection with an improved ability to obtain an complete resection margin. Up to 15-25% of patients with primary CRC will have synchronous hepatic metastases at the time of presentation. Most clinicians have advocated for a staged approach in patients with resectable primary colon cancer and hepatic disease. However, several studies have now demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a simultaneous resection. Recently the ''liver first'' technique has been implicated as potential curative method for CRM. In patients with extensive disease involving both sides of the liver, a two-stage (or sequential) hepatectomy may be the best therapeutic approach.",

Kru slin 2 1 General Hospital, Nova Gradi ska, Croatia; 2 Klini cka Bolnica Sestara Milosrdnica, Zagreb, Croatia All protocols of patients who have undergone a surgery due to colorectal carcinoma at the Department of Surgery, Nova Gradi ska General Hospital. The aims were: (1) to determine the expression of growth hormone (GH), and growth hormone receptor (GHR) in primary colorectal adenocarcinoma, regional lymph node metastatic tumor and unaffected adjacent bowel wall, and (2) to correlate the expression of GH and GHR with clinicopathologic features of patients with primary tumors and survival data. The majority of tumors showed the increased expression of GHR, and a half of tumors showed positive staining for GH. No statistically significant difference has been found between the GH and GHR expression and the age, and sex of the patients, tumor size, and Dukes and Astler-Coller stage. No positive staining was found in adjacent bowel wall or it was very weak. Lymph node metastases showed increased expression of GHR in 68.4% cases, while the expression of GH was determined in 42.1% of tumors. Recurrences were appearing significantly more often in patients with increased expression of GHR. Statistically significant difference was determined in the survival of the patients with increased expression of GHR that have lived a significantly shorter period of time than those with the negative GHR expression (p \u00bc 0.045). Differences in the tested markers' expression, especially GHR in relation to the survival, have been noticed in this study. Background. Nutritional depletion is one of the major determinant of the development of perioperative complications. Colorectal surgery patients are at risk of nutritional depletion from inadequate nutritional intake, surgical stress and increase in metabolic rate. Fears of postoperative ileus and the integrity of the newly constructed anastomosis have led to treatment typically entailing starvation with administration of intravenous fluids until the passage of flatus. Aim of the study was to investigate role of perioperative nutrition in reducing perioperative stress and complications colorectal cancer patients.",

Developed application for digital wound image analysis gives objective, reliable and reproducible results, allowing unique and objective comparison of treatment results between different methods and different institutions. The treatment of lumbar segmental insufficiency or microinstability. As the one present in osteochondrosis, still remains a topic of discussion in spine surgery. It is widely accepted that a restabilization of the involved segment usually via posterior transpedicular fixation is the method of choice. Eventhough, as standard technique, it remains associated to a number of drawbacks. Also, the surgical treatment of spinal canal stenosis at the lumbar level is often indicated but associated secondarily with instability. Based on the role of the original ligamentoplasty technique as ''protective'' method for the posterior elements to reduce the risk of iatrogenic instability, Samani developed the interspinous ''U'' which allowed for a dynamic restabilization after decompressive procedures proving also to be useful for segmental insufficiency. Recently, a modified version of that device, conceived as proper stabilization or fusion add-on has been introduced after extensive mechanical testing. This device placed posteriorly between the spinous processes in association with the placement of two interertebral cages has proven biomechanically to have the same characteristics as a conventional transpedicular fixation. The device, technique and specific aspects will be presented along with clinical examples. It allows for a fusion with less tissue manipulation, reduces surgical time and we believe will avoid to some extent the risk of an adjacent level involvement as seen with the conventional PLIF technique. Background. Most galstones 75% are asymptomatic. About 10-15% of people with gallbladder calculosis will have associated choledoholithiasis.

A nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NIRLN) is a rare anomaly. The right subclavian artery normally araised from the brachiocephalic artery. Variations in its anatomy are rare. An aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the aorta is a rare deperopement. This anomaly suggested that the right inferior laryngeal nerve branched directly from the vagal trunk.",

This study confirms the thesis of our institution that early cholecystectomy is justified since it is frequently done laparoscopically, with just a few conversions and other complications. It eliminates pain immediately, postoperative recovery is fast, significantly reduced duration of hospitalisation and absence of the patient from everyday activities. Expenses are reduced. In the same time we avoid the complications due to postponement of surgical procedure. ",

The natural course of this is unclear and therefore treatments range from concervative approach with antibiotics and percutaneous guided drainage=PCD=to surgery. The European Association for Endoscopic surgeons developed a classifications scheme based upon the severity of its clinical presentation. Another classification system was developed by Hinchey and adapted from Kohler. CT classification by Ambrosetti is recently most used. The treatment goal remains to convert patients to elective one-stage resections (laparoscopically). Elective surgery for diverticular disease is acceptable in selected cases despite recent reports which speak in favour of a more conservative approach. In case of clinically present acute abdomen (perforation) surgery is clearly indicated. Depend of a case the possibilities are to perform ''one stage'', ''two stage'' or ''three stage'' operations.

We have not noticed any major complications after early cholecystectomy (7-10 days after the onset of symptoms of acute pancreatitis) and no recidiva of pancreatitis in that group of patients. Because of shorter hospitalization, fewer number of hospitalizations and earlier resumption of normal life, we find that early cholecystectomy is safe and preferred for patients with acute pancreatitis that show resolution of pancreatitis within 7-10 days after the onset of pancreatitis. Results. Gender ratio was 2:1 in favor of female. Average age was 53 (ranged from 25 to 69). In 14 patients (58%) cyst was located in right lobe, in 6 (25%) patients was located in left lobe and in 4 patients (16%) cyst occupied the left and right segments of the liver. Unilocular cyst was found in 17 patients (70%), 3 and more cysts in 7 patients (30%). Smallest cyst was the size of 2 cm while the largest cyst was about 12 cm.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GISTs, are a relatively uncommon type of cancer that occur in the gastroin-testinal tract, 1-3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Approximately 50% of GISTs occur in the stomach, 25% in the small intestine, 10% in the colon and 15% other parts of the GI tract. GISTs belong to a class of diseases called sarcomas, cancers that begin in the connective tissues, which include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, nerves, bones and cartilage. Most cases occur in people between 40-80 years of age. They are typically defined by mutations in the Kit gene or PDGFRA gene, and may or may not stain positively for Kit.

The main goal of primary breast reconstruction is to prevent psychical states like depression and stress after mastectomy. In follow-up period after breast surgery we use specially designed forms to detect quality of life in our patients and our results suggest that patients with primary breast reconstruction have better psychological profile and less depression states than patients who's breast reconstruction was delayed or not performed. Our conclusion is that primary breast reconstruction after mastectomy is a safe and well recommended procedure with good immediate aesthetic and functional result and better postoperative psychological profile.

After 5 months of conservative treatment consisted of ''U'' splint for 2 and cylinder plaster for 3 months 5 patients had clinical and radiological signs of humeral shaft pseudoarthrosis, followed with elbow and shoulder contracture. As next step in treatment we tried plate fixation, but after failing to place cortical screws in humerus due to heavy osteoporosis, we decided to perform humeral nailing. The treatment consisted of pseudoarthrosis excision and placing unreamed anterograde humeral nail (Zimmer) locked proximaly and distaly, without spongioplasty. Physical therapy started immediately after operation due to elbow and shoulder contracture.",

In elderly patients, individuals older than 65 years of age have an elevated risk of stroke, mainly because the degree of carotid artery stenosis increases with the age.

With increase in age of the population, there is also an increase in the number of risk factors of cerebrovascular accident.",

This approach may produce acceptable results in dealing with this complex pathology even in centers with relatively limited volume of patients. Upper extremity ischemia in athletes is usually caused by embolism from the proximal arterial segments due to repetitive compression at the thoracic outlet or under the pectoralis minor muscle. The posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA), a branch of the third part of the axillary artery, can also be injured by repetitive overhead activity which is common in volleyball players. It is believed that the throwing motions of the dominant shoulder players may cause minor repetitive traumas in the arterial wall of the axillary artery or its tributaries, which can lead to a traumatic aneurysm. Thrombotic occlusion of the aneurysm could be a source of distal embolism and acute hand ischemia. We report a case of a 31-year-old volleyball player who complained of hand and forearm ischemia which was caused by distal embolisation from a thrombotic occlusion of the PCHA. The CTA showed acute occlusion of both main forearm arteries and an urgent embolectomy was attempted. A detailed diagnostic workout showed occlusion of an aneurysm of the PCHA, which was excluded with an endovascular approach. The diagnostic possibilities (i.e. ultrasound, CTA and contrast angiography) and therapeutic options (conservative, surgical and endovasular) are discussed. Although rare, doctors and volleyball players should be aware of this potentially disabling vascular complication. Background. FAA of the FA is one of the major complications compromising femoral graft repair. FAA complicates 2 to 5% of graft procedures.",

At Children's Hospital Zagreb we perform the minimally invasive method of VP system implantation, with short skin incisions, positioning of valve hidden in retroauricular position because of better estethic result, with proximal catheter implanted in occipital horn of lateral cerebral ventricle. In small children the use of pneumatic drill is avoided, but rather sharp dissector is used to trepanate the bone, formnig narrow linear bone opening. During implantation, all unnecessary parts of system are removed, including the enforcing knee, and too long parts of proximal and distal part of system are shortened to appropriate length. We never use the suture for fixing the parts of system, but rather original mechanical connection. The implantation of unishunt is avoided because of inability to adjust the length of proximal catether. During replacement of system, we always replace the entire system and implant it on the same side of the head, which reduces both the number of skin incisions and extension of operation. Direct touch with the system makes only surgeon, and checking of the system is performed not using the saline, but the patients cerebrospinal fluid immediately after implantation of proximal catether. All this decreases the possibilities for development of shunt meningitis, which is very rare at our clinic, below 1%. The goal of this approach is favorable cosmetic effect, with the system completely invisible and hidden below the skin surface of the child. Pediatric surgeon implants distal part of the system intraperitoneally, or, in selected cases in right atrium of the heart, interpleurally, or in azygous vein.",

This paper sums up our experiences and results during the past decade regarding transtibial amputations in patients with obliterative arterial diseases. In the mentioned period we performed 168 major lower-extremity amputations, 104 of which were transfemoral, and 64 transtibial. Our results demonstrate that most patients who underwent transtibial amputations are female (44=20), that the patients' average age is 70.5, whereas more amputations were performed on the lower left leg.",

An incarcerated omentum and stomach were found in 2 patients. In most cases simple closure of diaphragmatic defect was applied. Only in 2 cases the use of a mesh was necessary. In one patients a recurrent hernia due to physical exertion occurred in a 3-year follow-up; a successful laparoscopic repair was performed. In the author's opinion the laparoscopic repair of both incarcerated and reducible hernias should be considered as a ''gold standard''. Background. Surgical treatment of supra-aortic trunk disease is largely dependent on the type and extent of the disease process. Transcervical bypass is a procedure of choice for all single arterial lesions, except for those of the innominate artery, and for patients at high risk of thoracotomy. However, for younger patients with innominate artery or multiple lesions, a direct transthoracic approach via median sternotomy is preferred.

The results of this survey showed that the mortality rate after simultaneous and delayed resection were similar in case of minor hepatectomy. However, the mortality rate was significantly higher in the simultaneous group in case of major hepatectomy. Subsequently, the presumed good candidates for an elective simultaneous resection were patients presenting a right colon adenocarcinoma and requiring a minor hepatectomy. Then, due to the development of mechanical suturing devices and the progresses in techniques of liver surgery, the selection criteria for a simultaneous resection were extended to patients presenting with left colon and upper rectal adenocarcinomas, and to those requiring a major liver resection. The early postoperative outcome as well as survival rates were similar after simultaneous or delayed resections.",

The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly the modern chemotherapy regimens (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, avastin and erbitux), is indicated in the management of synchronous liver metastases.

We recorded time from admission to surgery, hospital stay, in hospital mortality, length of operation, operative blood loss, perioperative complications and time for fracture healing. Results. Mean time from admission to surgery was 2, and of hospital stay 14 days. In hospital mortality was 3%. 35 min was average operation length. Intraoperative blood loss was <100 mL in 93%. We required limited open reduction in 10%, and in 88% of patients we achieved good reduction followed by early mobilization and weight bearing",

The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare results of minimally invasive laparoscopic approach to these of open surgery for treatment of TNM stages II and III colon cancer. Methods. Retrospective analysis of 322 patients with stages II and III colon cancer operated from January 1st 2007 to November 30th 2009 was made. Laparoscopically assisted colectomy (LAC) was performed in 87 patients and open colectomy (OC) was performed in 235 patients.Results. Sex ratio and mean age were similar in both groups. Eight patients in the laparoscopic group (9.6%) underwent conversion to open surgery. The number of lymph nodes removed was similar in both groups (21.7 in LAC vs. 21.1 in OC, p \u00bc 0.91). Postoperative complications requiring reoperation were observed in 2 patients in LAC group and in 7 patients in OC group (2.3% vs. 3.0%, p \u00bc 0.73). Anastomotic fistulae occurred in 2 patients in OC group (0.4%). Patients undergoing LAC had a lower incidence of postoperative complications, however the difference was not significant. Early mortality rate was similar in both groups (1.1% LAC vs. 2.1% OC, p \u00bc 0.56). Mean length of stay was significatly shorter after LAC (8.5 vs. 11.1 days, p \u00bc 0.003).",

During last four years (November 2005 -December 2009 ), since the establishment of the Division of Vascular Surgery of the Surgical Clinic at the Dubrava University Hospital, 321 patients underwent carotid artery revascularisation. We analysed the total number of cases, the portion of the symptomatic, as well as the portion of subtotal stenoses in total number of managed cases. The 95% of the open surgical procedures were performed under the locoregional anesthesia. The majority of the patients had some of the cardiovascular comorbidities. Among the managed patients, 34.58% were symptomatic. We divided patients into two groups, regarding the grade of stenosis. The first group were the ones with subtotal stenoses (more than 90% of the carotid lumen). The others were classified as type A, (70-90% of lumen occluded by the plaque). The subtotal stenoses were found in 36.78% of the total man! aged cases. According to our experience 4.98% of all cases were diagnosed as the re-stenoses. The carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was mostly used therapeutic pathway, while only 6.54% underwent endovascular procedures (CAS, carotid artery stenting). The CAS was used in the management of the restenoses, stenosis of common carotid artery and also in the cases of the specific anatomical circumstances.",

We would like to present the method of placing the first troacar which we use in our hospital, and we believe it is safer comparing to the other methods. In our method, we reach a part of the white line above the navel with grapple by Backhause. After that, we place Veres's needle and achieve pneumoperitoneum. We remove one of the grapple and place the first troacar.Methods. We took photos of the procedure of placing the Veres's needle and the first troacar. It is observable that fascia is lifting off intraabdominal structures. In the entire number of procedures the percentage of complications is small but present.Results. In our hospital there was a large number of performed laparoscopic operations. This method of placing the first troacar isn't deprived of complications, but number of complications with fatal outcome has decreased.Conclusions. There are more ways of placing the first troacar, and we consider this method less hazardous towards a patient.",

Pregnancy was once considered an absolute contraindication for laparoscopic surgery, but pregnant patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery have been reported increasingly in the past decade. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed in all tree trimester of pregnancy.Methods. We report one case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy during pregnancy. Patient had laboratory and ultrasound diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in the second trimester of pregnancy at a gestational age of 26 weeks. First port we placed by Hasson technique, few centimeters cephalad to fundal height. Insufflation pressure was 12 mmHg, and duration of procedure was 85 min.Results. We had no intraoperative and postoperative complications, and patient was discharged on the second postoperative day. Patient delivered healthy babies at full term.Conclusion. Pregnancy should not be considered as contraindication to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and can be performed safely, with minimal risk to the mother and fetus.Background. The optimal surgical treatment of patients with refractory renal hyperparathyroidism (RHP) on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease is still a point of controversy. The high percentage of recurrences after subtotal parathyroidectomy (STPTx) or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (TPTx \u00fe AT) reactualised the practice of total parathyroidectomy (TPTx).Methods. Forty-two patients underwent PTx for HPR. There were 23 STPTx, 6 TPTx \u00fe AT and 13 TPTx. In the first two standard surgical procedures the percentage of recurrences was 20.7%(6 cases) so in the last 5 years we performed TPTx in a series of 13 patients: 7 men and 6 women with median age 43 years and median dialysis time before PTx of 8.1 years.Results. Indications for surgery were refractory RHP with grossly elevated iPTH. TPTx was done in 12 patients in the 13th one a completion PTx being performed one year after outward surgery which excised only two glands. Postoperatively the main symptoms and the calcemia markely normalised together with a low PTH level but no one presented permanent hypocalcemia or recurrent HP at 4-60 months after parathyroidectomy.Conclusions. TPTx \u00fe AT proves to be an equally safe and successful as another methods anulating the risk of recurrences and eliminating the hyperparathyroid status especially in patients with an agressive form of RHP without the prospect of renal transplantation.

            "text": "Background. The advent of new diagnostic and therapy options has radically changed the treatment of malignant diseases. Surgery of colorectal cancer has also evolved, even in some small county hospitals. This retrospective analysis was performed in order to clarify changing patterns of colorectal cancer surgery in our department.Methods. We have studied 543 surgically treated patients with colorectal cancer in the past 20 years. Analyzed variables were: age at the surgical moment, sex, localisation of the tumor and type of surgical procedure. Patients were divided into two groups: the first (patients operated from 1990 to 1999) and the second (patients operated from 2000 to 2009).Results. The total number of cases has risen from 208 in the first group to 335 in the second group. No significant differences were observed in sex, age or tumor site in the two groups. However, significant difference occurred when the types of operations were reviewed. There was a mild increase in number of all types of primary segmental resections with anastomosis, but number of anterior resections of rectum increased beyond expectations (approximately 161%). In contrary, the number of palliative operations for colorectal cancer markedly declined (for about 55%) in the second group.Conclusions. We conclude that early diagnosis and modern surgical devices have a positive impact on the type of colorectal surgery procedure selection.Background. The aim of this study is to show the benefit of combined treatment of vein surgery and Diosmin.Methods. We examined 46 legs in 42 patients with lower extremities primary varicose veins, operated last year in our hospital. Ligatures and stripping of grate saphenous vein and stab phlebectomy were performed in all cases. In main group with 20 legs we made phlebectomy and prescribed Diosmin (PHLEBODIA 600), one week before and one month after operation. In control group we made only phlebectomy. In all patients we made preoperative and post operative color duplex sonography scanning. During follow-up period we made postoperative evaluation after seven, 30 and 90 days. We observed limphoedema and subcutaneous haemorrhagia. Sub-Background. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by a lack of expression of estrogen, progesterone, and ERBB2 receptors. We compare the clinical features and prognosis of association of triple-negative breast cancer with extracapsular extension of axillary lymph node metastasis.Methods. From January 2000 to December 2009, 591 breast cancer patients operated in General hospital ''Sveti Vracevi'' in Bijeljina. We selected 301 (50.9%) patients with breast cancer who had metastases to axillary lymph nodes.Results. Extracapsular extension (ECM) was found in 122 (40.5%). Eighty-three patients (14%) were classified as TNBC. The patients were identified and divided into two groups: 22 patients with triple-negative breast cancer with extracapsular extension of axillary lymph node metastasis (TNBCECM) and 14 patients with triple-negative breast cancer without extracapsular extension of axillary lymph node metastasis (TNBCICM). With a median follow-up of 108 months factors with independent prognostic value for disease-free survival by multivariate analysis included TNBC with extracapsular extension (p < 0.005), pN category (p < 0.01), and presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI; p < 0.005).Conclusions. In patients TNBCECM prognosis was significantly worse compared with those who were TNBCICM. These findings have led to the conclusion that TNBC is associated with a more aggressive subtype of cancer.

            "text": "Background. Metastatic melanoma is often associated with spread to the GI tract. The incidence of GI metastases is around 4-10% with the distribution in autopsies as follows: liver 68%, small bowel 58%, colon 22%, stomach 20%, duodenum 12%, rectum 5%, esophagus 4%, and anus 1% but these data vary with small bowel being the most frequent.Methods. Clinically metastases manifest in 7-10% of patients. Metastases may present both at the time of the diagnosis of primary melanoma or even decades later sometimes as the first sign of recurrence. Symptoms mimic those of other GI tumors and suspicion of GI tract metastases in patients who have a history of melanoma should be raised.Results. We present 2 cases from 2005 to 2009 with metastatic melanoma to GI tract. First was metastasis to small bowel causing intussusception and obstruction with emergent resection 2 years after upper leg cutaneous melanoma. Second case is the third described in the literature to greater omentum with diameter of 20 cm adjacent to transverse colon presenting as abdominal mass with pain without obstructive symptoms 2 years after epipharyngeal melanoma. Elective omentectomy with resection of adjacent transverse colon was performed.Conclusions. The prognosis is poor with mean survival less than a year and 5-year survival is less than 10% depending on several prognostic factors. Treatment includes surgical resection and=or chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.Background. Multicystic nefroma (MCN) is a rare benign tumor of the kidney. Less than 200 cases have been described in the literature and less than 10 cases have been published in Greek literature up to date. We present the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of a patient presenting radiodiagnostic findings of multilocular cystic mass of the right kidney.Methods. A 77-year-old man came to the outpatient facilities of our institution referring mild persistent right flank pain. The patient underwent abdominal U=S demonstrating multicystic mass of the right kidney. He also underwent abdominal CT and MRI revealing both multilocular cystic mass at the inferior pole of the right kidney with multiple septa, non particularly enhanced after intravenous administration of contrast essence (diameter: 6.5 \u00c2 5 cm). Imaging study could non exclude the malignant character of the tumor.Results. The patient underwent nephrectomy. Surgical specimen revealed mulicystic mass of the inferior pole of the right kidney containing serous fluid and pathology report described benign multicystic nefroma.Conclusions. Preoperative diagnosis of MCN is impossible and surgical treatment is diagnostic and curative. Lack of experience in the treatment of these rare tumors imposes a systematic follow-up of these cases. Background. Breast cancer is accountable for 24% of malignancies in Croatian woman with incidence of 2300 cases annually. In most European countries there is a trend of increasing incidence and reducing mortality due to efficacy and quality of screening programs and treatment protocols. Therefore, reduction of morbidity and quality of life has an increased value in choice of treatment.Methods. This study aimed to identify and examine the effects of cancer stage and type of surgical treatment on quality of life of breast cancer patients at Clinical Hospital ''Sestre milosrdnice'' who underwent surgical treatment with either modified radical mastectomy (MRM) or breast conservative surgery (BCS), plus adjuvant chemotherapy.Results. In our study we used The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) with its addition for breast cancer patients (EORTC QLQ-BR23).Conclusions. Breast conservative treatment was expected to have a better impact on QoL than mastectomies in short term studies. Long term evaluations are to scarce to enable significant reference point. Background. Revision modular prosthesis is one of the operative methods of treating a proximal femoral fracture with the loss of median base. The prosthesis consists of three parts: femoral stem, the neck and the head of prosthesis. Modular system allows 168 different combinations of prosthesis lengths and neck angles with different angulation of anteversion.Methods. In total we implanted 127 short and 20 long gamma nails; during postoperative follow-up we had 3 patients with complications after gamma nail osteosynthesis; 2 cut outs and one secondary offset of fracture fragments. All three complications were treated by implantation of revision modular cementless prosthesis. The average age of the patients was 76.33 years.Results. An early physical therapy was started in all patients while on traumatology ward and continued later at home. All patients reported decrease of pain in the operated limb.Conclusions. The use of modular revision prosthesis is a demanding surgical method that acquires good primary stability of prosthesis without presence of median base. Modular system of the neck and the stem allows precise selection of the stem size for the femur, neck length to replace pertrochanteric part and the fractured neck, with precise angulation of anteversion and the neck angle, all necessary to gain satisfactory movement in hip joint. Background. Primary hyperparathyroidism (HTP) is disease of parathyroid glands with high level of PTH, enlargement of glandular cell mass and disorder of function. Cause of HTP is adenoma, hyperplasia and carcinoma. Clinical signs are hypercalcemia and effects of PTH on the target organs. Skeletal disorders are osteofibrosis and osteoporosis. Renal signs are nephrolithiasis and calcinosis. Signs for diagnosis are hypercalcemia, high PTH and calciuria. Ultrasound, CT, MR, angiography, venous catheterization and biopsy are used for diagnostic. Indication for surgery is symptomatic and asymptomatic HTP.Methods. In 2005-2010, 21 procedures were performed in patients with HTP (18 females, 3 males). Average age was 63. Sternotomy was performed in patients with mediastinal localization. Minimal invasive video assisted parathyreoidectomy was",
