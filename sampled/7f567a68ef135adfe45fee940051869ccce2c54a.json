In endometriosis patients a high representation (6%) of the rs560654095 minor allele was found. The HOXA10 gene product binds to the \u03b2-actin promoter and regulates its expression in the endometrium. Further studies are in progress to check this unusual finding. This work was financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation N Background: The cells constantly interact with many signaling molecules. This leads to dynamic changes in the spectrum of expressed genes. Nrf2 and JUN are transcription factors that are involved in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis, which is necessary for cells proliferation and differentiation. These transcription factors activate the antioxidant defense of cells from oxidative stress. In current work, we investigated the expression of NFE2L2, JUN, SOD1 genes in chorionic and decidual tissues after spontaneous abortion compared to normal first trimester pregnancies.",

            "text": "S Pericentric inversions occur in human with a frequency of 1-2% of general population. These balanced chromosomal rearrangements do not cause any problem for the carrier, but during meiosis there is a risk of inversion loop formation in the offspring leading to de novo duplication, deletion or a combination of both [duplication q/deletion p (dup q/del p) or del q/dup p]. Significant numbers of recombinants are produced when the inverted segment size is >50% of the total length of the affected chromosome. We report here a case of prenatal diagnostics of a fetus with multiple anomalies: severe growth retardation, enlarged third ventricle, agenesis of ductus venosus, and cyst of the blood cord. Cytogeneic analysis was performed after amniocentesis and pathologic duplication of chromosome 7q was revealed. To clarify the aberration we made array CGH analysis; the results showed combined aberrations: 3.96 Mbp deletion of 7p (arr[hg19] 7p22.3p22. 2(54,185-4,017,864) x1) and 47 Mbp duplication of 7q (7q31.1q36.3(111,668,521-159,118,566 )x3). We tested the parents by cytogenetic analysis in a meantime. The mother was revealed to be a carrier of pericentric inversion in chromosome 7 -46,XX,inv(7) (p22;q31). Thus, we clarify the genetic diagnosis in the fetus -the recombinant chromosome 7 [rec (7) dup(7q)inv (7)(p22q31)mat] must have arisen through meiotic crossing-over between the inverted chromosome and the normal chromosome 7 in the maternal germline. Conclusion: Array CGH is the most powerful technique in determining the exact size and boundaries of the unbalanced segments in case of rearranged chromosomes and, in combination with parental cytogenetic analysis, for providing the adequate genetic counselling.",

Further research will help to clarify who should receive thromboprophylaxis to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with inherited thrombophilia. We offered in our clinics different kinds of genetic analyses with the aim to clarify diagnosis in men with severe spermatogenic failure. We have performed cytogenetic analysis in 770 men attending reproductive clinics (group I), 88 with confirmed diagnosis of oligoastenozoospermia (group II) and 43 with confirmed azoospermia (group III). Numerical sex chromosomal aberrations (incl. mosaicism) were found in 3.3% of group I, 3.4% of group II (mainly polysomy Y) and 9.3% of group III (mainly Klinefelter syndrome); female karyotype was diagnosed in 0.6% of men. Structural chromosomal aberrations (mainly translocations) were detected in 1.2% of group I, 3.4% of group II and none of group III. Chromosomal heteromorphism was revealed, respectively, in 13%, 13.6% and 11.5%. DNA analysis for 10 pathogens (CT, MG, MH, UP, UU, TV, NG, TP, HS1 and 2) was performed in ejaculate of men with oligoastenozoospermia and azoospermia. The test was positive in 61.5% of azoospermic men and in 21% of oligoastenozoospermic (p<0.01) as double infection was revealed in 38% and 12%, respectively (p<0.05). The statistically higher frequency was established for Ureaplasma parvum (54% vs 15%) and Herpes simplex (23% vs 3%). Genotyping for 24 mutations and IVS 8 intron polymorphism in CFTR gene was performed in 52 men with severe male factor. Both delf508 mutation and IVS 8 5T was found in 5.8% of the analyzed men. In conclusion, by applying all of the above mentioned analyses in 52 men with severe male factor, we were able to make diagnosis in 60% of them. Structural chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for different reproductive issues such as infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. Polymorphic variations are known to occur in the general population. They include varying sizes of heterochromatin blocks, satellite or repeat sequence regions and inversions. However, previous studies have reported that heterochromatin polymorphisms are more frequent in infertile men. This may be associated with infertility and unsuccessful pregnancy. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is a common method in the assisted reproduction techniques (ART) to determine the genetic status of human embryos. In the presented case we report an infertile couple with recurrent implantation failures (RIF). Karyotyping by Gbanding of cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed on both patients. After the analysis, in the male partner was detected heterochromatin polymorphism, karyotype-46, XY, 9qh+. After genetic counseling, PGD-A was used. For detection of chromosomal imbalances a laser-assisted biopsy was performed on blastocyst stage embryos followed by whole genome amplification (WGA) and next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. 6 embryos were biopsied and analyzed. None of the embryos was euploid. Various aberrations -from single to complex monosomies and trisomies, were detected. Due to the lack of an euploid embryo, transfer was not performed. This case report is a good example for the reproductive failures at carriers of chromosomal heterochromatin polymorphisms. NGS allows screening of all 24 chromosomes. It's effective, ensuring a high level of confidence in the results and subsequent selection of euploid embryos for transfer. ",

The fetus showed mild cerebral ventriculomegaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and a peculiar posture of the fingers without further abnormalities. Family history revealed that his 1.5 year old sister postnatally showed a fixed posture of the fingers and a general developmental delay but no diagnostics had been done so far. In order to exclude trisomy 18, the couple decided for amniocentesis. Array-analysis showed a gain of 14.7 Mb in the chromosomal region 3p25.1-p26.3 and a loss of 5.3 Mb in 6q27 not visible in conventional karyotype (GTG-banding, 400 bands). The sister clinically exhibits a striking similarity with features already described in partial trisomy 3p like hypertelorism, round face, short neck, down slanting palpebral fissures, psychomotor delay and behavioral problems. Chromosomal analysis and array-analysis were performed and revealed the same abnormalities as in the fetus. We therefore suspected a balanced translocation in one of the parents and indeed the mother carries a balanced reciprocal translocation (46,XX,t(3;6)(p25.1;q27)). Despite the clinical variability, the parents felt reassured because they did not experience their daughter as a handicapped child. Therefore, they decided to continue pregnancy. Our case illustrates, that minor findings in prenatal ultrasound and detailed family history may be crucial in prenatal diagnosis. Moreover, it stresses the importance of array-analysis in the prenatal setting. We postulate that genetic counselling should be offered early in pregnancy to all families with retarded children.",

RPL are defined as spontaneous and terminating at least two or more consecutive pregnancies, seen in 0.5-3% of all pregnancies. Damage in decidual tissue occuring with the effect of maternal antibodies, has a contribution of complement activation. Seventeen percent of women with at least 2 recurrent abortions and thirtyseven percent of those with more than 3 abortions were detected in idiopathic RPL patients having no autoimmune background. The complement system, is a first defense mechanism towards unwanted pathogens and host elements. Decay accelerating factor (DAF,CD55), MAC inhibitory protein (MAC-IP,CD59) and membrane co-factor protein (MCP,CD46) are major complement inhibitory proteins which are highly expressed in normal placenta. Herein, we had nine women with spontaneous abortion as our control group and seventeen women with RPL as our study group. TSH, T3, T4, and progesterone, also C3, C4 serum levels were determined. Since CD55, CD46 and CD59 of fetal trophoblast and maternal tissues are crucial to provide tissue homeostasis, we analyzed the expression of these genes using CFX real-time PCR setting. The statistical analysis according to average CT values were done through Qiagen GeneGlobe assay tool. As a preliminary finding of this research, CD55 expression level was reasonably elevated at decidual tissues of our cases compared to that of controls. Although, CD46 expression levels were different among two groups, the difference was not remarkable as CD55 expression (p>0.05).

CD patients generally die from respiratory distress. Together with the bone disease 75% of CD-patients show testicular dysgenesis leading to sex reversal.

Causative mutations in SRY, NR5A1 and DHH have been excluded by Sanger-sequencing before whole-exome-sequencing was performed and surprisingly revealed in both sisters homozygosity for undescribed variant c.1518C>G p.(Leu506Val) in SOX9.

We report two dichorionic/diamniotic twin pregnancies presenting with ultrasound anomalies affecting only one of the fetuses (fetus B). A chorionic villus sample (CVS) was obtained separately for each one of the fetuses, allowing individual analyses to determine possible chromosomal abnormalities. In both cases, samples were first analyzed by QF-PCR to detect possible common aneuploidies. In three of the fetuses, an X chromosome aneuploidy in mosaic form was detected. Additional analyses by conventional cytogenetics, QF-PCR and/or array were performed first in CVS and later in amniotic fluid (AF) samples in order to interpretate the results, detecting possible confined placental mosaicism and allowing a definitive diagnosis for each fetus. Detailed results and possible embryological interpretations are presented. Fetus Clinical and molecular characterization of rare chromosomal abnormalities helps to detect the candidate genes for congenital anomalies. Congenital ocular coloboma is a birth defect caused by abnormal development of the eye during embryogenesis. We report on a 33-year-old man with bilateral congenital coloboma of the iris at 6 o'clock. The patient has a high myopia and myopic astigmatism, BCVA of BE -0,7. Choroidal nevi of both eyes were also noticed. He has no other specific complaints as photophobia or nictalopia, the color vision is full. There were no dysmorphic signs or developmental issues. Chromosomal microarray analysis using the HumanCytoSNP-12v2.1 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was performed and revealed a 2.96 Mb in size deletion in the 16q23.1q23. 2 region, arr[GRCh37] 16q23.1q23.2 (78473430_81434676)\u00d71. The deleted region encompasses 12 protein-coding genes, including 5 disease-associated genes WWOX, MAF, GCSH, BCO1 and GAN. Three genes WWOX, GCSH and GAN are associated with autosomal recessive disorders. MAF is associated with Ayme-Gripp syndrome and various types of cataracts. BCO1 encodes beta-carotene oxygenase 1, which is a key enzyme in the production of vitamin A from carotenoids. Deficiency of this enzyme results in hypercarotenemia and secondary vitamin A deficiency. We speculate that haploinsufficiency of BCO1 may be related to congenital bilateral iris coloboma in our patient. Materials and methods: We report a 57-year-old Scandinavian woman of non-consanguineous Danish Caucasian parents presenting with vision loss and metamorphopsia. Ophthalmological examination revealed massive hard drusen on both eyes in the macular region and nasal to the disc as well as macular hyperpigmentation. Optical coherence tomography on the left eye showed partly affected foveal configuration with slightly increased foveal thickness. The patient was clinically diagnosed with DHRD/ML and followed annually with stable conditions. Ten years later reduced visual acuity primarily on the left eye and increased atrophy with subretinal fluid were observed. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) was administrated, but without effect. Family history revealed no other cases of reduced vision. Diagnostic next generation sequencing of seven genes (Amplexa FleckRet7 Panel) associated with flecked retina was performed at Amplexa Genetics using NovaSeq 6000. The mutation was verified by bidirectional Sanger sequencing.",

Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss is a heterogeneous disease where over 80 genes has been reported to be associated with. We examined a group of patients with early/prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in which we excluded pathogenic mutations in GJB2 gene. We examined 421 unrelated patients for deletions of STRC gene with quantitative comparative fluorescent PCR (QCF PCR) and 201 unrelated patients with next generation sequencing by custom designed NSHL gene panel. We discovered the disease cause in 54 patients, from which 43 we diagnosed with NSHL panel examination (21.4 %). The most frequent type of nonsyndromic hearing loss is DFNB16, caused by biallelic mutations in the STRC gene and detected to be a cause of hearing loss in 23 patients, almost half of the clarified patients (43%). The spectrum of STRC gene mutations was as follows; A) twelve patients were homozygotes for STRC gene deletion, B) eight were compound heterozygotes for STRC gene deletion and point inactivating mutation and C) three were compound heterozygotes for point inactivating mutations. Other biallelic pathogenic mutations were detected in genes MYO15A (six patients), LOXHD1 (five patients), TMPRSS3 (five patients), CDH23 (four patients), OTOG (two patients).

OTOG and OTOGL were identified as autosomal recessive hearing loss genes. Patient: We describe a 20-year old girl with moderate prelingual hearing loss. Whole exome sequencing showed a pathogenic nonsense mutation in the OTOG gene (c.2500C>T) and a partial gene deletion of the OTOGL gene (deletion exon . Additional Sanger sequencing of both genes did not show a second mutation in one of the genes. The father of the proband is the only family member with the same audiologic profile. Co-segregation between the hearing loss phenotype and the potential causative mutations was verified in all family members by Sanger sequencing. Father and daughter are the only family members with the combination of the OTOG and OTOGL mutation. Conclusions: We identified heterozygous mutations in OTOG and OTOGL in a girl and her father with prelingual hearing loss. OTOG and OTOGL show striking similarities in terms of structure, expression as well as clinical phenotype. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of possible biallellic inheritance of mutations in OTOG and OTOGL.",

There might be attractive perspectives for the treatment strategies for such group of patients not only because CLRN1 gene has only 6 exonsand mRNA is relatively short (2,39 kb) , but also because mutation is homogenous and includes only c.567T>G p.Tyr189* mutation in homozygous state. We report a patient with episodes of hypertensive crisis and lactic acidosis from infancy. These episodes were found to be related to hyperaldosteronism and ill treatable with conventional blood pressure medication. At four months old, she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and refractory seizures. She also has developmental delay compounded by multiple brain infarcts. She is treated with alpha-agonists and ACE-inhibitors and responds well. She is also receiving anticonvulsants and PDE inhibitors. WGS was performed for her in 2017 which identified a heterozygous missense variant, p.Asp897Asn, in the ATP1A1 gene (in the extracellular domain) that encodes for the Alpha-1 isoform of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, which helps establish electrochemical gradient over plasma membranes. In 2018 similar variants were described in the ATP1A1 gene in three children (all in the intramembranous domain). Their phenotype has been described as a new disease called hypomagnesemia, seizures and mental retardation 2 (MIM#618314) but none of these patients have hyperaldosteronism. Our patient has demonstrated mild hypomagnesemia as well as seizures and developmental delay. Interestingly, somatic ATP1A1 disease causing variants, have been found in aldosterone-producing adenomas. Additionally in 2018, variants in the gene were found to be a novel cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (all in the intracellular domain), so this gene can lead to multiple phenotypes, which could differ depending on the location of the variants in the domains of the protein. We propose that her episodes of hypertensive crisis and hyperaldosteronism may be an expansion of the phenotype or a novel additional phenotype related to this gene.

Chronic rhinosinusitis and bronchiectasis are very common in PCD patients. Recently, it has been shown the presence of taste receptors in the respiratory tract and the possible involvement of bitter taste receptor TAS2R38 gene, in susceptibility to respiratory infections and rhinosinusitis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of TAS2R38 polymorphisms in PCD patients and their possible correlations with clinical outcomes of the disease. Genetic and phenotypic data of 35 PCD patients were collected. Clinical evaluation includes: number of respiratory infections per year and pathogens; Lund McKay score; number of lung lobes involved; modified Bhalla score. As regards genetic data, 3 polymorphisms (rs1726866,rs713598, rs10246939) within TAS2R38 gene were analyzed and patients classified as PAV/PAV, PAV/AVI and AVI/AVI. A significant difference in the distribution of TAS2R38 haplotype between patients with and without neonatal respiratory distress emerged (p-value=0.01). In particular, a lower percentage of PAV/PAV individuals showed a high number of pulmonary exacerbations (\u2265 2/year) (p-value=0.04) compared to those with AVI/AVI and AVI/ PAV haplotypes. Moreover, no patients homozygous for PAV/PAV haplotype presented with any chronic colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa thus supporting the possible role of TAS2R38 in susceptibility to respiratory infections. In conclusion, here we report, for the first time, a possible association of TAS2R38 polymorphisms with PCD phenotype.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) are autosomal recessive disorders, associated with mutations in CFTR and SBDS genes respectively. CF and SDS have general symptom -exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This study aims to describe the possibility of misdiagnosis in case of conditions with common symptoms, such as CF and SDS. The first cohort of 94 patients aged from 0 to 40 years with primary SDS diagnosis were investigated for the presence of 30 CFTR gene mutations that are most frequent in Russian Federation. The second cohort of 361 patients with primary CF diagnosis was analyzed for the presence of 2 common SBDS gene mutations (this sample was divided into 2 groups: 246 probands aged from 0 to 5 years and 115 probands aged from 6 to 10 years). MLPA-method was used to determine point mutations; deletion/insertion mutations were tested by multiplex AFLP-method and automated sequencing as well. We identified one heterozygous carrier of F508del mutation in the CFTR gene in SDS sample (sequencing of the entire coding region of this gene and MLPA-analysis did not reveal a second pathogenic variant in this patient). In a group of 0-5 years CF patients 4 probands were found to have both mutations in the SBDS gene and one proband have 1 heterozygous mutation. In a group of 6-10 years CF patients only 1 proband had both mutations.

Environment and polymorphisms in other genes play a particularly important role in the phenotypic modification of disease. The main aim of our study was the correlation analysis of 10 SNP polymorphisms/variants in selected modifier genes (TNF\u03b1, GSTM, GSTP, GSTT and HFE) and subsequent correlation analysis with clinical symptoms of patients, mainly spirometry measurements of lung function. To identify these polymorphisms, we used methods such as PCR and direct sequencing. Our results show a significant association of the TNF\u03b1 gene polymorphism (rs1800629) with cardiomyopathy, another polymorphism (rs361525) with hypoalbuminemia and distal obstructive syndrome, and two other polymorphisms (rs1800630, rs1799724) with bacterial infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Results of previous research suggest that susceptibility to ACEi induced angioedema (ACEi AE) is dependent on a genetic predisposition and non-genetic risk factors. However, as the biological mechanisms contributing to these angioedema are still largely unknown, further research is needed. The aim of the present study was to investigate common and rare genetic variation in ACEi AE patients. In a targeted sequencing approach, we investigated the occurrence rate of known pathogenic mutations associated with monogenic forms of angioedema in 69 German and 68 Danish patients with ACEi AE. All samples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using single molecule molecular inversion probes. In addition, all samples were genotyped on the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array to identify common genetic variants contributing to angioedema risk under ACEi. Analysis of the sequencing data revealed no known pathogenic mutations in genes associated with the monogenic forms of angioedema. However, we identified 19 other rare (MAF\u22640.05), non-synonymous variants for which a contribution to ACEi AE risk cannot be excluded. Quality control and imputation of the array data is currently ongoing. Furthermore, we are currently applying the above investigation strategies to an independent Swedish sample (n=77). Follow-up of the variants identified by targeted sequencing in larger patient samples as well as subsequent biostatistics/-informatics analyses of the GWAS data will help to gain further insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of ACEi AE.",

The congenital contractural arachnodactyly has overlapping features with the Marfan syndrome. Both syndromes result from mutations in genes from the fibrillin family, FBN1 and FBN2 respectively. We identified the c.4216T>C variant in the FBN2 gene in a Polish family with the congenital contractural arachnodactyly. The variation in phenotypic expression was high in the family. In some subjects there was only an arachnodactyly, but in others there were many features like severe kyphoscoliosis with dolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, talipes equinovarus and ureteropelvic junction obstruction. We found for the first time a hydronephrosis in the congenital contractural arachnodactyly syndrome. There were no crupled ear in the analysed family. The c.4216T>C variant had been previously found in a Chinese family with modest family variation in phenotypic expression.

Hyperphalangism is caused by an accessory ossification center in the second metacarpo-phalangeal joint leading to radial deviation and ulnar clinodactyly of the index fingers. Individuals without one of the two major hallmarks or with additional hand malformations have been described as atypical or Catel-Manzke-like syndrome.

The third 8-cys domain covalently binds the small latent TGF\u03b21 complex. A proline -rich hinge region provides \u22efexibility to the protein. The N-terminus of LTBP4 binds to the microibrillar structures. A 4-monthold full term normally delivered neonate was referred with complaints of respiratory distress from his birth.

Length, weight, and head circumference percentiles at birth were 55cm, 4100 gr and 36m respectively. whole-exome sequencing test was done for the patient. The results showed a novel homozygous mutation (c.533-1G>A) in exon 6 of the LTBP4 gene. After this observation we perform the Sanger sequencing for his parents.

All those patients, displaying remarkable phenotypic variability, were compound heterozygous for variants in the MYH3 gene (Cameron-Christie et al., 2018) . We describe an 11 years-old male patient, born from non-consanguineous parents, with no relevant family history, whose phenotype was consistent with CPSKF1B, including arthrogryposis of the hips, knees and elbows, multiple pterygia, severe scoliosis and vertebral fusions at cervical, dorsal, lumbar and lumbosacral levels. At the age of 9 there was no radiological evidence of carpal synostosis. Additionally, he has triangular shaped face, low-set ears, bilateral down slanted palpebral fissures, ptosis, and micrognatia. Genetic analysis identified three heterozygous variants in MYH3 [NM_002470.3: c.5072del,p.(Ala1691-Valfs*52) in exon 35; c.749G>A,p.(Arg250Gln) and c.787G>T,p.(Asp263Tyr) in the same allele in exon 9]. Genetic testing of his parents identified the first of these variants in the mother and the others in the father, suggesting an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Introduction: craniofrontonasal dysplasia is a rare form of frontonasal dysplasia caused by mutations in the EFNB1 gene on the X chromosome. EFNB1 encodes for ephrin-B1, a transmembrane ligand of the EphB receptor with crucial roles in cell migration and pattern formation during skeletal development. The phenotype is more pronounced in females, who characteristically present with frontonasal dysplasia and coronar craniosynostosis, while the manifestation in males is usually milder, often only characterized by hypertelorism.",

Introduction: Ectodermal dysplasia is a rare hereditary disease that is characterized by elliptical nodules located on the hair shaft. Fragile hair fibers are found in the temporal and occipital region, resulting in alopecia. Patients are usually normal at birth, but the hair becomes fragile in the first few months of life. In severe cases, eyebrows, eyelashes, and other body hairs may also be affected. The disease can be isolated to the scalp, and may be accompanied by tooth and nail disorders. Ectodermal dysplasia is generally caused by mutations in KRT81, KRT83, KRT85 and KRT86 genes.",

According to the clinical picture and underlying genetic mutation 13 subtypes are distinguished. We saw our proband as a five year old girl with severe periodontitis and premature loss of several teeth. Moreover she displayed a short stature, joint hypermobility, chronic pain, recurrent luxation of knee caps, flat feet, a soft and hyperelastic skin with multiple subcutaneous papules, easy bruising, and pretibial hyperpigmentation. Due to those signs and symptoms EDS was suspected and genetic testing brought about. NGS analysis of 44 connective tissue-related genes revealed a pathogenic frameshift mutation in COL5A1, confirming the diagnosis Classical EDS. This diagnosis was consistent with the proband's joint and skin related phenotype, yet did not explain her severe dental phenotype. As the dental status was highly suggestive of periodontal EDS, analysis of the underlying genes C1R and C1S was performed. The detection of a pathogenic missense mutation in C1R confirmed the additional diagnosis periodontal EDS. Analysis of the parents showed the COL5A1 mutation being maternally inherited whereas the C1R mutation occured de novo. Our patient's mother experienced many signs of Classical EDS already in her childhood, yet this diagnosis was never suspected in her before it was confirmed in her daughter. Introduction: Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a non-inflammatory, autosomal connective tissue disorder. It is perhaps the most common hereditary connective tissue disorder with a prevalence estimate at about 1/5000. hEDS unlike other types of EDS, has no known genetic etiology. One of disfunctions in hEDS patients' cells is impaired transport of extracellular matrix proteins from cells to intercellular space. Protein taking part in this process is TANGO1 encoded by TANGO1 gene. The aim of study is a sequencing analysis of TANGO1 gene and also the evaluation of the potential role of detected variants in these gene on their role in the etiology of the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",

Introduction: Mutations in ACVR1 cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The classical clinical feature of FOP is progressive heterotopic ossification, but affected individuals often display first toe and thumb malformations. We report on a one year old patient with motor development delay, corpus callosum agenesis, bilateral hand deformities, hypospadias and bilateral agenesis of the first toes. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome had been suspected as the cause for limb malformations and hypospadias, and the child was referred to genetics in order to rule out or to confirm this diagnosis.",

Introduction: Brachydactyly is a bone development abnormality presenting with variable phenotype and different transmission patterns.

In total, fifty pathogenic mutations were associated with nine clinical phenotypes and autosomal dominant and recessive transmissions even for the same phenotype. Presentations range from severe defects in limb morphogenesis to conditions with redundant ossification.

Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is a complex hereditary musculoskeletal disorder diagnosed at either pediatric or adult age. HME is characterized by progressive exophytic osseous projections that form next to the growth plates of many skeletal elements, including long bones, ribs and vertebrae. In addition to pain and functional problems particular forehand deformities are main complaints of the patients in the clinics that the treatment is restricted to surgical excision of the lesions. The main complication is development of osteochondromas. Mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes that encode glycosyltransferases are responsible for the disease and represented locus heterogeneity. Nonetheless, genotype-phenotype interventions are still important we presented 20 HME cases among 9 families and discussed genotype-phenotype correlations. This project has been founded by Hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome (HHS) and hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC) are the clinical manifestations of a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by the inactivation of the fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3) or Klotho genes, which in turn leads to an elevated blood phosphate level resulting mainly from an excessive proximal renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. We report the case of a 5-year-old female of healthy non-consanguineous parents of German and Italian descent. She initially presented with recurrent lower leg pain. Bone biopsy was inconclusive, as well as infectious work-up. Imaging identified a diaphyseal sclerosis and hyperostosis of the ribs. Hyperphosphatemia was observed. Thus, panel diagnostics of the genes FGF23, GALNT3 and KL was performed. Two heterozygous variants in GALNT3 (NM_004482.3) were identified, one previously undescribed missense variant c.782G>A p.(Arg261Gln), classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Protein-modeling of this variant suggested the disruption of GALNT3 activity, leading to an increased inactivation of the phosphaturic hormone FGF23 causing HHS/HFTC. The second variant c.803dupC p.(Thr269Asnfs*3) was previously described in a HHS/HFTC patient and classified as likely pathogenic (ACMG guidelines). In HHS/HFTC, no genotype-phenotype correlation was described so far, and suggested treatment regimes are heterogeneous. Thus, in addition to the detailed case, we present an overview of genotypephenotype correlation and a collection of follow-up descriptions of disease courses on patients reported before 2015. In conclusion, we aim to raise awareness of HHS/ HFTC as a syndrome presenting primary with bone pain and radiographic changes.

Nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without palate (nsCL/P) and cleft palate only (nsCPO) are frequent congenital malformations with high heritability estimates. Common risk loci explain only some of their heritability. Rare, highly penetrant copy number variations (CNVs) encompassing possible clefting susceptibility genes might partially explain the missing heritability. Aim of this study was to identify such genes by detecting de novo CNVs from whole-exome sequencing (WES) trio data. CNVs were called from WES data of 50 nsCL/P and 43 nsCPO Central European patient/ parent trios using XHMM, CoNIFER and EXCAVATOR2. Defining XHMM as primary algorithm we established a filtering pipeline considering sample wide frequency, de novo status, calling intersection (CoNIFER and/or EXCA-VATOR2), annotation to RefSeq-genes, overlap with regions of segmental duplications and population frequency. CNVs were validated using qPCR. Three interesting de novo CNVs were identified: A 86kb deletion on Chr8 in an nsCL/P patient, a 16Mb deletion on Chr1 in an nsCPO patient, and an 877kb duplication on Chr2 in an nsCPO patient. Interesting candidate genes at these loci are LHX8, DLX1 and DLX2, all suggested to contribute to craniofacial development: Targeted mutations of Lhx8 in mice lead to an isolated cleft palate. In embryonic mice Dlx1 and Dlx2 are expressed in both the maxillary and the mandibular component of the first pharyngeal arches, and Dlx1/2 -/mutant mice exhibit a cleft palate. Our results indicate that rare highly penetrant CNVs can contribute nsCL/P and nsCPO risk. To achieve more evidence for our findings, replication studies in larger patient/control cohorts are essential. Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by cartilage degradation, hypertrophy and inflammation. Chondrocytes are the only cells normally found in cartilage, producing and maintaining the cartilaginous matrix. Chondrocyte hypertrophy is an essential process required for endochondral ossification in mammals and it is also plays a role in the development of OA. Furthermore, genetic factors have been found to be strong determinants of OA and are likely to operate via chondrocyte function. I previously identified some novel candidate murine genes with a potential role in OA pathophysiology. However, one of the candidate genes, Glis3, has showed a potential by expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes in OA knee joints obtained from the collaborative cross mouse model, using immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, this study has implicated several molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of cartilage degeneration, thus improving our understanding of OA and offering potential molecular targets for novel therapeutic approaches.",

Since birth, patient had seven spontaneous fractures, predominantly in the lower limbs. At the age of seven the patient exhibited disproportionately short-limb short stature with height measured 96 cm; <3rd percentile. The patient had brachydactyly and ligamentous laxity with deformity of the lower limbs. He also had characteristic radiological changes of pseudoachondroplasia: short tubular bones with widened and deformed metaphyses and vertebral anomalies. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry detected osteoporosis. Next generation sequencing was performed for the patient, OI genes and COMP gene known familial variant were analysed. It confirmed the same pathogenic variant of COMP gene and in COL1A2 gene two heterozygous variants were found (c.2317C>T, p.Pro773Ser and c.2329_2331delCGT, p. Arg777del). The former was considered to be variant of uncertain significance because in silico predictors assessed it as benign, while the latter was assigned to be likely pathogenic because computational predictors assessed it as pathogenic. None of these variants were described in population databases. Both of COL1A2 variants were found in father's COL1A2 gene, meaning that they locate in the same allele. It remains unclear if these variants are diseasecausing since neither of fathers' family members were affected with OI. Therefore, further sequencing of father's first-degree family members will be performed to confirm if these variants are truly de novo. In a large study on genetic causes of skeletal dysplasia we recognized a 17-year-old individual from healthy consanguineous parents with severe vertebral segmentation defects, rib and further non skeletal anomalies including solitary pelvic kidney, uterine dysgenesis, absence epilepsy and inner ear deafness. Performing WES we identified a homozygous missense variant c.59C>T, p.(Thr20Ile) in LFNG, neither previously described in SCDO3 patients, nor listed in genetic databases. Both parents were heterozygous.

As no other variants were identified neither in the exome nor in CMA we hypothesize that the phenotypic spectrum of this syndrome can be much broader, perhaps depending on the localization and nature of the affected variant, although we cannot exclude a blended phenotype due to an undetected additional variant. Steel syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the skeletal system causing a variety of manifestations. Sixteen individuals with Steel syndrome, mainly Puerto Ricans (11/16), were previously reported to carry bi-allelic mutations in the COL27A1 gene. Here, we present the first patient with Steel syndrome in Europe and the sixth non-Puerto Rican carrying a novel homozygous mutation in COL27A1. The patient is a 4-year-old boy born to non-consanguineous healthy parents, with dysmorphic facial features, absent hip ossification centres, external rotation of both feet, relatively short stature, mild skin syndactyly, short mid phalanges and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a novel homozygous missense variant [chr9.hg:19: g.116982108G>A; c.2409G>A; p.(Gly802Glu)] in COL27A1 (NM_032888.4). The homozygous mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband and carrier status was confirmed in both parents and his unaffected sibling. According to online and in-house minor allele frequency (MAF) databases, this is the first COL27A1 mutation reported in the European population. Additional screening of healthy Greek-Cypriot individuals was thus performed, which did not reveal any additional carriers in the population for the variant in question. To diagnose a specific lethal skeletal dysplasia purely based on ultrasound data can be quite challenging in a prenatal setting. However, molecular testing of fetal DNA in combination with radiographic evaluation and autopsy postdelivery usually allows the clinician to come up with a specific diagnosis. We report a case of platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type (PLSD-T) that was initially diagnosed as achondrogenesis type 1A. Advanced ultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation showed, in addition to generalized edema, shortened and curved long bones with a thoracic-AC ratio of 0.68. At 29 weeks of gestation a male neonate was born who died directly after birth. Achondrogenesis type 1A was initially suggested based on the ultrasound abnormalities and clinical examination postnatally. Radiographs showed skeletal abnormalities reminiscent of achondrogenesis type 1A: severe micromelia with flared and cupped metaphyses, relatively large head, short ilia and delayed vertebrae ossification. All genes (TRIP11, SLC26A2 and COL2A1) causing the different forms of achondrogenesis (IA;IB;II) were sequenced. In TRIP11, only heterozygosity for a class 3 variant was identified and no variant could be identified on the other allele. However, a class 4 variant p.(lle1 389dup), in COL2A1 was identified in the portion coding for the C-propeptide of type II collagen. This finding led to the diagnosis of PLSD-Torrance type. This case demonstrates the phenotypical overlap between achondrogenesis type 1A and Torrance dysplasia. Background: Overgrowth syndromes frequently share overlapping manifestations and are difficult to diagnose based on clinical features. Accurate diagnosis is important for prognosis and correct tumour surveillance program and can be achieved with next-generation sequencing.",

We describe a 53 year old male proband with a history of sudden death (maternal grandmother) and thoracic aortic aneurysm in the father. The proband bicycled regularly and experienced aborted cardiac arrest at the age of 52 during a normal daylight activity. ECG showed transient ischemic patterns with increased troponin-T values. A CT scan demonstrated a type A aortic dissection (AD) not involving coronary arteries, surgically corrected without complications. During the follow up, occasional seizures were observed, successfully treated with Levetiracetam. Ajmaline challenge test resulted negative, no arterial tortuosity neither signs of intracranial vessel involvement have been demonstrated by Angio MRI. The proband was studied with NGS including panels for Brugada syndrome, LQTS and AD genes. Only the c.1004C>T (p.Pro335Leu) heterozygous missense variant in the ACTA2 gene was found. Proband's only daughter is asymptomatic, negative at clinical evaluation and does not carry the paternal variant. No other relatives are available to date. The c.1004C>T (p.Pro335-Leu) in the ACTA2 gene is predicted to be \"pathogenic\" by several bioinformatics tools, but to date its clinical significance is still uncertain. This case suggests the importance to consider clinical history in VUS evaluation for specific conditions. Further studies are required to clarify the role of ACTA2 missense variants in type A aortic dissections. ",

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARV\u0421) is an inherited disease leading to fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricle and sudden cardiac death. Identification of mutation(s) in causative genes is one of the major diagnostic criteria of ARVC. Methods: Clinical, instrumental examination, medical and genetic counseling were performed for 70 ARVC probands (mean age 41,9 y. o.). Screening of 16 genes was performed by highthroughput semiconductor sequencing combined with Sanger sequencing. Potential role of genetic variants was evaluated according to ACMG criteria. Mutational spectrum of desmosomal and non-desmosomal genes in ARVC probands was studied in comparison with control group of 46 DCM probands. Results: Definite, borderline or possible ARVC diagnosis based on the Task Force Criteria of 2010 was established for 70 probands. Some patients in our cohort had signs of dilated/restrictive cardiomyopathy (N=17), LVNC (N=10), BrS patterns (N=4). Likely pathogenic genetic variants and VUCSes were identified in 46% of ARVC probands in desmosomal (PKP2, DSG2, DSP, DSC2, JUP) and non-desmosomal (LMNA, SCN5A, MYH7, MYBPC3, TTN, FLNC, LDB3) genes. Mutational spectrum of genes in ARVC probands with a predominance of variants in desmosomal genes (64%) was different from one in the DCM control group. Genetic variants in non-desmosomal genes prevailed in patients with ARVC overlapping phenotypes. Conclusion: Likely pathogenic genetic variants and VUCSes were identified in 46% of ARVC probands. Identification of mutations in desmosomal and non-desmosomal genes in addition to the deep phenotyping results allowed us to study the genetic heterogeneity of ARVC.

Almost all patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy develop abnormalities in heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, syncope, heart failure or an increased risk of sudden death. Among Emery-Dreifuss Xlinked myopathy belongs degenerative myopathy caused by mutation in EMD gene. Emerin is a member of the nuclear lamina-associated protein family and with other proteins takes part in membrane anchorage to the cytoskeleton. Emerin is a serine-rich protein and composed of three domains: nucleoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain and short lumenal domain.

We Introduction: The circadian rhythm regulates various physiological mechanisms, and its disruption can promote many disorders. Many cardiovascular events show morning circadian preferences, such as myocardial infarction (MI), dissection of aortic aneurysms, and stroke. Disturbance of endogenous circadian rhythms enhances the chance of MI, showing that circadian clock genes could have a crucial function in the onset of the disease. It was hypothesized that the polymorphisms of one nucleotide (SNP) in two circadian rhythm genes (CLOCK and ARNTL) could be associated with MI.",

This variant has not been previously reported in individuals with HCM. The MYBPC3 encodes for the Cardiac myosin-binding protein C. The MYBPC3 has a structural role as it is located in striated muscle sarcomere A-bands and binds myosin heavy chain in thick filaments and titin in elastic filaments causing muscle contraction. Pathogenic variants in the MYBPC3 gene account for approximately 15% of cases of familial HCM. The deletion that we detected leads to a frameshift resulting in an amino acid substitution of glutamic acid to serine at codon 989. Furthermore, due to the new reading frame, a stop codon can be detected 3 codons downstream, likely affecting the protein function because of a possible truncated protein form. The inheritance is autosomal dominant. No other known pathological or probably pathological variants associated to HCM were found.",

In our study, we isolated miRNAs from plasma of diabetic patients with and without cardio-vascular disease (CVD). The analysis included 6 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without CVD (control group) and 9 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD (target group). Following reverse transcription and subsequent real-time PCR analysis of an equal amount of baseline miRNAs, the following miRNAs were successfully analyzed: miR-16-5p, miR-155-3p, miR-155-5p,miR-210-3p, miR-221-3p miR-424-5p. The comparative analysis of expression showed a statistically significant increase in the expression of all these miRNAs in the target group compared to the controlsee table bellow. The highest level of increase was established for miR-155-5p (its target is ICAM-1with role in inflammation and in the regulation of vascular permeability, affected in atherosclerosis) and miR-424-5p (its target is HIF1Athe master transcriptional regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia). In conclusion, CVD risk assessment, supported by emerging circulating biomarkers, such as miRNAs, is important for stratifying high-risk individuals, optimizing treatment strategies, and enhancing our understanding of basic biology.

Introduction: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the main health problems in Kazakhstan, which requires heart transplantation (HT) to extend the patient's life. The popular treatment of CHF is the implantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) which extends patient's life before HT. However, LVAD causes risk of thrombosis and bleeding in cardiac patients. Patients are normally prescribed with an antithrombotic therapy to prevent risks of thromboembolism. The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients for genetic variants responsible for risk of thrombosis: MTHFR (*1) and MTHFR (*2).",

Genes responsible for development known diseases: OPA3, AUH, TAZ, DNAJC19. One of the diagnostic methods of MGA is an analysis of the spectrum of organic acids in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, as there are biomarkers of the disease -3methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acid increase is characteristic. Materials and methods: in our center there are 3 children with an atypical form of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a description of one clinical case. The child is 3 years old, applied with poor weight gain, a slight speech development delay, poor physical exercise tolerance. At an early age -regurgitation, lack of body weight. The diagnosis has not been established. Examination has revealed diffuse hypotension, asthenia, phenotypically signs of connective tissue dysplasia, Laboratory studies: increased transaminases, increased lactate level, hepatosplenomegaly. According to clinical criteria -mitochondrial Nijmegen disease. Diagnostic assessment (Wolf NI, Smeitink JA. Mitochondrial disorders) in a child confirmed mitochondrial pathology. As the boy grew, there was an increase of clinical symptoms: increased weakness, fatigue, muscle hypotension, hypomimia. GC-MS in dynamics: titer 3metylglutaric and 3-metylglutaconic increase, MRS-confirmed mitochondrial neurocyte activity.

Its incidence is high in Turkey, because of the frequent consanguineous marriage and manifesting heterozygotes. The most common clinical diagnosis is kidney involvement. Corneal form occurs later. Some cases are diagnosed with photophobia, halo and glare style visual findings, depending on the density of corneal crystals. Spindle-and fusiform-shaped corneal crystals were detected in our patient and his sister. Sequencing of CTNS gene was performed on a MiSeq (Illumina). VCF files were analyzed by Variant studio (Illumina) and Geneticist Assistant (SoftGenetics) Software. Sequence variant classification was done according to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines. Detected variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our patient with corneal cystinosis has the compound heterozygosity of c.589G\u02c3A (p.G197R)(p. Gly197Arg) /c.1015G\u02c3A (p.G339R)(p.Gly339Arg) mutations, correlated with cystinosis and his daughter is a heterozygote for c.1015G\u02c3A (p.G339R)(p.Gly339Arg) mutation, correlated specifically with nephropathic cystinosis. As expected, his mother is a heterozygote for c.589G\u02c3A (p.G197R)(p.Gly197Arg) mutation and his father is a heterozygote for c.1015G\u02c3A (p.G339R)(p.Gly339Arg) mutation.

Our objective was to study the allelic and genotypic frequencies of genetic variants that have shown a strong association with CVD in diabetic patients with and without cardiovascular complications and to assess the additional contribution of genetic variation in determining the risk for such complications. We have used CVD Stri-pAssay kit (Vienna Lab) based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse hybridization. The following mutations were studied: FV G1691A (Leiden), FV H1299R (R2), Prothrombin G20210A, Factor XIII V34L, \u03b2-Fibrinogen -455 G-A, PAI-1 4G/5G, GPIIIa L33P (HPA-1), MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, ACE I/D, Apo B R3500Q, Apo E2/E3/E4. 36 diabetic patients divided in 2 groups were analyzed: 1) 20 diabetic patients with CVD and 2) 16 diabetic patients without CVD. Results: We found higher than population frequency for the following alleles/ genotypes -5.5% for FV Leiden allele, 9.7% for FVR2 allele, 38.9% for \u03b2-Fibrinogen genotype -455G/A, 58.9% for PAI-1 4G allele, 36.1% for ACE D/D genotype. Statistically higher frequency was established for \u03b2-Fibrinogen -455 G-A in the patients with CVD compared to non-CVD (55% vs. 18.7%). Conclusion: We detected high frequency of \u03b2-Fibrinogen -455 G/A genotype in diabetic patients, especially in these with CVD. Based on its pro-inflammatory role and its connection to possible thrombotic events, patients would benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.

By chromosomal microarray analysis we now identified a similar microdeletion in three family members presenting with variable speech, language and neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

At age 10 years he attended a school for children with special needs and presented with microcephaly, attention deficits and slurred speech. His sister was referred at age 3 years with normal first milestones but a delay in speech development. Linguistic testing revealed impairment of all language and speech levels with limited vocabulary and slurred and imprecise pronunciation. The mother had attended a school focusing on speech and language deficiencies and now presented with slurred speech. Segregation analysis in the healthy, maternal grandparents did not detect the microdeletion, thus indicating de novo occurrence in the mother. The deletion contains 17 genes and is located in close proximity to the 3' end of FOXP2, but not including it.

It is caused by homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the GRID2 gene, encoding an ionotropic glutamate receptor. So far, seven affected individuals from three unrelated families have been reported. The disorder is characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, severely impaired gait due to progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular movement abnormalities, and progressive cerebellar atrophy in brain imaging. By trio exome sequencing, we now identified a novel homozygous variant (c.568C>T; p. Gln190*) in GRID2 in a four year old female patient from a consanguineous Iraqi family. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers. The patient was born after uneventful pregnancy and showed early-onset severe delayed psychomotor development. At the age of 4 years, she does not sit, walk or speak and presents with severe muscular hypotonia. Further clinical characteristics are a distinct truncal and appendicular progressive ataxia and binocular vertical nystagmus with a high frequent horizontal component, central hearing loss and incomplete loss of sight. She does not fix objects or interacts with people. She is dystrophic with a weight under the third percentile of the central European standard. Eating hair and gnashing of teeth are striking behaviors. In addition, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebellar hypoplasia. Our findings further delineate the mutational and clinical spectrum of GRID2 associated spinocerebellar ataxia type 18. De novo variants in HECW2, which encodes the HECT, C2 and WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, were initially identified in large exome sequencing (ES) studies. A series of seven patients clearly associated HECW2 with a neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, seizures and absent language (OMIM #617268) in 2017. Since then only two novel case reports have been published. We present the genotype, phenotype and developmental trajectory of a new patient, and review all previous cases. The 8-year-old boy has hypotonia, microcephaly, failure to thrive, severe intellectual disability, absent speech, and seizures. His facial features include prominent upper lip and strabismus. Trio ES identified de novo variant Chr2(GRCh37):g.197106886C>T, NM_001348768.1(HECW2):c.3572G>A, p.(Arg1191Gln). The variant has been reported in three previous patients, and is considered causal for the HECW2 syndrome. The phenotype of the patient fits the previous cases; however, he also has a ventricular septum defect, and he neither has abnormal brain MRI findings nor requires gastrostomy tube feeding. Long-term follow-up shows regression of motor skills around 12 months, abnormal EEG findings since 14 months (prompting anti-epileptic therapy), and self-injurious behaviour and sleep disturbances since 45 months of age. Our analysis (including variants from large studies and databases) indicates that deleterious missense HECW2 variants cluster in exons encoding the HECT domain and its adjacent region (exons 20-29, with residues Arg1191, Arg1330 and Glu1445 being the hotspots), and possibly also the WW2 domain (exons 12-13). Concurrently, these regions are deserts for missense variation in normal individuals. Introduction: Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS) OMIM # 239300), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, seizures, cardiac abnormalities, developmental delay and elevated alkaline phosphatase.

In 2017, heterozygous variants in EBF3 are described for the first time by three parallel publications in 2017 as causative for HADDS (Chao et al., 2017 , Harms et al., 2017 , Sleven et al., 2017 . At present, 23 patients with different types of mutations including missense, frameshift or nonsense mutations as well as variants affecting conserved splice elements are reported. All reported cases showed a heterogenous phenotype. We report on a case of a 3-year old girl with a class 5-mutation in EBF3, detected by Next-Generation-Sequencing. She presented with delayed development, microcephaly, ataxia, reflux, and feeding difficulties. She also showed a thermoregulatory dysfunction, which was not observed in other affected individuals so far.

The family history revealed no epilepsy or other relevant neurological or genetic diseases. An MRI scan of the brain revealed a severe myelination defect with white matter abnormalities. Genetic diagnostic workup included: cytogenetic analysis, array-CGH and NGS-based panel diagnostics for familial focal epilepsies, extended regarding GFAP. NGS identified a likely pathogenic mutation in GFAP (c.235C>G (p.Arg79Gly) heterozygous). To our knowledge this specific mutation has been reported in only one patient suffering from Alexander disease (AxD) (Gorospe et al., 2002) . AxD is a very rare neurodegenerative disease which belongs to the leukodystrophies. Patients with AxD have unspecific symptoms like progressive motor and intellectual retardation, developmental regression and multiple other neurological symptoms including seizures. In most cases gain-of-function mutations in GFAP encoding the glial fibrillary acidic protein underlie this disorder, which result in the accumulation of the variant protein in astrocytes, then called Rosenthal fibers. The exact cellular pathogenesis remains unknown. Only about 500 cases of AxD have been reported worldwide. Survival time depends on the age at onset of AxD, a median of 14 years was found in a larger cohort (Prust et al., 2011) .

We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients.

A total of 21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIM genes. Besides well-described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarely reported in patients with ASDs were identified (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1, CHRNA7); thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes.

Brain malformations (BMs) encompass a large spectrum of disorders with various genetic etiologies, anatomic abnormalities, and clinical features. We report on the results of a study focused on diagnosis and clinical management of BMs in a Romanian pediatric population. One hundred and twenty patients with BMs and complex phenotype were selected from those referred for developmental delay and/or epilepsy, between 2010-2019, to our departments. General clinical examination, neurologic, dysmorphologic, psychiatric/psychologic evaluations and brain imaging studies were performed for all the children. Genetic investigations included array based comparative genomic hybridization (Agilent Technologies), and classical and molecular cytogenetics. Gyration anomalies, corpus callosum defects, cerebellar malformations, and heterotopia, isolated or in different combinations, associated with complex clinical presentations were detected in our patient group. Genomic imbalances, 4 deletions and 3 duplications, were detected in 7 patients. Syndromic regions (17p13.3, 1q21.1, 1q43-q44, 22q11.2) were prevalent in our study group; however, some of these regions are known to be clinically heterogeneous, thus our patients might contribute to further delineation of the phenotypic spectrum. In our study group, chromosomal defects were detected with a high incidence in patients with BMs as part of complex phenotypes. Epileptic seizures and/or developmental delay were the most common clinical features.

Neuroinflammatory mechanisms may be involved in the genesis of epilepsies and autistic spectrum disorders. An NGS study with TrueSightOne gene panel was performed on 30 patients with neurological disorders (including seizures as a main component). In 10 patients pathogenic/ probably pathogenic mutations were discovered. We have performed comprehensive study of HLA gene variants discovered by NGS after lack of pathogenic mutations in patients affected by epilepsy with or without autism/mental retardation and compared with patients with other pathologies (referred as controls). We focused on variants annotated as Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS). We determined the frequency of such variants in DRB1 and DRB5, in cases and controls, as they were the most commonly found in both groups. The frequency varied between 11-15% in cases and 11-23% in controls. In addition, we reported variants found only in cases(5 variants in DRB5 and 1 in DRB1), only in controls (7 in DRB5 and 10 in DRB1) and both in cases and controls (5 in DRB5 and 6 in DRB1). We found 2 HLA-DMB and 2 HLA-G variants only in cases. This is a pilot study of the involvement of HLA class II gene variants in neurological disorders and it will be followed by the analysis of these individual variants' role. Epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are a group of devastating disorders caused by epileptic activity; resulting in deterioration in developmental, cognitive and motor functions. The number of genes identified as being responsible for EEs has been increasing rapidly. However, despite a comprehensive molecular analysis, a molecular diagnosis can only be established in 50% of cases. The aim of this project is to use whole exome sequencing to determine the molecular etiology of EEs in molecularly undiagnosed patients with a pedigree suggestive of an autosomal recessive single gene disease. Three EEs families, having either consanguineous parents of an affected individual and/or having more than one affected offspring were enrolled in the project. Prior to this project, the families had been evaluated using a next generation sequencing panel which included 16 EE genes; however, no molecular diagnosis could be established. In 5 cases from the 3 selected EEs families in our study genetic etiology was investigated using WES, with segregation analysis then being performed using Sanger sequencing. All patients in the study group had infantile onset epileptic seizures and severe developmental delay. WES revealed biallelic disease causing mutations in DENDD5A, GRN and TBCD genes in Family 1, Family 2 and Family 3, respectively. In each family, the identified variants associated with the disease were segregated. Reverse phenotyping supported the molecular analysis. In conclusion, this study provides a valuable contribution to the genotype-phenotype relationship by determining rare epilepsy syndromes in a previously undiagnosable patient group. WES provides a useful diagnostic alternative; particularly in consanguineous families.",

The type and location of the alteration of the PRNP gene may have an important role in the determination of the phenotype, which makes the genetic counselling challenging. Autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia (ARAN-NM) has been recently shown to result from histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene mutations. It accounts for around 10% of recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in European populations. A single case has been reported to date in the Greek population. We presently report a case-series of 3 Greek patients with ARAN-NM identified during screening of undiagnosed recessive axonal CMT cases with a combination of whole-exome and Sanger sequencing. Patient 1 was a 19 year-old female presenting with walking difficulty at the age of 8 years. She gradually developed lower limb atrophies and at 15 years old was also diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy. On EMG she showed motor axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia. She was compound heterozygous for mutations c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) and c.250T>C (p.Cys84Arg) in HINT1. Patient 2 was a 20 yearold woman presenting with walking difficulties at the age of 14 years. She gradually developed foot drop and upper limb distal weakness. On EMG she showed a motor axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia. She was homozygous for the c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) mutation in HINT1. Patient 3 was a 49 year-old male presenting with walking difficulties at the age of 15 years. He gradually developed foot drop and upper limb distal weakness. On EMG he showed a predominantly motor axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia. He was homozygous for the c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) mutation in HINT1. We conclude that HINT1-related CMT may be relatively common in Greece and should be further systematically screened for in appropriately selected populations.",

The patient manifested intractable epileptic seizures from the age of 1 year; there was no significant psychomotor development. She died at the age of 21 years. A heterozygous de novo missense variant, c.1210G>C (p.(Val404-Leu)), was detected in KCND2, the gene encoding Kv4.2, a major pore-forming subunit in somatodendritic subthreshold A-type potassium current (ISA) channels. The variant has not been described in the literature or in disease-and population-specific variant databases. It leads to the exchange of an evolutionarily highly conserved residue in the S6 transmembrane segment which is part of the channel's central pore for ion permeation. All 11 applied in silico prediction algorithms categorized the variant as deleterious. In a previous report on KCDN2 as a disease gene, a monozygotic twin pair with epilepsy and developmental delay carried a heterozygous de novo missense variant affecting the same residue (Lee et al., PMID: 24501278 We report a normally developing 10-years-old girl suffering from chronic headaches without neurological symptoms.

In this paper, we evaluated the effect of the RS1 locus in the AVPR1A gene, in the formation of personal characteristics in 121 individuals of Yakut men, and also conducted a comparative analysis of the frequency distribution of alleles and genotypes. The study revealed the involvement of the polymorphic marker RS1 in the formation of such personal traits as \"avoidance of damage\" and \"dependence on reward\". The data obtained indicate a modulating effect of ethnicity on identifying associations of the AVPRA1 gene with personality traits. The frequencies of RS1 alleles differed in Yakut (Asian) volunteers compared to white (Finland, Ireland, Israel), and European white populations had a higher range of GATA track diversity. We identified seven different alleles of the RS1 marker. At the same time, short and long alleles (R8, R14, R15, R16) were absent in our sample in homozygous form. The Yakut population is characterized by a pronounced deficit of heterozygotes and a low level of actual heterozygosity, which can be explained by the founder effect in the Yakut population.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the disease are variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying results on prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to find PTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of this syndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the first PTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe. This is also the largest pediatric cohort for PTEN prevalence study in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Materials and methods: PTEN sequencing were done for 128 patients with ASD and head circumference size more than 97% on growth charts between the ages of 3 to 18 recruited from five different child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in Turkey. Result: We found 2 known pathogenic, 1 new pathogenic and 2 variants of insignificance (VUS) mutations out of 128 patients. The prevalence is 2,3% (VUS mutations are excluded). Conclusion: We recommend PTEN testing in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Grant for this study is awarded by Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease and the most common inherited ataxia worldwide. Its pathogenic mutation is an abnormal expansion of the CAG repeats over 55 triplet-repeats within the ATXN3 gene which encodes for an excessively long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease protein ataxin-3. Patients show a widely spread variation in age at onset and clinical variability of phenotype. Until today this phenomena is not fully explained. In the past, it was shown that the age at onset inversely correlates with the expanded CAG repeats. Within the wide range of age at onset between 5-75 years only 45-60% can be explained by the CAG repeat expansion.",

Several of the genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, IFIH1, ADAR, SAMHD1) mutations can cause AGS. The syndrome can be seen as autosomal dominant/recessive. Generally, the onset of AGS occurs within the first few days or months of life. In our case, the most severe neonatal form of AGS1 is typically due to mutation in the TREX1 gene. In addition to our patient, SPTAN1 gene mutation was detected. This gene mutation can cause Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 5 which inherited autosomal dominant. We thought that the common point of the two mutations might be severe epilepsy and cerebellar atrophy for our patient. Her epileptic attacks started at about 4 months of age. On the physical examination microcephaly, joint stiffness, dystonia, abnormal eye movements, tetraplegic spasticity, and neuromotor developmental retardation were presented. In cranial MR, cerebral atrophy, intracerebral calcifications, and calcifications of the periventricular area were observed. Epilepsy attacks started at the age of 3 months. We performed RNASEH2B gene sequence analysis in the patient and could not detect a mutation. We detected two mutations with whole-exome sequencing. One of them was homozygous c.13_15dupATC mutation in the TREX gene and the other was heterozygous c.2882 C> T in the SPTAN1 gene. AGS is a very rare disease of unknown frequency.

A higher proportion of men develop symptoms, most women with the pathogenic variant are asymptomatic. This could be explained by the presence of polymorphisms in the TTR gene that modulate disease expression as well as clinical symptoms. This is a very interesting field of study that will allow us to better understand the disease. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. In 5-10% of cases, a family history is identified. Although the incidence of ALS in the Faroes is similar to other European countries, we have observed an overrepresentation of cases originating from the small geographically isolated island of Su\u00f0uroy, which lead to the study aim: estimation of familial ALS in the Faroese population. All ALS cases have been registered since 1987. In this study, 43 patients were included. First, familial ALS was recognized when occurring between firstor second-degree relatives. Secondly, the Faroese Multi Generation Register, which contains information about familial relationships since 1650, was used to construct pedigrees amongst patients to identify risk families (\u22653 cases within 3 generations). Fifteen cases originated from Su\u00f0uroy where the prevalence of ALS was more than 3 times higher than the nationwide prevalence. Six patients had familial ALS (13.9%) of which four originated from Su\u00f0uroy. Through pedigrees, we identified six additional patients with possible familial ALS (28%). This study is suggestive of familial clustering in excess of expected for ALS in Su\u00f0uroy and the proportion of familial ALS in the Faroe Islands was high. High levels of inbreeding and genetic substructure have been demonstrated in the Faroese population. Combined with these results, there is strong support of a genetic contribution to ALS in the Faroe Islands and further genetic studies are warranted. Results: After the targeted MPS sequencing, a definite molecular diagnosis defined as a pathogenic or a likely pathogenic variant, was reached in 16% of cases (n = 7). Variants of unknown significance were found in 16% of cases (n = 7). 68% (n=29) of cases were molecularly undiagnosed. In most cases variants were found in the SH3TC2(5) and MFN2(3) genes. 6 patients had variants in the following genes: MPZ, GDAP1, HINT1, LITAF, PRX, MORC2.",

In this case, it is aimed to present the first clinical report of MPV17-related axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with compound heterozygous mutation. The patient was a 16-yearold male and these second child of healthy, consanguineous parents. He had severe distal muscle atrophy, pes cavus deformity, foot drop, hammertoes, atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and bilateral thenar and hypothenar muscles. Hyporeflexia of upper limbs was observed. The first symptom of the patient was the loss of balance and walking difficulty starting at the age of six. c.122G> A and c.376-9T> A mutations in the MPV17 gene was detected by whole-exome sequencing. The MPV17:c.122G>A variant has already been described as a pathogenic variant. The MPV17:c.376-9T> A variant described as a variant of uncertain significance. To the best of our knowledge, the coexistence of these two heterozygous mutations was not found in the literature review. In this case report, we emphasize that a novel compound heterozygous MPV17 mutation can cause non-syndromic peripheral axonal neuropathy and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of juvenile-adult onset severe axonal sensorimotor neuropathy. Material and Methods: A clinical case of LGMD 2E in a 9 year old child. Clinical, genealogical, laboratory and instrumental and molecular-genetic methods were used.",

Additionally, upslanting palpebral fissures and preauricular skin tag are important phenotypic findings of our patient that were not reported before. Monosomy 1p36 is characterized by variable size deletions, while the phenotypic features include intellectual disability, developmental delay, distinctive facial dysmorphic features, hypotonia, seizures, cardiac defects, hearing impairment and ophthalmologic problems. Herein we present a patient with 1p36 deletion syndrome. The girl was born with muscular VSD and the Pierre Robin sequence. She was operated due to the Pierre Robin at the early age and got tracheal canulla up to 3 years of age. MRI of the neuroaxis later revealed the syrinx of the spine. She has distinctive facial features including microbrachycephaly, deep-set eyes with straight eyebrows; midface hypoplasia with broad, flat nose and philtrum. Ears are low-set, rotated backwards and abnormally shaped. Compared to other described cases, her chin is rather small. There are no abnormalities of gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia. She is hypotonic, with severe intellectual disability, refractory epilepsy and temper tantrums; having vision, hearing and speech problems. Array CGH analysis using SurePrint G3 Human CGH 8x60K microarray revealed 4.3 Mb loss in the region 1p36.33-p36.32. Deletion was confirmed with FISH analysis using subtelomeric 1p probe, and a karyotype was designated as 46,XX,del(1)(p36.32)dn. Cytogenetic analysis of parental peripheral blood revealed normal female karyotype in mother and a 46,XY,inv(10)(p11.2q21.2) karyotype in father, while FISH analysis showed normal distribution of signals characteristic for subtelomeres 1p in both parents.

Introduction: Haploinsufficiency of HNRNPK, which encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, has recently been identified as cause of Au-Kline syndrome (MIM #616580). Major findings include muscular hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, cardiac, urogenital and skeletal abnormalities, and a characteristic facial gestalt. With one exception, all patients with Au-Kline syndrome published so far have loss-of-function mutations. There is only a single patient with a de novo missense variant (p.L155P) which is located in KH2, the second of three K-homology RNA-binding (KH) domains of HNRNPK which ensure sequence-specific RNA and DNA binding. Due to the limited number of patients, the phenotypic consequences of missense variants in HNRNPK remain to be defined.",

The 10 year-old girl has severe global developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, cleft palate, a branchial cyst, hydronephrosis, vertebral segmentation anomalies and facial dysmorphism. Based on the clinical phenotype Au-Kline syndrome was suspected and confirmed by Sanger sequencing which revealed a de novo missense variant c.146C>T, p. L49P in HNRNPK [NM_0021404]. This variant affects a moderately conserved amino acid, locates to KH1, the first K-homology RNA-binding domain of HNRNPK, is not listed in GnomAD and is predicted to be pathogenic by in silico tools. Together with the typical clinical phenotype this strongly suggests that the variant is disease-causing. Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare, pleiotropic ciliopathy caused by mutations in 21 genes. BBS 12 gene mutations are responsible for 5-6% from molecular diagnosed cases. Clinical spectrum is highly variable in-and between families. The main features are: rod cone dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, cognitive impairment, renal anomalies and urogenital malformations. We report on a new case of BBS caused by BBS12 mutation. The 7 years old girl is the first child, born at 42 weeks from healthy, unrelated, gypsy parents. Physical parameters at birth were normal. Post axial polydactyly in all four members, brachydactyly and 2-3 fingers syndactyly, were noted. Last physical exam reveals macrocephaly (OFC >2SD), obesity (weight >6SD), dysmorphyc features, rod cone dystrophy, genital malformations, severe intellectual disability, and behavior abnormalities (self aggressive behavior, hyperkinesia, food intake abnormalities). Over the last year, renal dysfunction and hypertension have occurred. Clinical diagnosis was established due to presence of more than four primary features included in consensus criteria. Molecular genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis, identifying an homozygous nonsense mutation in BBS12 gene (c.1063C>T; p.Arg355*). The mutation was reported first in 2007 in two French gypsy families. Later, other two patients were reported. Our patient brings new evidence in the phenotype caused by this rare mutation. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relation. Albeit there is a little experience in predicting the phenotype severity taking into account the mutational load, an early clinical and molecular diagnosis may be helpful for a good management of these patients. Introduction: Basel-Vanagaite-Smirin-Yosef syndrome (BVSYS) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delay and variable congenital anomalies, caused by variants in the MED25 gene.

Our report is a valuable contribution in expanding molecular and clinical spectrum of CDK10 encodes a protein kinase which interacts with cyclin to form a heterodimeric protein kinase that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular growth, ciliogenesis and primary cilium elongation. Bi-allelic loss-of-function CDK10 mutations have been recently reported associated with a distinct disorder, named Al-Kaissi syndrome, described so far in only 10 patients from 6 distinct families. We report the case of a 5-year-old boy with a complex phenotype: growth retardation, global developmental delay with absent speech, thin corpus callosum and paucity of white matter visible at the brain MRI, vertebral anomalies and a typical facial appearance (triangular face, bilateral epicanthic folds, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, small chin); besides these features, our patient was born with ostium secundum atrial septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis. Array-CGH and CHD7 molecular analysis were normal. Trio whole exome sequencing (WES) disclosed a homozygous splice site variant in the CDK10 gene. Our patient's phenotype resembles the clinical features described in patients affected by Al Kaissi syndrome, except for the congenital heart defect (CHD): none of the patients with the same mutation as our case were reported to have any heart anomalies; to date, only one patient with Al-Kaissi syndrome showed patent ductus arteriosus. The WES analysis excluded further variants of the genes described in association with heart malformations and therefore our case is likely to allow us to expand the clinical phenotype of a syndrome which is not yet fully characterised. Developments in the genomic era and large-scale exome/ genome sequencing studies have identified mutations in several members of the CHD (Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein) gene family in neurodevelopmental disorders. Especially the group III CHD family consisting of CHD6, CHD7, CHD8 and CHD9 has well-documented roles in transcription regulation, impacting in organogenesis. These four enzymes are similar in their constituent domains. While mutations in the CHD2 and CHD8 have been linked to autism and intellectual disability. Additionally, CHD7 has been found to be associated with CHARGE syndrome which is a well-known congenital malformation syndrome. Here in this report, we present a case having intellectual dysability, autism and several congenital anomalies and a de-novo nonsense mutation in CHD8 gene as a possible cause of the clinical phenotype. A 5,5 year-old boy with macrocephaly, autism, intellectual disability and congenital anomalies including severe hypospadias, ventricular septal defect, inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, anal atresia and hemivertebrae(T12) was referred to our department. He has also been treating for hypothyroidism. Trio whole exome sequencing(WES) was performed, and a de-novo heterozygous nonsense c.727C>T(p.Arg243*) mutation in the first exon of CHD8 was detected and it was found to be likely pathogenic according to ACMG 2015 criteria. We consider that the mutation found in the patient could be responsible for a congenital malformation syndrome similar to CHARGE syndrome, causing a disruption in CHD7-CHD8 complex. Further functional analysis is planned. As a conclusion, mutations in CHD8 gene, especially disrupting CHD7-CHD8 complex, could be responsible for a congenital malformation syndrome similar to CHARGE.",

Next generation sequencing was performed to sequence close to 100 million reads on Illumina Sequencer. In this test, point mutations and micro-insertion/deletions and duplication (<20bp) can be simultaneously detected. A large homozygous deletion around following region was predicted: chr11:653904-710516, about 56600 bp, including genes: TMEM80, EPS8L2, DEAF1. DEAF1 gene acts as a regulator of transcription. Activity of this protein is important in the regulation of embryonic development. Mutations in this gene have been found in individuals with cognitive disability. EPS8L2 is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with EPS8L2 include Deafness. TMEM80 is target gene of DEAF1 and decreased mRNA levels were observed for Tmem80 throughout the brain of DEAF1 knockout mice. Clinical manifestations were seen in involved sibs appeared as a result of dysfunction of deleted genes individually and interaction with other related genes. Holoprosencephaly (HPE; MIM# 236100) is the most frequent congenital brain malformation (1 in 10,000 live births, 1 in 250 conceptuses). It results from incomplete midline division of the prosencephalon between 18 th and 28 th day of gestation, affecting both the forebrain and the face. The clinical spectrum is very wide, ranging from severe HPE with a single cerebral ventricle and cyclopia to clinically unaffected carriers in familial HPE. The full spectrum of HPE includes also microforms characterized by midline defects, with cleft lip/palate, hypotelorism, coloboma and/or single maxillary median incisor (SMMI). HPE is phenotypically and genetically heterogenous and was previously considered as a dominant disease with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. From the use of High Throughput Sequencing Technologies, it emerges that the penetrance and the phenotypic variability have digenic or oligogenic origin. To date, at least 18 genes are implicated in HPE and are all associated with key pathways of forebrain development including sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Interestingly, among these genes, DISP1 appears to have a specific mode of inheritance. DISP1 is a positive factor necessary for efficient secretion of the SHH morphogen and thus the establishment of its concentration gradient along the midline of the neural tube. We describe the clinical characteristics of three families with severe HPE or microform associated to compound heterozygous variants in DISP1. We will review the literature and discuss the genotype-phenotype correlations. Introduction: The array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is now recognised as a first tier diagnostic test for patients with wideranging phenotypes and has led to greater sensitivity in the detection of sub-microscopic genomic changes and pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs).",

Subsequently, another female patient was identified with a homozygous missense variant in GNB5 (NM_016194.3:c.920T>G/p.L370R) through whole exome sequencing (WES). Furthermore, this patient also has a homozygous missense variant in MCCC1 (c.1394C>T p.T465I) that represents 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency. The 3-MCC deficiency was confirmed enzymatically. Another heterozygous Hemoglobin E variant of codon 26 (GAG>AAG) [HBB c.79G>A] that represents HbE trait was also identified, consistent with patient's clinical presentation of splenomegaly. We therefore conducted a deep phenotypic analysis to segregate the contribution of each genetic variant with a focus on her ocular phenotype which involves high myopia. We also set out to study the impact of the GNB5 variants on gene expression, translation and protein-protein interaction using primary fibroblast culture from the patient. With increased use of WES in genetic diagnosis, more patients are found to have multiple molecular variants in syndromes with overlapping phenotypes.

Diagnosis, early detection of the syndrome and good management make possible of normal life of the patient. Introduction: We present a case of delayed diagnosis of a mixed gonadal dysgenesis in a 53 old woman. Case presentation: The patient had short stature (150cm), obesity, coarse facial features, mild male pattern hair loss, primary amenorrhea and borderline intellect. Her short stature and primary amenorrhea were never investigated. She was ascertained following a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma during a preventive mammography. Cytogenetic examination of the bone marrow detected complex changes including 46,XY clones prompting a request for genetic examination with following results: Karyotype from peripheral blood:45,X An 11 year old female with short stature, repaired open neural tube defect (NTD) and post axial polydactyly (PAP) was found on trio exome sequencing to have two frameshift variants, a paternally inherited pathogenic AR variant in KIAA0586: c.428delG:p.Arg143LysfsX4 and a de novo variant of unknown significance in HDAC2: c.1359_1362delAACA: p. Thr454ArgfsX51.KIAA0586 encodes a conserved centrosomal protein essential for ciliogenesis. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in KIAA0586 result in a spectrum of autosomal recessive (AR) ciliopathy disorders ranging from short rib thoracic dysplasia with polydactyly-14 to Joubert syndrome. HDAC2, not currently known causative of disease, is a mammalian zinc finger transcription factor histone deacetylase 2 protein that acts both as positive and negative regulator of transcription. HDAC2 found expressed in mouse brain may play a role in normal proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells. There are reports of a de novo HDAC2 missense variant in an individual with a Cornelia de Langue syndrome like phenotype, NTD and PAP who also exhibited a 15q11.2-q11.3 duplication and in an individual with intellectual disability (ID). We hypothesize our patient's phenotypic manifestations could be explained by either digenic inheritance (DI) or by a novel 'two hit hypothesis' in which a single AR pathogenic allele reaches threshold of clinical expression due to presence of an additional de novo variant in a significant regulatory transcript namely HDAC2. If confirmed, it could have significant genetic counseling and genetic mechanisms of disease causation implications. A collaboration is under way to characterize phenotypic and biochemical consequences of HDAC2 mutations.

For many years, her diagnosis had been Seckel syndrome due to extreme primary microcephaly (-10 SD), pre-and postnatal growth retardation (-5 SD), prominent nose, and severe developmental retardation. Upon re-examination at age 30 years, she also displayed profound intellectual disability, absent speech, most severe behavioral abnormalities resulting in blindness (due to head banging and eye scratching) as well as tetraplegia. Microarray analysis revealed a highly increased loss of heterozygosity (LOH 25.3%), consistent with incest. Of note, LOH >50% was detected for eight chromosomes. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous variant c.3377A>G p.Tyr1126Cys in the STIL gene.",

It is known that in sporadic cases, the diagnosis will be most reliable with the full range of phenotypic sings. Differential diagnosis of MCD syndromes can also be difficult due to the similarity of phenotypic features in different syndromic forms. In such cases, the problem of clarifying the diagnosis and resolving the issue of the possibility of conducting a prenatal diagnosis of the disease in the fetus in the family during subsequent pregnancy can be solved by the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing methods. Proband, a boy born in 2013, was first consulted with the aim of diagnosis at the age of 2 years old regarding complaints of short stature, congenital ptosis, nystagmus, severe hypotrichosis, renal hypoplasia, violation of pronation-supination (radio-lunar synostosis?), lobar holoprosencephaly, delayed development. Cartilage-hair hypoplasia and Noonan syndrome were excluded clinically. CMA was negative. The NGS revealed a small deletion in KIAA0556 gene (c.2373delC) in a homo-or hemizygous state. Thus, the diagnosis of Joubert syndrome (JS) type 26 was established. JS is a heterogeneous disease -36 genetic forms are presented in the OMIM, all with AR type of inheritance which have far from classical phenotypic manifestations of this syndrome. A stricter approach to the description of phenotypes will probably solve the problem of such a high genetic heterogeneity. Introduction: Joubert syndrome is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Clinical hallmarks include hypotonia, ataxia, facial dysmorphism, abnormal eye movement, irregular breathing pattern cognitive impairment and, the molar tooth sign is the pathognomonic midbrain-hindbrain malformation on magnetic resonance imaging. The disorder is predominantly caused by biallelic mutations in more than 30 genes encoding proteins with a pivotal role in morphology and function of the primary cilium. Oligogenic inheritance or occurrence of genetic modifiers has been suggested to contribute to the variability of the clinical phenotype. We report on a family with peculiar clinical spectrum Joubert syndrome molecularly and clinically dissecting a complex phenotype, in which hypogonadism, pituitary malformation and growth hormone deficiency occur as major features. Case Description and Methods: A 7 year-old male was enrolled in a dedicated \"Undiagnosed Patients Program\" for a peculiar form of Joubert syndrome complicated by iris and retinochoroidal coloboma, hypogonadism pituitary malformation, and growth hormone deficiency. The molecular basis of the complex phenotype was investigated by whole exome sequencing.",

Molecular karyotyping detected a~3,9 Mb heterozygous microdeletion in 6p25.3 -6p25.2 deleting 34 genes, 18 of which were OMIM annotated including the transcription factor FOXC1. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MOWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinctive facial appearance, intellectual disability, delayed motor development, microcephaly and short stature. It is known that most patients with MOWS have heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. We encountered a 3-year-old female patient with distinctive facial appearance (narrow bifrontal diameter, frontal bossing, telecanthus, epicanthal folds, prominent antihelices, prominent ears, uplifted earlobes, prominent nasal bridge), intellectual disability, delayed motor development, hypotonia and short stature. She was clinically diagnosed with MOWS. However, since direct sequencing for ZEB2 coding exons displayed no pathogenic variants in the patient, we performed whole exome analysis for trio in the family. No pathogenic SNVs in ZEB2 but biallelic frameshift variants (p.Thr282fs from mother and p.Ala503fs from father) in CNKSR1 were identified in the patient. There are two reports that a recognizable autosomal recessive intellectual disability was caused by disruption of CNKSR1. The p.Thr282fs was recurrent and the p.Ala503fs was novel. However, clinical manifestations of the patient did not match the phenotypes of CNKSR1 mutations, which were previously reported. In addition, a homozygous variant of p.Pro284HisfsTer74 in CNKSR1 was registered 224/ 273,674 in the gnomAD. Thus, copy number analysis was performed using whole exome data. We found an approximately 360kb deletion around intron 7 of ZEB2 in the patient, which was de novo. The deletion was confirmed by the brakepoint analysis using PCR and direct Sangersequencing. Based on these findings, we concluded that the patient was clinically and genetically diagnosed with MOWS caused by the novel deletion in ZEB2.<!--End- Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) is a rare congenital disorderaffecting approximately 1:4000-5000 women. This condition is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea and is characterized by absence or hypoplasic uterus, absence of the upper part of vagina and normal or hypoplasic fallopian tubes. A sexlimited (female) dominant autosomal inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expressiveness has been suggested. A range of gene and genomic alterations have been described and contributed to the identification of possible causative genes. For example, mutations in WNT4 and LHX1 and CNV regions, especially 1q21. 1, 16p11.2, 17q12, 22q11 .21 and Xp22, were described in affected patients. Here we described a patient with MRKH presenting a single CNV known to cause the 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome. The 29 year old patient, born from unrelated parents, present primary amenorrhea, absence of uterus and a short vagina, characteristics of the MRKH syndrome, but also grade II hepatic steatosis, dorsal convex sinus scoliosis, anterolateral marginal osteophytes, ocular problems (myopia, astigmatism and strabismus), obesity and facial dysmorphisms, features that fit to 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome. The CMA (CytoScanTM 750k platform, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Affymetrix) revealed a 1,404 Kb duplication of 7q11.23 including 24 genes, the same recurrent duplication described in the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. As the patient has MRKH and some of the features of 7q11.23 duplication syndrome, we propose that duplication of genes in this region might also be involved Reclassifying variants of unknown significance (VUS) coming from NGS sequencing is in many cases extremely challenging, needing a series of supporting criteria. We present the case of a 5 months old boy with a complex neonatal symptomatology including generalized hypotonia, global developmental delay, growth delay, hearing impairment, eye abnormalities, renal agenesis, a.o. The family history of the patient revealed a brother with polydactyly. The clinical suspicion at referral was CHARGE syndrome, with recommendations for genetic testing. Whole Exome Sequencing was performed on an Illumina platform. The results of the genetic analysis invalidated the CHARGE syndrome clinical suspicion, but revealed the presence of the heterozygous c.1604G>C / p.Arg535Pro variant of unknown clinical significance (VUS, class 3 variant) in the PUF60 gene (Poly-U-Binding Splicing Factor, OMIM #604819) on chromosome 8q24.3. The variant is a missense substitution and has never been described in literature before. Pathogenic variants in the PUF60 gene are documented to cause the autosomal dominant Verheij syndrome (OMIM #615583), disorder with a complex but highly variable symptomatology with onset at birth which includes growth retardation, global developmental delay, eye abnormalities, renal agenesis. Considering the patient`s phenotype and the clinical symptomatology of the syndrome produced by pathogenic mutations in the PUF60 gene, the identified c.1640A>G variant may be reclassified as a class 4 (Likely Pathogenic) mutation. Parental testing for the identified mutation has been recommended, but also genetic testing of the brother with polydactyly might possibly be adviced.",

SHORT syndrome (MIM#269880) is defined by its acronym; short stature, hyperextensibility of joints or inguinal hernia or both, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and teething delay. Since the name was given by Gorlin (1975) , fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature. About 10 heterozygous pathogenic variants of the PIK3R1 gene in patients with SHORT syndrome have been reported to date. Here we report a Japanese girl with clinically and genetically diagnosed as SHORT syndrome. A patient is 17-year-old girl born to non-consanguineous parents at 40 weeks and 6 days with birth weight of 1,484g, height of 37.5 cm and head circumstance of 34 cm. She had most of the clinically typical features of SHORT syndrome. Extensibility of joints were mild. Her face was triangular with telecanthus, deep-set eyes, wide nasal bridge, downturned corners of the mouth and large ears. Speech delay and hearing loss were also observed. Her bone age was equivalent to her age. Partial lipodystrophy of the face and upper limbs were recognizable. She had insulin-resistant diabetes whose blood glucose was difficult to control by biguanide treatment. A novel heterozygous missense variant in the PIK3R1 gene (NM_181523) was identified in the patient by whole exome analysis. It was de novo. The variant was located in PI3K regulatory subunit P85 inter-SH2 domain. A recent report shows that biguanide worsen insulin resistance in SHORT syndrome with a PIK3R1 mutation. Her blood glucose became well controlled after changing medication of biguanide to mecarmin. We report three unrelated individuals, all from consanguineous parents. An Afghan 10-year-old girl, presented bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands associated with developmental delay and multiple malformations.

Of note is that the parents of these children, who are heterozygous for these GLI3 variants, are clinically unremarkable. This would indicate when monoallelic, these variants do not reach a pathogenic threshold necessary for clinical expression.

Our goal is to contribute to clinical observation of 1q terminal duplication. We report a male infant (4 months old) with negative family history. Clinical features include intrauterine growth retardation with short stature at the time of clinical evaluation (-2.04 SD), mild facial dysmorphia (microretrognathia, thick eyebrows, hypertelorism, short nose, long smooth philtrum, thin upper lip vermillion, tented upper lip, dysplastic ears with small triangular earlobe), atrial septal defect ostium secundum, patent ductus arteriosus, partial 2-3 toe cutaneous syndactyly, little developmental progress (without head control at 4 months).

CdLS have been reported in children with mutations of NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3A, RAD21, and HDAC8 genes. Although, the appearance of classic CdLS is well-characterised, the phenotypic traits of individuals with various SMC1A mutations have some similarities, but have other features that make them different from classic CdLS (e.g., small hands but no limb reductions or oligodactyly, prominent intellectual disability and seizures despite milder structural malformations, and a high rate of isolated cleft palate).",

Six hundred-four patients which 169 of them had family history and 435 had breast and/or ovarian cancer, applied to our clinic. After anamnesis, pedigree analyses and physical examinations, BRCA genes were sequenced via Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) for all patients. Except from 67 patients with pathogenic mutations in BRCA genes, MLPA analysis was planned for all patients. Among patients that had pathogenic mutation, 36 had BRCA1 and 31 had BRCA2 gene mutations. The most common pathogenic mutations were c.5266dupC, c.3624dupA and c.5444G>A in BRCA1 and c.67+1G>A in BRCA2. Sixty-one variants with unknown significance(VUS), mostly missense variants, were identified and the vast majority of them were in BRCA2 gene. In MLPA analyses seven gross deletions in BRCA1 were detected. The most common gross deletion in BRCA1 gene was exon 18-19 deletion. No gross deletion was detected in BRCA2 gene. Four novel mutations in BRCA1 and five novel mutations in BRCA2 gene were identified. In two of 5 patients with both breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA1 pathogenic mutation was detected and this was the highest mutation rate group. Among ten postmenopausal sporadic breast cancer patients, one had BRCA1 pathogenic mutation. This rate was higher than premenopausal breast cancer patients' rate with family history. This study determines the variants of BRCA genes, their frequencies and their clinical significance in Turkish population. Also, these results showed that screening indications for BRCA should be reviewed. The effect of Dendrosomal curcumin (DNC) on the expression of p53 in both p53 mutant cell lines SKBR3 and p53 wild-type MCF7 in both RNA and protein levels, and also cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Curcumin derived from rhizome of Curcumin longa modulates key signaling pathways in cellular processes, therefore, it is recently considered in cancer related researches for its cell growth inhibition properties against human tumors. It is evidenced that p53 is the most common tumor-suppressor gene involved in human cancers. Its mutation not only inhibits tumor suppressor activity but also promotes oncogenic activity. Toxicity of DNC was studied using MTT assay and cell cycle distribution, apoptosis study. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to analyze the expression of p53, and other apoptosis related proteins. DNC treatment during the time increased the cells in the SubG1 and gradually decreases them in the G1, S and G2/M phases, the percentages of early apoptosis also indicated the inhibition of cell growth in early phase. Real-Time PCR showed an increased mRNA expression of BAX, Noxa and p21 during the time with decreased expression of Bcl-2. The expression of p53 mutant decreased in SKBR3, and the expression of p53 wild-type increased in MCF7 cells. Consequently, DNC can drive the tumor cell lines toward the apoptosis by modulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation, furthermore, this study suggest p53 plays an important role in mediating the survival by DNC.",

Beside genetic predisposition, environmental factors are the most known risk factors. The EAF1 & the EAF2 tumor suppressor genes belong to the ELL family, locating on chromosome 3 in the human genome, which antagonize the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in different cell lines by suppressing the tumorigenic activity. The change of the expression level of the EAF1 & the EAF2 genes is reported in other cancer types such as intestinal and blood. Here, we investigated the fold change of these mentioned genes in breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma: IDC) in Iranian patients. Forty Tumor and marginal normal tissues from breast cancer patients (grade I 16%, grade II 58%, and grade III 25%) were collected during surgery with immediately treatment of RNA later. All selected patients were HER2 positive, with an average age of 56 years old. Seventy percent of affected individuals were ER/PR [1] positive, and the other 30% ER/PR negative. Quantitative analysis of the EAF1 & EAF2 gene expression in two sample groups (tumor & normal) was performed by Real-time-PCR (cybergreen method). The expression of the EAF1 & the EAF2 genes was in tumor tissue compared to normal samples significantly decreased (fold change= -5.7 for the EAF1 gene [p=0.000] & -4.4 for the EAF2 gene [0.034]). Lower expression of the both mentioned genes is apparently associated with negative prognosis of breast cancer. Introduction: Genes comethylation is important pathways of epigenetic mechanisms in the risk of breast cancer development. Hypermethylation of RUNX3 and BRCA1 genes is involved in disrupted oncosuppression process among breast cancer cases.

Introduction: Epigenetic silencing of the methyl-guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) gene promoter by gene promoter methylation suggests a partial inability of the tumour to repair the chemotherapyinduced DNA damage. In retrospective analyses, MGMT methylation has been correlated with a response to or benefit predictive value of a methylated MGMT status for response to or benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy and thus improved outcome has been demonstrated repeatedly in glioblastomas. Moreover, MGMT methylation identifies a sub-population with a better prognosis irrespective of the applied treatment. Materials and methods: We examined 10 patients with the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme treated in the neurosurgical department and have observed them within 12 months by present. DNA was extracted from freshly frozen tumor tissue. Detection of the MGMT gene hypermethylation was carried out with methyl-specific real time PCR.",

Further research will be continued and additional validation of findings will be performed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates intracellular signals in response to various extracellular stimuli. Previous studies have been shown that EGFR is activated and overexpressed in many types of human epithelial cancer. In a limited study on epithelial cancer cells, resveratrol has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) is normally expressed in healthy cells, is also expressed in cancer cells during cancer development and leads to the concealing of cancer cells from the immune system. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of resveratrol on EGFR and PDL-1 in Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells(HEP2), which is epithelial cancer. We cultivated HEP2 and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell) cell lines as a control cell line. We determined the IC50 value as 100 uM. EGFR, MYC, and PD-L1 gene expression levels were evaluated by gene expression studies. GAPDH and ACTB genes were identified as housekeeping genes. As a result of the study, gene expression relative change levels for EGFR, MYC, and PD-L1 were determined as 1.145, 0.475, 2.695, respectively. According to these results, resveratrol did not cause a significant change in EGFR and MYC expression levels in the LSCC cell line, while it significantly increased PD-L1 levels. It has been found interesting because the resveratrol, which is normally included in the literature as an anticancer, increases levels of PD-L1 because it is likely to support escape from the immune response.",

Through analysis of the CES data for single nucleotide and copy number variations has revealed a frameshift variant at TET2 gene with a variant fraction of only 6% in 120 reads. We have therefore decided to validate this result using the same biospecimen in an alternative platform, namely Archer\u00aeMyeloid dedicated for somatic variant analysis. Accordingly, the identical variant was confirmed using the Archer platform with 13% variant fraction in 744 reads. Somatic mutations in TET2 encoding Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 has been reported to be associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS refers to a heterogeneous group of closely related clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in low blood counts and possibility of developing acute myeloid leukemia. The variant identified in TET2 can be considered as somatic and may aid correct diagnosis and treatment for the patient.",

And the FISH signals of the probes mapping the normal copy number region between the two copy number loss regions were absent in the abnormal chromosome 11, as were the probes mapping the distal and proximal copy number loss regions.

Cyprus, which is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, has been at the crossroads of multiple civilizations throughout human history. Today, the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots constitute two major ethnic groups in Cyprus, along with some minor groups. Even though Turkish-Cypriot paternal lineages have an autochthonous quality, some Y-DNA haplotypes are shared between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots. It should be no surprise that the genetic characteristics of the current Turkish-Cypriot population have been determined by the interactive forces of migrations, admixture, genetic drift, etc. We aimed at elucidating the path from the interesting or unusual clinical phenotypes of rare diseases to potentially novel gene variants. In the present study, the most recent high-throughput genomic technologies were employed to study the genetic etiology of such diseases. Accordingly, WES was used to sequence trios. As a result, we identified a number of novel population-specific gene variants, each of which causes rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctate type 5, Wiedeman-Rautenstrauch Syndrome, tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type 1, Joubert syndrome, etc. Lack of genetic databases in the region of middle eastern, the laboratory set up the capacity to produce DNA sequence data expands the number of contributors to DNA sequence databases, which is beneficial for science and may be helpful for any number of bioinformatic analyses. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of revealing rare-disease-causing variants in a particular population for immediate use in accurate diagnosis, for improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and for developing effective preventive medicine strategies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms with dedicated software are increasingly being used to identify copy number variations (CNVs) along with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) simultaneously. Array-based technologies including SNP genotyping has been be employed in parallel to NGS for further characterization of the CNV event. Such combined approaches may resolve challenging cases in medical genetics especially for recessive conditions when one copy of the gene is deleted while the other copy carries a pathogenic CNV. Herein, we have adopted Clinical Exome Solution (CES) of Sophia Genetics in a patient with an initial diagnosis of Pierre Robin syndrome. The capture-based target enrichment kit has enabled us to cover approximately 4490 genes. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Next Seq 550\u00ae platform. Sophia DDM platform was used as a interface to evaluate SNVs and CNVs. HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 Bead Chip Kit at Illumina SNP array platform was used for follow-up detection of CNV events. Analysis of NGS data for CNV events has revealed one copy loss at chromosome 22q11 including the gene TBX1. The loss had exactly the same boundaries as deduced from SNP genotyping. Although, haploinsufficiency of TBX1 is associated with DiGeorge syndrome, we have interestingly identified a novel missense pathogenic SNV in TBX1 in the NGS data. Combined analysis of CNV events in NGS and SNP array platforms has enabled us to identify a deletion involving the TBX1 gene in a patient. We propose that the SNV identified in the nondeleted copy may explain the phenotypic variability associated with TBX1 deletions. Chromosomal band 17q12 is a gene rich region flanked by segmental duplications which make the region prone to deletions and duplication by NAHR mechanism (non-allelic homologous recombination). While the deletions cause well described clinical unit with specific phenotype called RCAD (renal cyst and diabetes mellitus), the phenotype caused by reciprocal duplications of the same region still remains unclear especially due to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance and fact, that they are often detected in healthy patients. Here we present unusual case of family where the mother is carrier of duplication (paternally inherited) and also deletion (inherited from mother with RCAD) of the identical 17q12 region. All of her children were diagnosed with 17q12 microduplication syndrome. Except of the mother and grandfather, all her children carrying duplication express variable degree of neurodevelopmental problems, such as epilepsy, mild intellectual disability, delayed speech development or attention deficit disorder, that correlate with the hypothesis of incomplete penetrance and variable phenotype published by many studies. As a potential causative genes are considered LHX1 for neurodevelopmental problems and gene ACACA for epilepsy. The simultaneous occurrence of deletion and duplication of the same chromosomal region in one family is very rare. This case supports hypothesis that 17q12 duplications are stable and may segregate in a family for several generations. Introduction: Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technique enables high-resolution screening of the genome for segmental genomic copy number variations (CNVs). The technique today represents an unsurpassed tool for detecting minor chromosomal aberrations in children with expressed pathological clinical features, such as hypotonia, dysmorphia, motor and mental delay.",

To conclude, we consider karyotyping analysis of the product of conception to be of a great value when diagnosing the causes of miscarriages. The search for genetic markers of human individual radiosensitivity is important. The microarray analysis of gene expression in human lymphocytes revealed the correlation of ADAMTS1, RBFOX2, THBS1 and WHSC1 gene expression with the spontaneous \u03b3H2AX foci level and the radiation-induced micronuclei frequency. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of predicting individual radiosensitivity using analysis of ADAMTS1, RBFOX2, THBS1 and WHSC1 gene expression and methylation level of their promoters. We analyzed the blood lymphocytes obtained from 47 individuals, included 20 male and 27 female after exposure to 2 Gy of \u03b3-rays in vitro. The micronucleus frequency was assessed using FISH-based micronucleus test with pancentromeric probes. The gene expression level was analyzed by real-time PCR. Targeted bisulfite analysis by NGS was used to estimate the methylation level of gene promoters. The micronucleus frequency was correlated with expression of ADAMTS1 (R=-0.52, p=0.033), THBS1 (R=-0.52, p=0.03) and WHSC1 (R=-0.37, p=0.032) in non-irradiated cells and with expression of THBS1 (R=-0.53, p=0.033) and RBFOX2 (R=-0.30, p=0.027) after irradiation. Simultaneous use of expression levels of all analyzed genes allowed to identify individuals with increased radiation-induced micronucleus frequency in groups of male (p=0.00026), female (p=0.048) and all individuals (p=0.0009). DNA methylation level was correlated with expression of RBFOX2 only (R=-0.58; p=0.009). It is possible to identify individuals with increased radiation-induced micronucleus frequency using gene expression level of analyzed genes, but not the methylation level of gene promoters.

As NGP we used in this study the facial dysmorphology novel analysis (FDNA) technology. To automatically identify facial phenotypes of patients with small supernumerary marker chromosomes we already established successfully Emanuel (ES) and Pallister-Killian Syndrome (PKS) identification from 2D facial photos. The comparison between ES or PKS and normal individuals expressed a full separation between the cohorts. These results show that NPG is able to help in the clinic, and could reduce the time patients spend in diagnostic odyssey. The same development is currently undertaken for cat-eye syndrome. It became possible thanks to a grant from NORD. The link for the present project to upload pictures of cat-eye syndrome will be provided on the poster. NPG also helps to differentiate ES or PKS from each other and other patients with small supernumerary marker chromosomes and most likely also from patients with cat-eye syndrome. Thus, especially in countries with no access to more sophisticated genetic approaches apart from banding cytogenetics NPG is a very timely approach. Inclusion of more facial pictures of patient with sSMC, like cat-eye-, isochromosome-18psyndrome or others may contribute to higher detection rates Conclusion: The study proved that the INNO-LiPA\u00ae CFTRiage assay has an excellent performance and is an easy to use assay to detect 88 CFTR mutations simultaneously.",

In order to obtain reliable interpretation of these data, integrity of RNA should be primarily qualified, which is determined from the very moment of sample collection and storage conditions. In the meantime, whole blood can be obtained with less-invasive way compared to others such as tissues. However, blood is vulnerable to freezing and often loses its availability for RNA downstream applications. In this study, we compared changes of RNA quality according to the several sample storage conditions including temperature and duration of incubation before freezing, long-term freezing and types of collection tubes. After simple QC steps, we performed mRNA-seq to compare gene expression patterns of RNAs from various storage conditions. We found that quality of RNA samples is obviously affected by storage conditions leading to changes in gene expression patterns compared to control (Fold changes>|2|). Differentially expressed genes in this study are grouped as snoRNA family, which is involved in structure of rRNA, tRNA and so on. As a results, we set the guideline for optimal blood sample storage. By proceeding to further study, it is expected to set the markers for RNA sample quality by inducing whether these genes take charge in RNA degradation in some ways.

Conclusion:In at least three out of four patients, definitely suffering from muscular dystrophies, we could detect promising structural variants and/or SNVs in the noncoding regions of known genes (DMD, SGCG). Insights from the analysis of expressed gene products by RNA sequencing enables human disease researchers to better understand the underlying structure and function of genes of interest.

The method generates up to 48 random-primed stranded RNA-seq libraries from as little as 10 ng of total RNA. Nanoliter reaction volumes significantly reduce reagent consumption to lower overall costs per sample.

On the other hand, plenty of neurogenic disorders were described with \"dominant negative effect\" which meant loss of function of the effected genes. Data were collected that until the normal allele functioned well this effect didn't work. Somatic mutation in neuronal stem cells containing a germline mutation may destroy the function of the normal allele. I propose that neurodegeneration can be clonal disorder in some instances. The complicated pathogenesis of Parkinson disease is highly studied and GBA (beta-glucocerebrosidase) gene heterozygous mutations were found more frequently in the familial form of the disease. Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency. It was detected that Parkinson disease is more frequent in Gaucher type I patients but also in the carrier parents. Liquid biopsy is well known in tumour research.

Three disease-causing genes have been identified: mutations in the SOX10, END3, or EDNRB genes are known to cause WS type IV. Variants in the endothelin -B receptor (EDNRB) gene on 13q22 region have been found to cause the Waardenburg syndrome type IVA (WS 4A), that combines clinical features of pigmentary abnormalities of the skin, hair and irides, sensorineural hearing loss, and Hirschprung disease. We report a 15 months -old albanian boy who was diagnosed as WS IVA. He presented clinical manifestations as skin and hair hypopigmentation, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, bilateral blue homochromatic irides, mild developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, short stature and constipation. The entire exome has been evaluated for variants clinically relevant to the described phenotype by the whole exome sequencing, but it was not detected any variant indicative of the genetic diagnosis of the patient. The diagnosis was confirmed by chromosomal microarray analysis. It was detected a 23153 kb one copy loss on the long arm of chromosome 13. A pathogenic CNV has been detected in the 13q21.1q31.1 region, totally encompassing the EDNRB gene. The EDNRB gene has been found totally deleted in our patient. It is observed a variable phenotype in patients with heterozygous loss of function of EDNRB gene. This is the first case of WS 4A to be reported from Albania.",

Introduction: Short-read sequencing in targeted resequencing prevents the identification of clinically-relevant genetic variants within or in close proximity to duplicate genomic regions. We recently found that the analysis of fragments longer than standard-size improves mapping quality and thus genotypability of many clinically relevant genomic regions. However, modulating fragment length in enzymatic-based library preparation is challenging, as optimal ratio between DNA/enzymes is not easily identifiable or because bead-linked transposome chemistry is setup for a standard DNA size. In this study we tested the possibility to modulate fragment length in exome-libraries using the standard or a modified version of the Nextera Flex for Enrichment bead-linked transposome (Illumina), extending fragment length up to 550bp. M&M: Genomic libraries were obtained with the standard Nextera Flex for Enrichment Library Prep kit or its new modified version (not commercially available yet), and subsequently enriched in exonic portions with the Illumina Exome Panel. Libraries have been sequenced in 150PE to 80X mapped coverage.",

E-P16.08 Low density oligonucleotide microarray for the detection of ethnospecific mutations causing five genetic disorders prevalent among the Yakut population M. Savvina, N. Maksimova, A. Sukhomyasova North-Eastern federal university, Yakutsk, Russian Federation In yakut population of republic of Sakha (Yakutia) serious genetic disorders occur with relatively high frequency. There is a pressing need for comprehensive carrier screening and molecular diagnostic, but methods of genetic diagnostics that commonly used today are not able to afford it due to the high cost and time consumption for a single test. For such purposes, we developed an ethnicity-specific assay based on DNA microarray. Microarray is designed to address most prevalent mutations among yakut population: 4582_4583insT in CUL7 gene, \u0441.5741G>A in NBAS gene, \u0441.806\u0421>\u0422 in DIA1 gene, c.1090G>C in FAH gene, c.-23+1G>A in GBJ2 gene causing 3-M syndrome, SOPH-syndrome, Tyrosinemia type 1, Methaemoglobinaemia type 1, Nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness (DFNB1) type 1A respectively. Oligonucleotide probes printed onto aldehyde group-coated glass slides using non-contact microarrayer. The assay based on reverse hybridization, which include two-step multiplex PCR reactions with production of one-stranded Cy5 labeled-PCR products following its hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Using this microarray, we estimated heterozygose carrier frequency in 120 healthy people of yakut ethnicity and validated data by real-time PCR and PCR-RLFP methods. The evaluation of this microarray demonstrates that it is comprehensive, robust, sensitive, specific, and easily modifiable. The developed assay can be considered as an alternative cost-effective tool for genetic screening purposes and it is suitable for both carrier screening and disease diagnostics in yakut population in the republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The research is conducted under the state target program: project FSRG-2020-0014 \"Genomic The ACLF provides laboratories since 2005 with external quality assessments for the caryotype (including FISH) and array-CGH. More than 70 laboratories in constitutional cytogenetics, hematology and array-CGH participate each year. The evolution of our practices requires continuously adaptation but these EQAs and their European equivalents have made us aware of the state of knowledge and certain limitations reveal the loss of competence in classical cytogenetic analysis as well as of molecular pangenomic techniques. Indeed we have identified technical gaps or pitfalls that we will illustrate with 2 examples. Postnatal Cytogenetics: We proposed a pericentric chromosome 5 inversion inv(5)(p13q13) considered a variant in the literature. A large discrepancy was observed between laboratories reporting this chromosome a polymorphism and others reasoning as a classic pericentric inversion. The \"youngest\" cytogeneticists have lost experience regarding a variant not recently reported in the literature. Postnatal Array-CGH: The second proposed case involved a caryotype-validated pentasomy X. Surprisingy some laboratories missed the pentasomy. They concluded a trisomy or tetrasomy mosaicism. The explanation may lie in the limitations of the assessment of the copy number by algorithms used in the presence of unusual ratios especially at the level of gonosomes, a too fast analysis or a technique that did not allow to evaluate a large number of chromosome X copies. This exercise allowed us to observe the limitations of certain computational algorithms and remind us of the importance of maintaining a solid formation in classical cytogenetic analysis to best interpret the results from pangenomic molecular techniques Introduction: The aim of our study was to characterize patients with fibrinogen (Fbg) deficiencies by analyzing FGA, FGB and FGG genes using next generation sequencing (NGS).",

The recovered gDNA is intact high-molecular-weight DNA and can be used in amplification-based qPCR assays. The International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1994 classified Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection to the I group of carcinogen, along with some of the radionuclides and radiation. The diagnosis of Hp infection includes molecular genetic research methods by PCR, based on amplification of 16S rRNA because it's a quite specific and excludes the possibility of amplification of related species and strains closest to Hp (Campylobacter, Helicobacter cinaedi, Helicobacter mustelae and Wolinella succinogenes). Detection of Hp infection by PCR methods was not performed earlier in the Sakha Republic. Our aim was approbation of the molecular genetic method for the diagnosis of Hp infection isolated from feces of patients with gastroduodenal diseases from individuals of Sakha Republic. We studied 92 Yakut patients with gastroduodenal diseases confirmed by endoscopic and histological study. Two patients had Hp with high degree of dissemination. The urea breath test was positive because the results of determining the presence of Hp and showed high concentration of ammonia (high degree of dissemination). Subsequently, samples of evacuated feces were obtained from these two patients. Positive amplification of the 16S rRNA marker gene was obtained from one of two examined patients. We were able to show that using the proposed method it is possible to determine the presence of Hp DNA in feces, which allows to pass endoscopic examination, in cases where there are contraindications to invasive research methods.

The KANSL1 gene is located on the 17q21.31 locus, which has been subjected to structural divergence in humans. The common structural 17q21.31 haplotypes diverge mainly in the direction of the inversion and the copy-number state of KANSL1, affecting exons 1 to 3 of the gene. The architecture of this genomic region signifies a challenge for the clinical interpretation of KANSL1 variants as reported by Koolen et al in 2016. We present several cases illustrating strategies to ascertain the putative clinical significance of single-nucleotide variants located within exons 1-3 of KANSL1 (NM_001193466.1). These cases corroborate that partial polymorphic duplications of the 17q21.31 region confound the clinical relevance of the KANSL1 variants. Consequently, the same pathogenic variant can be causative in some individuals, while clinically irrelevant in others. Hence, parental testing demonstrating the de novo state of the variant in index patients is critical evidence supporting its pathogenicity. Importantly, in cases where parental testing is not performed, the variant allele frequencies combined with copy number analysis can be used to disentangle the genomic architecture at the locus and consolidate (or exclude) the diagnosis of the syndrome. TS prevalence is estimated to be 1/600 and 1/2500, respectively, but their diagnosis often remains unknown. Here we report two incidental findings of KS and TS by cancer predisposition gene panel analysis on 3,460 patients. KS case was a man diagnosed with breast cancer at 67 years of age. TS case was a woman with personal (age 54) and family history of breast cancer. For both cases, breast cancer gene panel analysis did not detect any pathogenic variant but chromosome X control probes showed abnormal results: presence of two chromosomes X for the man and one chromosome X for the woman. Subsequent MLPA analysis suggested the presence of two chromosomes X and one chromosome Y for the man, and one chromosome X and no chromosome Y for the woman. Karyotype analysis could be performed only for the woman and confirmed the diagnosis of TS, with 45,X chromosomal content. Chromosome X control probes are used to detect errors of patient identity during sampling or experiment. Our report shows that they also allow the identification of sex chromosome aneuploidies for genetic testing performed for other disorders. It is important to inform biological and clinical geneticists about these incidental findings to perform additional analysis after detection of abnormal chromosome X number and to better anticipate patient specific follow-up.",

Such cases show us that increasing awareness among doctors about genetic conditions is still certainly needed. We would like to introduce the new concept of molecular diagnostics of genetic disorders intended for routine clinical laboratories in the Czech Republic. The concept is based on three levels of genetic analysis using the method of next generation sequencing. The first level is represented by a panel of genes called OIDIP (Open Interdisciplinary Diagnostic Panel) designed for routine differential diagnosis of both selected common and rare diseases. However, the provided genetic analysis is much more complex and, if relevant, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) calculation can be done on basis of co-analysed SNPs. Moreover, the detection of diverse clinically significant common variants (trombophilic mutations, lactose intolerance, warfarin drug response, etc.) is performed at the background. From the epidemiologic point of view, two genes are included to detect carriers of pathogenic alleles for cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria to spread knowledge of associated risks within Czech population. The second level of genetic testing is represented by \"clinical exome\" suited for diagnosis of rare and genetically heterogenous diseases. The last level of genetic testing is featured by whole exome sequencing and is still intended for special cases. Appropriate clinical questionnaires are an integral part of the concept as well as website (www.oidip.cz), which should serve to connect clinical specialists and share the information. The aim is to provide rapid genetic diagnostics of a wide spectrum of even rare pathologies to general public. Introduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) has become an indispensable tool in the field of genetic diagnostics. While we have observed an enormous rise in technical and medical standards of WES data analysis, there remain many limitations in the interpretation of the identified variants. Currently applied analytical strategies rely heavily on assumptions of variant filtering such as the commonly used parameter of variant type (e.g. missense, frameshift, canonical splice-site). The variants then undergo a subjective classification of the severity of consequence based on SNPEff: HIGH, MODERATE, LOW and MODIFIER. In this study, we concentrated on the pathogenicity of variants that are often declared to have low deleterious effects and hence overlooked during patient WES data analysis: synonymous (LOW), splice region (LOW) and intron (MODIFIER) variants according to VEP annotation in order to understand the pathogenicity of such variants.",

As a result, a variant was found in the LMBR1 gene c.1282-14G>A, Intron 16 Splicing, heterozygosis (69%); associated with LSS. The bioinformatic study demonstrated the pathogenicity of the variant, which allows a phenotype-genotype association. Our findings inform the first case reported in the literature of a patient with LSS in Colombia.

In addition, SMAD4 mutations have been identified not only in pancreatic cancer but also in other cancers such as colorectal and gastric cancers. The analysis method used the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, which can calculate the molecular structure and the interaction between molecules. In this study, we investigated whether the effects of genetic mutations on pathogenicity could be estimated using the FMO method. The structure (1dd1.pdb) of the wild type SMAD4 trimer was obtained from the protein structure data bank (PDB), and the structure was corrected by MOE Structure Preparation. Pathogenic mutations were obtained from Clin-Var, and the structure of mutants were constructed by MOE Homology modeling and wild type structure as a template. The computer used supercomputer K (AICS, RIKEN) and FX100 (Nagoya Univ). The calculation was performed at the calculation level of MP2/6-31G* using ABINIT-MP as the software. The sum of inter fragment interaction energies (IFIE-sum) was compared between the wild type and the mutant. Comparing the calculated results of the wild type and the mutant, the interaction energy was destabilized in the mutant such as R361C. R361C mutation destabilized the interaction between D537 and D351. R361, D537 and D351 form a hydrogen bond network during SMAD4 trimer formation. After R361C mutation, this hydrogen bond network could not be formed, and the results of computational analysis showed that this trimer formation was destabilized.

Here, DNA sequences are found within an individual that are novel with respect to a given reference. These sequences occur primarily due to the fact that a reference genome lacks some ancestral sequence since it is mostly derived from a few or a single individual. Therefore, newly sequenced individuals can yield genomic sequences which are absent from a reference genome. To find such insertions in shortread sequencing data, it is necessary to perform a de novo assembly of the non-reference sequence, an algorithmically challenging and computationally expensive task. In recent years, only a few methods and tools have been developed to detect these non-reference sequence insertions and even fewer to perform the detection on large cohorts. One insertion caller that exploits the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples is PopIns. PopIns extracts unmapped reads from all individuals, assembles a non-redundant set of contig sequences across all individuals, anchors these sequences to the reference and finally genotypes each individual. We entirely redesigned the assembly module, a key step to combine samples. The novel assembly module uses a highly specialized data structure called compacted colored de Bruijn Graph. By applying this new approach to simulated data, the detected sequences are more precise while their computation requires less memory. Subsequently, this will considerably improve the detection of non-reference sequence insertions and, therefore, offer more comprehensive variant call sets for population and disease studies.",

Nevertheless, to date it remains completely unclear whether there is a genetic continuity between the Scythian-Sarmatian archaeological culture of the Iron Age and modern population of Northern Eurasia. The aim of our study was to analyze mitochondrial DNA in 9 samples of the Scythian-Sarmatian historical and archaeological culture, followed by comparing the results with data from more than 1,000 individuals from modern Northern Eurasian populations. DNA samples from the Scythian and Sarmatian cultures were shown to belong to mtDNA haplogroups: W, W3a, T1a1, U5a2+16294, U5b2a1a2, U5b2a1a1, U5b2c, T1a1d, C1e. Screening using 1042 samples from modern populations of Northern Eurasia showed that haplogroup W was found in almost all analyzed samples and reached maximum in Balkar population (15.7%) and was absent only in some ethno-territorial groups of Bashkirs. In turn, haplogroup W3 was detected only in populations of the Volga-Ural region, where it reaches its maximum among Udmurts (6.8%) and Besermyans (5.1%). The mtDNA haplogroup T1a1 was detected with a frequency of 1.7% in the Balkar population and a single variant in the group of Burzyansky Bashkirs (1.7%). Haplogroup U5a2 +16294 was identified in single cases in Mordvins and Karachays, Haplogroup U5b2a1a was detected in Russians (3.8%), and in single cases in Besermyans and Arkhangelsky Bashkirs. Haplogroups U5b2c, T1a1d, C1e were unobserved in modern populations studied. The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project \u211619-04-01195. Introduction: Most neurodegenerative diseases are highly heritable, implying genetically determined disease risk and onset. Despite this, neurodegeneration does not typically begin until later in life, with peak incidence between the sixth and eighth decades. Using an epidemiological method classically applied to cancer, a linear relationship between log-scaled incidence and log-scaled age was recently demonstrated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, supporting a multistep model of disease onset due to six discreet timeassociated steps (or exposures) on average. In this study, we sought to determine whether other ICD-10 classified diseases of the nervous system appear to be multistep in nature.",

Motivation for expanded use of genetic data, expected patient benefit, and expectations concerning departmental responsibility showed only moderate overlap between experts. In the legislation of Russia, the implementation of genetic passportization and the formation of a genetic profile of the population is considered as one of the main tasks of chemical and biological safety. It is determined that such work should be carried out considering the need to protect data on the genome. There are legal provisions related to both human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the regime of genetic information as a type of personal data. This means that the legal component of the genetic passportization goes far beyond addressing the issue of creating genetic passports. According to the International Declarations on Human Rights research in this area should not prevail over respect for fundamental freedoms and dignity of people. Scientists warn against possible abuses in this area talking about the creation of two types of passports: a forensic passport and a passport that reflects risks to human health and other features of his body. We proceed from the need to develop specialized genetic passports. The main use of genetic information today is limited to medicine and forensics. Meanwhile, the possibilities in this area are immeasurably wider as soon as the use of human genetic data for non-medical purposes is also allowed by the International Declaration on Human Genetic Data. The principle of confidentiality is one of the key legal and ethical principles for building relationships between parties in many areas of public life. Its essence is that the information obtained in the course of work is not subject to deliberate or accidental disclosure, and in a situation where it is necessary to transfer it to third parties, it must be presented in a form that excludes its use against the interests of its owner. The principle of confidentiality accompanies the entire set of actions carried out with genetic information. It is inextricably linked to such legal institutions as \"medical secrecy\", \"personal data\", principle of informed consent, \"autonomy of the patient's will\" etc. Within the genetic research, the content and forms of manifestation of this principle have a certain specificity, which requires special attention in the legal regulation of the relevant provisions. Thus, the information obtained during genetic research is not strictly individual, since it may relate to family members of the owner of genetic information. In this regard, in many cases there is a need in making a compromise decision. This aspect leads to cases of deviation from the strict rules of confidentiality. Russian legislation requires the development of a clear and consistent algorithm for performing appropriate actions by a specialist. ",

Here we report eleven males from eight families with copy-number gains at the Xq13.2-q13.3 locus with a common facial phenotype, intellectual disability (ID), distinctive behavioral features, and a seizure disorder in two cases. All tested carrier mothers had normal intelligence. The duplication arose de novo in three mothers where grandparental testing was possible. In one family the duplication segregated with ID across three generations. RLIM is the only gene common to all duplications investigated. It encodes a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain-containing zinc-finger protein with diverse cellular roles including in transcriptional regulation and ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. Missense variants in RLIM have recently been identified to cause X linked ID in males, with heterozygous females typically having normal intelligence and highly skewed X-chromosome inactivation. We detected consistent and significant increase of RLIM mRNA and RLIM protein levels in cells derived from eight affected males from five families with the duplication. Subsequent analysis of MDM2, as one of the targets of the RLIM E3 ligase activity, showed its consistent downregulation in cells from the affected males. However, all the carrier mothers displayed normal RLIM mRNA levels and had highly skewed X inactivation. We propose duplications at Xq13.2-13.3 including RLIM cause a recognizable, but mild neurocognitive phenotype in hemizygous males.",

Here we use Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to investigate the effect of genetically predicted gene expression on 12 autoimmune and 4 cancer outcomes. Gene expression data from the eQTLGen consortium (n=31,684) was leveraged to construct weakly correlated genetic instruments (r2<0.1) for 15,392 genes. Applying the inverse-variance weighted MR method transcriptome-wide whilst accounting for linkage disequilibrium structure identified 773 unique genes with evidence of a genetically predicted effect on at least one disease outcome. We next applied genetic colocalization to investigate whether these effects may be confined to specific cell-types using data derived from 18 types of immune cells. This highlighted various cell-type specific relationships, including PRKCQ and asthma which appeared to be T-cell specific, as well as PTK2B and inflammatory bowel disease, which was restricted to monocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, as the use of human genetics can help improve the efficacy and safety rates of drug targets, we undertook a phenome-wide MR analysis for each of these 773 genes on 335 health-related outcomes. This atlas of results can be used to prioritise which of these potential therapeutic targets is least likely to cause unanticipated adverse effects. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms and biological pathways which predispose individuals to autoimmune disease and cancer. As future work we intend to apply this framework to COVID19 data to improve our capability to prevent and treat the cause of the current global pandemic.",

MECP2 Duplication Syndrome (MDS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by copy-number gains of the MECP2 gene at the Xq28 locus. The clinical presentation is variable, but there are several predominant features, including infantile hypotonia, severe developmental delay/ intellectual disability, recurrent respiratory infections, and epilepsy. One possible explanation for this variability is the distinct structural variants (SVs) among MDS patients at this locus, 26% of which were previously reported as complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs). To pursue a robust genotype-phenotype correlation, a combination of custom high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), wholegenome sequencing (WGS), and genomic optical mapping were used to resolve MECP2 SVs in 89 MDS probands. This analysis revealed CGRs constitute 46.1% (41/89) of our cohort, including 15.7% (14/89) triplications (5/14 involving triplicated MECP2), 5.6% (5/89) DUP-NML-DUP (two duplications separated by a copy-number neutral segment), and 10.1% (9/89) involving a translocation. De novo SVs were observed in 18.1% (12/66) of probands: 4 translocations, 4 terminal duplications, 3 single duplications, and 1 DUP-NML-DUP rearrangement.

HDAC8, a class I histone deacetylase is also responsible for the deacetylation of non-histone substrates, such as SMC3 located at the cohesin complex. The mechanism by which post-transductional modifications influence the mitotic apparatus and the mitotic fidelity remains poorly understood. Recent studies in mouse oocytes showed that Hdac8 controls meiotic spindle assembly. Using time-lapse imaging, we have found that HDAC8 co-localizes on spindle microtubules and the midbody, and therefore appears to be involved in chromosome alignment and accurate spindle assembly. We used HeLA cells and human-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing a mutant HDAC8 allele as in vitro culture systems, both capable of recapitulating the in vivo events. These models proved to be valuable tools to understand how HDAC8 depletion affects genomic stability during mitosis. We observed that mutant HDAC8 led to the formation of anaphase bridges and lagging chromosomes, tripolar cells and inefficient chromosome congression. We found strong evidence that HDAC8 acts as genome euploidy guardian, and understanding the underlying mechanism in mitosis raised new questions. Overall, our findings indicate that HDAC8 deficiency promotes Introduction: In our cohort of >3000 molecularly characterised inherited retinal disease (IRD) families managed at the Genetics Service of Moorfields Eye Hospital (UK), we investigated proportions with disease attributable to causative variants in each gene.",

Among them, has-miR-148a-3p and has-miR-30e-5p bind Tumour Suppressor Gene p53 (TP53) gene; has-miR-4286 is located in chromosome 8 regions and it is implicated in microdeletion; has-miR-1915 regulates different cellular pathways and interacts with Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR\u03b1). Gene expression analysis discloses 21 genes deregulated in CRBP1+A549 cells, with TP53 gene downregulated; while CNV analysis identified single copy deletions and amplifications in 15 chromosomes in lung AC CRBPI HIGH patients, with TP53 genes showing 3 copies. Our findings provide new insights concerning a new regulatory mechanism of gene expression in Lung AC. Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disease characterized by a normal early postnatal development followed by an arrest of growth. There are two main types of RTT: typical and atypical delineated on the bases of clinical and genetic criteria. In the atypical form, patients present with many of the clinical criteria of RTT but do not essentially have all of the features of the disorder. Dysmorphic features were observed in few RTT cases. Rettlike syndrome is a recently introduced term, used when a patient presents with an overlap of features between typical and atypical RTT. While MECP2 mutations are linked to the majority of typical RTT cases and some atypical forms, the molecular etiology of many entities remains unelucidated. Two affected individuals from a consanguineous family presenting with atypical Rett phenotype were studied. MECP2 sequencing followed by a strategy combining whole-exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray analysis were performed. MECP2 gene sequencing ruled out the implication of this gene in the disease of this family. A strategy combining WES data and CMA allowed the identification of a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.323 +1G>A) in PDE2A in both patients. The mutation segregates with the disease in the family and is predicted to disrupt the 5'-splice site of exon 4 of PDE2A, which was confirmed by RNA studies. Here we report the second case of PDE2A mutations in humans and the first in patients with atypical RTT syndrome. Our findings further support the involvement of PDE2A in the regulation of physiological neurological mechanisms.",

Several reproductive medicine options are available for adults with 22q11DS who wish to have an unaffected child, chiefly prenatal testing with termination of affected pregnancies or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). The views of people with 22q11DS on these options have not previously been studied. An inductive qualitative design using semistructured interviews was used, to explore the views of adults with 22q11DS on reproductive medicine options. Three overarching themes emerged: 1. Personal and family impact of 22q11DS, 2. Attitudes towards reproductive medicine, and 3. Lack of accessible information. The interviews revealed that 22q11DS has an impact on family life in ways which could influence reproductive decision making. Despite the concerns about the implications of having a child with 22q11DS, there was reluctance to terminate a 22q11DS pregnancy. PGD was viewed more positively, because it did not involve termination. Currently available information resources on reproductive medicine options are not designed for people with intellectual disability, participants identified that current information resources were not accessible to them. Our study highlights the need for health services to have strategies to offer patients with genetic conditions such as 22q11DS information on reproductive medicine options. For example, by designing accessible co-produced information resources, offering access to genetic counselling and developing an informatics infrastructure for identification of individuals with 22q11DS who may benefit from discussion of reproductive options A. mcneill: None.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has high incidence in Eastern-Europe, especially in Hungary. In addition to environmental factors, the genetic and epigenetic background of this phenomenon still remains unknown. We aimed to perform whole exome sequencing along the colorectal adenomacarcinoma sequence on tissue samples in order to identify characteristic germline and somatic variants. Genomic DNA was isolated from 27 adenomas (AD), 52 CRC, 18 healthy patients (N) and from 2 colorectal cancer cell lines. Exome enrichment was done with the Nextera DNA Exome Kit and sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500 Instrument (Illumina). Germline and somatic variants were determined by Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and MuTect2 algorithms and were confirmed by ddPCR and in situ hybridization. Certain CRC-associated pathogenic variants could be detected in a relatively lower [e.g. APC 63.46%)], or with relatively higher frequency compared to the European statistics [e.g. KRAS 40.38%]. Among the germline variants of the one-carbon metabolism, MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G variants were detected with a relatively higher frequency in the Hungarian population compared to the European average. Alterations in the frequencies of CRC-associated somatic variants compared to the European averages might contribute to the high CRC incidence observed in the Hungarian population.

Taken together, our analyses provide insight into cis-regulatory architecture during hypothalamic development and how it may contribute to hypothalamus-associated phenotypes.

We compared hTERT promoter methylation status in CTCL cell lines, S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS) patient-derived cells, fresh SS patient cells, and in normal CD4+ and CD34+ cells from healthy donors.

The CRH receptor-1 (CRHR1) may explain the MDD-and T2D-hypercortisolism. CRHR1-variants predisposing to impaired CRHR1-dosage/function may lead to hypercortisolism (substrate for serotonin dysfunction and MDD), and hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral fat, all T2D-traits. CRHR1-variants contribute to MDD. CRHR1 mediates glucose-stimulated insulin-secretion and, if impaired, may lead to T2D. We hypothesize that CRHR1-variants may impair the stress and cortisol response, conferring MDD-T2D comorbidity-risk in MDD-drug na\u00efve subjects. Using 212 Italian families with T2D, enriched T2D-familial history, and MDD, we amplified and tested 163 CRHR1 SNPs by two-point parametriclinkage and linkage-disequilibrium (LD) with the models: dominant (D) complete-penetrance",

M\u041c is a heterogeneous disease characterized by very complex cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients with MM referred to Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Varna, Bulgaria between 2017 and 2019. Bone marrow (BM) samples of 65 patients with MM at different stages of the disease were evaluated for cytogenetic analyses and 19 of them for interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (iFISH).

Gafarova Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicinebranch of Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation Purpose: To study the association of the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A gene polymorphism with depression in open male population aged 45-64 years. Methods: Under the IV screening of the international program \"HAPIEE\" and the WHO program \"MONICApsychosocial\" in 2003-2005 a representative sample of the population aged 45-64 years (n=781 of men) was surveyed. All study participants filled out the depression scale proposed by WHO MONICA-psychosocial program. The genotyping of the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A gene polymorphism was done in frame of the budgetary issue # \u0410\u0410\u0410\u0410-\u041017-117112850280-2.",

E-P04.37 Next Generation Sequencing in Marfan syndrome: rare genetic variants improve genotype phenotype correlation N. Marinakis, C. Sofocleous, E. Tsoutsou, D. Veltra, M. Sviggou, J. Traeger-Synodinos, E. Fryssira National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece Introduction: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with a prevalence of 1 per 5000 individuals. MFS is characterized by early aortic thoracic dilatations/aneurysms, defects of the skeletal and ocular systems, tall stature, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum, joint hypermobility and ectopia lentis. Mutations in the Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) are the most common cause of MFS. Nevertheless, mutations in other genes (e.g. TGFBR1, FLNA, COL5A1, SLC2A10, ADAMTSL4, CBS, SMAD3,TGFB2, MED12, FBN2, PLOD1, BMPR2 etc.) have also been associated with MFS. New technologies, such as Next Generation Sequencing, contribute to the identification of known and novel mutations in these genes.Materials and methods: Clinical information and peripheral blood samples were collected from 25 patients with Marfan or Marfan-like phenotype and heart defects. DNA extraction and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), analysing approximately 19.000 genes dispersed throughout the genome-were applied.Results: WES analysis revealed positive results in 17 patients, accomplishing a diagnostic yield of 68%. Causative alterations included 14 known and novel pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, 1 in the FBN2 gene, 1 in the BMPR2 gene and 1 in the SLC2A10 gene.Conclusion: WES can support definitive diagnosis in patients with Marfan or Marfan-like phenotypes, contributing to precise prognosis, systematic monitoring, and when appropriate, identification of other family members. NGS supports marked improvement in diagnostic-yield for numerous inherited disorders including Marfan Syndrome, especially in the case of nonFBN1 variants.

Later, high-throughput screening in cardiomyopathy cohorts determined a prominent role for FLNC in isolated hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies (HCM and DCM). FLNC variants are now among the more prevalent causes of genetic DCM. FLNC-associated DCM is associated with a malignant clinical course and a high risk of sudden cardiac death. The clinical spectrum of FLNC suggests different pathomechanisms related to variant types and their location in the gene. Proper functioning of FLNC is crucial for structural integrity and cell signaling of the sarcomere. The secondary protein structure of FLNC is critical to ensure this function. Truncating variants with subsequent haploinsufficiency are associated with DCM and cardiac arrhythmias. Interference with the dimerization and folding of the protein leads to aggregate formation detrimental for muscle function, as found in HCM and MFM. Variants associated with HCM are predominantly missense variants which cluster in the ROD2 domain. This domain is important for binding to the sarcomere and ensure proper cell signaling.

The parents are healthy heterozygous carriers of these variants, as was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Pathogenic variants of the TSEN54 are causative in extremely rare pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) type 2A, 4 and 5. The combination of splicing and missense variants has been described in only one case of PCH5 so far, resulting in recurrent fetal lethality. Therefore, we suggest the TSEN54 pathogenic variants could have been the cause of previous recurrent abortions in the presented family. This case showed the usefulness and effectivity of our molecular diagnostics algorithm enhanced by NGS approaches to elucidate the molecular genetic causes in heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders.

K\u00f6nigBioscientia, Ingelheim, GermanyA consanguine Pakistani couple with two daughters affected by intellectual disability and developmental delay has been investigated by genetic diagnostics. The younger girl has more severe development delay and shows in contrast to her sister microcephaly, craniosynostosis and autistic behaviour. Whole exome sequencing of the more severe affected sister revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant in PEX5 -a gene known to be causative for autosomal recessive Refsum syndrome. Segregation analysis confirmed homozygosity of the variant in the other sister and heterozygosity of the parents. Whole exome sequencing did not detect another potential pathogenic variant.Thus, it can be concluded that the detected PEX5 variant causes a Refsum syndrome with uncharacteristic features and a high intrafamilial variability.

Chareonsirisuthigul 2 1 Thammasat University, Klong-Luang, Thailand, 2 Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand Introduction: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome with a wide variety of clinical features. However, there are no clinical criteria for diagnosis; confirmation is solely by genetic tests. Normally, these tests are only performed if clinicians recognize signs and symptoms; therefore, we aimed to identify any clinical features that may help clinicians be aware of 22q11.2 DS.Materials and methods: Participants with at least two anomalies were enrolled from June 2015 -May 2018 at Thammasat University Hospital. Complete patient history and physical examinations were done; multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification analysis for 22q11.2 were performed with blood samples.Results: Out of 48 participants, we identified 11 (23%) with 22q11.2 DS. Palate anomalies, hypocalcemia, and \u2265 3 affected body systems were highly significant presentations in the 22q11.2 DS group versus the group without deletion (p <0.05). Conotruncal cardiac defects alone were insufficient for 22q11.2 DS prediction but sufficient when accompanied with other anomalies.Conclusion: A comprehensive physical examination is crucial at identifying any subtle features which may lead to testing and a definite diagnosis.Grant  from Thammasat University (Grant No.2/32/2558) K.

Conclusion: Early diagnosis of gonosomal mosaicism 45,X/46,XY enables multidisciplinary cooperation and treatment. Although the Czech Republic has a very good and longstanding tradition of primary care which enables the diagnosis in most cases to be reached by puberty there are still some adult patients who remain undiagnosed.

Patients show unusual facial features, microcephaly, growth and/or developmental delay, various skin abnormalities and pancytopenia, which is associated with combined immunodeficiency.Case Description: 12-year old patient with obvious syndromic features with severe microcephaly, very short stature and a very low body weight. Bird-like facial features, resembling Seckel's syndrome or Fanconi anemia patients. He had no signs of acute illness nor malignancy. The patient is of Syrian descent and is the second child of a six-member family. Parents are first-degree relatives, both reported healthy.Methodology: A custom HaloPlexHS (Agilent) NGS panel was used to investigate mutations in genes involved in Bone Marrow Failure/Severe Combined Neutropenia, Anemias and Chromosome Breakage Syndrome. Sanger sequencing performed parental carrier status. 2440C>T is a nonsense heterozygous variant which prematurely terminates the protein and is classified as pathogenic and LIG4 c.1273_1278del is an in-frame deletion classified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG recommendations. Compound heterozygous mutations in the LIG4 gene have been associated to LIG4 syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. Parental testing revealed that LIG4 c.2440C>T variant was maternally inherited and the LIG4 c.1273_1278delAGAGAA variant was paternally inherited.Conclusion: The patient is compound heterozygous for the pathogenic (c.2440C>T) and likely pathogenic (c.1273_1278del) variants in the LIG4 gene, consistentwith LIG4 syndrome diagnosis.

E-P19.06 Genetic variants of BRCA1 exon 11 in Libyan breast cancer patients H. Elshwekh, I. Alhudiri, H. Abdul Jalil, A. Mohamed, A. Elkikli, N. Jornaz, N. Enattah Biotechnology Research Centre, Tripoli, Libyan Arab JamahiriyaIntroduction: The majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers are associated with mutations in two genes, breast cancer type 1 and 2 susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2). Here we describe for the first time analysis of BRCA1 exon 11 in 48 Libyan breast cancer patients with family history of cancer.Materials and methods: All patients had family history of cancer and were included in the study only if they have family history of breast or ovarian cancer, male breast cancer or triple negative tumours. PCR was performed using specific primer pairs spanning BRCA1 exon 11 followed by Sanger sequencing. Genetic analysis was done using Sequencher\u00ae5.1.Results: We identified 12 genetic variants in BRCA1 exon 11. Three variants were novel (c.1019T>C c.2363T>G, c.3192T>C); c.2363T>G is predicted by SIFT as damaging. Six variants were of unknown significance(c.918T>C, c.1853G>C, c.1886G>A, c.2215A>G, c.2612C>T, c.3113A>C, c.3784T>C), and 3 were classified as benign in ClinVar database (c.918T>C, c.2082C>T, c.2311T>C). Conclusions: Scanning of the entire BRCA1 is needed to identify any associated deleterious mutations. Although the clinical importance of unclassified variants is unknown, the association of certain variants with deleterious mutations and contralateral breast cancer warrants genetic testing and counseling in Libyan population.

Boussetta 1 , L. Cherni 1,2 , A. J. Pakstis 3 , N. Ben Salem 1 , S. Elkamel 1 , H. Khodjet-el-khil 4 , K. K. Kidd 3 , A. Benammar-Elgaaied 1Introduction: The COMT gene encodes for catechol-Omethyl-transferase enzyme that has the major role in the regulation of synaptic catecholamine neurotransmitters. Many variants of the COMT gene have been described and some of them are in strong linkage disequilibrium defining haplotypes associated with the enzyme activity level. Our aim is to investigate the haplotypic distribution of the COMT gene markers in North African population in order to assess their usefulness in investigating North African population genetic structure.Materials and methods: Four markers (rs2020917, rs4818, rs4680, rs9332377) have been typed in 275 North African populations using TaqMan technology. Haplotypes have been phased. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), Fst distance matrix and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were performed. For comparative analyses, data from the 59 Kidd Lab populations and the 1000 Genome Project, were used.Results: Our main findings show that COMT activity prediction, according to LD performance, could be limited to rs4818-rs4680 micro-haplotypes. North Africans and South Asians show intermediate frequency values (20% and 25% respectively) of the low activity (CG) haplotype when compared to those of African populations and East Asians that show frequencies of 55% and 40% respectively, and to European populations frequency of 10%. Fst genetic distance and PCA analysis showed genetic differentiation between Africans, North African, Europeans, East and South Asians according to their significant haplotype frequency differences.Conclusion: The high level of genetic diversity of COMT haplotypes along with different LD levels can be useful tool for population genetic studies and included in ancestry informative panels.Grants: MHESR.

A total of 1706 subjects (n=596 ACL rupture patients (cases); n=1113 controls) from Italy (n=52 cases; n=81 controls), Japan (n=74 cases; n=395 controls), Poland (n=237 cases; n=230 controls) and Russia (n=233 cases; n=407 controls) participated in the study. DNA samples were genotyped by Taq-Man. R packages were used for statistical analysis. The genotype distributions of all control groups were in HWE. Since the Italian, Polish and Russian samples had similar genotype distributions (all p>0.05) they were pooled together (European cases and controls). Significant differences in ACTN3 rs1815739 genotype frequencies were found between cases and controls in the European sample (Fisher's Exact Test, p=0,048). The XX genotype was underrepresented in the cases (odds ratio (OR)=0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50-0.95, P=0.021) in comparison with controls. The same trend has been showed between cases and controls in the Japanese population (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.30-1.006, P = 0.05).

We evaluated twenty-two cases resulted negative to aCGH and karyotyping and found the causative lesion in four of them. Herein, we describe two paradigmatic solved cases: one without any definite clinical suspicion (F1), and the other in which the diagnosis was suggested (F2). Libraries were prepared using the SureSelect QXT Clinical Research Exome V2 kit (Agilent) on blood samples collected from patients and family members, and were run on NextSeq550 instrument (Illumina). F1: the female proband presents delayed psychomotor development, polymicrogyria, gastroesophageal reflux and facial dysmorphisms. The analysis identified the novel de novo missense variant c.C625G:p. H209D in the DDX3X gene, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in neurogenesis. Mutations in DDX3X were described as causative of X-Linked Dominant Mental Retardation (OMIM #300958) and variants mapping in the same domain are associated to the specific phenotypic traits of the proband (Lennox et al., bioRxiv, 2018) . F2: two siblings were suspected to have Ochoa Syndrome (AR), characterized by congenital urinary bladder dysfunction. In both sibs, the analysis revealed the novel homozygous splicing variant c.1478-2A>G in the LRIG2 gene (OMIM #608869), associated with Ochoa Syndrome. This variant probably alters the proper splicing mechanism, leading to an aberrant mRNA maturation and unfunctional protein (ongoing experiments). Our report expands the genotypic spectrum of the pathogenetic variants of DDX3X and LRIG2 disease-genes. In these cases, WES approach allowed us to get closer to the end of these diagnostic odysseys.G Introduction: Brain disorders are constantly associated with copy number variations (CNVs). Increase in CNV burden is common in psychiatric disorders, leading to disruptions of shared biological processes. However, there is a lack of approaches used for uncovering pathogenic pathways/CNVs in brain diseases using genomic data.Materials and methods: Here, we propose an algorithm -\"CNV laundering\"for CNV/pathway prioritization in brain disorders. Algorithm's stages are (1) CNV data is obtained and checked for recurrence (recurrent CNVs excluded); (2) ontology and expression of CNV genes obtained (genes not expressed in the brain excluded); (3) gene-gene interactions are retrieved; (4) candidate pathways obtained by analyzing the set of interacting genes; (5) pathway prioritization and clusterization using a novel prioritization criterion (number of CNV genes in a pathway/ total number of pathway genes). Using the algorithm and Affymetrix CytoScan HD microarray, we analyzed 191 genomes of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital abnormalities (patient inclusion criteria: absence of CNVs larger than 500 kbp).Results: The most significant pathway clusters were determined as \"proteasome\", \"neurodegenerative diseases\", \"regulation of TP53\", \"vesicles functioning\", \"signaling by NOTCH\", \"actin functioning\".Conclusions: \"CNV data laundering\" allows for pathway and CNV prioritization. The application of the algorithm provides for accumulation of knowledge about the mechanisms of brain disease both in individual cases and in certain disorders. Supported by . L. J.

Satiz\u00e1bal Soto 1, 4 Objective: To examine linkages between mitochondrial genetics and preterm birth by assessing the risk for preterm birth associated with the inheritance of nuclear haplotypes that are ancestrally distinct from mitochondrial haplogroup.Study design: Genome-wide genotyping studies of cohorts of preterm and term individuals were evaluated. We determined the mitochondrial haplogroup and nuclear ancestry for individuals and developed a scoring for the degree to which mitochondrial ancestry is divergent from nuclear ancestry.Results: Infants with higher degrees of divergent mitochondrial ancestry were at increased risk for preterm birth (0.124 for preterm vs 0.105 for term infants; P < .05). This finding was validated in 1 of 2 replication cohorts. We also observed that greater degrees of divergent ancestry correlated with earlier delivery within the primary study population, but this finding was not replicated in secondary cohorts born preterm.Conclusions: Individuals with divergent patterns of mitochondrial and nuclear ancestry are at increased risk for preterm birth. These findings may in part explain the higher rates of preterm birth in African Americans and in individuals with a matrilineal family history of preterm birth. Introduction: Anencephaly is a lethal anomaly of the central nervous system from the group of neural tube defects. The main goal of our study was to evaluate the incidence of anencephaly (and its possible trends) during the long-term period.Methods: For this study, we have used data from the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies of the Czech Republic. We analyzed the incidence of anencephaly in births and in prenatally diagnosed cases in the 1964-2016 period. We also evaluated maternal age in these cases. The statistical analysis was performed by Poisson regression and Fisher's exact test.Results: During the study period there were 6 891 062 children born in the Czech Republic. Among those, 1232 children were born with anencephaly. Another 966 cases of anencephaly were diagnosed during prenatal diagnosis and these pregnancies were electively terminated, the total number of anencephaly cases was 2198. The total incidence of anencephaly significantly decreased during the study period (p = 0.0136). The incidence in births decreased significantly as well (p <0.001). We found statistically higher incidence of anencephaly in elder mothers (42 years and over).Discussion: Gradual implementation of ultrasound prenatal diagnostics started in the 80s of the last century and lead to a very significant decrease in the incidence of anencephaly cases in births. Additionally, the total incidence of anencephaly decreased significantly as well. We found significantly higher incidence of anencephaly in elder mothers (42 years and over).Supported Introduction: DNA damage due to toxic heavy metals (HMs) is a global public health concern. Unregulated DNA damage leads to aberrant gene expression and may initiate disease processes. This study aimed to investigate impact of dietary nutrients in modulating DNA damage due to HMs in non-occupationally exposed Malaysian women.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 134 Malay women aged between 20 to 50 years. Hair samples were collected from occipital region of the scalp. Concentrations of four HMs were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Degree of DNA damage was detected using Alkaline-Comet assay. Hundred cells were randomly selected and scored using online software for evaluating four comet assay parameters. Participant's daily energy, macro and micro nutrient intake were extracted from a food frequency questionnaire.Results: The basal level of DNA strand breaks was 11.49 \u00b15.67 (%DNA in comet tail mean \u00b1 SD). Mean concentrations of arsenic, mercury, chromium and cadmium were 0.1318 \u00b1 0.329, 0.984 \u00b1 4.107, 6.151 \u00b1 4.3487, and 0.201 \u00b1 0.868 mg/kg respectively. After adjustment for covariates, significantly lower cadmium levels were found for high vitamin D intake (p=0.043) and significantly lower chromium levels were found for high calcium intake (p=0.043). High intake of manganese had positive impact (p=0.031) on comet tail DNA in individuals with high concentrations of hair arsenic.Conclusion: Specific dietary nutrients may modulate heavy metal induced DNA damage in non-occupationally exposed individuals. Objectives: To distinguish between one or multiple mutational events among the Portuguese Val30Met TTR-FAP kindreds, through characterization of the genetic background surrounding Val30Met locus and to estimate the age of ancestral mutational event(s).Methods: From the largest Val30Met TTR-FAP database worldwide we carried out an extensive family-based haplotype study, in 45 families from two disease clusters (Northern Coast and Inland).Results: Mean AO was significantly higher in patients from Inland than from Northern Coast (p <0.001). A common haplotype of different lengths was shared by almost all carriers, providing strong evidence of a major single-founder effect for Val30Met in these two disease clusters. We estimated that the mutational event occurred in the mid-VI century (AD) (1450-1475 years ago), spreading from P\u00f3voa de Varzim/Vila do Conde to the Inland region. Although AO variability in Val30Met Portuguese kindreds does not seem associated to different mutational origins, striking differences in the extended haplotype downstream STR D18S1133 were found between Northern Coast vs. Inland.Conclusions: 1) We were able to clarify Val30Met ancestral origins and its migration path between these two Portuguese cluster, 2) Exploring this genomic region may provide new insights on AO variability, with the identification of genetic modifiers. Introduction: It has been reported that patients with adenomas or polyps in the colon or rectum may have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. However, it is still unclear in different populations that the APC and MUTYH genetic profiling might have effect. Thus, in study we determined the incidence of APC and MUTYH mutations in patients with tubular adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Material and Methods Peripheral blood samples of 18 patients were sequenced for APC and MUTYH genes via MiSeq NGS System (Illumina). Data was analyzed by QCI-Analyze and QCI-Interpret bioinformatics tools.Results: 11 clinically significant variants in APC and MUTYH genes were detected in 55.5% (n=10) of 18 patients whom 50% of tubular adenoma, 44% adenocarcinoma and only one of hyperplastic polyp. In tubular adenoma group, 77.7% of them had at least one mutation, 6 variants in APC gene and 2 variants in MUTYH gene retrospectively. Interestingly, while 1 of APC variants is a novel, two of them are variants classified as uncertain significant. On the other hand, only 25% of adenocarcinoma patients had mutations on APC and MUTYH genes (1 in APC and 1 in MUTYH).Conclusions: Our data suggested that patients with both premalignant and malignant tumors of colorectum should undergo genetic screening for the benefit of patients and their families.M.K.

            "text": "Association between Interleukin 17A and Interleukin 17F Gene Polymorphisms and Periodontal Pathogens in Chronic Periodontitis among Libyans.Introduction: Thrombolytic therapy has significantly improved recovery in ischemic stroke (IS) patients, reduced mortality, but is followed by the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). Matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP-2) may have a significant role in the IS therapy outcome. Polymorphisms (rs243866, rs243865, rs243864, rs2285053) within the MMP-2 gene could potentially affect MMP-2 gene expression and consequently IS patients' recovery and the occurrence of HT.Aim: To analyze the correlation between genotypes and haplotypes of the selected MMP-2 gene polymorphisms on IS patients' recovery, along with testing the occurrence of HT after thrombolytic therapy.Methods: The study included 170 patients with IS treated with thrombolytic therapy. Patients' convalescence was determined using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 3 months from IS onset, where the good outcome has been defined with scores 0-1 and unfavorable with scores 2-6. Genotypisation was performed using Real-Time PCR (rs243866, rs243865, rs243864) and PCR-RFLP (rs2285053) methods. Haplotype analysis was performed by Haploview software.Results: Obtained frequencies of genotypes and alleles were in accordance with Caucasian population results. We have observed no association between any genotypes or haplotypes with thrombolytic therapy outcome and HT occurrence. Haplotypes GCTC, ATGC, GCTT and GCGC (rs243866, rs243865, rs243864, rs2285053) were the most frequent among our patients (73.2%, 17.0%, 5.6%, 1.5%, respectively). Using Solid spine of LD method, haplotype block was defined among all investigated polymorphisms within the MMP-2 gene. Patients with GCTC haplotype had less frequently repeated IS (60% Vs. 75.5%, p=0.021).Conclusion Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic synovitis. Invasive synovial pannus overproduces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and leads to synovial joints impairment. Expression of MMP is controlled by cytokines at the transcriptional level. Methotrexate (MTX), as anchor treatment in RA, could indirectly influence MMP production through cytokine expression modulation. Hence, MMP-2 promoter haplotype could affect its expression, and as a result influence disease activity and MTX response. We investigated the association of MMP-2 promoter haplotype with MTX monotherapy efficacy/toxicity.Material and methods: We included 109 RA patients. MTX efficacy was estimated using the changes in Disease activity score (DAS28) after 6 months of MTX monotherapy, according to EULAR response criteria. Adverse effects (AE) were collected during the follow-up period. Bone erosion appearance was estimated after 6 months of treatment. Genotyping for MMP-2 gene polymorphisms (rs243866, rs243865, rs2285053) was performed using the Real Time or PCR-RFLP methods. Haplotype analysis was performed using the Haploview software.Results: Investigated MMP-2 haplotypes were not associated with MTX response or overall AE. Haplotypes GCC, ATC, GCT and GTC were most frequent among our patients (64.3%, 19.2%, 11.8%, 3.6%, respectively). Using Confidence intervals LD method, haplotype block was defined between rs243866 and rs243865 MMP-2 gene polymorphisms (r2=0.74, D'=0.94). ATC haplotype was not observed among patients with nausea (n=9) while it was present in 21% of patients without this AE (p=0.03).Conclusion: According to our study MMP-2 promoter haplotype does not influence MTX therapy outcome in RA patients.M Background: Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is a calcium depended antioxidant glycoprotein and one of the HDL structures. The PON-1 coding region has the two polymorphisms L55M (163T>C) and Q192R (575A>G). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possible association between these PON-1 polymorphisms with the risk of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) in a Caucasian Greek population.Materials and methods: A total of 280 women were enrolled in this case-control study. The patient group consisted of 150 women identified as RSA patients, and the controls were 130 women with at least two successful pregnancies and without history of abortions. All individuals were genotyped for the PON-1 polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP method.Results: Statistical analysis of the results indicated that for PON-1 L55M variant the differences of genotype or allele frequencies between RSA patient and control groups were statistically significant. In contrary, no significant differences have been observed in genotype or allele frequencies among the patient and the control groups for the PON-1 Q192R variant.Conclusion: Our results indicated that the PON-1 polymorphism L55M (163T>C) may represent a useful biomarker of RSA susceptibility in the Greek Caucasian population and with combined effects of environmental factors might contribute to RSA prevalence.Introduction: Research on the effect of genetic background on Body Mass Index (BMI) in teenagers and its potential influence on adult BMI values, has unveiled the effect of various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including the rs13107325, in the SLC39A8 gene. The present analysis, focuses on the role of the rs13107325 SNP on the BMI of two teenage, European populations.Materials and methods: We used data from two European cohorts; the Greek TEENAGE study (data used for n=654) and the French STANISLAS Family Study-SFS (data used for n=509). We examined the potential effect of the rs13107325 polymorphism on the z-scores (zBMI) and logBMI of the teenagers. Analyses adjusted for age and gender, were conducted via linear regression modelling in SPSS, for the TEENAGE cohort. Given that some of the teenagers of the STANISLAS cohort could belong to the same family, we tested for potential association using the R statistical software, the GWAF and kinship2 packages, to correct for familial resemblance.Results: The rs13107325 polymorphism was related both to zBMI (\u03b2=0.23, p=0.006) and logBMI (\u03b2=0.01, p=0.005) of the Greek teenagers. The polymorphism did not display any significant associations, neither with zBMI (p=0,63), nor with logBMI (p=0.48), when referring to the French teenagers.Conclusion: Genetic background plays a major part in obesity development, even from adolescence. Variations in the effect of loci display great interest and lay the foundation for the creation of genetic scores, for the prediction of the genetically-associated obesity development risk. Male infertility affects~7% of men, but its causes remain poorly understood. The most severe form is non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), which is, in part, caused by an arrest at meiosis, but so far only few validated causal genes have been reported. To address this gap, we performed whole exome sequencing in 58 men with unexplained meiotic arrest and identified in three unrelated men the same homozygous frameshift variant c.676dup (p.Trp226LeufsTer4) in M1AP, encoding meiosis 1 arresting protein. This variant results in a truncated protein lacking 57% of its full-length as shown in vitro by heterologous expression of mutated M1AP. Next, we screened four large cohorts of 1904 infertile men from the International Male Infertility Genomics Consortium (IMIGC) and identified three additional cases carrying homozygous c.676dup and three carrying combinations of this and other likely causal variants in M1AP. Moreover, a homozygous missense variant p.(Pro389Leu) segregated with infertility in five men from a consanguineous Turkish family (LOD score = 3.28). The common phenotype between all affected men was NOA, but occasionally spermatids and rarely a few spermatozoa in the semen were observed. A similar phenotype was described for mice with disruption of M1ap. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that mutations in M1AP cause autosomal recessive severe spermatogenic failure and male infertility. In view of the evidences from several independent groups and populations, M1AP should be included in the growing list of validated male infertility genes.Introduction: When we predict the pathogenicity of a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (nsSNV), a radical change in amino acid (AA) properties is prone to be classified as being pathogenic. However, not all such nsSNVs are associated with human diseases.Materials and methods: We generated random forest (RF) models individually for each AA substitution to differentiate pathogenic nsSNVs in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and common nsSNVs in dbSNP. We named a set of our models \"Individual Meta RF (InMeRF)\".Results: Ten-fold cross-validation of InMeRF showed that the area under the curves (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves were on average 0.941 and 0.957, respectively. Variants of InMeRF and seven recently reported tools were generated by the same training dataset, and were compared using the same trifecta of benchmark datasets. Among the eight tools, ROC-AUC and PR-AUC of InMeRF were ranked first on average. Application of InMeRF to nsSNVs in the MUSK gene causing congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) showed the sensitivity and specificity of 1.000 (7/7) and 0.857 (12/14), respectively. With regard to the VANGL1 gene causing spina bifida, the sensitivity and specificity showed 0.933 (14/15) and 1.000 (8/8), respectively.Conclusions: We showed that individual modeling each AA substitution made the performance of InMeRF superior to the previously reported tools. We made the InMeRF web service program, and also made genome-wide InMeRF scores available online at https://www.med.nagoya-u.ac.jp/ neurogenetics/InMeRF/.Grant references JSPS, MHLW, AMED, and NCNP. J. Takeda Background: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is characterised by myocardial hypertrabeculation and is subject to considerable conjecture in the extent to which it represents a distinct pathology, a secondary phenotype associated with other cardiac diseases (particularly cardiomyopathies), or physiological adaptation.Methods: We performed rare variant association analysis of 840 LVNC cases and 125,748 gnomAD population controls, and compared results to similar analyses on dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).Results: We observed substantial overlap in genes and variant classes associated with LVNC and with DCM/ HCM, indicating that LVNC often represent a secondary phenotype occurring in certain patients with DCM or HCM. In contrast, truncating variants (TV) in MYH7, ACTN2 and PRDM16 were uniquely associated with LVNC and may reflect a distinct LVNC aetiology. MYH7 TV, generally considered non-pathogenic for cardiomyopathies, were 20fold enriched in LVNC cases over controls. Carriers of MYH7 TV in the UK Biobank and healthy volunteers also displayed significantly greater non-compaction compared to matched controls, with 50% meeting the diagnostic criteria for LVNC. Large deletions in RYR2 and missense variants in the transmembrane region of HCN4 were also enriched in LVNC, supporting prior reports of association with arrhythmogenic LVNC phenotypes.Conclusions: While LVNC is characterised by substantial genetic overlap with DCM and HCM, it can also present with a distinct genetic profile involving TV in MYH7, ACTN2 and PRDM16 and with variants associated with joint LVNC/arrhythmia phenotypes. These results will enhance the application of LVNC genetic testing and help to distinguish pathological from physiological non-Trans-acting expression quantitative trait loci (trans-eQTLs) are SNPs regulating the expression of distant target genes (>1Mb). Trans-eQTLs account for \u226570% heritability of gene expression levels and have great potential to uncover the underlying biological mechanisms of complex diseases. However, trans-eQTLs are more challenging to identify than locally-acting cis-eQTLs because of their small effect sizes and the severe multiple-testing burden. Furthermore, strong gene expression correlations entails strong correlations among SNP-gene association P-values. Our method Tejaas can discover trans-eQTLs by performing L2-regularized 'reverse' multiple regression of each SNP on all gene expression levels, aggregating evidence from many small trans-effects while being unaffected by the strong expression correlations. Tejaas, coupled with a novel knearest neighbors confounder correction, discovers 18851 unique trans-eQTLs across 49 tissues from the GTEx(v8) data. They are enriched to occur in various functional regions of the genome, including DHS sites (1.32x enrichment) , open chromatin (1.19x) , enhancer (1.31x) and promoter (1.10x) regions. They overlap with known cis-eQTLs (1.24x enrichment) from the GTEx analysis and are 1.09x enriched to be located within 100kb of known transcription factors. They are also enriched in reporter assay QTL regions of K562 (1.79x) and HepG2 (3.29x) cells indicating regulatory activity. Many trans-eQTLs overlap with disease-associated SNPs from GWAS, revealing tissue-specific transcriptional regulation mechanisms that drive disease etiology. For example, trans-eQTLs discovered in whole blood show enrichment in GWAS for blood traits, while heart and aorta have enrichment in cardiometabolic traits. Thyroid and pancreas trans-eQTLs show enrichments for endocrine system diseases. Tejaas is open-source and available online (https://github.com/ soedinglab/tejaas). Lung adenocarcinoma (AC) is one of the most common histological subtypes in the word. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the most common oncogene mutated in lung AC. Cellular Retinol Binding Protein-1 (CRBP1) is a small cytoplasmatic protein regulating retinol bioavailability and transcriptional activities and it is linked to EGFR signalling. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are major epigenetic factor that play a key role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, in the regulation of retinoic acid and are also implicated in Copy Number Variation (CNV). In order to find a possible regulatory mechanism in the pathology of lung AC, we investigated the relationship between CRBP1 and EGFR through the analysis of miRNAs expression. miRNAs, CNV analysis, gene and protein expression were performed in lung AC patients with high (CRBP1 HIGH ) and low (CRBP1 LOW ) CRBP1 expression, and in adenocarcinoma cells transfected with CRBP1 (CRBP1+ A549 cells). Twenty-three miRNAs were found deregulated in CRBP1+ A549 cells and eight in patients with Introduction: Hearing loss is a highly penetrant phenotype in NLRP3-related autoinflammatory disorders. A recent study revealed potential medical treatment of hearing loss with anakinra (anti-interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) in selected cases. However, for severely aggravated hearing loss not responsive to anakinra, cochlear implantation (CI) would be the last resort for hearing rehabilitation. Outcome of CI is not clearly elucidated yet in this emerging type of hearing loss related to NLRP3-related autoinflammatory disorders, which has a systemic nature and ubiquitous distribution of resident macrophages involving the spiral ganglion neuron and the cochlear nerve. Here, we report the successful outcome of CI in NLRP3-related autoinflammatory disorder.Materials and methods: Three subjects representing each type of NLRP3-related autoinflammatory disorder: CINCA (chronic infantile, neurological, cutaneous, and articular) syndrome; MWS (Muckle-Wells syndrome); and DFNA34, who underwent CI for auditory rehabilitation, were recruited. Phenotypes as well as genotypes were reviewed in the subjects and audiologic performances before/after CI over time were evaluated.Results: All three subjects showed excellent audiological outcomes with rapid improvement of speech perception test result reaching plateau at 3 months after CI, although distribution of the disease predicted poor outcome based on theoretical analysis.Conclusions: This is the first report to present outcome of CI among subjects with a confirmed NLRP3 genetic etiology and resultant systemic inflammation, and suggests that CI is a viable treatment option in this disease entity.

            "text": "Introduction: The AI techniques, machine learning and deep learning, offer great potential for advancing genomic medicine. However, their application has yet to generate clearly improved outcomes in clinical genomics, and the discovery potential within genomic datasets remains largely untapped.Objectives and methods: Our analysis sets out to determine the early stage practical policy actions for capitalising on the opportunities AI presents for genomic medicine, minimising harms and expediting its effective delivery into healthcare. Informed by a combination of literature review and expert interviews, we examine the state of AI applications for genomic medicine and determine the major challenges to realising its full potential.Results: We identify a number of interconnected issues and barriers to progress, including: the quality and accessibility of AI training data; ethnic bias in genomic datasets; challenges in replicating AI methods and results; fragmentation of skills and infrastructure; data security and privacy concerns; and regulatory uncertainty around requirements and the status of AI algorithms within clinical genomics. The imperative to address these issues is heightened given the fast pace of AI activity in genomics.We set out seven urgent policy priorities to meeting these challenges. They include taking action to establish the right skills, digital infrastructure, and cross-discipline collaborations; mitigate against algorithmic bias; prioritise AI development for the most pressing and clinically relevant problems; support community driven efforts to benchmark and review new algorithms; and establish the clinical governance arrangements for AI applications in clinical genomics. Action to achieve these priorities is key to harnessing AI.S. Raza: None. We present a first epidemiological survey from North Cyprus to determine predictive factors for breast cancer subtypes. More than 300 breast cancer patients with subtype information are surveyed from the State Hospital in Nicosia between 2006-2015 for their demographic, reproductive, genetic, epidemiological factors. The breast cancer subtypes, Estrogen receptor (ER) +/-, Progesterone receptor (PR) +/-, and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) +/status, are determined. Single and multiple variable, regularized regressions, with predictive factors as independent variables, breast cancer subtypes as dependent variables are conducted. Our cohort differs significantly from larger cohorts (eg Breast Cancer Family Registry), in age, menopause status, age of menarche, parity, education, oral contraceptive use, breast feeding but the distribution of breast subtypes is not significantly different. Subtype distribution in our cohort is also not different from another Turkish cohort. We show that the ER+ subtype is positively related to post-menopause and negatively associated with hormone therapy; ER+/PR+ is positively associated with age and breast feeding, and negatively associated with cancer grade and having first-degreerelative with cancer. HER2+, which is negatively correlated with ER+ and ER+/PR+, is positively related to having firstdegree-relative with cancer, and negatively associated with post-menopause. Regressions identify older age to be positively correlated to ER+ and ER+/PR+, negatively correlated to HER2+. Assuming ER+ and ER+/PR+ to have better prognostic, post-menopause and breast-feeding are beneficial, hormone therapy treatment is detrimental. Next steps include biomarkers and cure models to determine longterm Introduction: Warburg Micro syndrome type1 (WARBM1) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome caused by homozygous mutation in the RAB3GAP1 gene. It is characterized by microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, optic atrophy, cortical dysplasia, mental retardation and hypogonadism. We are reporting three cases with two novel splicing mutations and one including microduplication of 3q29.Materials: Case 1 is a 8-year-old female with neuromotor retardation and spasticity. Parents were consanguineous having 3 affected children. She had microphthalmia, nystagmus, bilateral optic atrophy, operated congenital cataracts and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Case 2 is a sixmonth old male with microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, diffuse cerebral atrophy and cryptorchidism. Case 3 is a 21-month-old female having neuromotor retardation, hypotonia and epilepsy. She had microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, cerebral atrophy and corpus callosum hypoplasia.Methods: RAB3GAP1 gene was analyzed by DNA sequencing. In Case2 mRNA was isolated to generate to cDNA by reverse transcription, and exon 7-9 were analyzed.Results: In case 1 homozygous c.974-2A>G novel splicing mutation was detected in two sisters tested. In case 2 homozygous c.748+1G>A mutation was identified. cDNA analysis of exon 7-9 showed exon 8 skipping. In case 3 homozygous c.2606+1G>A novel splicing mutation was detected. A-CGH analysis revealed 1.7 Mb microduplication of 3q29.Conclusions: Novel splicing mutations in case1 at 11. intronic splice site and in case 3 at 22. intronic splice site probably affects splicing where functional studies are planned. Functional study in case 2 showed exon 8 skipping. Case 3 is the first reported case with WARBM1 and microduplication of 3q29. Objective: We describe the usefulness of metabolomic analysis patients with the severe form of this condition, whom usually present symptoms during the first weeks of life.Methods: We present the case of a five months Colombian patient, who presented focal symptomatic refractory epilepsy, hypotonia and bilateral cataracts. Metabolic studies showed normal or non-conclusive results. By the time when the metabolomic test was considered, the clinical condition was critical, with severe hypotonia, refractory seizures, and sepsis, and finally, the patient dies. Analysis by non-targeted metabolomics in plasma was performed (Metabolon Inc.) This test identifies molecules between 50-1,500 Daltons (Da). The identification is performed using four different types of high-performance Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) instruments paired with Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/MS). The identification of each molecule is confirmed against a proprietary chemical library consisting of accurate molecular weight/mass plus information on any adductation, in source fragmentation, and/or polymerization, retention time/ index on the chromatography columns, and mass spectral fragmentation patterns.Results: Metabolomic analysis demonstrated low levels of glycine, lactate, and serine. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency was considered, because all the biomarkers associated with the metabolomic biochemical signature of this disorder were outside the expected range.Conclusion: Metabolomic analysis is useful for the diagnosis of Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, and it is also a valuable tool for the study of patients with suspected metabolic disease. Introduction: H syndrome and Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) are rare autosomal recessive genodermatoses with multisystemic manifestations mainly caused by mutations in the SLC29A3 gene which encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter hENT3.Materials and methods: Mutations analysis of SLC29A3 gene, was performed, using direct Sanger sequencing, for three unrelated Tunisian family with phenotypic overlap, associating features of RDD and H syndrome.Results: In this study, molecular analysis revealed the presence of a known homozygous missense mutation c.1088G> A: p.Arg363Gln in 6 patients, 5 of whom were related. A heterozygous compound mutation c.300 + 1G> A / 1088G> A was also noted in a patient with H syndrome. Five of our patients carrying the same mutation c.1088G>A and belonging to the same family have presented with distinct clinical manifestations, indeed 4 were carriers of the H syndrome, whereas the 5th patient was diagnosed with RDD. The analysis of the haplotype of patients originated from the center and south of Tunisia is considered to determine if it is a founding haplotype. We carried out a haplotype-based analysis by way of genotyping 5 microsatellite markers flanking the SLC29A3 gene spanning a region of 2 Mb. Microsatellite markers analysis in all affected sibling indicates that all c.1088G>A mutation carriers harbored the same haplotype, indicating common ancestor.Conclusions: This finding could be explained by the high rate of consanguinity in our country. Other factors, genetic, epigenetic and/or environmental may have a role in determining intra and interfamilial variation in tissue involvement and severity of the disease. Introduction: Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) identification has been low worldwide, including in Malaysia. Primary care as initial contact for patients can play a vital role in the identification of individuals with FH.Methods: Patients attending two Primary Care Clinics in Malaysia between July to December 2019 were recruited to the study. Consented patients were required to fill in sociodemographic and family history questionnaires, and patients' lipid profile were obtained from their clinical notes. Patients' risk of FH were calculated using Simon Broome(SB), Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria(DLCC) and FAMCAT criteria. Patients with high risk of FH(SB possible and definite, DLCC\u22656, and FAMCAT> 1 in 200) were then referred to the Specialist Lipid Clinic for confirmation through genetic testing.Results: 1,191 patients were approached during the study period, out of which 637 (53.48%) patients agreed to participate. Only 619 (51.97%) patients met the eligibility criteria. 65 (5.46%) patients had high risk of FH and required referral to Lipid Clinic, however, only 52 (4.37%) patients agreed to be referred. Among the 619 patients recruited, the mean age was 58.09 (SD 12.44), male 310 (50.08%), majority is of Malay ethnicity (542, 87.56%), married (548, 88.53%), and had tertiary education (297,",
