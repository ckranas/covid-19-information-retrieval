            "text": "Introduction: Leukocyte dysfunction may play a role in sepsis pathogenesis. Established evidence showed that leukocyte dysfunction leads to reduced immune response and consequently an increased sepsis-related mortality. Impaired metabolism has been recently proposed as one possible mechanisms underpinning leukocyte dysfunction in sepsis. In this study, we investigated the global changes in leukocyte metabolism in sepsis, using an established in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy volunteers (n=4) and incubated with 62.5 ng/mL LPS. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using Agilent Seahorse XF Analyzer (Cell Mito Stress Test Kit). Total cellular oxidative stress was measured using DCFDA Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Detection Assay Kit (Abcam) and mitochondrial superoxide was measured using MitoSOXTM (Life Technology). Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Abcam). Evaluation of oxidative stress and apoptosis were performed using BD FACSCanto flow cytometer and flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo Software V10. Results: LPS stimulation of PBMC from healthy volunteers showed a trend of decrease in both oxidative phosphorylation and cellular respiration (Fig. 1) . This decrease in cellular metabolism was accompanied by a trend towards an increase in cell death in the stimulated leukocytes (Fig. 2) . The increase in cell death was associated with an increase in oxidative stress (total and mitochondria) (Fig. 2) , suggesting that the adverse effect of LPS on cellular metabolism may be mediated by an imbalance in redox potential. Conclusions: The LPS stimulation model could provide a useful approach to study the effect of sepsis on leukocyte metabolism. Further study is required to better understand the mechanism of reduced leukocyte metabolism, including the possible role of oxidative stress in reducing cellular respiration and causing leukocyte cell death.",

            "text": "The relationship between systemic glycocalyx degradation markers and regional glycocalyx thickness in non-septic critically ill patients is unclear. Conjunctival sidestream dark fieldimaging for the purpose of glycocalyx thickness estimation has never been performed. We aimed to investigate whether changes in glycocalyx thickness in conjunctival and sublingual mucosa are associated with global glycocalyx shedding markers. Methods: In this single-centre prospective observational study, using techniques for direct in-vivo observation of the microcirculation, we performed a single measurement of glycocalyx thickness in both ocular conjunctiva and sublingual mucosa in mixed cardio surgical (n=18) and neurocritical patients (n=27) and compared these data with age-matched healthy controls (n=20). In addition we measured systemic syndecan-1 levels Results: In the sublingual and conjunctival region we observed a significant increase of the perfused boundary region (PBR) in both neuro critical and cardiac surgical ICU patients, compared to controls (2.20 7 ], p<0,05). We detected a weak correlation between syndecan-1 and sublingual PBR(r=0.40, p=0.002) but no correlations between global glycocalyx damage markers and conjuctival glycocalyx thickness. Conclusions: Conjunctival glycocalyx thickness evaluation using SDF videomicroscopy is suitable and is impaired in non-septic ICU patients but only measurements in sublingual mucosa are correlating with systemic glycocalyx shedding markers. Global glycocalyx damage is more severe in cardiac comparing to neuro critical patients. Introduction: Endothelial dysfunction plays a major role in the sepsis related organ dysfunction, and is featured by vascular leakage. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to regulate actin cytoskeleton organization and interendothelial junctions (IEJs), contributing to endothelial barrier integrity. We have already demonstrated its role in defence against sepsis induced hyperpermeability [1] , but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This project aims to identify molecular targets involved in the beneficial action of AMPK against endothelial barrier dysfunction. Methods: Experiments have been performed in human microvascular dermal endothelial cells. \u03b11AMPK activity has been modulated via the use of a specific siRNA or treatment by two pharmacological AMPK activators (AICAr, 991). We have investigated the effect of this modulation on the expression/phosphorylation of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), two proteins playing a key role in maintenance of IEJs and actin dynamics respectively. Results: We show that \u03b11AMPK is required to sustain the level of Cx43 expression as it was drastically reduced in cells transfected with a siRNA targeting specifically \u03b11AMPK. Regarding HSP27, its expression level was not affected by \u03b11AMPK deletion. However, both AMPK activators increased its phosphorylation on Ser82, in a \u03b11AMPKdependent manner, while they had no effect on Cx43. Our results also reveal that HSP27 phosphorylation concurred with the appearance of actin stress fibers at the periphery of cells, suggesting a beneficial role for pHSP27 as well as F-actin stress fibers in vascular barrier function through reinforcing the endothelial tethering. Conclusions: Our work identifies the regulation of Cx43 expression and HSP27 phosphorylation as potential protective responses underlying the beneficial action of AMPK against endothelial barrier dysfunction. AMPK could consequently represent a new therapeutic target during sepsis.",

SIC is clinically manifested with left ventricle impaired contractility (2) . Melusin is a muscle-specific protein involved in sustaining cardiomyocyte survival thorough the activation of AKT signaling pathways (3) . PI3K-AKT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating calcium channel activity (4) . We hypothesized that Melusin overexpression could exert a protective effect on cardiac function during septic injury. Methods: Animals were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 12 mg/kg. SV129 strain Knockout mice (KO) for Melusin gene and FVB strain with cardiac-specific overexpression (OV) of Melusin were compared. Each group was studied together with a control group (WT). Hemocardiac parameters were studied at 0 hour and 6 hours through echocardiography. Another cohort of animals was sacrificed 6 hours after 20 mg/kg LPS treatment and cardiac tissues and blood sample were harvested for Wb analysis to quantify the expression of AKT, P-AKT and CACNA1C and Elisa analysis for Troponin levels. Results: SV129 WT, KO Melusin and FVB WT mice groups, fractional shortening (FS) was significantly impaired after LPS challenge and was associated with compensatory tachycardia (Fig. 1) . FVB OV mice group didn't show decrease in FS. Consistent with the increased AKT phosphorylation observed in OV mice, the expression of CACNA1C was also significantly higher both at basal levels and after LPS treatment in OV mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 2) . Troponin levels didn't differ between mice groups after LPS treatment Conclusion: Melusin has protective role in LPS induced cardiomyopathy, likely through Akt phosphorylation controlling the CACNA1C protein density.",

Since altered liver function has also been described in ICU patients without sepsis [1, 2] , the influence of sepsis may be overestimated. We hypothesized that sedation and prolonged mechanical ventilation after abdominal surgery is associated with impaired liver function independent of sepsis. Methods: Sedated and mechanically ventilated pigs underwent abdominal surgery for regional hemodynamic monitoring and were subsequently randomized to fecal peritonitis and controls, respectively (n=4, each), followed by 80 h observation. Indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate 15 minutes after injection of 0.25mg/kg ICG (ICG R15) was determined at baseline, and 11, 32 and 80 h after sepsis induction (SI), and at the same time points in controls. Concurrent with ICG R15, plasma volume, total hepatic perfusion (ultrasound transit time), and bilirubin and liver enzymes were measured. ANOVA for non-parametric repeated measurements was performed in both groups separately. Results: ICG R15 increased over time without significant differences between groups (Table 1 ). There was a parallel increase in bilirubin in septic but not control animals. The other measured parameters were similar in both groups at the end of the experiment. Conclusion: Liver function was impaired under sedation and prolonged mechanical ventilation after abdominal surgery, even in animals without sepsis. The underlying reasons should be further explored.",

AADH was produced from clinical grade heparin, resulting in preparations that have lost >99,5% of their anticoagulant activity. To gain insight into the mechanisms and the basic pharmacological aspects of AADH protective properties, we performed a systematic analysis of how AADH is tolerated in mice and ascertained its effects in three different in vivo models of inflammation and infection. Methods: Dose ranging studies, short term and medium term, were performed in C57BL/6 mice. The effects of i.v. administration of extracellular histones in the presence or absence of AADH were assessed in mice. We further analysed the effect of AADH in models of Concanavalin A-and MRSA-mediated lethality. In all studies we assessed clinical signs, lab parameters and histology. Results: AADH was well tolerated in both short term and intermediate term (till 7 days) experiments in mice, in the absence of any signs of tissue bleeding. AADH was able to revert the cytotoxic properties of i.v. administered histones. In a Concanavalin A mediated model of sterile inflammation, we confirmed that AADH has protective properties that counteract the cytotoxic effects of extracellular histones. In an in vivo lethal MRSA model, for the first time, AADH was shown to induce a survivalbenefit. Conclusions: We conclude that AADH contributes to the overall increased survival by means of neutralization of extracellular histones and represents a promising product for further development into a drug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and sepsis.",

Methods: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of rTM and APC on urokinase and tPA mediated thrombolysis utilizing thromboelastography. Results: Native whole blood was activated using a diluted intrinsic activator (APTT reagent, Triniclot). The modulation of thrombolysis by tPA and UK (Abbott, Chicago, USA) was studied by supplementing these agents to whole blood and monitoring TEG profiles. APC (Haematologic Technologies, VT, USA) and rTM (Asahi Kasai Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) were supplemented to the activated blood at 0.02 -3.0 ug/ml. The modulation of tPA and UK induced thrombolysis by APC and rTM was studied in terms of thromboelastograph patterns. The effect of both APC and rTM on plasma based systems supplemented with tPA was also investigated. Patients treated with antibiotic therapy were eligible for inclusion. The plausibility of infection (definite, probable, possible, none) was determined based on the Centers for Diseases Control (CDC) criteria. Patients with sepsis (definite/probable/possible infection and a SOFA score increase of >=2) were screened for death within 60 days and secondary infections 48 h to 60 days after ICU admission, using the CDC criteria.

More attention is given to hyperlactatemia in this patient population as a prognostic factor, although other acid-base disturbances may also have an impact on patient outcomes. Our objective is to describe the acid-base profile of this patient population and determine the association between different acid-base abnormalities and ICU mortality. Methods: Retrospective cohort of patients admitted with infection to an intensive care unit. Patients were stratified according to pH (<7.35; 7.35 -7.45; > 7.45) and, then, according to the standard base excess (SBE) (< -2; -2 -+2; > +2). In each of these strata and the whole population, the proportions of acid-base disturbances were quantified during the first 24 hours of ICU admission. To assess the association between acid-base disturbances and outcome, a logistic regression model was fit, adjusting for age, sex and SAPS 3 score.",

Introduction: High levels of some aromatic microbial metabolites (AMM) in serum are related to the severity and mortality of critically ill patients [1] . Several studies have discussed the imbalance and loss of the diversity of gut microbiota but there are practically no data on the gut microbial metabolites in critical conditions, only a little -in healthy people [2, 3] . The aim of this work is to analyze the connection between serum and fecal levels of AMM in ICU patients. Methods: 13 simultaneously serum and fecal samples (SFS) from ICU patients with nosocomial pneumonia (group I), 21 SFS from ICU neurorehabilitation patients (group II) and 5 SFS from healthy people were taken for GC/MS analyses. The following AMM were measured: phenylpropionic (PhPA), phenyllactic (PhLA), p-hydroxybenzoic (p-HBA), p-hydroxyphenyllactic (p-HPhLA), p-hydroxyphenylacetic (HPhAA), p-hydroxyphenylpropionic (p-HPhPA) and homovanillic (HVA) acids.

Twenty-three healthy adults served as controls. Outcomes were ventilator and ICU-free days, SOFA score at day 1 and 7, and need for dialysis during the course of sepsis. Results: Forty-nine patients were included (mean age 62 \u00b1 15 years). The blood of septic patients was less responsive to ex vivo stimulation with LPS than that of healthy controls, as demonstrated by lower TNF, IL1, IL6 and IL10 release ( Fig. 1 ). At day 1, patients above the 50th percentile of IL10 release had significantly fewer ventilator and ICU-free days than those in the lower 50th percentile (Fig. 2) . In contrast, patients in whom IL10 release increased between day 1 and day 7 had significantly lower SOFA scores at day 1 and 7 and need for dialysis, and more ICU-free days than patients in whom IL10 release decreased (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Conclusions: Greater LPS-stimulated IL10 release in septic patients at day 1 was associated with poorer clinical outcomes and may reflect the severity of the forthcoming immunoparalysis. However, an increase in IL10 release between day 1 and day 7 was associated with favorable outcomes, perhaps signaling immune restoration. Introduction: Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy with Cytoreductive Surgery (HIPEC-CRS) is a curative treatment modality for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Extensive debulking surgery, peritoneal stripping and multiple visceral resections followed by intraperitoneal installation of heated high-dose chemotherapeutic agents, a process leads to a 'high-inflammatory' syndrome. Serum procalcitonin (PCT), a biomarker for bacterial sepsis, in the heightened inflammatory state after HIPEC-CRS might be of limited utility. Our aim is to determine the trends of PCT in the early postoperative phase of HIPEC-CRS and to identify trends in patients with and without bacterial sepsis Methods: In a case-control design, we reviewed all patients undergoing HIPEC-CRS over a 24-month period (2015) (2016) (2017) . Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they developed bacterial sepsis in the first 5 days after surgery (infected v/s non-infected). Summary data are expressed as medians and ranges. Two-tailed nonparametric tests were performed and considered significant at p values of less than 0.05 Results: 82 patients' data was analyzed. Infections developed in 16% (13 patients) with Escherichia coli as the predominant pathogen isolated (36% isolates). PCT levels (ngm/ml) were elevated postoperatively in both infected and non-infected patients; Day 1 infected 0.97 (IQR 0. 5 Introduction: Early outcome in cardiac surgery has been an area of growing interest where the given risks raise several predictive models for assessment of postoperative outcome [1] . Procacitonin (PCT) emerges as a possible predictive tool in cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU).We aim at testing the predictive power of PCT for early morbidity, prolonged ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, in patients developing early fever after cardiac surgery Methods: A retrospective descriptive study done in tertiary cardiac center, enrolling patients who stayed for more than 24 hours post-operatively in the CTICU Risk stratification included additive Euro score and PCT immunoluminometricaly prior to surgery and every 48 hours in response to onset of fever. Results: We screened 501 consecutive patients who underwent open heart cardiac, of which 119 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the level of PCT, those with value > 2 ng/ml (Group 1) and those with level < 2 ng/ml (Group 2). Patients in group 1 as compared to Group 2, over the postoperative course was associated with prolonged ICU stay (P=0.04), length of mechanical ventilation (P=0.05), length of hospitalization (p=0.05), acute kidney injury (P=0.04) and culture positivity (P=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that PCT >2ng/ml was was significantly associated with positive cultures. (p=0.023) Conclusions: A rise of serum PCT carries the signals of early ICU morbidity and lengths of ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay Methods: 42 patients aged 153 (44-252) days (4-360 days) underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for severe congenital heart disease. In the dynamics levels of PCT, MR-proADM, CT-proAVP and MR-proANP were measured before surgery and on the 1, 2, 3 and 6 days after the operation with the Kryptor compact plus analyzer. Data are presented as medians with interquartile range. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the data. Values of p <0.05 were statistically significant.",

            "text": "Introduction: Early prediction of the risk of death among patients admitted at the Emergency Department (ED) remains an unmet need. The prognostic performance of HBP that is secreted by neutrophils was prospectively validated in a series of sequential ED admissions. Methods: HBP and elements of qSOFA were analyzed prospectively in 310 serial ED admissions (main reasons for admission: acute abdominal pain 28.4%; fever 24.5%; vomiting/diarrhea 23.9%; dyspnea 22.3%; neurologic signs 11.3%; non-specific complaints 38.1%; most patients admitted for more than one reasons). Upon ED admission patients were scored as low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk at the discretion of the physician. HBP was measured in blood samples upon admission by an enzyme immunosorbent assay. Results: HBP was significantly greater among patients who died very early (Fig. 1 ). In five out of six of patients dying early HBP was greater than 15 ng/ml. We combined HBP more than 15 ng/ml and the presence of one sign of qSOFA into a new score; this had 82.4% sensitivity to predict 30-day mortality. The respective sensitivity of two signs of qSOFA was 23.5% (p: 0.002). The use of this new score allowed better stratification of patients originally considered at the triage as low-risk into high-risk (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: We propose HBP more than 15 ng/ml and one qSOFA sign as an early score for 30-day mortality at the ED. Introduction: Despite of our growing knowledge in pathophysiology of septic shock still remain one of the most important factors of hospital mortality. It is thought that early diagnosis and treatment at early stage of septic shock would decrease its mortality. There have been on-going studies in recent years which research the usability of Heparin Binding Protein (HBP) in early diagnosis of sepsis [1] . To seek the usability of C-reactive protein (C-RP), procalcitonin (PCT) and HBP biomarker combination in early diagnosis of septic shock. Methods: 30 patients, who have the diagnosis of septic shock, that are expected to stay in intensive care unit more than 24 hours, and aged between 22-75 are included in the study. Data are collected from the patients' blood samples that are drawn on admission, on the 24th hour, and on the day of discharge or death.",

The aim of the study was to assess the variation of these hemostatic parameters in critically ill patients during the course of a septic episode. Methods: We monitored 34 septic patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 23 improved (group A) while 11 deteriorated (group B). We assessed vWF, ADAMTS-13 and the vWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio on admission in ICU (time point 0) and at the time of a change in patients' clinical condition (remission or deterioration, time point 1).

In addition, no validated prognostic tool is currently available. Therefore, identification of patients at high risk of worsening in the ED is key. The TRIAGE objective was to assess the prognostic value of a blood marker panel to predict early clinical worsening of patients admitted in the ED with suspected sepsis. Methods: TRIAGE was a prospective, multicenter (11 sites in France and Belgium) study on biological samples conducted in partnership with bioMerieux S.A. Patients admitted in the ED with suspected or confirmed community-acquired infection for less than 72h were included. Exclusion criteria were: admission in the ED for more than 12 hours, septic shock at admission, immunodepression, sepsis syndrome 30 days prior to admission. The protocol included 5 clinical and biological time points (H0, H6, H24, H72, D28). Patients were classified in 3 groups at admission (infection, sepsis, severe sepsis) and divided into 2 evolution/prognosis groups depending on worsening or not from their initial condition to severe sepsis or septic shock and SOFA score's evolution. The evolution criteria were centrally evaluated by an independent adjudication committee of sepsis experts including emergency physicians and intensivists. Patients were followed up to day 28 for mortality. Results: The study duration was 3 years with 600 patients included (102 excluded). The centralized analysis is in progress to select the combination of biomarkers with the best prognostic performance comparing both evolution/prognosis groups. Currently, 125 patients have been classified as worsening and some results will be available in 2018.",

Seven genes showed significant differences in expression levels between the healthy volunteers and patient groups: CD3D, CD74, CTLA4 & CX3CR1 were down-regulated, while IL-10, IL1RN and S100A9 were up-regulated in the patient populations. The use of relative quantitative difference of some markers was able to distinguish and Introduction: Early, rapid diagnosis is integral to the efficient effective treatment of sepsis; however, there is no gold standard for diagnosis, and biochemical surrogates are of limited and controversial utility. The CytoVale system measures biophysical properties of cells by imaging thousands of single cells per second as they are hydrodynamically stretched in a microfluidic channel. This platform has been shown to measure dozens of mechanical, morphological, and cell surface biomarkers of WBC activation simultaneously [1, 2] . In this study, we show the performance of the CytoVale system in measuring biophysical markers for sepsis detection in the emergency department (ED). Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved prospective cohort study of Emergency Department (ED) patients with 2+ SIRS criteria and evidence of organ dysfunction. 307 patients were included for analysis. Blood samples for the Cytovale assay were collected in the ED, and the diagnosis of sepsis was adjudicated by blinded clinician review of the medical record. Captured imaging data were analyzed using computer vision to quantify mechanical parameters per cell, and a logistic model was trained to discriminate patients who had sepsis from those who did not. Results: We found substantial biophysical differences between cells from septic and non-septic patients as observed at both the single cell level (Fig. 1) and when looking at the overall leukocyte populations (Fig. 2) . A multiparameter classification algorithm to discriminate septic from non-septic patients based on biophysical markers currently yields a sensitivity of 88% with a negative predictive value of 95%. Conclusions: In patients presenting to the ED with 2 of 4 SIRS criteria and evidence of organ dysfunction, the CytoVale system provides a potentially viable means for the early diagnosis of sepsis via the quantification of biophysical properties of leukocytes.",

Any measures that may have an impact on the reduction of CLABSI are important in reducing morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. Therefore we present a retrospective study comparing the fixation site (neck vs. thorax) of the catheters implanted in the jugular vein, guided by ultrasonography and evaluating its impact on the incidence of CLABSI. The purpose of our study was to identify if there is any positive impact on the reduction of CLABSI when the catheter is fixated on the thorax. Methods: A retrospective unicentric study comparing the infection rates between the year of 2012, when the traditional technique of catheter fixation on the neck was used, and 2015, when 100% of the catheters were fixated on the thoracic region. The criteria for CLABSI were defined by the Infection Commission of QuintaD`or Hospital and the data on CLABSI were provided by the same commission. During this period there were no changes in the team of our unit and the patient's profile was the same. No deep vein catheter impregnated with antibiotics were used in the patients included in the study. The comparison used Fisher\u0301s test as a tool. All the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with indication of the central venous catheter of short permanence in the internal jugular vein were included. Patients with the central venous catheter of short permanence in other topographies, patients with hemodialysis catheter or with PICC were excluded.",

In this period, 6 cases of CLABSI were detected. On the other hand, in the year of 2015, 127 internal jugular vein catheters were installed in the same unit, all of them, using the thorax as the point of fixation. Although the number of catheters installed this year was higher, there was no case of CLABSI. It appears that this position, provides a better fixation of the catheter, avoiding that the bandage gets uncovered.",

Introduction: The oral cavity of a patient who has been hospitalized presents a different flora from normal healthy people. After 48h hours of hospital stay, the flora presents a bigger number of microorganisms that can be responsible for secondary infections, like pneumonia, because of their growth and proliferation. The objective of our study was to assess the dental plaque index on patients on admission to an Intensive Care Unit, and reassess 7 days later, to evaluate the efficacy of oral hygiene. Methods: Prospective, descriptive and observational study in an Intensive Care Unit of the CHP. Demographic, admission motive, hospital length of stay, feeding protocol, respiratory support need and oral hygiene protocol data was collected. The Greene & Vermillion Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (IHO-S) was used as the assessment tool on the first 24h and on 7th day. Results: 74 patients were evaluated, 42 of which were excluded for not meeting the minimal dentition. 32 patients had a mean age of 60,53 \u00b1 14,44 years, 53,1% were males and most of medical and surgical scope (37,5% each). Mean hospital length of stay was 15,69 \u00b16,69 days. The majority of patients were sedated (75%), under ventilator support (81,3%) and with enteric nutritional support, under nasogastric tube feeding. Initial IHO-S score was 0,67\u00b10,45, rising to 1,04\u00b10,51 (p<0,05) 7 days later.",

Each patient was implanted using standard aseptic procedure according to local protocol and antibiotic (cefazolin) prophylaxis before the procedure. Pocket aspirate was taken after irrigating the wound with normal saline just before device placement. Results: We analyzed 251 patients (58.6% male, 41.4% female). The most often implanted device was a DDD pacemaker followed by a VVI pacemaker. Mean length of hospital stay was 12.02\u00b18.34 days. There were 54 (21.5%) positive cultures with overall 3 (1.19%) clinically apparent infections which required prolonged iv antibiotics, removal of device and reimplantation after infection resolution. In regard to microbiology, S. epidermidis (48.2%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (29.6%) were the most often finding which is in contrast to the cultures described in the literature. The only statistically significant risk factor for positive pocket culture was male sex and presence of a urinary catheter. Invasive vascular devices, previous intrahospital infection, and diabetes were not found to increase the likelihood of positive pocket culture. Conclusions: Positive pocket cultures after CIED implant are a frequent finding mostly due to contamination and colonisation. The risk factors for such a finding differ from the usual and expected clinical circumstances. Our results are consistent with those in the literature. It turns out that the most important preventive measure in CIED implantation is strict aseptic procedure. Introduction: Intensive care patients are in constant risk of contamination due to suppression of their immune system, use of invasive procedures and medical equipment and health associated infections (HAI). Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) is an antiseptic and disinfectant product. In medical research it has been found that daily CHG bathing is affective in reducing levels of skin and central line related infections (Climo, 2013) . It is also referred to in the recommendations of the ministry of health \"prevention of septicemia due to central lines\" (2011). Methods: Unit guide lines for patient Dry Bathing were written in May 2015 and thereafter began the implementation and instruction of nursing staff. Quality control was inspected by observation. There was a 15 phase questioner that included several categories such as: preparation of the CHG solution, staff protection actions, infusions and surgical wound dressings, bathing performance and documentation.",

Most research on serious infections and sepsis has focused on the hospital environment, while potentially most delay, and therefore possibly the best opportunity to improve treatment, lies in the prehospital setting. Methods: Patients were included in this prospective observational study during a 4 week period in 2017. All patients aged 18 years or older with a suspected or proven infection were included. Prehospital, ED and outcomes were registered. Results: In total, 2452 patients visited the ED during the study period, of whom 440 (17.9%) patients had a (suspected) infection. (Fig. 1 ) Median duration of symptoms before ED visit was 3 days (IQR 1-7 days), with 23.9% of patients using antibiotics before arrival in the ED. Most patients (83%) had been referred by a general practicioner (GP), while 41.1% of patients had visited their GP previously during the current disease episode. Twenty-two patients (5.0%) experienced an adverse outcome (ICU admission and/or 30-day all-cause mortality): these patients were less often referred by a general practicioner (GP) (59.1 vs. 84.2%, p=0.001) and were considered more urgent both by EMS and in the ED. Conclusions: The prehospital phase of patients with an infection provides a window of opportunity for improvement of care. Patients become ill 3 days before the ED visit and 41.1% already visited their GP previously during the current disease episode, while 23.9% is currently using antibiotics. Future research should focus on quality improvement programs in the prehospital setting, targeting patients and/or primary care professionals. Introduction: Worldwide, the prevalence of tetanus has decreased.-However, even if progress has been made in the combat to eradicate tetanus it may be a cause of admission to intensive care.The objectives of our study are to determine epidemiological,clinical and prognostic characteristics for severe tetanus in our unit. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in the medical intensive care unit of Ibn Rushd hospital in Casablanca in Morocco from 2010 to 2016.We studied the epidemiological,clinical and prognostic characteristics of the patients who were admitted for severe tetanus. Results: The incidence of severe tetanus was 2.04% affecting male in 100%.41.9% were aged between 31 and 40 years old. In 85.7% there were a integumentary portal of entry. Contractures were present in 69%of the cases. At intensive care unit admission, 21.4% of the patients were sedated. The anti-tetanus vaccination was never updated. According to the Dakar score 28.6% of the patients were listed Dakar 1, 54.8% Dakar 2 and 16.6% Dakar 3. For the Mollaret score, the crude form was found in 44.2%, the acute generalized form was found in 32.6% and the severe form in 20.9% of the cases.Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 83.3%. Diazepam and baclofen were used in 92.9%, phenobarbital in76.2% and propofol in 42.85%. A serotherapy was used for all the patients and a preliminary vaccination dose for 26.9%. All the patients received antibiotics, penicillin G 33.33% and metronidazole 76.2%. The mortality was 61.9%. The length of intensive care stay was significantly higher. The need for an intubation,its duration and the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction have significantly influenced the mortality. Conclusions: To improve the prognosis in these serious forms of tetanus,it is highly important to identify the warning signs and refer patients in intensive care for early and appropriate management in intensive care. Introduction: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are associated with increased mortality in the ICU. The aim of the study was to evaluate the epidemiology and resistance patterns during the period 2013 to 2017. Methods: Bacteria and fungi isolated from the blood of patients hospitalized in a mixed ICU during the study period were retrospectively analyzed. Sensitivity testing was performed with disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) and Microscan Walkaway 96 plus for minimal inhibitory concentrations. Results: During the study period 1198 patients were hospitalized in the ICU. BSIs were diagnosed in 284 cases (23.7%). The isolated microorganisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15%), other Enterobacteriaceae (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1%), enterococci (20%), staphylococci (8%) and Candida spp. (13%). Of the A. baumannii isolates, 97% were resistant to carbapenems, 9.6% to colistin, and 31% to tigecycline. Of the K. pneumoniae isolates 80% were resistant to carbapenems, 70% to colistin, and 4.5% to tigecycline. Of the P. aeruginosa species 44% were resistant to carbapenems and they were all susceptible to colistin. The rate of resistance to vancomycin was 56% for the E. faecium isolates, 5.5% for the E. faecalis, while the resistance to methicillin of the coagulase negative staphylococci was 90%. The most commonly isolate species of Candida was C. albicans.",

NS is often overlooked as a source of pyrexia of unknown origin, meningeal manifestations, sepsis and ventilator associated pneumonia in ICU patients. CT scanning and sinus puncture are used to confirm the inflammatory process and identify the pathogen behind it. Methods: A retrospective case study of 6.479 ICU patients for a period of 2012-2016 was performed. We have analysed data from the CT scans of paranasal sinuses and bacteriological findings of samples obtained from sinus puncture. Results: 644 (9.9%) patients were suspected of NS on the 5-7th day of stay in the ICU. The CT scan confirmed pathological changes in 464 patients (7.1%). Hemisinusitis was detected in 422 patients (90.9%) and pansinusitis in 41 patients (8.8%). There was also an isolated case of maxillary sinusitis in 1 patient (0.2%). The pathogenic culture was identified only in 297 (64%) samples, 34.6% of which revealed isolated bacteria and 65.4% a polymicrobial association. Gram positive bacteria were detected in 16.1% of cases and Gram negative in 49.5%. Most cases revealed multiple antibiotic resistance. Conclusions: 1. NS has proved to be largely caused by Gram negative bacteria and polymicrobial associations. The use of broad spectrum antibiotics in ICU may justify the presence of sterile cultures. 2.Early identification of risk patients in ICU as well as the use of screening CT scan may benefit timely diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients. 3 .Preventive considerations include: patient's bed head elevation, the use of oral gastric tube in sedated and coma patients on ventilation, nasotracheal intubation only if indicated, removal of nasogastric tube at night, proper hygiene.",

Moribund patients and those requiring extracorporeal life supports, with ongoing antibiotic therapy, known chronic colonization with multiresistant bacteria or known allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics were excluded. Either IV injection of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1g/200mg) or placebo was administered 3 times a day for 2 days. All pulmonary infections were recorded and blindly confirmed by an adjudication committee. Results: In intention to treat analysis, 196 patients were analyzed, (treatment group n=99; mean age 60.5\u00b114.4 years, sex ratio=4, SOFA score 8.7\u00b13.1). Global characteristics of cardiac arrest were similar (no flow= 3.5min vs 3.8min, low-flow= 21.8min vs 18.2min). 60 VAP were confirmed incl. 51 early VAP, 19 in treatment group vs 32 in placebo group (HR=0.546; IC 95%=[0.315; 0.946]) (Fig. 1) .

Introduction: Antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed drugs in ICU.In the era of antibiotic resistance it is difficult to choose antibiotics during septic episode.The choice antibiotics mainly depends on clinical diagnosis,culture sensitivity and local flora. Whether severity of illness really maters is not well known. To study antibiotic prescription pattern and whether the choice of antibiotic varies according to hemodynamic stability in patients admitted in ICU.To study of microbiological isolates and their variability according to hamodynamic stability in ICU patients. Methods: All ICU patients of more than 18 years age who received antibiotics and where cultures had been sent were included in the study.Patients discharged against medical advice and where treatment had been withdrawn were excluded in this study. This prospective observational study was conducted between July 2016 to March 2017.Patients were divided into stable and unstable group according to hemodynamic parameter and usage of antibiotics and microbiological isolated were correlated. ICU mortality and length of stay were correlated between hemodynamically stable and unstable group. Results: 786 sepsis episode were analysed. Mean age was 65 years, male predominant, and average APACHE IV score was 58(SD25). We had 444 patients in unstable group of which 71% patients got discharged and 86% of patients got discharged in stable group. Antibiotic combination therapy was used more in hemodynamically unstsble patients(p 0.3). BLBLI was used more in stable group. Drug resistance in microbiological isolates did not reveal any statistically significant difference among stable or unstable group. Conclusions: There is a tendency to administer combination antibiotics in sicker group of patients with hemodynamic instability. Prevalence of microbial flora did not show any statistical difference. outcome is worse in hemodynamically unstable patients.",

Our objective was to evaluate the clinical significance of CS in a mixed population of ICU patients. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of critically ill patients who had Candida species growth during their stay in any of six different ICUs of a tertiary-care center. Two intensivists classified patients as having Candida colonization or invasive candidiasis according to predefined criteria. CS was calculated for each patient on the day of Candida species growth as follows: 1 . See text for description point for parenteral nutrition + 1 point for surgery + 1 point for multifocal Candida colonization + 2 points for severe sepsis. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to assess CS ability to discriminate between invasive candidiasis and Candida colonization. Results: CS was 1.6\u00b10.9 in patients with Candida colonization (N=261) and 2.4\u00b10.9 in those with invasive candidiasis (N=120) (p<0.001). However, only 38.7% of invasive candidiasis cases had CS >= 3 (compared with 8.0% of Candida colonization cases; p<0.001). The ROC curve (Fig. 1) showed that CS had fair ability to discriminate between invasive candidiasis and Candida colonization (area under the curve 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.77; p<0.001). In patients with invasive candidiasis, CS was similar in hospital survivors and nonsurvivors (2.2\u00b10.9 and 2.5\u00b10.8, respectively; p=0.13). CS did not discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors (area under the ROC curve 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.75; p<0.15). Conclusions: CS was higher in patients with invasive candidiasis than those with Candida Colonization. However, its ability to discriminate between these patients was only fair. CS was not associated with hospital mortality.",

Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal used for prophylaxis and treatment of IC. Due to its renal elimination, dose adjustments are usually based on estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCL). However, the reliability of eCrCL in predicting fluconazole clearance has never been investigated in this population. The aim of this study was to conduct a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis in a cohort of LT patients who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in order to find out which covariates may influence fluconazole pharmacokinetics (PKs). Methods: This retrospective study included LT patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit of our University Hospital between December 2007 and May 2016, and who were treated with intravenous fluconazole in the first months after LT. TDM of fluconazole was performed with the intent of attaining the efficacy pharmacodynamic target (AUC24h/MIC > 55.2). The tested covariates were: age, gender, CKD-EPI eCrCL, time from LT, serum albumin and transaminases, SAPS II score. PopPK was carried out with Pmetrics software. Results: Nineteen patients (mean\u00b1SD age, weight and serum creatinine of 60\u00b18.4 years, 75\u00b116.8 kg, 1.0\u00b10.62 mg/dL, respectively) with a total of 89 fluconazole trough plasma concentrations were included in the popPK analysis. Mean\u00b1SD fluconazole distribution volume (Vd) and clearance (CL) were 27.02\u00b110.78 L and 0.55\u00b10.19 L/h. Age and time from LT were the only clinical covariates significantly correlated with fluconazole Vd and CL, respectively. Conversely, CKD-EPI eCLCr was unable to predict fluconazole CL. Conclusions: CKD-EPI eCLCr is unreliable in predicting fluconazole exposure in LT recipients. Consistently, in this population adaptation of fluconazole dose should be based on measured CrCL, and TDM may be helpful in optimizing drug exposure.",

Methods: Retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data conducted in the ICU of a tertiary care hospital in India between July2016 to March2017. All consecutive infection episodes treated with empiric antibiotic therapy and with subsequent positive culture for Gram-negative bacteria were included. Primary and secondary outcomes were all cause ICU mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS). Outcomes were compared between infection episodes treated with single vs.combination antibiotic therapy. Results: Of total 214 episodes of gram-negative infections 66.4% received combination-antibiotic therapy. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between single vs. combination therapy groups were similar (mean age: p=0.07; sex: p=0.3; mean APACHE IV score: p=0.07). Overall ICU mortality did not significantly differ between single and combination antibiotic groups (30.2% vs. 27%; p=0.7). In single antibiotic group, ICU mortality was significantly higher for antibiotic-resistant compared to antibiotic-sensitive bacteria (77.8% vs. 18.5%, p=0.0002). In combination group, significantly lower ICU mortality was noted if bacteria was sensitive to even one antibiotic compared to pan-resistant bacteria (21.4% vs. 63.6%, p=0.0001). ICU LOS was similar between antibiotic-sensitive bacteria and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, both in single and combination therapy groups (single, antibiotic-sensitive vs. antibiotic-resistant: mean LOS\u00b1SD 14.6\u00b112.7 vs.12.8\u00b111days; p=0.6; combination, antibioticsensitive vs. antibiotic-resistant: 15.5\u00b113.3 vs.11.2 days; p=0.1). Conclusions: Irrespective of the number of antibiotics prescribed as empiric therapy, outcome of patients solely depends on the sensitivity pattern of the bacteria isolated.",

In critically ill patients undergoing continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH), however, its use is limited because of lacking pharmacokinetic data. Methods: Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were determined after standard doses in patients on CVVH and in critically ill patients with approximately normal renal function. Quantification of TMP and SMT was done by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV detection after pre-purification by solid phase extraction. The total clearance (CLtot) was estimated from arterial plasma levels and the haemofilter clearance (CLHF) from plasma and ultrafiltrate concentrations. Results: Six patients on CVVH (3 after the first dose, 3 at steady state) and nine patients off CVVH have been enrolled (4 after first dose, 7 at steady state). After a single dose, CLtot of SMT was 3.5 (1.8-3.8, median [range]) and 1.7 (1.1-2.7) L/h on and off CVVH, respectively. At steady state, we observed a CLtot of 1.0 (0.5-1.0) and 0.3 (0.2-0.9) L/h, respectively, on and off CVVH. Steady state trough levels (Cmin) of SMT amounted to 52-113 mg/L in patients on CVVH and 18-145 in patients off CVVH. CLtot of TMP was 4.4 (2.5-5. 3) L/h on CVVH and 5.4 (3.2-9.9) L/h off CVVH after the first dose. At steady state, its CLtot amounted to 0.8 (0.4-0.8) and 1.0 (0.6-1.9) L/h on and off CVVH, respectively. Cmin was 4-12 mg/L on CVVH and 3-9 mg/L in patients off CVVH. CLHF accounted for 22-68% of CLtot of SMT and 28-72% of CLtot TMP. Conclusions: Exposure to both antimicrobial agents is highly variable, but comparable in patients on and off CVVH. As considerable amounts of SMT and TMP are eliminated by CVVH, no excessive accumulation appears to take place during treatment with standard doses.",

Widespread use of colistin in agriculture and humans has seen the emergence of Mcr-1 mediated resistance amongst South African patients [1] . We sought to describe the trends of colistin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) over two years using data collected by SMART. Methods: SMART monitors the in vitro susceptibility of clinical aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacterial isolates to selected antimicrobials of importance, enabling longitudinal analyses to determine changes over time. The dataset comprised bacterial isolates from four different South African private pathology laboratories and one public sector pathology laboratory from 2015 -2016. The methods used in the study have been described elsewhere [2] . Isolate proportions between years were compared using the chisquared test with Yates' continuity correction. (2) (3) (4) (5) days]; 4 patients underwent renal replacement therapy. The median treatment duration (IQR) was 14 (13-14) days. In 41.6% of cases, antibiotic-therapy therapy combination (phosphomycin and colistin) was chosen. All the patients experienced a clinical response by 72/96 hours from the ceftazidime/avibactam commencing. In 8/ 9 bacteraemic patients negativization of blood culture occurred by 96 hours as well as of the rectal swab in 5/14 patients. A (B) recurred and a second treatment was given. 11/14 (78.5%) patients survived, whereas death was caused by multi-organ failure. The susceptibility test of strains showed sensitivity to ceftazidime/avibactam, whereas 100% of resistance to carbapenems, quinolones and III/IV generation cephalosporin, tigecycline and piperacillin/tazobactam; 62.5% of susceptibility to fosfomycin and colistin; (v) less than 50% of suceptibility to aminoglicosides. Conclusions: The 14 strains of KP-cp were susceptible to ceftazidimeavibactam despite the high carbapenem-resistance recorded in our ICU, because od rare identification of KP-cp VIM/NDL +. The preliminary data seems to confirm the efficacy and clinical utility of this antibiotic for the critically ill patients. Introduction: Multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) are an increasing problem on intensive care units. Lung infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are frequently difficult to treat. Phages have regained attention as treatment option for bacterial infections due to their specificity and effectivity in lysis. The aim of this preclinical study was to determine efficacy and safety of a novel phage preparation in mice. Methods: Mice were transnasally infected with a MDR A. baumannii strain [1] and 12 hours later treated intratracheally with a specific phage or solvent. Phage Acibel004 [2] was produced as suspension including efficient depletion of endotoxins. At defined time points, clinical parameters, bacterial burden in lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and cell influx were determined. Further, lung permeability and cytokine release were quantified and histopathological examination was performed. Results: Mice treated with phages recovered faster from infectionassociated hypothermia. 48 hours after infection, phage treatment led to a reduction in bacterial loads in lungs and BALF. In addition, lung permeability and cytokine production were reduced in phagetreated mice. Histopathological examination of the lungs showed less spreading of bacteria to the periphery in phage-treated mice, whereas cellular recruitment into the lung was unaffected. No adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: For the first time a highly purified phage against A. baumannii was successfully used in vivo. The current preclinical data support the concept of a phage-based therapy against pulmonary A. baumannii infections.",

            "text": "Introduction: VAP is common in critically ill patients and associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially when caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. Recently, phage therapy has emerged as a promising non-antibiotic based treatment of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. However, proof-of-concept experimental and clinical studies are missing before its wider use in clinical medicine. The goal of this experimental study was to compare the efficacy of phage therapy versus antibiotics for the treatment of MRSA in a rat model of VAP. Methods: Four hours after intubation and protective ventilation, rats were inoculated via the endotracheal tube with 6-9 x 10 9 CFU (LD100) of the MRSA clinical isolate AW7. The animals were subsequently extubated. Two hours after bacterial challenge, rats were randomised to receive intravenously either teicoplanin (n= 8), a cocktail of 4 lytic anti-S. aureus bacteriophages (n=9) or combination of both (n=6). 5 animals served as control (no treatment). Survival by 96 hours was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were bacterial count in lungs, spleen and blood. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were done and multiple comparisons of survival rates performed using the Holm-Sidak method. Results: Treatment with either phages, antibiotics or combination of both significantly increased survival (66%, 50%, 50% respectively, compared to 0% survival for controls, p<0.05). There were no statistical differences in survival rates between either forms of treatment ( Fig. 1) . Treatments hinder the systemic extension of the infection into the blood and spleen without impacting bacterial counts within the lungs, but the numbers are too small to perform statistical tests (Table 1) Introduction: The aim of the study was comparative evaluation of the clinical and microbiological efficacy of combination of amikacin thru nebuliser Aeroneb Pro and standard antimicrobal therapy (AMTcomb) with standard antimicrobal therapy (AMTst) in treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) caused by multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria. Methods: In prospective two-center study with retrospective control included patients with VAP and VAT. In AMTst group (retrospective, n=25) we used combination of meropenem 1 g every 8h iv as continuous infusion, cefoperazon/sulbactam 4 g every 12 h iv as continuous infusion and amikacin 1 g iv every 24 h. In AMTcomb group (prospective, n=25) we used combination of AMTst and amikacin inhalation 500 mg every 12 h thru nebuliser Aeroneb Pro. Results: In AMTcomb clinical cure rate was 84%, while in AMTst 29.2% (p<0.001), Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) on day 7 was 6 (4-7) points in AMTst and 2 (0-4) points in AMTcomb (p<0.001). Recurrence of VAP/VAT was 29.2% in AMTst and 12.5% in AMTcomb (p=0.008). On day 7 infectious agent titer in tracheal aspirate was 10 7 (10 3 -10 8 ) CFU/ml in AMTst group, while 10 3 (no growth-10 6 ) CFU/ml in AMTcomb (p=0.016). Microbiological eradication observed in 13 patients in AMTcomb vs in 1 patient in AMTst and microbiological persistance observed in 6 patients in AMTcomb vs 17 patients in AMTst (p=0.002). In AMTcomb on 3rd day sputum was less purulent (p=0.016). Amikacin nebulisation didn't led to deterioration of organ dysfunction: on day 7 there was no difference in platelet count, creatinine and bilirubin levels as compared to day 0 (p=0.102; p=0.297, p=0.532, respectively). Conclusions: Addition of amikacin inhalation 500 mg every 12 h thru Aeroneb Pro nebuliser in patients with VAP and VAT was more efficacious than intravenous standard antimicrobal treatment with comparable safety profile. Introduction: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of inhaled colistin (IC) as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics in the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Methods: 110 ICU patients with VAP were enrolled in this observational study. Resolution of VAP was assessed as primary endpoint; eradication of pathogens in sputum, weaning time, duration of ICU stay and mortality were assessed as secondary outcomes. Patients were split into 2 groups: Gr.1 (n = 60) -addition of IC to systemic antibiotics without changing the basic regimen; Gr. 2 (n = 50) -change in systemic antibiotics according to sensitivity. Groups were comparable. IC was administered in a dose of 2 million IU TID (Xselia Pharmaceuticals ApS, Denmark). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 7.0 (M, \u03c3, Newman-Keuls test; p <0.05). Results: VAP resolution rate was 77% in Gr.1 (vs. 50% in Gr. 2, p = 0.0295); eradication of pathogens from sputum by the 7th day. treatment was achieved in 80% of Gr. 1 and 60% in the Gr. 2 (n = 12) (p> 0.05); in Gr. 1 weaning from ventilation was possible earlier than in Gr. 2 -7.8\u00b11.3 days. in Gr. 1 vs. 10.9\u00b14.5 days. in Gr. 2 (p = 0.0000); in Gr. 1 duration of ICU stay was shorter than in Gr. 2 -11.5\u00b13.2 days vs. 17.1\u00b12.3 days. in Gr. 2 (p = 0.0000). No mortality differences were detected. Conclusions: Administration of inhaled colistin 2 million IU TID is effective as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics in the treatment of VAP. This modified treatment promotes a more rapid resolution of VAP, earlier weaning from ventilator, reduction of the duration of ICU stay, with no impact on mortality. The addition of IC to systemic antibiotics should be considered as second-line regimen in VAP patients.",

            "text": "Factors associated with no de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial therapy in ICU settings with high rate of multi-drug resistant bacteria C Routsi 1 Introduction: De-escalation is recommended in the management of antimicrobial therapy in ICU patients [1] . However, this strategy has not been adequately evaluated in the presence of increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with no de-escalation in ICUs with high rate of MDR bacteria [2] . Methods: Prospective, multicenter study conducted in 12 Greek ICUs over a 1-year period. Patients with laboratory confirmed infections were included. SOFA score on admission, on septic episode and thereafter every 24 h over 14 days, infection site(s), culture results, antimicrobial therapy, and mortality were recorded. Only the first septic episode was analyzed. In order to assess the factors associated with no de-escalation, a multivariate analysis was performed. Results: A total of 211 patients (admission SOFA score 10\u00b13) were analyzed. 43% of those had septic episode on ICU admission; 57% patients had an ICU-acquired. De-escalation was applied to 44 (21%) patients whereas it was not feasible in 75 patients (44 %) due to the recovery of MDR pathogens or it was not applied, although the microbiology results allowed it, in 92 patients (56 %). Septic shock on the day of septic episode was present in 67% and 79% of patients with and without de-escalation, respectively, p=0.072). Compared to no de-escalation, de-escalation strategy was associated with a shorter duration of shock (4 \u00b15 vs. 9\u00b17 days, p<0.001) and all-cause mortality (15.4% vs. 46.4%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables associated with no de-escalation were: a deteriorating clinical course as indicated by an increasing SOFA score (OR 14.7, p<0.001) and a lack of de-escalation possibility due to recovery of MDR pathogens (OR 27.3, p=0.008). Conclusions: Deteriorating clinical course and MDR pathogens are independently associated with no de-escalation strategy in critically ill patients. Conclusions: The qSOFA scale in the prognosis of sepsis does not differ significantly from the SIRS criteria, but in the prognosis of mortality is significantly better than SIRS. qSOFA significantly worse in the prognosis of sepsis and death than the SOFA scale. The international task force of Sepsis-3 introduced the quick Sequential Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score to supersede the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score as the screen tool for sepsis. The objective of this study is to prospectively access the diagnostic value of qSOFA and SIRS among patients with infection in general wards. Methods: A prospective cohort study conducted in ten general wards of a tertiary teaching hospital. For a half-year period, consecutive patients who were admitted with infection or developed infection during hospital stay were included. Demographic data and all variables for qSOFA, SIRS and SOFA scores were collected. We recorded daily qSOFA, SIRS and SOFA scores until hospital discharge, death, or day 28, whichever occurred earlier. The primary outcome was sepsis at 28 days. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and sensitivities or specificities with a conventional cutoff value of 2. Results: Of 409 patients (median age, 55 years [IQR, 40-67]; male, 225[55%]; most common diagnosis pneumonia, 234[57%]) who were identified with infection in general wards, 229(56%) developed sepsis at a median of 0 (IQR, 0-1) day, 146 patients (36%) and 371 patients (91%) met qSOFA and SIRS criteria at a median of 1 (IQR, 0-5) and 0 (IQR, 0-0) day, respectively. The qSOFA performed better than SIRS in diagnosing sepsis, with an AUROC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.71-0.79) vs 0.69(95% CI, 0.64-0.74). With a conventional cutoff value of 2, qSOFA had lower sensitivity (53% [95% CI, 47%-60%] vs. 98% [95% CI, 95%-99%], p < 0.001) and higher specificity (87% [95% CI, 81%-91%] vs. 18% [95% CI, 13%-23%], p < 0.001) than SIRS (Table 1) . Conclusions: Among patients with infection in general wards, the use of qSOFA resulted in greater diagnostic accuracy for sepsis than SIRS during hospitalization. qSOFA and SIRS scores can predict the occurrence of sepsis with high specificity and high sensitivity, respectively.",

The hypothesis was that this tool had a good prediction performance. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing qSOFA as prediction tool for mortality found on PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, SCOPUS and EBSCO database from inception until November 2017. The primary outcomes were mortality (ICU mortality, inhospital mortality, 30 and 90-day mortality). Studies reporting sensitivity and specificity of the qSOFA making it possible to create a 2x2 table were included. The diagnostic odds ratio (LnDOR) was summarized following the approach of DerSimonian and Laird using the software R ('mada' package). The summary ROC curve was created using the Reistma model (bivariate model). The RevMan 5 software was used to organize the data. Results: The search strategy yielded 266 citations. Of 134 unique citations, 48 met the inclusion criteria (426,618 patients). The sensitivity and specificity from each study are shown in Fig. 1 . The meta-analysis of the DOR was 4.838 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.808 -6.146) and of the LnDOR was 1.576 (95% IC: 1.337 -1.816) (Fig. 2) . The pooled area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.717. The summary estimative of the sensitivity was 0.55 and the false positive rate was 0.209, by bivariate diagnostic random-effects metaanalysis. The Chi-square goodness of fit test rejects the assumption of homogeneity, and the fit of the model for heterogeneity was better (p-value = 0.3661). Conclusions: The qSOFA has a poor performance to predict mortality in patients admitted to the ED or ICU. Introduction: Sepsis and septic shock patients are the most common cause of death in intensive care units. [1] The aim of this study is to quantify the relationship between 72 hours sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores change and in-hospital mortality as a treatment outcome in sepsis and septic shock patients. Introduction: An Outreach Team, akin to a Rapid Response Team, is made up of healthcare professionals assembled together for quick and effective reviews in managing of rapidly deteriorating or gravely deteriorated patients [1] . This study aimed to look at the variety of patient referrals in terms of their severity, patient dynamics, reasons for referral and their subsequent dispositions. Methods: 258 patient records were randomly reviewed retrospectively from July to October 2017. Data were collated in an excel spreadsheet for comparison and then sorted in accordance with the clinical questions and percentages calculated. Results: From the 258 referrals, the severity criteria was done by calculating the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). It was found that 51% patients had a score of 0-4, 23% had a score of 5-6, and 26% scored more or equal to 7. 50% of patients were in the age range 61-70 years old. 78% referrals came from the Emergency Department (ED) where a consultant was involved in the decision of the referral; of this, 46% were referred during office hours of 8AM to 5PM where there was greater manpower to aid management. 19% referrals came from inpatients on the General Wards; 32% were done during office hours. 65% of referrals were transferred to IC/HD upon review; 35% were not, from whom 9 died and 7 were later admitted after procedures (2%) or because they deteriorated further (1%). For reasons for referrals and disposition decisions, see Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "Conclusions: Despite having no set criteria for Outreach Team referrals, the accuracy rate was nearly 65% admissions to IC/HD based on clinician concerns. There was only 1% re-admission rate having been re-reviewed when the patients had not been deemed suitable for IC/HD admission initially. Therefore referrals were done accurately and safely with the protocol of clinician referral openness directly to IC consultants. Introduction: Prompt recognition of patient deterioration allows early initiation of medical intervention with reduction in morbidity and mortality. This digital era provides an opportunity to harness the power of machine learning algorithms to process and analyze big data, automatically acquired from the electronic medical records. The results can be implemented in real-time. Intensix (Netanya, Israel) has developed a novel predictive model that detects early signs of patient deterioration and alerts physicians. In this study we prospectively validated the ability of the model to detect patient deterioration in real time. Methods: The model was developed and validated using a retrospective cohort of 9246 consecutive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in the Tel-Aviv Sourasky medical centera tertiary care facility in Israel, between January 2007 and December 2015. In this study, we tested model performance in real time, on a cohort of 333 patients admitted to the same ICU between June 2016 and August 2017. Significant events that lead to major interventions (e.g. intubation, initiation of treatment for sepsis or shock, etc.) were tagged upon medical case review by a senior intensivist, blinded to model alerts. These tags were then compared with model alerts. [3] [4] [5] [6] . 1240 reviews occurred despite 'low NEWS' (Fig. 1) . RRT review led to CC admission in 315 (31.2%) cases; median [IQR] NEWS 5 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Probability of admission increased with higher NEWS (Fig. 1 ), however 82 admissions had 'low NEWS'. Of these 51 were excluded due to high NEWS trigger in the preceding 24hrs or post-operative status. The remaining 31 (9.8%) represented genuine low NEWS cases; age 54 [36-64], 50% male, admission APACHE II 12 [8-17] and day 1 SOFA 2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Admission source was emergency department 29%, medical 42%, surgical 29%. Diagnoses are shown in Table 1 . No low NEWS patients with sepsis were qSOFA positive. CC length of stay was 2 [1] [2] [3] [4] days and ICU mortality was 9.6%. Conclusions: A high proportion of RRT activity occurs at low levels of abnormal physiology. Despite an association between NEWS and CC admission, NEWS fails to trigger for approximately one in ten admitted cases. Clinical concern remains an important component of the escalation of acutely ill patients. Meanwhile, novel markers of deterioration should be sought and validated. Introduction: Although rapid response systems are known to reduce in-hospital cardiac arrest rate, their effect on mortality remains debated. The Rapid Response Call (RRC) is a system designed to escalate care to a specialised team in response to the detection of patient deterioration. There are diurnal variations in hospital staffing levels that can influence the performance of rapid response systems and patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the time of RRC activations and patient outcome. Methods: Review of retrospectively collected, linked clinical and administrative datasets, at a private hospital during a 34-month period. All patients with medical emergency team activation were included. Rapid response calls occurring between 18:00-07:59 were defined as 'out of hours'. Results: Between January 2015 and October 2017 there were 209 RRC. The trigger for RRCs activation was nurse concern (101; 38.3%), modified early warning score (80; 28.3%) and cardiac arrest (28; 13.4%). 44 RRCs were \"out of hours\" being the main activation trigger a modified warning score > 5. \"Out of hours\" patients had higher ICU admissions (31.7% versus 20%) and were more likely to have an inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest (OR=1.4, p<0.002). Conclusions: The diurnal timing of RRCs appears to have significant implications for patient outcomes. Out of hours calls are associated to a poorer outcome. This finding has implications for staffing and resource allocation. and septic shock) and severe sepsis (incl. septic shock) using ICD-10 codes coded as primary and secondary discharge diagnoses and procedural OPS codes. We assessed incidences and discharge disposition incl. mortality. Results: Incidences, mortalities and discharge disposition comparing 2010 and 2015 and the mean annual increase in incidence rates are reported in Tables 1 and 2 .",

            "text": "Conclusions: The annual increase in standardized sepsis incidence rates is greater than in infections, but similar to the increase in infectious disease patients with organ dysfunction, which are less prone to coding incentives than sepsis codes. An increasing number of patients is discharged to nursing homes and hospice. Given the alarming increase in sepsis cases and deaths, this analysis confirms sepsis as a key priority for health care systems. Introduction: Patients with urgent admissions to the hospital on weekends may be subjected to a higher risk of worse outcomes, which may be due to differences in compliance to established processes. Because delays to antibiotic administration is an important measure of sepsis protocol efficiency and has been associated to worse outcomes, we aimed to assess the association of the weekend effect (admissions on weekend) with timing to antibiotic administration. Methods: Patients included in the sepsis protocol in the emergency department (ED) of Hospital Sao Rafael, from January 2016 to July 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. Sepsis protocol is supposed to be activated to every patient with a suspected sepsis diagnosis in the ED. We evaluated the association of weekend (saturday or sunday) admission with timing to antibiotic administration. Introduction: Current sepsis guidelines emphasize resuscitation of hypotension to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mmHg [1] . A MAP less than 90 mmHg appears to be associated with poor outcomes in postoperative patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) [2] . However, extent of hypotension in critically ill septic patients during ICU stay and its relationship with adverse outcomes is poorly defined. We determined the magnitude of hypotension in ICU patients with a diagnosis of sepsis and its association with major complications. Conclusions: Reduced mortality may be supposed to be correlated to a quicker recovery of organ damage sepsis related. PCRTs should be warranted in the future to corroborate these preliminary data.",

Attenuating this cytokine storm early by eliminating cytokines may have some pathophysiological rationale. Our aim was to investigate the effects of extracorporeal cytokine removal (CytoSorb) therapy on organ dysfunction and inflammatory response within the first 48 hours from the onset of septic shock. Methods: Patients with: sepsis of medical origin, on mechanical ventilation, noradrenaline >10mg/min, procalcitonin >3ng/mL and no need for renal replacement therapy, were randomized into CytoSorb and Control groups. CytoSorb therapy lasted for 24 hours. In addition to detailed clinical data collection, blood samples were taken to determine IL-1, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, PCT, CRP levels. Introduction: Blind pericardiocentesis leading to low success rate and high complication rates such as ventricular wall or oesophageal perforations, pneumothorax or upper abdominal organ injury.Real time needle visualisation is allowing us to avoid this major complication [1] . Methods: We presented 2 cases of acute traumatic cardiac tamponade secondary to severe chest injury. Both patients presented with haemodynamic instability and echocardiographic features of pericardial tamponade. Pericardiocentesis under ultrasound guidance at left parasternal area with needle directed from medial to lateral technique were performed (Fig. 1) . Real time needle tip visualisation done throughout the procedure (Fig. 2a) . Needle placement in pericardial space was confirmed with agitated saline and guidewire visualisation (Fig. 2b) . Pigtail catheter was inserted and blood was aspirated until the patient were haemodynamically improved. Repeated ultrasound was done to confirm the absence of ultrasonographic features of tamponade and complications. Results: We demonstrated a successful real time needle visualisation ultrasound guided pericardiocentesis in 2 cases acute traumatic pericardial tamponade. Procedural time (time from needle piercing the skin to time needle entering the pericardium) in both cases were less than 1 minute. Post procedural ultrasound confirmed no major complications. Conclusions: The real time needle visualisation using ultrasound was important to reduce major complications during pericardiocentesis. The safety of the highly invasive procedure can be improved with real time needle visualisation.",

There sublingual microcirculation was examined by a novel incident dark-field imaging (IDF) before and daily post-LVAD implantation. Pre-LVAD microcirculation was typical for heart failure, characterized by slowly, sludging movement of red blood cells (RBCs), (Fig. 1A arrows) . Directly after implantation, a normal microcirculatory flow was seen with a high RBCs velocity (Fig. 1B) . On the day of tamponade the patients were stable except for severe failure of microcirculation as reflected by drop in MFI (Fig. 1C ) and congestion in venules (* in Fig. 1C ). In 8 out of 11 patients there was a significant drop in MFI before tamponade was clinically recognized (p<0.05). Shortly after rethoracotomy a quick restoration of microcirculatory flow has been found.

The most accepted target was an adequate cardiac output (N=369, 45%). The combination of noradrenaline and dobutamine was preferred to single treatment with adrenaline mainly due to possibility to titrate individually (N=366, 44%). The main reason for adding another inotrope was to use synergistic effects of two different mechanisms of action (N=229, 27%). According to respondents, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors should be used in the treatment of predominant right heart failure because of prominent vasodilatory effect on the pulmonary circulation (N=360, 44%). They also believe levosimendan is the only inotrope that does not increase myocardial oxygen demand (N=350, 42%). Vasodilators are used in cardiogenic shock to decrease left ventricular afterload (N=244, 30%). There is no experience or no opinion about the use of \u00df-blockers in shock states (N=268, 32%).",

Introduction: Recent literature data clearly indicated that in patients with shock the resuscitation of macro-circulation often does not match with microcirculation and tissue perfusion improvement. Unfortunately, the bed-side assessment of regional perfusion remains difficult, particulary in critically ill patients. In the last years thermography has been used in different medical fields but no studies have been performed on the use of this technique in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether thermography is feasible and may provide useful data during resuscitation of patients with septic shock. Methods: In 4 patients with septic shock we collected central systemic temperature and infrared images (FLIR-T640 digital camera) of limbs at 0, 3, 6 and 24 hours after shock occurrence. Thermal pattern distribution of the limbs was obtained by a specific analysis of the images (ThermaCAM\u2122Researcher P). A systemic to peripheral temperature gradient called \"\u0394 systemic-limb temperature\" was calculated for each single temperature data collected.",

Methods: Individual patient data were analyzed at baseline and at 48h for regional differences in demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns, and grouped according to four geographical areas: the United States (US), Canada (CA), Europe (EU) and Australasia (AU). P-values were calculated by Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous data and chi-square tests for categorical data. Subsequent temporal analysis compared changes in the treatment of shock, indexed by changes in patient acuity level. Results: Regional differences existed with respect to BMI (p=0.0076), albumin (p<0.0001), CVP (p=0.0383), MELD score (p=0.0191), APACHE II score (p=0.0007) and SOFA score (p=0.0076).

            "text": "Renal outcomes of vasopressin and its analogues in distributive shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials Introduction: Venous return (VR) is driven by the difference between mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) and determines the maximum ECMO flow. MSFP depends on stressed volume and vascular compliance. It can be modified by absolute blood volume changes and shifts between stressed and unstressed volume. Norepinephrine (NE) may increase stressed volume by constriction of venous capacitance and at the same time increase the resistance to systemic flow. We therefore studied the effects of NE on MSFP, maximum ECMO flow and the ECMO pressure head (MAP-RAP). Methods: MSFP was measured with blood volume at Euvolemia and NE 1 to 3 (0.05, 0.125 and 0.2\u03bcg/kg/h) in a closed-chest porcine VA-ECMO model (n=9, central cannulation with left atrial vent and avshunt) in ventricular fibrillation. The responses of RAP and VR (measured as ECMO flow, QECMO) were studied at variable pump speeds including maximum possible speed without clinically apparent vessel collapse at constant airway pressure. Results: The ECMO pump speed and QECMO showed a strictly linear relationship (r 2 0.95 to 0.995, range over all conditions) despite increased pressure head, indicating that the maximum QECMO was determined by VR alone. NE led to both increases in MSFP and QECMO in a dose dependent way, indicating a rightward shift in the VR plot ( Fig. 1 ) via recruitment of stressed from unstressed volume ( Table 1 , Fig. 2 ). This resulted in an increased MSFP during NE despite decreased absolute blood volume (3.9\u00b10.4 L vs. 3.3\u00b10.3L, p=0.009). The reduced blood volume was associated with hemoconcentration suggesting plasma leakage. Conclusions: NE shifts the VR curve to the right, allowing a higher maximum ECMO flow. The NE induced increase in MSFP results from recruitment of unstressed volume to stressed volume, which may be modified by changes in vascular compliance. The effects on pump afterload were not limiting. Introduction: To locate vessels for percutaneous central venous catheterizations, it may be helpful to apply not only real-time ultrasound (US) guidance but also US-assistance vein prelocation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the superiority of two US methods compared to surface landmark methods by reviewing randomized control trials (RCTs). Methods: As updating an earlier systematic review [1] , we searched PubMed and CENTRAL in November 2017. We included RCTs which compared the failure rates of internal jugular or femoral venous cannulations among 1) real-time US guidance, 2) US-assistance vein prelocation and 3) surface landmark methods. A frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted using the netmeta package on R.",

Introduction: We present a case report of 'Shoshin beriberi' in a young female who was 'fussy with food' that developed an acutely progressive metabolic acidosis and multi-organ failure requiring intensive care support. Methods: Our patient was a 36-year-old British woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a ten-day history of diarrhea, vomiting and increasing fatigue. She had a past medical history of gastroparesis, polycystic ovary syndrome (on metformin), laparoscopic cholecystectomy and hysteropexy. She lived with her husband and two children who had viral gastroenteritis two weeks previously. Results: The patient had a metabolic acidosis (pH 6.9) with raised lactate (>16) on initial blood gas in the ED. A 1.26% sodium bicarbonate infusion and hemofiltration were commenced overnight. The patient's pH and lactate remained static with an increasing work of breathing over this period. By morning she developed flash pulmonary oedema and hypotension, the first signs of acute cardiac failure. An echocardiogram displayed severely impaired left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 17%. The patient was intubated and inotropic support was commenced. It was thought that a micronutrient deficiency may have caused a rapid onset cardiac failure. Pabrinex (containing 250ml of Thiamine Hydrochloride) was commenced and within 9 hours the patient's metabolic acidosis markedly improved ( Fig. 1 ). Complete reversal of the cardiac failure occurred over 96 hours.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Shoshin is a rare clinical manifestation of thiamine deficiency [1] . It is an important differential diagnosis to bear in mind after excluding more common aetiologies of heart failure. Especially in this case as our patient had no obvious risk factors at the time of presentation. We suggest empiric use of thiamine should be considered in treatment algorithms for young patients presenting with acute cardiac failure. The pateint had provided informed consent for publication. Introduction: Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is known to be an acute transient cardiac condition accompanied with acute heart failure. TS is often triggered by critical illness but that has been rarely studied in ICU practice.Therefore, it is known, that the use of catecholamines can directly induce TS, worsen LVOT obstruction, and delay spontaneous recovery in TS patients, it is nearly impossible to avoid their administration in critically ill [1] . Methods: We have analyzed medical records from 23 patients with TS, that were revealed during year 2017 in our hospital. TS was defined due to Mayo criteria, including transient regional wall motion abnormalities, mildly elevated troponin level and no signs of obstructive CAD on coronary angiography. Results: Out of 23 patients who developed TS in ICU or ICCU, hemodynamic instability occurred in acute phase of TS in 12 (52%) cases. 9 (39%) of patients were admitted to ICU in due to septic shock (2 patients), major bleeding (1), cerebral mass lesion (1) and ARDS (2) and required treatment with catecholamines. General mortality rate in TS patients was 7 (30%), and 5 (55%) in critically ill TS patients. Mean duration of noradrenalin infusion was 7,2 days, dobutamine infusion 4,3 days. Patients with TS needed more ICU resources and longer ICU-stay. Mortality rate was higher in TS patients (55%) vs the ICU-population (28%), p = 0.02. Conclusions: TS seems to be an often cause of LV dysfunction and acute heart failure in critically ill. It seems that TS could be a predictor of worse prognosis in critically ill patients. Although catecholamine administration may worsen the patient prognosis and induce further AHF in critically ill patients it rearely can be avoided. Introduction: Previous studies on readmission following LVAD implantation have focused on hospital readmission after dismissal from the index hospitalization. Since there are very little data existing, the purpose of this study was to examine intensive care unit (ICU) readmission in patients during their initial hospitalization for LVAD implantation to determine reasons for, factors associated with, and mortality following ICU readmission. Methods: This was a retrospective, single center, cohort study in an academic tertiary referral center. All patients at our institution undergoing first time LVAD implantation from February 2007 to March 2015 were included. Patients dismissed from the ICU who then required ICU readmission prior to hospital dismissal were compared to those not requiring ICU readmission prior to hospital dismissal. Results: Among 266 LVAD patients, 45 (16.9%) required ICU readmission. The most common reasons for admission were bleeding and respiratory failure (Fig. 1) . Factors found to be significantly associated with ICU readmission were preoperative hemoglobin level of less than 10 g/dL, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate <35mL/min/1.73m2, preoperative atrial fibrillation, preoperative dialysis, longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, and higher intraoperative allogeneic blood transfusion requirements. Mortality at 1 year was 30.2% in patients requiring ICU readmission vs. 11.9% in those not requiring ICU readmission (age-adjusted OR=3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.6, p=0.005). Conclusions: ICU readmission following LVAD implantation occurred relatively frequently and was associated with significant one-year mortality. These data can be used to identify LVAD patients at risk for ICU readmission and implement practice changes to mitigate ICU readmission. Future larger and prospective studies are warranted.",

This combination is probably related to a poor prognosis compared to lone AF or infection, but existing data are scarce. Aim: to describe the prevalence and prognosis for AF and infection individually and concomitantly in an ED setting. Introduction: Its afterload reducing effects make PEEP the treatment of choice for cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Studies indicate that PEEP may lower coronary blood flow. Its effects on left ventricular contractility is unclear. Most of the surrogate measures for cardiac contractility are dependent on afterload and contractility assessment under PEEP may therefore be biased. We have investigated cardiac contractility under PEEP with the endsystolic pressure volume relationship (ESPVR) as a load-independent measure of contractility. Methods: 23 patients scheduled for coronary angiography were ventilated with CPAP and a full face mask at three levels of PEEP (0, 5 and 10 cmH2O) in random order. Structural cardiac pathologies were excluded with echocardiography. At every PEEP level, left ventricular pressure volume loops (Millar conductance catheter with INCA System, Leycom, Netherlands) were obtained. The endsystolic elastance was derived from a PV-loop family under preload reduction with an Amplatzer sizing balloon in the inferior caval vein. All participants gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Bernese ethics committee. Results: 5 women and 18 men with an age 59\u00b16 years were studied. Ejection fraction was 70\u00b18 % at baseline. Mean ESPVR at PEEP levels of 0, 5 and 10 were 2.64\u00b11.3, 2.56\u00b1 1.18 and 2.33\u00b10.88 mmHg/mL (p = 0.318, repeated measurements ANOVA). dP/dt and ejection fraction did not differ between the PEEP levels (p=0.138 and 0.48). Conclusions: Moderate levels of PEEP did not influence endsystolic elastance. Higher PEEP and patients in cardiogenic shock should be investigated. Introduction: We sought to assess the feasibility of 3D volumetric analysis with transthoracic echocardiography in critically ill patients. We choose a cohort typical of ICU where accurate volumetric analysis is important: hypoxic, mechanically ventilated patients. 3D analysis is enticing in simplicity and wealth of data available. It is accurate in cardiology patients [1] but has not been assessed in the ICU. Methods: Patients were imaged within 24 hours of admission. Inclusion criteria: adult, hypoxic (P:F <300), mechanically ventilated, Doppler stroke volume (SV) assessment possible. Echocardiography: Seimens SC2000 real-time volumetric analysis with standard B-mode and Doppler assessment. Images unacceptable if >2 segments unable to be seen in 2 volumetric planes. 3D Left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) analysis with Tomtec Imaging and Seimens Acuson respectively and compared to Doppler derived SV. 30% limit of agreement considered clinically acceptable [2] . Imaging was optimised for volumetric analysis (20-45 vols/sec). Results: 92 patients, 83 in sinus, 9 in AF. No significant difference seen between Doppler vs 2D Simpson's biplane, 3D LV or 3D RV SV estimation. Feasibility, SV values and bias are reported in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . Limit of agreement for corrected Doppler vs LV 3D SV = -48% to 55%; RV 3D SV = -62.7% to 84.3%. Conclusions: 3D LV and RV volumetric analysis is feasible in majority of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, however lacks agreement with Doppler derived stroke volume assessment. Although images may appear sufficient, the semi-automated software appears to underestimate stroke volume. Further larger studies using thermodilution are warranted. Introduction: Body position changes such as leg raising are used to determine fluid responsiveness. We hypothesized that the Trendelenburg position increases resistance to venous return. Together with abolishment of the hepatic vascular waterfall, this may limit the increase in regional blood flow. Methods: Inferior vena cava (IVC), portal vein (PV), hepatic, superior mesenteric (SMA) and carotid artery blood flows and arterial, right atrial (RA) and hepatic (HV) and portal venous blood pressures were measured in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs in supine and 30\u00b0Trendelenburg positions. All hemodynamic parameters were measured during end-expiration at 5 cmH2O PEEP, and at inspiratory hold with increasing airway pressures (AWP) of 15, 20, 25 and 30 cmH2O, respectively. Paired t test was used to compare pressures and flows in different positions during end-expiration. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to evaluate the effects of AWP on hemodynamic parameters. Results: Trendelenburg position significantly increased RA, HV and PV blood pressures at end-expiration, while Qpv and Qsma remained unchanged, Qha increased and Qivc showed a trend to decrease (Table  1 ). In both positions, all blood flows decreased with increasing AWP, and the difference between Ppv and Qsma became smaller, indicating splanchnic blood pooling ( Table 2 ). In the Trendelenburg position, splanchnic blood pooling was less severe compared to supine position. Conclusions: Trendelenburg position tended to decrease venous return from inferior vena cava. Further increases in RAP by augmenting AWP led to a decrease in all flows and signs of abolished hepatic vascular waterfall. Passive manoeuvers to assess fluid responsiveness evoke complex hemodynamic reactions which are not fully understood. Introduction: Despite of preventive measures, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in ICU patients is estimated to range from 5-31%. While clinical diagnostics is unreliable, ultrasound compression test (UCT) has proven to be a highly sensitive and specific modality for the recognition of lower extremity DVT [1] . Delegating this competence to ICU nurses can increase UCT availability and enable preventive DVT screening. Therefore, we decided to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of UCT performed by general ICU nurse in ICU patients compared to an investigation by ICU physician certified in ultrasound.",

Methods: A Cytosorb\u00ae (Cytosorbents, New Jersey, USA) HA device was inserted within the CPB circuit in ten patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. One hour after CPB onset, the activity of coagulation factors (Antithrombin (AT), von Willebrand Factor (vWF), factors II, V, VIII, IX, XI, and XII) were measured before and after the device. Pre and post device measurements were compared using student ttest, a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Patients' mean age was 60.6 \u00b1 21.4 years, 20% were female, the mean EuroSCORE II was 6.2 \u00b1 8.1. Procedures were: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (2/10), aortic root replacement (6/10) and CABG combined with aortic valve replacement (2/10). Mean CPB duration was 161.8 \u00b1 52.3 min. Pre and post HA measurements of coagulation factors activity are presented in Fig. 1 . Post-device AT and FII activity was significantly lower (respectively from 70.4 to 66.6, p=0.01 and from 61.5 to 57.1, p=0.03) compared to predevice measurement. There was no statistically significant difference between pre-and post-HA measurements for all other coagulation parameters Conclusions: Pre and post HA Cytosorb\u00ae measurements for coagulation factor activity were not different except for a small decrease in AT and FII activity. This might be related with intra-device consumption or adsorption. Further analyses accounting for CPB fluid balance, the entire study population and timepoints are pending. Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in hemodynamics and microvascular perfusion during extracorporeal blood purification with Cytosorb in patients with septic shock requiring renal replacement therapy. Methods: Eight adult patients with septic shock requiring continuous renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure were enrolled and underwent a 24-hour treatment with the emodasorption cartridge Cytosorb. Measurements were taken at baseline before starting Cytosorb, after 6h (t1) and 24h (t2) and included: blood gases, macrohemodynamic parameters (Picco2), vasopressor and inotropic dose, plasma levels of cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL6, IL8, IL10, tumor necrosis factor alpha) and parameters of microvascular density and perfusion (sublingual sidestream dark field videomicroscopy).

The aim of this study is 1-to confirm whether oxiris decreases cytokines and procalcitonin in sepsis septic shock.2-This effect is superior to RRT.3-This translates in a better cardio renal response. Methods: A coohort study and a propensity-matched analysis included 73 patients admitted to three Intensive Care (Aurelia Hospital, European Hospital, Tor Vergata -Rome) with a diagnosis of septic shock.50 patients were submitted to RRT with oxiris filter and 23 patients to RRT.Il 6, Procalcitonin, the cardiorenal indices and SOFA score were compared before (T0) and at the end of the treatments (T1). All data are expressed as mean\u00b1sd. ANOVA one way was used to compare the changes of the variables in the time. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 50 patients submitted to RRT with the oXiris filter 32 could be matched to 22 septic patients who received RRT. IL6 and Procalcitonin decreased in the Oxiris group (p< 0.01) but not in the RRT group.-MAP increased (p< 0.01) and noradrenaline dosage decreased in oxiris group (p< 0.01), but non in RRT group. Also PaO2/FIO2 ratio, diuresis, SOFA improved only in the in the oxiris group (p<0.05). Conclusions: In sepsis/septic shock patients with AKI, IL6 and procalcitonin decrease more in the oXirs group then in the RRT group.This is associated with an improvement of the cardio -renal function and the clinical condition.The study confirms that RRT with oXiris filter may be useful in sepsis/septic shock when other convective/diffusive techinques fail. Introduction: ADVOS (Hepa Wash GmbH, Munich, Germany) is a recently developed CE-certified albumin-based hemodialysis procedure for the treatment of critically ill patients. In addition to the removal of water-soluble and albumin-bound substances, acid-base imbalances can be corrected thanks to an automatically regulated dialysate pH ranging 7.2 to 9.5. Methods: Patients treated with the ADVOS procedure between in the Department of Intensive Care Medicine of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were retrospectively analyzed. Overall 102 treatments in 34 critically ill patients (Mean SOFA Score 16) were evaluated. Additionally, subgroup analysis for hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory acidosis and non-respiratory acidosis were conducted. Results: Severe hyperbilirubinemia (>6 mg/dl) was present in 60 treatments, while 26 and 14 treatments were performed to treat respiratory (PaCO2>45 mmHg) and non-respiratory (PaCO2<45 mmHg) acidosis (pH<7.35), respectively. Mean treatment duration was 16 h. ADVOS procedure was able to correct acidosis and reduce bilirubin, BUN and creatinine levels significantly. The subgroup analysis shows an average bilirubin reduction of 21% per ADVOS multi treatment in the hyperbilirubinemia group (15.24mg/dL vs 11.77mg/dL, p<0.05). Moreover, pH (7.23 vs. 7.35, p<0.001) and PaCO2 (65.88 vs. 53.61 mmHg, p<0.001) were corrected in the respiratory acidosis group, while in the non-respiratory acidosis group, an improvement in pH (7.19 vs. 7.37, p<0.001), HCO3 (15.21 vs. 20.48, p=0.002) and base excess (-12.69 vs. -5.10, p=0.004) could be observed. There were no treatment-related adverse events during therapy. Conclusions: ADVOS is a safe and effective hemodialysis procedure, which is able to remove water soluble and protein bound markers and correct severe acidosis in critically ill patients.",

Introduction: Liver transplant (LT) in patients with renal dysfunction presents intraoperative challenges and portends postoperative morbidity. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is increasingly used for intraoperative support; however, there is a paucity of data to support this practice. Methods: Pilot randomized open-label controlled trial in adults receiving cadaveric LT with a Modification of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score >=25 and preoperative acute kidney injury (KDIGO stage 1) and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients were randomized to intraoperative CRRT (iCRRT) or standard of care. Primary endpoints were feasibility and adverse events. Secondary endpoints were changes in intraoperative fluid balance, complications, and hospital mortality. Analysis was intention-to-treat. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled, 32 (53%) were randomized (17 to iCRRT; 15 to control). Mean (SD) was age 49 (13) years, MELD was 36 (8), 75% (n=24) had cirrhosis; 63% (n=20) received preoperative RRT; and 66% (n=21) were transplanted from ICU. One patient allocated to iCRRT did not receive LT. Seven (41%) allocated to control crossed over intraoperatively iCRRT ( (137) min, with only 3 interruptions (all due to access). iCRRT fluid removal was 2.8L (range 0-14.5). Fluid balance was 5.3L (2.9) for iCRRT vs. 4.3L (6.1) for control (p=0.57). Postoperative CRRT was similar (77% vs. 50%, p=0.25). There were no differences in reexploration (p=0.36), mechanical ventilation time (p=0.87), reintubation (p=0.18), sepsis (p=0.56), or mortality (p=0.16). Conclusions: In this pilot trial of high acuity LT patients, iCRRT was feasible and safe. These data will inform the design of a large trial to define the role of iCRRT during LT.",

Citrate anticoagulation has been used in the UK since 2008, but its uptake since then is unknown [1] . Methods: A survey questionnaire targeted pharmacists working in UK adult ICUs providing CRRT. Invitations to participate were distributed utilising the United Kingdom Clinical Pharmacy Association online forum as a platform for access. Survey administration was by self-completion and submissions were accessible over a total of six weeks. Basic demographic data, ICU specifications, the citrate system in use and implementation details were sought. A descriptive statistical analysis ensued. Results: 70 responses were received of which 67 were analysed after duplication removal. 45 trusts, encompassing a total 67 units, in the UK confirmed use of citrate anticoagulation for CRRT. Units reported a mean of 71 days to implement a citrate system (range 0 to 645 days). Prismaflex\u00ae (Baxter) and Multifiltrate (Fresenius) were reported as the most commonly used citrate systems; 32 (47.8%) and 28 (41.8%) units respectively.",

            "text": "Conclusions: There are 279 ICUs in the UK [2] . We conclude that a minimum of 67 units (24%) use citrate anticoagulation for CRRT in UK critical care centres. Citrate systems of anticoagulation are becoming an increasing popular choice for regional anticoagulation, falling in line with international guidance [3] . These guidelines were introduced in 2012 which corresponds to increase national uptake. Introduction: Patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) whilst on significant doses of vasoactive medications have often been deemed unsuitable to undergo ultrafiltration (UF). However with better understanding of the pathophysiology of renal injury [1] in intensive care patients we hypothesise that vasopressor/inotrope requirement will not significantly increase with UF or with a more negative fluid balance (FB). Methods: Data was retrospectively collected in a general ICU/HDU of adult patients requiring acute RRT for acute kidney injury. Patients on chronic dialysis were excluded. Percentage change in vasopressor index and mean arterial pressure were combined to form the Combined Percentage Change (CPC) which we used as an index of patient stability. Results: 38 patients were assessed undergoing a total of 206 RRT sessions. The mean age was 57 with 23 females and 15 males. Mean FB for the 24 hours from start of RRT was +651mls (range -2317 to +14850mls). Using a model to correct for significant covariates and plotting 24 hour FB against CPC we found no significant effect of FB on stability p=0.98 (Fig. 1 ). Mean UF volume was 880mls (range 0-3009mls). There was a non linear relationship between UF and stability with moderate volumes improving but larger volumes worsening stability (Fig. 2 ). This did not reach statistical significance (p=0.074) so may be due to chance but is likely due to a lack of power. Conclusions: Fluid balance has no effect on cardiovascular stability during RRT in our cohort but there may be a varying effect of UF depending on volume. Introduction: Exposure of blood to a foreign surface such as a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) filter could lead to activation of platelets (plt) and fibrinogen (fib) trapping. Thrombocytopenia has been reported in adults on CRRT but data in pediatrics are scarce. Our institution uses regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) as standard of care with prefilter hemodilution and HF1000 filters (polysulfone, surface area (SA) 1.1 m2) regardless of patients' (pts) age and size. As filter SA is relatively larger in younger pts, we aimed to investigate the impact of CRRT filter change on hemostasis parameters in infants on CRRT in up to first three filter changes. Methods: Retrospective chart review Results: 30 patients < 10 kg were included, age 4.3 (0.5-8) months, weight 5.4+2.4 kg, with 88 filters. Metabolic disease was the most common principal diagnosis (7/30, 23%), liver failure (LF) was the most common comorbidity (12/30, 40%). All patients received prefilter continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with minimum dose of 2000 ml/1.73m2/h. Thrombocytopenia was common at CRRT start (28/30, 93%). Plts decreased in 74% filter changes (65/88) by 15+70% (pre vs post plt 71 (44-111) vs 50(30-83), p<0.001). Fibrinogen also decreased from 201 (152-261) to 170 (134-210), p<0.001; there was no change in PTT, PT, or INR values before and after filter changes. Bleeding events were seen in 13/30 (43%) of pts (8/12 of LF pts vs 5/ 18 others, p=0.04), but were not more common in pts who had decrease in plts or fib with filter changes (41% with drop in plts vs 57% without, p=0.66; 47% with drop in fib vs 75% without, p=0.58). Conclusions: Thrombocytopenia is common in infants on CRRT. Further decreases in plt and fibrinogen can be seen in with CRRT filter changes if the filters are relatively large compared to patient size. Bleeding events seems more related to underlying comorbidity, and less to changes in hemostatis parameters observed with filter change but would need to be confirmed with further studies.",

Introduction: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of postfilter calcium concentrations (pfCa) in terms of safety and efficacy in large retrospective cohort of patients treated with CVVHD and regional citrate anticoagulation. Methods: Retrospective, observational study at a university hospital with 6 ICUs. All patients treated with RCA-CRRT were included in the study. Results: Among 1070 patients treated with RCA-CVVH pfCa at the start of the CVVHD was available in 987 pts. The pfCa concentrations were in target range (0.25-0.35 mmol/L) in the majority of patients (70%), whereas 17% and 13% of patients had the pfCa below or above the target range, respectively. In the further 72h of CVVHD treatment the propotion of patients with targeted pfCa increased to 86% and remained stable. At the start of the RCA-CVVHD there was a significant but weak correlation between the pfCa and ionized systemic Ca (iCa) with a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.374 (p < 0.001). The coefficient of variation of pfCa concentraions was significantly higher if compared to the coefficient of variation of iCa concentration. Using per protocol adaptations the incidence of a severe hypocalcemia (<0.9 mmol/L) was low and present only at first 12 hours of therapy: 4% and 2% of patients with pfCa below the target range and 0.7% and 0.4% of patients with pfCa in target range, at 0h and 12h respectively (p<0.001). There was no correlation between pfCa concentrations and filter lifetime.",

Present results need to be validated in further trials. Introduction: In critically ill patients, occurrence of pain is frequent and usually correlates with worse outcomes, such as prolonged ICU length of stay (LOS) and mechanical ventilation. In this regard, pain leads to sympathetic activation, inflammatory mediators and therefore, potentially to organic dysfunction. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between acute pain in critically ill patients and their association with acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: Retrospective cohort with 6345 adults patients admitted between June 2013 and June 2016, from the ICU of Hospital S\u00edrio Liban\u00eas Hospital in Sao Paulo (Brazil). Main exclusion criteria were: length of stay < 48h, coma and previous AKI. The predictor pain was obtained through daily electronic records according to numerical verbal scale (0-10). The outcome was defined as serum creatinine elevation equal to or greater than 0.3mg/dl and/or greater than 50% increase at any time after the first 48 hours in the ICU. The multivariate analysis was performed by Binary Logistic Regression through distinct groups of early or late predictive factors in relation to AKI. Results: After the exclusion of 3220 patients, the incidence of pain with numerical verbal scale equal to or greater than 3 points was 23.6%. The outcome occurred in 31.7% of the cohort. In the binary regression, using the more early predictive factors, sex and pain presented independent relation with the outcome -adjusted OR 1.24 (1.12-1.36) and 1.63 (1.34-1.98), respectively (p <0.001). In the analysis Conclusions: Poor management of ICU pain is associated to worse outcomes, including increased risk to AKI. The search for a better pain management strategy in the ICU scenario should therefore be reinforced. Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalised patients, strongly associated with adverse outcomes [1] . A lack of baseline incidence and outcome data limits our ability to assess local strategies aimed at improving AKI care. Methods: In an audit in three linked inner London hospitals we interrogated our electronic patient data warehouse (Cerner Millennium power insight electronic data warehouse) with a specially written query to identify cases of AKI, defined by KDIGO creatinine criteria, in patients aged over 18y admitted for >24h during January to June 2016. We excluded palliative care and obstetric patients. In the absence of premorbid baseline (median 7-365d pre-admission) the admission creatinine value was used. End stage renal disease (ESRD) and primary sepsis diagnosis was obtained from ICD10 coding. Results: Of 28872 admissions, we excluded 1052 with pre-existing ESRD (Hospital mortality 6.0%) and 8833 with fewer than one creatinine result who could not be assigned AKI status (mortality 1.1%). Of the remaining 18987 there were 3145 with AKI (16.6%), with mortality increasing from No AKI group (2.4%), to AKI stage 1 (12.6%), and a further increase to AKI stages 2-3 (22.4%) (p<0.001) ( Table 1) . Patients with AKI were older (p<0.001), more likely to be medical than surgical (p<0.001), more likely to have a primary sepsis diagnosis (p<0.001) and had higher baseline creatinine (median 91 vs 79 p<0.001). No known baseline was found in 29.7% of patients with AKI, but their mortality did not significantly differ to those with a baseline (14.2% vs 16.6%, p=0.093). Conclusions: An electronic query identified the local burden of AKI and it's associated hospital-mortality; such baseline data is essential to assess the effect of Quality Improvement interventions in AKI prevention and care. Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition in critically ill patients [1, 2] . Loop diuretics are generally used as first line treatment. However, controlled trials show controversial results. We ought to search systematically and realize a metaanalysis on the matter. Methods: An electronic search of randomized clinical trials in adult patient treated with diuretics for AKI compared with standard treatment or a control group was conducted. The primary objective of the analysis was to assess recovery of renal function. Secondary endpoints included time to recovery of renal function, need for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT), mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and complications. Introduction: Increased venous pressure is one of the mechanism leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. Portal flow pulsatility and discontinuous intra-renal venous flow are potential ultrasound markers of the impact of venous hypertension on organs.",

During the week following cardiac surgery, 49 patients (33.8%) developed AKI, most often on POD 1 (71.4%). The detection of portal flow pulsatility and severe alterations in renal venous flow (Pattern 3) at ICU admission (POD 0) were associated with AKI in the subsequent 24 hours period and was independently associated with AKI in multivariable models including EUROSCORE II and baseline creatinine ( Table 1 ). The variables associated with the detection of abnormal portal and renal patterns were associated with lower perfusion pressure, higher NT-pro-BNP and inferior vena cava measurements (Table 2) . Conclusions: Abnormal portal and intra-renal venous patterns are associated with early AKI after cardiac surgery. These Doppler features must be further studied as potential treatment targets to personalize management. Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very prevalent after cardiac surgery in children, and associated with poor outcomes [1] . The present study is a preplanned sub-analysis of a prospective blinded observational study on the clinical value of the Foresight nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitor [2] . The purpose of this subanalysis was to develop a clinical prediction model for severe AKI (sAKI) in the first week of PICU stay. Methods: sAKI was defined as serum creatinine (SCr) >/= 2 times the baseline, or urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for >/= 12h. Predictive models were built using multivariable logistic regression. Data collected during surgery, upon PICU admission, as well as monitoring and lab data until 6h before sAKI onset, were used as predictors. Relevant predictors with a univariate association with sAKI, were included in the models. Accuracy of the models was tested using bootstraps, by AUROC and decision curves. Results: 177 children were enrolled, admitted to the PICU of the Leuven University Hospitals after cardiac surgery, between October 2012 and November 2015. 5 patients were excluded. 70 children (40.7%) developed sAKI in the first week of PICU stay. A multivariate model with 5 admission parameters (maximum lactate during surgery, duration of CPB, baseline sCr, RACHS1 and PIM2 scores), and 4 postoperative measurements (average heart rate, average blood pressure, hemoglobin, lactate), was most predictive for sAKI ( Fig. 1) .",

AKI significantly increases the risk of both morbidity and mortality [1] . Methods: 8 ICU patients with septic shock was studied within 24 hrs from admission. 58 patients after cardiac surgery served as control group. All patients were sedated and mechanically ventilated. Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were obtained by the infusion clearance of paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) and by extraction of 51Cr-ethylenediamine (51Cr-EDTA).

GFR (32%, p=0.006) and renal oxygen delivery (RDO2) (24%) where both significantly lower in the study group (Table 1) . There was no difference between the groups in renal oxygen consumption (RVO2) but Renal oxygen delivery was almost 30% lower in septic shock patients. Renal oxygen extraction was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group. In the study group, NAG was 5.4 \u00b1 3.4 units/mikromol creatinine more, i.e 5 times the value in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [2] . Conclusions: Sepsis related AKI is caused by a renal afferent vasoconstriction resulting in a reduced RBF and lowered RDO2 In combination with an anchanged RVO2, this results in a renal oxygen supply/ demand mismatch. Introduction: The primary aim was to determine if the addition of daily creatine kinase (CK) measurement was usefully guiding decision making in intensive care units within Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Methods: After a change to the daily blood ordering schedule to include CK, a retrospective audit was carried out covering a 5-month period within 3 intensive care units. All patients with CK >870 units/ litre were included. Basic demographics, APACHE 2 score and admitting diagnosis were recorded. Utility of CK was assessed by determining the associated diagnosis and whether the diagnosis was first considered (diagnostic trigger) due to CK level, clinical suspicion or haematuria. Additionally, it was determined if and what actions had been taken based on the raised CK and associated diagnoses. Results: Data was collected from 01/08/2016 to 31/12/2016. 276 patients were captured with CK >870 units/litre from an average combined admission rate of 200 patients/month [1] . Total male patients 191 (69.2%) and female 85 (30.8%). Age range 17 to 95 years (mean 54.7). APACHE 2 score range 0 to 45 (mean 20.9) with estimated mean mortality of 36.7%. 176 patients (63.8%) had associated diagnoses with elevated CK including: burns 2 (0.7%), compartment syndrome 7 (2.5%), myocardial infarction 20 (7.2%), myositis/myocarditis 2 (0.7%), neuroleptic malignant syndrome 1 (0.4%), rhabdomyolysis 61 (22.1%), serotonin syndrome 7 (2.5%), surgical procedure 76 (27.5%). As outlined in Fig. 1 the diagnostic trigger was the routine CK measurement in 65 patients (23.6%), prior clinical suspicion 108 (39.1%), haematuria 1 (0.4%) and unclear in 102 (36.9%). Action was The correlation analysis showed the eGFRs from every formula could all to some extent reflect the glomerular function or GFR accurately.

The association between preoperative chloride level or difference in perioperative chloride levels and the incidence of postoperative AKI after liver transplantation were evaluated. Methods: Adult patients (>=18 years old) who underwent liver transplantation at Seoul National University Hospital between 2004 and 2015 were included in the retrospective analysis. The difference between preoperative serum chloride level and the immediate postoperative serum chloride level was defined as intraoperative chloride loading. Postoperative AKI within 7 days of liver transplantation was diagnosed according to the RIFLE criteria. Patients were divided into normochloremia group (96-106 mEq/L), hypochloremia group (<96 mEq/L), or hyperchloremia group (>106 mEq/L) according to their preoperative chloride level.

Introduction: Acute renal failure affects from 1% to 25% of patients in the intensive care units (ICUs)1 and it is associated with excess mortality. Hydratation is a useful preventive measure but it is often controindicated in critically ill patients who, on the contrary, often benefit by a strictly conservative strategy of fluid management. Fenoldopam, a selective dopamine 1-receptor agonist, increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by vasodilating selectively the afferent arteriole of renal glomerulus. The aim of our study is to compare renal effects of fenoldopam and placebo in critically ill patients undergoing a restrictive fluid management. Methods: We enrolled 130 patients admitted to our ICU. Patients were assigned by randomization to study groups: fenoldopam (n=64) and placebo (n=66). Fenoldopam was infused continuously at 0,1 mcg/Kg/ min and equivalent volume for placebo during a period of seven days. Creatinine, cystatin C and creatinine clearance were daily measured as markers of renal function.

Introduction: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a protocol implemented for dysphagia risk factors [1] in hospitalized patients in a CICU (Coronary Intensive Care Unit). Methods: Patients hospitalized in the CICU of a medium-sized hospital in Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil, were subjected to a survey that screened for dysphagia during the period from January of 2016 to September of 2017. Patients with at least one risk factor for dysphagia were evaluated by a phonoaudiologist and are the subject of this study. The information was statistically analyzed using EPI INFO, version 7.2.2.2 software. Considering significant P <0.05 two-tailed, for logistic regressions multivariate estimated in the sample. Results: For this study 1018 patients were selected, of which 57.41% were male and the mean age was 71.77 \u00b1 10.96 years. A higher incidence of dysphagia was observed among patients who had at least one of the following risk factors: stroke (Odds Ratio 9.58 p<0.001); brain tumor (OR 4.49 p=0.0013); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 3.45 p=0.023); degenerative diseases (OR 16.76 p<0.001); lower level of consciousness (OR 13.62 p<0.001); ataxic respiration (OR 2.24 p<0.001); aspiration pneumonia (OR 7.04 p<0.001); orotracheal intubation >48h (OR 13.35 p<0.001); tracheostomy (OR 12.99 p<0.001); airway secretion (OR 24.91 p<0.001); nasoenteral tube (OR 14.9 p<0.001); gastrostomy (OR 4.58 p=0.030). There was no statistical significance for age >60, traumatic brain injury, oropharyngeal surgery and unfavorable dentition. Four factors appeared less than 3 times and could not be analyzed (chagas disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), orofacial burn and excess saliva). Conclusions: We concluded that the dysphagia triage protocol insertion was effective to identify dysphagic patients and can be used as an additional tool in the intensive care risk management. physiological bases of this age old concept, more recently applied to endotracheal intubation, have never been confirmed by current methods. We therefore decided to study the effects of an apnea oxygenation period under HFNC oxygen therapy by means of a novel modelization of the respiratory system. Methods: Firstly, an airway model was built with anatomical, physical and physiological attributes similar to that of a healthy subject (Fig. 1) . This system reproduces the physiological evolution of intrapulmonary gases during apnea by progressively increasing CO 2 levels after having cut off previous O 2 supplies (FIO 2 21%). Secondly, the effects of a HFNC apnea oxygenation of 50l/min with an FIO 2 of 100% were analyzed by collecting intrapulmonary gas samples at regular intervals (Fig. 2) . Results: After 1 minute of apnea oxygenation, intrapulmonary oxygen levels remain stable at 21%. After 5 minutes, oxygen fraction reaches 33%, and increases up to 45% in 10 minutes. Regarding CO 2 levels, no significant modifications were observed. Conclusions: A novel experimental and physiological model of the respiratory system has been developed and confirms the existence of an alveolar oxygen supply as well as the lack of a CO 2 washout during HFNC apnea oxygenation. However, these effects are only observed after a delay of about 1.5 to 2 minutes. Therefore, the clinical interests of this technique to reduce apnea-induced desaturation during intubation of a hypoxemic patient in the ICU seem limited without adequate preoxygenation. Combination of both preoxygenation and apnea oxygenation by HFNC can most likely explain positive results observed in other clinical studies.",

We compare the effectiveness of two different concentrations, 2% lignocaine and 4% lignocaine, in nebulised form for airway anaesthesia during awake fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation in terms of patient's comfort and optimal intubating conditions, intubation time. Methods: Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study and written informed consent obtained; patients of either sex, between 18-55 years age with anticipated difficult airway planned for intubation were included for this study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (A and B) based on sealed envelope method; patients and observers were blinded by using prefilled syringes of lignocaine.One group was nebulized with 10ml of 4% lignocaine(Group A) and other with 10 ml of 2% lignocaine(Group B) in coded syringes via ultrasonic nebuliser for 10 minutes followed by Inj midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV and Inj Fentanyl 1 microgram/kg IV just before the procedure. The fibreoptic broncoscope was introduced via nostril and the other nostril was used for oxygen insufflation (3-4 L/min). The fibroscope was introduced through the glottic opening and visualising tracheal rings and carina.The endotracheal tube railroaded over the fiberscope and cuff inflated. Results: The primary outcome measure was patient's comfort during awake fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation. The mean patient comfort Puchner scale score of Group A was 1.30 \u00b1 0.08 and of Group B was 2.23 \u00b1 0.12. The mean value of Puchner scale of Group B was significantly higher.The mean procedural time of Group B was significantly higher (15.1%) as compared to Group A (p<0.001). The no of intubations attempts did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: 4% nebulised lidocaine provided adequate airway anaesthesia and optimal intubating conditions, patient comfort, stable hemodynamics. Introduction: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate whether video laryngoscopy (VL) improves the success of orotracheal intubation, when compared with direct laryngoscopy (DL). Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases was performed to identify studies comparing VL and DL for emergency orotracheal intubations outside the operating room. The primary outcome was rate of first pass intubation. Subgroup analyses by location, device used, clinician experience, and clinical scenario were performed. The secondary outcome was rate of complications. Results: The search identified 32 studies with 15,064 emergency intubations. There was no overall difference in first-pass intubation with VL compared to DL. Subgroup analysis showed first-pass intubations were increased with VL in the intensive care unit (ICU) (2.02 (1.43-2.85); p<0.01), but not in the emergency department or pre-hospital setting. Rate of first-pass intubations were similar with Glidescope\u00ae and DL, but improved with the CMAC\u00ae (1.32(1.08-1.62); p=0.007). There was greater first-pass intubation with VL than DL among novice/trainee clinicians (OR=1.95 (1.45-2.64); p<0.001), but not among experienced clinicians or paramedics/nurses. There was no difference in first-pass intubation with VL and DL during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or trauma. VL was associated with fewer oesophageal intubations than DL (OR=0.31 (0.14-0.69); p=0.004), but more arterial hypotension (OR=1.49 (1.00-2.23); p=0.05). Conclusions: In summary, compared to DL, VL is associated with greater first-pass emergency intubation in the ICU and among less experienced clinicians. VL is associated with reduced oesophageal intubations but a greater incidence of arterial hypotension.",

All four HEMS stations together cover 24/7 specialist medical care in the Netherlands. In many dispatches the added value is airway related [1] . As part of our quality control cycle, all airway related procedures were analysed. High quality airway management is characterized by high overall and first pass endotracheal intubation (ETI) success [2] . Methods: The HEMS database was analysed for all patients in whom prehospital advanced airway management was performed in the period 2007-2017. Balloon/mask ventilation, supraglottic airway (SGA) devices, total intubation attempts, Cormack & Lehane (C&L) intubation grades, successful ETI, primary and rescue surgical airway procedures and professional background were reviewed. Results: In the 10-year period, there were 17075 dispatch calls. In total 8127 patients were treated in the prehospital setting by our HEMS. Of those, 3233 required a secured airway. ETI was successful in 3078 of 3148 (97.8%). In the remaining 70 patients ( Fig. 1 ) an alternative airway was needed. Rescue surgical airway was performed in 1.4%, 0.5 % received a rescue SGA, rescue balloon/mask ventilation was applied in 0.2% of cases, 1 was allowed to regain spontaneous ventilation and in 0.1% of patients all airway management failed. HEMS physicians, ambulance paramedics, HEMS paramedics and others (e.g. German emergency physicians) had ETI first pass success rates of 83.4%, 59.6%, 62.4% and 84.5% respectively (Fig. 2) . Difficult laryngoscopy (no epiglottis visible) was reported in 2.2% of patients (Table 1) . Conclusions: Our data show that airway management performed by a physician based HEMS operation is safe and has a high overall ETI success rate of 97.8%. The total success rate is accompanied by a high first pass ETI success rate. Introduction: Incidences associated with endotracheal tubes are frequent during mechanical ventilation (MV) of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and can be associated with poor outcomes for patients and detrimental effects on health care facilities. Here, we aimed to identify factors associated with Event occurrence due to Unsafe Management of Endotracheal Tubes (E-UMET). Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs: one surgical ICU, one stroke ICU, and one emergency department, at a tertiary hospital in Japan from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017. Patients requiring MV and oral intubation during their ICU stay were included. The primary finding was the incidence rate of E-UMET (biting, unplanned extubations, and/or displacement of the endotracheal tube). The patients were divided into two groups: with or without E-UMET. To investigate E-UMET, potential factors possibly related to its occurrence were obtained from electronic medical records. We conducted univariable and multivariable analyses to investigate E-UMET factors. Results: Of 410 patients, E-UMET occurred in 112 (27.3%). The mean and standard deviation for age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score were 66 (17) and 25 (7), respectively. According to a multivariate logistic-regression analysis, significant risk factors associated with E-UMET included patients of neurosurgery (odds ratio (OR) 3.3; 95% CI, 1.51-7.46; p=0.003), sedative administration (OR 2.9; 95% CI, 1.63-5.32; p<0.001), and higher Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.24-1.77; p<0.001). The use of a restraint (OR 0.4; 95% CI, 0.22-0.95; p=0.003) was an independent factor associated with a lower probability of E-UMET.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This study suggests that risk factors associated with E-UMET include neurosurgery, higher RASS scores, and the administration of sedatives. Patients with these factors and longer oral intubation periods might require extra care. Introduction: The use of nasal high flow (NHF) as a respiratory support therapy post-extubation has become increasingly more common. NHF has been shown to be non-inferior to NIV and reduces escalation needs compared to conventional oxygen therapy. Clinical outcomes using NHF in patients with Type II Respiratory Failure (RF) is less well understood. Our aim was to determine if NHF can be used successfully when extubating Type II RF patients compared to Type I RF. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study on the use of NHF as an extubation respiratory support in 56 (n=56) consecutive patients in ICU over a 12-month period. Primary outcome was the need for escalation in therapy (NIV, Intubation and Palliation) post extubation. Patients were categorised as high risk if they scored >=1 from: Age>=75 years, BMI>=30 and >=1 medical comorbidity. Results: Analysis was conducted on all fifty-six (n=56) patients. Type I RF group was composed of 25 (n=25) patients with a mean age of 62.7 (\u00b1SD) years. Type II RF group had 31 (n=31) patients with a mean age of 65.5 (\u00b1SD) years. In Type I RF 22 patients (88%) were successfully extubated with NHF compared to 21 patients (67.7%) in Type II. In Type II RF the outcomes were more variable with a greater requirement for NIV. Of these patients 16% required NIV, 3.2% required intubation and 12.9% received NHF therapy for palliation. A higher average BMI (30.32 vs 27.16 kg/m2) was found in unsuccessfully vs successfully extubated patients in Type II RF. In Type I RF escalation of therapy was equally distributed with 4% in each category. Conclusions: The use of NHF for respiratory support post-extubation may become standard practice for Type I RF in critical care settings. Our data suggests that NHF can be used but with caution in Type II RF and clinicians should risk stratify patients to identify those at risk of re-intubation and post-extubation respiratory failure. Introduction: Pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) relies on colonization and microaspiration. Oral topical decontamination reduced the VAP incidence from 18 to 13% [1] . The persistence of antiseptic effect in the oral cavity is questionable; we hypothesize that continuous oral antiseptic infusion may offer a better decontamination. Aim of the work: We developed endotracheal tube that allows continuous oral infusion of chlorhexidine (CHX), and we want to test the technique versus the conventional on bacterial colonization. (Provisional patent: 62359944) Methods: A two identical bio models for the upper airways were manufactured by (3DX Diagnostics, USA) to adapt the modified and the ordinary endotracheal tubes (ETT). The two techniques tested were using six hourly disinfection with CHX (group A) versus disinfection through the 24 hours infusion technique (Group B). Five microorganisms plus mixed bacteria were used and each was tested for five times. Normal saline was used constantly to irrigate the biomodels and Ten ml aliquot was collected by the procedure end. Culturing of the aliquots from decanted broth pre and post disinfection was performed. The time to apply CHX by practitioner was also compared.",

Introduction: Malaria is a common problem in underdeveloped countries, with an estimated mortality of more than one million people per year. Pulmonary involvement is one of the most serious manifestations of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) decreases muscular works and improves gas exchange by recruitment of hypoventilated alveolus. In this context, we analyze the impact of the use of non-invasive ventilation in malaria with pulmonary dysfunction. Methods: It's a retrospective cohort study. We analyzed electronic records of patients who were diagnosed with malaria, with acute respiratory failure, who underwent respiratory therapy with NIV between 2015-2016 within the intensive care unit (ICU). The study variables were: ICU mortality, length of hospital stay, NIV time and outcome groups. Statistical analysis was performed with the Pearson correlation coefficient, with significance level of p <0.01. The statistics were performed using the BioEstat 3.0 program. Results: Thirty-one patients were included in the study. Four results were analyzed according to Table 1 and Fig. 1 . 94% of the patients were discharged from the hospital. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis showed statistical significance in the Group (NIV/Discharge) in the analysis of patients hospitalized versus NIV (95% CI = 0.24 to 0.83 <(p) = 0.0036).",

Introduction: CPAP is used to improve oxygenation in patient with ARF. We aimed to determine non-inferiority (NI) of helmet CPAP to facemask in ARF based on physiological (heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR)) and blood gas parameters (PaO2 and PaCO2). We also compared patients' perception in dyspnea improvement after CPAP using dyspnea scale (visual analogue scale (VAS)) and Likert score. Methods: We randomized 123 patients to helmet (n=64) and facemask (n=59) with 71.7% of ARF was due to acute pulmonary edema. CPAP was applied for 60 minutes. Patients' physiological and blood gas parameters were recorded before and after intervention. Patients then marked on dyspnea scale and Likert score. NI of helmet would be declared if confidence interval (CI) of mean difference between groups (helmet's mean minus facemask's mean) in improving physiological, blood gas parameters and dyspnea scale was no worse than predetermined non-inferiority margin (NIM). Secondary outcome was to compare incidence of discomfort and mucosal dryness between groups. Methods: This is a single center retrospective study performed in the ICU of Tel Aviv Medical Center, Israel, a tertiary academic referral hospital. Using the electronic medical record system and Intensix predictive critical care system for analysis, all patients admitted to the ICU between 1.2007 and 12.2014 were assessed. Respiratory deterioration in MV patients was defined as acute adjustment of FiO2 increase >20% or PEEP increase > 5 cmH2O that persisted for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcome was length of ICU stay (LOS). A Chi square test for trends was used for the significance of mortality data and a one way ANOVA test for LOS. Results: 5376 MV patients were admitted to the ICU with an overall mortality of 16.5%. Mortality and LOS were tripled in patients who experienced at least one respiratory deterioration when compared to no events (33.8% vs. 9.9 %, p<0.0001 and 10.7 vs. 2.2 days, p<0.0001 respectively) (Fig. 1) . Increased events of respiratory deteriorations showed significant trend of increased mortality (p<0.0001). Conclusions: In MV patients, a single respiratory deterioration event carries a 3 times higher mortality rate and Length Of Stay (LOS). Any additional event further increases both parameters.",

It has been shown to predict recruitability in acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, little is known about the application of lung ultrasound in predicting mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: Observational study of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary hospital (National University Hospital, Singapore) in 2015 and 2016. Only the first ICU admissions of these patients were studied. Lung ultrasound was done at six points per hemithorax and scored according to Soummer (Crit Care Med 2012): normal aeration = 0; multiple, well-defined B lines =1; multiple coalescent B lines = 2; lung consolidation = 3. The Lung Ultrasound (LUS) score was calculated as the sum of points (score range 0-36). We analysed the association of LUS score with ICU/hospital mortality, using logistic regression, adjusted for age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score. Results: 247 patients were included (age 62.0 \u00b1 16.2 years; 89 female [36.0%]; APACHE II 29.7 \u00b1 7.9; 88 sepsis diagnosis [35.6%]). ICU and hospital mortality were 16.2% and 29.6% respectively. LUS score was associated with increased ICU (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.09, P=0.07) and hospital (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P=0.045) mortality, adjusted for age and APACHE II score. Conclusions: LUS score was associated with increased ICU/hospital mortality and may be useful for risk stratification of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to ICU. Introduction: Ventilator asynchrony results in morbidities and mortality. The aim of this study was to explore whether and how physicians used patient-ventilator interactions(PVI) to set mechanical ventilators(MV) in Thailand. Methods: Thai physicians treating MV patients were asked to respond to questionnaires distributed in conferences and to e-mails sent. Types of asynchronies encountered and frequency of MV adjustment guided by PVI were evaluated. In addition, correlations between physician's knowledge and 1)confidence to manage asynchronies and 2)their experience were analyzed. Results: Two hundred and eleven physicians answered the questionnaires. Most of them were medical residents and ICU specialists. 82% of them set and adjusted MV by asynchrony guidance and the majority used waveform analysis to more than a half of their patients. The most and the least common asynchronies encountered were double triggering and reverse triggering, respectively, while the most difficult-to-manage and the most easily managed asynchronies were periodic/?A3B2 show $132#?>unstable breathing and flow starvation, respectively. Lack of confidence and knowledge of PVI were the major reasons of physicians who did not perform asynchrony assessment. For knowledge evaluation, more than 50% of physicians incorrectly managed asynchrony. Chest and ICU fellows had the greatest skills in waveform interpretation and asynchrony management with the mean score of 2.62 from the total 5, compared with specialist(2.58), medical residents(1.85), internists(1.84) and general practitioner(0.85). There were poor correlations between years' experience in MV management and the skill in waveform interpretation (r = 0.15, p=0.034) and between physician's confidence in PVI management and the clinical skill (r = 0.27, p<0.001) Conclusions: The majority of Thai physicians realized the importance of PVI, but the skill in asynchrony management was moderate. Intensive programs should be provided to improve their clinical performance. Methods: Six deeply anesthetized swine underwent tracheostomy, thoracostomy and experimental PLEF with 10 ml/kg of radiopaque saline randomly instilled into either pleural space. Animals were ventilated at VT=10ml/kg, frequency=15bpm, I/E=1:2, PEEP=1cmH2O, and FIO2=0.5. Quantitative lung computed tomographic (CT) analysis of regional aeration and global FRC measurements by nitrogen wash-in/wash-out technique were performed in each of these randomly applied positions: semi-Fowler's (inclined 30\u00b0from horizontal in the sagittal plane); prone, supine, and lateral positions with dependent PLEF and non-dependent PLEF (Fig. 1) .",

Some data suggest that assisted ventilation might protect from diaphragmatic thinning. Aims of this study are to evaluate, by ultrasound (US), the change in diaphragm thickness and thickening in patients undergoing controlled and assisted mechanical ventilation (MV) and clinical factors associated with this change. Methods: We enrolled patients who underwent either controlled MV (CMV) for 48 cumulative hours or 48 hours of pressure support (PSV) if ventilation was expected to last for at least 5 days. Patients < 18 years old, with neuromuscular diseases, phrenic nerve injury, abdominal vacuum dressing system and poor acoustic window were excluded. Diaphragm thickness and thickening were measured with US as described by Goligher and clinical data were collected every 48 hours until ICU discharge. Results: We enrolled 44 patients, 13 were excluded because they had less than 4 measurements and 2 for low quality images, leaving 29 patients for analysis. As expected, during CMV diaphragm thickening was almost absent and significantly lower than during PSV (p<0,001). Diaphragm thickness did not reduce significantly during CMV (p=0.201), but during PSV significantly increased (p<0.048) (Fig. 1 , where \"day 0\" represents the first day of PSV). During CMV, in 10/21 patients diaphragm thickness showed a >=10% reduction. They had a significantly higher fraction of days spent in CMV (p=0.005) and longer neuromuscular blocking drugs (NBDs) infusion (p=0.043).

Our purpose of the study was to assess whether electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) can be reliably used to estimate PEEPi in patients undergoing conventional pneumaticallycontrolled pressure support (PSP) ventilation and neutrally-controlled Introduction: Atelectasis develops in critically ill obese patients submitted to mechanical ventilation. The pressure exerted by the abdominal weight on the diaphragm causes maldistribution of ventilation with increased pleural pressure and diminished response to PEEP. Our objective was to analyze the effects of PEEP in the distribution of ventilation in obese and non-obese patients according to BMI (obese >= 30 kg/m 2 , or non-obese: 20 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ), using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Methods: We assessed the regional distribution of ventilation of surgical and clinical patients submitted to a decremental PEEP itration monitored by EIT. We calculated the percent ventilation to the nondependent (anterior) lung regions at the highest and lowest PEEP applied. The highest compliance of respiratory system was consistently observed at intermediate values of PEEP (between those extreme values), indicating that the highest PEEP caused pulmonary overdistension, whereas the lowest PEEP likely caused dependent lung collapse Results: Were enrolled 37 patients, with 15 non-obese patients (25,7\u00b12 kg/m 2 ) and 22 obese patients (32.4\u00b1 1.7 kg/m 2 ). All patients presented progressively decreased ventilation to dependent (posterior) lung regions when PEEP was lowered (P<0.001). Obese patients consistently presented higher ventilation to the anterior lung zones (when compared no nonobese), Fig. 1 Introduction: Lung protective ventilation is the mainstay of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients [1] . Extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) can enhance such strategies [2] and has been shown to be effective in low flow circuits based on renal replacement platforms [3, 4, 5] . We show the results of a pilot study using a membrane lung in combination with a hemofilter based on a conventional renal replacement platform (Prismalung\u2122) in mechanically ventilated hypercapnic patients requiring renal replacement therapy (NCT02590575). Methods: The system incorporates a membrane lung (0.32 m2) in a conventional renal replacement circuit downstream of the hemofilter. 26 mechanically ventilated patients requiring renal replacement therapy were included in the study. Patients had to be hypercapnic at inclusion under protective ventilation. Changes in blood gases were recorded after implementation of the extracorporeal circuit. Thereafter ventilation was intended to be decreased per protocol until baseline PaCO2 was reestablished and changes in VT and Pplat were recorded. Data from 20 patients were included in the final analysis. Results: The system achieved an average CO2 removal rate of 43.4 \u00b114.1 ml/min which corresponded to a PaCO2 decrease from 68.3 \u00b111.8 to 61.8\u00b111.5 mmHg (p<0.05) and a pH increase from 7.18\u00b10.09 to 7.22\u00b10.08 (p<0.05) [ Fig. 1 ]. After adaption of ventilator settings we recorded a decrease in VT from 6.2\u00b10.9 to 5.4\u00b11.1 ml/kg (p<0.05) and a reduction of Pplat from 30.6\u00b14.6 to 27.7\u00b14.1 cmH2O (p<0.05). These effects were even more pronounced in the \"per protocol\" analysis [ Fig. 2 ]. Conclusions: Low flow ECCO2R in combination with renal replacement therapy provides partial CO2 removal at a rate of over 40 ml/min can significantly reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation in hypercapnic patients. Introduction: In ECCO2R-CRRT, efficiency of CO2 removal is higher positioning the oxygenator (OXY) up-stream than down-stream the haemofilter due to higher blood flow (BF) [1] . We tested whether this effect was due to lower pre-filter pressure (PFP). Methods: ECCO2R-CRRT circuit was tested in-vitro (n=10) with the following settings: 5 L bovine blood; BF 450 ml/min; OXY 1.81 m2 (Euroset); CVVH post mode; substitution flow 2500 ml/h; UF rate function off; 1.5 m2 haemofilter (Diapact\u00ae, B.Braun Avitum); sweep air flow 4.5 l/min. PFP was evaluated at baseline, 24, 48 and 72 hours. CO2 extraction was measured at BF of 100, 300 and 500 ml/min. Sweep air flow/blood ratio was 1:10. CO2 was add to obtain PaCO2 of 80 mmHg. CO2 removal rate calculation (2): CO2 removal rate = (CO2 ECCO2R inlet-CO2 ECCO2R outlet)* blood flow (Eq.1) CO2 molar volume at 25\u00b0C [l/mol] = 24; solubility of CO2 at 37\u00b0C = 0.03 mmol/(l*mmHg); HCO3i = inlet HCO3 concentration [mmol/l]; HCO3o = outlet HCO3 concentration [mmol/l]; Pi CO2 = inlet CO2 partial pressure [mmHg]; PoCO2 = outlet CO2 partial pressure [mmHg] equation1 becomes: CO2 removal rate=24 x ((HCO3i + 0.03 x PiCO2) -(HCO3o + 0.03 x PoCO2)) x blood flow (Eq.2) Results: BF of 450 ml/min was always reached with the up-stream configuration. BF was reduced to 400 ml/min with the down-stream configuration due to high PFP alarm (Table 1 ). CO2 removal increased to 34.5 \u00b113.9 to 69.1\u00b129.5, and 126.0\u00b128.4 ml/min, at BF of 100, 300 and 500 ml/ min (p<0.05). Conclusions: BF of 500 ml/min can be reached only with the upstream configuration due to lower circuit PFPs. BF directly correlates to CO2 removal efficiency. We may speculate that simultaneous use of CRRT and LF-ECCO2R and activation of the UF rate function with the down-stream setting may further increase PFP thus forcing to more enhanced reduction of BF and less effective CO2-removal. Introduction: We describe the use of a novel low-flow ECCO2R-CRRT device (PrismaLung-Prismaflex, Baxter Healtcare Gambro Lundia-AB-Lund, Sweden) for simultaneous lung-renal support. Methods: A retrospective review of patients submitted to PrismaLung-Prismaflex due to AKI associated to hypercapnic acidosis during the period May 2016 -August 2017 at Prato Hospital ICU was performed. Data collected were: demographic, physiologic, complications, outcome. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 DS; Anova Test was used to compare changes of parameters over time; significance was set at P< 0,05. Results: We identified 13 patients (mean age 71 \u00b1 13 yr, mean SOFA 12 \u00b1 3). Causes of hypercapnia were moderate ARDS (n=4) and AE-COPD (n=9). In all patients a 13fr double lumen cannula was positioned and 350 ml/min blood-flow with 10 lt oxygen sweep-gas-flow was maintained; iv-heparin aiming to double aPTT was used. Haemo-diafiltration (effluent flow 35 ml/kg/hour) was delivered. In all cases PrismaLung-Prismaflex improved respiratory and metabolic parameters (Figs. 1 and 2) without any complications. All patients survived to the treatment, nevertheless 2patients (1AE-COPD; 1ARDS) died during ICU stay due to irreversible cardiac complications. In ARDS cases: 3 patients were successfully weaned from IMV, mean duration of the treatment was 88 \u00b1 31hours, mean duration of IMV after ECCO2R-CRRT was 2 \u00b1 2 days. In AE-COPD cases: intubation was avoided in 3 patients at risk of NIV failure, 6 patients were successfully weaning from IMV, mean duration of the treatment was 79 \u00b1 31 hours, mean duration of IMV after ECCO2R-CRRT was 0,1 \u00b1 0,3 days. Fig. 1 (abstract P201) . 30 minutes after implementation of the combined renal replacement and ECCO2R circuit a moderate decrease in PaCO2 (-6.5 mmHg) corresponding to a slightly higher pH (0.04) was observed Conclusions: The use of PrismaLung-Prismaflex has been safe and effective: it may be argued that it could be due to the low-blood-flow used. The positive results of this preliminary study may constitute the rational for the design of a larger randomized control trial.",

An intense inflammatory response, expressed by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is activated during SBT. Sepsis, a common condition in ICU patients, has been associated with increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18. IL-18 produced among others by skeletal muscles, has been associated with severe muscle wasting and maybe by ICU acquired weakness. We hypothesised that IL-18 increases during SBT, more evidently in SBT failures. We anticipate this response to be more pronounced in formerly septic patients fulfilling the criteria for SBT.",

Large compensatory breaths following an apnea generally restored MV to near pre-apnea levels.

Introduction: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is an acute lifethreatening event and recurrent episodes of DAH may result in irreversible interstitial fibrosis. Identifying the underlying cause is often challenging but is needed for optimal treatment. Lung biopsy is often performed in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected DAH. However, the role of lung biopsy in this clinical context is unclear. Hence, we sought to identify the spectrum of histopathologic findings and underlying causes in patients with DAH who underwent lung biopsy, surgical or transbronchial. Methods: We identified 59 patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy (n = 25) or bronchoscopic biopsy (n = 34) in the evaluation of DAH over a 19-year period from 1999 to 2017. We extracted relevant clinical pathologic and laboratory data.",

Breath-holding test was performed in the morning before breakfast: voluntary breath-holding duration was assessed three times, with 10 min intervals [2] . A mean value of the duration of the three samples was calculated. The single-breath carbon dioxide test [3] was performed the next day. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All subjects provided signed informed consent to both tests. and January 2017. The data was collected from the hospital electronic and paper notes, and data collected was mortality rate, APA-CHE II score, ICNARC score, type of respiratory support received and whether there was documentation of advanced decisions in case of acute deterioration. Results: There were 12 patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure as a complication of pulmonary fibrosis. The median APACHE II score was 22 and ICNARC standardised mortality ratio was 5.2. Nine patients died on ICU (75%) and hospital mortality was ten (83%). Eight patients (67%) received high flow nasal oxygen, six (50%) received non-invasive ventilation, and two (17%) received invasive ventilation. The median time to death was 3.7 days. Of 11 patients for whom paper notes were available, no patient had any documented ceiling of care or end of life decisions. Conclusions: Our study confirmed a very high mortality in this cohort of patients, supporting national guidance that invasive respiratory support has limited value. We advise that frank discussion with patients and their families should happen early after diagnosis, such that end of life plans are already in place in the event of acute deteriorations. Introduction: ARF is common in critically ill patients. We compared diaphragm contractile activity in medical and surgical patients admitted to ICU with a diagnosis of ARF. Methods: Adult medical and major abdominal laparotomic surgical patients admitted to a general ICU with a diagnosis of ARF were enrolled. ARF was defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio<=300 mmHg/% and need for mechanical ventilation (MV) for at least 24 hours. Diaphragmatic ultrasound was realized bedside when the patient was stable and able to perform a trial of spontaneous breathing. A convex probe was placed in right midaxillary line (8th-10th intercostal space) to evaluate right hemidiaphragm. Diaphragmatic respiratory excursion and thickening were evaluated in M-mode on 3 consecutive breaths and thickening fraction (TF) was calculated. Antropometric, respiratory and hemodynamic parameters, SAPS2, SOFA score, duration of MV, need for tracheotomy and timing, septic state and site of infection, superinfections, ICU and inhospital length of stay (LOS) and outcome were recorded. Patients with trauma and neuromuscular disorders were excluded. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: We enrolled 30 patients: 40% medical and 60% surgical, without differences for age, sex, BMI, SAPS2, SOFA score, sepsis and superinfections. Moderate ARF was prevalent in both groups. During diaphragmatic examination, no differences were recorder for respiratory rate, hemodynamic state and fluid balance. Surgical patients showed a lower but not significant diaphragm excursion (1.6vs1.8cm), instead TF was significantly reduced (58vs90%,p<0.05).",

Methods: Critically ill patients hospitalized in the ICU of the University Hospital of Heraklion, on mechanical ventilation in PAV+ mode were studied. Continuous recordings of all ventilator parameters were obtained for up to three days using a dedicated software. DP was calculated from the PAV+ computed compliance (C) [2] , and the measured exhaled tidal volume (VT, DP=VT/C). Periods of sustained DP above 15 cmH2O were identified, and ventilation and clinical variables were evaluated. Results: Sixty-two patients and 3200 hrs of ventilation were analyzed. In half of the patients, DP was lower than 12 cmH2O in 99% of the recording period, while high-DP (>15cmH2O) more than 10% of the total time was observed in 10% of patients. ICU non-survivors had more time with high DP than survivors (p=0.04). Periods of sustained high-DP (>15cmH2O for >1h) were observed in 9 patients. Level of assist, minute ventilation, and respiratory rate were not different between the periods of high DP and the complete recordings, while VT was higher and C was lower during the high-DP period compared to the complete recording.

Introduction: ARDS may result from various diseases and is characterized by diffuse alveolar injury, lung edema formation, neutrophil-derived inflammation and surfactant dysfunction. Various biomarkers have been studied in diagnostics and prognostication of ARDS. The purpose of the study was to measure the expression of proinflammatory mediators like IL-8 and TNF, a cellular receptor with a role in innate immunity(TLR-2),and a biomarker of fibrogenesis (MMP-7) in different phases of ARDS patients. Methods: We studied 4 patients admitted to our ICU with diagnosis of ARDS during the month of January 2016. Six ml of blood were prospectively collected at two times: during the acute phase and in a sub-acute phase before ICU discharge. Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain the platelet-rich plasma and plasmatic RNA (cRNA) was isolated from platelets.IL-8, TNF, TLR-2 and MMP-7 expression in cRNA was determined by the Droplet Digital\u2122 PCR as copies/ml. Results: All patient showed a decrease in IL-8, TNF, TLR2 and MMP-7 levels after the acute phase of ARDS (Fig. 1) . Patient 1 and 3 were affected by influenza A virus (H3N2), patient 2 was admitted for pneumococcal pneumonia and patient 4 was affected by Legionella. Adequate ethiologic treatment was promptly started in patients with bacterial infection. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 days. All patient survived ICU stay and were discharged from hospital. Conclusions: IL-8, TNF, TLR-2 and MMP-7 expression detected by extracted platelets RNA, may be a novel tool useful for clinicians indicating persistent inflammation with resulting progressive alveolar fibrosis and impaired lung function. More data are necessary to understand the real clinical significance of this biomarkers and their role in fibroproliferation and progression of ARDS. Introduction: Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has been shown to promote lung respiration in acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo, its overall restorative capacity appears to be restricted mainly because of low engraftment in the injured lung. Ang II are upregulated in the injured lung. Our previous study showed that Ang II increased MSCs migration in an Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R)dependent manner [1] . The objective of our study was to determine whether overexpression of AT2R in MSCs augments their cell migration and engraftment after systemic injection in ALI mice. Methods: A human AT2R expressing lentiviral vector was constructed and introduced into human bone marrow MSCs. We also downregulated AT2R mRNA expression using a lentivirus vector carrying AT2R shRNA to transduce MSCs. The effect of AT2R regulation on migration of MSCs was examined in vitro. A mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce ALI was used to investigate the engraftment of AT2R-regulated MSCs and the therapeutic potential in vivo. Results: Overexpression of AT2R dramatically increased Ang II-enhanced human bone marrow MSC migration in vitro. Moreover, MSC-AT2R accumulated in the damaged lung tissue at significantly higher levels than control MSCs 24h and 72h after systematic MSC transplantation in ALI mice. Furthermore, MSC-AT2R-injected ALI mice exhibited a significant reduction of pulmonary vascular permeability and improved the lung histopathology and had additional anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, there were less lung engraftment in MSC-ShAT2R-injected ALI mice compared with MSC-Shcontrol after transplantation. Thus, MSC-ShAT2R-injected group exhibited a significant increase of pulmonary vascular permeability and resulted in a deteriorative lung inflammation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that overexpression of AT2R enhance the migration and lung engraftment of MSCs in ALI mice and may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the injured lung. Introduction: Reorganization of endothelial barrier complex is critical for increased endothelial permeability implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have previously shown hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, the mechanism of HGF in endothelial barrier regulation remains to be unclear. Methods: Recombinant murine HGF with or without mTOR inhibitor rapamycin were introduced on mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) barrier dysfunction stimulated by LPS. Then, endothelial permeability, adherent junction protein (occludin), endothelial injury factors (Endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor), cell proliferation and mTOR signaling associated proteins were tested. Results: Our study demonstrated that HGF decreased LPS-induced endothelial permeability and endothelial cell injury factors, and attenuated occludin expression, cell proliferation and mTOR pathway activation. Conclusions: Our findings highlight activation Akt/mTOR/STAT-3 pathway provides novel mechanistic insights into HGF protective regulation of LPS-induced endothelial permeability dysfunction. Introduction: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-saving intervention for critically ill patients, but may also exacerbate pre-existing lung injury, a process termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Interestingly, we Fig. 1 (abstract P227) . Fluorescein isothiocyanate-Dextran or fluorescein isothiocyanate-BSA analysis of the effect of HGF on PMVECs permeability Fig. 2 (abstract P227) . Western blot analysis of HGF on mTOR signaling pathway discovered that the severity of VILI is modulated by the circadian rhythm (CR). In this study, we are exploring the role of the myeloid BMAL1, a core clock component, in VILI. Methods: We employed mice lacking Bmal1 in myeloid cells (LyzMCre-Bmal1-/-) and LyzMCre mice as controls. At circadian time (CT) 0 or CT12, mice were subjected to high tidal volume MV to induce VILI. Lung compliance, pulmonary permeability, neutrophil recruitment, and markers of pulmonary inflammation were analyzed to quantify VILI. To assess neutrophil inflammatory responses in vitro, myeloid cells from bone marrow of WT and Bmal1-deficient animals were isolated at dawn ZT0 (Zeitgeber time 0) and dusk (ZT12), incubated with DCFH-DA and stimulated for 15 min with PMA or PBS. Neutrophil activation (Ly6G/CD11b expression) and ROS production (DCFH-DA/Ly6G+ cells) were quantified. Results: Injurious ventilation of control mice at CT0 led to a significant worsening of oxygenation, decrease of pulmonary compliance, and increased mortality compared to CT12. LyzMCre-Bmal1-/-mice did not exhibit any significant differences when subjected to MV at CT0 or CT12. Mortality in LyzMCre-Bmal1-/-mice after VILI was significantly reduced compared to LyzMCre controls (CT0). Neutrophils isolated from control mice at ZT0 showed a significantly higher level of activation and increased ROS production after PMA-stimulation compared to ZT12. ROS production of LyzMCre-Bmal1-/-neutrophils did not differ from ZT0 to ZT12. Conclusions: The lack of the clock gene Bmal1 in myeloid cells leads to increased survival after injurious ventilation and to loss of circadian variations in neutrophil ROS production. This suggests that the internal clock in myeloid cells is an important modulator of VILI severity. Introduction: Hemodynamic resuscitation by means of fluids and norepinephrine (NE) is currently considered as a cornerstone of the initial treatment of septic shock. However, there is growing concern about the side effects of this treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the hemodynamic resuscitation and the development of the ARDS. Methods: 18 New Zealand rabbits. Animals received placebo (SHAM=6) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without (EDX-R, n=6; EDX-NR, n=6) hemodynamic resuscitation (fluids: 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate; and later NE infusion titrated up to achieve theirs initial arterial pressure). Animals were monitored with an indwelling arterial catheter and an esophageal Doppler. Respiratory mechanics were continuously monitored from a sidestream spirometry. Pulmonary edema was analyzed by the ratio between lung wet and lung dry weight (W/D), and the histopathological findings. Results: SHAM group did not show any hemodynamic or respiratory changes. The administration of the LPS aimed at increasing cardiac output and arterial hypotension. In the LPS-NR group, animals remained hypotensive until the end of experiment. Infusion of fluids in LPS-R group increased cardiac output without changing arterial blood pressure, while the norepinephrine reversed arterial hypotension. Compared to the LPS-NR group, the LPS-R group had more alveolar neutrophils and pneumocytes with atypical nuclei, thicker alveolar wall, non-aerated pulmonary areas and less lymphocyte infiltrating the interstitial tissue. In addition, the airway pressure increased more in the group LPS-R, and the W/D, although slightly higher in the LPS-R, did not show significant differences.",

            "text": "Conclusions: In this model of experimental septic shock resuscitation with fluid bolus and norepinephrine increased cardiac output and normalized blood pressure but worsened lung damage. Obese patients have been excluded from most of the clinical trials testing the effects of PEEP in ARDS. We hypothesized that in morbidly obese patients the massive load of the abdomen/chest further increases lung collapse thus aggravating the severity of respiratory failure due to ARDS. Methods: We performed a clinical crossover study to investigate the contribution of lung collapse to the severity of respiratory failure in ARDS obese patients and to determine the specific contribution of titrated PEEP levels and lung recruitment to changes in lung morphology, mechanics and gas exchange. Patients were studied at the PEEP (PEEPICU) levels selected at our institution and at PEEP levels establishing a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (PEEPINC) and at PEEP levels determining the lowest lung elastance during a decremental PEEP (PEEPDEC) trial following RM. Results: Thirteen patients were studied. At PEEPICU end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure was negative, lung elastance was increased and hypoxemia was present (Table 1) . Regardless the titration technique there was no difference in the PEEP level obtained. At PEEPINC level endexpiratory lung volume increased, lung elastance decreased thus improving oxygenation. Setting PEEP according to a PEEPDEC trial after a RM further improved lung elastance and oxygenation. At PEEDEC level after a RM lung collapse and overdistension were minimized (Fig. 1) . All patients maintained titrated PEEP levels up to 24 hours without complications. Conclusions: In severely obese patients with ARDS, setting PEEP according to a PEEPINC trial or PEEPDEC trial following a RM identifies the same level of optimal PEEP. The improvement of lung mechanics, lung morphology and oxygenation at PEEPDEC after a RM suggests that lungs of obese ARDS patients are highly recruitable and benefit from a RM and high PEEP strategy. Introduction: Lung protective ventilation (LPV) strategies, principally focused around the use of tidal volumes <6 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) remains an enduring standard of care for ventilated patients. However, implementation of and compliance with LPV is highly variable. We used 'nudge'-based interventions to assess if these can improve LPV.",

There was, overall a statistically significant reduction tidal volume (p<0.001). There was improvement in the ventilation of male patients (p<0.001) but female patients endured higher tidal volumes. There was a mixed picture in different BMI grades. Conclusions: Reducing tidal volumes in mechanically ventilated patients can be done through a mix of behavioural and educational interventions, as well as using technological shortcuts. This helps to reduce the effort on the part of clinical staff to adhere to best practices, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Introduction: Lung protective ventilation (LPV) using a tidal volume (VT) of 6-8mL/Kg ideal body weight (IBW) is recommended in the intensive care unit and theatres to reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications. The aim of this audit was to assess the extent to which LPV is used in theatres in a busy district general hospital and to implement measures to promote adherence to the recommendations. Methods: Anaesthetists completed questionnaires for all patients undergoing general anaesthesia at Northwick Park Hospital over 1 week. Demographics, actual body weight (ABW), height, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and procedural information were recorded. Ventilatory parameters included the ventilation mode, VT, and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP (Fig. 1) . Significantly more females (75%) received VT >=8ml/kg than males (29%) (p<0.01) (Fig. 2) . VT was independent of age, ASA, BMI, ventilation mode, speciality, and patient position. Conclusions: Over half of the patients received VT >=8ml/kg IBW. Females were more likely to be over ventilated. A likely contributing factor is the disparity between ABW and IBW in this cohort. We organised staff teaching and constructed IBW charts with the appropriate corresponding tidal volumes to be displayed in all theatres to promote the use of LPV. Results: There were significant differences in ARDS incidence between groups: ARDS developed in 12.4% of protective MV groups vs. 68.3% of standard MV group (p=0.0001, Fisher's exact test). VAP patients ventilated in a protective mode presented with lower duration of MV (12.2\u00b14.2 days) and ICU stay(16.1\u00b13.2 days) than patients with standard MV (17.2\u00b15.2 and 20.1\u00b15.5 days). There were significant differences in mortality rates between patient groups: 24.1% in protective MV and 47.2% in standard MV (p=0.0043, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: Protective MV prevents the development of ARDS in VAP septic patients. Introduction: Reduction of tidal volumes (TV) below 6 mL/kg associated with low driving pressure (dP) might improve lung protection in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The current study tests the combination of coaxial double lumen endotracheal tube (to reduce instrumental dead-space) and moderately respiratory rate (RR) (<80 bpm) to maintain CO2 at clinically acceptable levels while using ultraprotective TV. The objective is to considerably reduce dP, which has been preconized as an index more strongly associated with survival than TV, per se, Methods: 8 juvenile pigs were anesthetized, intubated and mechanically ventilated. Severe lung injury (P/F<100) was induced using a double-hit model: repeated surfactant wash-out followed by injurious mechanical ventilation using low positive end-expiratory pressure and high dP (~40cmH2O) for 3 hours. Then VTs of 6, 4, and 3 ml/kg were used in random sequence for 30 min each, both using a standard and coaxial endotracheal tube. At each VT level, RR was adjusted to achieve PaCO2=60 mmHg but not exceeding 80 bpm. Lung functional parameters and blood gas analysis were measured at each VT level. Statistical analysis was performed using mixed linear model. Results: Coaxial endotracheal tube, but not the conventional tube, allowed decreasing VT to 4 and 3 ml/kg, while keeping PaCO2 at approximately 60 mmHg and RR<80 bpm, reducing dP of 4.0 cmH2O and 6.0 cmH2O, respectively, compared to the conventional VT of 6 ml/kg (Fig. 1) .",

Introduction: Mechanical ventilation can, while being lifesaving, also cause injury to the lungs. The lung injury is caused by high pressures and mechanical forces but also by inflammatory processes which are not fully understood [1] . Heparin binding protein (HBP) released by activated granulocytes has been indicated as a possible mediator of increased vascular permeability in the lung injury associated with trauma and sepsis [2, 3] . We wanted to investigate if HBP levels were increased in bronco alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or plasma in a pig model of ventilator induced lung injury. Methods: Anaesthetized pigs were surfactant depleted by saline lavage and randomized to receive ventilation with either tidal volumes of 8 ml/kg with a PEEP of 8 cm H2O (controls, n=6) or 20 ml/kg with a PEEP of 0 cm H2O (ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) group, n=6). Plasma and BAL samples of HBP were taken at 0,1,2,4 and 6 hours (Fig. 1) . Results: Characteristics of pigs by study group are shown in Table  1 . Plasma levels of HBP did not differ significantly between pigs in the control and VILI group at any time of sampling. HBP levels in BAL fluid were significantly higher in the VILI group after 1 (p=0.04), 2 (p=0.03), 4 (p<0.01) and 6 (p=0.02) hours of ventilation (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "Methods: 20 patients with mild (n=8) or moderate (n=12) ARDS were included. VT was gradually lowered from 6 to 5, 4.5 and 4 mL/kg, and PEEP adjusted to reach 23<=Pplat<=25 cm H2O. Stand-alone ECCO2R (PRISMALUNG, no hemofilter associated with the RRT platform) was initiated when arterial PaCO2 increased by >20% from its initial value. Ventilation parameters (VT, RR, PEEP), respiratory system compliance, Pplat and driving pressure, arterial blood gases, and ECCO2R-system characteristics were collected during at least 24 hours of ultraprotective ventilation. Complications, day-28 mortality, need for adjuvant therapies, and data on weaning off ECCO2R and mechanical ventilation were also recorded. Results: While VT was reduced from 6 to 4 mL/kg and Pplat kept <25 cmH2O, PEEP was significantly increased from 13.4\u00b13.6 at baseline to 15.0\u00b13.4 cm H2O, and the driving pressure was significantly reduced from 13.0\u00b14.8 to 7.9\u00b13.2 cm H2O (both p<0.05). The PaO2/ FiO2 ratio and respiratory-system compliance were not modified after VT reduction. Mild respiratory acidosis occurred, with mean pH decreasing from 7.39 \u00b1 0.1 to 7.32 \u00b1 0.10 from baseline to 4-mL/kg VT. Mean extracorporeal blood flow, sweep-gas flow and CO2 removal were 421\u00b140 mL/min, 10\u00b10.3 L/min and 51\u00b125 mL/min, respectively. Mean treatment duration was 31\u00b122 hours. Day-28 mortality was 15%. Introduction: There is no consensus on the management of anticoagulation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is currently burdened by a high rate of hemostatic complications, possibly associated with inadequate monitoring of heparin anticoagulation. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of an anticoagulation protocol for patients undergoing ECMO based on Thromboelastography (TEG) as opposed to an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based protocol. Methods: We performed a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in two academic tertiary care centers. Adult patients with acute respiratory failure treated with veno-venous ECMO were randomized to manage heparin anticoagulation using a TEG-based protocol (target 16-24 minutes of the R parameter, TEG group), or a standard of care aPTT-based protocol (target 1.5-2 of aPTT ratio, aPTT group). Primary outcomes were safety and feasibility of the study protocol. Results: Forty-two patients were enrolled, 21 were randomized to the TEG group and 21 to the aPTT group. Duration of ECMO was similar in the two groups (9 (7-16) days in the TEG group and 11 (4-17) days in the aPTT group, p=0.74). Heparin dosing was lower in the TEG group compared to the aPTT group (11.7 (9.5-15.3) IU/kg/h versus 15.7 (10.9-21.3) IU/kg/h respectively, p=0.03). Safety parameters, assessed as number of hemorrhagic or thrombotic events and transfusions given, were not different between the two study groups. As for the feasibility, the TEG-based protocol triggered heparin infusion rate adjustments more frequently (p<0.01) and results were less frequently in the target range compared to the aPTT-based protocol (p<0.001). Number of prescribed TEG or aPTT controls (according to study groups) and protocol violations were not different between the study groups. Conclusions: TEG can be safely used to guide anticoagulation management during ECMO. Its use was associated with the administration of lower heparin doses compared to a standard of care aPTTbased protocol. Methods: Single-center retrospective study of patients (n=152; 45 \u00b111.8 years; 63% males) undergoing VV-ECMO for severe ARDS. The ACP-Score (0-4) was calculated immediately before ECMO initiation and at ECMO-Day1, -Day3 and -Day7, as follows: pneumonia as cause of ARDS -1 point; driving pressure >=18cmH2O -1 point; PaO2/FiO2 ratio <150mmHg -1 point; PaCO2 >=48mmHg -1 point. Results: Longer duration of mechanical ventilation before VV-ECMO was associated with higher ACP-Scores. Patients with higher ACP-Scores before VV-ECMO also presented longer total duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay. After VV-ECMO initiation, ACP-Scores significantly decreased from 3.0\u00b10.74 to 1.5\u00b10.84, 1.5 \u00b10.96 and 1.6\u00b10.99 at ECMO-Day1, -Day3 and -Day7, respectively. At ECMO-Day7, patients with higher ACP-Scores (3-4) presented increased hospital mortality when compared with patients with lower ACP-Scores (0-2): 47.6 vs. 24.7%, respectively (p=0.038). At ECMO-Day7, high driving pressures and low PaO2/FiO2 ratios were the ACP-Score determinants that significantly associated with increased hospital mortality. Conclusions: In severe ARDS, VV-ECMO support allowed a significant and sustained ACP-Score reduction in most patients. This was achieved by artificial lung correction of low PaO2/FiO2, hypercapnia and elevated driving pressures. After an initial period of VV-ECMO support, patients with higher ACP-Scores present higher mortality rates. Our results suggest that on-going adjustment of ECMO and ventilation parameters is necessary to maximize outcome. Introduction: We sought to use mechanical power to describe \"lung rest\" in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mechanical power describes work done by the ventilator on the patient's respiratory system over time. This concept unifies tidal volume, rate, and total pressure delivered during the ventilatory cycle into a discrete value that may be useful to guide ventilatory support. We hypothesized that initiation of ECMO led to decreased mechanical power delivered to the patient. Methods: We reviewed the charts of the three medical intensive care unit patients at our institution supported with ECMO for severe ARDS. We collected data on plateau pressure, driving pressure, and mechanical power before initiating ECMO, then at <6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after. We calculated the mechanical power delivered by the ventilator to the patient in Joules per minute as 0.098 x respiratory rate x tidal volume x (peak pressure -\u00bd x driving pressure) [1] . Results: All patients were alive at discharge and at 90 days. Mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 at ECMO initiation was 64\u00b138, mean plateau pressure was 37\u00b13 cm water. All patients received neuromuscular blockade at initiation of ECMO. Following ECMO initiation, mechanical power decreased by an average of 58%\u00b114% initially, by 69%\u00b14% at 24 hours, and by 66%\u00b117% at 72 hours (Fig. 1) . By comparison, driving pressure changed by an average value of -0.3\u00b18.0, -0.3\u00b15.5, and -2.0\u00b14.6 cm water over those same intervals. Average plateau pressure changed by -3.3\u00b15.7, -4.7\u00b15.5, and -1.7\u00b16.4 cm water during the same time period (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: In our limited case series, mechanical power decreased significantly following initiation of ECMO in patients with severe ARDS. We suggest mechanical power may be more useful than changes in driving pressure or plateau pressure when pursuing \"lung rest\" during ECMO. Introduction: It is not clear whether acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is independently associated with mortality after controlling for underlying risk factor and baseline severity of illness. We attempted to assess the attributable mortality of ARDS by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and reference lists to identify observational studies reporting mortality rates of critically ill patients with and without ARDS. All included studies were matched for underlying risk factor. Primary outcomes were all-cause in hospital-mortality and short-term mortality (combined 28 day-mortality and intensive care unit-mortality). We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with a random-effects model. Our meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO. Results: Of the 3119 initially retrieved articles, 41 studies (44 cohorts) involving 58408 patients were included. The underlying risk factor was sepsis, trauma and other in 15, 18 and 11 cohorts, respectively. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with versus without ARDS (31 cohorts; 54101 patients; RR 2.63, 95% CI 2.01-3.44; P<0.001). We saw a numerically stronger association between ARDS and inhospital mortality in trauma (RR 3.15, 95% CI 2.17-4.57; P<0.001) than sepsis (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.24-2.63; P=0.002). Short-term mortality was higher in patients with versus without ARDS (14 cohorts; 8040 patients; RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.27-2.78; P=0.002). ARDS was independently associated with mortality in approximately half of the 11 cohorts which controlled for baseline severity of illness using a multivariable analysis. Conclusions: The accumulated evidence suggests that ARDS is independently associated with mortality after controlling for underlying risk factor; the association is stronger for trauma than septic patients. Evidence is mixed as to whether ARDS is independently associated with mortality after controlling for baseline severity of illness. Introduction: Evidence is mixed as to whether acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is independently associated with mortality after controlling for baseline severity of illness, particularly in patients with sepsis. Methods: This was an observational study comparing mortality rates of septic patients with and without ARDS. Subjects for the present study were enrolled in 3 ongoing prospective cohorts of critically ill patients hospitalized in medical intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States or South Korea. ARDS was defined using the Berlin definition for cases after 2012 and the American-European Consensus Conference definition for cases before 2012. Sepsis was defined using the Sepsis-3 definition. Baseline severity of illness was assessed using a modified sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) after exclusion of the respiratory component. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. Results: Of the 1024 critically ill patients enrolled in the 3 cohorts, 771 (75.3%) had sepsis and comprised the population of the present study. Of the 771 septic patients, 166 (21.5%) had ARDS. Patients with versus without ARDS had higher SOFA score; both total (median 14 vs 11; P<0.001) and modified (11 vs 10; P<0.001). The unadjusted mortality of septic patients with ARDS was higher than septic patients without ARDS (46.7% vs 22.4%; P<0.001). After controlling for baseline modified SOFA score, both moderate and severe ARDS remained significant predictors for in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) 2.90; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.66-5.03; P<0.001 and OR 3.91; 95% CI 2.33-6.58; P<0.001, respectively]. In contrast, after controlling for baseline modified SOFA score, mild ARDS was not associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.40-2.39; P=0.94). Conclusions: Among critically ill patients with sepsis, moderate and severe, but not mild, ARDS are associated with mortality after controlling for baseline severity of illness.",

Our hypothesis was that there could be heterogeneity in the assignment, because of the History and ECG parameters. For this reason, our objective was to test the HEART reliability. There are no published studies on this topic. Methods: This is a multicenter retrospective study conducted in 3 Italian EDs between March and October 2017 using clinical scenarios. Twenty emergency physicians were included, provided that they had undergone a course on HEART score. We used 53 scenarios from a medical database with each scenario including demographic and clinical characteristics. Each participant assigned scores to the scenarios using the HEART. We tested the measure of interrater agreement using the kappa-statistic, the confidence intervals are bias corrected. A p-value of <0.05 was used to define statistical significance. Results: The participants' assignment is shown in Fig. 2 . The overall inter-rater reliability was good: Kappa = 0.63 (CI 95%; 0.57 -0.72); with a good agreement between the low and high class of risk but a moderate reliability in the medium class: Kappa= 0.72, 0.70 and 0.51. We have not found differences of inter-rater reliability among the senior (more than 5 yrs in ED) and junior physicians: Kappa= 0.65 (CI 95%; 0.57 -0.73) and 0.60 (CI 95%; 0.51 -0-72).The HEART score showed the worse value of inter-rater reliability in the History and ECG parameters : K inter = 0.37 (CI 95%; 0.33 -0.44) and 0.42 (CI 95%; 0.29 -0.50). Conclusions: The HEART showed a good inter-rater reliability but a fair agreement in the History parameter. The clinical experience doesn't influence the agreement in the assignment. The main limit of this study lies in using scenarios rather than real patients. Introduction: The aim of the experiment was to study the efficacy of preconditioning, based on changes in inspiratory oxygen fraction on endothelial function in a model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in conditions of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

In order to rationalize both hemodynamic and anesthesia management, we implemented monitoring guidelines for patients undergoing major cancer surgery. Methods: Early 2014, and for all eligible patients, we started to recommend (Standard Operating Procedure, SOP) cardiac output, central venous oxygen saturation, and depth of anesthesia monitoring with specific targets (MAP > 65 mmHg, SVV < 12%, CI > 2.5 l/min/ m 2 , ScvO2 > 75%, 40 < BIS < 60). Eligibility criteria were pelvic or abdominal cancer surgery expected to last > 2 hours in adult patients. Pre-, intra-, and post-operative data were collected from our electronic medical record (EMR) database and compared before (from March to August 2013) and after (from March to August 2014) the SOP implementation. Results: A total of 596 patients were studied, 313 before and 283 after the SOP implementation. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, ASA score, duration and type of surgery, The surgical POSSUM score was higher after than before (20 vs 18, p=0.045). The use of cardiac output, ScvO2 and BIS monitoring increased from 40 to 61%, 61 to 81%, and 60 to 88%, respectively (all p values < 0.05). Intraoperative fluid volumes decreased (16.9 vs 15.2 ml/kg/h, p=0.002), whereas the use of inotropes increased (6 vs 13%, p=0.022). The rate of postoperative delirium (16 vs 8%, p=0.005) and urinary track infection (6 vs 2%, p=0.012) decreased, as well as the median hospital length of stay (9.6 vs 8.8 days, p=0.032). Conclusions: In patients undergoing major surgery for cancer, despite an increase in surgical risk, the implementation of guidelines with predefined targets for hemodynamic and brain monitoring was associated with a significant improvement in postoperative outcome. Introduction: Tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is low in patients with severe preeclampsia, which would explain multiple organ failure and death in these patients. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the base deficit and the risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Methods: Retrospective multicenter cohort study included pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia admitted to six intensive care units at tertiary referral centers during a ten years period in Colombia. Clinical information was gathered from hospital medical records. The correlation of base deficit with adverse maternal outcomes was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Outcomes were maternal death, acute kidney injury, HELLP syndrome, transfusion, eclampsia and extreme neonatal morbidity. Results: 731 patients were included in the study, we found a total of 21 (2,8%) maternal deaths, the median calculated base deficit obtained was -5.5 meq/L. Patients with base deficit greater than -8.0meq/L had significantly higher mortality rates OR 3.02 (CI 1.26-7.2) P 0,013. This group of patients was also associated with a higher probability of developing a class 1 HELLP syndrome OR 1.7 (CI 1.02-2.82) P 0,03. A more mild alteration in the base deficit (greater than -5.0meq/L) was related to the appearance of kidney injury OR 2.25 (CI 1.52-3.34) P 0.00 y complete HELLP OR 2.17 (CI 1.60-2.96) P 0.00. Conclusions: Base deficit is related to worse outcomes in patients with severe preeclampsia. According to our results, a cut-off point greater than -8meq/L, there is a higher risk of death and worse outcomes such as class 1 HELLP syndrome.",

We have lack of knowledge about comparability of different LSCI devices due to the arbitrary units (AU) used to define blood flux. We sought to examine the linearity between skin blood flux, recorded using two different LSCI devices. Methods: We performed post-occlusive reactive hyperemia test (PORH) on the arm and measured blood flux on the hand using two different LSCI devices (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK and Perimed AB, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Sweden). All volunteers were measured at baseline, during occlusion and after release of occlusion during the hyperemia phase. The third finger and fourth finger nail were selected for recording blood flux and AU were used to express values. Results: Fifteen healthy, non-smoker male volunteers participated in this study. An excellent correlation was found between the two LSCI devices (finger: R2:0.79, p<0.001 & finger nail: R2:0.68, p<0.001). Data were also assessed in terms of the variability at different stages of the PORH test (Fig. 1a-d) . Correlation of devices was still high at baseline, first minute of occlusion and in the post-occlusion hyperemia phase. However, in the period between 1 minute after start of the occlusion and the beginning of the hyperemia, correlation was lower for the whole finger (R2:0.21, p=0.002) and correlation was lost for fingernail (R2:0.05, p=0.14) between the two devices. Conclusions: Skin blood flux measured with two different LSCI devices are linearly correlated with each other. However care should be taken when assessing patients with low blood flux such as occurs during shock and ischemic organs. Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyperoxia and mild hypoxia on microcirculatory perfusion in a rat model. Methods: Spontaneously breathing anesthetized (isoflurane) male Wistar rats (n=12) were equipped with arterial (left carotid) and venous (right jugular) cannulae and tracheotomy. Rats were randomized in 3 groups: normoxiainspired oxygen fraction (FiO 2 ) of 0.21; hyperoxia -FiO 2 1; mild hypoxia -FiO 2 0.15. The following measurements were taken hourly for 4 hours: blood gases, mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume index (SVI) and heart rate (echocardiography), skeletal muscle microvascular density (sidestream dark field videomicroscopy). Results: At 1 hour, arterial O2 tension was 103\u00b119 mmHg in normoxia, 296\u00b160 mmHg in hyperoxia, 62\u00b18 mmHg in mild hypoxia (p<0.001). Hyperoxia induced an increase in MAP (from 109\u00b113 to 129\u00b18 mmHg at 1h, p<0.05) and a decrease in SVI (from 0.67\u00b10.1 to 0.59\u00b10.1 ml/kg at 1h, p<0.05), while in mild hypoxia MAP tended to decrease and SVI tended to increase (p>0.05). Microvascular density decreased in hyperoxia and increased in mild hypoxia (Fig. 1) . Conclusions: In anesthetized rats, microvascular density decreased with hyperoxia and increased with mild hypoxia. Introduction: The imbalance between oxygen (O2) delivery and O2 requirement in patients with sepsis can be assessed by central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). The low or high ScvO2 may indicate cellular hypoxia or inability to utilize the O2. This study aims to determine the relationship between high ScvO2 and mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was done by collecting data (i.e., baseline characteristics, severity of infection and vasopressors) from medical records of >=15-year-old patients with sepsis and 1st ScvO2 measurement within 24 hours of sepsis, who were admitted in a university hospital between 2013 and 2014. The patients were stratified by 1st ScvO2 level (<70%, 70-80%, >80%) and APACHE-II score (<=25, >25). The primary outcome was inhospital mortality.",

            "text": "Results: Among 376 patients, those with high ScvO2 (17.3%) and low ScvO2 (53.7%) were associated with adjusted hazard ratios for death of 0.79 (0.54-1.15, p=0.218) and 1.16 (0.86-1.56, p=0.325), respectively, while those with normal ScvO2 (29.0%) as control. When the patients were stratified by ScvO2 level and APACHE-II score, using patients with normal ScvO2 and low APACHE-II score as control, those with high ScvO2 and low APACHE-II score, and those with low ScvO2 and low APACHE-II score had adjusted hazard ratios of 0.54 (0.31-0.97, p=0.038) and 1.18 (0.79-1.76, p=0.432). For those with normal, high and low ScvO2, and high APACHE-II score had adjusted hazard ratios of 1.62 (1.02-2.57, p=0.041), 1.77 (1.05-2.96, p=0.031), and 1.88 (1.23-2.87, p=0.004), respectively. Conclusions: The ScvO2 >80% with APACHE-II score >25, but not only ScvO2 >80%, is independently related to increased mortality in patients with sepsis. Introduction: Serum lactic acid levels and ScvO2 are useful predictive parameters for patients with sepsis. However, little is known the differences in the impact of lactate levels and ScvO2 on the prognosis of septic patients. In this study, we investigated these differences by analysing septic patients' characteristics and prognosis. Methods: This study is a post hoc analysis of data obtained from a multicentre, prospective, randomized controlled trial, which compared two fluid management strategies for septic patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We categorised patients into the following four groups: ScvO2 >= 70% and lactic acid levels < 2 mmol/L (HH group); ScvO2 >= 70% and lactic acid levels < 2 mmol/L (HL group); ScvO2 < 70% and lactic acid levels >= 2 mmol/L (LH group) and ScvO2 < 70% and lactic acid levels < 2 mmol/L (LL group). SOFA score, SAPS II score, lactic acid levels, ScvO2 and BNP were evaluated. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality, whereas secondary outcomes were the duration of mechanical ventilation, administration of CRRT, duration of catecholamine therapy and length of ICU stay. Results: In total, 104 patients were included: HH group (n = 32), HL group (n = 31), LH group (n = 25) and LL group (n = 16). No significant differences were observed in terms of patient characteristics. Further, 28-day mortality was 32% in the LH group, 28.1% in the HH group, 25% in the LL group and 13% in the HL group, and there was no significant difference in terms of mortality among the groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in terms of secondary outcomes. On multivariate analysis using the HL group as reference, the odds ratios for 28-day mortality in the LH, HH and LL groups were 1.21 (95%CI, 0.5-5.8), 1.62 (95%CI, 0.36-7.2) and 2.0 (95%CI, 0.37-10.9), respectively. Conclusions: Because 28-day mortality was higher in the HH group than in the LL group, serum lactic acid levels may have bigger impact on the prognosis of septic patients. Introduction: In septic shock endothelial damage can lead to failure of microcirculation and low microcirculatory oxygen saturation. In the skin this is seen as mottling and can be quantified using hyper Fig. 1 (abstract P262) . Changes in microvascular density spectral imaging. There is insufficient data about associations between skin oxygenation, severity of illness, biomarkers of endothelial damage and mortality in patients with septic shock. Methods: This single centre observational study was performed in 24 consecutive intensive care patients with septic shock. Within 24 hours of admission hyper spectral imaging of knee area skin was performed and blood was sampled for assay of biomarkers of endothelial cell damage (plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), thrombomodulin, angiopoetin-2). Nonlinear fitting of optical density spectra was used to calculate relative skin oxy/deoxy hemoglobin concentration and obtain oxygen saturation. The association between skin oxygen saturation, biomarkers, sepsis severity (APACHE II, SOFA) and 28-day mortality was analyzed. Results: The median (IQR) age of patients was 71 years (62 to 76), and 60% were males. The median SOFA and APACHE II scores were 9 (7 to 12) and 24 (19 to 27) and 28-day mortality rate was 29%. 7 patients (37%) had mottling. There was a relationship between skin oxygenation, plasma biomarkers (thrombomodulin and sVCAM-1) and sepsis severity assessed by SOFA and APACHE II scores, P < 0.05. Using logistic regression analysis, skin oxygenation and biomarker concentrations were not associated with 28-day mortality rate. Conclusions: In our cohort of patients with septic shock, skin oxygenation and biomarkers of endothelial injury were strongly associated with initial severity of sepsis but poorly predictive of 28-day mortality.",

Previous meta-analyses included both adult and pediatric patients and long axis in-plane technique and short axis out of plane technique in the same analysis, which may have incurred biases [1, 2] . Methods: PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched (from 1946 to 20th November 2017) to identify prospective randomized controlled trials in adult patients where 2dimensional ultrasound guided radial artery catheterization has been compared with digital palpation guided technique. For continuous variables, a mean difference was computed at the study level, and a weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) was computed in order to pool the results across all studies. For binary outcomes, the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated using the inverse variance method. Results: Data of 1895 patients from 10 studies have been included in this meta-analysis. Overall cannulation success rate was similar between short axis out of plane technique and digital palpation [p=0.27; Fig. 1 ] and long axis in-plane technique with digital palpation. Ultrasound guided long axis in-plane approach and short axis out of plane approach provides better first attempt success rate of radial artery cannulation in comparison to digital palpation [p=0.01 and p=0.0002 respectively; Fig.  2 ]. No difference was seen in time to cannulate between long axis and short axis technique with palpation technique. Conclusions: USG guided radial artery cannulation may increase the first attempt success rate but not the over all cannulation success when compared to digital palpation technique. Introduction: Ultrasound guidance may improve the success rate of vascular cannulation. There is lack of data regarding the utility of USG guided arterial cannulation in critically ill patients in shock. We aim to compare the impact of using real time ultrasound guidance versus palpation method in achieving arterial catheterization in critically ill patients in hypotension. Methods: A single center, prospective, randomized trial was performed among 100 critically ill patients aged >18 years, with hypotension (or requiring vasopressor infusion) and on not previous cannulated radial arteries. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to the ultrasound group or palpation group. Under aseptic precautions, arterial puncture was performed using appropriate sized Leader Cath (Vygon, Ecquen, France), under real time USG guidance using short-axis out-of-plane view with bevel down. Data were recorded and compared between two groups. The unpaired Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used for continuous variables, and the uncorrected Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test were used for proportions. Results: A total of 100 patients with hypotensive shock requiring radial artery catheterization were randomized into palpation (n = 51) and ultrasound (n = 49) groups. First pass success rate was significantly higher in ultrasound group as compared to palpation group (83% vs 41%, p<0.0001). Cannulation time was significantly shorter in ultrasound group (72.9 vs 88.7,p<0.05). Early complications were significantly higher in palpation group compared to ultrasound group (14.6% vs 5.2%, p<0.001). Conclusions: In critically ill patients with hypotension (or requiring vasopressors), ultrasound guidance improved first pass success rate, shortened the cannulation time and reduced the rate of early complications in radial artery catheterizations.",

            "text": "Introduction: There is no consensus on the use of vena cava inferior (IVC) diameter and variability in the assessment of fluid response (FR) in spontaneously breathing ICU patients. Influence from respiratory effort, experience requirement and measurement problems are reasons for not being preferred. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between IVC diameter, variability and spontaneous breathing effort and hypotension measured by ultrasonography in spontaneously breathing intensive care patients Methods: The maximum and minimum diameters of the IVC were measured and the collapsibility index (CI) was calculated. Measurements were made in 2D mode on cineloop recordings. Diaphragm thickening ratio was used as a measure of respiratory effort. Correlations between respiratory effort criteria with IVC minimum diameter and CI were calculated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. IVC measurement criterias, such as inspiratory diameter of < 1 cm, 25%, 40%, 45% of the CI were compared with Chi square test in hypotensive and non-hypotensive patients. We took two mean arterial pressure threshold for hypotension as 60 and 70 mmHg for this calculation. Results: 62 patients were included in the study. For both hypotensive threshold values, there was no significant difference in the rates of hypotensive and non-hypotensive patients with and without a minimum IVC diameter of 1 cm below. Even there was no significant relationship between the CI higher than 25%, 40% and 50% and hypotension (p>0.05). In spontaneously breathing patients, a significant correlation was found between respiratory effort and IVC CI and IVC diameter < 1 cm Conclusions: At the end of the study, there was a correlation between spontaneous breathing effort IVC diameter and CI in the intubed patients. Additionally the result that IVC CI is not different even between hypotensive and non-hypotensive patients suggests that this method should be used with caution in predicting FR. Introduction: Fluid responsiveness in ICU patients can be assessed using changes in pulse rate and blood pressure following administration of a fluid bolus, assisted if necessary by cardiac output (CO) monitors such as the LiDCOplus. This uses pulse contour analysis to estimate stroke volume (SV), with >10% change in SV following a fluid challenge (FC) signifying overall benefit. There is no evidence that the use of CO monitoring improves patient outcomes and it is unclear if it improves clinical decision making. Methods: A LiDCOplus monitor was set up with the screen covered. A 250ml FC was administered over 2 minutes. The heart rate, systolic and mean arterial pressures were recorded before and after the FC. The clinician administering the FC was asked to decide if the patient was fluid responsive. Following this decision, the SV change was revealed and the clinician asked again to assess fluid responsiveness. Results: Forty-five fluid challenges were studied. Use of the LiDCO changed the decision made on 7 occasions (Fig. 1) . In three patients (7%), this change in decision was appropriate and either corrected a misinterpretation of the haemodynamic data or represented a patient whose only marker of fluid responsiveness was a SV change. In four patients (9%), the LiDCO changed the decision inappropriately from a correct interpretation of the haemodynamic data. In six patients (13%) the SV change was ignored when it should have changed the initial decision. In the remaining 32 patients (71%) the decision made with the haemodynamic data was in agreement with the SV change and unchanged by revealing the LiDCO data. Conclusions: The use of LiDCO monitoring only appropriately changed the decision made with information from basic haemodynamic monitoring in 7% of patients. This augmentation of decision making was only seen in patients whose basic haemodynamic parameters did not respond to fluid. It changed a correct decision inappropriately in 9%. Overall, no improvement in the assessment of fluid responsiveness was seen. Introduction: There are accumulating evidences suggesting that intraoperative blood pressure affects postoperative outcome including myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, stroke, and mortality. In a patient undergoing laryngeal microsurgery (LMS), blood pressure usually rises sharply due to the stimulation on the larynx. Since pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported to reflect arterial blood pressure fairly well, it has possibility to be a marker for blood pressure which reflects beat-to-beat changes in blood pressure and is less invasive than arterial catheterization. Methods: Intraoperative noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), electrocardiogram (ECG), and photoplethysmogram (PPG) of 26 patients undergoing LMS were recorded simultaneously. PTT was defined as a time interval between the R-wave peak on ECG and the point which the maximal rising slope appears on the PPG. The mean PTT values for one minute before and after the increase in blood pressure due to the stimulation on larynx were compared. Parameters of PPG such as width, height, maximal slope, minimal slope, and area were also compared. Then, correlation between blood pressure and each variable was calculated. Results: As the larynx was stimulated by LMS, NIBPs have surged (systolic blood pressure, 113. 6 P<0 .001) significantly in most of the patients. Systolic blood pressure and PTT were inversely correlated (r = -0.636, P < 0.001). Minimum slope of PPG also showed good negative correlation with systolic blood pressure (r = -0.537, P < 0.001).",

Introduction: Aim of this prospective randomized pilot study was to investigate influence of intra operative restrictive volume approach and post operative lung ultrasound (LUS)on prevention and early detection of postoperative interstitial syndrome development Methods: 42 cardiac patients who underwent non cardiac surgical procedure were randomly assigned for: group A-liberal volume approach or for group B-combination of restrictive intra operative volume approach and small dose of norepinephrine. All patients post operatively received <=1.5 ml/kg/h fluids, mostly crystalloids. LUS was performed before surgical procedure and 24 hours after their admission in ICU together with arterial blood gases measurements. The ultrasound characteristic of interstitial syndrome was development of B profile Results: Before surgery all patients had A profile. Twenty for hours later in A group significantly higher number of patients 16/22 (72.7%) vs 3/22(13.6%) in B group,had B profile (p<0.05).At the same time there were no significant difference between the groups in amount of patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <= 270 (3 patients with positive B lines from A group vs 0 patients from group B).(p>0.05) Conclusions: Intra operative fluid restriction is efficient in prevention of post operative cardiogenic pulmonary edema development. LUS is a simple non invasive method for early detection of interstitial syndrome even before development of signs of respiratory deterioration. Introduction: The peak rate of left ventricular (LV) pressure (dP/dtmax) has been classically used as a marker of LV systolic function. Since measuring LV dP/dtmax requires LV catheterization, other surrogates have been proposed using the peripheral arterial waveform. The aim of this study was to test the performance of LV and arterial (aortic and femoral) dP/dtmax for assessing LV systolic function against the gold-standard (the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, Emax) during different cardiac loading and contractile conditions. Methods: Experimental study in 6 pigs. LV pressure-volume data was obtained with a conductance catheter and peripheral pressures were measured via a fluid-filled catheter into the aortic, femoral, and radial arteries. Emax was calculated during a transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava. The experimental protocol consisted in three consecutive stages with two opposite interventions each: changes in afterload (phenylephrine and nitroprusside), preload (bleeding and fluid bolus), and contractility (esmolol and dobutamine) (Fig. 1) . Measurements were obtained before and after each hemodynamic intervention. Results: Emax variations and LV, aortic, femoral and radial dP/dtmax changes throughout the study are shown in Fig. 2 . All peripheral artery-derived dP/dtmax underestimated LV dP/dtmax. Percentage changes in LV and femoral ddP/dtmax were tightly correlated (r 2 =0.77; P<0.02). Both LV and femoral dP/dtmax were affected by preload changes during fluid infusion. All peripheral dP/dtmax estimations allow to detect LV systolic function changes according to Emax during isolated variations in contractility. Conclusions: Femoral and LV dP/dtmax accurately reflected Emax changes, although both were affected by preload changes during fluid administration. Fig. 2 (abstract P272) . Emax, LV dP/dtmax and aortic, femoral and radial dP/dtmax changes. (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). Concordance was <95% and radial LOA was \u00b1<30\u00b0for all devices; mean polar bias was <5\u00b0for FT only (table 2, Fig. 2) . Conclusions: CS, FT and PA are not interchangeable with TPTD, because of inaccuracy [2] . When considering limitations they may be used for trending. Introduction: About 100 years ago, the German physiologist Pfl\u00fcger stated that the cardio-respiratory system fulfils its physiological task by guaranteeing cellular oxygen supply and removing waste products of cellular metabolism. Methods: The study was performed in early postoperative period after major abdominal surgery in 160 patients. The physical condition of patients corresponded to 3 class of ASA. The median age was 46.0 (38.0-62.0) years. Duration of the surgery was 6,4 (4,8-9,5) hours. Surgery was performed under combined epidural anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The study was conducted in the following stages: 1-admission from operating room; 2 -in 1-3 hours; 3 -4-7 hours; 4 -8-12 hours; 5 -after 13-24 hours after the surgery. Results: Depend on rate of oxygen extraction index (ERO2) 4 groups were revealed: group 1 (n=44)low ERO2 (<21%) followed by recovery to normal levels to stage 2-3 (ERO2 = 22-32%), group 2 (n=42)normal level ERO2 (2232%) in all the stages, group 3 (n=40)high levels ERO2 (>33%) with recovery to normal levels to stage 2, group 4 (n=34)high ERO2 (>35%) in all the stages. Oxygen extraction index at admission to ICU after surgery can be normal (26.25% of patients), reduced (27.5% of patients) or high (46.25% of patients). When oxygen extraction ratio is reduced metabolic recovery occurs classically after 4-7 hours; when ERO2 is elevated -after 812 hours. Core temperature improvement is connected with the restoration of oxygen homeostasis. So, under normal and reduced ERO2 even mild central hypothermia after surgery were not observed, and at an elevated ERO2 moderate hypothermia after surgery was observed with only to 4-7 hours post-surgery restoration.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Cerebral oxygen desaturation below 50% was significantly associated with outcome in patients undergoing vaECMO. In patients with cSO2<50%time above 50h%, prognosis was especially poor. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate if cSO2 is a viable target for therapeutic interventions. Introduction: During the second consensus meeting on microcirculatory analysis the exploration of novel parameters related to physiological function of the microcirculation was proposed. Capillary hematocrit (cHct) is a direct measure of capillary hemodilution, a potential mechanism of microcirculatory dysfunction in states of shock. Our hypothesis was that by application of advanced computer vision (I) cHct can be reliably measured in given capillaries, and (II) change in cHct reflects capillary hemodilution induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods: In 11 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery 3 sublingual capillary microscopy videos were recorded before and during CPB primed with HES 130/0.4. Per-capillary cHct was estimated as the product of the number of red blood cells (RBC) and an assumed volume of 90nl, divided by the capillary volume including plasma gaps. RBC number was assessed by manual counting in the first frame of a given video clip, as well as using a novel advanced computer vision algorithm employing blob detection to calculate the mean per-capillary RBC number in all frames of a given video clip (Fig. 1) . Results: 100 capillaries were analyzed, within a total of 100 and 322000 frames using manual and algorithmic analysis. A good correlation was found between both methods for cHct (r=0.79, p<0.01, Fig. 2 ). CPB initiation resulted in an decrease in cHct from (mean\u00b1SEM) 0.23\u00b10.02 to 0.18\u00b10.01, p<0.001 and 0.23\u00b10.02 to 0.18\u00b10.01, p=0.05 in manual and algorithm. Conclusions: Accurate measurement of cHct is possible using advanced computer vision, and it reflects hemodilution induced by initiation of CPB. cHct further is a determinant of capillary delivery of oxygen. Combined with the assessment of functional capillary volume, blood flow velocity, and capillary hemoglobin saturation, cHct may enable direct optical quantification of capillary delivery of oxygen as an integrated functional parameter of the microcirculation.

The area under cSO2<50% was significantly lower in survivors Introduction: Cardiac function is known to be impacted by sepsis. Passive Leg Raise (PLR) is an effective method to predict fluid responsiveness (FR) or cardiac response to preload expansion. Preload functional status and trending cardiac output may identify patient phenotypes with varying cardiac reserve, dysfunction and outcome. Methods: Patient data were analyzed from a currently enrolling prospective randomized controlled study, evaluating the incidence of FR in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock (FRESH study, NCT02837731). Patients randomized to PLR guided resuscitation were classified as PLR+ (fluid responsive/preload dependent) if stroke volume (SV) increased >= 10% when measured with a non-invasive bioreactance device (Starling SV, Cheetah Medical). Patients were categorized into 5 different phenotypic cohorts based on changing physiology exhibited on PLR and trending cardiac output over the initial 72 hours of therapy. Results: A total of 269 PLR assessments were performed in 31 patients. Overall, 36% (96/269) of assessments indicated a patient was PLR+ after receiving initial resuscitation fluid of~3L. Most patients (71%) demonstrated a dynamic physiology with changing PLR Status occurring > 1 time over 72 hours. There were no differences among the 5 groups with respect to age, gender, or QSOFA score (Fig. 1) . Patients in Group 1 exhibited a significantly decreased ICU stay (113.8 hours) compared to Group 3 (271.1 hours, p=0.024) (Fig. 2) . Patients in Group 3 exhibited significantly increased ECHO evidence of LV/RV cardiac dysfunction (77%), compared to Group 1 (16%, p=0.02) ( Table 1) . Patients in Group 4 exhibited 100% evidence of ECHO based LV/RV cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions: Physiological based resuscitation phenotypes identify significantly different patient groups. Patients who are initially not PLR+, but then become PLR+ with no improved CO are significantly more likely to have confirmed LV/RV dysfunction and a significantly longer ICU stay. Introduction: Accurate measurement of a patient's intravascular volume status remains an unsolved clinical problem in the ICU setting. In particular, septic and cardio-renal patients often receive volume challenges or diuresis, respectively, with little appreciation of baseline BV or the resulting response. This can lead to volume overload and/or depletion and associated increases in morbidity, mortality and hospital length of stay. Methods: We tested the performance of a novel, rapid, minimally invasive technique capable of measuring PV, BV and glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) in 32 human subjects. The method consists of a single IV injection of a large (150 kDa) carboxymethyl dextran conjugated to a rhodamine-derived dye and a small (5 kDa) carboxymethyl dextran conjugated to fluorescein. Plasma and blood volumes were quantified 15 minutes following the injection of the dye based on the indicatordilution principle. Results: This phase 2b study included 16 normal subjects, 8 chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III and 8 CKD stage IV subjects. PV and BV varied according to weight and body surface area, with PV ranging from 2115 to 6234 mls, and both were stable for greater than six hours with repeated measurements. There was excellent agreement ( Fig. 1) with Nadler's formula for PV in normal subjects. A 24 hour repeat dose measurement in 8 healthy subjects showed PV variability of less than +/-5%. Following an intravenous bolus of 350 ml 5% albumin solution the mean +/-(SD) measured increase in PV was 326.8 ml +/-49.9 ml post infusion (Fig. 2) .",

This approach should assist the Intensivist especially with volume administration and removal in septic and cardiorenal patients. Introduction: Accumulating evidence shows that fluid overload is independently associated with adverse outcome in children and adults with acute lung injury. Fluid restriction initiated early in the disease process may prove beneficial, potentially by diminishing the formation of interstitial edema. The main goal of this study was to determine the short-term biophysical effects of intravenous (IV) fluid restriction during acute lung injury in relation to age. Methods: Infant (2-3 weeks) and adult (3-4 months) Wistar rats were mechanically ventilated (MV) 24 hours after intratracheal inoculation with lipopolysaccharide to model acute lung injury. Both age groups were randomized to either a normal or restrictive IV fluid regimen during 6 hours of MV. Thereafter the rats were sacrificed and studied for markers of interstitial edema formation (wet-dry weight ratios), lung permeability (total protein and alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) in bronchoalveolar lavage; BAL) and local inflammation (cell counts and cytokines in BAL). Results: Restrictive fluid therapy was not associated with worsening of hemodynamic indices during the period of MV in either infant or adult rats. However, as compared to the normal fluid regimen, restrictive fluid therapy led to lower wet-dry weight ratios of the lungs and kidneys in adult rats (p < 0.05), but not in infants (Figs. 1 and 2). No difference was found in total protein and A2M in BAL between the two fluid regimens in both age groups. Also, neutrophil influx in the lungs did not differ between fluid regimens in both age categories, nor did the influx of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MIP-2 in BAL fluid. Conclusions: There is an age-dependent effect of early fluid restriction on the formation of interstitial edema in local and distant organs in the disease process of acute lung injury. Further investigation of the effects of fluid therapies in experimental models may help steering towards better treatment in critically ill patients. . 1) .

Consequently, we developed a protocol to guide fluid resuscitation. The protocol was introduced in 2011 and mandates that fluid responsiveness is assessed when administering fluid boluses. Once a patient becomes fluid unresponsive, no further resuscitation fluid should be administered. To assess responsiveness, the protocol advises the use of haemodynamic data such as heart rate and blood pressure as well as the change in stroke volume (SV) measured by a LiDCOplus monitor. After years of use and a rolling education program this protocol was felt to be well ingrained in our unit culture. We then assessed how well it was being followed. Methods: Staff performing fluid challenges were asked to fill out a form recording the haemodynamic and SV data measured before and after a fluid challenge. They were also asked to record their interpretation of just the haemodynamic data and then this data combined with the SV data.",

Introduction: Understanding the effects of therapeutics on the left ventricular (LV) loading conditions is of utmost importance in critically ill patients.

In this study after the 4th day the nutritional support, it was responsible for more than 25% of the total volume that was delivered to the patient and with an higher impact with the increase in LOS Results: We included 64 patients with mean age 65 years, 53% male, APACHE 28 \u00b1 7, SAPS II 56 \u00b1 20, SOFA in admission 8 \u00b1 3, mechanical ventilation 76%, continuous renal replacement techniques 38%. The mean total volume administered during the first 7 days was 26 \u00b1 8L with a mean DCB of 16 \u00b1 8L and a mean fluid accumulation of 21% \u00b1 13. Regarding Fluid accumulation: 17% have <10%, 35% between 10-20% and 47.5% > 20%. 28th-day mortality and ICU mortality were 17% i 28% respectively. During the first week, the percentage of fluid accumulation was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (28.5 \u00b1 10.7 L vs. 18.7 \u00b1 13.1 L, p 0.046) (Fig. 1) . Cumulative survival was significantly lower (logRank = 6.05, p=0.01) in patients with >20% of volume gain since the 6th day (Fig. 2) . >20% volume gain in the 6th day is a independently associated variable to mortality after adjusting by age, APACHE and haemodialysis (OR = 7.3; CI 95% 1.2-43.9; p = 0.02) ( Table 2) . Conclusions: In septic shock patients, Fluid overload more than 20% since 6-day of evolution is associated with a higher 28th-day mortality. Its early detection may influence the prognosis and survival. Introduction: Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a deregulated host response to infection [1] . Fluid infusion is one of the cornerstones of sepsis resuscitation therapies. One of the major adverse effects reported is fluid overload (FO). The objective of this study was to assess influence of FO on SOFA score changes from day 0 to day 5. Methods: This study is a retrospective, multicenter, epidemiologic data analysis. It was performed in three French ICUs. All adult patients admitted for septic shock, caused by peritonitis or pneumonia and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled. Delta SOFA score was defined as the SOFA score measured on admission minus SOFA score measured on day 5. Results: 129 patients met the inclusion criteria of the study. FO occurs in about 40% of the patients. Cumulative fluid balance at day 5 was greater in the FO group (2.738 versus 8.715 ml, p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . Delta SOFA score was higher in the no FO group than in the FO group (4.52 versus 2.15, p = 0.001) (Fig. 1 ). There was a stepwise decrease of delta SOFA score when duration of fluid overload was greater (p = 0.001) (Fig. 2) . In linear modelling, association between FO status and delta SOFA score was confirmed with an adjusted RR of 0.15 [0.03-0.63] (p = 0.009) ( Table 2) . Conclusions: 1) FO patients had more prolonged multi-organ failure during septic shock; 2) The longer the FO is the longer the more multi-organ failure last. , 100 (T120) and 160 (T180) minutes later.

In 560 patients, priming solution consisted of 1250 ml balanced crystalloids, 250 ml mannitol 15%, tranexamic acid 2g and 500 I.E. heparin. For the other 560 patients, 500 ml of the crystalloids were replaced with HES 6% (130/ 0.4), the other components were the same. Patients were matched 1:1 with propensity score method. The primary endpoint was intraoperative fluid balance. Secondary endpoints were perioperative blood loss, transfusion requirement and the occurrence of acute kidney injury. Results: In total, 866 patients were analyzed. The HES group showed less positive fluid balance than the crystalloid group (p< 0.001). There was no difference in intraoperative blood loss (p=0.426) and transfusion requirement (p=0.442). The occurrence of acute kidney injury was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0,147). Conclusions: Low-dose administration of 5-10 ml/kg HES 6% (130/ 0.4) to CPB pump priming decreased intraoperative fluid accumulation without increasing perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirement. There was no effect on the incidence of acute kidney injury. Priming CPB pumps with a low-dose of HES 6% (130/ 0.4) is an important component for a restrictive volume strategy and might safely be used in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Introduction: Most crystalloid solutions used in critically ill patients have a greater chloride (Cl) concentration than plasma, which may be detrimental. Replacing some Cl with bicarbonate (HC03) reduces Cl, but may increase partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PC02) in blood. Such an increase in PC02 may be harmful [1] . The main objective was to determine if a HCO3 balanced fluid resulted in increased PaCO2 compared to a conventional balanced fluid. Methods: Single center randomized controlled trial in an adult ICU, comparing balanced fluid (sodium,Na=142mmol/l, Chloride,Cl=99mmol/l, HCO3=49mmol/l) vs conventional fluid (Na=130mmol/l, Cl=110mmol/l, HC03<=27mmol/l). University ethics committee approval:M080932. We used the absolute difference between the PCO2 and 40mmHg as a comparison for the 2 fluid groups.

Conclusions: We found that when hemodynamic management is guided by a multimodal assessment and stability is maintained, there was no difference between crystalloids and colloids in macrocirculation and microcirculatory perfusion. Introduction: Our aim is to evaluate the impact of crystalloid fluids on immune cells. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients' inflammatory status can switch from an early pro-inflammatory to a late anti-inflammatory phase, which favors infections. They can receive different crystalloids, either Normal Saline (NS), Ringer's Lactate (RL) or Plasma-Lyte (PL). High chloride concentration present in NS has been associated with various complications [1] , whereas high doses of NaCl have inflammatory effects on immune cells [2] . However, the immune consequences of crystalloids in humans are ill-defined. Methods: Using our comprehensive immunemonitoring platform, we assessed the immunological phenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in humans. 11 healthy subjects received a liter of NS, RL and PL. Blood samples were taken before and 6h later. PBMC phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry and cytokine concentrations were measured by a multiplex assay. 9 off-pump cardiac surgery patients were also randomized to receive either NS, RL or PL during surgery and their stay in the ICU. Blood samples were drawn at various time-points. All leucocytes were analyzed in a similar fashion. We are still recruiting. Results: Study of healthy subject's PBMC suggested that RL reduced classical monocytes, whereas NS increased lymphocyte activation and IL-17 and MIP-1b levels. In cardiac surgery patients, our preliminary results suggested that RL and PL reduced classical monocytes and increased non-classical monocytes compared to NS. Neutrophils were also affected differently by crystalloids, where NS seemed to activate them more. Conclusions: Our results suggest that crystalloids have different immune consequences. A better understanding of their immune modulation will lead to personalization of their use according to the inflammatory status of patients to restore their immune homeostasis. ",

Patients received either a single bolus of 10mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl (isotonic group) or 5mL/kg of 3% NaCl (hypertonic group). Blood biomarker concentrations of glycocalyx shedding (syndecan-1, hyaluronan), endothelial activation (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1) and inflammation (interleukin-6, -8, -10, NGAL, resistin) were measured at T0 (before fluid) and 1 hour (T1), 3 hours (T3) and 12-24 hours (T24) later. Changes in biomarker concentrations were compared between study groups using mixed regression models, with fold-change from T0 reported. Differences in fluid volumes were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results: Syndecan-1 concentration in the isotonic group decreased from T0 to T1 (fold-change 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9), which was significantly different to the hypertonic group (fold-change 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.1)(P=0.012)( Table 1) . Interleukin-10 concentration decreased in the isotonic group from T0 to T24 (fold-change 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.3), which was significantly different to the hypertonic group (fold-change 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-2.6)(P=0.006). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in change over time between groups for measured biomarkers. Total fluid volume administered between T0 and T1 was significantly higher in the isotonic group (P<0.001) ( Fig. 1) but not different for subsequent time periods. Conclusions: Biomarkers of glycocalyx shedding, endothelial activation and inflammation were not different between patients receiving either 0.9% or 3% saline. Also, 3% NaCl did not reduce administration of additional fluids. Introduction: Acute changes in PCO2 are buffered by non-carbonic weak acids (ATOT), i.e., albumin, phosphates and hemoglobin. Aim of the study was to describe acid-base variations induced by in-vitro PCO2 changes in critically ill patients' blood and isolated plasma, compare them with healthy controls and quantify the contribution of different buffers.",

Introduction: There is an increasing trend in the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in Hong Kong and the disease carries high morbidity and mortality rate. Electrolyte disturbance is one of the known complications of SAH and the outcomes associated with this are not fully understood. The objective of this retrospective local study is to evaluate the pattern of electrolyte disturbances in patients with SAH and their impact on the prognostic functional outcome. Methods: Patients with spontaneous aneurysmal SAH who were admitted to ICU at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong between 1st January 2011 and 31st December 2016 were included into this retrospective local study. Collected data include demographic details, comorbidities, serum electrolyte levels (sodium and potassium) from day 1 to 11 of admission into ICU, radiographic intensity of haemorrhage using Fisher scale and the clinical grading of SAH using WFNS. Prognosis of these patients was estimated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months after initial insult (Fig. 1) .",

In contrast, our study suggests that hypernatraemia (as defined) is not associated with the length of stay, however this result is limited by the unbalanced design of this small study. Introduction: Our aim is to determine whether auscultation for bowel sounds helps in clinical decision making in ICU patients with ileus. Ileus can be the consequence of an operation, a side effect of drugs or the result of an obstruction requiring direct operative correction. Although auscultation for bowel sounds is routinely performed in the ICU and a well-established part of the physical examination in patients with suspected ileus, its clinical value remains largely unstudied. Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane was performed to study the diagnostic value of auscultation for bowel sounds. Results: Auditory characteristics (tinkling, high pitched and rushes) were highly variable in postoperative ileus, mechanical ileus and healthy volunteers. The inter-observer variability for the assessment of the quantity, volume and pitch of bowel sounds was high, with a moderate interobserver agreement for discerning postoperative ileus, bowel obstruction and normal bowel sounds (kappa value 0.57). The intra-observer reliability of duplicated recordings for distinguishing between patients with normal bowels, obstructed bowels or postoperative ileus was 54% [1] . No clear relation between bowel sounds and intestinal transit was found (Table 1) . Sensitivity and positive predictive value were low: respectively 32% and 23% in healthy volunteers, 22% and 28% in obstructive ileus, and 22% and 44% in postoperative ileus ( Table 2) . Conclusions: Auscultation with the aim to differentiate normal from pathological bowel sounds is not useful in clinical practice. The low sensitivity and low positive predictive value together with a poor inter-and intra-observer agreement demonstrate the inaccuracy of utilizing bowel sounds for clinical decision-making. Given the lack of evidence and standardization of auscultation, the critically ill patient is more likely to benefit from abdominal imaging. Introduction: Stress ulcer prophylaxis has become a standard of care in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). However, it has been proposed that enteral nutrition (EN) could play preventive role for gastrointestinal bleeding and some studies revealed no added benefit of acid suppressive drugs to patients on EN. Based on these backgrounds, we use proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as stress ulcer prophylaxis during starvation period, and discontinue it within 24 hours after commencing meals or EN. The aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability of our protocol by reviewing the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in our ICU. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study. All consecutive patients admitted to our ICU between April 2016 and March 2017 were reviewed. Patients who had UGIB within 24 hours after admission, had previous total gastrectomy, or underwent upper gastrointestinal surgery were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of overt or clinically important UGIB, and the secondary outcome was protocol adherence. We presented descriptive data as number (percentage) and median (interquartile range). Results: A total of 521 patients were included. Of those, 315 (60.5%) were male, median age was 73 (57-81), and median SOFA score was 5 (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Of all 521 patients, 16 (3.37%) had overt bleeding, and 2 (0.38%) had clinically important bleeding. Both 2 patients who Introduction: Patients requiring operative procedures admitted under non-surgical specialties typically experience delays in treatment and fail to meet peri-operative standards with regards to the timing of operative intervention. Patients admitted from medicine requiring an emergency laparotomy have an increased mortality when compared to those patients admitted from surgery (20.4% v 13.6%) [1] . Methods: We undertook a retrospective case note review of patients requiring a non-elective laparotomy at our hospital during a sixmonth period in 2016. Patients were identified using the emergency theatre booking system. Data were gathered on admission details, peri-operative care and post-operative stay.",

Most patients (59.1%) were admitted through the Emergency Department; 17 (29.3%) of whom were initially admitted under medicine, with only 37.5% of these reviewed by a senior clinician prior to admission (Table 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between the medicine and surgery groups. There was a trend to increased length of stay in ICU and in hospital in the medical group (Table 2) . Conclusions: Lack of senior decision making may have a direct impact on patient care due to the inappropriate streaming of patients to medicine. The increased mean length of stay in those patients admitted to medicine may reflect a delay in surgical intervention and therefore a prolonged recovery period. We are introducing an Acute Abdominal Pain Screening and Immediate Action Tool to improve identification of these high-risk patients and early involvement of senior decision makers. Introduction: Biomarkers reflecting the extent of surgical tissue trauma should be investigated in an effort to predict and prevent postoperative complications. The aim of the present study was to investigate blood concentrations of selected alarmins in patients after colorectal surgery in comparison to healthy individuals. The secondary aim was to analyze the relationship between alarmins and inflammatory biomarkers during early postoperative period. Methods: The prospective, single-center, observational study consisted of non-surgical (NS) group (n=35) and surgical (S) group (n=38) undergoing colorectal surgery. Serum levels of selected alarmins (S100A8 and S100A12) and inflammatory biomarkers (leukocytes; C-reactive protein, CRP; interleukin-6, IL-6) were analyzed. Results: Proteins S100A8 an S100A12 had significantly higher serum values in the S-group during all three days after the surgery. The multidimensional model taking into account age, sex, weight, group and days revealed significant differences between study groups for both proteins S100A8 and S100A12 (p<0.001, p=0.001, respectively). Biomarkers (leukocytes, CRP, and IL-6) showed significant differences between study subgroups (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). In S-group, moderate positive correlations were found between S100A8 and all biomarkers: leukocytes (r=0.6), CRP (r=0.5), and IL-6 (r=0.6). S100A12 had moderate positive correlation with leukocytes (r=0.5). Levels of S100A8 also positively correlated with intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (r=0.6, r=0.5, respectively) Conclusions: Protein S100A8 might be considered as early biomarker of first wave of immune activation elicited by surgical injury after colorectal surgery. The increase of the alarmins is reflected by the elevation of routine inflammatory biomarkers. Introduction: Critical illness-induced liver test abnormalities are associated with complications and death in adult ICU patients, but remain poorly characterized in the pediatric ICU (PICU). In the PEPaNIC RCT, delaying initiation of parenteral nutrition to beyond day 7 (late PN) was clinically superior to providing PN within 24h (early PN), but resulted in a higher rise in bilirubin. We aimed to document prevalence and prognostic value of abnormal liver tests and the impact of withholding early PN in the PICU. Methods: We performed a preplanned secondary analysis of 1231 of the 1440 PEPaNIC patients aged 28 days to 17 years, as neonatal jaundice was considered a confounder. Plasma concentrations of total bilirubin, ALT, AST, \u03b3 GT, ALP were measured systematically during PICU stay. Analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics including severity of illness.",

In this study, we tracked how psoas muscle area changes at multiple levels, in a group of patients with acute severe pancreatitis. Methods: Paired computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained from 21 patients admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's ICU with acute severe pancreatitis. The first scan was within 3 days of admission, and the second took place between 8 to 16 days later. For each scan, three slices were identified: the top and bottom plates of L4, and the mid-point of L4 vertebral body. On each slice, the cross sectional area (CSA) of the left and right psoas muscle was calculated using ImageJ. The difference and percentage change in CSA between both scans was calculated. White cell counts and C-reactive protein results were obtained, with peak levels correlated against change in muscle size.",

Introduction: Disturbances in gastrointestinal motility are common in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. Slow gastric emptying (GE) is the leading cause of enteral feeding intolerance (EFI), which compromises nutritional status and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This phase 2a study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of acute TAK-954 (previously TD-8954), a selective agonist of the 5 hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5HT4), compared with metoclopramide in critically ill patients with EFI. Methods: This was a double-blinded, double-dummy study conducted in mechanically ventilated patients with EFI (>200 mL gastric residual volume) randomized to receive either intervention (TAK-954 0.5 mg over 1 hour and 0.9% saline 10 ml injection QID) or control (0.9% saline over 1 hour and metoclopramide 10 mg injection QID). Within 1 hour of the first dose, patients received a test meal of 100 mL Ensure\u00ae and GE was measured using scintigraphy. Primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-954 and its effect on GE (% retention at 180 mins) vs control. Results: A total of 13 patients (intervention, n = 7; control, n = 6) were studied. The median ages were 47 and 57 years in these groups, respectively. Post-treatment, a 2-fold greater number of patients had normal gastric retention (<13% at 180 mins) in the intervention group vs the control group (6 vs 3; Fig. 1 ). In the intervention and control groups, (Table 1) . No AEs led to treatment discontinuation. Conclusions: A greater proportion of patients receiving TAK-954 had normal gastric retention after a single dose compared with those receiving metoclopramide. Treatment with TAK-954 was not associated with an increase in AEs. These results support further evaluation of TAK-954 in critically ill patients with EFI.",

However, current methods require that paracetamol be administered to an empty stomach, removing gastric contents and depriving patients of feeding for several hours. The objective of this study was to develop methods to assess gastric emptying in these patients without interrupting feeding. Methods: Gastric emptying was assessed in the fed state using PAT and scintigraphy in 12 healthy volunteers. Paracetamol 1g in 30mL was ingested immediately before consumption of a test meal of 250mL Ensure Plus containing 375kcal, 15.6g protein, and 12.3g fat plus 4mBq of 99mTc-DPTA as a scintigraphic agent. Comparisons were made between paracetamol absorption and the time to 25% and 50% gastric emptying by scintigraphy at baseline and after administration of ulimorelin 600\u03bcg/ kg, a prokinetic agent known to enhance gastric emptying. Blood samples for paracetamol were collected for up to 4h post administration. Values for normal gastric emptying were based on the 95% confidence intervals for PK parameters. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis before and after treatment. Results: The PAT correlated with scintigraphy and PK parameters for normal emptying were determined. Cmax and AUC2 were the most sensitive and specific parameters for assessing GE with lowest variability and areas under the ROC curve of 0.8981 and 0.8889, respectively. A 2h sampling period appeared sufficient to distinguish normal from abnormal emptying. Conclusions: The PAT can be used to distinguish normal versus abnormal GE in the fed state. Under the conditions used, patients can receive up to 250mL enteral feeding over a 2h test period (125 mL/hr). This method can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal gastric emptying in enterally tube fed patients without interrupting feedings. Introduction: For mechanically ventillated critically ill patients, the effect of full feeding on mortality is stil controversial. We aimed to investigate the relationship of energy intakes with 28-day mortality, and nutritional risk status influenced this relationship. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted among adult patients admitted to ICU and required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for more than 48 h. Data on baseline characteristics and the modified Nutritional Risk in Critically ill [mNUTRIC] score was collected on day 1. Energy intake and nutritional adequacy was recorded daily until death, discarge or until twelfth evaluable days. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a)received < 75% of prescribed energy b) received >= 75% of prescribed energy. Results: 150 patients (65% male, mean age 51.0\u00b115.3 years, mean body mass index 27.9\u00b16.2 kg/m2, mean mNUTRICscore 5.8\u00b1 1.7) were included. In the univariate analysis, mNUTR\u0130C score was associated with 28-day mortality. In the multivariable logistic regregression analysis, mNUTRIC score(Odds ratio, OR 1.65, CI 1.20-1.70, P < O.OO1) was associated with 28-day mortality. Nutritional adequacy was assessed, median nutritional adequacy was 0.40 (0.17-0.75). In patients with high mNUTR\u0130C score (5-9), received >= 75% of prescribed energy was associated with a lower predicted 28-day mortality; this was not observed in patients with low mNUTR\u0130C score (0-4). Conclusions: Nearly 60 % of IMV required patients admitted to ICU were at nutritional risk, mNUTR\u0130C score is associated with 28-day mortality. Energy adequacy of >= 75% of prescribed amounts were associated with decreased mortality in patients with a high mNUTR\u0130C score. Results: Patients included in the study were ASA IV. Four patients died in the first few days after surgery (2\u00f716 days). Mean length of stay in ICU was 5.2 \u00b13.4 days. Univariate analysis showed a correlation between hypoalbuminemia and the onset of MOF (p = 0.004); reduction of the lymphocyte count and risk of MOF (p = 0.008). SOFA score showed a significant correlation with occurrence of pneumonia (p = 0.035) and MOF (p = 0.04). Including the 30-day mortality among confounders, albumin and lymphocyte count were the strongest predictors of MOF. Length of stay in ICU and ventilation days did not have statistical significance. BMI showed no predictive value of any outcome. Conclusions: Our sample was poor but results of our study seem to indicate malnutrition as an independent risk factor for elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.",

This combined with the fact that patients with dysphagia have a longer stay in the hospital makes early prognosis and appropriate treatment important. Knowledge about effect of early dysphagia screening is limited. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of dysphagia in the Emergency Department (ED) population. Methods: This study included consecutively hospitalized patients in 10 days from 2pm-10pm at the ED of North Denmark Regional Hospital. The screening took place within 2 hours of admission. Inclusion criteria were any of the following: age \u226565 years, neurological disorders, alcoholism, COPD, pneumonia, dyspnoea, diabetes or unexplained weight loss. A nurse screened patients with a water test and with signs of dysphagia tested by an occupational therapist with the V-VST and the MEOF-II. Results: Of 140 eligible patients (56% male, median age 75 years) 95 (68%) were screened. It was impossible to screen 12 patients (9%) to limited time and 30 patients (21%) due to poor health condition and 5 patients (4%) declined participation. The prevalence of dysphagia in the study population was 16% (15 patients). Results from the water test were confirmed with V-VST and MEOF-II. In patients with lung related diseases or circulatory diseases was the prevalence respectively 25% and 24%. Patients, not screened due to poor health condition, were tested during hospitalisation and the prevalence of dysphagia was 75% in this group of patients. Conclusions: The prevalence in ED patients was 16%. Patients transferred to other departments due to poor health condition had a prevalence of 75%. It is possible to screen patients in the ED. The water test is a useful screening tool in an acute setting. Introduction: To improve protein and energy delivery in a nutrition delivery bundle was introduced to a Level 3 ICU. Greater protein and energy intake is associated with improved outcomes in the critically ill [1] [2] [3] [4] , but only 50% of prescribed protein and energy is delivered in ICUs worldwide [5, 6] . Methods: Percentage of target protein and energy delivery was measured via participation in the International Nutrition Survey (INS) before and after a \"nutrition delivery bundle\" was introduced by the ICU dietitian. The nutrition delivery bundle involved all stakeholders in ICU nutrition care (Fig. 1) and included the following quality improvement measures: increased ICU dietetic staffing, update of ICU Enteral Feeding Protocol with staff education, use of higher protein formulations, earlier patient nutrition assessment, daily calculation of percentage nutrition delivery, increased nutrition communication through more regular discussion of patient care with medical team, expansion of choice of nasojejunal tube available, 6 monthly reporting of key nutrition performance indicators, improved resources for cover dietitian(s) when ICU dietitian on leave (Fig. 2) . Results: Prior to a nutrition delivery bundle being introduced the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH) ICU achieved 59% of protein and 62% of energy targets over the first 12 admission days of 20 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients in ICU >72hrs enrolled in the International Nutrition Survey. This increased to 75% of protein and 79% of energy targets in 2014 (Table 1) . Conclusions: A 27% improvement in protein and energy delivery to critically ill patients was seen after the introduction of a dietitian-led nutrition delivery bundle. Introduction: The critically ill polytrauma patient with sepsis presents with variable energetic necessities characterized by a proinflammatory, pro-oxidative and hypermetabolic status. One of the challenges the ICU doctor faces is adapting the nutritional therapy based on the individual needs of each patient. Through this paper we wish to highlight the trend of energy needs in the case of critically ill polytrauma patients with sepsis by using non-invasive monitoring of respiratory gases based on indirect calorimetry (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland).",

Introduction: Cachexia is defined as a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness, characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat. In cancer cachexia, reduction in muscle size has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for mortality. Loss of muscle in ICU patients is rapid and extensive and is also associated with mortality risk, but methods to measure muscle mass in these patients are lacking. Surrogate methods (DEXA, CT, ultrasound, total body water) do not measure muscle mass directly Methods: The D3-creatine (D3-Cr) dilution method takes advantage of the fact that 98% of Cr is found in muscle and that muscle mass can be assessed by Cr pool size. Cr is transported into muscle against a concentration gradient and irreversibly converted to creatinine (Crn), which is excreted in urine. A single oral dose of D3-Cr is transported to skeletal muscle, and measurement of D3-Crn enrichment in a spot urine sample provides an accurate estimate of skeletal muscle mass. Results: The method has been validated in preclinical and clinical studies; in a large longitudinal observation study in older men, D3-Cr muscle mass was strongly associated with habitual walking speed, risk of falls, and incident mobility limitation; DEXA failed to show these relationships. The D3-Cr method is being used in a NICU study to measure changes in muscle mass in neonates (Gates Foundation Grant). Further, this method has been incorporated into a trial assessing the treatment effects of a ghrelin agonist in ICU patients with enteral feeding intolerance (NCT02784392). In this trial, the D3-Cr dose is delivered intravenously and a spot urine sample is collected at baseline and postdose.",

Introduction: Vitamin C, an enzyme cofactor and antioxidant, could hasten the resolution of inflammation, which affects most intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While many observational studies have demonstrated that critical illness is associated with low levels of vitamin C, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of high-dose vitamin C, alone or in combination with other antioxidants, yielded contradicting results. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the clinical effects of vitamin C when administered to various populations of ICU patients. Methods: Eligible trials: RCTs comparing vitamin C, by enteral or parenteral routes, to placebo in ICU patients. Data Collection and Analysis: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. After assessing eligibility, data was abstracted in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Overall mortality was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were infections, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and ventilator days. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted to identify more beneficial treatment effects. Results: Pooling 9 RCTs (n=1322) reporting mortality, vitamin C was not associated with a lower risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.84, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-1.37, P=0.44, I2=59%). In a subgroup analysis, trials of lower quality (n= 5) were associated with a reduction in mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32, 0.77, P= 0.002), whereas high quality trials (n= 4) were not. No statistical difference existed between subgroups (P= 0.22). In addition, no effect was found on infections, ICU or hospital length of stay, and ventilator days. Conclusions: Current evidence does not support the hypothesis that vitamin C supplementation improves clinical outcomes of ICU patients. Introduction: The protein intake for patients who met adequacy for energy was assessed within our cardiothoracic intensive care. Nutritional support should aim to provide at least 80% of calorie requirements to achieve nutritional adequacy with suggested protein requirements of 1.2-2 g/kg/day [1] . Guidelines highlight the difficulty achieving the correct protein:energy ratio from nutritional support to meet this target especially in the obese population. Methods: The audit was registered with clinical governance. Data was collected prospectively from patients requiring tube feeding for three or more days from January 2016 -October 2017 (Table 1 ). Data included type and volume of feed and calories from other sources. Patients who met adequacy for energy (Fig. 1) Introduction: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are usually at high risk of malnutrition [1, 2] . The purpose of our study was to compare the accuracy of Nutric score, NRS 2002 and SGA in predicting LOS-ICU, LOS-HOSP and in-hospital mortality. Methods: A total of 348 consecutive patients admitted between March to June 2016 in a mixed (medical/surgical) ICU were assessed on day of admission using the three screening tools to classify them into high-risk and low-risk of malnutrition. Day 1 APACHE 2 scores and demographic data were recorded. LOS-ICU, LOS-HOSP inhospital mortality and secondary outcomes studied were need for supplemental nutritional support, need for ventilation and need for dialysis in high-risk and low-risk patients by each nutrition assessment tool. Results: Of the 348 patients studied, 221 (63.5%) were males and 127 (36.5%) were females. 67.87% males and 71.65% females were found to be at a high risk of malnutrition by at least one of the scores. The mean APACHE 2 score for patients at high risk (using any one screening tool) was 15.11 (SD 6.10) and 8.04 for the low risk group (SD 3.34; p <0.01). The NRS 2002 and SGA demonstrated statistically significant correlation(p=0.001) for length of ICU stay for both the high risk and low risk group whereas only the NRS 2002 correlated significantly for the length of hospital stay(p=0.002). Mortality was significantly higher in high risk patients identified using all 3 scores. Conclusions: There was a wide difference in the percent of patients identified as high-risk using each of the 3 scores. Introduction: Nitrogen Balance (NB) may be an important tool in the nutritional management of critically ill patients. Cancer patients present a special challenge regarding nutrition, due to its peculiar characteristics related to neoplasia and adjuvant treatments. Objectives: To evaluate NB in patients with solid cancer in the postoperative period in the ICU, analyzing the correlation between NB and the mortality outcome in the ICU. Methods: Retrospective cohort study. We evaluated adult patients (>18 years) admitted to the ICUs of two different hospitals, with diagnosis of current cancer in postoperative period (elective or emergency surgeries). Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of cancer was not confirmed. NB (measured through analysis of dietary protein intake subtracted from 24-hour urinary urea plus an estimate of nonurinary losses) was calculated on the 1st, 3rd and 5th ICU day. NB was measured only while the patient was in the ICU. Results: During the study period, 125 patients were included (mean age 58.1, mean APACHE 17.4, 65.6% male). Admission APACHE II and abdominal-site surgery were predictors of mortality. The NB of all patients was negative on the 1st ICU day. In the patients who survived, NB of the 3rd and 5th day remained stable (negative), whereas in patients who died NB was more positive (Fig. 1) . There was no difference in the amount of protein ingested on the 1st day between survivors and deceased patients. Conclusions: Among adult patients with solid cancer in the postoperative period in the ICU, NB was persistently negative in the survivors between 1st and 5th ICU day, but among the patients who died NB tended to be more positive on the 3rd day. NB monitoring could allow a more adequate individualization of nutritional management in this group of patients. Fig. 1 (abstract P335) . Nitrogen Balance in 1st, 3rd and 5th ICU day Introduction: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the treatment of critically ill patients. Caloric and protein goals are defined, and artificial nutrition tailored to the targets which are related to outcome [1] . Questions rise about the mean caloric and protein needs of patients, once discharged from ICU, and the evolution of body weight, and nutritional adequacy. The aim is to know the ratios between caloric needs and intake of patients with a minimum stay at ICU of 5 days. Methods: After evaluation of 146 critically ill patients, 12 patients were prospectively followed during their entire hospitalization. Data concerning nutritional needs, prescriptions and delivery were collected from the electronic medical file. Nutritional calculations of oral intake were done by Nubel. Ratios were made during the entire stay and body weight was followed up. Results: In 5 female and 7 male patients, median age 63.5 years (range 26-84 year), estimated body weight of 74.8 \u00b1 21 kg and actual body weight of 73.3\u00b1 17 kg, a mean caloric need of 1795 \u00b1 479 kcal/ day and an effective delivery of 1348 \u00b1 508 kcal/day was observed. Body weight increased in two patients and decreased in 10 (83%). In ten out of twelve patients, underfeeding was present. One patient with a caloric need of 1125 kcal/day received a mean caloric load of 230 kcal/day (20.4%). Conclusions: The overall observed evolution in body weight was negative in most of the patients. Nutritional adequacy was low after ICU discharge and never reached target. Introduction: Severe burn injury can create a rapid-onset, sustained proinflammatory condition that can severely impair all major organs. This massive systemic response has been documented clinically by associated biomarker measurements including dramatic elevations in cytokines such as IL-6. The severity of multi-organ injury and subsequent development of other systemic complications in burn patients have been well-correlated with IL-6 levels, including the increased risk of sepsis/multi-organ failure and associated morbidity and mortality. Considering that estrogen is a powerful and easy to use anti-inflammatory agent, an experimental burn model was created to test the potential value of parenteral 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) as a feasible and inexpensive early intervention to mitigate the the profound pro-inflammatory response associated with severe thermal injury. Methods: Male rats (n = 28) were assigned randomly into three groups: 1) controls/no burn (n = 4); 2) burn/placebo (n = 12); and 3) burn/E2 (n = 12). Burned rats received a 40% 3\u00b0TBSA dorsal burn, fluid resuscitation and one dose of E2 or placebo (0.5 mg/kg intra-peritoneal) 15 minutes post-burn. Eight animals from each of the two burn groups (burn/placebo and burn/E2) were sacrificed at 30 minutes (sham group at 7 days only), with four each of the two burn groups sacrificed at 45 days. Tissue samples from 9 major organs and serum were obtained and analyzed by ELISA for IL-6 at each of these intervals. Results: In the burned rats, 17\u03b2-estradiol decreased the organ levels of IL-6 significantly as measured at both early (30 min.) and late (45 day) phases post-burn (Figs. 1 & 2 . Also, sham animal levels were comparable to the estradiol group, Conclusions: Experimentally, a single, early post-burn dose of estrogen significantly mitigates the associated detrimental inflammatory response in all major organs up to 45 days. In turn, this may present a promising potential therapy to decrease the widespread multipleorgan dysfunction seen in severe burn injury patients.",

            "text": "Early, single-dose estrogen increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin for neuronal survival and neurogenesis following indirect brain inflammation caused by severe torso burns Introduction: Prior studies have found that patients with severe burns may suffer significant neurocognitive changes. While frequently attributed to psycho-social issues, we have found a substantial, rapid and sustained (30 min -45 day) increase in rat brain inflammatory markers (for example, IL-6) following remote torso burns that is blunted by a single post-burn dose of estrogen. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the most active neurotrophins, protects existing neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. As estrogens not only blunt inflammation but also exert an influence on CNS growth factors, we hypothesized that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) might affect levels of BDNF in the post-burn rat brain. Methods: Male rats (n = 44) were assigned randomly into three groups: controls/no burn (n = 4); burn/placebo (n = 20); and burn/E2 (n = 20). Burned rats received a 40% 3\u00b0TBSA dorsal burn, fluid resuscitation and one dose of E2 or placebo (0.5 mg/ kg intraperitoneally) 15 minutes post-burn. Eight animals from each of the two burn groups (burn/placebo and burn/E2) were sacrificed at 24 hours and at 7 days, respectively (sham group at 7 days only), with four each of the two burn groups sacrificed at 45 days. Brain tissue samples were analyzed by ELISA for BDNF. Results: Mean levels of BDNF were significantly elevated within 24 hours and continued to increase up to 45 days post-injury in burned animals receiving the 17\u03b2-estradiol (>300 pcg/mg) as compared with the placebo-treated burned animals (<160 pg/mg) and controls (<120. pcg/mg). See Fig. 1 . Conclusions: Early, single-dose estrogen administration following remote severe burn injury significantly elevated levels of BDNF in brain tissue. This finding may represent an extremely novel and important pathway to enhance both neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in burn patients.",

S Tachyla, A Marochkov Mogilev Regional Hospital, Mogilev, Belarus Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P339 Introduction: Hormones changes in patients with infection and multiple organ dysfunction is a topic that hasn't been adequately studied. Goal of study: to establish the value of cortisol in patients with infection and multiple organ dysfunction. Methods: After approval the ethics committee of the Mogilev Regional Hospital a prospective observational study was performed. The study included 181 patients aged 18 to 87 years. All patients were hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit with the infection and multiple organ dysfunction. Patients with endocrine diseases and receiving glucocorticoids were excluded. Cortisol levels were measured on admission and during the course of treatment by radioimmunoassay. In Group L (n = 16) patients had a low levels of cortisol, in the M group (n = 96) -normal cortisol, in group H (n = 69) -high cortisol. Results: Cortisol level was in L-group 91.9 (8.28, 131.7) nmol/L, in Mgroup 410.9 (292.8; 504.7) nmol/L, in H-group 934.2 (763, 6; 1495.5) nmol/L. It is found that the mortality was higher in the groups L -43.8% (p = 0.33) and H -47.8% (p = 0.03), than in the M-group -31.3%. The Mgroup odds ratio equals 2.02 at 95% confidence interval 1.06 -3.82 when compared with the H-group. In the M-group in survivors patients (n = 36) showed a decrease cortisol with 1281 (1033.8, 1702.5) nmol/L to 912.3 (801.5, 1068.8) nmol/L (p = 0.01). While the no survivors patients (n = 33) showed increase cortisol with 732 (657.1, 749.2) nmol/L to 1491.2 (1000; 1600) nmol/L (p = 0.008). Thus itself cortisol level is not a marker of mortality. Receiver operating curve analysis for cortisol was performed: area under the curve equals 0.56 at 95% confidence interval of 0.47 -0.65 (p = 0.19), sensitivity 48.4%, specificity 70.6%. Conclusions: In patients with infection and multiple organ dysfunction may be observed disorders in cortisol levels. These disorders require correction to prevent the increased mortality. Introduction: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a key regulator of critical illness. Cortisol and adreno-corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) are pulsatile, which emerges from the feed forwardfeedback of the two hormones [1] . Different genes are activated by continuous or pulsatile activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, even when the total amount is the same [2] . We aimed to characterise the ACTH and cortisol profiles of patients who were critically ill after cardiac surgery and assess the impact of inflammatory mediators on serum cortisol concentrations. Methods: 20 patients with >2 organ system failure, >2 days after cardiac surgery were recruited. Total cortisol was assayed every 10 min, ACTH every hour and IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, TNF-\u03b1 every 4 hours. Cortisol binding globulin (CBG) was assayed at 0 and 24hrs. The relationship between cortisol and the inflammatory mediators was quantified in individual patients using a mixed regression model. Results: All profiles showed pulsatility of both cortisol and ACTH and there was concordance between the two hormones (See Fig. 1 ). One patient died after 23 hours (see Fig. 2 ). This patient lost pulsatility and concordance of cortisol and ACTH. Mean CBG was 26.89\u03bc g/ml at the start of sampling and 28.13\u03bc g/ml at the end. There was an association between IL6 (p=0.0002), IL10 (p<0.0001), IL4 (p=0.029) and serum cortisol levels. There was no association between the other mediators and cortisol. Conclusions: Cortisol and ACTH are both pulsatile in critical illness. Because pulsatility emerges from the interaction between the two hormones[2]the premise of a 'disconnect' between the pituitary and adrenal gland is refuted. IL6, IL10 and IL4 may have roles in the control of cortisol during critical illness. Introduction: Elevation in plasma cortisol is a vital response to sepsis and partially brought about by reduced cortisol breakdown in which bile acids (BAs) may play a role. Vice versa, cortisol can also upregulate BAs. We hypothesized a central role for the hepatic glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) in cortisol and BA homeostasis and in survival from sepsis. Methods: In a mouse model of sepsis, we documented hGR expression and investigated the impact of hepatocyte-specific shRNAknockdown of GR on markers of corticosterone (CORT), BA and glucose homeostasis, inflammation and survival. We also compared hGR expression in human septic ICU and elective surgery patients. Results: In mice, sepsis reduced hGR expression with 21% (p=0.04), elevated plasma CORT, BAs and glucose and suppressed A-ringreductases. Also in human patients, sepsis reduced hGR expression (p<0.01), further suppressed by treatment with steroids (p=0.04). In septic mice, further and sustained hGR-inhibition increased mortality from 12% to 60% (p<0.01). At 30h, hGR-inhibition prevented the rise in total plasma CORT, but did not affect A-ring-reductases expression. However, it further reduced CORT binding proteins, resulting in elevated free CORT equal to septic mice without modified hGR. After 3 days of hGR-inhibition in sepsis, total and free CORT were comparable to septic mice without modified hGR, now explained by further reduced A-ring-reductase expression, possibly driven by higher hepatic BA content. HGR-inhibition blunted the hyperglycemic sepsis response without causing hypoglycemia, markedly increased hepatic and circulating inflammation markers and caused liver destruction (p<0.05), the severity of which explained increased mortality. Conclusions: In conclusion, sepsis partially suppressed hGR expression, which appears to upregulate free CORT availability via lowered CORT binding proteins and A-ring-reductases. However, further sustained hGR suppression evoked lethal excessive liver and systemic inflammation, independent of CORT availability. Introduction: Cortisol levels have been found to be increased in sepsis patients, and high cortisol levels have been correlated with increased mortality. The purpose of this project is to assess the association of plasma cortisol levels with severity of coagulopathy in a population of patients with sepsis and clinically confirmed DIC. Methods: Citrated, de-identified plasma samples were collected from 52 adults with sepsis and suspected DIC at the time of ICU admission. Platelet count was determined as part of standard clinical practice. PT/INR and fibrinogen were measured using standard techniques on the ACL-ELITE coagulation analyzer. Cortisol, D-dimer, PAI-1, CD40L, NLRP3, and microparticles were measured using commercially available ELISA kits and were performed. DIC score was calculated using ISTH scoring algorithm. Results: Cortisol showed significant variation based on DIC status (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Patients with non-overt DIC and overt DIC exhibited significantly elevated cortisol levels compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001 for both groups). Cortisol levels showed DIC based variations. Patients with sepsis and overt DIC had elevated cortisol compared to patients with sepsis and no DIC (p = 0.0069) (Fig. 1) . Correlations were evaluated between cortisol and hemostatic markers platelets, fibrinogen, INR, D-Dimer, and PAI-1 as well as with the inflammatory marker, NLRP3 and the platelet markers CD40L and microparticles. Cortisol Conclusions: Cortisol showed a significant association with hemostatic status in a population of patients with sepsis and welldefined coagulopathy. Cortisol levels were significantly elevated in patients with overt or non-overt DIC compared to healthy individuals and in patients with overt DIC compared to those with sepsis without DIC. Introduction: In most cases presenting with hypoglycemia in emergency departments (EDs), the etiology of the hypoglycemia is almost identified. However, about 10% of cases, the etiology of hypoglycemia cannot be determined. Methods: This is a 2-year prospective observational study. A total of 232 patients were transported to our ED with hypoglycemia. After the investigation, a rapid ACTH loading test (synthetic 1-24 ACTH 250 \u03bcg iv.) was performed on 21 patients with unexplained hypoglycemia; i.e., 250 \u03bcg ACTH was administered intravenously and blood specimens were collected before loading, at 30 min and 60 min after ACTH administration. We adopted a peak serum cortisol level < 18 \u03bcg/dl or a delta cortisol of < 9 \u03bc g/dl for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Results: Among the patients, 163 of 232 (70.3%) were using antidiabetic drugs, 15 (6.5%) were using hypoglycemia-relevant drugs, 12 (5.2%) suffered from digestive absorption failure including malnutrition, 10 (4.3%) had been consuming alcohol, 9 (3.9%) suffered from malignancy, and 2 (0.9%) suffered from insulin autoimmune syndrome. Initially, an etiology was unknown in 21 of 232 (9.1%) patients. Rapid ACTH test revealed the adrenal insufficiency in 19 (8.2%) among them. Administration of hydrocortisone in adrenal insufficiency patients promptly improved hypoglycemia. In those patients, serum sodium level was lower (Na; 134 vs. 139 mEq/l, P<0.001) and serum potassium level was higher (K; 4.7 vs. 3.9 mEq/l, P<0.001) than in the other hypoglycemic patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in baseline plasma glucose level on ED between the groups of patients (28 vs. 26 mg/dl, P=0.34). Conclusions: The probability of adrenal insufficiency was much greater than that of the better-known insulinoma as a cause of hypoglycemia. When protracted hypoglycemia of unknown etiology is recognized, we recommend that the patient is checked for adrenal function using the rapid ACTH loading test. Introduction: Sepsis caused have showed serious alternations of thyroid hormones releasing, causing a nonthyroidal illness syndrome. The aim of the study was to measure thyroid hormone levels in septic patients and analyse its relation with clinical state and outcome. Methods: Prospective study in a cohort of 150 consecutive septic patients. We studied thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine fraction (fT3) and free thyroxin fraction (fT4) serum levels, APACHE II and SOFA score. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0. Results: We analysed 150 episodes of sepsis (16%) and septic shock (SSh) (84%), the median age of the patients was 64 (inter-quartile range, 48.7-71) years; the main sources of infection were: respiratory tract (39%) and intra-abdomen (30%); 70.7% had medical diseases. APACHE II score was 25 [21-30], SOFA score was 10 [7.75-11] and 28day mortality was 22.7%. Our data shown 18.3% with low levels of TSH (<0.2uUI/mL), 20.3% had low levels of fT4 (<0.75 ng/dL) and 71.4% low levels of fT3 (<2 pg/mL). The TSH (0.89 vs. 1.46 uUI/mL) and fT3 (1.3 vs 1.8 pg/ml) concentration of SSh group were significantly lower than those of sepsis group, whereas FT4 (1.10 vs 1.18 ng/dL) it was not statistically significantly. Correlation of FT3 to APA-CHE II (r = \u22120.342, p = 0.035) and SOFA score (r = \u22120.409, p = 0.017). The profile of death patients were men (64.7%, n =22), with significantly older (63 vs. 57 years; p=0,049), as well as clinical severity scores, APACHE II (29.8 vs. 24.1; p<0.001) and SOFA (12.1 vs 8.9; p<0,001). Non-survivors had significantly lower TSH 0.85 vs. 1.4 uUI/ mL; p=0.042, and fT3 1.2 vs. 1.39 pg/mL, p=0.031, however fT4 did not show statistical significance 0.42 vs. 0.58ng/dL, p=ns. Conclusions: Conclusions: Most of our septic patients present an altered thyroid function. Our data suggest that TSH and specially fT3 may be used as a marker of disease severity and a mortality predictor.",

Introduction: Reduction of bone mineral density and/or muscle mass can be short and long-term complications in critical patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The study aims to evaluate, during a 12-month period, the following parameters: 1) the alterations of bone metabolism and quantitative and qualitative parameters of bone tissue, 2) the proportion of subjects with bone fragility, and 3) the identification of specific risk factors. Methods: An observational-longitudinal monocentric study is being conducted in adult patients hospitalized in ICU. The evaluations performed at baseline, 6 and 12 month visits include analysis of biochemical and instrumental exams. Results: A specific clinical-care pathway was created between Bone Metabolic Diseases Unit and ICU, in order to perform specific anamnestic collection, biochemical analysis of bone metabolism, and instrumental exams. 31 patients were enrolled and evaluated at the baseline visit. Biochemical exams, performed within 72 hours of hospitalization, showed that 64% (N:20) of subjects had a deficit of 25OHvitaminD <20 ng/dl, associated with normal corrected serum calcium levels and of these 42% (N:13) had high PTH levels. Bone alkaline phosphatase was increased in 26% (N:8) of patients. Conclusions: Critical patients are \"fragile\" subjects, which should be monitored with a short and long-term follow-up. The creation of a clinical pathway that includes specialists of bone metabolism may be a virtuous way to identify patients who report bone mass loss and increased fracture risk. This study will allow to implement the knowledge regarding specific risk factors of bone fragility and the most appropriate therapeutic choices as prevention and treatment.",

The incidence of DKA is quoted as between 4.6-8 episodes per 1000 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) [1] . We aim to establish the factors that affect length of stay (LOS) on ICU. Methods: We undertook an analysis of patients admitted to ICU over the last 7 years with a primary diagnosis of DKA. We assessed whether there was an association between the following factors and an increased length of ICU stay: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, sodium, potassium, haemoglobin and pH. These factors were assessed using multiple linear backward stepwise regression. Results: Overall, 94 admissions were identified over the time period from the ward watcher database. The median LOS was 2.4 days (IQR 1.3 -4.7). Our analysis demonstrated that length of ICU stay (alpha level <0.05) was significantly associated with BMI, low systolic blood pressure, and the presence of hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia. Conclusions: We found the variables that affect the LOS for patients presenting to our unit with DKA are BMI, elow systolic BP, low sodium and high sodium. We intend to extend this work to include survival analysis with the same subgroup of patients.",

However, there have been no report of the correlation between various parameters of GV and mortality in medical ICU patients. The aim was to determine the correlation between various parameters of GV and medical ICU mortality, as well as, to identify the best GV index to predict ICU mortality. Methods: A retrospective chart review was then conducted in medical ICU at Songklanagarind hospital. The patient characteristics, causes of admission, APACHE II, blood glucose within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and ICU mortality were recorded. Glycemic variability parameters including maximal glycemic gap, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and J-index of blood glucose were calculated. The correlation of those GV index to ICU mortality was determined. The ROC and AUROC of each GV index were then compare to identify the best GV index to predict ICU mortality. Results: Of 538 patients, 442 patients (82.2%) were survived ( Table 1 ). All GV indexes were significantly higher in non-survival group (p < 0.05) ( Table 2 ). Maximal glycemic gap was independently correlated to ICU mortality and give a highest AUROC compared to others GV.

Can capillary blood glucose (CG) replace plasmatic glucose (PG). The objective of this study was to compare capillary blood glucose with venous blood glucose Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes were included. We realize a capillary blood glucose with a glucose meter (acu-check active-Roche) and a concomitant determination of venous blood glucose with laboratory machine (synchrony CX3 delta system beckman coulter). A correlation study (Pearson correlation) between the two measurements was evaluated and linear fitting equation was established. The concordance was checked with Bland and Altman method. Results: During the 4 months of the study, 258 patients were included. The average age was 55+/-19 years old, with a sex ratio =1. Majority of patients (70%,n=182) had type 2 diabetes and 58% was treated with insulin. We found an excellent correlation between the two techniques with a Pearson correlation coefficient r= 0.96.Topredict the PG from CG, we can use this equation: PG(g/l)=0.9979 CG(g/l)+ 0.08128 (R2=0.9207 ; p=0.0001). We noticed a good concordance between the two techniques especially in case of hypoglycemia and moderate hyperglycemia (Fig. 1) . However, 11 releases were noted with a PG higher than 4g/l. Conclusions: In ED, the measurement of capillary glucose can exempt from venous blood glucose especially in case of hypoglycemia and moderate hyperglycemia. is frequently found in critically ill patients in ICU, especially patients who are treated for a long time. This study aims to analyse the comparison between length of stay and DVT incidents in critically ill patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was employed. We include all patients who were 18 years or older and were treated in ICU of Dr Soetomo public hospital for at least 7 days. Data were collected from June 2016 until June 2017. The patients were examined with Sonosite USG to look for any thrombosis in iliac, femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins and Well's criteria were also taken. Results: Thirty patients were included in this study. This study shows that length of stay is not the only risk factor for DVT in patients treated in ICU. In our data, we found out that the length of treatment did not significantly cause DVT. Other risk factors such as age and comorbidities in patients who are risk factors may support the incidence of DVT events. The diagnosis of DVT is enforced using an ultrasound performed by an expert in the use of ultrasound to locate thrombus in a vein.",

Several other factors still need to be investigated in order for DVT events to be detected early and prevented. [2] was used to retrospectively study trends and outcomes of cancer patients admitted to the ICU between 2002 and 2011. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of 28-day and 1-year mortality. Results: Out of 41,468 ICU admissions, 1,100 hemato-oncological, 3,953 oncological and 49 patients with both a hematologic and solid malignancy were analyzed. Hematologic patients had higher critical illness scores, while oncological patients had similar APACHE-III and SOFA-scores. In the univariate analysis, cancer was strongly associated with mortality (OR 2.5, Table 1 ). Over the 10-year study period, 28-day mortality of cancer patients decreased by 30% (Fig. 1) . This trend persisted after adjustment for covariates, with cancer patients having significantly higher mortality (OR=2.49, 95%CI: 2.3, 2.7). Between 2002 and 2011, the adjusted 28-day mortality decreased by 8% every year. Over the decade, 1-year mortality decreased by 27%. Having cancer was the strongest individual predictor of 1-year mortality in the multivariate model (OR=4.40, 95%CI: 4.1, 4.8) (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: Between 2002 and 2011, the number of cancer patients admitted to the ICU increased steadily and significantly, while longitudinal clinical severity scores remained overall unchanged. Although hematological and oncological patients had higher mortality rates than patients without cancer, both 28-day and 1-year mortality decreased significantly over the study period. Introduction: Sepsis was redefined in 2016 with the introduction of an increase in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment \u0394SOFA) score of >= 2 and the quickSOFA (qSOFA) as screening tools for sepsisrelated mortality. However, the implementation of these criteria into clinical practice has been controversial and the applicability for hematological patients is unclear. Methods: We therefore studied the diagnostic accuracy of different sepsis criteria for sepsis and mortality according to definition criteria in a retrospective analysis of hematological patients in an academic tertiary care hospital. Patient characteristics and variables were collected in ICUand non-ICU patients to determine the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), \u0394SOFA and qSOFA. By applying the definition of sepsis as \"life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection\" [1] as reference, the scores were evaluated. In patients with sepsis who died, 5/22 were SIRS-negative, 4/24 \u0394SOFA-negative and 14/20 qSOFA-negative ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings suggest that criteria proposed in the Sepsis-3 definition might have limitations as screening Fig. 2 (abstract P351) .

The aim was to investigate the impact of ARC on the pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin. Methods: This is a prospective study in a surgical and medical intensive care unit (ICU) carried out from August to November 2017. Patients <65 years old, under prophylactic treatment with enoxaparin and normal plasma creatinine, were included. Anti-Xa activity was measured at second day under treatment. Creatinine clearance was calculated from urine sample collected during 24-hours. ARC was defined by a creatinine clearance >=130 mL/min/1.73 m2. Results: Thirteen patients aged 43 years old (\u00b116.4) were included. Six patients developed ARC and 5 of them were in therapeutic range. Seven patients did not develop ARC and 6 of them were in therapeutic range. There was no differences between the two groups in achieving therapeutic range (Fisher test, p=0.5). We did not observe thromboembolic events. Conclusions: We found no relationship between ARC and therapeutic failure in patients under prophylactic treatment with enoxaparin.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study in a medical and surgical ICU in a tertiary teaching hospital. Data was collected for adult patients treated with argatroban for proven or suspected HIT April-August 2016, excluding patients requiring ECMO. We scored patients using the 4T score and compared this to an ELISA immunoassay optical density score which quantifies the PF4/H antibody level. Also noted was use of continuous haemodialysis and organ failure using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), scoring >=3 defines failure. Results: 16 patients were treated with argatroban for proven or suspected HIT. 15/16 patients had a positive ELISA. There was no relationship between 4T score and ELISA optical density (Fig. 1) . Infusions were commenced at either the manufacturer recommended dose of 2 \u03bcg/kg/min or a reduced dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/min. Patients receiving the reduced dose had a median of 2 organs failing compared to 1 in the standard regimen. The time taken to the first APTR in range was longer with the reduced dose regimen, however, the time to a stable APTR was less (Table 1 ). In 2 patients the dose of argatroban never stabilised. 1 died and 1 was very sensitive to argatroban and required cessation of the infusion for interventions. In the reduced regimen group, there were 2 episodes of bleeding, 1 minor PR bleed in a patient with 3 organs failure and 1 upper GI bleed. Conclusions: In this population of ICU patients the 4T score did not correlate with the ELISA optical density score, as found previously. Patients with multi-organ failure mostly received the reduced starting dose. However, the bleeding events were still confined to this group. This correlates with previous studies that organ dysfunction necessitates a dose reduction for argatroban. Results: The mean age in our study group was 54\u00b122 years. The effects of TPE on standard coagulation were increased aPTT (24\u00b12 to 36 \u00b1 6 s, p=0.005) and decreased fibrinogen levels (286\u00b176 to 242 \u00b148 mg/dL, p=0.008). A non-significant decrease in platelet count was observed (160333\u00b123091 to 151133\u00b122244/mm 3 , p=0.662). On ROTEM parameters TPE was associated with increased CT in ExTEM (57\u00b18 to 73\u00b112 s, p=0.030) and InTEM (156\u00b115 to 194 \u00b152 s, p=0.003) and increased MaxVt on ExTEM (90\u00b1 27 to 128 \u00b1 37 s, p=0.031) and InTEM (177\u00b117 to 225\u00b171 s, p=0.003). All other ROTEM parameters changed non-significantly. The decrease observed in fibrinogen levels was not associated with a decrease in FibTEM MCF (15\u00b12 to 14\u00b12 mm, p=0.414).",

Therefore, TPE with fresh frozen plasma can be safely used in normal subjects. Introduction: Acutely ill patients are prone to critical illness anaemia, a multifactorial condition with potential contribution of iatrogenic anaemia defined as lowered Hb due to large/frequent venepunctions. Decline in Hb is most pronounced in the first 3 days of ICU stay. It correlates with the need for RBC transfusion, but the impact on patient outcome is uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine impact of phlebotomy on change in Hb (\u0394Hb), and correlation of \u0394Hb with need for transfusion, presence of central venous catheter (CVC) and patient outcome. Conclusions: Critical illness anaemia is an unexplained phenomenon. Impact of phlebotomy is hard to unequivocally determine since there are many confounders. The change in Hb levels during ICU stay correlates with the need for transfusion that could cause immunomodulation and potentially adverse outcome. Every effort should be made to maintain adequate Hb levels and lower the risk of iatrogenic anemia. Introduction: Anemia is prevalent in critically ill traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are often required. Over the years, restrictive transfusion strategies have been advocated in the general critically ill population. However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding optimal transfusion thresholds in critically ill TBI patients due to the susceptibility of the injured brain to hypoxemic damages. Methods: We conducted an electronic self-administered survey targeting all intensivists and neurosurgeons from Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom working caring for TBI patients. The questionnaire was developed using a structured process of domains/items generation and reduction with a panel of experts. It was validated for clinical sensibility, reliability and content validity. Results: The response rate was 28.6% (217/760). When presented with a scenario of a young patient with severe TBI, a wide range of transfusion practices was noted among respondents, with 47% favoring RBC transfusion at a hemoglobin level of 7g/dL or less in the acute phase of care, while 73% would use this trigger in the plateau phase. Multiple trauma, neuromonitoring data, hemorrhagic shock and planned surgeries were the most important factors thought to influence the need for transfusion. The level of evidence was the main reason mentioned to explain the uncertainty regarding RBC transfusion strategies. Conclusions: In critically ill TBI patients, transfusion practices and hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion are said to be influenced by patients' characteristics and the use of neuromonitoring in critical care physicians and neurosurgeons from Canada, Australia and the UK. Equipoise regarding optimal transfusion strategy is manifest, mainly attributed to lack of clear evidences and clinical guidelines (1-year) . No significant associations were found between FFP:RBC ratio and mortality rates. Patients with higher APACHE II score received more platelet transfusions and mortality rates were higher in those who received Platelets:RBC ratio >1. On multivariate analysis, higher APA-CHE II score was an independent predictor of increased mortality.",

Introduction: The lack of evidence-based medicine supporting the transfusion decision is illustrated by the wide range of blood product use during first-time coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Use of red blood cells (RBC) ranges from 3 to 83 percent, while the use of platelets range from 0 to 40 [1] . Approximately 20 percent of CABG patients suffer abnormal bleeding, with platelet dysfunction thought to be the most common culprit [2] . Methods: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of allogeneic blood and blood products among patients undergoing first-time CABG over the past 15years. The first 50 patients who underwent CABG (on-pump and off-pump) from 1 st of March each year were included for analysis. The percentage of patients receiving RBC, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelet and cryoprecipitate during the first 48 hours intra-and postoperatively were analysed. Linear regression analysis was performed in each group.",

Introduction: Transfusion of packed red cells (PRCs) is an important treatment option for patients requiring intensive care but, like all treatments, it is not without risk. These patients, although may be more sensitive to anaemia, are also at increased risk of transfusionrelated complications. We conducted an audit of blood prescribing and administering practices in our intensive care unit. Methods: Audit proformas were placed in blood prescribing forms for a 1-month period.

For patients transfused for a low Hb, the mean transfusion trigger was 75 g/L (range: 66 g/L -86 g/L). Only 12% had a transfusion trigger of 70g/L or less, and a further 12% who were transfused for a low Hb had a Hb of 80g/L or more. 36% of transfusion events involved transfusing 2 or more units and, in only 22% of these cases the Hb was checked between units. Excluding the two bleeding patients, the mean increase in Hb following a single unit transfusion was 11.4 g/L (range 2 g/L -18 g/L), whilst in patients transfused two units, the average increase in Hb was 10 g/L per unit transfused (range 7 g/L -14.5 g/L), suggesting single unit transfusions may have greater Hb yields. Conclusions: Our audit demonstrated variability in transfusion triggers and progress needed with administering practices when transfusing multiple units of blood in the non-bleeding patient. We have since implemented measures to meet guidelines in both prescribing PRCs with restrictive triggers and in the administration and assessment of Hb between units, and will be re-auditing. Introduction: There is a perceived increased risk of bleeding in cirrhosis patients undergoing invasive procedures. This lead to a high rate of empirical prophylactic transfusion, which has been associated to increased complications and cost. The best strategy to guide transfusion in these patients remains unclear. Our aim was to compare three strategies to guide blood component transfusion prior to central venous catheterization (CVC) in critically ill cirrhosis patients.",

A lower Clot-score occurred after FFP transfusion than use of CFC, mainly through persistent thrombocytopenia (platelet count R2-4 FFP vs CFC p<0.02) (Fig. 2) . The higher Concentration-score after FFP did not affect MOF and FFP had no beneficial effect on fibrinolysis, syndecan-1, TM or APC. Conclusions: Hemostatic resuscitation should augment the factor Clot, which is feasible with early fibrinogen administration but not with FFP. The found platelet-saving effect of early fibrinogen administration is important as platelets play a major role in inflammation and transfusion of platelets did not correct thrombocytopenia. Introduction: The Trauma Induced Coagulopathy Clinical Score (TICCS) was developed to be calculable on the site of injury with the objective to discriminate between trauma patients with or without the need for Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR) and thus transfusion [1] . This early alert could then be translated to in-hospital parameters at patient arrival. Base excess (BE) and ultrasound (FAST) are known to be predictive parameters for emergent transfusion. We emphasize that adding this two parameters to the TICCS could improve its predictability. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in the University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge. Based on the available data in the register (from January 1st 2015 to December 31st 2016), the TICCS was calculated for every patient. BE and FAST results were recorded and points were added to the TICCS according to the TICCS.BE definition (+3 points if BE < -5 and + 3 points in case of a positive FAST). Emergent transfusion was defined as the use of at least one blood product in the resuscitation room. The capacity of the TICCS, the TICCS.BE and the Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage (TASH) to predict emergent transfusion were assessed. Results: A total of 328 patients were included in the analysis. 46 (14 %) needed emergent transfusion. The probability for emergent transfusion grows with the TICCS.BE value (Fig. 1) . Positive Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values (NPV) of the three scores are displayed in Table 1 . Conclusions: Our results confirm that BE and FAST results are relevant parameters that can be added to the TICCS for better prediction of the need for emergent transfusion after trauma.

Prophylactic measures to prevent VTE primarily consist of anticoagulants. In instances in which anticoagulation is contraindicated or inadequate, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be used [2] . However, insertion of IVC filter as a prophylactic measure is controversial as filter-related complications are well documented and increase with treatment time [3] .

Agitation causes potential harm to patients and caregivers, interferes with treatments, leads to unnecessary chemical and physical restraints, increases hospital length of stay, delays rehabilitation, and impedes functional independence. Pharmacological treatments are often considered for agitation management following TBI. However, the benefit and safety of these agents in TBI patients as well as their differential effects and interactions are uncertain. Methods: The major databases and the grey literature were searched. We included all randomized controlled, quasi-experimental, and observational studies with control groups. The population of interest was all patients, including children and adults, who have suffered a TBI. Studies in which agitation was the presenting symptom or one of the presenting symptoms, studies where agitation was not the presenting symptom but was measured as an outcome variable and studies assessing the safety of these pharmacological interventions in TBI patients were included. Results: We identified 14 226 references with our search strategy. Two authors screened 12 899 after removal of duplicates. After searching the grey literature and secondary databases, a total of 170 potential articles were identified. Eleven studies in which agitation or an associated behavior was the presenting symptom, 11 studies where agitation was not the presenting symptom but was measured as an outcome variable, and 3 studies assessing the safety of these pharmacological interventions were identified. Overall, the quality of studies was weak. In studies directly addressing agitation, pindolol and propranolol may reduce assaults and agitation episodes.

Our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of this procedure in adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Methods: We systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CEN-TRAL, Web of Science, conference proceedings and databases of ongoing trials for eligible trials. We included randomized controlled trials of adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury, comparing DC to any other intervention. Our primary outcome was the neurological function based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Secondary outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, intracranial pressure control, and complications. Two reviewers independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using a standardized form. We used random effect models to conduct our analyses and the I2 index to assess heterogeneity.

Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), ICP, and brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2) were recorded hourly and were compared to baseline for 6 hours after each dose. Safety outcomes included peak serum sodium, peak serum chloride, and the incidence of stage 1 acute kidney injury (AKI) (serum creatinine elevation >=0.3 mg/dL or >=50%) [2] . Results: Between August 2007 and July 2017, 45 eligible pediatric patients received 235 doses of 23.4% NaCl; 215 doses were included in the analysis of perfusion parameters. Mean age was 11.6 +/-6 years (2 months to 18 years), and the median initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was 4. Subjects received a median of four 23.4% NaCl boluses, with a mean dose of 0.5 +/-0.18 mL/kg. Significantly lower ICP and higher CPP (p<0.001) were observed at all post-treatment time points (Fig. 1) ; PbtO2 was also significantly increased during 3 of the 6 hours recorded (p<0.05). There was no difference in MAP. Peak post-treatment serum sodium and chloride were 157 +/-6 mEq/L and 122 +/-7 mEq/L, respectively (Fig. 2) . Stage 1 AKI was observed in 15.6% of patients, and in-hospital mortality was 24.4%. Conclusions: Our data suggests that 23.4% NaCl is a safe and effective therapy for elevated ICP in pediatric patients. Methods: We performed a prospective study in adult patients with mild head trauma (GCS 14 and 15) qualified for acquisition of urgent head CT scan. The clinical symptoms potentially related to intracranial lesion including abnormal vitals, vomiting, headache, persistent dizziness were recorded. ONS as well as head CT were then performed. All ONS examinations were executed by an experienced sonographer to eliminating interrater bias. Head CT findings were dichotomized as positive or negative finding for ICH based on formal radiology reports. The patients' disposition including admission, surgery and safe discharge were followed. Results: 78 patients were enrolled for the survey. 16 patients had at least one symptom related to potential intracranial lesion (20.5%). The mean ONSD was 44\u00b19mm. 25 patients were found to have ICH and 6 underwent neurosurgery thereafter. No significant difference of ONSD was found between the groups with and without ICH, as well as the group receiving surgery or conservative treatment. With introducing a conventional 5mm threshold of ONSD, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV was 0.36, 0.83, 0.50 and 0.73, respectively. While incorporating occurrance of at least one positive clinical symptom with the ONSD measurement greater than 5mm as a composite threshold, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV was 0.32, 1.00, 1.00 and 0.76, respectively. Conclusions: The diagnostic value of ONS in mild head trauma is defective. Nevertheless, with the supplemental aid of recognition of clinical symptoms relevant to potential intracranial lesion, the overall accuracy would improve.",

One patient developed a small hydrothorax, not attributed to device use. All patients survived to discharge from the ICU, with median CPC of 2 (range 1 to 4). Conclusions: Targeted temperature management of patients with traumatic brain injury using an esophageal heat transfer device was feasible and safe, providing a tight maintenance of goal temperature in this challenging patient population. Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a serious problem in Europe. It still is the principal cause of death in US and Europe. Every year in Italy 250 people on 100,000 suffers of TBI and 17 on 100,000 dies. Disability and incapacity from TBI provides \"strong ethicals, medicals, social and health economy imperative to motivate a concerted effort to improve treatment and preventions\" Methods: Our hospital is the hub for Modena's county for TBI and we took part in the past 3 year on European project CREACTIVE (Collaborative ResearcE on ACute Traumatic brain Injury in intensiVe Care medicine in Europa) as branch of Italian group GIVITI (Gruppo Italiano per la Valutazione degli Interventi in Terapia Intensiva). Our study concerned about patients with TBI dismissed from ICU that \"personally\" or by the family will accepted the consensus to be included in our follow up conducted after 6 months from the dismissal. We collected clinical data from the admission to the dismissale and measured impact of TBI on all day life with GOS-E and QOLIBRI-OS using telephonical interview. Results: We collected data about 63 patients, 33 answered to the telephonical follow-up and only 10 compilated the QOLIBRI-OS. We found out that patients admitted with lower GCS has worst outcome in terms of quality of life. It also appears that anisocoria during ICU staying represents an odds ratio for death and is connected with worst quality of life after 6 months from the dismissal (Tables 1 & 2) . Inability to re-start a normal work-activity appeared to be the most important factor on the perception that our patient have of their new lives. Conclusions: Anisocoria seems to be an indicator of severe brain damage. GCS, despite it's simplicity, still represent the best and easiest way to score TBI. Work impairment appear to be the most important disability to determine subjective perception of quality of life after TBI, so efforts have to be made to improve work rehabilitation after the dismissal from hospital. Introduction: Hyperventilation (HV) reduces elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) by changing autoregulatory functions connected to cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity. Criticism to HV is due to the possibility of developing cerebral ischemia and tissue hypoxia because of hypocapnia-induced vasoconstriction. We aimed to investigate the potential adverse effects of moderate HV of short duration in the acute phase in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), using concomitant monitoring of cerebral metabolism, continuous brain tissue oxygen tension (PbrO2), and cerebral hemodynamic with transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD). Methods: A prospective trial was conducted between May 2014 and May 2017 at the University Hospital of Zurich. Adults (>18 years), with non-penetrating TBI, first GCS < 9, ICP-monitoring, PbrO2 and/or microdialysis (MD)-probes were included within 36 hours after injury. Data collection and TCCD measurements took place at baseline (A), at the begin of moderate HV (PaCO2 4-4.7 kPa) (C), after 50 minutes of moderate HV (PaCO2 4-4.7 kPa) (D), and after return to baseline (E) (Fig. 1) . Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare variables at the different time points followed by post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment as appropriate. P-value < .05 was considered significant. Results: Eleven patients were included (64% males, mean age 36 \u00b1 14 years). First GCS was 7 (3-8: median and interquartile range). Data concerning PaCO2, ICP, PbrO2, mean flow velocity (MFV) in the middle cerebral artery, and MD values are presented in Table 1 . During HV, ICP and MFV decreased significantly. PbrO2 presented a trend of reduction. Glucose, lactate and pyruvate did not change significantly ( Table 2) . Conclusions: Short episodes of moderate HV have a potent effect on the cerebral blood flow, as assessed by TCCD, reduce ICP and PbrO2, and do not induce significant changes in cerebral metabolism.",

Cut point of 9 is the best to predict early tracheostomy with sensitivity of 86.1% and specificity of 81.5%. Since no patients had score 9 so the previous analysis that consider cut-point of 8 should remain the same but just change the number in the text to 9 contraindication for pharmacological VTE prophylaxis (65.4%). Overall, NCC patients were more likely to receive mechanical (90.3% ICU days) than pharmacological VTE prophylaxis (74.1% ICU days), however pharmacologic was more likely among younger patients with lower APACHE II scores. Guideline concordant care varied by recommendation; lower for pharmacological and higher for mechanical VTE prophylaxis.",

Hematoma volume was smaller in the early DVT prophylaxis group with 9.5mL (IQR 4-18.5) vs 17.5mL (IQR 8-29) in the late prophylaxis group (p=0.038) without any other significant differences in disease severity.

Early DVT prophylaxis was not independently associated with 3m outcome. Conclusions: Although limited by the retrospective design, our data suggest that early DVT prophylaxis (<48h) may be safe in patients presenting with primary ICH, which supports the recommendations given by the Neurocritical Care Society. Introduction: There is a paucity of literature describing the relationship between clevidipine and its impact on intracranial pressure (ICP). The safety of clevidipine in patients with intracranial hemorrhage is often extrapolated from studies using nicardipine, which has demonstrated a neutral effect on ICP [1] . The objective of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between clevidipine initiation and changes to cerebral hemodynamic parameters.",

Individuals were included if they had intracranial bleeding and ICP data recorded prior to initiation of a clevidipine infusion. Baseline demographic data was collected, including age, gender, type of injury, and initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS Introduction: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is an acute cerebrovascular event with high mortality and is an important cause of neurologic disability among survivors. Many complications in the course of SAH, such as hydrocephalus, also play a role in the poor outcome. The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of patients with SAH admitted to the ICU to evaluate the factors associated with outcome. Methods: This study was conducted in two reference centersone in Rio de Janeiro and one in Porto Alegre. From July 2015 to September 2017, every adult patient admitted to the ICU with aneurysmal SAH was enrolled in the study. Data were collected prospectively during hospital stay. The primary endpoint was mortality and dichotomized functional outcome (poor outcome defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale 1 to 3) at hospital discharge and 12 months. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Results: A total of 261 patients were included. Demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Frequency of clinical and neurological complications are presented in Table 2 . In univariate analysis, factors most frequently seen in patients with unfavorable outcome were seizure (17% vs 3%, p=0.0003), hydrocephalus (51% vs 17%, p<0.0001), meningitis (30% vs 12%, p=0.0004), rebleeding (17% vs 4%, p= 0.0008), vasospasm (46% vs 26%, p=0.001), pneumonia (37% vs 7%, p<0.0001), sepsis/septic shock (21% vs 4%, p<0.0001), postsurgical neurological deterioration (37% vs 18%, p=0.001) and delayed cerebral ischemia (37% vs 12%, p<0.0001). At 12 months, out of 74 patients with follow-up, 40% had poor outcome. Conclusions: SAH is associated with high morbidity. Both neurological complications as clinical complications were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Therapeutic interventions to prevent those may have an impact on clinical outcomes. Introduction: Brain tissue hypoxia (brain tissue oxygen tension, PbtO2<20mmHg) is common after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and associated with poor outcome. Recent data suggest that brain oxygen optimization is feasible and may reduce the time with brain tissue hypoxia to 15% in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [1] . Little is known about the effectiveness of protocolized treatment approaches in poor-grade SAH patients. Methods: We present a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 105 poor-grade SAH patients admitted to 2 tertiary care centers where PbtO2<20mmHg was treated using an institutional protocol. Treatment options were left to the discretion of the treating neuro-intensivists including augmentation of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) using vasopressors if necessary, treatment of anemia and targeting normocapnia, euvolemia and normothermia. The dataset used for analysis was based on routine blood gas analysis for hemoglobin data matched to 2 hourly averaged data of continuous CPP, PbtO2, temperature and cerebral microdialysis (CMD) samples over the first 10 days of admission. Results: Patients were admitted with a GCS of 3 (IQR 3-4) and were 58 (IQR 48-66) years old. Overall incidence of brain tissue hypoxia was 25%. During this time we identified associated episodes of CPP<70mmHg (27%), hyperglycolysis (CMD-lacta-te>4mmol/L, CMD-pyruvate>120\u03bcmol/L; 26%), pCO2<35mmHg (19%), metabolic distress (CMD-lactate-to-pyruvate-ratio>40; 18%), PaO2<80mmHg (14%), Hb<9g/dL (10%), and temperature>38.3\u00b0C (4%) (Fig. 1 ). Of these variables only hyperglycolysis was significantly more common (37%) during episodes of normal PbtO2 (75% of episodes). Conclusions: Underutilization of IVT despite the overwhelming evidence that support the effectiveness of such therapy can be partly attributed to the fear of hemorrhagic complications. This fear is not justified by current data. The estrangement of the emergency medicine community regarding IVT and the domination of stroke experts in decision making is also a barrier.",

Introduction: Deviations from strict eligibility criteria for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in ischemic strokes regarding either license contraindications to alteplase or relative contraindications to thrombolysis have been reported in international literature, with conflicting results on patients' outcome.The aim of our study was to evaluate safety and efficacy for patients receiving IVT outside standard inclusion criteria. Methods: Retrospective analysis of our department's thrombolysis database.We compared 83 patients with strict protocol adherence (strict protocol group) [mean age 63 years and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission 12/range 5-28] and 41 patients with protocol deviations (off-label group) [mean age 68 years and NIHSS at admission 10/range 2-24],in particular 10 patients >80 years old, 13 patients with mild stroke-NIHSS< 5,and 22 with symptom-to-needle time 3-4.5 hours (4 patients had 2 deviations). Results: Patients in the off-label group were older but had no difference in baseline severity scores (SAPSII, NIHSS). They had no statistically significant difference on short-term (NIHSS at 7 days, need for critical care support, primary adverse event) and long-term (mortality,functional outcome at 3 months) outcome measures when compared to standard protocol patients. Conclusions: In accordance with international literature,off-label thrombolysis is save and equally effective to standard protocol thrombolysis.Thrombolysis strict protocol needs expansion of inclusion criteria. Introduction: Most scales (GCS,NIHSS) don't consider the pathway of secondary acute brain failure (sABF). Neuron-specific-enolase (NSE) could be usefull in diagnostic and treatment pts. with sABF [1, 2] . Methods: Prospective study incl. 35 pts. with ABF. Pts. were identical in condition, age and comorbidies. In main group, NSE examed and choline alfoscerate was used, pts. was divided into 2 subgroups Ia (n=12) with acute ischemic stroke(AIS) and Ib (n=10) pts. with posthypoxic encephalopathy. The control group (n=13) pts. with AIS treated by Loc.Protocol \u2116602. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables were fully compared. Pts. examed by ABCDE algorithm, GCS and NIHSS. Brain CT, Carotid Doppler performed. Considering criteria:NSE(days 1,3,5), neurological status, length of stay in ICU (ICU LOS). \"SS-6.0\"was used. Results: The baseline NSE was higher and correlated to NIHSS (16.3 \u00b12.2, \u00f72=1.08) in all pts. In Ia, Ib sbgroups NSE decreased for 3-5 days vs. control group 10-12days (\u00f72=7.93) and correlated with regression neurological deficit. ICU LOS in main group was 3.8\u00b10.9 days vs. control group 5.9\u00b10.9 days. Sensitivity and specificity of NSE as a marker of brain injury in pts. with AIS were 65 and 83% and in posthypoxic pts. were 90 and 90%, respectively, which showed NSE as eligible diagnostic criterion of posthypoxic cerebral edema. In Ia (AIS) pts. and Ib (posthypoxic edema) were confirmed by increasing NSE in 4fold and 9-fold respectively more vs. pts. who had only Brain CT at first day. NSE also correlated with regression neurological deficit and improving of the neurological status. Although, two pts. In IIb group died with NSE 150-220 \u00ecg/ml Conclusions: 1. NSE is an effective marker of the severity of damages even in the sABF, and shoved efficacy efficacy of treatment. 2. Negative outcome can be in pts. with sABF and more 3-fold increasing NSE and increasing up to 150-220 \u00ecg/ml is a mortality predictor. 3. We included NSE in local protocols P405 N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide as a bio-marker of the acute brain injury Introduction: The detection of biomarkers levels facilitates an early diagnosis of brain tissues damage, allows assessing the prognosis of the disease and its outcome, and performs the monitoring of the patient treatment. Methods: We studied 64 patients (36 m, 28 f.). 1st group comprised 12 patients with severe brain trauma: 1asurvivors with good outcome (on Glasgow outcome scale groups I-II) (n=8), 1bdead or severely disabled (on Glasgow outcome scale groups III-V) (n=4). 2nd group comprises 37 patients with intracranial and sub-arachnoid hemorrhages: Assignment to groups 2a (n=14), 2b (n=22) was done using the same criteria as group 1. 3rd group comprises 16 patients operated in conjunction with brain tumor. Assignment to groups 3a (n=6) and 3b (n=10) was done using the same criteria as groups 1 and 2. We tested the level of N-terminal Pro-Brain natriuretic peptide in blood (0-125 pg/ml) between 1st and 3rd days after severe brain injury and then every 2-12 days for the total duration of 21 days. Results: : Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate noticeable difference in the level of NTproBNP between groups 1,2,3. We detected the differences between subgroups (p<0.01). Patients from groups 1a,2a,3a (n=28) NTproBNP level stayed below 700 pg/ml in 20 cases (71%), in the 8 cases (29%) the level was above 700 pg/ml, but by 14-21th day decreased to the normal values. For patients in subgroups 1b,2b,3b (n=36) in 28 cases (78%) NTproBNP level was above 700 pg/ml at least once, in 8 cases (12%) level stayed below 700 pg/ ml but remain high for the entire duration of the study without significant decrease. Conclusions: All the patients with acute brain injury show the increased level of NTproBNP above normal values, irrespective of ethiology of injury. In case when NTproBNP level increases above 700 pg/ml and/or does not decrease to the normal values it is possible to predict a negative outcome. Introduction: Cerebrovascular and coronary artery diseases share many of the same risk factors [1] . Cardiac mortality accounts for 20% of deaths and is the second commonest cause of death in the acute stroke population, second only to neurologic deaths as a direct result of the incident stroke. Methods: This is a prospective observational study from July 2015 to April 2016 done on 80 adult patients (groupI: 50 pts acute ischemic strokes & group II:30 pts as control) in Kafr-Elsheikh general hospital ICU. Inclusion criteria: All patients with acute ischemic stroke while Exclusion criteria: Patients with heart or renal failure/sepsis&septic shock/Ischemic heart disease or Hemorrhagic stroke,full clinical examination&labs including admission quantitative serum cardiac Troponin I ELISA immunoassay,ECG,2D echocardiography&CT brain on day 0&3,Alberta stroke program (ASP) early CT (ASPECT) to predict neurological outcomes and mortality in patient with acute ischemic stroke within 28 days so survivors Vs non-survivors in group 1 were divided to G1A & G1B respectively. Results: Dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus were significant comorbidities in all ischemic stroke pts.TLC, Urea, INR and Troponin were significantly higher in case group Vs control group.GCS was found to be lower in non-survivors at day 0&at 3rd day follow up while ASPECT was significantly lower only at 3rd day follow up.Troponin level was significantly higher in non-survivors G1B, it was also higher in patents who developed convulsion later during their ICU stay& it was significantly inversely correlated to GCS and ASP. troponin had sensitivity 53% and specificity 87% (ROC curve analysis) Conclusions: Troponin level was predictor for mortality in patient with acute ischemic stroke.it is well correlated to GCS and ASP on admission.it was a predictor for occurence of convulsions later in ICU stay. Introduction: Based on examination and treatment of hyperkinetic disorder in patients with UWS and MCS, we supposed that hyperkinesis manifesting the formation of the generator of pathologically enhanced excitation in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, which subsequently causes the formation of hyperkinesis. Halogencontaining anesthetic sevoflurane had a good clinical effect in patients with prolonged impairment of consciousness. Methods: The study included 5 patients with UWS (4 -hypoxia, 1 -encephalitis) and 3 patients with MCS (2 -hypoxia, 1-encephalitis). Hyperkinetic disorder presenting as permanent myoclonus of arms and legs, face. All patients were performed head MRI and EEG (before, during and after anesthesia), CRS-R assessment, 3 patients -[18F]-FGD PET. Initial anesthesia: propofol 2-3 mg/kg, rocuronium bromide (Esmeron) 0, 6 mg/kg, fentanyl 3-5 mg/kg and clonidine (clophelin) 0.5-0.7 mg/kg. Maintenance of anesthesia is carried out due to the following scheme: inhalation anesthesia using Sevoflurane (2.0-3.0 vol%, MAC 0.8-0.9). Additionally, during the 2nd -4th hours of medical anesthesia was prescribed the intravenous injection using Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg/hr. The anesthesia is used during 24 hours. The patients were nurtured by balanced mixtures through nasogastric tube. After 24 hours the patients were gradually transferred to the autonomous breathing. The control clinical and instrumental studies to evaluate the therapy effectiveness (EEG, CRS-R) were performed. Results: In 5 patients (2 MCS, 3 UWS) was observed the hyperkinetic disorder regression as decrease of hyperkinesis manifestation, 3 patients didn't have a significant dynamics. Conclusions: The artificially formed \"pharmacological dominant\" (using sevoflurane and Ketamine) may decrease the activity of pathological system of the brain, which clinically presented as significant decrease of hyperkinesis manifestation in 5 out 8 patients.",

Introduction: We accepted a hypothesis that in some patients UWS is a consequence of a pathologic system (PS), that limits the brain functional activity. Identification of a PS allow to predict consciousness recovery. EEG registration under benzodiazepines test (BT) has become the method of PS identifying in UWS patients. Methods: We examined 145 UWS patients (74 -traumatic, 71 -non traumatic). CRS scales assessment, EEG with BT, MRI of brain were performed for all patients. The midazolamum was administered iv 0.04 mg/kg,.In 3-4 min after BZD was recorded EEG for 15 min. The test was considered to be positive if against the background of BZD EEG pattern restructuring was observed: the low-amplitude EEG activity was rebuilt with the advent of alpha-and beta-spectrum.In patients with slowwave activity of theta-and delta-spectrum appeared stable fast forms, and in patients with baseline polymorphic EEG pattern was recorded prevalence of alpha activity and (or) the alpha rhythm. In order to confirm the correlation between the BZD effect and EEG pattern restructuring, Flumazenil was administrated at rate of 0.1 mg every 1 to 2 minutes until the original EEG pattern has been registered again. Results: The BT was true positive (recovery consciousness in 3-12 month later) in 22 traumatic and 19 non traumatic patients. True negative (permanent UWS 12 month later) in 27 traumatic and 43 non traumatic patients. False positive -11 traumatic, 4 non traumatic. False negative 14 traumatic, 5 non traumatic patients. Sensitivity BT to VS/UWS = 74.6% Sensitivity to MCS = 43.1% Conclusions: Our data confirmed the correctness of hypothesis that a PS limits the activity of the brain in patients in a UWS. We proposed diagnostic method of a PS activity and suppression. Apparently, BZD are the drugs of first stage examination choice in the treatment of UWS patients.",

Although Brain Ultrasound is widely used to study the intracranial vessels and other issues, it is still not clear the homogeneity of the skills required in both Neuro and General ICU in Italy. The aim of this study is to explore the use of US-TCD and validate a collection of criterea which would prove useful in any future national wide survey. Methods: Starting from Sept. 2017 the seven Center involved (Bologna, Catania, Pisa, Verona, Bergamo, Cesena, Roma) collected clinical and sonographic data, basing on a CRF of twenty criteria such as: kind of hospital and ICU, number of beds and neuro-patients/year, the physicians specialization trained to perform US-TCD, the kind of US doppler device used and the kind of training course followed. As a second step, data were analyzed by coordination team, as third step, during annual SIAARTI conference, these Centers had a deep discussion on these selected items, further modifying and adapting the content of the items. Results: The result is a ready list of 20 items, an available tool for all the participant Centers, that are going to start with an internal test survey for a final validation. Conclusions: There is more than one path to train a physician on Brain US in Italy and there are new possible applications, even outside of the Neuro sub-speciality. From the preliminary discussion, it is clear that in Italy we have a inhomogeneous frame of training and use. This group of study believes that among the anesthesiologists/intensivists, it is possible to find a useful number of physicians interested in training on this topic. The main aim is the production of a validated criterea collection, available for eventually future national survey, useful to help map out the real national training needs in Italy on US Brain.",

We present data on all perinatal patients who required ICU admission for Neurosurgical conditions over an 8 year period. Our data presents an insight into the incidence and outcome of Neurosurgical conditions during pregnancy Methods: Searching our database identified 11 pregnant and 8 recently pregnant patients admitted to ICU with neurosurgical conditions. Patient data was collected retrospectively by review of charts and of an electronic database. A further 12 pregnant patients were admitted for Neurosurgical intervention but did not require critical care. Results: Intracranial haemorrhage was the most common diagnosis (5 subarachnoid haemorrhage and 5 had intra-cerebral haemorrhage). 6 patients presented with intracranial tumours and 1 patient had a traumatic brain injury. 1 patient was admitted post spinal tumour resection. 1 patient was referred with an ischemic stroke after iatrogenic injury to the carotid and vertebral artery. The requirement for organ support in this cohort of patients was high; 64% required ventilation and 45% inotropes. 13 patients underwent neurosurgical intervention & 6 medical treatment. 2 maternal deaths occurred at 16 & 37 weeks gestation. The modified Rankin Score (mRS) on discharge from hospital was <= 2 for 9 of the 17 surviving patients (median=3). Of the 11 pregnancies (all singleton) there were 3 foetal deaths. 1 patient miscarried spontaneously at 4 weeks, 1 had a medical termination of pregnancy at 12 weeks to facilitate chemotherapy and 1 foetus died after maternal death at 16 weeks. The 8 remaining patients delivered normal babies. Conclusions: Neurosurgical disease requiring ICU admission during pregnancy is rare; our data suggest an incidence of 1 case per 2 million population. Maternal outcomes were mixed with more than half having a mRS>2 on discharge. Foetal outcomes were good with only one miscarriage and good neurological outcome in all surviving infants. Stepwise multivariable analyses that included interaction between time of day and arrest location were performed in a stepwise manner. Results: Prehospital ALS (adjusted OR, 1.63; 95%CI, 1.38-1.93) but not good-quality of bystander-performed CCs (1.02, 0.84-1.26) was associated with sustained return of circulation (ROSC). Neither provison of good-quality CCs nor prehospital ALS was a major factor associated with on-month survival. However, good-quality of bystanderperformed CCs (2.44, 1.81-5.00) in addition to shockable rhythm (13.3; 8.70-20.4) and bystander-witnessed OHCA (4.79; 2.98-8.00) were associated with higher chances of neurologically favourable one-year survival, whereas prehospital ALS (0.21; 0.10-0.39) and elderly OHCA (0.47; 0.31-0.73) were associated with lower chances of the survival (Fig. 1) . The impact of good quality CCs on survival were preserved in bystander-witnessed OHCAs with shockable initial rhythm. Noncentral region (adjusted OR for good-quality, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.39-0.54), lack of BLS training experience (0.47; 0.36-0.62), elderly-only rescuers (0.53; 0.44-0.65), CC initiation following dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (0.71; 0.55-0.91), and female-only rescuer (0.77; 0.65-0.90) were associated with poor-quality CCs. CC quality in athome OHCAs remained low throughout the day, whereas that in outof-home OHCAs decreased during night-time.",

At the end of 2011, Ishikawa Medical Control Council implemented new criteria for start of chest compressions encouraging EMS to start chest compressions when carotid pulse was week and/or <50/min in comatose adult patient with respiratory arrest or agonal breathing. Methods: Data were prospectively collected for out-of-hospital cardiac and respiratory arrests during the period of 2008-2015. Definitive cardiac arrest was recorded when loss of carotid pulse was confirmed by pulse checks performed every 2 min after the early start of chest compressions. The effect of early chest compressions on the proportions of definitive cardiac arrest was analysed in 243 cases with respiratory arrest and circulatory depression in initial patient evaluation. Before/after comparison of neurologically favourable 1-Y survival was performed in 619 cases with EMS-witnessed OHCA. Results: The early start of chest compressions did not significantly prevent definitive cardiac arrest that followed respiratory arrest with circulatory depression in the initial patient evaluation (Fig. 1) . Time interval between start of chest compressions and definitive cardiac arrest confirmation (median; IQR) was 2; 1.5-3 min. The survival rate of all EMS-witnessed OHCAs after the implementation of new criteria was significantly higher than that before the implementation: adjusted OR; 95% CI, 1.86; 1.02-3.40 (Fig. 2) . No complications related to early chest compressions were reported during the study period. Conclusions: Start of chest compressions before definitive cardiac arrest improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest witnessed by emergency medical service. Healthcare providers including EMS personnel should be encouraged to provide chest compressions on cases with respiratory arrest and severe cardiovascular depression. Introduction: Our study sought to determine if there is a difference in time to tracheal intubation between direct and video laryngoscopy during cardiac compressions. Guidelines suggest no more than 5 seconds should be taken to perform intubation to minimise any delay in compressions [1, 2] . It is unclear if use of video laryngoscopes results in faster intubation times during cardiac arrest. Methods: Observational trial involving Emergency, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care doctors. Participants' baseline data obtained by questionnaire. Resusci-Anne\u2122 manikin with Airway Trainer\u2122 head [Laerdal] with grade 1 airway was utilised. Participants intubated the manikin 3 times, once with each of: MacIntosh size 3 blade, C-Mac video laryngoscope (Karl Storz, Germany) with size 3 blade and portable McGrath MAC enhanced video laryngoscope (Medtronic, USA) with size 3 blade. Order of laryngoscopes was randomised by computer generated sequence. Continuous cardiac compressions were performed throughout attempts. Results: Total 54 participants. There was a statistically significant difference in time to intubation between the 3 devices using Friedman test (p<0.01). Wilcox signed-rank test demonstrated time to intubation with videolaryngoscopy was longer, C-Mac (p=0.032) and",

Faster intubation times with direct laryngoscopy could result in less pause in compressions and decrease periods without perfusion.

Patients without ST-elevation were separated into groups with specified ECG changes and comorbidities. Differences were observed in the incidence of any significant stenosis, total occlusion and PCI performed, between the specified ECG changes, as well as between the comorbidity groups ( Introduction: Fewer women after return of spontaneous circulation from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) are undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) with possible Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The aim was to investigate gender differences in comorbidity, CAG findings and outcome after OHCA in comatose patients with a shockable first ECG rhythm. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with data retrieved between 2008-2013 from national registries in Sweden (Fig. 1) . Results: There was no difference in age or comorbidity except for men having more ischemic heart disease, 21.5 vs 15.0% (p=0.006). Rates of previous myocardial infarction did not differ, 8.2 vs 6.3%. No difference was seen in rates of ECG indicating prompt CAG according to guidelines. Still, more men underwent CAG but no difference in numbers of CAG leading to PCI was seen (Table 1) . Furthermore, in patients with ST elevation or LBBB, no gender difference in CAG and subsequent PCI was found. Men had lower rates of normal CAG findings but more triple vessel and left main coronary artery disease ( Table 2) . 1 year survival did not differ, 49.1 vs 45.0%. Conclusions: Our study suggests, that despite no gender differences in rate of ECG findings indicating a prompt CAG, men seems to have a more severe coronary artery disease while women have more frequently normal angiograms. However, this did not influence 1 year survival. Introduction: The circadian clock influences a number of cardiovascular physiological processes. A time-of-day variation in infarct size has recently been shown in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, there is no clinical evidence of circadian variation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of cardiac etiology. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis using data from Japan's nationwide OHCA registry from January 2005 through December 2012, which includes all OHCA patients presented with ventricular fibrillation as first documented rhythm, and consequently confirmed cardiac etiology. In order to eliminate the night and weekend effects, we enrolled only patients suffered OHCA in the morning We conduct a retrospective cohort study focusing on the association between OHCA outcome and ICU bed availability. The OHCA data was acquired from a regional emergency operation center, and the ICU bed information was obtained from a regional sur it exceeds physiological levels in order to avoid insufficient oxygenation [1] . Hyperoxia has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality, though uncertainty remains about this association. Multiwave pulse co-oximetry has safely been studied intraoperatively as a guide to monitor hyper-and hypoxia by calculating an oxygen reserve index (ORI) which could add information to pulse oximetry measures when SpO2 is >98% [2] .",

In this context, the aim of metabolomics is to improve early diagnosis, classification, and prediction over the development of a pathological condition. To this end, metabolomics have not been used in the characterisation of cardiac arrest (CA), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and return of spontaneous resuscitation (ROSC). The aim of the present study was to explore whether metabolomics can characterize the CA versus ROSC in a swine model of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Methods: Ten animals were intubated and instrumented and VF was induced with the use of a cadmium battery. VF was left untreated for 6min and the animals were then resuscitated according to the 2010 guidelines. Defibrillation was attempted in all animals. Venous blood was drown at baseline, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min during untreated CA and finally at 2min, 30min, 2h, 6h after ROSC in order to determine the metabolomic profile during CA and during the early post-resuscitation period. ROSC was defined as the presence of an organized cardiac rhythm with a mean arterial pressure of at least 50 mmHg for >5 min. Blood was centrifuged and serum was analysed by high resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectral data were submitted to multivariate discriminant analysis.",

The 3 measured phases are shown in Fig. 1 Introduction: Early outcome prognostication in successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients remains challenging. Prediction models supporting the early decision to continue with full supportive treatment could be of major interest following OHCA. We constructed prognostic models able to predict good neurologic outcome within 48 hours after ICU admission. Methods: Upon ICU admission, targeted temperature management at 33\u00b0C, hemodynamic and neuromonitoring (cerebral oxygen saturation measured with near-infrared spectroscopy and bispectral index (BIS)) was initiated. Prediction models for good neurologic outcome at 180 days post-CA were constructed at hour 1, 12, 24 and 48 after admission using variables easily collectable and known to be predictive for outcome. After multiple imputation, variables were selected using the elastic-net method. Each imputed dataset was divided into training and validation sets (80% and 20% of patients, respectively). Cut-off probabilities yielding a sensitivity above 90% were determined and performance of all logistic regression models was assessed using misclassification rates. Introduction: In many venues, EMS crews limit on-scene care for pediatric out-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA), attempting treatment during transport. Hypothesizing that neuro-intact survival can be improved by prioritizing on-site care, strategies were effected to expedite on-scene drug delivery and intubation (with controlled ventilation). Methods: From 1/1/2012 to 4/30/2017, data for POHCA cases were collected. In 2014, new training prioritized on-site resuscitation (Phase I) using expedited drug delivery and intubation with controlled ventilation (~6 breaths/min). Training included psychological and skills-enhancing tools to boost confidence in providing on-scene care. In 2016, drugs were prepared while responding (Phase II). 2010 American Heart Association guidelines were used throughout and no other modifications were made. Neuro-intact survival in 2012-13 was compared to Phase I & II outcomes. Results: Over the 5.33-years, EMS faced 143 consecutive POHCA cases. The great majority presented in asystole throughout. In those resuscitated, mean time from on-scene arrival to the 1st epinephrine infusion fell from 16.5 min (2012-13) to 7.3 min (Phase I) and 5.0 min (Phase II). By 2017, it was 2 min. for resuscitated patients and 3.33 min. for all patients. Intubation and intraosseous insertion occurred more frequently in Phase I/II, but there were no significant differences in age, sex, etiology, response times, bystander CPR or drug sequencing. Neuro-intact survival improved significantly from 0/38 in 2012-13 to 23.2% (13/56) in Phase I and 34.7% (17/49) in Phase II (p < 0.0001; 2-tailed Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 1) . Conclusions: Although historically-controlled, the sudden appearance of neuro-intact survivors following a renewed focus on rapid on-site care was profound, immediate and sustained. Beyond skillsenhancing strategies, physiologically-driven techniques and supportive encouragement from leadership, pre-arrival psychological and clinical tools were also likely contributors to the observed outcomes.

Combined with devices that enhance venous return out of the brain and into the thorax during CPR, outcomes have improved using head/chest elevation in the laboratory (Fig. 1) . This study's purpose was to confirm the safety/clinical feasibility of this new approach involving mechanical CPR at an angle. Methods: 2,285 consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) cases (all rhythms) were studied for 3.5 years (1/1/14 to 30/6/17) in an expansive, socio-economically-diverse U.S. county (pop. 1.4 mill). In 2014, EMS crews used the Lucas\u00a9 and impedance threshold (ITD) devices on such patients, but, after April 2015, they also: 1) applied O2 and deferred +-pressure ventilation several min; 2) raised the backboard~20\u00b0; and 3) solidified a pit-crew approach to expedite Lucas\u00a9 placement. Neuro-intact survival was not recorded until 2015, so resuscitation by EMS to hospital admission was used for consistency. Quarterly reports were run to identify any periodic variations or incremental effects during protocol transition (Quarter 2, 2015). Results: No problems were observed with head/torso-up positioning (n=1,319), but rates of resuscitation rose steadily during the transition period with an ensuing sustained doubling (Fig. 2 ) over the ensuing 2 years when compared to those studied (n=806) prior to the head-up approach (mean 35.2%; range 30-40% vs. 17.9%, range 15-20%; p < 0.0001). Outcomes improved across subgroups. Response intervals, indications for attempting CPR and bystander CPR rates were unchanged. Resuscitation rates in 2015-17 remained proportional to neuro-intact survival. Conclusions: The head/torso-up CPR bundle was not only feasible, but also associated with an immediate, steady rise in resuscitation rates during the transition phase with a sustained doubling of resuscitation rates, making a compelling case that this bundled technique may improve OOHCA outcomes in future clinical trials. Introduction: Cardiac arrest (CA) often requires intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, which is costly. While there are plenty of data regarding post-CA outcomes, knowledge of cardiac arrest associated healthcare costs is virtually non-existent. Methods: We performed a single-center registry-based study to determine expenditure data for ICU-treated CA patients between 2005 and 2013. Healthcare cost evaluation included costs from the initial hospital treatment, rehabilitation costs and social security costs up to one year post-CA. We calculated mean healthcare costs for one year survivors and for hospital survivors who died within the first year after cardiac arrest. We calculated effective costs per independent survivor (ECPIS) as an indicator of cost-effectiveness. We adjusted all costs according to consumer price index (CPI) in Finland as of 2013. All costs are presented as 2013 euros (\u20ac). Results: We identified 1,314 CA patients eligible for the analyses.",

One year survival stratified by cardiac arrest location group was 59% for out-ofhospital CA patients, 47% for in-hospital CA patients and 27% for in-ICU CA patients. For the whole study population, mean healthcare costs were 50,211\u20ac per patient. Healthcare costs for hospital survivors were 67,928\u20ac per patient and for hospital non-survivors 22,100\u20ac per patient. Healthcare costs for those who survived to hospital discharge but died within the first year were 56,490\u20ac per patient, while for one year survivors they were 70,148\u20ac per patient. Healthcare costs stratified by CA location are presented in Fig. 1 . Mean ECPIS were 65,684\u20ac. Conclusions: For ICU-treated cardiac arrest patients, the mean ECPIS were close to 65,000\u20ac. The best prognosis and the lowest costs were observed for out-of-hospital CA patients. Introduction: In Lithuania the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is unknown, as there is no official coding for OHCA as a cause of death in the national death registry. Kaunas Emergency Medical Service (EMS) underwent major stepwise changes since 2011, including implementation of Medical Priority Dispatch System and dispatcher-assisted CPR instructions. We sought to describe the epidemiology and outcomes from OHCA in Kaunas, the second largest Lithuanian city. Methods: The incidence, demographics and outcomes of patients who were treated for an OHCA between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2016 in Kaunas EMS, serving a population of almost 0.3 million, were collected and are reported in accordance with 2014 Utstein recommendations. Results: In total, 313 OHCA cases of EMS treated cardiac arrests were reported (105 per 100.000 of resident population). The mean age was 67.7 (SD=15.7) years and 64.9% were male. 70% OHCA cases occurred at home and 52.7% were witnessed by either EMS or a bystander. In non-EMS witnessed cases, 43.8% received bystander CPR, whilst public access defibrillation was not used. Medical dispatcher identified OHCA in 71.3% of all cases and provided over-the-phone CPR instructions in 60.2% of them. Average EMS response time (90% fractile) was 13 min. Cardiac aetiology was the leading cause of cardiac arrest (84.3%). The initial rhythm was shockable (VF or pVT) in 26% and non-shockable (asystole or EMD) in 70.5% of all cases. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital transfer was evident in 24.9% and survival to hospital discharge was 8.6%. Conclusions: ROSC and survival to hospital discharge in Kaunas were similar to those reported in United Kingdom in 2014 [1] . Routine OHCA data collection and analysis will allow us to track the efficiency of service improvements and should become a standard practice in all Lithuanian regions.",

Outcomes are often poor, with unadjusted survival to hospital discharge at 18.4%, following an in hospital cardiac arrest [1] . The aim of the study was to assess the survival of patients admitted to intensive care following a cardiac arrest, reviewing whether age and gender impacted on their outcome. Methods: The INARC database for a general intensive care unit (ICU) at a district general hospital was reviewed. Since 1993, 519 patients were admitted following a cardiac arrest (both in and out of hospital). Their age, gender and survival to ICU discharge and overall hospital discharge were recorded. Results: 210 female patients and 309 male patients of varying ages were admitted to our ICU following a cardiac arrest. The mortality for both genders increased with increasing age. Overall survival to the time of ICU discharge following a cardiac arrest was similar for both females (44.3%) and males (48.5%). Figures 1 (female) and 2 (male) below show the number of patients who survived or died on ICU discharge, by age and gender. Mortality rates increased when reviewing hospital outcome, as some patients died following discharge to the ward. Conclusions: Overall mortality in our ICU following a cardiac arrest at any age is at least 50%, with the general trend appearing to rise with increasing age. More male patients were admitted to ICU following a cardiac arrest than female, with similar survival rates for both male and female patients. More research could be undertaken to assess whether survival rates following a cardiac arrest have improved since 1993 and also to compare outcomes following either an in or out of hospital arrest. Introduction: Raw simplified EEG tracings obtained by a bispectral index (BIS) device significantly correlate with standard EEG [1] . This study aimed to investigate whether simplified BIS EEG tracings can predict poor neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest (CA). Methods: Bilateral BIS monitoring (BIS VISTATM, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. Norwood, USA) was started following ICU admission. Six, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48hrs after targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33\u00b0C was started, raw simplified BIS EEG tracings were extracted and reviewed by two neurophysiologists for the presence of burst suppression, cerebral inactivity and epileptic activity. At 180 days post-CA, neurologic outcome was determined using the CPC scale, where a CPC1-2 and CPC3-5 corresponded to good and poor neurologic outcome, respectively. Results: Of the 75 enrolled CA-patients enrolled, 40 had good and 35 poor neurologic outcome. With a positive predictive value (PPV) of 1.000 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.606, epileptic activity within 6-12hrs predicted a CPC3-5 with the highest accuracy. Epileptic activity within time frames 18-24hrs and 36-48hrs showed a PPV for poor outcome of 0.917 and 0.938, respectively. Cerebral inactivity within 6-12hrs had a poor predictive power (PPV=0.545, NPV=0.566). In contrast, cerebral inactivity between 36-48hrs predicted a CPC3-5 with a PPV of 1.000 and a NPV of 0.597. The pattern with the worst predictive power at any time point was burst suppression with a PPV of 0.363, 0.529 and 0.500 at 6-12hrs, at 18-24hrs and at 36-48hrs, respectively.",

Total time of aircraft usage was higher for TIH (39%), followed by NEO (32%). EVAM was the most frequent mission, however it accounted for 29% of aircraft utilization time, where most victims had traumatic brain injury (TBI) followed by other traumatic injuries (216 and 187 cases respectively). TBI victims were predominantly males (83%) with a median age of 30(IQR=23) years. Most commonly, TBI is a consequence of transportation accident (75%), where a motorcycle was involved in 31%, car collision in 24% and pedestrian run over 24% of the cases. Conclusions: GOA utilizes the air ambulance helicopter as a first response tool in 49% of total missions, where respect for the Trauma Golden Hour is paramount. Traumatic brain injury is the most prevalent diagnosis at the scene of event. Therefore, GOA training and equipment must be tailored to meet this demand, which translates in stabilization of critical patients outside hospital environment with limited resources. Introduction: The intra-hospital transport of critical patients is associated with adverse events and worse outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of intrahospital transport after the creation of a specific group for this purpose. Methods: Evaluated all the transports of critical patients from October 2016 to September 2017, in a large hospital, after the creation of a group consisting of intensive care physician, nurse and physiotherapist. Clinical and non-clinical complications related to the transport and outcome of the patients were evaluated. Results: A total of 1,559 transports were performed, 54.7% of the male patients and 60.9% of the patients being hospitalized. 10.6% were under mechanical ventilation and 19.8% under vasoactive drugs. At the time of transport, 78.8% were clinically stable. During transport, 7.5% presented clinical complications, being more frequent hemodynamic instability (43 patients) and respiratory failure (21 patients). Non-clinical complications occurred in 125 patients (8.0%), and communication failures were responsible for 79.2% of the occurrences. In 29 cases (1.9%) there was worsening of the clinical conditions during transportation, and in only one case this worsening resulted in an increase in the length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, with no correlation with deaths. Conclusions: The implantation of a group specialized in critical patients to carry out in-hospital transport made the process safer with complications rates lower than literature and guarantee better quality of care.",

Methods: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for acute intoxication who required admission to the ICU of the Regional Hospital of Malaga between January 2012 and August 2016, older than 14 years with admission to the ICU for intoxication of any kind. We study patient characteristics in terms of age, sex and medical history, type of toxicity, severity and evolution in our unit. Results: We found 70 cases of patients who required admission to the ICU due to acute intoxication, of which 55.6% were women. The average age was 47.36 (standard deviation 18.22). The average stay in ICU was 5.04 (standard deviation 8.09). 54.2% of patients had a psychiatric history. As other background highlights, 19.4% were addicted to illegal drugs and 25% were hypertensive. Most patients took more than one toxic 83.3% and intoxication was voluntary in 84.7% versus accidental in 12. 5% of cases. The toxic was known in 68%. The most used benzodiazepines in 26.4% of the total. The main cause of admission to the ICU was due to neurological deterioration in 49 of the cases registered and mechanical ventilation was necessary in 44 patients. The maximum time in mechanical ventilation was 34 days. The infection occurred in 24.3%, with the majority being respiratory infection. The 4.7% died in ICU. The hospital stay presented an average of 9.3 days. Conclusions: The profile of a patient admitted to the ICU due to acute intoxication is that of a woman of middle age and psychiatric history, with voluntary intoxication of several toxic substances and requiring mechanical ventilation for a low level of consciousness for an average of 3 days. The survival is very high and it would be necessary to analyze the possible relapses of these patients.",

Amanita phalloides (A. phalloides) is responsible for the 20% of the mortality in adults caused by mushroom poisoning. It causes damage in liver, kidneys and rarely pancreas, causing encephalopathic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock and death but its effect on cardiac functions has not been established yet. There are three main groups of toxins;phallotoxins, virotoxins and amatoxins;amatoxin is the common responsible toxin from the fatality. We aimed to present a 44-year-old woman poisoned by mushroom complicated with hepatic,renal and cardiac toxicity Methods: Patient with nausea and vomiting started 48 hours after mushroom eating,creatine kinase MB 2.73 ng/mL and cardiac troponin I 0.02 ng/mL Her blood urea nitrogen, creatinine levels and liver enzymes were higher than upper limits in lab tests (Table 1) ; she was admitted to ICU, treated for acute renal failure by hemodialysis.Plasmapheresis was applied against potent mushroom toxins. At 5.day in ICU, hypoxemia and severe swelling resistant to ultrafiltration was evaluated as a global left ventricular hypokinesia with ejection fraction(EF) 20%, end-diastolic diameter of 5.9 cm, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) of 40 mmHg. Oxygen was administrated to treatment.Urine output improved at 6.day, three more plasmapheresis sessions were performed. hypoxemia was recovered,liver enzymes and creatinin levels decreased Results: At control EF measured was 44%, end-diastolic diameter of 4.9 cm, SPAP of 25 mmHg.than at the 15.day patient discharged from the ICU.After a year follow up assessment she has no complaints Conclusions: One of the major problems for amanita poisoning is diagnosis. Patients who had mushroom poisoning should also be evaluated especially in terms of cardiac dysfunction with clinic signs, ECG, cardiac enzyme tests and ECO Introduction: The characterization of clinical and/or biological variables found in the emergency room predictive of a secondary admission in ICU would help to improve the identification of patients at risk of aggravation in order to avoid the associated consequences, such as, an increased mortality and increased hospital stay. Methods: This is a retrospective monocentric study of 3 years with patients admitted secondarily to a medical ICU within 48 hours of admission to the general wards from the emergency department in the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris. Each case was matched to 2 controls. 62 different variables were collected in the emergency room. Results: 319 patients, of whom 107 were cases and 212 controls were studied. Pneumonia is the diagnosis the most frequent in cases followed by sepsis (in 23 and 16%, respectively). 6 Conclusions: The risk of being admitted secondarily to intensive care is higher if patients consult for dyspnea or fever, if they are old smokers, if they have a high IGS2 score, if an arterial blood gas is requested and if an ICU medical advice is taken. The MEDS score under 7 and being an active smoker seems to be protects for the unexpected transfer. Introduction: Managing the special needs of patients who present with agitation or psychosis can pose a greater challenge to an already busy emergency department as their symptoms can escalate rapidly. Traditional antipsychotics used in the ED, such as haloperidol or ziprasidone often do not fully relieve patient's symptoms and may require administration of repeat doses or additional medications such as benzodiazepines to achieve effective results. This can induce excess sedation which can lead to longer length of stay in the ED and requires additional time at the bedside by the ED physicians and staff to manage these patients. Adasuve\u00ae is an antipsychotic drug that works in a single-use device providing an aerosol form of Loxapine that is rapidly absorbed by the lungs which may offer faster symptom relief, allowing subsequent earlier psychiatric evaluation and disposition.",

            "text": "Clinical work in language-discordant Emergency Department Introduction: Emergency residents are particularly vulnerable to sleep deprivation due to persistent conflicts between work schedule and the biological clock. Recent approaches to address fatiguerelated risk mainly focused on reducing work hours and ensuring sufficient recuperation time. Such approach has demonstrated its limits due to growing emergency rooms visits and emergency residents' shortage. Dawson & McCulloch (2005) introduced the notion of proofing as a complementary approach to manage fatigue-related risk [1] . Fatigue proofing strategies (FPS) aim to reduce the likelihood a fatigued operator will make an error, in contrast of reduction strategies (FRS) aiming to reduce the likelihood a fatigued operator is working. Most formal risk control systems do not encompass the notion of proofing and FPS typically develop as informal practices. In this study, we aim to 1) identify informal reduction and proofing strategies used by residents and 2) to investigate how they relate to fatigue-related risk indicators. Methods: First, we organized 4 focus-group with a total of 25 residents in order to identify informal strategies used to manage fatigue-related risk. Second, we designed a questionnaire assessing the frequency of use of each reported strategy. Introduction: This randomized controlled study assessed the impact of a 3-hour intravenous medication safety simulation-based learning (SBL) on self-efficacy, stress, knowledge and skills of nursing students. Medication administration error is a worldwide concern [1], that has been linked with a lack of knowledge and skills in safe medication administration among new graduate and student nurses [2] [3] [4] . Preventing medication errors could therefore involve training through simulation. Methods: Participants (n=99) were randomly assigned either to the control group (CG, n=50) or the experimental group (EG, n=49). While CG and EG both had a traditional clinical internship, EG beneficiated in addition the 3-hour SBL, using standardized patients in the context of an intensive care unit. The two groups were assessed twice: at T0 and T1 (four weeks later), through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and questionnaires. Two blinded experts rated the students OSCE with an evaluation grid. Results: Mean participants age was 21,2. There were no statistically differences between groups at T0. Compared to the CG (0%), the EG increased its self-efficacy (+19.35%) with a significantly difference (p<0.001) at T1. The SBL conducted to a greater increase of knowledge and skills in the EG (respectively +150%, +128%) than in the CG (respectively +46% and +47%), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Results reinforce the interest of a short SBL using standardized patients to improve medication administration. Clinical impact of these observations requires further evaluation to determine potential transfer in clinical settings and retention over time. Introduction: Medication errors occur frequently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and during care transitions. Medication reconciliation by a pharmacist could be useful to prevent such errors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of medication reconciliation at the ICU. Methods: A prospective 8-month intervention study with a pre-and post-phase was performed in Haga Teaching Hospital (2013) and Erasmus University Medical Center (2014). The intervention consisted of medication reconciliation by pharmacists at ICU admission and discharge. The severity of potential harm of the medication transfer errors (MTE) (pADE=0; 0.01; 0.1; 0.4; 0.6) was scored. Primary outcome measures were the proportions of patients with >= 1 MTE at ICU admission and ICU discharge. Secondary outcome measures were the proportions of patients with a pADE score >= 0.01, the severity of the pADEs and a cost-benefit analysis. Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Table 1 shows patient characteristics. Figure 1 shows the primary outcome measures (ORadj admission =0.18 [95% CI 0.11-0.30] and ORadj discharge = 0.24 [95% CI 0.15-0.37]). The proportion of patients with a pADE >=0.01 at ICU admission reduced from 34.8% to 8.0% and after ICU discharge from 69.5% to 36.2%. The pADE reduction resulted in a potential net cost benefit of \u20ac 103 per patient. Conclusions: Medication reconciliation by pharmacists at ICU transfers is an effective safety intervention, leading to a significant decrease in the number of errors and a cost effective reduction of potential adverse drug events. Introduction: In intensive care unit, administration of numerous drugs in ICU patients via a central venous catheter provide a high risk of drugs incompatibilities. It has been reported in experimental studies [1] that particles issued of drug incompatibilities could induce thrombogenesis, microcirculation impairment and inflammatory response which could aggravate the occurrence of organ dysfunctions [2] . The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of particles by reproducing in vitro the intravenous system and the drugs combination used in ICU for patients suffering either septic shock or Acute Respiratory distress Syndrome (ARDS). Methods: First, we registered during a period of 6 months the most common central venous catheter system used in patients admitted for septic shock or ARDS in three University Hospital in Lille. The second part of the study was to reproduce in vitro the previous infusion system in order to quantify the amount of particles generated during a simulated period of 8 hours infusion. The egress of the IV line was connected to a dynamic particle counter QicPIC analyser (Sympatec Inc ; Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany) (Fig. 1) . Results: The most common intravenous system observed was a three lumen central catheter. The proximal lumen was dedicated for vasoactive agents, the medial lumen for sedation and the distal lumen for the other drugs infused continuously and discontinuously..Among the drugs infused via the distal lumen of the central venous catheter, Introduction: Insufficient identification of possible organ donors in the ICU is one of the main factors contributing to the loss of donors after brain death [1] . Up to 50% of potential donors might not be identified [2] . The aim of this study was to evaluate how active search of possible brain dead donors affect the potential deceased donor pool. Methods: The strategy implemented at university hospital with 5 specialized ICUs from December 2016 to October 2017 and data compared to the matching period of the previous year. Donor coordinator visited all ICUs every day and selected patients who met possible brain dead donor criteria: 1) GCS <= 5; 2) severe brain injury. All data registered in original color coded follow-up system according to the patient status.",

This study was aimed to elucidate the clinical factors associated with ICU mortality of advanced lung cancer patients and the effect of intensivist's contribution on their clinical outcomes. Methods: We included patients with advanced lung cancer including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with stage IIIB or IV and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with extensive stage who admitted to ICU from 2005 to 2016. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to find the variables associated with ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality. We applied autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) for time-series analysis of the intenvention of intensivists. Results: Among total 264 patients with advanced lung cancer, 85 patients (32.2%) were admitted ICU before introduction of organized intensive care at 2011, and 179 (67.8%) were admitted after 2011 (Fig.  1) . The leading cause of admission was the respiratory failure (77.7%) and cancer-related event (34.5%) in terms of intensivist's and oncologist's perspective. Before and after 2011, the 30-day ICU mortality rate was 43.5% and 40.2% (p = 0.610), and the hospital mortality rate changed from 82.4% to 65.9% (p = 0.006) (Fig. 2) Introduction: Decisions when to refer and to admit patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) care are very challenging. Demand typically exceeds supply in ICU beds, which results in a constant need for evaluation of the processes involved in ICU referral and admission with a view to optimising resource allocation and patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the theoretical impact of a newly designed triage tool for ICU referrals on a cohort of patients referred to ICU (Fig. 1) . Methods: We reviewed all patients consecutively referred to our ICU, whether admitted or not, in February 2017. Demographics, referring speciality, role of the referrer, comorbidities, the presence of advanced disease or terminal illness, the presence of acute organ failure, DNR status, reason for not admitting, and ICU mortality were recorded. A retrospective analysis of ICU referrals using a pilot triage tool was carried out independently by three authors. Results: Forty-six patients were referred to our ICU over the study period. Of these, 34 (74%) were admitted. Patients were declined ICU if their admission was deemed unnecessary (50%), futile (33%), or were transferred due to bed shortage (16%). Of the patients referred, 25 (54%) had an advanced disease or a terminal illness. Of those, 18 (72%) were admitted, DNR status was unclear in 22 (88%), family was involved in 12 (48%) and their ICU mortality was 48%. By analysing retrospectively these referrals with the aid of a triage tool, we propose that the overall referrals could have decreased from 46 to 30 (42% percentage difference). DNR status and family involvement would have been clarified in all patients with advanced disease or terminal illness before ICU referral. Kappa score for inter-rater agreement was 0.78. Conclusions: Adopting a triage tool for ICU referrals could reduce the overall proportion of inappropriate referrals and admissions. End-of-life discussion would also be proactively clarified prior to ICU admission. Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) admission triage occurs frequently worldwide and often involves decisions with high subjectivity, possibly leading to potentially inappropriate ICU admissions. In this study, we evaluated the effect of implementing a decision-aid tool for ICU triage on ICU admission decisions. Methods: Urgent ICU referrals before (May, 2014 to November, 2014, phase 1) and after (November, 2014 to May, 2015, phase 2) the implementation of a decision-aid tool were prospectively evaluated. Our primary outcome was the proportion of potentially inappropriate ICU referrals (defined as priority 4B or 5 patients, as described by the 1999 or 2016 Society of Critical Care Medicine [SCCM] guidelines) that were admitted to the ICU in 48 hours following referral. We conducted multivariate analyses to adjust for potential confounders, and evaluated the interaction between phase and triage priorities to assess for differential effects in each priority strata. Results: Of 2374 urgent ICU referrals, 110 (5%), 161 (7%), 284 (13%), 726 (33%) and 928 (42%) were categorized as priorities 4B, 4A, 3, 2 and 1 (SCCM 1999) or 110 (4.6%), 115 (4.8%), 887 (37%), 169 (7%) and 928 (39%) were categorized as priorities 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 (SCCM 2016), respectively. Overall, 1184 (54%) patients were admitted to the ICU in 48 hours following referral. The implementation of the decision-aid tool was associated with a reduction of admission of potentially inappropriate ICU referrals [adjOR (95% CI) = 0.36 (0.13-0.97), p = 0.043] (Fig. 1) . There was no difference on hospital mortality for the overall cohort between phase 1 and phase 2. Conclusions: The implementation of a decision-aid tool for ICU triage was associated with a reduction of potentially inappropriate ICU admissions. Introduction: The aim was analyze the ICU bed rotation pattern, the epidemiological characteristics of patients and to correlate them with prognostic score after software implementation Methods: This is an epidemiological and retrospective study. Data were collected between June 2016 and November 2017, using EPIMED\u00ae monitor software, applied in an adult ICU of a public hospital in Bahia/Brazil. Authorization for collection and use of data was granted by the institution. All patients hospitalized in the period were included regardless of other exclusion criteria. Results: During the period evaluated, there were 1.011 new hospitalizations, 649 men (64.19%) and 362 women (35.81%). 46.38% (469) were in the age group of 18 to 44 years, followed by 28.28% of the patients (286), who were between 45 and 64. The mean duration of hospitalization in our unit was approximately 8,45 days. During the period covered, 1.009 exits occurred: 701 patients (69.47%) were Introduction: Early debriefing after stressful events holds great value in reflection on both an individual and team-based level. Our objective was to implement routine structured debriefing sessions for doctors working in intensive care in order to optimise learning and develop strategies to improve practice. Methods: 100% of junior doctors (n=10, pre-implementation questionnaire) on the intensive care unit expressed a need for regular debriefing sessions to discuss challenging and complex cases. Weekly sessions were implemented and structured using the SHARP performance tool [1] . Key learning points were collected and added to a debrief list to track progress and assimilate learning. Informal feedback was obtained on a weekly basis with formal feedback assessed following one month of implementation. Results: 30min sessions occurred on a weekly basis supported by a consultant intensivist. Desired outcomes included assessment of team performance, identification of key learning points and psychological support. Following one month, 100% doctors involved felt that debriefing sessions were important and should continue. 75% felt that they left every session with a key learning point applicable to future clinical practice. Common themes in perceived benefits included improved team communication and creation of an open environment to address concerns. Conclusions: Working in intensive care exposes doctors to challenging and stressful situations. Implementation of a regular structured debrief session provides an opportunity for clinicians to address concerns, consolidate learning and develop strategies to improve clinical practice.",

Our objective was to investigate the association between nurse staffing patterns, outcomes and resource use in Brazilian ICUs. Methods: Retrospective cohort study in 129,680 (68% medical) patients admitted to 93 medical-surgical ICUs during 2014-15. We retrieved patients' data from an ICU registry (Epimed Monitor System) and surveyed participating ICUs about characteristics related to ICU organization. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with hospital mortality. We evaluated efficiency in resource use using standardized mortality rates (SMR) and resource use (SRU) based on SAPS 3. Results: SAPS 3 score was 44 (34-54) points and hospital mortality was 18.2%. Intensivists were present 24/7 in 83% ICUs. Median bed/ nurse ratio was 5.8 (4.2-7.3) and at least the chief nurse was boardcertified in critical care (BCCC) in 47% ICUs. Bed/nurse technicians ratio was 1.9 (1.8-2.1). Adjusting for relevant characteristics at patientlevel (age, admission type, SOFA, performance status, comorbidities, hospital days before ICU) and ICU-level (hospital type, checklist use, 24/7 intensivist, protocols), bed/nurse ratio was not associated with mortality [OR=0.99 (95% CI, 0.95-1.03)]. However, mortality was lower in ICUs with at least the chief nurse BCCC [OR=0.78 (0.65-0.74)]. In multivariate analysis, bed/nurse ratios <=6 [OR=3.53 (1.19-10.53)] and having the chief nurse BCCC [OR=6.36 (2.13-19.02)] were associated with higher efficiency. Conclusions: In a \"low intensity\" nurse staffing scenario, bed/nurse ratios were not associated with mortality. However, having at least the nurse chief BCCC was associated with higher survival. Moreover, bed/nurse ratios <=6 and presence of chief nurse BCCC were associated with higher efficiency in resource use. Methods: A systematic search on the value of acute non-physician provider on the ICU was conducted. The methodological quality of the included studies was rated using the Newcastle Ottawa scale (NOS). The agreement between the reviewers was assessed with Cohen's kappa. Results: In total 145 studies were identified. Twenty comparative cohort studies were identified which compared non-physicians with either residents or fellows. All studies comprised adult intensive care. Most of the included studies were moderate to good quality. A random effects meta-analysis from all studies regarding length of stay and mortality showed no differences between non-physicians and physicians, although there was a trend to better survival when implementing acute non-physician providers in the ICU (Figs. 1 & 2) . Mean difference for length of stay on the ICU was 0.36 (95% CI -0.07 -0.79; I2=88%) and for in hospital -0.15 (95% CI = -0.90 -0.61; I2=83%); while the odds ratio for ICU mortality was 0.94 (95% CI = 0.73 -1.20; I2=60%) and for hospital mortality 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 -1.00; I2=0). Conclusions: The acute care non-physician provider in the ICU seems a promising clinician on the ICU with regard to quality and continuity of care. Whether they also can reduce mortality remains to be determined by designing studies, which adequately measure the contribution of the non-physician providers in ICU care overall and per task. Their role in Europe remains to be elucidated.",

Results: 100 participants were respond in our survey from 127 ICU members the response rate was 78.7%, The depression symptoms found increased in nurses more than physicians in ICU with more desire to leave the job. There was strong correlation between the degree of depression symptoms and decrease percent of personal accomplishment. Impaired personal relationships at work and increased night shifts were major risk factors of burnout syndrome. Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine (IL6 and TNF alpha) were elevated in members who recorded sever degree of depression score with decrease in concentration of Co-enzyme Q10. Conclusions: The health workers in ICU had high liability for depression and burnout syndrome. The risk factors differ between nurses and doctors.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the implementation of a tailored multicomponent program to reduce discomfort in the ICU [1] on the occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 12 months after discharge from the ICU. Methods: Design: case-control study; the cases were patients hospitalized in the ICUs which implemented the tailored multicomponent program; the controls were patients hospitalized in the ICUs which did not implement the program. Exposition: the tailored multicomponent program consisted of assessment of ICU-related self-perceived discomforts by using the IPREA questionnaire, immediate and monthly feedback to healthcare teams, and tailored site-targeted measures under control of a duo of local champions. General procedure: eligible patients were recalled 12 months after the ICU stay. Data collection: sociodemographics, clinical data related to the ICU stay, discomfort's levels assessed the day of discharge from the ICU, life situation (home/care center), PSTD (IES-R) and anxiety-depression symptoms (HADS) 12 months after the ICU discharge. Results: From the 617 eligible cases and 847 eligible controls, 344 cases and 475 controls were included (reason for exclusion: deaths after discharge from the ICU, lost to follow-up, patient refusal, cognitive incapacity). A total of 6.1% of the cases and 12.2% of the controls presented certain symptoms of PTSD at12 months (p=0.004). After adjustment for age, gender, IPREA score, McCabe score, presence of invasive devices during the ICU stay and considering anxietydepression symptoms at 12 months, cases are less likely to have PTSD symptoms than controls. Conclusions: Our tailored multicomponent program for discomfort reduction in the ICU can reduce long-term outcomes as PTSD. Diffusion of such a program should be enhanced in the ICUs paving the way for a new strategy in care management.",

            "text": "Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction is a major factor leading to disability and poor quality of life in ICU survivors. In order to identify patients at risk for developing cognitive dysfunction due to critical illness or ICU treatment, one has to discriminate between patients with pre-existing cognitive dysfunction and those developing new cognitive dysfunction or worsening of cognitive function during ICU treatment. We investigated the incidence of pre-existing cognitive dysfunction in ICU patients using the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and its relation with delirium during ICU treatment. Methods: Patients relatives were asked to fill in the IQCODE on admission. An overall score on cognitive dysfunction was calculated by the average of the score on each item of the questionnaire. The incidence of delirium was based on the CAM-ICU score. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher's exact test. P-values of less then 0.05 were deemed significant. Results: In total 452 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU were analyzed, of whom 47.8% (n=216) showed decline in cognitive function prior to ICU admission. Cognitive function was divided in four groups; no change 52.2% (n=236), slight decline 34.1% (n=154), moderate decline 9.7% (n=44) and severe decline 4.0% (n=18) (Fig. 1 ). Incidence of delirium is shown in Fig.  2 . Patients with moderate to severe cognitive dysfunction showed significant more delirium during ICU treatment than patients with no change in cognition (44.2% and 21.1% respectively, (p=0.023)). Conclusions: Almost half of the patients admitted to the ICU have cognitive dysfunction prior to ICU admission. To assess ones cognitive function after ICU treatment one has to take in to account the patients pre-existing cognitive functioning. Patients with a moderate to severe pre-existing cognitive dysfunction develop significantly more delirium during ICU treatment. Introduction: Our aim was to identify and analyse patients treated for POCD admitted to a thoracics/urology intensive care unit at University College London, UK. POCD is rising in the ageing high-risk surgical patient. Early identification of those at risk and timely intervention could help reduce associated morbidity and mortality [1] . Methods: We identified patients treated with haloperidol, midazolam, lorazepam, olanzapine, clonidine or chlordiazepoxide from our electronic data system. These pharmacological interventions were used as surrogate markers of primarily hyperactive POCD, acknowledging other forms of delirium may be unaccounted for. 111 of 808 admissions (13.7%) were shortlisted from August 2016 to July 2017. Patients were excluded if the drugs had been used for other indications. Prevalence of known POCD risk factors were then detailed. On these data we performed a cluster analysis using R. Results: Of the 58 patients (7.17%) suitable for analysis, the mean age was 72. 41 patients underwent elective procedures. 39 were male and 19 were female. 75% patients had thoracic surgery. The mean pain score in the first 24 hours post-op was 1.6 (SD=1.1), (with 0= no pain, 4= very severe pain). 62% had evidence of poor sleep and 14% evidence of anxiety. In the 24 hours prior to evidence of POCD, the mean pain score remained 1.6 (SD=0.99), 76% had evidence of poor sleep and 22% had evidence of anxiety. 66% of our population was septic during their ITU admission. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates POCD is highly prevalent in male patients over 70 undergoing thoracic procedures. We will now develop a POCD pathway targeting improved postoperative management of pain, sleep, anxiety and infection in this patient population.",

            "text": "Introduction: Our objective was to determine the feasibility of employing family-administered tools to detect delirium in the critically ill. The use of family-administered delirium detection tools has not been assessed in the ICU where patients are critically ill and frequently intubated. Family members may be able to detect changes in patient cognition and behavior from pre-illness levels earlier than unfamiliar providers. These tools may be a valuable diagnostic adjunct in the ICU. Methods: Consecutive patients and family members (dyads) in the largest adult ICU in Calgary, Canada were recruited (Aug. 9-Sept. 11, 2017). Inclusion criteria were: patients with a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) >=-3; no primary brain injury and Glasgow Coma Scale score of <9; ability to provide informed consent (patient/ surrogate); and remain in ICU for 24 hours. Data were collected for up to 5 days. Family-administered delirium assessments were completed once daily (Family Confusion Assessment Method & Sour Seven). To assess feasibility, we assessed proportion of eligible patients and percent family member enrollment. Barriers to enrollment were categorized. Results: Of 99 admitted patients with family, 37 (37%) met inclusion criteria and 17 (46%) dyads consented. 20% of admitted patients did not have family and were thus ineligible. 73% of enrolled dyads assessed delirium at least once, with a median of 5 (of 10 total) assessments. The most common reason for non-enrollment was refusal by the family, who commonly reported feeling overwhelmed by the ICU environment. Barriers with nursing staff were encountered, including not providing access to patients and patient exclusion. Conclusions: These data suggest that employing family-administered delirium detection tools in the ICU is feasible for a subset of the population. Future studies will validate the use of these tools in the ICU, decrease modifiable barriers to enrollment, and test strategies to overcome attitudinal barriers towards employing these tools. Introduction: Psychological impact of critical illness and ICU stay on patients can be severe and frequently results in acute distress as well as psychological morbidity after discharge [1] . However, the stressful experience in ICU and its influence on patient recovery, remain relatively understudied. We assessed patients in ICU for acute distress and psychological symptoms with validated tools. Methods: We conducted an observational study in a group of awake ICU adult patients admitted in a tertiary centre for at least 48 hours, from January 2017 until October 2017, with mixed diagnosis on admission. We collected demographic factors, SAPS II at admission, mechanical ventilation, day of sedation, history of psychopathological disorder. Un-sedated and alert, critical care patients were assessed with tools such as Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Intensive Care Psychological Assessment Tool (IPAT). Results: 68 patients were recruited, (mean age 51.2\u00b117.9 years, 66.2% males). SAPS II at admission was 32.2\u00b116.7, 60.3% was mechanically ventilated (mean duration 6.1\u00b114), mean duration of sedation was 2.8\u00b13.9 days and a rate of 22.05% had an history of psychopatological disorder. 10.3% of the sample had clinical delirium (ICSDC>3) and was not assessed with others tools, 20.6% had subclinical delirium (ICSDC <=3). Regarding psychological outcomes, 26.2 % (mean score 6.1\u00b12.5) reported a score (>=8) on HADS that indicates a possible diagnosis of anxiety and 54.1% (mean score 7.9 \u00b1 3.7) of depression. A rate of 24.6% reported a score >= 7 on IPAT suggesting an acute distress. Conclusions: The study's key finding was that acute psychological distress was high in awake ICU patients. Further work is needed to determine the efficacy of early psychological interventions to reduce the incidence of acute distress and psychological outcomes after ICU stay. Introduction: A high percentage of polytrauma patients require surgery within the first 24 hours to stabilize primary traumatic injuries. One of the main intraoperative complications in this type of patients is due to hemodynamic instability [1] . Thus, it is necessary to implement multimodal monitoring involving both hemodynamic monitoring and monitoring of general anesthesia. The objectives of this study were to identify the possible implications of Entropy monitoring on hemodynamic stability in critically ill polytrauma patients. Methods: Prospective Observational Study, Deployed in the Clinic of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Emergency County Hospital \"Pius Brinzeu\" Timisoara, Romania. ClinicalTrials.Gov Identifier. There were two groups, Group A (N = 37), in which the depth of hypnosis was monitored through Entropy (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) and Group B (N = 35). Results: The incidence of hypotension and tachycardia episodes was statistically significantly lower in Group A, unlike the control group (p <0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant (p <0.05) consumption of inhaled anesthetic agent was recorded in Group A compared with Group B. Consumption of vasopressor was also lower in Group A (p <0.0001, difference between means 0.960 \u00b1 0.063, 95% confidence interval 0.8334 -1.0866) Conclusions: Deploying monitoring for the depth of hypnosis in general anesthesia using Entropy can significantly increase the hemodynamic stability of critically ill polytrauma patients.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the use of methadone in critically ill patients in a large hospital. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients who used methadone in a neurological intensive care unit for a period of four months and the results were evaluated. Results: In the four-month period, 52 patients used methadone during intensive care. 65 % of the patients were male, with a medical age of 59.7 \u00b1 17.4 years. The main indication for the use of the medication was for analgesia in patients who were weaned from mechanical ventilation. The mean time of use was 6.1 days. In all cases evaluated, analgesia was effective, with methadone being used alone or in combination with other drugs, according to an institutional protocol. Among the complications found, 20 patients presented hypotension (38 %); 20 presented bradycardia (38 %); 15 presented constipation (29%); 4 had excessive sedation (8 %) and 7 had other complications. All complications were reversible. 10 patients of the studied population died, however, without correlation with the use of methadone. Conclusions: The use of methadone, in the studied group, was effective in the control of analgesia, with no impact on patient safety when used in a monitored way. Introduction: Renal colic is a common disorder which presents with dramatic acute pain. Providing rapid relief, using effective pain control medications is the clinical priority to treat the patients. This study aims to compare the effect of IV Ketorolac versus Morphine in releasing renal colic pain by measuring pain severity and duration and also the need for additional doses. Methods: We performed a clinical pilot cohort study from during 2014 on patients with the clinical diagnosis of renal colic who recruited from the emergency department (ED) of Rasool-e-Akram Hospital and Firoozgar Hospital. Participants who were candidate to receive either Morphine or Ketorolac were divided into two groups who received either 30 mg Ketorolac IV or 5 mg Morphine. The pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) at four time points: before drug injection (VAS-1), 20 minutes (VAS-2), 40 minutes (VAS-3), and 60 minutes (VAS-4) after injection. In cases when the pain was not controlled with the first injection of drug beyond 60 minutes; additional doses (rescue) were injected. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21. Results: One-hundred-fifty patients treated with Morphine and 150 ones with Ketorolac were studiedThe group treated with Morphine scored on average 9.91 before the injection, which was roughly 2.4 points higher than Ketorolac. Morphine reduced patients' VAS scores more intensely (median: 10, IQR: 0 versus median: 6, IQR: 1; p value<0.001). In general, patients treated with Morphine were more likely to need a second (rescue) dose, when compared to Ketorolac group (38.6% vs 20%, p value= 0.001). Conclusions: Morphine is a better option for pain release in cases of renal colic. Ketorolac released the pain to an acceptable level; but, because of its slower action time, we recommend it in cases with moderate than severe pains.",

Methods: A total of 40 elderly patients, ASA 2, scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were assigned to receive on induction a single dose of either fentanyl (0.2 mg, +0.1mg) or a fix combination of etodolac and carbamazepine (Novocomb, dose 100mg+100mg iv bolus). Haemodynamic parameters and concentrations of prolactin cortisol and growth hormone (GH) [1] were determined at critical points and 24 h after operation. Results: Both fentanyl and Novocomb blocked the hypertensivetachycardic response to surgical trauma. Cortisol was a more appropriate endocrine marker of stress than prolactin or GH since fentanyl as an opioid analgesic increased secretion of prolactin [2] , while carbamazepine from Novocomb did the same with GH [3] (Figs. 1 & 2) . Conclusions: Cortisol plasma concentration correlates positively with cardiovascular parameters in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery who received fentanyl or Novocomb as intraoperative analgesic. Its suppression is better marker of analgesia than prolactin and GH.",

Both systems can be paired with ICU ventilators, but MIRUS features an automated control of end-tidal VA concentrations (etVA). We compare feasibility and recovery times for inhalational long term sedation with isoflurane (ISO), sevoflurane (SEVO) or desflurane (DES). Methods: 30 ASA II-IV patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery under general anaesthesia were included. Patients were randomized into three equal groups ISO, SEVO and DES. The MIRUS system was started with a targeted etVA of 0.5 MAC. We used the Puritan Bennett 840 ICU ventilator and performed a spontaneous breathing trial. If successful, the target concentration was set to 0 MAC and recovery times measured. Results: Patients were comparable in demographics, tidal volume, respiratory rate and sedation time (total 696h: ISO 19\u00b19h; SEVO 22 \u00b119h; DES 29\u00b129h; p=0.55). In all patients, a MAC of 0.5 was reached. Conclusions: MIRUS could automatically control end-tidal VA concentrations in ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients. The recovery times are only prolonged in the ISO group and could be shortened by removing the reflector. The higher etVA required for a 0.5 MAC using DES and SEVO were associated with an increased VA consumption.",

This non-invasive approach avoids discomfort, stress and risks related to the parenteral route of administration. The objective is to compare intranasal (IN) fentanyl versus any parenteral opioid (intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular) for the effectiveness of acute pain relief in an adult population. Methods: The systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42016052976). The research of articles was conducted through Embase, Central, and Medline databases. Randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of IN fentanyl to any parenteral opioid for acute pain relief (<= 7 days) in an adult population (>= 18 years old) were considered for inclusion. Studies on breakthrough cancer pain were excluded. Two different reviewers extracted data and analyzed the quality of the selected articles. The main outcome was the difference between pain levels before and after analgesia. The effect size was approximated using the inverse of variance of standardized mean differences, based on a random-effect model. Heterogeneity was quantified using a test of I2. Results are presented with 95% confidence interval. Results: Eight randomized clinical trials with 11 cohorts and a total of 613 patients were selected (320 IN fentanyl vs 293 control group). Selected articles contained a low risk of bias. There is no significant difference between the average levels of pain before and after analgesia comparing the two groups (SMD 0.12 [IC 95% -0.04 \u00e0 0.28], p=0.14; I2 = 0%) (Fig. 1) . Conclusions: IN fentanyl is as effective as other parenteral opioid to relieve pain during the first hour of treatment. Introduction: The aim of this study is to underline the importance of sedation protocol when performing the PEGJ procedure in advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Research about the use of sedation in endoscopy is getting more and more widespread as to answer to the increasing grade of complexity and duration of endoscopic procedures as to offer comfort to the patient in terms of analgesia, tolerability, and amnesia. Sedation is also a way to assure quality and safety examination and to improve its outcome [1] . Methods: This observational retrospective study includes 40 PD patients scheduled for PEGJ procedure (Fig. 1 ) in order to start therapy with Duodopa gel. We propose an anesthetic technique (Table 1) to support PEGJ with both local anesthesia and moderate sedation so as to provide analgesia and patient's comfort. This technique ensures Mean duration of PEGJ procedure was 35'\u00b15'. Mean stay time in recovery room 12'\u00b12'. Compared to our old experience, we collected lack of patient's discomfort, anxiety, and memory, high procedure compliance and improvement of the quality of procedure without use of opioids.",

Introduction: Disrupted sleep in critically ill patients may be associated with delirium, prolonged stay in ICU and increased mortality. Polysomnography (PSG), the criterion standard method of sleep monitoring, is challenging in ICU due to interpretation difficulties, as the patterns defined by the standard classification for scoring sleep are absent in many critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to investigate if the presence of atypical patterns in critically ill patients' PSG is associated with poor outcome measured by 90-days mortality in conscious critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Methods: 70 PSGs (median duration 20 hours) recorded in conscious critically ill mechanically ventilated patients were scored by an expert in sleep medicine blinded to patient characteristics. Standard sleep scoring classification was used if possible. Otherwise, modified classification for scoring sleep in critically ill patients proposed by Watson et al. was applied [1] . The association of sleep patterns (normal or atypical) and micro-sleep phenomena (sleep spindles and Kcomplexes) with 90 days mortality was assessed using Weibull model by calculation of Hazard Ratios (HR). Results: HR analysis showed twice as high mortality risk in case of atypical sleep compared to normal sleep; this was however not significant (HR 2.5; 95% CI 0.95-4.44; p=0.08). The presence of sleep spindles in PSG significantly reduced mortality risk to 1/3 (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13-0.86; p=0.02). The presence of K-complexes in PSG reduced mortality risk to \u00bd, though not significantly (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.24-1.12; p=0.1).",

Yet evidence in CC is scant, there are known adverse effects (ADE) and prescription is out with the European license. Meticulous observation of AP selection, prescribing and safety, alongside delirium assessment/plan is essential to gain new knowledge and patients. When accompanied by prescribing clinicians perspective of delirium AP treatment results are more interpretable. We conducted a two-part single centre cohort study that aimed to describe/compare real to perceived delirium assessment/plan, APs prescribing and safety in CC adult patients at GSTT. Methods: Part 1: a prospective survey, of CC prescribing clinician's beliefs and attitudes to delirium assessment/plan, APs prescribing and safety over previous 12 months. Part 2: a meticulous audit of APs prescribing and safety and delirium/agitation assessment and plan, over period of 4 months. Results: Part 1 Survey. 43 of 82 prescribers (53.6%) completed survey. 88% of reported using APs to treat delirium, with 83% selecting atypical APs as first option. Part 2 Audit. There were 2400 admissions to CC. APs were prescribed in 6.4% (188 prescription), 3.8% (113 prescription) were in delirium/agitation patients (Table 1) . Survey (vs.) audit: In the survey 67% reported daily delirium screening whereas only 12.3% undertook daily screening in audit (Fig. 1) . Higher quetiapine and lower IV haloperidol maximum daily dose were prescribed in audit in comparison with survey reported doses ( Table 2) . 12 Lead ECG was used to monitor AP ADE. In survey 34% reported assessing ECG once or more daily. Audit revealed only 19% actually did so (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: Authors believe perceived vs actual can identify key areas for Quality Improvement (QI). Major differences were in delirium assessment/plan and safety monitoring sedation practices in Turkish ICUs, the aim was to provide knowledge on this matter. Methods: An electronic survey form was generated with google forms. First part of the form included questions about demographics, and choices and routines of sedation administration. This part mostly contained multiple choice questions, which more than one choice could be indicated. Second part was comprised of some statements to investigate the attitudes of physicians, which were indicated on a five-point Likert scale. The link for the survey was posted to all email addresses registered in the Turkish Society of Intensive Care member database. Results: Of 1700 members, 429 (25%) completed the survey form. Demographics are given in Table 1 . Sedation was generally applied by the physicians (96%). The indications were mechanical ventilation (94%), agitation (87%), seizures (77%), anxiety (61%), delirium (59%). Drug choices of the respondents are shown in Fig. 1 . Sedation level was evaluated daily by 73% of respondents, mostly using Ramsay Scale (57%). Daily established sedation level was indicated in 63.8%, and daily interruption of sedation was indicated in 71.4% answers. Sedation protocol was not used in 62.7% of the answers. Analgesics applied commonly, while 63% routinely evaluated pain and visual analogue scale (VAS) was the preferred method in 69% of the answers. 77.2% of physicians indicated routine use of neuromuscular blockers. In 50.5% answers routine evaluation for delirium was indicated, mostly using CAM-ICU.When the knowledge of 2013 SCCM guideline pain, agitation and delirium management, 38% indicated a positive answer.The respondents indicated their opinion for some comments on sedation, the answers are shown in the Table 2 .",

Results: the patients reported a significant improvement of hospilizaton experience following their exposure to the \"nature environment\". patients described the sensory experience as a positive, pleasant, quiet and relaxing experience. the contact with the sun, wind, sky and grass and being outside on the \"sun balcony\" allows a disconnection from the threatening ICU environment. Conclusions: The \"sun balcony\" gave the patients a sense of hope and wish for healing. mobilizing complicated patients to the \"sun balcony\" is a big challenge which requires planning and preparation by the staff. yet by the proactive and creative thinking of the staff the patients are tranferred to the \"sun balcony\" to give them encouragement, a feeling of well being and hope for recovering. This intervention is costless and a routine procedure in the intensive care unit. Introduction: Long-term psychological outcomes of patients(pts) discharged from ICU represent an emergent relevant matter of concern.Systematic reviews refer prevalence of 23%-48% for anxiety,17%-43% for depression and 8%-35% for posttraumatic symptoms in ARDS patients.The onset of psychiatric symptoms after discharge, might be associated with patient's competence to process memories related with hospitalization and with memories. Methods: We selected 35 ARDS pts in ICU of a tertiary centre (Jan 2014-Dec 2016) at least 72 hour, for 6 months follow-up and 26 pts for 12 months follow-up after discharge. The psychopathological assessment was performed using scale as: Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), ICU Memory Tool (ICU-MT).",

The onset of these symptoms appeared to be mediated by specific traumatic memories related with ICU hospitalization. The main clinical recommendation emerging from this study is to investigate psychiatric history and develop psychological strategies to manage frightening or delusional experiences during ICU stay. Introduction: The aging of the population is a fact. The subgroup of very old (>= 80 years (ys)) is the one that increases the most rapidly. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission of these patients is an ongoing discussion worldwide. Our ICU has designed the VOOLCAno aiming its characterization and reviewing outcomes, to find some predictive indicators. The purpose of this first analysis is to evaluate specifically the group of very old patients (VOLDs) admitted to a tertiary Portuguese hospital ICU. Methods: Retrospective observational study was preformed, included all VOLDs admitted in ICU during 15 years (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) . Demographic data, admission diagnosis, severity scores, Charlson comorbidity index, length of stay and outcomes were considered. Data analysis used SPSS software. Results: We found a total of 460 admissions. The median age was 83.0 ys with IQR 4; Mostly male with medical admission diagnosis (sepsis and respiratory failure due to infection). There was a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II of 18 (IQR 8) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II of 49 (IQR 16). Median Charlson comorbidity index was 6.0 (IQR 2). Median length of stay was 3.9 days (IQR 8.2). Concerning outcomes, we found intra-ICU mortality of 36%; intra-hospital after ICU discharge mortality of 12% and mortality after hospital discharge of 41%. Identified as predictors of intra-hospital mortality the use of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001), urgent surgical admission or medical admission versus schedule surgical admission (p < 0.001) and the absence of oncologic disease (p = 0.024). On multivariate analysis, only mechanical ventilation (p = 0.002, HR 0.35, 95% C.I. 0.18-0.68) and urgent surgical admission versus schedule surgical admission (p = 0.002, HR 0.29, 95% C.I. 0.14-0.63) remain significant.",

Proportionally LD patients were young compared to the total population (Fig. 1) . We found that mortality appears to increase rapidly in those over 60 years of age and overall mortality is greater in those with LD (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: From April 2018 all UK Trusts will be required to complete a detailed review for patients with LD who die whilst in hospital care. This follows MENCAP's report 'Death by Indifference' which exposed deficiencies in the care of 6 people with LDs who died whilst in NHS care and the subsequent Confidential Inquiry into premature deaths of people with learning disabilities. In our population, LD patients have an earlier death than the general population and the overall mortality from critical illness is greater.",

Methods: In a prospective intervention study, we implemented this approach in six hospitals in the Netherlands. When the decision to withdraw life sustaining treatment was made at the ED in patients with a devastating brain injury without contra indications for organ donation, an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for end-of-life care was considered. Every ICU admission for end-of-life care was evaluated. Interviews were conducted with emergency physicians, neurologists and ICU physicians according to a standardized questionnaire. This interview focused on medical decisions that were made and difficulties arising during hospitalization.",

This led to 21 successful organ transplantations. In four of these 21 patients family consent was obtained to intubate them solely for the purpose of organ donation.

Introduction: There is a relationships between Intensive care patients losing the ability to speak and negative emotions [1] . Nursing care is challenging when patients are unable to verbalise and factors like pain and comfort are misjudged.. Our Intensive Care Unit has introduced a communication tool Intelligaze grid 3 which enables patients with primary motoric disorders to communicate their needs. A quality improvement study reviewed the methods of communication and interactions that our nurses use for patients who are ventilated. The objective of the study was to promote areas of improvement with communication in the ICU. Methods: We used a mixed-methods qualitative and quantitative study to evaluate the communication tools used by our nursing staff to interact with ventilated patients. A convenient data sample for all nurses working on particular dates was collected which is 66% of the nursing workforce. The study has been approved as a Quality Assurance project by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Nepean Hospital.",

Our hypothesis is some difference over time exists in thoughts about end-of-life care in the ICU. The purpose of this study is to know changing Methods: A questionnaire survey, which consists of 11 questions with 5 optional answers related to the thoughts of participants about end-of-life care of hopeless or brain death patients, was performed to nurses and doctors in our ICU. The questions were; whether accept to withdraw therapy or not and with family's will, whether positive or not to donate of organs from brain death patient, necessary of ICU care for brain death patient, feel guilty and stress for doing stop or withdraw therapy. The optional answer has 5 gradations from 'Yes' to 'No' for all questions. It was guaranteed to be anonymous for them in the data analysis. We conducted entirely same survey in 2012.

Median (interquartile range, IQR) 24-hour SOFA score was 8 (6-10) in 12-month survivors and 10 (8-13) in non-survivors. The SOFA score had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68 (95% CI 0.66-0.69) for predicting 12-month mortality. In multivariate regression model with age and gender, SOFA score had an odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI) of 1.21 (1.19-1.23) for predicting 12-month mortality.

Two investigators independently reviewed the eligibility of the study from abstracts or manuscript data. Data synthesis: Twelve articles met the selection criteria (Fig. 2). The six articles reporting RCTs concern only four RCTs. RCTs were single-centre studies comparing infusion with or without filter. Two of them included adult patients. The others included pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit patients. Primary endpoints were Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), organ failure, overall complication rate, bacteremia, sepsis, phlebitis and length of stay. Results: The results are mixed with one RCT reporting a reduction in SIRS, organ failure and overall complication rate, two studies in disagreement over the occurrence of sepsis and one study reporting no impact on length of stay.

Regarding the hospital evolution of these patients we had 837 exits in this period, 429 (51.25%) were discharge and 408 (48.74%) were deaths, of these, 100 (11.95%) were after discharge from the ICU. The mean SAPS score was 51.11 (ranging from 17 to 99). The probability of death, according to the standard equation was 24.60% and the adjusted for Latin America of 32.10%. Conclusions: The ICU has a high occupancy rate and rotation turnover, as well as a higher mortality than predicted by the score.

The Sophia Observation withdrawal Symptoms-Pediatric Delirium (SOS-PD) was developed to combine assessment of delirium with iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome, two conditions with overlapping symptoms. The current study evaluates the measurement properties of the PD component (PD-scale) of the SOS-PD scale. Methods: In a multicenter prospective observational study in four Dutch PICUs, patients aged 3 months to 17 years and admitted for more than 48 hours were included. These patients were assessed with the PD-scale three times a day. Criterion validity was established: if the PD total score was 4 or higher the child psychiatrist was consulted to confirm the diagnosis of PD using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria as the \"gold standard\". The child psychiatrist was blinded to outcomes of the PD-scale. In addition, the child psychiatrist assessed a randomly selected group of patients to establish false-negatives",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the adherence to the noninvasive ventilation protocol in a large hospital intensive care unit. Methods: We included all patients who used a non-invasive ventilation device from February 2016 to May 2017, based on the institutional protocol of Noninvasive Ventilation Indication. Results: In the period, 4963 patients were admitted in the sector, and 641 (12.91%) used noninvasive ventilation, according to institutional protocol. The mean SAPS3 in the period was 43.9 points, with an expected mortality of 22.3%. The actual mortality rate was 11.2%. The average adherence to the protocol was 88.45% in 2016, rising to 98.4% in 2017. This increase was associated with an organization culture, training of the professionals involved -physicians and physiotherapists, monthly feedback of the results, with established plans. The main nonconformities were related to failure of records, indication of the resource or choice of interface and time of therapeutic response. Conclusions: The adoption of protocols for the indication of noninvasive ventilation in highly complex patients was shown to be safe and effective in patients of high complexity, making it possible to reduce the number of patients on invasive ventilation and its complications.",

The aim was to evaluate the efficiency of protective MV in preventing ARDS in VAP. Methods: This retrospective study was done in 2013-2017. 102 patients with abdominal sepsis and VAP were enrolled in the stuidy. Patients were split in 2 groups: 1. protective MV: VAP patients were ventilated in protective mode (tidal volume (TV) 6-8 ml/kg); 2. standard MV: VAP patients were ventilated with TV 8-10 ml/kg. The ARDS incidence was assesed as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints: duration of MV, length of ICU stay, 30-day mortality.

Methods: In this prospective observational study we included 25 adults between March 2016 and February 2017. On predefined moments during and after surgery we performed serial paired CI measurements in CS, FT, PA and TPTD. All devices were used according to the manual. CS, FT and PA were not calibrated against TPTD. Agreement was assessed with Bland-Altman plots. The repeatability coefficient (RC), corrected limits of agreement (LOA), bias and percentage errors (PE) were calculated[2]. Trending was assessed with polar plots and concordance analysis[3].Results: Mean CI were 3.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 mL\u2022min \u22121 \u2022m \u22122 (CS, FT, PA, TD).

However,, to insert the dedicated arterial pressure line and central vein line are required for the measurement of GEDI. BNP, on the other hand, has been shown to be useful for an index to rule-in/rule-out patients with acute heart failure. The aims of this study are to verify the usability of BNP as an index for infusion management in treating septic patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Methods: This study is a post-hoc analysis of RCT (TPTD vs. EGDT) of an infusion management method for septic patients requiring mechanical ventilation conducted at 16 ICUs in Japan between October 2013 and March 2016.

Therefore, the benefit of fluid expansion associated with increased cardiac output and tissue perfusion should be balanced against the risk of pulmonary and tissue edema. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fluid overload on mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (LOS ICU) in post-cardiac surgery patients. Methods: In this retrospective single-center observational study the fluid balance, after 12 hours of ICU admission of post-cardiac surgical patients, were evaluated. The LOS ICU and the duration of mechanical ventilation until the first extubation were recorded. Fluid balances (FB) were divided into quartiles and the 75th percentile was defined as high FB. Results: 750 patients were included. The duration of mechanical ventilation and LOS ICU both increased noticeably in the fourth quartile compared to the first 3 quartiles (seeFigs. 1 and 2). Moreover, for every liter increase in fluid balance there was an associated 1.5 risk increase of having prolonged mechanical ventilation, and a two-fold risk of extended LOS ICU(Tables 1 and 2). Conclusions: Fluid overload in post-cardiac surgery patients is independently associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and extended LOS ICU.",

There are several complications, but infection is the major cause of morbidity and mortality after transplantation. The objective was evaluate the outcome of patients in the postoperative period of liver transplantation, in which the donors were in the presence of infection. Methods: Were analyzed all liver transplants performed in a large hospital in the period from 2014 to the beginning of 2017, which presented donor infection and evaluated: identification of the microorganism, antibiotic therapy and outcome (survival) in 30 days. Results: From 2014 to early 2017, 71 patients underwent liver transplantation. Of these, 07 (10%) received organs from donors in the presence of infection. The infectious agents identified in donors varied between Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase, VDRL and toxoplasmosis (IGG and IGM) tests positive, and anti-HBC positive serology. Therefore, bloodstream infection was present in all donors. The protocol of the institution was followed being collected cultures of the recipient and maintained antibiotic in the postoperative period. No deaths were attributed to the infection. Conclusions: Postoperative care, associated with the continuity of antibiotic therapy or the early initiation of treatment of infection, as well, as care in the prevention of new infections, are primary procedures for a significant reduction in mortality in liver transplantation.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TPE on coagulation in normal subjects. Methods: We prospectively included 20 patients who underwent TPE with 65 ml/kg fresh frozen plasma for Myasthenia gravis. Patients with pre-existing coagulation disorders, pro-haemostatic or antihaemostatic treatment were excluded. Standard coagulation tests (activated partial thromboplastin time -aPTT, prothrombin time -PT, International Normalized Ratio -INR), fibrinogen levels, platelet count and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were performed before and after each session. Three ROTEM tests were performed: ExTEM, InTEM and FibTEM. For each test the following parameters were recorded: clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot firmness (MCF), alpha angle, thrombin potential index (TPI), maximum velocity of clot formation (MaxV), time to MaxV (MaxVt) and area under the curve (AUC).",

Median number of units transfused was 2 [range, 2 -4]. Hypertension, stroke, renal failure, preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit values, BIA provided phase angle, aorta clamp time and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were associated with risk of RBC transfusion and were included in the final model of multivariate regression analysis. Preoperative stroke (OR=0.394, CI95%: 0.183-0.848, p=0.017), preoperative hemoglobin (OR=0.943, CI95%: 0.928-0.960, p<0.001), low phase angle (OR=0.430, CI95%: 0.250-0.740, p=0.002) and CPB time (OR=1.013, CI95%: 1.008-1.018, p<0.001) were identified as independent predictors. Conclusions: Several factors were identified to be significantly associated with postoperative RBC transfusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Among the conventional predictors a value of the BIA provided phase angle was indicated as a potent tool. Further analysis of clinical benefits of these findings is needed.

Inclusion criteria: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, age under 28 days or RACHS 1 >= 3 or reoperation with age under 10 years and FIBTEM\u00ae-A10 less than 15 mm at thromboelastometry. Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment group [fibrinogen concentrate according to the formula (15 -A10 (mm) x body weight(Kg)/140)] or control group (saline 0.9%). Outcomes were postoperative bleeding and the number of transfused units. Results: In these preliminary results, 30 patients were analyzed; 14 (46.7%) patients were allocated in the fibrinogen concentrate group and 16 (53.3%) patients in the control group. Fibrinogen concentrate patients had lower total blood drainage volume compared to the control group (125 vs. 244 ml, p= 0.042). There was no difference between groups regarding intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion. Fibrinogen levels analyzed by FIBTEM were similar between the groups at the end of CPB (6 vs. 7 mm, p= 0.292). Patients receiving fibrinogen concentrate had a significant increase in fibrinogen levels after infusion of the study solution (10 vs. 8 mm, p= 0.059, 204 vs. 160 mg/dL, p= 0.009). Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that prophylactic use of fibrinogen concentrate reduced postoperative bleeding in children undergoing cardiac surgery.

Throughout the world, as a result of traumatic injuries, about 16 thousand people die every day, and about 5.8 million people per year [1].Methods: This study included 118 patients with traumatic injuries: concomitant skeletal trauma, fractures of pelvis, femur, humerus. On the 1st and the 2nd day all patients received tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg during 10 minutes followed by an infusion 1g during 8 hours), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) 1 ml/kg (25 IU/kg), and FFP in a dose 15 ml/kg. From the 3d till 14th day all patients received enoxaparin (3500 U every 12 hours). Method of low-frequency piezoelectric thromboelastography (LPTEG) used to study the functional state of the hemostasis system. Results: Different periods of traumatic illness are characterized by various manifestations of blood coagulation disorders. The following LPTEG values were checked -Intensity of contact coagulation (ICC), Intensity of coagulation drive (ICD), clot maximum density (MA) and fibrinolytic activity -Index of retraction and clot lysis (IRCL). In the first period of traumatic injury ICC was decreased by 19.27%, ICD-decreased at 26.71%, MA was decreased by 24.92%, IRCL was 31.18% above the norm.

Methods: Retrospective study. 157 patients submitted to surgical correction of the cerebral aneurysm (81) or endovascular (76). January 2014 through September 2015. Were evaluated: Prophylaxis type and complications and outcomes: venous thromboembolism and pulmonary thromboembolism during hospitalization and follow-up of 6 months and survival at 30 days and 6 months. Results: 80.2% were females. Mean age of 54.5 \u00b1 14.4 years. Mean time to hospital stay: 3.9 \u00b1 5.5 days (Surgical group: 4.5 days versus 1.99 days in endovascular group, p < 0.001). 13.4% had subarachnoid hemorrhage at the time of admission, with length of stay of 5.87 days (p < 0.001). Prophylaxis during permanence UTI: 94.9% mechanical prophylaxis, 25.5% pharmacological prophylaxis and 24.4% combination therapy. Of the patients who received pharmacological prophylaxis, there were two cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and one case of major bleeding, in both cases, pharmacological prophylaxis was discontinued. The prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism was started in 24 to 48 hours in 95.5% of the patients. Venous thromboembolism was found in 1.27% of patients and pulmonary thromboembolism in 1.91%, both in surgical patients Survival was 30 days in 98.7% and 6 months: 96.21% (no statistical difference with endovascular and surgery groups). Conclusions: The introduction of prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in postoperative patients of cerebral aneurysm is a safe practice and should be established routinely in this group of patients.P393 Early pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis is not associated with hematoma expansion in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage the health & life sciences university, Hall in Tirol, Austria, 2 Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P393Introduction: European guideline recommendations for the start of pharmacological deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are unprecise and result in different clinical approaches.

Among patients with normal TnT had one patient RWMA (2%) and three patients reduced GLS (6%). The Table shows the diagnostic performance regarding detection of patients with increased TnT. Conclusions: The presence of RWMA and reduced GLS is a relatively common finding in patients following SAH and indicate markedly increased levels of TnT.

Median[IQR]    This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza pneumonia admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain, between June 2009 and April 2014. Patients were stratified according to treatment with systemic corticosteroids when administrated within the first 24-hours of hospital admission. We use a propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis to reduce confounding factors and association of the administration of corticosteroids. Primary outcome was ICU mortality. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to investigate the association between baseline characteristics and steroid use and used ICU mortality as the dependent variable. Administration of corticosteroids in patients with severe influenza pneumonia was associated with an increased ICU mortality. Thus, we advocate caution to physician using these medications for influenza pneumonia. Almost all PTI patients required intervention during the MET activation (94.6%) and 21.6% were admitted to PICU. Conclusions: PTIs are at significantly higher risk for MET activation. After MET activation, almost 80% of PTIs remained on the wards, which suggests that the MET helped manage deterioration in these patients. Targeted strategies need to be developed to reduce the risk of PTIs on the wards, and based on our results the MET may play a central role in improving care for these patients. all AUCROCs significantly differ from each other, p<0.01).

Targeted antibiotic therapy was higher in medical patients (63vs35%, p<0.05), but no differences emerged for duration and superinfections. The aims of the project were to use the Medication based Disease Burden Index (MDBI) and drug counts to quantify comorbidity at ICU admission and assess how levels of comorbidity change during a stay in ICU and to assess how comorbidity affects long term survival after a stay in ICU. Pharmacy data offers an alternative method of quantifying comorbidity and the MDBI is one method of doing this that can predict mortality. Methods: Data was collected from patients admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary ICU between 01/01/14 to 31/12/15. Ethical approval was sought. This data was used to produce an MDBI score and a drug count before and after an ICU stay. Information on long term mortality was also collected. T tests were used to determine the difference in comorbidity levels pre and post ICU. Kaplan Meier curves were used to establish if comorbidity affects long term mortality. Logistic regression was used to determine which method of measuring comorbidity was better at predicting mortality. Results: A paired t test was performed on 437 patients that showed comorbidity increases after a stay in ICU, as measured by the MDBI and drug counts. Kaplan Meier curves demonstrated that as comorbidity increases, long term survival decreases. Survival time was calculated as time from ICU discharge date to the date of death or end of study (31/01/17). The hazard ratio for the high MDBI group was 1.89 when compared to the zero MDBI group. The hazard ratio for the high drug count group was 1.81 when compared to the zero drug count group. Cox proportional hazard models were performed and results remained significant after adjusting for age. Logistic regression showed that the MDBI was better at predicting long term mortality than drug counts. Conclusions: This study increases the ever-growing evidence that the MDBI is a useful predictive tool for quantifying comorbidity and predicting long term mortality. Further research is required to replicate its use in other populations, and potentially other specialities. negative consequences of care that compromise patients' health and are costly to the healthcare system. In Canada, an estimated 7.5 per 100 hospital admissions are associated with an AE, but evidence suggests that the rate of AEs varies by hospital unit and by patient population. However, few studies examine AEs in the ICU. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted to 30 adult ICUs & CCUs in Alberta, Canada (n=30) between May 2014 and April 2017. Validated ICD-10CA algorithms for 18 patient safety indicators were used to estimate the frequency of any AE and each type of AE. Regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with AEs. In this prospective observational study, plasma D-dimer levels and NEWS of all acute adult consenting medical patients presenting to the ED at the Hospital of South West Jutland were assessed at arrival. 30-day survival status was extracted from the Danish Civil Registration System which ensured complete follow-up. Patients were sorted by high and low d-dimer with a cut-off value of 0.50 mg/L and additionally by high and low NEWS with a cut-off score of 2. Low D-dimer levels appear to identify patients at low risk of 30-day mortality. The addition of NEWS does not appear to increase this ability. Further validation is needed.",

The aim of this study was to characterize COPD patients at risk to NIV failure (NIVf) and their impact on ICU mortality. Methods: Secondary analysis from a prospective, observational, multi-center study of COPD subjects admitted to the ICU with ARF due to influenza infection. Demographics data, clinical and laboratory variables and severity of illness were recorded. Three groups were studied: (1) COPD subjects who received NIV at ICU admission and failed(NIVf group); (2) COPD subjects who received NIV at ICU admission and succeeded(NIVs group); and (3) COPD subjects who received invasive mechanical ventilation at ICU admission(IMV group). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine factors independently associated with NIVf and ICU mortality.Results: Of 476 patients, 211 (44.3%) required IMV and 265 (55.6%) NVI. Failure occurred in 118 (44.5%) patients and were more likely to have high severity(SOFA 7 vs.4,p<0.001),shock(72.9%vs.13.6%,p<0.05),acute renal failure (31.4%vs. 13.6%, p<0.05), bacterial co-infection(25.4% vs. 10.9%,p<0.05) and hematological disease (5.9% vs. 1.4%,p<0.05) compared to NIVs group. Shock (OR=13.4[6.36-28.8]) was independently associated with NIVf. The overall ICU mortality was 31% in the IMV group, 39% in the NIVf group and 5% in the NIVs group, respectively (p<0.001 comparing NIV groups). In the multivariate analysis, only number of quadrants infiltrates(OR=1.42[1.03-1.94]p<0.02), hematological disease (OR=6.27[1.09-35.9]p=0.04), chronic renal failure (OR=7.3[2.1-24.4]p=0.02) and NIVf (OR=9,27[2.9-28.7]p<0.001) were variables independently associated with ICU mortality. Conclusions: NIVf is frequent a complication in COPD patients admitted to the ICU with influenza infection. Shock presence should alert clinicians to consider IMV due to the high risk of NIV failure and ICU mortality.Introduction: Role of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) following extubation in patients with acute respiratory failure is debatable. NIV may provide benefit in post surgical patients[1], but its role in nonsurgical patients is controversial. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched (from 1946 to 20th November 2017) to identify prospective randomized controlled trials, where post extubation NIV has been compared with standard oxygen therapy in adult patients with acute respiratory failure. For continuous variables, a mean difference was computed at the study level, and a weighted mean difference (MD) was computed in order to pool the results across all studies. For binary outcomes, the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated using the inverse variance method. Results: Data of 1525 patients from 11 randomized trials have been included in this meta-analysis. Two trials used NIV to manage postextubation respiratory failure. Pooled analysis found that mortality rate at Post extubation NIV in non-surgical patients with acute respiratory failure does not provide any benefit over conventional oxygen therapy.

Its management includes, drug therapy, oxygen and airway support by spontaneous ventilation in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The Boussignac CPAP is powered by pure oxygen, its 'open' character allows the patient to increase his inspiratory demand himself, which may influence the delivered FiO2, the patient also breathing ambient air with 21% O2. Previous studies assessed the FiO2 delivered by the device under conditions of respiratory distress but did not focuse on insipratory flow. The aim of this study was to measure the FiO2 actually delivered by the device under simulated conditions of respiratory distress. Methods: In this benchmark study, FiO2 was measured by varying the respiratory rate (FR, 10 up to 45/min), tidal volume (Vt, between 150 and 750mL) and inspiratory flow (between 30 and 90L/min) at the target pressure of 8 cmH2 O. The assembly included a Boussignac CPAP fed with 100% O2 via a flowmeter up to 30 L/min, a double Vygon mask sealed, a Vygon manometer, a Michigan test lung driven by a Dr\u00e4ger Evita 4 ventilator, and a Citrex analyzer. Each measurement was done 3 times and the average of the 3 values was retained. Results: The O2 flow required to maintain the target pressure of 8cmH20 was <= 25L/min. Depending on FR and inspiratory flow, for a Vt <= 250mL, the delivered FiO2 ranged between 70 and 99%. For a 350mL <= Vt <= 500mL, the FiO2 was between 57 and 90%. For a given Vt, FiO2 decreased when FR and/or inspiratory flow were increased(Fig. 1). Conclusions: The Boussignac CPAP delivered high values of FiO2 at a flow rate of O2 <= 30L/min. However, FiO2 varied with FR, Vt and inspiratory flow. These changes in FiO2 observed during simulated severe respiratory distress conditions should be taken into account and compared to other CPAP devices.Fig. 1 (abstract P188).

As high oxygen levels may be harmful, doctor' preferences for oxygen administration in mechanically ventilated patients are of significant interest as these have the largest exposure to high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ). To quantify a multinational segment of ICU doctors' preferences for oxygen administration in a variety of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, we conducted an international questionnaire-based survey. Methods: Based on a previous survey[1]  we constructed and validated a 17-part questionnaire on oxygen administration. The questionnaire was electronically distributed through spring and summer 2016 to 1080 ICU doctors at various educational levels in 233 hospitals in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The median degree of DE was higher in patients with extubation success than those with failure (17.8 mm vs. 11.9 mm, p=0.01). Patients with extubation success had a greater DTF (41.7% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.007). The area under the ROC for DE was 0.800, 95% CI [0.578-1], while it was 0.717 for DTF 95% CI [0.453-0.981], p=0.001.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the adhesion of the ventilatory weaning protocol on the incidence rate of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation in the tracheostomized patient in a large hospital neurological intensive care unit. Methods: The tracheostomized patients were retrospectively assessed from January 2015 to May 2017, correlating time of ventilatory weaning and pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation. Results: In the period, 8,485 patients were admitted to the unit, with a mean age of 66.5 years, with an average stay of 5.6 days; 56% of the hospitalizations were surgical, with an expected mortality of SAPS3 of 22.3% and real mortality of 11.2%. In this group, 497 were tracheostomized patients and 276 eligible for ventilatory weaning according to institutional protocol. Ninety-six percent of patients completed ventilatory weaning. Prior to protocol initiation, the mean ventilatory weaning time was 12.8 days, which decreased to 5.2 days in 2015 and 1.6 days in 2016. The incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 1.09 by 2015; 1.49 in 2016 and 0.75 in 2017. Conclusions: The implementation of ventilatory weaning protocol contributed safely to standardization of the weaning process in the unit, reduction of mechanical ventilation time and low rate of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation.

Methods: Twelve intubated and mechanically ventilated COPD patients with static PEEPi>=5cm H2O underwent PSP and PSN at different levels of extrinsic PEEP (PEEPe) (at 0%, 40%, 80%, and 120% of static PEEPi, for 12 minutes at each level on average), at matching peak airway pressure. We simultaneously recorded EAdi, airway, esophageal pressure, and flow. Tracings were analyzed to measure dynamic PEEPi (decrease in esophageal pressure to generate inspiratory flow), and intrinsic-EAdi (EAdi value at the onset of inspiratory flow), and IDEAdi (inspiratory delay between the onset of EAdi and the inspiratory flow). Results: Mean airway pressure was comparable for PSP and PSN at same target levels. The pressure necessary to overcome PEEPi, intrinsic-EAdi, and IDEAdi was significantly lower in PSN as compared with PSP, decreased with increase in PEEPe, although the effect of external PEEP was less pronounced in PSN. Intrinsic-EAdis at different PEEPe in PSP were tightly correlated with dynamic PEEPi (r2 =0.46, r2 =0.56, r2 =0.71, r2 =0.62, respectively). Conclusions: In COPD patients with PEEPi, PSN compared with PSP, led to a decrease in the pressure necessary to overcome PEEPi, which could be reliably monitored by the electrical activity of the diaphragm before inspiratory flow onset (intrinsic-EAdi) in PSP.",

Serum levels of IL-18 were returned to baseline values after 24 h. These changes however, were not significantly different. Increased levels of IL-18 in septic patients were correlated with a rapid shallow breathing index >75 (p=0.028) and APACHE II score (p=0.05). No changes were observed in the remaining inflammatory mediators in both groups. Conclusions: Elevated IL-18 levels in septic patients were associated with cardiopulmonary distress and disease severity.

Patients with apneic episodes are often considered to have respiratory insufficiency regardless of whether these apneic episodes are compensated by large recovery breaths. We used a non-invasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM) to measure minute ventilation (MV) to assess ventilation in patients experiencing apnea in the PACU and general floor. Methods: We used an RVM (ExSpiron1Xi, Respiratory Motion, Inc.) to continuously monitor MV for 48h following elective abdominal surgery. MV was expressed as percent of predicted MV (MVPRED); Low MV was defined as MV<40%MVPRED. For each apnea (ie, respiratory pause >10 seconds), we calculated the patient's corresponding MV over the 30, 60, 90, and 120s windows following the start of the apnea.Results: 216 patients (110 males, BMI: 26.7 (15.1-41.",

Methods: The study included 102 patients with 3-4 stage of COPD. All patients were diagnosed with 1-2 stage of chronic kidney disease according to the recommendations of KDIGO (2012). In addition to general clinical examination, the level of vitamin D was assessed in all patients and the frequency and structure of ACE in the previous 12 months were studied. Results: The average level of vitamin D was 7.2 \u00b1 2.1 ng/ml. The incidence of insufficiency, deficiency and severe deficiency was 5%, 33% and 64%, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of the ACE was 42 cases. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) were observed relatively more frequently. When ranking according to the degree of severity of vitamin D level reduction, it was found that acute cardiovascular events occurred significantly more frequently in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency: cases). In patients with vitamin D levels of 10-20 ng/ml 12 cases of ACE were observed (p <0.05 compared to group with severe deficiency) -3 cases of ACS, 2 cases of ischemic stroke, 4 cases of severe arterial hypertension, 3 cases of cardiac arrhythmia). Only 6 cases of ACE were observed (p <0.05 compared to group with severe deficiency) in patients with insufficiency of vitamin D (2 cases of ACS, 3 cases of ischemic stroke, 1 OHMK, 1 case of PTE). Conclusions: The frequency of acute cardiovascular events is significantly higher in patients with severe COPD and lower values of vitamin D. Thus, vitamin D can be considered as a possible target for the control and therapy of severe COPD.P208 Intravenous magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomized controlled trial E Pishbin, E Vafadar Moradi Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P208Introduction: Intravenous (IV) magnesium has an established role in the treatment of acute asthma attack. It is attractive as a bronchodilator because it is relatively cheap and has minimal side effects. There are few studies evaluating the effect of magnesium on acute exacerbation of COPD and the results of them are contradictory. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IV magnesium sulfate in the treatment of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute exacerbation of COPD. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, adult patients presented to the ED with acute exacerbation of COPD were randomly allocated in 2 groups. Patients in the study group received the standard treatment, plus 2 gram of IV magnesium sulfate and patients in the control group received the standard treatment, plus placebo. The outcomes included admission rate, intubation rate, changes in PEFR, SpO2 and dyspnea severity score. PEFR, SpO2 and dyspnea severity score were documented before the treatment and 20 minutes after administration of MgSO4 or placebo. Results: 34 patients were included in the study (17 patients in each group), 16 patients were men and 18 patients were women. The study group had significantly more improvement in the dyspnea severity score (P=0.001) and SpO2 (P= 0.004) as compared to the control group. But the difference in the changes in PEFR, intubation rate and admission rate were not clinically significant between 2 groups. (P>0.05) Conclusions: Adding magnesium sulfate to the standard treatment in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD leads to more improvement in dyspnea severity score and SpO2 although it does not reduce admission rate and intubation rate. Small sample size and the dependency of PEFR on patient's effort are limitations of the present study. Furthermore we did not exclude the patients with the Cor pulmonale which may had an effect on the low response rate to MgSO4.",

Methods: Prospective observational monocenter study. We enrolled adults ICU patients at day 1 after surgery, extubated, with no neuromuscolar diseases. In each patient DUS (caudal displacement (CD) and thickening fraction (TF)[2]), was performed. WF was defined as NIV or reintubation within 48h after extubation. Results: We enrolled 43 patients (25 males, age 70.9\u00b110.2 years, BMI 27.1\u00b15, MV length 5h [4-6], ICU stay 1.5 days [1.0-2.0]). Surgery was performed by laparotomy (La-28%), sternotomy (St-53%) or right thoracotomy (Rt-19%). No differences were remarked in patients' characteristics, MV length, ICU stay Table 1. Rt patients had WF more than other approaches (p=0.0080); right CD and TF were significantly lower in Rt (p<0.05, Table 2). Rt was a risk factor for WF (OR 17.5, 95% CI 1.38-222.62, p=0.0024). Conclusions: Postsurgical right DD is significantly affected by surgical approach; Rt has the highest percentage of DD, probably explaining the highest rate of WF.

Ultrasound results (#thoracotomy significant vs. sternotomy and laparotomy) Introduction: Diaphragm dysfunction occurs quickly in mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and poor outcome. Recent literature suggest that diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF) measured by ultrasound can be useful to predict weaning outcome. However, there is no standardized approach in the measurement of diaphragm thickness (DT) and limited data exist comparing different measurement techniques of diaphragm thickness (M mode-MM or B mode-BM). For example movements of the diaphragm relative to the transducer during the respiratory cycle may result in unintended comparison of different points of the diaphragm at end expiration and inspiration during MM measurements. The goal of this study was to compare MM with BM in the measurement of diaphragm thickness and DTF in the ICU patients. Methods: DT was measured in right diaphragm during tidal breathing. Three measurements of the DT were taken both in MM and BM and averaged to report the mean. DT was measured during inspiration and expiration and DTF was calculated. Bias and agreement between the 2 measurement methods was evaluated with Blant and Altman test. Results: Forty-two patients were enrolled in the study. Diaphragm could not visualize or measured in 8 patients and measurements of 34 patients were analyzed. Despite existance of different degree diaphragm movements relative to the ultrasound transducer secondary to respiratory movement there was no significant difference between the measurement results of MM and BM. There was good agreement and no significant proportional bias between the measurements of 2 modes (p>0.05). BM and MM measurements during the inspiratory (0.29\u00b1 0.07& 0.30\u00b10.07 cm; p: 0.159), expiratory (0.22\u00b10.06 & 0.22\u00b10.06 cm; p:0.9) phases and DTF were (29\u00b115 & 32\u00b115 %, p:0.217) respectively. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is no significant difference between in the measurement of diaphragm thickness with MM or BM.P213 Diaphragmatic dysfunction in critically ill patients and its impact on outcome. Assessment of diaphragmatic thickness and excursion by ultrasound Y Nassar, M Amin, M Ghonemy, H Abulwafa Cairo University, Giza, Egypt Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P213Introduction: The diaphragm is considered as the main respiratory muscle, and its dysfunction predisposes to many respiratory complications. Ultrasound (US) is now an accepted method of measuring Diaphragmatic Excursion (DE) and Diaphragmatic thickness (DT). We aimed to detect Diaphragmatic Dysfunction (DD) in critically ill patients and its impact on outcome. Methods: We prospectively recruited consecutively any critically ill adult requiring admission to MICU with SOFA >= 2. Exclusion criteria: diaphragmatic or spine injury, neuromuscular disease, any usage during hospital stay of paralytic agents, aminoglycosides, sedatives or analgesia other than morphine. The right hemi-diaphragm was evaluated by M mode US for DE and B mode US for DT with the patients in the supine position. DT and DE and laboratory measurments were taken on admission and every 48 hr for a total of 3 readings (Day 0, 2, 4).Patients were followed up for length of ICU stay and 30 day mortality. DD was diagnosed if a DT <=0.2 cm and DE <=1.0 cm. Results: The study included 106 subjects. In the total studied group mean age was 51.4 \u00b1 16.3 years, 49 (46.2 %) were males while 57 (53.7 %) were females. The meanSOFA was 5.33 \u00b1 3.66 and Mean APACHE II was 15.42 \u00b17.91.DD group included 38 (35.8 %) vs. Non DD group included 68 (64.1 %) subjects (p<0.001). PaCO2 was higher (48.2\u00b14.1 vs. 39.3\u00b16.9 mmHg, p=0.01) in DD vs. NDD group respectively. WBCs was higher (15.18\u00d7103 \u00b1 7.2\u00d7103 vs. 11.78\u00d7103 \u00b1 2.9\u00d7103 cell/ml, p=0.01) in DD vs. NDD group respectively. LOS was significantly higher (9.70\u00b10.4 vs. 6.68\u00b11.3 days, p=0.02) in DD vs. NDD group respectively. Comorbidities in the two groups are shown inFig. 1. Mortality was significantly higher (81.5% vs. 23.5%, p<0.001) in DD vs. NDD group respectively.Conclusions: DD was present in nearly one third of ICU patients which was largely associated with a longer ICU stay and a higher mortality. PaCO2 and WBCs were associated with a negative effect on diaphragmatic function.P214 Multimodal evaluation of diaphragm function after cardiac surgery R Pinciroli 1 , M Bottiroli 2 , D Ceriani 2 , S Checchi 1 , A Danieli 3 , A Calini 2 , MP Gagliardone 2 , G Bellani 1 , R Fumagalli 1 University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy; 2 ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy; 3 University of Milan, Milan, Italy Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P214Introduction: Diaphragmatic dysfunction may occur following openheart surgery. Diaphragm Ultrasound (US) provides a reliable evaluation of diaphragmatic motion. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a novel non-invasive technique to assess its electrical activity.[1]  Aim of this study is to evaluate, through both sEMG and US, postoperative changes of diaphragm function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: US measurements of right and left hemidiaphragm excursion during Quiet Breathing (QB) and Deep Breathing (DB) were obtained before surgery, and postoperatively, at the first spontaneous breathing trial. We simultaneously recorded bilateral sEMG traces. Values of Diaphragmatic Excursion (DE) and sEMG amplitude were analyzed and compared. Unilateral DD was defined as an asymmetry index (right/left excursion at DB) of >1.5 (left DD) or < 0.5 (right DD), as previously reported[2]. DP was defined as an excursion lower than 0.1 cm at DB, or evidence of paradoxical inspiratory motion. Results: 18 adult patients undergoing elective open-heart surgery were enrolled. A significant overall reduction of DE could be identified postop-DD with evidence of asymmetry was detected through US in 4/18 patients (22%) postoperatively(Fig. 1). Patients with DD showed a higher reintubation rate (2/4 vs. 0/14, DD vs. no DD), leading to a longer time of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. Conclusions: Compared to baseline, postoperative diaphragmatic function was globally reduced in our patients, as shown by both US and sEMG data. A subgroup of subjects showed a monolateral DD, with an apparent impact on clinical outcome, despite the small sampled population.Fig. 1 (abstract P213).

Methods: We conducted a physiological study to correlate information derived from esophageal pressure measurements with measurements of diaphragmatic thickness in patients ventilated on a Pressure support mode, breathing through a T-piece tube and a situation of resistive breathing Results: We studied 12 patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Larisa. During the Pressure Support mode we found a positive correlation between lung compliance and In this study we found that the result of diaphragmatic function, meaning transdiaphragmatic pressure and the generated tidal volume, can be assessed focusing on the changes of the diaphragmatic thickness during the respiratory cycle. EELV) and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is a new approach for setting parameters in mechanical ventilation. We analyzed the relationship between these parameters in two challenging patient groups: group 1 with ARDS or severe pneumonia and group 2 with intraabdominal hypertension or BMI>45. Methods: Intensive care patients at the hospital Bergstrasse (Heppenheim, Germany), requiring mechanical ventilation>72h, were included in the study. Esophageal pressure (Pes), EELV and IAP were measured daily at 3 PEEP levels: 15, 10 and 5. Pes was measured via nasogastric catheter with an esophageal balloon, EELVby nitrogen washout method and IAP as bladder pressure through a bladder catheter. Patients were in supine position and under full muscle relaxation. Tidal volume -6ml/kg. P L and chest wall elastance (Ecw) were calculated using the elastance-derived method[1].Results: 18 Patients (N=18) were included in the study (N1=9; N2=9). In 53 measurements (N1=25; N2=28) there was no difference between groups regarding EELV (p>0.05). At PEEP of 5, patients in group 2 had higher Pinsp, Pes and IAP (Pinsp22\u00b14 vs 18\u00b12, p<0.01); (Pesmin 11.8\u00b14 vs 9.9\u00b13.5, p=0.04); (IAP 11.1\u00b13 vs 8.7\u00b13, p<0.01) Table 1. There was a strong positive correlation between EELV and Cstat at PEEP 5 (R=0.7, p=0.02), as well as Cstat and end expiratory PL (PLexp) (R=0.6, p<0.01) [Fig. 1]. In group 2 we saw a strong correlation between IAP and Ecw (R=0.6, p<0.01) and mild correlation between IAP and Cstat (R=0.4, p=0.02) [Fig. 2]. Conclusions: Higher transpulmonary end expiratory pressure ensures better Cstat. In patients with intraabdominal pathology, the chest wall elastance strongly depends on the intraabdominal pressure.

To validate the correct position and inflation volume of the balloon, a positive or negative pressure occlusion test is used, considered valid when the ratio between oscillations in Pes (\u0394 Pes) versus airway-pressure (\u0394 Paw) are equivalent. We investigated the impact of two different compression/decompression rates during chest compression.Methods: We studied 8 pigs with injured lungs, paralyzed and supine. An esophageal balloon was placed at the lower portion of esophagus and a Ppl sensor (wafer-type, flat balloon) was placed at most dependent lung region. Both devices were inflated with minimal (non-stressed) volume derived from in-vitro and in-vivo PV curves. Two rates of thoracic compression (slow and fast) were tested and recorded at different PEEP levels. Plots of Pes/Paw and Ppl/Paw were fitted into a hysteresis and linear-regression model. Results: 70 repeated measurements were performed in 8 animals (PCV mode, PEEP = 12\u00b13 cmH2O and VT = 6 ml/kg). The compression-time for slow maneuver was 0.49 \u00b1 0.10 s, vs. 0.19 \u00b1 0.04 for the fast one. Plots of Ppl/Paw showed small hysteresis, with phase angles of 1 vs. 3 grad for slow vs. fast maneuvers. In contrast, plots of Pes/Paw showed higher hysteresis, with phase angles of 3 vs. 32 grad (slow vs. fast)",

However, the measurement of Pes is affected by several factors, including filling volume of an esophageal balloon and an esophageal wall elastance. Recently, Mojoli et al. have reported an in vivo calibration method (M method) to make reliable the measurement of both absolute values of Pes (abs Pes) and tidal swings of Pes (\u0394 Pes). In contrast, the validity of Pes measurement by a commercially available ventilator has not been investigated. Thus, we evaluated the accuracy of abs Pes and \u0394 Pes measured by AVEA ventilator (CareFusion, Yorba Linda, USA), which regulates a filling volume of balloon automatically and is the only approved equipment to measure Pes in Japan, by comparison with the M method.Methods: Four anesthetized and paralyzed pigs (40.9-42.8 kg) were mechanically ventilated and subjected to lung injury by saline lung lavage. In each pig, two different extrathoracic pressures were applied by using a thoraco-abdominal belt. Abs end-expiratory Pes and \u0394 Pes were measured by AVEA ventilator and the M method, and obtained values were compared for their correlation and agreement. Results: Comparison of the two methods showed that correlation coefficients of abs end-expiratory Pes and \u0394 Pes were 0.85 (P = 0.007) and 0.88 (P = 0.004), respectively. By Bland-Altman analysis, the bias and precision of abs end-expiratory Pes were -2.2 and 2.3, and those of \u0394 Pes were 0.1 and 3.4, respectively(Figs. 1 and 2). Conclusions: Abs end-expiratory Pes tended to be higher in the A method than in the M method. \u0394 Pes of the two methods were well correlated. In our animal model, the accuracy of Pes measured by AVEA ventilator was clinically acceptable when compared to the M method.Introduction: Maintaining inspiratory pleural pressure (Ppl) in an optimal range is important to prevent lung injury, respiratory muscleFig. 1 (abstract P218).

Agreement between the two methods of measuring tidal swings of Pes by Bland-Altman analysis fatigue and ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction. While esophageal pressure (Pes) has been used as a gold standard surrogate for Ppl, the measurement of Pes has several challenges including correct positioning of an esophageal catheter. We hypothesized that Ppl in spontaneously breathing children during mechanical ventilation can be estimated by using the change in central venous pressure (\u0394 CVP). Methods: Spontaneously breathing children under mechanical ventilation with acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FIO2 <300), who has a central venous catheter and an esophageal catheter for clinical purposes, were enrolled. Correct positioning of the esophageal balloon catheter was ensured by an occlusion test (OT), in which the changes in Pes and airway pressure (\u0394 Pes and \u0394 Paw, respectively) were confirmed to be close to unity. First, we obtained a ratio (k) of \u0394 Paw (\u2248\u0394 Ppl) to \u0394 CVP during OT. Second, assuming k was the same as the ratio of \u0394 Ppl to \u0394 CVP during spontaneous breathing, \u0394 Ppl during pressure support of 10, 5, and 0 cmH2O was calculated by using \u0394 CVP as follows: CVP-derived \u0394 Ppl = k * \u0394 CVP. Finally, CVPderived \u0394 Ppl was compared to \u0394 Pes at each ventilator setting. Results: Eight patients (Median age 4.8\u00b13.3 months; median body weight 4.7\u00b11.3 kg) were included in the analysis. CVP-derived \u0394 Ppl and \u0394 Pes were correlated significantly (y=0.59x+3.6, R2=0.56, p<0.01). Bland-Altman analysis showed that bias and precision of these two methods were -0.53 and 3.5 cmH2O, respectively(Fig. 1). Conclusions: In spontaneously breathing children during mechanical ventilation, CVP-derived \u0394 Ppl correlated well with \u0394 Pes. It could be used as a guide to estimate pleural pressure without using an esophageal balloon catheter.",

In the propensity-matched cohort consisted of 6103 patients each from both groups, the rate of ROSC was higher in the afternoon group (37.1% vs. 35.3%, adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95%CI 1.01-1.18, p=0.023) and there were no significant differences in the rate of survival and favorable functional status at 1 month (36.6% vs. 36.6%, 25.5% vs. 26.6%, respectively). Conclusions: We found an independent correlation between the time of the day at which OHCA occurred and ROSC, however, this did not impact long-term outcomes.P420 An alarm bell ignored: impact of availability of intensive care unit on outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest C Chen 1 , Y Yeh 2 , S Change 2 , P Lee 2 1 E-DA Hospital, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 2 Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital/Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P420Introduction: In the fast-paced pre-hospital settings, it's difficult to estimate accurate bed availability of intensive care unit (ICU) of the receiving hospitals while approaching out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. It might be troublesome if a OHCA patient regaining signs of life is sent to a hospital without ICU bed. Previous work has not elucidate the problem.

Primary outcome was survival to discharge. Secondary outcome was favorable neurological outcome defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2. Results: In a 6-year period, 5141 OHCA (12.2%, traumatic) patients were sent to the hospitals with available records of ICU bed availability. Overall survival (discharged alive) was 7.8%, and 1% achieved favorable neurological outcome. On hospital arrival, the survival rate of OHCA patient treated in the hospitals with available ICU capacity was 8.6%. 17 % of OHCA patients were sent to the hospital without ICU bed, and demonstrated a survival rate of 3.5% with a favorable neurological outcome of 1.2%. In the multivariate analysis, the first recorded cardiac rhythm, location of OHCA, and availability of ICU bed appeared to be significant risk factors of survival to discharge, but not observed in neurological outcome. Conclusions: In addition to cardiac rhythm and location of OHCA, we disclosed the major indicator of ICU capacity for an increased chance of survival. With regard to achieving better precision public health, we recommend ICU bed availability as an adjuvant dispatch tool for OHCA management.P421 Noninvasive monitoring during transport of OHCA. a step further towards early precision medicine for ROSC patients?

We examined the logistical and operative changes prompted by the introduction on the ambulances (January 2016) of a Mechanical Chest Compression (MCC) device and by the start (June 2016) of a protocol of Non-Heart-Beating Donation (NHBD) Methods: We enrolled 105 patients affected by OHCA brought to the Emergency Room from June 2016 to August 2017. Patients wereFig. 1 (abstract P421). Mean \u00b1 SD time percentage of signal capture from ROSC to hospital admission during total time for each variable enrolled regardless of their age, comorbidities, aetiology and first rhythm documented. We compared Period 1 (Jun-Dec 2016) in which the system was just started, with Period 2 (Jan-Aug 2017) where the system would had reached a good level of reliability. We compared hospital survival and neurological outcome through Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC). We also evaluated the use of a MCC device, the necessity of an Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS), the rate of coronary angiography (PCA) and organ procurement with special attention to the NHBD Results: OHCA increased from 39 in Period 1 to 66 in Period 2 (Table 1). The use of MCC increased by 8%. ECLS treatment in the Emergency Room increased by 8%, while PCA significantly raised of 20%. Both survival and neurological outcome showed no differences between groups. We detected a 4% increase in NHBD without any statistical significance Conclusions: This new protocol has allowed a larger number of OHCA to reach the Emergency Room and it has made possible for 16 patients to start an ECLS.

The survival-to-hospital discharge rate ranges from 0% to 31.2%, in contrary to a mean estimate of survival rate of 54% from the general public. Studies showed that the knowledge of CPR was poor among the general public and their expectation on CPR outcome may not be realistic. Related information among local population is limited and therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of knowledge in local population in Hong Kong, and establish opinions of the general public regarding CPR on OHCA patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire study administered in community settings to the volunteer respondents over January to December 2016. Descriptive statistics including public opinion on survival-to-discharge rate and duration of resuscitation were reported. Logistic regression and factor analysis were performed to identify factors that public opined a physician should consider to decide continuation of resuscitation. Results: Among 416 respondents, the mean estimate of predicted survival-to-discharge rate after cardiac arrest was 48.4% (median 50%; IQR 20-70%). Mean estimated duration of resuscitation to withdraw from CPR was 43 minutes (median 30 min; IQR 20-60 min). Physicians' opinion and prediction of outcome, premorbid state and age of patient were the three factors that the survey respondents considered most important for decision making on resuscitation. Conclusions: The public had inaccurate perceptions regarding resuscitation time, procedures, interventions and survival rate. Unrealistic high survival rate was expected on the basis of limited acceptance of different resuscitation interventions. Better public education was necessary.P425 Metabolomic profile in ventricular fibrillation arrest and return of spontaneous circulation E Locci 1 , G Karlis 2 , A Gulati 3 , A Noto 1 , F Rosa 1 , M Mura 1 , G Finco 1 , E D'Aloja 1 , P Scano 1 , T Xanthos 4 University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; 2 General Hospital of Rodos, Rodos, Greece; 3 University of Chicago, Chicago, USA; 4 European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P425",

Current guidelines recommend emergency angiography in patients without an obvious extra-cardiac cause of arrest[1]. However, the value of this strategy is debated. Moreover, diagnosis of acute coronary ischaemia after OHCA remains challenging, especially in patients without ST-segment elevation. Methods: Retrospective single-centre study including a consecutive series of 123 patients resuscitated from OHCA. Baseline characteristics and resuscitation settings were analysed. Our aim was to identify qualitative variables associated with an increased chance of 30-day survival after OHCA. Afterwards, we sought to identify parameters associated with a positive coronary angiography in patients with a cardiac aetiology and absence of ST-segment elevation. Results: The independent predictors of the 30-day outcome after OHCA included haemodynamic instability (OR 5.39; 95% CI 1.60-18.13), witnessed cardiac arrest (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.05-0.35) and coronary angiography (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05-0.43) (Table 1). Factors associated with a positive coronary angiogram in patients without STsegment elevation included personal history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (P<0.001) and male gender (P=0.005). Diabetes and dyslipidaemia were the most related cardiovascular risk factors (P<0.05). Presence of at least two cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) was statistically predictive of CAD in this population (P<0.001) (Table 2). Conclusions: We investigated qualitative predictors of 30-day survival after OHCA. Our findings suggest that the identification of patients with a better prognosis might be improved. We also identified predictors for a positive angiography in patients without ST-segment elevation. Therefore, the identification of risk criteria may help to select the best candidates for emergency angiography.1. Windecker S, Kolh P et al.

This model contained sex, diabetes, initial rhythm, percutaneous coronary intervention, presence of BIS value of 0, lactate and neuron-specific enolase at hour 48 as predictive variables for good neurological outcome. Conclusions: Based on a prognostic model containing variables readily available following ICU admission, good neurological outcome after OHCA was predicted best at hour 48.

Methods: This is retrospective case record review. Inclusion criteria were all patients who had non-traumatic OHCA conveyed by emergency medical services to our Emergency Department, who had ROSC and started TH in ED for the period 1st Aug 2012 to 31st Aug 2014. Exclusion criteria were traumatic OHCA and all patients declared dead at scene. Data collection followed Ustein template. EMS data were from National Cardiac Arrest registry. Data of patients admitted were from ED and inpatient electronic case records. Patient were followed up for 30 days. All OHCA were conveyed by EMS to EDs for continued care. Paramedic are trained in advanced life support. All airway was managed with supraglottic airway device, placed on mechanical compression device and intravenous adrenaline were administered. Our targeted temperature for TH was 34\u00b0C and followed a 24hrs cooling protocol in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: There was 888 nontraumatic OHCA. 225 had ROSC in ED but only 23 received TH. Of 23 who received TH, 5 died in ED, 18 were admitted. 12 subsequently died in hospital while 4 were alive at 30 days. 2 had cerebral performance category (CPC) 4, 1 had CPC 3 and 1 had CPC 1. Among patients who received TH, 10 were witnessed arrest by family, 4 by EMS provider, 1 by healthcare provider and 8 were unwitnessed. 15 did not received bystander CPR. 2 had bystander AED applied. The initial rhythm by EMS were 13 asystole, 7 PEA, 2 VF and 1 unknown. 2 had field ROSC. Conclusions: 10% of patients who had ROSC in ED had TH. Patients who received TH did not have good outcomes, although 65% had a witnessed arrest, most did not have VF as initial rhythm.P429A strategy to effect neurologically-intact survival for children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest PE Pepe 1 , PR Banerjee 2 , RA Vittone 2 , A Singh3  , L Ganti 3 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA; 2 Polk County (Florida) Fire Rescue Department, Bartow, Florida, USA; University of Central Florida, Kissimmee, Florida, USA Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P429",

Guidewire retention accounts for 50% of never events in UK emergency medicine[1]. The WireSafe is an engineered solution which prevents this[2]  and is currently being implemented by NHS England as an evidence-based, cost-effective preventative engineered solution for central venous catheter insertions[3]. Methods: With IRB approval and written consent, 20 chest drain competent doctors, but with no knowledge of the WireSafe, were randomised to standard or WireSafe groups. They were presented with a scenario to complete, where a colleague who had been urgently called away midway during a Seldinger drain insertion. The manikin had a 12G drain in-situ with a visible guidewire 'accidentally' left in the lumen. If asked, the assistant stated only that the WireSafe was a new procedure pack containing the sutures and dressings which could be used as a sharps repository after placement. Results: The WireSafe prevented guidewire retention (100% WireSafe v 10% Standard, n=20, p<0.001, Fisher's Exact test). In the WireSafe group participants underwent searches of trolley, floor and/or sharps bin before the realisation of the intra-luminal location of the wire and all were removed. Conclusions: The WireSafe was 100% successful in preventing the never event of chest drain guidewire retention alongside facilitating fixation and sharps disposal.Introduction: Acquired neuromuscular weakness(ANMW) is a serious problem in eldery, with high incidence, morbidity and mortality. It appear early after an acute stress, last for months and frequently has a difficult recovery Methods: After Informed Consent, 127 patients 70-101 yo admitted in the Orthopedic Surgical Department with traumatic femoral bone fracture, were enrolled in an one year prospective, observational study. We assess the incidence of ANMW on admission, at discharge and at 3 months after using the Medical Research Council Sume Score, the time until surgery, the type of anesthesia, the severity of postoperative pain using VAS Score, the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction, using MMSE score, the adecquate postoperative nutrition Results: At admission, 13 patients already had neuromuscular weakness and were excluded from the study.At 3 postoperative day 16 patients developed ANMW. At discharge from the hospital, 49 patients were diagnosed with ANMW and were allocated in group B, the others without ANMW were allocated in group A. The time until surgery was significantly higher in group B 67.3 vs 10.5 h, p<0.05: Concerning the type of anesthesia, in group A 84.6% had spinal/regional techniques of anesthesia vs 65.3% in group B, p<0.05. Concerning VAS score at 24 h, 51% of patients from group B experienced severe pain vs 6.15% in group A and 34.6% of group B experienced moderate pain vs 16.9% in group A, p<0.05 The incidence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction was 6.15% in group A vs 36.6% in group B, the caloric intake was 87.2% of the requirements in group A and 61.3% in group BConclusions: We could conclude that are many important factors implied in the development of ANMW and some of them we could influence by early surgical procedure, loco-regional techniques of anesthesia, adequate pain control and optimal nutrition.Introduction: Previous literature has suggested low Psoas Lumbar Vertebral Index (PLVI) scores are associated with worse morbidity following major trauma, possibly related to admission frailty[1]. Methods: Retrospectively analysis of Derriford Hospital's Major Trauma Network Database from April 2014-April 2016 was performed. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 65 and over with an injury severity score (ISS) >=9 who had an admission pan CT trauma series. All data was collected prospectively and included initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), mechanism of injury, and a comprehensive list of injuries. Robust follow up included Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Length of Stay (LOS), Hospital LOS, 30 Day Mortality, and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) on discharge from hospital. PLVI was calculated as the mean psoas area at level of L4 pedicles indexed to the vertebral body area on the presentation trauma CT. Results: 302 patients met the inclusion criteria. Dichotomizing PLVI into a high (n=143) and low values (n=159) either side of the mean did not demonstrate that PLVI is an independent predictor of a bad outcome: Death at 30 days (OR 1.061 0.982-1.146 p 0.133), GOS 1/2/3 on discharge from acute hospital (OR 0.996 (0.895-1.108) p=0.939). Conclusions: Other factors are significant for worse prognosis on multivariate analysis: age, severity of injury and reduced GCS. More work is needed to identify sensitive and specific indicators of a poor outcome in elderly trauma patients to prevent inappropriate escalation of treatment and suffering.P443Rapid ultrasonographic assessment of undifferentiated shock in hypotensive patients E Tesfaye, T Zewude Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P443 Introduction: Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension (RUSH) protocol involves pulmonary evaluation with cardiac, abdominal, and venous examination applied for all undifferentiated hypotensive patients in a focused manner to diagnose, monitor, and treat emergency medical conditions[1]. The objective of this study was to assess the importance of RUSH protocol in identifying specific type of shock (Obstructve, Cardiogenic, Distributive and Hypovolumic) leading to early intervention in Emergency Department. Methods: The study design was prospective cross-sectional early bed-side ultrasound examination based on RUSH protocol on undifferentiated hypotensive patients in Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital. Patients received all needed standard therapeutic and diagnostic interventions without delay. They were followed until they received a final diagnosis after full evaluation. Results: A total of 93 patients with undifferentiated shock were eligible for ultrasound evaluation, of which 85 were diagnosed with specific shock types based on RUSH protocol and 8 patients had normal evaluation. The overall kappa correlation of the RUSH exam compared with the final diagnosis was 0.88 which is an almost perfect agreement. The p value was P=0.00 95% CI [0.926, 1.003), so that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between initial Ultrasound impression and final diagnosis r (91) =.98, p=.000.Hypovolemic shock showed 95.6% sensitivity with PPV of 89.6% and 89.6 % specificity with NPV of 95.6%. Distributive shock was 62.5% sensitive with PPV of 90.9% and 88.2% specific with NPV of 98.7%. Both cardiogenic and obstructive shocks showed 100% specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions: This study highlights the significant role of the RUSH protocol performed on initial evaluation of patients to diagnose shock etiology accurately and rapidly.ASST Monza, Monza, Italy; 2 University of Milan Bicocca, Milan, Italy; Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, Milan, Italy; 4 ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P444 Introduction: We aim to describe the observed medical events during two Papal visits (in 2012 and 2017) in the Milan area and compare them with those predicted by the commonly used Arbon score [1]. Published values in the literature are in the range of 0.5-2 for patientpresentation-rate to medical services (PPR) and around 0.03 (0.01-0.55) for transfer-to-hospital-rate (TTHR) both per 1.000 participants. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing scores have been applied to the events within 200.000 people. Furthermore, existing works are limited to a descriptive analysis of single events in different locations.Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of data collected during two events in the Milan Area: the papal visit in April 2017 was located in Monza, an outdoor vast location. A similar location was used for the papal visit in June 2012, the Bresso airport. The climate was mild (65%-69% humidity). Crowds was constituted manly by families, mood was relaxed and alcool was not available. It was estimated 400.000 participants in the 2017 and 450.000 in the 2012. Every medical event was recorded and PPR and TTHR calculated. Observed PPR and TTHR were compared with the expected calculated with Arbon regression model[1]. Results: The table summarizes medical PPR and TTHR observed and expected for the two events. The PPR was very similar for both events. In 2017 the TTHR was less than a half of that observed on 2012, likely due to different organization of the Medical Center. For both events, Arbon model underestimated patients presentations by 45% and 22%. Conclusions: Current predictive models underestimate PPR in large mass religious events gathering 400.000 participants or more. Our data suggest that in these events a PPR of 0,6-0,8 can be expected and this estimate could be used to plan similar future events, while TTHR can vary widely.",

Emergency medicine is a predominantly oral activity in which medical errors result from poor communication. Outcome-based studies have shown that language barriers in the ED lead to prolonged consultations, diagnostic insecurity, extra test orderings, and have a negative impact on patient health. Less attention has gone out to unravelling how miscommunication arises in these consultations and what can be done to prevent or overcome it. To fill this gap, this paper describes the dynamics of communication during consultations across a language barrier in the ED. Methods: Language-discordant ED consultations were audio-taped and multimodal contextual data were collected via ethnographicTable 1(abstract P444). Medical PPR and TTHR observed and expected for the two events participant observation. The transcripts of the audio-recordings were analysed from a clinical and an interactional sociolinguistic perspective by an interdisciplinary research team. Results: Communication across a language barrier generates a considerable amount of confusion. The causes, often invisible to the participants in the consultation, include misalignment of frames and goals, lack of mutual background information, lack of an adequate shared language repertoire and role conflicts. These causes are exacerbated by a context of stress, anxiety and tiredness. Language barriers are not absolute. Depending on the questions asked, the clinical tasks performed, and the communicative resources at the interactants' disposal, the intensity of a language barrier can vary over the course of the consultation, generating a \"communicative swing\". Interactants can use various strategies to prevent or repair miscommunication. Conclusions: Our research generates new insights that are relevant for clinical practice in language discordant environments and can be embedded relatively easily into clinical skills training.P447 Prognosis of patients admitted in the emergency department with intermediate lactate blood level H Ghazali, H Ben Turkia, W Derouiche, I Chermiti, R Jebri, A Azzouzi, S Chiboub, S Souissi Regional Hospital of Ben Arous, Ben Arous, Tunisia Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P447 Introduction: Objective: The measurement of lactate blood level is essential to evaluate the prognosis in critical phase.Many studies demonstrate that blood lactate level >= 4 mmol/l predict a high level of mortality in emergency department (ED). However, we don't found enough studies for intermediate blood lactate level. In this study we evaluate the prognosis of patients admitted in the ED with intermediate lactate blood level (2-3.9 mmol/l). Methods: Prospective monocentric study over six months. Inclusion of patients older than 18 years old admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of ED with systematic measurement of blood lactate level at admission.The lactate assess was classified in 3 levels: low level (lower than 2 mmol/l), intermediate (2-3.9 mmol/L) and high level (>=4mmol/l). Patients weredivided in 2 subgroups: with or without hemodynamic instability. Prognosis was evaluated in hospital mortality at 7 day. Results: Inclusion of 146 patients. Mean age =58\u00b121, sex ratio=1.7. Level blood lactate n(%): : low (<2 mmol/L) 36 (25), intermediate (2-3,9 mmol/L) 66 (45) and high (>= 4 mmol/L) 43 (30). The mortality rate in the group of patient with intermediate lactate was 14 % at 7 day. In the subgroup of patient with normal blood pressure and intermediate blood lactate level, the mortality was estimated at 12.8% compared to 16% in the subgroup of patient with hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: The intermediate lactate blood level in patients admitted in ED is associated to a significant risk of mortality. This population should be supervised closely and have an optimal management.P448 Respiratory emergencies at children at pre-hospital stage L Petcu, A Ghidirimschi, B Golovin, N Catanoi, N Scurtov National Centre of Prehospital Emergency Medicine, Chisinau, Moldova Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P448 Introduction: The respiratory emergencies at pre-hospital stage are defined as clinical situations that endanger the child's life and which require urgent transport to the Emergency Hospitalization Unit. In the structure of the incidence of respiratory emergencies in the Republic of Moldova at children, it records the highest percentage.Methods: In the period of January 2016-June 2016 at the prehospital stage were registered per total 30957 requests of respiratory emergencies. Results: From the total number of registered requests was determined a higher preponderance of respiratory emergencies at children in rural area of 61.02% and in urban area of 38.95%. The big respiratory emergencies was determined in 14.39% of cases of which respiratory insufficiency of II-III degree in 11.6% of cases affecting children with age of 0-12 months, respiratory distress 0.06% of cases at children of 0-6 months, acute laryngitis -tracheobronchitis 2.6% of cases of high incidence at children with age of 6 Months-2 years. The respiratory emergencies of II degree was of 81.4%, including acute pneumonia in 7.5% cases, acute bronchitis in 6.6%, acute respiratory tract infection associated with febrile syndrome in 67.5% cases. From the respiratory emergencies of III degree in the majority of cases are viral respiratory infections, representing 4.1% of cases. The first aid measures were carried out to all patients, as a result from the total number of patients, 86.8% were transported to the emergency hospitalization department with monitoring of hemodynamic indices. Conclusions: As a result, from the total number of medical-surgical emergencies at children, the respiratory emergency records the highest incidence, most frequently affecting children with age of 0-12 months. In order to prevent major complications, it is necessary that the emergency nurse to identify the life-threatening signs and symptoms with their stabilization.P449 Fatigue-related risk in ED: the effect of reduction and proofing strategies on occupational performance and well-being P B\u00e9rast\u00e9gui 1 , A Ghuysen 2 , A Nyssen 1 Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium; 2 Centre Hospitalier Universitaire du Sart Tilman, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P449",

Results: We conducted linear mixed-effect models to investigate the relationships between FRS, FPS, fatigue, performance and burnout. Conclusions: Our results suggest that FRS and FPS allow residents to maintain acceptable occupational performance at the expense of individual factors.Evaluation of the prescription of complementary examinations in the emergency department M Khaldi, H Sandid, E Missaoui, A Mahmoudi, M Methammem CHU Farhat Hached, sousse, Tunisia Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P450Introduction: Medicine of nowdays allows the clinician to use a large number of complementary examinations to facilitate and improve the management of the patient's health, but unjustified prescriptions are frequently observed, leading to unnecessary effort for caregivers, laboratory and radiology technicians, not to mention the time lost for parents, the cost generated, the pain inflicted and the risks of error inherent in any investigation. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive and analytical monocentric study carried out in the Emergency Department of the Farhat Hached University Hospital of Sousse, Tunisia. All patients were randomly recruited from during a three-month period from September 2016 to December 2016. Patients were selected for two hours randomly chosen during the day with exclusion criteria : Patients under 15 years of age consulting for non-traumatic pathology victims of cardio-respiratory arrest or early death (before the establishment of the examination), outgoing patients against medical advice, patients escaped, patients referred with a preestablished diagnosis. Results: 179 patients including 42.4% men and 57.6% women were included in our study, additional examinations were performed in 144 patients (80.4% of the population), it means 728 exams in total. 494 examinations were of biological nature (67.85%), 105 radiological examinations (14.42%) and 129 other types (17.73%). 68, 7% of these examinations were prescribed by interns, 29.6% by residents and only 1.7% by seniors who were only informed in 48% of cases. Patients stayed on average 178 minutes (approximately 3 hours) with extremes of 10 minutes to 1540 minutes (25 hours and 35 minutes). Conclusions: One of the main causes of delayed recovery of complementary examinations is the lack of coordination and management of different health personnel, doctors, nurses and stretcher-bearers.P451Cardiogenic shock complicating st segment elevation myocardial infarction: prognosis in the emergency department.F Riahi, S Souissi, M Mabrouk, A Aloui, C Ben Slimane, W Derouiche, A Zoubli, N ElHeni Regional Hospital of Ben Arous, Ben Arous, Tunisia Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P451Introduction: Cardiogenic shock (CS) continues to be the most common cause of death in patients hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Immediate diagnosis and early reperfusion were required to improve the prognosis. objective: To identify prognostic factors related to mortality in CS complicating STEMI admitted in Emergency department (ED). Methods: Prospective observational study(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016). Inclusion: STEMI with CS. Criteria for CS: systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg for longer than 30 minutes and signs of impaired organ perfusion. The prognostic factors related to mortality in ED were identified by a multivariate comparative study. Results: Among the 902 patients presented with STEMI, the overall incidence of CS was 8% (n=75). Mean age was 64 +/-10 years, sex ratio was 3. The median delay of consultation was 180 min. Fibrinolytic drug was administered in 42 patients with a success rate of 20%. Mortality in ED was 21%. The univariate comparative study between dead (N=16) and living patients (N=59) identified the following mortality-related factors: onset of chest pain -first medical contact (352+/-280 vs 295+/-290 min), respiratory rate (27+/-6 vs 20 +/-8 cycles/min), killip score of III or IV (69% vs 34%, p<0.001), extensive anterior infraction (69% vs 37%, p=0.02), right ventricular infraction (44% vs 17%, p= 0.02). In Multivariate analysis, mortality-related factors were: anterior infraction, Odds ratio(OR): 2.83; 95% confidence interval CI (1.24-6.71), the right ventricle infarction OR: 3.80; 95%CI (1.49-9.70) and killip score III or IV OR: 2.61; 95% CI (1.22-5.56). Conclusions: Among patients who had CS complicating STEMI, extensive anterior infarction, right ventricle infarction and killip score of III or IV at the admission are independent factors of poor prognosis that require early transfer to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention capable center without delay. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia in the critically ill patientsY Panahi, N Sobhani, MA Safarpour, M Chahabi Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P452Introduction: Drug-induced thrombocytopenia are severe complications in intensive care unit (ICU) that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the etiology and risk factors of the drug-induced thrombocytopenia associated with various drugs in the ICU. Methods: One hundred and forty-four critically ill patients during the 6 months entered into this study. Patients monitored for 14 days after ICU admission. During this period of time complete blood count, ALT, AST, Serum creatinine, Lactate, blood PH, Na, K, Mg and calcium measured before, 7, and 14 days' post ICU admission. During this period of time SOFA score, APACHE II Score, RASS Score, concurrent disease, sepsis, drugs with exact dosage and time of administration investigated daily. The study was a descriptive and analytical that conducted in the general and surgical ICUs. Patients had at least 18 years old age who had been admitted to the ICU for more than 48 hours. Full medical and hematological, biochemical profile and history and all drug were recorded and analyzed. Results: The total of 144 patients was included. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was 45.9% and the highest rate was recorded in the period of 3-5 days post ICU admission (30.1%). There was no correlation between age, sex, the cause of admission, type of ICU, mechanical ventilation and rate of thrombocytopenia. Underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, Serum creatinine level and mean atrial pressure had a correlation with thrombocytopenia. APACHE II and SOFA scores were a significant positive correlation with thrombocytopenia (P<0.001, P=0.005). Drugs include vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, digoxin, and colistin has a correlation with thrombocytopenia (P<0.001). Conclusions: The incidence of thrombocytopenia in the patients admitted to the ICU was high. Thrombocytopenia could an indicator for severity of the diseases. Therefore, determination of thrombocytopenia and it's etiology in the ICU is very important.P453 Effectiveness of simulation-based learning in intravenous medication safety: a randomized controlled study JC Servotte 1 , I Bragard 1 , AF Donneau 1 , N Dardenne 1 , M Guillaume 1 , R Tubes 1 , B Cardos 1 , B Pilote 2 , IL Simoneau 3 , IL Simoneau 3 , A Ghuysen 1 Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium; 2 Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada; C\u00e9gep de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P453",

Since targets and interventions are multiple and pertain to all physiological systems, caregivers may consider clinical practice guidelines as a precious tool. The objective of this systematic review was to identify clinical practice guidelines in order to describe practices around the world. High variability in practices among countries was expected. Findings will permit to identify the needs for future research. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult and paediatric brain dead organ donors. An electronic search strategy was conducted, using MeSh terms and appropriate key words, in 11 databases, from theFig. 2 (abstract P456). Flow chartFig. 1 (abstract P456). In line filtrationFig. 1 (abstract P455). Qic pic particles analyser earliest accessible date. A manual search was also conducted in Google in 9 different languages. Specific national transplantation organizations were directly contacted according to IRODAT data. Titles and abstracts were screened in duplicated and 2 independent reviewers abstracted data using a pre-tested data collection form. Quality of publications was assessed using the AGREE-II instrument. Results: The search strategy using combined databases yielded 18 485 entries from which 8 guidelines were included. Combined with the results of the manual search, 25 clinical practice guidelines from 19 countries were finally included. We collected data on 7 predetermined clinical domains. Important heterogeneity in recommendations was found, particularly in the hemodynamic management, targets and monitoring as well as hormone replacement therapy domains. The majority of recommendations concerned adult donors only. The publications were in majority judged of low quality. Conclusions: This review on the management of brain dead organ donor management highlights the high heterogeneity of recommendations and low methodological quality in guidelines around the world. Improvement in recommendations depends largely on future evidence-based studiesP458 Implementing of active brain dead donor identification strategy does not affect potential donor pool: one year experience in a single donor center T Tamosuitis, I Maraulaite, A Trilikauskiene, D Damanskyte, D Lukminaite, N Balciuniene Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno klinikos, Kaunas, Lithuania Critical Care 2018, 22(Suppl 1):P458",

The Royal College of Anaesthetists report 'The Pathway to Better Surgical Care'[1]  highlighted the importance of enhanced perioperative care for high risk patients. OIR is not a High Dependency Unit but patients receive invasive monitoring, vasopressors and enhanced respiratory support under the supervision of recovery staff and anaesthetists. Limited critical care capacity, greater complexity and an aging population are increasing demand. The Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine's report 'Critical Futures' recommends establishing standards for level 1+ care. We aimed to establish scope of practice, measure efficacy and quality and improve standards. Methods: Projects were registered and patient feedback was collected between January 2016 and January 2017. A Staff survey was completed by nursing, surgical and anaesthetic staff. Baseline efficiency was measured between July 2016 to January 2017. Changes were implemented and measures repeated in September 2017 and October 2017.",

            "text": "Introduction: Workload resulting from in-flight emergencies has not been quantitatively analysed in the literature. For hospitals local to major airports, this may have significant financial implications. Methods: Review was carried out of all cases admitted to East Surrey Hospital from Gatwick Airport over a 23 year period beginning in 1993. Data were collected by interrogating the ICNARC database. Demographics, presenting pathology and length of stay for each patient were recorded. In addition, the cost of care for patients admitted during 2016 was calculated using recent median figures for intensive care admission (local CCG rates). Results: Since 1993, 196 patients were admitted from Gatwick Airport. This was approximately 2% of our critical care admissions. The mean (SD) age was 58.3 (14.5) years, and the median [IQR] length of stay 3 [1.1 -6.7] days. Around 24% of these patients were non-UK or EU nationals and therefore not entitled to NHS care. Reasons for admission included cardiac (37.2%), respiratory (23.6%), central nervous system (12.6%), and gastrointestinal issues (12%). During 2016, 11 patients were admitted resulting in a total of 48.4 patient days in critical care. The total cost attributable to this group of patients was calculated to be \u00a360,500. Conclusions: There is a substantial additional financial burden on hospitals that regularly receive admissions from major airports simply due to their geographical location. There is no additional funding available for providing this service. The pattern of presenting conditions in our population is similar to that seen in previous reports describing inflight emergencies [1]. Given the increasing accessibility of air travel and the economic pressures on healthcare providers, further analysis of the financial impact of this patient group on certain hospitals would be welcome. Methods: We developed a Monte-Carlo simulation [3] with separate referral rates for emergency, elective, and ventilated patients. Bed occupancy is classified according to admission type with a conversion to prolonged ventilated stays at a rate of 4% [4]. We used data from our Neurointensive care unit to complete the parameters required for the model e.g. 13 beds and 1,725 referrals/day. Outcome measures were bed occupancy, and failed admissions. We tested two scenarios: increased referral rate (4.5/day), and increasing to 20 beds. Results: The model simulated our intensive care where we have a high occupancy rate. Increasing referral rate led to a consumed ICU and an increase in failed admissions (Fig. 1) . Lastly, increasing bed numbers eased pressures with fewer failed admissions. Conclusions: We recommend a personalised ICU Monte-Carlo population model for specialist units for a more accurate representation of ICU bed occupancy. These ICU specific models should be more useful for predicting staff, bed and financial requirements in specialist units where healthcare resources are changing e.g. increasing geographical referral radius. Conclusions: Better patient flow increased occupancy and standards. Staff education and clear protocols are needed to improve patient booking and efficiency. assess stress levels and causes of stress among doctors and nurses at University Hospital Lewisham and Queen Elizabeth Hospital Woolwich. We surveyed staff using UK Health and Safety Executive's Management Standards (HSEMS), a 35-question validated tool which identifies stressful work conditions requiring intervention. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey of doctors and nurses working in Intensive Care, Accident and Emergency (A&E), Acute Medicine, Anaesthetics and Surgery over six weeks. Results were analysed using the HSEMS Analysis Tool and broken down into seven areas: job demands, managers' support, peer support, relationships, role, level of control and possibility of change. Each area was scored from 1-5 (5 represents lowest stress). We compared the Trust's results against national standards. Results: 283 healthcare professionals completed the survey. Intensive Care had the lowest stress levels and scored above average in all areas (n=55, mean 3.80, S.D. 0.39). This was followed by A&E (n=90, mean 3.63, S.D. 0.45), Anaesthetics (n=57, mean 3.58, S.D. 0.54), Surgery (n=42, mean 3.33, S.D. 0.47) and Acute Medicine (n=39, mean 3.25, S.D. 0.53) which had the highest stress levels. When compared to HSEMS targets peer support exceeded national standards. However, there is a clear need for improvement in staff's ability to control and change their working environment. Conclusions: Stress Levels on Intensive Care were reassuringly low when compared to other departments as well as national standards. We identified areas that need improvement and with the support of hospital management we will initiate HSEMS-validated measures to reduce stress.",

Little is known about the impact of CPR phone instructions on the outcome of patients (pts) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The target of this study is to investigate the impact of phone instructions on mortality, and on neurological outcomes of patients who survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: We enrolled pts admitted to ICU after ROSC following out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest, from 1/1/2008 to 30/06/2016; pts younger than 18, in-hospital cardiac-arrest-victims, pts who underwent cardiac arrest in health facilities, and missing data records were excluded. Written informed consensus was obtained for all pts during follow up. Data about comorbility, mortality, neurologic outcome, CPR timing according to Utstein Style, complications in ICU, metabolic state on ER admission, were collected. Study population was divided into two groups for statistical analysis: pts with immediate CPR guided by phone instructions (Phone-CPR group) and those who did not underwent immediate CPR by laic bystanders. Data were extracted from ICU, EMS databases and registered EMS phone calls. Results: 172 pts met study criteria. Phone CPR were given in 25 cases, 15% of the whole study population. Results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 Conclusions: Phone-CPR significantly reduced CPR-free interval. It correlates with a significative increase in shockable rhythms on EMS arrival. There is no significative reduction in mortality and in disability, even if a decrease trend can be observed. Phone-CPR seem to be a promising, effective and easy to use tool to improve survival and disability in ROSC, and should be widely applied.",

Methods: This is a substudy of the TTH-48 study, where cardiac arrest (CA) patients were randomized to receive therapeutic hypothermia treatment for either 24 or 48 h [1] . Hypotension within four days from admission was recorded and defined as mild, moderate, severe or circulatory failure. Arrhythmias were recorded and classified as mild, moderate or severe. We calculated the incidence and distribution of severity of the events. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to test association of admission data with any hypotension or any arrhythmia. Results: Of all patients, 55.1% had hypotension which was mild in 58.2%, moderate in 27.3%, severe in 7.7% cases. 6.7% had circulatory failure. An arrhythmia was present in 44% of patients. Of these, 45.1% were mild, 29% moderate and 25.8 % severe. Bradycardia (N=3), new CA (N=1) and circulatory shock (N=1) were hemodynamic reasons for preterm rewarming. In multivariate analysis age (p=0.005, OR 1.033) and admission MAP (p=0.005, OR 1.020) were significantly associated with hypotensive complications. Only use of mechanical compressions was significantly associated with risk for arrhythmia (p=0.007, OR 0.380). Conclusions: Hypotension and arrhythmias were frequent in cardiac arrest patients during days 1-4 from admission, but mostly mild or moderate in severity. Age and admission MAP were associated with hypotension. Only the use of mechanical compressions was independently (negatively) associated with arrhythmias. Introduction: In a retrospective study from the Pittsburgh clinic, which analyzed survival data from 591 patients admitted to a hospital with a cardiac arrest outside the hospital, it was found that patients with opioid overdose showed significant improvements in neurological status when discharged from the hospital compared with patients who did not receive opioids [Elmer J. et al., 2015] . Methods: After local ethic committee approval 190 case-records of patients with cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation for the period 2006 -2017 in the clinic of traumatology and orthopedics in Astana were analyzed. Criteria for inclusion in the study were hospital cardiac arrest, trauma to the musculoskeletal system. Results: Out of 190 case-records, 17 (8.9%) patients with out-ofhospital cardiac arrest were excluded. Among all hospital stops of blood circulation, we found only 25 successful CPR (14.5%). Among the patients who were successfully resuscitated, 2 groups were identified: I -16 patients (64%) who received ketamine or/and opioids before the blood circulation stopped (0-180 minutes); II -9 patients (36%) who did not receive these medicines. The mean age in group I of patients was 39.1 \u00b1 5.7 years, in group II -43.2 \u00b1 6.2 years (p> 0.05). Patients of the second group had an average life expectancy of 2.7 \u00b1 0.9 days, with a maximum postresuscitation life of 4 days. Patients of the first group were in the hospital for 17.9 \u00b1 2.1 days (p < 0.05), with a maximum period of 98 days. In the first group, the final neurologic evaluation according to the Glasgow scale was 11.4 \u00b1 2.3 points, while in the second group it was 6.2 \u00b1 1.2 points (p < 0.05). Conclusions: A retrospective analysis revealed a better survival and neurological outcome in patients who received ketamine or/and opioids before circulatory arrest.Introduction: The revised Organ Transplant Law was enacted in Japan in 2010. Under the revised law, it is now possible to donate organs with the consent of the family even if the intention of the potential donor is unknown. Organs from brain-dead children under the age of 15 can also be donated. Methods: The aim of this study was to assess how to provide prompt transplant medical care and improve the donor's condition. This was achieved by clarifying the problems encountered in the process leading to brain-dead organ transplantation at our institute before and after the enactment of the revised Organ Transplant Law. There were 79 cases of organ donation at our institute from January 2003 to June 2015. Among them, the background factors of 42 cases leading to organ donation were examined. Results: The causes of the brain-dead condition were cerebrovascular disease (n = 15; 11 subarachnoid hemorrhage, 4 intracerebral hemorrhage), trauma (n = 8), suffocation (n = 5), cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival (n = 5), suicide by hanging (n = 3), cardiomyopathy (n = 1), and lethal arrhythmia (n = 1). The organs donated for transplantation were 54 kidneys, 32 eyes, 12 lungs, 8 livers, 7 hearts, and 6 tissues (i.e., heart valve, bone, and skin). The time lapses were as follows. The number of days from informed consent to family acceptance was 0.6 days before the enactment of the revised Organ Transplant Law and 1.5 days after the revision. The number of days from informed consent to organ removal was 2.5 days before the revision and 3.1 days after the revision. Even after the enactment of the revised Organ Transplant Law in Japan, it still takes about 3 days from informed consent to organ removal, with no current initiatives to shorten the time to organ removal. Conclusions: Although 7 years have passed since the enactment of the revised Organ Transplant Law in Japan, there are still administrative and management problems that need to be addressed to achieve optimal organ transplantation.",

Recent studies show that acetaminophen protects from damage due to lipid peroxidation in sepsis [1] . The aim of this study is to detect changes in sublingual microcirculation after the infusion of a standard dose of acetaminophen in febrile septic patients. Methods: Prospective observational study on 50 adult septic patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit.

Uncommunicative conscious patients with acute ischemic stroke were included in the study and randomly allocated to 2 groupsdexmedetomidine (D) and propofol (P). The sedation goal was the same in the both group (RASS 0 to -2). Patients in group D receive dexmedetomidine infusion in dose 0. Conclusions: In this prospective randomized study dexmedetomidine comparing to propofol was associated with higher sedation quality and lower incidence of complication during acute ischemic stroke patients sedation for MRI.",

Introduction: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) showed some advantages in the sedation of patients in intensive care unit (ICU) [1] . Other studies described efficacity of DEX in ICU delirium [2] . The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacity and safety of DEX after lung transplantation in ICU. Methods: We conducted a prospective monocentric study in our surgical ICU between november 2015 at november 2017. In the first part of the study (november 2015 at november 2016), lung recipients did not received DEX; in the second part of the study DEX was used for the sedation in mechanically ventilated patients after lung transplantation. We compared the duration of mechanical ventilation in the two groups and the occurence of adverse effects. Results: In total 59 lung recipients were enrolled. There was no difference between the two groups in demographic data, one or double-lung transplants, the cause of lung transplantation and the use of epidural infusion. In the DEX group, mechanical ventilation support was 118 hours versus 98.5 hours in the other group (p=0.55). There was no difference between delirium in the two groups (3/5, p=0.7). The occurence of adverse events like hypotension and bradycardia was significantly higher in the DEX group (4/0 for hypotension, p=0.013; 6/0 for bradycardia, p=0.0012). Conclusions: The use of DEX after lung transplantation in ICU was not more efficience for the mechanical ventilator weaning. Lung recipients delirium was significantly the same in the two groups. The most notable effect was the occurence of bradycardia and hypotension in the DEX group.Introduction: DEXPED evaluated the impact of a prolonged exposure (>= 24 hours) to dexmedetomidine on the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), length of PICU and hospital stay and use of other sedative agents. Methods: DEXPED is a retrospective cohort study that included patients aged 0 to 18 years, admitted to the PICU of the Montreal Children's Hospital between November 1st 2011 and April 25th 2015, requiring IMV and sedative agents for >= 48 hours. Patients exposed to dexmedetomidine during IMV (n=53) were compared to non exposed patients (n=159) using a propensity score analysis (1:3 ratio). , and received more opioids and benzodiazepines. However, a secondary analysis redefining exposure as initiation of dexmedetomidine within the first 48 hours from intubation suggested that exposure was associated with a greater short-term probability of extubation, although this study was not powered to perform this analysis. Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine was associated with a longer duration of IMV. However, the association was inversed when patients received dexmedetomidine as a primary sedative agent. It is uncertain whether this difference of associations is due to immortal time bias or clinical features. Timing of initiation of dexmedetomidine in relationship to other sedatives may impact patient outcomes and should be considered in the planning of future trials. is an \u03b12-agonist which has been increasingly used for analgosedation. Despite of many papers published, there are still only a few concerning the PK of the drug given as long-term infusion in ICU patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of DEX and to investigate the potential benefits of individualization of drug dosing based on patient characteristics in the heterogeneous group of medical and surgical patients staying in ICU. Methods: All the subjects were sedated according to modified Ramsay Sedation Score of 3-4. Blood samples for DEX assay were collected on every day of the infusion and at the selected time points after its termination. The DEX concentrations in the plasma were measured using LC-MS/MS method. The following covariates were examined to influence DEX PK: age, sex, body weight, patients' organ function (SOFA score), catecholamines and infusion duration. Non-linear mixed-effects modelling in NONMEM (Version 7.3.0, Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA) was used to analyse the observed data. Results: Concentration-time profiles of DEX were obtained from 27 adult patients ( Table 1 ). The DEX PK was best described by a twocompartment model (Fig. 1) . The typical values of PK parameters were estimated as 27 L for the volume of the central compartment, 87.6 L for the volume of the peripheral compartment, 38.5 L/h (9.2 ml/min/kg for a 70 kg patient) for systemic clearance and 46.4 L/h for the distribution clearance. Those values are consistent with literature findings. We were unable to show any significant relationship between collected covariates and DEX PK. Conclusions: This study does not provide sufficient evidence to support the individualization of DEX dosing based on age, sex, body weight, SOFA, and infusion duration. seems to reduce the wakefulness time and the sleep fragmentation but, while we haven't found differences in sleep architecture using dexmedetomidine or propofol.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the implementation of an early mobilization protocol within the first 24 hours of admission and its impact on high functional status of the ICU. Methods: Retrospective study, from March 2013 to May 2017, evaluating patients admitted to the Neurological ICU, assessing the hemodynamic, respiratory and neurological variables in patients submitted to the early mobilization program, consisting of progressive therapeutic activities, including sedestation and orthostatism assisted on the board and evaluated the impact on the functional status/degree of high muscle strength of the ICU. Results: From March 2013 to May 2017, 11,219 patients were admitted to a neurological intensive care unit, of whom 9,873 were included in the early mobilization program. The mean age of the patients was 66.5 years, with SAPS 3 of 43.98 points (estimated mortality risk of 22.3%) and real mortality of 11.2%. During the program, 3% presented clinical instability, which was promptly reversed in all situations. Ninety-one percent of the patients presented maintenance or gain of muscle strength/functional status. Conclusions: The application of an early mobilization program within 24 hours of patient admission was shown to be safe, positively influencing the rehabilitation of neurological patients. Introduction: Given the worldwide rapidly aging of the population, the demand of critical care for elderly is increasing. Data on short -term outcomes of elderly patients after ICU discharge are sparse. The objective of our study was to assess short term outcomes of elderly after ICU discharge and their potential risk factors.Introduction: Patients aged 80 years or older presently account for approximately 10-15% [1] of all Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in Europe. The major challenge nowadays is to admit those elderly patients who will benefit from ICU treatment. The objective of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients >=80years old admitted to the ICU. Methods: Retrospective observational study of all patients aged >= 80 years admitted for >24h in 2016. Demographic data, admission diagnosis, APACHE II and SAPS II scores, use of ICU resources and mortality were collected. Results: 152 patients (25%) were included, with a mean age of 85,06. Female gender was more prevalent (51.3%). Mean length of stay was 4,48 days with mean SAPS II and APACHE II scores of 40,23 and 38,82 respectively. The most prevalent type of admission was medical, 70,4% (n=107) and from these the main reasons for admission were respiratory disease (n=45; 29,6%) and sepsis (n=32; 21%). ICU Mortality rate was 29,6% (n=45), whereas 6-month mortality was 31,5% (n=48).Survival rate was often related with cardiovascular (23 [15,1%], P<.001) and respiratory diseases (32 [21%], P=.01), whereas nonsurvivors were admitted due to sepsis and neurologic causes. Mortality rate was independent from the mean length of stay, noninvasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy, but dependent for previously comorbidities. Mechanical ventilation was an independent predictive factor of ICU mortality (P<.001) and 6-month mortality (P=.008). Conclusions: Nearly 70% of patients aged >= 80 years were discharged alive from ICU, and less than 50% survived 6 months after ICU admission.Our study revealed a better prognosis for admissions due cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Efforts should be done to identify earlier septic and neurological patients that benefit ICU treatment, and reevaluate the critical patient pathway, in this special population.Conclusions: More than 70% of ICU-survivors returned to work. Overall, the chance of return to work within two years was independent of the number of organ support therapies in patients with at least one organ support therapy. However, in subgroups, the chance of return to work decreased with increasing number of organ-support therapies.",

Unfortunately, studies evaluating the impact of critical illness on work-related outcomes are scarce.Therefore, we aimed to investigate factors associated with non-return to work among ICU survivors. Methods: A prospective cohort study involving ICU survivors of 6 Brazilian tertiary hospitals was conducted from May 2014 to August 2017. Patients with a ICU stay >72 h (for medical and emergency surgical ICU admissions) or >120 h (for elective surgical ICU admissions) who were discharged alive from the hospital were evaluated through a structured telephone interview 3 months after discharge from the ICU. A stepwise multivariate Poisson regression analysis adjusted by age, gender and years of education was used to evaluate the association of sociodemographic-and ICU-related variables with nonreturn to work. Results: In total 986 ICU survivors completed the 3-month follow-up. Of these, 285 (29%) were working before ICU admission. Only 113 of 285 patients (39%) returned to work within the first 3 months after discharge from the ICU. Percentage of risk of death at ICU admission (relative risk [RR], 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-3.29), decrease in physical functional status in relation to the pre-ICU period measured by Barthel Index (RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.48-2.35), not having a Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of physician's prediction of hospital mortality in critically ill patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) scarcity setting. Methods: Prospective cohort of acutely ill patients referred for ICU admission in an academic, tertiary hospital in Brazil. Physicians' prognosis and other variables were recorded at the moment of ICU referral. Results: There were 2374 analyzed referrals. Physician's prognosis was associated to hospital mortality. There were 593 (34.4%), 215 (66.4%) and 51 (94.4%) deaths in the groups ascribed a prognosis of survival without disabilities, survival with severe disabilities or no survival, respectively (p<0.001) (Fig. 1) . Sensitivity was 31%, specificity was 91% and the area under the ROC curve was 0.61 for prediction of mortality. After multivariable analysis, severity of illness, performance status and ICU admission were associated to an increased likelihood of incorrect classification, while worse predicted prognosis was associated to a lower chance of incorrect classification. Physician's level of expertise had no effect on predictive ability. Conclusions: Physician's prediction was associated to hospital mortality, but overall accuracy was poor, mainly due to low sensitivity to detect mortality risk. ICU admission was associated to increased incorrect classification, but there was no effect of physician's expertise on predictive ability.",

Introduction: Inescapable prognostic uncertainty, lack of decisionmaking capacity, risk of death or disability and long recovery trajectories complicate decision-making after traumatic brain injury. Methods: To elicit experienced physicians' perspective we interviewed 18 neurosurgeons, intensive care-and rehabilitation physicians from Oslo University Hospital about being in doubt about whether to offer, continue, limit or withdraw life-sustaining treatment and on how such cases were approached. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed using systematic text condensation by a clinician (AR) and a medical ethicist (RF). Results: The difficulty of decision-making when there is prognostic uncertainty was acknowledged, leading to adaptive approaches; willingness to change and adjust plans along the way. To have access to different opinions within the physician group was seen as constructive. Time-critical decisions were based on team discussions and physician's discretion. None-time critical decisions were reached through a process of creating common ground between the medical team and family. Themes physicians where in doubt about or expressed different opinions towards: 1) Appropriate aggressiveness of treatment in a given situation. 2) If and when to initiate discussions on appropriateness of treatment. Some believed that even addressing the issue in young patients or if small improvements were seen was inappropriate due to the possibility of late recovery. Physicians questioned the value of previously expressed patient's wishes in this context. 3) Optimal timing and type of decisions. The need for nuanced individualized plans was recognized. To have a plan as opposed to just \"wait and see\" was seen as especially important in medical unstable patients. Conclusions: Physicians expressed different views on appropriateness and optimal timing of level of care discussions and decisions in traumatic brain injury. A need for a more structured approach was exposed. Fig. 1 (abstract P520) .

Families were approached with a validated FS24-ICU family satisfaction survey questionnaire [1] . One hundred questionnaires were collected over a period of 3 months from January 2016 to March 2016 in our pediatric medical surgical and cardiac, adult cardiac and adult medical/surgical intensive care units. Results: The overall level of satisfaction rate was comparable to other high-income and developed countries with total satisfaction score, medical care score and decision making score of 75.1 \u00b1 14.2, 80.1 \u00b1 18.6, and 68.1 \u00b1 11.5 respectively (Table 1) . Conclusions: This is the very first study from the UAE demonstrating a high level of patient family satisfaction in both adult and pediatric intensive care units. This study also highlighted areas where further improvement needed to occur.Introduction: In order to apprehend the structural aspects and current practice of end-of-life care (EOLC) in German intensive care units (ICUs) managed by anesthesiologists, a survey was conducted to explore implementation and relevance of these items. Methods: In November 2015, all members of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) and the Association of German Anesthesiologists (BDA) were asked to participate in an online survey to rate 50 items. Answers were grouped into three categories: Category 1 reflecting high implementation rate and high relevance, category 2 low implementation and minor relevance, and category 3 low implementation and high relevance. Results: Five-hundred and forty-one anesthesiologists responded, representing just over 1/3 of anesthesiology departments running ICU's. The survey revealed new insights into current practice, barriers, perceived importance, relevance, and deficits of EOLC decisions. Only four items reached >= 90% agreement as being frequently performed, and 29 items were rated \"very\" or \"more important\". 28 items attributed to category 1, 6 to category 2, and 16 to category 3, representing a profound discrepancy between current practice and attributed importance. Items characterizing the most urgent need for improvement (category 3) referred to desirable quality of life, patient outcome data, preparation of health care directives and interdisciplinary discussion, advanced care planning, distinct aspects of changing goals of care, standard operating procedures, implementation of practical instructions, continuing EOLC education, and inclusion of nursing staff and families in the process. Conclusions: The survey generated awareness about deficits in EOLC matters in critical care. Consequently, already available EOLC tools have been made available through the website of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI): http:// www.ak-intensivmedizin.de/arbeitsforen.html.Introduction: This study evaluated differences in EOLP after 15 years in European ICUs that also participated in the Ethicus I study [1] . Methods: All previous Ethicus I centers were invited to participate in the Ethicus II study. Consecutive admitted ICU patients who died or had treatment limitations during a 6 month period from 1.9.2015 to 30.9.16 were prospectively studied. Previous EOLP and region definitions were used [1] . EOLP in the different regions of the Ethicus I study [1] were compared to the same ICUs in the Ethicus II study. Results: 22 of the original 37 ICUs participated again in this study. Figure 1 shows the differences in EOLP by region. Figure 2 notes differences in patient mental competency at the time of decision, information about patient's wishes and patient discussions in both Ethicus studies. Conclusions: Changes included less CPR (especially in the South) with more withholding and withdrawing therapies. There was a greater number of competent patients with discussions and knowledge of their wishes.Introduction: Palliative extubation is performed in patients with terminal ilnesses in which mechanical ventilation might prolong suffering. Even though the procedure involves nurses, respiratory therapists and doctors, some professionals feel unconfortable performing a palliative extubation. The concept of withdrawing life support can be easily confounded with euthanasia, specially in low income countries, where there is usually less education on palliative care. Methods: A questionary containing 6 open ended questions concerning a hypotetical case of intracerebral hemorrhage and prolonged coma, with potential indication for palliative extubation was applied to 13 members of an emergency department intensive care unit staff (6 doctors, 4 nurses, 3 respiratory therapists (RT). Results: More than half of the professionals (61%) had never participated in a palliative extubation. Four professionals (30%) believed palliative extubation is euthanasia. When asked about their own preferences in such a situation, only two (15%) would like to be tracheostomized. Symptoms anticipated by most professionals were dyspnea and respiratory secretions. Four (30%) would feel very uncomfortable performing palliative extubation because they either felt to be killing the patient or unable to manage symptoms Conclusions: Most professionals in this tertiary emergency intensive care unit never witnessed a palliative extubation. However, most of believe this procedure is beneficial. Some still cannot understand the difference between palliative extubation and euthanasia. Education in palliative care and withdrawal of life support can be helpful to clear concepts and relieve moral distress in the team.",
