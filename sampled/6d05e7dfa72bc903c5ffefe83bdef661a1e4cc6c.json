Despite numerous in vitro studies and preclinical models, little is known about their eff ects on the patients' immune system. We assessed immune alterations in the T-cell, NK-cell, dendritic cell, and monocytic compartments of steroidrefractory GVHD patients 30, 90, and 180 days after MSC (n=6) or placebo (n=5) infusion respectively. There were several indications that MSCs shift the patients' immune system towards a more tolerogenic profi le. Compared to placebo-treated patients, the infusion of MSCs was associated with increased levels of regulatory (FOXP3+ and IL-10+) T-cells, reduced pro-infl ammatory IL-17+ T-cells (Th17), and skewing towards type-2 T-helper cell responses. The frequency of CD25med-hiCD127loFOXP3+ CD4+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) was signifi cantly increased in the MSC group at one (p=0.003) and three (p=0.037) months. The Treg/ TH17 ratio at three months was 4.96\u00b15.25 in the MSC patients compared to 0.64\u00b10.44 in the controls (p=0.036). Furthermore IL-2, which has been recently shown to exert an immune modulating eff ect in GVHD patients, was 9.04\u00b18.89 pg/ml in the MSC patients three months after MSC-infusion, as opposed to 0.83\u00b11.22 pg/ml in the controls (p=0.008). Overall, our fi ndings will contribute to the refi nement of monitoring tools, for assessing MSC treatmenteffi cacy and increase our understanding regarding the MSCs' in vivo eff ects.",

The group consisted of patients with multiple myeloma (34), lymphoma (13) and acute myeloid leukemia (1). Blood samples were collected before chemotherapy and on the day of the fi rst apheresis. CEC were evaluated by 4-colour fl ow cytometry and cytokines with ELISA assay. Results: ANG1 was signifi cantly reduced in peripheral blood at the time of apheresis (Median, Me=2, 7vs7, 8 ng/ml at baseline, p <0,001). ANG2 signifi cantly increased during mobilization procedure (Me=3, 6vs2, 8 ng/ml at baseline, p=0.001). Osteopontin measured at the time of apheresis did not diff er from pretreatment values. Median number of CECs at baseline was 10.5/\u03bcl and decreased at the time of fi rst apheresis (Me=8.0/\u03bcl, p<0.001). Patients were divided according to the number of days of G-CSF treatment before fi rst apheresis into 'early' (<Me=11 days) and 'late' (>Me) mobilizers. The baseline CEC was higher in 'early mobilizers' than in the 'late mobilizers' (Me=12.5vs9.9/\u03bcl, p=0.04). Group of 'early mobilizers' presented also higher baseline ANG1 (Me=11, 6ng/ml) than the 'late mobilizers' group (Me=6, 0ng/ml, p=0.05). Correlations: Adverse correlation of duration of G-CSF treatment with baseline ANG1 level (r=-0,39, p=0,006) was observed. There was a trend for adverse correlation of baseline CEC number with the number of days of G-CSF treatment before I apheresis (r=-0.33, p=0.06). Correlations of osteopontin with ANG2 level (r=0,35, p=0,014) and ANG1 with CEC number (r=0,34, p=0,04) at baseline were observed. Conclusions: Higher baseline ANG1 levels as well as CEC counts are associated with shorter time of G-CSF treatment required for successful mobilization. Our observation indicates that the angiogenic factors can infl uence the timing of mobilization probably by their protective eff ect on endothelial and hematopoietic cells.

The introduction of \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR genes into \u03b1/\u03b2 T-cells allows the adoptive transfer of T cells that are not limited by HLA-restriction, in any patient with any cancer. Combinatorial \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR-exchange (CTE) has been applied to design a gamm9\u03b42 TCR with strong and broad anti-tumor reactivity, referred to as TCR \u03b39-G115/\u03b42-cl5. Here, we prepare this attractive candidate \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR for clinical application. First, we introduced both \u03b3 and \u03b4 chains into the retroviral vector pMP71, separated by a 2A peptide sequence. Gene-engineered human \u03b1/\u03b2 T-cells expressed the \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR and recognized tumors of diff erent hematological origin as well as solid tumors. Second, we tested expression and function of the \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR after addition of suicide genes which will enable in vivo elimination of therapeutic T cells. Following the introduction of either CD20 or EGFR separated with another 2A sequence from the TCR transgene cassette in pMP71, TCR expression and function was greatly impaired and as such this approach is not suitable for clinical application. Third, we tested the infl uence of the \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR transgene cassette and the particular 2A peptide sequence. Interestingly, the orientation of the \u03b3 and \u03b4 chains and the 2A peptide sequence infl uenced TCR expression as well as anti-tumor function as previously demonstrated for \u03b1/ \u03b2 TCR genes. All together, our results demonstrate that currently available suicide genes severely impair expression of introduced TCRs and functional avidity of engineered T-cells, thus are not useful for clinical application. In addition, modulating 2A sequences and the sequence of receptor chains allowed a deliberate choice for the most potent clinical \u03b3/\u03b4 TCR receptor cassette that will be used in our next TCR gene therapy trial.",

Indeed, CD123 overexpression is well known to be a poor prognosis marker in AML. With this system, the average transfection at 24hours was 68.9% (\u00b11.0, n=6) and mean survival percentage was 34.8% (\u00b15. 6, n=5) . Electroporation with the optimized stimulation protocol did not aff ect the phenotype of CIK cells, preserved their na\u00efve and stem cell memory populations, and resulted in a fold increase of 15.7\u00b13.3 at the end of the CIK culture at day 21. Transposed CIK cells displayed stable expression of Tr scFvCD123.3rdCAR (39.4%\u00b18.6), effi cient lysis of AML target cells, and CAR-specifi c cytokine secretion. Finally, long-term expansion (fold increase 423.8\u00b1301.4, n=2 at day 40) upon stimulation with AML cells in vitro promoted effi cient selection of CAR+ CIK cells with potent cytotoxic activity towards AML target (92.9\u00b11, n=2), suggesting long-term persistence of functional CIK cells in vivo.

Chakraverty UCL (London, GB) Adoptive immunotherapy with TCR-redirected T cells has potential to treat Cytomegalovirus infection or Epstein-Barr virus-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Immune suppressive drugs used to prevent rejection, or graft-versus-host disease, may inhibit adoptively transferred cells. We have evaluated the potential for gene transfer to T cells of mutated inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH2R; T333I, S351Y) which confers resistance to the immune suppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). IMPDH2R and IMPDH2 catalytic site mutant (IMPDH2CS; C331A) were cloned into SFG retroviral vectors fused to eGFP reporter sequences. Cells were transduced with each vector, their phenotype and function evaluated in the presence or absence of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of MMF. IMPDH2R-transduced murine thymoma (BW5147) cells exhibited less apoptosis in response to MPA than IMPDH2CS-transduced cells (ratio % Annexin V+ MPA:no MPA IMPDH2R =1.2; IMPDH2CS =2.9, p=0.01). IMPDH2R-transduced cells overcame MPA induced cell-cycle arrest (Ratio % in S-G2/M phases MPA: no MPA-IMPDH2R = 1.0; IMPDH2CS = 0.3, p=0.03). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells transduced with LMP2 TCR and either IMPDH2R or IMPDH2CS were stimulated with cognate peptide-loaded T2 cells. MPA exposure selected IMPDH2R but not IMPDH2CS-transduced cells. Selection persisted following subsequent stimulation without MPA. To assess in vivo selection, sub-lethally irradiated B6.PL (Thy1.1) mice were injected with a 1:1 mix of OT1 TCR transgenic CD8 T cells transduced with IMPDH2R or IMPDH2CS diff erentiated from each other and the host by congenic markers. Transferred cells were stimulated by cognate or irrelevant peptide in adjuvant and MMF or dextrose was given by daily ip injection. IMPDH2R-transduced Current therapeutic regimens for AML are still associated with high rates of relapse. Immunotherapy with T-cells genetically modifi ed to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) represents a valid and innovative cell therapy approach for haematological malignancies. In this study we developed a new CAR molecule specifi c for the IL-3R\u03b1 (CD123) target antigen, which is overexpressed on AML blasts, CD34+ leukaemic progenitors, and leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) compared to normal haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and whose overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. CIK cells were transduced with an SFG-retroviral vector encoding an anti-CD123.CAR. The effi cacy and safety profi les of transduced cells were characterized in vitro by short and long-term cytotoxicity assays. Their potential reactivity against HSPCs was evaluated by colony-forming unit assay after 4-hours co-incubation. Anti-CD123.CAR+CIK cells strongly killed CD123+ THP-1 cell line (60%\u00b15.4%, Eff ector:Target -E:T-ratio of 5:1, n=3), as well as primary AML blasts (59%\u00b15.4%, E:T ratio of 3:1, n=4) in 4-hours citotoxicity assays. In long-term cytotoxicity assay we observed a leukaemic cell recovery for THP-1 of 3.5%\u00b11.5% (n=5) and for primary AML cells of 2.4%\u00b11.4% (n=3) when co-cultured with anti-CD123.CAR+CIK cells, compared to an average survival of up to 80%, when co-cultured with unmanipulated (NT) CIK cells. Interestingly, secondary colonies experiments after co-culture of cord blood-derived HSPCs with anti-CD123.CAR+CIK cells demonstrated that anti-CD123. CAR better preserved the normal haematopoietic reconstitution in contrast to a previously generated anti-CD33.CAR (total number of colonies of 146.8\u00b16. 6, 66.4\u00b15.1, 117 .6\u00b14.6, after co-culture with NT CIK cells, anti-CD33.CAR+CIK cells, anti-CD123.CAR+CIK cells respectively, n=4). Furthermore, a limited killing of normal CD123+monocytes and CD123-low expressing endothelial cells was measured. Taken together, our results indicate that anti-CD123.CAR strongly enhances antileukaemic CIK functions towards AML, while sparing HSPCs and normal CD123-expressing tissues, paving the way for the development of novel immunotherapy approaches for the treatment of resistant forms of AML. T. Erkers, S. Nava, J. Yosef, O. Ringd\u00e9n, H. Kaipe Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, SE) Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) have been used to treat GvHD, but maternal stromal cells from term fetal membrane (FMCs) have many advantages compared to BM-MSCs, including an increased allosuppression, unlimited supply, great expansion potential and high expression of integrins. We introduced the use of FMCs in patients with steroid refractory aGvHD and the overall response was 75%. In this study, we are elucidating factors of importance in the reduction of alloreactivity by FMCs. We found that FMCs need to have cell-cell contact in order to mediate suppression in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) (p=0.01, n=11). This distinguishes FMCs from BM-MSCs, which can suppress the MLR without contact to the MLR. The frequency of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) was increased (median 2.3-fold), whereas the proportion of total CD25+ T cells was decreased (median 1.4-fold) when the FMCs were added to the MLR cultures (p=0.03, n=10 and p=0.03, n=6, respectively). This was only observed when cell-cell contact was allowed between the MLR and FMCs. Blocking the activity of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (median 2.6-fold increase in proliferation compared to MLR+FMC-control, p=0.01, n=8), IFN-\u03b3 (median 2.0fold increase, p<0.01, n=11), Prostaglandin E2 (median 1.26-fold increase, p=0.01, n=12) and PD-L1 (median 1.23-fold increase, p=0.03, n=7), signifi cantly impaired the anti-proliferative ability of the FMCs in MLRs. Neutralization of molecules such as IL-10, IL-17, TGF-\u03b2 and HLA-G had no eff ect on proliferation in MLRs. Inactivation of IDO also reduced the frequency of Tregs. In contrast to BM-MSC, pre-treatment of the FMCs with high concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 (100 U/ml) decreased their function to suppress alloreactivity (p<0.01, n=16), but stimulation of FMCs with MLR supernatants containing low levels of IFN-\u03b3 had no eff ect on the suppressive capacity in the MLR. To conclude, FMCs diff ers in several aspects from BM-MSCs and needs proximity to allo-reactive lymphocytes to mediate a suppressive eff ect and increase the frequency of Tregs. Thus, FMCs may not only use paracrine factors for systemic immunosuppression, but more specifi cally target T cells locally in aff ected tissues.",

We used an immunoproteomic approach to identify such epitopes, expanded peptide specifi c T cells with the selected candidates and isolated TCR recognizing those epitopes. Cells of patients with chronic and acute myelogenous leukemia were lysed in detergent containing buff er and human leukocyte class I (HLA I) molecules were subsequently immunoprecipitated by the W6/32 antibody. HLA I associated peptides were eluted by acid treatment followed by sequencing via mass spectrometry (MS).

Flat clots were obtained by one-step centrifugation using special BTI equipment (Spain). The volume of collected blood depends on the size of the wound and should be between 5 ml and 40 ml at a time. Platelet growth factors were activated with 10% CaCl2. The time from blood collection to ligation was 20-30 minutes on the average. PRP is placed on the top of atraumatic mesh bandage and covered with secondary dressing. Frequency of dressing changeis once in seven days, which allows patient transfers to outpatient care. For the treatment of the 37 patients (control group: 17 males, 20 females, mean age was 69.5 \u00b1 2.2; VTU -5, CEU -12, DFS -8, STU -5, BU -7, the mean CW area was 79.6 \u00b1 12.3 cm 2 ), traditional topical agents were used starting from phase II of wound healing process.

Materials and methods: Blood collected from a peripheral vein of the patients with chronic wounds of various etiologies was usedas a biological material. PRP was obtained by separating blood with the use of BTI equipment (Spain). Whole blood platelets were stained with vital fl uorochrome dye for further morpho-functional analysison a fl uorescence microscope. Concentration of plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) in blood serum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using reagents \u00abQantikine, Human PDGF-BB Immunoassay\u00bb (R & D Systems) and system \u00abMultiskan ascent\u00bb (Thermo). Proliferative activity of human fi broblast culture (M-22) was assessed in the wells containing diff erent amount of serum PDGF and also using fl uorochrome vital dyes. Results: A direct correlation between concentration and morphofunctional parameters of whole blood platelets and concentration of PDGF in the serum has been observed. Degranulation of platelets is associated with the massive release of PDGF. The study fi nding was that the content of PDGF in one well equal to 150 pg is associated with the maximum gain of proliferative activity of fi broblastswith their viability being preserved; at the higher PDGF concentrations fi broblasts viability decreased and cells death was observed. Conclusions: These data allow recommending the clinical use of PRP for stimulation of the regenerative-reparative processes.",

Methods: This study was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic impact of CIK cell derivates in vitro and in vivo. Mice injected with malignant cells, either received a single dose of unmanipulated CIK cells or serial injections of unmanipulated CIK cells or CIK cell products, and were randomly assigned for analysis of CIK cell treatment in terms of disease free survival (DFS) and engraftment of malignant cells compared to untreated controls. Results: CIK cell products showed reduced proliferative capacity in vitro compared to unmanipulated CIK cells. But, in vitro cytotoxicity of CD56+ CIK cells was signifi cantly improved against soft tissue sarcomas compared to unmanipulated and irradiated CIK cells, whereas no diff erences occurred against acute leukemias. In vivo analysis demonstrated that inoculated leukemias responded to infusions of unmanipulated CIK cells but not to administered CIK cell products (CD33+ primary AML cells [%] , w/o 91.0\u00b12.0; w unmanipulated 26.3\u00b122.9 (once) and 0\u00b10 (repetitive); w CD56+ 43.7\u00b140.7; w irradiated 89.3\u00b10.6). Sequential infusions of unmanipulated CIK cells resulted in an eradication of leukemia cells. In addition, treated mice showed an increased DSF (median survival [days] , w/o 182; w unmanipulated 337 (once) and >340 (repetitive); w CD56+ 220; w irradiated 200). In contrast, in rhabdomyosarcoma-bearing mice, one infusion of unmanipulated CIK cells was suffi cient for eradication of malignant cells (engraftment [RFU] , w/o 77.3\u00b127.0; w unmanipulated 1.2\u00b12.9; w CD56+ 41.9\u00b111.4; w irradiated 30.4\u00b113.8) which resulted in an increased DFS (median survival [days] , w/o 59; w unmanipulated >100; w CD56+ 84; w irradiated 92). Further analysis confi rmed that unmanipulated CIK cells were detectable in signifi cant numbers compared to CD56+ or irradiated CIK cells. Conclusion: The non-restricted anti-tumoral cytotoxicity and the limited risk for GvHD may suggest serial infusions of high numbers of unmanipulated CIK cells as a promising immunotherapeutic approach for high risk patients even in the context of haplo-SCT.",

Results: gd T cell proliferation were not signifi cantly aff ected in IC50 groups of 3 drugs compared with control. In plasma peak groups, both imatinib and dasatinib obviously decreased gd T cells proliferation, only nilotinib had a role in promoting (Figure1A). The expression of activation markers CD25 and HLA-DR were both obviously up-regulated in dasatinib IC50 group(Figure1B). CD107a mobilization were all decreased or not signifi cantly aff ected in experiment groups (Figure1C) . Of note, intracellular IFN-\u03b3 introduction was only obviously increased in dasatinib IC50 group, whether by PMA or K562 cells 1:1 stimulation (Figure1D) . Also Antitumor eff ect of dasatinib IC50 group was observed to be superior to control cells. To fi nd the possible reasons, we further analysed phenotype of gd T cells using CD27 and CD45RA. The results showed only dasatinib IC50 group induced a population shift to CD27-, which represented immediate eff ector functions (Figure1E) . Preferentially cytotoxicity CD27-CD45RA+ subset decreased in all the experiment groups, while preferentially IFN \u03b3-secreting CD27-CD45RA-subset obviously increased in dasatinib IC50 group, which may at least in part explain our previous fi ndings. Conclusion: Dasatinib IC50 concentration not the other BCR/ABLinhibitors enhanced gd T cell antitumor eff ect through a shift to CD27-diff erentiation and IFN \u03b3-secreting responses without aff ected gd T cell proliferation. These data represents a promising way to optimize gd T cell-based immunotherapies.",

We have previously developed a methodological approach to ex-vivo expand anti-tumor CTLs by stimulation of eff ector cells with dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with either apoptotic malignant cells (anti-leukemia CTL) or WT1-peptides as tumor antigens. Recently, it has been described the potential antitumor activity of IFN-alfa and its capacity to induce the diff erentiation of monocytes into DC highly effi cient in mediating cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the induction of either anti-leukemia or WT1-specifi c CTLs, using IFN-alfa during the maturation of DC and/or the priming of eff ector cells, lead to an improvement of their specifi c anti-tumor cytotoxic activity. Four WT1-specifi c and 8 anti-leukemia CTL lines were generated from 5 donor of HSCT. DC were generated culturing CD14+ cells in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 (IL4-DC) or IFN-alfa (IFN-DC). During the priming, PBMC or CD8+ T cells were stimulated with IL4-DC or IFN-DC pulsed with irradiated tumor cells or WT1 peptides in the presence of IL-7 and IL-12, with or without IFN-alfa. IFN-DC displayed a set of membrane molecules involved in antigen presentation even though their morphologic aspect was more monocyte-like than DC-like. In all CTL lines we observed that cytotoxic activity against leukemia blasts was higher when IFN-DC were used as APC instead of IL4-DC (mean lysis: 48%, range 32-61 and 31%, range 17-39, respectively at E:T ratio of 25:1). Specifi c lysis was further enhanced by the addition of IFN-alfa during the priming of CTLs. In spite of an increase percentage of NK cells in IFN-CTLs, we did not documented a loss of their specifi city, in that the reactivity against non-malignant cells was less than 15% at the E/T ratio of 25:1, and the addition of cold K562 in cytotoxicity assay did not cause sizeable reduction of anti-leukemia cytotoxic activity.",

Perruche INSERM UMR 1098 (Besancon, FR) Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) is a curative therapy for hematological malignancies. However, such a therapeutic is limited by graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) occurrence. New strategies are therefore needed and our laboratory showed that the use of apoptotic cell has immunomodulatory properties to favor engraftment and limit GvHD. These eff ects are TGF-B and regulatory T cell dependent. However, since apoptotic cell injection favors tolerance, the infl uence of apoptotic cell injection on leukemia development has never been evaluated. Methods: To examine whether graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) activity of T cells was maintained after AHCT in the presence of apoptotic cells, we developed an experimental mouse model of T celldepleted bone marrow (TCD BM) transplantation. Leukemic A20 luciferase+ cells were also injected the day of TCD BM transplantation (d0). A delayed allogeneic donor T cell infusion was given on day 6 to induce GvHD and GvL. Apoptotic cells were injected either on d0 or d6. Results: Eradication of leukemic cells was observed in all animals receiving delayed T cells injection. Indeed, all mice not receiving T cells died from leukemia before day 27 post-graft, as attested by tumor growth evaluation by luminescence (NightOwl technology). Then, we observed that T cell injection prevents tumor growth as attested by absence of luminescence, however all mice developed GvHD (according to Ferrara's score) and died before day 27 . In sharp contrast, 60% of mice receiving apoptotic cells on d0 survived at day 27. In addition, such mice receiving apoptotic cells that prevent GvHD occurrence, did not present leukemic growth as attested by the absence of luminescence at day 27 post-graft. No diff erence was observed for infl ammatory lymphocyte. Proliferation of CD3 (BRDU) and cytotoxicity of LT CD8+ vs receipt cells was decreased contrary to cytoxicity of CD8 vs A20 which was preserved with apoptotic cell on day 0. Conclusion: Our data clearly demonstrated that GvHD suppression by apoptotic cell injection does not abrogate GvL activity of adoptively transferred donor T cells. Thus, apoptotic cell injection should be considered in clinic to favor engraftment, prevent GvHD, conserving high GvL therapeutic activity.",

To establish this DC method in our GMP-facility, we cultivated monocytes from 2 volunteer healthy donors. On day 3, the maturation cocktail was added. mDCs were harvested and electroporated on day 4 and frozen after a recovery period. The following parameters were investigated: expression of the S78 surface markers CD14, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40 HLA-DR, CCR7, CD274 using FACS analysis, the capability to secrete IL-10 and IL-12p70 during co-culture with CD40L-mouse fi broblasts and the migratory capacity using a CCL19 gradient. In both preparations CD14 showed a complete negative shift in mean fl uorescence intensity after maturation while all other markers showed a complete positive shift. All tested cells produced IL-12p70 in the range from 138 pg/ml to 216 pg/ml. The IL-10 production ranged from 14 pg/ml to 60 pg/ml. All mDCs showed increased migration towards CCL19 compared to controls. Thereafter, two autologous DC vaccines transfected with mRNA hTERT and Survivin were produced for \"compassionate use\". DC phenotype, IL-12 /IL-10 production and migration capacity was similar compared to mDCs from healthy donors. Of the two patients vaccinated, one suff ered from metastatic lung cancer with a brain metastasis. Following diagnosis in June 2011 she was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since December 2011 she has been vaccinated and CT/MRI examination in November 2012 showed a partial response in the lung and no further disease development in the brain. The second patient receiving DC vaccination has a hormone resistant prostate cancer, but he is still too early to evaluate. Altogether, our results show that our new generation of DC vaccines can be a potentially useful immunotherapy for cancer patients.",

Gimona, F. Rivera, L. Aigner, E. Rohde Paracelsus Medical University (Salzburg, AT) Rationale: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (BM-MSPCs) are attractive candidates for cell therapy. Replacing bovine serum with human platelet lysate (HPL) for in vitro culture has been established as a safe procedure to maintain the multi-lineage potential of BM-MSPCs, and HPL has been shown to promote osteogenic diff erentiation in vitro and in vivo. Pre-diff erentiation of BM-MSPCs in vitro can improve bone regeneration when used for critical-sized bone defects. Thus we tested the hypothesis that progenitor cell-derived exosomes further enhance osteogenic diff erentiation. Methods: We employed cell counting, colony formation assays and the xCELLigence impedance assay (ROCHE) for determination of the proliferative capacity of BM-MSPCs in the presence or absence of exosomes derived from either MSPCs or Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFCs). Osteogenic diff erentiation of BM-MSPCs was induced by dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and \u03b2-glycerophosphate in HPL-supplemented media. Flow cytometric analysis was used to monitor stem cell and osteogenic lineage marker expression. Fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy was performed to visualize exosome uptake and osteogenic diff erentiation, respectively. Results: Here we show that exosomes derived from BM-MSPCs, but not from ECFCs further potentiate the HPL-supported osteogenic diff erentiation of BM-MSPCs. In contrast, the proliferative potential of BM-MSPCs was increased by ECFC-derived exosomes only. In the presence of homotypic exosomes BM-MSPCs can be replated after ostogenic diff erentiation without osteo-inductive supplements, and maintain the secretion and deposition of mineralizing matrix. To our knowledge this is the fi rst description of enhanced osteogenic diff erentiation of BM-MSPCs by stem cellderived exosomes. Conclusions: Various procedures have been developed to promote osteogenic diff erentiation of mesenchymal cells in vitro, including growth factor and medium supplements, genetic manipulation or mechanical stimulation. Our results show that in the presence of HPL and exosomes BM-MSPCs can be diff erentiated in vitro towards osteoprogenitors that maintain deposition of calcifying matrix material. Establishing future protocols for the in vitro pre-diff erentiation of BM-MSPCs may contribute to improved stem cell therapy, specifi cally for critical size bone defects.",

Jedema Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, NL) Although profound graft versus leukemia (GvL) responses can be induced after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in some patients, the therapeutic eff ectivity in other patients is limited by inadequate induction of GvL reactivity due to limited numbers and/or inferior immunogenicity of (malignant) antigen-presenting cells of patient origin. Moreover, due to the broad repertoire of specifi cities within unselected donor T cells GvL reactivity often coincides with induction of graft versus host disease (GvHD). Adoptive transfer of selected populations of donor T cells directed against minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) that are specifi cally expressed on only hematopoietic cells of the patient may be an elegant strategy to induce therapeutic GvL reactivity without GvHD. In this study, we used an 'in-vitro vaccin' of hematopoiesis-specifi c MiHA peptides loaded on monocyte-derived dendritic cells of donor origin for in-vitro generation of MiHAspecifi c donor T cells. Na\u00efve CD8+ donor T cells enriched from peripheral blood by magnetic bead separation were stimulated with peptide-loaded (10-7M ) autologous DCs. To enrich for T cells with suffi cient functional avidity, the immune responses were restimulated at day 10 with peptide loaded (10-7M ) autologous monocytes, followed by isolation of reactive T cells 36 hours later based on the expression of the activation marker CD137. MiHAspecifi c T cells were further enriched using peptide/MHC multimers and magnetic bead isolation. Clonal analysis of the isolated MiHA-specifi c T cells demonstrated the generation of MiHA-specifi c T cells showing signifi cant reactivity (cytokine production and/or cytotoxicity) against pepide-loaded target cells, but also against EBV-LCL, and normal and malignant hematopoietic cells of patient origin and no reactivity against cells of donor origin. This illustrates their specifi city for MiHA specifi cally expressed on cells of the patient and their relevant functional avidity allowing reactivity against target cells presenting physiological amounts of endogenously processed antigens. In conclusion, we here present a strategy to generate donor T cells directed against MiHA specifically expressed on (malignant) hematopoietic cells of the patient using an 'in-vitro vaccination' strategy. These T cells may be used to specifi cally induce GvL reactivity without coinciding GvHD in patients with relapsing or recurrent disease early after alloSCT.",

Jedema, C. Hoogstraten, M. van de Meent, T.S. Lam, J.H.F. Falkenburg Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, NL) The induction of adequate anti-tumor responses after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is limited by inadequate induction of primary immune responses from the na\u00efve donor repertoire, most likely due to the unavailability of suffi cient professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) of patient origin and the time required for immune responses to be induced and amplifi ed in-vivo. In this study, we developed a universal strategy for the in-vitro generation of donor T cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) specifi cally expressed on hematopoietic cells of patients with diff erent hematological malignancies. For this purpose, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were generated from CD14 positive monocytes of patient origin and used as APCs for priming of na\u00efve T cells from the HLA matched stem cell donor. Naive donor T cells were enriched by depletion of CD25+ regulatory T cells and memory T cells and stimulated with patient-derived DCs. After 10 days of co-culture the immune responses were restimulated with unmodifi ed monocytes of patient origin and patient hematopoiesis-reactive T cells were enriched 36 hours later using clinical grade CD137-biotin and anti-biotin beads (Miltenyi) . Clonal analysis of multiple T cell products demonstrated that the products contained oligoclonal populations of both CD4 and CD8 T cells that showed reactivity (cytokine production and/or cytotoxicity) against both myeloid cells and EBV-LCL of patient origin and no reactivity against cells of donor origin, illustrating their specifi city for MiHA expressed on patient hematopoietic cells of diff erent lineages. Although the repertoire of antigens expressed by monocyte-derived DCs was skewed towards antigens specifi cally expressed on hematopoietic cells, they will also include antigens with a more broad expression profi le on both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues. Therefore, potentially GvHD-inducing reactive T cells in the generated T cell products will be removed by stimulation of the T cells with patient-derived primary skin fi broblasts followed by depletion based on CD137 expression after stimulation. In conclusion, we here present a universal strategy for the generation of therapeutic hematopoiesis-directed donor T cell products allowing broad clinical application for the treatment of patients with diff erent hematological malignancies showing recurrence or persistence of their disease early after alloSCT.",

Berglund, J. Gertow, I. Magalhaes, J. Mattsson, M. Uhlin Karolinska Institute/Karolinska Univ. Hospital (Stockholm, SE) Background: Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is an increasingly used stem cell source for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One disadvantage to UCBT is that treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is not possible. We wanted to explore if cultured lymphocytes from the UCB graft could off er an alternative to DLI in this setting, with focus on adding IL-7 to the protocol. Methods: T cells were positively selected with CD3+/CD28+ magnetic beads and cultured with IL-2 at escalating concentrations. In addition, IL-7 (20 ng/ml) was added to half of the cultures. After 7 days expansion the T cells were analyzed by fl ow cytometry to determine phenotype, and assess apoptosis and cytokine production. The statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank test. Results: There was a strong trend (p=0.063, n = 5) toward greater proliferation in cultures to which IL-7 had been added. The greatest proliferation was seen in T cells cultured with 100 IU IL-2/ml and IL-7. The CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio was higher with IL-7 and high dose IL-2 (p = 0.031) compared to only high dose IL-2. A lower percentage of central memory T cells (CD45RO+ CCR7+) was seen in conditions with IL-7 and high dose IU IL-2 compared to only IL-2 (p = 0.016). In CD4+ T cells, this was the case for both high dose IL-2 (p = 0.008) and low dose IL-2 (p = 0.019). There was a trend towards less cell death (defined as % of AnnexinV+ 7-AAD+) with IL-7 and low dose IL-2 (p = 0.079). We assessed the intracellular production of IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and CD107a after culture. There was more polyfunctional T cells (positive for three or four factors) in cells cultured with IL-7 (p = 0.049). In CD4+ cells the percentage of cells producing TNF-\u03b1 was significantly higher in cultures with only IL-2, and there were significantly more cells producing IFN-\u03b3 in the culture conditions containing IL-7. Conclusion: There seem to be a proliferation advantage in adding IL-7 to a lower dose of IL-2. Addition of IL-7 might also have an impact on the diff erentiation status of the cells. T cells cultured in IL-7 had more polyfunctional traits, possibly increasing the activity of a putative future DLI.",

T-regulatory cells CD4+CD25+CD127low (T-regs) play the signifi cant role in the maintenance of the immunological tolerance. Purpose: To evaluate the role and signifi cance of T-regs for the recipients of Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). Patients and methods: Method of the native T-regs cultivation, invented by our group, allows to growth cells ex-vivo. Number of T-regs can be increased in more than 100 times in 7-10 days. This survey includes 22 patients after Allo-HSCT. Subpopulation of the lymphocytes was assessed in transplant source (TS) and in peripheral blood (PB) on days +30, +60, +90. Ex-vivo cultivated T-regs subcutaneous (SC) injection was performed for 5 patients with steroid-refractory GvHD in dose 5-7 X 106/kg 1-2 times per months. Mean number of SC injections -3 (2) (3) (4) . Results: T-regs level assessment in the TS showed the absence of the correlation between the number of T-regs and the risk of GvHD. Investigation of the number T-regs and CD4/CD8 ration in the PB at the moment of engraftment and the T-regs level in PB on days +30, +60, +90 showed the absence of correlation of the Tregs level and clinical signifi cance of GvHD. Possibly, the reason of absence of this correlation can be corresponded with prolonged immunosuppression. Signifi cant clinical improvement in GvHD and subpopulation characteristics (increasing of T-regs level (%) and CD4/CD8 ratio) was achieved at the patients who received ex-vivo cultivated T-regs. Some of the patients showed decreasing of absolute lymphocytes count connected with the corresponding immunosuppression, transplant hypofunction and CMV-associated therapy. There were no any side eff ects after the T-regs SC injection. Four patients are alive now (one patient died, cause of death -CMV disease). Observation period: 3-55 months. Patients with oncological diseases (n=2) is free from relapse now. Conclusion: T-regs level monitoring in TS and in the PB during the early post-transplant period with aim of GvHD risk assessment isn't informative and reasonable. Including of the injections of exvivo cultivated cells to the scheme of the steroid-refractory GvHD treatment is the perspective way of improvement of the GvHD therapy. T-regs infusions didn't show any side eff ects.",

DLI of haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells represent a novel strategy to enhance the graft-versustumor eff ect of HSCT in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM). Initial clinical studies by our institution and others indicated that cell dose and resting state of freshly isolated NK cells may limit the anti-tumor eff ect of NK-DLI in vivo. Here we describe the in vitro expansion of NK cells under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions for preemptive mega dose NK cell infusions and follow-up of cytokine-activated NK cells in vivo. NK cells were purifi ed from unstimulated leukaphereses (mean: 12.5L, n=4) by T cell depletion and subsequent NK cell selection using CliniMACS. Starting from 180 x 10e8 total nucleated cells, 7.2 x 10e8 NK cells were obtained with a purity of 95.8% and a residual T cell contamination of 1.8 x 10e5 cells corresponding to a T cell depletion effi cacy of 5.22 log. Purifi ed NK cells were expanded for 19 days in air-permeable bags in up to 13.4L medium containing human serum, IL-2, IL-15, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and irradiated autologous feeder cells. After 19 days NK cell numbers increased 50. 3-fold (range 22 to 75-fold) to 197 x 10e8 cells with a viability of 72% and with a minimal T cell contamination of 0.023%. The NK cell products were divided and cryopreserved as 3-8 (mean: 5.25 ) escalating doses ranging from 1.3 x 10e6 to 1.0 x 10e8 cells/kg body weight. Of GMP-expanded NK cells we determined the phenotype, size of alloreactive cell subsets and cytolytic activity of against K562 cells. Fourteen NK-DLIs were given to two patients and well tolerated without any acute adverse eff ects. The faith of infused NK cells was monitored by FACS analysis of discriminative donor-specifi c HLA molecules and by quantitative real-time PCR of donor-specifi c DNA loci in one MM patient treated with autologous HSCT and haploidentical NK cells. After all NK-DLIs with maximal cell dose, we detected NK cells of donor origin at one and 20 hours post infusion (1.87% and 0.12% of purifi ed NK cells, respectively) indicating prolonged survival of cytokine-activated NK cells in the recipient's blood circulation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale expansion under GMP conditions and multiple mega dose infusions of human NK cells as immunotherapy after HSCT for malignant disease.",

Extensive data has accrued in acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) where effi cacy in the acute setting is clearly demonstrated in a sub-set of patients, but to date a large scale clinical trial has yet to be reported. MSC are also reported to have effi cacy in applications such as infl ammatory bowel disease and solid organ transplant rejection. We have been manufacturing MSC since 2006 under ever more stringent good manufacturing practice (GMP) and regulatory requirements. MSC are Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Products and we hold both a relevant Investigational Medicinal Products license and a Specials license to permit manufacture of MSC for clinical trials or as an unlicensed drug under prescription for individual need. We have given MSC mainly in acute GvHD and an abstract detailing the clinical outcomes has been submitted, but we have also provided cells for Crohn's Disease, hyperimmunity, acquired immune haemolytic anaemia and organ transplant rejection. Production of MSC utilises multi-level tissue culture stacks (636cm2/level). Foetal bovine serum (FBS) has been replaced by human platelet lysate (PL). In adult donors, PL (n=33) did not signifi cantly increase yield (4.8 \u00b1 3 .9 x 10 6 /level vs 8.9 \u00b1 9.7 x 10 6 /level, p=0.35) compared with FBS (n=10) but decreased time to harvest (44.1 \u00b1 10days vs 23.9 \u00b1 10.9 days (p=0.001)). Yield varies widely between individuals and declines with donor age, most marked in donors <10y.o or >50y.o. We cryopreserve pooled seed stocks from primary cultures and establish multiple identical fi rst passage (P1) cultures for clinical use. P1 culture yield is donor dependent (mean yield for two 5 years old donors is 15.2 vs 37.0 x 10 6 /level, n=23 vs 24, p=0.001) but the range of yields per pooled stock (representative donor 13.8-53.8 x 10 6 /level, mean 37.0) indicates that multiple factors are involved. It is likely that MSC manufacture will ultimately reach industrial scale. Until such time, we expect production effi ciency in small centres to continue to evolve with small scale automated systems, hypoxia and commercially-driven introduction of serum-free medias and recombinant growth factors all key factors. S82 6 of the 10 patients treated with fresh MSC also received freezethawed MSC at another time. Because of this, response has been evaluated per individual infusion, and we have refrained from comparing survival. 108 tissue samples from 15 of the patients have been analysed for engraftment using PCR for MSC donor DNA. A total of 72 MSC infusions, 10 from fresh MSC and 62 freezethawed, were evaluated regarding clinical response. 22 infusions, of which 6 were of fresh MSC, were evaluated regarding engraftment. Results: The clinical response to fresh MSC was 70% responders, similar to freeze-thawed MSC (66%). MSC used fresh were to a higher degree HLA-matched (70% vs 15% partial or total HLAmatch) and of a lower average passage (median passage 2 vs 3), which could potentially infl uence the outcome in favour of the fresh MSC. For engraftment, no diff erence could be seen. Of fresh MSC, 50% (3/6) could be found in one or more sampled tissue, in comparison to 54% (7/13) of frozen MSC. Distribution was about the same with exception of the lungs, where only frozen MSC could be found. Discussion: In evaluating clinical response and engraftment of MSC, no diff erence could be found between fresh or frozen MSC. This analysis is limited by the small number of infusions of fresh MSC, a power calculation shows that we would only detect a difference in eff ect size of about 50% and we might miss a clinically signifi cant diff erence. As other factors possibly associated with better clinical response were more common in the fresh infusions we can at least conclude that no dramatic diff erence in favour of fresh MSC was evident from our data.",

Bensoussan CHU de Nancy (Nancy, FR) Objectives: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection represents one of the major causes of morbidity following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and can turn into post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) associated with a high mortality rate although the use of targeted therapy, Rituximab. Adoptive cellular Immunotherapy using EBV-Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCL) as stimulating antigen has proven effi ciency as it restored specifi c immunity. However, EBV presents a lot of immunodominant antigens and the challenge to develop a fast, clinical grade immunotherapy relies on the defi nition of a GMP universal stimulating antigen. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 6 donors presenting a cellular immune response against EBV were stimulated with an optimal EBV antigen association including an EBNA-3 peptide pool for 9 hours and the immunomagnetic selection based on IFN-\u03b3 secretion was performed. After selection, cells were expanded within 14 days and functional assays were carried out with the expanded cells. Results: After immunoselection, a mean of 0.53 \u00b1 0.25\u00d710 6 cells were recovered consisting in a mean of 24.77 \u00b1 18.01% CD4+ secreting IFN-\u03b3 and 51.42 \u00b1 26.92% of CD8+ secreting IFN-\u03b3. The ability of expanded EBV-specifi c T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and to proliferate after restimulation with EBV antigen was confi rmed. A specifi c lysis was observed against autologous target cells pulsed with EBV peptide pools (57.6 \u00b1 11 .5%) and interestingly against autologous EBV-LCL (18.3 \u00b1 7.3%). A decrease of 94.7 % in allogeneic reaction against third-party donor mononuclear cells with EBV-specifi c T cells compared with the PBMC before selection was observed. Conclusions: Our results brought out that an association of peptide pools including EBNA-3 is mandatory to generate EBVspecifi c T cells harboring a good specifi c cytotoxicity and a lack of alloreactivity.",

Bensoussan CHU de Nancy (Nancy, FR) Objectives: Human Adenovirus (ADV) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infections or associated diseases are serious complications following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations which are responsible for signifi cant morbidity and mortality. Although available anti-viral drugs as cidofovir (ADV) and Rituximab (EBV), their effi ciency is impaired in absence of specifi c immune reconstitution and toxicity remains a concern. Furthermore, adoptive cellular immunotherapy with ADV or EBV cytotoxic T cells (CTL) has proven safety of use and effi ciency as it restored specifi c immunity. The concern is now to develop such an immunotherapy against the 2 viruses simultaneously. We focused on the generation of anti-ADV/ EBV bi-specifi c T cells and the comparison with the mono-specifi c T cells in respect of enrichment, effi ciency and toxicity. Such a comparative study was only reported once (Khanna et al, 2011) . Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 3 donors presenting a cellular immune response against ADV and EBV were stimulated with ADV or EBV antigens or both. Immunomagnetic selection based on IFN-\u03b3 secretion was performed and functional assays were carried out with the expanded cells. Results: After immunoselection, a mean of 62.3\u00b118.08%, 39.9 \u00b1 25.54% and 60.6 \u00b1 20.25% CD4+ secreting IFN-\u03b3 and 33. 1 \u00b1 20.46%; 26.3 \u00b1 32.29% and 60.7 \u00b1 20 .55% of CD8+ secreting IFN-\u03b3 were recovered for ADV-CTL, EBV-CTL and ADV/EBV-CTL, respectively. Virus-specifi c T cells were expanded in vitro and their ability to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and to proliferate after restimulation with virus antigens was confi rmed. A specifi c lysis for EBV-CTL and ADV/ EBV-CTL was observed against autologous target cells pulsed with EBV peptide pools (59. 3 \u00b1 22.5% and 43.7 \u00b1 32.6, respectively) and a lower lysis for ADV-CTL and ADV/EBV-CTL against autologous target cells loaded with PepT-ADV (31.0 \u00b1 4.0% and 14.0 \u00b1 6.1, respectively). A reduced alloreactivity of bispecifi c and monospecifi c T cells against third-party donor mononuclear cells, compared to the PBMC before selection was observed. Conclusion: Despite a good enrichment in CD4 IFN-\u03b3 and CD8 IFN-\u03b3 T cells, bi-specifi c CTL showed a loss of cytotoxicity against ADV presenting targets compared with ADV mono-specifi c CTL. Although we cannot exclude antigenic competition during multispecifi c CTL stimulation, our data seem to incriminate the amplification step required to perform functional assays.",

Moreover the infl uence of 'IFN'-DC' on the antileukemic functionality of T-cells was studied and data correlated with the clinical response to immunotherapy (SCT/DLI). Results: 1.Generation of DC:a) From 'MNC-DC' DC/DCleu could be successfully generated (>10%DC and >5% DCleu in the total cell fraction) with MCM-mimic (MCM, 31% of cases), Picibanil (Pici, 34%), Calcium-ionophore (Ca, 21%) and IFN\u03b1 (IFN, 26%). b) From 'WB-DC' DC/DCleu could be successfully generated with 'MCM' (33% of cases), 'Pici' (20%), 'Ca' (25%) and 'IFN' (38%). c) Using 'WBmini-cock-DC' DC/DCleu could be successfully generated with cocktails containing diff erent combinations of response-modifi ers (20-50% of cases), but never, if IFN\u03b1 was added to the cultures. None of the used DC-methods or cocktails induced blast proliferation. 2. Antileukemic functionality: T-cells stimulated with 'MNC-DC' using 'IFN' compared to 'Pici' or 'MCM' in 4 cases showed comparable lytic activity in the two settings (3 of 4 cases lytic activity achieved). Detailed data of DC-proportions in the context of functionality, response to immunotherapy and in the context of cytokine release will be presented. Conclusion: DC/DCleu can be generated regularily from blastcontaining MNC ('MNC-DC)' , from whole blood ('WB-DC') using standard DC-methods -including 'IFN'-methods. However, DCgeneration is only possible, if IFN\u03b1, GM-CSF and TNF\u03b1, are added to cultures and not with minimalized combinations of IFN\u03b1. In a clinical context this could mean, that IFN is eff ective only in a special context with other response modifi ers -resulting in antileukemic T-cells or not.",

Hodgkin (1) , K.S. Peggs (2) , A. Friedetzky (1) , R. Knaus (1) (1)Cell Medica Ltd. (London, GB) ; (2) UCL Cancer Institute (London, GB) Objective: Investigator-led Phase I/II studies have shown that adoptive transfer of donor virus-specifi c cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL) can reconstitute immunity on a long-lasting basis in patients at risk for viral reactivation following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT). In order to support routine clinical use for virus-specifi c CTL, it is critical to establish a reliable and convenient approach for supply of the cell product to transplant centers across Europe. Methods: Requests for Cytomegalovirus-specifi c (CMV) CTL are accepted for specifi c patients from transplant physicians under a service level agreement with Cell Medica, employing standard forms for donor and patient consent. Eligibility is confi rmed, including HLA-type and presence of CMV-specifi c cells, in donor samples. A proprietary technology is utilized for direct selection of CTL based on MHC-multimer technology (STAGE Cell Therapeutics GmbH). After fi nal testing the CMV-specifi c CTL are released as Cytovir TM CMV and shipped to the hospital in a temperature controlled manner for direct infusion. Results: The centralized production reliably results in a product that after microbiological clearance can be delivered in 10-14 days from receipt of starting material. Based on the provision of over 50 cell products to support clinical trials to 13 centers, no logistics failures have occurred. The table shows data from the last 24 products manufactured after process optimization. Conclusion: Cell Medica have developed a model for centralized production and delivery of virus-specifi c CTL for transplant IL-12p70, TNF-\u03b1 in 'MNC-DC'-or 'WB-DC'-stimulated T-cell supernatants. Conclusion: In sum high concentrations of IL-8, MCP1, INF-\u03b3 and low concentrations of IL-10, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1 in serum,'DC'-or MLCsupernatants correlate with antileukemic T-cell functionality or clinical response to immunotherapy. These data could contribute to develop strategies to shift the cytokine profi le/immuneresponse -e.g by application of responsemodifi ers to patients.",

We evaluated the Amicus Separator (Fenwal) as an alternate platform to collect lymphocytes for off line ECP. The objective was to assess procedure performance and safety. Methods: A total of 16 Amicus procedures (SW 4.3) were evaluated in patients with GVHD (5), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (8), oral lichen planus (3) . Two whole blood volumes were targeted to process. The illumination procedure post collection was performed after addition of 8-MOP using a Macogenic 2 device (Macopharma). A lymphocyte proliferation inhibition test was performed post treatment. The performance was evaluated based on 1) lymphocyte collection yield and purity; 2) patient PLT depletion; 3) procedure time (reinfusion included); 4) adverse events during the collection procedure. Results: 16 patients with a weight of 59 \u00b1 9 kg, platelet (PLT) pre count of 245 \u00b1 58 x 10E3/\u03bcl (N=14) and white blood cells (WBC) pre count of 7.6 \u00b1 7.3 per \u03bcL (N=14) were collected. PLT post count was 227 \u00b1 51 x 10E3/\u03bcl (N=13) corresponding to a PLT depletion of 10.8 \u00b1 5.9% (N=13). WBC post count was 6.9 \u00b1 6.0 per \u03bcl (N=13). Whole blood volume processed was 8516 \u00b1 1500 ml in 198 \u00b1 33 minutes including reinfusion time (N=16). Collected product volume was 312 \u00b1 13 ml (N=15).

Conclusions: If we use the number of transfusions as a direct parameter of the use of ESA over red cell engraftment in patients undergoing ASCT, we can confi rm that its use does not provide any advantage as it does not decrease the number of transfusions. We also analyzed platelet transfusion as possible indirect parameter of the ESA eff ect over another series and bone marrow microenviroment. According to our analysis, its administration is not benefi cial as there are no diff erences between both groups. Therefore, we believe that the use of ESA in patients undergoing ASCT, may have a role in selected patients with poor quality of life or poor tolerance to anemic syndrome, but this should not be used universally.",

Bialleck, K. Thorausch, B. Luxembourg, E. Seifried, H. Bonig German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg-Hessen (Frankfurt, DE) Introduction: The apheresis device Spectra Optia (SO) which features continuous electronic interface monitoring was introduced to replace COBE Spectra (CS). Successively, protocols were released for plasma/erythrocyte exchange followed by a mononuclear cell (MNC) protocol for autologous/allogeneic \"stem cell\" apheresis and unstimulated MNC collections (e.g. donor lymphocyte infusions, extracorporeal photopheresis). Safety/effi cacy of the device for these indications were reported. Most recently, by introducing the SO-IDL platform, the portfolio was extended to leukocyte depletions and granulocyte collections. Performance data for these protocols are reported. Methods: SO-IDL diff ers from SO-MNC by use of a diff erent (exchangeable) fi ller, to accommodate the more voluminous IDL tubing set, and by depositing the product directly in the collection bag. For leukodepletions, we retrospectively analyzed data from 23 procedures in de-novo AML patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis performed between 6/2011 and 7/2012, 8 with SO-IDL and 15 with CS-MNC. For granulocyte collections, we compared outcomes from 70 aphereses, performed between 10/2011 and 9/2012, 35 each with CS-PMN and SO-IDL. Results: Epidemiology and blood counts of leukodepletion patients were typical for AML patients with hyperleukocytosis. Aphereses were tolerated without complications with both systems. Blasts were depleted with a mean collection effi ciency (CE2) of ca. 50% with both systems. An inverse correlation between blast count and CE2 was noted. Platelet attrition was modest (30%), erythrocyte loss minimal. Leukodepletion outcomes did not diff er in any relevant manner between the two technologies. Volunteer granulocyte donors received a single dose of G-CSF to achieve a neutrophilia of 26/nL (mean) and were randomly assigned to apheresis with SO-IDL or CS-PMN. High molecular weight hydroxyl ethyl starch was used as sedimentation enhancer. The procedure was well tolerated. Apheresis processing of 6.5-7 L of blood yielded a dose of 1x10E10 granulocytes (one therapeutic dose as per German transfusion guidelines) in 69/70 donors, granulocyte dose/product by the two apheresis systems was indistinguishable (3.4 vs. 3 .6x10E10, mean for SO-IDL and CS-PMN, respectively); some minor, clinically likely irrelevant diff erences in apheresis outcomes were observed. Conclusion: Our data indicate the suitability of the IDL-based apheresis protocols \"leukodepletion\" and \"PMN\" for clinical usage.",

Dazzi Imperial College London (London, GB) Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have shown promise as a therapeutic strategy in patients with severe refractory graft-versushost disease (GvHD) although their exact mechanism remains elusive. The role of complement activation in GvHD has previously been described, and recent in vitro data suggests that MSC may be capable of inhibiting complement activation by constitutively secreting complement inhibitors (such as factor H). Our aim was to investigate the eff ects of infused MSC on complement activation in patients receiving allogeneic MSC for steroidresistant GvHD. We investigated complement levels in 14 consecutive patients receiving allogeneic MSC for steroid-resistant acute (n=7) or chronic (n=7) GvHD. Serum C3, C4, factor H and factor I levels were measured immediately before and 30 minutes, 7 days and 28 days after the infusion. MSC were derived from third-party healthy donors and were expanded in human platelet lysate. Grading of GvHD was measured according to established Glucksberg and NCI criteria, and response was defi ned as a reduction by one grade or more of GvHD in at least 1 involved organ. All patients gave informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee. Serum C3 and C4 levels 30 minutes after infusion of MSC remained unchanged (median C3 before infusion = 1.01 g/l, post infusion = 0.90 g/l, p=0.60; median C4 before infusion = 0.23 g/l, post-infusion = 0.24 g/l, p=0.89), suggesting no signifi cant complement activation. At day 7 following infusion both C3 and C4 levels had increased, to 1.24 g/l (p=0.07) and 0.28 g/l (p=0.03) respectively. This protection from complement activation was sustained until at least day 28, when C3 levels reached 1.26 g/l (p=0.007) and C4 0.27 g/l (p=0.03). In patients responding to MSCs (n=7) a significant rise in factor I levels was observed 30 minutes after infusion of MSCs (median rise of 16 units (p=0.04)) compared to a fall in non-responders (median fall of 47 units (p=0.09). This pattern persisted at day 7, although was less marked and did not achieve signifi cance. A similar pattern of rising levels in responders and falling in non-responders was observed in factor H, but this did not attain statistical signifi cance. Our data supports the notion that allogeneic MSC suppress complement activation by secreting complement inhibiting factors. Patients exhibiting such a profi le are more likely to respond to MSC. S87 been shown, little is known about the safety of DLI from such donors. Increasingly sensitive methods of minimal residual disease detection leading to earlier identifi cation of relapse and registry data suggesting that 16-40% of HSCT recipients subsequently require DLI makes the safety of DLI from HLA-mismatched donors is an increasingly pertinent question. To address this issue we retrospectively performed high resolution HLA typing (HLA-A, B, C, DR and DQ) on stored genomic DNA samples of 58 consecutive patients receiving DLI for the management of relapse or mixed chimerism at our institution between December 1995 and August 2010. All patients received unrelated donor transplants following uniform alemtuzumab-based myeloablative, conditioning for leukaemia (CML n=56, AML n=1, ALL n=2). DLI was administered using an established escalating-dose regimen. The primary endpoint was acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) within 100 days of DLI. Secondary endpoints were incidence of chronic GvHD, probability of remission and overall survival (OS). Thirty patients were fully matched at all 10 loci (MUD), while mismatches (MMUD) were identifi ed in 28 patients (HLA-A n=3, HLA-B n=4, HLA-C n=15, HLA-DR n= 8, HLA-DQ n=12). Mismatches were present at 1, 2 or 3 loci in 18, 6 and 4 patients respectively. The groups were comparable with regard to baseline and transplant demographics. The rates of grade II-IV aGvHD following DLI were low and comparable in both groups (17.2% in MUD and 23.1% in MMUD, p=0.59) . Similarly we found no signifi cant diff erences in the incidence of cGvHD (34% in MUD vs 42% in MMUD, p=0.51), although there was a trend towards more severe cGvHD in the MMUD recipients (27% MMUD vs 10% MUD, p=0.09). The probability of remission at 3 years was similar in both groups (62.1% vs 63.9% in MUD and MMUD respectively, p=0.89), as was the 5 year OS (89.8% vs 77.7% in MUD and MMUD respectively (p=0.22) ). The only identifi ed predictor of inferior survival was time from HSCT to DLI of less than 9 months (3yr OS, 33.3% vs 93.3%, p<0.01). Our data suggests that escalating-dose DLI can safely be given to mismatched transplant recipients following alemtuzumab-based myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation without a signifi cant impact on GvHD, disease response or OS.",

Blasczyk, H. Heuft Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Herpesviruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) are common and associated with increased morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) . CMV serostatus of donor and recipient infl uence the risk of recurrent CMV reactivation post HSCT. For CMV screening of stem cell donors and recipients the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle CMV-IgG immunoassay (Abbott Diagnostic Division, London, UK) is used. To get more insight into the CMV-specifi c memory T-cell repertoire, we analyzed CMV-specifi c T-cell responses using an IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay in 204 healthy donors. According to the initial CMV screening, 143 (71%) of the enrolled donors were considered CMV-seropositive and 61 (29%) CMV-seronegative. None of the samples of CMV-seronegative donors yielded positive ELISpot results after short overnight stimulation; but also 19/143 seropositive samples were found not reacting to either pp65 or IE-1 peptides. To validate the ELISpot and exclude false-positive CMV screening results, we performed confi rmatory serology testing by Western Blot (WB; recomBlot CMV IgG/IgM). WB testing was prospectively performed at the time of the baseline T-cell assay and at 4 weeks and 3 months of follow-up. The 19/143 ELISpot nonresponders were also non-reactive in the WB indicating a 13% rate of false-positive screening results. Additional confi rmatory WB testing was done retrospectively using 191 look back samples with a positive CMV screening result from whole blood or apheresis donations between 2006 and 2010. All donors without CMV WB-confi rmation were reevaluated with follow-up samples from further donations. For 128/191 (67%) donors the initial CMV screening result was confi rmed, 7 were indeterminate, 11 remained unclear because of missing follow-up donations, and 45 (23.6%) were defi nitely CMV seronegative. Conventional CMV screening is associated with a signifi cant rate (13-23% depending on the confi rmation strategy) of false positive results. If the CMV status of a specifi c HSC donor is decisive for adequate donor selection, confi rmatory serological testing or evaluation of T-cell reactivity to virus-specifi c antigens is required.",

            "text": "The HistoCheck score for assessment of HLA-disparities does not predict clinical outcome of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation D. Fuerst (1) , C. Zollikofer (1) , C.H. Mueller (2) , H. Schrezenmeier (1) , J. Mytilineos (1) (1)University of Ulm (Ulm, DE) ; (2) ZKRD -Zentrales Knochenmarkspender-Register f\u00fcr Deutschland (Ulm, DE) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been established as a potentially curative therapy for hematologic malignancies or non-malignant immunologic disorders. Matching for HLA class I and II alleles is an important criterion for outcome of HSCT, in particular regarding non-related allogeneic transplantation. For patients with rare HLA-haplotypes mismatched donors often need to be taken into consideration. The HistoCheck (HS) algorithm provides a scoring value for comparison of HLA-disparities. This score is based on structural and functional diff erences between two mismatched HLA alleles. We validated the prognostic signifi cance of this algorithm by assigning HS-scores to 800 patients with single HLA-mismatched donors (based on high resolution HLA-A,-B,-C,-DRB1,-DQB1 typing). Assigned score values showed a bipolar clustering and therefore the patients were grouped into those with low and high scores, separated by the median value for the entire cohort (11.98, range 1.03-35.77). Overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse incidence (RI), and treatment related mortality (TRM) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, competing risks regression and extended Cox regression models. For any mismatch (i) and in subanalyses for HLA-Class I (ii) or HLA-Class II (iii) mismatches only, univariate analysis showed no eff ect of HS on OS ((i) p=0.396, (ii) p=0.964, (iii) p=0.186), DFS ((i) p=0.502, (ii) p=0.926, (iii) p=0.218), TRM ((i) 30.9% vs. 27.5%, p=0.402, (ii) 32.1% vs. 28.6%, p=0.401, (iii) 27.6% vs. 14.7%, p=0.303), and RI ((i) 31.7% vs. 32.4%, p=0.553, (ii) 29.2% vs. 32.0%, p=0.420. (iii) 39.7% vs. 37.0%, p=0.660). Multivariate Analysis also did not reveal any signifi cant eff ect of HS assignment on OS ((i) CI 0.90-1.32, p=0.390, (ii) CI 0.82-1.25, p=0.931, (iii) 0.81-2.48, P=0.217), DFS ((i) CI 0. p=0.477, p=0.923, p=0.129) , TRM ((i) CI 0.66-1.14, p=0.310, (ii) CI 0. p=0.290, p=0.489) , and RI ((i) 0.91-1.30, p=0.340, (ii) CI 0.97-1.66, p=0.420, (iii) CI 0.67- 1.87, p=0.660) . No diff erences in engraftment rates were seen for transplantations with low or high HS values (p=0.115). Furthermore, consideration of the HS value as a continuous variable in multivariate analysis also did not have any impact on survival outcomes. We conclude that HS did not provide any clinically relevant prognostic value and therefore its use in the HSCT donor selection process is questionable. S89 was AML for 88 (35%) patients, ALL for 29 (11.5%) , MDS/MPS for 55 (22%), multiple myeloma for 32 (12.5%), and 47 patients (19%) had CML, CLL, HL and NHL. For conditioning, 120 (48%) received MAC and 131 (52%) received RIC. At transplantation, 140 patients (58%) were in CR, 111 (42%) were in less than CR; 121 (48%) patients received PBSC and 130 (52%) BM. Fourteen (5.5%) patients received HSCT from 10/10 unrelated donor had a mismatched DRB4 donor, 23 (9.5%) patients had a mismatched DRB3 donor and 214 (85%) had a fully matched unrelated donor (10/10) without DRB3 or DRB4 mismatched donor. We compared the outcome of the 37 patients with a DRB3 or DRB4 mismatch to the rest of the population. After a median follow-up of 60 months (range, , 241 patients (96%) engrafted. For the whole cohort, the cumulative incidence of aGvHD\u22652 at 3 months was 15% (95%CI, 13-18) and the cumulative incidence of cGvHD at one year was 13% (95%CI, 10.5-16) . The median survival for patient without DRB3,4 mismatch was 18 months (95%CI, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) , for DRB3 mismatched patients 32 months (95%CI, 13-NR), and for DRB4 mismatched patients 7 months (95%CI, . The probability of survival at 24 months, without mismatch DRB3, 4 was 40% (95%CI, 31-51) , with DRB3 mismatch 51% (95%CI, 12-33) and with DRB4 mismatch 24% (95%CI, . The PFS and the TRM incidence at 24 months without DRB3,4 mismatch was 34% (95%CI, (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) and 22% (95%CI, respectively, with DRB3 mismatch 49 (95%CI, 30-78) and 13% (95%CI, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] respectively and with DRB4 mismatch 25 (95%CI, and 50% (95%CI , . (Figure ) . In univariate analysis, we found no impact of the DRB3 mismatch while the DRB4 mismatch have a negative impact on TRM (p=0.04) and on acute GvHD (p=0.085). The multivariate analysis showed no impact of the DRB3 mismatching on survival, GvHD, PFS and TRM but a signifi cant impact of DRB4 mismatching on survival (HR= 2.1 [95%CI, ], p=0.045), aGvHD (HR=2.66 (95%CI, 0.99-7.09) p=0.05) and on TRM (HR= 2.8; [95%CI, ] p= 0.024). In view of the important impact of DRB4 locus mismatch on clinical outcome, it seems to be important to be considered in the unrelated donor selection.",

Servais, R. Porcher, A. Xhaard, M. Robin, E. Masson, J. Larghero, P. Ribaud, S. Abbes, N. Dhedin, G. Socie, R. Peff ault de Latour Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, FR) Optimal strategy for donor selection is still controversial. We evaluated the impact of donor type vs. matched related (MRD)) and other donor traits on long term outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Methods: We analyzed outcome of 442 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who were treated with PBSCT either from MUD (n= 164) or MRD (n=278) from 01/2000 to 12/2010 at our center. Two-third of patients underwent PBSCT following reduced intensity conditioning. Antithymocyte globulin was used for 19% of patients. MUD and MRD PBSCT were balanced for patient age, disease risk and conditioning. Median donor age was 40 years. We assessed the impact of donor type, age, gender, CMV and ABO status on outcomes. As the upper age limit for voluntary stem cells donation was 60 years, we completed our analysis by performing 3 groups according to donor type and age (MUD, MRD<60y and MRD\u226560y). Thirty-six patients were transplanted with MRD\u226560y. Results: Median follow up was 36 months and 25% of patients had a follow up of at least 60 months. The cumulative incidence at 5 years (5y-CIf ) of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was 58%. In multivariate analysis, sex mismatch (female donor for male recipient) increased risk of cGVHD (hazard ratio (HR): 1.41, P=.02). The 5y-CIf of relapse was 34% and was higher with MRD than MUD (39% vs. 24%, P=.038). In multivariate analysis, only MRD\u226560y resulted in signifi cant higher risk of relapse than MUD (HR: 2.46, P=.006) while MRD<60y had similar risk. The 5 year non relapse mortality (NRM) was 26%. MUD vs. MRD was associated with higher NRM (HR: 1.84, P=.005). The 5 year overall survival (OS) was 46% and was similar with MUD and MRD. MRD\u226560y appeared to have notable low 5y-OS (6%, \u00b16%). In multivariate analysis, transplantation from MRD\u226560y was associated with higher risk of late (\u226518 months) mortality (HR: 4.36, P=.007) than MUD (Fig. 1) . Conclusion: Donor/recipient gender parity, donor type and age appeared as signifi cant predictive factors of long term outcomes after HLA-matched PBSCT. Female donor for male recipient was associated with higher risk of cGVHD. MUD provided higher NRM but better disease control and similar OS than MRD. We observed notable poor outcome for patients transplanted with MRD\u226560y. One may thus question PBSCT with old MRD when a younger MUD is available.",

There were 53 adults (37 dUCBT and 16 sUCBT) with a median age of 36 years (18-64) and 48 children (3 dUCBT and 45 sUCBT) with a median age of 2 years (0-14) and a median follow-up of surviving patients of 24 months . The median number of pre-freezing and post-thawing cells was for 1) TNC: 3.3x10 7 /kg (1.9-5.1) and 2.6x10 7 (1.5-4.6) in adults; 1.6x10 7 (0.5-4) and 1.18x10 7 (0.5-3) in children; 2) CD34: 1.89x10 5 (0.57-4.2 ) and 1.55x10 5 (0.5-4.1) in adults; 4x10 5 (0. 6-19.3 ) and 2.8x10 5 (0.26-19) in children with a respective cells viability of 54% and 58%. We built a scoring scale that took into account the matching variables (sex, ABO and HLA) between UCB units and recipient and between UCB units each other in case of dUCBT. The median score was 3.8 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) in adults and 3 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) in children; the detailed score calculation method will be communicated later. The multivariate analysis done separately in adults and children found a positive impact of infused CD34 \u22651.55x10 5 on neutrophiles recovery in adults [HR=2. 1 (1.16-3.8) , p=0.015] and infused CD34 \u22652.8x10 5 on neutrophiles and platelets recovery [HR=2. 5 (1.2-5) , p=0.007 and HR= 4.4 (1.6-11.6 ), p=0.002 respectively] in children; no signifi cant factor was observed on the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD\u2265 grade II. In addition, we showed a signifi cant negative impact of matching score > 3.8 on adults overall survival (OS) with a 3 years probability of 19% vs. 57% (38-84) for those with score \u22643.8 [HR=3.9 (1.5-9.8), p=0.003]. Similarly, score >3.8 had a signifi cant negative impact also on progression-free survival (PFS) only in adults with a 3 years probability of 13% vs. 21% for patients with a score p=0.04] . No signifi cant factor was found to infl uence transplant related mortality. In conclusion, cell dose remains a signifi cant impacting factor on short term transplantation outcome while the matching score appears to have a strong impact on adult long term outcomes mainly OS and PFS. These very promising results lead us to evaluate this score in larger number of patients for its validation and in order to include it in the UCB unit choice either in simple or double UCBT.",

Method: In order to register a maximum number of young donors, University student groups decided to pool their eff orts with those provided by hospital and university institutions, donor and patient associations, and blood transfusion centers. A student developed a questionnaire designed to evaluate young people's perceptions of bone marrow donation and to educate them on the subject. To answer this questionnaire, 4000 fi rst-year students were recruited within diff erent University faculties. Analysis was carried out by an optical reading system. Following distribution of the questionnaire, fi ve students in communication techniques were tasked will developing strategies specifi cally targeting young people (cf.Facebook) Young donors were informed on the subject by the pharmacy and medical students associations now functioning in all the faculties of Poitiers University. The topic was: How and why could young people become bone marrow or blood stem cell donors? Results: Analysis of the 3561 returned and completed questionnaires showed that the participating students had only limited knowledge of bone marrow donation. All of them required more information on the conditions of bone marrow donation (47%) and its possible consequences for them (78%). Many of them confused bone marrow and spinal cord (46%), some knew nothing about donation procedures (25%), and a sizable number were not interested (26%). Only a limited proportion (21%) showed interest in the procedures and expressed willingness to become bone marrow donors. A written document will be elaborated as a response to the students' concerns. Medical and pharmacy students have been organizing presentation sessions in the diff erent faculties. Since these initiatives have been favorably welcomed, the students are planning to continue the sessions Additionally, the NCC, CD34 counts and CD34/NC ratio were compared between donors \u226416 years and >16 years of age. Median age was 14,3 y (1,5y-54 y). M/F:42/50. Median NCC and CD34 count were 0,22 x 10 8 /ml (0,09 x 10 8 /ml-0,72 x 10 8 /ml) and 0,34 x 10 6 /ml (0,03 x 106/ml-1,47 x 10 6 /ml) respectively. CD34/NC was median 1,43 (0,3-4,8) . A negative correlation was found between the donor age and NC count (r=-0,229, p<0,05) , CD34 count (r=-0,563, p<0,01) and 664, p<0, 01) . This negative correlation persisted in female donors with increasing age 356, p<0, 05) , CD34 count (r=-0,583, p<0,01), CD34/NC ratio (r=-0,645, p<0,01)] but for male donors the negative correlation was signifi cant only for CD34 count (r=-0,550, p<0,01) and CD34/ NC ratio (r=-0,670, p<0,01) . For the donors >16 y (n=29) and \u226416 y (n=63), the median NC count [0,17 x10 8 /ml (0,09 x10 8 /ml -0,72 x10 8 /ml)vs 0,23 x10 8 /ml (0,12 x10 8 /ml -0,51 x10 8 /ml); p<0,05)], CD34 count [0,14 x10 6 /ml (0,03 x10 6 /ml-1,01 x10 6 /ml) vs 0,40 x10 6 / ml (0,09 x10 6 /ml-1,46 x10 6 /ml);p<0,01] and CD34/NC [0,74(0, 34-4,19) vs 1,68(0,54-4,81) ; (p<0,01)] were signifi cantly lower in the older donor group. With increasing age, the NC and CD34 counts per ml of BM and CD34 cells per NC decrease signifi cantly. The age of the donor should be taken into consideration while planning the volume of the BM collection for the targeted CD34 count. This might prevent the unnecessary high volume collection from the younger donors, while higher volumes might be necessary from older donors.",

Infusion of suffi cient stem cells is the most important factor for reconstruction of hematopoietic system next to HLA matching. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is now the predominant mobilizing agent used for HSCT. However, the number of CD34+ stem cells mobilized in response to G-CSF varies signifi cantly. The aim of this study was focus on the impact of genetic variation in hematopoietic stem cell mobilization by G-CSF. We compared the single-nucleotide polymorphisms of SDF1 and CXCR4 in healthy volunteer stem cell donors. Materials and Methods: This study was nested within a longitudinal cohort of 976 healthy donors who had mobilized by G-CSF for allogeneic PBSC donation via Buddhist Tzu-Chi Stem Cell Center from September 2006 to the end of December 2010. The G-CSF was given subcutaneously on the basis of 10ug/kg per day for 5 consecutive days. The outcome of mobilization was defi ned as the circulating CD34+ cells in peripheral blood after 5 days infection of G-CSF. A retrospective review of clinical records of donors, including donor gender, age, body height/weight, blood tests and circulating CD34+ cells in peripheral blood post GCSF injection was performed. The allele frequencies of the SNPs for SDF-1 and CXCR4, were compared between donors had high and low circulating CD34+ cells in peripheral blood. Results: Totally, 134 pairs of good and poor mobilized donors were included from this longitudinal cohort. The good and poor mobilized donors were selected from the top and bottom 10% CD34+ cell counts in each groups stratifi ed by donor age, body weight and gender. The allele frequencies of 6 SNPs in SDF1 (rs754618, rs2839693, rs266085, rs2297630, rs1801157, rs1065297) and 2 SNPs in CXCR4 (rs16832740, rs12691874) were tested. None of these SNPs showed signifi cant diff erence in allele frequency between good and poor mobilized groups. Conclusion: We did not fi nd any signifi cant SNPs by comparing the allele frequencies of the SNPs of CXCR4 and SDF1 in paired good and poor mobilized HSC donors. There are still many candidate genes need to be investigated. Further study to clarify the mechanism of moblization would be necessary to improve the effi cacy of hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and outcome of transplantation.",

The HSC potential donors are adults, who meet the minimum eligibility criteria for peripheral blood donor, according to Italian low, HLA typed and listed in the IBMDR. Donors and Methods: Peripheral Stem Cell collections are performed in the Peripheral Collection Centers (CCs-P) that are are located within public hospitals, authorized to perform aphaeretic procedures. Donor receives G-CSF (not biosimilar G-CSF), subcutaneously, at a maximum of 10 \u03bcg/Kg donor body weight. The characteristics of the collected PBSC (unit identifi cation code, nucleated cells parameters, volume) are certifi ed by the CC-P with Form CP201-p that must accompany the PBSC bags, and qualifi ed with serological and NAT tests for communicable diseases, according to Italian low. Results: From1989 to 2011 a total of 2.686 Haemopoietic Stem Cell Donations has been performed: 2.039 Bone Marrow Donations, and 647 Peripheral Stem Cell Donation, that are authorized as a fi rst stem cell donation from 2005. HSC units are been donated respectivelly for Italian and non Italian patients on 60% and 40% of cases. We compared the compliance of the CCs-P to Transplant Center (TC) prescription of Peripheral Stem Cells: TC required units with an average of CD34 5,2+1,1 x10e6/Kg, corresponding to 377+115 x10e6 CD34 and CCs-P distributed HSC units with an average of CD34 7,3+4,9 x10e6/Kg, corresponding to 491+203 x10e6 CD34 (Table I) . TC required units with CD34 >5x10e6/kg for 33% of patients, obtaining more than 72% of units with CD34 >5 x10e6/Kg; 97% of units contained CD34 >3x10e6/Kg, as show in Table II . Conclusions: This study show a good performance of CCs-P of IBMDR and a good compliance with the CD34 prescripted by national and international TCs, collecting more CD34 than requested in 40% of donations.",

Tay (1) , D. Allan (1) (1)University of Ottawa (Ottawa, CA); (2) Canadian Blood Services (Ottawa, CA) Background: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is used increasingly as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation to address shortages in matched donors, particularly in patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity. The role of ethnicity, however, on characteristics of units collected by cord blood banks and the impact of ethnicity on outcomes following transplantation remain unclear. Methods: A systematic search of published literature was performed using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE) . Studies that considered donor and/or patient ethnicity and included data concerning transplant outcomes or characteristics of collected UCB units were included. Results: A total of 403 published articles were identifi ed in our literature search of electronic databases and from experts' fi les. After removing duplicates, screening for relevance and reviewing in detail with regards to inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 21 studies underwent comprehensive review and data extraction. 11 studies addressed the impact of ethnicity on characteristics of collected units. Non-Caucasian ethnicity (African American, Asian, or non-Caucasian compared with Caucasian) was associated with a higher risk of rejecting the collected unit (4/4 studies), reduced total volume (3/9 studies), lower total nucleated cell count (5/9 studies), fewer CD34+ cells (4/9 studies) , and reduced colonyforming units (3/9 studies). Metanalysis was not possible due to lack of raw data reported in the studies. 9 studies reported worse outcome following transplant for non-Caucasian patients compared with Caucasians with respect to time to platelet engraftment (3/7 studies) , graft versus host disease (1/6 studies), overall survival (3/8 studies) and disease-free survival (1/4 studies) . The degree of HLA-matching, total nucleated cells infused, time to neutrophil engraftment and rates of relapse were not diff erent in any of the studies reporting on these outcomes. 1 of 3 studies that addressed the impact of mismatched donor/recipient ethnicity reported reduced overall survival for non-matched transplants. Conclusions: Non-Caucasian ethnicity may be associated with reductions in quality indicators of collected cord blood units. Transplant outcomes in patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity may be associated with delayed platelet engraftment and reduced overall survival. More research is needed to understand and optimize cord blood banking and transplantation to improve outcomes for non-Caucasians.",

Tang (1) (1) National Taiwan University (Taipei, TW); (2) National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei, TW) Objective: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) has been used to treat malignancies and immune and hematologic diseases for more than 50 years. According to a report by Buddhist Tzu Chi Stem Cells Center suggests that, only 25% of patients were able to fi nd an HLA-identical sibling as donors, while less than 50% of patients were able to fi nd an HLA -matched unrelated donor. For those patients who did not have matched donors, the question remains whether a partially matched unrelated donor or a familial mismatched/haplo-identical donor would be a better option. Methods: 151 patients who received Allo-HSCT between 1987 and October 2012 were analyzed, with 80 undergoing HLA\u22643 mismatched unrelated donor transplantation (HLA\u22643 UDT), 51 receiving HLA\u22643 mismatched related donor transplantation (HLA\u22643 RDT), and 20 having HLA>3 mismatched related donor transplantation (HLA>3 RDT). Time-to-event was assessed starting on the day of transplantation, and overall survival (OS) rates, cumulative incidences of relapse rates and treatment related mortality (TRM) rates for the 3 groups were compared. Results: Table 1 shows the patient demographics, indicating a strong similarity between the 3 groups in terms of age, gender, disease and pre-HSCT disease status, with the exception of a higher proportion of peripheral blood stem cell and ABO mismatch in the HLA\u22643 UDT group. The 5-year OS rate after HL\u22643 UDT was 53.9%, followed by 23.6% after HLA\u22643 RDT and 13% after HLA>3 RDT (Fig 1) , showing a signifi cant diff erence (P=0.009). Comparison of cumulative incidence of relapse rates between the 3 groups indicated that the number for patients with HLA\u22643 RDT was 74.1%, signifi cantly higher than those for HLA>3 RDT (69%) and HLA\u22643 UDT (37.2%)(P=0.045). The TRM rates after HLA\u22643 UDT, HLA\u2264 3 RDT and HLA>3 RDT were 20.3%, 49% and 62%, respectively. Conclusions: Our study fi nds a relatively higher 5-year overall survival rate (53.9%) and a lower relapse rate after HLA\u22643 UDT, signifi cantly better than the patients after HLA mismatched related donor transplantation. This could become a clinical reference for physicians when they choose donors for patients who have no suitable candidates.",

We report here the comparison of patients consecutively grafted with an unrelated or related donor after FBA RIC. Patients and methods: From July 2005 to December 2010, 109 patients with hematological malignancies were allografted using FBA RIC: for 51, stem cells from an unrelated donor stem cells (alloUD) were used while 58 patients received a HLA sibling (allo-SIB). FBA consisted of fl udarabine (30 mg/m2 5 days), iv busulfan (3.2 mg/kg 2 days), and intermediate dose of ATG (2.5 mg/kg 2 days). Peripheral blood stem cells were used in all but 4 patients, receiving marrow stem cells (alloUD group). Cyclosporine alone was used as GVHD prophylaxis. The two cohorts received an identical supportive care. Results: Patient characteristics were not statistically diff erent ( Table 1 ). The median follow-up of alive patients was 43 months S98 (range 19-76) . For alloUD and alloSIB grade 2-4 aGVHD incidence was 17% (CI 7-28) and 27% and cGVHD incidence was 39% (CI 25-53) and 28% , respectively (p= ns). For the whole population (n= 109), the 4-year PFS, OS and relapse incidence were 40%, 52%, and 47%; 1-year and 4-year non relapse mortality (NRM) were 12% and 20%, without signifi cantly differences between the 2 groups. Infectious complications were reported in Table 2 . Results were similar, except for bacterial infections, CMV infections and multiple reactivations which seemed more frequent in alloUD cohort. Conclusions: This retrospective study comparing unrelated to HLA identical sibling after a homogenous ATG-based RIC showed that acute and chronic GVHD incidence as well as PFS, OS, RR, and NRM were not diff erent. Infectious complications, mainly bacterial and viral, were more frequent after alloUD. Based on patient characteristics, this RIC regimen including \"middle\" doses of ATG, achieved a good balance between effi cacy and tolerance, and can be used as common platform before allogeneic transplantation from different kind of donors.",

            "text": "Does the 18 month survival rate following a haploidentical bone marrow transplant diff er from the 18 month survival rate following a mismatched unrelated donor transplant? O Fasan, T. Klumpp, R. Patel, P. Kropf, M. Martin, J. Ulicny, K. Mangan, M. Sharma Temple University (Philadelphia, US) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a curative option for adult patients with hematologic malignancies. About 30% of patients will have matched sibling donors. For the remainder of patients an unrelated donor will be found for 50% of Caucasians and for ethnic minorities the chances are much less. Alternative donor transplantation using related haploidentical donors and cord blood is an option for patients without a sibling or unrelated donor. Cord blood transplantation is not widely accessible and is resource intensive making haploidentical transplants the logical alternative donor source. However there are concerns about the survival following a haploidentical transplant. Goal: To compare the published 18 month survival following a myeloablative conditioned (MAC) haploidentical transplantation to the 18 month survival of mismatched unrelated donor transplants at our center. Subjects and methods: We retrospectively analyzed data on consecutive matched unrelated donor transplants for which we had molecular typing results at HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 and DQ. Subjects had a 10/10 or 9/10 unrelated donor and were undergoing their fi rst transplant. The data was extracted from our in house developed quality management database and analyzed using SAS software. Results: One hundred twenty two (122) patients met our inclusion criteria, including 77 males and 45 females. The median age on day of transplant was 50.5 years. The diagnoses were: ALL = 22, AML = 50, CLL = 7, CML = 13, MDS = 8, NHL = 10, others = 12. Ninety two patients had a 10/10 allele match and 30 patients had a 9/10 allele match. Forty eight percent received MAC regimens and 52% received RIC regimens. The 18 month OS for the 9/10 matched transplant was 43% and the published actuarial 18 month OS for MAC haploidentical bone marrow transplant is 62% (Railoa et al, BBMT, Article in Press) (p = 0.174). Survival for 10/10 matched transplant was 46% not signifi cantly diff erent from 9/10 matched transplants (p = 0.687). Conclusions: The 18 month OS for MAC haploidentical bone marrow transplant is not inferior to the 18 month OS for mismatched unrelated donor transplants at our center. We will be adopting MAC haploidentical bone marrow transplant as an option for our patients.",

Serventi-Seiwerth, M. Mikulic, B. Labar, R. Zunec Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb (Zagreb, HR) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been established as a method of therapy for hematologic malignancies and other hematologic or immune disorders. Donor selection has been almost exclusively based on selecting a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical donor. The diff erences among populations arising from the HLA polymorphism also play a role and should be considered in establishing the matched unrelated donor (MUD) search protocol. The aim of this study was to address this question with respect to the Croatian population. In the period 2009-2012 (July), a successful search for MUD/CBU in the Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide (BMDW) was performed at our centre for 105 patients for whom a matched donor could not be previously found among family members. The donor was an unrelated individual in 103 cases, while for the remaining two patients CBU was chosen as a source of HSCT, double CBU transplantation in one case. The HLA typing criteria in our transplantation centre is high resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 loci. However, the 10/10 matching level was not achieved for 67 patients. For thirty-one patient 9/10 matched donor was found and for fi ve patients 8/10 donor was found. The highest number of mismatches was found at the HLA-C and -DRB1 loci (14 patients each). However, the most interesting fi nding regarding HLA matching was observed among our patients positive for the HLA-DRB1*11 gene. Namely, patients with HLA-DRB1*11:04 allele were more diffi cult to match than those with HLA-DRB1*11:01 allele. This was the case for fi ve patients in the group of patients mismatched for one DRB1 allele (N=13), and one patient who received an 8/10 matched transplant and in addition to uncommon DRB1 allele (DRB1*11:28) also had the HLA-DRB1*11:04 allele. All those patients ultimately received a DRB1*11:01 positive transplant. The explanation for this fi nding lies in the almost equal frequency of DRB1*11:01 (7.9%) and DRB1*11:04 (7.7%) alleles among Croats as opposed to the predominance of DRB1*11:01 in registries with largest representation in BMDW. In conclusion, this study revealed some specifi c characteristics of the Croatian population which should be taken into account while performing the donor search. The fi nding regarding the HLA-DRB1*11 alleles is an important example of how the diff erences in allele distribution between Croats and populations with potential donors can infl uence the search outcome.",

In the present retrospective study we analysed 382 patients undergoing HSCT between 1995 and 2011. Of these 115 patients received an HLA-C mm HSCT and 266 received an HLA-C matched graft. Only patients with malignant disease were included in the analysis with no signifi cant diff erences between patients with HLA-C matched or mm donors. Median age was 42 (<1-68) versus 41 (<1-65) years in the matched and mm groups respectively. Early/late disease was 119/147 and 51/64, respectively (ns). Reduced intensity conditioning was given to 100 patients (38%) among HLA-C matched patients compared to 42 (37%) in the HLA-C mm group. Myeloablative conditioning was similar in both groups. Female donor to male recipient was given to 20 (8%) in the matched group versus 19 (17%) in the mm group. Bone marrow was used as stem cell source in 74 (28%) patients in the HLA-C matched group compared to 45 (39%) in the mm group (ns). The remaining patients received PBSC in each group. Median CD34 cell dose (x106/kg) was 7.2 (0. 2-56.4) versus 7.1 (0.3-28.7) , respectively. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA + MTX in 84% versus 85% of the patients in each group. ATG was given to all patients before HSCT. An HLA-C mm between donor and recipient has previously been associated with an increased risk of graft failure (GF). In the present material GF occurred in 9 (3.4%) in HLA-C matched group compared to 7 (6.1%) in the mm group (ns). In multivariate analysis for GF, major AB0 mismatch (p=0.03), RIC (p=0.01) and female donor to male recipient (p=0.002) were signifi cant risk factors. HLA-C mm was not found to be signifi cant (p=0.71). Neither had HLA-C mm any impact on mortality. Signifi cant factors associated to mortality in multivariate analysis were: disease stage (p<0.001), year of HSCT (p=0.015) and donor age (p<0.001). For acute GVHD grades II-IV CsA+MTX (p<0.001) and RIC (p<0.001) decreased the risk whereas the use of PBSC (p=0.016) increased the risk. HLA-C matched patients compared to HLA-C mm showed no statistical diff erence regarding TRM, RFS, mortality, acute GVHD grades II-IV and relapse incidence. In conclusion, in the present study we fi nd no negative impact of HLA-C mismatch on outcome after HSCT. The use of ATG in the conditioning could be one important explanation for this diff ering",

Although a less stringent level of HLA matching is acceptable in umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT), when compared to bone marrow, data on the HLA loci and the degree of resolution tolerated for good outcome is limited. Alloreactive donor derived natural killer (NK) cells, regulated in part by KIR genes, have also been shown to infl uence UCBT outcome. Our aim was to examine the eff ect of high-resolution (HR) HLA and donor KIR-patient HLA ligand mismatches (MM), and other prognostics factors on the clinical outcome of 86 patients transplanted with unrelated single cord blood units (CBUs) issued from the NHS Cord Blood Bank (NHS-CBB). Methods: Patients (n=86) of whom 61 were aged <15 yrs and with various clinical conditions including 47 patients with acute leukaemia were studied. Twenty-nine patients had received TBI with or without cyclophosphamide plus other drugs. DNA from patients and CBUs was whole genome amplifi ed when required and retrospectively sequenced at HR for HLA-A,-B,-C,-DRB1, and -DQB1 loci. Samples were also genotyped by PCR-SSOP/Luminex for the presence or absence of 16 KIR genes. Clinical outcome data was provided by the Eurocord registry and the NHS-CBB. Results: HR typing revealed additional HLA MMs previously not observed by low-resolution (LR) typing methods. Univariate analyses showed that both LR and HR MM in HLA-DRB1, and LR MM in the DQB1 loci were signifi cantly associated with increased risk of mortality (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.0, P=0.042; RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.6, P=0.002 and RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-5.1, P=0.021 respectively). A single MM at the HLA-A gene typed at LR was associated with decreased rate of neutrophil engraftment (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0, P=0.05). We found no signifi cant associations between any HLA single gene MM with acute GvHD II-IV, TRM, and relapse. Donor iKIR 2DL1 and patient ligand HLA-C2 MM were signifi cantly associated with acute GvHD II-IV (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1. 6-7.7, P=0 .006) and relapse (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.0-13.4, P=0.020) Conclusions: Our data suggests that matching patients and CBUs at LR for HLA-A,-B and HR -DRB1 loci appears to be adequate for successful UCBT outcome but additional MM for donor iKIR gene-patient HLA ligand should be considered. A larger series of recipients and donors of UCBT will need to be studied to draw defi nitive conclusions.",

Apperley (2) , R. Szydlo (2) , K. Rezvani (2) (1)Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Hammersmith Hospital (London, GB) ; (2)Imperial College London (London, GB) Unrelated donor (URD) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative therapy for a variety of haematological disorders. It is well established that allelic HLA matching between recipient and donor at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DR improves success of URD HSCT. The role of HLA-DPB1 disparity is not well defi ned, with matching not currently performed at our centre. We examined the impact of HLA-DPB1 matching on overall survival (OS) and development of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GvHD). Allelic HLA typing was performed retrospectively on stored DNA from 114 recipients and their donors who underwent URD HSCT following myeloablative conditioning. 89 (78%) of donor and recipient pairs were mismatched at HLA-DPB1, with 18 mismatched at both alleles. Of the 89 HLA-DPB1 mismatched recipients, 49 (55%) were matched at all other loci, while additional mismatches were identifi ed at class I (n=20; 22%), class II (n=8; 9%) or both class I and II (n=12; 13%). Of the 25 recipients matched at HLA-DPB1, 11 (44%) were fully matched at all loci, while additional mismatches were identifi ed at class I (n=5; 20%), class II (n=5; 20%) or both class I and II (n=4; 16%). Recipients were stratifi ed according to the presence or absence of an HLA-DPB1 mismatch and outcomes (GvHD and OS) examined. Recipients mismatched at HLA-DPB1 had superior survival at fi ve years (74.8% vs. 56.8%; p=0.023) than recipients who were matched at HLA-DPB1 but mismatched at other loci or 12/12 matched recipients (fi gure 1). In contrast, incidence of grade II-IV acute GvHD was not signifi cantly diff erent between the two groups (45% vs. 48% in matched and mismatched respectively, p=0.77). The median time to onset of acute GvHD was 27. 5 (range 8-74) and 20 (range 11-122) days respectively. Similarly, there was no signifi cant diff erence in rates of chronic GVHD between HLA-DPB1 matched and mismatched recipients (61% in matched vs. 50% in mismatched, p=0.37, median time to onset 256 days and 212 days respectively). As linkage disequilibrium does not extend to HLA-DPB1, it was considered possible to assess HLA-DPB1 matching as an independent risk factor. The inferior survival of patients matched at HLA-DPB1 supports the current approach which does not restrict donor selection based on this locus. Furthermore it raises important questions about the loci's role in the Graft-Versus-Leukaemia eff ect, given the superior survival of mismatched recipients without evidence of increased acute or chronic GvHD. S101 at St.Bartholomew's Hospital, London. A clinical audit was performed on adult patients removed from the list without having received an allograft to analyse the HLA testing performed during the process of donor identifi cation. Methods: 166 testing episodes from 156 patients removed from the list without having received an allograft between the years 2009-2011 who had received HLA testing for either siblings, volunteer unrelated donor (VUD) search or both were analysed by year, ethnicity and diagnosis. 10 patients were present more than once due to discrete testing episodes for sibling/VUD workup. Results : 64.5% of the patients were male and 35.5% female (107/59). Median age was 46.5 years (range 18. 1-69.8 ). The main ethnic groups were N.European Caucasoid 74.7% (124), Asian 9.6% (16) and Black 9% (15) . The most frequent diagnoses were AML 27.7% (46), NHL 12% (20) and myeloma 10.2% (17) . Median number of days on the list was 109. 5 (range 8-847) . 24.1% of patients (40) had an HLA-matched sibling, with a median of 28.5 days to identify (range 0-106). 47.6% (79) patients were considered for VUD allograft for which 76% (59) had an HLA-matched donor identifi ed. 24.7% (41) patients were removed from the list because a donor was not identifi ed in suffi cient time. A total of 244 siblings and 236 VUD were tested. 11 patients with a donor identifi ed (11.3%) received an allogeneic transplant at a later date, of which 9 were with the donor identifi ed at the time; 2 patients used a diff erent donor identifi ed at a later date. Conclusion: Substantial HLA testing was performed for this patient cohort, of which only a small proportion eventually received an allograft. In the current fi nancial climate, this audit will help identify for which patients, if any, it may be possible to postpone donor testing -specifi cally the more expensive VUDs -until dates when the patient is clinically closer to allogeneic transplantation. Any fi nancial saving must be balanced against the need for adequate time to identify a donor. This audit will be extended to analyse patients who received an allograft over the same time period to assess any diff erences present in time taken to identify a donor.",

Cetin Erciyes University (Kayseri, TR) Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely administered to donors who provide peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for individuals who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplants. G-CSF administration is associated with a small but defi nite risks of serious adverse events like splenic rupture. The donor, healthy individual with a body weight of 66 kg and height of 149 cm, had no remarkable previous history except a 10 year history of smoking (10 cigarettes/day) and any physical examination abnormality. Her complete blood count, biochemistry and chest x-ray were normal. Serologic tests for hepatitis B, C and HIV were all negative. We started G-CSF (fi lgrastim) therapy at a dose of 11\u03bc/kg/day (twice daily administration) for 5 days. At forth day of mobilisation after 2 hours later of administration of G-CSF at 06 PM, she suff ered from a pain at chest bones. EKG fi ndings were normal. At 10:30 PM her pain began severe sharp and radiating to all abdominal regions. On physical assessment, she had left upper tenderness and rigidity. Tachycardia (110/min) and tachypnea (30/min) was present while signifi cant hypotension was not measured. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed splenic rupture and perisplenic fl uid. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the upper abdomen reveals irregular intrasplenic low-attenuation areas (arrows) consistent with ruptured spleen and perisplenic high density fl uid (asterix) compatible with blood (50 HU). HU: Hounsfi eld unit ( Figure 1 ). There was no sudden decrease in hematocrit and haemoglobin (Hgb) levels according to the blood count, so that at fi rst, splenectomy was not planned and she was followed up closely. We could not collect stem cell from our donor as expected risk of extra bleeding with citrate usage during aferesis and she refused collecting stem cell from bone marrow. When a Hgb decrease of 2 gr/dl and hematocrit decrased of 28.4% aschieved, we replaced one unit of eritrosit suspension. We should take care of splenic rupture in patients, previously administrated G-CSF and suff er from sharp and sudden abdominal pain.",

There are documented several Challenges in HSCT in developing centres like Nigeria. Blood donation is mainly commercial and medical students were encouraged to voluntarily donate blood components. This study is to assess the suitability of these voluntary donors. Method: A total of 67 students were randomly selected and samples assessed for full blood count(autoanalyser), Hepatitis B and C(rapid kit), Syphilis(rapid kit), HIV 1 and 11(rapid kit), Blood Group, Hemaglobin Genotype and Cytomegalovirus(rapid kit IgG). Results: 94% were age range 19-30 years, 2.6% Jehovah's Witnesses, 13.2% and 22.4% do not know their blood group and Hb genotype respectively. 67% have never donated blood and 5.3% are not aware of HSCT. Only 53.9% are willing to donate stem cells of which 12.5% want to be paid to donate stem cells. 26.3% have Hb genotype AS, 62% Blood Group O and 6% Rhesus Negative. 95.5% are CMV (IgG) positive, HbsAs 1.3% positive and 100% HCV negative.4(6%) was HIV 1 and 11 positive and 100% negative for Syphilis.Total mean White cells was 5500/ul \u00b11.3(range 3700-9100/ul),Mean Hb of 13.2g/dl \u00b1 1.7 (range 9.6 -16.9g/dl with 38.8% < 12.5g/dl),Mean Platelet count 285000/ul \u00b176.8(range 108000 -528000/ul with 7.5<200,000/ul). Conclusions: There is a very high prevalence of exposure to CMV, and a rather high prevalence of HIV that will require ELISA confi rmation of all blood used for HSCT.There is signifi cant donors that may not be fi t to donate red cell concentrate and these fi ndings may be worse for commercial donors.",

Mobilized PBSC have become the preferred cell source for 99% autologous and 75% of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT. The aim of this study is to present our experience in apheresis of autologous and allogeneic PBSC in hematological patients and healthy donors in the last 11 years. Material and Method: This is a retrospective study performed in the Institute for Transfusion Medicine of Republic of Macedonia and University Hematology Hospital between 2001 and 2012 in patients and healthy donors. PBSC harvesting was performed with continuous flow cell separator Baxter C53000 and COBE Spectra using conventional-volume apheresis processing. Mobilization regimens included granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone in healthy donors, and G-CSF alone or combination of G-CSF and disease-specific chemotherapy in patients. Minimum dose required to ensure successful and sustained engraftment was 2x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells and 2x10 8 /kg mono-nucleated cells (MNC) . Results: There were 403 apheresis procedures in total, of which 317 performed (78.7%) in 141 hematologic patients (88 S103 males and 53 females, aged 18-63), and 86 procedures (21.3%) in 50 healthy sibling donors (32 males and 18 females, aged 20-54). Sufficient number of PBSC was collected with 2.2 apheresis in patients (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , and 1.72 apheresis in donors (range [1] [2] [3] . The single procedure usually took 3-4 hours and the volume of collected stem cells was 50-220 ml. The tolerance of apheresis procedure in our patients and donors was good. The only adverse effects of the apheresis procedure were bone pain as reaction of G-CSF and numbness of the extremities as reaction of anticoagulant (hypocalcemia), which occur rarely and were very mild. The main indications for autologous SCT in our patients were: acute myeloid leukemia (28.4%), multiple myeloma (26.2%), Hodgkin disease (21.2%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12.7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7.8%); and acute myeloid leukemia (60%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (14%) and chronic myeloid leukemia (7%) in allogeneic SCT. Conclusion: Autologous collection and transplantations of PBSC makes nearly 80% versus allogeneic (20%). All allogeneic donations are done by sibling donors. We should work on developing unrelated donation, National Stem Cell Donors Registry and become a part of Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide.",

The enormous diversity of TCRs is in large part determined by the sequence in their hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) which is generated by somatic recombination of the Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) segments of the TCR-\u03b2 gene and by insertion of random non-template bases at recombination junctions. Each single CDR3 region is unique and can be referred as the fi ngerprint of a T-cell. To determine the entire diversity of T-cells in the course of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) based on their unique TCR-\u03b2 rearrangements, we utilized a multiplex TCR-\u03b2 PCR-assay in combination with next generation sequencing (NGS, Illumina HiSeq 2000) . For this purpose, we isolated DNA from 60 samples of sorted CD4-and CD8-positive T-cell preparations derived from peripheral blood of donors before and after G-CSF mobilisation. Our TCR-\u03b2 NGS-PCR revealed approximately 2 million sequence reads per sample which were intensively analysed by newly developed bioinformatics tools. After their alignment to germline segments (IMGT), we found a very similar V\u03b2-and J\u03b2-segment usage in CD4-and CD8-positive T-cells which was not signifi cantly aff ected by G-CSF administration. Despite this similar segment usage, two signifi cant and consistent diff erences between CD4and CD8-positive T-cells were detectable: (i) the CDR3 diversity is more restricted in the CD8-positive T-cells and (ii) the dominance of certain T-cell populations is much more prominent in the CD8positive T-cells. Our data provide a remarkable deep insight in the T-cell repertoire of CD4-and CD8-positive T-cells and in the development of T-cell composition of donors undergoing G-CSF induced stem cell mobilisation. In addition, our TCR-\u03b2 NGS-PCR approach is an innovative tool to track single T-cells based on their individual TCR-\u03b2 rearrangements.",

Farina, F. Spina, A. Guidetti, P. Longoni, F. Ravagnani, A. Dodero, V. Montefusco, C. Carlo-Stella, P. Corradini Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (Milan, IT) Backgroud: Plerixafor is a CXCR4-inhibitor that improves peripheral-blood-stem-cell (PBSC) mobilization when combined with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Plerixafor 'on demand' after chemotherapy + G-CSF may be effi cient and costeff ective, but timing of administration and criteria for patient selection are under investigation. Objectives: Our study was aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of plerixafor 'on demand' with chemotherapy + G-CSF and to design an algorithm for the 'on demand' use after high-dose cyclophosphamide + G-CSF. Patients and methods. Twenty-seven lymphoma (n=24) and myeloma (n=3) patients were treated with chemotherapy + G-CSF and plerixafor: 19 patients had failed a previous mobilization with chemotherapy + G-CSF, 8 received plerixafor as fi rst-line mobilizing therapy. The decision of adding plerixafor was based on circulating CD34+ cells at hematopoietic recovery. To devise an algorithm for the 'on demand' use of plerixafor after a fi rst mobilization attempt we reviewed the data of 107 patients treated with cyclophosphamide + G-CSF: 51 myeloma patients received 3-4 gr/ms and 56 lymphoma patients received 6-7 gr/ms. Leukocytes and CD34+ cells were analyzed by a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Twenty-six patients treated with plerixafor 'on demand' collected a median of 4,45 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells (range, 0,8-13) after a median of one plerixafor injection and one leukapheresis (range, [1] [2] [3] . Nineteen patients collected \u2265 4 x 10 6 CD34+/kg. The median fold increase of CD34+ cells after plerixafor was 4,8 (range, 1-52) . The median time from chemotherapy to plerixafor administration was 15 days (range, 12-25) . In our retrospective analysis on 107 patients treated with cyclophosphamide + G-CSF, having a CD34+ cell count < 10/\u03bcl on the day of leukocyte recovery (>1000/\u03bcl) or leukocyte count < 1000/\u03bcl after day +12 in myeloma and day +14 in lymphoma patients predicted the risk of failing PBSC collection by 2.7 and 2.8 times (p=0.001 and p=0.02) with a sensitivity of 89% and specifi city of 88%, respectively. Conclusions: Our results show that plerixafor 'on demand' can induce the collection of PBSC in > 90% of patients treated with chemotherapy + G-CSF. The retrospective analysis on 107 patients treated with cyclophosphamide + G-CSF showed that those with delayed hematopoietic recovery and CD34+ cells < 10/\u03bcl at recovery may deserve plerixafor 'on demand' , as fi rst-line mobilization therapy.

Saraceni, D. Capelli, A. Bosi, A. Rambaldi on behalf of GITMO (Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo) PBSC for ASCT have completely replaced BM also in AML; this policy did not change, although some recent studies suggest that PBSC source was associated with increased Relapse Incidence (RI) and reduced Overall Survival (OS). In a previous GITMO survey on 2333 AML patients PBSC were associated as well with an increased Relapse Incidence (RI) and reduced OS, but this analysis suff ered S104 S105 from some biases, consequent to missing data such as the interval between achievement of CR and ASCT and the cytogenetics and molecular characteristics of the patients undergoing ASCT. Now we have selected 970 AML non-M3 patients in whom the interval between CR achievement and ASCT and molecular/cytogenetics marker were available. According to cytogenetics/molecular markers, AML patients have been categorized in 4 groups (Foran JM Hematology 2010, 47-55 Educational Book) : group A including 154 patients with favourable molecular/cytogenetics; group B including 165 patients with adverse kariotype (K) or adverse molecular markers; group C including 354 patients with intermediate K; group D including 297 patients with normal K and unknown molecular markers. Median age was 47 (range 2-78); 511 were male and 459 female; 648 received ASCT with PBSC and 322 with BM;. 528 received conditioning with Busulfan, 304with chemotherapy not including Busulfan and 85 Received TBI; in 53 conditioning regimen was unknown. With a median follow-up of 911days (range 0-7543) the 5 years OS and LFS, in patients receiving BM ,were 46% and 39% respectively. In patients transplanted with PBSC (median follow up: 850 days, range 0-6065) 5 years OS and LFS were 46% and 38% respectively; one year non relapse mortality (NRM) was 6% for PBSC and 7% for BM ( Fig.1  a, b,c) . Multivariate analysis, including the main factors for the outcome (age, disease status, interval between diagnosis and ASCT, kind of conditioning, cytogenetics/molecular risk category and transplant era), showed that OS and LFS were signifi cantly aff ected by disease status at ASCT (CR2 or >CR2 vs CR1), age>60 years and cytogenetics/molecular category; factors infl uencing NRM were age (>30 years), disease status and interval between diagnosis and ASCT (Tab. 1). These data suggest that PBSC are similar to BM, while the main factors negatively aff ecting the outcome remain advanced age, biological characteristics and disease status at ASCT.",

Huang Peking University People's Hospital (Beijing, CN) Objectives: Until now, very few studies compared the clinical outcomes of transplant using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood (G-PB) and a combination of G-CSF mobilized bone marrow (G-BM) with G-PB (G-BM&PB). The aim of this study was to fi nd a more suitable cell preparation for each patient based on a risk-stratifi cation system. Methods: This retrospective study compared transplantation outcomes in 98 consecutive patients with standard-risk acute leukemia. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation was used G-CSF mobilized bone marrow and blood (G-BM&PB, n=65) or G-CSF mobilized blood (G-PB, n=33) from HLA-identical sibling donors. Results: The G-BM&PB and G-PB groups had significantly different speed of neutrophil recovery (medians 15 vs 14 days, respectively; P=0.009), but similar rate of platelet recovery. Cumulative incidences of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in the G-BM&PB and G-PB cohorts were similar (18.0% vs 21.8%, respectively; P = 0.697), but significantly different for grades III-IV aGVHD (5.5% vs 18.9%, respectively; P = 0.04). The G-BM&PB and G-PB cohorts showed similar cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD (cGVHD, 49.1% vs 42.7%, P = 0.467), 1-year cumulative incidences of treatment related mortality (16.2% vs 24.4%, P = 0.222), and 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse (13.8% and 26.8%, P = 0.115). The G-BM&PB group showed significantly higher 5-year probability of leukemia free survival (LFS) compared to G-PB group (77.8% vs 57.6%, P = 0.023). Multivariate analysis identified G-PB as an independent risk factor for III-IV aGVHD and LFS.",

Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) IB transplantation has been described as an effi cient way to infuse CB. Here we report on 23 patients undergoing IB-CBT for advanced haematological malignancies. The study was a phase II prospective monocentric study approved by local EC and registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov/; the primary endpoint was engraftment rate. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative (Bus or TBI based); prophylaxis of GVHD was CsA, MMF 15 mg/kg/ bid and ATG-F (15-30 mg/kg, td) .CB processing was as described by Frassoni et al. Infusion on both iliac crests was performed in OR with monitored care sedation.Median age was 36 yrs, median recipients weight 63 kg (52-93); 17 were AML, 4 ALL, 1 MM and 1 CML. Phase at transplant was mainly advanced (for AL: 10 primary refr. or res. relapse, 6 beyond fi rst CR,5 fi rst CR; 1 progression for MM and 1 CB for CML). 3 pts had a previous allotransplant and 4 an autotransplant. All CB units were 4/6 except for 3 (5/6) . Median total cell infused was 2.06x10e7/kg and median CD34+ cells 0.53x10e5/kg. The CI of neutrophils recovery (>0.5x10e9/L) was 82+9% at day+60. The CI of platelet recovery (>20 or 50x10e9/L) was 82+9% and 70+10% at day+90 respectively. 2pts died before engraftment, due to CNS bleeding and myocarditis. 2 pts didn't engraft and a second unit, again via IB, was given. 1-year OS and NRM were 66+11% and NRM 20+9%, respectively. aGVHD was 39% with only 1 pt with grade III. We recorded 3 limited cGVHD and 1 extensive. All the evaluable pts achieved a CR, except for the MM pt, who obtain a nCR and a resistant AL pt who remained cytopenic due to persistence of blasts. CMV reactivation occurred in 13/23 pts (median onset day+38);1 pt reactivated EBV and developed an EBV-related encephalitis, successfully treated with anti-CD20 MAb. 6 pts had a hemorrhagic cystitis (median onset day+23,4/6 pos. for BK-virus). We recorded 3 possible/probable IFI. To our knowledge this is the fi rst prospective study confi rming the feasibility and the impressive platelet recovery of a new route of CB transplant, fi rstly reported by Frassoni et al. Even if these data need to be confi rmed on a larger population, plt recovery and the low amount of cell needed using IB route are important challenges able to propose CBT as a real alternative option when a matched donor isn't available much more rapidly than currently is. In addition, IB-CBT represents an ideal in vivo model to study and understand the biological phenomena regulating the function of stem cell niche.",

Results: The allelic distribution in our cohort was representative with 133 (29%) and 15 (3%) donors heterozygous and homozygous for the A-allele, respectively. Median age and the sex distribution of the G/G-group and donors with the A allele were identical. The same was true for leukocyte counts at baseline and on day 5. Interestingly, the median concentration of mobilized CD34+ cells on day 5 was almost identical in donors with the A-allele (76/\u03bcl, range, 11-249) and G/G-group (71/\u03bcl, range . In addition, the allelic distribution was not diff erent in donors (n=11) who mobilized less than 20/\u03bcl CD34+ cells. No diff erence in the overall yield of CD34+ HSPC in the apheresis product and in the number of CD34+ HSPC/kg recipient could be detected between both groups. In a multivariate regression model for the prediction of CD34+ cells/\u03bcl at day 5, only male sex (Regression coeffi cient (RC) 11.2 , 95% CI 1. 5-21.1, p=0 .023) and BMI as continuous variable (RC 3.5, p=0 .0001) but not age, smoking status and CXCL12 allelic status represented independent variables. Conclusion: Our data derived from a large well controlled cohort contradict previous analyses suggesting an association between CXCL12 allelic status and yield of CD34+ HSPC. Concentration of CD34+ HSPC in the peripheral blood, the most objective parameter, could not be predicted by CXCL12 genotype. As the content of CD34+ HSPC in the graft is an important parameter for transplant outcome and novel drugs have been developed to boost CD34+ cell counts in the peripheral blood, more comprehensive, genome wide association studies in larger donor cohorts are warranted to identify other potential genetic predictors.",

This population of patients with T1DM is na\u00efve to cytotoxic drugs, and mobilization is their fi rst contact with cytotoxic drugs (such as CY). The group of T1DM consisted of 25 patients aged 18 to 35 (mean 25). There were 16 males and 9 females. The matched unrelated donor group consisted of 40 donors aged 19 to 40 (mean 27) group adjusted for demographic characteristics to reach similar distribution of sex, age and weight. There were 25 males and 15 females. For the purpose of this comparison we evaluated only the fi rst collection day data. White blood cell count (WBC) on the collection day ranged from 1.5 G/L to 33.3G/L (mean 15.7 G/L) in T1DM patients. The values for URD were 22,8 G/L to 63.43 G/L (mean 40.72) (p<0.00000001, t-test). CD34+ cells accounted for 0.21% to 4.2% WBC in T1DM (mean 0.99%) and 0.04 to 0.59% WBC (mean 0.19%) in URD (p<0.0001, . In absolute numbers of circulating CD34+ cells, the data comprised of 26 to 477 per microliter in T1DM patients (mean 127 cells/ microliter) while in URD population the numbers ranged from 23 to 265 (mean 76) (p=0.028, t-test). In terms of collection effi cacy, the average yield of CD34+ cells during the fi rst leukapheresis was 332 x 106 (range 150 to 814 x 106) in T1DM group. For the URD group the average yield during the fi rst leukapheresis was 294 x 106 (range 42 to 873 x 106) CD34+ cells (p=0.35 , t-test) .",

Lee, J. Lee, J. Lee, D. Kim, Y. Lee, Y. Kang, M. Jeon, M. Seol University of Ulsan (Seoul, KR) HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) without ex vivo-T cell depletion using conditioning with reduced-dose busulfan, fl udarabine, and ATG achieved consistent engraftment with low graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and transplantationrelated mortality (TRM; Lee K-H, Blood 2011; 118:2609 -2617 . Therefore, we initiated a prospective study, where patients with intermediate-high risk acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission (CR) underwent allogeneic HCT according to the donor priority of matched sibling (MS), matched unrelated (MU), then haploidentical familial donors (HF). Conditioning regimens for MS-HCT were busufan (3.2 mg/kg x 4 days)-cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2 days) or, for patients >55 years or with co-morbidity, busulfan (3.2 mg/kg x 2 days)-fl udarabine (30 mg/m 2 x 6 days)-ATG (Thymoglobulin 1.5 mg/kg x 3 days). Patients undergoing MU-or HF-HCT received busulfan (3.2 mg/kg x 2 days)-fl udarabine (30 mg/m 2 x 6 days)-ATG (Thymoglobulin 3 mg/kg x 3 days). GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine plus a short course of methotrexate, with cyclosporine taper initiated on days 30 (for ATG containing conditioning) or 60 (for BuCy conditioning). Between January 2010 and June 2012, 123 patients were enrolled. Of those, 6 patients experienced recurrence of their leukemia at the time HCT and, therefore, excluded from the analysis. The characteristics of remaining 117 patient-donor pairs were summarized in Table 1 . The median follow-up duration of survivors was 17.5 months (range, 4.2-34.4 months) . The donor-group eff ect on the HCT outcomes was described in Table 2 . In this preliminary analysis, patients undergoing HF-HCT showed higher frequency of grade 2-4 acute GVHD when compared to those undergoing MS-or MU-HCT. However, there was no signifi cant diff erence in terms of chronic GVHD, leukemia recurrence, TRM, event-free survival, and overall survival. These results corroborated our previous observations showing the feasibility of HF-HCT using a common reducedintensity conditioning regimen of busulfan, fl udarabine, and ATG. This study is ongoing with further patient enrollment and longer follow-up period.",

Lee Ewha Womans University (Seoul, KR) Background: The mechanism on HSC seem to be complex including the role of SDF gradient between BM and PB, and the role of protease pathway. We previously had reported that LT(Leukotriene)B4 was able to mobilize HSC in the murine model within 4 hours without signifi cant side eff ects. Since there are possibilities of similar mechanisms during HSC mobilization, which are shared by rhG-CSF or LTB4, in this study, we investigate the role of LTB4 receptor by rhG-CSF during HSC mobilization. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained via cardiac puncture. Samples were analyzed for TNC using trypan blue staining and FACS analysis using Sca-1, Lin, CD45R(B220), CD116, Gr-1, TER119 were performed. LTB4APA and U75302, which are LTB4 receptor antagonists were given to C57BL/6 mice at diff erent dose levels(0.5\u03bcg, 1\u03bcg, 2\u03bcg or PBS with equal volume in control arm) followed by rhG-CSF (5\u03bcg, IV). Results: The number of WBC and HSC were decreased in rhG-CSF mobilized mice, in which LTB4 receptor antagonists were given. Up to 1\u03bcg of LTB4APA or U75302, there were tendencies of blocking of mobilization in dose dependent manner. However, beyond 1\u03bcg of LTB4 receptor antagonists, the blocking eff ects were in plateau. Interestingly, the blocking eff ects on mobilization by LTB4 receptor antagonists were more dramatic by rh-GCSF than that of LTB4. Conclusions: LTB4 receptor is involved not only in the downstream pathway of rh-GCSF mobilization, but LTB4 mobilization pathway in C57BL/6 mice. The eff ect of rh-GCSF on LTB4 K/O mice should be studied further to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of progenitor cell mobilization. It is necessary to have the insights understanding more precise mechanisms on rhG-CSF and LTB4 mobilization for developing effi cient protocols in the clinic.",

Quartuccio, G. Acquafredda, I. Nardiello, C. Gagliardone, A. Moretta, M. Zecca IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo (Pavia, IT) Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are a very promising source for cell therapy. They can be isolated from various adult human tissues, but procurement is diffi cult. Therefore, research has focused on fi nding new, more convenient sources. A number of bone marrow (BM) processing and manipulation techniques have been developed to improve outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. BM erythrocyte depletion is used to circumvent donor/recipient incompatibility for ABO blood group antigens. The erythrocyte portion, containing a viable number of stem cells, is subsequently discarded. We report on the feasibility of expanding MSC from this material. For this purpose, after obtaining patient written informed consent, we sampled BM from four HLA-identical sibling donors, RBC depleted for ABO blood group antigen incompatibility. ER-MSC preparations were in vitro expanded and compared to counterpart MSC obtained from the same units before manipulation (BM-MSCs) . We evaluated CFU-F, growth rate, morphology, antigen surface expression, capability to diff erentiate and reach senescence. The median volume of the four erythrocyte portions was 300 ml (range: 800-100 ml) with a median MNC recovery of 484x106. This yield, which we consider an adequate quantity for MSC preparation, is comparable to that obtained from the processing of 50 ml starting BM suspension, the typical starting material for BM-MSC expansion. After plating MNC from the two sources at the same density (160.000 cm2), we observed a comparable number of CFU-F (ER-MSC: 4.4\u00b11.1, BM-MSC:6\u00b12.12) after 7-days culture. ER-MSC were comparable with BM-MSC for morphology and proliferative capacity, expressed as calculated cumulative cell count, with an hypothetical average cell recovery of 129x109 and 143x109, respectively. ER-MSC as well as BM-MSC expressed high levels (>95%) of CD90, CD73, CD105, CD13 and HLA A-B-C surface antigens, whereas they were negative for CD34, CD45, CD14, CD80, HLA-DR and CD31 molecules. ER-and BM-MSC were similarly able to diff erentiate into either adipocytes or osteoblasts. MSC from both sources reached senescence at the same number of passages (median P18) and they did not show chromosome instability. Our data indicate that the erythrocyte fraction obtained after BM erythrocyte depletion, a material that would be otherwise discarded, may be considered a good source of MSCs. The elevated number of cells that could be obtained make it suitable for clinical grade MSC expansion.",

Picardi (1) Background: Quality of selected Cord Blood Unit (CBU) strongly aff ects patient outcome after Cord Blood Transplant (CBT). Although the fi nal quality assessments (QA) are performed at infusion, QA are carried out during the whole process. Recently, the Cord Blood APGAR score based on the QA pre-freezing and at infusion has been identifi ed with promising results in order to optimize CBU selection. However, the role of QA at pre-releasing check remains undefi ned. Objectives: Aims of this study consisted of 1) comparing the QA in terms of cell dose and viability between pre-freezing, pre-releasing and at infusion and 2) defi ning a Quality Control Score System based on the CBU pre-releasing checks, performed on the attached segment before transplant, as predictive factor for CBT outcome. Methods: Our study includes 104 patients transplanted at 3 Italian Centres (Rome Transplant Network, Florence-Careggi and Bergamo-Ospedale Riuniti). Most of them (76/104) were aff ected by Acute Leukemia with median age and body weight of 28 years (0.6-66) and 54.5 kg (4-96), respectively. Pre-freezing and prereleasing data were collected from Cord Blood Banks and data at infusion from Transplant Centres. The Quality Control Score (QCS) was calculated as a sum of points related to the number of NC, CD34+ cells, CFU-GM and viability. Each variable has been classifi ed by quartiles. Each subset was weighted based on the value of correlation's coeffi cient. The degree of correlation between the variables was evaluated by the Spearman correlation coeffi cient. Results: Overall, our analysis has shown a signifi cant linear relationship between pre-freezing, pre-releasing and at infusion QA as number of NC (p<0.0001), CD34+ (p<0.0001) and CFU-GM ( < 0.01). Independently by the method used for the test, a significant correlation between pre-releasing and at infusion viability (p< 0.05) was found. Furthermore, 72 out of 104 patients were evaluable for the attribution of the QCS (ranged between 3 and 12) allowing the identifi cation of a cut-off of 9 as 3rd quartile. The patients who received CBU with a score > 9 showed a signifi cantly faster PMN engraftment (p=0.03), while the risk of acute GVHD (grade II-IV) was signifi cantly lower (p=0.02) for a QCS <9. Conclusions: The pre-releasing QA are predictive of cell dose at infusion and can be alternative to missing pre-freezing data. Finally, the pre-releasing QCS may represent a useful tool for optimizing CBU selection.",

Most patients had a haematological malignancy. A sibling donor was used in 377 cases and a matched unrelated donor in 478 cases. Most patients (n=553) were treated with conventional myeloablative conditioning while 302 received reduced intensity conditioning. Bone marrow (BM)(n=366) and PBSC grafts (n=489) were analysed separately as the cell-dose are very diff erent. Median nucleated (NC) and CD34+ cell dose was 2.9x108/kg vs. 11.3x108/kg and 3.8x106/kg vs. 7.9x106/kg in BM and PBSC grafts, respectively. First the BM and PBSC groups were divided into four equally sized groups depending on the nucleated or CD34+ cell dose. Then the diff erent outcome variables (survival, TRM, GVHD and engraftment) were studied in these groups. Corrections were made for diff erences in characteristics between the groups. In the BM group we found that a NC dose <2.0x108/kg were associated to more chronic GVHD (p<0.01), a slower platelet engraftment (p<0.01) and a trend for higher TRM (p=0.12). A low CD34+ cell dose (<2.3x106/kg) were correlated to slower neutrophil and platelet engraftment (p=0.037 and p<0.01) and a trend for more chronic GVHD (p=0.12).

A CD34+ cell dose >11x106/kg was associated to inferior survival (p=0.02), more relapse (p=0.02) and inferior RFS (p<0.01) but quicker platelet engraftment (p=0.02).",

Vallejo University Central Hospital of Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Background: previous studies have suggested that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from HLA-identical sibling using peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSC) accelerates the engraftment and decreases the relapse rate of high-risk malignancies, but increases the risk of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) compared to bone marrow (BM). In the unrelated donor (URD) setting, a recently published randomized study did not detect signifi cant survival diff erences between PBSC and BM transplants. In addition, the use of low-dose anti-thymocyte (ATG) might modify the pattern of events when comparing between both HSC sources.",

Methods and patients: we report the outcome of 56 consecutive patients (pts) who underwent allo-HSCT from URD during the last four years in our institution. Pts receiving BM were older than those transplanted with PBSC. As expected, the number of CD34+ and CD3+ cells infused were substantially higher in the BM arm. The characteristics of the series of pts is showed in the table. Results: as is shown in the table, early acute GVHD and gr. II-IV acute GVHD were higher in the PBSC group. On the other hand, graft failure (GF) and overall survival were higher in the BM group. The 3 pts who had GF were rescued with autologous backup (2) and with a second transplant (1) , and are alive at the last follow-up. Conclusion: in our experience, BM exhibits better long-term outcome than PBSC URD transplant, and continues to be the preferred source of SC for the majority of patients.",

Navarrete (4) (1)NHS Blood and Transplant (Bristol, GB) ; (2) Objective: The NHS-CBB was established in 1996 and has over 19,500 unrelated cord blood units (CBUs) stored of which around 40% are from ethnic minority donors. We have issued over 400 CBUs for transplantation to patients worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of CBUs stored from the clinical outcome of the transplants performed. Methods: In collaboration with Eurocord registry, we performed a retrospective analysis of the outcome of 190 single and 104 double cord blood transplants (CBT) from 1998 to December 2011. The clinical end points analysed were platelet and neutrophil engraftment, acute and chronic GVHD, overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Median follow up (FU) for single CBTs was 33.8 months (3.1-144.4 ) and for double CBT was 17.6 months (1.2-85.1) . Results: Two different analysis were performed by graft type (single or double UCBT). The majority, 155 (81%) of the single CBTs were in children and 125 (66%) had malignant disease (MD). Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 23 and 40 days, respectively. The K-M estimate of aGVHD (II-IV) incidence was 33\u00b14% and 14\u00b13% (grade III and IV). cGVHD was seen in 28 patients,10 (43%) extensive and 13 (57%) limited. OS was 61% in children and 30% in adults; 63% for HLA matched 6/6 or 5/6 and 43% in the 4/6 or less matched transplants; 64% in transplants with TNC >4.1x10 7 /kg and 42% in those with <4.1x10 7 /Kg, and 61% in those with >1.8 x10 5 /kg CD34+ cells and 46% in those with <1.8x10 5 /Kg. At 3 years, DFS in patients with MD was 44\u00b15%. Cause of death evaluated in 81 patients showed 23 were due to relapse, 57 were transplant related and 1 was secondary malignancy. Of the double CBTs 93 (89%) were in adults and of these 90 (98%) had MD. Myeloablative conditioning was used in 39 (41%) patients and RIC in 57 (59%). Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 21 and 40 days, respectively. The K-M estimate of aGVHD incidence was 29\u00b15%. At 18 months, OS was 51\u00b15% and DFS was 44\u00b16%. Cause of death in 51 patients with data were relapse (31%) or transplant related (69%). Conclusions: The clinical outcome of CBTs performed using NHS-CBB units compares favourably with published studies indicating that the procedures in place at the NHS CBB contribute to safe and high quality products for transplantation.",

Anagnostopoulos (1) (1)G.H. \"G.Papanicolaou\" (Thessaloniki, GR); (2) Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Thessaloniki, GR) Objectives: The microparticles (MPs) are small membrane vesicles (sized around 0.1mm) relased from diff erent cell types after activation or apoptosis. MPs are considered markers of cell activation and apoptosis. Recently MPs were shown to participate in important biological functions and pathological processes, such as angiogenesis in tumor metastasis, infl ammation, thrombosis and haemostasis. The aim of this study is to quantify the MPs in cord blood units and to investigate their relationship with diff erent parameters. Methods: Collected cord blood units (CBUs) (n=30) were processed with SEPAX apparatus (BIOSAFE) and analysed based on their net volume, the absolute number of CD34+cells/unit and their viability by fl ow cytometry, the number of total nucleated cells (TNC) and the absolute number of nucleated red cells by microscope after Giemsa staining. Mononuclear cells were seeded in semisolid culture in the presence of growth factors (SCF, IL-3, GM-CSF, EPO) for CFU-GM, BFUe and CFU-GEMM colony growth. MPs were isolated after plasma centrifugation. The number of MPs was determined after incubation with annexin-V and anti-CD34 by fl ow-cytometry. Electron microscope photographs were obtained. For the statistical analysis used t-test, Pearson's and Spearman's depending on the normality of the distribution of variables. Results: The mean (\u00b1 SD) number of annexin-V+/CD34+MPs was 73\u00b122/ \u03bcl. Univariate analysis showed that the number of MPs had signifi cant negative correlation to the number of BFU-E (p<0,019; r=-0,426), CFU-GEMM (p<0,016;r=-0.435) and CFCs (p<0,015; r=-0,440). There was no signifi cant correlation between the number of MPs and each of the following: TNC, CD34+, CFU-GM the net units volume. CBUs were frozen and thawed and the numbers of annexin-V+/ CD34+MPs and colonies were determined. Univariate analysis showed that the number of MPs has strong negative correlation to the post-thaw number of BFU-E (p<0,0012; r=-0,988) and CFU-GM (p<0,038;r= -0.962). The number of MPs has strong positive correlation to the number of CFU-GEMM (p<0,0; r=1,0) after thawing. Concusion: MPs from haematopoietic progenitor cells were identifi ed in cord blood units. The number of annexin-V+/CD34+MPs showed a signifi cant negative correlation with the number of colonies (total CFUs, CFU-GEMM, BFU-E) as well as the post-thaw number of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies. The role of MPs in CBUs and possible correlation with transplantation remains to be investigated.",

            "text": "Stem cell viability in umbilical cord banking; how good are our quality controls? R.C. Duggleby (1) Objectives: Umbilical cord blood (CB) is increasingly being used as a viable alternative to peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates as a stem cell source in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Practically, however, it requires cryopreservation in large (25ml) volumes and establishment of an accredited CB Bank. Recently, we published (Transfusion 2012) that the standard flow cytometer assessments of viability, utilizing 7-Aminoactynomicin D (7AAD), do not detect early apoptotic cells. Significant numbers can be present following thawing, detected by labelling with annexin V (AnnV). In CB banking, the tubing used to fill the storage bag is sealed into segments and frozen with the rest of the unit (25 ml bag). These segments can then be thawed as quality controls. However, these more sensitive assessments raise the possibility that differences might arise between segment and bag, compromising their value as quality controls. Methods: Control thaws (n=18) of CB units were performed to reassess the effi cacy of using the segments as quality controls for the unit. Assessed were stem cell dose (ISHAGE guidelines), nonapoptotic dose by AnnV labelling, and functional cell dose (n=12) by 14-day, colony forming unit assay (CFU). Results: The paired bag and segments showed extensive evidence of loss of CD34+ cell viability with high proportions of AnnV (~ 65% in both) and 7AAD+ (10%) and morphology (30%). Despite this, viability and cell dose correlated in the bag and the segment, and there was no signifi cant diff erence in the median proportion of CD34+ cells present or absolute counts of viable CD34+ cells. In addition, the correlation between function dose (by CFU) and viable CD34+ dose (by AnnV) was very similar in the bag and the segment (R2= 0.546 and 0.549). Conclusion: These data indicate that, as observed previously, extensive apoptosis occurs post-thaw. However, the data also suggests that the segment still appears to behave similar to the bag, despite the diff erence in volume (~0.1ml to 25 mls). Reassuringly, this indicates that the segments remained a valid quality control for the remaining unit. It should be noted that the majority of these units were cryopreserved for less than 1.5 years, thus the stability of this relationship with time remains to be seen. Also this is an on-going process, larger sample sizes may detect diff erences. However, Our ability to assess the units that are banked is essential if we are to be able to guarantee the viable/functional cell dose delivered to a patient.",

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis on the outcome of 19 patients transplanted for primary immunodefi ciency who received HSCT between 2001 and 2011 at our center (Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain). Data was analyzed using SAS 9.1 Statistical Program. A p value less than 0.05 was considered signifi cant. Person chi-square test used for comparative analysis. Results: 19 patients with primary immunodefi ciency were treated with HSCT, 7 received HD from peripheral blood, 5 UCBD and 7 BMD (3 related and 4 unrelated). The median patient age at transplant was 22,2 months (range, 2-99 months). The most common condition transplanted was severe combined immunodefi ciency (68% of patients). Survival rate at six months was 71% in HD, 85% in BMD and 100% in HD. Only 3 patients did not develop post transplant infections, out of which 2 belonged to group treated with BMD and 1 to HD. The main cause of infection was infection by gram negative. Cytomegalovirus reactivation after HSCT was observed in 50% of patients treated with HD and in 50% with BMD. 7 patients developed acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD), out of which 66.7% belonged to BMD and 33.3% to UCBD. Also, 7 patients presented GvHD of the skin, out of which 66.7% belonged to BMD and 33.3% to UCBD. Hematopoietic reconstitution was observed in 17 patients. Only 2 patients, treated with HD,",

Skoumalova (3) (1)University Hospital Brno (Brno, CZ); (2)University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady (Prague, CZ); (3)University Hospital Olomouc (Olomouc, CZ) Introduction: Combination of plerixafor + G-CSF is approved for mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells for autologous transplantation (ASCT) in patients with lymphoma and myeloma whose cells mobilize poorly. The recommended schedule is to administer plerixafor approximately 10 hours before apheresis to collect the cells during the estimated peak mobilization. This recommendation arises from the fi rst studies phase I and II, in which the CD34+ cells peripheral blood concentrations after plerixafor were monitored. However, the data considering CD34+ cells concentration kinetics after plerixafor administration were studied in healthy subjects and patients who were not proven poor mobilizers. Our aim was to check whether the mobilization kinetics is similar also in poor mobilizers. Patients and methods: Nine patients (5 males, 4 females) of median age 53 years (19-63), treated for lymphoma (n=5) and myeloma (n=4), were given plerixafor for proven (n=7) or estimated (n=2, both after previous high dose chemotherapies) mobilization failure. Plerixafor was used in a standard schedule in 7 patients (G-CSF 10 ug/kg day 1-5/+6, plerixafor 240 ug/kg day 4/+5, apheresis day 5/+6), and on-demand in two patients during failing chemomobilization (plerixafor 240 ug/kg day before apheresis during WBC increase after chemotherapy + G-CSF). CD34+ cells count was measured in peripheral blood just before plerixafor administration and subsequently every 2 hours for next 16 hours after 11 plerixafor injections (2 patients received 2 doses of plerixafor). All patients signed informed consent with the study. Results: Seven out of 9 patients (78%) yielded at least 2x10e6 CD34+ cells/kg (median 4,81; range 2,01-6,71). The CD34+ cells concentrations in blood peaked between 2 and 10 hours after plerixafor administrations. If we consider the CD34+ cell count in the blood in the morning before the fi rst plerixafor injection as 100%, the percentage of CD34+ cell concentration increase was in mean between 399% and 426% during 2 and 10 hours after plerixafor injection and then started to quickly drop. Conclusions: The standard recommended schedule for plerixafor administration is derived from data obtained in healthy subjects and normally mobilizing patients. The late evening plerixafor administration is not very practical and, moreover, the peak mobilization could be missed in poor mobilizers. We can conclude, that plerixafor administration 2 hours before apheresis in poor mobilizers could be more effi cient and practical as well.",

Murzyn (1) Introduction: At present , the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are new and giving new opportunities for therapies of various inherited and acquired disorders. Wharton Jelly (WJ) as a source of MSC has all the advantages of cord blood and it is reachable in MSC. In the present publication we describe the results of the collection, culture, investigation, and cryopreservation of cells derived from the umbilical cord (UC) collected by the companies from the group controlled by The Polish Stem Cell Bank confi rmed by clinical application. Materials and methods: UC were collected after natural deliveries as well as caesarian sections. UC samples were packed in a special transport container. In the laboratory, plastic-adherent cells were isolated cultured, and enumerated, and their viability was evaluated. Then the cells were cryopreserved and placed in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen. The repeated cell counting, viability tests, fl ow cytometric immunophenotyping, and functional in vitro diff erentiation assays were performed from thawed reference samples. Results: We reported a low contamination level . The fi rst adherent cells with fi broblast-like morphology were well distinguishable within a week after the initiation of the cell culture. We haven't noticed any diff erences in growth, cell number and morphology in primary culture between tissue fragments from placental, central and baby side. The average number of p0 cells from the 6-well plate dish was between 1,5 x 10 6 \u00b1 0,2 x 10 6 . The fi rst adherent cells with fi broblast-like morphology were well distinguishable within a week after the initiation of the cell culture. The post-thaw viability was not lower than 85% and thawed cells give rise the new culture in less than 4 hours. The immunophenotype (CD45-/CD34-/CD19-/HLA-DR-/CD73+/CD90+/CD105+) was stable during the whole period of culture (15 passages) . Cells were capable for diff erentiation into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic cells. Conclusion: The results described above demonstrate a quick, repeatable and effi cient method for WJ-derived MSC isolation and propagation to get MSC units contained cells in a number hypothetically suitable for clinical use. Moreover, we have found that the effi ciency of the isolation and the number of received cells is not aff ected by the origin of the fragment of the tissue from which the cells were isolated.",

Olkowicz, D. Boruczkowski, T. Oldak, J. Baran Polish Stem Cells Bank SA (Warsaw, PL) Introduction: Today cord blood (CB) is widely recognized as a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). For potential transplantations the major key is the number of CD34+ cells derived. The number of CD34+ cells derived from single umbilical CB is often not enough for eff ective transplantation in adults. The human placenta is a possible source of additional progenitor cells and/or stem cells. Some CB banks try to increase the CB volume collected by the additional puncture of the cord's vessels with a needle & syringe. The results of these attempts are not satisfactory, which is why we developed the new strategy of obtaining an additional pool of cells by fl ushing placenta vessels. Materials and methods: CB and placenta blood was obtained using specially constructed separate kits during natural deliveries. CB was obtained in accordance with standard procedures. After birth, the placenta was rinsed by the injection of a solution into placenta vessels and we got an extra portion of blood. The number of CD34+ cells, viability, total nucleic cells (TNC) and contamination in placenta blood and CB was determined. Results: Flow cytometry showed that HSC were in the placental perfusion blood. A signifi cant increase in CD34+ was observed. Additionally we received on average signifi cantly more TNC and CD34+ cells, whereas the averaged viability of the high level remained, and the percentage of contaminated units stayed unchanged. Conclusion: Based on our results we suggest that the CB collection with placental blood might off er an increase in the CD34+ number. Of course further studies are necessary, but in the case of allogeneic or autologous CB transplantations, today we can predict the increase of the recipient's body weight by about 15% -20%. These double portions may be used in a higher number of adult lifesaving transplantation therapies. We also showed that the method of collecting placenta blood is quick and easy for potential clinical use and safe for both, newborn and mother.",

Afanasyev R.Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of children hematology and transplantation (St. Petersburg, RU) Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be the only curative option for patients with unfavorable acute leukemia's. Improvements over the last 15 years in conditioning regimens, graft engineering and pharmacological immunoprophylaxis of GVHD have substantially reduced the morbidity and mortality of HLA-haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT). However the main reason of mortality after haplo-HSCT in this group of patients is recurrence of the primary disease. Aim: Evaluate diff erent post transplant strategy in patients with unfavorable acute leukemias after haplo-HSCT. Methods: Fifty seven patients (range from 1-56 y.o.) with unfavorable acute leukemias were included in the study. ALL-29pts, AML-25pts, acute biphenotype leukemia-3pts. The RIC regimen based on Flu received 34 pts, MAC based on GIAC protocol*-24 pts. G-CSF-primed BM was used as a graft source. Median CD34+ cell were for children 10,9x10 6 /kg b.w., for adults 4,78x10 6 /kg b.w. Prophylaxis of aGVHD: CsA-based -36 pts, Tacro-based -21 pts. Children and adults with engraftment survived > 90 days from haplo-HSCT without signs of severe aGVHD or infection complications were evaluated for post transplant strategy. Post transplant therapy received 19 pts (maintenance-6MP+MTX 2pts, immunoadoptive chemotherapy-RIST 5pts, DLI 12pts). Results: One-year and two-year overall survival (OS) was higher in patients who received post transplant therapy compared patients without post transplant treatment 73,7% vs 23,7% and 47,4% vs 13,2% respectively (p=0,001). In multivariate analyses predicted cumulative incidence for bone marrow relapse was 8% and 92% respectively (95% CI, 0,62-1, p=0,001). Conclusions: Haplo-HSCT is eff ective therapy for achievement remission in patients with unfavorable acute leukemia. Because of lack of treatment due to relapse which is the main reason of mortality it's necessary to use post transplant treatment for patients with unfavorable acute leukemia after haplo-HSCT. It's necessary to further investigation for study optimal types post transplant therapy.",

Malladi (5) , S. Paneesha (6) , R. Pawson (7), M. Quinn (8), K. Raj (9), D. Richardson (10), S. Robinson (11), N. Russell (12) , J. Snowden (13), A. Sureda (14) , E. Tholouli (15) Background: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is often used, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, to mobilise peripheral blood (PB) stem cells (PBSCs) from the bone marrow for use in stem cell transplantation. Despite established mobilisation strategies, many patients fail to mobilise suffi cient PBSCs to proceed to transplant. Plerixafor has been shown to increase the number of CD34+ cells in PB and can be used to salvage absolute or probable mobilisation failures in patients who mobilise poorly. While there is evidence to support use in poor mobilisers, there is no consensus on the most appropriate and cost-eff ective way to use plerixafor. Actions and Objectives: Working Group meetings were held with representatives from around the UK, to facilitate discussion on the use of plerixafor in bone marrow transplantation. The meetings aimed to review data and gain consensus on the most suitable method to identify poor mobilisers who should receive plerixafor. Results: The Working Group agreed that 15-20% of patients primed with G-CSF or G-CSF plus chemotherapy fail to mobilise suffi cient CD34+ cells, necessitating repeated mobilisation attempts, increased resource utilisation and a delayed time to transplant. Patients who fail mobilisation generally go on to receive plerixafor. Pre-emptive use of plerixafor in patients who are predicted to fail mobilisation can lead to fi nancial and effi ciency savings (vs requiring a patient to fail mobilisation and restart the process prior to plerixafor) so it is important to defi ne criteria to identify predicted poor mobilisers prior to failure. A patient is eligible for pre-emptive rescue with plerixafor when an established mobilisation protocol has been followed and on the predicted day of mobilisation the patient has a PB CD34+ count below 15/ \u03bc L and a white cell count of at least 4x10 9 /L. This is not anticipated to increase the amount of plerixafor use as the same patients who would go on to fail mobilisation will simply receive plerixafor earlier in their treatment. Conclusion: The use of plerixafor to rescue absolute or probable mobilisation failures can improve resource utilisation and patient experience but an evidence-based protocol is needed to defi ne eligible patients. Following further discussion among the Working Group members, a consensus publication should be produced to provide information on plerixafor use and guide the use of plerixafor in absolute and probable mobilisation failures.",

With the availability of plerixafor for stem cell mobilization, most patients are now able to yield stem cells successfully; however, because of its high cost, we have to select patients who might benefi t of its early introduction. Objectives: We identifi ed poor mobilizers in a homogenous cohort of patients with lymphoma and we analysed predictive factors before collection which can help us to determine the plerixafor's best indication. Methods: We report here 174 lymphoma patients who underwent cytapheresis between 2007 and 2011. None patient received plerixafor. 52 (29%) patients having less than 2.106 CD34/kg after the fi rst cytapheresis were considered as failure. Among these, 8 did not have cytapheresis because of peripheral CD34 positive cells count the day before cytapheresis was less than 6/mm 3 . The optimal count of CD34 positive cells allowing a successful mobilization was in our study 30 /mm 3 . Results: We fi rst analysed pre-collection characteristics of the 52 patients who failed to have more than 2.106 CD34/kg in order to predict the HSC mobilisation failure after the fi rst cytapheresis. Unfortunately, as it was described in the literature, only peripheral CD34 count the day before cytapheresis was the strong predictive factor of fi rst cytapheresis failure and any other predictive factors were found. Then, we selected 56 patients from the cohort who had less than 30 CD34/mm 3 the day before the fi rst cytapharesis. Of these patients, 41 (74%) had less than 2.106 CD34/kg after the fi rst cytapheresis. We showed that if the peripheral CD34 count the day before cytapheresis and more interestingly, dynamics of CD34 peripheral cells between the day before and the day of cytapheresis are predictive of a fi rst cytapheresis failure (respectively p=0.0133 and p=0.0108) (fi gure1 and fi gure2) and these factors are independent (p<0.01). Inversely, we can identify among these patients with less than 30 CD34 positive cells day before collection who had successful mobilization and for whom, plerixafor can be avoided. Conclusion: For patients having a count less than 30 CD34/mm 3 the day before the fi rst cytapharesis, dynamics of CD34 peripheral cells between the day before and the day of cytapheresis can select patients for who plerixafor is needed or not.",

Magalon (1) One advantage over registries of unrelated donors (UD) is that Cord blood banks (CBB) may off er more HLA diversity, and thus that suitable Cord Blood Units (CBU) may be identifi ed for a higher proportion of diff erent geographic origin individuals that are candidates for allogeneic transplantation. Thus, one of the goals of the Marseilles CBB that operates within the French network of CBB (RFSP) is to take advantage of the genetically diverse population that lives in the Marseilles metropolitan area due to its location on the Mediterranean shore and a long history of immigration. The Marseilles CBB principally works with one of the Marseilles University birth clinic that cares for an ethically, culturally, sociologically and ethnically diverse population of pregnant women. The aim of our study was to measure to which extent collecting CBU in these conditions would contribute to an increase in HLA diversity. Generic resolution HLA-A, -B, and allelic resolution -DRB1 genotyping was performed by SSO molecular techniques (one\u03bb) on 328 mothers and CBU collected between October 2010 and May 2012, as per standard SOPs. Observed HLA frequencies were compared with those from UD registered in southeastern France. Identifi cation of putative HLA haplotypes CBU was deduced using the maternal HLA typing and data published by Ma\u00efers et al in 2007. Finally, the enrichment of international UD and UCB registries in new HLA phenotypes was assessed: a CBU was considered as enriching the registry when no 6/6 matched CBU or UD was identifi ed in the respective registries. When compared to southeastern France UD characteristics, Marseilles CBUs display an increased frequency of HLA antigens that are frequent in populations of African origin, whereas antigens highly expressed in populations of European origin are proportionally less represented. Two putative HLA haplotypes were identifi ed as \"European\" for 129 CBUs (39,3%) while at least one putative haplotype was not present in Ma\u00efers' database for 142 CBUs (43, 29%) . This latter group enriched the CBUs registry in 93% of cases, and adds new possibilities to identify a suitable unrelated graft with 68% of HLA diversity enrichment in the BMDR. CBU with two putative \"European\" haplotypes contributed more modestly to increasing enrichment: 42% for CBUs registry and 7% for BMDR. We conclude that the activity of the Marseilles CBB increases the genetic diversity of banked CBU. In total, the clinical relevance of such HLA diversity CBU will only be confi rmed by their recruitment.",

Gopcsa (1), P. Remenyi (1) , N. Adamkovich (2) Introduction: Biosimilar version of fi lgrastim (Zarzio \u00ae, Sandoz, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF) is now widely available. Biosimilar G-CSF has very similar features to the original recombinant G-CSF and has comparable quality, safety and eff ectivity profi le. Methods: In our study, 70 patients with diff erent hematological malignancies scheduled to receive biosimilar G-CSF after autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantatation (AHSCT) for facilitating engraftment. Furthermore, 21 additional patients with lymphoid malignancies scheduled to receive biosimilar G-CSF following chemotherapy for autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization were included. Results: Among 70 patients who recieved AHSCT the median age was 56 years, including 42 male and 28 female. The diseases were: 41 multiple myeloma (MM), 19 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 10 Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The conditioning regimen was mainly high-dose Melphalan (N=41) or BEAM (N=21). At time of AHSCT, the median number of reinfused CD34+ cells was 6,33x10 6 /kg (range 2-17,4x10 6 /kg). Median time of > 0,5 G/l absolute neutrophyl leukocyte engraftment were 9 days (range 8-11 days). Median time of 20 G/l platelet engraftment was 10,5 days (range 7-19 days). Twenty one patients with planned AHSCT received chemotherapy followed by administration of biosimilar G-CSF after the last day of chemotherapy for PBSC mobilization. The median age of patients was 55 years, including 13 female and 8 male. According to diagnosis, the diseases were: 11 MM, 8 NHL, 2 HL. Mobilization regimen was following: 10 patients with Cyclophosphamide+biosimilar G-CSF, 11 patients with salvage regimens+biosimilar G-CSF. 19/21 patients were harvested successfully. Median time interval between day 1 of the cycle of mobilization-chemotherapy and fi rst leukapheresis was 12 days (range 9-27). The median yield of CD34+ cells was 3,0x10 6 /kg (range 0,81-24,7 x 10 6 /kg) in one leukapheresis collection. In the autologous PBSC grafts, the median number of the CD34+ cells was 5,83 x 10 6 /kg (range 2,22-24,7 x 10 6 /kg). Conclusion: Biosimilar G-CSF after AHSCT showed as eff ective as our earlier results with G-CSF in the engraftment setting. Biosimilar S115 G-CSF is comparable to G-CSF for kinetics of PBSC mobilzation and yield of stem cells collected.We emphasize that use of biosimilar G-CSF is eff ective in PBSC mobilization and facilitating engraftment after AHSCT as well.",

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with or without chemotherapy is the most commonly used mobilization treatment. The target CD34+ harvest for a single transplant is 4 x 10 6 /Kg, but current mobilization regimens yield inadequate CD34+ cell doses in 5-40% of pts (To L. Bik et al., Blood 2011) . Despite known prognostic factors negatively aff ecting successful stem cell collection (i.e. age, underlying disease, previous alkylating therapy, prior irradiation), predicting poor mobilization is current challenge. Objectives: To defi ne predictive parameters of inadequate stem cell mobilization. Material and Methods: A total of 438 mobilization procedures (170 MM and 268 lymphoma pts) performed at our institution in the last 17 years were retrospectively analyzed. The following parameters were considered: CD34+/ul and CD34+% (ISHAGE protocol) from the fi rst day of WBC\u22651x10 3 /ul (day 1) until procedure end or failure. The overall CD34+ yield for each collection was calculated as the sum of all the apheresis. Less than 2x10 6 CD34+/Kg was considered a collection failure. Linear regression (R test) for correlations, Mann-Whitney test for diff erences between medians and ROC curve analysis for identifi cation of cut-off levels were used. Overall 438 procedures were done: 69 (16%) failed, while 78% reached the target of CD34+/kg>4x10 6 . There was a linear correlation between CD34+ harvest and levels of both CD34+/ul (R 0,58, p<0,0001) and CD34+% at day 1 (R 0,65, p<0,0001), with lower median levels of CD34+/ul and CD34+% in patients who failed mobilization (4 vs 42/ul and 0,06 vs 0,83%, respectively, p<0,0001). Ninety-eight percent of pts with CD34+/ul>20 at day 1 harvested more than 4x10 6 CD34+/kg. For pts with CD34+/ul<20 at day 1, CD34+%>0.5 predicted an adequate mobilization in 97% of the cases and CD43 less than 0.05% an inadequate mobilization in more than 80% of the cases. For CD34+/ul<20 and CD34+%<0,1 at day 2, NPV was 88%. Conclusions: Our results indicate that CD34+/ul<20 and CD34%<0,05% at day 1 are predictive of failure. When CD34+/ ul<20 and CD34+%<0,1 at day 2, the use of alternative strategies (i.e. plerixafor) could represent a way to actively mobilize in an otherwise diffi cult setting.",

Aoiz, E. Olavarria Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Pamplona, ES) The role of Plerixafor in routine peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) mobilization in Myeloma or Lymphoma patients remains to be established. In our institution we have developed a mobilization guideline (The Pamplona Protocol) to assess the safety and effi cacy of Plerixafor + G-CSF in patients predicted to be poor mobilizers (PM). The Pamplona protocol classifi es patients according to PM risk factors including: a) previous mobilization failure; b) advanced disease; c) prior extensive radiotherapy; d) prior Hyper-CVAD, Fludarabine, Lenalidomide or alkylating agents; e) extensive BM involvement; f ) >2 lines of chemotherapy; and g) age > 65. Patients with \u22653 risk factors classify as PM and a PB CD34+ cell count is taken on day 4 of mobilization. All other patients have a CD34+ cell count on day 5 immediately before the apheresis procedure. Plerixafor is administered at 6pm subcutaneously (0.24 mg/Kg) to: a) patients with a circulating CD34+ cell count < 10/uL (on either day 4 or 5) and b) patients with a fi rst apheresis yield < 1.0 x 10 6 CD34+/kg. G-CSF continues at the same dose (5-10 ug/Kg) and an apheresis is scheduled for the following morning. Since October 2009, a total of 146 patients were managed according to the Pamplona Protocol. 11 out of the 13 patients (85%) who were classifi ed as PM before mobilization (9%) had a circulating CD34+ cell count < 10/uL on day 4 and received Plerixafor as planned, demonstrating the high positive predictive value of the protocol. In addition, 9 patients (6%) failed to mobilize on day 5 despite having a median of 0.77 risk factors and also received Plerixafor. The diagnosis for the 20 patients that received Plerixafor was MM (n= 7), NHL (n=11), HL and Amyloidosis (n=1 each). We observed a median of 3 fold increase in the number of CD34 circulating cells. The median CD34+ cell dose harvested was 2.86 x 10 6 /Kg (range 0.32-5.69). There were no diff erences between the CD34+ cell dose in patients receiving Plerixafor on day 4 (median 2.6 x 10 6 /Kg) and day 5 (median 3.1 x 10 6 /Kg). The median number of apheresis was 1 (1) (2) (3) . Only one patient failed to mobilize suffi cient CD34+ cells. G-CSF and Plerixafor treatment was well tolerated. Adverse events were grade 1 in severity and were mostly gastrointestinal. The Pamplona Protocol was able to predict PM before G-CSF administration allowing for early Plerixafor administration. Despite a 13.7% of PM in our series, 145/146 (99%) patients were able to harvest suffi cient CD34+ cells for autologous SCT.",

M\u00fcller, J. Chemnitz, S. Theurich, N. Skoetz, C. Scheid, M. von-Bergwelt-Baildon University Hospital Cologne (Cologne, DE) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an established treatment option for haematological malignancies. In the last two decades peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) predominantly replaced bone marrow (BM) as stem cell source due to faster engraftment and immune reconstitution as well as practicability issues. As transplant indications and conditioning regimens have changed, it is still under debate whether the choice of the stem cell source may have impact on the transplant outcome. Objectives: To assess the effect of BM versus PBSC transplantation in haematological malignancies with regard to overall survival, incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM), disease free survival (DFS), incidence of GvHD and time to engraftment. Search methods/ Selction criteria: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1948 to present), trials registries and conference proceedings. The search was conducted in 10/2011 (update 11/2012) for randomised controlled trials comparing BM and PBSC transplantation in haematological malignancies. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and analysed the data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Results: In this meta-analysis we included eight randomised controlled trials involving a total of 995 participants. The primary outcome overall survival was not signifi cantly diff erent between the study groups (HR 1.21 Conclusion: Overall and disease-free survival as well as NRM are not aff ected by the stem cell source although there was significantly more chronic GvHD with PBSC used.

Hunter, S. Gribbin, S. Ward University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust (Leicester, GB) There is increasing use of Plerixafor, a novel CXCR4 inhibitor in mobilizing Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) particularly in patients who failed with conventional methods. The safety and preliminary effi cacy of Plerixafor in combination with chemotherapy and G-CSF has been established. (1) There are many known factors, which infl uence poor mobilisation including bone marrow disease, multiple treatments, age and certain chemotherapy. (2) There is some data to suggest Plerixafor delays platelet engraftment. We are authorized to use Plerixafor only in failed harvests, as per our local guidelines. We have performed retrospective analysis of patients who underwent PBSC collections from July 2009 to April 2012. We specifi cally analysed data for reviewing neutrophil and platelet engraftment times. We also examined characteristics of the Plerixafor group in terms of risk factors for failed mobilisation. Out of 134 autografts, 113 received conventional mobilisation and 21 Plerixafor mobilisations (15% of total autografts) and Only one patient failed to harvest with Plerixafor. Neutrophil engraftment is established when the neutrophil count reaches 0.5x 109/l, Platelet engraftment is achieved with a platelet count of 50 x 109/l and above. Neutrophil engraftment time for Plerixafor is comparable to the non Plerixafor group (median time to engraftment is 16 days in both groups), 75% of patients have shown neutrophil engraftment within 20 days in both groups. Fifty fi ve percent of patients had platelet engraftment in the non Plerixafor group compared to forty six percent in the Plerixafor group with in thirty-day period. The median platelet engraftment was 33 days in the Plerixafor group compared to 37 days in the non Plerixafor group. There were no reported side eff ects noted in Plerixafor group. We specifi cally looked at the Myeloma group who required Plerixafor and analyzed known parameters to look for the cause of failed mobilisation. Out of twenty-one there were only two patients with multiple treatments and only one patient in the cohort had cytopaenia. There was no documented evidence of sepsis and none had prior exposure of Lenolidamide or Melphalan. Not all patients had a bone marrow aspirate prior to harvest or at the end of treatment, hence we could not correlate marrow hypoplasia with failed mobilisation. The striking parameters were patients with extensive disease at presentation and with skeletal disease and Plasmacytoma seems to correlate with poor mobilization. Sixty four percent of plerixafor group had extensive skeletal disease compared to forty percent in non plerixafor mobilised group. Risk adapted strategies for pre-emptive (3), salvage use or upfront use of Plerixafor as a fi rst line PBSC mobiliser for high risk patients like high tumour burden, skeletal disease, multiple treatments, patients with poor marrow reserve will prevent delays and unnecessary anxiety to patients.

Results: Between 2004 and 2006, there were 10,685 deliveries with intention of cord blood donation to our Institute. There were 6,280 donations excluded and the number of fi nal eligible CB units was 4405 during this 3-years period. Overall exclusion rates were 93. 1%, 48.4% and 54.1% in 2004, 2005 and 2006 , respectively. We excluded 612 pregnant women before delivery, 133 CB units during delivery, 80 units before processing, 5,010 units during processing and 421 units after freezing. There were 24 CB units with unknown reason of ineligibility. Totally, 41.2% of the CB units were considered eligible and entered the search registry. Overall, low CB weight and low cell count were the fi rst 2 leading causes of exclusion (48.6% and 30.9%, respectively). The incidences of artificial error, holiday/transportation problem, low weight and infant problems decreased year by year. Conclusion: The exclusion rate was high at the beginning in our study as was in previous literatures. Effi cient work is necessary to decrease the expenditure of a public CB bank. Understanding the exclusion reason of CB may help in improving the effi ciency of CB banking programs in the future.",

To assess plerixafor use in poor mobilizers to survey the incidence of patients with poor mobilization and to evaluate the eff ectiveness of remobilization strategy, and \"pre-emptive use\". Methods: In our retrospective analysis (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) , 86 patients' mobilization procedure was analyzed, 45 female, 41 male with median age of 57 years (range: 19-69 years). 53 myeloma multiplex; 19 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 14 Hodgkin lymphoma patients. 11 patients (13%) required plerixafor for the successful completion [P524] S119 of mobilization. Remobilization group (group 1) and a pre-emptive group (group 2) were created. Group 1 contained 5 patients, who had previously one or more unsuccessful mobilization attempts. Group 2 contained 6 patients, who had never been mobilized before in which 3 patients were defi ned as predicted poor mobilizers and 3 patients were diffi cult to mobilize due to poor stem cell mobilization kinetics. The target yield was > 4 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg body weight. All patients received plerixafor plus G-CSF with or without chemotherapy. Plerixafor was administered depending on the kinetics of CD34+ cells and white blood cell recovery. Results: In group 1 the median of circulating CD34+ cells after plerixafor administration was 36 cell/microl (range: 9-150) versus group 2 in which 45 cell/microl (range: 25-63) could be observed. The median of collected CD34+/kg cells was 7.11x10 6 /kg (range: 4.38 -13.2) in group 1, whereas in group 2 the median was 5.02x10 6 / kg (range: 3.08-6.34). Median apheresis number was 4 (range: [1] [2] [3] [4] in group 1,in group 2 the median was 3 (range: [2] [3] [4] . Two patients in group 1 required 2 remobilization. The average plerixafor dose in group1 was 2.5 vials, in group 2 it was 1.66 vials by which the required target cell number could be achieved. From 11 patients 9 underwent stem cell transplantation and were engrafted. Conclusions: All detailed patients achieved the required target cell number for ASCT. Plerixafor could be combined with G-CSF only or chemomobilization strategy. Our experience confi rmed the view that pre-emptive administration of plerixafor may rescue the mobilization process, and enable the patient to proceed to ASCT without delay. The kinetics of hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy may allow for early (just in time) intervention with plerixafor and may help reduce the risk of the mobilization failure.",

Methods: A total of 17 Amicus (SW 4.3) autologous stem cell collections were compared with 17 Spectra procedures matched from the database (N=2427) for similar patient characteristics, mobilization regimen, blood counts and processed volumes. Data was also compared with previously performed procedures on Com.Tec and Optia. The Amicus Separator (software V.4.3) was set up with: 12:1 WB: ACD-A ratio, number of cycles (10 cycles \u00b1 3), blood volume per cycle (1000ml if WBC > 35/\u03bcl or 1400ml if WBC < 35/\u03bcl), MNC off set (2.3 ml to 1.5 ml) and RBC off set (6.0 ml). The performance was evaluated based on 1) CD 34+ effi ciency; 2) CD34+ yield; 3) Procedure time; 4) Patient PLT depletion; 5) Overall cell content of the collected product; 6) Adverse events. Results: CD34+ collection effi ciency (N=16) was 44.4\u00b1 14.8% for Amicus vs 50.2 \u00b1 20.5% for Spectra. CD34+ yield (N=17) was 6.3 \u00b1 11.0 x 10E6 /kg for Amicus vs 4.4 \u00b1 4.7 x 10E6 /kg for Spectra. Collection time (N=17) was 295 \u00b1 42 min for Amicus and 248 \u00b1 31 min for Spectra. Harvested platelets (N=16) were 4.8 \u00b1 1.2 % for Amicus vs 26.5 \u00b1 18.7 % for Spectra corresponding to a patient platelet loss of respectively 11.4 \u00b1 11.0% (N=17) vs 40.8 \u00b1 21.1% (N=15). The overall cell content for Amicus and Spectra is shown in graph 1. The key performance indicators for the four tested apheresis platforms are presented in table 1. Adverse events with Amicus were mild. No citrate related reactions were observed. Conclusion: CD34+ collection effi ciency with Amicus was satisfactory and comparable to Spectra with signifi cantly lower platelet depletion from the patient. Yield and purity of the collected product are predictable. Performance of the four tested separators is overall comparable with the exception of the lower platelet loss with Amicus. The full automated control of the cell separation and collection frees up operators from manual monitoring, while he still have the possibility to adjust parameters during the procedure.",

Vyniou, P. Panayiotidis, M.-C. Kyrtsonis, P. Tsaftaridis, J. Meletis, M. Angelopoulou National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Athens, GR) Plerixafor is a CXCR4 inhibitor that disrupts the adhesion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to bone marrow stroma resulting in the mobilization of HSC to peripheral blood. It is indicated in combination with G-CSF in poor mobilizers. Using Plerixafor, patients in whom HSC collection has failed succeed in collecting suffi cient numbers of CD34+ HSC and may undergo subsequent autologous [P526] S120 stem cell transplantation. Aim: To evaluate the preemptive use of plerixafor in lymphoma and myeloma patients undergoing HSC collection. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all patients from a single Hematology Unit in whom plerixafor was used preemptively: Patients were mobilized with chemotherapy or G-CSF and were not intended to receive plerixafor, unless absolute peripheral blood CD34 counts at the expected peak day were either below <20/\u03bcL or suboptimal for the desired HSC target. Results: Rescue plerixafor was used in 32 patients and 38 mobilization attempts; 6 patients underwent 2 mobilization procedures. Their median age at mobilization was 54 years, there were 18 females and 14 males, 12 had multiple myeloma, 1 Hodgkin and 19 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 22 had received 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimens, whereas 16 patients \u22653 and 84% were chemosensitive. Mobilizing regimens included platinum-based chemotherapy in 6 (16%), ifosfamide-based in 6 (16%), cyclophosphamide in 13 (34%) and G-CSF in 13 (34%). Plerixafor was administered once, twice or thrice in 20, 11 and 7 cases respectively. One collection was performed in 16 patients, two in 14 and 3 in 8 patients. The median absolute CD34 counts after plerixafor (CD34-post) were signifi cantly higher compared to those before Plerixafor (CD34pre), i.e. 37.5/\u03bcL (4-208) vs 19.2/\u03bcL (2.6-67) , respectively, p<0.001. The median total number of CD34+cells/kg collected was 4.025 x 106/kg (0.49-16.77) and the median number of CD34+cells/kg per collection was 2.415 x 106/kg. Univariate prognostic factor analysis is shown in the table. Conclusion: Preemptive use of plerixafor according to circulating absolute CD34 counts at the expected days of peak results in suffi cient HSC collections, and might prove more cost-eff ective.",

An accurate evaluation of all CB characteristics and maternal medical history ensures that only those units suitable for clinical use according to FACT-Netcord standards are banked. This leads to discard a huge amount of collected CB units. Recently the Milano CB Bank launched the idea to produce platelet gel (PG) from CB not eligible for unrelated transplantation and is coordinating a national project for applying CBPG to wounds repair in diabetic patients. At the Pavia CB Bank we modifi ed the protocol by Mazzucco at al. to verify its feasibility in producing CBPG in our setting. Only CB units with total nucleated cells <1x10 9 and platelet >200 x10 6 /ml were enrolled in this study. CB was collected, with mother's informed consent, in collection kit containing 22 ml CPDA (JMS) and was processed within 48 hours. After addition of 10 ml ACD and saline to a fi nal volume of 150 ml, CBPG was obtained with a three-step procedure: fi rst, a soft spin centrifugation (180 g x 10 min) to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP); second, an additional soft spin centrifugation (100g x 10min) to remove leukocytes as much as possible; third, an high-spin centrifugation (1000g x 10min) to pellet the platelets. Then platelet concentrate (PC) was resuspended in 8 ml of platelet poor plasma (PPP) and frozen at -80\u00b0C. A 6 mL plastic bag was used to ensure storage and transport conditions appropriate for clinical purposes (SIAD Healthcare). After thawing, CB-PCs were pooled according to ABO compatibility to reach 1.5-2 x10 9 platelets/ml and batroxobin (Plateltex-Act \u00ae) was added according to the manufacturer instructions. 25 CB units with a mean platelet concentration of 255 x10 6 /ml were processed to obtain PCs with a mean platelet content of 835 x10 6 /ml and 35% of platelet recovery on average. Leukocyte contamination was always < 1 x 10 6 . Sterility testing performed at the end of processing resulted negative in all CB-PCs except of one. The addiction of batroxobin to pooled CB-PCs was able to obtain gelation demonstrating that this adapted protocol is feasible in producing CBPG in our hands. In future this strategy will rescue unsuitable CB to a new diff erent clinical use and reduce the discard rate in CB Banks. This will favorably impact on both donor's mothers' and collection site personnel's expectations: to be helpful for patients.",

Ostuni, M.R. Morciano, A. Mele, M. Fina, D. Carlino, G. Greco, S. Sibilla, R. De Francesco, B. Rossini, C. Derisi, V. Pavone Hospital G Panico (Tricase, IT) Introduction: Biosimilar granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been recently approved for mobilization of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC). Various recent reports describe a comparable effi cacy as original G-CSF with a signifi cant reduction of costs. In this study we assessed safety and effi cacy of Zarzio (Zarzio \u00ae Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) in order to mobilize PBSC in patients (pts) with hematological malignancies and to ensure an optimal engrafment capability. Methods: From June 2011 to December 2012, a cohort of 44 pts was studied. All pts received disease specifi c chemotherapy plus Zarzio at a dose of 5\u03bcg/kg body weight twice daily. Programmed CD34+ cells target dose was 4x10 6 /kg for pts with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin Lymphomas, Leukemia and 6x10 6 /kg for Multiple Myeloma. Plerixafor was used in predicted poor mobilizer pts. Amicus Fenwal separator was used in all leukapheresis procedures. Results: Patients' demographic characteristics are listed in table 1. Median time of Zarzio administration was 8.2 days; 38 pts (86%) reached the target dose to perform autologous stem cell transplantation with an average number of apheresis of 1.45. Collection data are in table 2. Poor mobilization was documented in 13 pts (29%), mainly of them received more than 3 chemotherapy regimens previously. Six pts failed mobilization, two of them even after the administration of Plerixafor. Among pts who have mobilized, 21 (55.3%) were submitted to high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous (18) or allogenic (3) PBSC infusion. Median of CD34x10 6 /kg infuse and viability were 4.3 x10 6 /kg (0.8-6.2) and 75. 3% (51.4-88.2) , respectively. Engraftment occurred in all pts. The median time to absolute nucleated cells >500 and to platelets >20000 was 12 days (10-23) and 14 (10-33) after CD34+ infusion, respectively. Conclusion: Biosimilar G-CSF, such as Zarzio, may represent an eff ective strategy for PBSC mobilization and collection after chemotherapy in terms of CD34+ cell dose and timing of collection. A study of comparison will be necessary to establish advantages in terms of cost.",

            "text": "Background: Autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) is an established treatment for selected patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma. However 15-30% of patients fail mobilisation making them ineligible for HPCT. Plerixafor is a selective reversible CXCR4 antagonist which, when used in combination with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), results in successful mobilisation in 60-85% of patients who previously failed mobilisation. Rationale: Plerixafor was approved for use in Wales for lymphoma and myeloma patients who failed mobilisation, precluding use in patients predicted to fail mobilisation. The ability to rescue a failed mobilisation attempt would minimise the under-utilisation of apheresis slots and prevent the need to re-book patients for harvest making the collection programme more effi cient and potentially reducing cost. Methods: To comply with use only in failed mobilisers, plerixafor rescue was limited to patients whose peripheral blood (PB) CD34 count after four consecutive days of G-CSF at a dose of 10 mcg/ kg (without prior chemotherapy) was insuffi cient to proceed to apheresis. These patients were given a fi fth dose of G-CSF followed by plerixafor 240 mcg/kg at 2200 h. On day 6 a further dose of G-CSF was given at 0800h followed by apheresis. Further plerixafor and G-CSF were given as required up to a maximum of 4 plerixafor doses. Patients failing mobilisation following G-CSF and chemotherapy were re-mobilised with the standard plerixafor protocol consisting of G-CSF 10 mcg/kg days 1-4, plerixafor 240 mcg/kg at 2200 h on d4 followed by G-CSF on d5 at 0800h followed by apheresis. Up to 4 doses of plerixafor were allowed. Results: Between May 2011 and October 2012, 120 collections were performed using G-CSF with (n = 70) or without (n = 50) prior chemotherapy. G-CSF alone was limited to myeloma patients attaining at least a very good partial response (VGPR). All other patients were mobilised with cyclophosphamide (myeloma patients without VGPR)or salvage chemotherapy (lymphoma patients) + G-CSF (chemo-G). Priming failure was higher with G-CSF (13/50 = 26%) than with chemo-G (4/70 = 6%) and with cyclophosphamide (25%) than salvage chemotherapy (4%). Nine of 11(82%) plerixafor rescue attempts were successful compared with 13/15 (87%) standard plerixafor for an overall plerixafor success rate of 22/26 (85%). Conclusion: Plerixafor rescue used after G-CSF mobilisation failure is as eff ective as re-mobilisation and prevents wastage of apheresis slots. van der Veeken, E.H.C.M. R\u00f6mers, A. Kelder, F. Kessler, A. Dr\u00e4ger, J.J.W.M. Janssen, G.J. Schuurhuis VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, NL) Introduction: In an allogeneic MUD transplantation, a transplant centre requires a minimum number of CD34 positive cells. If not reached the time to engraftment, the critical clinical care period for the patient and the duration of hospital stay may be aff ected. Sometimes the number of CD34+ cells determined by the collection centre is diff erent from that determined by the transplant centre. The most critical situation emerges when, according to the collection centre, the minimum number of CD34+ cells was harvested while according to the transplant centre the required minimum number has not been reached. These discrepancies were also seen in the grafts with large CD34+ amounts. We investigated whether these discrepancies are related to the time period between collection and transplantation or the white blood cell (WBC) concentration of the graft. Method: In a retrospective analysis in 132 MUD transplantations performed from September 2008 until October 2012, the total number of CD34+ in the graft was determined both by the collection centre and the transplant centre. From these data, the recovery of CD34+ cells was determined and the two factors of possible infl uence were assessed. Results: In the 132 MUD transplantations, the CD34 yield measured in the transplant centre was median of 97% (range 56 to 147%) of values in collection centre. The transplant centre found 24 cases that did not contain the requested minimal amount of CD34+ cells. A graft failure occurred in 5 of these 24 transplantations (21%) compared to only 9 of 108 other transplants (8%). In 9/24 cases only the collection centre reported enough CD34 yield, but these contained 2/5 graft failures. In transplants with a time period between collection and transplantation less than 40 hrs the median CD34 recovery was 93% (78%-129%); with a time period > 40 hrs 98% (56%-147)(no signifi cant: p=0.60). Regression analysis shows no correlation between the WBC concentration and the CD34 recovery; r 2 =0.012. When divided in 3 groups (WBC in millions per ml), ie <200, in between 200 and 300 and >300, CD34 recoveries were median 94% (62%-129%), 97% (63%-130%) and 97% (56%-147%). Conclusion: In roughly 10% of the transplants, graft failure was observed; this occurred in grafts with too low CD34 content according to both collection centre and transplant centre but also according to transplant centre alone. Discrepancies between collection and transplant centre CD34+ are not related to time period between collection and transplantation or WBC concentration.",

Rowe (2) (1)University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) ; (2) New York University School of Medicine (New York, US) Because technical support of the Cobe \u00ae Spectra Apheresis System after 2014 is uncertain, we therefore compared the eff ectiveness of two alternative blood cell separators, i.e. the Spectra Optia \u00ae Apheresis System and the Amicus \u00ae Separator. After mobilization using G-CSF alone or G-CSF plus Plerixafor, 36 PBSC components were collected with each machine from patients and healthy donors, with 15 persons undergoing procedures with both machines. We tried to adjust the process time to 4 h (Amicus: 250 \u00b115 min, Optia 244 \u00b1 15 min, mean \u00b1 standard deviation), irrespective of the processed blood volumes. As a consequence the volumes diff ered signifi cantly (P = 0.006, two-tailed Mann-Whitney-U-test): 10.9 \u00b1 1.9 L for the Amicus and 9.8 \u00b1 1.6 L for the Optia. But the volumes of the anticoagulant ACD-A used (942 \u00b1 166 ml for the Amicus and 924 \u00b1 138 ml for the Optia, respectively) did not diff er significantly. The numbers of collected CD34+ cells, CD34+ collection effi ciencies, and CD34+ collection rates amounted to 386 \u00b1 413 x 10 6 , 64.6 \u00b114.6%, 1.55 \u00b11.65 x 10 6 /min (Amicus) and 378 \u00b1 404 x 10 6 , 71.1 \u00b1 12.0%, 1.56 \u00b11.69 /min (Optia), respectively. However, these diff erences were not signifi cant (P > 0.05). The components collected with the Amicus contained 21.3 \u00b1 8.5 x 10 9 mononuclear cells compared with 18.4 \u00b1 8.7 x 10 9 , for the Optia, however, this diff erence was not signifi cant as well. Whereas the Optia products showed a slightly higher contamination with granulocytes (11.0 \u00b1 6,9 x 10 9 ) vs. 9.2 \u00b1 4.8 for the Amicus, this diff erence was not signifi cant. Product hematocrits due to contaminating red cells were twice as high for the Amicus (0.029 \u00b1 0.016 l/l) in comparison to the Optia (0.013 \u00b1 0.019 l/l), and this was a signifi cant diff erence (P < 0.0001). On the other hand, the number of platelets contained in the Optia products was almost 4 times higher than in the case of the Amicus products (2.6 \u00b1 1.5 x 10 11 vs. 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 x 10 11 , P < 0.0001 ). We observed typical moderate citrate related reactions (perioral discomfort, paresthesia, nausea) in 4 out of the 72 runs, all of them could be stopped by either oral or intravenous Ca 2+ administration. In conclusion, both blood cell separators showed a good performance for peripheral blood stem cell collections in patients and donors and are suitable to replace the Cobe \u00ae Spectra Apheresis System.",

Philippe (2) , R. Mallick (1), S. Smith (2) , D. Allan (1) (1)University of Ottawa (Ottawa, CA); (2)Canadian Blood Services (Ottawa, CA) Background: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is used increasingly as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation. Thresholds of pre-storage cell numbers associated with timely engraftment are well established yet availability of adequate donor units continues to be lacking for many patients and especially adults. We postulate that even modest improvements in the yield of cells following storage and thawing will allow more patients to fi nd suitable units with suffi cient cell numbers and proceed to transplant. Methods: We utilized 21 consecutive anonymous umbilical cord blood searches performed by Canadian Blood Services to simulate the impact of improved cell yield. Published criteria were used for selecting UCB units from the anonymized searches based on total nucleated cells (TNC) per kg recipient weight and in accordance with the degree of HLA matching. The number of donors available per patient was calculated based on hypothetical recipient weight of 50 kg, 70 kg and 90 kg. The analysis was repeated by increasing the fraction of cells surviving storage and thawing by 10%, 20% and 30%. Results: Increasing the percentage of cells that survive storage by 30% lowered the TNC threshold used to select UCB units and demonstrated an increase in UCB units available for patients weighing 50 (p=0.011), 70, (p=0.014) and 90 kg (p=0.003), controlling for diff erences in HLA compatibility using a mixed eff ects analysis. Moreover, if recipients were 90 kg, 12 out of 21 patients had access to at least one UCB unit that met standard criteria, and this increased to 19 out of 21 patients (p=0.035) when the fraction of cells surviving storage and thawing increased by 30%. Conclusion: We conclude that a modest increase in the yield of cells in banked UCB units can signifi cantly increase donor options for adult patients undergoing HSCT. Improved processing, cryopreservation and storage techniques could allow substantially more patients to undergo HSCT using UCB.",

Rajasuriar, A.N. Kori, X. Sim, K.M. Chang Hospital Ampang (Ampang, MY) Introduction: Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvesting and storage incur signifi cant cost and resources. For the last thirteen years since we started our autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) service, the cases have been increased tremendously. We implemented mobilizing patients based on peripheral blood CD34 count (PB-CD34) cutoff points at least 10/uL as one of our optimization of PBSC collection measures since June 2011. Method and results: We compared the outcome of PBSC collection in 18 months before (pre) and after (post) the implementation of mobilizing patients based on PB-CD34 cutoff points at least 10/uL. A total of 499 patients (215 pre and 284 post implementation) have been subjected for PBSC mobilization using G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy mainly consists of high dose cyclophosphamide or etoposide since November 2009. Only 394 patients (78.96%) (182 pre and 212 post implementation) managed to undergo apheresis. Majority were lymphoma patients (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 189; 47.97% and Hodgkin's disease (HD) 92; 23.35%), followed by multiple myeloma (MM) 70; 17.77% and acute leukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 36; 9.14% and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 7; 1.78%). There was no statistic difference in disease, age and gender distribution in between both groups. Among the 182 patients who underwent apheresis in pre implementation cohort, only 133 patients (73.07%) were successfully mobilized >2x10 6 /kg of CD34 as compared to 195 patients (91.98%) among the 212 patients in post implementation cohort. 96 cases were mobilized with PB-CD34 below 10/uL among pre implementation cohort as compared to 21 cases in post implementation cohort retrospectively. Furthermore, there were more patients underwent inappropriate PBSC collection (97.87% versus 40%) among the pre implementation cohort when mobilized with PB-CD34 below 10/uL. By using one step measure of deciding PBSC mobilization based on PB-CD34 cutoff points at least 10/uL, we have improved the successfulness of PBSC collection more than 18% and reduced the wastage of more than 57%. The cost effectiveness after implementation of this measure will be presented later.",

            "text": "Background: The Amicus Separator (Fenwal) can be used to collect mononuclear cells (MNC). The procedure is automated and doesn't require operator intervention for controlling the separation. This allows limiting the variation of the collection performance. Another benefi t is the low platelet contamination of the MNC product avoiding signifi cant platelet loss in patients. Amicus Separator is also characterized by high MNC collection effi cacy. Mont-Godinne BTC uses both Amicus (Fenwal) and Spectra (Terumo BCT). We report on the comparison of Amicus and Spectra in our institution during one year. Methods: We compared routine procedures performed in 2011: 68 MNC collections with Amicus (SW 3.2) and 36 MNC collections with Spectra (SW 7.2). Amicus settings are adjusted based on the patient's white blood cells (WBC) pre-count. For WBC <25K/\u03bcl, the whole blood (WB) collected per cycle is 1200 ml , the maximum fl ow rate 65 ml/min and the RBC off set 7.0 ml while for WBC >25K/\u03bcl, the WB per cycle is 800-1000 ml, the maximum fl ow rate 80 ml/min and the RBC off set 8.0 ml. MNC off set is 2.3 ml and MNC set point 0.6 in both cases. The evaluated parameters were WBC yield, CD 34+ yield, CD34+ collection effi cacy and platelet depletion. The CD34+ collection effi cacy is defi ned as CD34+ yield / ((pre + post /2) * WB processed). The adverse reactions due to citrate intolerance were recorded We also studied a subset of 13 patients collected on both Amicus and Spectra on two consecutive days Results: Total blood volume processed and whole blood fl ow rate were signifi cantly higher on SPECTRA. Platelet depletion was signifi cantly lower on AMICUS (22 \u00b1 20% vs 38 \u00b1 13%) . No signifi cant diff erences were observed for WBC yield (176 \u00b1 72.108 vs 204 \u00b1 116.108), CD34 yield (252 \u00b1 212.106 vs 208 \u00b1 140.106), CD34 collection effi cacy (63 \u00b1 14% vs 59 \u00b1 15%) or CD34 yield per minute of collection (1.04 \u00b1 0.97.106/min vs 1,11 \u00b1 0,82.106/min). The number of cases of citrate intolerance was 17 (25%) for Amicus and 7 (19%) for Spectra. 6 procedures (8.8%) required IV calcium for Amicus and 4 (11.1%) for Spectra. No procedure was stopped. Data from the subset of 13 patients collected on both machines will be presented during the fi nal communication. Conclusion: The CD34 + collection effi cacy with Amicus is equivalent to Spectra but platelet depletion in patients is signifi cantly lower. The Spectra procedure is manually controlled. The Amicus MNC procedure is automatically controlled, not requiring significant operator interventions.",

The aim of this study is to present our experience utilizing an intermediate-dose cyclophosphamidebased mobilization regimen in multiple myeloma patients previously treated with Thalidomide and/or its analog Lenalidomide. Material and Method: This is a retrospective study performed at the Department of Medicine/Hematological Malignancy/Stem Cell Transplant Unit at UCLA between 2006 and 2011. All patients underwent a single mobilization regimen that included, Cyclophosphamide 2.5gm/m 2 iv once, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) 10mcg/kg/day sc until collection day 1, and Prednisone 2mg/kg po daily x 5 in all multiple myeloma patients. Minimum dose required to ensure successful and sustained engraftment was 2x10 6 /kg CD34+cells, whereas the optimal dose was 5x10 6 /kg CD34+cells. PBSC harvesting was performed with COBE Spectra processing 2-2.5 total blood volume/per apheresis session. Results: Autologous PBSC transplantation was performed in 103 multiple myeloma patients with high-dose Melphalan. 212 autologous PSBC apheresis procedures were done, with median number of apheresis per patient of 1.0 (range1-12). Median age was 55.7y (range 32. 6-75.1) . 70 patients (68.9%) required just one collection to achieve the requisite number of cells, 15 patients required 2 collections (14.5%), and 14 patients (17.4%) had more than two collection procedures. There was only one patient with fewer than 2x10 6 /kg CD34+cells (0.9%) collected and he underwent bone marrow harvesting. Median CD34+cells collected were 6.7 x10 6 /kg, range (1.4-33.5x10 6 /kg CD34+cells). Median CD34+cells infused were 5.8 x10 6 /kg, range . Most patients achieved neutrophil recovery in 10 days (range 1-18). Conclusion: Despite pre-transplant use of Thalidomide and/or Lenalidomide, combination of G-CSF, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone happened to be an excellent mobilization strategy which permits adequate collection with the majority of patients requiring only one apheresis procedure with mobilization failure in fewer than 1%.",

Sixty-two patients diagnosed with ESRD who had not received dialysis previously, 25 patients with a diagnosis of DM without nephropathy, and 21 healthy volunteers were included in the study. The group diagnosed with ESRD was divided into two groups. First group (DM-CRD) consisted of 28 patients with DM who had developed chronic renal disease (CRD).

Wilson (1) (1)University Hospital of Wales (Cardiff , GB); (2)Singleton Hospital (Swansea, GB) The ability to mobilise adequate number of CD34+ stem cells is a pre-requisite for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Selection of the optimal priming regimen is vital to maximise the CD34+ cell yield. Furthermore, adherence to priming protocols minimises adverse events such as prescribing errors and enhances effi ciency of the service through the use of predicted dates of mobilisation. The stem cell collection (SCC) facility at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) provides aphaeresis services for the South Wales Blood and Marrow Transplant (SWBMT) Programme. A prospective data collection exercise of 124 adult referrals who underwent SCC using pre-defi ned priming protocols from May 2011 to October 2012 inclusive was conducted. The underlying diagnoses were Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) n=48, Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) n=21, Multiple Myeloma (MM) n=53 and Plasmacytoma (PC) n=2. A summary of outcomes is shown in the attached table. Priming failure was defi ned as a predicted CD34+ cell dose of < 0.8 x 10 6 /kg. The dose of cyclophosphamide (cyclo) was at the discretion of the referring clinician (1.5g/m 2 n=3, 3g/m 2 n=15 and 4g/m 2 n=2). Other chemotherapy regimens encompassed a variety of salvage protocols commonly used for HL and NHL, with only miniBEAM resulting in priming failure. The minimum CD34+ cell dose acceptable for ASCT was 2 x 10 6 /kg. With regard to MM, a CD34+ cell dose suffi cient for two transplants was achieved in 46% v 64% of patients receiving G-CSF alone v G-CSF + cyclo. In summary, with the exception of mini-BEAM, G-CSF + chemotherapy successfully mobilised stem cells in a high proportion of lymphoma patients (84%) with a low rate of infectious complications. Although priming failures in MM were lower following G-CSF + cyclo than with G-CSF alone, the high rate of infections resulted in an overall lower rate of successful SCC (61% v 70%). Whether 1.5g/m 2 cyclo will result in lower rates of infection and improved outcomes is the subject of further evaluation.",

Cantonetti (1) (1)Policlinico Tor Vergata (Rome, IT); IT) Background: Plerixafor is a CXCR-4 receptor antagonist capable to mobilize stem cells (SCs) in peripheral blood. Diff erent studies showed that circulating CD34+ cells can be increased by several folds with the use of Plerixafor associated to G-CSF and that this mobilization regimen can be a valid option for myeloma or lymphoma patients defi ned \"poor mobilizer\". It is now not clear if the combination of Plerixafor to G-CSF has a role in viability of stem cells collected from peripheral blood. We report analysis of data relative to viability of CD34+ cells collected after mobilization with Plerixafor and G-CSF in two diff erent patients. Methods: Two patients (one Multiple Myeloma and one Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) both underwent to a second harvest of CD34+ cells after mobilization with Plerixafor plus G-CSF as a consequence of low rate of viability observed at the moment of cryopreservation of the fi rst harvest collected after mobilization with chemotherapy plus G-CSF. Patient #1 underwent a fi rst attempt of mobilization with high-dose Cyclophosphamide, resulting in a CD34+ cells/Kg harvest of 4,2 x 10 6 with a viability of only 22,5%. Patient #2 underwent two attempts of mobilization with highdose Cyclophosphamide and high-dose Cytarabine, resulting in two subsequent CD34+ cells/Kg harvests of 7,3 x 10 6 and 4,5 x 10 6 with a viability of only 5% and 45% respectively. In all cases CFU-GM assays confi rm the low percentage of viable cells. Results: In patient 1, after mobilization with Plerixafor 0,24 mg/Kg and G-CSF 10 \u03bcg/Kg/day, we obtain a number of CD34+ cells/Kg of 6 x 10 6 with a higher level of viability (93 and 89% in two different units),CFU-GM 41,5 and 55,5 respectively. In patient 2, after mobilization with Plerixafor 0,24 mg/Kg and G-CSF 10 \u03bcg/Kg/day, we obtain a number of CD34+ cells/Kg of (4,8 x 10 6 ) with a higher level of viability (99 and 83% in two diff erent units),CFU-GM 46 and 34,25 respectively. Conclusions: Our data seem to suggest that combination of Plerixafor to G-CSF determine an increase of CD34+ cells viability rate observed before cryopreservation in patients in which we obtained a low viability rate of CD34+ cells collected after mobilization with chemotherapy and G-CSF. Further studies are necessary to defi ne the cause of reduced viability of SCs before cryopreservation and to confi rm our observation about the mobilization of viable SCs with Plerixafor in these particular conditions.",

Fo\u00e0 Sapienza University (Rome, IT) Objectives: Studies on long-term results in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who underwent an allogeneic hemato poietic stem cell transplant (HCT) have shown very rare relapses even after 10 years. However, long-term molecular assessment of the disease has never been closely evaluated. Aim of this study was to verify whether patients who survive for many years after an HCT, apparently free of leukemia, may have residual leukemia cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis. Patients & Methods: Since January 2010, we performed a single center, prospective evaluation of the persistence of the Bcr/Abl transcript, by qRT-PCR, in 61 patients with CML who underwent a myeloablative HCT from an identical sibling between 1984 and 2001, and surviving in continuous complete hematological remission (CCR) for at least 10 years after transplant. Of these 61 patients, 8 refused to participate in the study and 7 were not traceable. The qRT-PCR analysis was therefore performed on 46 patients. Results: Of the 46 patients analyzed, with a median follow-up from transplant of 17 years (range 12-30) and in CCR for over 10 years, qRT-PCR resulted positive in 6 (13%). A patient with 62 copiesIS, at 23 years after HCT, presented a previously undetected hematological relapse. A patient with 33 copiesIS showed a cytogenetic relapse. Four patients with a median number of copiesIS of 0.3 (range 0.2-0.7), negative cytogenetics for the Ph chromosome and normal blood cell counts were monitored by qRT-PCR every 3 months: molecular evidence of disease persisted in 2 cases, evolved into an hematological relapse in 1 patient and disappeared in the other. Conclusions: Our study shows that residual leukemia stem cells identifi able by qRT-PCR may persist in CML patients long after HCT. It is therefore necessary to indefi nitely monitor allografted CML patients. However, the prognostic signifi cance of residual leukemic cells at low molecular levels and the defi nition of \"low molecular level\" after an allo-SCT remains undefi ned: we observed disappearance of the rearrangement in some patients and the persistence or the evolution into an overt hematological relapse phase in others. The uncertain clinical signifi cance of these molecular fi ndings raises ethical and clinical concerns regarding disclosing adequate information to the patients and in terms of therapeutic decisions. Prospective studies on long-term molecular assessments are required to monitor late relapse patterns and to answer the above-mentioned questions.",

Iori (1) (1)Sapienza University (Rome, IT); (2)\"Tor Vergata\" (Rome, IT) Purpose: For decades allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has been considered the curative approach for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML. In the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), HCT represents a second line treatment, due to the high risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM). Over the years, advances have been made in the care of patients undergoing transplantation. We conducted a study to determine whether these advances have improved the outcome of transplanted CML patients over a prolonged follow-up period. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the overall survival (OS), TRM and haematological relapse among 163 consecutive patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase who received their fi rst HCT at our centre between 1984 and 1990 (group A, 62 patients), between 1991 and 2000 (group B, 75 patients) and between 2001 and 2011 (group C, 26 patients) . Results: At a median follow-up of 7 years (range 1-28years), the 10 year OS for the entire case series was 37%, 60% and 92% for groups A, B and C, respectively (p=0.0005) (Fig. 1 ). The 10 year cumulative incidence of TRM was 30%, 28% and 3% for each group, respectively (p=0.04). Patients in group A, B and C showed a cumulative incidence of haematological relapse of 72%, 27% and 2.7% respectively (p <0.001). Conclusions: We observed a substantial reduction in the hazard of death related to HCT, as well as a reduction in haematological relapse and an increased OS over the years. The reduction in TRM is probably due to advances in the care of patients undergoing transplantation; moreover, the more recent strategy of a close monitoring of minimal residual disease, with a prompt use of TKI or donor lymphocyte infusion strategies have reduced the risk of haematological relapse. These improved transplant policies have translated into a signifi cantly better OS. Nowadays, allogeneic transplantation is therefore a safer therapeutic procedure for CML patients that should be timely employed in TKI resistant patients.",

Nagamura-Inoue (7), The only known curative therapy for primary myelofi brosis (PMF) is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The issues of the choice of stem cell source, the choice of conditioning regimen, and the timing of transplantation are currently under debate. To determine whether a diff erence in stem cell sources aff ects the outcome of HSCT, a retrospective study was conducted using the national registry data on PMF patients who received fi rst allogeneic HSCT in Japan. A total of 83 PMF patients, with a median age of 53 years (range, 21-79 years), were treated with a variety of preconditioning regimens and prophylaxis for GVHD. Stem cell sources were related bone marrow (BM) in 19 patients, related peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in 25 patients, unrelated BM in 28 patients, and unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) in 11 patients. This study included the most UCB transplantation among the previous reports. Neutrophil recovery on day 60 occurred in 92% of related BM, 92% of related PBSC, 79% of unrelated BM, and 82% of unrelated UCB transplantation. Unrelated BM and unrelated UCB transplantation (vs. related BM) were signifi cantly associated with a lower probability of neutrophil recovery (P = 0.015 and P = 0.016, respectively). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years after transplantation were 33% in related BM, 45% in related PBSC, 61% in unrelated BM, and 64% in unrelated UCB transplantation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PS \u2265 2 and unrelated BM were predictive factors for higher NRM. Overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years after transplantation were 63% in related BM, 43% in related PBSC, and 41% in unrelated BM transplantation. OS rate at 2 years after unrelated UCB transplantation was 36%, and OS rate at 5 years after UCB transplantation was not evaluable due to lack of patient who was alive beyond 5 years after transplantation (the longest follow-up term, 48 months). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that donor source was not a signifi cant factor to predict OS rate. Instead, PS \u2265 2 predicted lower OS rate and the 20 times or more RBC transfusion prior to transplantation had a trend toward lower OS rate. The present study could not fi nd an advantage of non-myeloablative preconditioning regimens in terms of decreasing NRM and increasing OS rate. Our results suggest that allogeneic HSCT, even unrelated BM and UCB transplantation, provide a curative treatment for PMF patients.",

Marks (7) St. James' University Hospital (Leeds, GB) Patients with advanced phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (AP-CML) fare badly with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the current \"gold standard\" therapy for treatment of chronic phase (CP) disease. The only long-term curative option for AP-CML is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but there are limited data on its effi cacy, especially since the introduction of TKI. We have performed preliminary analysis for 238 patients transplanted from 1st January 2000 to 30th September 2011 using British Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry data. Inclusion criteria were: BCR-ABL1-positive CML, patients receiving fi rst HSCT and HSCT performed for CML not in 1st CP. Median age at HSCT was 41.4 years and 68 patients received reduced intensity conditioning (29%); 169 (71%) had myeloablative HSCT. The stem cell source was bone marrow for 60 (25%), peripheral blood for 173 (73%) and umbilical cord for 5 (2%) patients. At the time of HSCT, disease stage was CP>1 in 122 (51%), accelerated phase in 80 (34%) and blastic phase (BP) in 36 (15%) patients. Eighty-seven (37%) patients had an HLA-identical sibling donor, 140 (59%) had an unrelated donor and 11 (4%) patients had other donors. Median time from CML diagnosis to HSCT was 13 months, and median follow-up post-HSCT was 4.25 years. Outcome estimates are in table 1. The management of patients with AP-CML remains problematic, in particular regarding the relative effi cacy of 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation TKI alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, and whether the outcome is aff ected according to whether patients present in AP or progress from 1st CP. In order to study these questions we have returned to the transplant centres with more detailed questions regarding treatment prior to HSCT. We have further data on 83 patients: median age at HSCT was 40.8 years with disease stage at HSCT determined as CP>1 in 46 (55%), accelerated phase in 35 (42%) and BP in 2 (2%) patients. Median disease duration pre-HSCT was 18 months, progression time to AP-CML was a median of 5.6 months and median HSCT followup was 6.75 years. Prior to HSCT 66 patients received imatinib, 21 had dasatinib, 4 had nilotinib, and 32 patients had chemotherapy, some with additional TKI. Outcome estimates show no signifi cant diff erence from those for the group of 238 patients (table 2) . Data collection and analysis are ongoing and outcome by disease phase at presentation and at HSCT, donor type and conditioning will be presented.",

Hahn (1), S. B\u00f6ttcher (2) , M. Ritgen (2) , S. Dietrich (1) , I. Herth (1) (2), P. Dreger (1) (1)University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, DE); (2)University of Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, DE) Study Design and Patients: In a single centre retrospective descriptive analysis, timing and dynamics of immune modulation, cGVHD, MRD (MRD-fl ow), and clinical outcome of all patients allografted for CLL between June 2005 and September 2012 were recorded. Results: Altogether 66 patients with a median age of 52 (37-67) years were allografted in the 7-year period. Indications according to EBMT criteria (hierarchical) were: (1) 17p-/TP53mut 24, (2) fl udarabine resistant 26, (3) early relapse 13, and Richter's syndrome 3. While 10 patients (15%) were allografted in 1st remission, 14 patients (21%) had refractory CLL (<PR) at SCT. An unrelated donor (UD) was used in 49 patients (74%). Disregarding 16 patients who were too early or had no MRD monitoring performed, the probability to live relapse-free and MRD-at 12 months after SCT was 58%, whereas the remainder had TRM (14%), relapse (10%), or lived relapse-free but MRD+ (18%). With a median follow-up of 33 months, all 29 +12mo MRD-patients are in continuing clinical remission with only a single patient re-converting to MRD+. In contrast, the relapse rate was 50% at 3 years in the 9 +12mo MRD+ patients (p<0.0001). +12mo MRD-could not be predicted by any pretransplant variable, but was strongly associated with GVL response patterns 1-2 (Leukemia 22:1377) (82% probability to achieve +12mo MRD-) and cGVHD (86% probability to achieve +12mo MRD-). The median time to immunosuppression taper (IST) was 86d and tended to be slower in patients with UD, those in CR/PR at SCT, and those MRD-immediately after SCT. The median time from IST to cGVHD was 63d, and the median time from cGHVD to MRD-was 49d. The cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 12mo was 67%; however, the +12mo prevalence of cGVHD was only 52% in living patients, and only 39% of these were still on IS. TRM, relapse incidence, PFS and OS at 3 years were 17%, 25%, 67% and 79% with <PR at SCT as the only factor signifi cantly aff ecting outcome. Conclusions: Patients with poor-risk CLL who survive relapse-free and are MRD-12mo after SCT have an extremely favourable outcome. With timely IST, the probability to achieve this status can be >50% and is signifi cantly improved by cGVHD. In GVL-sensitive patients, MRD-is immediately reached upon cGVHD onset.",

Mohty (15) (1)CHU Nantes (Nantes, FR); (2) T prolymphocytic (T-PLL) is a rare aggressive mature T cell disorder with distinctive clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics. The median OS is approximately 7 m with conventional chemotherapy. The anti-CD52 mAb allowed for an improved overall response rate around 75% with a CR rate of 60% and a median OS of 10 m. Allo-HSCT is currently the only potentially active option to consolidate response to initial chemoimmunotherapy in those eligible pts. We retrospectively studied all pts fulfi lling the requirements for P-TLL diagnosis and who underwent allo-HSCT reported to the SFGM-TC registry. Twenty pts (age 54 (36-65)) were identifi ed from 14 SFGM-TC ctrs from 2000 to 2010 (median y, 2009). Prior to allo-HSCT, 9 pts were in CR, 8 in PR, 3 refractory or in progression. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative for 8 pts and reduced for 12 pts. TBI was used in the conditioning regimen for 13 pts with 6 pts receiving \u2265 8 grays and 7 pts receiving 2 grays. Stem cells source was BM for 2, PBSCs for 14 and CB for 4 pts. Donor was HLA-matched sibling in 7 cases. Following transplantation, as best response, 17 pts were in CR while 1 progressive pt became partial responder. For 2 pts, response could not be determined due to early TRM. Eleven pts developed acute GVHD (gr I, n=1; gr II, n=7; gr III, n=2; and gr IV, n=1). The cumulative incidence of gr II to IV GVHD was 52% (95%CI:29-70%). Chronic GVHD was observed in 45% of the pts (4 limited form, 5 extensive form). With a median follow-up of 28.8 m (6.8-103) for surviving pts, 10 pts are alive with 7 of them being in CR. The KM estimates of OS and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 y were 41.7 (95%CI: 18-62%) and 29% (95%CI: 14-50%), respectively. The cause of death among the 10 pts was transplant related in 6 and due to disease progression in 4. The relapse incidence was 51%. Relapse was observed at a median of 14 m (2-24) after allo-HSCT. Among the 8 relapses, 4 occurred during the second year. TRM incidence was 38% at 3 years. Though not statistically signifi cant due to the relatively low number of pts, the use of TBI in the conditioning regimen was associated with a better PFS. We conclude that allo-HSCT may allow long term survival in some pts with T-PLL following induction treatment. Given the rarity of this disease, national and international collaborations (e.g. registry) are needed to further clarify the role of allo-HSCT and natural history of this rare and fatal disease.",

            "text": "A single centre experience of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia V. Murthy, B. Bailiff , K. Holder, M. Nikolousis, S. Paneesha, R. Lovell, D. Milligan, B. Kishore, A. Rekhi Heart of Engalnd NHS Foundation Trust (Birmingham, GB) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [CLL] is incurable with conventional chemo immune therapy. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a treatment option for patients with poor-risk CLL. Role of T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab in the transplant conditioning is controversial. We report here the single centre experience of SCT for CLL with both T deplete and T replete protocols. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 33 allografts for CLL between September 1999 and December 2011. Median age at diagnosis was 48yrs and median age at transplantation was 52yrs . Median number of previous therapies prior to SCT was 3 [range: 1 to 6] . 33% were in complete remission (CR), 48 % in partial remission (PR) and 12% with progressive disease (PD) at SCT. 67% received matched related donor (MRD) where as 27% received matched unrelated donor (MUD) and 6% mismatched unrelated donor (mMUD). Conditioning regimen was either fl udarabine, melphalan and alemtuzumab or fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide. Dose of alemtuzumab was 100 mg until 2001 which was changed to 60 mg for MRD and 100mg for MUD from 2002 to 2004 where as from 2006 onwards it is 50 mg for MUD and 30 mg for MRD. Results: Mean overall survival (OS) was 67 months [MRD 67, MUD 64 & mMUD 22] Median OS has not reached in our cohort. 55% achieved CR, 18% VGPR and 6% PR following SCT. 75% patients following T replete transplants and 72% patients with T deplete transplants are alive. 15% had relapse post SCT and are still alive. 33% patients received donor lymphocyte infusions. 9 patients died [3 due to infections, 1 grade IV graft versus host disease, 1 disease progression and 4 others]. All 3 infective deaths were in group receiving higher dose of alemtuzumab. Grade IV GvHD was in patient undergoing T replete allograft. There were 5 deaths in CR. Grade 3 or 4 acuteGvHD and extensive chroinc GVHD was seen in 18% which was observed in T replete transplants and in who received lower alemtuzumab dose. 15 patients had chronic GVHD and are alive. Transplant related mortality at 1 year is 15%. Survival postSCT at 1, 3 and 5 years is 76%, 65% and 65% respectively. Conclusion: Our data suggests allogeneic stem cell transplantation off er longer lasting remissions with less toxicity in patients with CLL. T cell depletion does not adversely impact transplant outcomes. Outcome in patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplants is good and number of prior therapies does not have an adverse impact on the overall survival.",

Jindra (1) , L. Raida (2) , M. Karas (1), A. Jungov\u00e1 (1), R. Urbanov\u00e1 (2) , T. Svoboda (1) , V. Vozobulov\u00e1 (1), K. Indr\u00e1k (2) , D. Lys\u00e1k (1) (1)University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ); (2)University Hospital Olomouc (Olomouc, CZ) Background: Despite innovative treatments CLL remains essentially incurable disease. Alternative approach is particularly needed for pts with an accumulation of adverse prognostic factors (del17p, purine resistance). AlloSCT with reduced conditioning (RIC) is promising therapeutic alternative because it reduces toxicity whilst preserving GVL. This prompted us to perform retrospective study to address the role of RIC-SCT in high-risk CLL pts and to identify the independent factors associated with transplant outcomes. Patients&Methods: Retrospective analysis of 68 consecutive pts with CLL from 2 centres (median 58 y, range 31-71) transplanted between 2002-12 by RIC protocols either with sibling (SIB group, n=22;32%) or unrelated donor (MUD,n=46;68%). Cytogenetics was available in 63 (93%) pts with unfavorable in 39 (57%). Del17p was detected in 20 (32%) of evaluable pts. Pts received a median of 3 lines of therapy (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) before SCT, all were refractory to purines, 33 (49%) were transplanted in advanced stage (>CR/PR3 or rel/refractory) There were no signifi cant diff erences between SIB and URD group with respect to relevant parameter (age, cytogenetics, disease status). MUDs were signifi cantly younger than the SIBs (median 31vs.56; p<0,0001). Results: For all patients (median follow of surviving 21 months, range 1-108) the median OS was 26 months and the 3-y Kaplan-Meier OS/DFS probabilities were 39% and 28%, respectively. The 3-y cumulative incidences of NRM and relapse were 49% and 37%. In multivariate analyses MUD recipients had similar OS and DFS compared to SIB recipients (hazard ratio [HR] 0, 72; p=0, 29 and 0, 649; p=0, 143) . The presence of del17p and/or adverse cytogenetics has no impact on survival (HR 1,49; p=0,2526 and 1,30; p=0,4066) . Similarly, advanced disease status (HR 1,63; p=0,1172) , no. of lines of therapy, interval from dg. to SCT, donor age, sex, no. of CD34+ cells transplanted have no impact on OS and DFS . Conclusion: RIC-SCT is an eff ective treatment of poor prognosis CLL and has capacity to overcome negative impact of cytogenetics. The data suggest equivalence of outcome using either SIB or MUD and supports the recommendation to consider RIC-SCT for poor risk CLL patient regardless of cytogenetic risk and the absence of related donor.",

Schiller, U. Holtick, S. Theurich, R. James, P. Schneider, M. Hallek, M. von Bergwelt-Baildon, C. Scheid University of Cologne (Cologne, DE) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for CLL patients who are refractory to therapy with purine analogues and/or those with a p53 mutation/deletion. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all CLL patients allografted at our institution University of Koln, Germany. Data was collected on 40 patients over a period of 8 years 2004-2012. The mean age was 54 (range 33-75) and the majority were male (male: female 30:10). On average the patients were diagnosed 6 years (range 2-12 years) prior to transplant with an average of 4 years (range 1-8 years) from time of fi rst line therapy to transplant. The remission status at the time of transplant were complete remission (CR) (n=3), stable disease (SD) (n=12), partial remission (PR) (n= 18) and progressive disease (PD) (n=7). On average the patients had received 4 (range 1-8) lines of treatment prior to transplant including autograft (n=4), Fludarabine (n=35) and Campath (n=21). 13 patients had matched sibling donors, 26 matched unrelated donors and one patient received stem cells from a Haplo-identical sibling. The conditioning regimens were reduced intensity such as Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide and 4Gy TBI (n=3), Fludarabine, Busulphan and Cyclophosphamide (n=5), Fludarabine and Busulphan (n=6), Fludarabine and Treosulfan (n=18), Fludarabine and 2Gy TBI (n=4) as well as Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (n=4). Unrelated and haploidentical transplant recipients recieved ATG (n=16) or Campath (n=2) in addition to CsA and MMF as GvHD prophylaxis. The average CD34+ cell dose was 4.16x106/kg (range 2.24-19.9). Neutrophil engraftment was seen on day +17(range 10-23) and 93% (37/40) achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 100. 35% (14/40) were in CR post transplant at day 100. 75% of patients are currently alive while 8 patients (20%) died of transplant related complications whilst 2 (5%) died of disease progression. Whereas time since fi rst diagnosis or number of lines of treatment prior to transplant had no infl uence on outcome, we found that use of ATG and CMV infection negatively infl uenced overall survival. Our single centre experience confi rms that nommyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a valuable treatment option in CLL patients refractory to Fludarabine or Campath with promising long term survival and acceptable transplant related mortality. Our preliminary fi ndings regarding ATG and CMV infection should prompt further research to improve immune recovery after allograft in CLL patients.",

Rahmoune, F. Mehdid, R. Belhadj, M. Baazizi, D. Ait Ouali, F. Harieche, F. Zerhouni, R.M. Hamladji Pierre and Marie Curie Center (Algiers, DZ) Background: Allogeneic HSCT is recognized as being the only curative treatment in the CML, despite its complications and high mortality rates. We report a single center retrospective study involving in 278 pts receiving HSCT for CML with my\u00e9loablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). Material and methods: From April 1998 to November 2011, 278 patients (pts) with CML underwent allogeneic HSCT with HLA identical sibling donors. The median age of the pts at transplant is 30 years . The sex-ratio is 1,07 and intervall diagnosis-graft was 13 months . The myeloablative stem cell transplantation (MAT) based on Tushka protocol was employed in 103 pts including 56 in fi rst chronic phase (CP), 40 in accelerated phase (AP) and 7 in blast crisis (BC). The prevention of the graft versus host (GVHD) associated ciclosporine and m\u00e9thotr\u00e9xate according to Seattle protocol. RIC based on the use of Fludarabine and Busulfan was employed in 175 pts including 151 pts in fi rst CP and 24 in AP. The GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine with mycophenolate mofetil. The grafts used are peripheral blood stem cells in 267 pts (96%), bone marrow in 9 pts (3,2%) and umbilical cord blood in 2 pts. Results: Aplasia is occurred in 181 pts (65%) with median duration: 10 days (2-48), overal median time to achieve neutrophils count > 500/mm 3 is at day 10 (10-55). Only 75 pts (27%) needed blood transfusion, 111 pts (40%) required platelets transfusion. No pt presented hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Acute GVHD occured in 121 pts (43,5%), it was between grade II and IV in 91 pts (32,7%. Chronic GVHD was observed in 175 pts (69%), extensive form in 116 pts (46%). The cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was seen in 51 pts (18,3%). Relapse of disease occurred in 49 pts (19,5%) at a median time of 46 months , among them 20 pts were presented in molecular remission (immunosuppression discontinuation : 9, DLI with or not Imatinib: 7 and second myeloablative allograft: 4). TRM incidence is 29,4%. At November 2012, 167 pts (60%) are still alive with a median follow-up 85 months and 111 pts died (40%). Causes of death are dominated by GVHD (66 pts) and relapse (28 pts). The Overall Survival (OS) and Event Free Survival (EFS) are respectively 60,2% and 52%. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT still keeps its place in the CML treatment arsenal even with the availability of thyrosine kinase inhibitors. It remains toxic given the incidence of GVHD and TRM which remain high as observed in this series and others publications.",

Schmitt, C. Hollenbach, F. Michel, B. Seyfarth, A. Schmitt, A. D. Ho, P. Dreger University Hospital Heidelberg (Heidelberg, DE) Background: The advent of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dramatically changed the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This applies also to the use of TKIs in the context of allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Material and Methods: In this survey data were collected from 45 patients (41 CML, 4 ALL; age 18-66 years) undergoing SCT at our institution. 13 of 45 patients received a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen including total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide S129 (TBI/CY), 32 patients a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with fl udarabine and busulfan, treosulfan or with TBI. Results: 28 of 45 patients were treated with fi rst and second generation TKIs before SCT. 19 of 45 patients received TKIs of 1st generation, 9 of 45 patients TKIs of 2nd generation. Twenty-three patients were transplanted in fi rst chronic phase (CP), 17 patients in second CR. Five patients received an allogenic graft in blast crisis. As for their remission status 17 patients were with progressive disease (PD) before transplantation, ten patients were in minor cytogenetic remission (mCR), ten patients in hematological complete remission (hCR), and eight patients in cytogenetic complete remission (cCR). Three of 45 patients developed a mixed donor chimerism after allogenic stem cell transplantation on day +28, 42 showed a complete donor chimerism at that time. After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 35 patients achieved a complete hematological remission and cytogenetic remission, 25 of them even a complete molecular remission. One patient reached a minor cytogenetic remission, 8 patients had progressive disease. 18 of 45 patients relapsed after transplantation. 14 of these 18 patients were again treated with TKIs, nine with TKIs alone. Five patients received additionally donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs). Four patients at relapse received only DLIs, but no TKIs. After a follow up of two to nine years six patients were alive, all of them received TKIs, three additionally DLIs. Conclusion: This evaluation demonstrates that all patients with Philadelphia positive leukemia were treated at our institution with a TKI before allogenic stem cell transplantation after the advent of TKIs; 18 of 45 patients developed a relapse after allogenic stem cell transplantation despite myeloablative conditioning and the administration of a TKI after transplantation brought half of the patients into remission.",

Nagler (1) (1)Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Ramat Gan, IL); (2)University of Turin (Turin, IT) Real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) is the major method for follow up of CML pts. In pts undergoing allogeneic SCT (Allo-SCT) it has been shown that successive increase in quantitative BCR ABL transcript levels correlates with the clinical outcome and may serve as an early sign of disease relapse and an indication for a therapeutic intervention such as the addition of a TKI or DLI. Several methods were recently designed in order to increase the sensitivity of BCR ABL detection. Replicate RQ-PCR (rRQ-PCR) is based on the observation that the number of measurement repetitions infl uences the detection of rare transcripts, and was found to increase by 2 logs the sensitivity compared to conventional RQ-PCR. We evaluated the role of rRQ-PCR in the detection of MRD in a cohort of long term post Allo-SCT CML patients. Samples from 12 CML pts (M=7, F=5), median age 43 y, at a median time of 85 months after SCT (range 28-136) were tested. SCT was myeloablative (n=6) or with RIC (n=6), from a matched sibling (n=7) or a MUD (n=5), in fi rst chronic phase (CP1) (n=8) or at a later phase (n=4). rRQ-PCR was negative in 9/12 pts, while 3 pts had positive results in 1 (1.2%), 2 (2.4%) and 6 (7.3%) of 82 analyzed replicates, respectively. The sensitivity of rRQ-PCR was 10-5.5 or higher in all pts. Negative rRQ-PCR result was not related to the phase at SCT (CP1 vs. others), conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs. RIC), donor type (sibling vs. MUD) or the presence of GVHD. Median time from diagnosis to SCT was borderline longer in pts with positive rRQ-PCR results (61 vs. 25 months, p=0.08). Higher sensitivity RQ-PCR methods are able to further defi ne subgroups of post BMT CML pts and allow for a more accurate follow up of MRD.",

Varda-Bloom, R. Somech, R. Yerushalmi, A. Shimoni Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Ramat Gan, IL) Relapse rate post alloSCT in advanced CML (>CP 1 ) and in Ph+ ALL is high. We assessed (study CAN107AIL03T) whether Nilotinib administration post alloSCT intensifi es remission and reduces relapses. 24 pts (M-13, F-11), age 36 years (range, 18-58) participated in the study, advanced CML -17 (BC-10, AP-7), Ph+ ALL -7. 22/24 pts underwent alloSCT (2 are pending) from an HLAmatched sibling (n=11), matched unrelated (n=8) or alternative donor (CB-2, Haplo-1). All, but one, had myeloablative conditioning (Bu/Cy or Flu/Bu-14, TBI/Cy-7). GVHD prophylaxis included CSA and methotrexate or MMF. 21/22 pts engrafted in median day+13 (range, 9-38) with 100% donor chimerism. TRT included mucositis in all pts, encephalitis-2, pericarditis-1, VOD-1 and infection-3. 3 pts died very early post transplant from sepsis and multi organ failure. Acute GVHD \u2265 Gr II was observed in 10 pts (III-IV in 5). cGVHD was observed in 15 pts (extensive -9). 16/22 transplanted pts received Nilotinib (200mg x 2/d -10, 300mg x 2/d -6) starting at median day +38 (range, 30-158) post alloSCT. 6 pts did not receive Nilotinib post alloSCT due to early death -3, progressive disease -1, severe pancytopenia -1, refusal -1. Nilotinib administration was delayed or dose reduced/stopped in 9 and 7 pts, respectively due to toxicities. All, but 2 pts achieved MMR post alloSCT and 6 of them (CML) converted to CMR following Nilotinib therapy. Kinas mutation (G205E and F359V) were detected only in 1 pt with disease progression. With a median follow up of 16.5 mo (range, 2.5-38) 12 pts are alive while 12 died (Infection -5, GVHD -3, TTP-1, disease progression -3). In 2 pts disease progressed but responded to further therapy. All 6 pts that did not receive Nilotinib died (early death post allo-SCT -3, disease progression -1, GVHD Gr IV -2). Immunological evaluation post Nilotinib administration disclosed no signifi cant change in T, B and NK cell numbers and T cell mitogenic response. Thymic output (TREC) and receptor repertoire (Spectrotyping) analysis indicates continuous thymopoiesis in 8/13 evaluated pts. NK cytotoxic activity against K562 increased in 9/15 evaluated pts. In summary: Nilotinib maitenance therapy post alloSCT in pts with advanced CML and Ph+ALL did not interfere or jeopardized immune reconstitution and function including the number of immune cell subsets, T cell mitogenic response, TRC repertoire, thymic output and NK cytolytic activity post alloSCT.",

Toshkov Hospital for Hematological Diseases (Sofi a, BG) The aim of the study was to access the immune recovery of T-, B-and NK-cells for a period of 24 months after allogeneic stem cells transplantation (allo-SCT) performed in BMT unit (CIC 859). Materials and methods: Fourteen patients (pts) were enrolled in the study -6 female and 8 male, mean age 34 years (21-50), including 6 with acute myeloid; 7 with B-cell acute lymphoblastic, and 1 with plasmablastic leukemia. All pts received donor peripheral stem cells: 8 -from matched related and 6 from matched unrelated donors. According to the underlying disease 8 pts received CY/TB, and 6 -Bu/Cy conditioning myeloablative regimens. The percentage (%) and absolute count (AC) values of lymphocyte populations and subpopulations were determined in the PB at three time intervals: M1 at 3-6, M2 at 7-12 and M3 at 13-24 months after HSCT by fl ow cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Diva v.6.1) using a lysis/no wash procedure, TruCount tubes (BD) and a 6-colour monoclonal antibodies combination CD3F/CD8PE/CD45PerCP/ CD4PE-Cy7/19APC/CD8APC-Cy7.T-cell subpopulations were assessed by CD4, CD8, CD28, CD7, CD45RA, CD57 and CD62L. Results: The mean lymphocyte AC determined by fl ow cytometry reached levels near the low range at M1 (1402 cells/ \u03bc l), which remained stable at M2 (1393 cells/ \u03bc l) and increased up to 2196 cell/ \u03bc l at the 24th month. The recovery of CD3+T-cells showed an increase of % and AC as follows: at M1 -69% (992 cell/\u03bcl); M2 -63% (865 cell/\u03bcl); M3 -69% (1461cell/\u03bcl). Unlike T-cells, the dynamics of the NK (CD56+CD16+CD3-) cells showed a gradual decrease after the 6th month reaching 12% (224 cells/ \u03bc l) at M3, remaining near the lower reference value. An increase in the percentage and AC levels of CD19+ lymphocytes was observed from 14 % (253 cell/\u03bcl) at M2 up to 19 % (465 cell/\u03bcl) at M3. The CD4:CD8 ratio was low for the whole period (0.69-0.61). The mean % of CD8+T-cells were stable above the upper reference level -45% (919 cell/\u03bcl) at M3. However, the % of some CD8+Tcell subsets (na\u00efve, eff ectors and memory cells) were within the reference ranges, while late (CD28-CD57+) and intermediate (CD28-CD57-) eff ectors showed very high levels. Post-transplantation immune recovery is a long and multifactorial process. The results might further contribute to the more exact understanding of the particular stages of immunological reconstruction. Ackowledgements: Studies were supported by the National Science Fund.",

Bonini San Raff aele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is caused by alloreactive donor T cells targeting host tissues. By sustaining a persistent alloresponse, long-living memory stem T cells (TSCM) with the ability to self-renew and the plasticity to diff erentiate into potent eff ectors, may represent crucial players in GvHD, when specifi c for alloantigens. We demonstrated that CD8+ TSCM, characterized by a CD45RA+CD62L+CD95+ phenotype, are able to mediate a potent xeno-GvHD when infused in immunodefi cient mice, with xenoreactivity preserved even upon serial transplants (Cieri, Blood 2012). Thus, we hypothesized that TSCM lymphocytes may exert a role in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). To verify this hypothesis and assess the impact of TSCM on immune reconstitution and GvHD incidence, circulating lymphocytes from 10 transplanted patients were analyzed 1-month post-HSCT. A selective accumulation of TSCM was documented, as the majority of circulating CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+ T lymphocytes was CD95+ and represented a higher fraction of total CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls (P=0.0025). The percentage of TSCM correlated with aGvHD occurrence (P=0.0148) and severity, being significantly higher in patients with aGvHD grade III-IV than in those with aGvHD \u2264 grade II (P=0.009). TSCM percentage 1-month after HSCT was predictive also for subsequent development of cGvHD (P=0.007). Patients with high frequencies of circulating TSCM required more intense immunosuppression than patients with low TSCM frequencies (P=0.012). Accordingly, there was a trend towards higher mortality in patients bearing higher TSCM frequencies. The extent of TSCM accumulation 1-month post-HSCT did not correlate with the dose of CD3+ cells infused, nor with the degree of donor/recipient mismatch. Finally, circulating T cells from 4 patients were evaluated prospectively. In 1 patient who did not develop GvHD, low TSCM frequencies remained stable over time, while in the other 3 patients, who experienced GvHD, a drastic reduction of TSCM percentages was observed after GvHD resolution (P=0.046). Our study quantify for the fi rst time TSCM cells after allogeneic HSCT and suggests that early TSCM accumulation is predictive for GvHD development. A prospective longitudinal study of TSCM dynamics post-HSCT in a larger cohort of patients is envisaged. If a causative role for TSCM in GvHD will be demonstrated, therapies to selectively target this T-cell subset may be designed to relieve GvHD burden.",

Ho (1) , P. Dreger (1) , M. Schmitt (1) (1)University Hospital Heidelberg (Heidelberg, DE) ; (2)University Hospital Rostock (Rostock, DE) Objectives: Everolimus (RAD-001), a derivative of sirolimus, is a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that is recently used off -label for patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is useful in reducing cyclosporinerelated nephrotoxicity. Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) constitutes a frequent problem after both solid organ transplantation (SOT) and HSCT. Therefore we investigated whether everolimus has an impact on CMV-specifi c T cell responses. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-A2/CMV seropositive healthy volunteers were purifi ed by Ficoll and subsequently by MACS \u00ae beads. CD8 positive cells were stimulated with HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from CMVpp65 (NLVPMVATV) in a mixed lymphocyte-peptide culture (MLPC) in the presence of increasing concentration of everolimus. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays were used to study the immunomodulatory eff ect of everolimus on CMV-specifi c CD8 positive T cells. Results: Proliferation of CD8 positive T cells after stimulation with CMV pp65 peptide and the frequency of CMV-specifi c T cells stained with pp65 tetramers were suppressed by low doses of everolimus in a dose-dependent manner. When we added everolimus at concentration corresponding to the therapeutical range of the drug (3-8 ng/ml), CD8 positive T cells were strongly suppressed (by 90%). Beyond proliferation, everolimus had a strong impact on the frequency of CD8 positive T cells expressing the activation marker CD137 and the secretion of cytokines. Secretion of interferon-\u03b3 and granzyme B was strongly suppressed similarly to what was shown for the proliferation. In addition we studied the infl uence of everolimus on T cells after stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Again, proliferation of T cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: We demonstrate here that everolimus strongly hampers CMV-specifi c CD8 positive T cells. As reactivation of CMV plays a pivotal role for the outcome of patients after HSCT, attention must be paid to early detection and pre-emptive treatment of CMV reactivity in patients treated with everolimus.",

            "text": "CD4-positive lymphopenia at day +30 after transplant is a biological predictive factor for EBV reactivation F. Patriarca (1) Previous studies suggest that the risk of development of post transplant lymphoproliferative dosorders (PTLD) is overcome by blood monitoring of Epstain-Barr virus (EBV)-DNAemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and by the timely administration of Rituximab in cases with higher levels of EBV-DNAemia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of a strategy of EBV-DNAemia surveillance and pre-emptive Rituximab applied in 100 consecutive patients transplanted between January 2008 and December 2010, with the aim of identifying prognostic factors for EBV reactivation. Most of the patients received RIC regimens (67%) and were reinfused with PB (79%) coming from unrelated donors (68%) . All the 68% of patients who performed unrelated transplants were treated with ATG. EBV-DNA was evaluated by quantitative realtime PCR in whole blood specimens weekly in the fi rst 3 months after HSCT and every 2 weeks until immuno suppression. Preemptive therapy with rituximab was given to those patients who showed high viral loads defi ned as any value \u2265 10,000 cp/ml. Cumulative incidence of high load EBV-DNAemia was 14% at 12 months. Univariate analysis showed a signifi cant association between high EBV DNA loads and transplants from unrelated donors (p = 0.016), HLA-mismatching (p = 0.006), standard doses of ATG as GVHD prophylaxis (p = 0.002), and low CD4+ lymphocyte count at day +30 (p< 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count higher than 50 mcgL at day +30 was the only factor signifi cantly associated with a reduced risk of EBV reactivation (OR 0.10; CI, 0.020-0.481; p = 0.004). Thirteen of 16 patients with high viral loads were preemptively treated with rituximab and achieved EBV DNA negativity. There were 3 patients who had already developed PTLD at the time of detection of high EBV DNA loads and obtained complete response after rituximab infusions and chemotherapy. Patients with high EBV DNA load had a signifi cantly higher TRM compared to patients with negative or low viral load (54% vs 16%, p = 0.009) and a trend to lower OS (55% vs 29%, p = 0.060). We conclude that CD4+ cell count at day +30 is a predictive factor for EBV reactivation and may help identify patients requiring closer monitoring. Although only 3% of patients progressed to PTLD and were all successfully managed, EBV reactivation was associated with higher TRM, mainly due to infections.",

            "text": "Early CMV-specifi c CD8+ T-cell responses monitored by pentamer staining correlate with protection against CMV reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation A. Zabalza (1) , M. Ciaurriz (2) , L. Beloki (2) , N. Ramirez (2) CMV reactivation after allo-SCT is usually monitored by CMV-PCR. We present the results of a pilot study using Pentamers for monitoring CMV-specifi c CD8+ T-cells. 17 patients (pts) underwent allo-SCT from HLA-Id siblings (n=7) or HLA-matched unrelated (n=7) donors and were enrolled in this prospective study (3 pts died before day +100 and were not evaluable). The diagnosis of the 14 evaluable pts was acute leukemia (n=10), lymphoproliferative disorder (n=2) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n=2). Conditioning was myeloablative in 8 pts (7 CyTBI and 1 BuCy) and reduced intensity in the remaining 6 pts. Recipients of unrelated donor cells received Campath (10 mg/day, days -10 to -6). All pts and donors were positive for the HLA-A*0201 allele. Pentamers (Proimmune, UK) were directed against the epitope NLVPMVATV of the pp65495-503 protein of CMV in the context of HLA-A*0201. Samples were obtained from engraftment at 30-day intervals until day +180 and 2-monthly thereafter. Median follow-up was 10 months (2-25) after SCT. All pts engrafted at a median of 20 days (12-27). Acute GVHD occurred in 5 pts (median 54.2 days, range 18-92). Three patterns were observed. In 2 pts (14%) no CMV-specifi c CD8+ T-cells could be detected despite 5 episodes each of CMV-PCR reactivation requiring prolonged cumulative antiviral therapy (67 and 136 days each). In 6 pts (43%) CMV-PCR reactivation occurred at a median of 36 days and triggered a rapid increase of CMV-specifi c CD8+ T-cells (median 97.3 x 105/L, range 1. 3-279.7) . The CMV-PCR became immediately negative and antiviral therapy was stopped promptly after a median of 15 days (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Subsequent CMV-PCR reactivations (median 1.8, range 1-3) also lasted under 2 weeks in this group. Finally, 6 pts (43%) showed an early immune reconstitution with CMV-specifi c CD8+ T-cells detected (median 1.4 x 105/L, range 0. 3-2.85) in the absence of CMV-PCR reactivation at a median of 22 days (10-34) post-SCT. No CMV-PCR reactivation was observed in this group with a median follow-up of 7.5 months (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Monitoring CMV-specifi c T-cell immunity after allo-SCT in combination with CMV-PCR may be able to distinguish pts at higher risk of recurrent CMV reactivation and in need of prolonged antiviral therapy. Patients with increasing CMV-specifi c CD8+ T-cells detectable at the time of CMV-PCR reactivation may only need a short course of antiviral therapy, while those with early CMVspecifi c CD8+ T-cells may be protected from CMV reactivation.",

Mensen (1) After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), donor graft-derived B cells only transiently provide immune protection in patients, and immune defects that contribute to an increased risk for severe infections occur. In this study, we determined for the first time the reconstitution kinetics of B cells after alloHSCT in patients suffering from acute leukemia. In a first cohort of patients, RT-PCR quantification of \u03ba-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC), which are generated during B cell development, revealed a high positive correlation with transitional B cell recovery (generalized estimating equations analyses \u00df*=0.585 vs. \u00df*=0.383 for memory B cells), and indicated that the bone marrow B cell output started around day +60 post alloHSCT. Next, we used flow cytometry for phenotypical and functional (activation, survival and migratory markers) characterization of several B cell subsets after alloHSCT. Total B cell numbers were already decreased pre-transplant (mean cells per ml blood \u00b1SEM: 11\u00b13 alloHSCT, 43\u00b18 healthy donor) and dropped even further within the first month after alloHSCT. Detectable B cells in the early phase post-transplant exhibited a highly activated phenotype (CD86+ and CD95+), and were putative of donor graft origin. The expression levels of the survival receptor BAFF-R and the chemokine receptors CCR7, CXCR5 and CXCR4 were significantly decreased. In accordance to our RT-PCR data, early onset of bone marrow B cell neogenesis was seen in about 50% of patients between day 60 and 90 after alloHSCT, characterized by a strong increase in cell number (75\u00b131, day 90) and predominance of transitional B cells exhibiting normal expression of activation markers, but still reduced expression of BAFF-R and CCR7. Interestingly, B cell reconstitution was significantly delayed in patients with acute GVHD compared to patients without GVHD (88% vs 25%, p=0.04). In addition to the B cells, we also analyzed the kinetics of T cells and dendritic cells as potential interactive players. Pre-transplant numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells were also significantly decreased. In summary, our data reveal a switch in the B cell subset distribution and pattern of functional characteristics, paralleling the shift of graft-derived B cells in favor to newly regenerating B cells two month after alloHSCT. Furthermore, incidence of acute GvHD signifi cantly delayed the onset of B cell reconstitution.",

            "text": "Introduction: Reconstitution of adaptive cellular immunity is pivotal to protect against viral infections post haematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Research on immune reconstitution has mainly been focused on the early period post HSCT. In contrast, little is known about the eff ects of early infections on the reconstituted cellular immune system in steady state conditions. Here, the impact of early cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation after HSCT on the lymphocyte compartment at one year post HSCT was studied. Methods: Children, who underwent HSCT for malignant and nonmalignant haematological disorders in our centre from 2002 to 2010 and were eligible for follow-up one year later (n=160), were included. Viral infections were routinely monitored by weekly serum viral DNA PCR in the fi rst 100 days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were drawn one year post HSCT and analyzed by multicolour fl ow cytometry. Results: CMV reactivated patients (n=46, PCR at least 1x > log 2.3) had signifi cantly higher lymphocyte counts than patients without CMV reactivation (n=114, PCR always < log 2.3). This eff ect was caused by an increase of CD8+T-cells (median 1152 vs. 390 cells/ uL, p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) and both CD8+ and CD8-\u03b3-\u03b4 (gd) T-cells (all gd T-cells: median 86 vs. 41 cells/uL, p<0.0001), while numbers of CD4+T-cells, NK-cells and B-cells were comparable. No diff erences were found between donor-patient pre-transplant CMV serostatus combinations. However, a correlation of the maximum CMV load early post HSCT and CD8+ (p=0.040) and gd T-cell (p=0.021) counts one year post HSCT was observed. In a representative subcohort (n=53, 2008 -2010) , we more closely analyzed the diff erentiation stages of CD8+T-cells based on expression of CD45RA and CCR7. Patients with CMV reactivation (n=14) had, compared to patients without CMV reactivation (n=39), signifi cantly higher numbers of eff ector memory (EM, median 485 vs. 119 cells/uL, p<0.0001) and end-stage eff ector (EE, median 492 vs. 106 cells/uL, p<0.0001) CD8+T-cells, while na\u00efve (N) and central memory (CM) cell numbers were similar in both groups (see fi gure). In contrast to CMV, this profi le of lymphocyte numbers and phenotype was not observed in patients after early EBV reactivation. Conclusion: We show that CMV reactivation early post HSCT is associated with expansion of the EM and EE CD8+T-lymphocyte compartments in steady-state one year post HSCT, without compromising the size of the na\u00efve and CM pools available to respond to newly encountered pathogens.",

Servais, E. Lengline, R. Porcher, M. Carmagnat, R. Peff ault de Latour, G. Maki, C. Granier, M. Robin, E. Clave, A. Xhaard, N. Dhedin, A. Toubert, H. Moins, G. Socie Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, FR) There is no consensus about what is the best alternative source of stem cells when no suitable HLA-matched (un)related donor is identified for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT): mismatched unrelated donor (mmUD) or umbilical cord blood (CB)? Data about immune reconstitution and risk factors for infection after alternative HCT are limited. Here, we compared immune reconstitution after CB-vs 9/10 HLA-mmUD-HCT. Methods: Sixty-six patients who underwent a fi rst HCT from either CB (n=30) or 9/10 HLA-mmUD (n= 36) at Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris) from 01/2005 to 12/2010 were evaluated. Immune reconstitution was prospectively assessed by fl ow cytometry on fresh blood samples collected at \u00b11month before and then at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months after HCT. The following phenotypes were studied: Natural killer (NK) cells (CD3-CD56+); B cells (CD19+) and their na\u00efve (CD27-) and memory (CD27+) subsets; CD4+ and CD8+T cells and their na\u00efve (CD45RA+CCR7+), central memory (CM:CD45RA-CCR7+), eff ector memory (EM:CD45RA-CCR7-) and late eff ector memory (LEM:CD45RA+CCR7-) subsets as well as regulatory T cells (Treg:CD4+CD25+CD127low). Results: Reconstitution of T cells was signifi cantly delayed in CB recipients compared with mmUD during the fi rst 12 months post-HCT (P<0.05), particularly for CD8+T cells subset (P<0.01). In contrast, NK cells recovered more quickly during the fi rst 6 months after CB-HCT (P<0.01). B cells counts were also higher in CB recipients till 24 months post-HCT (P=0.005). This resulted in signifi cant diff erences in the pattern of immune circulating cells after HCT in CB and mmUD recipients, particularly at 3 months post-transplant ( Fig.1) . Concerning CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the distribution between na\u00efve and memory subsets was diff erent in CB and mmUD cohorts as T cells from CB were characterized by smaller proportion of na\u00efve cells and higher proportion of EM cells during early post-transplant period (P<0.01). There was no diff erence in term of Treg reconstitution. Concerning B cells, their reconstitution was characterized by a large predominance of na\u00efve cells for both cohorts during the fi rst two years after HCT. Conclusion: In comparison with mmUD, HCT from CB was characterized by faster NK and B cells reconstitution but delayed T cells recovery, mainly for CD8+ and na\u00efve compartments. If these different patterns of immune reconstitution may translate in different susceptibility for severe infections has to be determined. S133 P561 TREC after allogeneic stem cell transplantation as a predictive marker for relapse after AML and MDS/MPS M. Uzunel, D. Sairafi , J. Mattsson, M. Uhlin Therapeutic Immunology (Stockholm, SE) T-cell defi ciency after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is common and has major impact on clinical outcome. While T cells are the major eff ector population responsible for the graft versus leukemia (GVL) eff ect after ASCT their function is vital for inhibiting relapse. In this retrospective study, 210 patients with malignant disease were analyzed with regards to levels of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) during the fi rst 24 months after transplantation. It has been shown that reconstitution of TREC levels after myeloablative conditioning concurs with return to normal composition of na\u00efve T-cells and TCR repertoire. Patient blood samples were collected at regular intervals (2, 3, 6, 9, 12 , and 24 months) after ASCT. CD3+ cells were separated using direct antibody-coupled magnetic beads, followed by extraction of DNA according to a standard protocol. The \u03b4 Rec-?;J \u03b1 signal joint TREC was measured using a Taq-Man real-time quantitative PCR protocol with primers and probes directed to the signal joint region. The patient population was divided in groups based on their malignant disease. CML (n=26), CLL (n=8), AML (n=50), ALL (n=93) and MDS/MPS (n=33). The level of TREC at the diff erent time points was then correlated to relapse-incidence and relapse-free survival (RFS).",

            "text": "No signifi cant correlation between TREC levels at any time point and relapse incidence or RFS could be seen in patients with CLL, CML or ALL. For patients with AML, TREC levels at 2 months post transplantation were signifi cantly correlated to both RFS at 5 years (TREC > median 78%, TREC < median 54%, p=0,01 ) and relapse incidence (TREC > median 13%, TREC < median 46%, p=0,038). For patients with MDS/MPS, TREC levels at 9 months post transplantation were signifi cantly associated with RFS at 5 years (TREC > median 100%, TREC < median 48%, p=0,01 ) and relapse incidence (TREC > median 0%, TREC < median 52%, p=0,01 ). This study shows the potential use of TREC measurement in peripheral blood to predict relapse in patients with AML and MDS/MPS after ASCT. Objectives: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is widely used in the conditioning regimen of children undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent graft-versus-hostdisease and rejection of the graft. However, data on immune reconstitution following ATG are scarce. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the engraftment kinetics and clinical parameters of 113 paediatric/adolescent patients (median age 11.9 years) undergoing HSCT following myeloablative conditioning with or without in vivo T-cell depletion. Patients with matched unrelated donor received either ATG-Fresenius (n=45, group 1) or Thymoglobuline Genzyme (n=30, group 2), while patients with matched sibling donor (n=38, group 3) underwent HSCT without in vivo T-cell depletion. Immune cell subsets (CD4, CD8, NK, CD19, na\u00efve CD4) were determined on day +50, +100, +180 and +360 post HSCT. Results: Immune reconstitution in the three groups was comparable in most cell subsets (Table 1) . Important diff erences were lower average numbers of CD4+ cells following ATG-Fresenius compared to Thymoglobuline (p=0.049) and those not receiving ATG (p=0.002). By day +180, median CD4 cells were similar in all groups. Moreover, average na\u00efve CD4+ cells were lower in group 1 and group 2 compared to group 3 (p<0.001). Concerning infectious complications, percentages of cytomegalovirus or adenovirus reactivation in the peripheral blood tended to be higher following ATG (group 1 and 2: 23/75, 31% vs. group 3: 3/38, 8%, p=0.29), while occurrence of graft versus host disease grade 3 and 4 was similar in the three groups (group 1 and 2: 10/75, 13% vs. group 3: 3/38, 8%, p=0.47). Epstein barr virus lymphoproliferative disease occurred only in patients following in vivo T-cell depletion (group 1: 3/45, 7%, group 2: 3/30, 7%). Conclusions: Following myeloablative conditioning, immune reconstitution of most cell subsets after day +50 is similar with or without in vivo T-cell depletion. Occurrence of na\u00efve CD4 cells as a sign for thymic recovery is faster without ATG. Apart from transiently lower CD4 cells following ATG-Fresenius, immune reconstitution is not majorly infl uenced by the ATG preparation used.",

Albiero (1), K. Chieregato (1) , A. Alghisi (1) , C. Lievore (1) , M.A. Cassatella (2) , D. Madeo (1), F. Rodeghiero (1) , G. Astori (1) (1)San Bortolo Hospital (Vicenza, IT); (2) University of Verona (Verona, IT) Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection counts as some of the most signifi cant complications following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The capture of T-cells secreting cytokines or expressing T cell activation markers after specifi c viral antigens stimulation allows the isolation of CMV-specifi c T cells (CMV-T). Two strategies are currently clinically applied: isolation of CMV-T using streptamer technology, or isolation of cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 (IFN-g) in response to antigen stimulation (g-catch). Aim: We explored the T cell response of the anti-CMV CD4+ and CD8+ T cells obtained with either g-catch or by selection of CD154 diff erentially expressed upon stimulation with pp65, IE1 or both CMV peptides. Methods: Blood was obtained from CMV seropositive donors. PBMC were isolated after density gradient separation and cultured in RPMI medium with 1% antibiotic and 10% human AB serum (CTL medium). PBMC were stimulated with CMV-pp65 or/and -IE1 peptide pools, co-stimulated with CD28 and incubated at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2. For CD154 experiments, cultures were stimulated in the presence of anti-CD40 antibody. For the isolation of CMV-T following stimulations, cells were either magnetically enriched by the g-catch or by CD154-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). After isolation, CMV-T were cultured in the presence of feeder cells in CTL medium supplemented with recombinant human interleukins for a maximum of 21 days. CMV-T were stained before and after selection for immunophenotyping (IF) and intracellular cytokine staining (ICC) and analysed by flow cytometer. Results: IF on the enriched fractions and ICC on expanded CMV-T allowed comparison of purity and enrichment between the two isolation methods and virus epitopes. The IFN-g secreting CD4+ T cells have been enriched up to 66% ( Figure 1 ) and with signifi cant CD8+ component too, with an highly variable expansion factor. Although isolation of CD154+ cells greatly favours enrichment of CD4+ T cells, a number of CD8+ T cells was simultaneously expanded depending on the type of peptide and of the simultaneous use of them. Conclusions: We have successfully generated IFN-g+ and CD154+ CMV-T cells upon stimulation with both CMV antigens. Improvement of the experimental protocols will be aimed at the functional CMV-T characterization and at the achievement of high frequencies of both CD4+ and CD8+ targeting IE1 and pp65 CMV epitopes with either CD154 selection or g-catch. Methods: We studied 61 adult patients with hematologic malignancies (24 AML, 13 ALL and 24 other malignancies), who received haploidentical grafts with PT-CY, following a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Genetic analysis included HLA-class I haplotypes of donor/recipient pairs for the expression of KIR-ligands and donor KIR genotype. Phenotypic and functional analyses were performed to study NK cell repertoire in the donor and in the recipient at diff erent time intervals post-HSCT. Results: We observed that 15/61 patients received BM from donors with A/A, while 46/61 from donors with B/X KIR haplotypes (21/61 cases with \u22652 B content score). Moreover, 20/ 61 patients were transplanted from NK alloreactive donors. A fast immune reconstitution was observed after BMT and post 1 month, lymphocytes were represented by 38% NK cells and 62% T (median values). At this time point NK cells appeared phenotypically immature: virtually all cells were CD56bright, CD94/NKG2A+ (i.e. inhibitory receptor specifi c for HLA-E), while low percentages of CD16, KIRs and CD57 positive cells were represented. However, these NK cells displayed a normal cytolytic activity revealed by degranulation assay upon K562 stimulation. A more mature phenotype, characterized by a majority of CD56dim cells and identifi cation of KIR+ NKG2A-NK cells, could be frequently observed only several (6-12) months after transplant. Relapse was seen in 5/20 patients receiving BMT from NK alloreactive donors, while 14/41 patients receiving BMT from no-NK alloreactive donors (p=0.3). Considering the B content score, 7/15 and 7/21 patients receiving BM from donors with 0 and \u22652, respectively, relapsed (p= 0.3). In AML patients, the impact of NK alloreactivity and B content score appeared to be more relevant (p=0.2) and p= 0.1, respectively). Conclusion: NK phenotype is immature following haplo-BMT. There is a trend for protection against relapse in patients receiving haplo-BMT from NK alloreactive and/or high B content donors, especially in AML. With larger number of patients we expect to see signifi cant diff erences. The speed of immune recovery following haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) is of central importance to overcome infectious complications and relapse. In order to evaluate the infl uence of graft manipulation on immune recovery we retrospectively examined the immune-reconstitution post haplo-SCT in 35 pediatric patients suff ering from high acute leukemia in a multi-centre (Frankfurt, Leiden, Ulm, Wuerzburg) longitudinal study. 17 patients received a CD34+ selected graft (group A) and 18 patients a T-and B-depleted graft (group B). Patients in both groups did not diff er in the mean age (p>0.2) and the underlying diseases (ALL, AML); (p>0.2). However, the conditioning regimes varied according to the underlying disease and the kind of graft manipulation. 14 and 3 patients received standard myeloablative conditioning regimen and reduced intensity conditioning regimen, respectively in group A vs. 5 and 13 patients in group B (p=0.002). In addition status of complete remission (CR) prior to haplo-SCT was lower in group A (11/17) compared to group B (17/18); (p=0.04). The incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grad I-II was 7/17 and 9/ 19 patients in group A and group B, respectively. 2/17 and 4/18 patients of group A and B, respectively, even had a GvHD>grad III. The incidence rates of lethal infections were 1/17 and 3/18 patients in group A and group B, respectively.The main cause of death was relapse in both groups. The median follow-up time was 10 months (range 1.6 to 86 months) for all patients and 26 months (range 3.7 to 86 months) for survivors, respectively. In order to harmonize diff erences between groups, we performed a joint model of overall survival and the dynamics of leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, T-cells and their subsets, NK-and B-cells. In our model, we considered two factors: Remission degree and the graft manipulation (group A and B). Age-matched monocytes regeneration was faster in patients without remission compared to those in remission (p<0.001). Furthermore, T-cells and T cell subsets recovered more quickly in group B (p<0.02). In contrast, NK cells and B cells expanded more rapidly in group A (p<0.004; p<0.02). Dynamics of all cell types had a signifi cant infl uence on overall survival. In conclusion, cell reconstitution dynamics was infl uential for overall survival, but showed a complex diversity with regard to the engineering graft procedure. Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) poses a threat to patients after HSCT. CMV reactivation might lead to CMV-disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is challenging to identify those patients at risk for developing CMV-disease or recurrent CMV-reactivation in need for prolonged treatment and more meticulous monitoring. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) and its receptor represent a key pathway preventing T cells from activation-inducedcell-death associated with the up-regulation of T lymphocyte survival factors; it also promotes T-cell expansion and long-term memory immune response. IL-7 induces phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT-5), which enters the nucleus and binds to specifi c DNA sequences in the promoter regions of various genes, resulting in gene activation or repression. Method: We evaluated the function of the IL-7 signalling pathway by measuring the phosphorylation of STAT5 in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and TCR \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells in response to stimulation with IL-7 and IL-2 in blood from 40 HSCT-patients 1-6 months after HSCT. Patients were monitored weekly with a quantitative PCR from the time of engraftment for CMV viral load in whole blood until at least d. 100 after HSCT and thereafter approximately every two weeks in patients with GVHD or in those who had a previous CMV episode. Results: In general, a higher number of CD4+ T-cells, as compared to CD8+ T-cells, responded to IL-7 or IL-2 defi ned by STAT-5 phosphorylation. A more detailed analysis was performed comparing responses from patients who did not reactivate (CMV-), patients that did reactivate (CMV+), and patients with prolonged or recurrent reactivation (CMV++). Lower levels of constitutive STAT-5 phosphorylation was seen in CD3+ T cells obtained from the CMV+ group determined by one-way Anova (p-value= 0.0008). The % of cells with phosphorylated STAT-5 upon IL-7 stimulation was lower in CD8+ T cells in CMV+ patients (median 20. 6, 6.3, 7.5, 4.8, 5.6 and 5.3) and CMV++ patiens (median 10.6, 4.14, 5.37, 3.3, 2. 39 and 2.93) for time points 1-6 as compared to 21.2, 20.28, 16.8, 45 and 0.56) after HSCT (p-value = 0.03 determined by one way ANOVA). Conclusion: Reduced responsiveness to IL-7 is correlated to CMVreactivation. This ability is more pronounced in CD8+ T cells. Functional response analysis to IL-7 may provide a clinically relevant marker to identify patients at risk to develop CMV reactivation. Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a powerful tool to induce life-long immune tolerance to donor allo-antigens. The underlying mechanisms controlling hostversus-graft (HvG) responses are incompletely understood, but primarily involve peripheral regulation elicited during the phase of hematopoietic reconstitution. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of NKT cells on HvG responses and the relationship with other immunoregulatory networks, namely regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).",

Recipient mice were CD1d-/-(with no NKT cells), wild type (controls) or wild type recipients after in vivo NKT stimulation with \u03b1 GalCer. MDSC and Treg populations were assessed in parallel. Results: The absence of NKT cells during hematopoietic reconstitution greatly facilitated the engraftment of donor HY+ HSC. Accordingly, the stimulation of NKT cells antagonized HSC engraftment. During the hematopoietic expansion that follows cytotoxic regimen-induced myeloablation, the tempo and magnitude by which the various immune components reconstitute the host differed. The process involved also regulatory cells amongst which regulatory T (Treg) cells play a key role. The graft facilitating eff ect associated with the absence of NKT cells did not require Treg cells and was mediated by the selective expansion of CD11b+Gr-1int myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) during hematopoietic reconstitution. The MDSC thus generated exhibited an immunosuppressive activity only if recipient mice were transplanted with antigenically diff erent donor HSC. Conclusions: In the absence of NKT, the increased formation of MDSC is solely suffi cient to inhibit HvG by producing Treg cell independent transplantation tolerance. S137 absent or defective neutrophil function (chronic granulomatous disease-CGD). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which aims at producing stable donor engraftment, remains the only curative option for many PIDs. Objective: The aims of this study were to retrospectively analyze the variables aff ecting chimerism and to determine the impact of mixed chimerism (MC) on immune reconstitution, outcome and prognosis for patients with MC post-HSCT for PIDs, at Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, between 2000 and 2012. Patients and Methods: Included were 19 patients (10 boys, 9 girls) who had full or partial engraftment of donor hematopoietic SC, survived more than six months post-HSCT for PIDs, and had a mean age of 42 months (range, 1-180 months). Median followup was 114.3 months (range, 6-144 months). SC source: three related peripheral blood SC (PBSC), three haploidentical-PBSC, four unrelated cord blood (CB), nine related bone marrow (BM). All patients were subsequently divided into two groups according to immunodefi ciency type: group A (12) -PIDs with SCID (10 SCID, 2 Omenn syndrome); group B (9) -other PIDs \"non-SCID\" (3 CGD, 3 X-lymphoproliferative syndrome-XLP, 1 WAS). MC was defi ned as having host hematopoietic cells of 1-99% at any time post-HSCT. Donor chimerism was measured by STR and SGM plus kit. Variables tested for eff ects on MC included patient age, PID category, numbers of infused CD34+, source of SC, degree of HLA match and conditioning regimen. Immune reconstitution was retrospectively analyzed using clinical follow-up, diff erential white blood count, quantitative immunoglobulins, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and CD19 B cells. Ten (41.7%) of 19 transplanted patients were diagnosed with MC. Only one (10%) patient (WAS) with MC developed prolonged hypo\u03b3globulinemia post-HSCT. Conclusion: Stable MC post-HSCT in PIDs is common, provide stable immune reconstitution of both T-and B-cell function, suffi cient to cure the PIDs, similar to full chimerism, and might be a strategic observation for gene therapy. Graft rejection is higher among patients with MC less than 30% donor cells. Lower rates of GVHD and no related morbidity or mortality with stable MC was observed.",

Kalupa, J. Mengwasser, K. Riesner, A. Wilke, R. Arnold, O. Penack Charit\u00e9 Berlin (Berlin, DE) Background: Recent clinical studies indicate that anti T cell globulin (ATG) can decrease the incidence of GVHD without increasing leukemia relapse rates, raising the question whether ATG induces T cell independent anti tumor eff ects. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), mediated by NK cells, is a relevant therapeutic mechanism of antibody mediated immunotherapy against cancer. Despite its broad clinical use, the eff ect of ATG on ADCC has not been studied in detail. Methods/Results: To investigate the eff ect of ATG on ADCC, we have established a fl ow-cytometry based method based on detection of CD107a as a marker for NK-cell degranulation. We fi rst confi rmed that the degranulation of NK cells correlated closely with ADCC, as assessed by standard cytotoxicity assays. We then investigated the eff ect of anti-Jurkat rabbit ATG (Fresenius Biotech, Gr\u00e4felfi ng, Germany) on ADCC against diff erent human hematologic malignancies: Acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60, K562), follicular lymphoma (Karpas 422), Burkitt\u203as Lymphoma (Raji), chronic lymphoid leukemia (EHEB), mantle cell lymphoma (JeKo-1) and T/ NK cell leukemia (YT). We found that ATG induced high amounts of ADCC not only towards T cell lymphoma/leukemia, but also against AML and diff erent B-cell lymphomas ( Fig.1 and Fig.2 ). The maximum ADCC was reached at a relatively low concentration of 20\u03bcg/ml ATG. Discussion: Our data suggest that ATG augments T cell independent anti tumor eff ects, providing a possible explanation for favorable clinical data on leukemia relapse rates after HSCT. The ability of ATG to induce ADCC against a broad variety of hematologic malignancies, as opposed to exclusively having eff ects on T cell derived malignancies, is most likely explained by eff ects of non T cell specifi c IgG. Interestingly, serum concentrations of non specifi c rabbit IgG at day +60 after HSCT in patients treated with 30mg/Kg ATG-F were well above 20\u03bcg/ml (Mastaglio, EBMT 2009), indicating that ADCC may be increased for a long period after ATG infusion. In our previous work, however, we found that high concentrations of ATG (found early after ATG infusion) resulted in depletion of NK cells and deterioration of NK cell function in vitro as well as in vivo (Transpl Immunol. 2007 Nov; 18:85, Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Feb; 41:377) . These data demonstrating a diff erential impact of ATG on NK cells and ADCC may be useful for development of HSCT strategies working with NK cell mediated anti tumor eff ects. Background: Reconstitution of the immune system following allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a complex process that requires successful engraftment of the hematopoietic stem cell, as well as adequate thymic function. Although GVHD control, improvements in antibiotic spectra, and circumspection in the use of immunosuppressants have helped, too many patients still die of infections because of insuffi cient immunologic recovery. Sirolimus has been used alone and in combination with calcineurin inhibitors for prevention of allograft rejection after solid organ transplantation. In the fi eld of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the combination of sirolimus and tacrolimus has also resulted in a low incidence of acute GVHD and reduced transplant-related toxicity. Methods: We evaluated the immune recovery status of 24 patients who received the combination of sirolimus and tacrolimus as a GvHD prophylaxis compared to a historical control (n=21) using tacrolimus and methotrexate (MTX). They were conditioned with myeloablative regimens. Results: The incidence of acute GVHD in patients with sirolimus based regimen was lower. And the incidence of CMV or EBV reactivation in the same group was higher. The recovery of CD4+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells seemed to be more delayed in recipients with sirolimus based regimen compared to those in patients with tacrolimus and MTX at 1 month after transplantation (8.8 \u00b1 1.6 vs 14.9 \u00b1 5.8 for CD4+ T cells, 35.7 \u00b1 6.4 vs 53.4 \u00b1 19.6 for NK cells). However, there was no signifi cant diff erence between in the recovery of CD4+ T cells and NK cells at 3 months after transplantation. In the aspect of humoral immunity, there was a trend to be lower in immunoglobulin-A and Ig-M levels during 1 month and 3 months after transplantation in patients with sirolimus based regimen. This diff erence was overcome around post-transplant 6 months. And regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) seemed to be higher in patients with sirolimus based regimen. Conclusion: The sirolimus based regimen is associated with wellcontrolled acute GvHD. Although the correlation between the increased risk of infection and delayed immune reconstitution was not confi rmed, the regimen might be cause of increasing the risk of opportunistic infection. Therefore we need an eff ort of early tapering of immunosuppressants and a careful monitoring for opportunistic infections in patients received sirolimus based regimen.",

Graft source was bone marrow in 94 and peripheral blood in 18 patients. 38 patients received grafts from matched sibling donors (MSD), whereas 74 were transplanted from matched unrelated donors (MUD). The median donor age was 27.4 years and in 47 patients the donor was <25 years. A total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning was used in 72 patients, whereas 39 received chemotherapy. Virus prophylaxis consisted of acyclovir in 63 and gancyclovir in 32 patients (Overview: Table 1 ). Engraftment was defi ned as the fi rst of three consecutive days with neutrophil counts >0.5x10 9 /L peripheral blood. The impact of the total number of infused CD34+ cells and of myeloid CD34+ cells (CD34+/ CD45dim/CD19neg/CD10neg) infused per kg recipient weight, donor age and origin (MSD vs. MUD), conditioning (TBI-based vs. chemotherapy based), and type of preemptive antiviral therapy on NE kinetics were evaluated. Results: Median time to NE for all 112 patients was 20 days (range: 10-40) after receiving a median of 4.1x10 6 /kg total CD34+ cells and 2.4x10 6 /kg myeloid CD34+ cells respectively. Patients given a low dose of total CD34+ cells (<3x10 6 /kg) engrafted equally to those given 3-6x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells or more. Likewise, the number of infused myeloid CD34+ cells did not correlate with NE. Stem cell source, donor age, conditioning, and antiviral agents did not seem to have an impact on NE. (Table 1) . Interestingly, patients transplanted from MSD engrafted earlier than those from MUD (median 17.5 days vs. 21 days; p=0.034). A subgroup analysis of MUD recipients moreover revealed a positive correlation between NE and total CD34+ cell numbers but not for myeloid CD34+ subsets. Conclusion: The median NE in our cohort was signifi cantly faster for MSD recipients, whereas neither the graft content of total CD34+ nor of the myeloid CD34+ cells had an impact on engraftment kinetics. The evaluation of donor age, stem cell source, conditioning or antiviral agents revealed no signifi cant infl uence on NE.",

Andreola, F. Gigli, A. Gardellini, P. Mancuso, S. Liptrott, M. Negri, G. Martinelli, R. Pastano European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Haploidentical bone marrow transplantation using high-dose, post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) has been shown to be a feasible approach for patients lacking an HLA identical donor. In the attempt to reduce the associated risk of graft failure, relapse incidence and to boost immune recovery we decided to apply the same conditioning regimen using unmanipolated G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). From July 2010 to October 2012, 13 patients, aff ected by high-risk hematological malignancies received Cy, fl udarabine and TBI followed by infusion of haploidentical PBSC; post-transplant immunosuppression consisted of high-dose Cy on days +3 and +4, tacrolimus and micofenolate mofetile. At a median follow-up of 143 days (36-758), grade II acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) developed in 1 patient, no chronic GvHD occurred in 8 evaluable patients and no graft failure was observed. Achievement of full donor chimerism was complete on CD3+ cells since day +28 in 8/13 evaluable patients, by day +84 in 9/11. CMV reactivation occurred in 10/12 patients at risk for reactivation at a median time of 34 days posttransplant and resolved with pre-emptive antiviral therapy in 9 patients; one heavily pretreated patient died of a fatal infection. Flow cytometry was used to monitor lymphocyte recovery on PB. Available data on 6 patients on day +56 show a median of CD3+ of 730 (160-1427) cells/\u03bcL, CD3+CD4+ of 213 (126-315), CD3+CD8+ of 487 (34-1112), which remained stable through day +84. Data on 3 patients on day +356 show recovery to values close or above normal: CD3+ 1304 CD3+ , 393, 1907 CD3+CD4+ 348, 244, 527; CD3+CD8+ 957, 148 , 1380 cells/\u03bcL. Notably, a very high proportion of recovering CD3+CD4+ cells expressed high levels of CD25, were CD27 low/negative and positive for FoxP3 (T regs): indeed on day +84 median percentage of T reg was 6.2% (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) out of total number of CD4+ cells, higher than in healthy donors. High percentage of Tregs persisted through day +365 on the 3 evaluable patients. This is the fi rst report showing that haploidentical non-myeloablative PBSC transplantation with high-dose post-transplant Cy allows a rapid and sustained engraftment, a fast and complete lymphocyte recovery and it is not associated with major infections. We can postulate that the high recovery of T regs might be involved in the low incidence of GvHD. CMV reactivation remains a critical issue; further studies are needed to clarify recovery of CMV immunity and to establish better prophylaxis therapy. Transplantation of cord blood units as a stem cell source is increasingly used for the treatment of acute leukemias if HLA identical donors are lacking. Aside from graft versus host disease and relapse, infections considerably infl uence outcomes. Especially reactivation of herpes viruses such as CMV and EBV impact on mortality. We therefore monitored T-cell reconstitution of patients (n=6) after double cord blood transplantation (dUCBT) and compared our results to patients (n=65) receiving HLA matched G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear stem cells (PBSC). All patients were analyzed by 7 color fl ow cytometry on days 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 after transplantation. Using a standardized protocol we determined absolute cell counts of monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-and NK-cells. In addition, HLA A2 positive samples were analyzed with multimers to detect CD8+ T-cells specifi c CMV peptides (VLE, NLV) and EBV peptides (GLC, CLG, YVL). Reactivation of CMV and EBV was monitored weekly in the peripheral blood by quantitative PCR, chimerism was assessed by PCR of single nucleotide polymorphism. Comparison of both groups revealed principal diff erences in immune reconstitution of T-, B-and NK-cells, reactivation of CMV and EBV, and the achievement of full donor chimerism. All dUCBT patients reached full donor chimerism on day +30. CMV was reactivated in 27/65 PBSCT and in 4/6 dUCBT recipients. None of the dUCBT, but 19/65 PBSCT recipients reactivated EBV. CD8+ T-cells numerically reached normal levels on day +60 in PBSCT recipients (mean 536\u00b1792), whereas recipients of dUCBT generally displayed low counts during the follow up period of 180 days. Analyzing CMV and EBV specifi c CD8+ T-cells, dUCBT recipients displayed increasing numbers of CMV specifi c CD8+ T-cell counts on day +90, when CMV reactivation occurred before day +60. In contrast, in PBSC patients counts rose from day +60 to higher levels along with normalization of total CD8+ T-cell counts. B-cell counts normalized in dUCBT patients on day +90 (mean=468\u00b1531), but remained low in PBSCT recipients long time during the follow up, especially when Rituximab was used for treatment of EBV reactivation and/or steroids for graft versus host disease. Better survival occurred in PBSCT patients with early elevated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts. High B-cell counts on day +30 also correlated with better survival (p=0,073) but increased the probability of EBV reactivation (p=0,002).",

Chwieduk, W. Fidyk, T. Kruzel, M. Sadus-Wojciechowska, T. Czerw, I. Mitrus, A. Smagur, L. Miszczyk, J. Holowiecki M. Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute, Gliwice Branch (Gliwice, PL) Stem cells present in the graft are predominant source of T cell recovery after HSCT. The process, however, requires proper function of the thymus, which may be negatively aff ected by many factors including toxicity of the conditioning regimen. Experimental data suggest that irradiation may be more harmful to the thymus compared to myeloablative chemotherapy. The goal of the current analysis was to verify this hypothesis in a clinical setting of autologous HSCT. The thymic function was evaluated by enumeration of circulating recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) determined by fl ow cytometry as CD4+CD31+CD45RA+CD62L+ cells. It was done before start of conditioning and on day +100 after autoHSCT. A total of 57 patients with hematologic malignancies (MM, n=32; NHL, n=22; other, n=3) were included in the study. Median age was 57 years. Patients were divided in 4 groups according to the type of conditioning: total body irradiation (TBI, 12 Gy) monotherapy (n=20), TBI + CHT (n=11), total marrow irradiation (TMI) monotherapy (n=11) and chemotherapy alone (BEAM or high-dose melphalan, n=15). The groups did not diff er in terms of age. CD34+ cell dose was signifi cantly higher for TBI+CHT compared with remaining groups. RTEs could be detected in peripheral blood of all subjects prior to HSCT (median 21, range 2-261 cells/uL) with no signifi cant differences between groups (Kruskall-Wallis test, p=0.95). On day +100 after autoHSCT the highest number of circulating RTEs was observed for TBI alone (9, 2-36 /uL) followed by TMI alone (7, 2-15 /uL) , CHT alone (5, 2-24 /uL) and TBI+CHT (3, 0-14 /uL) (Kruskall-Wallis test, p=0.03). In the post-hoc analysis (U Mann-Whitney test) the values for TBI alone were signifi cantly higher compared to TBI+CHT (p=0.01) and tended to be higher compared to CHT alone (p=0.11). Analysis of lymphocyte subsets on day +100 revealed no diff erences between groups for the number of circulating T CD4+ cells (p=0.41), T CD8+ cells (p=0.52) and B cells (p=0.24). The number of Treg cells tended to be lower for TBI+CHT compared to other groups (p=0.07) and the number of NK cells was lower for TBI alone than for other groups (p=0.003). We conclude that conditioning regimens have variable impact on thymic function after autoHSCT. As opposed to previously published data from animal models we demonstrated that TBI itself is not more harmful to the thymus than high-dose chemotherapy. In contrast, the addition of chemotherapy to irradiation increases signifi cantly the toxicity. Introduction: Dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in antileukemia and antitumor response through T cell-mediated tumor destruction. Objective: In order to evaluate the impact of DC immune reconstitution patterns following SCT on acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD), relapse and as a consequence the infl uence of those in survival we performed DC quantifi cation in both peripheral blood (PB) post SCT and the underlying graft. Methods: Myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmocytoid DC (pDC) were quantifi ed using 5 color fl owcytometry in single platform approach in the PB of 42 healthy donors (range 4-57yr), bone marrow (BM) and CD3/19 depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. In addition DC subpopulations were measured in PB at day +30, +60, +90, +120, +180 post alloSCT in 35 children and young adults (20 male/15 female, range 1-27yr) suff ering from acute leukemia (n=26) or solid tumor (n=9). Median follow-up period was 18.1 months (range 2-68). Results: Absolute numbers of mDCs in BM grafts (n=21) did not diff er from those in CD 3/19 depleted PBSCs (n=21). In contrast pDCs were signifi cant higher in the CD 3/19 depleted PBSCs. We observed a fast immune reconstitution of mDC and pDC in patients diagnosed with acute leukemia and receiving BM grafts compared to those patients suff ering form leukemia or solid tumor and receiving a PBSC graft. Most importantly, at the time points +60, +90, +120, +180 post alloSCT there was a signifi cant diff erence between survivors and non-survivors in the absolute number of both mDC and pDC. Low pDC and mDC count was associated with an increased death rate post SCT when using Kaplan-Maier estimator for the overall patients group and for the leukemia group. Conclusion: Our fi rst results showed both diff erences in DC subpopulations between BM grafts and CD3/19 depleted PBSC grafts and suggests that higher numbers of DCs post alloSCT may improve patient survival. However, this needs further investigations in larger and more homogenous patient cohort. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from an unrelated donor, both voluntary adult (VUD) and cord blood (CB), is a well established strategy for patients with hematological disease lacking a sibling HLA identical matched donor. However, this procedure is associated with increased morbidity and mortality because of graft versus host disease (GVHD), slow recovery of immunity and a high risk of infections.We analyzed the immune reconstitution profi le of 31 consecutive pts receiving CB allo-HSCT (December 2006-June 2012)and 28 pts receiving VUD allo-HSCT (November 2009-May 2012) was analyzed by fl ow cytometry study performed at 3, 6, 9 and 12months after transplantation and then every 6 months. In the fi rst group of pts, the median age was 41 years(range 16-66), 24/31 pts received a myeloablative conditioning regimen; 22/31 received antithymocyte globulin as GVHD prophylaxis ; 26 were single unit transplant, 5 double unit cord blood transplants, median number of TNC infused was 2.28 x 107/kg, median number of CD34 infused was 3.09 x 105/kg. In the VUD group, the median age was 48.5 years(range 18-60), conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 19/28 pts; 27/28 received antithymocyte globulin as GVHD prophylaxis; the stem cell source was bone marrow (BM) in 7 pts, peripheral stem cells (PB) in 21 pts; median TNC infused was 2.17 x 108/kg and 8.79 x 108/kg respectively in BM and PB, median CD34 infused was 2.59 x 106/kg and 7.97 x 106/kg respectively in BM and PB. On 22 evaluable patient in the CB cohort and on 20 pts in the VUD cohort, the number of patients achieving a CD3 count > 0.5 x 109/l pts within 6 months from HSCT was 12 vs 17 in the CB and VUD group, also no diff erence at 6 months was observed in number of pts achieving CD4 count> 0.2 x 109/l (10 vs 8) and CD56 count > 0.1 x 109/l (20 vs 16) in the two groups. Signifi cant diff erence was observed in the CD8+ and in the CD19 + reconstitution: at 6 months from transplantation a larger number of patients in the VUD group achieved CD8>0.25 x 109/l (8 vs 18; CB vs VUD respectively; p=0.003) while a larger number of patients in the CB group achieved CD19>0.2 x 109/l (12 vs 3; CB vs VUD respectively; p=0.025). No signifi cant diff erence was observed in term of GVHD incidence (17 vs 10) , CMV (17 vs 15) and EBV (4 vs 7) reactivation between the two groups.These data are coherent with those reported in literature and the diff erences in CD8+ and CD19+ cell recovery, in our case, did not refl ect in diff erent incidence of GVHD or viral reactivation.",

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for SCA. To analyze immunoematological reconstitution after transplant, we report our experience concerning 12 geno-identical HSCT for SCA-patients prepared with the same myeloablative conditioning regiment consisting of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide. Patients and Methods: Twelve patients with a median age of 12 years (range, 2-16), aff ected by sickle cell anemia (SCA), received hematopoietic stem cell transplantations from HLAidentical, related donors following a myeloablative conditioning regimen. To analyse the mechanisms involved in immunological reconstitution post transplant, we analysed T cell subsets by fl ow cytometry at + 60 post transplant. Results: All patients had sustained engraftment and remained free of any SCA-related events after transplantation. Sixty days after the transplant, the patients had signifi cantly lower CD4+ T cells in comparison to the controls (15.6 \u00b1 5.9 % vs. 47.5 \u00b1 6% respectively), whereas CD8+ T cells were the fi rst lymphocytes to repopulate the peripheral blood with up to 45% of these cells being CD8+ T cells (in mean 48.5 \u00b1 14.3 % vs. 20 \u00b1 7%). All patients displayed reduced numbers of B cells versus normal value, and 10/12 patients had only 0% to 1% of control levels of CD19+ cells. CD3-CD56+ bright NK cells were 18.6 \u00b1 12.2 %, whereas CD3-CD16+ (with cytotoxic functions) were 16.7 \u00b1 11.8 %. Conclusion: Our primary fi nding include the following: 1) rapid increase of lymphocytes in peripheral blood after transplant; 2) rapid expansion of CD8+ T cell but not CD4 T cell counts. Probably reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, observed in 11/12 patients on the early stages of T-lymphocyte recovery after transplant, might induce a dramatic increase in CD8 but not in CD4 T-cell counts. Background: Pediatric obesity has become a world-wide epidemic. It is known to increase morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). There is limited information on its eff ect on engraftment among children receiving allogeneic HSCT. Body mass index (BMI) is a reliable indicator of body fatness. Previous studies have shown confl icting correlation between BMI and time to engraftment. In children, BMI-percentile is the recommended indicator of body fatness. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the correlation between time to engraftment and BMI and BMI-percentile in children undergoing HSCT. Methods: Height, body weight, age and time to engraftment of all children who underwent allogeneic HSCT at our institution between 2006 and 2010 were obtained from the health records. BMI-percentile was obtained using BMI for age, growth chart by gender from the Centers for Disease Control. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the BMI percentile; group 1 <5%, group 2 \u22655% but \u226495% and group 3 at >95%. A Cox regression analysis of the 3 groups was done for BMI-percentile. A Linear regression analysis was done for correlations between BMI and time to engraftment. Results: 178 allogeneic HSCT patients were included. 11 children failed to engraft and were excluded from the analysis. No correlation between graft-failure and either BMI or BMI-percentile was observed. In a linear regression analysis time to engraftment was a function of the patients BMI (fi gure 1). There was a signifi cant correlation between higher BMI and shorter time to engraftment. Similarly, on a cox regression analysis group 3(>95% BMIpercentile) was associated with a shortened time to engraftment (fi gure 2). On survival analysis (time to engraftment, 100 day survival and overall survival) the BMI percentile group did not emerge as signifi cant. Conclusions: Though obesity is known to have a negative eff ect on HSCT, we found high BMI/ BMI-percentile to correlate with shorter time to engraftment. As BMI-percentile is a more accurate parameter for obesity in children, our results showed positive eff ect of BMI-percentile on time to engraftment.",

Alkadhimi (2) (1)University of Kentucky (Lexington, US); (2) Karmanos Cancer center (Detroit, US) Introduction: Alemtuzumab (AB) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) are two of the common drugs used to reduce the risk of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT). Not much is known about the diff erences in immune reconstitution between these agents. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated lymphocyte (ALC) recovery at days 30, 60 and 90 post allo-HCT in patients (pts)who received Rabbit ATG and AB. Pts in ATG group received Tacrolimus (Tac), Sirolimus and ATG (4.5 mg/kg) for GVHD prophylaxis. Pts in AB group received AB (60 mg) with Tac and Methotrexate. ATG group was treated at Karmanos cancer center between June 2008-December 2010 while AB group was treated between January 2010 and May 2012 at Markey cancer center. The primary end point of the study was to evaluate the difference in ALC recovery between AB and ATG and to evaluate the impact of ALC on transplant outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models using stepwise selection were used for time to event analysis and repeated measured mixed models were used to evaluate predictors of ALC over the 3 observed time points. Results: There were 30 pts in AB group and 47 in ATG group. Median follow up was 239 and 444 days in AB and ATG groups respectively (p=0.07). Pt characteristics are described in Table 1 . Infused CD34 count was higher (P\u22640.001) in ATG group (7.31 million /kg) compared to AB group (4 million/kg).Both groups were also different with respect donor recipient sex (P=0.004) and HLA mismatch (p<0.001). ALC was higher in ATG group compared to AB at day 30, 60 and 90 (p<0.001). After adjusting for study group, there was increased hazard of death for ALC day 90 < 400x 103/ml (p=0.048). Significant ALC predictors in a repeated measures model included interaction between time and study (p=0.038) when adjusted for Recipient CMV status and HLA mismatch. There was also increased risk of developing aGVHD (p=0.018), and CMV reactivation (0.045) in AB group using competing risk models to adjust for relapse or death events. The hazard of developing cGVHD was reduced in AB group (p=0.001). Conclusion: We determined that ALC is higher in pts who received ATG for T cell depletion compared to AB and this diff erence remains signifi cant over diff erent time points. There is also increased hazard of death in pts with ALC <400 103/ml at day 90 after allo-HCT. These are preliminary fi ndings which need to be confi rmed in a larger prospective study.",

Malladi, P. Moss University of Birmingham (Birmingham, GB) Stem cell transplant (SCT) is an accepted strategy for the treatment of high risk haematological disease and involves replacement of the recipient's immune system with that of an HLA matched individual. T-cell reconstitution post-SCT is critical in induction of both the graft versus leukaemia eff ect (GVL), and graft versus host disease (GVHD), and thus in determining the outcome of SCT. However, as thymic output is limited in adult leukaemia patients, thymic-independent pathways, primarily homeostatic proliferation, will be key to the shaping of the adaptive immune response.",

Cerezo-Manchado, A. Mart\u00ednez, C. Castilla-Llorente, I. Heras, F. de Arriba, P. Iniesta, M. Osma, F. Ortu\u00f1o, V. Vicente Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Immune reconstitution impairment after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is one of the main pitfalls of this procedure and is matter of intense recent research. Among the main target of recent studies are lymphocyte populations because of their impact on overall survival (OS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM). However, this relationship is not fully elucidated. Aims: To determine the impact of the diff erent lymphocytes populations overtime in peripheral blood of patients undergoing HCT. Patients and Methods: Retrospective study of patients undergoing HCT at our institution from 2005 to 2010. Data were collected for peripheral blood concentration of immunoglobulins, leukocytes and total lymphocytes and concentrations per microliter (\u03bcl) of lymphocyte subsets CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+, CD3-/CD56+ and CD19+, on days +30, +60, +100, +180, +360 and +720. Data on pre and postransplant clinical parameters were also collected. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: 108 consecutive patients were included. We performed a univariate analysis for OS at 1 year, variables with p<0.1 were included: age, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), CMV infection and concentrations of CD3+/CD4+, CD3+, CD3-CD56+, CD3+/ CD8+ on day +30, and the CD3+/CD4+ on day +100. A model was built in which chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and concentration of CD3+/ CD4+ on day +30 remained the only variables statistically signifi cant, p<0.05. To improve this model, ROC curves were created for each concentration of lymphocytes and the best cutoff points were chosen. The concentration of 90/\u03bcl of CD3+/CD4+ on day +30 was the most relevant cutoff point, with an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.96-0.74), sensitivity and specifi city of 0.82 and 0.85 respectively. All the cutoff points were used to create a new multivariate model in which only cGVHD (p<0.05) and the cutoff of 90/\u03bcl for CD3+/CD4+ on day +30 (p= 0.044), hazard ratio (HR) (5.7 95% CI, 1,04-31) were signifi cant for OS on day +360. Patients who did not reach the cutoff suff ered greater TRM (p=0.013) HR (7.5 95% CI, . The study at 2 years showed that this cutoff remained signifi cant for both OS and TRM (p= 0.032), HR (6.1 95% CI, 1.2-31) and (p=0.045) HR (5.7 95% CI, 1.04-32), respectively. Conclusions: Our results support the relationship between immune reconstitution, OS and TRM. The 90/\u03bcl cutoff for CD3+/ CD4+ on day +30 is able to predict those events in both the fi rst and second year post-transplant. Following haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),donor alloreactive natural killer(NK)cells favorably infl uence the outcome of transplanted patients by triggering graft versus leukemia (GvL)eff ects.The molecular mechanism underlying the GvL activity of NK cells is due to KIR/HLA class I disparity between donor/recipient pairs. KIR genotypes are important in controlling KIR repertoire. Furthermore, the activation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by polymorphic CD16 antigens may potentiate the GvL eff ect of NK cells. Following unmanipulated non T cell depleted HSCT, we evaluated(i)KIR genotype profi ling during immune reconstitution; (ii) reconstitution of KIR loci on the basis of donor KIR genotypes and (iii) polymorphisms of FCGR3A according to 158V/F and 48 L/ H/R in 16 donor/recipient pairs. DNA and RNA were isolated from peripheral blood using spin bind method and cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using RNA as template and random primers. KIR genotyping and gene expression profi ling were performed using a KIR SSP typing kit which detects 17 KIR genes. Sequence based typing (SBT) assay was used to determine the FCGRIIIA-48 and -158 polymorphisms. Four pts developed severe acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD),1pt relapsed and 8 pts deceased for GvHD, relapse or infections. Six of 16 pts had more than 2 KIRligand mismatches in GvH direction. Examining KIR profi les in recipient-donor pairs, we found that all framework genes (2DL4, 3DL2, 3DL3, 3DP1)were present in both donor and recipient cells, exhibiting at least one inhibitory KIR. During recipients hematopoietic recovery, we observed rapid appearance of donors KIR profi les. Only 1 pt with signs of GVHD and relapse did not reach full NK cell chimerism. During KIR reconstitution monitoring, we noted diff erent levels of 3DL1, 2DS1, 2DL2, 2DL3 KIR expression and 2DS4ins, 2DS2, 2DS3, 3DL3 KIR loss. Analysis of FCGRIIIA polymorphisms showed that 25% and 31% of patients and donors were homozygous for FCGRIIIA-158V allele, 75% and 69% were heterozygous carriers (V/F) and none of two groups was FCGRIIIA-158 F/F. For the FCGRIIIA-48 polymorphism, L/L, (68% and 75%), L/H, (6.2% and 6.2%), L/R, (19% and 12.5%); H/R (6% and 0%) were the detected genotypes. A clear linkage between the FCGRIIIA-48 and FCGRIIIA-158 polymorphisms (10/16 patients with the FCGRIIIA-158F/V were also FCGRIIIA-48L/L).",

The eff ectiveness and safety of pegylated-GCSF after autologous transplant has been demonstrated in several studies while few reports exist in the allogenic setting. We compared 17 patients (pts) treated with pegylated-GCSF, -6 mg in a single dose on day+4, to an historical control cohort of 45 pts who were treated with daily GCSF-Lenogastrim-from day+2 continued until neutrophil recovery after allogenic transplantation. Patients' characheristics are listed in Table 1 . Eight (27%)pts in GCSF and nine(83%) in the pegylated-GCSF treated group received a previous autologous transplantation, (p<0,001). The patients were well matched regarding the clinical and biological characteristics. The outcome of the transplant are shown in table II. Graft failure was observed in 15% and 12% of GCSF and pegylated-GCSF group,respectivel y(p=0.77). Neutrophil engraftment (ANC>1x10 9 /litre) was significantly faster (p<0,05)in the pegylated-GCSF group with a median of 12 days compared with 15 days in the LENOGASTRIM group,fi g 1.No diff erence was observed concerning platelet engraftment. The variables statistically signifi cant for a faster neutrophil engraftment were, both in univariate and multivariate analysis, the use of pegylated-GCSF (p<0,05) and the disease status at transplantation (p<0,03), whereas number of infused CD34+ cells (\u22654x10 6 /Kg) was a signifi cant factor only in univariate analysis. The incidence of neutropenic fever was similar in the two cohorts of pts. The median number of febrile neutropenic days was 3 in the GCSF and 4 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) in the pegylated-GCSF group (p=0.422). No diff erence was observed regarding the duration of intravenous antibiotics (p=0.413) and about the response to fi rst line antibiotic therapy (p=0.55). Incidence of acute or chronic GvHD, mucosites and diarrhea was similar. The TRM at +100 days was 27% for GCSF and 29% for pegylated-GCSF treated pts (p=0.5). Also, no diff erences were seen regarding response rate at +90 after transplantation (p=0,71). At a median follow-up of 268 days (range 4-2674) no signifi cant diff erence was seen in estimated 2yEFS (40%; p=0.9). We conclude that pegylated-GCSF was associated with faster neutrophil engraftment after allogeneic SCT, without any diff erences observed regarding the outcome of the allogenic transpant procedure.",

Bertz, J. Finke Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, DE) Immune status assessment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation relies primarily on immunophenotypic analyses of T and B lymphocytes. However, this kind of approach does not analyze their functional capacity. Intracellular ATP levels in stimulated CD4 T-helper cells have been reported as an immune function marker in immunosuppressed patients undergoing solid organ transplantation. Nevertheless, few reports exist describing this functional marker in allogeneic hematopoietic SCT. Our aim was to compare the intracellular ATP content in stimulated CD4 cells with routine immunophenotypic analysis and their potential associations with the patient clinical status. A total of 45 samples from 39 patients were collected at fi xed time points after transplant (30, 100 and 365 days). Six patients were evaluated at day 30 and 100. Whole blood was stimulated for 18 hours with phytohemaglutinin. After stimulation CD4+ T cells were isolated, lysed and the intracellular ATP content was measured using a luciferin/luciferase mixture in a luminometer. A calibration curve was generated with ATP calibrators. A control group of 16 healthy volunteers was used as a reference. Mean ATP concentrations were 71, 190 and 230 ng/ml at 30, 100 and 365 days post transplant respectively. The mean ATP level in the control group was 300 ng/ml. No correlation was found between the number of white blood cells, CD3 and CD4 lymphocytes and the intracellular ATP content. In addition, there was no correlation between ATP levels and the regimen for GvHD prophylaxis or cyclosporine concentration. No signifi cant increase in ATP level was found in patients with acute GvHD. At day 30 all patients showed a low CD4 count and ATP content as well, while at day 100 the CD4 count was normal in 25% of the patients but all of them showed a low ATP level. At day 100 almost 90% of the patients with a normal white blood cell count and CD4 count but low intracellular ATP level showed clinical complications such as CMV reactivation, infections or relapse. Although, our patient group is small and clinically heterogeneous low ATP seems to indicate higher risk of post-transplant complications such as CMV reactivation, infections or relapse.",

Trestman, L. Gepstein, F. Aviv, E. Naparstek Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv, IL) Objective: Monitor lymphocyte recovery by consecutive measurements of absolute lymphocyte counts 3 to 6 months (ALC 3-6) after autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and correlate the level of reconstitution with transplant outcomes. Methods: Median ALC 3-6 post transplant was determined for each patient and the median of medians for autologous and allogeneic transplants were calculated. Patients were divided into two groups based on high or low (in respect to the median of medians) ALC 3-6. Patient, disease, conditioning and graftrelated variables were compared by appropriate statistics. Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Prognostic value of ALC 3-6 was assessed by Cox's regression model. Results: Median ALC 3-6 for autologous (105) and allogeneic (69) transplants was 1.3 x 10 9 and 1.08 x 10 9 cells/L, respectively. High ALC 3-6 was associated with better OS in autologous (median 61.9 months in the high group vs. 34.8 in the low group, p=0.04) and allogeneic (median 39.5 months in the high group vs. 13.2 in the low one, p=0.03) patients. Improved DFS (p=0.01) in the allogeneic high ALC 3-6 group was observed only for patients with acute leukemia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated high ALC 3-6 to be an independent prognostic factor for better OS and DFS in autologous transplants (p=0.001, CI 95% 0.314-0.749, p=0.03, CI 95% 0.968-0.434, respectively). Both autologous and allogeneic high and low groups did not diff er regarding engraftment, infectious complications and veno-occlusive disease of the liver. In autologous transplants, grade 4 mucositis was signifi cantly higher in the low ALC 3-6 group, while in the allogeneic transplants, low ALC 3-6 was associated with grade III/IV acute graft versus host disease. Conclusion: High ALC 3-6 after autologous and allogeneic HSCT correlates signifi cantly with a better survival.

            "text": "Association of Foxp3 expression with haematological recovery after high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation T. Wrobel, J. Dzietczenia, E. Stefanko, I. Deren-Wagemann, M. Biedron, R. Poreba, K. Kuliczkowski Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) Foxp3 is a specifi c marker of natural T regulatory cells (Tregs).Some data demonstrate that various T-cells populations including Tregs participate in hematological recovery.Tregs can regulate hematopoiesis based on cytokine eff ector molecules they can produce. The hematological recovery after transplantation is important prognostic factor and is associated with survival of patients with hematological malignancies. The aim of study was to evaluate the expression of Foxp3 and its association with hematological recovery in patients with lymphoid malignancies after high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). 30 patients with lymphoid malignancies were included in the study. The median age of patients was 58 years (range:27-65 years).20 patients had multiple myeloma and 10 had non Hodgkin lymphoma. All patients underwent ASCT. Before ASCT complete remission was confi rmed in 10 patients and 20 patients achieved partial remission. We investigated the expression of Foxp3 of Tregs present in the peripheral blood before high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT. The mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were separated by density-gradient centrifugation. The phenotype of T cells was evaluated with antibodies:FITC-conjugated antiCD3, antiCD8, antiCD14, antiCD19, aniCD25 and antiFoxp3; PE-conjugated antiCD4 and antiCD56.Three-colour immunofl uorescence stainging was performed. The expression of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T lymphocytes was analyzed on PAS fl ow cytometer. The results were statistically analyzed using STATISTICA 8.0.Statistical analysis was performed by means of Mann-Whitney's U-test and p<0,05 indicated a signifi cant diff erence. All patients engrafted after transplantation. The median time to ANC>0,5x109/L was 15 days (range: 10-22 days) and the median time of platelets engraftment (> 20 x 109/L) was 12 days (range: 9-16).The expression of Foxp3 on Tregs was signifi cantly higher in patients who achieved absolute neutrophils count before day 15 in comparison with patients who engrafted after day 15 (0,67\u00b10,3 vs 0,48 \u00b1 0,35; p<0,05).Patients who required less than 10 days to achieve platelets count >20 x 109/L had higher expression of Foxp3 on Tregs than patients with platelets engraftment longer than 10 days (0,80\u00b10,34 vs 0,60\u00b10,42; p<0,05).The results are shown in table 1. Our results show that the expression of Foxp3 on Tregs in patients treated with high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT correlates positively with hematological recovery.This observation should be validated by larger study. Recent advances in stem cell manipulation techniques have allowed to optimize cellular composition of HLA-mismatched haploidentical stem cell grafts. Besides the indispensible hematopoietic stem cells, haploidentical grafts now contain a variety of cellular subsets of innate immunity, while \u03b1\u03b2-T-and B-cells are specifi cally depleted in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease and lymphoproliferative disorders. The main innovation in the fi eld is the inclusion of \u03b3\u03b4-T-cells in the graft, which aff ects reconstitution kinetics of early appearing T cells. We analyzed immune and haematopoietic reconstitution in 4 children transplanted with TCRab/CD19-depleted haploidentical stem cell grafts with a special emphasis on \u03b3\u03b4-T-cell reconstitution. Grafts consisted of 8.5x10e6 CD34/kg, 8.8x10e4 CD3TCRab+/kg, 8.8x10e6 CD3T-CRgd+/kg, and 17.5x10e6 CD16+CD56+/kg BW. Haematopoietic reconstitution was rapid and complete in all patients (leuko-cytes>1000/\u03bcl after 11, thrombocytes>20.000/\u03bcl after 14 days). NK cells appeared rapidly (median of 248/\u03bcl on day 30), and decreased to 135/\u03bcl on day +100. T-cell counts reached >100/\u03bcl after a median of 34 days, 75% of these expressing the gd-TCR. The predominance of gd-T-cells decreased and by day +100 50% of T-cells were positive for the gd-TCR and 46% for the ab-TCR. Gd-TCR Immunoscope analysis revealed the molecular composition of the gd-population: the Vg9-chain was expressed by a median of 54%, Vg2 by 17.6% of gd-T-cells, the remaining Vgchains by less than 10%, respectively. Vd4-expressing subclones made up 53% of the whole gd-TCR-repertoire, followed by 33.4% Vd2+ subclones. The remaining Vd-chains were expressed by less than 7% of gd-T-cells. Distribution of gd-subclones was relatively stable over time, so that the contraction of the gd-T-cell population could not be attributed to the disappearance of specifi c Vg-or Vd families. These data provide new insight into the T-cell reconstitution kinetics after TCRab/CD19-depleted transplantation. The clonal distribution of Vg-and Vd-chains must be confi rmed in larger patient cohorts and correlated with clinical events suchs infection and relapse.",

Gromke (1) , A.H. Elmaagacli (2) , M. Ditschkowski (2) , M. Koldehoff (2) , M. Hlinka (2) , N.K. Steckel (2) , D.W. Beelen (2) (1)Universitiy Hospital Essen (Essen, DE); (2)Universitiy Hospital Essen (Essen, DE) Introduction: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, is suspected to increase infections in transplanted patients (pts). Most data refer to organ transplantation but only few relate to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Therefore we analysed the immune reconstitution after SCT under a triple immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine (CSA), prednisone and MMF. Patients and methods: Between 04/2002 and 05/2012 50 pts (male/female: 30/20, median age 50) underwent SCT -11 pts had a related, 39 pts an unrelated donor. All pts developed an insufficiently controlled Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) under medication with CSA and prednisone (GvHD analogous to NIH criteria: 1 pt mild, 42 pts moderate, 7 pts severe). Thus all pts started MMF at a mean time of 440 days (range 33-1599 days) after SCT. The total population of T-cells, T helper cells, memory T cells, B-cells and immunoglobulin G (Ig G) were monitored before and 3 and 6 month and at the longest follow-up date after start of MMF (mean: 901 days). Data were compared to them of 10 pts with a double immunosuppressive medication with CSA and prednisone. The course of GvHD, the dosage of CSA, prednisone and MMF, overall survival and relapse were documented. Results: After start of MMF T-cells neither decreased nor increased signifi cantly during the whole follow-up time. In comparison there was a signifi cant increase of T-cells by a factor of 2,8 under double immunosuppression during a comparable follow-up time. For T helper cells and memory T cells as so as for Ig G there were no signifi cant fi ndings in both groups. B-cells uninfl uenced by MMF increased non-signifi cantly a 1,7 fold more than B-cells under MMF. In the group with triple immunosuppression GvHD was improved in 9, worsened in 7 and unchanged in 34 pts. At a [P586] S149 nearly unchanged dosage of MMF, CSA/prednisone were reduced in 28/38 pts and increased in 9/8pts. 12 pts died, 2 because of relapse, 4 by GvHD, 1 by infection and 5 for other reasons. Conclusion: There is evidence for MMF leading to a signifi cantly delayed T-cell immune reconstitution after SCT. There also seems to be a not clearly signifi cant impairment of B-cell reconstitution. MMF does not seem to improve GvHD but might help to reduce CSA and prednisone faster. Further evaluation of more subpopulations of lymphocytes and character of infections under MMF medication in comparison to an adequate control group is needed.",

So reimmunization is necessary for patients (pts) who underwent SCT. The aim was to examine eff ectiveness of vaccination in SCT pts. Materials and Method: The study was performed between October 2009 and February 2011. Revaccination with inactive and toxoid vaccines commenced \u226512 months and revaccination with live attenuated vaccines commenced \u2265 24 months after SCT. Results: 53,8% of pts were seropositive against diphteria before vaccination. 46,2% of pts were weakly seropositive against diphteria, but all achieved protective antibody (ab) levels after one dose of vaccination. 46,2% and 38,5% of pts were seropositive against tetanus and pertussis before vaccination respectively. After single dose vaccination all seronegative pts against tetanus achieved protective ab levels but only %50 seronegative pts against pertussis achieved protective ab levels. %46,2 of the pts were seropositive against hepatitis B before vaccination, after single dose vaccination 50% seronegative pts achieved protective ab levels. After second dose of vaccination three seronegative pts achieved protective ab levels against hepatitis B. 53,8% of pts were seropositive against hepatitis A before vaccination. After single dose vaccination 83,3% of the pts achieved protective ab levels. The remaining one patient achieved protective ab levels after second dose of vaccination. %15,4 of pts were seropositive against measles before vaccination. After single dose vaccination %60 of pts achieved protective ab levels. Only %50 of pts achieved protective ab levels after second dose of vaccination. %61,5 of pts were seropositive against rubella before vaccination. After single dose vaccination %100 of pts achieved protective ab levels. %46,2 of pts were seropositive against mumps before vaccination. After single dose vaccination %50 of pts achieved protective ab levels. Two pts achieved protective ab levels after second dose of vaccination. %53,8 of pts were seropositive against chicken pox before vaccination. After single dose vaccination %66,7 of pts achieved protective ab levels. Conclusion: Preliminary results showed, pts had very good ab response against diphteria, tetanus, rubella and hepatitis A vaccines. But, protection after pertussis, hepatitis B, measles, varicella zoster and mumps vaccines were in moderate levels. Antibody levels must be followed-up closely.",

Patient and methods: Thirty-nine patients who underwent AHCST in University of Erciyes, Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit were investigated.13 of patients were female (%33,3) and 26 patients were male (%66,6). Samples were obtained from peripheral blood (PB) examined by fl ow cytometric analysis.Ig assays were measured by nephelometric analyze. Sixteen patients had GvHD whereas 23 patient didn't have. Results: The diagnosis of patient were 20 acute myeloid leukemia (%51,2), 11 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (%28,2), 3 Hodgkin lyphoma (%7,6), 5 other diseases (myelodysplastic sydrome, non Hodgkin lyphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia) (%12,8).

Lawitschka (1) We have performed a detailed analysis of the kinetics of immune reconstitution(IR) in pediatric patients(pts) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT) and the impact of chronic graft-versus-host disease(cGVHD) in the long-term follow-up(FU). Peripheral blood samples of 155 pts surviving day +100 were analyzed. Overall blood leukocyte counts, major T cell (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD4/CD8 ratio) and B cell (CD19+, memory, immature) subsets, NK cell numbers (CD56+) as well as serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and IgG subclasses) were determined. Along those lines more than 700 analyses were evaluated at diff erent time points after HSCT, divided into early (<1 year, n=142), and late (>1-10 years, n=563) FU with a median of 97 months (range 5-232). cGVHD pts (n=40) included 12 pts with overlap (30%) and 28 pts (70%) with classic cGVHD and were subdivided according to their clinical features at the time of analysis into active, future and resolved cGVHD . Analyses in all pts showed lower leucocyte (6248 versus(vs) 7058, p<0.001) and lymphocyte (2095 vs 2448, p<0.001) counts between early(n=83) and late FU(n=72). T cells revealed diminished (p<0.001) CD3+ (1306 vs 1645) and CD4+ (442 vs 725) cells and a distorted CD4/CD8 ratio (0.83 vs 1.13, p<0.001). Relative numbers of B (CD19+) and immature B (CD19+CD21low) cells were elevated in early FU (22.7% vs 19.7%, p=0 .02 and 10.6% vs 8.1%, p=0.004). Overall memory B cells were diminished (13% vs 17.3% of B cells; p=0.006). Early FU pts showed reduced IgG and IgA levels compared to late (976 vs 1082, p=0.007 and 93 vs 139 mg/dl, p=0.0019). We asked whether cGVHD represents an additional confounding factor for IR during the two FU periods. Comparing early active to late active cGVHD, a diminution of CD4+ cells (350 vs 665 x10 6 /ml, p=0.001) and of the CD4/CD8 ratio (0.7 vs 1,0, p=0,05) was observed along with reduction of class-switched memory B cells (7.9 vs 16.7 x10 6 /ml, p=0.005). NK cells showed a clear-cut difference between the two time points in active cGVHD (242 vs 348 x10 6 /ml, p<0.03). The ratio of CD21-/CD27+ B cells was significantly increased in early active cGVHD (7.6 vs 2.7, p<0.03) . In future cGVHD only classswitched memory B cells and the ratio CD21-/CD27+ cells were different. Pediatric GVHD is associated with signifi cant disturbances in overall blood counts, T and B cell-subsets as well as Ig levels and the time point of analysis after HSCT may be of importance.",

Fegueux (13), J. Cornillon (14) , S. Francois (15) , M. Mohty (12), A. Hyun (16), C. Bulabois (17) , F. Garnier (18) Background: Although interim results suggest that AZA alone prior to allo-SCT may give similar results as standard inductiontype chemotherapy, the use of any cytoreduction before transplant is still debated, even in case of RIC. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of AZA prior to allo-SCT compared with BSC in pts undergoing RIC for MDS. Methods: 128 consecutive pts who underwent RIC between Feb 1999 and Dec 2009 are reported. Inclusion criteria were: age > 18 and RIC from either sibling (n=78) or HLA-allele-matched unrelated donor (10/10) (n=50) for MDS following BSC (n=88; BSCgroup) or AZA alone (n=40; AZA-group). Pts who received prior cytoreductive therapy other than AZA alone were excluded. The stem cells source was blood (n=112) or marrow (n=16). Data quality was ensured using computerized discrepancy errors and vigorous on-site data verifi cation of every single fi le. HLA matching was double-checked. Since our study was not randomized, we used a propensity score to adjust P values for pts who received AZA and those who did not. Results: At diagnosis, FAB/WHO was: 35 RA/RARS/RCMD, 7 RAEB-1, 80 RAEB-2 and 6 RAEB-t/AML; Cytogenetics: fav (n=65), int (n=30), unfav (n=33). Pts in the AZA group were older (p=0.001) with higher IPSS at diagnosis (p<0.001) than those of the BSC-group and had more often an unrelated-donor (p<0.001). Of note, 33 (69%) of the pts treated with AZA-alone and 5 (7%) of those treated with BSC were considered responders at transplant (CR, PR, mCR or stable disease with hematological improvement) (p<0.001). The two groups were comparable for other patient characteristics and transplantation modalities. In the AZA group, the drug was started at a median of 192 days after diagnosis and discontinued at a median of 54 days before transplant with a median number of 4.5 cycles (range 2-26). In multivariate analyses adjusted with propensity score, having a poor cytogenetic risk was the only factor that adversely infl uenced relapse risk [HR=2.87; 95% CI 1.58-5.20] (p<0.0005). Bi-and multivariate analyses performed without then with propensity score tests showed neither AZA prior to allo-SCT nor response status at transplant to have an impact on OS, EFS, or relapse. Conclusion: Absence of cytoreduction before RIC allo-SCT did not seem to alter outcomes, regardless of the pre-transplant tumor burden and main disease characteristics. Prospective studies assessing more precisely which pts may benefi t from hypomethylating agents before RIC allo-SCT are required.",

Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1, M. Markov\u00e1-Tastn\u00e1, P. Cetkovsk\u00fd Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion (Prague, CZ) An analysis of a long term follow up after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was performed in 83 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent SCT in the years 1987 -2009. A comparison of 37 transplanted patients with less advanced MDS with \u2264 5% of bone marrow (BM) blasts with subgroup of 128 patients treated with supportive care including growth factors only (SC) revealed no diff erence in median survival between both the groups (84,2 months for SCT v.s. 88,5 months for SC). Estimated 1 year and 3 years (E3yS) survival were similar, however, a signifi cant diff erence was observed in estimated 5 year survival (E5yS) (62.2% for SCT v.s. 40.6% for SC) as well for estimated 10 year survival (E10yS) (51,4% for SCT v.s. 25.8% for SC). The reason was a signifi cant number of leukemic transformation (28.9%) and comorbidities related death (19.5%) observed in SC group. None of the transplanted patients relapsed, late fatal infectious complications after SCT occurred in 10.9% of patients. In patients with > 10% of BM blasts, SCT performed in 27 patients was the only eff ective treatment with E3yS, E5yS, E10yS of 63.0, 55.6 and 51.2%, respectively. Median survival of transplanted patients was 71.4 months compared to only 12.5 months in 79 non-transplanted patients, where E3yS was 14.3% and 18.2% for low dose ARA-C and hypomethylating agents and 0% for chemotherapy or SC only. E5yS and E10yS of patients who were transplanted with \u2265 10% BM blasts at the time of conditioning was only 22.2% and 33.3% relapsed in contrast to those transplanted with < 10% BM blasts after chemotherapy where estimated 10 years survival was 66.7% with relapse rate of 22.0%. A high SCT related mortality was the main reason for relatively low number of long term surviving patients with MDS RAEB I.(6-10% of BM blasts), where median survival was 44.1 months and E5yS and E10yS were 31.2% and 26.7%, respectively. However, these results were still signifi cantly superior to those obtained with other treatment modalities with median survival of 11.8 months. Our results confi rm superiority of SCT as the only curative treatment in MDS patients with excess of BM blasts and support the usefulness of reduction of number of BM blasts prior to SCT as a factor aff ecting long-term survival. SCT also represents an eff ective treatment modality in younger patients with MDS without excess of blasts and concomitant risk factors eg. profound cytopenia or adverse karyotype.",

Sopko, E. Demeckova, M. Mistrik University Hospital Bratislava (Bratislava, SK) Background: Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for myelofi brosis although its use is limited by substantial transplant-related mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess outcome in patients with myelofi brosis who underwent allogeneic HSCT. Patients and methods: We retrospectively assessed results of HSCT in 10 consecutive patients with primary myelofi brosis (n=9) or myelofi brosis evolving from essential thrombocythaemia (n=1). Patients received an allogeneic marrow (n=1) or peripheral blood stem cell (n=9) transplant from HLA-matched sibling (n=6) or unrelated (n=4) donors between January 1996 and December 2011. The median age at the time of HSCT was 43 years (range, 20-63). At the time of transplantation all patients were at intermediate (n=9) or high (n=1) risk according to the IPSS classifi cation. 5 of 10 patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen: busulphan (BU)/cyclophosphamide (CY) in 4 patients (in 1 with antithymocyte globuline (ATG) before unrelated HSCT), total body irradiation/CY in 1 patient. 5 patients were prepared with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: included fl udarabine (FLU)/BU/CY (n=3) or FLU/BU (n=2), in 3 patients with ATG before unrelated HSCT. Splenectomy was performed in 3 patients prior to HSCT. Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was provided by combination of methotrexate + cyclosporin A (CsA), but in 1 patient prednisolone + mycophenolate mofetil due to renal toxicity of CsA. Results: All but 1 patient showed neutrophile engrafment (i.e. neutrophil count above 0.5 G/l) after a median of 18 days (range, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , in 8 of 10 patients platelet engrafment (platelet count above 50 G/l) was achieved in 14-135 days after HSCT (median 37 days). Chimerism analysis showed more than 99% donor cells in 8 patients, 1 patient with mixed chimera didn\u00b4t achieve complete donor chimerism after donor leukocyte infusion. Acute GvHD grades II to IV was observed in 4 patients, grades III to IV in 2, and extensive chronic GvHD in 3 of 8 evaluable patients. There were 2 patients who died from chronic GvHD and infection and 2 patients died from progressive disease. There are 6 patients surviving at 0.9 to 16.3 (median, 6.3) years for a 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of 68%. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 6,3\u00b15,7 years. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT off ers long-term relapse-free survival for patients with myelofi brosis. Nijmegan Breakage syndrome (NBS) is characterized by an immunodefi ciency state, due to a defective DNA double-strand breaks repair mechanism. For this reason, patients with NBS are susceptible to develop infections and malignancies. Various type of lymphomas have been reported in patients with NBS. So far, to our knowledge, \u03b3\u03b4 T-Cell Lymphoma in association with NBS has not been reported. We describe a case of NBS with \u03b3 \u03b4 T-cell lymphoma that was apparent morphologically on hepatic biopsy. Peripheral lymphocytes were sent later for immunophenotyping and genetic studies to Haematology Research Laboratory which demonstrated a \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell clone and genetic clues. An HLA-compatible sibling bone marrow donor was available for transplantation. Hence, the patient underwent a non-myeloablative allogenic peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with a conditioning regime including antithymocyte globulin (5mg/kg/d for 3 days) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/d for 4 days). Prophylaxis against GvHD was given with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Following peripheral HSCT, neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred on day +10. A chimerism study revealed 98% donor T-cell chimerism in the peripheral blood on day +60. The proportion of total lymphocytes, B cells, C4+ T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the peripheral blood cells gradually increased with month. He had no cytopenia, active infection or any evidence of aGvHD on days +90 and +180. There was no evidence of abnormal lymphoma clone. During his current visit one year after transplantation, he was in hematological remission. Primary immunodefi ciency disease NBS may occur with unusual hematological features and peripheral HSCT from HLA compatible donor may overcome such a challenge by using non-myeloablative conditioning P597 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for Diamond-Blackfan anaemia in Japan: a report from the Inborn Errors Working Group of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (JSHCT) H.

            "text": "Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is curative in patients (pts) with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) who are not responsive to steroids. Alternative donor (AD) transplant has been considered to be less encouraging because of the high incidence of graft rejection or GVHD. We retrospectively compared the outcome of Japanese DBA pts undergoing SCT from an HLAidentical sibling (IdSib) or from an AD. Patients and Methods: Forty pts with DBA (15 males and 25 females) have been treated by SCT between January 1987 and July 2010, and registered to the Transplant Registry Unifi ed Management Program (TRUMP). Median age at SCT was 5.5 years (range; 6 months to 38 years) and median observation period was 7.1 years (range 10 days to 24.7 years). Stem cell sources were IdSib bone marrow (BM) in 16 pts, related BM other than IdSib in 10 pts, HLA-matched/mismatched unrelated BM in 8 pts, and cord blood in 6 pts. Full-dose (4 days) busulfan-based regimen (regimen A) was used in 14 pts, half-dose (2 days) Bu with 3Gy TAI, Flu, CY, ATG (regimen B) in 6 pts, half-dose Bu with other combinations (regimen C) in 3 pts, non-Bu regimen (regimen D) in 17 pts. Ten pts in regimen D received 6 Gy or more dose of irradiation. Prophylaxis of GVHD was selected according to the donor. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results: Sustained engraftment was obtained in 36 pts. Primary engraftment failure was observed in 2 pts (a case of IdSib BMT conditioned by CY/ALG and a case of maternal BMT conditioned by Flu/Bu) and late graft failure in 1 pts. One patient who received maternal peripheral blood died early to evaluate engraftment. Another patient transplanted unrelated BM died of TMA. The incidence of acute GVHD was as follows; grade 0, 18 pts; grade I, 12 pts; grade 2, 6 pts; grade III, 2 pts and grade IV, 0 pts. The OS and the EFS in entire cohort were 95% and 87%. The EFSs according to donor were 94% in IdSib, 80% in related BM other than IdSib, 88% in UBM and 83% in CB (83% in all AD transplant). The EFSs according to the conditioning were 100% in regimen A, 100% in regimen B, 67% in regimen C, 76% in regimen D, respectively. Conclusions: Recent improvement in outcomes of AD-SCT for DBA was recognized. Although regimen A is eff ective to obtain engraftment, dose reduction of Bu may be possible even in AD transplant when combined with low-dose TAI, Flu, CY, ATG. Objective: Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pigment dilution, immunodefi ciency and occurrence of accelerated phase consisting of hemophagocytosis, pancytopenia and neurological manifestations. The prognosis is very poor unless early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is carried out, preferably before the development of the accelerated phase. Here, we report the results of the HSCT in children with GS. Methods: This study includes eight patients with GS (5 female and 3 males with ages ranging between 6 months-58 months, median 16 months) underwent HSCT between 1997-2011 at our center. One patient underwent additional two HSCT due to engraftmant failure. GS was diagnosed with history, typical phenotypic features, light microscopic examination of hair shafts and the develop ment of HLH. Mutational analysis was performed in one patient.",

            "text": "The pre-transplant features of the patients are shown on Table 1 . All patients received conditioning regimen including busulfan (12.8 mg/kg-16 mg/kg iv. or 16 mg/kg orally)+cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg/day)\u00b1anti-thymocyte globulin (10 mg/kg/day for 3 or 4 days)/etoposid (900mg/m2). Cyclosporin A and metotrexate were used for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Results: The results of transplantations was shown on table 2. Engraftment was achieved in 7 patients. The median time to neutrophil recovery was 13 days (range: 10-15 days) . None of the patients developed acute and chronic GVHD, veno-occlussive disease (VOD) was observed in 3 patients, mucositis in 5 patients, sepsis in 2 patients, pulmonary infection in 2 patients, atelectasis in 1 patients. Partial convulsion was observed in one patient on day +6. Interestingly one of the patients developed in situ melanoma two years after HSCT. Currently, the clinical condition of this patients is well. One patient died due to engraftment failure and infection, the other one died due to VOD. The remaining 6 patients are alive without disesae activation. The duration of follow-up was ranged between 17-182 months. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT is the unique curative procedure for GS, preferably before development of hemophagocytosis and CNS involvement. According to our knowledge, this report is the one of the largest series of children with GS underwent HSCT. Six of the 8 patients alive without disease activation for a long follow-up period. Introduction: Autosomal recessive infantile malignant osteopetrosis (IMO) is a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that aff ect osteoclast development and/or function. The clinical course often leads to early death due to haematologic abnormalities/bone marrow failure. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment. In 35 patients transplanted in our unit from 1983 to 2007, severe early transplant-related complications and graft failure were frequently observed with an overall survival of only 46%. Objectives: In order to reduce transplant-related toxicity, we used a Busulfan/Fludarabine based conditioning regimen since October 2008. Methods: We analysed retrospectively the outcome of HSCT in 7 consecutive patients treated in accordance to the recent recommendations of osteopetrosis registry on behalf of ESID and EBMT. Results: The patients, 4 girls and three boys, presented IMO of early onset. Mean age at clinical diagnosis was 2.9 months, ranging from one diagnosis at birth due to positive family history to one at 6 months of age. Signs at onset were as followed: Hypo-Ca in 3, anaemia and/or thrombopenia in 4, visual impairment in 4 and abnormal fractures in 1 patient respectively. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in TCIRG1 in 5 patients and a homozygous mutation in RANK in two cousins. HSCT was performed as soon as possible after diagnosis. Patients' mean age at HSCT was 6.9 months (range 4.5 to 21, median age 5 months). Table 1 shows details on HSCT procedures. All but one patient received prophylactic Defi brotide. We used peripheral blood stem cells in all patients as stem cell source in order to obtain high numbers of CD34+ cells/kg recipient. Donors were haplo-identical parents in 4, phenoidentical parent in two and a 10/10 MUD in one patient. All but two patients engrafted with 100% donor chimerism. In one haplo-identical paternal HSCT primary graft failure occurred, but 100% donor engraftment was achieved following a second haploidentical maternal HSCT after 120mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 0,6 mg/kg Alemtuzumab. One patient developed multiorgan failure upon S. aureus sepsis on day 0 and died at day +55 without signs of engraftment. Transplant related toxicity was low. Conclusion: The recent recommendations of osteopetrosis registry on behalf of ESID and EBMT allow stable donor cell engraftment, also in a haplo identical setting, at a follow up of 6 months to 4 years and 2 months. Survival improved signifi cantly to 85,6% compared to our former results of 46%. Life-threatening infection caused by opportunistic pathogens is an early clinical hallmark of primary immunodefi ciencies including severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID). Here, we describe the case of an six-month-old female infant who presented with severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. The patient is the fi rst child of healthy consanguineous parents of Central European ancestry. Her previous development has been normal. Detailed immune cell phenotyping at diagnosis revealed a na\u00efve phenotype in CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and a predominance of transitional (CD38+ CD24+ CD10+) B-lymphocytes. Regulatory T-lymphocytes (defi ned as CD4+, CD25+, CD127-, CD45R0+ and CCR4+) were not detectable. Analysis of the \u03b1/\u03b2 T-cell repertoire in peripheral blood of the infant patient showed normal expression of 26 T-cell receptor (TCR) BV-families determined by CDR3-size spectratyping and detection by length polymorphism. The novel entity of SCID was characterized by a\u03b3globulinemia and profoundly defi cient T-cell function despite quantitatively normal T-and B-lymphocytes. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a single pathogenic homozygous nonsense mutation aff ecting caspase-recruitment domain 11 (CARD11) gene. CARD11 is a scaffold protein required for TCR-and B-cell receptor-(BCR) induced NF-\u03baB activation as well as lymphocyte activation and proliferation, which is specifi cally expressed in hematopoietic cells. In reconstitution assays we demonstrated that the patient derived truncated CARD11 protein is defective in antigen receptor signaling and NF-\u03baB activation. The infant was treated with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) at the age of 9 months. Due to preexisting brochiectasis a toxicity-reduced conditioning regimen for transplantation consisting of treosulfan, fl udarabine and alemtuzumab was used. Posttransplant graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. The infant engrafted uneventfully. The patient was treated with several stem cell boosts and donor lymphocyte infusions because of increasing mixed chimerism with imminent autologous reconstitution and delayed immunological reconstitution. She is currently 14 months posttransplant and doing well. We show that an inactivating CARD11 mutation is linking defective NF-\u03baB signaling with a novel cause of autosomal recessive SCID. Moreover reduced toxicity conditioning for PBSCT from a MUD is feasible in this novel entity of SCID. S154 transplant should achieve durable chimerism adequate to correct the underlying disorder, with minimal toxicity and with low rates of acute and chronic GVHD. For the last 9 years In Manchester we have included Alemtuzumab in our conditioning regimen -1mgs/kg over days -9 to -5 where an unrelated donor and 0.3mgs/kg over days -7 to -5 where the donor is an HLA matched family donor. All such transplants are using bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) as the donor cell source. Materials and Methods: All children receiving a fi rst transplant with Alemtuzumab were reviewed. The diagnosis, donor, regimen (Reduced Intensity -RIC, Myeloablative -MAC), donor source (BM, PB), survival and engrafted survival (defi ned as time to inadequate chimerism or time to second transplant) were recorded. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, cause of death, immune reconstitution (T and B cell and CD4 and CD8 T cells) and virus isolation following standardised surveillance of blood, stool and urine were recorded. Results: 90 such were transplanted with an Alemtuzumab containing regimen. The diagnoses were non SCID immune defi ciency (n=33), Inborn Error (n=20), Constitutional (n=18) or Acquired (n=13) Bone Marrow Failure (n=18) or Haemoglobinopathy (n=6). 34 received an family donor and 56 a MUD donor. The cell source was BM in 52 and PB in 38. Overall survival was 91% in this cohort (SE 3%) and the engrafted survival was 81% (SE 4%). 8 patients had graft rejection and required repeat transplant -all had received RIC or non-pharmacokinetic guided busulfan in their fi rst transplant -and 7 of these children are long term survivors and one child died during the second transplant procedure. The need for second transplant is reduced in the later years of this follow up. 7 patients died after the fi rst transplant with adenovirus (n=1), complications of the original disease (n=2), Acute GVHD (n=3) and early multi-organ failure (n=1). Only 3 children in this cohort require continuing immune suppression or ECP for chronic GVHD. There were 95 viraemic episodes (32 CMV, 51 EBC and 12 adenovirus) Conclusion: We commend the use of Alemtuzumab in nonmalignant disorder. Although viral reactivation is common, mortality from all causes is low and the conditioning regimen achieves its twin aims of low chronic GVHD rates and high rates of durable engraftment. Fanconi anemia is a rare and heterogeneous inherited disorder. The natural history of FA is characterized by marrow failure and a risk for clonal evolution. Evolution to acute myeloid leukemia is the main cause of premature mortality. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is considered the treatment of choice in this situation but the evolution is usually poor post-HSCT (due to treatment-related mortality). From August 2006 to December 2011, 6 consecutive patients with FA who received a sequential treatment with chemotherapy and reduced-intensity conditioning for clonal evolution in four diff erent French institutions were reviewed. Five patients presented an AML and one a myelodysplastic syndrome. The sequential strategy consisted in a pre-transplant chemotherapy by fl udarabine 30 mg/m2/d 5 days and cytarabine 1gr/m2 x 2/d 5 days with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor injections (FLAG) followed early after by a reducedintensity conditioning [4 days cyclophosphamide 10 mg/kg , 4 days fl udarabine 30 mg/m2, 2 days anti-thymocyte globulin (3.75 mg/kg) and TBI (2 Gy) ]. The source of stem cells was cord blood for three patients and bone marrow for others. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis consisted in cyclosporine plus MMF. Median age of the patients at HSCT was 20.5 years . Pre-transplant chemotherapy and conditioning regimen were well tolerated. The median time between chemotherapy and the date of HSCT was 30 days. All patients engrafted. Median time to engraftment was 21 days (range 14 to 35) for neutrophils and 29 days for platelets. Donor chimerism was complete at day 100 for 5 patients. Septicemias were encountered in three patients (Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, and Candida) at 1, 3 and 4 months after HSCT, respectively. One patient developed a diarrhea to Campylobacter jejuni one month after HSCT and another patient underwent meatotomy. Acute GvHD (1 grade I and 1 grade II) occurred in 2 patients. Both responded to steroid therapy. Chronic GvHD occurred in two patients. After a median follow-up (FU) of 30 months , all patients are still alive in complete remission from the clonal evolution. With a median FU of 30 months, all patients are alive and free from their original AML or MDS. The number of patients is little but the usual evolution is very poor post-HSCT in this particular situation. We thus believe this study supports the use of a sequential strategy (FLAG and RIC HSCT) in FA patients with AML or MDS. Background: In X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation disorder, approximately 30-35% of boys and a minimum of 10-20% of adult men will develop a progressive demyelination of the CNS, leading to neurocognitive decline and death within a few years. In adult men, this acute infl ammatory cerebral disease (ACER) may arise de novo or more frequently secondary to the adult neurodegenerative form of the disease, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). Lacking established therapeutic options, we off ered in a pilot series ACER patients without relevant neurocognitive impairment HSCT on a compassionate use basis. Patients: Since 2006, a total of 9 men (age: 26-48 years) underwent BMT (n=7) or PBSCT (n=2) either from an HLA-identical sibling (n=1) or matched unrelated donor (\u22659/10-HLA-identical). All patients showed infl ammatory CNS disease as demonstrated by contrast enhancement in MRI. They were uniformly evaluated in one institution before HSCT. 7 out of 9 patients had relevant AMN symptoms with 3 men not ambulatory without aid (Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) >5.5). The preparative regimen consisted of oral busulfan (4 x 4 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (2 x 60 mg/kg), and ATG Fresenius ((4 x 10 mg/kg). Results: At a minimum follow-up of 4 months (median 34 months) 6 out of 7 patients are alive after BMT. All patients engrafted demonstrating a complete or predominant donor chimerism. Relevant acute GVHD grade >I occurred in only 1 patient. At least transient peripheral and central neurotoxicity was a problem in 7 and 4 patients, respectively. Peripheral neurotoxicity was associated with high fever and correlated with initial AMN defi cits. Moreover, there were severe infections (Grade \u22653) in 5 out of 6 men with extensive AMN. Two patients deceased directly from infections, another patient from subsequent ACER progression. CNS infl ammation was stopped in 6 out of 7 evaluable patients and a complete loss of intellectual functions could be prevented. Conclusion: HSCT is so far the only therapeutic option to prevent rapid death in ACER patients. The chosen approach seems to be relatively safe and feasible for patients lacking severe neurocognitive impairment and advanced AMN (EDSS <6). However, extensive motor defi cits or bladder dysfunction implicate a signifi cant risk for early infection and TRM. AMN is poorly infl uenced by HSCT, and will confer additional morbidity later on. Therefore, the transplant indication in ACER has to be evaluated carefully in experienced centers.",

Hongeng, S. Hongeng, U. Anurathapan, N. Sirachainan, D. Songdej, A. Chuansumrit Ramathibodi Hospital (Bangkok, TH) Recently published reports indicate that the outcome of unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with leukemia is comparable with that of transplantation from identical family donors. We would like to prove that the outcomes of related and unrelated transplantation are favorably comparable in children with severe thalassemia. We reviewed transplant outcome in 105 consecutive children with severe thalassemia who underwent allogeneic HSCT the related-donor stem cells (n = 60) or unrelated-donor stem cells (n = 35) between September 1992 and Dec 2012. Analysis of engraftment, frequency of procedure related complications, and thalassemia-free survival revealed no advantage from use of related-donor stem cells. The thalassemia-free survival estimate for recipients of related-donor stem cells was 92% compared with 80% in the unrelated-donor stem cells group (p = 0.09). The present study provides and evidence to support the view that it is therefore quite reasonable to consider unrelated HSCT as an acceptable therapeutic approach in severe thalassemia, at least for patients who are not fully compliant with conventional treatment and do not yet show irreversible severe complications of iron overload. Moreover, we also have proved that our new reduced intensity conditioning regimen approach can overcome the past poor result of HSCT in class 3 lucarelli thalassemia (age \u2265 10 years and hepatomegaly; liver > 5 cm below costal margin) patients (n = 21). Both of the thalassemia free survival and overall survival rates in this group are 92%. Finally, we have studied the cost utility analysis between HSCT and hypertransfusion with iron chelation therapy in thalassemia patients. We can prove that matched related donor transplantation in thalassemia patients appears to be a cost eff ective and aff ordable treatment for all thalassemia patients even class 3 lucarelli patients.",

De Angelis (1) Introduction: High foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels ameliorate morbidity and mortality in Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) and \u03b2-thalassaemia. The variability of HbF levels is genetically controlled by multiple genes and recent studies provide molecular mechanisms regulating the HbF production. Our group observed an unusual event: in three patients aff ected by \u03b2-globin gene disorders the reactivation of HbF synthesis has been documented after bone marrow transplant (BMT) failure and autologous reconstitution. In the present study the genetic background has been analyzed for such patients who exhibited reactivation of the HbF synthesis. Methods and results: Two \u03b2\u00b0-thalassaemia major cases were candidates for BMT: the fi rst thalassaemic patient, rejected at +40 days after BMT and the second one at +90 days after transplant. The autologous recovery was documented in both cases. Transfusion therapy was required to support anaemia until +118 and +162 days after transplant in the fi rst and in the second case respectively. Afterwards the Hb levels were steadily over 11.8 and 10.2 g/dl respectively without the use of transfusion support and the Hb electrophoresis revealed HbF 99.8% in both cases. As we write this at +81 and +69 months respectively of ongoing follow-up after graft failure, both patients maintain the sustained and full (99.8%) production of HbF and are transfusion-free. (See the fi gure). The third case is a SCA patient who failed to maintain the engraft of the haploidentical allogeneic transplant.Thirty-two months after the BMT failure, the HbF levels increased to 49.2 and the patient remains with stable Hb level over 11.4 gr/dl and without vaso-occlusive symptoms. (Figure) . The genetic analysis documented that all patients were carrier of the non-deletion form of hereditary persistence of HbF. Both thalassaemic patients exhibit the homozygosity for the -158 (C->T) point mutation in the G \u03b3 promoter sequence. The DNA of thalassaemic patients has been genotyped for the genetic variants at 3 principal loci involved in the interdividual HbF variation: HBS1L-MYB , BCL11A and KLF1. A high-HbF haplotype from MYB-HMIP2 locus locus has been documented in one of the two thalassemic patients (see the table). Conclusions: Reactivation of HbF synthesis can occur in the adult age and the high levels of HbF provide a therapeutic benefi t to the \u03b2-disorders. It is likely that the favourable genetic background in these patients concurred the full HbF production.",

            "text": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked primary immunodefi ciency disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), which is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton required for many haematopoietic and immune cell functions. Patients of WAS exhibit thrombocytopenia, eczema, recurrent infections, high incidence of autoimmunity and malignancies due to immunodefi ciency. Severe WAS leads to an early death from infection or bleeding. The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have shed lights on an innovative personalized cell therapy strategy for various primary defi ciency disorders. The restricted expression of WASp in hematopoietic cells makes it a promising candidate disease for stem cell gene-therapy approaches. Here we report the establishment of integration-free iPS cell lines from WAS patient fi broblasts, aiming for ex vivo disease modeling and future possible therapeutic approach. We reprogrammed the fi broblasts of a WAS patient with 3 episomal plasmids by nucleofection. The established iPSC clones exhibited similar morphology, cell surface markers and diff erentiation potential as normal human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and contained no residue episomal DNA beyond passage 10. We then diff erentiated the WAS iPSCs into the hematopoietic lineage ex vivo through stromal cell co-culture system. In the presence of GM-CSF and M-CSF, we successfully expanded CD45+CD43+CD11c+ progenitors which could give rise to CFU-G, CFU-M and CFU-GM in colony forming cell assay. Further differentiation with proper cytokines showed normal maturation of those progenitors into CD80+CD209+HLA-DR+ dendritic cells and CD14+CD163+ macrophages, which were two vital cell populations of innate and adaptive immunity. Functional analysis of WAS iPSCs derived macrophages showed podosome formation defect which was consistent with the reported functional deficiency of patient's macrophages. However, the antigen uptake, processing, and phagocytosis of WAS iPSCs derived macrophages seemed unimpaired compared to normal human ESCs derived macrophages. Overall, we have generated integration-free WAS iPSC clones capable of diff erentiating into monocytic lineage and showing a disease-related phenotype. These iPSC clones may provide an ideal ex vivo system to study the role of WASp in the development of a functional immune system, and, upon gene correction, provide a safer, unlimited source for stem cell gene therapy for WAS patients. Up to 85% of patients with Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) develop acute haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), termed the \"accelerated phase (AP)\". This is managed by immunochemotherapy consolidated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, despite long term disease control, Tardieu et al (2005) reported frequent moderate to severe neurological defi cits and low cognitive abilities in long term survivors, developing by 24 years of age. The proposed cause is defective LYST protein function in neurons/glial cells.",

            "text": "We describe a female whose history suggests a potential role for chronic macrophage/ histiocyte activity in driving complications of CHS. First diagnosed with CHS and incidental Turner mosaicism at 20 months, she remained well until 4 years. She then became progressively fearful of movement over a 3 month period, at the end of which she developed fulminant CNS abnormalities (unable to speak, sit unaided or swallow, with nystagmus and strabismus). Multifocal white matter changes resembling acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) were present on MRI. Cerebrospinal fl uid showed lymphohistiocytes and raised protein levels but she had no signs of systemic AP/HLH (normal blood count/ferritin, no hepatosplenomegaly). Plasma cytokine analysis was more consistent with macrophage activation than HLH [IL-1\u03b2 924 pg/ml (NR <5pg/ml), IL-6 9196 pg/ml (<10pg/ml)] (Flammiger et al, 2012) . She was treated according to the HLH-94 protocol and made rapid neurological recovery, within weeks gaining more developmental skills than at any stage pre-treatment. Matched unrelated male donor HSCT was performed subsequently and she achieved 100% chimerism, with almost complete resolution of MRI abnormalities. Three years post-HSCT she developed pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) aff ecting one knee, accompanied by fever, night sweats, anaemia, CRP up to 288mg/L, high IL-1\u03b2 (46.7 pg/ml) and IL-6 (161 pg/ml) -features not seen in typical PVNS. The PVNS was composed of mononuclear histiocytes of female origin. Immunotherapy failed but subtotal surgical debridement resolved all symptoms; she remains well 10 years later. This patient's serial problems suggest that impaired histiocyte/ macrophage control may produce chronic pathologies in CHS in the absence of AP/HLH disease. This in turn suggests that transplant should be performed as early as possible after diagnosis for those with well matched donors, or that drug therapies targeting macrophage/histiocyte activation may have a role. Objective: T-cell replete BMT from HLA-haploidentical family donors with post-transplant cyclophosphamide results in low GVHD rates, improved immune reconstitution and an overall outcome comparable to other alternative donor transplantations in adults with haematological malignancies. In non-malignant disorders such as sickle cell disease it results in high graft failure rates after non-myeloablative conditioning. In combination with more intensive preparative regimens this approach might help to overcome engraftment barriers in children with non-malignant diseases. Methods: Case report. Results: We report on a 5 year old girl with infantile onset infl ammatory bowel disease caused by a homozygous mutation in IL10RA who was lacking a matched related or unrelated donor. After conditioning with rabbit ATG Fresenius (30mg/kg), fl udarabin (160mg/m 2 ), thiotepa (10mg/kg) and melphalan (140mg/m 2 ) she received CD3/CD19-depleted PBSC from her mother. GVHD prophylaxis was mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). After a transient hyperinfl ammatory syndrome she primarily rejected this graft. Reconditioning with rabbit ATG Genzyme (4.5mg/kg), fl udarabin (120mg/m 2 ), thiotepa (5mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (60mg/kg) and TBI (2Gy) and second transplant with CD34 positive selected PBSC from the same donor on day +35 without GVHD prophylaxis resulted in primary graft failure again. At day +78 after the fi rst transplant she received a salvage graft from her HLA-haploidentical father using T-cell replete bone marrow followed by cylophosphamide (50mg/kg/d) on days +3 and +4. Conditioning comprised alemtuzumab (0.6mg/kg), fl udarabine (150mg/m 2 ), treosulfan (24g/m 2 ) and cyclophosphamide (29mg/kg). GVHD-prophylaxis was tacrolimus and MMF. This procedure led to complete bone marrow donor chimerism at d +42 after the third transplant with little toxicity and no GVHD. For poor graft function despite complete donor chimerism she later required a CD34 positive selected PBSC boost from her father on day +50. After 130 days of follow-up after the third transplant the patient is alive and well, has cleared a CMV infection and is free from signs of GVHD. Conclusion: Due to its high content of graft facilitating cells and probably selective depletion of alloreactive T-cells and tolerization induced by high dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide a T-cell replete haploidentical bone marrow might be able to overcome engraftment barriers and can be taken into consideration in case of primary graft rejection.",

Chongkolwatana Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University (Bangkok, TH) Homozygouse \u03b1-thalassemia 1 is the most severe thalassemia disease. This group of patients presents with hydrops fetalis and always dies before or shortly after birth. We reported successful stem cell transplantation in homozygouse \u03b1-thalassemia 1. A Thai girl was born at 32 weeks of gestational age (birth weight 1,300 gm) with hydrops fetalis by cesarean section. Her mother was 33 years old came to our hospital because of toxemia of pregnancy and prenatal ultrasonography showed hydrops fetalis with massive ascites. Her hemoglobin at birth was 6.8 g/dl. She was intubated, abdominal, pleural paracentesis and total blood exchange transfusion immediately after birth. Her hemoglobin typing before total blood exchange transfusion was 100% of hemoglobin Bart's and DNA analysis showed homozygouse \u03b1-thalassemia 1 (South East Asian deletion). After she was stable from preterm complications, she was started on hypertransfusion every 3-4 weeks and kept pre-transfusion hemoglobin at 9-10 g/dl since the age of 3 months. She has 6/6 HLA matched with her older sister. She was underwent stem cell transplantation at the age of 1 year. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan 1.2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours intravenously for 4 days and cyclophosphamide 50 mg/ kg/day for 4 days. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine and short course metrotrexate. The stem cell source was bone marrow and total CD 34 counts was 9.41 x 10 6 cells/kg. Her transplantation complications were febrile neutropenia and mucositis. She had WBC engraftment at day+17 and DNA showed full donor chimerism at day+25. On day+112, DNA showed mixed chimerism with 41% of recipient's DNA but hemoglobin was still stable. Cyclosporine was stopped and she received donor lymphocyte transfusion (DLI) at the dose 1x10 7 cells/kg of CD3 from her sister every 2 weeks. After 4 times of DLI, she could achieve full donor chimerism. Now, she is 4 years old with post transplantation for 3 years and her DNA is still full donor chimerism. Her hemoglobin is 13 g/dl, normal hemoglobin typing. Her developmental milestones are up to her age. Conclusion: Homozygouse \u03b1-thalassemia 1 can be cured with stem cell transplantation. Preterm delivery with immediate total blood exchange transfusion, hypertransfusion and proceed to stem cell transplantation is possible treatment strategy to cure from this fatal disease. From our knowledge, this is the fi rst successful stem cell transplantation in homozygouse \u03b1-thalassemia 1 in Asia. Pulmonary haemorrhage (PH) is a well recognised complication of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for Hurler's Syndrome (MPS 1H), previously suspected to be due to glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) accumulation in pulmonary tissues. However, introduction of pre-transplant enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has not prevented PH despite improving upper airway obstruction. We report a male patient who underwent 5/6 matched cord blood transplantation (CBT) for MPS 1H at 18m after conditioning with fl udarabine, busulfan and ATG. He had required neonatal oxygen therapy and had suff ered recurrent chest infections during his fi rst year, including metapneumovirus and adenovirus infections both requiring ventilation. These left him with a permanently consolidated right upper lobe and need for long-term oxygen therapy. He was commenced on ERT at diagnosis of MPS-1H at 13 months and proceeded to transplant when off supplemental oxygen. On day 12 post-CBT he developed fever, stridor and respiratory distress requiring ventilation and then had an episode of cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity which responded rapidly to resuscitation. Platelets during this period were in the range 31-63 x 10(9)/L and no blood was seen in endotracheal aspirates. Echocardiogram showed a fractional shortening of 31%, and a dilated left atrium with moderate mitral regurgitation. He was treated for hypertension with nifedipine and received inotropic support which was gradually weaned to stoppage. He subsequently engrafted satisfactorily without GVHD, normalised his respiratory rate and oxygen saturations, was feeding well, and was due for discharge by day 49 post-transplant. He then developed respiratory distress without underlying infection, and rapidly deteriorated to unresuscitatable cardiorespiratory arrest with fresh blood issuing from his nose and mouth. His platelet count at that time was 17 x 10(9)/L. Findings at post-mortem included diff use pulmonary haemorrhage, presence of iron laden macrophages (suggestive of previous PH), GAGS infi ltration of the mitral valve and marked pulmonary venous hypertensive (PVH) changes. Previous reports have suggested that platelet counts of 40+ are not protective against PH in these patients. The risk of PH may also be exacerbated by allogeneic responses, particularly following CBT. This patient's problems suggest that PH may have cardiogenic origin, with mitral regurgitation producing secondary PVH, making a case for more proactive cardiac drug therapy even without overt cardiac failure.",

Porta Children's Hospital (Brescia, IT) Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only curative treatment for chronic granulomatous disease CGD). We grafted 5 children aff ected by CGD, 4 from MUD and 1 from a matched family donor. Pt 1 at the age of 3 yrs received full conditioning and MUD BMT. At day + 15 engraftment was present, but the child became lethargic. A CT scan demonstrated a cerebral mass compatible with an aspergillus infection. Despite antifungal therapy the child died on day +25 post-BMT. Pt 2 , aged 6 yrs and 3 aged 18 months, two brothers, were diagnosed CGD. Pt 2 received matched familial BMT after conditioning with Bu Mel ATG . He engrafted on day +15, after discharge, being a full donor chimera, he reactivated a viral infection that led on day +60 to GVHD and PPT and subsequently died of cerebral bleed. Pt 3 received familial phenoidentical BMT. He engrafted on day +12. Donor chimerism declined from 100% to 39% within two mos. Therefore BMT was boosted with CD34+ cells reaching 60%. Pt 4 received PBSC form a MUD and engrafted nicely on day +15 and is a full chimera. Pt 5 aged 12 yrs with chronic intestinal disease received a MUD PBSC after a RIC BU conditioning . He engrafted nicely at day + 15. Six<month later he died of heart failure due to a pregress cardiac insuffi ciency. In our experience BMT in CGD remains the only curative therapy in severly aff ected pts (i.e. MICI), RIC BU conditioning plus PBSC at present is the golden standard that decreases toxicity risks and shortens aplasia. S159 Lymphocyte biology P612 Infl uence of in vitro IL-2 or IL-15 alone or in combination with Hsp 70 derived 14-mer peptide (TKD) on the expression of NK cell activatory and inhibitory receptors: a thorough study towards GvL eff ects of NK cells against leukaemia I. Hromadnikova (1) , P. Pirkova (1) , L. Sedlackova (1) , A. Fiserova (2) (1) Charles University (Prague, CZ); (2) Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences (Prague, CZ) NK cells represent a potential tool for adoptive immunotherapy against solid tumors and leukaemia. Membrane-bound Hsp70 acts as a tumor-specifi c marker enhancing NK cell activity (1, 2) . We have demonstrated that human leukaemia cell lines were positive for cell surface Hsp70 expression (5, 6) . Incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with Hsp70 derived 14-mer peptide (TKD) plus a low dose IL-2 initiates the cytolytic and migratory capacity of NK cells toward Hsp70 membrane positive tumor cells (3, 4) . This study is a part of comprehensive study focused on the inducement of GvL eff ects through NK cells against leukaemia. Using FACS, the eff ect of in vitro stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15 alone or in combination with TKD on cell surface expression of NK activatory receptors (CD16, NKG2D, NKG2C, NKp46, NKp44, NKp30, KIR2DL4, DNAM-1 and LAMP1) and NK inhibitory receptors (NKG2A, KIR2DL2/L3, LIR1/ILT-2 and NKR-P1A) in healthy individuals was studied. Results were expressed as the percentage of receptor expressing cells and the amount of receptor expressed by CD3-CD56+ cellular population. CD94, NKG2D, NKp44, NKp30, KIR2DL4, DNAM-1, LAMP1, NKG2A and NKR-P1A were upregulated after the stimulation with IL-2 or IL-15 alone or in combination with TKD. KIR2DL2/L3 was upregulated only by IL-15 and IL-15/TKD. Concurrently, an increase in a number of NK cells positive for CD94, NKp44, NKp30, KIR2DL4 and LAMP1 was observed. IL-15 and IL-15/TKD caused also cell number rise positive for KIR2DL2/L3 and NKR-P1A. Cell number positive for NKG2C and NKG2A was increased only by IL-2 and IL-2/TKD. The diverse eff ect of IL-2 or IL-15 w or w/o TKD on cell surface expression was observed in CD16, NKp46 and LIR1/ILT-2. Although NK cytotoxicity fi nally depends on the type and the expression of ligands on the target cells interacting with NK activatory and inhibitory receptors, the study showed clearly how NK cells were infl uenced under in vitro conditions in the presence of other immunocompetent cells by low-dose interleukins themselves or in combination with TKD peptide. CD8 T-cell responses against several WT1-derived peptides have been characterized and are supposed to contribute to disease control after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Also the identifi cation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-restricted CD4 T-cell epitopes from WT1 is a challenging task of T cell-based cancer immunotherapy to improve the eff ectiveness of WT1 peptide vaccination. Here we demonstrate HLA-DR-restricted CD4 T-cell responses in leukemia patients after allo-HSCT to a highly immunogenic 9-mer WT1 peptide that was primarily reported as an HLA-A*02 restricted epitope. CD4 T-cell depletion completely abolished IFN\u03b3 induction in response to WT1 126-134, and antibody-mediated blockade mapped peptide presentation to HLA-DR (IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT Assay, fi g.1). Beyond cytokine production, a fraction of WT1 126-134 specifi c CD4 T-cells was CD107a positive after WT1 126-134 peptide stimulation, indicative of their cytotoxic potential. By fl ow cytometry analysis it was demonstrated that WT1 126-134 specifi c CD4 T-cells were mainly functional cytotoxic CD4 T-cells, and subpopulations of them were eff ector memory cells. Longitudinal analysis showed that WT1 126-134 specifi c CD4 T-cells persisted for months or even longer after allo-HSCT and expressed a monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell receptor V-\u03b2 repertoire. Such expanded WT1 126-134 reactive CD4 T-cells were absent in the donor of the stem cell graft, suggesting that antigen-specifi c T-cells had expanded in the recipient in response to tumor cells.",

Carsetti Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu (Rome, IT) Objectives: Bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising tool for immunoregulatory and regenerative cell-therapy; however, their specifi c role in modulating B cell function is controversial and still incompletely understood. Here, we studied the role of BM-derived MSCs in modulating Blymphocytes stimulated with a polyclonal activator (CpG) in healthy donors (HDs) and in two pathologic conditions in which B cells induce/maintain infl ammation and tissue damage, i.e. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and patients receiving kidney transplantation. Methods: We established an in vitro culture system to analyse the eff ects of MSCs on B-cell proliferation, plasma cells diff erentiation and antibody secretion after stimulation with CpG for 7 days. We compared B cell function in the presence and absence of MSCs in diff erent experimental conditions: total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted B cells, PBMCs without T cells, sorted B cells mixed to sorted T cells. B-cell proliferation and plasma cell diff erentiation were measured by FACS analysis, whereas antibody secretion was quantifi ed by ELISA in culture supernatants. Results: We found that, both in HDs and in patients, in vitro B-cell proliferation, plasma-cell diff erentiation and antibody production are inhibited in the presence of MSCs co-cultured with PBMCs+CpG, but not when sorted B cells are cultured with MSCs+CpG. Inhibition is restored in CpG+MSC co-cultures when sorted T cells are added to sorted B cells, suggesting that this eff ect is mediated by T cells, with both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets playing a role. Removal of Treg cells from culture did not alter MSC-dependent inhibition of B-cell proliferation and antibody production. IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 are likely involved in T-cell dependent inhibition of B-cell function by MSCs since the level of these cytokines was increased in the supernatant. Conclusion: In our culture system BM-derived MSCs inhibit B cell function with a T-cell dependent mechanism. This fi nding has to be taken into account in the design of innovative MSC-based strategies in SLE and kidney transplanted patients, in whom T-cell function is often impaired by the immunesuppressive therapy. Stimulation with CpG of total PBMCs in presence of MSCs could predict the success of MSC therapy to treat patients with autoimmune diseases or at risk of solid organ rejection. (1) , W. Qasim (1), K. Gilmour (1), R. Chiesa (2) , M. Hubank (1) , P. Amrolia (2) , P. Veys (2) (1)Institute of Child Health (London, GB); (2)Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, GB) Objective: In contrast to bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB), early T cell reconstitution after cord blood (CB) transplant is CD4 biased and associated with a relatively lower incidence of GVHD. In view of emerging evidence that foetal and adult T cells arise from ontogenically diff erent populations of haemopoietic stem cells, we have investigated whether these diff erences refl ect diff erential gene expression in CB and PB T cells. Methods: We compared the gene expression profi le on fl ow cytometrically sorted na\u00efve CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+ T cells derived from normal donor CB and PB using Aff ymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Diff erentially expressed probe sets were identifi ed using Bioconductor package \"limma\". The threshold for identifying signifi cant genes was set at a false discovery rate of 5% and foldchange of \u2265 2. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity and Gene Set enrichment analysis software. Results: In 2 separate gene expression profiling experiments comparing CB and PB na\u00efve CD4 T cells (n=5 total), Principal Component Analysis showed CB and PB T cells segregated separately with 243/232 differentially expressed genes. 69 genes were differentially expressed in both experiments, of which 90% were up-regulated and 10% down-regulated in the CB CD4 T cells. Of these overlapping genes, 11 (i.e. TNF, JUN, EGR1, SOX4, BCL11A, TNFAIP3, TOX, CD69, IKZF2, GZMA, PAK1) were T lineage specific and 4 (i.e. GZMA, AUTS2, IGF2BP3, RGS1) have previously been identified as characteristic of foetal CD4+ T cells. Of these 69 genes, 8 (i.e. TNF, JUN, NFKBIA, EGR1, SGK1, KLF6, PAK1, HIST1H2BM) were involved in cell cycle progression. Pathway analysis showed that TNFR1 /TNFR2 signalling were the most upregulated pathways in CB CD4 T cells and within these pathways genes causing proliferation rather than apoptosis were up-regulated. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that CB CD4 T cells are genetically distinct from their counterparts in PB and this may explain their preferential expansion and tolerogenic propensity. In particular, the TNFR pathways may play a critical role in this. Further studies are underway to determine if gene expression in T cells after CB transplantation recapitulates ontogeny, switching from a foetal profi le early after transplant when T cells are derived from those transferred with the graft to an adult profi le when stem cell derived T cells emerge at later time-points.",

Wu, Y. He, H. Fu, Y. Hu, L. Sheng, H. Huang School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (Hang Zhou, CN) Background: Julie Gertner-Dardenne et al. recently reported V\u03b39V\u03b42 (gd) T cells recognized and killed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The questions therefore arise as to what is the eff ect of gd T cell on chemotherapy-resistant AML cells, whether the resistance aff ect gd T cell cytotoxicity. We focused on this intresting point and accessed the possible eff ect and mechanisms. Methods: gd T cells were expanded in the presence of 2uM zoledronate and IL-2.6 AML cell lines HL-60,NB4,K562 and their chemotherapeutics-resistant cell lines HL-60/ADR,K562/AO2, NB4/R1 as well as primary cells from 15 refractory/resistant AML patients were used as target cells. Cytotoxicity was measured by fl ow cytometry using CFSE and 7-AAD.The extracellular signal-regulatory kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activation was analysed by western blot using the method of mixing gd T cells with an equal number of paraformaldehyde-fi xed target cells.CD107a expression was detected after 4h coincubition of gd T cells and target cells. The surface molecules were detected by fl ow cytometry.Specifi c ERK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 or blocking mAbs were incubated with gd T cells 1 hour before further experiments. Results: gd T cell effi ciently kill chemotherapy-resistant AML primary cells at diff erent eff ect:target(E:T) ratios (Figure1A). The resistance did not decrease T cell cytotoxicity compared with matermal cell lines (Figure1B). gd T cell binding to tumor cells for 5 min was suffi cient to maximally activate ERK1/2, demonstrated by its tyrosine phosphorylation. ERK1/2 activation was achieved in gd T cells after contact with gd T -sensitive K562 and K562/ AO2 cells,but not gd T -resistant HL-60 (Figure1C). PD098059, block degranulation of gd T cells, which occur upon target ligation (Figure1D). PD098059 also inhibited the cytotoxicity of gd T cells. To further clarify the mechanism,we assessed the expression of ligands of CD226, which has been found to play an important role in gd T cell killing AML cells, on diff erent AML subsets above, and found no signifi cant decrease of expression in resistant AML cells(Figure1E). Blocking CD226 inhibited ERK1/2 activation of gd T cells after contact with gd T -sensitive K562 and K562/AO2 cell (Figure1F), and inhibited gd T cell -mediated lysis (Figure1G). Conclusion: These results showed gd T cells effi ciently kill chemotherapy-resistant AML cells, and documented a a pivotal role of CD226 induced ERK1/2 in gd T eff ector function, possibly by its control of movement of lytic granules.",

Composition of T-cell cultures was analyzed by fl ow cytometry (CD4 /CD25 /PD1 /FOXP3 /Helios expression). In vitro alloproliferative capacity of the p-T cells was analyzed with CFSE cell proliferation assay by using them as responder cells in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), with irradiated allo-PB mononuclear cells as stimulators. Results: Proliferation (CFSE stain), activation (CD25+) and exhaustion (PD-1+) was signifi cantly increased in HD p-T cells, as compared to LD p-T cells, np-T or ctl cells. LD-IL2 priming increased the number of CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+/Helios+ natural Tregs (mean\u00b1SEM, 3.3\u00b10.7) as compared to np-T (1.013\u00b10.2), ctl (1.8\u00b10.4) and HD p-T (1.4\u00b10.4) cells. LD p-T cells showed significantly decreased response rate to allo-stimulus in MLC as compared to np-T and ctl cells. Conclusions: Our results indicate that in vitro priming of T cells with low dose of IL-2 reduces their alloproliferative capacity, probably owing to the maintenance of regulatory T cells.

We and other have pioneered the use of len after allogeneic stem cell (allo SCT) transplantation. The drug is known to up regulate pro infl ammatory cytokines like TNF \u03b1 and IFN \u03b1 which might contribute to the incidence of GvHD in the context of allo SCT. In our dose fi nding study we found 18% of infections. We therefore analysed the immunological data for our patients with a focus on the T cell development in patients with a clinical signifi cant infection and those without. Interestingly both groups showed a decrease in their total number of CD3+ T-cells. This eff ect was more prominent in the group with infections. Further the number of CD4+ T helper cells decreased also in both groups but those patients with infections dropped to a level below 200/\u03bcl. In contrast CD8+ T-cells were not aff ected by len treatment. To understand this clinical data we treated T-cells in vivo with len and observed a diff erential response of the CD4 and CD8 compartment towards the drug. While CD4 cells showed a growth arrest, CD8 cells were nearly unaff ected. This observation can be explained by a diff erential expression of p15, a cell cycle inhibitor of the ikn4 locus, in CD4 and CD8 cells after len treatment. We suggest that this diff erential response is accountable for the incidence of GvHD triggered by CD8+ cells and a higher risk for infection due to inbibited CD4+ cells. Therefore we conclude that len treatment beside its eff ects on cytokine expression infl uences the cell cycle regulation in T cells which should be further investigated to understand its way of action on immune cells.",

In order to modulate this disease, regulatory T cells (Treg) have been proposed as a cellular therapy. Treg cells have been described as suppressor of cells that are responsible for GvHD, such as T cells, but on the other hand they also suppress Natural killer (NK) cells, key players of the Graft versus Leukaemia (GvL). It has been showed that Treg cell may suppress NK cells in certain conditions, but no information is available on the eff ects of NK cell diff erentiation. Due to the critical role of NK cells in HSCT, we addressed this question. Because of the rising use of umbilical cord blood (CB) as a source of stem cells for HSCT, this study examined CB NK cell diff erentiation through an in vitro 5-week culture. CD34+ stem cells were cultured in the presence or not of resting or TCR-stimulated allogeneic CB Treg cells. To determine Treg cells eff ect on diff erent stages of diff erentiation, Treg cells were added at a ratio of 1 to 4 (Treg to NK cells) at 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 days of culture. When TCR-stimulated, Treg cells were pre-incubated for 48 hours with plate bound CD3, soluble CD28 and Interleukin-2 and then added to the culture. Interestingly, a 90% reduction in NK cell count was detected when TCR-stimulated Treg cells were added at day 9. In contrast, the remaining had a normal phenotype and was fully functional. Surprisingly, high levels of secretion of IL-10 were observed in this particular condition. No eff ect was observed when resting Treg cells were added to the culture at any time on NK cell count, viability, phenotype and function. These results may strongly suggest an effect on CB NK cell differentiation in vitro by IL-10 CB Treg cells. This study may provide more information to determine if NK cell differentiation and NK cell mediated GvL is impaired by a possible CB Treg cell therapy.",

G\u00f3mez Hoapital universitario Reina Sof\u00eda (Cordoba, ES) Objectives: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a potentially curative modality for hematologic diseases. Donor T cells contained in the graft exert in receptors benefi cial anti-tumor and anti-infection eff ects, but also the detrimental graft versus host disease (GVHD) by recognizing HLA disparities recipient's tissues (skin, liver, gastrointestinal). Analysis and isolation of subpopulations naive-memory T cells involved in GVHD and anti-infective protection is the key to the future development of graft engineering. In this study we sought to determine the correlation of circulating na\u00efve/memory total and CMV-specifi c CD8lymphocytes with clinical variables mainly the incidence of GVHD and CMV-disease. Materials and Methods: We analyzed peripheral blood samples from 19 HLA-I*0201patients (paediatrics n = 7) and adult (n = 12) who underwent HSCT from November 2005 to December 2011. We studied maturation profi le (naive -memory) with CD27, CD45RO, CD62L MnAbs of total CD8 lymphocytes and specifi c anti-CMV characterized with anti-HLA tetramers pp65. Results: The proportion of naive-memory CD8 lymphocytes post-HSCT is greatly skewed according to donors' age, with a statistically signifi cant predominance of population naive CD27 + (p = 0.010) if the donor was younger than 40 years and CD45RO-(p = 0.026) if the donor was older than 40 yrs. Patients who underwent conventional conditioning regimen harboured also statistically signifi cant higher frequency of na\u00efve CD27 + populations than those receiving reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (p=0.034). Although patients who develop acute GVHD contained a larger number of naive CD8+ lymphocytes, these diff erences did not reach statistical signifi cance. We also showed a signifi cantly higher number of population specifi c CD8 anti-CMV (p= 0.033) in patients who developed CMV infection and underwent valganciclovir treatment. Conclusions: Circulating CD8 populations post alo-TPH are signifi cantly infl uenced by donor age and type of conditioning and CD8 + anti-CMV TPH are more frequently detected especially post-post-infection.",

In an allogeneic setting, natural killer (NK) cells have a critical role in graft versus host disease and graft versus leukemia eff ects. However, the impact of G-CSF on NK cells response remains unclear. In this study, we compared NK cell phenotype and functions isolated from PBSC collections from both healthy donors and patients mobilized with G-CSF. Materials and Methods: After informed consent, NK cells were isolated from 150 mL fresh blood sample from healthy donors, 3 mL of fresh PBSC transplant from allogeneic healthy donors and 3 mL of fresh autologous PBSC transplant from patients, enriched using a CD3/CD19 depletion method and expanded for 14 days in the presence of 50 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-15. Expression of NKG2D, KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, KIR2DL5, and CD137 was monitored by fl ow cytometry during expansion and cytokine secretion was followed using Cytometric bead array. NK cell cytotoxicity was evaluated at the end of the culture. Results: Highly T-and B-cell depleted NK cells were obtained. The percentage of CD16+/CD56+ NK cells was signifi cantly diminished in G-CSF mobilized PBSC from patients after expansion and proliferated less than NK cells from normal peripheral blood or G-CSF mobilized PBSC from normal donors. The fi ve receptors studied were up regulated after 14 days of culture, and the expression of NKG2D, KIR2DL1 and CD137 was signifi cantly diff erent between the three origins of NK cells. NK cells sorted from G-CSF mobilized PBSC from patients also exhibited a diminished ability to kill tumor targets. Conclusion: The findings presented here show that G-CSF administration to patients decreases NK cell population, proliferation and function. Overcoming this impairement in lymphoid capacity may be important to facilitate post-transplant immunotherapy.",

Using standard immunological methods, we assessed the eff ects of human and mouse cancer cells on post-activated human and mouse NK cells. Human, allogeneic, malignant cells triggered human NK cell alteration (NKCA) including Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) down-regulation, NK cell loss and apoptosis. In contrast,allogeneic PBMC, depleted of NK cells, failed to induce significant NKCA. Mouse allogeneic leukemia cells induced mouse NK cell loss and apoptosis while syngeneic, allogenic mouse splenocytes, depleted of NK cells, and xenogenic cancer cells did not, suggesting that NKCA preferentially involved allogeneic, malignant cells. After 10 days PBMC culture, in the absence of cancer cells, post-activated and unstimulated NK cells showed some CD16 antigen down-regulation while became resistant to cancer cell dependent NKCA and maintaining cytotoxic function. Actinomycin D restored NKCA in long term NK cells (LTNKC) suggesting that the resistance to NKCA utilized RNA transcription. TAPI-0, a functional analogue of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) 3, reversed cancer cell dependent NKCA underlying a role for a restricted group of metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the generation of this phenomenon. LTNKC resistance to NKCA was associated with increased levels of TIMP3 gene expression and sustained contents of soluble TIMP3 in the supernatants of LTNKC cultures. This study provides evidence that TIMP3 plays a role in the protection of LTNKC from cancer cell dependent NKCA.",

Zhang (2) , X. Zhong (2) , P. Hari (2) Aim: Finding HLA associations for disease in retrospective studies is challenging primarily due to poor statistical power due to unavailability of large well-defi ned case and control datasets. Fortunately, the National Marrow Donor Program (USA) registry has accumulated large numbers of disease cases from patient searches for allogeneic stem cell transplants along with HLAtyped controls from donor recruitment. We aimed to use this data to uncover HLA associations for transplantable diseases. Methods: We developed sets of HLA-typed case/control datasets from the NMDP registry for several US populations. Because most HLA typing has allelic ambiguity, we utilized a multiple imputation framework which assigns allele-level HLA-A~C~B~DRB1~DQB1 haplotype pairs based on a probability distribution calculated from ambiguous subject HLA typing and reference population HLA haplotype frequencies. Replicate studies each with potentially-varying HLA haplotype assignments were performed to ensure that the HLA typing ambiguity was incorporated in the statistical model. We ran multivariate logistic regression using a generalized linear model controlling for the covariates of age, geographic location, and gender to calculate odds ratios, P-values, and 95% confi dence intervals for HLA allele and haplotype variants. Results: In a study of 2,887 European-American Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients compared to 500,000 controls, we found signifi cant HLA associations. B*07:02 was predisposing for MM with an odds ratio (OR)of 1.27 and a P-value of 0.0001. Meanwhile B*44:02 was protective (OR=0.858. P-value=0.0491). Other associations were observed for A*66, B*27, C*16:01. In some cases grouping alleles into allele families resulted in more statistically-signifi cant associations, while in other cases confounding between alleles within a family made grouping undesirable. Combinations of multiple risk variants within haplotype and genotypes had an additive or dose-dependent eff ect. Conclusion: The combination of large registries and the application of this multiple imputation statistical framework provides a unique opportunity to study HLA associations for transplantable disease at a higher resolution than ever. We are expanding this framework to examine amino acid polymorphisms and sequence feature variant types (SFVTs) within HLA molecules. International collaboration with additional registries and experts in disease is needed to fully exploit the potential of this method and secure grant funding.",

Zunec Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb (Zagreb, HR) Chimerism, a state described as a presence of two genetically distinct cell lines in an organism, routinely occurs in patients who were subjected to medical procedures such as transplantation or transfusion. However, this state can also appear naturally, as a consequence of feto-maternal transfer of cells through placenta during pregnancy. In this report, we describe a case of natural chimerism identifi ed during a routine histocompatibility testing. S164 A six months old boy was diagnosed with a Severe Combined Immunodefi ciency Syndrome (SCID). In preparation for Hematopoietic Stell Cell Transplantation (HSCT), the patient and his parents underwent HLA testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 typing was performed by Luminex technology. Typing results of the patient's HLA-B locus were not interpretable. All samples were re-typed for HLA-B by PCR-SSP. Patient's sample could not be interpreted using commercial software due to several weak positive reactions. The typing was repeated on a sample of patient's bone marrow and the results were again non-interpretable. The analysis was extended to HLA-C locus, however, the patient's alleles were again not possible to determine due to several weak reactions, either for blood or bone marrow. Five out of 16 microsatellites (HUMTH01, HUMSE33, D1S1656, D18S535, D15S659) were informative and demonstrated three alleles in patient's sample (two maternal and one paternal) out of which paternal allele appeared with a distinctly lower intensity. The retrospective manual interpretation of results obtained for HLA-B and -C loci revealed that weak positive reactions were indeed due to the paternal HLA-B and -C alleles and that the patient had both maternal and one paternal allele. Finally, the DNA from patient's buccal cells was isolated and HLA-B and -C loci were re-typed by PCR-SSP. The analysis revealed that the patient inherited one paternal and one maternal allele. This fi nding was confi rmed by analysis of informative microsatellites, which demonstrated only one maternal and one paternal allele in patient's buccal cells. The initial failure to recognize the chimeric state of the patient was due to the mother's homozygosity at the HLA-A and -DRB1 loci. In summary, combination of several diff erent typing methods including the manual interpretation of results was necessary to obtain the HLA typing results of the patient and subsequent successful search for an unrelated donor.",

HLA-A*/B*/C*/DRB1*/ DQB1* genotyping was done using PCR-SSP Kits (Invitrogen, WI, USA). Results: 21 out of defi ned HLA haplotypes occurred in our patients three and more times. Our patients carried all of the 10 most frequent Caucasoid haplotypes, but their distribution had some peculiarities. The most frequent haplotype was A*03-B*07-C*07-DRB1*15-DQB1*06, which was identifi ed in 17 patients (8.5%). 13 patients (6.5%) carried A*01-B*08-C*07-DRB1*03-DQB1*02.

Iniotaki General Hospital of Athens ''G.Gennimatas'' (Athens, GR) Aim:To evalute Sequence Based Typing(SBT) as a method for HLA four digit high resolution typing and allele identifi cation in patients for hematopoietic stem cells transplantation and their potential unrelated donors. Methods: 559 HLA-A,-B,-C and DRB1 loci were tested and analyzed by SBT using commercial SBT kits,an automatic AB 3500XL Analyser and the kits software. Exons 2,3 and 4 were analyzed for class I and exon 2 for class II loci. For allelic ambiguities defi nition we used Heterozyguous Ambiguity Resolution Sequencing Primers (HARPs). All loci were typed in parallel with HR SSO/SSP. Results: Unambiguous four digit allelic results were observed for 223/559(39,9%) loci by SBT. Using HARPs we were able to improve the resolution for 160(28,6%) more loci, achiving a total of 383(68,5%) unambiguous results. For the rest 176(31,5%) loci further testing needed to rule out the ambiguities from 18,3% HLA-A, 36,1% HLA-B,70,3 % HLA-C and 21,7% HLA-DRB1 loci. Analysing the results from SSO/SSP typing we resolved ambiguities in 136/176 loci while 40 remained unresolved and assigned using NMDP guidelines and population frequence tables. Conclusions:Implementation of SBT increases alleles resolution but we still need SSO/SSP to rule out ambiguities. In order to increase allele resolution using SBT it is necessary to extend the analysis to other exons and proceed to new HARPs. Objectives: We and others have reported abnormalities in the regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Because of the clinical similarities between chronic GvHD and scleroderma (SSc), we analyzed the Treg lymphocytes of pediatric SSc patients (jSSc) and identifi ed decreases in both resting and activated Treg lymphocytes. In addition, we identifi ed an increased frequency of CD45RA expressing eff ector memory (EMRA) CD4 T lymphocytes that uniformly express CCR7 and CD28, which are not uniformly expressed by the increased EMRA T lymphocytes present in elderly individuals. We, therefore, cross-sectionally analyzed allogeneic pediatric HSCT recipients more than 1 year following HSCT for the presence of CCR7 expressing EMRA CD4 T lymphocytes as possible eff ector T lymphocytes in chronic GvHD. Methods: HSCT recipients were classifi ed as 1: no history of acute or chronic GvHD; 2: history of only acute GvHD; 3: active chronic GvHD; and 4: history of resolved chronic GvHD. Peripheral blood leukocytes of the normal individuals and the HSCT recipients were analyzed by FACS analysis for the frequency of EMRA CD4 T lymphocytes and their expression of CCR7 in addition to quantifying the frequency of resting and activated Treg lymphocytes using the Miyara classifi cation and 6 color FACS analysis. Results: Elevated frequencies of EMRA CD4 T lymphocytes were present in all HSCT groups except HSCT recipients with only a history of acute GvHD (Group 2). Increased expression of CCR7 by the EMRA T lymphocytes was present in all HSCT recipients except those with a history of only acute GvHD. HSCT recipients without a history of GvHD or resolved chronic GvHD (Groups 1 and 4) had relatively normal numbers of resting Treg (rTreg) lymphocytes while HSCT recipients with active chronic GvHD or a history of only acute GvHD had reduced frequencies of rTreg lymphocytes. Conclusion: CCR7 expressing EMRA CD4 T lymphocytes may be an eff ector T lymphocyte population in the pathogenesis of human chronic GvHD in the content of abnormalities of rTreg lymphocytes. The presence of adequate numbers of rTreg lymphocytes can result in an absence of chronic GvHD or its clinical resolution in spite of the presence of increased numbers of CCR7 expressing EMRA T lymphocytes. Thus, active chronic GvHD may be due to the action of CCR7 expressing EMRA CD4 T lymphocytes in the context of immune dysregulation.",

Zabelina, L. Bussmann, R. Veit, C. Wolschke, H. Lellek, U. Bacher, A.R. Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major cause of mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Till date there are no validated biomarkers predicting the outcome of patients (pts) who develop aGVHD. A decrease in serum albumin \u2265 5g/dL from pre-transplant baseline to development of aGVHD has been reported to predict outcome of aGVHD after non-myeloablative conditioning. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 495 consecutive adult patients who underwent allo-SCT at our center between 2005 and 2009. All pts received myeloablative conditioning which was full intensity in 123 (39.9%) and reduced intensity in 185 (60.1%) pts. AGVHD was recorded as from day 5 till 100 after transplant. GVHD was graded according to Przepiorka et al. and treated with 2mg/kg methylprednisolone. The impact of the initial grade of aGVHD, serum albumin and other relevant pre-transplant donor and patient characteristic on overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios. Results: In all, 308 pts (62%) developed aGVHD grades I-IV which was initial grade I in 118 (38,3%), II in 127 (41,2%) III in 48 (15,6%) [P631] S168 an IV in 15 (4,9%) pts. 1 year OS was 82%, 65% and 60% % for grades I, II and III respectively und 60% for II-IV combined. Only 1/15 pts with aGVHD IV was alive after 3 months. Pre-transplant albumin level did not signifi cantly impact 1/5 yr. survival (65/48% vs. 71/54%, p = 0.3). for patients with albumin \u2264 34 (low) and > 34 (high) respectively. Neither did decrease \u2265 5g/dL from pre-transplant baseline to development of aGVHD (56/49%% vs. 70/52%, p = 0.42). However serum albumin level at time of diagnosis of aGVHD predicted outcome: 1/5 yr OS was 60/40% for pts with low vs. 75/63% for pts with high albumin, p = 0.001. In patients with gastrointestinal (GI) aGVHD II-IV (n = 50) 1 yr OS was 32% for low vs. 68% for high albumin, p = 0.01. On the other hand, survival of patients with only skin aGVHD II-IV (n = 68) was 72% for both low and high albumin. Results of cox regression multivariate analysis are summarized in table 1. Conclusion: Our results indicate that serum albumin is a relevant prognostic biomarker in adult patients who develop GI-aGVHD after myeloablative conditioning.",

It is known that NK cells are a heterogeneous population and can be divided into functionally distinct NK cell subpopulations. Murine NK cells can be separated along their expression of CD27 and CD11b and CD117 (c-kit). However, the functional relevance of distinct NK cell subsets in graft-versushost-disease (GVHD) has not been investigated in detail so far. Here we report on diff erent genomic, phenotypic, functional and migratory properties of four distinct NK cell subsets. Our data clearly demonstrate that CD27+ NK cells revealed the highest IFN-g production upon coculture with tumor cells and/or IL-2, whereas the CD11b+ NK cells express multiple genes of cytotoxic pathways and develop the highest cytotoxic capacity towards tumor cells. Furthermore, the CD11b+ NK cell subset signifi cantly reduced T cell proliferation induced by allogeneic dendritic cells in mixed lymphocytes reactions. Next, we analyzed the migratory capacity and tissue-specifi c homing of the diff erent NK cell subsets by in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of adoptively transferred FACS-sorted Luc+CD45.1+ NK subpopulations in autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

BLI of Luc+CD11b+ NK cells revealed that this subset migrates to the colonic tissue to prevent development of GVHD colitis as shown by colonoscopy. In summary, our comparative study outlines that only CD11b+ NK cells, migrating to the peripheral GVHD target organs and providing the most effi cient cytolytic capacity directed against allogeneic dendritic cells, protect against GVHD.

Polymorphisms at genes coding for several proinfl ammatory cytokines and for their related receptors or receptor inhibitors are involved in this complication. To assess the role of cytokine gene polymorphisms on acute GvHD (aGVHD), we analysed 189 pairs of donor and recipients transplanted from HLA identical sibling for malignant hematological diseases between 2000 and 2007. The median recipients age at transplantation was 43.4 years . Two third of the patients received bone marrow before myelo-ablative conditioning regimen, the median delay between diagnosis and transplantation was 9 months (1-76). Five diff erent polymorphisms from 3 cytokine genes were analyzed: IL-10 -592C/A, -819C/T and -1082G/A, IL-1\u03b2 -511A/G and TGF\u03b21 -509C/T. All the pairs were studied for each gene polymorphism using the Taqman technology as previously described (Malkki 2007) . Univariate analysis found a signifi cant negative impact of donor genotypes carrying IL1\u03b2 A allele (p=0,02) or IL10-592 A allele (p=0,03) on aGvHD. We did not fi nd any eff ect associated with IL10-819 and -1082 polymorphisms, but as previously described (Lin 2003) , the presence of IL10 A-T-A haplotype in the donor, signifi cantly increased the risk of aGVHD (p=0.043). We performed a multivariate analysis on aGVHD incidence taking into account TGF\u03b21-509, IL-10-592 and IL1\u03b2 polymorphisms, together with other known risk factors.

The role of the cytokine cascade in the physiopathology of GVHD is well established. Our study documents the possible role of IL-1\u03b2, TGF\u03b21 and IL10 gene polymorphisms in this setting. A proven association of cytokine gene polymorphisms with acute GVHD would enable the clinician to modify the therapeutic strategy and enhance the outcomes. Background: Genetic aberration of TNFRSF14 occurs in half of patients (pts) with follicular lymphoma (FL). TNFRSF14 is a ligand for BTLA, a receptor which inhibits T cell responses. Activated B cells effi ciently present antigens, and BTLA signaling is important in control of donor T cell alloresponses that mediate acute graftversus-host-disease (aGvHD) after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). We therefore hypothesized that TNFRSF14 aberrations in FL may reduce BTLA-mediated inhibition of alloreactive donor T cells after AHSCT resulting in increased frequency or severity of aGvHD. Objective: To investigate the impact of TNFRSF14 aberrations on outcome of FL pts undergoing AHSCT. Methods: 21 FL pts undergoing T-cell replete reduced-intensity conditioned AHSCT were included in the study. Tumour DNA from pre-ASCT lymph node biopsies was screened for TNFRSF14 mutations and deletions by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-probe amplifi cation respectively. Cumulative incidence (CI) of aGvHD and treatment-related mortality (TRM) were calculated with FL progression as a competing risk. Results: TNFRSF14 aberrations were identifi ed in 10/21 pts (48%). 5 pts had mutations (of which 4 had deletions of the second allele) and 5 pts had deletions without mutations. Disease and donor characteristics were similar in pts with and without aberrations. There was no signifi cant diff erence in the CI of aGvHD in pts with or without TNFRSF14 aberrations. However all 4 pts that died from aGVHD had TNFRSF14 aberrations (3 pts had mutations, 2 with additional deletions of the other allele). There was a signifi cantly higher CI of death from aGvHD and a trend to lower overall survival in pts with TNFRSF14 aberrations compared to those without TNFRSF14 aberrations (38% vs. 0% (p=0.03, Fig. 1 ) and 40% vs. 74% (p=0.06, Fig. 2 ) respectively). Conclusions: This study is the fi rst to describe the potential impact of TNFRSF14 aberrations in FL on outcome after AHSCT. Even in this small cohort of pts, the presence of TNFRSF14 aberrations, particularly biallelic loss, was associated with increased death from aGvHD. These fi ndings require confi rmation in a larger cohort and in vitro studies to determine the functional impact of TNFRSF14 aberrations on allogeneic T cell responses. However, our results suggest FL patients with TNFRSF14 aberrations may benefi t from more aggressive immunosuppression to reduce the incidence of fatal aGvHD after AHSCT. (1) ",

Especially the outcome of patients with severe steroid-resistant aGVHD remains very poor. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of aGVHD are needed. Objective: The feasibility of the generation of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) expanded with human plasma and platelet lysate (hPPL) was tested as well as the feasibility and safety of S170 the application of hPPL-MSC in patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD. As mechanisms in humans are poorly understood, phenotypical and functional changes in immunological cell types and cytokine levels were investigated before, during and after infusion of MSC. Methods: 50 patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD grade II to IV were included in an open-label, non-randomized prospective phase I/II study and received up to four MSC infusions. Clinical parameters as well as a comprehensive phenotypical and functional analysis was performed. Results: Between January 2009 and July 2012, 50 patients were included, 2 patients dropped out due to fast relapse of their primary malignancy. 48 patients were thus available for analysis of whom 7 children. Median overall grade was III, organs involved were skin (52%), gastrointestinal tract (88%) and liver (35%). No severe side effects were observed. Complete overall response was observed in 24 patients (50%) after a median of 53 days (range 3-116 days). The overall survival was significantly better in responders when compared to non-responders (p <0.001). Immunological monitoring suggests that anti-viral and anti-leukemia reactive T-cells are well preserved in all patients who responded to MSC treatment. In addition, we identified biomarkers which associate even 2 weeks after MSC infusion with a complete resolution of GVHD, which occurred usually after months and studied the microenvironment of the gut in selected patients. Conclusion: Generation and infusion of hPPL-MSCs in steroidresistant aGVHD grade II-IV is feasible, safe and appears to be eff ective. Infusion of MSC did not impair anti-virus and antileukemia reactive T-cells. Identifi ed biomarkers predict very early a usually late clinical resolution of GVHD, cellular biomarkers are found to be located within the gut and are thus most likely both, relevant for the biology of the disease and useful to early guide clinical decisions.",

Ten peptides have been identifi ed to date as various collagen fragments (indicating disturbances in metabolism of collagen or early organ damage), fragments of fi bronectin and albumin. In addition, fragments of \u03b2-2-microglobulin (\u03b22M) and CD99, an activation marker of T-cells, are excreted in patients with aGvHD depending on severity.

Elafi n and HGF were not useful to distinguish patients with aGvHD or cGvHD from those without. None of the known plasma biomarker were able to distinguish acute from chronic GvHD, as they are rather marker for infl ammatory processes. But our results confi rm that \u03b22M and CD99 are fi rst of all detectable in urine and plasma of patients with aGvHD and secondly diff erentially excreted according to severity of disease. In addition, both marker are capable of distinguishing patients with aGvHD from those with cGvHD with high sensitivity and specifi city. Reproducibility of the preliminary results and the predictive power of those biomarker will be tested in a blinded, prospective validation set.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DC) are centrally involved in the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hemopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) and previous work has shown that DC expression of the activation marker CMRF-44 correlated with subsequent acute GVHD. The traffi cking of immature DC from blood to GVHD target organs is likely to be regulated by chemokine receptors expressed on activated DC and published data suggests that CCR5 is important in alloHCT. We found diff erences in chemokine receptor expression on DC subsets in normal individuals and showed that, although the major CD16+ myeloid blood DC subpopulation did not express CCR5, it was induced on CD16+ DC after culture in allogeneic MLR supernatant, an eff ect mediated largely by interferon-\u03b3. In 42 patients monitored to day 100 post alloHCT, CCR5 was expressed on a signifi cant proportion of CD16+ DC (p = 0.0001, compared to normal cells). The maximum percentage of CCR5+ CD16+ DC in patients at any time post-transplant correlated with acute GVHD: mean 27.5% (0-50%) in GVHD grades II-IV, mean 11.6% (0-44; p=0.0006) in grades 0-I. The maximum percentage CCR5 positive prior to developing grades II-IV GVHD (mean 22.7%, 0-50%) was higher than in grades 0-I GVHD (mean 11.4%, 0-38%) (p=0.0285). CCR5 levels >20.5% on CD16+ myeloid DC predicted grades II-IV GVHD with a sensitivity of 66.7% and specifi city of 86.7%. These observations may refl ect DC activation and altered DC homing during the alloimmune response to alloHCT, and could allow early therapeutic intervention prior to the clinical diagnosis of GVHD. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) of the skin following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is diffi cult to clinically diff erentiate from other underlying causes. Elafi n has been reported to be specifi c for skin-aGvHD, but no longitudinal follow-up is available as to whether elafi n can predict response to steroids. We aimed to determine in a retrospective longitudinal study the role of elafi n in monitoring skin aGVHD. All children transplanted in our unit between 2004-2012 who developed severe (\u2265 grade 2) aGvHD with skin involvement (n=33) were evaluated. Skin biopsies (n=31) from 25 aGvHD patients were available and compared to 23 biopsies from patients without aGvHD (n=13) or non-HSCT recipients. Biopsies were stained for elafi n, a biomarker reported to be specifi c for skin-aGvHD. The intensity of Elafi n expression on skin biopsies was scored and the mean score was signifi cantly higher in skin-aGVHD biopsies than in controls (4.3 versus 1.8; p<0.0001). In addition, Elafi n scores in biopsies after HSCT distinguished aGvHD from other causes (sensitivity 88.5%, specifi city 92.3%) Biopsies especially in children are not always feasible and ELISA for biomarkers are commercially available giving results within 4 hours. Elafi n and three other previously reported biomarkers, sIL2Ra, HGF and TNFR1, were longitudinally measured in sera from pre-HSCT until at least day 50 after aGvHD. Sera of 27 patients were available. At the start of aGvHD, Elafi n, sIL-2Ra and sTNFR1 concentrations in serum were signifi cantly elevated, compared with samples before onset of skin-aGvHD (p=0.007, <0.0001 and 0.0002). In addition, these concentrations were signifi cantly higher than serum levels in patients without aGvHD (n=12). Only elafi n concentrations correlated at the day of biopsy with the pathology report showing increased levels in aff ected patients (p=0.0021). HGF concentrations were signifi cantly lower in patients refractory to steroids prior to and at onset of aGvHD. Based on these data, sIl-2Ra and sTNFR1 are not specifi c for skin GvHD and may be related to other organs involved in aGvHD. In contrast, serum elafi n is a suitable alternative for diagnostic biopsies for skin-aGvHD. However response to steroids cannot be predicted on the basis of Elafi n concentrations. Early intervention with second line salvage therapy should be considered in patients with low HGF concentrations. Assessing response to treatment of gastrointestinal acute graftversus-host disease (aGvHD) may be hampered by persistent diarrhea resulting from damage to the gut in the absence of ongoing aGvHD. Histological examination of gut biopsies confi rm the diagnosis but are invasive. Biomarkers may be an alternative diagnostic tool. We aimed to study biopsies and biomarkers to evaluate the response to treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in children. In this study, 22 patients received MSC for severe steroid refractory aGvHD of the gut (confi rmed by a biopsy in 20 patients). In 82% (n=18) diarrhea persisted after the fi rst MSC and a second (and in 3 cases a third) MSC infusion was considered. A second gut biopsy was taken from 12 patients before subsequent MSC infusion and in 8 of these biopsies no signs of active aGvHD were seen. Three patients with a positive biopsy responded to subsequent MSC infusion. Eleven patients showed a complete (CR), 6 a partial response (PR) and 5 no response at 28 days after starting MSC therapy (1-3 infusions) . In addition, previously reported biomarkers were assessed. Patient samples were longitudinally measured starting before SCT until 50 days after the last MSC infusion. At the start of aGvHD, serum concentrations of sIL-2R\u03b1, sTNFR1, REG3\u03b1 and soluble cytokeratin 18 fragment (sCK18F) were signifi cantly elevated compared with samples before onset. Response to MSC at day 28 was predicted by sIL-2R\u03b1 concentrations on day 7 post MSC. Patients with CR/PR (n=17) had lower sIL-2R\u03b1 concentrations compared to non-responders (n=5) (p=0.015). sCK18F at start of aGvHD and at initiation of MSC therapy discriminate between CR and PR/NR (p=0.01). Serum levels of sCK18F were signifi cantly raised at the day of a positive gut biopsy ( Figure 1 ). Individual results of these tests showed a wide variation in values. Conclusion: This is the fi rst report to assess the usefulness of biopsy versus biomarkers in children with aGvHD treated with MSC. Biopsy evaluation after MSC infusion eff ectively distinguishes children requiring additional MSC infusions. We confi rm that biomarkers are elevated at the onset of GvHD and although predictive of those children who responded to MSC therapy, failed to distinguish between persistent aGvHD and post infl ammatory malabsorption ( Figure 2 ). Sequential biopsies remain essential and should be included in clinical trials of experimental cellular therapy. Further study of biomarkers is warranted.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantations(HSCT) were performed between 1995 and 2012. Diseases were non malignant inherited diseases (63%) and hematological malignancies (37%). Median age was 4,3 years. Donors were Matched-related (27%), Matchedunrelated (32%), Mismatched-unrelated (13%), Haplo-identical (21%) and Cord Blood (7%). The graft source was BM (80%),PBSC (12%) and CB (8%). 37% patients had a myeloablative conditioning. The median time to aGVHD was 13 days after HSCT. The baseline grade of aGVHD was I in 19%, II 46%, III 25% and IV 10%. The median delay between aGVHD and Inolimomab was 16 days. The median dose was 0.4mg/kg and the median treatment duration of 27 days. We observe 55% complete responses and 14% partial responses for a total response rate of 69% and with no side eff ects. Among the responders, 26% relapse. Incidence of infection during treatment was 19%. A logistic model on complete response provide evidence of the high predictive negative eff ect of the GVHD baseline grade [Odds Ratio(OR): 5.24]. No particular target organ was a signifi cant predictive factor for treatment response or survival. However, multi-organ involvement predicted worse survival with 34%, 45% and 52% of death for patients with one, two, and three or more organs involved, respectively (p=0.234). The observed overall survival probability was 59%, with a median survival time of 463 days. Survival was also signifi cantly improved for responders (Relative Risk: 0.413; p=0.002). As shown by multivariate Cox model, the survival was signifi cantly lower for patients with non malignant inherited diseases [Hazard Ratio (HR) =2.88, p<.001] compared with hematological malignancies, and female patients were associated with higher mortality (HR=1.72, p=.049). For both response and survival, the success rates were signifi cantly increasing with year of transplantation. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) occurred in 56% patients, extensive in 42%. cGVHD incidence was 78%, 72%, 42% for Non Responders, Partial Responders and Complete Responders (Anova, p=.017). Patients with hematological malignancies were observed with signifi cantly less cGHVD (OR=.29, p=.012). Fifty-one patients died, 17(33%) before day 100 and 34(67%) after day 100, mostly of infections (55%) and GVHD (51%).

We conducted a phase I//IIa clinical trial where we treated 13 patients (median age, 37 years; range, 20-59 years) with advanced hematologic malignancies (7 patients with ALL, 5 patients with AML (4 patients with MDS that transformed to AML and one patient with AML de novo), and 1 patient with CML that received conventional myeloablation with 35, or 70, or 140, or 210x106 cell/kg of donor ApoCell, on day -1 of transplantation. Ten serious adverse eff ects were reported with all being not related (seven) or unlikely to be related (3) to ApoCell infusion. Out of hundreds adverse eff ects, only three were reported as possibly related to ApoCell infusion (with no defi nite or probable adverse eff ects). The non-relapse mortality at day 100 and 180 after transplantation was the same, 7.7%. The overall survival at 100 and 180 days after transplantation was 92% and 85%, respectively. The incidences of acute grades II through IV GVHD for all 13 patients and for the two higher doses were 23% and 0% (six patients), respectively. Biomarker ratio levels including tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFR1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin 2 receptor \u03b1 (IL-2Ra), and interleukin 7 (IL-7), supported the clinical data. These results suggest that single-infusion high-dose donor early apoptotic cells in HLA-matched myeloablative alloBMT is a safe and potentially eff ective single-agent prophylaxis of acute GVHD occurring after myeloablative alloBMT. Introduction: In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the anti-CD52 antibody Alemtuzumab is frequently used for T-cell depletion (TCD) to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). We demonstrated long term persistence of functionally impaired glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor negative eff ector T-cells in patients receiving high dose (100mg) Alemtuzumab in combination with a dose reduced conditioning regimen (Fludarabin/Melphalan). Despite TCD, half of our patients developed acute GVHD. Since regulatory T cells (Treg) play a major role in GVHD, we asked whether GPI-anchor negative Treg are present in our patients. Methods: We analyzed peripheral blood samples of 12 patients with acute GVHD (aGVHD), 7 with chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and 10 patients without GVHD after Alemtuzumab-mediated TCD. Treg were identifi ed as CD3+CD4+CD25+ cells either FoxP3+ or CD127-and investigated according to their CD52-expression. FLAER staining confi rmed that the lack of CD52 was due to missing GPI-anchors. We analyzed the activation-markers GARP, HLA-DR and CD45RA and studied Treg populations in the time course of patients who recovered from aGVHD and those with ongoing late aGVHD. In individual patients, we isolated GPI-anchor positive and negative Treg by FACS-Sort, expanded them and performed Treg suppression assays. Results: GPI-anchor negative Treg were observed in all patients. The percentage of GPI-anchor negative Treg was signifi cantly elevated in patients with aGVHD: median 80.35% (range 56,2-96,8%) in comparison to 17,4% (range 0-57,8%) in patients with cGVHD or without GVHD. Activated Treg were exclusively detected among GPI-anchor positive Treg. Patients resolving from aGVHD restored GPI-anchor positive and activated Treg. The percentage of GPIanchor negative Treg populations remained high in patients with ongoing aGVHD and we found no activated Treg even under long term immunosuppression. First experiments with sorted Treg suggest that GPI-anchor negative Treg were unable to suppress T-cell proliferation. Summary: We demonstrated for the fi rst time the reconstitution of GPI-anchor negative Treg in patients following Alemtuzumabmediated TCD. These Treg were functionally altered and less likely to exhibit an activated phenotype. Ongoing aGVHD was associated with high percentages of GPI-anchor negative Treg suggesting that their functional alteration might play a role in aGVHD pathophysiology.",

To reduce the incidence of infections in the setting of haploidentical T-replete (TR-H) bone marrow transplantation patients developing aGVHD, we decide to perfom ECP as fi rst line therapy to treat aGVHD. Patients and methods: Since 2009, 43 received TR-H with NMA/ RIC regimens. Patient characteristics are listed in table 1. Conditioning regimens consisted of Cy, fl udarabine, and low dose TBI in 40 patients, and thiotepa, fl udarabine, Cy and low dose TBI for 6 patients. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of Cy 50 mg/kg day +3 and +4, tacrolimus and MMF, from d+5. ECP was performed using the off -line technique and started as soon as possible after aGVHD diagnosis. The ECP schedule consisted of 4 rounds of two procedures per week, 3 rounds of two procedures every other week, and fi nally 2 procedures every month until clinical improvement. Decision to discontinue ECP was made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account clinical response (including IST changes), logistical reasons, and the decision of the treating physician. Results: Grade 1-4 aGVHD was diagnosed in 13 patients (30%) and grade 2-4 aGVHD in 10 (23%). The median time to aGVHD was 52 days (d) (range 38-81). All patients had grade 2 skin aGVHD and only 1 grade 4 liver aGVHD. Three patients received steroids because of logistical problems. 7 out of 10 patients was treated by ECP alone. In 3 patients steroids therapy was administered waiting for ECP and stopped in a week. ECP was started after a median time of 3 d (range 1-30) from aGVHD diagnosis. The median number of ECP was 15 (range 9-44) and the median duration was 99 d (range 40-368). All but one patient achieved complete response, and 1 partial remission. One patient achieved partial remission. The median time to response was 14 d (range . Tolerance to ECP was good and no patients developed severe toxicities. Infectious complications after ECP were rare and no lifethreatening. Chronic GVHD was diagnosed in 2 patients (18%). 4 patients died: 1 from heart failure secondary to hemocromatosis, 2 from disease progression and 1 from aGVHD toxicity after donor lymphocyte infusions for treat relapsed disease. Conclusions: This study suggests that fi rst line ECP is eff ective and well tolerated in patients developing aGVHD after TR-H. However, these results are preliminary and have to be confi rmed in a more consistent cohort of patients.",

GSTT1 is absent in 20% of the Caucasian population, while GSTM1 in 50%. In liver and renal transplantation, we have reported that GSTT1-negative patients who received a GSTT1positive graft have a higher risk to develop chronic rejection. In addition, UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B17 (UGT2B17) catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid. This protein is highly expressed in liver and prostatic tissues and is absent in 12% of the Caucasian population; UGT2B17-mismatch is a risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the infl uence of these mHAs in the development of acute or chronic hepatic (h) GVHD. One hundred forty-four patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT, between 2003 and 2011 in Hospital Virgen del Roc\u00edo (Seville, Spain), were included in the study. Methods: We performed the mHAs genotyping by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of recipient DNA and their corresponding donors. Three combination groups are detailed in Table 1 . We consider mismatch the null-donor and positive-recipient combination and matched the other three possible combinations. Conclusions: In conclusion, we identify GSTT1 disparity as a risk factor to develop acute and chronic hepatic GVHD and to infl uence survival after HSCT.",

            "text": "Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only cure for most haematological neoplasms, however the mortality rate is high (40 to 60%) and recovery is mainly limited by complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). High resolution HLA matching has improved survival in HSCT over recent years, however acute GVHD (aGVHD) still remains a serious complication. Specifi c novel diagnostic markers that would predict for the occurrence and severity of aGVHD could reduce the incidence and mortality of this disease. There is substantial evidence to indicate that the inappropriate production of cytokines and chemokines contribute to the pathogenesis of aGVHD. The aim of study was to investigate the expression of selected candidate genes in order to identify novel early diagnostic markers for GVHD which may in the future reduce the rate of mortality of this disease. Methods: In order to investigate gene expression in aGVHD we used RNA from a human skin explant assay which has been shown to predict GVHD in patient cohorts and in addition RNA from clinical aGVHD skin samples taken at the onset of aGVHD and normal skin samples. For our initial screening process we used three custom taqman low density arrays and then further validated these results. Results: Our study identifi ed four genes whose expression was signifi cantly up regulated in aGVHD skin, they were, CXC chemokine type 9 (CXCL9), transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1), leucocyte immunoglobulin like receptor type 5 (LILRA5) and ubiquitin D (UBD) (p=0.0007, 0.0174, 0.0402 and 0.0441 respectively). In addition we identifi ed three genes, complement C1Q and tumour necrosis factor-related protein 7 (C1QTNF7), interleukin 1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2) and leucocyte specifi c transcript 1 (LST1), whose expression was signifi cantly down regulated in aGVHD skin (p=0.0002, 0.0028 and 0.0138 respectively). Six of these genes CXCL9, TAP1, LILRA5, UBD, IL1R2 and LST1 are induced by IFN \u03b3 whereas C1QTNF7 is an adipokine, members of the adipokine family have been associated with the innate immune response. Conclusion: These seven genes or their protein products could potentially be used as diagnostic markers for GVHD or in predicting its severity and are currently being evaluated in independent cohorts.",

            "text": "Introduction: Clinical advantage of human fetal membranes cells (hFMCs) has been documented in more than 100 years ago in burns. In recent years hFMCs raised signifi cant attention as source of stromal cells and may also be of potential benefi t in regenerative medicine. We have previously shown that hFMCs suppress human lymphocyte proliferation in vitro in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and may reverse graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in vivo. Further studies have shown that suppressive function of hFMCs is dependent on cell-to-cell contact. In the present report we evaluate the suppressive function of hFMCs in xenogeneic setting to explore the underlying immunosuppressive mechanisms. Methods: Isolated hFMCs from passage 3 or 4 were used in series of ex vivo MLC and in vivo (mouse model GVHD) animal experiments. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, as two allogeneic strains, were used for MLC experiments as well as donor and recipient in an experimental GVHD setting. Results: Our fi ndings show that despite species diff erences, hFMCs suppress proliferation and activation of mouse lymphocytes. The immunosuppressive eff ect is not strain limited and lymphocytes from both strains were suppressed. Balb/c lymphocyte proliferation, against allogeneic (B6 lymphocyte), mitogen (Con A) and xenogeneic (human PBL) stimulation, were decreased by 75% to 80% following addition of 25% of hFMC to the culture. Similar fi nding were observed when C57BL/6 splenocyte were used as responder cells. The immunosuppressive function of hFMCs was not due to T reg cell induction or through trans-well culture setting, meaning that cell to cell contact was needed. Subsequently we applied hFMCs at diff erent time points following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in a well-established mouse model of GVHD. The preliminary results are promising and infusion of hFMCs 3 days after allogeneic BMT increased survival of the animals. However, the hFMCs cell dose and injection time need to be optimized. Conclusion: FMCs may be a valuable source of stromal cells for GVHD. The isolated FMCs are strong immunesuppressive cells not only in allogeneic setting but also in xenogeneic systems. Further improvements regarding isolation, culture and application are needed. Introduction: Although multiple biomarkers of acute intestinal GVHD (GI-GVHD) have been identifi ed, the translation of these from the bench to the bedside remains complex. The aim of this study was to evaluate fecal calprotectin (FC) as a single biomarker for the diagnosis and follow up of GI-GVHD in adult patients with haematological malignancies who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) at our center. Patients and Methods: From January 2012, 22 consecutive SCT patients had been monitored for FC (normal range: 0-50 mg/kg) with at least 2 samples/patient (range 2-13). Fecal samples were collected at 2 week intervals until day 90 from SCT or at the onset of symptoms of GI-GVHD, even after day 90. Table 1 summarizes patients' characteristics. The diagnosis of GI-GVHD was based on standard clinical criteria, together with other microbiological and histopathological tests.",

In this group FC median value was 467mg/kg (range 29-5000) at the onset of symptoms; only one of these 7 patients presented FC levels in the normal ranges at the diagnosis and during follow-up (<50mg/kg). In one of the 22 patients included in the study the clinical diagnosis of GI-GVHD was not supported by the endoscopic and histological fi ndings and in this patient, the FC median value was 60mg/kg (range 6,25-120). FC median value in all other 14/22 patients (64%) without GI-GVHD was 44mg/kg (range 6-163). For a cut-off point value of 200mg/kg, sensitivity for the test was 86%, specifi city 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 94%. We couldn't observe a correlation between FC levels at the onset of GVHD and severity of clinical symptoms. In fact FC median value was 728mg/kg (range: 258-5000) in patients in stage 1 GVHD compared with 467mg/kg (range: 29-3121) in patients in stage 2-4. We observed that patients achieving stable FC values under 200mg/ kg at the follow-up (in 4 of the 6 patients with abnormal FC fi ndings at the onset of GVHD -true positive) had a more favourable outcome and prognosis. Conclusion: Our data confirm that FC is specific, inexpensive, non-invasive test and easy to perform. This biomarker can improve the diagnosis of acute GI-GVHD with an optimal cutoff level of 200mg/kg. This test seems to be promising also for the evaluation of the activity of GI-GVHD during follow-up and it could be used as a potential decisional tool for anti GVHD therapy modulation.",

            "text": "Objective: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotential cells which are capable of diff erentiating into a variety of cell types. Due to their immunomodulatory properties, MSCs have been used as cell-based therapy to reduce grafts-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). As reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) constitutes a frequent problem after HSCT, we studied whether MSCs may also have an infl uence on CMV-specifi c T cell responses. Methods: For mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), CD8 negative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donor A were co-incubated with CD8 positive cells from donor B (APC:T cell ratio=8:1) for 6 days. MACS\u00ae-purifi ed CD8 positive T cells from buff y coats of HLA-A2/CMV seropositive healthy volunteers were stimulated with a HLA-A*0201-restricted CMVpp65 (NLVPMVATV) peptide in a mixed lymphocyte-peptide culture (MLPC). Bonemarrow derived MSCs from human platelet lysate (PL) or fetal calf serum (FCS) based medium were co-cultured with the MLR and MLPC. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays were used to study the immunomodulatory eff ect of MSCs on CMV-specifi c CD8 positive T cells. Results: Both PL-and FCS-cultured MSCs inhibited the proliferation of CD8 positive T cells after stimulation with CMV pp65 peptide, and reduced the number of CMV-specifi c T cells stained with pp65-specifi c MHC-tetramer by more than 60%. Similarly, MSCs suppressed the frequency of activated CD8 positive T cells expressing CD137 and the secretion of cytokines like IFN-\u03b3 and granzyme B. In addition we confi rmed the modulatory eff ect of MSCs in MLR, as we observed inhibition of T cell proliferation. Conclusion: MSCs have strong immunosuppressive eff ects on alloreactive T cells and infusion of MSCs could be a promising immunotherapy for GVHD. However, MSCs can also inhibit CMV specifi c CD8 positive T cells. Therefore attention must be paid to early detection and pre-emptive treatment of CMV reactivation when patients are undergoing therapy with MSC. Acute GvHD (aGvHD) of the GI-tract is a severe complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Since an early treatment of aGvHD is essential a rapid diff erentiation between aGvHD and infections is necessary. For the fi rst time this study describes systematically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fi ndings in intestinal aGvHD. Methods: Prior to conditioning 46 consecutive patients planned for allogeneic SCT underwent as baseline investigation abdominal MRI on a whole-body 3T MR-scanner. The sequence protocol included axial and coronal T2 weighted sequences, an axial diffusion weighted sequence and a dynamic T1 weighted, contrast enhanced sequence. All patients with severe GI-tract symptoms or with signs of skin aGvHD received a second MRI immediately after onset of symptoms. In addition, all patients with severe GI tract symptoms received endoscopic examination of the upper GI-tract and colon. MRI fi ndings of patients with histologically proven intestinal aGvHD (GvHD group) were compared with the results from patients with isolated aGvHD of the skin or non-GvHD related GI-tract symptoms (control group). Results: 8 patients (GvHD group) suff ered from histologically proven intestinal aGvHD. In the control group 3 patients had isolated skin aGvHD, 1 patient had CMV colitis and 4 patients experienced diarrhea without specifi c diagnosis. In all GvHD group patients a unique MRI pattern was detected: Gut involvement presented as long-segment (>20cm) bowel wall thickening with submucosal edema. Mucosal wall was signifi cantly thickened in patients with intestinal aGvHD in comparison with control group patients as well as with baseline data (mean large bowel wall thickness: baseline 0.35mm, GvHD group 0.9mm, control group 0.36mm; mean small bowel wall thickness: baseline 0.38mm, GvHD group 0.79mm, control group 0.34mm). A mucosal diff usion restriction was seen in all GvHD group patients. The perfusion of the bowel spared the submucosa while demonstrating strong mucosal perfusion: In the T1 sequence 2 minutes after gadolinium injection a 2-fold enhancement was detectable in the bowel wall of the control group. In contrast, the mean enhancement was 2.8-fold in small bowel wall segments aff ected by aGvHD. Conclusions: In intestinal aGvHD a specifi c MR-appearance with long-segment aff ection of the bowel concomitant with marked bowel wall edema, restricted mucosal diff usion, mucosal hyperemia and ascites was detected. This unique MRI pattern might allow an early non-invasive diagnosis of intestinal aGvHD. The placenta protects the developing fetus from the mother's immune system. Fetal membranes have been used for almost a century to treat severe burn injuries, indicating that these tissues can promote wound healing. We have previously found that fetal membrane cells (FMCs) isolated from term placenta prevent alloreactivity in vitro. FMCs share many features with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which we previously introduced to treat severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we tested FMCs for treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD. After two passages in culture, approximately 10 9 FMCs were obtained from one single placenta, although not all cells from passage 0 and passage 1 were used for expansion. The FMCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD49d, ICAM-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2, but were negative for hematopoietic, endothelial, and epithelial markers. Microsatellite polymorphism analysis showed that FMCs were of maternal origin. All FMCs used showed normal karyotype. Nine patients who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and who had developed steroid-refractory grade III-IV acute GVHD were given 0.9-2.8 x 106 FMCs/kg at 15 infusions. Median age was 57 years. There was no toxicity from infusion of FMCs. Two of eight evaluable patients had a complete response and four had a partial response, giving an overall response rate of 75%. Two patients showed no response at all. Three patients are alive from 6 to 21 months after HSCT. One patient is well and two have chronic GVHD.",

            "text": "To conclude, we have developed a protocol for generation of large quantities of stromal cells with immunosuppressive capacities that are accessible without any invasive procedures. FMCs may be successfully used for immune modulation and tissue repair. It is now widely assumed that MSCs secrete a number of immunemodulatory factors, which impair infl ammation and thus help to suppress GvHD. Exosomes are secreted cell organelles, which exert immune-modulatory properties. These small membrane vesicles are released by a huge variety of diff erent cell species, including MSC. Methods: Here, we purifi ed exosomes from bone-marrow derived MSC of four diff erent unrelated stem cell donors and compared their immune modulatory properties in vitro. Next, we administered immunosuppressive MSC-derived exosomes in escalating doses into a 22-years female patient suff ering from a severe therapy-refractory cutaneous and intestinal GvHD grade IV. We monitored the clinical eff ects on an in-hospital basis and correlated this with the levels of infl ammatory cytokines measured in the patient's plasma. Results: We show that even though all propagated MSC lines released exosomes, exosome-enriched fractions diff ered in their potential to modulate immune responses in vitro. Administration of the exosome-enriched fraction with the strongest immune suppressive in vitro eff ect into the GvHD patient was well tolerated and appeared to be safe. During the course of the exosome therapy a clear reduction of the pro-infl ammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17 was observed in the patient's plasma. In line with the reduced anti-infl ammatory cytokine reaction, the clinical GvHD symptoms improved signifi cantly. The cutaneous and mucosal GvHD showed a remarkable response within two weeks which was stable even after 16 weeks following the MSC-exosome therapy ( Figure 1 ). The diarrhea volume, too, was objectively reduced after exosome therapy (before: average (avg.) 3,1 l/die, after: 1,3 S177 l/die, Figure 2 ). Due the clinical response achieved the dosage of the immunosuppressive agents -particularly of steroids -could be reduced signifi cantly (before: avg. 125 mg/d; after: 30 mg/d).",

This present study investigated the effi cacy of third party Treg from peripheral blood in preventing GvH tissue damage. Methods: Mixed lymphocyte reaction and an in vitro human GvHD skin explant model were used to assess the ability of third party Treg to modulate alloreactivity of CD8+ T cells and prevent cutaneous GvH tissue damage in comparison to the eff ect of Treg from donor origin i.e autologous to CD8+ T cells. Treg of third party or donor origin were identically processed using published isolation and expansion protocols. Results: Activation, proliferation and expression of skin homing markers on allo-stimulated CD8+ T cells were signifi cantly reduced in the presence of third party Treg. Activation of CD8+ T cells was measured by CD69 and CD25 expression and this was suppressed to the same extent by both allogeneic and autologous Treg. Expression of skin homing marker CLA was also reduced in the presence of autologous and allogeneic Treg with no significant diff erence between the two. CD8+ T cell proliferation was measured by 3H thymidine incorporation, both autologous and allogeneic Treg signifi cantly reduced allo-stimulated CD8 T cell proliferation. There was a trend to suggest autologous Treg prevented proliferation to a greater extent than allogeneic Treg however this was not statistically signifi cant. Secreted levels of IFN\u03b3, measured by CBA fl ex in MLR supernatants, were signifi cantly reduced by both autologous and allogeneic Treg. Skin sections of recipient origin incubated with recipient PBMC primed donor PBMC in the absence of any Treg showed grade III tissue damage whereas in the presence of either donor or third party Treg the damage was limited to grade I, the same as medium control. Conclusions: Our data suggests that third party Treg are able to suppress cutaneous GvH reactions to the same extent as donor Treg by preventing eff ector T cell proliferation and migration into the skin. It may be feasible to use third party Treg for GvHD immunotherapy when it is diffi cult to collect Treg and HSC from the same donor.",

Saccardi (1) Background: Cord Blood (CB) has been increasingly used in the last 10 years as an alternative source of haematopoietic stem cells for transplant. The incidence and severity of GVHD in HLApartially mismatched transplants has been reported to be lower than for adult donors. We report here the occurrence of skin GVHD showing atypical features at both clinical and histological level in adult recipients of unrelated CB transplants (CBT). Methods: Forty patients underwent CBT in our Institution from 12/2006 to 10/2012. Median age at HSCT was 43 yrs (range 16-66), M/F distribution was 21/19; HLA antigens matching was 4/6 (32) and 5/6 (8). A single Unit was used in 31 pts, a double in 9, with a median of of 3 TNCx10E7/Kg infused (range 1.7-6). Myeloablative/ non-myeloablative conditioning regimen ratio was 28/12. GVHD was classifi ed according to NIH guidelines. Skin biopsies were collected in case of any rush of undetermined signifi cance, fi xed in formalin, processed and stained with haematoxylin/eosin. Results: Twenty-one patients developed a GVHD at a median of 73 days after CBT (9-333). GVHD forms at onset of fi rst occurrence were acute (12), acute late onset (4), overlap (3) and chronic (2) . A second occurrence of GVHD was shown in 6 patients and a third in one, respectively, with a total of 33 GVHD episodes. In 10 episodes (30.3%) an atypical rush with erythematous-squamous patches suggestive of an eczema-like or atopic dermatitis was shown. Such an abnormal feature occurred in acute late onset (6) , chronic (2), acute (1) and overlapping (1) GVHD forms, respectively. Four out these 21 patients (2 typical and 2 atypical) died for GVHD-related reasons. In all these cases, histopathology revealed epidermal hyperplasia, spongiosis and a dermal mixed infl ammatory infi ltrate with lymphocytes and eosinophils, in some cases associated with folliculitis. There was no evidence of the typical apoptotic or fi brotic tissue damage commonly associated to GVHD, therefore confi rming the clinical evidence. Conclusions: Improving diagnosis and treatment of GHVD in CB recipients is crucial for the outcome of this increasingly used procedure. We report unusual eczema-like eruptions in CB recipients.",

Secondary end points were: median day of engraftment, chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse, overall and progression free survival (OS & PFS) using Kaplan-Meier. Results: Between January 2011 and June of 2012, 21 patients (pts) were enrolled. The Median follow-up time is 13.3 months (95% CI 6.8 -19.0 months). All pts received peripheral blood stem cells from HLA 8/8 matched sibling donor, and daily G-CSF starting day +6 till engraftment .Patient characteristics are described in Table 1 .

Introduction: In reduced intensity cord blood transplantation (CBT) post transplant immune disorders, including early immune reactions (PIR) and acute GVHD, are potential complications following CBT in adult patients. Such reactions might increase the risk of organ dysfunction, leading to high rates of transplantationrelated mortality, particularly in patients who do not respond to primary therapy, which usually consists of steroids. Infl iximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, has shown activity against steroid refractory acute GVHD. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 275 patients who underwent single-unit reduced intensity cord blood transplantation consecutively from November 2007 to June 2011 at Toranomon Hospital. Patients who were in poor performance status (ECOG PS >3), had active bacterial or fungal infections at the time of conditioning were excluded. The most frequently used conditioning regimens were fl udarabine, alkylating agent (melphalan or busulfan) with total body irradination (TBI), tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. Patients in whom acute GVHD developed received methylpredonisolone 1-2 mg/kg per day. If no partial or complete resolution of symptoms occurred, they were considered steroid-refractory and proceeded to infl iximab treatment. The dose of infl iximab was 5 mg/kg/day once weekly for at least 1 course. Results: 54 patients among this group developed steroid refractory acute GVHD. Of these, 21 who received infl iximab were analyzed. GVHD prophylaxis was with only tacrolimus(n=15) and mycophenolate mofetil+tacrolimus(n=6). All of them developed grade III to IV GVHD. Median follow-up time of survivors was 548 days (range, 222-1152). The overall response rate was 62% (n=13), and 9 patients (43%) experienced complete response (CR). 5 patients (24%) did not respond and 3 (14%) had progressive GVHD. Overall survival (OS) was estimated as 31% at 2years post-treatment. Four patients who responded subsequently died, one of exacerbation of GVHD, three of infections. All the 8 unresponsive patients died of GVHD. Five patients (21%) had non-Candida invasive fungal infections. Sixteen patients(79%) had bacterial infections. Conclusion: Infl iximab was well tolerated and active for the treatment of steroid-resistant acute GVHD even following re-duced intensity cord blood transplantation. However, it is associated with a high rate of infections.",

Results: We report the analysis of 19 pts with acute leukemia (58%), 5 pts with chronic leukemia (15%), 4 pts with MDS (12%) and 5 pts with advanced NHL (15%). The median age at transplant was 50.5 (range, 18-69) years. In this cohort 12 pts received grafts from HLA-identical siblings (36%), 16 pts from matched (49%) and 5 pts from mismatched (15%) unrelated donors. Transplantat consisted of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells (n=26, 79%) or bone marrow (n=7, 21%). Of all pts, 7 (21%) had relapsed after transplant. Among these pts, 31 (94%) developed acute GVHD (21 pts had an acute GvHD of grade \u2265 2). There was no signifi cant correlation between CEACAMs expression after transplant between the variant leukemic disorders in the whole blood and the urine samples. Analysis of each CEACAMs for relapse showed no statistically diff erences. For CEACAM-6, we found a moderate up-regulation in pts with acute GvHD \u2265 2 versus acute GvHD <2 (p<0.1). In pts with severe acute GVHD (grade >3) comparing all other pts, we found signifi cant induction of CEACAM-1 (118.5 ng/ml vs. 198.3 ng/ml, p<0.05) in urine samples and CEACAM-1 (109.2 vs. 157.5 ng/ml, p<0.04) in serum samples. However, no statistic diff erences were found in the CEACAM-1 in regards to chronic GVHD. Conclusions: These results suggest that pts with high levels of CEACAM-1 confi rms a relevant association of the development of acute GVHD and CEACAM profi ling could be an early indicator of severe acute GvHD. Steroid refractory graft versus host disease (GVHD), is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation(ASCT). The role of mesanchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) has been demonstrated in the treatment of steroid refractory acute GVHD. The effi cacy of MSCT in chronic GVHD has been reported in a limited number studies including only few number of patients.We aimed to revise our MSCT results and evaluate its feasibilty and effi cacy.

            "text": "Most of the studies with MSCT has been performed in patients with steroid refractory acute GVHD. Although our patient numbers were low, our results were comparable with the response rates in the previous studies. MSCT seems to be a feasible option for steroid refractory chronic GVHD. Introduction: Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Patient and methods: A total of 100 patients who underwent AHCST in University of Erciyes, Faculty of Medicine, Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit were investigated, retrospectively. All transplantation procedures were performed from fullmatch donor and Seattle regimen was used for GvHD prevention. The frequency of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and factors related with development of aGvHD including recipient age, donor age, recipient gender, donor gender, recipient-donor gender match, blood group compatibility, amount of CD34+ given and conditioning regimen were investigated. Results: The diagnosis of the patients were as follows: acute leukemia in 67 patients (%69,1), aplastic anemia in 7(%7,2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 6(%6,2), other diseases in 17(%17,5) (Hodgkin lyphoma, myelofi brosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). 36 of patients were female (%36) and 64 patients were male (%64). 57 (%58,8) of patients were given non containing total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimen, 40(%41,2) of patients were given total body irradiation (TBI). The median age of 100 patients was found 33,3 years (\u00b111,04). The frequency of aGvHD was %23,7 (23 patient We have recently shown in a single centre prospective study that that in vivo low-dose alemtuzumab (\u2264 20 mg total dose) during conditioning combined with only CsA post-transplant may efficiently prevent severe acute and chronic GVHD after sibling and matched unrelated PBSCT for acute leukemia (BMT 2011; 46: 1363 -1368 . In contrast, a multicenter de-escalation prospective British study (Blood 2010; 116: 3080-3088) in patients with various diagnoses suggested that the minimum dose of alemtuzumab in sibling HCT for effi cient GvHD prophylaxis should be 30mg. Probably this conclusion does not apply to patients with acute leukemia, as all patients in the British study who experienced II-IV acute GvHD in the 20mg alemtuzumab dose had a CD52-expressing tumor at the time of transplantation. Here, we update our experience of low dose alemtuzumab as GvHD prophylaxis in 60 consecutive patients (pts). Thirty-two pts were transplanted for AML, 20 for ALL, 2 with biphenotypic leukemia, 1 with untreated MDS RAEB-2, 1 with blast crisis CML (T315I+ mutation), 2 with AA, 1 with PNH and 1 with NHL. 73% of the pts had high risk diseases. Twenty-six patients were transplanted from sibling donors (43%), 33 patients from VUD (55%) and 1 patient from a matched related donor (2%). All pts but 2 received peripheral blood stem cells. The fi rst 10 pts received a total dose of 20 mg alemtuzumab pre-transplant, the next 6 pts a total dose of 15 mg and thereafter 39 pts received a total dose of 10 mg. Overall, 18 (32%) out of 57 evaluable pts developed acute GvHD I-IV. Severe acute GvHD (grade III-IV) was observed in 5 pts (9%) after a median of 32 days (range, 13-95). All pts, but two responded to corticosteroid therapy (88%). There was no signifi cant diff erence in the aGvHD incidence between sibling and VUD pts. Chronic GvHD was observed in 14 (26%) pts at median on day 159 (120-318). cGVHD was limited in 12/14 pts cGvHD, extensive in 2/14pts, mild in 3/14, moderate in 9/14 and severe in 2/14 pts. Only 2 pts are still receiving immunosuppresion for cGvHD. After a median follow up of 529 days (range 4-1826), 38 out of 60 pts are alive (63%), and 22 (37%) died (TRM n=12, Relapse n=10). The estimated 1-and 2-year OS probability for all pts is 79% \u00b15.3% and 62% \u00b1 6.9%, respectively. In conclusion, in vivo low dose Campath (\u2264 20 mg total dose) confers an effi cient GvHD prophylaxis in patients with acute leukemia.",

            "text": "Though adoptive therapy with viral specifi c T-cells has proven safe and eff ective for both prevention and treatment of post-transplant viral reactivation, improved strategies are still needed to increase the general applicability of this approach. We tested a simplifi ed rapid strategy of the generation of a single product of CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) lines recognizing cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr-(EBV), Adeno-(Ad) and BK-virus. Dendritic cells derived from elutriated monocytes were pulsed with overlapping 15mer pepmixes spanning CMV-pp65 and IE-1; EBV-LMP2, BZLF1 and EBNA1; Adv-Penton, Hexon; BKV-LT, ST and VP1 alone or in combination (Mix) and subsequently were co-cultured with autologous lymphocytes obtained from the initial elutriation in presence of IL-7, IL-15, and low dose IL-2. For detection of antigen specifi c CTLs, cells were stimulated with test pepmix or control superantigen in the presence of Brefeldin A, anti-CD28 and CD49d, washed, stained for T-cell subset markers and then permeabilized and intracellular-stained for IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-2, CD107a. Quadrivirus-specifi c IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ and CD8+ CTLs were successfully induced in all 12 donors (CD4+ 5.8\u00b16.8%, CD8+ 7.3\u00b17.9%). Induction of reactivity in cultures containing individual pepmixes was comparable with results from the cultures containing combination of all studied peptide libraries, supporting the feasibility of developing of a quadrivirus-specifi c product in a single mixed culture. Two rounds of expansion resulted in signifi cant increase in frequency of CD8+ antigen-specifi c cells, while there was no change in reactivity of CD4+ cells. The predominant specifi city was against CMV in CMV-seropositive donors (n=6; CD3+:8.7\u00b18%, CD4+:3.6\u00b15.9%, CD8+:5.1\u00b13.6%). Signifi cant CMV-reactivity of CTLs was also induced in CMV-seronegative donors (n=6; CD3+:1.6\u00b11%, CD4+:1.2\u00b10.7%, CD8+:0.4\u00b10.3%). The expanded T cells retained predominantly na\u00efve or central memory phenotype and only a small subset demonstrated undesirable markers of terminal diff erentiation or senescence. Furthermore, the anti-viral cells were polyfunctional, as evidenced by simultaneous production with IFNg of TNF-\u03b1 and (to a lesser degree) IL-2. In conclusion, we demonstrate a simple, rapid (9 days) GMPcompatible methodology to generate a single preparation of polyclonal CTLs specifi c for four viruses that are frequent causes of post-transplant mortality or morbidity. A 28 year old patient presented with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase at our unit. The patient was 9 weeks pregnant and this posed several treatment problems, the most challenging being that the use of chemotherapeutic agents could cause signifi cant damage to the unborn fetus. At presentation full blood count results showed WBC 213x10 9 /L, Hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL and platelets 907x10 9 /L. A clinical decision was made to manage the patient with leucopheresis twice a week and daily aspirin during the fi rst trimester of her pregnancy. The leucodepletion procedures were performed using the Spectra Optia\u2122 Apheresis System with the recently released WBC Depletion protocol.",

Over the course of treatment, the platelet count reduced from 927x10 9 / L to 449x10 9 /L and the average platelet depletion was 30.2%. Non-desired cellular loss was acceptable and relatively constant in each procedure with an average red blood cell loss to the product of 2.8%.

Objective: Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) can be achieved either by the combination of chemotherapy plus growth factors or by the growth factors alone. However there is no consensus concerning the dose of growth factor alone that should be administered, with ranges varying from 5 \u03bcg to 16 \u03bcg / kg body weight. In this context, we report our experience in mobilization of HSCs, using growth factor alone at the dose of 15 \u03bcg /kg in MM, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients and methods: A total of 122 ASCT were performed in our center, from May 2009 to July 31st 2012. This concerned 88 patients with MM, 30 with HL and 4 others with NHL. Mobilization started with G-CSF alone (fi lgrastim) at the dose of 15\u03bcg/kg/daily subcutaneously for 5 days. Apheresis was performed at day-2 and day-1 using a device type Spectra Optia CMN, and the CD34+ count was assessed by fl ow cytometry. Failure of mobilization was defi ned as a level of CD34+ lower than 2.106/kg, after two leukapheresis. In our study, patients were divided into three groups: optimal (>5.0 \u00d7 106 CD34+cells/kg), suboptimal (2.0-5.0 \u00d7 106 CD34+cells/kg) and poor (<2.0 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg) mobilization groups. Results: The average number of apheresis was 1 and that of CD34+ was 3.48x106/kg in MM and 3.60x106/kg in HL and NHL. Failure of mobilization represented 6 cases (5%) of the 122 ASCT done.The most adverse events were, bone pain and headache were reported for 49% and 25% patients, respectively, fever in 25% and asthenia in 18%.Conclusion:Our study show an overall success rate of 96% over a total of 163 leukapheresis done. The use of growth factor alone at a dose of 15\u03bcg/kg/day allows a high level of CD34 + cells with suboptimal stem cell collection (75%) and a very low failure rate (5%) without severely adverse events and very acceptable results of engrafment.",

            "text": "Objectives: Determination of the number of viable CD34+ cells is important for clinical decision-making in stem cell transplantation. Flow Cytometry (FCM) is standardly used for enumeration of hematopoietic stem cell levels in bone marrow, cord blood, peripheral blood, and apheresis products. As the dead cells and debris can disturb the correct interpretation of the FCM results, the apoptotic cells should also be excluded from the viable cell determination. A cell membrane permeability marker, 7-Aminoactinomycine D (7-AAD), is currently used as a standard DNA intercalating dye to determine the amount of dead and early apoptotic stem cells by FCM. However, these cells are more diffi cult to identify due to the low intensity of 7-AAD in them. Furthermore, 7-AAD can nonspecifi cally bind to cells and increase as such the number of non-viable cells. DRAQ7 (Biostatus, Shepshed, UK) is a novel more intense staining viability probe fl uorescing in the farred that does not enter intact cells but when the membrane integrity is compromised, it enters and binds readily to nuclear DNA to report cell death, reducing the potential for false-positives. Methods: DRAQ7 and 7-AAD were both tested in the ISHAGE protocol with and without Syto16 (an inert probe which does not interfere with cell viability) to provide detailed characterization and tracking of cell death. Fresh and cryopreserved Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC) from Apheresis (HPC-A) were analysed on a Beckman Coulter Navios fl ow cytometer using CD34 and CD45 monoclonal antibodies. The number and the pattern of viable, apoptotic and dead stem cells staining defi ned by both dyes were compared. Results: Our results show a better staining of apoptotic stem cells by DRAQ7. Furthermore, we found signifi cant more (2.2 fold higher, P<0.05, n=6) dead Syto16low/-/7-AAD+ stem cells with a median frequency of 28% (range 2-37%) than dead Syto16low/-/DRAQ7+ stem cells with a median frequency of 13% (range 1-15%). Conclusion: The preliminary data demonstrate that 7-AAD causes more apoptosis compared with DRAQ7 in the same stem cell samples. These results suggest that DRAQ7 is a more suitable viability dye to determine the correct amount of existing dead and apoptotic stem cells and therefore should be incorporated in FCM research and clinical protocols, especially in the CD34+ stem cell enumeration assay.",

Resnick Hadassah University Medical Center (Jerusalem, IL) Background: Bone marrow (BM) derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) have a growing number of indications for clinical use. BM donation is problematic for a non-conventional treatment, and as such the possibility to use a side product of BM harvesting -used bone marrow fi lters was re-evaluated. According to current knowledge, there is a single publication which characterized BM fi lters as a poor source of hMSC for clinical use [Sundin et al., 2008] . Materials and methods:Six fi lters for MSC expansion were used. Filters from BM harvesting sets were collected from operating room in sterile normal saline. Cells from fi lters were counted, re-suspended in specifi c medium for MSC (DMEM Low Glucose with 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin-Nystatin and 1% Glutamine), then seeded in 75 cm2 fl ask (8*10 6 cells per fl ask in total volume of 20ml). The medium was changed twice weekly until confl uency. Cultures were washed with phosphate buff ered saline and then trypsinized, washed again and resuspended for a fi rst passage in 182 cm2 fl asks (1.5*10 6 cells per fl ask in a total volume of 35 ml). Results: From each fi lter 80*10 6 to 150*10 6 MSC were received in total after one passage. During simultaneous MSC expansion from the same BM samples (n=2), fi lters showed similar or superior kinetics growing velocity ( Figure) . Immunophenotype from both fi lters and bone marrow derived hMSC was similar (CD90+CD73+HLA-ABC+CD105+ and CD45-CD3-HLA-DR-). There were no cases of microbial contamination.

Jamal (1) Objective: Processing of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) for clinical transplantation or research applications aims to effectively select or deplete specific cell populations. Usually, fluorescence-or magnetically-based sorting techniques are used for PBPC processing. Here, we investigated the performance of a novel microchip-based \u00b4acoustophoresis\u00b4 technique, utilizing ultrasound for the separation of lymphocyte subsets from PBPC. By applying an acoustic standing wave field on to a continuously flowing cell suspension in a micro channel, cells can be separated depending on their physical properties, such as size and density. Methods: PBPC samples were obtained from patients (n= 16) and healthy donors (n=6). Following density gradient centrifugation, cells were labelled with either anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 microbeads (Dynal) and sorted on an acoustophoresis-microchip. In parallel, control magnetic sorting was performed. PBPC samples, target and waste fractions were analysed for separation effi ciency, recovery, T-cell function and progenitor cell content. Results: The mean separation efficiency of CD4+ lymphocytes to the target fraction was 87 \u00b1 7% with acoustophoresis compared to 95 \u00b1 8% for control magnetic sorting (n=19). Viability of sorted cells was 95 \u00b1 4% (acoustic) and 97 \u00b1 3% (magnetic). Following further technical improvement of the chip, purities obtained with acoustic sorting of CD8+ lymphocytes were 96 \u00b1 3% compared to 93 \u00b1 4% for magnetic sorting (n=3). The median recovery of acoustically selected lymphocytes was the 57%. Leukocyte subpopulation analysis performed after CD4 selection showed a relative increase of CD8, CD19, CD34, CD56, CD14 cells in the nontarget fractions. These changes were due to the removal of CD4 cells and found to be within the expected range. Functional testing of sorted CD4+ cells showed unimpaired mitogen-induced proliferation capacity as well as cytokine production. Results from hematopoietic progenitor cell assays indicated a preserved colony-forming ability post-sorting of non-target cells.",

Haematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (HSCT). The graft is usually thawed bedside and shortly reinfused without any manipulation. Infusion-related toxicity is usually mild, although severe reactions have been reported. Washing the product after thawing would allow an easier management of the infusion and of the logistics, due to the prolonged stabilization of the graft. We report here the validation of a fully automated washing method through an international, prospective, multicenter trial. Methods: Forty-three patients undergoing autologous HSCT according to local protocol were enrolled in 4 European Centers (Florence, Murcia, Marseille and Basel), following a pre-clinical study aimed to validate the procedure. PBSC were thawed and washed before infusion with the SmartWash\u2122 program on Sepax2\u00ae (Biosafe, Switzerland). Standard lab parameters were collected before and after washing. Clinical outcome was prospectively assessed by infusion-related adverse events scoring and engraftment parameter. Results: All the washing procedures were completed without any laboratory problems in the participating centers. The additional active manpower, as compared to the unmanipulated infusion, was around 12 mins/bag. After washing, the mean (SD) recovery of viable CD34+ cells was 73.9% (21,8) with reference to the frozen product. In no cases any loss of viable CD34+ cells was reported during the washing procedure. Inter-laboratory variability showed no statistical difference in CD34+ recovery even though cellular composition of the apheresis was heterogeneous.The infusion-related toxicity was negligible (1 grade 1 out of 43 patients, according to CTC-NCI scoring system) and all patients achieved a sustained engraftment: median day of recovery of neutrophils >500x10 9 /L and platelets >20x10 12 /L was: 9 (12-18) and 12 (7-30), respectively. No significant differences in engraftment kinetic were shown across the participating centers.",

This extrapolation raised questions in the EBMT on the effi cacy and safety of biosimilar G-CSF for stem cell mobilization. In a recent review by Shaw EB et al.

            "text": "Multiple myeloma patients mobilizing poorly with G-CSF achieve a signifi cantly higher haematopoietic stem cell harvest with additional administration of plerixafor Introduction: About 10% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients are considered to be \"poor mobilizers\" with a CD34+ cell count \u2264 20/ \u03bcl in the peripheral blood after chemotherapy and stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Addition of the CXCR-4 inhibitor plerixafor (Mozobil\u00ae) might increase the efficiency of CD34+ stem cell harvest with even fewer leukapheresis procedures needed. Here we retrospectively analyzed data from multiple myeloma (MM) patients at our institution to evaluate the eff ect of plerixafor in this setting. Methods: Twenty-two MM patients were mobilized with or without chemomobilization and G-CSF. Patients received plerixafor after fi rst or second mobilization due to low CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood (PB) or poor yield of collection. A median amount of 6.60 (3.33-11.54) \u03bcg/kg BW G-CSF and 0.25 (0.16-0.41) mg/kg BW plerixafor was applied. One to four leukapheresis procedures were performed. Results: Patients were categorized into two groups according to their CD34+ stem cell count in PB : group A \u2264 20/\u03bcl and group B >20/\u03bcl. Group A harvested 3.84 (0.29-9.43)\u00d710E6/kg BW CD34+ cells, group B 8.18 (5.5-14.34 -4) . A minimum cell yield \u2265 2x10E6 CD34+cells/kg BW was harvested in 11/12 patients in group A and 10/10 patients in group B. Conclusion: Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells with additional plerixafor was well tolerated. The median hematopoietic stem cell harvest in group A (\u2264 20 CD34+ cells/\u03bcl PB) was signifi cantly higher after additional mobilization with plerixafor. Our results provide safety and effi cacy data for the use of plerixafor in patients who are considered to be poor mobilizers. As several previous studies demonstrated that in poor mobilizers a suffi cient stem cell number cannot be harvested, the use of plerixafor should be upfront considered in this subgroup of patients. Even in patients with a CD34+ cell count > 20/\u03bcl in PB (group B), addition of plerixafor signifi cantly increased the consecutive stem cell harvest. Fewer leukapheresis procedures were needed with plerixafor to reach the requested amount of stem cells. HLA-haploidentical stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be complicated by high rates of graft failure and severe GVHD due to strong bidirectional alloreactivity. High-dose Cy, when administered in a narrow window after HSCT has been shown to attenuate GVHD and facilitate engraftment by eliminating alloreactive T cells while sparing quiescent hematopoietic stem cells, far more resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Aim of the study: to evaluate safety and effi cacy of post-transplant Cy after T cell-replete marrow HLA-haploidentical HSCT for advanced hematological malignancies. Methods: between April 2010 and August 2012, 25 patients with hematologic malignancies (n=21 AML/MDS; n=2 LMC; n=2 lymphomas) have been enrolled, the majority (60%) of whom were in advanced phase of disease (n=13 relapse/refractory; n=2 accelerated phase/blast crisis) at the time of transplant. Seven patients had received a previous allogeneic HSCT. Thirteen patients received a tandem approach consisting of de-bulking high dose chemotherapy followed by the conditioning regimen and HLA-haploidentical marrow infusion. Patients received either a reduced-intensity conditioning including fl udarabine-Cy and single dose 200 cGy TBI (9 patients), or a myeloablative regimen consisting of thiotepa-fl udarabine and i.v. busulphan (15 patients) or thiotepa-fl udarabine-melphalan (1 patient), followed by T-cell replete bone marrow. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of Cy 50 mg/Kg/day on days +3 and +4, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. All patients received G-CSF after transplantation Results: neutrophil engraftment occurred in 23 of 24 evaluable patients at a median of 18 days (range 14-24 days). The incidences of grades II-IV and grades III-IV acute GVHD were 26% and 4% respectively. Bacteremia occurred in 8 patients, 13 patients developed viral infections (n=12 CMV reactivation, n=1 EBV reactivation). After a median follow-up of 264 days (range 124-936 days), 14 patients (56%) are alive, 9 of whom are in complete remission.",

            "text": "Results: For MM patients, steady state mobilisation (cytokines only) or chemotherapy-based regimens according to national guidelines are recommended. For lymphoma patients, diseasespecifi c chemotherapy approaches are suggested to avoid the burden of additional chemotherapy cycles. For selected lymphoma patients who are in complete remission and/or are ineligible for chemo-mobilisation, steady state mobilisation may also be an option. To optimise steady state or chemo-mobilisation protocols and increase graft yields, the addition of new mobilisation agents such as plerixafor are suggested. Over the past years several factors have been described in the literature to be predictive of poor PBSC collection, including older age, more advanced disease stage, higher no. of prior treatment lines, prior treatment with fl udarabine or melphalan, and prior irradiation. However, the most robust predictor for poor PBSC collection is presumably the CD34+ cell count in PB before apheresis. For patients with <10 CD34+ cells/microlitre in PB prior to apheresis, preemptive plerixafor use is suggested to reach a target apheresis count of 2.0 Mio CD34+ cells/kg. For patients with 10-20 CD34+ cells/microlitre in PB prior to apheresis, a dynamic approach is recommended taking into account patients' disease characteristics and treatment history. Readily available and robust techniques to determine CD34+ cell counts are needed. Conclusions: PBSC mobilisation can presumably be optimised by choosing an appropriate strategy adapted to each patient, based on disease and treatment features. A low CD34+ cell count in PB prior to apheresis is a candidate predictor for poor PBSC collection. Thus, CD34+ cell count determination might estimate the patient's risk for poor PBSC collection and allows a proactive intervention to rescue mobilisation failure.",

Although the exact mechanism of G-CSF's mobilising eff ect is debated, down-regulation of the chemokine CXCL12 may be involved. For most patients a satisfactory cell dose can be harvested: however, about 15% of patients mobilise PBSC poorly which has signifi cant implications for their long term management. Recent published data examining a small group of autograft patients suggested that elevated serum glucose concentrations impair stem cell mobilisation via a defect in activation of the sympathetic nervous system which causes a blockade of G-CSF induced down-regulation of CXCL12(1). This was indicated by a low CD34 count at time of harvest and delayed engraftment post transplant. We extended this investigation by examining autograft patients referred for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest in the West of Scotland between 2009 and 2012.

However, the small number of diabetic patients may indicate a diffi culty in identifying a diff erence in this data set. Other potential confounding factors include the age and sex of patients which were at variance between the two groups [median age 61yrs vs 56yrs, p=0.0045 and male sex n=12 (93.3%) and n=130 (52.2%)] in the diabetic and non-diabetic cohort respectively. However, as increasing age generally has a small negative eff ect on PBSC mobilisation, the higher mean age of the diabetic cohort would be expected to enhance, rather than to mask, any impact of diabetes on mobilisation. There is confl icting data on whether gender aff ects mobilisation, but if so then the eff ect is very modest. These data do not indicate that the existence of diabetes per se signifi cantly infl uences PBSC harvesting and would suggest that other factors play a more important role in accounting for the success of stem cell mobilisation. SCU remain stored and unused at last F-U (Fig.1) . Among 274 patients who never reinfused cryopreserved SCU, disposal was performed in 62(22%); causes of disposal were death in 54 and allogeneic transplantation in 8; 4 SCU were eliminated, due to technical reasons. Kinetics of the 1st reinfusion shows that 99% of the SCU has been used within 24 months; only one patient received the 1st ASCT 6 years after the collection. There was a signifi cant diff erence in the SCU kinetics of reinfusion, according to the underlying disease: for AL patients the chance of being reinfused 12 months after SCU collection was almost null, while it was not negligible for MM or NHL patients (Fig.2) . A multivariate logistic regression was performed considering the outcome variable of non-reinfusion. The analysis, center-adjusted, confi rmed that probability of non-use was signifi cantly increased in patients with AL, collections with less than 2x10e6 CD34/kg and in lower age groups.

Dykes (1) Background: Rigorous depletion of TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells whilst preserving valuable TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells in the stem cell graft is an attractive alternative to CD3+ T-cell depletion for prevention of GvHD in HLA-mismatched transplantation. In the current study, we investigated the performance of the novel CliniMACS TcR\u03b1/\u03b2 product line for depletion of peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) products intended for haploidentical transplantation. Study design and methods: PBPC were harvested from 8 HLAhaploidentical donors. The cells were sequentially labelled with TcR\u03b1/\u03b2-Biotin reagent and CliniMACS anti-Biotin reagent and processed with the CliniMACS device using the D3.1 program (n=8) with the DTS (Depletion Tubing Set). TcR\u03b1/\u03b2 -cell depleted grafts were produced with a target cell dose of \u2265 5 \u00d7 106 CD34+ and \u2264 1 \u00d7 105 TcR\u03b1/\u03b2 + cells per kilogram of recipient body weight. In fl ow cytometric analysis viable TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells were defi ned by their cell scatter properties of lymphocytes, positivity for CD45 (bright), CD3 and TcR\u03b1/\u03b2 and negativity for propidium iodine staining, as well as lack of CD13-, CD19-, CD14-and TcR\u03b1/\u03b2-expression. Bright fl uorescent dyes were selected for TcR\u03b1/\u03b2 (PE) and CD3 (APC) staining. The fl ow cytometric dot plot of a \"spiked\" sample (10:1 mixture of depleted target fraction: non-target TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells) was used to adequately set the gate for TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cell detection. A minimum of 106 events were acquired for analysis. Results: The median log10 TcR\u03b1/\u03b2-cell depletion rate was 4.6 (range 3.0-5.0), corresponding to a median of 0.0017 % (range 0.00041-0.036%) TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells in the target fractions. The median recovery of CD34+ cells was 94% (range 85-99%) and the median recovery of TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells was 79% (range 72-95% Introduction: Immunomagnetic depletion of TCR \u03b1/\u03b2 (TCRab) positive cells from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) graft is a new method of graft processing, which removes potential eff ectors of graft-versus-host disease, sparing presumably important populations, such as NK cells and \u03b3/\u03b4 T-cells. This method was adopted as a basic graft processing platform for haploidentical (haplo) and matched unrelated donors (MUD) in our center since May 2012. We report herein the technical results of the procedure. Methods: Overall 34 procedures were performed between May and November 2012. Grafts were GCSF-mobilized PBSCs derived from MUD (n=23) and haplo (n=11) donors. Initial characteristics of the graft were similar with median total nucleated cell (TNC) count = 57x109, CD34 = 416x106, TCRab = 13,9x109, CD19 = 3,5x109. The only diff erence was in the time period from apheresis to processing start, which was a median of 48 and 22 hours for MUD and haplo, respectively. The procedure of TCRab and CD19 depletion was performed with appropriate reagents and Clini-MACS Plus instrument, Miltenyi Biotec, according to manufacturer's instructions. Magnetic reagent volumes were adjusted to TNC and labeled cell count. Product analysis was performed on FACS CANTO II cytometer, BD according to Miltenyi Biotec protocol. Results: Median recovery of CD34 cells was 93% and 90% for MUD and haplo. Median log depletion of TCRab cells was 3,9(2,9-4,7) and 3,9(3,3-5) (fi g 1.). Median log depletion of CD19 cells was 2,9(1,8-3,9 ) and 3,1 (2, 7) , respectively. The only factor that signifi cantly correlated with depletion eff ectiveness was the ratio of magnetic reagent TNC capacity to the real TNC count (fi g. 2). Conclusions: TCR \u03b1/\u03b2 and CD19 depletion with CliniMACS technology is a robust and eff ective method of graft processing for HSC transplantation. The method secures target graft quality independent of the graft source, transportation and processing delay up to 48 hours. An excess of the immunomagnetic reagent correlates with greater depletion of the labeled cells.",

Peschel, A. Krackhardt Technical University Munich (Munich, DE) Infusion of donor lymphocytes off ers a salvage option for selected patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We have previously developed a simple method for cryopreservation of peripheral blood stem cells within a functionally closed system that fulfi ls GMP guidelines and allows for processing without a cleanroom facility. The actual objective comprises the modifi cation of our system for processing, portioning and cryopreservation of donor lymphocytes. At our clinic, patients usually receive subsequently 1x10 6 , 5x10 6 , 10x10 6 and 50x10 6 donor lymphocytes per kg bodyweight (BW). The fi rst donation is removed directly from the apheresis product. For subsequent donations, the cell number is fi rst adjusted within a transfer bag to 50x10 6 /kg BW in a volume of 95ml and transferred to a cryobag of the fi rst Cell Cryo Freeze Prep Set (CCFPS). After disconnection, the transfer bag is connected to a plasma collection bag containing 150ml of donor plasma. 40 ml of the undiluted cell suspension are transferred to the plasma collection bag resulting in a dilution of 1:5 after fi nal preparation. Therefore, the plasma collection bag was connected to a second CCFPS followed by addition of DMSO (5ml per bag) and distribution to two cryobags. Similarly, DMSO was added to the cryobag of the fi rst CCFPS and all cryobags were crypreserved followed by long-term storage below -140\u00b0C. Numbers of CD3/CD45 cells were analyzed after each preparation step by fl ow cytometry. A total of 6 processes have been completed. The mean content of the donations were 2.4 CD3/CD45 cells/kg BW for the fi rst donation, and 13.5, 13.7 and 52.5 for the following donations. The standard deviation was 0.57, 4.85, 3.83 and 5.82, respectively. The cell number applied to the patient will be adjusted according to the exact number of lymphocytes measured after preparation and the medical need. Vitality of nucleated cells after cryopreservation was >90% (trypan blue staining). Sterility was analyzed for both CCFPS preparations revealing no contamination in all processes performed. These data demonstrate that cryopreservation of donor lymphocytes in a closed bag system is feasible and off ers superior advantages: The process is simple, safe and cost-saving and the dosage of CD3+/CD45+ cells to be infused to the patient can be individually adjusted by the clinician according to the eff ectively measured number of cells within the cryobag after preparation and the specifi c condition of the patient. .2 ): patient's death (47%), microbial contamination (22%), structural damage to the bags (16%); insuffi cient amount of CD34+ content (5%) and mistakes/damages in the labels (1,5%). Among the 36 interviewed centers only 9 reported the use of a specifi c consensus for disposal of the bags and 17 had a specifi c policy for the discharge. The results of this preliminary survey suggested that in Italy the amount of the unemployed SCU is relevant, particularly as regards the SCU stored > 10 years. This situation raises serious concerns about: 1-the increasing limitations of the room space available for SCU cryopreservation in the next future; 2-the increasing costs of long term cryopreservation of SCU, with low chance to be reinfused for ASCT; 3-ethicality of destroying autologous SCU stored, based on the loss of ASCT indication (if it has never been performed) or to keep the chance of a successive ASCT (for those patients keeping exceeding SCU, after the 1st ASCT). Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilisation in peripheral blood (PB) is prerequisite for successful collection in apheresis procedure S190 and subsequent autologous HSC transplantation. The number of CD34+ cells in PB prior to apheresis is one of the most important predictors of successful HSC collection. In case of low CD34+ numbers apheresis can be prolonged with more blood volumes (BV) processed to improve yield due to additional recruitment of CD34+ cells from bone marrow (BM). Also, administration of CXCR-4 antagonist plerixafor in poor mobilisers leads to increase in PB CD34+ numbers due to shift from BM to PB. In order to evaluate role of CD34+ recruitment in patients mobilised with plerixafor in comparison to non-plerixafor mobilisations in standard volume (SV) and large volume (LV) In conclusion, the eff ect of CD34+ recruitment was less pronounced in plerixafor group. This may be due to prior redistribution of CD34+ cells from BM to PB. However it is still signifi cantly higher in LV apheresis group suggesting that LV apheresis can additionally improve yield in poor mobilizer subgroup of patients after addition of plerixafor. Feto-maternal microchimerism suggests immunological tolerance between mother and fetus. Thus, we performed primary hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) from mismatched mother to thalassemic patient without an HLA-identical donor. 42 patients with thalassemia major were conditioned with 60 mg/kg hydroxyurea and 3 mg/kg azathioprine from day -59 to -11, 30 mg/ m2 fl udarabine from day -17 to -11, 14 mg/kg busulfan starting on day -10 were administered orally 3 times daily over 4 days in the fi rst 17 patients, and corresponding dose of busulfan give intravenous in the following 25 patients, and 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide,10 mg/kg Thiotepa, and 10 mg/kg ATG (Fresenius) daily from day -5 to -2. 34 patients received CD34+ mobilized peripheral and bone marrow progenitor cells; 8 patients received marrow graft selected PBSC CD34+ and BM CD3/CD19 depleted. T-cell dose was adjusted to 2x105/kg by fresh marrow cell add back at the time of transplant. Both groups received cyclosporine for graft versus host disease prophylaxis for two months post transplant. 3 patients died , 12 patients reject their grafts, and 27 showed full chimerism with functioning grafts at a median follow-up of 56 months. The overall survival, thalassemia free survival and mortality is 90%; 59% and 11%. To analyze immunohematologic reconstitution, particularly NK cells, we evaluated 13 thalassemia patients after 20 and 60 days and 1 year post transplantation with T cell-depleted HLA-haploidentical stem cells. NKs were the fi rst lymphocytes to repopulate the peripheral blood. A signifi cant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ markers paralleled an increase in CD3-CD16+ NKs, especially with full engraftment. In order to increase the T-cell depletion of PBSC while maintaining the anti-infectious and the engraftment facilitating eff ects of the depleted grafts, we have introduced the depletion of \u03b1\u03b2 T Lymphocytes using the CliniMacs System. In addition to the Cd3 depletion, \u03b1\u03b2-depleted grafts contain large number of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes studies were then conducted to determine if \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were capable of preventing graft rejection in the context of haploidentical transplant. Using this new strategies in 3 haploidentical transplant in thalassemia patients we observed more rapid immunological reconstitution after 60 days post transplant, with an increase of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), B cells (CD19+) and NK cells (especially CD3-CD16+, with cytotoxic potential) in the peripheral blood of these patients.",

However, the optimal timing for initiation of G-CSF therapy following APSCT is still not clear. A number of studies have been conducted to determine this timing. Most of these studies investigated whether delayed use (day +3 to day +8) of G-CSF therapy was as safe and effi cient as with early use (day 0 to day +1) of G-CSF therapy after transplantation. We conducted a prospective randomized study comparing the eff ect of daily administration to every other day administration of G-CSF (300 \u03bcgr of fi lgrastim) on neutrophil engraftment following APSCT for non-myeloid hematologic malignancies in adult patients. Duration of G-CSF administration, incidence of blood stream infections, duration of febrile neutropenia, duration of non-prophylactic antibiotic therapy, transfusion requirements, duration of hospitalization and G-CSF costs were also studied. Forty seven patients with diagnosis of lymphoma and multiple myeloma undergoing high-dose therapy and APSCT were randomized to receive post-transplant daily or every other day G-CSF therapy both beginning on day +1. Both groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, diagnosis and antecedent therapy as well as the number of stem cell infused. There was no signifi cant diff erence in time to neutrophil engraftment between the two groups (p=0,31). The duration of G-CSF administration was signifi cantly less in the intermittent group (p<0,001). There were no detectable diff erences seen in the number of febrile days, duration of non-prophylactic antibiotics, the incidence of blood stream infections, transfusion requirements and the duration of hospitalization. There was a trend towards a faster platelet recovery in the intermittent G-CSF treated patients, although the diff erence was not statistically signifi cant compared to daily G-CSF treated group (p=0.059).The number of doses of G-CSF used per transplant is signifi cantly reduced with intermittent employment, resulting in a signifi cant reduction in drug costs.",

Nath (1) Background: Best measure of the quality of a CBU is its timely engraftment post stem cell transplant (SCT). Total nucleated cell count (TNC), CD34 count and determination of viability using tryphan blue and 7 AAD are surrogates for CBU quality. This study examines the eff ect of time on these quality control variables of CBU frozen in 10% DMSO post thaw with and without reconstitution with 10% dextran and 25% albumin. The results are important to determine the optimal time limit of CBU infusion post thaw for patients undergoing CBSCT. Methods: 15 CBUs frozen in 10% DMSO were thawed at 37\u00b0C water bath. 5 CBUs were reconstituted by adding media consisting of 10% dextran and 25% albumin to equal one half of the total syringed volume + 5ml. The other 10 CBU were thawed without the addition of reconstitution media. Trypan Blue viability and 7-AAD viability (by fl ow cytometry), and CD34 viability (by fl ow cytometry) were assessed for each of the CBU immediately post thaw, 30 minutes 1, 1.5, 2 ,4 and 6 hours post thaw. Results: The drop in the total viability of the cells as measured by Trypan Blue (TB) as well as the viability of the CD34+ cells was faster if the reconstitution media was not used. In the presence of the reconstitution media, the viability of the CD34+ cells stayed stable till 1.5 hours (see graph A) whereas there was a sharp decline after 30mins without reconstitution medium (see graph B). Conclusion: As the viability of the CD34+ cells is important, and we need to look at the plateau of the CD34+ viability curve to select a point before which the cells should be infused and the reconstitution media gives a longer and more workable time (1.5 hours) compared to cells that are not in reconstitution media (30 mins). The eff ects of alemtuzumab on peripheral blood nucleated cells (PBPC) grafts need better defi nition. As haematopoietic cells express CD52 antigen, the optima cell number, antibody concentrations or eff ect of complement in the graft are not known. Methods: PBPC from normal 5 allogeneic stem cell donors harvested by apheresis and incubated with incremental concentrations of alemtuzumab (10-2 to 10-5 mg/mL for 30 min at 20\u00baC or at fi xed dose of 10-3 mg alemtuzumab was added to 0.1, 0.5 and 1x107 cells/mL in the presence of fresh or heat inactivated AB serum as source of complement were studied.

Additionally HPC collections using the Optia apheresis machine produce larger volume harvests than those using the Spectra. As Spectra machines are being superseded by Optias, this may pose storage challenges for other centres. In a retrospective study of 50 consecutive Optia and Spectra harvests, collection volumes were 228.3mls \u00b111.57 and 199.8mls \u00b14.7 respectively. To minimise the volumes stored and also to reduce patient exposure to the cryoprotectant dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), the ratio of cell concentration to cryoprotectant mix has been optimised in our centre. HPC products are cryopreserved using a fi nal concentration of 6% DMSO, where the freeze mix comprises 12% of the total product volume and is made from equal quantities of DMSO and saline. In comparison, most centres use a 10% fi nal DMSO concentration achieved by the addition of a 50:50 mix of 20% cryoprotectant to the HPC product. This would have resulted in a 38% increase in cryopreserved volume in the cohort studied, compared with our method which has the additional benefi t of fewer bags stored and reduced DMSO exposure for the patient. Pre and post thaw fl ow cytometric viability studies conducted inhouse have validated our approach at consistently > 93% viable CD34 cell recovery. Furthermore, there is no adverse impact on patient engraftment. Red cell contamination of the HPC product is apheresis dependent.

Cernelc (1) Aim of the study: In this retrospective study we have looked into the transplant outcomes(overall survival,disease free survival,GvHD and immune reconstitution) of T-cell depletion with Alemtuzumab in the stem cell bag of HLA fully matched unrelated donor allografts. Patients and methods: 14 patients received a myeloablative conditioning with TBI/cyclophosphamide (n=10) or busulphan/ cyclophosphamide (n=4). 12 patients had AML in CR and 2 CML (1 chronic phase 1 accelerated phase). All the patients received PBSC grafts and ciclosporin as GvHD prophylaxis along with 15mg of Alemtuzumab in the bag.The median age of the patients were 32.9 (median 17-49). The median follow up was 39 months (range 5-142mo). Results: The 3 year overall survival was 52%. All patients engrafted with a median neutrophil engraftment of 12 days (11-16) and a median Platelet engraftment (PLT>20 unsupported) of 16 days (range 13-21). 42% of patients developed Grade I-II GvHD but none severe grade III-IV. The non relapse mortality was 18% in the first year (all infection related) and the overall relapse rate was 29% (4/14). Immune reconstitution of a CD4 count >200 was observed at a median time of 5 months (range 1-17 months). Conclusion: The strategy of T-cell depletion with Alemtuzumab ex vivo is a simple and eff ective way in reducing transplant related mortality and Graft versus host disease while it maintains a potent graft versus malignancy eff ect and provides a rapid immune reconstitution. Prospective studies with higher number of patients are needed to confi rm these results and defi ne the appropriate dosing of alemtuzumab in the stem cell bag. Conclusions: In our experience the use of BTZ at induction regimen before ASCT at MM's patients shows that it doesn't aff ect the achieve of HSC, and is better than treatments used before the BTZ era. Patients treated with BTZ didn't need more aphaeresis process to achieve the same amount of CD34+ HSC, and wasn't more likely to fail mobilization, than patients treated with other regimens. We have also seen that BTZ not infl uence the risk of being poor mobilizers as alkylating chemotherapy has previously demonstrated. The use of BTZ in induction regimen keeps us to make an ASCT in the most of the patients with MM.",

            "text": "Introduction: End of 2011, stem cell collection facilities were informed by the Terumo BCT Company about the end of life campaign for the Cobe Spectra device. These plans caused a lot of trouble, because the Spectra device is accepted as the gold standard for stem cell collections all over the world. As many others we had to decide, which device we will use in the future for allogeneic and autologous stem cell, lymphocyte and granulocyte collections. Material and Methods: As in many other European countries it is regulated by German authorities how to validate a new technical device and procedure before starting its use in routine production of a stem cell transplant. Because we need a license for our stem cell products, we geared our comparison investigation to German guidelines, which are published by Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. So we performed twelve collection procedures for allogeneic and autologous stem cell products respectively. We compared following results: stem cell count in product, collection effi ciency, contaminating cells, platelet loss in donors or patients, practicability and limitations of the procedure. Results: Amicus and Optia devices both collect autologous and allogeneic stem cell products. Nevertheless there are some diff erences, which we show in table. Conclusion: We found Pro's and Con's for both devices. Amicus collects a smaller volume and fewer platelets. So it is much more suitable for autologous stem cell collections, if products will be cryopreserved and patients are suff ering from thrombopenia. Amicus cannot collect granulocytes and stem cell products contain higher amounts of CD3-positive cells, which can play an important role in mismatched allogeneic transplantations. Optia collects varying and unpredictable volumes. That can cause problems, if cryopreservation is planned. Platelet loss in patients or donors is much higher than in Amicus collection procedures. Optia has a granulocyte collection protocol. Stem cell products contain fewer CD3-positive cells, which can be an advantage in mismatched transplantations. The decision, which device replaces Spectra best, should focus on the product type.",

            "text": "[P693] S195 Their study indicated a high rate of successful engraftment and a low incidence of acute GVHD. In our 1998 study, 38 patients were transplanted with bone marrow from sibling donors (i.o. (n=8) i.o.+ iv (n=10) and iv (n=20)). The majority of the patients were diagnosed with acute or chronic leukemia (33/38). With a median follow-up of 15.6 (14. 2-16.1) years, 15 patients are alive. We did not experience any graft failure after i.o. infusion and no diff erences in chronic GVHD, TRM, relapse or PFS when comparing the io and iv groups. We conclude that long-term outcome of io infusion of bone marrow stem cells is safe and that the results are similar to those from the current clinical practice of iv infusion. The long-term consequences and experiences of io as compared with iv infusion of bone marrow would most likely be the same after peripheral blood or cord blood intraosseous stem cell transplantation. Further randomized studies are warranted to answer the question whether it is time to switch from iv to io HSCT regardless of stem cell sources. Background: Plerixafor is a new CXCR4 antagonist that induces the mobilization of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow to circulation. Limited experimental data suggest that plerixafor+ Granulocyte-Colony Stimulator Factor (G-CSF) mobilized apheresis products (HPC-A) are functionally diff erent from G-mobilized HPC-A. Aim of the study: To evaluate the eff ects of plerixafor injection on graft composition in terms of lymphocytes subsets, monocytes and on gene expression profi le of molecules involved in immune network, cellular adhesion, engraftment. Methods: Fourteen patients aff ected by multiple myeloma were included in the study. All patients received G-CSF alone or after high dose cyclophosphamide to mobilize stem cells. Six patients received plerixafor pre-emptively owing to poor mobilization or poor collection yields. The rest of the patients constituted the control group. Graft composition was evaluated by fl ow cytometric analyses in terms of CD34+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD56+, CD14+ cells. Gene expression profi les were evaluated on peripheral blood samples after G-CSF administration and, when plerixafor was injected, daily after every dose.",

Intramyocardial stem cell transplantation is expected to improve ventricular remodelling and survival. In our study, autologous CD34+ haematopoietic progenitors intended for the myocardial regeneration were collected after mobilization with G-CSF, then the CD34+ fraction was enriched and collection effi ciency was evaluated. Methods: Samples from 40 adult patients were used to prepare CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor stem cell enriched and concentrated products intended for autologous transplantation. The fi nal volume of therapeutic transplant was 8 mL. The median age of patients was 54 years. Immunomagnetic separation by targeting CD34 antigen using CliniMACS (Miltenyi Biotech) was used to enrich CD34+ cells. For the quality analysis, samples were taken from each apheresis product pre-and post-immunomagnetic selection. After staining cells with anti-CD45, anti-CD34 and 7-AAD, fl uorescent beads were added for evaluation of viable CD34+ count by fl ow cytometry and the CD34+ cell separation effi ciency was calculated.",

We included 19 autologus stem cell transplantation patients with diff erent diagnosis and 6 healthy donors for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CD34ALDHbr cell percentage in the apheresis products of autologus and allogeneic transplantation patients were 0.78% and 0.49% respectively.

Limited data are available regarding the value of salvage therapy with a second AHCT (AHCT2) in patients who relapse/progress after AHCT1, and the factors that determine outcome of AHCT2. We analysed all MM patients who underwent salvage AHCT2 at Hammersmith Hospital (HH), later Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT), over a 18-year period (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) . The patient population is derived from a multi-ethnic community of approximately two million in an equal-access healthcare system and includes a large proportion of patients that received novel agents for treatment of relapse/progression after AHCT1. Between January 1994 and December 2011, a total of 404 MM patients underwent AHCT1. Of those, 83 patients received AHCT2 for relapse/progression following AHCT1. Median time to progression after AHCT1 for patients who received AHCT2 was 21.5 months (range, . Median interval between AHCT1 and AHCT2 was 35.4 months (95%CI: 9-93). Median age at AHCT2 was 60.9 years (range, 32-73).Most patients who underwent AHCT2 (77%) had received treatment with novel agents between AHCT1 and AHCT2, and 28% of patients were from ethnic minority groups. Non-relapse mortality at 100 days after AHCT2 was 7% (n=6). Median overall survival (OS) from AHCT2 was 31.5 months (95%CI: 22 -41 with bortezomib, and conditioning with full-dose melphalan (200mg/m2) were associated with better PFS. In multivariate analysis, only disease status and time to progression/relapse remained associated with better PFS. In summary, salvage AHCT2 is an effective treatment option in patients with chemosensitive relapse/progression and prolonged remission after a prior autograft.",

Results: A phase I/II open label study was initiated to assess the safety (as a primary end-point) and effi cacy (as a secondary end point) of ImMucin, in 15 MUC1-positive asymptomatic MM patients following autologous stem cell transplantation with residual disease or progression. Patients received 12 bi-weekly vaccination of 100mcg ImMucin plus 250mcg hGM-CSF. Interim analysis conducted on 7 patients who completed the study suggests a high safety profi le for the vaccine with only temporary (up to 24 hours) mostly local mild adverse events which resolved spontaneously. Immunomonitoring analysis by ICS-IFN-\u03b3, tetramer and anti-SP antibodies demonstrated a unique combination of robust ImMucin-specifi c IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8+ (18-80 fold increase) and CD4+ (4-80 folds increase) T-cells with pan HLA properties in all 7 patients, as well as a 1.4-10 folds increase in anti-ImMucin serum concentration in 5/7 patients. Specifi c immunity could already be detected after 2-4 vaccinations In-addition, a decrease in soluble MUC1 levels was observed in all 4 patients who had abnormal (>300pg/ml) levels at screening. Levels dropped from 3500-10000pg/ml at screening to 50-290pg/ml in 3/7 patients and from 9000 to 3000pg/ml in an additional one. We also observed a stabilization or reduction in FLC, M-protein disease markers and in bone marrow MM cells in 4/7 patients following the treatment. Conclusions: These results confi rm a high safety profi le with robust immunodominant properties and are suggestive of clinical effi cacy for the ImMucin vaccine.",

Aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the prognostic signifi cance of PET/CT in MM patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). All patients were studied with PET/ CT before and within 6 months after allo-SCT. The number and the size of focal lesions (FL) were recorded and PET/CT was considered positive if it showed at least 1 FL. The outcome of PET/CT positive and negative patients was compared in term of cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR ) and OS after allo-SCT. A total of 29 patients with a median age of 54 years (44-65) were analyzed. At diagnosis 14% had renal failure and 10 % had plasma cells in peripheral blood and/or in cerebrospinal fl uid. Del (13q), t(4;14) or del(17p), detected by FISH, were present in 50%. All patients received upfront auto-SCT , followed by allo-SCT within 3 months in 11 cases, while in the other 18 cases allo-SCT was performed after failure of previous auto-SCT. Median time between diagnosis and allo-SCT was 19 months (9-129). Conditioning was with Fludarabine plus 2 Gy TBI (73%) or melphalan 140 mg/mq (27%) Sixty-nine per cent of patients were transplanted from HLA matched unrelated donors. Chemosensitive disease was present in 73% of patients before allo-SCT. Two-year PFS and OS of the entire population were 42% and 31%, respectively. Before allo-SCT , 38% of the patients had a negative PET/CT, 24% presented \u22643 FL and 38% had > 3 FL. The entity of PET/CT involvement before allo-SCT infl uenced clinical outcomes. In particular, patients with positive PET/CT had a signifi cantly higher CIR and shorter OS in comparison with patients with negative PET/CT (2-year CIR 82% vs 32%, P=0.03, 2-year OS 23% vs 52% , P= 0.04). After 6 months from ASCT, PET/CT was negative in 45% of the patients and remained positive in 55% of them.

Lindstrom, T. Ruutu Helsinki University Central Hospital (Helsinki, FI) The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has been rapidly evolving with novel drugs, but this disease is still regarded as incurable. The place of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in the treatment of MM is unclear. It off ers the possibility to harness the curative potential of the graft-versus-myeloma eff ect, but high SCT-related mortality (TRM) has limited its use. We report our experience of 120 patients treated with allogeneic SCT since the year 2000. The median age of the patients was 50 (range 28-65) years and 52% were males. Forty-nine patients received a myeloablative (MAC) and 71 patients a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC the external beam radiation to be \"focused\" upon the site of the neoplasm, reducing the radiation dose administered to nonaff ected tissues. This conformal radiation technique increases the therapeutic window of external beam radiation. We hypothesize that IMRT will allow the selective administration of higher doses of external beam radiation to bone marrow than Total Body Irradiation (TBI) without increasing the toxicity to normal tissues beyond that induced by TBI. Herein, we report our preliminary experience. Methods: We are carrying out a Phase 1 study using a modifi ed 3+3 cohort dose escalation study where IMRT conditioning was delivered using Tomotherapy\u00ae prior to stem cell re-infusion in a second ASCT in patients with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma ( Figure 1 ). Our modifi ed dose escalation schema allows us to limit doses to specifi c organs when dose limiting toxicity is reached for a specifi c organ, while escalating the doses in other organs where dose limiting toxicity is not reached. Baseline characteristics, prior therapies and duration of prior responses were documented. Dose limiting toxicities and radiation toxicities were assessed by the Regimen Toxicity scale and LENT-SOMA respectively. Results: Seven patients (5 males and 2 females) with a mean age of 54 years received a second ASCT using IMRT conditioning, where all patients had previously received a Melphalan 200mg/m 2 ASCT. Median follow-up from 2nd ASCT is 16 months. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, therapy received as well as pragmatic clinical outcomes are summarized in Table 1 . No dose limiting toxicities were noted with IMRT ASCT at 18Gy. Conclusion: Tomotherapy\u00ae delivery of IMRT based ASCT is safe and has the potential to improve the quality and duration of responses in patients with relapsed myeloma. Background: There are considerable concerns regarding the appropriate use of health care resources to reduce costs and waiting lists associated with autologous (Auto) hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). One of the strategies to reach this goal is outpatient-based. We report the results of an outpatient, home-treatment program for patients (pts) receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and stem cells support. Patients and Methods: Between July 2010 and December 2012, supportive care in the aplastic phase after HDC was transferred from the hospital to the home setting using three diff erent approaches. Eligible pts had received treatment with a single course of High-Dose Melphalan (HDM) (200 mg/mq) followed by Auto-HPCT for Multiple Myeloma. In the fi rst inpatient cohort (IN), the supportive care designed for at home use was administered in hospital until neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 10(9)/l. In the second outpatient cohort (OUT), pts were discharged the day after HPCT, but supportive care was delivered daily in the outpatient clinic. The third home care cohort (HC) consisted of pts who were discharged the day after HPCT and then received all subsequent supportive care at home, without any check-up in hospital, with the assistance of specialized home care transplant professionals. In the OUT and HC, pts were required to have an available caregiver at home to help monitoring patient's condition, drug administration and fl uid intake. In case of refusal of outpatient treatment or lack of available caregivers, pts were included in the inpatient cohort. Results: 82 pts were treated (IN=47, OUT=24 HC=11). IN were hospitalized (as days of hospitalization after HPCT) in the aplastic phase for a median of 16 days. OUT attended the outpatient clinic in the aplastic phase for a median of 9 days. In the OUT cohort, a patient could not be discharged after stem cells infusion, due to general malaise, and readmissions to hospital were 2/24 due to chemotherapy-related toxicity and severe arrhythmia, respectively. In the HC cohort, pts were seen at home twice a day for a median of 10 days and readmission to hospital was necessary in 1 case due to fever. No infectious deaths or unexpected emergencies occurred in the OUT or HC cohort. Neither was there any suggestion of an increased number of fevers, infections, or other complications.",

Background: MM is a disease of older pts with a median age of 69 at diagnosis, but a signifi cant number (6%) of pts are younger than 50 at diagnosis. Although, there are a few reports that address the outcome in younger pts, there is limited information on their disease characteristics, response to therapy, and overall outcome. Methods: We compared the characteristics and outcome of 341 younger pts (<50 years) with 1129 older pts (\u226550 years) who received high-dose chemotherapy and auto-HCT at our institution between July 1988 and December 2011. All pts received auto-HCT in fi rst remission or for primary refractory disease. The primary objective was to compare the response rates, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between the younger and older groups.

            "text": "The Extramedullary plasmocytoma (EP) is a plasma cell tumor which involves soft tissues, without any signs of systemic spread. EP have an incidence of 7%-17% in patients (pts) at the time of diagnosis and 6%-20% during the course of the disease. It can be found at any body sites. Response to conventional treatments is poor. Objective: in our study we wanted to test the hypothesis that standard US could detect EM and that contrast-enhanced ultrasound sonography (CEUS) could detect microvascular changes (MC) and possibly suggest response to treatment. Methods: we prospectively examined patients (pts) who were admitted on our BMT ward to undergo either ASCT or allo-BMT. All pts received abdominal and soft tissues (ST) US and all lesions detected were biopsied. All lesions were assessed with CEUS which utilizes a second generation sulfur-exafl uoride-based contrast media. CEUS allows for real-time imaging of the microcirculation. Results: out of 115 pts (enrolled in the last 3 years) we found 11 pts having EP (9.6% incidence). Sites involved were : retroperitoneum (N=3 pts), liver (N=2 pts), pancreas (N=3 pts), ST (N=3 pts), pleural (N= 1 pts), lung (N= 1), spleen (N=1). Disease status at EP diagnosis: VGPR (8) or SD (2) Introduction: Autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHSCT) has established itself as the preferred therapy for younger patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Throughout its history, one of the main challenges of AHSCT has been the difficulty in mobilising the necessary stem cells. In 2002 a scoring system was introduced in order to reduce the apheresis procedures needed (Table 1 ). Under this system, the patient is evaluated premobilisation in an attempt to detect patients with a risk of poor mobilisation (poor mobilisers). The patient is thus 'scored' and this score is then used to outline the treatment. Target: Evaluate the infl uence of the mobilisation system score on the stem-cell apheresis process, based on the study of the processed volemia ratio and the number of performed aphereses. Study Design and Methods: A total of 77 patients with multiple myeloma treated with ASHCT, aged between 47 and 66 were evaluated. 23 underwent ASHCT before the scoring system was established ( Group 1, 1996 Group 1, to 2002 , while 54 were treated with the scoring system already in place ( Group 2, 2003 Group 2, -2011 . The analyzed parameters were the volemia ratio (blood volume processed in the apheresis (liters) / patient volemia) and the number of apheresis procedures. G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor) was used for mobilisation, dosed at 10 \u03bcg/kg for 4 to 5 days. If the pre-treatment score was over 2.5 points the patient was categorised as a poor mobiliser and the C-GSF dose was doubled.",

From 2001-2012 27 consecutive patients (pts, median age 52 years (yrs), range 38-67, f=7, m=20) with REL (n=7) or PRO (n=20) after single (n=11) or tandem (n=16) auto-HCT were treated with salvage allo-HCT at the University Hospital Tuebingen. Busulfan/cyclophosphamide (CY)/total marrow irradiation (n=8), fl udarabine(FLU)/CY/2Gy total body irradiation (n=8), FLU/melphalan (n=5), FLU/thiotepa/melphalan (n=2) or FLU/treosulfan (n=4) were used for conditioning. Immunosuppression consisted of antithymocyte globuline, calcineurin inhibitor combined with mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate. Allo-HCT was performed after a median of 29 months after auto-HCT. G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from matched related (n=8), haploidentical (n=2), matched unrelated (n=14) or mismatched unrelated (n=3) donors were used. No grafts were rejected. 9 pts received donor lymphocyte infusions after a median of 353 days in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) due to mixed chimerism (n=1), REL (n=4) or PRO (n=4). Median follow-up was 1426 days (range 184-3512) resulting in an estimated 4-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of 37% and 15%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and REL/PRO at 4 yrs was 22% and 63%. Auto-HCT (n=11, 2001 -2005 for induction prior to allo-HCT showed a decreased OS compared to induction regimens containing thalidomide (n=2), lenalidomide (n=7) or bortezomib (n=6) S209 and the role of DLI and pretransplant characteristics in patients who had a suboptimal response to an autologous stem cell transplant (less than a year of Progression free survival) and underwent a T-cell depleted allograft for multiple myeloma. Patients and methods: 19 patients received a reduced conditioning non-myeloablative transplant with Fludarabine/Melphalan and in vivo Alemtuzumab. All the patients received PBSC grafts and ciclosporin as GvHD prophylaxis along with 30mg of Alemtuzumab IV over one day for sibling donors and 50mg IV over 2 days for unrelated donors. 9 patients had a sibling donor and 10 had a graft from an unrelated donor. The median age of the patients was 48.7(median 38-59). The median follow up was 41 months(range 3-110mo). 9 patients had an IPSS score of 1, 5 had an IPSS score of 2 and 5 had an IPSS score of 3 at diagnosis. 7 of the patients were in CR2 at the time of transplant 9 were in PR2 and 2 in VGPR2. The average lines of treatment was 3 pretransplant (range 2-5). Results: The 3 year overall survival was 47%. The non relapse mortality was 11% in the fi rst year. All patients engrafted with a median neutrophil engraftment of 16.5 days (10-35) and a median Platelet engraftment (PLT>20 unsupported) of 20days (range 13-27). 50% of patients developed Grade I-II GvHD but only 15% severe grade III-IV. 9 patients received DLI 4 for mixed chimerism and 5 for disease relapse. IPSS score and disease status pretransplant were not signifi cant in predicting overall survival and disease free survival but the number of treatments pretransplant was predictive of non relapse mortality (p:0.04). The overall relapse rate was 52% (10/19) . Interesting enough acute GVHD was not signifi cant for infl uencing disease free survival but patients who received DLI had an improved Overall survival (P:0.05). Conclusion: Although the number of patients in our study is low Reduced intensity conditioning allografts for myeloma is an efficient and low toxicity treatment for those who had a suboptimal response post autologous stem cell transplant. The role of preemptive DLI need to be explored as well as post transplant maintenance treatment(or a combination of both) to maximise the response and minimise relapse rates. However it is still remains debatable whether a reduced intensity allograft is a curable option for these patients as late relapses can occur. Results: Of 14 patients treated with TT/Mel regimen (male 6; female 8; median age 63), 9 were receiving fi rst ASCT and 5 were receiving second ASCT. At the time of transplant 2 patients were in CR, 3 in VGPR, 5 in PR, while the other 4 showed stable or progressive disease; median number of prior treatment lines was 3 (range 2-8). All patient received peripheral blood stem cells (Median number of nucleated cells reinfused 3,5x108/kg) and engrafted, with a median number of days to neutrophil count \u22651000/mm3 of 9,5 (range 9-11), and a median number of days to platelets count \u226520.000/mm3 of 12, 5 (range 11-17) . No patients died for transplant related mortality; median number of days of hospitalization was 11 (range 9-15). Most common adverse events included standard toxicities: 4 patients (28%) experienced oral mucositis (2 grade II/III), 6 patients (42%) gastrointestinal mucositis (3 grade II/III) and only 1 patient experienced a mild liver toxicity, which was self-limiting. Fever of unknown origin, responding to empirical antibiotic therapy, was observed in 5 patients (35%). The overall response rate was 42% (5CR/1VGPR), 1 patient maintained PR (7%), while the other 7 showed active disease after ASCT (5 of them performed ASCT as salvage therapy for high risk disease). At a median follow-up of 12 months, 5 patients died for disease progression, while 9 were alive; median overall survival was of 9,6 months and disease free survival was of 6,4 months. Conclusion: TT/Mel regimen was feasible and well tolerated in terms of toxicity; response rate and survival were as expected for MM, but effi cacy in terms of disease control should be investigated in larger studies.",

To date,G-CSF is the most common cytokine administered for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization however a proportion of patients fails to mobilize adequately. Pegylated G-CSF (Peg-GCSF) was considered for mobilization while reducing the duration of treatment and off ering better control of the leukapheresis process.From May 2006 to November 2011, 68 pts with newly diagnosed MM were included into a phase II randomized trial. Responders to 3 to 4 cycles of induction therapy were randomized to receive mobilization treatment by fi lgrastim 10 \u03bcg/kg daily administered until last day of leukapheresis (arm A, n= 23) vs a single injection of pegG-CSF 12 mg (arm B, n= 23 ) vs pegG-CSF 18 mg (arm C, n= 22 ). Induction chemotherapy with lenalidomide was not tolerated in this study due to raising concern about its ability to adversely aff ect mobilization. One patient was excluded from the analysis since induction therapy contained lenalidomide. Given the narrow mobilization peak observed from previous studies using PegGCSF, CD34+ count was required 48 hours post growth factor (GF) administration until a minimum of 10 CD34+/\u03bcL was reached determining the fi rst day of leukapheresis. In 19 patients (28%), the 48 hours post GF was missed due to organizational issues.",

Methods: In our patient aged 43 multiple myeloma (\u03ba light-chain, t,11,14) was diagnosed on the background of chronic renal insuffi ciency in Nov.2008. Very good partial remission was achived with bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) therapy and hemodialysis. The patient underwent autologous periferal blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation after single melphalane (140 mg/m>2) conditioning regimen. Complete remission (CR) was achived, but the anuria remained, so we decided to do double transplantation, as he had a HLA-identical brother. G-CSF mobilized allogeneic PBSC was collected from the sibling donor, and the allo-graft was cryopreserved. After this stem cell collection the kidney transplantation was carried out from the same donor, on 21 Apr.2011 succesfully. Rapamune and tacrolimus were applied as immunosuppressive (ISU) treatments. Seven months following the successful kidney transplantation the allogeneic PBSC transplantation was done at the incipient relapse of the underlying disease on 24 Oct.2011. Conditioning regimen for the allogeneic transplant included total body irradiation (with the protection of the new kidney in the low pelvic region) + melphalane 140 mg/ m>2. Rapamune and tacrolimus were continued for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prevention. Several complications developed, as severe oro-pharyngeal mucositis, neutropenic fever, sepsis with acute renal insuffi ciency. Acute GVHD (gut) gr.II. was verifi ed with colon biopsy on 28 post-transplant day and treated with 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone successfully. Result: This \"double\" transplantation was successful: our patient is well, living in CR of multiple myeloma, his renal functions are normal and he has got a complete donor chimerism, no GVHD activity 20 months following kidney and 14 months following the allogeneic PBSC transplantation. He receives only tacrolimus as ISU treatment in decreasing dose since Sep.2012.",

            "text": "The above data have shown comparable to those seen in patients undergoing conditioning with melphalan. Our preliminary experience demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the proposed scheme in terms of toxicity, a larger series of patients and a longer follow-up time will be able to provide data on the eff ectiveness (EFS and OS). Background: allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic approach for patients with hematologic malignances, including multiple myeloma (MM). However, the role of allo-HSCT in MM is controversial due to the high attributable procedure-related mortality previously reported. Objective: to analyze the outcome of patients with MM undergoing allo-HSCT vs. others hematological diseases in a single center. Patients and method: we retrospectively studied 102 patients (pts) with a median age of 48 years (range 2-64), who underwent allo-HSCT in our institution between January 2007 and November 2012. The patients\u203a baseline diseases were: MM 30 pts (29%), AML/ MDS 33 pts (32%), ALL 19 pts (18%), and NHL/HL 20 pts (21%). 43% of pts had undergone a previous transplant. 51% pts received allo-HSCT from siblings, and 49% from unrelated donors. The source of HSC was peripheral blood in 55%, bone marrow in 39% and umbilical cord blood in 6% cases. All pts with MM received conditioning with fl udarabine (150 mg/m 2 ), melphalan (140 mg/m 2 ) and thymoglobulin (1.5-3 mg/kg). The rest of the cases received conditioning with standard (61 pts; 85%) or reduced intensity (11 pts; 15%) regimens. Median follow-up of the series was 24 months (range: 1-72). Results: median hospital stay was 35 days (range: 24-79), with no diff erences among diseases. Peritransplant mortality was 5% (0% for pts with MM, and 7% for the rest). Overall survival (OS) at day +100 was 88 % (93.4% for pts with MM, and 87.5% for the rest). The rate of progression/relapse was 30% for pts with MM, and 29.2% for the rest. The OS rate at 2 years was 77 % for MM pts, and 58.3% for the rest. Progression-free survival at 2 years was 58% for MM pts, and 67% for the rest. There were no signifi cant betweengroup diff erences in OS and PFS. Conclusions: in our experience, allo-HSCT for pts with MM is a potentially curative and feasible therapeutic approach, with a procedure-associated morbimortality similar to that of other hematological malignances. Introduction: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is standard approach for initial or treatment of relapses for multiple myeloma (MM) pts younger then 65 years. ASCT is connected with better overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)in comparison with conventional therapy. Aim: We retrospectively analyzed pts with MM treated with ASCT in our center from 1998. till 2010. Methods: Ninety nine procedures of ASCT in 85 de novo MM pts were performed after one or two lines of initial treatment. Male/ female ratio in our group was 49/ 36, average age was 52 years (37-64). Majority of pts, 56 (66%) were in III clinical stage. Pts have received 3-6 cycles of induction (VAD, CTD or TAD). Prior to ASCT, 31 pts (36%) were in CR+VGPR, 38 pts (45%) in PR, 9 pts (10,58%) were in less then PR and 5 pts (5,88%) had PD. Median time from diagnosis till ASCT was 13,9 months . Single ASCT was done in 85 pts (86%), tandem in 4 (4,7%) and secondary in 10 (11,76%) pts. Mobilization was combination of Cyclophosphamide (Cy) and Etoposide with G-CSF in 77 pts (91%) or Cy alone with G-CSF in 8 pts (9%). Seventy one pts (86%) were conditioned with Melphalan (Mel) (200mg/m 2 ), while 14 pts (16%) were conditioned with Buslulphan (16 mg/kgBW), Cy (120 mg/kgBW) and Mel (140 mg/m 2 ). MNC were collected mostly with one \"high volume\" apheresis and median number was 9,85x10 8 /kgBW (range 3,8-28x10 8 ). OS and duration of response were showed with Kaplan Meier method. Results: Engraftment was observed on +12. day after ASCT (range 8-36), respectively. In 2 pts there were no reconstitution and in 3 pts it was delayed. Overall response rate (ORR) is achieved in 73 (91%) pts. After ASCT, 46 pts (54%) have achieved CR+VGPR, while 27 pts (32%) were in PR. Nineteen (24%) pts have died and 61 pts (76%) are still alive. Median PFS for 32 pts (40%) after ASCT was 13 months. In 10 of those pts, we have done secondary ASCT. Median OS in 80 pts (2 have died during the procedure and 3 were lost from following) is 40 months with maximal follow up for 57 months. Conclusion: Achievements of CR+VGPR before and post ASCT are important predictive factor for OS and PFS. Better OS and PFS were achieved in those pts in whom ASCT was performed early. Transplant related mortality (TRM) is observed in heavily pretreated pts who were transplanted more then 12 months after diagnosis. TRM in our group is 5%. New agents and better supportive therapy together with ASCT with well defi ned maintenance will improve treatment results even more. Introduction: MM is the main indication for high dose chemotherapy with ASCT The recent development of novel agents like bortezomib, thalidomide, has improved response rates.There is concern about their possible deleterious eff ects on PBSC (peripheral blood stem cell) collection and engraftment following ASCT. We analyzed retrospectively our experience with conventional chemotherapy (VBCMP/VBAD) induction and a novel regimen (VTD) in newly diagnosed MM patients and compare their infl uence on stem cell yield and engraftment effi ciency. Patients and Methods: We reviewed 31 newly diagnosed, symptomatic MM patients treated with ASCT as part of frontline therapy from November 2003 to November 2012. They received: group A: VBCMP/VBAD alternating regimen,6 cycles (4 before PBSC collection) 22 patients (pts) and group B: VTD 6 cycles (9 pts). Pts characteristics were homogeneous in both groups (see table 1 ). All patients were mobilized with GCSF 10mcg/kg/d for 5 days after induction treatment for PBSC collection. Stem cells (SC) were frozen to -80\u00aa C by non-controlled rate freezing with DMSO 5%. All patients underwent ASCT with Melphalan 200 as conditioning regimen and received GCSF 5mcg/kg/d from day +5. Results: The response rate prior to ASCT for group A was 13.6% CR(complete response), 86.4% PR (partial response); in group B it was 66.7% CR, 11.1% VGPR (very good partial response) and 22.2% PR. Median number of CD34 in PB (peripheral blood) prior to apheresis was 30 (10-66)/mcl in group A and 53 (10-70)/mcl in group B. In both groups the median number of apheresis performed was 2. The median number of CD34 was 2.9x106/Kg in group A and 3.05x106/kg in group B; median number of MNC (mononuclear cells was 8.42x108/kg and 5.73x108/kg in group A and B respectively. No patient developed adverse events during the mobilization and apheresis procedure. One patient in group A (4.7%) failed (< 2x10e6 CD34/Kg) the fi rst mobilization attempt and received Cyclophosphamide+G-CSF with successful collection. All patients received ASCT as planned and achieved engraftment. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 11 days(d) 9-15) and 11d(11-30) respectively in group A and 11d(10-13) and 10(9-13)in group B. Median number of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and platelets transfusions were 2(0-10) and 2 in group A and 2(0-2)and 2(0-3) in group B. Conclusion: In our experience VTD is an eff ective induction regimen for MM with an appropriate stem cell yield and time to engraftment after ASCT, not inferior to our previous chemotherapy regimen. No eff ective treatment exists for neuroinfl ammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Future treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) aims at restoring myelination and neurological functions as well as re-induction of self-tolerance. Mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSC) are known to be anti-infl ammatory and multi-potent.",

            "text": "Using MSCs from green fl uorescent donors for treatment of autoimmune encephalitis in mice, we documented that MSCs can cross the blood-brain barrier, regulate autoimmunity and control paralysis. Based on these observations we pioneered a phase I/II open clinical trial using autologous bone marrow derived MSCs in 13 patients with severe MS failing all conventional modalities and14 patients with very advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We confi rmed that treatment with MSCs is feasible, safe and potentially eff ective. Based on our published preliminary study, a total of >250 patients were similarly treated at our center, mostly patients with MS, ALS, autism, stroke, each treated with 106 MSC/ Kg intrathecally and additional 0.5-1x106 MSC/Kg intravenously. Treatment was uneventful with self-limited headache due to lumbar puncture being the most frequent complaint (70%). A total of 60% of patients with MS reported improved outcome, some with very signifi cant objective improvement of EDSS score. No major side eff ect were developed or reported during a follow up period of nearly 6 years. In ALS treatment seemed to delay disease progression although further prospective studies are needed to confi rm effi cacy of treatment. Treatment seemed to be eff ective in autism with objective signs of improvement confi rmed by pediatric neurologist in one of 5 children and by the parents in other 4. More recently, we discovered a new technology for diff erentiation of bone marrow, adipose tissue and cord/placenta derived MSCs into neural stem cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, dopaminergic neurons and also to motor neurons. We conclude that treatment with multi-potent undiff erentiated MSCs is safe and potentially eff ective for immune regulation of MS possibly also for facilitation of remyelinization. Treatment with MSCs should be investigated prospectively in MS and additional neurodegenerative disorders. In the future diff erentiated MSCs may provide better opportunities for more eff ective regeneration of neurological defi cits caused by destructive neurological diseases. Pre-clinical investigations are underway to confi rm effi cacy of diff erentiated MSCs. Objective: Endothelial-colony forming cells (ECFCs) can be readily expanded from human umbilical cord blood and can facilitate repair of endothelial injury. E-selectin and SDF-1\u03b1 are produced following endothelial injury and can regulate endothelial progenitor homing. Mechanisms of vascular repair specifi c to the mode of injury have not been well described in homogenous cell populations such as ECFCs and are needed for development of more eff ective vascular repair strategies. Methods and Results: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic injury to mature human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was compared with hypoxic and radiation injury. E-selectin expression in HUVEC cells is markedly increased (208-fold) following LPS-induced injury and facilitates increased ECFC adhesion and migration function in vitro. SDF-1\u03b1 expression remains unchanged in LPS-treated HUVEC cells but increases more than 2 fold in fi broblasts undergoing similar endotoxic injury.

Alvarez-Gonzalez (1) It is now clear that human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) can be a source of not only Haematopoietic Stem Cells but also a range of diff erent stem cells populations, including a very rare embryoniclike stem cell (ELSC) population. This fraction has been described as lacking CD45 expression but expressing markers typical for pluripotent stem cells. The aim of this work was to characterise, isolate and expand this stem cell fraction for future regenerative medicine purposes. Methods: Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) were prepared by lysing red blood cells (BD PharmLyse), or by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM). The CBMCs were enriched for ELSC cells by negative selection by biotin-conjugated antibodies (Ab) to CD235a, CD11b, CD123, CD45, and CD61 and passage through an LD column following incubation with anti-microbead conjugated Ab. The resulting population was characterized for surface and intracellular markers by fl ow cytometry, fl uorescence microscopy and RT-PCR and plated into diff erent stem cell culture conditions. Results: We isolated a small population with high density and nuclei/cytoplasm ratio and expressing the stem cell markers CD34 and CXCR4, but in opposition to some reports, not CD133. Despite the expression of pluripotent markers such as Sox2, Oct3/4, and Nanog at the mRNA level, these cells did not shown any expansion in vitro using a variety of culture conditions frequently used to grow embryonic and/or adult stem cells. Further analysis by Flow Cytometry of the lineage-(mature leukocyte markers) CD45population, showed the presence of a new Lineage-CD45-Nestin \u00b1 population that has not described previously in hUCB.",

The presence of Nestin could correspond to a previously described mesenchymal progenitor called small-sized nestin-positive bone marrow stem cell (S-BMSC); nevertheless more work is needed to clarify this correlation. Finally, the fact they did not show any capacity for self-renewal might indicate a quiescent population and could cast doubt on their defi nition as ELSC.

Goloschapov (1) (N=5), germinoma (N=4), pineoblastoma (N=2) and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (N=3) received HDCT with auto-HSCT after induction chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical treatment. At the moment of HDCT 13 patients were in complete remission (CR), 14 patients were in partial remission (PR) and 3 patients had stable disease (SD). The conditioning regimen for single auto-HDCT consisted of cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide, or carboplatin, etoposide and thiotepa, or thiotepa and temozolomide. In tandem HDCT, the fi rst conditioning regimen was carboplatin and etoposide with intraventricular/intrathecal metotrexat, the second was thiotepa and cyclophosphamide with intraventricular/intrathecal metotrexat. Bone marrow (N=20), peripheral blood stem cells (N=5) or both (N=5) were used for stem cell sources. The mean transplanted CD34+ cell dose was 5.27 x 10 6 /kg (range, 1.0-8.9 x 10 6 /kg). Results: The median follow-up is 12 months (range, 1-82). The median time to engraftment was 16 (range 12-30) and 17 (range 13-86) days after the fi rst and second auto-HSCT, respectively. All patients with SD at the moment of auto-HSCT died of disease progression. Eight of 27 patients with CR or PR relapsed 1-11 months after HDCT, the other 19 patients are currently in CR. The following therapy toxicity was observed: liver toxicity grade 2-3 (N=21), skin toxicity grade 3-4 (N=6), severe mucositis grade 3-4 (N=15), nausea/vomiting grade 3-4 (N=10), infectious complications grade 3-4 (N=18). Two patients died of toxicity. Overall survival (OS) in all groups was 44% and disease free survival (DFS) was 35%. OS was signifi cantly better among high-risk patients in 1st CR compared to patients in 2nd or following CR: 69% and 30%, respectively (p=0,05). The same correlation was observed in DFS: 46% and 26%, accordingly (p=0,04). Conclusions: HDCT with auto-HSCT in pediatric patients with high-risk CNS tumors may be a feasible option for patients in CR or PR after induction chemotherapy. It is ineff ective as a salvage therapy in refractory patients. Objectives: Over the last few years, several targeted agents (TA) have proven, within large randomized trials, to improve survival in advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC), thus establishing new standards for both fi rst and subsequent lines of treatment. Despite the improvements achieved with TA, immunotherapy still remains the only treatment which is able to induce long-lasting complete responses in aRCC. More recently, the activity of more sophisticated immunotherapeutic agents reinforced the idea that the manipulation of the immune system could play a key role in this setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of adoptive immunotherapy with ex vivo-generated autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in patients with advanced RCC. Materials Aand Methods: CTLs were generated by stimulating CD8-enriched lymphocytes with dendritic cells pulsed with apoptotic autologous tumor cells in the presence of IL-12 and IL-7. Anti-tumor CTLs thus obtained were rapidly expanded in an antigen-independent way and then reinfused after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fl udarabine, followed by subcutaneous administration of low dose IL-2. Disease status was assessed after every second infusions. Eight patients, median age 51, have been enrolled so far, after signing informed consent, 6 with clear cell RCC, 1 with papillary RCC and 1 with mixed papillary and collecting ducts RCC. The median number of metastatic sites was 4 (2-7) and the median time between diagnosis of RCC and biopsy was 55 months Antibody-mediated in-vivo T-cell depletion is common prior to unrelated (URD) or mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) and optional in HLA-identical sibling (FAM) alloSCT. While anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is the current standard, alemtuzumab is an alternative. The optimal dose of alemtuzumab has not been defi ned. This retrospective analysis compares low-dose alemtuzumab with ATG in URD alloSCT and with no antibody in FAM alloSCT. Twenty-eight patients treated with alemtuzumab (10mg, HLAmismatch: 20mg) were matched to 28 patients who have either received ATG (URD) or no antibody (noAB) according disease, disease stage, age, transplant type, and risk state. Both groups were compared for engraftment, outcome, disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS), GvHD, freedom from GvHD (ff GvHD) and transplant-related mortality (TRM).",

Reducedintensity conditioning (RIC) is feasible in patients (pts) not eligible for myeloablative conditioning (MAC), however relapse rates are increased, especially in pts not in remission. Fludarabine-treosulfan (FT) is an eff ective regimen with limited toxicity. A small dose-fi nding study recommended treosulfan 14 gr/m2 x3 for further studies based on a trend for lower relapses and similar low toxicity compared to lower doses. To better defi ne the outcome after FT and the role of diff erent doses, we analyzed a cohort of 216 pts with AML (n=137) or MDS (n=79) given treosulfan 12 gr/m2x3 in one institution (FT12, n=123) or 14 gr/m2x3 in a second (FT14, n=93 Allogeneic SCT is potentially curative therapy for patients (pts) with lymphoid malignancies. The combination of fl udarabine and treosulfan (FT) has been introduced over the last few years as a relatively dose-intensive, reduced toxicity regimen. It was predominantly explored in myeloid malignancies but there is only limited data in lymphoid malignancies. We studied 54 pts with diff use large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n=17), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, n=11), T-cell lymphomas (n= 12), follicular/ mantle cell lymphoma (n=9) and CLL with Richter's transformation (n=5). The median age was 53 years (range, 23-70), 31 had chemo-sensitive disease at SCT (CR-23, PR-8) and 23 were chemo-refractory (SD-7, PD-16). 33 pts had a prior autologous SCT. The donor was an HLA-matched sibling (n= 28) or unrelated (n=26). The median follow up is 13 months (range, 1-38). 12 pts had non-relapse mortality (NRM), 3 died of infections, 5 of GVHD (3 acute, 2 chronic), 4 of organ toxicities. The cumulative incidence of NRM was 27% (95%CI 16-46% were predictive of shortened PFS. In conclusion, FT is a promising preparative regimen for allogeneic SCT in pts with lymphoid malignancies. Similar to the experience in myeloid malignancies, NRM rates are reasonable, considering the relatively heavily pretreated and high-risk pt group (43% chemo-refractory, 61% with prior autologous SCT). This is also a dose intense regimen as refl ected by the relatively low relapse rate. Outcome was favorable in pts with chemosensitive disease, but a subset of pts with chemorefractory disease at SCT could also be salvaged. This regimen merits further study in larger comparative studies.",

Uppungunduri (1) The genes that code for these enzymes contain potential functional variants that may slow down elimination of Bu (GSTA1*B and CTHser403Ile), or increase the activation of Cy (via CYP2C9*1). Individually GSTA1*B and CTHser403Ile have been found to be associated with the occurrence of VOD, whereas the presence of CYP2C9*1 has shown a trend with VOD occurrence. Our objective: To investigate the occurrence of VOD in relation to these genotypes in a gene-gene interaction model. Sample and Methods: Sixty-seven children (50% males, median age 6.5yrs) receiving iv Bu/Cy based myeloablative conditioning regimen were included in this study. Ursodeoxycholic acid was provided as a prophylaxis for VOD. A TaqMan based assay was used for genotyping the chosen SNPs: GSTA1 rs3957356, CTH rs1021737 and CYP2C9 rs1799853. The occurrence of VOD at day 50 was analyzed in relation to the risk genotypes using a Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. We used the presence of GSTA1*B and CTHser403Ile in a recessive model, and the presence of CYP2C9*1 in a dominant model. Results: Incidence of VOD (Seattle criteria) was 12.1%. The MDR analysis results are shown in table 1, where the last model was chosen as the best by the MDR program. Conclusion: The MDR analysis chose the three gene variant combination, as the best model to predict VOD in children taking a Bu/ CY conditioning regimen before undergoing HSCT, thus there is a gene-gene interaction occurring between these genes. However, caution must be taken because we did not have any individuals with all three risk genotypes, thus the program inferred the risk by observing the data from the other patients which had the two risk genotype combinations. Nonetheless, these results show that either of the models shown in table 1 could be used to predict the occurrence of VOD, some with more sensitivity than others. The consequences of these predictions could give clinicians the option for providing additional prophylaxis or alternative treatments to these patients. Pesaro risk class 3 patients treated with standard protocols continue to have an increased rejection rate which could be as high as 17% to 38%. In 1997 we adopted a new treatment protocol (Pc26) for class 3 patients which lead to reduced rejection and improved DFS (Blood 2004; 104:1201) . However, our subsequent experience with Pc26 showed an elevated rejection rate in class 3 patients which prompted us to modify Pc26 to overcome this complication. A total of 48 class 3 patients with median age of 11 years (range, 5-16) were treated: 26 patients with original Pc26 and 22 with modifi ed Pc26 (Pc26m). Patients had severe iron overload with median serum ferritin of 2626 ng/mL (range, 777-10222) and liver iron concentration of 20,8 mg/g (range, 5-40.7). Median liver fi brosis score was 2 (range, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Median number of RBC transfusions was 140 units (range, 25-307). Treatment regimen involved an intensifi ed preparation with 3 mg/kg of azathioprine and 30 mg/kg hydroxyurea daily from day -45 from the transplant, fl udarabine 30 mg/m 2 from day -16 through day -12, followed by conditioning with iv busilvex, thiotepa 10 mg/kg and CY 160 mg/kg. GVHD prophylaxis was with CSA/methylprednisolone/MTX. Graft rejection occurred in 4 patients treated with Pc26 and none in patients given Pc26m with a cumulative incidence (CI) of 16% (95% CI 5%-32%) and 0% respectively (p=0.06).The probability of OS for patients treated with Pc26 and Pc26m was 85% (95% CI, 67%-94%) and 85% (95% CI 64%-94%), respectively. Respective probabilities of DFS were 73% (95% CI, 52%-88%) and 85% (95% CI 64%-94%) (p=0.52). The CI of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 46% (95% CI 26%-64%) and 28% (95% CI 11%-49%) (p=0.25) in Pc26 and Pc26m arms, respectively. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 77 months (range, 70-10) in Pc26 and 48 months (range, 1-67) in Pc26m arms. There were 4 deaths in Pc26 and 3 in Pc26m groups. Treatment protocol was well tolerated without any signifi cant toxicity. None of the patients had grade 4 toxicity. Most frequent grade 3 toxicity was AST and ALT elevations. Three patients in Pc26 and 2 in Pc26m groups had grade 2 hemorrhagic cystitis. One patient in each group had moderate liver VOD resolved with supportive care.",

ATG has no impact on OS for patient who received CSP and its use should be discussed. Autologous HSCT is a standard treatment of multiple myeloma. High-dose melphalan alone or in combination with TBI is most frequently used for conditioning. In our center we initially applied TBI (12 Gy) alone followed by melphalan monotherapy in two subsequent transplant procedures. In the current prospective trial, TBI is substituted by total marrow irradiation (TMI, total 12 Gy, 4 Gy fractions on days -3, -2, -1) applied with the use of helical tomotherapy, in order to reduce toxicity. In addition, patients are examined with FDG-PET and in case of evidence of active sites of the disease they receive additional 'boosts' (total 24 Gy, 4 Gy",

Pascal (1) Purpose: Previous studies suggested that ATG-containing myeloablative conditioning for allo-SCT from an unrelated donor resulted in decreased incidence of extensive chronic GVHD without compromising survival. However, the use of ATG incorporated within the conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic cord blood transplantation (allo-CBT) is still controversial. Patients and Methods: We report on 91 consecutive patients who underwent single-unit unrelated allo-CBT in 3 French transplantation centers (Lille, Nantes and Bordeaux) for acute leukemia (n=66, 73%), myelodysplstic syndrome (n=17, 19%) and lymphoproliferative disorders (n=8; 9%). Median age at transplant was 12 years old (range, 0.7-56). CB units were fullmatched (6/6, n=18; 20%), one-antigen mismatched (n=30, 33%) or 2-antigen mismatched (n=38; 42%). The median cell dose was 4.6 107/kg (range, 0. 5-22.2) . All patients received myeloablative conditioning including 51 with TBI. In this series, 46 received ATG ('ATG' group), whereas 45 did not ('no-ATG' group). Only patients receiving the ATG brand Thymoglobuline\u00ae (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, USA) were included because this was the only ATG brand approved in France for use in allo-SCT. In the ATG group, the drug was given at the dose of 5 mg/kg (n=27) and 7.5 mg/kg (n=15). Two patients received less than 5 mg/kg for intolerance. ATG was discontinued at a median of 5 days before transplant with a median number of 2 days of perfusion (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

RIC has reduced non-relapse mortality (NRM), but post transplant morbidity and mortality as well as disease control remain a challenge. We studied the post-HSCT outcome of older or comorbid patients with 1st complete remission acute myeloid leukemia who received a RIC with fl udarabin (Flu), busulfan(Bu) and rabbit anti-thymoglobulin (rATG Fanconi's Anemia (FA) manifests clinically with progressive development of aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for these hematological manifestations. Over the last few years there is convincing evidence supporting the use of fl udarabine based conditioning regimens in HSCT for Fanconi's Anemia patients. However, graft failure and rejection remains an important concern, especially in the setting of alternative donors and hyper transfusion. Many eff orts have been directed towards improving engraftment rate without increasing toxicity. We present our experience in HSCT for FA using fl udarabine-cyclophosphamide (Flu-Cy) based conditioning regimen with or without the addition of busulfex (Flu-Cy-Bu).

Although the number of patients treated in the Flu-Cy-Bu group is too small to draw defi nitive conclusions, the addition of Busulfex to the Flu-Cy conditioning regimen in HSCT for FA does not seem to improve engraftment, and is associated with increased treatment related mortality and possibly GVHD. Conditioning regimens used in autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) for Hodgkin's (HL) and Non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are considered equal. During the last 2 years a new conditioning regimen was constructed in our unit consisting of intravenous Busulphan (Busilvex) (9.6mg/kg), Etoposide (800mg/m 2 ) and Melphalan (140mg/m 2 ) (BuEM). We retrospectively analysed the outcome of patients (pts) who underwent AHCT following standard BEAM and BuEM regimen in our unit. The pts were stratifi ed by age, pre-transplant disease phase and previous lines of treatment. In total, 50 pts conditioned with BuEM (group A) and 93 with BEAM (group B) were included. Group B pts were selected among 184 conditioned with BEAM during the last decade. Stratifi cation by disease risk was followed by a 1:2 selection. Fifty percent of the pts were younger than 34 years old in both study groups (range 11-68). The pts of group B more likely suff ered from HL (63) than NHL (30); whereas disease diagnosis for group A was HL in 28 and NHL in 22 pts. Disease was chemoresistant to salvage treatment in 46% of group A versus (vs) 23% of group B pts. There were no other signifi cant diff erences concerning the patients' characteristics such as age above median, pretransplantation lines of treatment (1-2: 40%, 3-4: 46%, \u22655: 14%), disease status (complete remission: 27%, primary refractory:52%, relapse: 21%, advanced stage disease: 52%). Complete remission post-AHCT was obtained in 50% of group A and 56% of group B pts. Progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years and overall survival (OS) were similar among the study groups (66% vs 63% and 80% vs 78% respectively). Given the fact that there were more pts with chemoresistant disease in group A, a second matched pair analysis was conducted upon stratifi cation by disease chemosensitivity to salvage treatment instead of age as a risk factor. Effi cacy was again similar for both regimens. In multivariate analysis favorable factors in terms of PFS were HL, chemosensitivity to salvage treatment and stage <IIB whereas in terms of OS non-bulky disease, HL and stage <IIB. Treatment related mortality (TRM) was 3.2% (3/93 pts) in group B and none in group A. There are currently no randomized studies clarifying the optimal conditioning. In this study the two regimens, BEAM and BuEM, were found to be equivalent. Additionally, the effi cacy of the newly designed BEM regimen in chemoresistant and advanced stage disease is encouraging. We conclude that this retrospective study suggests that ATG can prevent graft-versus-host disease without obvious risk of relapse resulting in similar progression-free and overall survival in HLAidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation which has to be confi rmed in a randomized trial. Introduction: Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are important in the metabolism of busulfan (BU), and GST gene variants may explain some of the interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics. The present study evaluates the association between GST genotypes, BU pharmacokinetics and correlation with short-term outcome and toxicity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The study included 114 consecutive adult patients who received oral BU conditioning pre-HSCT. The two fi rst BU doses were given as fi xed doses (1 mg/kg BW), then adjusted to a target average steady state concentration (Css) of 900 ng/mL. Short term toxicity was evaluated by weight gain, increase in bilirubin and omission of methotrexate on day 6 and/or 11 as a surrogate markers for toxicity. Results: Following the fi rst dose, BU Css ranged 600-1780 ng/mL (median 1000) and 70 % of the patients presented estimated BU Css above target (median 19% higher). On the two fi rst days of therapy, BU exposure was signifi cantly diff erent between GSTA1 genotype groups (P<0.01). Patients with GSTA1*B/*B and *A/*B genotypes demonstrated median 16 % (P<0.01) and 12 % higher Css (P<0.05) and 13 % and 9 % lower clearance/bioavailability (CL/F) (P<0.05) on day 1 compared to GSTA1*A/*A patients. The total mortality rate at 30 days, 3 and 6 months post-HSCT was 8 % (9 pts), 20 % (23 pts) and 29 % (33 pts), as shown in Table 1 . The 3 month mortality was associated with higher initial busulfan levels (median 1090 vs. 980 ng/mL, P<0.05). Higher busulfan levels after the fi rst dose (>75 percentile) were associated with increased levels of toxicity markers ( The benefi cial eff ects of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) were reported to depend on the intensity of the conditioning regimen.",

From March 2005 until June 2011, 294 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) were eligible for this analysis. In patients with ATG (ATG-group), most patients received an unrelated HSCT (92%) and in patients without ATG (non-ATG-group), most patients received a related HSCT (86%). The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versushost disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were signifi cantly lower in ATG-group compared to non-ATG-group (P=0.039 and P=0.022, respectively). There was no signifi cant diff erence in terms of nonrelapse mortality, relapse, overall survival and progression-free survival. Grouped according to the intensity of the conditioning regimen (conventional myeloablative conditioning [MAC] vs reduced-toxicity conditioning [RTC] vs reduced-intensity conditioning [RIC]), the cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD were signifi cantly lower in ATG-group in addition to a MAC or a RTC, but not in addition to a RIC, which might be due to less tissue damage in RIC and thereby less auto-antigen presentation and cytokine induction as trigger of GVHD. In summary, the benefi cial eff ect of ATG as GVHD prophylaxis was preferentially seen in patients receiving a MAC or RTC. This fi nding needs further validation in prospective trials. We report the results of a retrospective analysis on 112 patients who underwent HLA-matched sibling donor RIC HSCT receiving either ATG or alemtuzumab.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the toxicity of the treatment and the resumption of the myelopoiesis in the fi rst phase, and subsequently its effi cacy. From April 2007 to March 2012 we treated 44 patients. Patients characteristics, toxicity and haematological recovery are shown on the table below. All patients received HSCs from peripheral blood with an average of 6.3 x 10 6 cells/Kg (range 3.6-14.1) and granulocyte growth factor (Filgrastim) was administered from day +6. The treatment did not cause intense nausea or vomiting, nor pulmonary, hepatic and renal toxicity. The mucositis and transfusion requirement were not high. Two patients died, one case with relapsed-resistant disease, heavily pre-treated and at high risk of infection, of sepsis at day +7, and one case with refractory disease, for its progression at day +46. The hematological resumption resulted as that of the traditional BEAM protocol. Hospital discharge was possible after 11-17 (median 13) days after the transplant. The modifi ed BEAM protocol with high dose Ara-C resulted a well tolerated treatment with no higher toxicity respect to traditional BEAM. The outcome of this conditioning regimen will be evaluated after a year since the last case treated. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) after myeloablative conditioning (MAC) can cure high-risk haematological malignancies but in older patients and those with signifi cant comorbidities it has high non-relapse mortality (NRM). In 1989, to enable patients unfi t for MAC with an otherwise dismal prognosis to benefi t from the graft-versus-tumour eff ect, we developed a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) protocol: LACE. It consists of oral lomustine 200 mg/m 2 (day -7), iv etoposide 1000 mg/m 2 (day -7), iv cytarabine 2000 mg/m 2 (days -6 and -5) and iv cyclophosphamide 1800 mg/m 2 (days -4, -3 and -2 Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains the major barrier to successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Standard prophylaxis regimens for GvHD comprise combinations of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin or tacrolimus with methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. These combination strategies are not able to prevent GvHD in a signifi cant proportion of patients. Aside from their toxic properties, continuous immunosuppression delays immune reconstitution and diminishes the desired graft-versus-tumor eff ect. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide has been used as GvHD prophylaxis in the haploidentical setting and in the context of bone marrow transplantation after myeloablative conditioning.",

Eleven patients were treated (median age 49, range 26-61 years). All patients received a RIC regimen with Fludarabin and Busulfan and T cell-replete peripheral blood stem cells followed by 50 mg/kg/d of cyclophosphamide on day 3 and 4 after transplantation (5 MRD, 4 MUD, 2 mMUD). Median engraftment occurred on day 18, 20,5 and 17 in leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets. All patients evaluable had full donor chimerism on day 28. The incidence of acute grade II-IV and grade III-IV GVHD for all patients was 45% and 27%, respectively. Non-relapse mortality at day 100 and day 365 was 18% and 45%, respectively. Overall and event-free survival at one year after transplantation was 55% and 36%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 543 days. Interim analysis after seven patients demonstrated fast T-and B-cell recovery including increased regulatory T-cell frequencies in comparison with a historical patient cohort receiving calcineurin inhibitors as GvHD prophylaxis. Updated results on immune recovery and clinical results for all eleven patients will be presented. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide can be used as single-agent GvHD prophylaxis in patients transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells and allows a fast immune recovery with respect to B-and T-cell reconstitution. Grade III-IV acute GvHD rates and NRM were comparably high for RIC transplants with the limitation of a relatively small patient number. Three out of eleven patients did not require any systemic immunosuppression until day+100 and further on.",

The myeloid engraftment and platelet engraftment were obtained at a median of 12 days (range: [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Background: the descriptions of the diff erent conditioning regimens (CxRs) for allogeneic HSCT are confusing and sometimes do not refl ect their characteristics (\"conventional'' vs. \"mini/micro\", or \"high-intensity\" vs. \"reduced-intensity\" or \"myeloablative\" vs. \"nonmyeloablative/submyeloablative\" transplants). Objective: we aimed to describe and compare the intensity of the CxRs most frequently used in our center. Methods and patients: we report the outcome of 100 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HSCT with fi ve diff erent CxRs, between 2007 and 2012 in our center. Among those patients, 51% had lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoma, multiple myeloma), 44% acute leukemias (myeloblastic or lymphoblastic) and 6% other diseases. 29% received classical intensive schemes (BuCy2, Cy-120/TBI-12, Cy-200) (group A), 50% Flu-Mel (fl udarabine: 150 mg/m 2 ; melphalan: 140 mg/m 2 ) (group B), and 21% Flu-Bu (iv) (fl udarabine: 150 mg/m 2 ; busulphan: 9-12.8 mg/m 2 ) (group C) (table). Low dose ATG (Thymoglobulin at 1.5-3.5 mg/kg) was used in the three groups. Results: microbiologically documented infections, and early acute GVHD were more frequent in group A. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more frequent and profound in group A (c/w both B and C groups), and in group B (c/w group C). Patients in group A (c/w those in both B and C), and in group B (c/w those in group C) needed more platelet transfusions. Duration of admission was longer in group A (c/w both B and C groups). Peritransplant mortality was very low in the three groups (0% in group C The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 4.3 x 106/kg/bw. Engraftment was attained in 32/33 patients, after a median of 10 days (9-11) for neutrophils >0.5x109/L and of 12 days (8-17) for platelets >20x109/L . Grade 3/4 oral mucositis was reported in 18/33 cases (54%), requiring opioids for a median of 7 days (2-10) in 15. Grade 3 nausea/vomiting and diarrhea were observed in 4/33 (12%) and 24/33 (73%) patients, respectively; total parenteral nutrition was given to 24 patients for a median of 6 days (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Twenty-two patients had fever; in 8/22 a bacteremia was documented (5 GRAM+, 1 gram-, 2 mixed). In addition, 1 candidemia and 1 cytomegalovirus reactivation were observed. The non-relapse mortality was 6% (2/33) due to neutropenic enterocolitis and cholecystitis complicated by septic shock. Currently, 30 patients are alive and progression-free after a median follow-up of 7 months (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . One patient treated with active disease progressed within two months from transplant. Our results support the feasibility of the FEAM regimen in terms of engraftment in lymphoma patients undergoing an ASCT. No pulmonary toxicity was observed, while gastrointestinal adverse events were reported in more than 70% of cases. A larger sample size and a case-control comparison with patients receiving the BEAM regimen are necessary to demonstrate that the use of FTM may be a valid therapeutic option. Background: Intensifi cation of conditioning has been attempted by adding anti-leukemic agent to the standard myeloablative regimen of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to reduce disease relapse. We have already reported a favorable outcome of allogeneic HSCT with intensifi ed conditioning consisting of TBI-cyclophosphamide (CY) plus high-dose cytarabine (HDCA) for ALL patients (Am J Hematol, 2012). In addition, we have also reported a successful outcome of TBI plus HDCA (without CY) for myeloid malignancies, in which HDCA was combined with G-CSF in order to increase the susceptibility of leukemic cells to cytarabine (Biol Blood Marrow Transplant, 2008) . This time, we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of allogeneic HSCT using a more intensifi ed conditioning consisting of TBI-CY and HDCA combined with G-CSF for high-risk myeloid malignancies. Patients and methods: Patients with myeloid malignancies (AML, CML, and MDS) who underwent allogeneic HSCT using a conditioning consisting of TBI (12 Gy), CY (120 mg/kg), and HDCA (any doses) concomitantly infused with G-CSF (5mcg/kg) at Keio University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) were selected from the institutional database. Transplant outcome was analyzed retrospectively by using database and medical records. (14), HL (7), acute leukemia (2) and CLL (2) . All patients were heavily pre-treated (16 had received an autologous transplant). Only 1 patient was in 1st complete remission (he had pneumonia and severe renal failure with dialysis during the induction therapy); 13 were in 2nd or subsequent CR, 2 in PR, and 9 in resistant or progressive disease. Mean HCT-CI was 1 (range 0-3 Background: The use of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is an important treatment option for selected patients with hematological malignancies. Hovewer, the high chemotherapy doses of conditioning regimen may determine neutropenic complications, including bacterial and fungal infections, that in rare cases can be fatal. The post-transplant administration of fi lgrastim reduced the time to neutrophil recovery and has therefore become standard practice in many institutions. Alternatively, the long-acting fi lgrastim formulation, pegfi lgrastim, can be administered as a single 6 mg dose and has a signifi cantly increased half-life, partly due to a decreased renal clearance. Patients and methods: In this study, data of 112 consecutive adult patients who received an auto-SCT between January 2009 and May 2012 and fi lgrastim (56 pts) or pegfi lgrastim (56 pts) after transplantation were retrospectively examined. Diagnoses were non Hodgkin lymphoma (40 pts), Hodgkin lymphoma (28 pts) and Multiple Myeloma (44 pts). Standard conditioning regimens (HD-Melphaln or BEAM) were used. The mean CD34+ stem cell doses infused were 4.5 and 5.1 x106/kg (p=ns) for the pegfi lgrastim and fi lgrastim group; the groups were matched for age, sex and underlying disease. Patients of the fi lgrastim group received daily subcutaneous injections of 5 mg/Kg/day starting at the day +3 after transplantation until ANC>1 x109/L; patients of the pegfi lgrastim group received a fi xed dose of 6 mg subcutaneously on day +3 post-transplantation. Results: The median time to an ANC of 0.5 x109/L was 9 and 10 days (p=0.04), respectively, in the pegfi lgrastim and fi lgrastim groups. There was no signifi cant diff erence in the platelet engraftment between the pegfi lgrastim and fi lgrastim groups (11 vs 12 days, respectively, p=ns). The median number of days with febrile neutropenia in the pegfi lgrastim group was 2 (range 1-5) versus 3(range 1-6) in the fi lgrastim group(p=0.09). There was no diff erence in the incidence of documented infections ( 23% in the pegfi lgrastim vs 25% in fi lgrastim, p=0.8). Median hospital stay ( from day 0) was 15 day for pegfi lgrastim and 16 days for the fi lgrastim group (p=0.2); there was no signifi cant diff erences in survival at day +100 or at 1 year . Conclusions: We conclude that a single injection of pegfi lgrastim administered on post-transplant day+3 shows comparable safety and effi cacy profi les to +3 daily injections of fi lgrastim.",

Introduction: antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is part of conditioning regimens for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) with the aim of reducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), due to in vivo T-cell depletion. ATG administration may be accompanied by fever, chills, headache or other side eff ects that aff ect patient's management and can cause a delay in stem cell infusion. In order to improve ATG tolerance, since November 2010 we modifi ed our fl udarabine-busulfan-ATG (FBA) conditioning for RIC transplants with the addition of 1-day rest between the last ATG administration and stem cell infusion. There were no modifi cation of drugs or GvHD prophylaxis: fi ve days of fl udarabine, two days of i.v. busulfan, and two days of ATG Thymoglobuline (5 mg/kg total dose) were administered during conditioning (FBA); in presence of a mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD), MMF was added to ciclosporinee. Aim: to analyse whether the addition of 1-day rest impacted on outcome of adult patients receiving AlloSCT after FBA conditioning with respect to previous no-rest modality, in particular acute grade 2-4 or grade 3-4 GvHD. Methods: the 1-day rest cohort (ATG-rest) was compared with a previous consecutive cohort of patients (no rest) transplanted at our center. Analysis of acute GvHD among the two groups was performed as well as of chronic GvHD, OS, PFS, NRM, relapse/ progression. Estimates were calculated at 2 years post-AlloSCT. Results : a total of 51 and 57 patients were included in ATG-rest and no-rest cohorts respectively. Ten patients received transplantation the day after the scheduled date therefore they were not included in the analysis. Follow-up was longer in the no-rest group : median 27 months (21-37) vs. 15 (11-20) , p<0.0001. No signifi cant diff erences of patients' age, diagnosis and disease status were observed whereas matched unrelated donors (MUDs) were higher in the ATG-rest group (Table 1) . No diff erence in OS, PFS, NRM, acute GvHD (grade 2-4 or 3-4) (fi gure 1) or chronic GvHD were observed (Table 1) . Unexpectedly, relapse/progression rate was lower in the ATG-rest group: HR = 0.42 (0.16-0.97, p=0.04), although disease status was not signifi cantly diff erent between the two cohorts.",

Introduction: Following haploidentical, G-CSF primed, unmanipulated BMT, donor/recipient chimerism, hematopoietic reconstitution and risk of relapse have not been described until now. Therefore, we sequentially studied molecular chimerism and its relationship with patient outcome in 56 recipients undergoing an haploidentical transplant for malignant disease. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six patients (median age 39 yrs, range 16-70) underwent an unmanipulated haplo-BMT for the following high-risk malignant diseases: AML (n=32), ALL (n=10), CML (n=2), NHL (n=3), LH (n=5), plasmacell leukemia (n=3) and dendritic-cell leukemia (n=1). According with the disease status, 32 patients in CR1 or CR2 were considered in an early stage at transplant and, 24 in advanced stage. Thirty-six out of 56 patients were prepared with a myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC), while 20 patients received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). All patients were given an identical GvHD prophylaxis. Donors were primed with G-CSF at dose of 4 mcg/Kg/d subcutaneously for 7 days. BM was infused unmanipulated at day 0. Chimerism analysis was sequentially performed by \"STR fi ngerprint\" at day +15, +30, +60, +100, +180 and +360 after transplant. Results: Sequential molecular monitoring results are summarized in table below: * Subsequent Relapse Disease relapse occurred in 8 patients conditioned with MAC (n=5) or RIC (n=3), 7 out of these 8 patients were in advanced phase at time of transplant. Along the early or late follow-up, MC preceeded relapse in all patients. Moreover, 9 patients transplanted in advanced phase are currently surviving disease free and show a persistent CC at >2 years after transplant. Conclusion: haploidentical, unmanipulated, G-CSF primed BMT following either MAC or RIC regimen provides an high rate of engraftment with hematopietic reconstitution of donor origen. MC seems to be predictive for disease relapse and the molecular chimerism monitoring could be helpful in driving post-tansplant therapy in order to prevent overt disease recurrence.",

To determine whether any additional information could be obtained by more sensitive testing, we performed parallel STR-PCR and Abbott AlleleSEQR chimerism assays in 109 DNA-samples. The serial samples were collected from 11 AML/MDS -patients, starting from 3-4 weeks after transplantation. (range 90,50%-99,99%). The results suggest that alleleSEQR-PCR is more sensitive than STR-PCR in detection of recipient derived cells. The high sensitivity of the microchimerism assay allows the detection of very low amounts of recipient derived cells also from peripheral blood and thus a separate isolation of CD34-positive precursor cells from bone marrow may become unnecessary for exlusion of eventual relapse development.

The aim of our study is to analyze the usefulness of this method for prediction of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) in patients after allotransplantation with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Materials and methods: We evaluated early hematopoietic chimerism in 15 patients after RIC allografted for haematological malignancies from fully HLA-matched not-related (12) or sibling (3) donors. Blood samples were collected from donors and recipients prior to transplantation (Tx) and from the recipients on days +5, +10, +15, +30, +60 and +100 after Tx. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated on density gradient (Lymphofl ot, Biotest) and cascade separated into CD56 Pan T Cell Isolation Kit II CD4 CD8 using monoclonal antibodies (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). DNA from cells was extracted automatically (Nuclisens easyMag, Biomerieux) and investigated by RQ-PCR TaqMan technology, on ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Chimerism was based on the analysis of two specifi c markers -one for donor and one for recipient, chosen out of 33 insertion/deletion or null alleles. The sensitivity of each RQ-PCR performed with artifi cial chimeric DNA samples was 0.05%. Results: Clinical symptoms of cGvHD was observed in 3/15 patients. The level of donor chimerism on the day 5th and 10th after transplantation in recipients who developed cGvHD was signifi cantly higher than in patients with no cGvHD. This diff erence was observed in all cell lineages (Figure) .The donor chimerism >97% on the 10th day after transplantation in CD4+ was the best predictor of the cGVHD: it was observed in 3/3 patients with cGvHD and in none of 12 patients with no cGVHD (p< 0.007).",

Introduction: Although the origin of circulating cell-free nucleic acids in plasma is unknown, cell disruption is the most likely explanation. In this context, our goal was to quantitatively monitor chimerism in cell-free plasma DNA and to evaluate its usefulness for the improved diagnosis of complications after allo-SCT. Patients and methods: The study comprised 270 plasma samples from 29 allo-SCT patients, with a median follow up of 45,8 months (14,6-74,7). Plasma was separated from blood cells by centrifugation at 1600g for 10 min at 4\u00baC and cell-free plasma DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative chimerism analysis was performed by microsatellite PCR (STR; AmpFlSTR SGM plus, Applied Biosystems) in whole blood (WB), T-cells (CD3+) purifi ed using immunomagnetic means (Miltenyi Biotec) and cell-free plasma DNA. Results: During the fi rst year of allo-SCT, the number of patients with mixed chimerism (MC) in cell-free plasma DNA was higher than that in WB and T-cells (Table 1 ). MC in cell-free plasma DNA was observed for a longer time after transplant than \"cellular\" MC, with a median of 105 vs. 40 and 27 days for cell-free plasma DNA, T-cells and WB, respectively. Chimerism analysis revealed two groups of patients. One group with MC in both cell-free plasma DNA and \"cellular DNA\", in which the percentage of recipient plasma DNA ranged between 10-30%, probably mostly derived from hematopoietic cells. The other group presented MC in cellfree plasma DNA but complete \"cellular\" chimerism (100% donor) in which cells the percentage of recipient plasma DNA was lower than in the former group (1-10%), and most probably derived from non-hematopoietic cells. A greater number of patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD), mainly acute but also chronic, presented MC in cell-free plasma DNA and complete chimerism in WB and T-cells ( Table 2 ). The presence of recipient cell-free plasma DNA could be derived by cell disruption in GVHD target organs. Discussion: Quantitative follow-up of chimerism in cell-free plasma DNA, does not reproduce the results of \"cellular\" chimerism, as reported previously, and therefore, could not replace it for post-SCT follow-up. On the other hand, chimerism analysis in cell-free plasma DNA could be combined with the conventional follow-up of \"cellular\" chimerism for an improved diagnosis of lifethreatening complications such as acute and chronic GVHD.",

To detect the patients who are at risk of leukemia relapse is vital to detect residual leukemia in the form of minimal residual disease (MRD).

In 13 patients with MC both mutations were found at the same time of MC, while one patient with MC only a NPM1 mutation was detected at relapse. Six patients with increasing MC did not show NPM1 or FLT3-ITD mutation at any time and these patients did not showed any sign of relapse. Two patients in remission showed complete donor chimerism and were negative for FLT3-ITD and NPM1. Correlation coeffi cient of chimerism percentage between singleplex and multiplex PCR was 0.98, while the correlation coeffi cient for FLT3-ITD mutated/unmutated ratio was 0.89 for both PCR systems. Our one step assay provides clinical applicability in patients with MC for rapid simultaneous detection of chimerism status, NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutation in AML patients undergoing HSCT. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Relapse after alloSCT is still a major cause for the treatment failure. Molecular genetic (FLT3, NPM1 mutations) and cytogenetic riskcategories have an important impact on the prognosis of patients undergoing alloSCT. However, it has been shown that there is a closely relationship between the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) and relapse in leukemia patients. We analyzed 165 AML patients transplanted at our institution. We examined the contribution of cytogenetic aberrations and molecular genetic markers detected prior alloSCT to survival, relapse, and mortality after transplantation. Furthermore, we analysed MRD status after consolidation therapy and in post-transplant period. We classifi ed genetic/cytogenetic status before alloSCT into 2 groups: low risk: good and intermediate-risk karyotype, FLT3-wt, NPM1-mutated cases and high risk: adverse-risk cytogenetic, FLT3-ITD mutated cases. A low risk karyotype was present in 75 patients, whereas 90 patients had a poor cytogenetic risk. 66 patients were treated with standard myeloablative conditioning regiments prior to alloSCT, 83 patients received reduced intensity conditioning and 16 non-myeloablative conditioning. 51 patients had a matchedrelated donor and 114 patients had a matched-unrelated donor.",

Several methods have been described to determine the level of chimerism. In this research we report results from chimerism analysis by a SyberGreen qRT-PCR based method comparing it to VNTR and STR. Material and methods: 88 patients/donors pairs who underwent HLA related or unrelated allogeneic myeloablative and nonmyeloablative hSCT from two diff erent institutions in S\u00e3o Paulo, SP/Brazil were selected. The National Information System for Ethics and Research with Human Beings -SISNEP had approved the study. Clinical data was collected from each patient's fi le by accessing it manually or electronically. Two VNTR loci APO-B and D1S80, two multiplex amplifi cation systems, AmpFlSTR\u00ae SGM Plus\u00ae and AmpFlSTR\u00ae Identifi ler\u00ae Plus (Applied Biosystems) and eight SNPs were selected. In order to identify informative alleles, all recipient pre-hSCT samples and donors were screened for every marker as previously described. A marker was considered informative when it had a diff erent allele for recipient and donor, either in homozygous or heterozygous state. Chimerism was then determined in samples collected from recipients at diff erent times after the hSCT. VNTR analysis provided a qualitative determination of the type of chimerism. For STR and SNP analysis, Mixed Chimerism (MC) was defi ned as the detection of up to 95% of donor cells, whereas Complete Chimerism (CC) was defi ned as the detection of less than 5% of autologous cells. Results and conclusions: In general, CC and MC were detected by all three techniques, however, STR and SNP/qRT-PCR showed to be more powerful in discriminating donor/recipient cells. STR and SNP have the highest level of informativity, 84.09% and 81.82% respectively; combined, STR and SNP showed 98% sensitivity, STR/VNTR showed 92%, while the 3 techniques together, showed 90%. In summary, VNTR may be a reliable and cheap, but limited source for chimerism analysis. STRs, still the Gold Standard however requires specialized and expensive equipment. SNPs with a SybrGreen qRT-PCR based technique has become a reliable, sensitive, fast and less expensive alternative. Obviously there are limitations common to all three, including DNA quality and quantity, number of markers and individual level of informativity. However, with good DNA quality and quantity and a very polymorphic platform of high informative markers success can be attained.",

Many studies have been performed to determine the role of WT1 in haematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Despite the large number of studies, the results still remain controversial. WT1 expression was repeatedly proved to be a strong prognostic factor as well as a marker for minimal residual disease (MRD). However, other studies did not confi rm these results. Apart from the initial level of WT1, there is a growing number of papers showing the relevance of WT1 expression level before stem cell transplantation (SCT) and also during the follow up of transplanted patients. Methods: To investigate WT1 expression pattern of these patients, we analyzed bone marrow samples (BM) of 20 children with de novo AML, who underwent SCT. WT1 mRNA level was determined at the time points of diagnosis, pre/post SCT and also at relapse. In majority of the patients (N=15), the follow up samples from various time points during the treatment were available as well. RQ-PCR assay for absolute quantifi cation of total WT1 was designed according to Europe Against Cancer Program recommendations. To defi ne the normal level of WT1 expression, the samples of normal (N=23) and regenerating (N=30) MRD-negative BM were used as controls. Results and Conclusion: We found that the initial WT1 level is similar to the level detected at relapse (median 3.4 and 3.2 logs respectively). During the follow up, the WT1 expression in remission samples remains below the physiological background of healthy donors. We analysed possible correlation between the pre-and post-SCT levels of WT1 expression and the survival of patients. There was no statistical diff erence in WT1 pre-and post-SCT levels in a group of patients who subsequently relapsed compared to those who remained in complete remission. Analysis of WT1 expression in follow up samples confi rmed that WT1 level is upregulated at relapse. However, in 4 out of 5 patients who relapsed after SCT, the samples preceding the haematological relapse showed WT1 expression similar to the normal BM. Therefore due to rather infrequent BM aspirations during the follow up of the patients, WT1 monitoring in childhood AML undergoing SCT is unlikely to bring any benefi t for the treatment of these patients.

In cases, in which no specifi c tumour marker is available, a multiplex PCR-based approach using sets of short tandem repeats (STRs) currently serves as standard method for chimerism analysis. Although STRs show high power of discrimination between donor and recipient this method provides limited sensitivity that does not reach below 1%. Real time PCR (qPCR) is known to be a more sensitive approach for the quantifi cation of minimal residue disease (MRD) and the early detection of imminent relapse. However some drawbacks exist to use this approach within clinical routine especially in high percentage donor chimerism analysis. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of an established highly informative STR-multiplex application with a new developed approach using allele-specifi c qPCR assays detecting insertion/deletion polymorphisms (INDELs). The INDEL-assay thereby consists of a multiplex-approach targeting 44 INDELs and respective allele-specifi c qPCR assays. Genomic DNA was genotyped by using a 12 STR-PCR assay and the newly developed 44-INDEL assay, respectively. STR-PCR and INDEL-qPCR analysis were performed using serial dilutions of mixed DNAs simulating chimerism. STR-PCR results were compared with allele-specifi c qPCR results towards informativity, sensitivity and linearity of both methods. To simplify the application of this combined strategy in chimerism analysis a software tool for data evaluation was established. The presented work demonstrates the benefi ts and suitability of insertion/deletion loci but also points out that an optimal application range has to be applied. The combined approach of fi rst line multiplex STR analysis to monitoring engraftment in conjunction with subsequent allele-specifi c qPCR analysis for highly quantitative chimerism analysis provides the best strategy of reliable monitoring of post-transplant progress of allogeneic HSCT. Objective: The aim of our study was to develop methods for determining minimal residual disease (MRD) for patients with acute S248 leukemia, using deletions in gene IKZF1 (transcription factor IKAROS) as a marker. Methods: The presence of deletions \u03b4 2-7 and \u03b4 4-7 IKZF1 was examined in 95 patients with acute leukemia (AML -26, ALL -64, biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) -5) at diff erent stages of disease. Locus-specifi c primers and TaqMan probes for real-time PCR were designed to quantify deletions \u03b4 2-7 and \u03b4 4-7 mutIKZF1. Results: The frequency of deletions IKZF1 in the general population of patients with acute leukemia was 11% (n=10), and in patients with ALL, 12% (n=8) . But, at the same time, deletions were detected for 31% (5 of 16) of patients with Ph-positive ALL. Two patients with BAL had a deletion in the IKZF1 gene. Within the group of patients with AML and healthy volunteers the abovementioned mutations were not detected. IKZF1 mutations were found in the group of patients with detected chromosomal aberrations as well as in patients with normal karyotype tumor cells. The IKZF1 gene deletion was not detected in patients at molecular remission. At the same time the number of cells with deletion proportionally increased data on other markers: cytogenetic and molecular (defi nition of the chimeric transcripts) at relapse. We found out a correlation between mutIKZF1 amplifi cation and a number of blasts (R=0.62, p=0.017), chimeric transcripts level (R=0.91, p=0.000001) and donor chimerism (R= -0.63, p=0.02). The sensitivity of mutIKZF1 detection is less then chimeric transcripts level measurement (88%), but the specifi city was observed the same (100%). Conclusions: Deletions in the gene IKZF1 can be used as a marker for evaluation of minimal residual disease in patients with ALL without other informative molecular markers.",

Furthermore, development of acute-graft-vs.-host disease (aGvHD) and blood stream infection (BSI) was signifi cantly more prevalent in the DC patient group. Lastly, fl uctuations in the recipient: donor chimerism ratio decreased over time after HSCT in MC patients. Discussion: A young donor presumably has more na\u00efve immune cells, which might lead to a state of clinical tolerance between donor and recipient cells in the patient, as substantiated by the fact that aGvHD was primarily observed in the DC group. Also, sibling donor cells are a closer HLA and minor histocompatibility antigen match than unrelated donor cells and as thus will be less prone to induce immune-mediated killing of recipient cells. In this study, younger donor age and sibling donor were correlated, as the sibling donors were signifi cantly younger. Additionally, milder conditioning regimens may also stimulate MC development. Furthermore, MC was not linked to a worse prognosis, as both aGvHD and BSI development were more prevalent in the DC group. BSI might be increased in DC patients due to newly developing immune cells that still require priming, while MC patients maintain their recipient memory cells for immediate targeted responses.",

Over the last 6 years our policy was to off er second SCT from a diff erent donor to pts who had an available second donor and were in relatively good medical status, most often after re-induction attempt. 129 AML/ MDS pts relapsed after SCT during this period and 26 (20%) were able to proceed to second SCT from diff erent donor. The median age was 51 years (19-78). 20 pts were initially given SCT from matched sibling, 12 were re-transplanted from a second sibling and 8 from matched unrelated donor (MUD). 6 pts were initially transplanted from MUD and re-transplanted from a different MUD. The initial conditioning regimen was myeloablative (MAC, n=10), reduced-toxicity (RTC, n=12) or reduced-intensity (n=4). The second regimen was most often fl udarabine and treosulfan (FT, n=15) for those not given treosulfan before, including all prior MAC recipients. Other regimens were fl udarabine and busulfan (n=7) or FLAMSA (n=4). The median time from fi rst SCT to relapse was 12 months (2 months -9 years), 7 within 6 months. 10 pts were in remission at second SCT with prior therapy, 9 were chemo-refractory, 7 were re-transplanted with no re-induction attempt. Median follow-up is 14 months . 24 pts engrafted in a median of 13 days (9-26). 2 pts died early from infections and 2 from GVHD with 2-year cumulative incidence of NRM of 16%(95%CI, 6-38). 13 pts relapsed after second SCT, 2-year cumulative incidence 52%(95%CI, 34-77), 10 of them died. The estimated 2-year OS and disease-free survival is 37% (95%CI, 14-60) and 33%(95%CI, 13-53), respectively. Pts re-transplanted in chemo-sensitive or untreated relapse had a better outcome than those with chemo-refractory relapse, 2 year OS 49% and 17%, respectively (p=0.05). Pts given FT for second SCT also fared better than the other regimens, 2-year OS 65% and 18%, respectively (p=0.01). 3 of 7 pts with relapse less than 6 months after SCT are long-term survivors after second SCT. In conclusion, second SCT from a diff erent donor is feasible in a subset of pts with AML/ MDS relapsing after SCT. Toxicity with the new RTC regimens, such as FT is acceptable. This is a promising option for pts able to be successfully re-induced or re-transplanted early with a pre-identifi ed second donor. These observations merit further confi rmation in larger studies.

In MVA, these results were confi rmed only for the allo-SCT -relapse interval and cGVHD in terms of OS and cGVHD for PFS. Conclusion: We report very encouraging long-term survival in non-CML pts of 30% in such unfavorable prognostic group of pts relapsed after allo-SCT with acceptable toxicity. Signifi cantly better survival was observed in patients with cGVHD after DLI. Comparable results using DLI from unrelated and even mismatched donors are also encouraging and suggest the possibility of a wider use of the potential of adoptive immunotherapy in highrisk patients. (1) We found that two SNPs in donor side: NKG2D (rs1049174 G/C) and CTLA-4 CT60 A/G (rs3087243), and one SNP in patient side: Fas -670 C/T (rs1800682), signifi cantly infl uenced the risk of relapse post-HSCT. (2) In 94 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), more than half (58.3%) of patients receiving grafts from donors with the CTLA-4 CT60 variant genotype (AA) experienced relapse, but the incidence decreased to 22.4% in those receiving grafts from donors with the CTLA-4 CT60 wild-type allele (P=0.011). AML patients with the Fas -670 homogeneous variant allele (TT genotype) had a higher incidence of relapse compared with those with the wild-type allele (CC or CT genotype) (TT: 43.9% vs. CC/CT: 16.7%, P= 0.02). However, the eff ects of CTLA-4 CT60 and Fas -670 polymorphic futures were highly signifi cant in AML but did not show any trend in ALL patients.",

Conclusions: Our fi ndings are the fi rst report of genetic variations in GVL reaction pathways and relapse risk. Transplant patients would benefi t from accurate risk assessment taking into account donor and patient genetic data, as well as other risk factors. Background: The prognosis of patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is poor. We postulated that after initial control of the leukemic cells by chemotherapy, rapid induction of a profound alloimmune response is essential for long-term control of the disease. We therefore explored a treatment strategy consisting of robust cytoreduction, followed by increasing doses of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in the neutropenic phase after chemotherapy, boosted by interferon-\u03b1 (IFN) administration, until graft versus host disease (GvHD) developed, with subsequent gradual control of GvHD. Study Design: 44 subsequent patients with relapsed AML after alloSCT were evaluated. Patients with poor performance status (n=3) or presence of severe GvHD (n=4) at the time of relapse received palliative treatment only. 5 patients with smoldering relapses received DLI without prior cytoreductive treatment. 32 patients received remission induction chemotherapy, followed by DLI at 3 weeks after the start of treatment. Reasons for not receiving DLI were chemotherapy-related death (n=1) and chemotherapyrefractory disease (n=9). Additional IFN was to be administered in case no acute GvHD occurred within 3 weeks after DLI. Results: Median follow-up of surviving patients was 63 months (range 24-128 months). Estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 23% (95%CI 10-35%) and 36% (95% CI 16-57%) after re-induction treatment and DLI. In all patients receiving DLI, the impact of acute GvHD on survival was calculated with a Cox regression model, including onset of acute GvHD as a time-dependent variable (table 1). Development of grade 1-3 acute GvHD (but not grade 4 acute GvHD) was associated with superior OS as compared to absence of acute GvHD (hazard ratio 0.22, p=0.03). Conclusions: In conclusion, effi cient cytoreduction followed by DLI during the neutropenic phase and subsequent interferon treatment if needed to induce a profound immune response represents a potentially curative option for relapsed AML after alloSCT. The induction of a graft versus leukemia eff ect as indicated by the presence of grade 1-3 acute GvHD is correlated with long-term survival.",

Immunotherapy in the form of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) is capable of restoring long-term remission in many relapsed patients, but the key question of whether this is achieved this by a single attack capable of eradicating the small number of residual leukaemic cells or whether the eff ect of these lymphocytes persists and generate a sustained attack on the residual clonal cell remains unanswered.",

We examined the patterns of transcript variation in 116 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who had received DLI for relapse following sibling (n=51) or unrelated donor (n=65) HSCT. Patients achieving complete molecular remission (defi ned by two consecutive negative BCR-ABL1 PCRs) were allocated to one of three groups based on transcript patterns which have previously been shown to predict the probability of relapse following HSCT; persistently negative (no more than 1 positive result), intermittently positive (multiple positive result, but never more than 2 consecutive positive results) and persistently positive (more than 2 consecutive positive results). The primary endpoint was relapse defi ned by existing criteria. Following DLI, 84 (72%) patients achieved CMR. Of these 84 patients 69 (82%) subsequently developed intermittently (n=34) or persistently (n=35) detectable transcripts at low levels. Despite these high numbers of patients developing low-level detectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts indicative of residual low-level disease, the probability of molecular relapse was exceptionally low (6.7% at 10 years) and not signifi cantly diff erent between the groups (0%, 4.2% and 10% for persistently negative, intermittently positive and persistently positive respectively (p=0.37). Form this data we conclude that immune manipulation with DLI produces long-term remission by exerting sustained suppression of malignant cells without eradicating the disease. However results should be taken with caution due to the low number of patients in the low risk and very high risk groups and to the retrospective nature of the study. The disease risk index is an easy and feasible prognostic score for HSCT and may help identify patients that would benefi t from TDEP.",

A second allograft is an accepted therapy, and use of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has lessened transplantrelated mortality (TRM). However, factors infl uencing outcome have yet to be clearly defi ned. Methods: The BSBMT analyzed 132 patients receiving a second allograft as treatment for relapse. Patients were identifi ed from the BSBMT Data Registry and transplant centres provided follow up data. Results: The median time between transplants was 23 months (range 1m-16y). The median age of patients was 25 (range 1-64); 66% were adults (\u226518). The diagnosis was acute leukaemia in 55%. Conditioning for the second allograft was RIC in 69% (compared to 31% at prior transplant). In-vivo T-cell depletion was used in in 36%. The donor was a sibling (46%), unrelated donor (52%) or other relative (2%); in 63% the same donor was used. The stem cell source was peripheral blood (PB) (74%), bone marrow (18%), BM+PB (6%), cord (1%) and cord+PB (1%) (compared to 46%, 50%, 1%, 3% and 0% respectively at prior allograft). 47% were transplanted in complete remission and stable engraftment occurred in 95%. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were 38% and 29% respectively at 5 years. TRM was 22%. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with worse OS included <1 year between allografts (HR=2.39, p=-0.0005), use of nonsibling donor (HR=1.73, p=0.017) and adult patients (HR=1.68, p=0.036). Factors associated with worse PFS again included <1 year between allografts (HR=1.78, p=0.017) and adult patients (HR=1.78, p=0.021). Absent or grade I acute graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) was associated with worse progression free survival (HR=1.59, p=0.047) but had no impact on OS. There was no eff ect of chronic GvHD or stem cell source on patient outcome, and no other factors tested were signifi cant. Conclusion: A second allograft is an eff ective treatment for patients with relapsed malignant disease, and nearly half of those transplanted more than 1 year following their initial allograft can expect to be alive in 5 years. Whilst outcomes are better in children and those with sibling donors, nearly a third of adult patients and those with unrelated donors can achieve long-term survival. Contrary to earlier studies, we did not fi nd an association between chronic GvHD and OS, although higher grades of acute GvHD improved PFS.",

Little has been investigated on prognostic impact by residual disease (RD) status detected by fl ow cytometry. Materials & Methods: 120 consecutive adult patients, 86 AML and 32 ALL and 2 acute biphenotype leukemia, receiving allogeneic SCT between Jan. 2010 and Dec. 2012 were included in this study. Multidimensional fl ow cytometry were analyzed on bone marrow aspirates before conditioning therapy (pre-SCT) and at hemogram recovery after transplant (post-SCT). RD was defi ned as any level of blasts population with deviation from normal antigen expression patterns. Results: Before SCT, 68 patients were RD-negative (RD-) and 52 RD-positive (RD+), while at post-SCT evaluation, only 13 patients remained RD+. After a median follow-up time of 20 months (range, 0 -34 months), patients of pre-SCT RD-had a signifi cantly better overall survival (OS) than those of pre-SCT RD+ (median, not reached vs 6 months, P < 0.001). Similarly, OS was superior in post-SCT RD-group than post-SCT RD+ group (median, 26 months vs 3 months, P < 0.001) (Fig 1) . Cumulative incidence of clinical relapse at one-year was 36.2% in patients with negative RD both before and after SCT, and was 89.7% in patients with persistent RD status (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that presence of RD pre-SCT remains an independent poor risk factor for OS (hazard ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.3-10.7; P < 0.001) ( Table 1) . Conclusion: These data suggests that detection of RD may identify poor risk SCT patients and this fi nding needs to be confi rmed with more patients enrollment and longer follow-up. Preemptive intervention before clinical relapse may be benefi cial to improve transplant outcome.",

In such situations, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a potential curative option in which the graft-versuslymphoma (GvL) eff ect can lead to immune mediated sustained tumor control. However, in the early phase after alloSCT, the risk of relapse is increased due to attenuated immune cell activity. In this situation, conventional systemic cytotoxic therapies are usually associated with a high mortality. We hypothesized that treatment with brentuximab vedotin, a new anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate, would be a promising approach for relapsed HL after alloSCT as it selectively targets lymphoma cells and might enhance a GvL response by immunogenic cell death. Moreover, the combination with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) could further increase the GvL eff ect. Four patients with relapsed HL after alloSCT were consecutively treated with brentuximab vedotin and DLI in an alternating regimen. All patients were included into a named-patient-program (Millenium) and gave their written consent. Blood collections and assessments were approved by the institutional review board. Evaluation of treatment response was performed clinically and with computed tomography scans following established criteria. Moreover, metabolic changes were analyzed by FDG-PET/CT scans. To assess the induction of a GvL eff ect, we developed an in-vitro method using co-cultures of patient PBMCs (pre and post treatment) and well characterized CD30+ HL cell lines and controls as surrogate targets.",

In contrast, a signifi cant increase of HL specifi c T cell activation could be observed in-vitro in all patients after treatment (Fig 1) . Reactive HL specifi c T cells mainly co-expressed CD161 and CD4 suggesting a TH17 like phenotype. Taken together, we present evidence that CD30-targeted therapy with brentuximab vedotin and DLI induces sustained clinical responses and tumor specifi c immunity in HL patients in an allogeneic setting which warrants further investigation in a larger population. Relapse is the major cause of death after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for haematological malignancies and can be treated with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Initial low dose DLI followed by escalating DLI doses have been used to minimize the risk of GVHD in patients with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The impact of initial CD3+ cell dose on outcome after DLI in patients treated for other haematological malignancies is limited. We retrospectively analyzed data of 70 patients with relapsed haematological malignancies after HCT treated with DLI over the last 20 years.

Twenty patients received escalating doses of CD3+ cells. Twenty-three (49%) patients are still alive with a median Overall Survival (OS) of 15 months (range, 0.6-210) after DLI.

Additionally, molecular monitoring of patients is warranted to allow the use of DLI at an early relapse stage.",

AZA was given SC at 75mg/m2/d for 7 days per cycle. Grade III-IV toxicities were observed in 32% of cases. AZA had to be discontinued due to toxicity in 8 pts. 35% of the pts had to be readmitted to hospital due to complications of AZA. These fi ndings suggest that AZA might be a potentially eff ective strategy for relapse of high risk myeloid malignancies post allo-HSCT, without unexpected toxicities or de novo GVHD. Prospective studies, but also pre-emptive strategies using AZA are needed in such high risk diseases. Nineteen and 27 pts received myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning respectively. The indications for DLI were relapse of lymphoma in 7 pts, ALL -25 pts and disease progression -14 pts. Chimerism at the time of DLI was lower than 50% of donor in 20 pts. The median number of DLI was 2 per patient (range 1-6). Total cell dose ranged from 1x10 5 to 3,3x10 8 (median 5x10 6 ) CD3+/kg. Ten pts received DLI alone, and 36 pts received DLI in combination with chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, IFN-\u03b1, IL-2, GM-CSF. Results: CR was achieved in 14 pts (30%): 10 pts (34%) with ALL, 1 pts (14%) with HD, and 3 pts (30%) with NHL. Duration of response ranged from 1 to 36 months. Relapse occurred in 8 pts (ALL -5, NHL -3) with CR after 3-12 (median 9,5) months. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grade III-IV occurred in 4 pts, and in 2 pts it was fatal. Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 4 pts. For all pts fi ve-yr OS was 21%. At the time of follow-up 12 pts are alive, including 7 in CR. Conclusions: Using DLI may help to achieve CR in pts with lymphoid malignances who relapse or have disease progression after allo-HSCT, however CR is not durable. Thus new treatment approaches in patients with lymphoid malignances still need to be investigated. ",

We retrospectively studied the effi cacy of TKIs in 7 patients [men/women: 4/3, median age=45y (22-60)] with Ph(+) Leukemias (ALL:5/CML:2), who relapsed after Allo-HSCT (median time=6m, 2-20). All had received TKIs (1st generation: 5, 1st+2nd generation: 2) and the 5 Ph(+) ALL subjects, TKIs plus chemotherapy. At transplantation, 3 patients were in complete molecular remission (CMR) and 4 in hematologic and cytogenetic remission but with detectable molecular load. Grade I acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) `developed in 4/7 patients and at the time of relapse, 5 patients had limited chronic GVHD for which they were receiving immunosuppression as prophylaxis. Disease recurrence appeared as hematologic, molecular (confi rmed in 2 consecutive samples) or extramedullary (CNS) relapse in 3/2/2 cases, respectively. The immunosuppression was discontinued and they were treated with TKIs either as a single agent (4/7) or in combination with chemotherapy (CNS infi ltration: 2, hematologic relapse: 1). All patients in hematologic or molecular relapse responded to TKIs, with a median response time 25 m (9-74). Patients with molecular relapse maintain CMR long term (74 m and 36 m), while hematologically relapsed patients relapsed again. The patients with CNS disease died 10 m and 3 m after relapse due to refractory disease and suicide, respectively. The remaining 5 patients are alive, 2 in CMR and 3 under TKIs in combination with chemotherapy, and without GVHD, despite discontinuation of immunosuppression. In conclusion, TKIs may represent a safe and eff ective option for the treatment of relapsed Ph(+) Leukemia after Allo-HSCT, particularly when they are administered at early stages of relapse. The latter, underlines the importance of close molecular monitoring for early detection of minimal residual disease. TKIs may provide durable responses without negatively impact the quality of life due to the outpatient administration. However, issues that need further investigation on the role of TKIs in the post-transplant relapse are, the duration of treatment, possible combinations with other therapeutic approaches (chemotherapy, DLIs), any potential impact on GVHD and the probability of the induction of extramedullary disease. Objectives: Parenchyma and stroma represent in every organ of the body the functional and structural units, respectively. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) -traditionally associated with a structural support activity -have recently been attributed with more complex functions. In particular, MSC regulate self-renewal and diff erentiation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and, in conjunction with bone marrow (BM) macrophages, modulate their mobilization. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of MSC to drive HSC diff erentiation in an in vitro co-culture model. Materials and methods: Unfractionated BM cells or sorted progenitor cells were co-cultured with MSC derived from BM of wild-type (WT), inducible nitric oxide synthase knock-out (NOS2-/-) and TNF receptor 1 and 2 knock-out (TNFR1/R2-/-) mice for four days. Expression of CD11b and Gr-1, and of monocyte and macrophage markers was evaluated by FACS analysis of cell suspensions collected. Real time PCR (RT-PCR) profi le of M1 and M2 markers was carried out on CD11b+ cells isolated from the co-cultures, using BM cultured alone as control.",

Based on the diff erential expression of CD11b and Gr-1, three cell subsets recapitulating myeloid diff erentiation could be identifi ed. We observed that MSC induced diff erentiation targeted common myeloid progenitors (CMP) or granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP), but not the primitive HSC. CD11b+ sorted cells obtained at the end of the co-culture exhibited a functional profi le characterised by high levels of both anti-and pro-infl ammatory markers, such as Arginase-1 (Arg-1) and NOS2. Macrophage diff erentiation was dependent on the presence of NOS2, because MSC obtained from the BM of NOS2 defi cient mice could induce the diff erentiation of other myeloid cells but not macrophages. TNF-\u03b1 but not IFN-\u03b3 was able to drive NOS2 upregulation in MSC. This was confi rmed by the lack of diff erentiation when MSC were defi cient for TNF receptor 1 and 2 (TNFR1/R2-/-). Conclusions: MSC have the ability to drive myeloid diff erentiation via a NOS2-and TNFR-dependent pathway. Background: Inherited as well as acquired mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are considered relevant in both, aging and cancer. Little is known about mutations within the respiratory chain region and its infl uence on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of hematopoietic cells during aging. Here, we used conplastic mouse strains to investigate whether mtDNA within the complexes III and IV of the RC infl uence hematopoiesis during aging. Methods: Bone marrow cells (BMCs) and peripheral blood cells of two conplastic mouse strains (C57BL/6N-mt129S1/Svlmj (mt129S1) and C57BL/6N-mtNOD/LtJ (mtNOD)) with specifi c mtDNA mutations in complex III and IV of the RC were analyzed at defi ned ages (3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months) . The background strain (C57BL/6Ntac (B6)) served as control. White blood count (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HTC) and platelets (PLT) were studied. Furthermore, Lin-, Sca-1+, c-Kit+ population (LSK cells), CD3, CD45R, Ter119 and CD11b were immunophenotyped by fl ow cytometry. Additionally, BM histologies were analyzed at all defi ned ages. Studies were accompanied by analyses of intracellular ROS, mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) as well as aging related protein analyses (western blot). Results: WBC of mutated mtDNA strains decreased during aging compared to 3 months values of the same strain. In contrast, the WBC of B6 mice remained unchanged. Similarly, HTC and HGB of the mutated strains decreased over time. PLTs counts did not change signifi cantly over time. BM of all mice strains showed hypercellularity at 12 months. The LSK cell population increased from 3 to 12 months in all strains, but LSK cell frequency of mt129S1 (2.3%) and mtNOD (2.9%) was lower than in B6 (3.8%) mice at 12 months. Of interest, CD3 cell frequency increased in mt129S1 and mtNOD over time, whereas its frequency in B6 remained unchanged. In contrast, CD45R cells decreased in both mutated strains as well as the B6 control. Preliminary results of ROS production and protein phosphorylation indicate a heterogeneous pattern with diff erences varying between strains and time points. Conclusion: MtDNA mutations in complex III and IV infl uence murine hematopoiesis during aging. In particular, erythropoiesis, B-cell lymphopoiesis as well as WBC are narrowed compared to the control group. Further investigations are warranted.",

Our aim is to investigate the interactions of MSC and lymphoid cells during the infl ammatory response in vivo using established mouse models of acute and chronic peritonitis. Materials and methods: thioglycollate(TG)-induced peritonitis (acute model; mice received one dose of TG i.p.) and chlorhexidine gluconate(CG)-induced peritoneal fi brosis (chronic model; mice received 3 doses of CG/week for 3 weeks). Following the induction of acute or chronic peritoneal infl ammation, bone marrow-or adipose tissue-derived MSC were injected into the peritoneal cavity and the infl ux of infl ammatory cells into the peritoneum, their phenotype and cytokine profi le analysed by fl ow cytometry and mRNA expression. Results: In TG-induced infl ammation, MSC led to a remarkable reduction of the infl ammatory response, as measured by total number of cells mobilized into the peritoneal cavity. MSC inhibited both the initial neutrophil infi ltration and the later monocytes/ macrophage accumulation. As a result of MSC administration, the diff erentiation of monocytes into infl ammatory macrophages was also prevented. These changes also led to a decrease of the overall levels of infl ammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. In the chronic infl ammatory model, MSC administration also reduced the infl ux of infl ammatory cells to the peritoneum, but only when the MSC were administered close to the onset of infl ammation. Phenotypic analysis of the peritoneal cavity's cells and histological analysis of the peritoneal membrane showed only a minor immunomodulatory eff ect of MSC in this setting. Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that the infl ammatory environment has a signifi cant impact in the fi nal outcome eff ect of the in vivo administration of MSC. We envisage that the information obtained from these two infl ammation models are fundamental to understand the immunoregulatory properties of MSC in more complex models of multiple tissue infl ammation and injury, like graft-versus-host disease.",

Results: We observed that when MSC were exposed to CD3/CD28activated splenocytes, the most notable increase was observed at the level of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) which was up-regulated between 3000 and 6000 folds. As previously reported by other studies, NOS2 is the major eff ector mechanism of immunosuppression because the ability of MSC obtained from NOS2 defi cient mice (NOS2-/-) to inhibit T cell proliferation was completely abolished. Therefore, we decided to investigate a number of cytokines for their ability to increase the levels of NOS2. NOS2 transcripts were prominently up-regulated in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. Whilst IFN-\u03b3 did not produce any eff ect, it synergized with TNF-\u03b1 by inducing up to 15,000-fold increase in NOS2 expression.",

Real-time PCR was used to quantify the expression level of genes which are regulated by NF-\u03ba B.

New downstream genes that might responsible for PML's regulation were found and possible mechanisms were analyzed. Methods: After approval by institutional review board, hMSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of volunteers by Ficoll-paque and confi rmed by fl ow cytometry. The lentiviral vector which encodes full length human PML cDNA was transfected to hMSCs. Mock-transfected and normal cells were used as controls. RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression. Proliferation level was measured by MTT. Flow cyto metry was used to analyze the apoptosis and cell cycle. Osteogenic diff erentiation of hMSCs was induced by osteo-inductive medium for 7 to 14 days. The location of PML protein was detected by immunofl uorescence. cDNA microarray was used to scan gene expression profi le and look for meaningful changes. Results: The expressions of PML-mRNA and protein in hMSCs increased time-dependently with cell proliferation and osteogenic diff erentiation, while PML-NBs in hMSCs also increased in number and size. When PML was over-expressed, the proliferation of hMSCs was inhibited by 69.86% on day 4(P<0.05). The percentage of early apoptotic cells in PML-transfected group was 10.3\u00b14.23%, higher than mock-transfected (2.53\u00b10.77%) (P<0.05) and normal cells (2.18\u00b11.88%) (P<0.05), which was consistent with a decreased production of two cell apoptosis-associated proteins: pro-caspase-3 and PARP, and an increased production of cleaved caspase-3. The calcium deposits in osteo-induced hMSCs had an obvious increase detected by von kossa staining on day 7 in PML-transfected cells, while the mRNA expressions of osteogenic diff erentiation-related genes (SPP1, IBSP, BMP2, and Osterix) were up-regulated and the activity of ALP also increased, which indicates PML can promote hMSCs' osteo-diff erentiation. With microarray scanning, we found FGFR-2 was signifi cantly downregulated in PML-transfected cells, which is a fi broblast growth factor receptor substrate. The interaction between PML and FGFR-2 need further study. Conclusion: Our data indicates that PML regulates hMSCs as an inhibitor of cell proliferation but a promoter of osteogenic diff erentiation.

Cell-based therapies have S262 been tested to promote revascularization, mainly through the release and actions of paracrine factors that may inhibit apoptosis and support migration and proliferation of resident endothelial cells (ECs). Given the superiority of cord blood (CB)-derived stem cells versus peripheral blood derived cells, we tested the hypothesis that conditioned medium (CM) from apoptotic CB-derived mononuclear cells (CB-MNCs) could induce proliferation and migration of ECs, leading to angiogenesis in vitro. Methods: Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC, Lonza) were cultured in Endothelial Basal Medium (EBM2) supplemented with SingleQuotes. MNCs were isolated from CB by density gradient centrifugation, \u03b3-irradiated (70Gy) to induce apoptosis and incubated in EBM2 for 72h to obtain CM. MNCs viability after \u03b3-irradiation was evaluated by fl ow cytometry ( S263 IFN-\u03b3 (Fig.1) . To correlate in vitro potency with in vivo activity, high potency MSC (AUC=242) were used to prevent GvHD in mice. GvHD, as measured by weight loss, was found to be signifi cantly inferior in MSC-treated group (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: Our potency assay appears reliable and able to discriminate MSC with diff erent immunosuppressive magnitude in vitro. This capacity is batch-specifi c rather than donor-related. We also show that diff erent cells can have diff erent sensitivity to licensing with IFN-\u03b3. Our data indicate the assay predicts MSC efficacy in vivo.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the dynamics of colony forming unit fi broblasts (CFU-F) in the bone marrow (BM) and proliferative potential of BM-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). AlloHSCT was performed to 20 patients (8 male, 12 female) with various diagnosis. Conditioning was myeloablative in 12 patients and reduced intensity in 5. After informed consent BM was aspirated before conditioning and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 360 days after alloHSCT. MSC and CFU-F were cultured in standard conditions. Cumulative MSC production was counted after 5 passages. CFU-F concentration in patients before transplantation decreased 1,5 fold comparing to donors . In 30 days after alloHSCT concentration of CFU-F in BM of patients decreased more than 4 fold. Further it gradually increased and 1 year after alloHSCT mount to 75% (22.4\u00b114.8) of value before transplantation. No diff erences were revealed between patients received myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimen. In patients older than 35 years regeneration of CFU-F concentration was slower, than in younger patients. Before alloHSCT CFU-F concentration in patients with ALL was comparable with donors level. It decreased signifi cantly 30 days after alloHSCT and didn't restored fully, while in patients with AML and CML it was 3 times lower before transplantation and reached initial level 1 year after alloHSCT. Before alloHSCT cumulative MSC production was decreased 5 fold and median time to passage in patients was 1,5 times longer, than in donors. In 30 days after alloHSCT median time to passage increased 3 times, than decreased slowly during 1 year. Cumulative MSC production decreased 5 times. Proliferation of MSC was more eff ective in patients younger than 35 years. MSC's growing time was altered in patients for all period of observation. Cumulative MSC production is mostly damaged in patients with CML.",

When incubated with poly IC in vitro they showed similar phenotypic alterations than murine FRC exposed to poly IC in vivo, namely an increase in MHC-I, CD54 and B7-H1 expression. Moreover MSC incubated with poly IC or \u03b3-interferon actively depleted the culture medium in L-tryptophan indicating that the indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase was activated, and such media could not support T cell proliferation. Altogether these observations suggest that the systemic antiinfl ammatory eff ect exerted by MSC when infused intravenously (as documented by their ability to control steroid resistant graft versus host disease) may refl ect the physiological regulation that MSCs, or their progeny diff erentiated in FRC exert in the lymph nodes when exposed to local infl ammation.

We simulated adverse event occurring during cryo, due to delay of start of controlled rate freezing: 5 sample were cryopreserved immediatelly after adding DMSO solution (T0), 5 after 15 min of delay (T15), 5 after 30 min (T30), 5 after 45 min (T45) and 5 after 60 min (T60). In order to investigate if toxic eff ect was due to exposition pre-cryo or after thawing, samples cryopreserved at T0 were tested immediatelly after thawing(T0-T0), after 15 min (T0-T15), after 30 min (T0-T30), after 45 min (T0-T45) and after 60 min (T0-T60).

Recently, unique population of very small embryonic-like SCs (VSELs) has been also identifi ed in CB samples. These cells exhibit: 1) very small size (<6 \u03bcm), 2) CD45-/ Lin-/CD133+ phenotype; 3) large nuclei containing primitive euchromatin and 4) expression of markers of pluripotent SCs (e.g. Oct-4, Nanog). Aim: Oct-4+ VSELs may be predominantly found among CD45-/ Lin-/CD133+ CB cells, but also in some extend in fractions expressing CD34 or CXCR4 markers. However, co-expression of CD34 and CXCR4, as well as other surface antigens has never been examined on CD45-/Lin-/CD133+ VSELs. Moreover, new more eff ective isolation strategies based on antigen expression are essential for their future applications. Results: We used multiparameter fl ow cytometry (LSR II; BD Bioscience) and imaging cytometry (ImageStream system; Amnis Corp.) to quantitatively examine co-expression of CD34 and CXCR4 on CB-derived VSELs. We found VSELs as heterogeneous fraction of non-hematopoietic SCs in terms of co-existence of these crucial three SC markers. We examined that more than half (54 %) of CD45-/Lin-/CD133+ VSELs may co-express CD34 antigen, however only small fraction (0,025 %) possess CXCR4 antigen, indicating diff erent properties of these fractions. Similar heterogeneity was also found in population of CD45+/ Lin-/CD133+ HSCs. The majority of these cells ( Objectives: Busulfan is an alkylating agent commonly used in children as part of conditioning regimen in allogeneic (allo-SCT) and autologous (auto-SCT) stem cell transplantation. Oral formulation was replaced for intravenously way. We have analyzed secondary eff ects in the use of intravenous busulfan ( Results: The transplant-related mortalities (TRM) at 100 days were 6.8% and 5.5% in allo and auto-SCT, respectively. 25 patients developed acute GVHD (58.1%) after allo-SCT and none after auto-SCT. Three patients had EVOH (1 in auto-SCT group and 2 in allo-SCT group). There were no signifi cant diff erences in TRM, EVOH, and neurological, gastrointestinal, metabolic or skin toxicity when comparing IV-Bu in single or divided doses. Neurological toxicity tends to be higher in those who received four days of IV-Bu compared to 3 days (p=0.061 Fisher test). In auto-SCT there was no diff erences in TRM, EVOH or toxicity among patients receiving IV-Bu in one or multiple daily doses. In the global series (allo+auto SCT) children who received 4 days of IV-Bu had more neurological toxicity compared which those who received 3 days of IV-Bu (p=0.026 Fisher test). Conclusion: In our study we found no signifi cant diff erences in terms of complications, EVOH and TRM when comparing IV-Bu in a single daily dose or divided in 4 daily doses in allo-SCT.

Method: we analysed retrospective data obtained from an electronic questionnaire which was distributed to every Paediatric allogeneic HSCT unit in the UK and Ireland. Patient demographic information was correlated with the diagnosis of acute leukaemia, length of fi rst remission, type of conditioning used prior to HSCT 1 and HSCT 2, length of remission post HSCT1 and the presence and grade of Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) following each transplant. The Overall Survival (OS) outcomes were recorded according to status at last review. Results: Of the 50 patients there are 20 survivors (40 %) of second HSCT in the population examined (10 male). 62.5% of females survived whilst 29% of males are still alive.12 (37.5 %) of ALL patients survive whilst 9 (50%) of AML patients are alive.",

Eleven children responded completely (CR: no evident GVHD clinical/biopsy proven) and 6 partially (PR: at least one grade) at 30 days after the 1st MSC infusion, (1-3 infusions total), with 5 no response/progression. Sixteen patients survived >100 days post 1st MSC infusion and were evaluated. Three patients developed GI fi brosis and obstruction of the small bowel. One girl, aged 15 months with extensive disease, required long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and died 3 yrs later from cGHVD. In a boy aged 15 yrs, fi brosis was localized to the terminal ileum and caecum. He underwent surgical resection, but later developed diarrhea due to cGVHD of the pancreas. Another boy, aged 3\u00be yrs required local surgical resection of a preterminal ileum stricture complicating cGVHD of the gut. Two girls aged <1 year, developed ascites, one with evident esophageal varices and portal hypertension. Both required intermittent mechanical drainage and long term diuretics. Eight children in total all aged < 4 years developed protein losing enteropathy, without histological aGVHD, which persisted more than 4 months. TPN/enteral feeding was necessary and protracted.

Handgretinger University Children's Hospital T\u00fcbingen (T\u00fcbingen, DE) Refractory viral infections with persistent viral pathogens cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus (CMV, EBV, ADV) cause serious morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) due to a defi cient T-cell immunity. Adoptive T-cell transfer represents a promising approach in chemo-refractory viral infections using short term ex vivo protocols with small T-cell doses for induction of protective immunity. Since protection against multiple pathogens is required for most patients, T-cell transfer against multiple specifi cities may decrease multiple virus related morbidities. Our aim was the development of a standardized good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade ex vivo protocol to generate multivirus-specifi c T cells in a short term single step approach for adoptive T-cell transfer. Virus-specifi c T cells were generated by stimulating donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with virus-derived immunodominant T-cell epitopes (pp65, Hexon, EBNA-1), followed by enrichment of virus specifi c CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using interferon-\u03b3 capture technique. Feasibility was shown for the isolation of T cells for all three viral antigens in one single step and took 12 hours. All specifi cities (CMV, EBV, ADV) could be confi rmed in the T-cell product. Four children were treated with adoptive T-cell transfer. No infusional toxicities or graft versus host disease were seen. Induction of a pathogenspecifi c T-cell response could be shown in vivo, that was associated with the kinetics/improvement of the viral infection. In conclusion, induction of antiviral T-cell responses was feasible with a tri-virus-specifi c adoptive T-cell transfer ex vivo. Simultaneous T-cell stimulation with a mix of several antigens did not lead to extensive antigenic competition. Treating patients with multivirus-specifi c T cells resulted in reduction of viral burden. We also observed an increased frequency of virus-specifi c T cells in case of a subsequent virus reactivation post adoptive transfer of multivirus-specifi c T cells. This renders the approach also attractive for prophylactic use of multivirus-specifi c T cells. Multi-centre clinical studies have to evaluate effi cacy of this approach in the future.",

Drug treatment against these infections is often not suffi cient. Adoptive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) therapy is a possibility and has been used successfully. In addition relapse of the underlying disease is the other major cause of treatment failure. Screening for minimal residual disease (MRD) allows identifi cation of impending relapse and preemptive immunotherapy such as the application of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) or the transfer of cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells may in principle prevent relapse in a group of high risk patients. Methods and Results: CIK cells are generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HLA-A*0201 CMV-seropositive healthy donors according to the standard protocol. Besides the standard stimulation with INF-\u03b3 on day 0 followed 24h later by OKT-3 and IL-2, IL-15 is added every 3-4 days and viral antigen in the form of peptides or protein is presented in the medium from day 0 on to increase the frequency of existing virus-specifi c CTL. Anti-CMV-specifi c CTL are identifi ed by fl ow cytometry after staining with PE-conjugated HLA-A*0201/pp65 495-504 pentamer and FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody at certain days. The incubation with viral antigen leads to an up to 7.5 fold increase (n=6) of CMV-specifi c CD8+ cells. In subsequent in vitro experiments the increased cytotoxicity of antigen-stimulated CIK cells against viral antigen-loaded T2 cell line is shown. In the verifi ed and maintaining killing against leukemia cell lines the main killing mechanism is mediated via the NKG2D and MIC A/B pathway. To distinguish between the unspecifi c NKG2D-killing and the specifi c T-cell receptor mediated killing, the NKG2D pathway needs to be blocked to show the cytotoxicity of the viral-specifi c CIK cells in comparison to the non-antigen-stimulated fraction. Conclusion: The generation of dual-specifi c CIK cells may be an improved immunotherapy after stem cell transplantation inducing cytotoxicity against leukemia cells and might help to clear virus reactivation.

All CB units in the registry were obtained from Korea cord blood banks. Results: Sixty-fi ve patients were eligible for this study. The patients were separated into three groups: 24 patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia, 16 with inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (iBMFS) and 25 with primary immune defi ciency/inherited metabolic disorder (PID/IMD). The cumulative incidences (CIs) of neutrophil and platelet recovery were 73.3% on day 42 and 71.9% on day 180 post-UCBT, respectively. By day 100, the CI of acute grade II to IV graft-versus-host disease was 32.3%. At a median follow up of 71 months, 5-year overall survival (OS) and event free survival was 50.7% and 40.6%, respectively. Deaths were mainly due to infection, pulmonary complications and hemorrhage. In a multivariate analysis, presence of more than 3.91 x 10 5 /kg of infused CD34+ cells was the only factor consistently identifi ed as signifi cantly associated with rate of neutrophil engraftment (P = 0.04) and OS (P = 0.03). Survival rate (37.5%) and CI of neutrophil engraftment (37.5%) were lowest in patients with inherited BMFs. In iBMFS, use of a conditioning regimen including total body irradiation (TBI) was associated with worse survival (66.7% in TBI-vs. 0% in TBI+, P < 0.01) due to increased treatment-related mortality. In PID/IMD, patients receiving myeloablative conditioning including fl udarabine showed signifi cantly higher engraftment (100%) and survival rate (87.5%) than patients receiving other conditioning regimen. Conclusions: When cell dose and other factors are optimal, UCBT seems to be a feasible therapy for nonmalignant disease in children and adolescents who lack an appropriate related HLA matched donor. The strategies to reduce transplant-related toxicities would improve the outcome of UCBT in nonmalignant diseases.",

Parkman Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (Los Angeles, US) PEG-ADA provides replacement therapy to patients wtih ADA Defi cient SCID. However, PEG-ADA does not fully restore cellular abnormalities. There have been 7 previous reports of ADA -SCID patients developing lymphoma. Of these, only 6 remain alive with most patients not having responsive disease prior to transplant. We report 2 patients who received PEG-ADA for 13 years and developed EBV + B cell lymphoma while on PEG ADA. These patients responded to therapy only in the absence of PEG-ADA. Patient 1 began PEGA -ADA therapy at 6 months of age and despite normal levels of ADA, developed metastatic B cell lymphoma (brain, bone , hepatic, splenic and mediastinal). She did not respond to multiple course of therapy, including high dose cytoxan, high dose methotrexate and steroids. After PEG -ADA was discontinued she had a greater than 50% response with etoposide and cytarabine. She underwent an HLA matched 9/10 mathed unrelated transplant using fl udarabine and melphalen and achieved a complete remission of her lymphoma. Patient 2 began PEG ADA therapy at 4 months of age and developed a metastatic B cell lymphoma at 14 years of age. He was taken off of PEG ADA at the time of his chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission after receiving R-CHOP. He is now undergoing a matched unrelated transplant. We speculate that while on PEG-ADA, the immunologic surveillance by T cells is defective and does not allow for adequate elimination of the EBV infected cells. However, the presence of PEG-ADA does not allow for the complete destruction of these same EBV infected malignant cells. Therefore, EBV driven malignancies in ADA-defi cient patients need to be treated aggressively, without the presence of PEG-ADA, in order to achieve an adequate tumor response. In conclusion: there is a strong correlation between BKV viremia/viruria and impaired cellular and humoral immune recovery after allo-HSCT. Probability of HC development in children after allo-HSCT depends on patients age, BKV viremia (>10 3 copies/ml)/viruria (>10 7 copies/ml) and on the profi le of CD8+ cell recovery.",

The anti CD3 specifi c OKT3 antibody was routinely used as rejection prophylaxis without aff ecting CD3 negative cells. Due to its restricted availability, it had to be substituted by polyclonal ATG preparations with a longer half life period and comprising a broader variety of antigens. We present data with reduced ATG doses given at the beginning of the conditioning regimen in order not to impair cotransfused NK cells and immune recovery. A total of 20 pediatric patients received 3x10 mg/kg ATG-F (Fresenius) starting at day -12, followed by fl udarabine (160 mg/m 2 , d -8 to -5), thiotepa (10 mg/m2 d -4) and melphalan (140 mg/m 2 d -3 to -2). Median time to ANC>500 was 9 days. Graft rejection occurred in 2/20 patients (10%). Acute GvHD grade II-IV was observed in 1/18 (6%) patients without rejection. Extensive chronic GvHD occurred in 1/18 patients. Immune recovery was monitored and compared with a historical group receiving OKT3 and the same chemotherapy (n=34 . ATG serum levels were measured in 9 patients by fl ow cytometry (amount of ATG binding to the Jurkat cell line, defi ned as T cell specifi c rabbit IgG). Median peak levels of 23.7 \u03bcg/ml specifi c rabbit IgG were reached between day -8 and -6 and dropped to 1.9 \u03bcg/ml at day 0. In vitro incubation of NK cells from healthy donors with a comparable dosage of ATG-F (1 \u03bcg/ml) resulted in 26 % apoptosis and 0.2 % necrosis (70% vital cells) after 24 hours. Conclusions: ATG-F was started at an early time point, resulting in low serum levels of specifi c ATG at day 0 and in a fast NK cell recovery. In vitro results suggested, that the majority of NK cells will not be damaged herewith. Immune recovery of T and NK cells was comparable to that of a historical control group who received OKT3. This approach will be also of interest for other transplantation strategies in which various components of the grafts and additionally given T cells have to be preserved.",

Our aims were: 1) to further reduce leukemic load in otherwise refractory patients (therapeutic use) or 2) to prevent relapse after SCT in patients without detectable leukemic load but at extremely high risk (prophylactic use). 18 patients with B-lineage ALL (CR1-3 without MRD, n=8; CR1-3 with detectable MRD, n=8; active disease, n=2; previous SCT 15/18) received a mean number of 11 (range infusions of an anti-CD19 mAb (4G7SDIE) over 6 hours weekly or every second week posttransplant. In 8 patients, additional infusions were given prior to last SCT. Dosages ranged from 5 to 50 mg/m2. The infusions were well tolerated without any acute side eff ects. Depletion of CD19+ B cells occurred in all patients, which required i.v.-substitution of immunoglobulines. 1 severe infection (zygomycosis) was observed up to now. Minimal residual disease (MRD) or overt relapse (>50% blasts) was detectable in bone marrow aspirates prior to therapeutic mAb administration in 8/18 and 2/18 patients, respectively. Prophylactic CD19mAb infusions were given posttransplant without measurable MRD levels in 8/18 patients and in another 2 patients (who did not respond to pretransplant CD19mAb but reached MRD negativity after SCT) due to an extremely high relapse risk. In 4 out of 6 patients with detectable MRD, leukemic load was reduced for at least 1 log or eradicated by the mAb. 2 other patients responded to antiCD19 treatment as well but received additional therapy. 2 out of those patients relapsed, 6 other patients are in remission after 1st antibody application with a median follow up of 185 days (range 17-464 days). Both patients with overt relapse did not respond. 2/10 patients with prophylactic mAb infusions relapsed after 161 and 177 days, 8 other patients remain in molecular remission since 75-108 days.

Conditioning regimens varied. 7 patients were aged 3-11 months. 6 had pre-existing intra-thoracic pathology (HLH 1, 4 proven or probable malignancy, 1 diaphragmatic eventration). Three patients had prior or co-existing chest infection (1 Pneumocystis, 1 Parainfl uenza 3, Cytomegalovirus 3). None satisfi ed full criteria for VOD. Common/recurring presenting signs included tachypnoea (10), persistent tachycardia (4), thick mucus secretions (3), fl uid retention (4), hepatosplenomegaly (3), oxygen requirement (7) and radiological bilateral chest infi ltrates/pneumonitis (4) . Earliest signs of PAH were at a median of D11 (D-3 to +150) post-HSCT, but echo confi rmation was only evident by a median of D32 (D9-D150). Pulmonary hypertensive changes were seen in 2/2 biopsied patients. Therapy comprised either prostacyclin and/or sildenafi l (9 pts, maximum doses 30ng/kg/min and 1mg/kg QDS respectively) or oxygen therapy alone (1) . In one, with late presentation coexistent with CMV reactivation, PAH resolved during CMV therapy. 8 (73%) patients had complete resolution of PAH. Three (27%) had PAH as cause of death. Conclusions: Aetiology remains unclear in many cases and may comprise a mixture of pre-transplant, infective and allogeneic factors. However this data shows that PAH, although well recognised in non-malignant HSCT, can also occur in patients transplanted for a range of malignancies. Echo changes may not be present at onset of symptoms but a high index of diagnostic suspicion and early treatment may contribute to recovery. Various T-cell depletion strategies have been used over time to minimize GVHD and maximize sustained engraftment and early immune reconstitution in alternative donor transplants with variable success rates.",

Methods: A one year old boy with WAS (c.7781G>A mutation in intron 8) and disseminated CMV infection requiring ventilation for CMV pneumonitis at aged 4 months was admitted for haploidentical paternal HSCT in the absence of a suitably matched family or unrelated donor. He was pre-treated with ganciclovir and on admission CMV PCR was negative. After admission he was started on prophylactic foscarnet. He was conditioned using rabbit ATG (15mg/kg total day-12 till day-9), busulfan, fl udarabine and thiotepa. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil were used for GVHD prophylaxis. Stem cells were mobilised using GCSF and peripheral blood stem cells were harvested. T-cell manipulation was performed using Miltenyi clini-MACS system. Total nucleated cell dose was 10.9x 10 8 /kg, CD34 + cells dose was 21.9 x 10 6 /kg, TCR\u03b1 \u03b2 cells were 1.3 x 104/kg (4.5 log reduction), CD19 cell dose was 3.1 x 10 4 /kg (3.7 log reduction) and TCR\u03b3\u03b4 cell count was 3.2 x 10 7 /kg. Results: Polymorphonuclear cell and platelet engraftment was seen on D+15 and D+17 respectively. Chimerism on day +16 showed 100% donor cells. Lymphocyte subsets were closely followed post transplant. There was no evidence of acute GVHD. His post transplant course was complicated by CMV reactivation which was treated with therapeutic doses of foscarnet. His CMV became undetectable at day +36 post transplant.

This is the fi rst reported case of haploidentical HSCT using this technique for primary immunodefi ciency in United Kingdom. patients (94% Allo) underwent BAL; 1yr probability of requiring BAL was 43% Allo, 8.5% Auto and yielded a 40% diagnostic infectious etiology (Fig. 1) . LB was performed in 10% of HSCT recipients with a diagnostic yield of 94% ( Fig. 1 )(P<0.0001). There were no grade III/IV toxicities probably or defi nitely attributed to either procedure. In a multivariate analysis the need for requiring BAL following MAC Allo was signifi cantly associated together (HR=85, P=0.0002). The probability of OS was 20.2%, 17.5% and 67.4% in pediatric HSCT recipients who required BAL, LB or neither, respectively (Fig. 2) . In the multivariate analysis, the need for BAL was associated with a signifi cant risk of mortality (HR=2.96; P<0.0001). Conclusion: In summary, in this large cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients, approximately 34% and 8% with APC required BAL vs. LB, respectively. Both BAL and LB were safe and well tolerated and yielded a diagnostic success of 40% and 94%, respectively. Future prospective studies are needed to determine which pediatric HSCT recipients should undergo BAL vs. LB and to improve longterm mortality from APC.

Over the past decades, major landmarks and advances have been achieved in the fi eld of allo-SCT with respect to conditioning regimens, choice of stem cells source, as well as supportive care. With this background, we conducted a study to assess the outcome of pediatric transplanted in a single institution over a 3 decades period. All patients who received allo-SCT in our pediatric hematology department between 1983 and 2010 were included in this analysis. This period was a priori divided into two parts namely 1983-1999 and 2000-2010 , the latest period corresponding to the initiation and development of cord blood allo-SCT and introduction of the so-called reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in some subgroups. In all, 250 patients were allografted and 272 allo-HSCT were performed The main characteristics of the patients and the most relevant aspects of allo-SCT are shown on Table 1 . The use of a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen was predominant between 1983 and 1999 while RIC regimen represented 16% of the procedures after 2000 (p=9. .Bone marrow was the major stem cell source between 1983-1999 compared to 2000-2010 (96% vs 65%, p=2.10-10). After 2000, cord blood was introduced as stem cell source for 25% of cases and peripheral blood stem cell for 9%. Overall survival (OS) was signifi cantly higher in the second period (64% versus 52%, p=0.03) (Fig.1) . Also, non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 5 years was signifi cantly lower after 2000 (29% versus 9%, p=0.0002). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 25% between 1983-1999 and 34% between 2000-2010 (p=0.11) . Concerning the cumulative incidence of mortality due to relapse or progression was not statistically diff erent between the 2 periods (20% vs 26%, p=0.26). Finally, between the 1983-1999 period and the 2000-2010 period, the cumulative incidence of death related to GVHD was signifi cantly reduced (13% versus 3%, p=0.001).",

Gaslini Children's Research Institute (Genoa, IT) Introduction: Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) represents a recognized treatment of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease(aGvHD/cGvHD). Actually no clinical prognostic factors of response to ECP and no schedule based on organ GvHD involvement are reported. Patients: In the last decade, 160 allogeneic stem cell transplants (allo-SCT) performed at G. Gaslini Institute in children with malignant (70.6%) or non-malignant (29.4%) disease were complicated by either acute (51.2%), chronic (6.3%) or both forms (42.5%) of GvHD. ECP was performed in 36 cases with aGvHD (grade I-II=13; grade III-IV=23) and 10 with cGvHD (limited=2; extensive=8). Organs involved were skin (n=26), gut (n=18), and liver (n=10). Treatment schedule included an induction phase (2 times weekly, at least 16) and a maintenance phase (2 times every 2 weeks, at least 8) according to clinical response and organ involvement. ECP was performed with discontinuous methodology, using separated cell separation (COBE SPECTRATM) and UVA irradiation. Results: After a median follow-up of 3.5 years(0.1-12.1), 75% of children with aGvHD responded, either completely (61.1%) or partially (13.9%). Response by organ was 85%, 77% and 50% for cutaneous, intestinal, and hepatic involvement, and was obtained after a median of 7, 6.5 and 6 ECP-procedures, respectively. Overall response in cGvHD was 70% (complete 20%, partial 50%) after a median of 18 ECP-procedures. Conclusions: Our results confi rmed ECP feasibility and effi cacy in cutaneous and visceral acute and c-GvHD; the response to ECP, when obtained, occurred within the fi rst 7 procedures in a-GvHD and later in c-GvHD forms(18 procedures); steroid tapering represented the only variable predicting response and survival.",

Gaslini Children's Research Institute (Genoa, IT) Introduction: Poor graft function (PGF) is defi ned as a mono-, bior tri-lineage cytopenia appearing at least 2 weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). PGF is defi ned primary if recipients fail to achieve sustained graft function, secondary if occurs after complete hematologic recovery. The aim of this study is to report a single centre retrospective experience in 7 children who received boost of donor-derived CD34\u00b1selected cells (CD34\u00b1boost) for a primary or secondary PGF. Patients: Between 2002 and 2011, 7 patients (pts) with a median age of 11.7 years (range 3.8-18) with malignant (n=2) or non malignant disease (n=5) received CD34\u00b1boost, without further conditioning, for primary (n=6) or secondary PGF (n=1). PGF was diagnosed after a median of 199 days (range 62-465) by allo-HSCT from a matchedrelated (2 pts) or alternative (5 pts) donor, which was prepared with a myeloablative (n=2) or non-myeloablative (n=5) regimen. Chimerism was mixed in 1 pt, while all others were full donor. Acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) occurred in 6 pts (grade I=4, grade IV=2) and chronic-GvHD in 4 pts (extensive=3, limited=1). After a single apheresis of G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood from the original donor, a median of 4.52x10e6/Kg CD34+ positively selected (CliniMACs; Miltenyi) cells were infused (range 1. 2-18.4) . At time of boost, median neutrophils (PMN) count was 0.61x10e9/ L(0.1-3.5), 6 pts were platelets (PLTs) and 5 red cell transfusions dependent. Infectious events before CD34\u00b1boost included 6 viral reactivations(5 CMV and 1 herpes zoster), 3 severe bacterial events and 1 pulmonary aspergillosis. Results: Tri-lineage recovery was observed in all pts. PMN count exceeded 2\u00d710e9/L after a median of 30 days(range 8-60), PLTs and red cells transfusion independency was achieved 28 (range 6-250) and 40 days (10-120) after CD34\u00b1boost respectively. The single pt with mixed chimerism converted into complete donor 3 months after CD34+ boost. The median follow-up was 2.5 yrs (1.1-10) . NRM was absent and 1 pt died of leukemia relapse. No signifi cant infectious episode nor acute GvHD reactivation were observed; the 3 pts with extensive chronic GvHD experienced a signifi cant improvement after CD34+ boost. Conclusion: Our experience confi rms that CD34\u00b1boost represent an eff ective and safe approach of PGF also in pediatric pts, obtaining a better control of infections and acute and chronic GVHD, but largest studies are need to evaluate the role of CD34\u00b1boost in GvHD control.",

After 131 months, the probability of relapse-free survival for all patients was 0.654, while probability of event-free survival was 0.429. Conclusion: Long-term results of treosulfan-based preparative regimens for 2nd or 3rd HSCT in children with hematological malignancies demonstrate its low early RRT, excellent myeloablative eff ect, and at least acceptable NRM and anti-leukemic eff ect in this high-risk subset of pediatric patients. Results: Myeloid engraftment was achieved in all children.

Between October 2009 and November 2012 n = 22 patients 1.5-18 years of age and with acute or chronic GVHD after stem cell transplantation S282 have been treated with CELLEX in Tuebingen. n = 18 patients suffered from skin and gut GVHD (whereof 6 patients had liver GVHD additionally). n = 4 patients suff ered from lung GVHD. Body weight was 10-67 kg (with a mean of 23.9 kg). All patients were refractory to standard immunosuppression including corticosteroids. 17/22 patients (77%)achieved complete or partial remission of their GVHD with ECP. In all these successful treatments a reduction of the corticosteroid dose by at least 50% wass possible. Currently we treat patients with GVH with 2 treatment sessions weekly in the fi rst month, followed by 2 treatments every other week in month 2-4 and 2 treatments every 4 weeks in months 5+6. We have no diffi culty using Hickman catheters or other central venous catheters already in place as venous access. In case of mucous bleeding with GVHD of the gut we use regional citrate anticoagulation instead of heparin. Bacterial (e.g. MRSA) or viral (e.g. Hepatitis C)infections are no contraindication to ECP treatment,since this an immunomodulating rather than an immunosuppressive procedure. Remarkable is the high success rate of ECP in children and adolescents with GVHD, the short treatment time of about 2 -2.5 hours and minimal or no adverse eff ects. Corticosteroid treatment can be discontinued in many patients and thus the risk of severe infections diminished.",

However, approximately 10 to 30% of patients fail to collect the minimum number of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation. Plerixafor was recently approved as a new mobilization agent in combination with G-CSF in adult patients. However, there are limited data for effi cacy and safety in plerixafor usage in children. Several studies for small population have reported that plerixafor in combination with G-CSF might be also safe and eff ective in pediatric patients. Therefore, we S283 retrospectively reviewed our experience regarding the effi cacy and adverse eff ects of plerixafor in pediatric patients in Korea. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 26 pediatric patients from 6 centers in Korea who received plerixafor as part of the mobilization regimen between August 2009 and August 2012. Plerixafor was administered in second apheresis round in all patients who had failed to achieve suffi cient CD34+ cells in the fi rst apheresis round. Results: The median age was 10.3 years (21.-25.5) . All patients received plerixafor and G-CSF before hematopoietic stem cell collection. Nineteen patients also received chemotherapy as part of their mobilization regimen. While the median number of CD34+ cells collected in the fi rst apheresis was 1.23 x 10 6 /kg (0.18-8.26), the median number of CD34+ cells collected in the second apheresis was 5.10 x 10 6 /kg (0.24-70.55) (P = 0.006). A median 3.5-fold more CD34+ cells were collected after the plerixafor administration and 5.4 fold more CD34+ cells were harvested in patients who mobilized CD34+cells less than 2.0 x 10 6 /kg in the fi rst apheresis. Although 6 patients achieved CD34+ cells more than 2 x 10^/kg in the fi rst apheresis, 16 patients achieved CD34+ cells more than 2 x 10^/kg after plerixafor administration. Transplantation was performed in 22 patients. Median day of neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment were 9 days and 29 days, respectively. Four patients showed visual hallucination after plerixafor usage. Conclusion: The combination of plerixafor and G-CSF was also effi cacious in peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell collection in children. However, there may be a potential neurotoxicity in younger children. Further study should be performed before wider application of plerixafor in pediatric patients.",

Stein Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel (Petah Tikva, IL) Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has become an oft-used therapy for the treatment of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (aGVHD and cGVHD, respectively) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ECP is not inherently immunosuppressive and has few side eff ects, making it a tempting therapeutic option for the treatment of steroid refractory GVHD; issues of vascular access present practical obstacles to its use in children and young adults. We describe our experience using ECP in children after HSCT at our center. We performed 20 courses of ECP in 17 children (age 1.6 -18 yrs) between January 2010 and December 2012. ECP restarted after a hiatus of at least 4 weeks is counted as a new course. Primary diagnoses of our patients (pts) were malignant disease in 13 pts and non-malignant disease in four. Nine courses of ECP were performed for aGVHD, 6 for cGVHD, and 5 for pts with overlap syndrome (OvS). Most pts had ECP initiated as second-line therapy; in 2 cases ECP was initiated as fi rstline therapy due to underlying infectious complications where steroid-avoidance was imperative. Pts underwent a median of 9 treatments (range 2-90). Vascular access for ECP included Permacath \u00ae in 9 courses, Hickman\u00ae catheter in 2 courses, temporary arterial line in 2 courses, temporary peripheral (venous) lines in 1 course, and a combination of the above in 6 courses. ECP was discontinued in 1 pt due to issues of vascular access. We have observed 10 (50%) complete responses (CR), 3 (15%) partial responses (PR), and 6 (30%) mixed responses (MR). 14 pts (70%) could be weaned from their initial steroid dose. Among pts with aGVHD, CR occurred after 6/9 (67%) courses and steroid dose could be tapered in 5 cases. In pts with cGVHD, CR was seen in only one pt, with PR and MR in 3 and 2 pts, respectively. Steroids could be tapered in 5 (83%) pts. Among 5 pts with OvS, 3 achieved CR, 1 had an MR and one pt was resistant. Steroids were tapered in 4 pts. There were 10 deaths in the cohort, 3 from GVHD . In addition, 1 pt with CR in all 3 initially involved organs developed progressive bronchiolitis obliterans and died of respiratory failure, and 1 pt with severe steroid myopathy died of culture-negative sepsis. Three pts died of sepsis, one of fulminant hepatic failure (aspergillus niger and Penicillium species) and 1 of disease relapse. Our results support the use of ECP as a feasible, eff ective treatment for GVHD in children after HSCT. was bone marrow (67.6%). Conditioning regimen and prophylaxis against GVHD were administered according to our practice at that time and type of transplant. Results: One patient presented primary and eight secondary graft failure. One out of nine patients presenting graft failure survived. Fifteen patients (40%) developed acute GVHD grades II-IV and 8 of 25 assessable patients (32%) chronic GVHD; extensive cGVHD 2 of 25. Early complications were: hypertension (100%), mucositis grades II-III (51%), infections (43%), liver toxicity grade > 2 (35%), renal dysfunction (27%) and hyperglycaemia (24%). The main late eff ects, with a median follow-up of 14 years (range: 2 mo-23 y), were endocrine (gonadal dysfunction (90%), hypothyroidism (20%), GH defi ciency (20%) and diabetes mellitus (10%) and skeletal disorders (hip necrosis). Five patients developed malignancies: AML (2), tongue carcinoma (1), pharyngeal carcinoma (1) and basocellular carcinoma (1) Background: In low-and middle income countries there is a dire shortage of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) centers. In these areas, non-malignant disorders such as thalassemia, sickle cell disease and aplastic anemia are the most common indication to BMT. In particular, thalasssemia major is the most common life-threatening non-infectious disorder of childhood in South Asia where a substantial proportion of aff ected children do not survive beyond adolescence. The Cure2Children Foundation an International Non-Governmental Organization based in Florence, Italy, has supported, both fi nancially and professionally, the start up of two centers, one in Pakistan and one in India, for the cure of transfusion-dependent thalassemia by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) according to shared recommendations and within an intensive cooperation program based on on-line and on-site focused training. This is the fi rst outcome analysis focusing on initial results in start up centers in lower income settings. Methods: A total of twelve consecutive patients were included in this analysis, the initial six from the Children's Hospital of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad-Pakistan, and the initial six from the South East Asia Institute for Thalassemia, Jaipur-India. Both these centers had never performed BMT before and these patients where purposely chosen as the focus of this report because they represent the steepest phase of the learning curve and thus supposedly the ones at highest risk of unfavorable events related to the start up phase. Patients were 6 years or younger at transplant day, and received allogenic BMT from a compatible related donor. Findings: At a median follow-up of 5.9 months, the absolute neutrophil recovery was reached at a median period of 15.5 days, and platelet recovery at 18 days. Median period of hospital stay was 49 days, and actuarial thalassemia-free and overall survival, were both 91.7%. The mean total cost of a BMT including follow-up was 12,858 USD. Interpretation: In low resource settings matched-related low-risk BMT for thalassemia can be performed with outcomes comparable to richer countries and with a fraction of the costs. Within structured and intensive cooperation, good outcomes can be obtained from the very beginning. This observation may have important implications to increase access to cure thalassemia major worldwide and to face the dire shortage of BMT services in low-to middle income countries.",

Sirireung, U. Anurathapan, D. Songdej, S. Sasinil, N. Sirachainan, A. Chuansumrit Mahidol University (Bangkok, TH) Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a common complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Most of GVHD data was concluded from studies of HSCT in patients with hematologic malignancies. Thalassemia is the most common genetic hematologic disease and indication for HSCT in our country. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, severity, and risk factors for acute and chronic GVHD in children and adolescents with severe thalassemia after HSCT. We performed a retrospective study of thalassemia patients receiving HSCT between October 1992 and August 2012 at our institute. Acute GVHD was graded according to Seattle criteria. Chronic GVHD was analyzed using recent NIH criteria. There were 92 HSCT performed in 89 patients (48 males) with a median age of 7 years 6 months (range 4 months to 17 years 3 months). The types of thalassemia included HbE /\u03b2 thalassemia (n=69), homozygous \u03b2 thalassemia (n=22), and HbH disease (n=1). Myeloablative (MA) (n=74) and reduced intensity (RI) (n=18) regimens were used. Donors were HLA-matched siblings (n=62), unrelated donors (n=28), and haploidentical mothers (n=2). Bone marrow was the most common source of stem cells (62%). The median CD 34 cell dose was 7.49 x 106 cells/kg (range 0.61-22.08 x 106 cells/ kg). Most of recipients received CsA and MTX after MA regimen.",

From January 2007 to June 2012, 60 pts aged \u2264 16 years were referred to our centre for PBPC collection and autologous transplantation. In 14 pts PBPC were collected for 2 or more transplants, of whom 10 had enough PBPC in a single mobilization, while 4 needed further procedures, including one who was given plerixafor. Median age was 6 years (5 months-16 years), mean weight 40kg (7 to 92kg) with 16 pts <15kg. Diagnosis were neuroblastoma (22), lymphoma (11), Ewing's (9), PNET (5) and others (13). Pts were mobilized with G-CSF alone (40%) for a median of 6 days (4-12) or G-CSF plus chemotherapy (57%) for a median of 11days (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , with 2 pts being given G-CSF followed by G-CSF plus chemotherapy. Collections were performed using a Cobe Spectra separator version 4.7 until 2009 and 6.1 AutoPBSC thereafter. In 92% of procedures a central line was used. A median of 1.4 collections per patient were performed (1) (2) (3) , with a median 3.2 (1.7-5) blood volumes processed per leukapheresis. A median number of 5.3x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg were harvested per pt. Five pts, aged 3-15years, were given Plerixafor due to mobilization failure (median peripheral blood CD34+ cells 5x10 6 /microL before and 20.5x10 6 /microL after plerixafor). No signifi cant adverse events were observed during or immediately after collection. Forty-nine pts (82%) were transplanted and the median time to reach N>0.5x10 9 /L was 11 days. Eleven pts (18%) were not transplanted, 7 due to disease progression, 2 because of an inadequate CD34+ cell collection and 2 were no longer considered as transplant candidates due to complete response of the underlying disease. Twelve of 14 pts underwent 2 or more transplants (2 pts died before transplant). Median time to reach N>0.5x10 9 /L was identical for pts receiving single or tandem transplants. Our experience shows that PBPC collection in pediatric pts, even in those with very small weight, can be eff ectively achieved by a dedicated clinical and technical team.",

Primary disease was leukemia (4), SCID (4), malignant infantile osteopetrosis (OP, 8), Fanconi anemia (1) and hemofagocytic lymfohistiocytosis (HLH, 1). Conditioning was busulfan-based in 16/21 cases. Donors were matched (5) or mismatched (7) family and MUD (5) . Four patients developed VOD; 2 patients developed graft-versus-host disease and 7 were diagnosed with transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). All patients presented with dys/tachypnea and hypoxia between eight days and eight months after HSCT. Patients were diagnosed with PHT 1-60 days after presentation. Eleven patients were diagnosed by echocardiography, 5 by cardiac catheterization, 1 by lung biopsy and 1 at autopsy. Treatment was diverse with combinations of inhaled nitric oxide (10), tacrolimus (1), prostacyclin (8) sildenafi l (4), defi brotide (4), nicardipine (1), and diltiazem (1) Introduction: In the last two decades the use of unrelated cord blood (UCB) as an alternative source of haematopoietic stem cells has become a well-established procedure in the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases (NMD). We report the G. Gaslini Children's Institute experience on UCB transplantation in NMD. Patients and methods: From 1/1997 to 9/2012, we performed 23 UCB transplants in children with NMD (8 inborn errors of metabolism; 7 histiocyte disorders; 3 primary immunodefi ciencies; 3 osteopetrosis; 2 CAMT). HLA matching was 4/6 in 4 pts, 5/6 in 13 pts and 6/6 in 6 pts. The median age at transplant was 21 months (range 3-71) and the median weight was 12 Kg (range 4,2-27). Only 3 pts received a non-myeloablative preparative regimen. All pts received Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis including ATG, CyA and steroids. A median of 9,6 x 10 7 /Kg (range 6,2-28,7) TNC/recipient BW were infused. Results: The Transplant Related Mortality (TRM) was 13% (3/23 pts); 1 pt died of infection on day +14 without engraftment and 2 pts experienced late TRM (+170: surgical complication; +205: GvHD). Among the 22/23 pts evaluable for engraftment, 5 (22,7%) experienced graft rejection (primary in 2 cases and early secondary in 3); 3 of them were rescued with a second transplant and 1 is alive without evident disease after autologous reconstitution. Median time to recovery was 19 days (range 11-43) for neutrophils and 41 days (range 21-160) for platelets. 15 pts reached complete donor chimerism; 2 pts still present stable mixed chimerism 17 and 46 months after UCBT. Acute GvHD occurred in 11/17 (65%) pts who engrafted:",

In this protocol therapy intensity was stratifi ed, mainly by early response to therapy as measured by MRD. High risk patients were in general eligible for allogeneic transplant in CR1. ALL R3 was the protocol for relapsing patients. Conditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) in combination with etoposide, except for children < 3 years who were conditioned with a chemotherapeutic regimen. In the most recent period the conditioning regimen has been adapted for all children to busulphan/fl udarabin/clofarabin. Graft-versus-Host (GvH) prophylaxis was dependent on donor origin and stem cell source. Outcome data were provided by both SCT centres. Results: Since 2010 37 children with ALL have been transplanted in the Netherlands. 3 patients were excluded (1 Fanconi with ALL, 1 Down with ALL in CR3, 1 second SCT for relapse after 1st SCT). 13 patients were MRD positive at SCT, 11 negative and of 10 patients MRD at transplant was not available.",

All patients received combined standard GVHD treatment including at least cyclosporine and 2 mg/kg of methylprednisolone prior to IAS. Steroid resistance was defi ned as one of the following: GVHD progression after 3 days standard treatment, lack of response to at least 7 days standard treatment or incomplete response to 14 days. Steroid dependence was defi ned as a GVHD response, which relapsed with decrease in the steroid dose. Results: Twenty children (13 males and 7 females, median age 12.4 years, range 3-17 years) with steroid resistant or dependent GVHD underwent 30 IAS (GI -19, liver -2, combined liver and GI -9) within a median time of 39 days from GVHD diagnosis. Fifteen children were transplanted due to malignant diseases whereas 5/20 suff ered from non-malignant disorders. No signifi cant side eff ects as renal impairment or injection site complications were noted. Partial response was evident in 70% of the patients and 10/20 (50%) achieved complete remission. The one year survival in our cohort was 36% (fi gure 1). Death occurred due GVHD complications in 11/13 while one child died from H1N1 infl uenza and one from progression of disease. Conclusion: Data from this largest pediatric cohort of IAS reported to date suggests that IAS may be a safe and eff ective means of inducing response in patients with steroid resistant or dependent GVHD. We recommend to routinely combining IAS for such patients. Further research is warranted to assess the optimal dosing and administration protocol.",

Reduction of the volume and red cell content of umbilical cord blood prior to cryopreservation is required to reduce the required storage pace, the amount of free haemoglobin in the graft and the amount of cryoprotectant used. Current methods designed for red cell depletion and volume reduction prior to freezing and storage may not comply with GMP, are expensive, time consuming, and produce an unacceptable loss in cell viability and yield. Aim: Evaluate the performance of the Pall Select System in regards to volume reduction, cell recovery, growth potential and viability of recovered stem cells for non regular use within a busy transplant programme for directed harvests. Method: 8 samples were obtained for the study, cord blood was harvested from the placenta post partum. Following fi ltration pre and post aliquots were tested comparing volume reduction, White cell count, CD34+ cells, Cell viability and colony forming units. Results: Total collection volume showed a median reduction from 80ml (pre) to 23.5ml (post), shown to be signifi cant (P=0.0005).",

Conclusion: The Pall Select system demonstrated that it is possible to reduce product volume and red cell content without a clinically signifi cant loss of nucleated cells, in line with manufacturer's specifi cation. In order to comply with the new national and international standards the system could be considered for introduction into clinical practice for directed cord blood harvests. S291 diabetic coma, cealiac disease, associated with haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and idiopathic. In the literature we found only two case reports: a case of OMS associated with childhood ALL and a report of OMS associated with allo-HSCT AML CR2 in a adult. Here, we present a case of OMS associated with unrelated donor cord blood transplantation (UCBT). Case report: A 4-year-old girl with refractory anemia with excess blasts underwent matched UCBT. The patient was conditioned with thiotepa, intravenous busulfan, fl udarabine and thymoglobulin, with cyclosporine A and prednisone for graft-versus-host prophylaxis. She was admitted at day 45 post-HSCT by unstable walking and sudden onset opsoclonus. There was marked further neurological deterioration with dysarthria and hypotonia. On clinical examination she was alert and irritable. She had ataxia, bilateral opsoclonus, overall hypotonia, osteotendinous hyperrefl exia and positive Babinski sign. CT and MRI brain revealed no focal lesions or bleeding or mass eff ect. The cyclosporin level was acceptable. Viral PCR (HSV-CMV-EBV-HHV-6) in CSF and blood were negatives. CSF culture was negative. Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound and urine catecholamines were normal. Peripheral blood smear without schistocytes. After neurology opinion a clinical diagnosis of SOM was made. Immunoglobulin therapy is initiated with methylprednisolone achieving a progressive improvement of the neurological symptoms and rehabilitation treatment until complete resolution. At day 163 post-HSCT she presented immune cytopenias (anemia and thrombocytopenia) refractory to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and rituximab. Unfortunately she died of her hemolysis. Administration of allogeneic mesenchymal cells was pending.",

            "text": "Graft versus host disease (GVHD) following small bowel transplantation (SBT) occurs in about 6-16% % cases having a signifi cant impact on transplant related mortality and morbidity particularly in context of a non cancerous setting. In this report we describe the response of steroid and antibody therapy resistant GvHD post SBT to Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP). A fi ve year old girl underwent ABO matched isolated SBT for microvillus inclusion disease in January 2012. As GvHD prophylaxis she received 6 doses of Basiliximab (20mg) and was maintained post transplant on Tacrolimus and Prednisolone. One week post SBT she developed a transient patchy macular, erythematous rash over the abdomen, buttocks and the limbs which settled spontaneously. 8 weeks post SBT she presented with widespread macular rash with hyperpigmented lesions. A biopsy confi rmed diagnosis of skin Grade III-IV skin GvHD was made. Gut biopsy showed mixed chimerism but no evidence of GvHD. She received Methylprednisolone 1mk/kg and doses of Infl iximab and Basiliximab. Due to lack of response she went on to receive 3 doses of mesenchymal stem cells. Following an initial transient response the rash worsened in 2 weeks following the last dose. She was noted to have rising EBV titres though axillary node biopsy showed reactive changes only. At the time of referral to the ECP unit in August 2012 she was on Prednisolone 0.5mg/kg and oral Tacrolimus. Cutaneous GvHD aff ected 70% of body surface area (BSA) with heavily pigmented, lichenoid punctate lesions with intense indurated and exfoliated erythema of palms and soles and severe pruritus. No other organs appeared to be involved. She commenced on weekly paired ECP treatment delivered via a femoral catheter with blood priming. No alterations to immune suppression were made in the fi rst 6 weeks. By week 6 there was a reduction in erythema to 30 % BSA with particular improvement in the hands and soles. She was commenced on a slow steroid taper at this point and the treatment was given every 10 days. 3 months post ECP she is receiving Prednisolone 0.25 mg/kg with level adjusted Tacrolimus. There is continuing response to ECP with erythema now confi ned to face and palms. The pruritus has regressed with no intercurrent infections and stable EBV titres. The steroid taper has not been associated with fl are up GVHD .This case report highlights that fact that ECP is a valuable therapeutic intervention in cases of steroid and antibody refractory GvHD. 1 year old, the oldest 16 years (median 7.5 years). Weight categories for donors (range 10-99kg) <20 kg (n=8; 15%), 20-40kg (n=27; 51%) and >40kg (n=18; 34%), type of graft collected: BM (n=45; 85%), PBSC (n=4; 8%), BM+PBSC (n=3; 6%), BM+CB (n=1; 2%). Indication for HSCT was malignant disease in 66% or nonmalignant disease. In two patients the same sibling donor was used for re-transplantation. In most cases BM was used for HSCT. There were no serious adverse events due to GA. Most donors reported soreness at the site of collection of BM but responded well to analgetics. Donors stimulated with G-CSF reported pain and hematoma at the site of injection. In one donor CVC insertion was complicated by hemothorax with necessity of short-term drainage. Despite this event collection of the graft was possible and the donor is well. Hospital stay was in average 2-3 days for BM collection and 6-7 days for separation of PBSC. Donors are regularly monitored for blood tests and general condition at our clinic one year after harvest. There is a hypothesis about higher risk of malignancy in donor stimulated with G-CSF whose sibling suff ered from malignancy. In one case a donor was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia 10 years after the donation of BM for a brother transplanted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Serum galactomannan antigen (GM) detection is a useful tool for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk patients, although in children the promising results seen in adults have not been clearly confi rmed. In this sense, we have analyzed in this prospective study our experience in pediatric patients undergoing allo-SCT and who received antifungal prophylaxis with a mold active drug as voriconazole. Patients and Methods: A total of 59 children <18 years were enrolled in this study from Jun-2006 to Mar-2012. Median age was 9 years (range: [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . All patients received voriconazole from day -1 at a dose of 5 mg/kg/12 hours (n=13) or 7 mg/kg/12 hours (n=46) until a highest dose of 200 mg/12 hours. We consider neutropenic period from day 0 to one week after neutrophils recovery (>500/mm3). Proven or probable IFD was diagnosed according to EORTC/MSG criteria. The GM was measured twice weekly and was considered positive if the index value was >0.5 in two consecutive test or >0.8 in a single test. Results: Only two (3.4%) children developed IFD (probable aspergillosis) during neutropenia while on prophylaxis with voriconazol. In this series 51 (86.4%) patients completed successfully the prophylaxis during this period without adverse eff ects, no empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy neither IFD. A total of 4 (6.7%) receptors required empirical (n=2) or preemptive (n=2) antifungal therapy with amphotericin B once stopped voriconazole, one of them developed IFD. In 3 (5.1%) children was detected adverse eff ects due to voriconazole prophylaxis and needed a defi nitive withdrawal; these adverse eff ects were solved when voriconazole was discontinued. In this series a total of 299 GM test was performed. A total of 13 (22%) children presented positive GM test and only one of them developed IFD. Sensibility and specifi city per patient GM test were 50% and 78.9%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 7.6% and 97.8%, respectively. Conclusions: With a successfully prophylaxis rate of 86.4%, voriconazole is eff ective as antifungal prophylaxis in children undergoing allo-SCT during neutropenic period. GM test shows low sensitivity and specifi city in our series, with a high rate of false positives. GM results in children should be cautiously analyzed in order to avoid precipitated decisions.

Recipients of cord blood HCT had a higher incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD (22.5%) compared to others (12.8%; P=0.029). OS for all patients was 72%; no diff erence in OS was noted between NC, MAC or RIC groups, nor was there a diff erence in OS in patients with malignant disorders and non-malignant. OS was higher in recipients of fully matched related donor HCT (75%) when compared to recipients of partially matched related donor HCT (60%) and unrelated cord HCT (67%; P=0.028). Acute aGvHD grade II-IV and chronic GvHD were associated with lower survival. Conclusions: The data indicate that HCT can lead to long-term survival among VYC. Use of no conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning did not decrease incidence of GvHD and did not improve survival. Recipients of fully matched related donor HCT and those with no evidence of aGvHD or chronic GvHD have better long-term survival.

The patients' preperative regimen were nonmyeloablative with fl udarabine, low dose cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) except one patient who was taken thoraco-abdominal irradiation. Results: The median follow up was 10,5 months (1-75 months). The 5 year estimate of overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort was 76%. It was 58%, 100% and 100% when the donor was an HLAidentical sibling, an UD and a relative. Transplant related mortality was 9% (in the fi rst years of our transplant center).

ABO and Rh typing was performed by standard blood banking methods. The clinical endpoints in this retrospective study were incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), venooclusive disease (VOD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM) according to blood group incompatibility. Univariate analysis was performed using chi2 test, all P values are 2-sided and P less 0,05 is considered to indicate statistical signifi cance. Results: From the whole cohort of 138 allogeneic transplants, blood group incompatibility was observed in 57% (78) and was signifi cantly higher among MUD (67% i.e.36/54) than in MRD (50% i.e.42/84) (p= 0,04). Both in compatible and incompatible transplants more frequently as source were used PBSC (58% and 68% respectively). Major AB0 incompatibility was seen in 23 (30%), minor in 30 (38%), bidirectional in 14 (18%) and Rh in 11 (14%) patients. Combined Rh and AB0 incompatibility was seen in 20 patient/donor pairs, including 7 cases with major, 9 with minor and 4 with bidirectional AB0 incompatibility. There was no related acute haemolysis during graft infusion in the whole cohort. During engraftment time, one patient developed haemolytic crisis 9 days after HSCT. One boy suff ered from pure red cell aplasia with resolution upon corticoid treatment. Incidence of acute GVHD II-IV was signifi cantly higher in mismatched 50% vs 35% matched patients (p= 0,01). There was no diff erence in the incidence of chronic GVHD (30% vs 41%, p= 0,10). We observed that the type of AB0 incompatibility does not infl uence the incidence of acute nor chronic GVHD (p=0,33). VOD occurred in 7% (4/60) matched and 12% (9/78) mismatched pairs with no statistical diff erence (p=0,33). In the whole cohort TRM was 14,5% and there were no diff erence between groups (15% and 14%, p= 0,91).

            "text": "Background: The prognosis of very high risk group acute lymphoblastic leukemia (VHR ALL) in childhood is generally poor in spite of intensive chemotherapy. Recently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) was used to treat the patients with VHR ALL. We studied the clinical course and outcomes of children with VHR ALL intended treat with Allo-HSCT after chemotherapy. Methods: 16 children who were diagnosed as VHR ALL and were intended to treat Allo-HSCT at the department of Pediatrics in Ajou University Hospital between June 2001 and June 2010. We analyzed their cumulative survival rate and clinical characteristics among them. Results: Among 148 ALL patients, 16 (10.8%) were classifi ed as VHR ALL. Eight of them had Philadelphia chromosome, four were infant ALL with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement, seven had hyperleukocytosis. Fourteen received Allo-HSCT and the other two could not received Allo-HSCT. Bone marrow or central nervous system (CNS) relapse was the main cause of mortality in the patients who received Allo-HSCT. Event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in all patients were 64.7% and 57.7%, respectively. EFS in the patients Philadelphia chromosome, infant ALL with MLL gene rearrangement and hyperleukocytosis were 58.3%, 100% and 37.5% respectively. Conclusion: EFS in patients with hyperleukocytosis at the time of diagnosis is as low. Therefore novel or additional aggressive treatment modalities may be required in hyperleukocytosis patients. However infant ALL with MLL gene rearrangement was used bulsulfan/cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimens may have promising survival outcomes. Introduction: Germ-cell tumors (GCTs) represent 3% of all pediatric neoplasms. The origin can be gonadal or extragonadal and extracranial or intracranial. The role of high dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in high risk or relapsed patients (pts.) with GCTs is controversial but long term remissions could be observed. Patients and methods: We present 9 patients (males:2, females:7) who received HDC and AHSCT in Hungary between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2012. The median age at transplantation was 2,84 years (range 0, 5-15,9 years) . Seven out of 9 pts had extragonadal extracranial tumor, 1/9 had intracranial and 1/9 had ovarian tumor. All children were transplanted with peripheral stem cell grafts. Patient's stem cells were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor at a dose of 10 microgram/kg subcutaneously twice daily. The following conditioning regimens were used: Cyclo/VP16/Carbo/Thio/Mel (4 patients), VP16/Carbo/Thio (2 patients), and Cyclo/VP16/Carbo, or Bu/Thio/VP16 or Bu/Mel (1 patients each). Results: The mean infused CD34 cell dose was: 5.84x 10*6/kg (range 2,5-12,84). Engraftment was achieved at the median time of day +10 (range 9-11). The median follow up time from transplant was 1,58 years (range 0,44-4,11). All relapses occurred within one year after AHSCT, and both patients had died. Even there are not enough data for a statistical analysis, the survival of 7 out of 9 pts is a very promising result in a high risk group of cases. All deaths occurred due to a therapy resistant relapse, and there was no treatment related mortality (TRM).",

Roncon IPO Porto (Porto, PT) The collection of haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) by aphaeresis is a well established procedure with documented advantages, in both adult and paediatric patients candidate to autologous transplant. The adverse reactions associated with the procedure are few, and of low to moderate severity, allowing for the collection of younger and lighter patients. We aimed to retrospectively analyse the HPC collections performed in our patients with very low weight. From 2004 to 2011, we collected HPC for autologous transplant in 7 children with a weight \u226410kg and a diagnosis of neuroblastoma. In all cases a two way central venous catheter was inserted, in order to begin collection on the 5th day of mobilization with G-CSF (11\u03bcg/kg/day), on the Cobe-Spectra\u00ae cell separator. The kit was primed with one compatible packed red cells unit, with adjusted haematocrit. Two children were transfused with packed red cells after the collection due to a haemoglobin count <7.5 g/dL. There was no need for platelet transfusion as all present a post collection count of >100.000x106/L. The anticoagulant used was ACD-A. In order to prevent citrate toxicity, serum calcium levels were measured (at baseline, every 30 min and after the procedure), and was correct by continuous perfusion, according to clinical or laboratory results. Our group of patients consisted in 1 boy and 6 girls, with a median age of 10 months (7 -55) and weight of 9 kg (6.7 -10) . An average of 3 blood volumes (2 -4) were processed at a rate of 14 ml/min (11 -25). On the fi rst day of collection, the median CD34 cell count was 29/ \u03bcl (1-94), with a total CD34 cell dose collected of 8.6x106/ kg (3.8-39.79 ) in 5 children. In 2 of the children a 2nd mobilization was necessary, performing 1 additional aphaeresis in one case (5.5x106/kg) and 2 in the other (29.8x106/kg). The collection of HPC by aphaeresis in small children is an efficient and well tolerated technique, performed in most cases as an outpatient procedure. This success is the result of a multidisciplinary team with specifi c training in aphaeresis, supported by an haemotherapy specialist, an oncology paediatrician and a clinical pathologist.",

Aim: We analyzed whether AB0 mismatch aff ects: the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements, risk of early and late transplant related complications (TRC), mortality (TRM), relapse and overall survival (OS). Material and Methods: The data of 73 patients (pts) transplanted from siblings (30) and unrelated donors (43), because of neoplastic (47) and nonproliferative (26) disease was analyzed. There were 21 girls and 52 boys, with a median age of 9 (0-21) years. 58 pts were assigned to myeloablative, 14 non-myeloablative regimens and 1 was transplanted without conditioning. The main source of graft was bone marrow (60) and in 13 pts mobilized peripheral blood. Minor, major or bidirectional AB0 mismatched HSCT was performed in 19, 22 and 4 pts, respectively. Remaining 28 HSCT were AB0 matched. In major AB0 mismatch RBC and plasma were depleted, but in minor plasma was removed. Results: The median follow-up was 25 (0.4-93) months. The pts were balanced within presented above group with respect to gender, age, disease, clinical status, donors, conditioning regimens, GvHD prophylaxis, graft source, G-CSF using, counts of CD34, NC, CD3 cells. All pts except 1 engrafted. The results of myeloid and platelets engraftment were similar in all group (P>0.05). Most of pts were supported with RBC transfusion. Median duration of this support was: 46, 49, 55 and 110 days and median volume was: 38, 41, 39 and 75 ml/kg, respectively in above mentioned groups and these results were not diff er (P>0.05). No severe hemolytic reactions were noted. The frequency of venoocclusive disease was higher (P=0.009) in minor AB0 mismatch. Chronic GVHD was observed more often in major AB0 mismatch (P=0.033) but its extensive form occurred more often in bidirectional mismatch (P=0.045). The probability of TRM within the 1st 100 days, 1st year and at the end of follow up was higher in minor AB0 mismatch (P=0.002, P=0.004 and P=0.001, respectively). OS within 1st 100 days was signifi cantly lower in minor AB0 mismatch (P=0.009) and lower but not signifi cantly within 1st year (P=0.099), and at the end of follow-up (P=0.064). Conclusion: In the pediatric setting minor AB0-mismatched HSCT might have an unfavorable impact on transplant outcomes.",

As a decisive prophylaxis and antibiotic therapy of bacterial and fungal infections usually allows control of infections for many years, the indication for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) has been confi ned to patients for whom HLA-identical donors can be identifi ed. We report on a patient with a positive family history for X-linked CGD who was diagnosed at birth. Even though antibiotic (Cotrimoxazole) and antifungal (Itraconazole) prophylaxis was commenced in early infancy, the patient suff ered from recurrent lymphadenitis, chronic infl ammatory bowel disease and multiple bacterial pneumonias. At the age of 10 years he developed pulmonary aspergillosis with fungal osteomyelitis of his 4th rib, which could neither be controlled by repetitive surgery nor systemic antibiotic and antifungal therapy for a period of more than 4 months. As no HLA-identical donor could be identifi ed, he received a T-cell depleted haploidentical transplant (donor: father; CD34+:1x10e7/kg; CD3+: 0,8x10e4/kg) after conditioning with Busulfan (17,6mg/kg), Fludarabine (150mg/m2), Thiotepa (10mg/kg) and Campath (1mg/kg). Even though T-cell recovery is still incomplete (CD3+: 600/\u03bcl) the patient is free of any severe infections after more than three years of follow up. Summary: In selected patients with CGD and invasive infections, not manageable with conservative or surgical measures, HLA-haploidentical HSCT is a feasible therapeutic option in the absence of an HLA-identical donor. By gene therapy-as another alternative treatment option-permanent cure could not be achieved until present. Since patients with CGD have an isolated defect of phagocytic cells they are most probably less threatened by viral disease after T cell depleted HSCT with prolonged T-cell recovery as patients with malignancies or lymphoid immunodeficiencies.",

Known genetic causes include mutations in PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, and STXBP. HLH is rapidly fatal in the absence of specifi c treatment. Remission from overwhelming HLH is required prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative approach. A major breakthrough was achieved through the HLH-94 protocol, a combined chemo-and immunotherapy that greatly improved the survival of children with HLH, but only 71% of the patients survived until HSCT. Objectives: As HLH is a primary T (NK) cell immunodefi ciency with massive CD8 T lymphocyte infi ltration and macrophage activation, we hypothesized that immunotherapy may be less toxic by targeting directly the T cells that are primarily involved in triggering HLH while sparing myeloid cells. So far, Anti T cell polyclonal Antibodies, (Antithymocyte globulins, ATG) associated to steroids and cyclosporine have been used successfully in HLH, as previously reported by our group. The humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) effi ciently depletes T cells in vivo, as well as B cells and other lymphoid subsets. As Alemtuzumab does not activate T cells, it may be better tolerated than ATG, notably in infants, and may improve survival until HSCT. Methods: We analysed retrospectively our experience of 16 consecutive patients who received Alemtuzumab combined with steroids as fi rst line therapy for HLH. Results: The patients presented severe HLH of early onset (0-527 days of life, median 33). Eight patients had CNS disease at onset. Mutations in the known FHLH genes were found in all but two patients (PRF1 in 10, UNC13D in 2, STX11 in 1 and STXBP2 in 1). Patients received a total dose of 2.5 to 6.5 mg/kg of Alemtuzumab. Complete remission prior to HSCT was obtained in 12 (time to achieve remission: 15-35 days, median 30), partial remission in 3 patients, who then received ATG. Only 1 out of 16 patients did not respond to Alemtuzumab, nor to VP16 as second line treatment. Survival until HSCT was 100%, overall survival after HSCT 62,5%. Conclusion: We observed acceptable toxicity and excellent response rates in 16 consecutive patients treated with Alemtuzumab as fi rst line therapy for HLH. Our preliminary data suggest that immunotherapy with Alemtuzumab may represent a valuable alternative to ATG in the treatment of HLH. A prospective multi-centre study is indispensable and will be started in France.",

Zaidman (1) Introduction: Hurler disease is rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder caused by defi ciency of \u03b1-L-iduronidase. Clinical features include progressive courses with severe multiorgan system involvement and short life expectancy. The only option to long-term outcome is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Aim and objectives: To review the outcome of 6 patients with severe mucopolysacharidosis (MPS) type IH, Hurler syndrome, who underwent HSCT between the years 2000-2012 in one medical center in Haifa, Israel. Median age was 15.5 months (9 -25 mo). Three patients received Matched sibling donor (MSD), two patients Mismatched family donor (MMFD), one underwent two SCT MMFD, and one patient got unrelated cord blood. All children received myeloablative conditioning regimen. One patient received intravenous enzyme replacement therapy before and 6 months after HSCT. Results: Four patients are alive with median follow up -7.8 yr ( 3 m -12 yr). Two patients have full donor chimerism and two have stable mixed chimerism. Only 1 child had symptoms of aGVHD grade II, no patient had cGVHD. Two patients died from pulmonary hemorrhage during engraftment period. Long-term followup revealed mild developmental delay in 3/4 patients but no regression. 2/4 had nonprogressive mitral and aortic thickening. All four have hearing problems necessitating hearing aids and progressive corneal opacities to various extents. All patients have orthopedic problems: three -severe kyphoscoliosis, two kids have hip dysplasia, two patients underwent bilateral surgical repair of severe genum valgum. Conclusions: HSCT can prolong survival and preserve cognition in very young children with the most severe form of MPS I. Some clinical manifestations appear to be irreversible and continue to progress despite HSCT. Better tissue matching techniques, improved graft-vs-host prophylaxis and more targeted conditioning regimens have improved morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT. Objective: According to the protocol GPOH-SAA-94 children diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and a matched sibling donor (MSD) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as fi rst line therapy whereas immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine was given to patients without a donor. Here we report the outcome 88 children with SAA (46 male/42 female) included in the study GPOH SAA 94 given an allograft from a MSD between 12/1993 and 06/2011. Patients and Transplant Procedure: Median age at diagnosis of very severe (53), severe (29) and non-severe (6) AA was 10.4 (1.9-16.5) years. SAA was associated with exposure to drugs/toxins (2), hepatitis (8), other infections (4) or idiopathic (74). All patients were transplanted following preparation with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) after a median time of 46 (7-251) days. Source of stem cells was bone marrow (85) or peripheral blood (3) . Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine and methotrexate in the majority of patients. Results: Neutrophil engraftment was observed in all patients after a median time of 19 (6-45) days. Eight patients experienced secondary graft failure (GF). Two of these died during the subsequent HSCT, 3 were rescued with a second allograft and 3 are alive following other therapies (none (1), immunosuppressive therapy (1), cytokines (1)). Complete donor chimerism (> 90%) was detected in all but 6 patients without GF (miss. data on 16 pts). Acute GvHD grade II-IV and grade III-IV occurred in 8 (9%) and 2 (2%) patients, respectively. Twelve out of 86 patients at risk (14%) developed chronic GvHD that was extensive in one patient. After a median follow up of 5.9 (0.73 -17.7) years 84 patients are alive; resulting in a probability of overall survival of 0.95 (0.91-0.99). Two patients died following fi rst HSCT due to acute toxicity (cardiac arrest) and fulminant aspergillosis, two patients died during second and third HSCT for GF. pOS was signifi cantly better for patients transplanted more recently (0,91 \u2264 2000 vs 1,0 > 2000, p=0.049). There was no diff erence in pOS, incidence of GF or occurrence of acute or chronic GvHD according to disease severity, interval from diagnosis to HSCT, type of ATG used during conditioning, number of transplanted cells and CMV status of donor and/or recipient. Conclusion: MSD HSCT following conditioning with cyclophosphamide and ATG is a safe and eff ective therapy for children with SAA.",

A third developed recurrent SAA secondary to parvovirus infection at 19m post-HSCT and underwent successful retransplantation from the same donor. The fourth had persistent HSV infection and has only 19% WB chimerism at 14m post-HSCT. Conclusions: Despite excellent long term survival and low rates of GVHD, CD3 chimerism was predictive of outcome after IVTCD HSCT in paediatric SAA. High CD3 chimerism at one month correlated signifi cantly with GVHD, and CD3 chimerism of <10% with engraftment problems.

The preparative regimen was classifi ed as RIC if it included non-myeloablative chemotherapy (total dose of busulfan \u2264 8 mg/kg or <280mg/m2) with or without total body irradiation (TBI) \u2264 8 Gy. Also, MAC included myeloablative chemotherapy (total dose of busulfan \u2265 9 mg/kg or >280mg/m2) with or without TBI > 8 Gy.",

In this work we evaluate clinical and immunological factors that should be considered when selecting donors for T cell depleted haplo-SCT. Methods: From 2005 through 2012, we retrospectively analyzed 48 haplo-SCT outcomes in 45 children performed in our center. In 22 patients the diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, in 13 patients was acute myeloblastic leukaemia, and in 4 patients was myelodisplastic syndrome and in 6 cases the diagnosis was solid tumours. Patients were in fi rst complete remission (17), second complete remission (17), third complete remission (7) and progressive disease (4) . Conditioning consisted in a fl udarabinebased reduced intensity regimen without serotherapy. In 26 cases donor selection was performed based in donor-recipient HLA-I studies and in 22 cases donor selection also included donor KIR receptor, KIR haplotype and in vitro Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity studies. Results: The mother was chosen as donor in 34 haplo-SCT (71%), the father in 11 (23%) and a brother or sister in 3 cases (6%). The median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were 13 days (10-21) and 11 days (8-21). Graft failure probability was 30\u00b16%. Primary graft failure occurred in 6 (12%) and secondary graft failure in 8 (17%) haplo-SCT. From failure engraftment patients 10 (71%) are alive without evidence of disease. Acute graft-versushost disease (aGVHD) more than grade II probability was 15 \u00b1 5%. Relapse rate was 30\u00b18%. Transplant-related mortality rate was 25 \u00b1 6%. With a median of follow up of 2 years, survival probability was 52\u00b17% and dependent on disease status (fi rst remission vs. more advanced disease; HR = 45.5; P = .02), aGVHD (less than II vs. more than II; HR: 0.12; P=0.001) and donor KIR ligand group (C1C1 vs. no C1C1; HR=0.14, P=0.034). Although no statistical diff erences were found between how we chose the donor, we observed a tendency to improve overall survival (64\u00b11 vs. 41\u00b11, P=0.1) and relapse free survival (81\u00b109 vs. 56\u00b11, P=0.1) when we chose the donor including donor KIR receptor, haplotype and NK cell cytotoxicity studies.",

Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI ) titers to infl uenza virus antigens as well as complete blood count, quantitative CD4, CD8, and CD19 and serum IgG were measured prior to the fi rst TIV dose and 28-35 days later. Results: Forty-four subjects were enrolled (19 in year 1 and 25 in year 2) at a median of 7.9 m after allo-SCT (range, 5.7-105.6 m). The median age was 50.1 y (19.6-72.8), 61.4% were male, 100% white. The most common reasons for transplant included AML, ALL, and MDS. 29 subjects were given HD and 15 SD.

Two patients were hospitalized because of secondary bacterial infections necessitating i.v. antibiotics. The overall 5 year survival did not diff er between patients with and without VZV disease (68% in both groups). Conclusion: VZV disease represents a rather frequent, most often painful and sometimes severe complication after allo-HSCT. In our opinion a safe and eff ective regime for the prevention of VZV disease after allo-HSCT is well motivated at least for patients with risk factors. Background: Blood stream infection (BSI) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a well-known complication during the pre-engraftment phase. Knowledge of trends in etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of BSI are important as the time to eff ective antibiotic treatment is closely associated with survival in bacteremic patients with septic shock. Methods: BSI during pre-engraftment phase was studied retrospectively in 521 patients undergoing HSCT at our center in 2001-2008. Incidence, risk factors, outcome and microbiology fi ndings were investigated and compared with BSI in a cohort transplanted 1975-1996. Results: The incidence of at least one episode of BSI was 21% and the total attributable mortality 3.3%. The rate of gram positive and gram negative BSI was 80% and 13%, respectively. Gram negative BSI was more frequent both in 2001-2004 and in 2005-2008 compared to 1986-1996 (p=0.023 for 2001-2004, p=0.001 for 2005-2008) , with fl uoroquinolone resistant E. coli as the predominant fi nding. BSI with viridans streptococci and E. coli occurred signifi -cantly earlier after HSCT than BSI with Enterococci spp, median time 4, 8 and 11 days, respectively (p<0.01 both for viridians streptococci verus Enterococci spp. and E. coli versus Enterococci spp.). Risk factors for BSI in multivariate analysis were transplantation from unrelated donor and cord blood as stem cell source, while peripheral blood as stem cell source was protective. Conclusions: BSI remains a cause of morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients. The risk for gram-negative BSI increased over time in parallel with an increased rate of quinolone resistance. However, the incidence and attributable mortality of gram negative BSI remained low why continued prophylaxis with ciprofl oxacin is appropriate.",

Maecker-Kolhoff Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Human adenovirus (HAdV) infection is associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The optimal surveillance and treatment strategies are under discussion. Recently, screening of fecal samples has been promoted in addition to blood screening for earlier identifi cation of infected individuals. We performed a retrospective analysis of HAdV PCR results and clinical outcomes in 238 consecutive pediatric HSCT recipients transplanted at Hannover Medical School between Jan 2003 and Feb 2012. All patients underwent prospective weekly quantitative HAdV PCR testing from blood; 111 patients had additional prospective weekly stool PCR screening. The incidence of HAdV-DNAemia was high (50%), and HAdV blood loads >1,000 copies/ml were detected in 15.5% of all patients. 26 patients (11%) displayed HAdV-related symptoms. The mortality rate directly attributed to HAdV seemed low (2 patients; 0.8%), accounting for 5.1% of all deaths (n=39). Blood HAdV load >10,000 copies/ml was a signifi cant and independent risk factor for poor survival. Detection of HAdV-DNAemia before day +50 after HSCT was a major risk factor for the development of HAdV blood loads >10,000 copies/ml. Detection of HAdV in stool correlated with blood loads, but preceded blood loads >10,000 copies/ml only by a median of fi ve days. Therefore, it marginally contributed to early recognition of patients at risk of high blood load HAdV-reactivation. However, routine monitoring of HAdV in stool samples may have contributed to early recognition of symptomatic HAdV-mediated enteritis, which is likely to be underdiagnosed early after HSCT due to frequent non-specifi c diarrhea. Moreover, transmission precautions were initiated after detection of HAdV in stool, which may have helped to control nosocomial spread. Preemptive treatment with cidofovir led to stable or reduced viral loads in 70% of patients. Our data suggest that routine PCR-monitoring for HAdV and preemptive treatment of high-risk patients result in a low HAdVrelated mortality. We recommend preemptive treatment with cidofovir in pediatric HSCT-recipients after detection of HAdV blood loads >10,000 copies/ml or persistent HAdV blood loads >1,000 copies/ml, even in the absence of symptoms. Moreover, we suggest treatment of every symptomatic infection, both localized and systemic. Invasive fungal infection (IFI) has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among HCT recipients. In this study we report an overview on the incidence of IFI by analyzing 10year data collected prospectively on 350 consecutive patients who received an allogeneic HCT in our center between 2001 and 2011. Patient, donor and transplant characteristics are described in Table 1 . We included only IFI defi ned as probable or proven in accordance with published guidelines. We identifi ed 39 cases of IFI (prevalence 11,1%), of which 30 were due to invasive aspergillosis (IA) (22 probable and 8 proven (Aspergillus fl avus 5, Aspergillus fumigatus 3)), 1 to Fusarium solanis infection, and 8 to Candidemia (C. albicans 3, C. krusei 4, C. parapsilosis 1). The median day of onset for IA and Candidemia was day 55 (12-3023) and day 35 (11-187) respectively, whereas the Fusariosis infection occurred on day 140 post-transplant. IA involved lung in 29 cases and brain in 1; Fusariosis involved skin and blood; Candemia occurred in blood (n=6) or in blood, liver and spleen (n=2). Imaging fi ndings in pulmonary IA on CT scan included: macrododules > 1 cm in 13 patients, consolidation in 7, clusters of small nodules in 7, cavitary lesion in 2, and non specifi c ground-glass opacifi cation in 2. The 5-yr and 10-yr cumulative incidence (CI) of IFI was 11.3% (IA 8.9%, Candidemia 2.4%) and 12.5% (IA 10.1%, Candidemia 2.4%) respectively. In univariate analysis there was no signifi cant correlation between recipient factors (age, gender, ferritin, underlying disease, previous transplant, disease risk) or transplant factors (type and intensity of conditioning regimen, stem cell source), and occurrence of IFI, whereas the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and the development of both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were signifi cantly associated with an higher CI of IFI. In multivariate analysis we found 4 risk factors signifi cantly associated with an higher CI of IFI: recipient age > 50 years (Hazard Risk (HR) 1.65 (p=0.05); acute GvHD (HR 1.59, p=0.01); chronic GvHD (HR 1.62, p=0.001; CMV infection (HR 1.37, p=0.003). Five of the 39 patients with IFI died for this complication, in all cases from IA. The 10-yr overall survival for the 311 patients with no evidence of IFI was 42% as compared to 17% of the 39 patients with IFI (p=0.006). These results emphasize that IFI represent a signifi cant complication in HCT recipients. Background: computed tomography (CT) guided bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is widely used for the diagnosis S303 of pulmonary infections, but its diagnostic value and safety in children after allo-HSCT is not suffi ciently studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effi ciency and safety of BAL in diagnosis pulmonary infections in this cohort. Materials and methods: 189 BAL samples from 127 pediatric allo-HSCT recipients were analyzed in 2009-2012. Median age was 8,5 y.o. We performed high-resolution CT guided bronchoscopy with endoscopic video system EVIS EXERA II Olympus with an external diameter of the distal end tubes of the 3.6 mm and 4.9 mm in a specialized endoscopy room or ICU (12%) . Diff erent methods of anesthesia were performed, depending on the age and the degree of respiratory failure of patients with mandatory monitoring of vital functions of the body and oxygen levels. The samples obtained were sent immediately to the laboratory for classic and molecular detection methods. Results: Signifi cant pathogens were detected in n=149(78%) of BAL (bacteria -n=57(39%), fungi -n=56(37%), viruses -n=36(24%), mixed infections -n=34(22%). In 52% of samples from 36 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis fulfi ll EORTC/MCG 2008 criteria the results of galactomannan (GM) tests in BAL fl uid were positive despite negative results of GM tests in serum and microscopy and culture of BAL. P.jiroveci infection was revealed in three patients (2%), mycobacterial infection -in two (1,3%) . No major complications occurred during bronchoscopy. Transitory hypoxemia was observed in 28% of patients, nasal bleeding -5%, and bradyarrhythmia -2%. Conclusion: CT guided bronchoscopy with BAL remains a very important procedure for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections. Complex investigation of BAL fl uid can reliably detect signifi cant pathogens. The use of the indirect diagnostic tests (GM, PCR) signifi cantly increases the diagnostic value of BAL. Bronchoscopy performed with modern video endoscopy equipment and adequate anesthetic can safely be used in children after allo-HSCT.",

The diagnosis of IFD was based on the 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria. Results: A total of 1401 HSCT patients were enrolled. The median age of patients was 30 years (1~66yrs); 62% were male. 75% of them received Allogeneic-HSCT and 25% for Autologous-HSCT. 65.7% of patients' stem cell source was peripheral blood, 3.5% were from marrow and 28.2% were from both of them. 9.6% of patients had previous IFD. 384 IFD episodes were identifi ed among 1401 patients, 100 episodes were proven/probable IFD. The 6 months cumulative incidence, based on the fi rst IFD (proven/probable), was 6.7% overall, and was 2.8% in auto-HSCT, 8.0% in allo-HSCT (12.5% in haplo-HSCT, 11.1% in unrelated matched HSCT, 3.1% in sibling matched HSCT). Lung is the most commonly observed infection site (76.5%, 166/317). 83.9% of recipients received antifungal prophylaxis; Fluconazole (61.4%) was the most used agent. The incidence of proven/probable/possible IFDs in patients with/without prophylaxis was 20.3% and 48.2% respectively. Among 516 patients who received antifungal therapy, empirical therapy (82.0%) was the most common strategy for initial antifungal treatment.

Imahashi (1) Subgroup B adenovirus (AdV) serotype 11 (Ad11) is the prominent pathogen for hemorrhagic cystitis, and occasionally causes disseminated infection with fatal outcome in immunocompromised patients. Due to the limited effi cacy of antiviral drugs, adoptive T cell therapy for AdV has been explored. Although previous studies have identifi ed several T-cell epitopes of subgroup C AdV, those of Ad11 have not been identifi ed. Here, we describe a novel Ad11 hexon epitope restricted by HLA-A*2402, the most common HLA class I molecule in Japanese population, that could be used for adoptive T cell therapy. Ten synthetic Ad11 hexon protein-derived nonamer peptides which bound to HLA-A*24:02 were selected by a computer algorithm and MHC stabilization assay. Weekly stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A*24:02+ healthy donors for three weeks with each of these ten peptides induced INF-\u03b3 producing CD8+ T-cells specifi c for three peptides, referred to as peptides X, Y, and Z. Of these three peptide-specifi c CD8+ Tcells, only peptide X-specifi c CD8+ T-cells produced signifi cant quantities of IFN-\u03b3 against Ad11 infected K562 cells which were transduced with HLA-A*24:02 (K562/A*24:02 cells). Furthermore, peptide X-specifi c CD8+ T-cells eff ectively lysed peptide X loaded K562/A*24:02 cells, but not peptide unloaded K562/A*24:02 cells or peptide X loaded K562 cells, in 51Cr release assays. These results indicate that peptide X is naturally processed in Ad11 infected cells, presented in the context of HLA-A*24:02, and recognized by CD8+ CTLs.",

Background: Pre-emptive therapy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) , has signifi cantly reduced, if not eliminated, the risk of progressing to CMV disease. The question we addressed in this study, is whether CMV viral load , is a predictive factor for outcome. Aim of the study: Test whether maximum CMV load is predictive of survival; if so whether this has changed with transplant eras, or is associated with specifi c donor types. Patients: We therefore studied 940 patients allografted 1990-2010. The donor was a matched sibling (SIBS) (n=468) , a family mismatched donor (n=152), an unrelated donor (UD) (n=247) or an unrelated cord blood (UCB) (n=73). All patients had developed a positive antigenemia, at a median interval of 45 days from transplant. The median number of pp65 antigen positive cells (Ag+) at diagnosis of CMV was 2/10 4 PBMC, and the maximum number of AG+ cells was 7. The median age was 40 years. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative (MA) in 615 and reduced intensity (RIC) in 325. Results: The overall actuarial 10 year survival of the 940 patients with CMV Ag-emia was 43%. It was 45% vs 41% for patients presenting with < /> 2 Ag+ cells (p=0.01) and 50% and 35% for patients with a maximum number of AG+ cells < /> 7 x10 4 (p<0.0001). The diff erence in OS was seen also when selecting patients grafted more recently (2000 -2012) . The diff erence in OS is due to a higher transplant related mortality (TRM) in patients with a high viral load (35% vs 22%, p<0.0001), whereas the cumulative incidence of relapse related death (RRD) is identical 23% vs 21% (p=0.4). The eff ect was evident only in patients grafted from SIBS (50% vs 24%m p<0.0001), and not in patients grafted from alternative donors (42% vs 41% p=0.6) (Fig.1) . It was also more pronounced in older patients (> 40 years of age) as compared to younger patients.",

Methods: Between September 2010 and December 2011, 65 pediatric HSCT patients were prospectively followed for 12 months and were weekly tested for adenovirus in blood and stool. Shedding was defi ned as a positive detection in stool only, systemic infection as positive detection in blood, and disease as infection with Adv associated symptoms. Univariable and multivariable Cox models were used to defi ne predictive factors for shedding in stool, systemic infection and disease with estimated hazard ratio (HR) of event as a measure of association. Results: Cumulative incidence of shedding in stools, infection and disease at 3 months post-HSCT were 39%, 21% and 17% respectively. There was a strong predominance of the subgenus C (55.6%) whereas other species were far less observed: A (11.1%) B (7.4%) D (3.7%) and F (7.4%). Risk factors were age under 6 years,",

Methods: From April 2005 to December 2011, patients (pts), aged<18 years and undergoing a fi rst allogeneic-HSCT were assessed weekly by blood quantitative PCR for BKV, until day + 100. To investigate if the cut-off for HC of BKV-load varied according to the time from HSCT, we considered the maximum value up to two weeks prior to the following time-points: day + 30, day + 45, day + 60 and day +100. A receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to detect the value with higher sensitivity and specifi city > 80%. Follow-up data are as at June 2012. Results: 107 pts, 66 males (62%) and 41 females (38%), with a median age at HSCT of 7.7 years (range 0.7-17.3), were enrolled. The underlying disease was leukaemia or lymphoma in 82 (77%), solid tumours in 1 (1%) and non malignant disease in 24 (22%). The donor origin was: sibling, 32 (30%); matched unrelated donor, 32 (30%); and mismatched unrelated donor, 43 (40%). The stem cell source was bone marrow, 73 (68%), peripheral blood, 13 (12%), and cord blood, 21 (20%). The conditioning regimen was based on total body irradiation in 43/107 patients (40%). At a median time of 25 days from HSCT (range 7-98), 20 pts developed grade II-IV hemorrhagic cystitis (HC): the 100-day cumulative incidence being 19.2% (95% CI 13-29). The 90% of pts had symptoms: dysuria and strangury (83%), pollakiuria (72%), and abdominal pain (67%). The median duration of macrohematuria was 13 days (range 2-71).

A BKV load of 1023 genomic copies/ml had a sensitivity of 100%, a specifi city of 86%, a NPV of 100% and a PPV of 39%. After a median follow-up of 3 years, the overall survival was 69% (CI 58-77). Among the 32 deaths, 13 were due to progression disease and 19 to transplant related causes. Three patients died with bleeding but none of them had suff ered from HC. Conclusion: A BKV load of 1023 genomic copies/ml had the highest sensitivity and a good specifi city to predict HC occurrence by day + 30. The low PPV is consistent with the multifactorial pathogenesis of HC. The most common dsDNA virus infections (whether single or multiple) were CMV (54%), AdV (31%), BKV (23%) and EBV (7%). By transplant type (HCT vs SOT), the most common infections (single or multiple) were CMV (56% vs 68%), AdV (36% vs 20%) and BKV (28% vs 10%). Approx. 30% (95/320) of pts had evidence of multiple (2) (3) (4) (5) dsDNA virus infections; the most common coincident infections in the same pt were CMV+BKV at 34/95 (36%), AdV+BKV at 28/95 (29%) and AdV+CMV 22/95 (23%). Younger age (p=0.0004), black race (p=0.047) and HCT (p=0.039) were significantly associated with multiple dsDNA virus infections. Conclusions: A signifi cant proportion of expanded-access and EIND pts qualifying for CMX001 therapy had evidence of multiple dsDNA infections. Pts enrolled post-HCT, particularly children, appear to have an increased likelihood of multiple dsDNA virus infections. The potential for broad-spectrum clinical benefi t with CMX001 is being evaluated in these pts and will be further explored in future clinical studies.",

Multimer monitoring to detect cytotoxic T cells (CTL) directed against latent viruses (e.g. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)) in patients after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been reported earlier. We reason that successful immune reconstitution of CMV-and EBV-CTL depends on a functional immune response in the donor. Thus, the number of CTL transferred with the graft was investigated. We established multimer monitoring in grafts prior to transplantation and investigated infl uences of (1) sample storage conditions, (2) the apharesis procedure including G-CSF-stimulation and (3) correlation of multimer staining with CMV and EBV serostatus and CTL functionality. We analysed the number of CMV-and EBV-CTL using 6 HLA class I multimers (A*01:01, A*02:01, A*24:02, B*07:02, B*08:01, B*35:01). Functional activity was tested by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot. Antiviral CTLs were analysed in whole blood (WB) prior to and after G-CSF mobilisation (WBM) before apheresis, in samples from the apheresis tubing fi lter (R) and in the graft (G). To detect eff ects of sample storage time and temperature, we repeatedly measured WB samples from patients after HSCT. Staining results in samples after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, stored either at room temperature or 4\u00b0C, were compared to results obtained from fresh samples. Storage at 4\u00b0C for up to 48 h yielded reproducible results. Analysis of 163 samples from stem cell donors showed that the unspecifi c background was signifi cantly higher in R and G samples compared to freshly collected samples. After subtraction of background, percentages of cells stained with specifi c multimer lay within the same range for all sample types. Using a threshold of \u22650.1% multimer positive events in the CD3CD8 subpopulation to identify antigen-experienced individuals, multimer staining results correlated with CMV serostatus in 127/157 and with EBV-serostatus in 61/110 samples analysed. Multimer staining and ELISpot results correlated for 41/62 samples and 16/51 samples after restimulation with CMV or EBV antigens, respectively. Immunodominance of pp65 versus IE-1 (A*02-epitopes) and of BZLF1 versus EBNA3A (B*08-epitopes) was analysed, pp65 epitope yielded higher numbers of CTL in 23/31 patients, BZLF1 in 8/13 patients. Our results show that multimer monitoring can be readily used to quantify antiviral CTL in stem cell donors and grafts. The frequency of CTL is not aff ected by the mobilization and apharesis procedure. Tables I and II summarize the response data. A comparison of reported practices with the expert recommendations is provided in both tables. Similar clinical practice patterns are reported among the majority of PBMT centers with regard to (1) the use of intravenous immune globulin (2) indications to initiate therapy for cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus and BK virus;",

Clinical practice patterns regarding surveillance for late onset CMV was the least consistent and varied from the recommendations of the joint guidelines. 57% of PBMT centers do not monitor voriconazole levels (the lack of recommendation in the joint guidelines and associated clinical practice is incongruent with emerging data). Conclusion: Similar clinical practice patterns regarding infectious diseases, are reported among the majority of PBMT centers which are accredited by FACT in the United States. However, there is reported variation among PBMT centers regarding surveillance for late onset CMV. There also appears to be an evidence-gap regarding the need for monitoring of voriconazole levels among PBMT patients. Introduction: Catheter-related infections (CRI) account for a considerable amount of treatment related morbidity and mortality during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Central venous catheters (CVC) impregnated with antibiotics are considered to reduce CRI, but little is known about the impact in the setting of allogeneic HSCT. Even though this setting is characterized by an accumulation of risk factors for CRI, with long duration of catheterization, high frequency of manipulations (blood samplings, injections, etc.), frequent administration of parenteral nutrition and blood products and neutropenia. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated 117 allogeneic HSCT recipients of whom the fi rst 58 were provided with CVC impregnated with silver zeolite (S-CVC) and the following 59 with CVC impregnated with minocycline/rifampin (AB-CVC). The analysis included all patients receiving the fi rst allo-geneic HSCT in our unit between 05/11 and 07/12 using a nontunneled triple lumen CVC implanted to the jugular vein. Results: The baseline characteristics concerning patient, donor and disease were comparable between the two groups except for the ECOG performance status found to be signifi cantly poorer in the AB-CVC group.",

Early diagnosis is crucial to start conservative medical management (CMM) which appears the optimal strategy for most cases. NEC should be always suspected in Neutropenic pts with abdominal pain (AP), fever (F) In the pts with CRIM F+D+AP were never present simultaneously and US never revealed BWT. US allowed an early recognition of pts with CRIM progressing to NEC, showing abrupt BWT >4 mm, always accompanied by a sudden increase of AP. All pts with NEC were promptly treated conservatively but 1/32 who underwent a small bowel surgical resection and 87% survived. Median time to clinical response from diagnosis of NEC to improvement of symptoms was 24h, even with persistent neutropenia. In conclusion: US allowed to diff erentiate CRIM from NEC. US monitor of intestinal BWT allowed to fi nd progression from CRIM to NEC. The improvement of symptoms during persistent neutropenia indicates that an early US-guided diagnosis of NEC is mandatory to initiate a prompt treatment to reduce mortality. US follow up in ASCT patients is a cheap, not-radiation-based, bedside technique useful to diff erentiate CRIM form a life threatening complication such as NEC. The source of stem cells was bone marrow. Conditioning regimens were NMA (n= 45, fl udarabine, Cy and low dose TBI) and myeloablative (n= 3, thiotepa, fl udarabine and busulfan). All patients received Cy at days +3 +4, tacrolimus and mycofenolate mofetil. Prophylaxis against molds, bacteria, and CMV was used. Three periods after HCT were defi ned: very early (0-30 days), early (31-100 days) and late (>100 days). Results. Overall, viral infections were diagnosed in 72% of patients, fungal infections occurrence in 6%, and bacterial infections in 39% (fi g 1).",

Weissinger Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Adoptive transfer of CMV-specifi c cytotoxic T cells (CMV-CTL) may be a potent therapeutic tool to control CMV infection in immunocomprised patients. However, wide application is hampered by (1) the lack of CMV-CTL in seronegative donors, (2) low frequencies of CMV-CTL in CMV-seropositive donors may lead to insuffi cient numbers of CMV-CTL for direct adoptive transfer and (3) extensive in vitro expansion of CMV-CTL may lead to T cell exhaustion. We aim to optimize in vitro stimulation and expansion of CMV-CTL by generating self-diff erentiating DC (smartDC) expressing CMV-antigens using lentiviral vectors (LV) instead of conventional DC (moDC) diff erentiated and loaded with antigen ex vivo. Two tricistronic self-inactivating lentiviral vectors were constructed expressing the human GM-CSF and IL-4 genes as well as the CMV antigens pp65 or IE-1. Expression of transgenes was verifi ed by lentiviral transduction of 293T cells followed by ELISA and western blot assays. For generation of smartDCs, CD14+ cells were pre-stimulated with IL-4 and GM-CSF and transduced overnight. SmartDCs were phenotyped by FACS for CD14, CD209, CD83 and HLA-DR expression, ex vivo diff erentiated moDC from the same donor served as controls.",

Expression of CMV proteins pp65 or IE-1 was confi rmed by western blot. Monocytes transduced with the LV readily developed DC-phenotype after 7 days in culture without addition of cytokines as determined by microscopy and FACS analysis, which showed expression of DC markers comparable to that of moDCs. These preliminary results indicate that the smartDCs express the transgenes without changing phenotypic properties. Stimulation of T cells from na\u00efve and CMV-seropositive donors is currently investigated and compared to pp65 or IE-1 peptide pool loaded moDC. Expanded T cells will be analysed extensively not only for recognition of CMV-epitopes, but will be subtyped (memory and eff ector; CD45RA, CCR7, CD27, CD28) and analysed for expression of exhaustion markers (PD-1, TIM-3, CD57) and functional activity (intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3, TNF, CD107a, IL-2) in order to generate CMV-CTL that will be eff ective, non-exhausted and display high proliferative and cytotoxic potential. Bckground: An ineff ective immune response may contribute to HBV persistence. The hypothesis was that persistent HBV positive individuals would prone to other virus infection in allogeneic transplant setting. Based on HBV serological marks, the enrolled patients were classifi ed into 2 groups. A group was HBsAg positive,B group was anti-HBs positive. Design and Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients between February 2010 and August 2011 was followed up at June 2012.We investigated the effect of HBV serological marks on early CMV DNAemia following haplo-identical allo-HSCT. Both of donors and recipients with CMV-IgG negative were excluded.

Conclusion: Donor and recipient CMV serostatus and acute GvHD are independent factors for increased CMV reactivation in highrisk MM patients undergoing RIC Allo-SCT. However, we did not fi nd any infl uence of CMV reactivation on post transplantation outcome. CMV monitoring and pre-emptive treatment strategy could in part explain these results. Novel prophylactic measures such as immunotherapy and drug prophylaxis need to be considered in this specifi c group of patients, warranting further prospective studies. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) such as candidiasis and mold infections cause signifi cant morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients in recent years. Micafungin, a new echinocandin, inhibits fungal cell wall \u03b2-glucan synthesis, with potent activity against most species of Candida and Aspergillus. The aim of this observational study was to investigate the effi cacy and safety of Micafungin in prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in high risk adult patients with various haematological diseases receiving haplo-identical allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT). 26 patients were identifi ed. Only 2 patients had a history of possible aspergillosis before transplant treated by voriconazole. The patients received a median of 4 lines (2-7) of chemotherapies before Allo-SCT. Thirteen patients (50%) received at least one prior auto-SCT; and 8 patients (31%) received a previous Allo-SCT. 24 patients (92%) received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC), with Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Total body irradiation (TBI) 2 Gy based (80%), or Fludarabine, Busulfan, and Cyclophosphamide based (8%) or other (4%). while two patients (8%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen with thiotepa. The treatment was initiated at the beginning of the transplant conditioning regimen until the hospital discharge. Patients received a median of 29 infusions (range, 15-85) of Micafungin (50 mg/day i.v. as a 1h infusion). Results: None of our patients discontinued the treatment for drug-related adverse events. Micafungin was not associated with any hepatotoxicity. Only one patient (4%) discontinued the treatment because an early disease progression. At last follow-up, there are 21 patients (81%) who are alive, with a median follow-up of 10 months (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . three patients (12%) dead because disease progression and two patients because graft failure. In all patients no candidas and/or Aspergillus species was documented after 3 and 6 months from transplant. None of our patients presented a positive galactomannan antigenemia >0.5.Four patients presented an acute GvHD grade II and 2 patients presented a chronic GvHD. Conclusion: Micafungin has a good safety and tolerability profi le, with an effi cacy in preventing IFI in this high risk population. Our data provide support for an effi cacy study in a prophylaxis setting, but prospective and comparative clinical trials using Micafungin are urgently needed to defi ne the role of this drug in prophylaxis after haplo-identical Allo-SCT. Background: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a common cause of morbidity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), often associated with BK virus infection. Cidofovir (CDV) is an acyclic nucleoside analogue with a broad range of antiviral activity, including BK virus and thus it has been proposed as treatment for HC after allo-SCT. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 59 consecutive pts (median age 45 years) who received CDV for HC after allo-SCT from 2008 to 2012. All pts were aff ected by hematologic malignancies, 39 had active disease at allo-SCT. Donors were HLA identical sibling (8), family mismatched (39), unrelated volunteer (11), cord blood (1). All pts received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. BK viral load was determined on urine by TaqMan PCR. CDV",

Conclusions: CDV treatment after allo-SCT is associated with a reduction of BK viruria load and HC clinical responses in more than half of cases. Viral reactivations under CDV treatment should be better investigated in the allo-setting, since the long-half life of the drug and its potential nephrotoxicity limits the possibility of concomitant antiviral therapy with other agents.

With this rationale, we designed a study to compare NK cell reconstitution in pediatric patients undergoing haploidentical (after depletion of both \u03b1/\u03b2+ T cells and CD19+ B cells) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) for hematological malignancies who did or did not experience HCMV reactivation. These patients were also compared to a group of patients who were given either intrabone or iv UCBT. Twelve children given i.v. UCBT, 26 children given haplo-HSCT and 14 adults receiving intrabone UCBT were included in this study and analyzed up to 1 year after HSCT. Peripheral blood samples were collected at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation. In agreement with the fi ndings observed in adults given intrabone UCBT, also in haplo-HSCT patients, NK cells achieved a fully diff erentiated stage of maturation more rapidly when a HCMV reactivation occurred. Indeed, a relevant fraction of NK cells expressed a mature phenotype characterized by the KIR+NKG2A-signature 3 months after transplantation in patients undergoing HCMV infection/reactivation (see fi g. 1). However, since in haplo-HSCT patients the graft contains donor-derived NK cells, we cannot exclude that a fraction of mature NK cells found in the recipients represents long-lived NK cells derived from the donor. At diff erence with UCBT patients, in haplo-HSCT recipients we did not observe a signifi cant expansion of the CD56-CD16+ NK cell subset, which represents an aberrant and usually hyporesponsive subset. Remarkably, in all cohorts of patients, we detected the emergence of highly diff erentiated NK cells characterized by the NKG2C+CD57+ phenotype, when HCMV infection occurred. This NK cell subset, that has already been described in both HSCT and solid organ-transplant recipients after HCMV reactivation, could harbour \"memory\" or \"long-lived\" NK cells.",

Therefore, we evaluated incidence and type of infections occurring in this setting during the fi rst 100 days after transplantation. Methods: Data regarding infectious episodes and outcome during the fi rst 100 days after transplantation were retrospectively analyzed for 53 consecutive patients (30 in complete remission and 23 in refractory or recurrent active disease) undergoing haploidentical BMT. Results: The probability of overall survival for patients at 100 days post-haploBMT was 83%(s.d.+5). The 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 30, 2% (s.d.+4). We observed 63 viral infections in 43 patients, 60 bacterial infections in 53 patients and 10 fungal infections in 8 patients. Furthermore, 40 out of 53 patients (75%) reactivated Cytomegalovirus infection, and 20 patients (38%) showed BK viruria. Encephalitis occurred in 2 patients due to JCV and BKV, respectively. A vesicular rash due to adenovirus was documented in 1 patient. Twenty-six (49%) patients had septicemia with or without septic shock, 30 (56%) patients had catheter-related infections, 17 (32%) patients had pneumonia (2 due to infection with a K. pneumoniaecarbapenemase producer and 1 with Chlamydia pneumoniae) and 1 patient had meningitis. One proven, 4 probable, and 3 possible fungal infections were documented in 8 (15%) patients. Overall, 9 of 53 (17%) patients died within 100 days after transplant. For 8 of these 9 patients (4/30 in the complete remission group, 4/23 in the active disease group) an infectious disease (1 hepatic abscess, 3 cases of septicaemia, 2 cases of encephalitis, 1 case of pneumonia, and 1 case of haemorrhagic cystitis) was the main cause of death. The infection-free survival at 100 days was 85%. Conclusion: Fifteen per cent of the patients studied died from infections during the fi rst 100 days post-transplant.

Lindemans, A.B.J. Versluys, A. De Wildt, C.E. Gerhardt, J.J. Boelens UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, NL) Background: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) remains an important cause of transplant-related mortality amongst hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. To improve outcome after HSCT, we need to identify patients who are most at risk. This study was aimed to fi nd predictors of IFI after pediatric allogeneic HSCT. Patients and methods: All children who received allogeneic HSCT in the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital Utrecht between January 2004 and July 2012 were included. HSCT data were prospectively collected. Probable and proven IFI were classifi ed according to EORTC/MSG criteria. We retrospectively classifi ed all patients into high or low risk groups for developing IFI using pre-and post-HSCT criteria, based on available literature. We analyzed predictors for the occurrence of IFI, our main endpoint, using Cox regression models. We used logistic regression models to analyze the association between other HSCT related complications and IFI. Other outcomes were overall survival (OS) and treatment related mortality (TRM). Results: 209 patients were included: 105 malignant and 104 nonmalignant. Donors were 98 cordblood, 54 family/sibling donor and 57 unrelated marrow. Median age was 6.6 years (range 0. 2-22.7) . The cumulative incidence of proven and probable IFI was 12% (n=25). Within patients classifi ed into the high risk group to develop IFI (n=88), 15 patients (17.0%) developed IFI. 52 patients became high risk during post-HSCT course, of which 9 patients (17.3%) developed IFI. In patients classifi ed as low risk (n=69), only 4 (5.8%) developed IFI (OR 0.325; p 0.047). In multivariate analysis, predictor for the occurrence of IFI was an a priori TRM risk >20% (based on EBMT-risk score). Logistic regressive results showed an association between the administration of high dose steroids and the occurrence of IFI (OR 4.458; p 0.010). Patients who developed IFI showed an increased risk of treatment related mortality (TRM) (OR 6.299; p 0.00), and subsequently the overall survival (OS) was lower (p=0.006). Conclusion: We demonstrated that risk group stratifi cation for developing IFI using criteria based on available literature, correlated well with the actual occurrence of IFI in children after HSCT. Pre-HSCT predictor was an a priori TRM risk >20%. Post-HSCT the use of high dose steroids was strongly associated with development of IFI. Risk group stratifi cation should guide intensity of monitoring for IFI and use of anti-fungal prophylaxis.",

Our management algorithm included a comprehensive diagnostic approach for patients with persistent fever (CT scans, microbiological samples and cultures from urine, blood, BAL and other infected sites), as well as preemptive serum galactomannan (GM) tests twice weekly from the start of the risk episodes. Breakthrough IFD as per EORTC criteria occurred in 10 episodes (3.8%, Table 1 ): 5 invasive candidiasis (1.9%; 3 glabrata, 2 tropicalis) and 5 invasive aspergillosis (IA=1.9%; 1 proven, 4 probable), 8 after AML-chemotherapy and 2 in alloHCT/GVHD, leading to 4 IFD-related deaths (1.5%). Of note, 2 cases of IA occurred during an outbreak and co-infection with H1N1. Posaconazole was substituted for IV antifungal therapy in 34 additional episodes (13.0%) based on an individualized clinical judgment for persistent fever, intolerance or side-eff ects. The vast majority of episodes (218, 83.2%) completed posaconazole prophylaxis as planned. A total of 2972 serum GM tests were performed in this study (median 11 per episode, , and were all negative in the majority of episodes (188, 71.7%). Positive GM results contributed to the diagnosis of all 5 episodes of IA reported. Also, positive GM tests were documented in 30 additional episodes (11.4%) where patients remained on posaconazole prophylaxis, alive, and never developed other criteria of IFD. Such false positive (FP) GM tests (1-6 per episode; optical index 0.59-6.11) were more common when performed preemptively in asymptomatic cases (26, 86.7%) than as part of a diagnostic workup in persistently febrile symptomatic patients (4, 13.3%; p<0.001).

The fusion gene encodes for the chimeric oncoprotein BCR-ABL, associated with deregulated constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity, leading to leukemogenesis. The second generation TK inhibitor (TKI) Nilotinib (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) is an aminopyrimidine derivative of imatinib with an increased binding affi nity to the chimeric p210 BCR-ABL, recently approved for upfront use in CML. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is currently reserved for patients (pts) in CP after the failure of second line TKI or for patients in advanced phase disease. SCT remains the treatment of choice in patients with Ph+ALL. TKIs can be used successfully pre -SCT as a bridge to SCT in advanced disease and post-SCT in order to prevent disease recurrence. HCMV is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality post SCT in particular in pts transplanted for advance CML and pts with graft vs. host disease (GVHD) While, preemptive antiviral therapy has reduced the occurrence of HCMV disease post SCT, the use of all currently available antiviral drugs is often limited by toxicity, low oral bioavailability, and drug resistance. The mechanisms facilitating HCMV entry into the host cells are not clearly understood. Blocking the platelet -derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1) has been shown to inhibit HCMV internalization and gene expression. Recently, Imatinib has been shown to inhibit PDGFR\u03b1 phosphorylation. As Nilotinib is a more potent PDGFR inhibitor, we assessed the in vitro antiviral activity of Nilotinib against HCMV. Nilotinib exhibited a signifi cant dosedependent inhibition of the virus upon pre-incubation with the drug. Moreover, Nilotinib demonstrated a ~4.5-fold higher antiviral activity against HCMV when compared to imatinib, with IC50 values of 0.39 \u03bcM and 1.75 \u03bcM, respectively. No viral inhibition was found upon addition of the drugs after viral adsorption -compatible with inhibition of an early step of infection, invoving viral binding/entry into the cell. These fi ndings identify a promising new target for antiviral therapy, representing an alternative paradigm for treatment with compounds combining anti-cancer and antiviral activity. The potent anti-HCMV activity demonstrated for Nilotimib may be of clinical relevance in patients with advanced CML undergoing SCT. (1) Monocyte-derived Dendritic Cells (moDCs) have been traditionally used as vaccines capable of eliciting specifi c T cell responses against tumors and infections. Another innate immune eff ector cell, Natural Killer (NK) cells, endowed with antitumor and antiinfection capacities, have been adoptively transferred to treat against malignancy and pathogens. In our study, we investigate the potential of Aspergillus fumigatus derived \u03b2(1,3)glucan (BG) pulsed moDCs as NK cell manipulators, which might give new perspectives in optimization of DC based vaccines. DCs were generated from positive selection of CD14+ cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured for 5-6 days in serum-free GMP grade medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4. On day 2, immature DCs (iDCs) were maturated (mDCs) with BG or Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). DC profi le was characterized by quantifying the expression of CD1a, CD14, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-I, HLA-DR, CCR7, Dectin-1, IL12p35 and IL15. Autologous NK cells, obtained by negative selection of PBMCs were cocultured with DCs for 24h at a ratio of 1:1. After coculture, NK cells were studied for the expression of defi ned markers, among them were CD69, HLA DR, CD25, CD83, CCR7, cytokines (interferon \u03b3, IFN-\u03b3), transcription factors (T-bet). NK cell cytotoxicity was evaluated against the leukemic cell line K562 via the degranulation marker CD107a. Results: DC-NK cell interaction further increased the expression of costimulatory molecules and HLA antigens as well as the release of IL12p35 onmDCs. In parallel, mDCs stimulated NK cells stronger than iDCs and they potentiated the cytotoxic capacity of NK cells towards K562. In addition, mDCs induced the",

Routine monitoring of EBV DNA-emia (referred to as viremia) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pre-emptive Rituximab therapy are recommended in high-risk patients. We conducted a study to analyse the results of EBV monitoring in a consecutive cohort of these high risk patients. Methods: We prospectively monitored all patients considered at high risk for EBV reactivation and Post-trasplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD) during the fi rst 6 months after SCT (alternative-donors, T-cell depletion (TCD) and/or severe refrac-tory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) by quantitative PCR between 2006 and 2012. Rituximab was given as pre-emptive therapy (375mg/m2 intravenously) for EBV viremia (>1000 copies/ml in whole blood). Results: After a median follow-up of 609 days, 27 of the 131 patients included (21%) developed EBV viremia, for a 1-year incidence of 28.5% (95% CI:18.7-38.3) at a median of day +72 and 12 (9%) developed PTLD for a 1-year incidence of 13% (95% CI:5.8-20.2) at a median of day +90. Factors associated with EBV reactivation and EBV-PTLD in univariate analysis were the same: absence of Rituximab administration before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) (p=0.1 and p=0.01), prior HCT (p=0.02 and p=0.03) and TCD (Campath or ATG) in the 6 months before HCT (p=0.03 and p<0.01), respectively. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with higher risk of EBV reactivation and PTLD were: prior HCT [HR 4.9 (95% CI:1.2-19.9; p=0.03) and HR 2.5 (95% CI:1.2-5.5; p=0.02)] and TCD during the 6 months pre-HCT [HR 3.4 (95%CI: 0.9-13) p=0.07) and (HR 6.4 (95%CI:2.3-18) p=0.01], respectively. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 41% (95% CI: 32-50) and EBV reactivation was not associated with impaired survival (p=0.4). EBV-PTLD was considered the primary cause of death in 4 patients. Comments: The incidence of EBV reactivation and PTLD in our high risk population was 28.5% and 13% respectively. The risk factors associated with their appearance were previous HCT and use of T-cell depletion during the 6 months pre-HCT. The development of EBV reactivation does not seem to be associated with lower OS in the pre-emptive Rituximab-strategy setting. (4), M. Zitkova (5) , Z. Racil (5) , M. Labudikova (6) , J.

Because probably not every transplant center is able to provide it and because more data about the incidence of pneumonia and mortality are warranted, we decided to conduct the following survey. Methods: Prospective observation. Specifi c monitoring cards distributed within Central and East European transplant centers in cooperation with the East Forum EBMT-Nurses Group. Results: In 1/2012-6/2012, total 689 consecutive patients were included into the observation. In the autologous HSCT group (n= 400) the pneumonia developed in 14/400 (3,5%) till day +100 post-transplant (median day +9 (-3 \u00b150)), and was the cause of death in 2/14 (14%) of aff ected patients. There were 239/400 (59%) HSCT performed in single-bed rooms (190/239 HEPA fi ltered) and 161 (41%) in two-beds room (28/161 HEPA fi ltered). There was no diff erence in general mortality till day +100: 4,5% in HEPA vs. 4,9% in non-HEPA fi ltered rooms (p=1,0). In the allogeneic HSCT group (n=289) the pneumonia developed in 24/289 (8,3%) till day +100 post-transplant (median day +11(-2 \u00b175)), and was the cause of death in 11/24 (45%) of aff ected patients. There were 281/289 (97%) of the Allogeneic HSCT performed in singlebed rooms (254/281 HEPA fi ltered) and 8 (3%) in two-beds room (without HEPA fi ltration). The only important and almost statistically signifi cant risk factor for pneumonia development (p=0,05) was corticosteroids treatment for GVHD. There was no diff erence in general mortality till day +100: 14% in HEPA vs. 17% in non-HEPA fi ltered rooms (p=0,6). Conclusion: incidence of pneumonia till day +100 in the autologous HSCT setting is generally very low and autologous HSCT may safely be performed in two-beds rooms and in rooms without HEPA fi ltration. Twice more pneumonia infections were observed in the allogeneic HSCT, especially in patients on corticosteroids, with high mortality rate and predominant fungal etiology. No signifi cant impact of HEPA fi ltered rooms on mortality rate was observed in both autologous and allogeneic HSCT. The limitation of our observation include various antimicrobial prophylaxis used, no data on air-fl ow direction and air-pressure positivity in the rooms, and low presence of non-HEPA rooms in allogeneic HSCT setting in general. Introduction: Invasive fungal infections cause signifi cant morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients. Although fl uconazole has been widely used for antifungal prophylaxis in these patients, it is not eff ective against invasive aspergillosis. Micafungin provides antifungal activity against Candida and Aspergillus species, and previous studies have demonstrated its effi cacy when used as a prophylactic agent for fungal infection in neutropenic patients.",

Patients were randomly assigned to micafungin (50mg/day i.v) or fl uconazole arms (400mg/day p.o.) in the ratio of 2:1. The treatment was initiated within 24 hour of stem cell infusion, and lasted for up to 21 days of post-transplantation. Results: Between March 2010 and August 2012, a total of 74 patients were enrolled (micafungin, n=54; fl uconazole, n=20). The main underlying disease for allogeneic transplantation (n=64) were acute myeloid leukemia (39%), acute lymphoid leukemia (27%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (11%); and multiple myeloma was the most common reason (60.0%) for autologous transplantation (n=10). Baseline characteristics were compared, and there was no signifi cant diff erence in gender, transplantation type (allo vs auto), donor (sibling vs unrelated) and conditioning intensity (myeloablative vs reduced intensity) between two treatment arms. During study period, proven or probable IFIs were identifi ed in 7 of 54 for micafungin arm (13%), and 3 of 20 for fl uconazole arm (15%) (p=1.0). Overall mortality at 100 days after transplant was 14.9% (11/74), and patients who experienced proven or probable IFIs showed signifi cantly higher mortality (6/10, 60%) than patients who did not (5/64, 7.8%) (p<0.001).

Recent epidemiologic studies suggest an incidence of 5-10%. It is now recognised that in addition to cases occurring during the neutropenic post-transplant phase there is a late peak of cases who have chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and are receiving steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. There has been an increasing focus on what host immune factors may account for individuals' susceptibility to IA. We investigated circulating monocytes from this cohort of patients compared with circulating monocytes from healthy controls in a pilot study to determine their ability to phagocytose A. fumigatus (Af ) conidia. Methods: After providing informed consent 7 adult patients with grade II-III chronic GVHD, requiring steroid or other immunosuppression, and 7 healthy volunteers respectively donated 30ml blood each from which monocytes were harvested using the method described by Serbina NV et al, J Immunology 2009, vol 183,pp 2678-87. Briefl y, monocytes were purifi ed and selected using MACS reagents and CD14 magnetic beads and next stained with anti-CD14 label. Af were diff erentially labelled with Alexa-Fluor 647 succinimidyl ester dye. Conidia and monocytes were co-incubated for 3 hours in a ratio of 2:1 following which the numbers of conidia ingested was determined using FACS analysis and confocal microscopy. Viability of the ingested conidia was determined by standard plating on agar medium and counting the number of colony forming units (CFU). Supernatants from each interaction were collected at times 0h and 3h, frozen, and later analysed for pro-infl ammatory cytokines using a 7-plex assay (Meso Scale Discovery).",

The cytokine experiment revealed that patients' pro-infl ammatory responses were impaired; in particular interferon \u03b3 and IL-12 responses were reduced at 3h compared to controls. Conclusion: The study of circulating monocytes' responses to Af deserves further investigation as a potential biomarker of susceptibility to IA in patients with chronic GVHD.

Since then, Dutch pediatric oncology recommendations for screening, drug therapeutic monitoring (DTM) and recognition of azole resistance has resulted in changes in management strategy. Methods: We reviewed data from January 2003 to July 2012 and compared the results to our previous study, to determine whether recent strategies have altered outcome for children with IA undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

In contrast to earlier observations, survival is no longer limited to those children undergoing identical related bone marrow transplantation. Two patients received preemptive granulocyte transfusions (GT) to facilitate a successful transplant, a treatment not readily available in the previous era. Three patients developed proven azole resistant IA and as testing was not available in the previous study no comparisons can be made. DTM revealed the majority of children required dose adjustment to achieve therapeutic prophylactic doses of either itraconaozole of voriconazole. Again no comparison can be made with earlier observations. Conclusion: Proven IA remains an uncommon event in our unit and mortality is low (2%). Changes in clinical practice have seemingly aff ected the timing of presentation. Patients with leukemia and aplastic conditions receiving azole prophylaxis prior to referral, with dose optimization by DTM, may have reduced early HSCT infection. Our study shows that graft dysfunction is a risk factor together with GVHD for the occurrence of IA.

The Brain Supporters Project aims at creating an international data base capable of gathering an extensive collection of radiologic images of brain lesions together with the relevant clinical, laboratory and microbiological data. Starting from this data base the possibility is envisaged to develop an \"intelligent\" software that through the use of multi-dimensional analysis techniques, variational methods and classifi cation procedures taking advantage also of neural networks and Bayesian forecasting models, can detect, highlight and diff erentiate the minimal and yet peculiar diff erences in the \"radiologic footprint\" connected with the local alterations of brain tissue produced by each individual pathogen, thus becoming an objective diagnostic aid not infl uenced by the individual interpretation given by the operator. An internet site will be created, www.brainsupporters.eu, freely accessible to oncohaematologic centres world-wide. The radiologic images with confi rmed diagnosis collected in the data base will then be subject to a blind evaluation (without knowing the microbiologic diagnosis) by a team of specialists belonging to at least two of the Centres taking part in the project, so as to obtain an independent confi rmation of the diagnosis.

But we used VGC therapy again in 3 patients. We observed no CMV disease in early or late period. Severe hematological toxicity was observed in two patients (% 4) that required drug discontinuation. Additionally oral VGC following cessation VGC treatment due to markedly decreasing copies was used in 15 patients. Relapse was observed in only one patient after cessation of VGC therapy in this group. No patients developed severe hematological toxicity. Conclusion: Preemptive oral VGC for CMV infection after allo-HSCT should use safely and eff ectively. Nevertheless, prospective randomized trials should be done to yield defi nitive results. Results: There were no statistically signifi cant diff erence between the two treatment arms (n=119; 68 fl uconazole, 51 posaconazole) for any demographic variables, duration of neutropenia, steroid therapy, and duration of antifungal prophylaxis. Patients who received posaconazole had a lower incidence of proven or probable breakthrough IFD within the fi rst 100 days of allo-HCT as compared to those on fl uconazole (2% vs 15%; p=0.018). While the two drugs were generally well tolerated, mucositis (posaconazole 11.8% vs fl uconazole 0%; p=0.005) and liver toxicity (posaconazole 3.9% vs fl uconazole 0% p=0.18) leading to temporary discontinuation was only seen in posaconazole recipients. Death attributable to fungal infections was seen in 1 (2%) posaconazole recipient and 1 (2 %) fl uconazole recipient (p>0.05). Kaplan Meier analysis of survival at 100 days of transplant was similar between the treatment arms (posaconazole 92% vs fl uconazole 88%; p=0.48). Conclusion: Our experience suggests that posaconazole probably confers better protection against IFD during the early phase of allo-HCT. The issue of mucositis leading to temporary discontinuation of antifungal prophylaxis in posaconazole recipients remains a major concern and may be resolved with intravenous preparation.",

Stanzani, G. Battista, C. Sassi, P. Viale, F. Bandini, F. Bonefazi, M. Arpinati, M. Cavo, N. Vianelli University of Bologna (Bologna, IT) Background: Serum galactomannan (GM) antigen is routinely used to aid the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, but the sensitivity of the test is reduced in recipients of allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) and with antifungal prophylaxis. Methods: We examined the sensitivity and specifi city of a pulmonary vascular occlusion sign visualized by CTPA in allo-HSCT patients with a diagnosis of possible, probable or proven invasive mold disease (IMD) according to EORTC/MSG defi nitions. Patients who received allo-HSCT (n=20) for AML/MDS (n=8), ALL (n=7), lymphoma (n=1), or chronic myelodysplastic syndromes (n=4) underwent CTPA if they had a lesion on initial CT scans suggestive of IMD. IMD diagnosis was subsequently confi rmed on the basis of culture, histopathology and/or antigen results. Results: CTPA was positive in 16/20 of patients, 13 of whom eventually met EORTC/MSG defi nitions for proven or probable IMD (12 Aspergillus, 1 Mucormycosis + Aspergillus). The remaining 3/20 of CTPA positive patients had possible IMD. Among the 4 CTPA negative patients, 3 had bacterial pneumonia, and 1 patient had probable IMD based on GM antigen and CT. In CTPA positive patients, GM antigen was positive in serum of 12/16, and in the bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fl uid of 4/4 patients. Considering only proven or probable IMD, a positive CTPA fi nding had a sensitivity (92%), specifi city (50%), positive predictive value (81%) and negative predictive value (75%) for IMD. Conclusions: CTPA may be an alternative to serum or BAL GM antigen testing for establishing the diagnosis of probable or proven IMD in allo-HSCT patients. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) expose patients to a transient but marked immunosuppression, during which viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The control of persistent pathogens such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV) and Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), will ultimately depend on the restoration of adequate T-cell immunity.",

The virus-specifi c T-cell responses in peripheral blood have been shown to be a good marker of immunological protection, but have not been used for clinical decision making and the guidance of drug plasma levels. Therefore, we performed a prospective clinical trial in and tested 95 samples from adult and pediatric patients after SCT receiving pharmacologic immunosuppression with steroids, Cyclosporin A, Tacrolimus or Mycophenolate. T-cell responses were compared to patients without immunosuppression. T-cell responses were analyzed ex vivo against pp65 (CMV), hexon (ADV) and EBNA, LMP (EBV) using intracellular cytokine staining and CFSE. The T-cell responses in vitro under low, high and supraphysiologic plasma concentrations of the respective drugs were investigated. Under the direct infl uence of steroids, activated, virus-specifi c T-cells underwent apoptosis. Cyclosporin had the strongest inhibition on virus-specifi c T-cell immunity, whereas low therapeutic levels allowed T-cell responses to develop. Relevant diff erences in the frequencies of virus-specifi c T cells could be detected in correlation to the level of immunosuppression. The use of multiple immunosuppressive drugs leads to a reduction in the number of patients with detectable antiviral T-cell responses whereas the strength of T-cell responses (if present) was neither infl uenced by the type nor by the number of immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore detection of virus-specifi c T-cell responses but not the amount of IFN-\u03b3 production could be used to guide the level of immunosuppression in case of viral complications after SCT. In conclusion we could show that detection of virus-specifi c T-cells could be used to guide the level of immunosuppression in case of viral complications after allogeneic SCT, since emergence of in vivo T-cell responses was closely associated with a clearance or reduction of the viral load.

Irrera Centro Trapianti Midollo Osseo (Reggio Calabria, IT) Introduction: Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is increasingly used for prophylaxis and therapy of GVHD in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In some reports of use of MMF in solid organ and bone marrow transplantation a high incidence of CMV disease has been described. Aim of the study: we evaluated the frequency and course of active CMV infection in patients who received MMF compared to who received Methotrexate ( Glass, V. Bastubbe, S. Dingeldein, M. Nickelsen, M. Zeis, N. Schmitz Asklepios Klinik St. Georg (Hamburg, DE) Patients with severe acute or chronic GVHD undergoing intense immunosuppressive therapy have a high risk of severe opportunistic infections frequently determining outcome. Invasive fungal infections (IFI), especially invasive aspergillosis, are frequent and often fatal in such patients. In recent years substantial progress has been made in prophylaxis and treatment of IFI. Posaconazole given prophylactically in patients with severe GVHD has been shown to decrease the incidence of IFI and death attributed to fungal disease in a prospective randomized study. We retrospectovely analyzed whether posaconazol prophylaxis was eff ective in reducing fungal infections in a large allogeneic program. From January 2008 to July 2011 we treated 80 episodes of either acute GVHD grade II-IV or chronic GVHD in 53 patients who received prednisolone at doses of more than 0.5 mg/kg BW. The median age was 52.5 years (19.8 -73.7 years), the median duration of corticosteroid application was 44.5 days (3 -308 days), the median duration of inpatient treatment was 19.2 days (4 -98 days) Our institutional standard operating procedures recommend the use of prophylactic posaconazole (200 mg tid) which was given in 52 of 80 cases. In 28 cases we decided against posaconazole because a less intensive immuno-supression was anticipated at start of prednisolon treatment. In fact this group showed showed a shorter duration of treatment(median 36 vs 46 days) and a lower number of patients with of prolonged usage ( > 44 days) of prednisolone (39 vs 56%) as compared to the other patients . In 16 of 52 cases (30.8%) with posaconazole prophylaxis an interventional treatment with either caspofungin ( 7 cases) or voriconazole (9 cases) was started. FUO / sepsis were the main reasons to start treatment in 8 cases, pneumonia was the leading condition in other 8 cases. Two patients received second-line treatment ( 1 case caspofungin after voriconazole, 1 case voriconazole after caspofungin). In 5 out of 52 cases (9.6%) the EORTC criteria of a possible IFI were fulfi lled. There were no cases of a probable or proven IFI. There was no death attributable to IFI. In patients with severe GVHD and intensive immunosuppression, prophylaxis of IFI by posaconazole results in a very low specifi c morbidity and mortality. ",

Amtsfeld, H. Rohde, C. Wolschke, A. Zander, U. Bacher, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Cancer Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) Toxoplasmosis is a rare and critical early complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly in seropositive patients (pts). Both trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S) and atovaquone (A) have anti-toxoplasmosis activity and may be used for post-transplant prophylaxis as both also have an anti-Pneumocystis jirovecii eff ect. We analyzed the safety and effi ciency of both drugs concerning the development of post-transplant toxoplasmosis as well as toxicity profi les. We retrospectively analyzed 140 consecutive adult pts ( as alternative for T/S due to: elevation of serum creatinin (n=12), bilirubin (n=7) and/or skin rash (n=3). No active toxoplasmosis was reported under continued prophylaxis during one year post-transplant with either T/S or A. However, not unexpected, two cases of symptomatic toxoplasmosis with focal (n=1) and general (n=1) neurologic symptoms were observed at days +119 and +64 post-transplant after conversion to inhalative pentacarinate (which does not have an anti-toxoplasmosis activity) as 2nd alternative due to intolerance to A. A was better tolerated than T/S: a nephrotoxic eff ect measured as serum creatinin elevation \u22651.2 md/dl during fi rst 100 days occurred in 0% of pts in the A group and in 42% of pts (median: day +30) in the T/S group (p=0.006). A hepatotoxic eff ect measured as serum bilirubin elevation \u22651.2 mg/dl in the fi rst 100 days post-transplant occurred in 0% of pts in the A group and in 15% (median: day +17) in the T/S group (p=0.02). Time to leukocyte and platelets engraftment did not diff er between both groups. Nausea and vomiting occurred under both drugs in equal range. Atovaquone is an eff ective drug and was well tolerated by patients, so that can be applied for the prophylaxis in T. gondii IgG positive patients who cannot tolerate trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the allo-HSCT setting. A large prospective randomized trial to support these data is required. Objectives: Mould-active antifungal prophylaxis is increasingly used in patients who are at a very high risk for invasive fungal infections. Micafungin, a novel echinocandin, has been approved by the EMA for the prophylaxis and treatment of invasive candida infections in stem cell transplant recipients and patients with leukemia and prolonged neutropenia. Methods: Between June 2011 and June 2012 sixty-five patients with an anticipated duration of neutropenia of more than 7 days received 100 courses of primary antifungal prophylaxis with micafungin 50 mg i.v. once daily. The median number of days with micafungin prophylaxis was 14 (range, 2-48) starting on the first day of chemotherapy or when ANC counts dropped < 0.5 G/L. Underlying diseases were acute leukemia (75%), lymphoma (14%), myeloma (7%), myelodysplastic syndrome (3%) and severe aplastic anemia (1%). Treatment types were induction/consolidation and/or salvage chemotherapy courses (54%), stem cell transplantation (40%), and other types of chemotherapy (6%). Results: The incidence of proven and probable breakthrough invasive fungal infection according to the revised EORTC/MSG criteria were 6% (6/100) and 3% (3/100), respectively. There were two blood-stream infections caused by yeasts (C. krusei, Trichosporon asahii) and four IFIs caused by non-aspergillus moulds diagnosed by biopsy of either lung or skin lesions. Susceptibility patterns were only available only for the two yeasts showing micafunginresistance only for the Trichosporon asahii isolate. The three cases of probable IFI were diagnosed by CT scan only. During 41 courses of prophylaxis with micafungin patients showed fungal colonization documented by weekly surveillance cultures from various body sites. Species diagnostic of 97 fungal isolates revealed C. spp. in 41 (42%), C. glabrata in 20 (21%), C. albicans in 17 (18%), C. krusei in 7 (7%), S. cerevisiae in 4 (4%), C. dubliniensis in 2 (2%), and C. famata, C. guilliermondii, C. haemullonii, C. parapsilosis, C. robusta, and Rhodotorula glutinis each in 1 (1% each). None of the isolates showed micafungin-resistance. Conclusions: These real-life data on micafungin as primary antifungal prophylaxis in adult patients with hematological malignancies at a very high risk for IFI demonstrate an acceptable low incidence of proven breakthrough IFI of only 6%. Emergence of micafungin-resistant Candida strains during prophylaxis was not observed.",

Vallejo Hospital Universitario Central De Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Background: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a frequent complication associated with high morbidity and mortality rates among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. The use of mould-active prophylaxis (MAP) in high risk patients, particularly in those with active graft versus host disease (GVHD) and those with long-lasting neutropenia, has proved to reduce the incidence of IFI. Our standard practice includes the mentioned approach (use of MAP in high-risk patients S328 cells transplanted. In group-1 the median age was 51ys (19-74) with 68% under the age of sixty; in group-2 the median age was 62 ys (18-71) with 67% over sixty ys (p=0.005). The patients who receveid PEG required fewer days of hospitalization compared to the patients in the group-2 (median days 22 vs 24 respectively), without statistical diff erence (p=0.06). Median time to engraftment, as the time to reach an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 0.5x10 9 /L was 10 days, the same for both groups, with a better trend in the group-1 (graphic n.1). There were no statistically signifi cant diff erences regarding the gastrointestinal toxicity. Mucositis grade III-IV was observed in 23 patients of the group-1 and 11 of the group-2 (p = 0.26). Diarrhea of grade III-IV was observed in 8 and 7 patients respectively in the two groups (p=0.09). Not signifi cant diff erences were observed in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and in the median duration of febrile neutropenia. In our experience, we found a statistically signifi cant diff erence (p = 0.04) about infections documented on blood cultures and other microbiological analysis: 34% in PEG group and 59% in G-CSF group (graphic n.2). In summary both PEG and G-CSF groups, have similar outcomes in terms of ANC engraftment, toxicity and to prevent febrile neutropenia after ASCT. Our experience showed a lower rate of microbiologically documented infections in the PEG group. These preliminary data, although limited, suggest that PEG is safe and effi cacious alternative to daily dose of G-CSF after ASCT. J Romejko-Jarosinska, B. Ostrowska, K. Domanska-Czyz, M.

Therefore, the prevention of IFI up-front has become the major goal in patient care in these high-risk patient populations. Posaconazole seems to be a valid alternative to old triazoles as it off ers both an extended-spectrum activity and an acceptable toxicity profi le. In this retrospective, single-center study we evaluated the effi cacy of posaconazole for the prevention of IA in patients with acute leukemia who underwent Allo-HSCT between May 2010 and October 2012. Methods: A total of 62 patients, 40 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 22 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were analyzed. Primary prophylaxis with posaconazole was commenced on day 0 with a dose 400 mg/bid. Failure of prophylaxis was characterized as progressive clinical or radiologic parameters compared with baseline, and as switch to another systemic antifungal agent. The observation period lasted from start of prophylaxis until to the day +100. Results: Posaconazole prophylaxis failed in 20 patients (32.2%).",

The potential risk factors for failure of prophylaxis were evaluated by multivariate analyses as well as univariate analysis (Table I) . The multivariate analysis showed that the following factors were associated with failure of prophylaxis: remission status of disease up-front Allo-HSCT and type of conditioning regimen. Patients with active disease up-front Allo-HSCT or usage of cyclophosphamide + busulfex as a conditioning regimen were more likely to have failure of posaconazole prophylaxis. In addition, overall mortality (fi rst 100 days) was much higher in the patients having prophylaxis failure (20% vs 0%, p=0.018). Conclusions: Posaconazole was eff ective oral antifungal prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients who underwent Allo-HSCT. However, having an active disease up-front of the HSCT and usage of cyclophosphamide + busulfex as a conditioning regimen were associated with failure of posaconazole prophylaxis. The physicians must identify IA cases as soon as possible in order to guarantee early and adequate treatment to these high-risk patient subpopulations.",

Afanasyev R.Gorbacheva Memorial Institute for Pediatric Hematology and Transplantation (Saint-Petersburg, RU) Background: Gram-negative infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogenic hemopoetic stem cells transplantation (alloHSCT). Aim: To characterize frequency, etiology of gram-negative bacteremia (GNB), factors which determinate mortality from sepsis in patients receiving alloHSCT. Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study to examine frequency, risk factors, prophylaxis, epidemiology, therapy and outcome of GNB in 155 pediatric patients undergoing alloHSCT. The patients after alloHSCT with confi rmed diagnosis of gram-negative sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were included in to the study. The diagnoses of septic complications were provided according to the classical ACCP/SCCM criteria and confi rmed with quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) and semi-quantitative procalcitonin levels. Cultures were provided with BacT/Alert\u00ae and Vitek 2\u00ae technologies. Results: The incidence of GNB was in 39 patients (25%). GNB developed in 38% on days 30-60 and 34,5% after day \u2265100 post alloHSCT. The most common gram-negative pathogens were Kl.pneumoniae 26%, Ps.aeruginosa 26%, Enterobacter cloacae 17%, E.coli 11%, St.maltophilia 8%, Ac.baumanii 6%, Serratia marcescens 3% and Chryseobacterium indologenes 3%. Predisposing risk factors for GNB included disease status, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), use of systemic steroids. Patients were given prophylactic fl uoroquinolones: resistance to this antibiotic was seen in 38% of isolates. Fever, hypotension, a raised CRP and procalcitonin were common fi ndings at presentation. Initial site of infection was lungs in 38%, intestine in 31%. In 86% of cases patients with GNB have respiratory failure, renal failure-55%, liver impairment-41%, coagulopathy-48%. Septic shock was observed in 11 patients (38%). Mortality from GNB was 52% in the group and 73% in patients with septic shock. The involvement of liver and kidney in multiorgan failure was associated with 100% mortality rate. Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Ganciclovir has potent activity against CMV and has been used successfully to treat CMV infection in immunocompromised recipients. However, the suppression of bone marrow function associated with ganciclovir treatment has been of particular concern. We did preemptive treatment of CMV infection with a half-dose of ganciclovir in asymptomatic recipients of HSCT when CMV antigenemia level was under 10/200,000 cells. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis was done on pediatric patients who underwent HSCT at Seoul National University Children's Hospital between July 2010 and September 2012. All recipients were screened for the presence of CMV in blood samples twice a week from engraftment to at least 180 days after HSCT. The detection of CMV pp65 antigen in leukocytes was used as a diagnostic test to determine the need for preemptive treatment. Patients received a preemptive half-dose of IV ganciclovir (5mg/kg once daily) when CMV antigenemia had been detected in less than 10/200,000 cells. If CMV antigen had been detected in more than or equal to 10/200,000 cells, conventional ganciclovir induction therapy (5mg/kg every 12 hours) was administered. Aim: The aim of this study was to establish a method for assessing viral infection/reactivation after stem cell transplantation (SCT) in children using sugar chain-immobilized gold nano-particles (SGNP), which specifically bind to viruses, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Method and Patients: Eleven children with a median age of 9 (range 1.6 to 19) were studied. Their diagnoses include 4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 acute myelogeneous leukemia, 3 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 aplastic anemia. Conditioning regimens were total body irradiation-based in 3, reduced intensity stem cell transplantation in 5, busulfan-based in 2 and other in 1. Four and 7 received grafts from related and unrelated donors, respectively. Five were human leukocyte antigen-matched donors and 6 were mismatched donors. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of methotrexate (MTX) + tacrolimus in 9, and MTX + cyclosporine in 2. Saliva, urine, and whole blood were collected weekly after SCT. Whole blood was separated into WBCs and plasma by centrifugation with ficoll. After binding to each virus was confirmed in vitro, sulfated oligosaccharide-immobilized SGNP was used to concentrate viruses, which were adenovirus (ADV), BK virus (BKV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6), and the concentrated viruses were then quantified by qPCR (abbreviated as Nano-PCR).",

In 2 patients who developed CMV antigenemia, before positive antigenemia, Nano-PCR was fi rst positive in saliva and then became positive in WBCs. With preemptive therapy with ganciclovir, after showing negative CMV antigenemia, Nano-PCR became negative in saliva and WBCs. Discussion: Nano-PCR can detect viral infection/reactivation prior to disease development. Since Nano-PCR was more sensitive than CMV antigenemia, we were able to prepare for the development of CMV reactivation prior to engraftment. These results suggest that Nano-PCR is useful for the follow-up of patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A. Capobianchi, A. Iori, A. Micozzi, G. Torelli, A. Testi, C.

Identifi cation of HHV-6 and 7 infection was done using PCR on serum and/or CSF samples. Results: We performed 109 HSCT on 98 children during the period. Ten patients (10.2%) tested positive for HHV-6 (n=6) or HHV-7 (n=4). The median age of the patients was 10.8 years (range: 4-17 years) . Four were males. Underlying diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=3), transfusion-dependent thalassemia (n=3), acute myelogenous leukaemia (n=2), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (n=1), and medulloblastoma (n=1 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the major complications following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to assess the prognosis of CMV reactivation and to analyze risk factors for CMV infection in children after alloHSCT. We retrospectively reviewed CMV infection episodes in 200 consecutive pediatric patients with a median age of 8 years (range: 0.3-19 years) who underwent alloHSCT between January 2011 and May 2012 in three pediatric transplantation centers. Serological studies before HSCT and weekly CMV infection surveillance by quantitative PCR after transplantation were routinely obtained. All patients were given high-dose acyclovir (HD-ACV) prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment with ganciclovir approach until six months posttransplant. While only one episode was observed in 192 patients, a second episode was developed in 7 and 5 episodes in one. The 6-month cumulative incidence of CMV viremia was 36% (29%-43%) at a median of 36.5 days (range: 4-122 days): 52% (95% confi dence interval 24%-80%) in cord blood recipients (CB), 37% (28%-46%) in marrow (BM) and 31% (17%-44%) using peripheral blood grafts (PBSC), respectively (p>0.05). CMV disease developed in 3 patients (2 colitis, 1 encephalitis). By univariate analysis, risk factors were recipient/donor CMV serostatus (p=0.03), donor type (p<0.001), T-cell depletion (p=0.024), ATG usage (p=0.015) and acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) (p=0.035). In multivariate analysis, CMV infection (viremia and disease) was signifi cantly in patients with grade II-IV aGVHD (p=0.041) and in those receiving grafts from match unrelated donors (p=0.04). At the end of the fi rst six months after HSCT, overall survival rates were not significant for patients who had CMV reactivation or not (76% vs 78%, respectively). These results show that the rate and prognosis of CMV infection is similar to those reported from developed countries and also that our prevention and management program for CMV in pediatric patient following allogeneic HSCT are adequate.

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of high BMI on CMV reactivation in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Objective: To identify the preferential sedimentation location of a number of common microbial cord blood isolates using the Sepax UCB (non HES) protocol. The ANCTC has undertaken this in order to evaluate an appropriate protocol for bacteriology screening. Methods: Six organisms commonly found in cord blood isolates were spiked into pretested cord blood at diff ering concentrations. The blood was processed by Sepax using the routine non HES UCB v306 protocol to ascertain which in fraction the organisms would be preferentially enriched. A 3ml sample from the Buff y coat fraction, Plasma Fraction and RBC fraction was sampled into the appropriate blood culture bottle to ascertain positivity. Concurrently a 0.5 ml sample from each of the fractions was taken and streaked on to agar to verify the purity of the contaminating colony and also to ascertain the microbial concentration in each fraction. Results: The result was a preferential enrichment of microbial contamination in the buff y coat. Although the contamination was often detected in the RBC fraction it was more enriched in the buff y coat leading to the possibility that a low level contamination could be missed during routine testing (missed plasma and RBC tested). Conclusion: Contaminated cords have been transfused with no reported sepsis, no delay in engraftment and no hindrance to the patient's survival. However in these circumstances the individual is treated with a targeted antibiotic therapy alongside the usual broad spectrum prophylaxis antibiotics. There are numerous reported cases of fatal septicaemia as a result of contaminated blood products such as that of a platelet recipient detailed in the 1999 shot report in which a contamination by Staphylococcus Aureus was confi rmed. With this in mind it is conceivable that a cord blood unit contaminated with an organism resistant to the prophylaxis treatment could pose a risk when transplanted into an immunosuppressed patient, despite not having the same growth phase due to the storage the recipient is liable to be more susceptible to a lower infection in the absence of a host defence. It is therefore imperative that high standards are sought in regards to our microbial surveillance as a result a combination of the RBC, Platelet and Buff y coat fractions are sampled into our blood culture system providing a minimum sensitivity (at worst case, i.e. all organisms fractionated into the buff y coat) of 30CFU/ml.

Pierri Azienda Ospedaliera San Carlo Potenza (Potenza, IT) Cytomegalovirus(CMV)remains one of the most important pathogens impacting on the outcome in the hematopoietic stem cell S334 transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Oral valganciclovir (VGC) was demonstrated to have an effi cacy that is comparable to intravenous-GCV in CMV-infection. This retrospective study, conducted since october2007, is aimed at collecting information concerning effi cacy and toxicity of VGC in the setting outpatients allogenic-HSCT recipient (allo-HSCT-r) and autologous-HSCT recipients (a-HSCT-r) at time to onset of CMV-viremia reactivation. Data were available on 121 patients, 93a-HSCT-r and 28allo-HSCT-r. Indication for therapy were diagnosed as CMV-viremia with the CMV-DNA load of higher than 3x10(2) copies/ml (polymerase chain reaction, PCR). The total incidence of onset primary CMV infection is 32% (39/121), 28% (26/93) a-HSCT-r and 46% (13/28) allo-HSCT-r at time of 34 days (4-300) respectively 32 days (13-100) for auto-HSCT-r and 41 days (4-300) for allo-HSCT-r. Patients with a positive assay were treated 90% (35/39), 96% (25/26) of a-HSCT-r and 77% (10/13) of allo-HSCT-r, with VGC900 mg p.o. b.i.d. x14 days followed 450mg b.i.d. until at least 7 days after negative test. The median duration of therapy was 21 days (range14-28 days). Preemptive treatment with VGC started with a median time of 42days , with a median CMV-DNA load of 18x10(2) copies/ml (4.24x10 (2)-154x10(2) copies/ml), 20x10(2) copies/ml (4.24x10(2)-140x10 (2) copies/ml) for auto-HSCT-r and 10x10(2) copies/ml (4.68x10 (2)-154 x10(2) copies/ml) for allo-HSCT-r. The rate of response was 100% as confi rmed by negative weekly assay within 28days with PCR assay. The median time to achieve a negative CMV-PCR was 8days (range [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . A relapse of CMV infection after VGC therapy occurred in 8/35 patients (23%), 3/26 (11%) auto-HSCT-r and 5/9 (55%) allo-HSCT-r. The mean of relapse was 158 days (range 94-367) from transplant, respectively 214 days (range 88-365) for allo-HSCT-r and 265 days (range 88-341)for auto-HSCT-r. Furthermore,the time relapsed between the fi rst and the second CMV reactivation was 170 days (range 47-330), 94 days (range 47-172) for allo-HSCTr, 244 days(range 80-330)for auto-HSCT-r and all of these were treated with the same VGC-schedula. In the safety profi le VGC is generally well tolerated; we observed no signifi cant toxicity, other than moderate neutropenia. Overall, once-daily oral VCG has demonstrated to be a clinically eff ective and well-tolerated therapy for preemptive CMV-viremia in HSCT recipients. Materials and methods. Children and adolescents (160 patients, age 1-21) with ALL and AML after allo-HSCT from both related and unrelated donors were included in the study. Myeloablative (MAC) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was performed in 59% and 41% of patients, respectively. For monitoring of EBV-DNAemia qualitative PCR used weekly from D+1 to D+100. Results: The EBV-DNAemia risk factors were studied on diff erent stages of post allo-HSCT course. The results were subjected to multivariate analysis. On the fi rst month after allo-HSCT (D0-D+30) risk of EBV-DNAemia was signifi cantly higher untill engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cell (HR 36, 06; 95% CI 10, 68, Er =0, 00001) . The factor related to the decreased risk of EBV-DNAemia was the use BM as a stem cell source (HR 0,2; 95% CI 0,07-0,53, Er =0,001) -in univariant analysis the risk was associated with the number of nuclear cells (NC) in the transplant (HR 1,42; 95% CI 1,01-1,97; Er =0,04), while there was no cor-relation to CD34+ or CD3+ cells contents. The risk was also higher in patients with ALL (HR 2, 22; 95% CI 0, 65, Er =0, 094) . On the third month after allo-HSCT the risk of EBV DNAemia was signifi cantly lower in recipients received RIC (HR 0,19; 95% CI 0,04-0,85; Er =0,03), but had a positive correlation to HLA-mismatch grade (one or two loci) -HR 6,41; 95% CI 1, 28, Er =0, 01 . Multivariate analysis revealed the trend to increase the risk of fatal infectious complications in patients with EBV-DNAemia on the third month after allo-BMT (D+61-D+90): HR 6, 77; 95% CI 0, 7; Er =0, 09. Conclusions: Taking into consideration the found relations between NC count and the risk of early EBV infection (D0-D+30) with no correlation of the risk to CD34+ cells or T-cell con-tents of the graft, the risk could probably be attributed to graft B-cell contents. As the risk of late EBV-DNAemia is associated with MAC, recipients after MAC may need more close monitoring for EBV-LPD signs. In these cases EBV DNAemia could also serve as a sign of delayed immune reconstitution leading to increased risk of infectious complications.",

It\u00e4l\u00e4-Remes Turku University Hospital (Turku, FI) Patients with history of invasive infection (IFI) are at high risk of IFI relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Since recurrence of IFI may have even higher mortality rate than primary infection the use of secondary antifungal prophylaxis (SAP) in SCT recipients is highly recommended (EGIL 3 grading AII). However, due to lack of randomized studies, there is no consensus on drug selection or treatment duration. (7), liver (2) and both (2) . Voriconaxole (Vori) was the most often used drug in primary treatment. The median duration of antifungal treatment before SCT was 8 mo (5-112 wk) and the IFI status at transplantation was CR (3) and PR (8). All patients received Ambisome (Amb) as SAP during peri-transplant period. After engraftment 8 patients received Vori (alone n=5 or in combination/sequentially with Amb n=3), 2 patients other azoles and 1 patient died before outpatient phase. The median duration of SAP was 18 wk (6-66 wk) . Among the 7 patients alive, 5 patients are still receiving antifungal therapy. With median follow-up time of 7 (1-24) months there were no IFI related deaths and only 2 possible IFI reactivations, 1 occurring after cessation of SAP after 49 weeks of therapy. Conclusions: SAP is eff ective in preventing IFI relapse and allogeneic SCT is feasible also in patients with history of IFI. However, antifungal treatments were lengthy thereby increasing the costs considerably. More data is needed to guide the use of SAP and to improve the cost-eff ectiveness of treatment.",

Carrabba, S. Marktel, M. Bernardi, J. Peccatori, C. Corti, F. Ciceri San Raff aele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Background: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is increasingly recognized as an opportunistic and potentially life-threatening pathogen in recipients of allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Reported clinical manifestations of HHV-6 infection in transplanted patients are skin rash, interstitial pneumonia, bone marrow suppression and encephalitis. Moreover, some clinical reports suggest that HHV-6 can facilitate the occurrence of severe clinical complications of allogeneic HSCT, increasing transplant-related mortality. Methods: From January 2009 to November 2012, we retrospectively evaluated 48 consecutive adult patients (median age 50 years) who developed positivity to HHV-6 after allogeneic HSCT for high-risk hematological malignancies. Stem cell donors were family haploidentical (34), HLA identical sibling (6) , unrelated volunteer (5), cord blood (3). The viral load was determined by quantitative PCR in cell-free body fl uids. Results: Acute GvHD was reported in 23 (47%) patients (pts), resulting severe (grade III-IV) in 19 of them (39%). In 18 cases we observed a gut involvement, in 13 a liver and in 13 a skin involvement. All required high dose steroids and mostly additional immunosuppressive treatment lines (2 to 4). Only 7 pts solved the GvHD, while a worsening (13) or a persistence (3) of GvHD were reported in the majority of them. Median time from allogeneic HSCT to HHV-6 reactivation was 33 days and the median absolute count of CD3+ lymphocytes was 466/mcl. In 13 pts HHV-6 was detected in plasma, 5 in the bone marrow, 13 in biopsies (gut, liver) or bronchoalveolar lavage, 3 in cerebrospinal fl uid. In these patients with a concomitant GvHD the clinical manifestations of HHV-6 (fever, skin rash, hepatitis, diarrhoea, encephalitis) were frequently reported, leading to use a specifi c antiviral therapy in the majority of them (foscarnet in 9 or ganciclovir in 5 or both in combination in 3 cases). The mortality rate was relatively high in this population (only 30% of pts were alive). Conclusions: HHV-6 reactivation is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients who developed acute GvHD after allogeneic HSCT. The regular monitoring of HHV-6 DNA in allogeneic HSCT recipients, using a real-time PCR assay, may be useful for identifying active HHV-6 infection and for the introduction of a pre-emptive treatment, possibly reducing the incidence of the most severe clinical complications. Objective: Our previous research has provided the evidence that an autoreactive immune system can be \"reset\" into a healthy, tolerant state by immunoablative treatment followed by transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Nevertheless, disease fl ares may occur in a subset of these patients post-HSCT. Here, we longitudinally analyzed the immune reconstitution of the patients to identify predictive markers for favorable long-term responses. Patients and Methods: Since 1998, 10 patients with refractory SLE received a CD34\u00b1selected autologous HSCT after conditioning with ATG and cyclophosphamide as part of a monocentric phase I/II clinical trial. Autoantibody titers were evaluated with ELISA, peripheral T-and B lymphocyte subsets immunophenotyped using multicolor fl ow cytometry. Results: Clinical remission (SLEDAI \u2264 3) could be achieved in all patients, despite immunosuppressive drug withdrawal, associated with disappearance of anti-dsDNA antibodies and marked reduction of protective antibodies in serum. Unfortunately, two patients died due to transplant-related infections. From the remaining eight patients, fi ve patients are in long-term clinical remission for up to 14 years after HSCT, while three patients suff ered a relapse of SLE at 18, 36 and 80 months post-HSCT, respectively. Patients with early relapses (\u2264 36 months) had lower baseline complement levels (C3 \u2264 67 mg/dl), showed persistence of antinuclear antibodies, less signifi cant reduction in protective antibody levels and had slower repopulation of CD31+ CD45RA+ thymic-derived CD4+ T cells after HSCT (<100/\u03bcl at 18 months) compared to longterm responders. In addition, fl ow cytometric analyses revealed an expansion of peripheral blood plasmablasts and increased coexpression of Siglec-1 on monocytes (as surrogate marker for type-I interferon signature), preceding the clinical fl ares by ~ 6 months. Conclusion: Low baseline complement levels, persistence of antinuclear antibodies and delayed thymic reactivity post-transplantation could be identifi ed as risk factors for development of lupus fl ares after HSCT. Since ATG-mediated cell lysis is complementdependent, we conclude that low serum complement is directly associated with incomplete depletion of immunologic memory cells in these patients and may provide a rationale for complement substitution before the conditioning with ATG. Moreover, lupus fl ares may be predicted individually by fl ow cytometry with plasmablast expansion and recurrence of type-I interferon signature. Objective: Only 70-80% of patients with chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) respond satisfactorily to the established 1st line immunomodulatory treatments. Autologous Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) has been performed in a few therapy-refractory cases with CIDP. We describe the results of AHSCT in 11 Swedish therapy-refractory CIDP patients with a median follow-up time of 30 months. There were 10 males and one female. The median age at transplantation was 57 years. Method: Data was gathered retrospectively for AHSCT between 2002 and 2012 in patients with CIDP refractory to 1st and 2nd line immunomodulatory treatments. Stem cells were mobilized with Cyklophosphamide(Cy)+G-CSF in 9 and Rituximab+G-CSF in 2 patients.Cy conditioning regimen was administered before AHSCT in 1,Cy+ATG in 6, Melphalan in 1 and BEAM+ATG in 3 cases. Functional disability was measured using the Infl ammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) as well as the Rankin scales. Results: The mean INCAT group score within one month prior to HSCT was 6.4 and the Rankin score 4. Total INCAT and Rankin scores improved signifi cantly already within 2-6 months and continued to do so at last follow-up. Mean Compound Muscle Action Potentials (mCMAP) levels measured by electromyography (EMG) of motor nerves improved signifi cantly within 11 months (median) after AHSCT correlating with level of decrease in INCAT scores compared to pretreatment levels. Only two of the 11 patients relapsed 2 and 5 years respectively after AHSCT, requiring retransplanation in one case. All 11 patients maintained remission (drug-free in 6 cases) upon last follow-up. AHSCT was safe but in a short term associated with a risk of CMV and EBV reactivations, but also CMV disease and hemorrhagic cystitis. Conclusion: AHSCT seems to be effi cacious for CIDP, with manageable complication profi le, and should be considered early in patients judged to be treatment-refractory to the established 1st line treatment modalities.",

We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 8 pts (6 women, 2 men), 35(30-48) years old, who underwent AHCT for SS in our unit. The pts were transplanted for severe progressive disease post 3(2-7) lines of immunosuppressive treatment, including cyclophosphamide (Cy) pulses in 7/8 pts [total dose 6(2.5-12) g] and at a median (\u0394 m) time of 4(2-13) years post disease diagnosis. The \u0394 m modifi ed Rodnan skin score was 32(2-49) out of 51. All pts presented joint, lung and gastrointestinal involvement. Peripheral hematopoietic stem cells were mobilized with Cy 4g/m2 and GCSF without major complications. The conditioning regimen used was Cy 200 mg/kg plus ATG 7.5 mg/kg and pts received 6(3.9-8.65) x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells. Engraftment was prompt and sustained in all pts, at a \u0394 m of 10(7-14) days for neutrophils, 9(5-13) for platelets and 7/8 pts were discharged on day +14(13-38). A female pt with severe and rapidly progressive disease, post 7 lines of immunosuppressive treatment, died on day +87 from sepsis and multiorgan failure. In the rest of the pts the complications observed were: pneumothorax during central line catheter placement (1), neutropenic fever (6), mild pulmonary infection (1), BK polyoma virus hemorrhagic cystitis (1), herpes zoster (1), CMV (2) and EBV (4) reactivation. Modifi ed Rodnan skin score was improved post-transplant and was 15 at +3 months (m) and signifi cantly lower 7(2-18) post 32 (14-87) m in 5/7 pts who could proceed to our unit for further follow-up. With a \u0394 m follow-up 20 (4-87) m, all pts referred improvement or complete remission of dysphagia symptoms and signifi cant improvement of performance status. Respiratory evaluation revealed stable FEV1 and DLCO in 3, improved in 2, asymptomatic mild progression in 1 and clinically symptomatic progression (15m post-transplant) in another pt. Until now 5/7 pts are off further treatment. One female pt was diagnosed with sarcoidosis at +27m and is under corticosteroid treatment. With the limitations of a retrospective study and the small number of pts, AHCT seems to be a valuable treatment in selected pts with SS off ering them a better quality of life.",

In neoplastic pts, median time to PMN and PLT recovery were 10.5 (range 8-19) and 14.5 (range 10-44) days; all pts required at least 1 PLT transfusion. The diff erence between neoplastic and AID pts in PLT recovery was striking; worth of mention, 11 of 28 pts did not require PLT transfusion. This was not at the expense of PMN recovery, only slightly delayed in comparison to neoplastic pts. The use of selected or unselected HSC is the main reason for the diff erences between CD and SS. Our data are in line with those of Oyama (2005), performing ASCT in CD without G-CSF. Conversely, Burt (2011) reported a delayed PLT recovery and increased PLT transfusions in SS pts receiving G-CSF after ASCT, similar to our neoplastic pts. Since the number of infused CD34+ cells was similar, integrity of marrow microenvironment and better harvest due to lack of previous chemotherapy are the main reasons for the diff erent behaviour of neoplastic and nonneoplastic pts. Nevertheless, the role of G-CSF administration should be not overlooked, so raising the questions to whether G-CSF administration is cost eff ective in AID.",

Dhooge Ghent University Hospital (Ghent, BE) Introduction: Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus NPSLE)is a rare, chronic auto-immune disorder characterized by either diff use (e.g. encephalopathy, coma, depression and psychosis) or complex presentation (e.g. encephalopathy with stroke or seizure). Disturbances of the cognitive function are a frequent problem. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has shown to be an eff ective approach in those patients with SLE who are resistant to standard therapy. Case report: A 15-year old girl was referred with progressive symptoms of fatigue, weight loss and anorexia. These symptoms started at the age of 10 years. The following years symptoms worsened and she developed headaches, depressive thoughts with catatonic as well as obsessive-compulsive and psychotic behaviour with multiple suicidal attempts. Laboratory investigations revealed leuco-and thrombopenia, as well as a positive ANF, with anti-ENA RNP-a, RNP 70-k and RNP-c, suggestive for an auto-immune disorder. MRI of the brain was normal, but EEG was abnormal and the skin biopsy revealed IgG-deposition along the basal membrane. Initial treatment with corticoids and hydroxychloroquine resulted in improvement. However, after three months symptoms worsened and were resistant to subsequent treatment (Corticoids, low dose cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies). Finally, an ASCT according to the EBMT-ASTIL guidelines was performed. PBSC harvest was done after Cyclophosphamide 2X2g/m2).The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg and ATG 7.5 mg/kg. There were no severe problems with the conditioning regimen. The ASCT resulted in a spectacular improvement of the neuropsychiatric disabilities of this patient.",

Chapuis-Cellier Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud (Pierre Benite, FR) The main objective of this study was to determine the impact of serum ferritin level on the different allogeneic HSCT outcomes in adult patients with hematological disorders. We included 158 patients, 100 males and 58 females with a median age of 45 years (18-67) The median serum ferritin level at HSCT was 1327 microg./l (26-14136); 31(20%) patients had a level 26-500, 33 (21%) had a level 500-2500, and 94 (59%) >2500. There were no significant correlation between the different ferritin levels, disease kind and status at HSCT. Twenty two patients received iron chelating agents. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD \u2265 II at 3 months was 14% (11-16.5) with 10.5% (8-13) for grade III and 7% (5-9) for grade IV; the 1 year cumulative incidence of limited and extensive chronic GVHD were 4% (2-6) and 12.4% (9-16) respectively. After a median follow-up of 18 months , the median OS was 25 months (16-NR) with a 2 years probability of 50% (43-59). The median PFS was 13.5 months (9-25) with a 2 years probability of 43% (34-50). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year was 31% (27-34), the TRM rate was 6.5% (4.5-8.5 ) and 20% (17-23.5) at 3 months and 1 year respectively. Multivariate analysis found that ferritin level >500 has a significant impact on OS which is explained by a significant higher TRM for patients with level >2500 and a significant mortality after relapse in patients with level 500-2500 (figure). The analysis on eff ect of iron chelating agents is ongoing and results will be communicated later.",

Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a serious complication that may occur in the weeks or months following bone marrow transplantation. However, GANCICLOVIR (GCV) as well as CMV infection itself, includes well-known marrow toxicity, notably neutropenia, that may consequently expose these immunosuppressed patients to life-threatening bacterial and / or fungal infections. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of grade III-IV neutropenia among patients receiving preemptive GCV therapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) at our Institution over the last years. Patients and Methods: We identifi ed 547 consecutive patients transplanted from January 2005 to June 2011 at our Institution. One Hundred ninety patients (35%) presented CMV reactivation. Thirty patients (5%) were excluded from the analysis because they already had neutropenia at the time of reactivation. Finally, 160 (29%) patients were analysed. Results: According to multivariate analysis, at the time of treatment initiation, the risk factors signifi cantly associated with a grade III-IV GCV-related neutropenia included a high viral load (HR=2.68, CI 95%, 1.25-5.737, p = 0.01); ANC over 3000 was a protective factor (HR= 0.26, CI 95 %, p < 0001) while serum creatinine higher than 2 mg/dL was associated with higher GCV-related neutropenia (HR= 2.4, CI 95%, p = 0.002) .",

Milpied Service d'h\u00e9matologie (Pessac, FR) The liver toxicity of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen does exist, but its knowledge is limited by the scarcity of available data. To explore the severe acute liver toxicity of ATG in this setting, we undertook a retrospective analysis in our center between Jan 2008 and Apr 2012. During this period, 186 RIC allo were performed with the same regimen of fl udarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day from d-5 to d-1), IV busulfan (0.8 mg/kg x 4/day at d-4 and d-3) and rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulines,\u00ae 2.5 mg/kg/day at d-2 and d-1). 27 patients (pts, 14%) developed a severe acute hepatitis (SAH) defi ned by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 10 x ULN shortly after the administration of ATG. Their median age was 57 years . One patient had a chronic C hepatitis before allo while none had a history of B hepatitis. No patient was receiving azoles at the time of hepatitis. No virus was detected in blood by PCR (EBV, CMV, B and C hepatitis). The maximum median levels of AST and ALT were 22 x ULN and 26 x ULN (9-109), respectively. The median time between start of ATG and SAH was 2 days (1) (2) (3) . No patient died of liver failure and the liver function tests improved in all cases with a median time to reach transaminases <5 x ULN and <2 x ULN of 7 days (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) and 14 days (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) , respectively. The second day of ATG was cancelled in 8 patients when SAH was noted immediately after the 1st day. The prothrombin test was below normal in 15 pts with a median of 40% (19%-68%) but rapidly went back to normal in less than 1 week. No patient developed VOD or acute GVHD of the liver. One patient developed chronic GVHD of the liver 11 months after transplant. With a median follow-up of 20 months , the 2-year OS, EFS, NRM, and relapse incidence were 75% \u00b1 10%, 61% \u00b1 11%, 6% \u00b1 6%, and 32% \u00b1 10%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of acute GVHD II-IV and extensive chronic GVHD were 15% \u00b1 7% and 15% \u00b1 8%, respectively. All these results (survival, NRM, relapse, GVHD) were similar in pts receiving 1 or 2 days of ATG. The incidence of SAH following ATG in RIC regimen is 14%. We report that transaminases rapidly normalized in all patients, that no patient developed severe liver failure, VOD, or acute GVHD of the liver. Our study does not provide any evidence that SAH following ATG might favor NRM and thus adversely aff ect the outcome of RIC allo.",

Ya\u00f1ez, M. Gonzales, E. Cuaresma, A. Bermudez, C. Richard, E. Conde, A. Insunza Hospital Marques de Valdecilla (Santander, ES) Introduction: The incidence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in the setting of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is lower than 2% and its risk is strongly associated with T-cell depletion and/or antithymocyte globulin use, and also with unrelated or HLA mismatched grafts, older age at SCT, and multiple transplantations. Thymoglobulin is a rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin with a high variability in its lymphocytotoxic activity. Moreover, in August 2012, some lots of ATG were withdrawn because one of them, manufactured at the end of 2009, failed a periodic stability test for the molecular size distribution. Objectives: To analyze the incidence of post PTLD in allo-SCT in our center since the year 2000. Patients and methods: Between 2000 and July 2012, 465 allogeneic transplants were performed in our center. They were divided into four periods (1st: 2000-2003: 105 pts, 2nd: 2004-2006: 94 pts, 3rd: 2007-2009: 142 pts and 4th: 2010-2012: 124 pts) . Results: The table shows transplant characteristics. Unrelated donors, fludarabine-based conditioning regimens and bone marrow as stem cell source increased in the latest periods, but there were no differences between the 3rd and 4th periods. Thymoglobulin was used in 92 patients: 1st:10 pts (12%), 2nd:23 pts (26%), 3rd:27 pts (19%), 4th:32 (26%) and total doses were 7.5 or 8 mg/Kg in all periods. The presence of more than 2 risk factors for PTLD was similar between the 3rd and 4th periods (13% vs 15%, p=0.3). With no cases of PTLD in the first 3 periods, 8 patients developed an early PTLD (median 55 days, 45-70) in the 4th period (6.5%). All patients had received Thymoglobulin. They were young (mean age 35 years: 5-59) and had a median of 2 risk factors (1) (2) (3) . They were heterogeneous in diagnosis (acute leukemia 3, aplastic anemia 3, NHL 1 or multiple myeloma 1), stem cell source (BM 3, PB 3, UCB 2) and donor type ( MRD 2, MUD 1, MMUD 5) . Clonality was found in 5 patients (63%) and 4 patients died, being refractory to rituximab \u00b1 chemotherapy. Conclusion: We have observed a recent important increase in the incidence of PTLD in our patients, confi ned to those who have received Thymoglobulin in the last two years without changes in our procedure. As 5 of the 8 aff ected patients had received one of the lots that were later withdrawn, we think that more studies are needed to identify other atypical clusters of PTLD and clarify their association with these or other lots.",

Patients and methods: In period from Jan 2007 till June 2012, 10 patients out of 157 who underwent HSCT at our institution developed HC grade \u2265 II. These patients received weekly instillations of 40mg (50ml) intravesical HA and then the catheter was clamped for a minimum of 30 min. Instillation was repeated once weekly until symptoms improved. We defi ne complete response (CR) as disappearance of all symptoms (hematuria, dysuria, etc) and partial response (PR) as persistence of macroscopic hematuria, with disappearance of blood clots and transfusion requirements. Results: We described 10 cases of HC with a median age of 37 years (range 19 -58). The median ANC engraftment was 12 days and 39 days for platelets. Three patients had acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD). The median HC onset was 34 days, 2 patients developed grade IV, 6 grade III and 2 grade II. The median platelet count at onset was 28.5 x 10 6 / l. JC-BK virus were excreted in urine at onset in all patients (see table 1 ). At the beginning, all patients were treated with hyperhydration and blood transfusions. Bladder irrigation was performed for prevention of clots in 6 patients and in one case cidofovir was added. Then, when the initial treatment failed, we proceeded to intravesical instillation of HA. Seven patients had a CR and three patients had a PR. One patient who achieved PR had recurrence of HC 10 days after and fi nally died. In one patient we also proceeded to the infusion of stromal mesenchymal stem cells, achieving a good response. The median response to treatment was 8.4 days (1-35) (see table 2 ). No serious side eff ects were observed. Conclusions: Hyperhydratation and blood transfusions are a commonly accepted treatment but are ineff ective as the sole treatment in most cases. As previously data support Hyaluronic acid instillation is an eff ective and safe treatment and should be the fi rst choice in cases of HC post HSCT.",

Palanicawandar, M. Lasa, R.M. Szydlo, D. Slade, D. Marin, D. Milojkovic, E.J. Kanfer, A. Rahemtulla, J.F. Apperley, J. Pavlu Imperial College London at Hammersmith Hospital (London, GB) Inadequate nutritional intake is an early complication of myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines are inconclusive regarding the optimal route for nutritional support and clinical evidence that enteral nutrition (EN) may reduce nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and the incidence of acute graft-versushost disease (aGVHD) is very limited. We analysed the eff ect of EN versus parenteral nutrition (PN) on NRM and on incidence of aGVHD, particularly of the gut, in 111 consecutive patients undergoing fi rst myeloablative SCT between 2004 and 2011. Their disease stage was categorised according to EBMT criteria: early (50%), intermediate (32%) and late (17%). Conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide and TBI. Recipients of sibling grafts (n=29) received GvHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Additional T-cell depletion with in vivo alemtuzumab was used in recipients of unrelated cells. In patients with inadequate oral intake, nasogastric feeding (NG) was initiated. If NG was declined or not tolerated, parenteral nutrition (PN) was used. According to the feeding route the patients were classifi ed into two groups: 1) PN group (N=48, 43%) with patients receiving \u2265 4 days of PN (median 13 days, range 4-43) and 2) EN group (N=63, 57%) with those who did not receive any artifi cial nutrition support (N=23), those with \u2265 4 days (median 12, 4-43 days) of NG feeding only (N=25), and patients with \u2265 4 days (median 8 days, 4-32) of NG feeding and additional PN (median 11 days, 4-27; N=15). The EN group had lower NRM compared to the PN group in univariate analysis (14% versus 40% at 200 days, p=0.035, fi gure). In multivariate analysis, this survival advantage was confi ned only to those with late stage disease. Incidence of aGVHD grades 3-4 was reduced in the EN group compared to PN group with fi ve (7.8%) versus 12 (25.5%) patients aff ected (p=0.01). EN group also had lower incidence of gut aGVHD (28.1% versus 46.7%, grades 3-4: 1.6% versus 10.6%, p=0.008).",

Huang Peking Univerisity Institute of Hematology (Beijing, CN) Objects: Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The effi cacy of donor peripheral cell harvest for PGF was retrospectively analyzed in present study. Methods: The peripheral cell harvest was aphaeresis on the fourth or fi fth day after mobilization with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Hematogical response was assessed at 30 days after infusion. Good response was defi ned as neutrophil > 1.0\u00d7109/l without G-CSF support for at least 3 consecutive days, and persistent platelet >20\u00d7109/l without transfusion for at least 7 days. Otherwise, poor response was defi ned. Results: Twenty-eight patients with PGF between 2003 to 2012 were infused with donor peripheral cell harvest. There were 21 male and 7 female. The median age was 28 (12-50) years. Of these patients, 12 were primary PGF. The median nucleated cells infused were 2.0 (1.0-5.8) \u00d7108/kg. One patient died of infection within 30 days after infusion, and the other 27 patients were evaluable for hematological response. And 44.4% (12/27) acquired good response. Age (\u2264/>median=28 years), gender, donor type (matched sibling/mismatched related), additional conditioning prior infusion, time of infusion (\u2264/>100 day) and number of infused nucleated cell (\u2264/>median=2.0\u00d7108/kg) has no impact on hematological response. However, reponse in primary PGF (3/15, 20%) was signifi cantly lower than secondary PGF (8/12, 75%) (p=0.022). Conclusions: Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest could be an option for treating poor graft function after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, especially for those patients with secondary PGF.",

Dingeldein, M. Nickelsen, M. Zeis, N. Schmitz Asklepios Klinik St. Georg (Hamburg, DE) Hepatic toxicity and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) are serious early events after allogeneic SCT. A recent meta-analysis revealed an incidence of 12.9% for allogeneic SCT (Copell et al 2010) . Busulfan as part of the conditioning regimen has been identifi ed as an important risk factor for VOD. We investigated whether intravenous (IV) busulfan or the prophylactic use of low-dose defi brotide might result in lower incidences of VOD and hepatic toxicity. From January 2008 to June 2011, 165 consecutive patients received an allogeneic SCT preceded by busulfan-containing conditioning with 2 (n=64) 3 (n=76) or 4 days (n=35) of Busulfan (4 mg/kg BW/day orally or 3.2 mg/kg BW/day i.v., total dose 8 to 16 mg/kg orally). The median patient age was 57 years (18-75 years). Advanced disease (leukemia > CR1, lymphoma at least 2 prior treatment lines) was present in 123 / 165 pts (75%). Ninety-one pts had myeloid neoplasia, 71 had lymphoid malignancy and 3 pts non -malignant disorders. Oral busulfan was given in 133 patients and an i.v. formulation (Busilvex\u00ae) was used in 32 pts. Defi brotide prophylaxis (2.5 -7.5 mg/kg/day) was scheduled from day -7 to day +21 in all patients with 3 or 4 days of oral busulfan and was received by 108 pts. The overall incidence of VOD according to Baltimore criteria was very low with only 5/165 pts (3%) developing VOD in this high-risk group of patients. Due to the low incidence of VOD a meaningful risk -factor analysis was not possible. The incidence of hepatic toxicity grade 3 and 4 was 24.4% and 7.3 %, respectively. Grade 4 hepatic toxicity was associated with an extremely poor prognosis with no patient surviving. Grade 4 hepatic toxicity was only seen in patients treated with oral busulfan. Overall, there was a trend to better overall survival in patients given iv busulfan (64.8 % vs 48.7% at 1 year p=0.15885). In patients with four days of busulfan application the diff erence in overall survival was significant (83.3% vs 35.9% at 1 year p=0.2712). However, the number of patients was small in that latter subgroup. We conclude that using oral busulfan at doses of 8 to 16 mg/kg BW with defi brotide prophylaxis or iv busulfan without prophylaxis both result in a low incidence of VOD. When busulfan is administered at full dose (4 days of application, 16 mg (13.2) mg/kg BW) i.v. busulfan might be preferable over oral busulfan.",

Results: In total, 99 pts were provided with mechanical ventilation 78% pts died, 22% survived. The survival at 6 months was 13%. Surviving pts did not diff er from dead in age. In pts ventilated prior the day 100 after HSCT the ratio of surviving was 27% against 18% ventilated later. The percentage of pts who died within 24 and 48 hours of ventilation was 14% and 21% respectively. Median of ventilated days was 8 in surviving against 16 in dead. 15% of patients with acute GVHD gr.

The necessity of re-intubation did not seem to worsen the outcome. Cytomegaloviral pneumonitis and invasive aspergillosis lead nearly always to dead, while patients with non-infectious pneumonitis and disturbances of consciousness survived more frequently. Conclusion: Patients after allogeneic HSCT whose state of health came to the need of mechanical ventilation have considerable unfavourable prognosis, lasting long term after transplantation. However this way of treatment is life-saving procedure for a definite proportion of pts. According to current knowledge it is impossible to predict who will profit from the treatment in the time of intubation and frequently in the course of ventilation as well.",

Montoro, F. Bosch, D. Valcarcel Hospital Vall Hebron (Barcelona, ES) Background: BK virus hemorrhagic cystitis (BKV-HC) is a potential serious complication that increases in incidence after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) without established standard treatment. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the applicability (effi cacy and safety) of a risk-adapted algorithm of treatment in patients with BKV-HC occurred after allo-HSCT. BKV determination was held by RT-PCR techniques. In our algorithm, BK virus viremia was tested in all patients with symptomatic BKV-HC. Patients with positive viremia received systemic cidofovir (SC, 1 mg/kg/day/iv, 3 days/week) and those without viremia, intravesical cidofovir (IVC, 5 mg/kg/week in 60 cc of serum for 1 hour). Failure to IVC was defi ned if symptoms persisted after 2 weeks of therapy. All patients were treated until disappearance of symptoms regardless of viral clearance. Patients who failed to local treatment received SC. Results: 57 consecutive allo-HSCT performed in our centre between September 2009 and April 2012 were included. The median follow-up was 12 months (range 2-31). Nine patients (16%, 60% women) with a median age of 35 years (range 18-62) had HC-BKV after a median of 35 days (range 12-132) post allo-HSCT (n=7 unrelated donor). Most patients received myeloablative conditioning (n=8) including ATG. All patients showed hemorrhagic cystitis grade II-III with symptomatic viruria and viremia was detected in 2 cases. Urine BKV viral load at diagnosis was higher than 2.6 x 109 copies/mL in all cases. Regarding treatment, 6 patients received IVC (median 2 doses, range 1-4) and 3 SC (median 2 doses, range [1] [2] [3] [4] . The response, at 30 and 60 days, was complete in 2 and 4 cases respectively and partial response in 4 and 2 cases, respectively. Two patients were not response evaluable due to they presented a relapse of the underlying disease. One patient presented a HC-BKV relapse 4 weeks after and responded to systemic retreatment. A moderate transient acute renal failure was recorded in 2 out of 3 patients who received SC. IVC was well tolerated with no related toxicity and could be administered on an outpatient basis in 5 out of 6 patients. Conclusions: BKV-HC is common, especially in allo-HSCT recipients from unrelated donor. The application of a treatment algorithm based on the risk has been proven safe and eff ective, with any observed progression of infection in treated IVC patients. These data should be consolidated into a larger number of patients.",

Ozkan (1) Results: Of 65 patients, 36 received CY, and 29 received ET as a mobilization regimen. While lymphoma was the major underlying disorder consisting ET group, it was multiple myeloma in CY group (p<0.001). Therefore, median cumulative anthracycline dose was signifi cantly higher in ET group than CY group (p<0.001). Patients consisting ET group was younger than the CY group (p=0.012). NT-proBNP levels were increased in almost all patients, except 2 from CY group in who NT-proBNP levels were decreased compared to base line measures. The mean baseline NT-proBNP levels were not signifi cantly diff erent between the CY and ET group (119.5 vs 149, respectively, p>0.05). A signifi cant diff erence between the median NT-proBNP levels at baseline and at 6 hours after MC was observed for the both group of 63 patients (p<0.001). Furthermore, we noted that change in plasma NT-proBNP levels in ET group was statistically more powerful than the CY group (p=0.001). The reason may be the higher cumulative anthracycline dose in ET group than CY group. 2 patients from the both groups who had antecedent aortic and mitral valve pathologies developed acute congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema during the MC with a peak NT-proBNP levels over 20.000 pgr. Conclusion: Our results suggest that HD CY and ET given as a MC causes very acute cardiac toxicity, and plasma NT-proBNP monitoring seems to be useful for early detection of patients at highrisk for cardiac dysfunction in HSCT.",

Given the frequent long-term survival after SCT, protecting bone health in this population is particularly important. Chemotherapy, glucocorticoid therapy, and the acute eff ects of transplanted bone marrow on the bony environment all may contribute to an early and rapid decline in bone mineralization. We studied patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies who underwent SCT between 2011 and 2012. 31 had available both pre-and 100 days post-SCT bone mineral density studies.

Patients often had signifi cant weight change over the fi rst 100 days post transplant, however this was not signifi cantly associated with changes in bone mineralization. We conclude that signifi cant declines in bone mineralization both the trabecular and cortical bone sites can be observed in the fi rst 100 days post-allogeneic SCT. These changes appear to be more related to the SCT procedure and potentially the interaction of the transplanted bone marrow with the local bone environment then to medication such as glucocorticoid therapy. This indicates the need for patients to be monitored for bone health subsequent to SCT procedures which would aff ord an opportunity for early intervention for patients at risk of bone loss. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a major complication in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from microscopic hematuria (grade 1) to severe hemorrhage with obstructive renal failure (grade 4). Early bleeding (24-72 hours after transplant) is usually ascribed to toxic eff ects of drugs, while reported predisposing factors for late-occurring cystitis (post-engraftment) include viral infections (polyoma BK virus, cytomegalovirus and adenovirus), allogeneic transplant from matched unrelated donors, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and, fi nally, the conditioning regimens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for HC in 121 thalassemia major patients who had undergone allogenic HSCT. In 34 of these the HSC donor was a matched unrelated donor (MUD), while 87 HSCT were from siblings. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in all patients. Thirty-one were conditioned with tiothepa, treosulfan and fl udarabine, 90, all children (mean age at HSCT 5.6 years), with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Acute GVHD occurred in 72/121 patients (59%). The GVHD prophylaxis was performed with cyclosporine and methylprednisolone in matched sibling transplants, antithymocyte globulins were added in MUD transplants. HC occurred in 20 patients (16.5%): grade 1 in 3, grade 2 in 5 and grade 3 in the remaining 9. Sixteen subjects (18%) had undergone conditioning regimens with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 4/31 (13%) tiothepa, treosulfan and fl udarabine (p=0.21).

The only factor which seems to have any relevance, although it is not of any statistical signifi cance, probably due to the limited number of patients, is acute GVHD and the consequent immunosuppression which increases bladder damage by polioma BK, like other viruses and drugs. Monitoring: all centers reported mucositis data recording on medical record, in 1/6 center accompanied by electronic database recording; WHO scale was commonly used in all centers, 2/6 centers only using a mucositis-related-pain scale. Prevention: 2/6 centers only reported using oral criotherapy (for high dose melphalan); no center commonly used palifermin; oral mouth rinses use in 5/6 (combination of antimicrobial agents and sporadic use of other agents, such as probiotics, electrolytic or barrier solutions). Total parenteral nutrition (TPN), simple or with addition of glutamine or omega acid, in 3/6 centers. Mucositis treatment showed homogeneity: analgesics, NPT, protonic pomp inhibitors and anti-diarrhoeal drugs in 6/6 centers. Missing measures / center were 2, 1 and 0 in 4, 1 and 1 center, respectively. Not-required measures: 1 in each center. Overall, 15 missing or not-required prescriptions were identifi ed: 10 for prevention, 4 for monitoring and 1 for treatment. Conclusions: Heterogeneity level could be addressed as high, intermediate and low for prevention, monitoring and treatment of mucositis, respectively. We will pursue standardization and sharing of prevention, monitoring and treatment protocols, as recommended by the existing guidelines.Full adherence to guidelines would provide: direct cost savings and prophylaxis effi cacy improvement, as well as symptoms burden, rescue therapy and indirect costs reduction. Introduction: In patients with cancer, loss of weight and of active cell mass are prognostic unfavourable. Because little is known about alterations in active body cell mass in patients with hematological malignant diseases, we evaluated weight loss and body composition in patients during and after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: Twenty-six patients were included: Multiple Myeloma (n = 14), Lymphoma (n = 8) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (n = 4). Body weight was measured at admittance, before SCT and weekly after for three months. Body composition was assessed by the labelled water method at admittance, at discharge and at three months after SCT. Fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were calculated from total body water (TBW) assessed by using deuterium-dilution. Combined with the determination of extracellular water (ECW) with bromide-dilution, the intracellular water (ICW) was assessed and used as a measurement for the active body cell mass. Results: Mean weight loss during hospitalization was 3.4% ( Figure I ).",

Introduction: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe skin disorder involving more than 30% of body surface area that rarely may occur after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT).Its clinical characteristics included generalized erythema, maculopapular plaques with darkening of the centre, multiple blister formation and large area of very painful epidermal denudation, oral and genital ulcerations and bilateral conjunctivitis. TEN is usually caused by the administration of some drugs, but the association with viral infections or Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) has been reported.

Conditioning regimens included total body irradiation in 3 pts, busulphan in 2 and treosulphan in 1.Neutrophils' engraftment occurred 19 days after HSCT (range 11-21). 4 pts developed a-GvHD (grade II in 2, grade III in 1, and grade IV in 1) after a median of 18 days after HSCT (range 13-24). Results: The drugs administered before TEN and for its treatment and patients' outcomes are shown in Table 1 . In 2 pts the skin biopsy confi rmed the diagnosis of TEN. In our experience TEN was probably induced by the association of immunological features such as reactions against drugs (like clarithromycin, voriconazole, ciprofl oxacin, allopurinol, micafungin) and severe a-GvHD, viral infections and other comorbidities such as renal insuffi ciency. Treatments of TEN included supportive treatments, and, whether it is possible, the discontinuation of all potential causative agents, high doses of iv immunoglobulin (n=6), reduction of high dosage of steroids (n=2), etanercept (n=3), and plasmaexchange (n=3). Conclusions: Our experience confi rmed that TEN represent a possible severe complications of HSCT. Careful analysis of drugs and clinical features potentially associated to TEN, examination by experienced dermatologist, and skin biopsy could help in diff erential diagnosis with other skin disorders occurred after HSCT as GvHD since therapy is diff erent. Supportive care and nursing, iv immunoglobulin, reduction of steroids represent the management for these critically patients. Objectives: Severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is one of the most frequent causes of early mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with mortality rate of 30-50%. The initial event in VOD is the injury of sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes by chemotherapeutic agents. Coagulation cascade and infl ammatory process are activated and there is progressive venular occlusion and subsequent hepatocellular necrosis. Despite numerous investigations on therapeutic agents such as defi brotide, heparin, prostaglandin E1, and tissue-plasminogen activator, there is no proven defi nitive treatment for VOD. In current analysis, the role of AT-III in hepatic VOD treatment was investigated; AT-III has a potent anti-infl ammatory eff ect by interacting with endothelium and prevents further damage to tissues. Methods: A retrospective analysis was done on pediatric patients who received AT-III as VOD treatment after HSCT at Seoul National University Children's Hospital between June 2008 and June 2012. Twenty three transplanted patients (10 autologous and 13 allogeneic HSCT) underwent AT-III treatment after the diagnosis of VOD. They received three doses of 50 unit/kg/dose of AT-III concentrate every 8 hours and then received further doses every 24 hours. Defi brotide, heparin, prostaglandin E1, and tissue-plasminogen activator and ursodeoxycholic acid were administered in some of the patients. Results: Patients underwent HSCT at a median age of 9.2 years old and VOD was diagnosed at median 18 days after transplantation. The median AT-III level at diagnosis was 67%, and after median 10 doses of AT-III, a median AT-III level of 134% was achieved. Overall, median 18 doses were administered during a median period of 16 days. VOD improved in 16 patients (69.6%) and aggravated in 7 patients (30.4%). Overall, 2 patients (8.7%) died of VOD with multi-organ failure. In the improved group, the median AT-III level was 80% (range 46-121%) at diagnosis and 152% (range 50-285%) after median 9 doses of AT-III. In comparison, in the aggravated group, the median AT-III level was 66% (range 56-84%) at diagnosis and 134% (range 66-295%) despite median 11 doses of AT-III. Conclusion: VOD improved in 69.6% of the study population after median 16 days of AT-III treatment. This study shows that AT-III based treatment may be an eff ective strategy for combating VOD after HSCT.",

It has been reported that about 3 % of lower extremity muscle mass decreased during 7 day strict bed rest even in healthy volunteers. In our study, most of the patients received HSCT suff ered from fever, anemia and poor nutritional condition due to preconditioning regimen related toxicities, nevertheless we continued low-intensity exercise therapy even with these patients.

Conclusion: After HSCT, the level of anxiety and depression has been reduced. The fi ndings suggest that other psychological distress should be evaluated in patients. It indicates the importance of psychiatric intervention during the isolation period of patients as well as pre-transplant psychiatric assessment and counseling regarding the procedure .Therapeutic treatment procedure, pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical treatments should be carried out based on the results obtained from patients under study.",

Few studies have looked at the impact of platelet transfusion on clinical outcomes in HSCT while increased use of single donor apheresis platelets (SDAP), alternate platelet dosing and diff erent thresholds for prophylactic transfusions contribute to uncertainty regarding optimal platelet transfusion strategies. In this study, we examined the impact of platelet transfusion on HSCT outcomes and examined the role of SDAP. Methods: Retrospective single centre cohort study was conducted on 522 patients undergoing HSCT between January 2002 and December 2007. Clinical characteristics and transplant-related outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis in autologous recipients was performed to examine the impact of SDAP use (not possible in allogeneic group as SDAP used for nearly all transfusions). Results: Mean number of platelet transfusion events before day +60 post-HSCT was 7.5 (95%CI 6.7-8.4) with greater number of events following allogeneic compared with autologous HSCT (p<0.01). Univariate and multivariate analysis confi rmed the number of platelet transfusion events was associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including 100-day non-relapse mortality (p <0. 01), post HSCT length of stay (p<0.01), need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (p<0. 01) and number of organs aff ected by severe toxicity (p<0.01).

Although the clinical manifestation and the results of the in vitro experimental investigations suggest that ATG was the causal agent of ARDS, further in vivo studies are required to defi nitively prove that ARDS was secondary to ATG. However, clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of ARDS after administration of ATG. Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is referred to gas cysts in the bowel wall (either the small or the large intestine). In newborns, PI is considered diagnostic for necrotizing enterocolitis, and the gas is produced by bacteria in the bowel wall. In adults it is associated with numerous conditions, ranging from benign to life threatening (bowel ischemia, infarction, necrotizing enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, volvulus, sepsis, etc.). The overall incidence of PI in the general population has been reported to be 0.03% based on an autopsy series. As a radiological sign, PI can be seen on abdominal radiographs and CT is the most sensitive imaging test for identifi cation of PI. We identifi ed a group of patients post allo-HSCT that were diagnosed with PI. None of these events occurred during neutropenia and most of the patients were barely symptomatic or asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, PI was mostly associated with acute GI GVHD. Overt perforation was excluded in all patients and all were managed conservatively with temporary nothing per os regime along with local and systemic antibiotics. Under conservative management, PI subsided gradually in all cases. None of the patients was in need for surgery and the prognosis was excellent. We assume that post allo-HSCT PI is secondary to mucosal disruption caused by subtle form of erosions that may be secondary to clinical or subclinical GI GVHD, viruses or medications. We conclude that post allogeneic HSCT PI is a benign process that can be conservatively managed with excellent prognosis. Introduction: Mucositis is a pathological process where the mucous is aff ected, the broad of the aff ected area can go from infl ammation to ulcers, in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) from the mouth to the anus. Several studies have showend that patients that received bone marrow transplantation (BMT), almost 75% had mucositis as a side eff ect after the BMT in diff erent grades. Topic FEC-GM has being used to disminish the severity and duration of the mucositis promoting migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Objective: We want to evaluate the effi cacy of topic FEC-GM in a mouth wash presentation to diminish the duration and the severity of mucositis en BMT patients. We conclude in our study that mucositis incidence was minor of the published, because our patients receive FEC-GM as an early therapy once a grade 1 mucositis was detected with a recover days of 6.7. We also conclude that our patients did not required intravenously nutrition therefore less hospitalized time, comorbidities and costs. Objectives: High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue (autotransplant) became a well established consolidation procedure in several solid tumor protocols for pediatric cancer patients. Peritransplant toxicity includes main organ parameters, but its infl uence on basic electrolytes is yet to be determined. We followed and compared sodium (Na), potassium (K), phosphorous (P), magnesium and total bilirubin (T. Introduction: Sweet's syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, erythematous and tender skin lesions (papules, nodules, and plaques), that typically show a diff use infi ltrate consisting predominantly of mature neutrophils in histopathology. This syndrome is often associated with several conditions, such as malignancy, autoimmune disease, infections and drug-induced. Herein we report a 15 year old boy that presented with fever and skin lesions consistent with Sweet's syndrome after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) for relapse acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Case report: We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with the diagnosis of relapse AML who was undergoing autologous SCT with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization 15 \u03bcg/kg/day yielded maximum CD34+ count of 1.5 x 10 CD34+ cells/kg after complete remmision. On day + 10 he developed persistent fever and severe neutropenia despite broad-spectrum antibiotic and G-CSF therapy. Times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 14 and 25 days, respectively. All culture results were negative. His bone marrow studies on day 21 demonstrated a reactive bone marrow in regenerative phase. Histopathologic fi ndings of a skin biopsy showed a mature neutrophilic infi ltrate besides fever and skin papular lesions that met the criteria of Sweet's syndrome on day 24. His fever and skin fi ndings resolved following treatment with methlyprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day, tapered over 6 weeks). He has been well without any signs of recurrence for 6 months after SCT. Conclusions: The literature contains only one case of G-CSF associated Sweet's syndrome in a child after autologous SCT for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia that responded to steroid therapy. The appropriate diagnosis is of great clinical importance because G-CSF induced Sweet's syndrome is reversible with cessation of the drug and administration of glucocorticosteroids.",

Case: An 18-years old man was presented with fatigue, loss of appetite and abdominal distension at 2004, when he was 10 years old. Ph (+) chronic, stable phase CML diagnosis was made by peripheral blood smear and bone marrow evaluations including morphological and genetic studies. After cytoreduction by hydroxyurea, he was given 1 x 260 mg/m2 imatinib therapy At 2010, dasatinib 1 x 70 mg plus BFM (Berlin, Frankfurt, Munster) chemotherapy was given to Ph (+) patient with CALLA (+) pre-B ALL. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) decision was taken for patient who had bone marrow remission following remission induction and consolidation therapies and 10/10 fullcompatible non-related donor. According to ASCT preparation protocol, TBI (2 Gy, twice daily for 3 days; overall dose 12 Gy), followed by 60 mg/kg/day over 2 days cyclophosphamide regime were planned; however, he reported that he couldn't move his arms on the day 3 of TBI therapy. 3/5 weakness was detected in both upper extremities in neurologic examination, as being more prominent in distal. No pathological refl ex was detected. Deep tendon refl exes were hypoactive at upper extremities, but there was no sensorial defect. Thus, TBI was discontinued and 1 mg/kg steroid therapy was initiated. On the cervical MRI, there were T1weighted isointense and T2-weighted hyperintense pathological signal changes, which begins at C2 level, involves all cervical spinal cord and extends to thoracic segments and expansion of spinal cord. By these fi ndings, diagnosis of ATM was made. No abnormal fi nding was detected in viral, bacteriological and autoimmune evaluations; in addition, no growth was found in culture tests. Result and Discussion: Known adverse eff ects of TBI include nausea, vomiting, sweating and irritability as well as renal dysfunction, interstitial pneumonia, lung injury, cataract, osteosarcoma and cystitis in rare cases; no case of myelitis has been reported. Treatment aims etiology; however, steroid therapy is recommended in idiopathic cases.

Background: Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a recognized complication of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and is often refractory to treatment and carries a high mortality. To improve understanding of this complication, we analyzed allogeneic HSCT patients in our institution for the prevalence of post-transplant AIHA, its risk factors, treatment response, and mortality. Methods: AIHA was identifi ed by positive direct anti-globulin test (DAT), and biochemical markers of haemolysis (raised serum lactate dehydrogenase, reduced haptoglobin or spherocytes on blood fi lm appearance). We also assessed for clinically signifi cant AIHA defi ned as \u2265 2 g/dL drop in haemoglobin. DAT positivity due to red cell allo-antibodies were excluded from AIHA diagnosis. Red cell allo-antibody was identifi ed if the antigen corresponded to a mis-matched blood group between donor/recipient, or the absence of such antigen in both donor/recipient. Cases with positive DAT prior to HSCT were removed from analysis. Serological analysis revealed greater prevalence of red cell alloantibodies in AIHA versus non-AIHA patients (55.6% vs 3.8%, p<0.0001). 8 patients (44%) responded to treatment for AIHA. Allcause mortality in patients with post-transplant AIHA was 55% (n = 10), with 39% (n=7) one-year mortality from diagnosis of AIHA. Conclusion: We report the prevalence of AIHA following HSCT as 3.2% in the largest study of its kind. AIHA was associated with receiving HSCT from VUD, but not associated with using Alemzutumab in the conditioning regimen. We also observed an increased prevalence of red cell allo-antibodies in patients with AIHA. This may refl ect increased transfusions received by these patients, but also raises the possibility of a global immune dysregulation which predispose to both AIHA and allo-immunization following HSCT. Overall, the patients with AIHA showed variable response to treatment and often have a poor prognosis.",

Fourteen pregnancies occurred following natural or induced conception in 11 and 3 cases respectively. Three pregnancies resulted in early termination because of tubal pregnancy in 1 patient and because of 2 elective abortions. Pregnancy-related complications included preeclampsia in 1 patient, severe anemia requiring transfusion support in 1, and uterine hemorrhage in 1. Twelve live births were delivered after cesarean section in all cases following a median gestation of 37 weeks (36-38). APGAR scores were 9 to 10 at 5 minutes after birth in 11 infants and 6 in one baby due to distress respiratory syndrome. The median birth weight and height was 2.800 Kg (1.990 -3.600) and 49 cm (44 -53) respectively. These 12 infants currently survive from 1 to 11 years with normal growth. Ten of them had no congenital abnormality whereas 2 were aff ected by TM. MALE PATIENTS: age of the 3 male patients was 10, 17 and 24 at time of HCT, whereas the median time from HCT to fi rst partner pregnancy was 14, 19, and 3 years respectively. Nine pregnancies occurred following natural conception in all cases. One of 9 pregnancies resulted in early termination because of elective abortion. No pregnancy-related complication occurred. Eight live births were delivered after uncomplicated cesarean section in one case and vaginal delivery in the remaining 7 cases following a median gestation of 38 weeks (37-40). APGAR score was 10 at 5 minutes after birth in 8 cases and 9 in 1 case. The median birth weight and height was 3.300 Kg (3.200 -3.500 ) and 50 cm (49 -52) respectively. These 8 infants currently survive from 2 to 18 years with normal growth. This study demonstrates that fertility is maintained in some patients with TM following HCT and that pregnancy is likely to have a successful outcome in most cases.",

Yet, adverse events (AEs) lead to DEF adjustment/ temporary interruption in 65 pt with creatinine elevation being a major cause. 13.6% of AEs were suspected to be drug related and occasionally resulted in drug withdrawal [gastrointestinal (n=5), skin (n=3), elevated transaminases (n=2) and creatinine (n=2)].

Our data imply that DEF eliminates non-transferrin bound iron fi rst which may explain the early Hb rise. Expression of hepcidin from donor leukocytes (with paracrine/autocrine actions) and recipient liver might prevent increased ferroportin-mediated iron export from recipient macrophages thereby protecting body organs.

Anasetti (4) Conclusion: More than half of the patients had evidence of peripheral airway dysfunction as estimated by LCI 3-10 years after paediatric HSCT, which however, appeared to be unrelated to cGvHD criteria and respiratory symptoms and only weakly correlated to standard PFT parameters. Prospective studies are needed to investigate LCI as a diagnostic tool for early detection of cGvHD related lung disease, and are currently performed in our centre. Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as a treatment for a variety of malignant and non-malignant conditions. With improvements in conditioning regimens and post-transplant care, more HSCT recipients are becoming long-term survivors and are thus at risk of long-term complications. Iron overload is common after HSCT. It is associated with chronic liver disease, increased rates of infection and may also aff ect survival in this population. In other clinical settings such as hereditary hemochromatosis and transfusional iron overload states such as thalassemia, the reduction of iron stores by phlebotomy or chelation has been unequivocally demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to establish the feasibility and effi cacy of phlebotomy to reduce total body iron in HSCT recipients. Methods: We enrolled patients who were at least 60 days following an autologous or allogeneic HSCT with a serum ferritin of 1000 \u03bcg/L or greater. Patients underwent phlebotomy of 500 mL of whole blood for 12 procedures. Iron stores were measured serially in each patient by serum ferritin and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement of hepatic iron. Hepatic iron was determined by using multiple gradient echo sequences and liver to muscle intensity ratio. This was related to hepatic iron concentration using previously correlated MRI signal to biopsy proven ratios. Results: 22 patients were enrolled and 16 patients were able to complete the series of 12 planned phlebotomies. The reasons for inability to complete all 12 treatments were relapse (n=1), the development of extensive graft-versus-host disease (n=1), noncompliance (n=2) and intolerance (n=2). At baseline, the mean ferritin was 1855.9 \u03bcg/L and 900.6 \u03bcg/L at 12 months (p=0.0007). The mean MRI hepatic iron concentration at baseline was 220 \u03bcmol/g and 148.1 \u03bcmol/g at 12 months (p<0.0001).",

            "text": "Conclusions: Phlebotomy is a feasible method to remove excess iron in HSCT patients with most patients demonstrating the ability to complete all planned phlebotomies. Phlebotomy was demonstrated to be eff ective at reducing iron stores with statistically signifi cant reductions in mean ferritin and mean MRI hepatic iron concentration. Given the positive results in this study, we plan to undertake a larger study to determine the eff ect on morbidity and mortality in this patient population. The overall incidence of SN was 4,9% and it was higher in the AUTO-HSCT than in the ALLO-HSCT (6,6% versus 3,2%). The median time since HSCT to diagnostic of SN was 4,1 years. Hematologic SN developed earlier than solid SN, 3,9 and 9,1 years after HSCT respectively (p < 0,001). The most frequent locations among solid SN were gastrointestinal tract: 11, genitourinary: 9, respiratory: 9, gynecological: 6 and central nervous system: 3. Conditioning regimen with TBI was associated more frequently with development of solid SN (p = 0,07). Hematologic SN were myelodysplastic syndrome: 20, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease: 9, acute myeloblastic leukemia: 5 and non-Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma: 5. Eight of them (21%) received a second HSCT as treatment (ALLO: 7, AUTO: 1). The overall mortality rate related with SN was 61% with a median survival time of 15,6 months after the SN was diagnosed. Conclusions: Our serie confi rm that the incidence of SN after HSCT is low but it has an important impact in the long-term mortality of these patients. They are more frequent in AUTO-HSCT than in ALLO-HSCT. Solid SN appear later and are more common than hematologic SN. TBI previous to HSCT seems to be more associated with solid than hematologic SN. The aim of the study was to determine the cumulative incidence of second malignancies among patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) who were treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) following modifi ed BEAM regimen at our department. We also intended to defi ne the potential risk factors for the occurrence of second neoplasms after ASCT. The cumulative incidence of second malignancy was calculated by controlling for death from any reason other than second malignancy as a competing risk. We evaluated the long-term outcomes after ASCT in 268 patients, median age 33 years (range 17-61 years), with HL (n=167) and NHL (n=101), who were treated with autotransplant following modifi ed BEAM regimen (BCNU 300mg/m 2 , etoposid 800mg/m 2 , cytarabine 6000mg/m 2 , melphalan 140mg/m 2 and dexamethasone 168mg/m 2 ) between 1992 and 2011. The patients received a median of 2 chemotherapy lines (range 1-5) before ASCT. MOPP-type chemotherapy were given to 8% and radiotherapy to 40% of patients prior to ASCT. The median follow-up of the living patients was 66 (12-242) months. The 5-year OS and PFS for all patients were 74% and 66%, respectively. Eighteen patients died from transplant-related causes within 100 days of ASCT, corresponding to early TRM of 6.7%. Second malignancies occurred in 9 of the 268 patients, including 5 MDS/AML, 1 ALL, 1 NHL, and 2 solid tumors (bladder cancer and thyroid cancer). The second neoplasms developed at a median of 6.8 years (range 0.4-15) from ASCT. The 10-year and 14-year cumulative incidence of developing a second malignancy was 7% (95%CI 3-14) and [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , respectively. In univariate analysis, age at transplant (<45 vs \u226545 years, p=0.001) and pre-transplant MOPP-type chemotherapy (p=0.062) were the only factors associated with the occurrence of a second neoplasm. In contrast, sex, the number of prior chemotherapy lines, radiotherapy, and the disease status at ASCT were not predictive for the development of a second neoplasm. In multivariate analysis, age at transplant (HR=11.7; p=0.002) and pre-transplant MOPP-type chemotherapy (HR=6.1; p=0.016), remained signifi cant for the development of a second malignancy.",

Jarkovsky (2) Background: Acquired defi ciencies of clotting factors as a consequence of auto antibodies are rare conditions but lead to complex treatment approaches with high morbidity and mortality. The most common such condition is acquired FVIII defi ciency, while others are described only in a small group of patients. The treatment is directed towards bleeding control with activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) and towards long term eradication of autoantibodies using immune suppression. FIX and FXI defi ciency are rare and described in patients with hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. In the hematopoietic SCT setting, only acquired FVII defi ciency was described to date. Children with haemoglobinopathies undergoing HSCT are not exposed to total body irradiation but have their own specifi c endocrine issues, especially pubertal and growth delay related to iron toxicity. Experience is growing in HSCT in patients with haemoglobinopathies worldwide, but data on endocrine lateeff ects is scanty. Aims: To evaluate the endocrine late-eff ects seen in children with \u03b2-thalassaemia major (\u03b2-thal) and sickle cell disease (SCD) post HSCT focusing on gonadal, growth and thyroid eff ects. S374 with \u03b2-thal(mean height SDS -1.32) pre-HSCT. There was no signifi cant change in height SDS during follow-up. Only 1 male(\u03b2thal) had severe growth failure with a low IGF-1 but a normal GH stimulation test. He responded well to empirical GH. Conclusion: Hormonal evidence of gonadal failure is more common post-HSCT in females than males. Growth and thyroid adverse eff ects are rare. Children with haemoglobinopathy seem to have a decreased burden of endocrine late-eff ects post-HSCT compared with oncology patients. ",

All patients received HSCT from an haplo-identical donor without conditioning regimen (n= 3) or conditioned with cyclophosphamide (n= 1). Median age at HSCT was 4.5 months (2 to 6.5 months). Early immune reconstitution (1 and 2 years post HSCT) was good in 3 patients (CD4 > 600/mm 3 ) and poor in one while none of these patients had B cell reconstitution. CD4 T cells and na\u00efve CD4 T cells counts (when documented) declined in all patients (median CD4 count 340/mm3 5 years post HSCT). Onset of granulomatous disease occurred 5 to 25 years post HSCT (median 5.5 years). The fi rst organs involved were the liver (n=2), skin (n=2) and digestive tract (n=1). Duration of follow up for granulomatous disease was 3.75 years (1 to 16 years). All patients except one (follow up 1 year) displayed progressive multisystemic involvement (recurrent fever (n= 3), lungs (n= 3), digestive tract (n= 2)). Immunohistochemical studies showed non necrotic epithelioid granuloma with lymphocytic infi ltrate made predominantly of CD3+CD8+ T cells was observed in the skin (n=3). Liver biopsies showed portal infl ammation with CD8+ cells (n=4). Broad microbiologic investigations were negative in all cases. Circulating CD8 lymphocytosis (mainly eff ector memory) was documented concomitantly in 2 patients. Treatment is challenging. In our patients, several lines of immunosuppressive drugs as steroids (n=3), ciclosporine (n=2), azathioprine (n=1), anti-TNF\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies (n=3), rapamycine (n=1), interferon \u03b1(n=1), hydroxychloroquine (n=1), thalidomide (n=1) showed limited improvement. One patient died after retransplantation from an HLA matched unrelated donor performed late in the course of granulomatous infl ammation. In patients with poor immune reconstitution, cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs have to be used with caution. Early intervention with retransplantation or gene therapy should be discussed, as long-term outcome of these complications is uncertain.",

Paul, C. Exbrayat, N. Fegueux, P. Ceballos, I. Serre, T. Vincent, G. Boursier, A. Bourdin Universitary Hospital Montpellier (Montpellier, FR) Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung aff ection characterized by the intra-alveolar accumulation of PAS-positive surfactant, resulting from a defi ciency in graulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathway. Secondary PAP is an unusual pulmonary complication after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). The mechanism is not yet elucidaded, especially those occuring out of aplasia. Whole Lung Lavage (WLL), the standard of care of PAP, is an invasive procedure. So, GM-CSF and Rituximab have been used to treat patients with idiopathic PAP, who have anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies. Their eff ects on secondary PAP are not known. We here report the fi rst case of secondary PAP post-alloHSCT cured through treatment with WLL and Rituximab. This combination seems synergystic and may constitute a therapeutic option. A 35-year-old man with a smoking history was diagnosed in 2007 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After induction and consolidation chemotherapy, he underwent an allo-HSCT from a matched related donor after a myeloablative conditioning while in fi rst complete remission. Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of methotrexate and ciclosporine. The neutrophil recovery occurred on day 22 post-alloHSCT. In 2008, he developed acute digestive GvHD with multiple exacerbations requiring the introduction of corticosteroids. The immunosuppression was complicated by many infections including sepsic shocks evoking bacterial translocation, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and EBV reactivation treated by Rituximab.",

It is not clear whether multi-professional clinics are necessary or whether community based follow up using protocolised guidance would suffi ce. In our transplant centre we have a combined haematology-endocrine consultant led clinical service once a month for patients surviving more than 10 years after SCT. Although the clinic is protocolised it is our impression that these patients have complex medical problems and the majority benefi t from expert physician input at annual follow up. We have collected data on all patients attending our service over a 3-month period to evaluate the prevalence of chronic and active medical problems benefi tting from physician input. 24 patients (11 female) were seen a median of 20 years post SCT (range 10-33 years).

In patients surviving more than 10 years, however, we have noted development of testosterone defi ciency in some patients. This can be associated with sexual dysfunction, decreased bone mineral density and decreased longevity. In this study we have investigated the prevalence of low testosterone levels in very long term survivors of haemopoietic SCT. Clinical and biochemical records were reviewed from 45 consecutive male patients attending a dedicated haematology/endocrinology follow up clinic. Testosterone, SHBG and LH levels are measured annually in these patients. The median transplant to follow up time was 15.9 years (range 8-33 years). All had received TBI/cyclophosphamide conditioning with a median dose of 12 Gy (range 10-14Gy). 30 patients had been treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukaemia. 19 patients were identifi ed with testosterone levels below the normal range a median of 13.9 years (range 7-25 years) after SCT. In 9/19 cases borderline low testosterone levels occurred in asymptomatic patients with normal bone density and LH levels were normal. These patients continue to be monitored. 2/19 multiply relapsed patients treated for acute leukemia had hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and were taking testosterone replacement. 8/19 patients had developed low testosterone with raised LH and had commenced testosterone replacement. We conclude that standard doses of TBI can cause testosterone defi ciency with evidence of leydig cell dysfunction in long-term survivors. Furthermore, new cases continue to occur more than 20 years after SCT. Annual surveillance is therefore required to identify this important complication of HSCT.",

Papalexandri (1) We present two cases with benign oligoclonal expansion of CD3+ Large Granular Lymphocytes (LGLs) causing transient myelosupression in a context of successive episodes of herpesvirus reactivation after allogeneic hematopoetic transplantation (allo-HSCT). They both developed a highly restricted T cell receptor \u03b2 chain (TRB) gene repertoire with common gene usage in the predominant clonotypes, implicating antigen involvement in their development. #1: A 27 year-old female was treated for CMV reactivation on day +45 after allo-HCT. Grade III neutropenia was noted, persisting for 5 months. After the recovery of hematopoiesis, EBV reactivation led to pre-emptive therapy with Rituximab and mild neutropenia developed, lasting for 7 months. Bone marrow (BM) aspiration revealed a hypocellular bone marrow. #2: A 14-year-old male presented with CMV gastritis on day +30 after allo-HCT, succeeded by grade III neutropenia for seven months. Five months later, EBV reactivation was treated with Rituximab and soon grade IV neutropenia was identifi ed. Examination of the BM aspirate revealed a hypercellular BM with hyperplastic myeloid series and shift to the left. In both cases further virologic and serologic screening was negative. Peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subpopulation analysis with fl ow cytometry revealed: i) inverted ratio of CD4/ CD8 lymphocytes, ii) absolute increase (>1.0 x 109/l) of CD3+/ CD8+ lymphocytes and iii) increased (>30%) CD3+/CD8+/CD57+ lymphocytes. T-cell receptor \u03b2 chain gene repertoire analysis was conducted i) after the CMV reactivation and ii) after the EBV reactivation episodes, respectively, and revealed: Case #1 Six clusters with 3 dominant clonotypes: (a) TRBV10-2/TRBD1/TRBJ2-7, 19.5%, (b) TRB27/TRBD2/TRBJ1-5, 9.7%, (c) TRBV6-5/TRBD1/TRBJ1-5, 36.6%.

There were no abnormalities reported in the delivered children observed in the follow up observation of mean 83 months. The exacerbation of underlying autoimmune disorder during and after pregnancy was reported in 1 patient. This data shows that pregnancy is feasible in women who underwent autologous HSCT for prior autoimmune diseases. The outcome of pregnancy in this population of patients is generally good. The low percentage of women who become pregnant after AHSCT could in part be explained by the age at transplantation. The exacerbation of underlying autoimmune disorder is possible, however due to the paucity of recorded cases, it is still impossible to draw any conclusion whether it could be connected with pregnancy.",

Salvage therapy before HSCT included ATO, with or without ATRA, in most patients (83%). Eighty-nine per cent of patients with available information were in molecular CR at time of HSCT (52/54 of autoHSCT, 22/29 of alloHSCT). Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 34 months , and from relapse to transplant 6.5 months (2.5-16) . Regarding alloHSCT, donor consisted of an HLA identical sibling in 25 patients and peripheral blood was the stem-cell source in 21 procedures. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 27 patients receiving alloHSCT, and did not include radiotherapy in most cases (22/32 alloHSCT, 52/57 autoHSCT) . After a median follow-up of 46 mos. , outcome after alloHSCT and autoHSCT was comparable, with a 5-year OS, LFS and relapse incidence of 62\u00b110% vs. 67\u00b18%, 56\u00b110% vs. 59\u00b18%, and 31\u00b19% vs. 34\u00b18%, respectively. Despite a trend to an inferior NRM after autoHSCT (vs. alloHSCT) was observed (5\u00b14% vs. 13\u00b16%, p=0.13), this difference did not achieve statistical signifi cance. Of note, out of 7 patients who underwent alloHSCT with detectable MRD prior to transplant, 6 patients were alive and disease-free at last followup (median, 50 mos., 32-81). In summary, the outcome of patients with relapsed APL who receive an autologous HSCT as consolidation strategy is relatively favorable, provided that a molecular response prior to the procedure is achieved. On the other hand, alloHSCT might remain as an alternative for patients failing to achieve a molecular response after salvage therapy. In multivariate analysis, the uCBT was found to be an independent factor providing lower RI (HR: 0.3, 95%CI: 0.11-0.82, p=0.02) but higher NRM (HR: 4.16; 95%CI: 1.46-11.9, p=0.008) leading to comparable survivals between both types of graft Conclusion: Despite better prognosis factors for pts of Auto group, results from this large study suggest that uCBT provide better disease control than auto-SCT in CR2 AML pts in the absence of a suitable donor. However, this disease control advantage after uCBT is counterbalanced by a higher NRM, highlighting the need for novel approaches aiming to decrease treatment related mortality after uCBT.",

With a median follow-up of 11.3 years (1.2-23), 10-year OS and LFS were 10\u00b12% and 7\u00b12% respectively; relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 10 years were 58\u00b13% and 35\u00b13%. ). An interval from 1st to 2nd alloSCT >10 months was also associated with better OS (HR 1.88) and LFS (HR 1.89), lower RI (HR 0.54) and lower NRM (HR 0.59). TBI was associated with lower RI (HR 0.53), better LFS (HR 1.68) and OS (HR 1.76). The use of PB as opposed to BM had a positive eff ect on NRM and was inversely correlated with RI. Considering the main adverse factors (no CR, no TBI at 2nd alloSCT, interval between 1st to 2nd alloSCT <10 months), patients without any adverse factor showed a 10-year OS and LFS of 44\u00b110% and 27\u00b19%, respectively, whereas the 10-year OS/ LFS was 6\u00b12%/4\u00b11% among patients having \u2265 1 adverse factor (p<0.0001; Figure 1 ). Based on the longest follow-up reported so far for 2nd alloSCT in AL, this retrospective analysis was able to identify a subset of patients with long-term benefi t from a 2nd alloSCT. Prognostic factors available at time of 2nd alloSCT can be used for clinical decisions. We retrospectively analyzed 1013 non-M3 AML patients undergoing ASCT in 72 GITMO centers up to December 2008; 531 were male and 482 female, with a median age of 47 years (range 2-78); conditioning regimens included Busulfan in 553 (55%) or other drug not including Busulfan in 312 (31%); 92 (9%) received TBI; in 56 (5%) conditioning was unknown. The 5 years Overall Survival (OS) and Leukemia Free Survival (LFS) in the whole population were 47% and 39% respectively. Among these patients 866 (85%) received ASCT in CR1, 63 in CR2 and the remaining with advanced disease (>CR2). According to the main cytogenetics and molecular markers (Foran JM, Hematology 2010, 47-55, Educational book), the 866 patients transplanted in CR1, have been categorized in 4 groups: group A, including 138 patients with favourable karyotype (K)/molecular markers: (t(8;21)(q22;q22); inv(16)(p13q22)/ t(16;16)(p13;q22); normal K with CEBPA or NPM1 mutant with FLT3-ITD-; group B: 147 patients with adverse K/molecular markers including: complex K (>3 abnormalities); inv(3)(q21q26)/ t(3;3)(q21;q26); -5,-5q,-7,-7q, other 11q23 abn, inv(3)(q21q26.2), t(3;3)(q21q26.2), t (6;9), t(9;22), abn(17p); FLT3-ITD+, in absence of favorable K; group C: 311 patients with cytogenetics abnormalities not encompassed in group A or B: (+8; t(3;5), t(9;11)(p22q23); other K abnormalities; absence of NPM1 mutation or FLT3-ITD; and group D, including 270 patients with normal K and unknown molecular markers. With a median F-U of 989 days (range 14-7543), the 5 years OS was 65% in group A; 44% in group B; 48% in group C and 51% in group D, with signifi cant diff erences between the groups A vs B, A vs C and A vs D (Fig. 1a) . LFS was 54% in group A; 35% in group B, 38% in group C and 44% in group D respectively, with signifi cant diff erences between the groups A vs B, A vs C, A vs D, B vs D, C vs D (Fig. 1b) . These data confi rm that the outcome of AML patients transplanted in CR1 is aff ected by cytogenetics and molecular factors; the patients of the groups A and D showed the best outcome; in patients of group B we observed an unexpected 35% 5 years LFS, without statistical diff erence, compared to group C while patients with normal K and unknown molecular markers showed a better outcome. Our results confi rm that ASCT in CR1 remains a suitable option in AML patients with normal-intermediate K. Many patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) relapse due to persistence of low numbers of residual leukemia cells that are undetectable by conventional cytomorphologic criteria. Achieving complete remission is often insuffi cient to predict long-term remission. The leukemia cell population undetectable by morphologic methods has been defi ned as a minimal residual disease (MRD).",

Introduction: Diagnostic karyotype is the most signifi cant prognostic factor in AML patients and provides the framework for current risk-stratifi ed treatment approaches. The aim of our study was to use this score for outcome prediction after HSCT in fi rst complete remission. Methods: We studied 167 AML patients with a median age of 26 years (range:2-63 yrs) who underwent HSCT in fi rst CR at Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research center. The median follow-up was 14 months (2-89 months Introduction: Although the role of autologous stem cell transplantation(ASCT) in the treatment of AML is controversial. It was still recommended as consolidation therapy for selective patients due to low TRM and potential anti-leukemia advantage. The relapse is main treatment failure. The current cohort study evaluated effi cacy of ASCT based on minimal residual disease (MRD) for patients with favorable-and intermediate-risk AML. Methods: Patients with de novel AML in favorable and intermediate-risk group younger than 60 years were eligible. Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvesting was started if patients achieved CR1 and MRD level was less than 0.1% after 1 to 2 courses of induction therapy(3+7) and at least 2-coursrs of consolidation therapy including high-doses Ara-C. MRD was monitored using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to quantify the RUNX1/RUNX1T1,CBFB-MYH11 transcript level and NPM1 mutation. ",

However, its application in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is controversial as leukemic blasts may express G-CSF receptors interacting with the cytokine. Hence, there may be concern about increased risk of relapse and reduced leukemia-free survival (LFS) when using G-CSF after autoHSCT in a setting of AML. The goal of our study was to verify this hypothesis based on a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of patients reported to the EBMT registry. Adults with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) treated with autoHSCT in fi rst complete remission between 1994-2010 were included in the analysis. Among 2093 subjects 972 Background: AlloSCT is a well-established therapy for patients with intermediate/high risk AML /MDS. The outcome of patients relapsing after alloSCT is dismal, but promising results have been achieved in an imminent relapse. The main obstacle has been that sensitive MRD-markers are not frequently available. Another potential method to predict relapse early for timely decision of pre-emptive immunotherapy is monitoring of chimerism. We hypothesized that targeting 100% donor chimerism measured by specifi c techniques in patients with ultra-high risk, viz AML with primary induction failure or blastic MDS with very poor cytogenetics, could result in a lower relapse risk. Methods: Microsatellite (short tandem repeat, STR) technique and a new chimerism analysis system (Abbott AlleleSEQR), based on quantitative PCR, were used to detect residual recipient-derived cells. Samples for STR-PCR were collected from bone marrow CD34-positive precursor fraction in addition to whole blood. More sensitive alleleSEQR was tested from peripheral blood. Posttransplant immunomodulation included LD-azacitidine, combined with escalated DLI on demand, in parallel with a rapid withdrawal of immunosuppression starting at week 7. Sequential conditioning according to Schmid et al (2006) , with minor modifi cations, was used as a preparative regimen. Immunosuppression consisted of ATG 5mg/kg, short methotrexate, and calcineurin inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Results: In this first pilot phase of the study, 10 patients were treated (AML n=7, blastic MDS n=3). One patient relapsed early, and two patients are too early to be evaluated (follow-up less than 6 months). Other seven patients, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, are in continuing MRD-negative CR. In this small but homogeneous patient cohort, a relapse rate was 12.5%, TRM was 0%, and consequently OS was 87.5%. Full donor chimerism (100%), assessed by sensitive techniques, was achieved in all patients. All patients developed grade >2 acute GVHD which was resolved in all cases. Four patients (50%) developed mild/moderate chronic GVHD, and one patient is still on immunosuppression due to limited GVHD after followup of 18 months. Conclusion: In conclusion, sensitive methods tracking small amounts of residual recipient-derived cells after alloSCT seem to be useful for timely decision of pre-emptive prevention of posttransplant relapse in patients with high-risk AML and MDS. However, more data are needed before defi nitive conclusions can be made. Figure 1A ) & event-free survival (EFS; P=.03; Figure 1B) 27.3%, p=0.0035). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 6.9% in the entire cohort; in the group of patients that received bone marrow stem cells it was higher (10.2%) compared to the group that received peripheral stem cells (4.3%).",

Krejci (1) Background: Sequential use of chemotherapy and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been proposed to improve the treatment outcomes in patients (pts) with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we present our experience in cohort of 60 AML pts. Methods: Patients fulfi lled at least one of following criteria: primary induction failure after 2 or more cycles of chemotherapy (n=9); fi rst early relaps after a remission duration of fewer than 6 months (n=15); relapse refractory to salvage combination therapy containing high-dose AraC (n=11); second or subsequent relaps (n=15); and presence of unfavorable cytogenetic (n=10). Fludarabine (30 mg/m2), cytarabine (2 g/m2), and amsacrine (100 mg/m2) for 4 days (FLAMSA) were used for cytoreduction. After 3 days of rest, RIC consisting of 4 Gy TBI, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius) 10-20 mg/kg/day for 3 days, and cyclophosphamide 40-60 mg/kg/day for 2 days followed. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte transfusions (pDLT) were given from day +120 in pts who were free of immunosupressive medication for at least 30 days without developing GvHD. Median age was 51 years. Types of donors and used grafts were as follows: HLA identical sibling, n=14; unrelated donor, n=46; PBSCs, n=56; BM, n=4. Results: The median time of neutrophil engraftment (above 0.5x10E9/L) was 17 days, 51 pts engrafted, 9 pts died in aplazia to day +30. Incidence of acute GvHD was evaluated in 51 pts: 47% (24/51) of pts had GvHD (grade I+II in 15 pts, grade III in 9 pts). Incidence of chronic GvHD was evaluated in 44 pts, 55% (24/44) of pts had GvHD (limited in 17 pts, extensive in 7 pts). The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year and 3 years was 25% (15/60) and 28% (17/60) . The other most frequent toxicities were grade III/IV infections according to common toxicity criteria in 43 of 51 pts and gastrointestinal toxicity (grade III in 15 of 51 pts). Complete remission was achieved in 47 of 51 pts (93%), progression was present in 4 pts (7%). Relapse of AML occurred in 18 pts. With the median follow-up of 37 months from SCT(range 10-69), the entire cohort had 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of 45% and 42%, respectively. Progression-free survival rates at these time points were 38% and 33%, respectively. Conclusion: The FLAMSA-RIC protocol can be recommended for treatment suitable high-risk AML pts with a chance of long-term survival for over 40% of these pts.",

Rabitsch (2) , HT Greinix (2), P. Kalhs (2) , M. Mitterbauer (2) , A. Schulenburg (2) , S. Woehrer (2) , N. Worel (2) , D. Strunk (3), W. Linkesch (3), C. Urban (3), W. Schwinger (3), C. Peters (4) , G. Gastl (5) , D. Nachbaur (5) , B. Kircher (5) , J. Clausen (6) , J. Auberger (6) Aim: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potent cure for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Reduced intensity conditioning regimens (RIC) are used to overcome HSCT-related drug toxicity. The study assesses the role of this regimen. Methods: Newly diagnosed ALL cases who candidate HSCT with full HLA matched sibling after obtain informed consent received reduced induction chemotherapy (Vincristine/Dexamethasone) and underwent early HSCT after disease stabilization within 15-30 days without intention to achieve CR. The comparison group was patients who received conventional chemotherapy followed by HSCT. Both group received busulfan/cyclophosphamide as conditioning regimen before peripheral blood source. Results: Totally, 80 patients were assessed, twenty eight patients in the study group and 52 patients in the comparison group. S399 and 61.4% (SE: 7.6%) in case and comparison groups, respectively (p=0.809). Death occurred in 8(35.7%) of cases (causes: relapse, GvHD) and 17(36.5%) of comparison group (causes: GvHD, relapse). Conclusion: Reduced induction followed by early transplantation without consolidation is not inferior then routine HSCT. Due to small size of patients and short time of follow-up a study with more cases and long time follow-up is recommended. A randomized study can reveal, if there is, the benefi t of this modality in ALL treatment. . There was no signifi cant diff erence in leukemia free survival (p=0.59), overall survival (p=0.577). Conclusion: Our results show that there is no diff erence for allogenic HCT results, when patients received or not received consolidation chemotherapy. Confi rmation of this preliminary data need more cases and longer time. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is successfully applied in treatment of paediatric patients with refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, relapse is still the major cause of death post-transplant and correlates signifi cantly with persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) prior to or after SCT. In order to reduce or clear MRD and, thus, preventing relapse in high-risk patients pre-and post-transplant, immunotherapy using a third-generation CD19-specifi c monoclonal antibody (mAb) is deployed in an ongoing compassionate use program at our institution. Through its improved capability to recruit Fc\u03b3RIIIA bearing eff ector cells, this Fc-optimized chimerized CD19-specifi c mAb (4G7SDIE) mediates enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells. The CD19 antigen is commonly expressed in paediatric leukaemias as it is continuously and stably expressed on all stages of B lineage diff erentiation and therefore a suitable target for immunotherapy. 6 paediatric patients with refractory B-lineage ALL and detectable MRD received a mean number of 12 infusions. In 5/6 patients infusions were applied prior to SCT. In 3/6 patients leukaemic load was reduced for \u2265 1 log and in 1/6 patients MRD was eradicated by 4G7SDIE. 2/6 patients relapsed, 4/6 patients are in remission (17-468 days) . Taken together a response could be documented in 4/6 patients. Concomitant in vitro studies with donor-derived PBMCs of patients (n=8/9) in 2 h-cytotoxicity assays showed that NK cells exerted insuffi cient lysis of primary B-lineage ALL blasts or paediatric pre B-ALL cell line MHH-CALL-4 (mean specifi c lysis: 6.1% / 4.4 %). However, lysis could be increased by 18.5 % and 18.9 % by adding 1 \u03bcg/ml 4G7SDIE (n=19; p=0.0024 / n=13; p=0.0018) or by 9.7% and 24.4 % by adding autologous patient serum taken 1 day after antibody treatment (n=21; p=0.0068 / n=15; p=0.0002). Serum titers of biologically active 4G7SDIE in patient serum samples were analyzed by a fl ow cytometry-based method and saturating and ADCC relevant serum titers of 4G7SDIE were detectable 13 days after antibody infusion. In conclusion, promising antileukaemic eff ects have been observed in vitro and in vivo in this compassionate use program. However, a further clinical trial will be necessary to investigate the capability of this therapeutic antibody to reduce relapse rates.",

Masszi St.Istvan and St.Laszlo Hospital (Budapest, HU) Introduction: Hyperleukocytosis is a rare but life-threatening condition. About 30-50 leukodepletions (LD) are performed yearly due to this indication in our center. Effi cient and fast white blood cell (WBC) depletion using older generation of cell separators needs high skill and is not without risk. Recently, an automated, separate leukodepletion (LD) program was developed for Spectra Optia: -automated interface management -possibility of giving fl uid substitution (FS) with automatic control of fl uid balance (FC) were incorporated as main new features into the system. Since December of 2011 till now, 21 LD procedures were done with this instrument. The aim of this study: We analyzed our fi rst experience with Optia in LD. Patients and methods: There were 9 patients (pts ) with acute leukemia (AL) and 9 pts with chronic leukemia (CL) (see the table). The following protocol was used: The indications of LD in our center: -Acute leukemia: hyperviscosity syndrome (HS) and/or blast cell count > 100 G/l -Chronic myeloid leukemia: HS or WBC count > 300 G/L or blast cell count >100 G/l -Chronic lymphoid leukemia: HS or WBC count > 500 G/l (>200 G/l, before rituximab) Our anticoagulation (AC) protocol: (low citrate toxicity allowing high speed procedure) -HAES steril-10% + ACDA (ratio: 1:1) + 2500 IU heparin/1 liter AC (unless in DIC) -AC : whole blood (WB) ratio = 1:9 -1:10 (setting of Qac: 2,4 ml/ total blood volume (TBV)/min) As red blood cell transfusion (RBC) sharply increases WB viscosity, it was given only during or after LD, never before. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was transfused, only if indicated. WB cell counts were checked at regular intervals. Buff y coat (BC) was collected in 1-5 fractions. Results: The results are summarized in the table (median values, range in brackets) and the graph. The LD was very well tolerated in all cases: 8 pts needed transfusion during the procedure and 7 were given only saline/albumin FS (AL: saline / albumine: 2, RBC: 2, FFP: 4; CL: saline / albumine: 5, FFP: 2). The treatment was highly effi cient in both, AL and CL respectively, with similar results. Our data prove the interface stability during LD (not shown). The automatic FC functioned very well, even at extreme circumstances (BC volume > pt's TBV). There was no serious side eff ect. Conclusion: Due to the high WBC, low PLT collection effi ciencies and the safety of automatic FC, Optia may be the 1st choice instrument for LD at present.",

All pts had more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM) with the median of BM blast 20% (range,6-75%), 28% of pts had blasts in peripheral blood and 5% of pts had extramedullary manifestation of AML. Donors were in 33% HLA identical related, 58% HLA matched unrelated and 9% HLA mismatched unrelated. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood with the median of infused CD 34+cells 6, 3x10 6 /kg (range,1, 8-13, 8x10 6 /kg).

With median follow-up 52 months (range,12-126 months) 15 pts (38%) are alive (13 pts in continuing CR), 12 pts (31%) relapsed and 10 of them died. 2 relapsed pts achieved subsequent CR lasting 28 and 68 months. 14 pts (36%) died due to TRM, 5 (13%) of them till day +100. The probabilities of 5-years PFS and OS are 35% and 40%. Conclusion: despite smaller number of evaluated pts and retrospective type of analysis our data suggest that fl udarabine and melphalan conditioning shows excellent early disease control and in association with early withdrawal of immunosuppresion can achieved continuing long-term CR with acceptable TRM and GVHD incidence in pts with AML beyond CR not eligible for myeloablative conditioning. Objective: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in childhood. Although about 80% of the paediatric patients can successfully be treated by standard therapy, especially the high risk patients are severely endangered in developing a relapse with a dismal prognosis. Somatic mutations in cancer are not only a hallmark of the disease, but can also lead to novel mutated peptide ligands presented by the MHC molecules of the transformed cell. These neoantigens are the ideal T cell target and thereby vaccine in theory, since neither tolerance mechanisms nor autoimmune reactions would interfere with the positive outcome of the therapy. However, they are mostly patient individual, limiting the possibilities of an off -the-shelf vaccine. Therefore we were establishing a patient individual ALL specifi c peptide vaccination strategy combining next generation sequencing (NGS) of the whole exome and the transcriptome of the patients' tumor and normal tissue with in silico epitope prediction for the patients' individual HLA type. Methods: Whole exome sequencing of seven c-ALL patients' leukemia and fi broblast (control tissue) DNA was performed. ALL specifi c single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as Insertions and Deletions (InDels) were identifi ed using a comparative bioinformatics pipeline. The transcriptome of the patients' ALL blasts was analyzed by next generation RNA sequencing and the expression of the mutations was determined. Putative epitopes containing the mutated sequences were predicted specifi cally for the patients HLA type using SYFPEITHI, NetMHC and NetMHCpan. Results: The analysis of the tumor specifi c mutanome of seven pediatric c-ALL patients revealed on average 31 cancer specifi c nonsynonymous mutations (SNVs and InDels) per patient. Out of these, an average of about 30 patient individual MHC class I epitope candidates was predicted. Several already described cancer genes, as well as genes linked to leukaemia like JAK2, TP53 or PTPN11 were somatically mutated in the patient's blast. However, the detected mutations but also the aff ected genes were highly individual among the patients, as only in three genes alterations were determined in two and three patients respectively. The results underline the high potential of an actively individualized vaccination approach in these patients.",

Kim (2) , Y. Ko (2) , K. Kim (2) , C. Jung (2) , H. Lee (3) (1) We previously published data that suggested that induction of an autologous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has an anti-leukemic eff ect, consequently increasing the survival rate of patients who undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Here we report the long term follow up data regarding the overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). In total, 22 acute myeloid leukemia patients with favorable and intermediate cytogenetic risk, in their fi rst complete remission, were administered cyclosporine c.i.v. from day 0 to day +28 at a dose of 3.0 mg/~kg per day and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3 ) at 0.025 mg/~m2 s.c. every other day from day +14 to day +42 following autologous PBSCT. Natural-killer (NK) -cell activity assays and skin biopsies were performed. Engraftment was successful in all patients at a median of 13 days without any signifi cant additional toxicity. Histologically confi rmed that cutaneous GVHD had developed in 12 patients, and NK-cell activity was signifi cantly augmented after the autologous PBSCT in those patients (P=0.03). After a median follow-up duration of 153.6 months (range, 122.3-188.8), the 3-year DFS and OS rates were 68.2% and 72.7%, respectively, and the 5-year DFS and OS rates were 63.6% and 73%, respectively. They were without signifi cant correlation with GVHD status or augmentation of NK-cell activity. The median OS was unreached yet. Fourteen patients (63 % ) are still alive without relapse or other related disease, nor were there secondary malignancies. This data suggests that the administration of cyclosporine and IFN-\u03b3 following autologous PBSCT improves OS and DFS, which may be attributable to the antileukemic eff ect, although no diff erence in survival rates could be demonstrated between cutaneous GVHD-positive and -negative groups.",

Shimoni, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Ramat Gan, IL) AML relapse after Allo-SCT is associated with a poor outcome. Therapy in pts relapsing early after SCT is further limited by the fear for an increased toxicity. GO was introduced into therapy of CD33 positive AML pts as a targeted therapy with limited extramedullary toxicity profi le. We hypothesized that in pts with AML relapsing early after an Allo-SCT, combination of GO with single agent chemotherapy will result in disease control for a sufficient amount of time to allow a trial of GvL induction. Therapy consisted of ARA-C (1 gr/m 2 days 1-4) followed by GO, 9 mg/m 2 (day 5) and was supported by donor stem cells, when available. In the abscence of GVHD, responding pts where eligible for DLI or a second Allo-SCT. 16 pts (F=10 M=6), median age 52 years (range 26-63) are included in this analysis. Most (14/16) were previously transplanted for a high risk AML (secondary AML-6, unfavorable cytogenetics-5, FLT3-ITD-3); disease status at SCT were CR1 (n=8), who were got complete remission (0.336\u00b10.147) and nromal control (0.218\u00b10.125)( p < 0.01) . The expression RUNX2 in HOX11+ cell lines was signifi cantly lower than HOX11-cell lines, and the expression level of RUNX2 in the HOX11+ T-ALL patients (0.581 \u00b1 0.257) was signifi cantly lower than HOX11-T-ALL patients (0.835 \u00b1 0.317). The relationship between RUNX2 and HOX11 mRNA expression level was a negative correlation. The methyIation rate of the promoter CpG isIands of RUNX2 gene in HOX11+ T-ALL (78.9%) was signifi cantly higher than HOX11-ALL (36.8%) (P<0.01). The expression levels of RUNX2 gene was negatively correlated with the methylation of CpG island in it's promoter region in T-ALL. Conclusion: HOX11 is a negative regulator of RUNX2 gene and the expression of RUNX2 is downregnlated or even lost by promoter methylation in T-ALL, which demonstrate a better event-free survival and a marked trend for longer overall survival for TLX1-high T-ALLs. The expression and methylation level of RUNX2 gene may have some signifi cance in evaluating the curative eff ect of T-ALL patients. The abnomal expression of RUNX2 might be a prognostic marker in T-ALL patients.",

While cytokine profi les are useful markers to defi ne T cell subsets, plasma cytokines may not reveal the distinct cytokine milieu in a GVHD target organ. We present cytokine profi les from the skin of children with acute and chronic skin GVHD to implicate the T helper subset responsible for its pathophysiology. A novel methodology of obtaining skin samples noninvasively using an epidermal skin patch called D Squame (CuDerm, Dallas, TX) was used. Methods: D-squame skin sampling discs were placed on the forearm/wrist of 13 pediatric patients (ages 0.25 years-14 years) for 2 minutes and removed. Samples were obtained from the involved area of the forearm/wrist in acute skin GVHD and from visually and palpably involved and uninvolved skin in chronic GVHD. This procedure was painless and safe even for young infants. Superficial keratinocytes were sampled by the fully cured medical grade polyacrylate ester adhesive on the disc. Cytokines were extracted from the sampling discs using a buff er made of phosphate buffered saline and 0.25 molar saline and analyzed using a 38 plex human cytokine Milliplex MAP magnetic bead panel (EMD Millipore Corp, Billerica, MA). Patients were divided into 4 groups; acute skin GVHD (n=5), chronic skin GVHD (n=2), no GVHD (n=2) and healthy pediatric controls (n=4).",

Reinhardt (1) Objectives: Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is one of the major live threatening complications of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Th17 cells have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of GvHD. The aim of this study was to investigate the infl uence of monocytes and their interaction with proinfl ammatory S100 proteins and 90kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) on the induction of Th17 cells in patients with GvHD. Methods: CD4+ T cells from healthy donors were co-cultured with monocytes from patients with or without GvHD or healthy donors in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody for 5 days on various time points prior and after allogeneic HCT. Optionally, monocytes were additionally stimulated with S100 proteins. For inhibition of Hsp90, monocytes were incubated with 17-Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) for 16 hours before co-culturing with CD4+ T cells. After 5 days, cells were stimulated for 5 hours with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of monensin. For fl ow cytometric analysis, cells were harvested, stained for cell surface markers, fi xed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-IL17 antibody. For determining the concentration of S100 proteins in the stool of patients Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) were carried out. Results: Monocytes from patients with acute and chronic skin or gut GvHD induce signifi cant higher percentages of Th17 cells compared to monocytes of healthy donors or patients without GvHD (p<0.0001). Inhibition of Hsp90 in monocytes resulted in a signifi cant decrease in Th17 cells pointing towards an important role of Hsp90 in GvHD. Additionally, induction of Th17 cells could be further enhanced by stimulation of monocytes with either S100 A8, S100 A9 or S100 A8/A9. Furthermore, the concentration of S100A12 was increased in the stool of patients with gut GvHD compared to patients without GvHD. Conclusion: Our fi ndings suggest that monocytes may play a major role in the pathogenesis of GvHD by triggering the induction of Th17 cells. S100 A8, S100 A9 and S100A8/9 could further enhance monocyte-induced Th17 cell development. Hsp90 might be an important regulator in monocyte-induced development of Th17 cells and might therefore be a therapeutic target for GvHD.",

Yekhtina, M.Y, Shapira Hadassah -Hebrew University Medical Cen (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: we previously showed that multi-donor transplantation (MDT) in a murine breast cancer model suppresses GVHD while augmenting the GVT eff ect. Here we aimed to assess whether the GVT augmentation is present in a diff erent tumor model and by what mechanism is the GVHD suppressed. Methods: Following total body irradiation of 7.5 Gy on day -1, T-cell repleted bone marrows from C57BL/6, C3H alone or together (MDT) were transplanted into BALB/c mice. The recipient mice were also injected with IV 104 cells B-169 melanoma cells. We followed the development of GVHD, melanoma metastases and Tregs level in the recipient mice. Results: Again, we found that MDT composed by C57BL/6 and C3H cells transplanted into BALB/c resulted with signifi cantly suppress GVHD (measured by the Cooke grading system; p<0.01) as compare to those transplanted from C57BL/6 or C3H alone. The number of lung metastases at +30d was signifi cantly lower (p<0.001) with MDT as compared to all controls (BALB/c, C57BL/6 or C3H transplanted alone; fi gure 1). All splenic Tregs in the MDT group originated from the C57BL/6 donors. The Tregs level was signifi cantly higher in the MDT group (p<0.0002 in MDT vs. C57BL/6, p<0.02 MDT vs. C3H; fi gure 2). Conclusion: We conclude that MDT's anti tumor eff ect is present with various tumors. Despite the transplantation of 2 donors simultaneously, splenic Tregs were composed only by C57BL/6 cells and were signifi cantly increased as compared to single donor transplantation. This may explain the suppression of GVHD, but the increased GVT is yet to be elucidated.",

Elmaagacli University of Duisburg-Essen (Essen, DE) Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of 19-24 nucleotide noncoding RNAs, which aff ect the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells by binding to a 3\u00b4-untranslated region which target messenger RNAs. MiRNAs plays important roles in many cellular processes such as development, stem cell division, apoptosis and cancer. We profi led miRNAs expressed on patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Here we analyzed in a retrospective study 258 patients (pts) for miRNAs expression in whole blood that underwent allogeneic HSCT and analyzed their outcome. MiRNA expressions were performed by miRNA-specifi c real time RT-PCR. Results: In this cohort 84 pts received grafts from HLA-identical siblings (32%), 126 pts from matched (49%) and 48 pts from mismatched (19%) unrelated donors. Transplantat consisted of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells (n=228, 88%) or bone marrow (n=30, 12%) . Of all pts, 59 (23%) had relapsed and 25 (10%) died of October 2012. There was no signifi cant correlation between miRNA expressions from siblings and unrelated donors. For miRNA-181, we found a moderate up-regulation in mismatched unrelated donors versus matched donors (489 vs. 330%, p<0.06). Analysis of each miRNAs for relapse or TRM showed no statistically diff erences. Among all pts, 208 (81%) developed acute GVHD (86 pts had an aGvHD of grade \u22652). There was a signifi cant diff erences between low level of miRNA-146 (519 \u00b1 507% vs. 799 \u00b1 1308%; p<0.04), and high level of miRNA-let7 (665 \u00b1 422% vs. 535 \u00b1 332%, p<0.04) of pts with aGvHD \u2265 2. In pts with severe aGVHD (grade >3) comparing all other aGvHD pts., we found a high signifi cant reductions of miRNA-146 (308% vs. 723%, p<0.0001), and miRNA-21 (506% vs. 2358%, p<0.02). In regard to chronic GvHD, we found a downregulation of miRNA-let7 expressions in pts with severe cGVHD (498% vs. 639%, p<0.03) comparing other cGVHD. The probability of severe aGvHD with low level of miRNA-146 (< 387%, p<0.001) is 21 \u00b1 7% versus 7 \u00b1 4% with higher levels of miRNA-146 levels. However, an estimate for death in remission or overall survival was not signifi cantly associated with miRNAs. Conclusions: These results suggest that pts with diff erent expression of miRNA-146, miRNA-21 and miRNA-let7 confi rms a relevant association of the development of aGVHD and miRNA profi lings could be an early indicator of severe acute GvHD.",

The role of genetic background and eff ector cells migration into the target tissues is currently investigated in the pathobiology of aGvHD. Methods: A total of 219 patients were evaluated for the presence of NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation using single nucleotide polymorphism technique (SNP) by assessing polymorphism of SNP8, SNP12 and SNP13.Thirty fi ve gastrointestinal biopsies taken from patients with clinical symptoms of aGvHD were analyzed by immunocytochemical staining for the presence of cellular infi ltrates (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD138) including detection of IL-17, FOXP3. Results: The NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation was assessed in 11% of HSCT recipients, in 13% of HSCT donors and in 5.5% when both donor and recipient have gene mutated. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality was 64% when recipient (p=0.021; log-rang test) and 35% when donor were aff ected with NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation (NS) compared to patients without NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation. If the mutation involved both recipient and donor this proportion increases to 75% (p=0.016; log-rang test). NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation was also associated with susceptibility to severe GvHD grade III-IV and this aff ected 36% of patients when both recipient and donor were involved compared to 25% when recipient and 29% when donor have NOD2/CARD15 gene mutated and 16% without gene mutation. In all biopsies gut epithelium was damaged by cellular infi ltrates composed predominantly with CD8+ T-cells and proportion of IL-17 producing cells. When donor and recipient were carrier NOD2/ CARD15 gene mutation severe lesions in the gut epithelium were associated with abundant infi ltration of IL-17+ cells compared of the ones without gene mutation. Conclusions: NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation is associated with severity of intestinal aGvHD. Patients aff ected with NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation have worse prognosis for posttransplant outcome and survival compared to these without gene mutation.

In this study we focused on the presence of IL-17+ cells in aff ected tissues in association with clinical manifestations and NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation. Methods: Thirty six biopsies were taken from 20 pts with cGvHD lesions after PBPC (n=18) or BMT (n=2) from sibling (n=12) or matched unrelated donors (n=8). Conditioning regimen (myeloablative -6 pts or reduced intensity conditioning -14 pts) included ATG -15 pts and Campath -3 patients. Skin was involved in all cases (poikiloderma and/or scleroderma-like lesions). 14 out of 20 pts had oral mucosa lesions and resulted in impairment of feeding and painful ulcerations. Gastric and intestinal mucosa lesions resulted in vomits and diarrhea in 5 cases. Biopsy specimens: skin (n=24), gastrointestinal tract (n=7) and oral mucosa (n=5) were analyzed for the composition of cellular infi ltrates (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD138) including detection of IL-17, FOXP3 and CCR6 positive cells. Co-expression of CCR6+/IL-17+ and IL-17+/CD138+ were verifi ed by double immunostaining. NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation was assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of SNP8, SNP12 and SNP13 using LightCycler 480 instrument.",

Conclusions: Activity of IL-17+ cells in the skin is supported by traffi cking receptor CCR6+, but in the gut by CD138+ cells, and is associated with the infl ammatory process in a course of cGVHD. NOD2/CARD15 gene mutations are associated with severity of cGvHD and oral mucosa lesions. Graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) eff ects are considered to play a major role in the maintenance of remission after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These eff ects are believed to be mediated by functional tumor-associated antigen (TAA)specifi c donor-derived T cells, although the clear evidence of functional TAA-specifi c T cells has not been demonstrated so far. Wilms tumor protein-1 (WT1) is one of the most intensively investigated TAAs in the fi eld of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, we synthesized 5 peptides derived from WT1 which were selected as a candidate of peptide for HLA A*24:02 by the prediction algorithm SYFPEITH, and these peptides were screened using interferon (IFN)-g intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to identify immunogenic peptides and the presence of functional TAA-specifi c T cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 60 patients after allogeneic HSCT. Eighteen patients out of 38 patients (47%) with HLA A*02:01 and none without HLA A*02:01 had positive results in ICS, irrespective of the presence of HLA A*24:02. There was no correlation between the presence of WT1-specifi c T cells and the incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The median frequency of positive WT1-specifi c T cells and CMV pp65 495-503-specifi c T cells was 0.76% (range 0.07%-6.48%) and 1.00% (range 0.06%-9.95%), respectively. There was no signifi cant diff erence between the frequency of WT1-specifi c T cells and that of CMV pp65 495-503-specifi c T cells (P=0.794), even though the functional avidity of WT1 peptide was far less than that of CMV pp65 495-503 peptide as demonstrated by serial peptide dilution assays. The majority of WT1-specifi c T cells was CD107a positive (median 72%; range 50-93%) with mainly eff ector phenotype. IFNg induction by WT1 peptide and CMV pp65 495-503 peptide was also detectable using ELISPOT assays. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated the persistence of WT1-specifi c T cells in 2 patients and these WT1-specifi c T cells had the same restricted T cell receptor Vb at diff erent time points. Expanded WT1-specifi c T cells lysed peptide-loaded T2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These T cells also lysed WT1+HLA A2+ acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and ML-2), but not WT1-HLA A2+ lymphoma cell line (DG75).",

Kouttab Roger Williams Medical Center (Providence, US) Owed to its inhibiting activity on dendritic cells (DC), bortezomib (Bor), a reversible proteasome inhibitor, is being incorporated in graft versus host disease (GvHD) prevention regimens with promising results. We aimed to examine the activity of new proteasome inhibitors individually and in combinations on DC maturation. Carfi lzomib and oprozomib are active on both the constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome. PR-825 has more potent activity on the \u03b25 subunit of proteasome and ONX 0914 and PR-924 on LMP7 subunit of immunoproteasome. DC from blood of healthy volunteer donors were isolated using a negative selection procedure, treated (2 10?5) with the subject drug(s) for 1-4 hours (depending on the drug tested) at 37oC. After 3 washings with cell media, the cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 h at 37oC followed by a fi nal large volume wash. The cells were then harvested and incubated with fl uorescent conjugated antibodies to DC maturation markers (DC-SIGN, CCR7, CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, and CD86) and fl ow cytometry analysis was performed. Experiments were run in triplicate or quadruplicate and the results were compared to control and Bor (10 nM, 4 h) utilizing unpaired two-sided t-test. Carfi lzomib (30 nM, 1 h) and PR-924 (1000 nM, 1 h) were superior to control in suppressing the expression of all markers. Oprozomib (100 and 300 nM, 1 h) was superior to the control for 6 and 7 markers. ONX 0914 (200 nM, 1h) and PR-825 (125 nM, 1 h) were superior to control for 6 and 1 markers respectively. Furthermore, oprozomib at 100 nM was equal to Bor for 6 markers and at 300 nM was superior for 3 markers. The combinations of ONX 0914 and PR-825 and of PR-924 and PR-825 at the above concentrations were superior to control for 5 and 6 markers respectively. While ONX 0914 and PR-825 were inferior to Bor for 4 and 6 markers, the combination was equal to Bor for 6 markers. PR-924 alone was inferior to Bor for 5 markers but equal to Bor for all markers when combined with PR-825. In summary, we have demonstrated that some new molecules are active and inhibit DC maturation to variable degrees and that targeting the constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome simultaneously is needed for optimal activity on DC. Confi rmatory studies with mixed lymphocyte reaction and quantitative RT-PCR of I\u03baB are being conducted and the results will be presented.",

Greinix (7) Introduction: In this study we propose a risk score to predict acute and/or chronic GvHD utilising clinical and genetic/biomarker variables. Methods Selected clinical variables were initially summed and an association was found between clinical risk score and outcome. Further potential genetic/biomarker predictors were additionally evaluated with a view to establishing if sensitivity and specifi city could be improved. Results: In a cohort consisting of 442 HLA-matched sibling patient and donor pairs where the transplants were non T cell depleted, a strong association existed between clinical risk score and both the incidence of acute GvHD II-IV and chronic GvHD. Further investigation revealed that the donor IL10 haplotype ATA/ACC (rs1800872, rs1800871 and rs1800896), donor glucocorticoid receptor haplotype (rs6198, rs33389 and rs33388) ACA and recipient IL 10-592 SNP Any A (rs1800872) improved the goodness of fi t when viewed in association with the clinical risk score for acute GvHD II-IV; no such genetic factors were found when modelling chronic GvHD but donor IL 4 Any T (rs2243250) did show a strong univariate association. It was established that the association between outcome and clinical risk score was still strong in a full cohort comprising of T cell replete and depleted patients (HLA matched siblings and unrelated donors). However, the association between the genetic factors and outcome was weaker. Specifi c biomarkers (CXCL10, CXCL11, IL-33 and BAFF) were therefore assessed as alternatives to genetic factors in a smaller cohort. It was found that BAFF (recorded at 14 days post transplant) was an additional predictor for acute GvHD II-IV and, when added to a model containing the clinical risk score, sensitivity improved from 64% to 86% and specifi city from 69% to 81% (N=30). Conclusion: Preliminary analysis has demonstrated that a statistical model can be constructed to predict occurrence of acute GvHD II-IV and chronic GvHD using clinical factors. Genetic factors could improve the goodness of fi t of a model when viewed alongside a clinical risk score, however, we were unable to confi rm the result in a second cohort. As an alternative to genetic factors, biomarkers could, however, be used as additional predictors. Further work is under way to validate the results in independent cohorts.",

Junghans Roger Williams Medical Center (Providence, US) Bortezomib (Bor) inhibits dendritic cell (DC) maturation in part by blocking the nuclear factor-\u03ba B (NF-\u03ba B) pathway. In normal T cell, NF-\u03ba B translocation into the nucleus occurs only in stimulated, not resting cells, allowing for development of immune tolerance. Cyclophosphamide (Cy) kills also alloreactive proliferating T cells while sparing resting cells. Hence, the combination of Bor and Cy seems attractive for prevention of graft versus host disease (GvHD). Blood samples from 6 patients enrolled in an institutional review board-approved phase I feasibility trial were collected at specifi c time points. Bor was given on day 0, 6 hours after transplant and on day +4 at an escalating dose from 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m 2 . Cy was given on days +3 and +4 at a fi xed dose of 50 mg/kg. The control subjects were transplanted during the same period and received mycophenolate mefotil and cyclosporine for prevention of GvHD. All patients received the same supportive care according to established protocols. Pan DC were isolated by negative selection from samples obtained on day 0 before transplant, +1, +4, and +7. CD4 cells were isolated by positive selection from samples obtained on days +7, +14, and +21. DC from days 0, +1, +4, and +7 were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide for 18 hours, stained with fl uorescent conjugated antibodies to DC maturation markers CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, DC-SIGN, and CCR7, and then analyzed by fl ow cytometry. Autologous DC-CD4 mixed lymphocyte reaction was performed using DC from day 0 as stimulator and CD4 cells from days +7, +14, and +21 as responders. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) incorporation was measured after 4 days of incubation with fl uorescent anti-BrDU antibody using fl ow cytometry. An adequate number of DC was not obtained in every instance to perform all the planned experiments. The results were analyzed using t-test. In comparison to the control group, the expression of all DC markers on days +1, +4, and +7 and the incorporation of BrDU on days +7, +14, and +21 were statistically signifi cantly decreased in the study group in comparison to the control group in all tested samples. The expression of all markers was also signifi cantly decreased in the study group on days +1, +4, and +7, in comparison to samples obtained on day 0. Taken together, our data suggest that post transplant Bor and Cy eff ectively inhibit DC maturation in response to immunogenic stimulation and impair T cell priming and proliferation and that their eff ect was detectable to at least up to 21 days.",

Fu, Y. Wang, H. Huang Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, CN) Objectives: CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1/CEBPA) is mutated in approximately 8% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and, has been received as a predictive marker of outcome in patients with normal karyotype. Furthermore, we have provided the fi rst report of multiple mutations of CEBPA contributing to the transformation of donor cells to the leukemic phenotype after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (H Xiao, Blood 2011; 117: 5257-5260) . Despite murine models provide the functional consequences of C/EBP-\u03b1 in human hematopoiesis and how diff erent mutations contribute to abrogate the protein function have received less attention. Methods: In our previous research, we have identifi ed 3 diff erent CEBPA gene mutants forms involved in donor cell leukemia, which disrupted 3 major functional domains of C/EBP-\u03b1 respectively. The patient and his donor-sister both harbored the N-terminal germline mutation (584-589dup disrupting the TAD2 domain of protein). Susceptible donor hematopoietic cells evolved to overt AML by developing two somatic CEBPA mutations, the N-terminal mutation (247dupC causing overproduction of truncated 30-KDa isoform (p30) lacking the TAD1 domain) and the C-terminal mutation (914-916dup disrupting the bZIP domain), in the patient's microenvironment. We used these 3 mutants forms, as well as CEBPA wide type to subclone into pLenti6.3-MSC vector. Eight leukemia cell lines, mouse myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3 and human and mouse hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells were transduced by diff erent mutants forms. C/EBP-\u03b1 functions including antileukemia eff ect, cell cycle arrest and granulocyte diff erentiation were analyzed. Results: (1) Three C/EBP-\u03b1 protein mutants showed an increased cytoplasmic localization, diff erent from nuclear localization of wide type. (2) The N-terminal germ-line mutation retains the function of inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells, however, blockage the eff ect of cell cycle arrest of C/EBP-\u03b1. (3) The C-terminal mutation and p30 abrogate the eff ect of inducing apoptosis, furthermore the C-terminal mutation inhibited G-CSF-induced diff erentiation of 32Dcl3 cells into mature neutrophiles. (4) Three mutants forms all impair the ability of colony-forming of hematopoietic stem cell. Conclusions: Our data provide clues to support that the N-terminal mutation of CEBPA works as a class I mutation while the C-terminal mutation works as a class II mutation in inducing leukemia.",

The content of reactive oxygen species is balanced by antioxidative systems, which include enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), however, studies investigating the enzymes' impact on outcome after HSCT are limited. Therefore, we have analyzed the Cu-Zn SOD levels of 42 patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSCT from HLA-matched family and unrelated donors. Cu-Zn SOD levels were measured in serum at various time points before and after HSCT and were expressed as median levels \u00b1 standard error.

Winkler, P. Kalhs, W. Rabitsch, S. Knapp, H.T. Greinix Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, AT) Introduction: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse of malignant disease have remained challenges of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) impacting on patients' survival and quality of life. Adiponectin (APN) and Resistin (RES) are adipocytokines produced by visceral fat tissue. Whereas APN predominantly exerts anti-infl ammatory eff ects and is an important regulator of infl ammatory responses, RES acts as a pro-infl ammatory agent and poses a major link between obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and certain systemic autoimmune diseases associated with chronic infl ammation. Patients and Methods: Between November 2008 and August 2010 we prospectively measured serum concentrations of APN, RES and other infl ammatory markers such as fi bronectin (FNC), serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (HPT) by ELISA collected from patients after autologous (n=12) or allogeneic HCT (n=28) on admission (7 days prior HCT), on the day of transplantation (T0), during aplasia, on the day of engraftment defi ned by a granulocyte count >0.5 G/l, 4 weeks after HCT, 3 to 6 months, and 6 to 12 months after HCT, respectively. Results: In patients with acute GVHD grades II-IV signifi cantly higher APN levels (23.4 vs 9.6, p=0.04) and APN/body mass index (BMI) ratios (1 vs 0.4, p=0.01) and decreased SAA (31 vs 145, p=0.04) were observed prior to onset of acute GVHD. Patients dying with relapse of malignant disease had signifi cantly lower APN levels (8.2 vs 30.4, p=0.0075) and APN/BMI ratios (0.3 vs 1.1, p=0.004) before HCT compared to patients surviving without relapse. After day 10 RES levels (8.6 vs 4.1, p=0.01) were significantly higher in patients dying of relapse compared to ones alive without recurrence of malignant disease. Decreased HPT levels at the time of engraftment (62 vs 163, p=0.003) as well as increased RES levels (8.6 vs 14, p=0.012) from day 0 until 6 months after HCT were signifi cantly associated with later deaths. Conclusion: Adipocytokines and other infl ammatory markers could be predictive for occurrence of acute GVHD, relapse and mortality of patients undergoing HCT. Larger patient cohorts are warranted to confi rm preliminary results.",

Thol, E. Dammann, W. K\u00fchnau, E. Mischak-Weissinger, S. Buchholz, M. Eder, J. Krauter, A. Ganser Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) from HLA-mismatched donors exposes recipients to an increased risk for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, it is unknown whether this improves or impedes the graft-versusleukemia (GvL) eff ect required to control malignancies at high relapse risk. Patients: To address this question, we retrospectively evaluated two cohorts of high risk patients experiencing strong GvHD/GvL reactions: (1) 300 patients transplanted for acute leukemias (AL) and advanced myelodysplasias (MDS) from 2006 through 2011 (90 percent at high relapse risk), and (2) 107 recipients of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) for relapsing AL and advanced MDS between 1996 and 2011. For both cohorts, information on HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 alleles were available in both recipients and donors. Results: In the fi rst cohort (300 AL/MDS patients after alloHSCT, 2006-2011), we found a trend towards a disadvantage in diseasefree survival (DFS) at 5 years for 70 mismatched compared to 230 fully matched transplants (34% versus 49%, p = 0.072), whereas overall survival (OS), relapse incidence (RI) and treatment related mortality (TRM) were not signifi cantly diff erent. Focussing onto the subgroup with severe graft-versus-host disease (acute GvHD grades II to IV or extensive chronic GvHD; n = 89), 24 patients after mismatched transplants had signifi cantly worse relapse incidence (39% versus 14%, p = 0.042), 5-year-DFS (24% versus 54%, p= 0.003), and 5-year-OS (29% versus 56%, p= 0.009), as compared to 65 fully matched transplant recipients, whereas only a trend was seen for TRM (59% versus 38%, p = 0.059). Conversely, in patients with less severe (n = 95) or without any GvHD (n = 101), there was no diff erence in OS, DFS, RI or TRM between fully matched and mismatched transplants. In the second cohort (107 AL/MDS recipients of therapeutic DLI, 1996-2011), a landmark analysis starting from the fi rst DLI demonstrated a trend to inferior 5-year-OS for 25 mismatched as compared to 82 fully matched DLI recipients (9% versus 25%, p= 0.085). Loss of mismatch has recently been proposed as a relapse mechanism in haploidentical transplantation. However, when we examined uniparental disomy in mismatched DLI patients by HLA retyping at relapse, we found a loss of mismatch in only four out of 25 patients (16%). Conclusion: HLA-mismatches seem to compromise GvL after alloSCT for high risk AL and MDS.",

Nagra (2) , J. Nunnick (2) , E. Nikolousis (3), R. Malladi (2) , M. Griffi ths (4), C. Craddock (2) Mixed chimerism (MC), the presence of residual recipient and donor derived haematopoietic cells, can be observed in patients following reduced intensity conditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-SCT) for haematological malignancy. Whilst some studies reported MC to be a risk factor for disease relapse, others have observed that persistent stable MC does not correlate with relapse, suggesting that durable graft versus tumour eff ects (GvT) can exist without achieving full donor chimerism (FC). In addition, many studies associate MC with robust immune tolerance, suffi cient to sustain solid organ transplantation without the need for supplementary immunosuppression. Such tolerance is thought to involve central and peripheral processes, but the mechanisms regulating immune tolerance and alloreactivity in MC remain unclear. We identifi ed patients with stable mixed and full donor chimerism following RIC-SCT and studied the phenotype and function of peripheral blood T cells. The only signifi cant clinical diff erence between the two cohorts was an increased incidence of aGvHD in the FC population, which has been observed in other studies. Flow cytometric analysis showed that T cell number in MC patients was twice that of FC patients, whilst the number of na\u00efve cells increased 4 times. The highest T cell number was seen in patients in whom MC was selectively observed in the T cell compartment. This supports a theory that continued interactions between donor DC and both donor and host T cells are of importance maintaining MC. To assess the function of FC and MC T cells, they were cultured in vitro with PHA or recipient (host) APC derived pre-transplant. Diff erences between FC and MC responses to host APC in vitro were only observed early post transplant where a signifi cantly lower proportion of MC CD4+25-T cells were present post culture. In this scenario, MC CD4+25-T cell cytokine production was suppressed, consistent with the induction of an adaptive tolerance. However, CD4+25-T cells derived from MC late post transplant were present at higher proportions than the same cohort derived early post transplant, and produced more IL-10 in particular. In corollary, CD4+25+ T cells derived from MC late post transplant produced less IFNg and IL-10. Overall, these fi ndings are consistent with a proposed theory that tolerance to host is not reliant upon dominant peripheral mechanisms (which would require antigen educated regulatory T cells), but is ensured by adaptive and later central tolerogenic mechanisms.",

Generation of tryptophan metabolites by IDO is an eff ective mechanism in IDO-mediated T cell suppression. Our previous study reported that exogenous administration of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid , the most potent metabolite, into the allogeneic bone marrow transplanted mice reduced acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) lethality by inhibition of alloreactive T cell expansion . In addition to aff ecting donor T cells, we investigated whether 3-HAA indirectly suppresses alloreactivity of donor T cells through inhibiting dendritic cell (DCs) activation. Methods: We generated bone marrow-derived DCs and treated them with various concentration of 3-HAA for 6 hrs before LPS stimulation. Phenotype of the cell for maturation was analyzed by fl ow cytometry. Cytokine levels were measured in the cell culture supernatants using Flex-Set analysis. Allo-stimulatory capacity of BMDCs was measured on allogenenic mixture-lymphocyte reaction (MLR).",

Blood, 2011) . Although the detection of 6pUPD by the SNP array may be useful for predicting a response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in AA patients, the assay cannot be performed promptly enough to use the results to choose the optimal therapy for newly diagnosed patients and may not be suffi ciently sensitive to detect small populations of 6pUPD(+) cells. The effi cacy of detecting leukocytes lacking HLA-A alleles using fl ow cytometry as a SNP array substitute was examined to overcome these problems. Patients and methods: HLA-A alleles of 114 (28 newly diagnosed and 86 pretreated) patients with AA were determined and the HLA-A allelic expression by leukocytes of the patients that were found to be heterozygous for the HLA-A allele were assessed using fl ow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies specifi c to A24, A2, A26, and A31. Results: 68 (59.6%) patients were assessable for the presence of HLA-A allele-lacking leukocytes due to their heterozygosity in two of the four alleles. Leukocytes lacking one of the two HLA-A alleles were detected in 6 (46.5%) newly-diagnosed and 19 (34.5%) pretreated patients with 3.9%-61.1% (median 8.4%) and 10.3%-99.4% (median 54.2%) of total granulocytes, respectively. The percentages of HLA-A allele-lacking monocytes derived from cryopreserved mononuclear cells were similar to those of HLA-A allele lacking granulocytes in each patient. Of the 23 patients with HLA-A allele lacking leukocytes, 9 and 14 were treated with antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine or cyclosporine alone. The response rates to each therapy were 88.9% and 78.6%, respectively. Conclusion: Flow cytometry using commercially available monoclonal antibodies specifi c to HLA-A alleles enabled the detection of as few as 3% of leukocytes lacking HLA-A alleles in 21.9% of patients with newly diagnosed AA. Rapid typing of HLA-A alleles followed by screening of granulocytes or cryopreserved monocytes for the presence of HLA-A allele-lacking cells may be useful for predicting a response to IST in patients with AA heterozygous for the HLA-A allele.",

F\u00fchrer (2) , C. Niemeyer (1) (1)University of Freiburg (Freiburg, DE) ; (2)Dr. von Haunersches Kinderspital, University of Munich (Munich, DE) Introduction: Previous reports show that 2-16% of patients with aplastic anemia (AA) following immunosuppressive therapy (IST) develop secondary myelodysplastic syndrome /acute myeloid leukemia (2nd MDS/AML). However, there is limited data on the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in these patients. We report here the outcome of HSCT in 19 German patients with 2nd MDS/AML following AA, who were registered to the SAA-94 and/or EWOG-MDS 96/06 studies. Patients and methods: The diagnosis of 2nd MDS/AML was made in 21 patients (03/1995-11/2009 ) at a median of 2.9 years (0.5-13.0 years) after the diagnosis of AA. Excluding 2 patients given intensive chemotherapy only, the remaining 19 transplanted patients were included in this analysis. The median age at diagnosis of 2nd MDS/AML (9 refractory cytopenia(RC), 5 RAEB, 2 RAEBt and 3 AML) was 13.1 (3.3-26.2) years. Eight patients had a normal karyotype, 10 patients -7 and 1 patient +19. HSCT was performed at a median of 5.3 (0.4-26) months after diagnosis of 2nd MDS/AML. Donor was a matched sibling donor in 2 patients, a mismatched family member in 2 patients and an unrelated donor in 15 patients. Stem cell source was BM in 7 patients and peripheral blood in 12 patients. The preparative regimen consisted of busulfan, cyclophosphamide and melphalan (BU/CY/MEL) in 13 patients and other combinations in 6 patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporin A and methotrexate in most patients. Results: All patients engrafted (med. 15 days). Grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD was observed in 9 and 7 patients, respectively. Eight of 13 evaluable patients developed chronic GVHD (3 limited, 5 extensive) . Overall survival at 6 years after HSCT was 50.1 % with no diff erence according to karyotype (-7 vs. others; 47% vs. 53 %), morphological subtype (RC vs. others; 44% vs. 54 %) or conditioning regimen (BU/CY/MEL vs. others 46% vs. 63%). Cause of death was relapse of MDS in one patient and transplant related mortality (TRM) in 9 patients. Conclusion: The outcome of HSCT in patients with 2nd MDS/AML following AA was unfavorable. The major problem was a high rate of TRM. Based on the high TRM and the occurrence of 2nd MDS/ AML it can be speculated that some of these patients have an underlying congenital bone marrow failure. The outcome may be possibly improved by earlier indication of HSCT and by a reduced toxicity regimen.",

Holbro (1) Objective: The prognostic signifi cance of cytogenetic abnormalities in aplastic anemia (AA) are controversial. Del(13q) has been reported to occur in patients with MDS and other hematologic malignancies. Additionally, cases of patients with bone marrow failure syndrome with del(13q), who showed good response to immunosuppressive therapy have been reported. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed outcome of patients diagnosed as AA with del(13q) at our institution. Results: For 86/353 (24%) patients cytogenetic analysis at any time during the disease course was available. We identifi ed six patients (7%) with del(13q). Table 1 shows patients characteristics. Median age at diagnosis was 50.5 years (range: 22-71 years), half were male. One patient was diagnosed with very severe AA, three patients with severe AA and two with AA. Del(13q) was detected at diagnosis in four patients. One patient (UPN 936) had a normal karyotype at diagnosis and developed del(13q) after a fi rst course of antithymocyte globuline (ATG), and cyclosporine A (CYA). Two years later this patient relapsed and received a second course of ATG and CYA with disappearance of the del(13q) clone. She reached a partial response (PR) and remains under immunosuppression with CYA, free of transfusions 86 months after last ATG. One patient diagnosed in 1987 with SAA (UPN 410) was treated with ATG in 1990, cytogenetics at diagnosis were not available. She reached a complete response with persisting macrocytic anemia. Del(13q) was documented 10 years after ATG. She remained hematologically stable for 276 months until her death in a car accident. In two patients, del(13q) was no longer detectable at last follow-up. All patients except one are still alive after a median follow-up of 105 months (range: 84-276 months). None of the patients showed progression to acute myeloid leukemia or MDS. Conclusion: Patients with bone marrow failure without dysplasia and isolated del(13q) should be classifi ed as AA and treated accordingly as they represent a subgroup of patients with favorable outcome.",

One hundred patients, diagnosed as having aplastic anemia and underwent alloHSCT were identifi ed in 5 Polish Pediatric HSCT centers, between 2005 and 2011. There were 74 children with severe aplastic anemia, 17 with Fanconi anemia and 9 with Blackfan-Diamond anemia. Median age of the patients at diagnosis was 9, 5 years and median age at HSCT was 11 years. Donors were siblings in 32 cases whereas 65 children were transplanted from match unrelated donor and 3 from mismatched donors. Source of stem cells were bone marrow stem cells in 49 patients, peripheral blood stem cells in 47, cord blood in 2 and in 2 children combined stem cell sources were used. The most common conditioning regiments were : fl udarabin, cyclophosphamide and ATG (29 pts) and cyclophosphamide and ATG (23 pts). GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA and MTX in majority of patients (80%). Median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 10 months. To the fi nal analysis we included 74 patients who survived at least 3 months after HSCT and having at least 3 assessment of chimerism within fi rst 2 years post transplantation. Qualitative chimerism was evaluated in all centers in peripheral blood, using variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) PCR method. We considered as full donor chimerism patients with less than 1% of recipient cells (DC) and as mixed chimera (MC) those having more than 1% of recipient cells in two consecutive evaluation. Median follow-up was 3 years. Overall survival of whole group was 0,8. Twenty eight of seventy four evaluable patient were found to be MC, forty fi ve DC and one autologous recovery was noted. Survival of patients with MC was signifi cantly better than those with DC -0,96 vs 0,79 respectively (p=0,04). No statistically significant diff erence in survival was found between children with DC and MC in respect to diagnosis, donor type or stem cell source. Only one patient with MC died from infection whereas 9 patients with DC died of complication: 5 GvHD, 2 toxicities, 1 infection and 1 PTLD. None patient with MC lost their graft and experienced aplasia relapse. We concluded that in our material mixed chimerism in children with the aplastic anemia may improve survival probably due to less severe transplant related complications. However follow up of the study population is short and data requires further confirmation.",

Pession Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna (Bologna, IT) Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donor (UD-HSCT) has become a frequent therapeutic alternative in children diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), due to the low rate response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) along with the frequent absence of a matched sibling donor (MSD). In UD-HSCT setting, treatment-related mortality, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection have been major cause of treatment failure. We report the long-term outcome of 10 children with SAA undergone to UD-HSCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen based on Fludarabine (FLU), Cyclophosphamide (CY) and ATG. Methods: Between 1997 and 2010, 10 pts (4 M), median age 10 (range 5-18) ys, underwent HSCT from UD for SAA after failure to repsond to IST. RIC regimen consisted of FLU 30 mg/sqm/day X 4, CY 300 mg/mq/day X 4, ATG 3.75 mg/kg X 3 in 9/10 cases. Low dose Total Body Irradiation (200 cGy) was added in 2 pts>14 ys. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/die iv on day -1, 3 mg/kg/die iv from day 0, 6-10 mg/kg/die orally for at least 6 months) and short term Methotrexate. Monitoring of chimerism (complete, CC or mixed, MC), was performed on BM samples by using short tandem repeat (STR)-PCR analysis starting from the day of neutrophils (PMN) engraftment and then every 3 months. Results: The median interval from diagnosis to HSCT was 24 months (range 7-46). HSCs source was bone marrow (BM) in 8 pts and peripheral blood in 2. 6/10 donors were full matched, 4/10 were mis-matched in 1 or more loci. The median number of infused BM nucleated cells was 5.7x10 8 /kg and 7x10 6 /kg CD34+ PBSC. PMN and platelets engrafment was reached in all pts after a median time of 14 and 23 days, respectively. One pt experienced secondary graft failure with autologous reconstruction. aGVHD occurred in 2 pts (20%, 1 grade II and 1 grade IV); 4 pts (40%) developed limited chronic GVHD. After a mean follow up of 7.9 ys (range 2-15.9), 9/10 pts are alive and disease free: amongst them 8/9 showed CC. The patient with secondary graft failure is alive and transfusion independent: BM samples show MC with autologous prevalence. One patient died because of grade IV aGVHD. Conclusion: UD-HSCT is an eff ective and low toxic treatment for children with SAA: the long term outcomes following UD-HSCT are similar to those obtained in MSD setting. Careful selection of HLA matched UD, RIC regimen and chimerism monitoring by STR analysis have improved the outcome of UD-HSCT.",

Kojima Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine (Nagoya, JP) Background: For children who urgently need stem cell transplantation (SCT), a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haploidentical family donor could be considered as one of alternative donor sources because it's 1) easy to fi nd the donor in parents, 2) fast to engraft and 3) possible to use donor cell derived cell therapies such as virus specifi c cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We analyzed children with aplastic anemia (AA) who underwent HLA haploidentical SCT for an urgent need of SCT. Materials and Methods: Four children with AA underwent unmanipulated HLA haploidentical SCT in urgent need of SCT in our center. Bone marrow taransplantation (BMT) was conducted on day0 and G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were infused on day6 to boost numbers of stem cells. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and short term MTX while antithymocyte globulin (ATG) were given at 10mg/kg prior to BMT and at 5mg/kg one day before PBSCT. Patients received a conditioning treatment consisting of fl udarabine 30 mg/m2 i.v. x 4 days, melphalan 70 mg/m2 i.v. x 2 day and total body irradiation 5Gy in two fractions. Results: The reasons of urgent SCT were very severe aplastic anemia with a neutrophil count of zero cells/mm3 with infections in two patients and graft failure after fi rst SCT in other two patients. The ages of the patients were 5, 10, 15 and 15 years old. Donors were two fathers, one mother and one brother. HLA disparity between patients and donors were all 2/6 HLA (HLA-A, B and DRB1) mismatched at antigen level. All patients engrafted and the duration of neutropenia (ANC <500) was 15, 21, 25 and 29 days respectively. Two patients developed acute GVHD grade II and III. One received infl iximab for steroid refractory GVHD. One patient developed extensive chronic GVHD. CMV reactivations were observed in all four patients and ganciclovir and/or foscavir were given. EBV reactivations were observed in one patients and the patient were treated by rituximab. The follow-up time was 6, 41, 76 and 103 months. All patients are alive. Discussion: Unmanipulated haploidentical SCT was useful option for children with aplastic anemia who don't have HLA matched related donor and need urgent SCT.",

Naumova (2) Objective: To detect the presence of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone in de novo aplastic anemia (AA) patients, during the immunosuppressive therapy (IST) (1 to 24 months), in remission and in relapsed AA. Methods: 62 AA patients have been included into the study. Median age -24 years (from 16 till 64 years). All 62 patients were divided into 4 groups. The 1st one included de novo AA patients (n=23); the 2nd group included AA patients, who had undergone the IST(n=14); 3d group -in remission (n=16); and 4th group-relapsed AA patients (n=9). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies CD45, CD15, CD64, CD235a, GPI-antibodies CD59, CD14, CD24 and FLAER. Results: The PNH clone was found in 38 patients (61%), in whom minor clone was found in 8 patients and in 30 patients the clone size does not exceed 1%. In the 1st group PNH clone was detect in 12 of 23 (52%), 4 of them were positive for a minor clone. Median (Me) clone size on the Red Blood Cells (RBC) was 0,9% (0,1-1,5%), Background: Although most of HL patients are cured with fi rst line conventional chemotherapy/radiotherapy or autologous transplantation (HDC) continue to relapse and can be treated by ALLO after nonmyeloablative/reduced intensity conditioning regimens (NMA/RIC). For these advanced patients, however, the relapse rate is still high after ALLO. The aim of this study was to describe the outcome of HL patients relapsing after ALLO in a single institution. Patients and methods: Since 1999, 55 HL patients were treated by ALLO in our institution. All patients received NMA/RIC regimens. Inclusion criteria were relapse after HDC, refractoriness to salvage chemotherapy in a program with HDC followed by ALLO. Diff erent NMA/RIC has been used (table 1). Treatment choice after relapse was made by treating physician mainly based on previous therapies and relapse characteristics (limited vs extensive) Results: Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . 21 (31%) out of 53 patients relapsed or progressed after ALLO. All but one patient were treated, because of poor performance status. Main patient characteristics and therapies were reported in Table 2 . The median time to relapse was 4 months (range 1-13). The response rate was high after each CT lines because was 44% after fi rst line, 30% after the second, and 40% after the third. DLI \u00b1 radiotherapy seemed to be the more eff ective therapy, probably linked to the fact that patients treated by RT had a less extensive relapse. The 1y OS, PFS, and relapse incidence were 65%, 27%, and 73%, respectively. The median PFS was 5 months and the median OS was 13 months. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed that survival for patients relapsing or progressing after ALLO is quite high, as patients continued to respond to therapy. However, treatment have to be prolonged because frequent relapses. In this cohort of patients, we did not used brentuximab vedotin. S. Takeuchi, N. Nakano, A. Kubota, M. Tokunaga, Y. Takatsuka, K. Yonekura, A. Utsunomiya Imamura Bun-in Hospital (Kagoshima, JP) Background: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a highly aggressive hematological malignancy and so allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is increasingly used as a curative option. However, 3-year overall survival rate is low with approximately 30% and incidence of non-relapse mortality is so high. Therefore, it is necessary to consider its indication. Here we clarify the relation between pre-transplant prognostic indexes and overall survival (OS) after allo-HSCT in our single institute located in endemic area of ATLL.",

The median time from the most recent solid organ transplant to the diagnosis of lymphoma was 10 years (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . The histology included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in four patients and plasmablastic lymphoma in one patient. The tumour was EBV-positive in three patients and two patients had EB-viremia at the time of diagnosis. All patients received a combination chemotherapy and rituximab. One patient was included into high-dose therapy protocol at the time of the fi rst relapse and four other patients due to initial poor prognostic features/poor response to therapy; one of these patients showed a clear progression prior to high-dose therapy. Blood stem cells were mobilized with chemotherapy plus G-CSF. Three out of fi ve patients needed plerixafor to augment mobilization. With median of two aphereses a median of 2.7 CD34+ cells/kg (1.8-4.1) were collected. Four patients received BEAM followed by stem cell graft infusion plus pegfi lgrastim. One patient died due to septic shock and multiorgan failure on d +13, another patient shortly after stem cell collection due to rapidly progressive disease. Three patients are alive and well 1, 2 and 26 months from ASCT. Conclusions: Lymphomas appearing late after solid organ transplantation appear to behave aggressively and are diffi cult to treat. Perhaps based on chronic immunosuppression these patients have more problems with standard-dose chemotherapy and may perhaps also have more problems with high-dose therapy. Many of these patients appear to be poor stem cell mobilizers. More experience is clearly needed to optimize treatment of these patients. (1) It is now clearly established that cure or control of the underlying malignancy is not necessarily accompanied by full restoration of quality of life (QoL) in long-term survivors. Thus, information about QoL in long-term lymphoma survivors is worthwhile. We aimed to examine QoL in lymphoma patients in complete remission after AHSCT at long-term follow-up and provide comparison with population norms. A total of 34 lymphoma patients (Stage IIA-IVB) with the follow-up period more than 12 months were enrolled in the study: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma -18; Hodgkin's lymphoma -16. Mean age -37 years old, SD-11.2; male/female -17/17. All the patients were in complete remission after AHSCT. Median follow-up was 19.5 months (range 15-54 months). QoL was assessed using generic questionnaire SF-36. To compare patient population with normative data the sample from population norm (PN) data base adjusted to age and gender (n=72) was used. Distribution of patients according to the grades of QoL impairment was analyzed: no QoL impairment (Integral QoL index similar to the one in normative population sample), mild (25% decrease from a PN), moderate (25-50% decrease), severe (50-75% decrease) and critical (>75% decrease). For comparisons t-test for independent samples or Mann-Whitney test was used. QoL parameters in lymphoma patients in complete remission were similar to the ones in population norms for the majority of scales: role-physical functioning -72.1 vs 78.5, bodily pain -87.8 vs 79.7, general health -65.1 vs 65.4, vitality -66.6 vs 68.3, social functioning -85.7 vs 77.8, role-emotional functioning -72.5 vs 74.1 and mental health -71.4 vs 65.8. Physical functioning scale was significantly lower in patients as compared to PN: 81.5 vs 92.2 (P<0,05). The majority of patients had no QoL impairment (24 patients); 1 patient -mild QoL impairment, 4 -moderate QoL impairment; 4 -severe QoL impairment; and 1 -critical QoL impairment.",

Bramanti (1) Background: HDC is the gold standard in HL relapsing/refractory after fi rst line chemotherapy (CT). Pre-HDC FDG-PET can predict the outcome. Few data have been reported about the value of an interim FDG-PET during salvage CT. In a previous small cohort of patients, we suggested that PET2 was predictive of outcome, independently from PET4. In the present analysis, we aimed to confi rm these results in a more consistent number of patients. Patients and Methods: From March 2003 to July 2011, 67 pts with relapsed/refractory HL received 4 courses of IGEV (ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine) and HDC. FDG-PET was performed at relapse/progression, after the 2nd (PET2) and 4th (PET4) salvage CT. The progression free survival (PFS) and Overall survival (OS) were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: Median age was 33 years. 31 pts (49%) were refractory after fi rst line treatment and 32 (51%) were relapsed. Pts characteristics were reported in table 1. The overall response rate after IGEV was 74% (n= 47). With a median follow up of 46 months, for the whole population the 3-years (3-ys) PFS and OS were 70% and 79% (fi g 1). 3-ys PFS was 52% and 84% for pts with positive (pos) and negative (neg) PET2 respectively (p=0.008). 3-ys OS was 60% and 94% for pts with pos and neg PET2 (p=0.002). Considering only 47 chemosensitive pts after IGEV, the 3-ys PFS was 86% and 50% for patients CR and PR-PET2 (p= 0.005). 3-ys OS was 96% and 70% for CR and PR-PET2 (p= 0.011). In multivariate analysis, PET2 and PET4 signifi cantly infl uenced the PFS (p= 0.01). Conclusions: This retrospective multicenter study confi rms that interim PET after 2 courses of salvage chemotherapy can predict the outcome after HDC in HL pts. Moreover in the setting of chemosensitive pts PR identifi ed a group of patients with a poorer prognosis compared to CR. and presence or absence of B symptoms(66% vs 38%), HR=8.1(2.24 29.0), p-value=0.001). CI of DS-death for 0, vs 1-2 factors was 36% vs 65% (P=0.04). Table shows the confi dence interval with upper and lower limits (UL) (LL) and p-value. Conclusion: In patients with primary refractory DLBCL, presence of B symptoms and no prior use of rituximab are negative prognostic factors. Patients with higher scores have higher risk of treatment failure and are potential candidate for newer therapies.",

Panfi lio, A. Piciocchi, C. Stefanizzi, S.M. Trisolini, R. Fo\u00e0, G. Meloni Sapienza University (Rome, IT) Clinical management of advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD) currently involves the use of high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). PET/CT imaging is becoming the standard tool to assess treatment response before ASCT and recent data suggest a high negative predictive value of this procedure. Aim of the study was to analyze retrospectively the value of pre-ASCT PET/TC in poor risk HD patients consecutively autografted at our Institution since 2002, focusing in particular on the prognostic signifi cance of the presence of measurable disease pre-ASCT in PET negative patients. A cohort of 83 patients with a median age of 29 years (12-61) was analyzed. The M/F ratio was 45/38. Poor risk disease was defi ned as sensitive relapse (23 pts), response to 2nd line treatment (28 pts), more advanced disease (>2 lines of treatment, refractory relapse) (32 pts). The median number of chemotherapy lines received was 3 (2) (3) (4) . Bulky disease at diagnosis was present in 53% (44/83) of patients, while extranodal disease at baseline or at relapse was detected in 33% (28/83). In 36 cases, pre-tranplant PET/TC was positive and in 47 it was negative. Within the latter group, 19/47 patients had measurable disease (\u22654cm). The conditioning regimen varied during the years: BEAM was the treatment of choice until 2011 (74 pts); thereafter, Carmustine was replaced by Bendamustine 400 mg/m2 (3 pts) and Fotemustine 300 mg/m2 (6 pts). The two-year projected Kaplan-Meyer estimate of overall survival (OS) of the whole population was 87% (95% CI: 78-97), and pre-ASCT PET evaluation had no infl uence on OS (p: 0.2). The two-year projected progression-free-survival (PFS) was 73% overall (95% CI:63-83). Pre-ASCT PET negativity was the only factor infl uencing PFS both in univariate (85% vs 58%; p: 0.002) and multivariate analysis including in the model disease status, lines of treatment, bulky disease and extranodal involvement as covariates. Within PET negative patients, the presence of residual measurable disease was not associated with a worse outcome (p: 0.71). In our series, pre-transplant negative 18FDG-PET identifi ed patients with a better outcome and was a useful prognostic factor, independently of disease status before ASCT. Patients undergoing transplant with a persistent PET positivity still have a worse prognosis and for them alternative therapeutic strategies combined with ASCT should be considered.",

Dreger University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, DE) The role of autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) as consolidating treatment for peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) is unsettled. The aim of this retrospective single center analysis was to investigate the feasibility and effi cacy of autoSCT in the upfront setting by intent-to-treat, and to study salvage strategies in case of relapse. Eligibility criteria: all patients with PTCL aged 18-70 years, diagnosed from 2002 through 2011. Results: 106 patients could be identifi ed. 7 were not treated, 1 was lost to follow up, 4 died within the fi rst month and 17 patients had ALK+ PTCL. These groups were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 77 patients, diagnosis was ALCL ALK-in 21, AITL in 16, EATCL in 10, and other PTCL in 30. Disregarding 15 patients whose initial treatment was performed externally, 1st-line autoSCT was not intended in 19 patients due to comorbidity, refusal, or unknown reasons (non-ITT), while intent-totransplant (ITT) was documented in 43 patients. Of these, 22 were autografted, whereas 19 (44%) could not proceeded to autoSCT usually due to progression, toxicity or refusal. By multivariate analysis adjusting for age, IPI and PTCL subtype, ITT vs non-ITT was not associated with signifi cant benefi ts for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Altogether, 58 (75%) of all 77 patients relapsed. Median OS after PTCL recurrence was only 10 months with no signifi cant impact of the time interval from 1st-line therapy to relapse, but higher IPI and age as well as subtype EATCL had a negative infl uence on the OS after relapse. increased uptake (SUV<3.5). A homogenous pattern with normal FDG distribution and absence of focally increased uptake was also considered as negative. Active disease was considered when the defi nition of controlled disease was not fulfi lled. Results: Eighteen patients (55%) had controlled disease before transplantation. With a median follow up of 9 months (IQL 5-34), the median OS of patients with active disease is 7.5 months (IC 95% 4.7-10.3) and it has not been reached in patients with controlled disease (p<0.001). At 2 years OS is 23% and 78% respectively (p<0.001). Nine patients did not respond and 5 patients relapsed after transplantation. In patients with previous active disease, the probability of relapse at two years is 100%, while it is lower than 20% in patients with controlled disease. PFS at 2 years is 15% and 78% respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: In our experience, disease status evaluated by PET before reduced intensity allogeneic SCT is strongly predictive of outcome in patients with lymphoma. Patients with active disease have long-term dismal results and should follow a diff erent strategy.",

In these cases it seems reasonable to apply consolidating high-dose sequential chemotherapy(sHDT) with autologous stem cells transplantation (ASCT). Aim: To evaluate the effi cacy of the mNHL-BFM-90 program with sHDT with ASCT in the treatment of patients with DLBCL BM. Patients and Methods: Since Feb 2005 14 untreated DLBCL BM pts (median age 43(23-57), the M/F ratio 3,67; IPI: IH 50%, H 50%; bone marrow involvement: CBM 36%, DBM 64%) were enrolled in the mNHL-BFM-90 with sHDT with ASCT treatment program. All pts underwent 4 courses of CT mNHL-BFM-90 blocks A and C. After 4 courses the pts continued receiving treatment according to the sHDT scheme, including 2 DHAP courses and 3 high-dose courses with the mobilization and collection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC): cyclophosphamide 8 g day 1, methotrexate 16 g and vincristine 2 mg day 15, etoposide 1 g q 12 hrs days 21-24. With enough CD 34+ cells collected the BEAM conditioning and the ASCT were carried out. Out of 14 pts included in the study, full therapy scheme was implemented in 6(43%) pts (arm 1). There had not been enough HSC collected from the remaining 8(57%) pts and therefore the ASCT was not carried out (arm 2). In arm 2, in case the complete remission (CR) was achieved only after sHDT, one additional Dexa-BEAM course was carried out (4 pts). The other 2 arm pts completed the therapy after the sHDT (4 pts). Results: A median follow-up is 44 months (19-95). All 14 pts achieved CR. There were 2(14%) pts with the early recurrence: 1 with CBM and 1 with DBM. One case of recurrence was registered in each arm. CR is maintained in 4 out of 5 patients with CBM. The 5-year OS and RFS were 79% and 85%, respectively. Conclusions: For the fi rst time the application of the primaryintensive mNHL-BFM-90 program with the sHDT with ASCT in the treatment of DLBCL BM pts, including pts with CBM, demonstrated high effi cacy.",

Zappasodi (1) We have now set out to clarify whether and how HSP105 can contribute to the malignant phenotype in these diseases.

However the factors aff ecting the outcome of patients treated by ECP is still under investigation. We report our experience of the patients who were treated with ECP at the Rotherham Hospital Foundation Trust from 1996-2012. Methods: Single centre, retrospective cohort study based on the data in the unit's ECP database. 219 consecutive patients were included who were steroid dependent, steroid refractory or intolerant to them. We recorded the baseline features including gender, age, type of transplant, sex of the donor, performance status, steroid dose, bilirubin level, platelet count, ECP duration, number of immunosuppressive agents, type of cGVHD and overall severity of GVHD (NIH classifi cation).The individual organ scores were also recorded. The response was measured at 3months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Patients who showed \u2265 50% improvement in organ score and/or \u2265 50% reduction in steroid dose were classifi ed as responders. All the others were in the non responder group. Results: There was superior overall survival for the patients in the responder group as compared to the non responders (Table 1 ). In Univariate Cox regression analysis, signifi cant factors of survival included platelet count \u2264100 (HR 2.671, CI 1.653-4.315, p<0.001), bilirubin level \u22642mg/dl (HR 0.345, p<0 .001), steroid dose at the start of ECP \u22640.5 mg/kg (HR 0.464, CI 0.289-0.745, p<0.001) and the duration of ECP with an increase in survival with the increased duration (HR 0.979, CI 0.973-0.985, p<0.001).Other factors including female gender, male donors, good performance status, less immunosuppressive agents, less severe GVHD score were predictive of better survival, but did not reach statistical signifi cance. There was improvement in the response rates with the duration of ECP. The response rates improved from 78% at 3 months to 90.2% at 2 years. (Fig 1) . Conclusion: This study suggests that there are no obvious predictors of response to ECP, but prolonged ECP appears to be",

Castagna (2) , C Perotti (1) (1)Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.Matteo (Pavia, IT); (2)Istituti Clinici Humanitas (Rozzano, Milan, IT) Objectives: Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is often used after allo-SCT for treating diff erent oncohaematologic diseases to exploit the graft-versus-tumor eff ect in pts receiving T-celldepleted grafts, early after relapse or as a prophylactic strategy of relapse. However, more than 1/3 of patients develop acute and/or chronic GvHD and need an increase of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) thus entailing higher risk of disease relapse. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) is a cell therapy, used to treat GVHD after allo-SCT. We here detail the results of 11 pts with chronic GvHD (NIH classifi cation) after DLI, treated with ECP with the aim of reducing or avoiding the need for IST. Methods: ECP consists in mononuclear cell collection, their UV-A irradiation in presence of 8-methoxypsoralen and reinfusion of the cells to the pts. The ECP treatment schedule consisted of three rounds of two procedures per week, three rounds of two procedures every other week, and fi nally two procedures every month until clinical improvement and/or IST tapering. Description of the whole cohort has been recently published (Transfusion 2012; 529:2007-15) . Results: Out of 102 patients treated with ECP at our Centre for chronic GvHD, 11 (10.8%) had received DLI. Of these, 7 (63.6%) were males. ECP was second line treatment for 3 (27.3%) pts and third line for 8 (72.7%) pts. Table 1 details pts' characteristics at ECP initiation. 8 (72.7%) pts showed a satisfactory response to ECP: 3 (27.3%) were complete responders, 5 (45.4%) partial responders; 2 (18.2%) minimal responders and 1 (9.1%) no responder. Rate of response was 2.6 (95%CI 1. 2 -5.6, p-value=0.02 ) higher than the rest of our cohort. 3 pts (27.3%) died (1 for disease relapse and 2 for infection). Of the 7 pts with steroid at baseline, 5(71.4%) discontinued steroid at the last ECP; other IST was tapered in 6 (54.5%) pts ( Table 2) . Conclusion: ECP proved to be eff ective in treating patients with GVHD after DLI. Compared to the whole cohort, these patients had a higher chance of complete or partial response; most patient could taper or even suspend IST even if ECP represented third line treatment for most patients. If these results will be confi rmed, ECP could be proposed as fi rst line treatment to reduce cGVHD severity in patients receiving DLI.",

Benz (1) Background: Chronic Graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) involving the skin, joints or fascia may lead to restriction in movement, pain and hence disability. Physiotherapy is often prescribed, albeit prospective evaluation of physiotherapy programs for these patients is largely lacking. Methods: All consecutive patients diagnosed with cGvHD manifestations involving the joints and fascia and/or the skin with deep sclerotic features or impaired mobility (skin organ Score 3) were asked to participate in the Basel prospective physiotherapy cohort study. Initial assessment was performed in a standardized way by an experienced trained rheumatologist and a physiotherapist. The assessment included GvHD skin score, muscle strength, range of motion and self-reported health assessment measured by S-HAQ, a validated instrument in scleroderma patients. Aspects of quality of life were measured by SF-36. Patients were planned to receive a 12 months course of 2 intense sessions every week of physiotherapy and ergotherapy if deemed to be necessary. The following techniques were applied and modifi ed according to patients needs: Isotonic muscle exercise, stretching, deep facial massage and ergotherapeutic techniques if hands or face were involved. For those patients not able to come twice a week to Basel local physiotherapists were instructed by a written letter. All patients will be/were reassessed at 6 and 12 months. Results: So far 11 patients (6 female) were included. Diagnoses were AML in 5, CML in 3, ALL, HD and PCM in 1 each. Median time interval between HSCT and inclusion was 5.8 years (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , global scoring of cGvHD was severe in 9 patients and moderate and mild in 1 each. All but 1 patient had systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Median age at inclusion was 52 years (32-68), six months assessment has been completed for 6 patients. Preliminary",

Most of relapsed APL patients will achieve a second complete response (CR2) with arsenic trioxide (ATO), but the optimal consolidation strategy for these patients (repeated courses of ATO, autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation -HSCT-) remains uncertain. The outcome of HSCT for APL in EBMT centers was addressed in previous studies (Mandelli F, 1994; Sanz MA, 2007), but more recent information, in the era of generalized use of ATO as salvage therapy, is lacking. In this context, we analyzed the outcome of patients with a cytogenetic and/or molecularly confi rmed APL who received HSCT (autoHSCT n=57, alloHSCT=32) for relapsed APL during the period 2004-2009. Median age was were treated with G-CSF after autoHSCT starting no later than on day +7 while remaining 1121 ones did not receive cytokines to support neutrophil recovery. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) was used as a source of stem cells in 454 (22%) and 1693 (78%) cases, respectively. Conditioning regimen was based on TBI in 402 (19%) patients. Detailed patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. With the median follow-up of 8 years the probability of LFS at 5 years in the BM-autoHSCT group was 51% (\u00b13%) for patients receiving post-transplant G-CSF and 48% (\u00b13%) for those not treated with G-CSF, p=0.73",

Study design: Twenty-fi ve adult patients with ALL (median age at alloSCT: 38 years, range 19-54; 10 Ph+ALL) were eligible for treatment with myeloablative TCD-alloSCT in CR1",

Discussion: The use of Flu-Mel-rATG RIC in unrelated donor allo-HSCT in patients with SAA allowed 100% engraftment, absence of graft rejection and relapse, and an OS of 76.9% at 2 years.

Considering TARC values done on the day of PET scans, the ROC curve showed that the cut off value of 1500 pg/mL had a sensitivity and specifi city of 86% and 91%, respectively. Conclusions: Serum TARC level correlated with HL tumor burden as detected by PET scan. Patients with disease after alloSCT had elevated TARC levels compared to those in CR.

Many centers use an \"off -line\" ECP technique and different apheresis devices for mononuclear cell (MNC) collection. The optimal collection step should produce highly MNC-enriched product with minimal hematocrit (Hct) to avoid negative eff ects on UV-A absorption. GVHD patients are known to have low cell counts, thus making apheresis procedure challenging. Therefore it is important to evaluate quality of collection with diff erent devices. Methods: ECP was performed using an \"off -line\" regimen (Cobe Spectra (CS) or Spectra Optia MNC Version 5 (SO) (TerumoBCT, USA) for MNC collection + Puva Combi Light). Data of apheresis records (pre-apheresis counts, processing parameters and apheresis product counts) were analysed to compare collection efficiency of both devices.

T-reg numbers were further elevated at 12 m. The median % of CD4+ cells in healthy controls (49.8%) was approximately twice that of cGVHD patients pre-ECP (22.8%), and at all time points post-ECP (maximum of 25.5% at 3 m). Increases in absolute numbers of each T-reg phenotype correlated with a greater likelihood of achieving a response in skin disease, but not with steroid tapering. Conclusion: T-regs increased in the majority of patients after 3 m of ECP, with the greatest median %increase in number of cells occurring at 12 m post-ECP. Greater % increases in T-regs (especially CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells) from pre-ECP numbers are associated with a better response in skin disease",

Xiao, Y. Luo, X. Lai, J. Shi, Y. Tan, J. He, W. Xie, W. Zheng, X. Ye, X. Yu, Z. Cai, M. Lin, H. Huang Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, CN)Objectives: Relapse remains the most challenging obstacle in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). There is an intense ongoing investigation of biologic factors of hematologic malignancies responsible for the risk of relapse post-HSCT. However few studies focus on inter-patient variability in graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction. To explore key informative predicators from donor and patient genetic basis, we investigated the infl uence of genetic variations in GVL response pathways on the risk of relapse post-HSCT. Methods: We analyzed 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 genes involved in GVL reaction including NK cell activating receptor gene (NKG2D), cytokine genes (TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2 and their receptors, IL6, IL10), T-cell co-stimulatory molecule genes (CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4), T-cell eff ector pathway genes (Granzyme B, Fas and Fas Ligand), innate immunity genes (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR8, TLR9) and immunosuppressive drug pharmacorelated genes (MTHFR, IMPDH1).

Methods: This is a multi-center Phase I/II trial of a novel conditioning regiment consisting of CLO (maximal dose of 52mg/m 2 /d achieved without dose limiting toxicity) x5d, sequential cytarabine 1000 mg/m 2 x6d 4 hours post CLO, and TBI (1200cGy) followed by AlloSCT from matched related or unrelated donors in CAYA with ALL or AML in CR3, RR or IF. Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and MMF as we have previously described.(Bhatia/Cairo et al., BBMT, 2010)  Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the probabilities of engraftment, GVHD, TRM, and overall survival (OS",

Aim: To evaluate and compare results of MSD-and MUD-HSCT in children with HR-AML in CR1 prospectively qualifi ed and uniformly treated according to the same fi rst line chemotherapy protocol and qualifi ed for allo-HSCT according the same criteria. Methods: We analyzed 45 children with HR-AML in CR1 stratifi ed and treated according to AML-BFM Interim 2004 Protocol between 2005-2011. Median age was 12 (1-18) years. The donor type was matched sibling (MSD) in 75.5% (34/45) and matched unrelated (MUD) in 28.8% (13/45). The source of cells was bone marrow in 84.4% (38/45) and peripheral blood in15.5% (7/45). Before MSD-HSCT conditioning regimen was based on busulfan in 30 children and on treosulfan in 2 while before MUD-HSCT on busulfan in 11 and on treosulfan in 2. Cyclosporine A was used in all patients as a graft versus host (GvHD) prophylaxis . In MSD group, 8 patients received \"short\" methotrexate.

Vaccination data could not be retrieved in 45.1% (23/51) of patients. The reason was death of the patients before start of vaccination in 69.6% (16/23), relapse of disease in 17.4% (4/23), follow-up in another hospital in 8.7% (2/23) and in 4.3% (1/23), vaccination was refused by the parents. Conclusion: The results emphasize a close follow-up of pediatric post-transplant patients in our hospital. This is confi rmed by the high level of agreement between the hospital guideline and the vaccination of pediatric HSCT patients eligible for vaccination.

Paediatric patients (<18y) receiving matched sibling donor (MSD) or 9-10/10 allelically matched unrelated donor (UD) transplants for severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) were studied retrospectively to examine the impact of CD3-selected T-cell chimerism on long-term chimerism and clinical outcomes. Methods: 33 consecutive transplants from MSD (13, all bone marrow, BM) or UD (20, 18 BM, 2 PBSC) were performed during 2004 to 2012. With single exceptions MSD procedures utilised cyclophosphamide (CY) 200mg/kg total and MUD transplants CY (120-200mg/kg total) plus FLU (120mg/m2 total). Additionally MUD patients received Alemtuzumab (0.9 mg/kg total) and MSD recipients Alemtuzumab (7) or ATG (6, variable types/doses) for in vivo T-cell depletion (IVTCD). Full donor chimerism (FDC) was defi ned as > 95% WB chimerism. Results: Overall survival was 100% with a median follow-up of 926 days (151-2930); all patients are transfusion independent. 16/33 (48%) had WB FDC at all times post-transplant and 17/33 (52%) mixed chimerism. Of the mixed chimerae, 8 converted to FDC (median 465 days, 130-1102) and 9 patients remained mixed (median 84, 19-94%)",

Posaconazole has recently been approved for primary antifungal prophylaxis in patients with prolonged neutropenia after AML induction chemotherapy and patients with GvHD. The effi cacy of posaconazole in the setting of alloHCT remains unclear. We retrospectively reviewed our data with the aim of comparing the effi cacy and safety of posaconazole vs fl uconazole as primary antifungal prophylaxis in the early phase of alloHCT. Methodology: Medical records of alloHCT recipients between the period of January 2006 and November 2012 were reviewed and relevant data collected. Patients undergoing alloHCT were either given fl uconazole capsule 200mg once daily (prior to September 2010) or posaconazole oral suspension 200mg three times daily (after September 2010) beginning on the same day as hematopoietic cell infusion until engraftment, suspected drug-associated toxicity, or systemic fungal infection occurred. Therapeutic doses of systemic antifungal agents were started for proven, probable or possible breakthrough fungal infections as defi ned according to standardized EORTC/MSG criteria.",

Only patients who were evaluable for the fi rst 100 days were included in this analysis. 40 patients received MMF post transplant (MMF+), 40 patients received MTX (MTX +) post transplant. All of 19 patients undergoing stem cell transplantation from matched unrelated donors (MUD) received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). The Recipient/Donor CMV status was R -/D-4 (5%), R-/D+ 3 (3,75%), R+/D-2 (2,5%), R+/D+ 71 (88,75%).Results: Blood CMV-DNAemia was monitored by quantitative PCR. Positive CMV-DNAemia occurred in 57 patients. The patients that received MMF developed a higher incidence of CMV-DNAemia (34, 85%) compared to the patients that received MTX (23, 57,5%; P < 0.05). Moreover, only seven patients with persistent or recurrent CMV-DNAemia received MMF. All positive cases were treated with ganciclovir and the median duration of CMV infection was 6 days No patient in either group developed CMV disease or died of CMV-related complications.

Nine patients underwent allogeneic HSCT (3 HLA-matched unrelated donor, 1 HLA-mismatched unrelated donor, 3 unrelated cord blood, 1 HLA-haploidentical related donor, and 1 HLA-matched sibling), and 1 patient underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. HHV infection developed at a median of 16 days post-HSCT (range: 9-180 days). Patients manifested with fever (100%), rash (90%), hepatitis (80%), pneumonitis (60%), CNS manifestations (40%), and graft failure (10%). Nine patients had concomitant infections. Two patients received foscarnet and ganciclovir treatment. Six patients cleared HHV after a median of 23.5 days (range: 16-44 days). Four patients died, 3 due to relapse of malignancy and 1 due to severe acute graft-versus-host disease. Conclusion: Reactivation of HHV infection is not uncommon in post-HSCT children in Hong Kong, especially after allogeneic HSCT. The clinical manifestations are protean, with fever and rash being the commonest.

Jahani Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Objective: Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is a highly eff ective post remission treatment for patients with AML in fi rst complete remission. The role of postremission consolidation with chemotherapy then Allo-HSCT is a controversial issue (Thallman et al study, lisa Sproat et al and R.M. stone et al. This study was performed for evaluation of postremission chemotherapy effi cacy before Allo-HSCT. Method: We randomized 51new cases of Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML) that received Induction regimen (7days Cytarabine and 3 days Idarubicin) from April 2008 to October 2012. These patients have were equal for distribution of adverse risk factors. Of all patients 26 patients received only induction therapy and 25 patients received induction and post-remission chemotherapy (5 days Cytarabine and 2 days Idarubicin). Conditioning regimen for transplantation was busulfan and cyclophosphsmide. Graftversus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen was Methotraxate and cyclosporin. Results: There was no signifi cant diff erence in Acute GVHD in two groups. (p=0.382) we have 21 GVHD in Group (7+3) and 18 in group (7+3 & 5+2).Of all patients 6 relapse happen in 15 month fallow up. one relapse was in 7+3 group and 5 relapse were in (7+3 & 5+2), but there was no signifi cant diff erence statistically between 2 group (p=0.13).we have 8 death in group (7+3) and & 7 death in group ( 7+3 & 5+2)",

As disposal policies vary widely from each center and guidelines are lacking to this end, we conducted a survey from 7 representative GITMO centers, to investigate the fate of SCU harvested between January 2006 to December 2009 for ASCT. .9x10e6 CD34+/kg; only 19 patients(1.5%) were transplanted with <2x10e6 CD34+/kg. 356 patients underwent a 2nd ASCT and 35 a 3rd reinfusion; 80% of transplanted patients received> 5x10e6 CD34+/kg, while 80% of patients who never underwent ASCT had <5x10e6 CD34+/kg. 274 patients(22%) never underwent ASCT; the highest percentage of collections utilization was achieved in Multiple Myeloma (MM)(92%) and the lowest in Acute Leukemia (AL)(59%). We evaluated the fate of the unemployed SCU for a minimum follow-up(F-U) of 3 years: 518 patients(41%) reinfused all the SCU; in 470(37%) patients SCUs were partially used (55% on average) and in 274 patients 100% of the SCU remained unemployed.

The TcR\u03b1/\u03b2-depleted grafts contained a median of 5.8\u00d7106/kg CD34+, 0.045\u00d7105/kg TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+, and 8.6\u00d7106/kg TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells, and were transplanted with additional CD34+ selected cells as required. Conclusion: The ClinMACS system (D3.1 program, DTS) enables extensive depletion of TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells with excellent recovery of CD34+ and TcR\u03b3/\u03b4+ cells. Flow cytometric detection of residual TcR\u03b1/\u03b2+ cells is challenging and requires optimization of multiple analysis parameters.Background: Graft failure (GF) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a serious condition with high mortality.Whereas the initial treatment options are use of hematopoietic growth factors and infection prophylaxis, the ultimate treatment is a second transplant. A second transplant with CD34-selected cells from the original donor can be feasible if the patient has complete donor chimerism. Furthermore, the second graft can be administered without conditioning, since the recipient immune system is of donor origin. Methods: From 2002 to 2011, we identifi ed 18 patients at our institution with the following clinical features: 1) GF not caused by medications or infection, 2) full donor chimerism in bone mardays. A Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival after second transplant is depicted inFigure 1. The two-year estimated survival probability was 47.7% with a median observation time of 7.1 months. Death causes were infections and organ failure, no patients experienced relapse. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was observed in 7(39%) patients, but in modest grades; 5 grade I-II, 2 grade III and none grade IV. Chronic GVHD developed in 8 cases (44%), of these 7 were considered extensive and one limited. Conclusion: In GF patients, a second transplant with a CD34selected graft from the original donor can be safely administered without conditioning in case of full donor chimerism, with longtime survival as a possible outcome.Kurnikova, E.

Biosimilars such as Zarzio can be used in the setting of neutropenia and HSC mobilization, however, their clinical experience is limited. Methods: We performed autologous HSC transplant for advanced heart failure into myocardium in eligible patients on waiting list for the heart transplant. Biosimilar Zarzio was used for HSC according to standard protocol 10 \u03bcg/kg body weight daily for fi ve days. On day fi ve CD34+ cell level above 15x10 6 /l was considered adequate for the start of apheresis. Peripheral HSC collection was performed using Amicus cell separator. Results: Sixteen patients (men=13) with ischemic cardiomiopathy were mobilized with Zarzio. Their median age was 54.8 (36.4-68.2) years. Zarzio was administered for fi ve days. On day fi ve the median white blood cell count, CD34+ cell count and their percentage were 54.84 (36.40-68.22) x10 9 /l, 32.00 (16.94-189.76) x10 6 /l and 0.19% (0.07-0.38), respectively. None of the patients was a poor mobilizer not reaching 15x10 6 /l CD34+ cells level. No serious adverse event was observed. Conclusion: Use of biosimilar Zarzio in HSC mobilization is feasible with success rates similar to fi lgrastim as observed by others. There were no serious side eff ects and all patients proceeded to apheresis. Further studies using Zarzio and long term follow up are necessary.Background: Delayed engraftment or graft failure can induce delayed immune reconstitution, which increases the risk of infection and transplant related mortality (TRM), and decreases overall survival (OS) after allogenic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT). According to prior studies, the number of CD34+ cells is the most reliable measure for predicting the kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution. However, the impact of donor T-cells and clinical factors on engraftment kinetics in peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has not been wellinvestigated. The aim of our study is to investigate predictive factors for rapid engraftment after PBSCT in patients with acute leukemia. Methods: Two hundred and sixty-two patients receiving PBSCT between September 1998 and November 2011 were analyzed in this study. Subset analyses of donor stem cells were conducted by using a fl ow-cytometric method. The correlation between rapid engraftment of neutrophils, platelets, and donor stem cellsdoses [hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+ cells), T-cells (CD3+), helper T-cells (CD3+/CD4+), cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+/CD8+), NK cells (CD56+)] as well as other recipient and donor clinical factors were analyzed.Results: In univariate analysis, factors correlated with neutrophil engraftment (\u2265 0.5x109/L) by day 12 were: short duration from diagnosis to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), achievement of complete remission (CR) after fi rst induction chemotherapy (CR1) before HCT, and high numbers of mononuclear cells (MNCs), CD34+ cells, CD3+ T-cells, CD3+/CD4+ T-cells, and CD3+/CD8+ T-cells. Factors correlated with platelet engraftment (\u2265 20 x109/L) by day 14 were: female gender, achievement of CR1 before HCT, younger donor age (> 30 years), and high numbers of MNCs, CD34+ cells, CD3+ T-cells, CD3+/CD4+ T-cells, CD3+/CD8+ T-cells, and CD56+ NK cells. In multivariate analysis, independent predictive factors for rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment were CR1 before HCT, high number of donor CD34+ cells, and high number of CD3+ T-cells. Conclusion: In our study, we found that achieving CR1 before HCT, as well as larger quantities of donor CD34+ and CD3+ T-cells may predict rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment after PBSCT. However, further studies are needed to determine the appropriate doses of CD3+ T-cells and CD34+ cells necessary for rapid engraftment.P690Alemtuzumab in the stem cell bag provides favourable outcomes in patients receiving myeloablative unrelated donor allografts for myeloid malignancies P.Nicolson, S.

Reason for this is the better compatibility of conditioning regimes and an expansion of transplant-indications. Better supportive care allows a stem cell transplantation to older patients with haematological disease. Also the age of sibling donor rise. In our centre mobilisation of peripheral stem cells occurs with Filgastrim. Also donors can be not always collected enough stem cells Plerixafor (AMD 3100), a hematopoietic stem cell mobilizer is synergistic with G-CSF. At the moment Plerixafor is admitted for mobilisation of autologous stem cells by patients with multiple myeloma and Non Hodkgin lymphoma.

Methoden: We analysed the eff ect of the combination Plerixafor and fi lgastrim in matched related donor, witch inadequate mobilisation with fi lgastrim alone. Donor fi rst mobilized with fi lgastrim 5\u03bcg/kg alone. Donors, who were unable to collect more as 3 x 10 6 cells/kg on their fi rst mobilisation, received a combination with plerixafor and G-CSF. We analysed mobilisation results after this combination. Results: 2011 -2012 nine sibling donors (n=3 female, n=6 male) with a median age of 62 years (r: 43 -74) were poor mobilizer. First apheresis was on day 4 of stimulation with 5\u03bcg/kg filgastrim. The numbers of collected cells after apheresis 1 was in median 1,81x10 6 cells/kg (r: 0,4 -2,9x10 6 cells/kg. The donors received a combination with filgastrim and plerixafor (240 \u03bcg/ kg s.c.) on day 5 of stimulation 8 -12 h before second apheresis.

Preclinical studies suggest a strong cytotoxic eff ect of NK cells on myeloma cells. We investigated the toxicity and effi cacy of purifi ed donor derived NK-cells in eigth myeloma patients who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Results of therapy before NK-cell infusion; n=1 CR after bortezomib/dexa, n= vgPR after bortezomib mono, n=2 partial remission after bortezomib mono, n=2 stable disease after bortezomib and bortezomib/dex, n=1 progressive disease after bortezomib/dex/cyclophosphamid. NK-cells were separated from the original donor with an unstimulate apheresis. Results: After one apheresis. donors collected NK-cells with a median of 4,78 x 10 6 /kg cells (r:2,05-10,27x10 6 /kg). Side eff ects or complications during the infusion did not appear. No patient developed signs of a GvHD in time after NK-cell infusion. One pat. (n=1) don\u00b4t get a additional therapy. This patient is in progressive disease after NK cell infusion. The incidence of progress after NK-cell infusion was n= 2 (n=1 with concomitant therapy bortezomib/dex/cyclophophamid, n=1 with bortezomib/dex). We observed complete remission in three pts. (n=1 with bortezomib/ dex, n=2 with bortezomb mono), n=1 partial remission and n=1 stable disease (bortezomib mono).

Enoxaparin 40 mg/day during one year was mandatory in both arms. Results: There were 24 (8.9%) TE recorded, 12 in each arm; we pooled the 2 groups for the subsequent analysis. The characteristics of the MM with TE were not diff erent from the overall population, 14 male / 10 female, median age (range) was 63 (42-76) with 25% patients older than 65. The median (min-max) time from start of therapy to occurrence of TE was 3.4 months (0.3-11.9), not different in either arm. TE occurred in 16 (66%) vs. 8 (33%) patients in the fi rst 4 months and after 4 months, respectively. 15 (62.5%) pts had at least some tumor burden reduction (minor response and better) at time of occurrence of TE, while 12.5% had progression of MM, 12.5% stable disease, and 12.5% were non evaluable. All TE occurred while pts were on LMWH prophylaxis since the initiation of the study treatment but one. The occurrence of TE impacted the treatment of MM as 16 (67%) pts did stop their IMiDs-based treatment, either transiently for 8 (33%) or defi nitely for 8 (33%) pts. The doses of the IMiDs were reduced for 5 pts when IMiDs were reintroduced. Overall only 5 pts had no change applied to their MM treatment while TE occurred. Conclusion: Although LMWH is recommended to patients with high risk of TE, the optimal dose and duration of TE prophylaxis remains to be determined. More studies are needed to determine risk factors of TE in MM patients treated with IMiDs-based regimen.Introduction and background: Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) remains the principal component of treatment of de novo multiple myeloma (MM) in patients under 65 years of age. Mobilization of 6 x 106 CD34+/kg, targeted dose to perform double ASCT is accomplished only in 56% of the patients receiving G-CSF alone. Cyclophosphamide added to G-CSF increases stem cell yields but is associated to substantial toxicities. Etoposide added to G-CSF, may enhance stem cell yields with less toxicities. Objectives: The aim of the study is to determine the rate of MM patients collecting at least 6 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg after mobilization by Etoposide + G-CSF and to assess the toxicity of this regimen. Patients and methods: Between May 2011 and November 2012, patients with an age \u2264 65 years who had de novo MM and who were eligible for transplantation were included. The mobilization regimen consisted of intravenous etoposide (375 mg/m 2 ) once daily on days 1 and 2 and G-CSF (10\u03bcg/kg) once daily started on day 3 and continued through the last day of stem cell collection. Peripheral blood CD34+ and white blood cell count check was started on day 8. Aphaereses were initiated when the peripheral blood CD34+ count was \u226520/\u03bcl and the white blood cell count \u22651x 109/L. The aphaereses were stopped if the dose of 6 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg was reached. Results: Forty seven patients were included. Median age was 56 years (44-65 y). Forty one patients (87.2 %) received 3 cycles of thalidomide -dexamethasone as induction therapy. No patient received lenalidomide. All patients but one (97.8%) collected successfully after one mobilization. Forty four patients (93.6 %) collected at least 6 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg. The median number of aphaeresis needed was 1",

Mandeleeva, M. Galayko, E. Urnova, M. Nareyko,  A. Kovrigina, I. Kostina, E. Varlamova, E.  Background: Although usually confi ned to the bone marrow, extramedullary (EM) involvement has been reported in up to 15-20% of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) at diagnosis. The clinical course of EM cases treated with conventional therapy is often aggressive and associated with early progression and short survival. Aim: To evaluate high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) effi cacy and long-term outcomes in a cohort of MM patients with EM manifestation. Methods: EM spread of plasma cell myeloma in our study is defi ned as plasma cell tumor extending from the intramedullary spaces of the bone marrow through the cortical bone as well as spread to organs. Hematogenous dissemination into blood vessels resulting in plasma cell leukemia was not included. From September 2001 to September 2012, 138 patients with MM were transplanted in the department of Chemotherapy of Hemoblastosis and Bone Marrow Transplantation. Within this group 39 (28%) had EM involvement, which was palpable or radiographically detected. Among them there were 20 pts with myeloma G, 8 with myeloma A, 7 with light-chain myeloma, 2 with myeloma D, 1 with myeloma M and 1 with non-secretory myeloma. In 99 (72%) cases EM disease was not detected. In this group 55 pts had myeloma G, 25 -myeloma A, 18 -light-chain myeloma and 1 -non-secretory myeloma. Pts received VAD chemotherapy and/or bortezomib + dexamethasone \u00b1 doxorubicin \u00b1 cyclophosphamide. In mobilization procedure the pts received cyclophosphamide followed by daily administration of G-CSF 5 \u03bcg/kg until the peripheral stem cell harvest. HDT/ASCT entailed conditioning with melphalan 200 mg/m 2 . Response was defi ned according to IMWG criteria. Results: The median time of follow-up after ASCT was 28 months(2,. The median of overall survival was 98 months, PFS at5-year was 46,9%, at 7-year -27,1%. 114 pts (83,2%)  are still alive. There was no signifi cant diff erence in PFS and OS in pts with or without EM involvement at the time of diagnosis. The median of PFS was 43 months in the group of pts with EM disease and 45 months in pts without EM involvement. The probability of 5-y OS was 68% in the fi rst group and 77% in the second group (p=0,8). Conclusion: These results suggest that HDT/ASCT is able to overcome the poor prognostic impact of EM involvement at the time of diagnosis, allowing pts to do at least as well as those without EM disease.",

In all pts transplant was deferred and salvage treatment was initiated (VDT-PACE ). During follow up CEUS revealed 3 scenarios: 1. detected areas with absence of EN (necrotic areas) showing initial response; 2. unchanged EN with unchanged US diameters: nonresponse (NR) 3. persistence of EN despite the lesions decreased in size: persistent active disease (PAD). All patients with PR or NR or PAD during salvage treatment experienced further progression (N=9/11). Only pts with hematologic CR, US-CR and CEUS absence of EN moved on to receive consolidation with ASCT (N=2/11). Conclusions: US was a useful, cheap, non-ionizing , bed-side technique to identify EP and thus allowed to change treatment plan in pts with VGPR and even CR. CEUS allowed to detect microvascular changes in MM caused by neoangiogenesis. CEUS showed response to treatment (necrotic areas) but also allowed to detect PAD despite improvement in US size suggesting further treatment. CEUS vs US in liver EM, allowed to up-stage the number of lesions.

Patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function can be treated using highdose melphalan (HD MEL) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. However, such a treatment is impossible in patients with manifest heart failure. The impaired left ventricular systolic function should be at fi rst resolved by orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) and, consequently, amyloidosis could be treated by chemotherapy. Patients and methods: Three patients with manifest heart failure caused by amyloidosis underwent OHT. HSCs collections from peripheral blood after G-CSF 10 \u03bcg/kg/day were followed by HD MEL 100 mg/m 2 with autologous HSC transplantation (ASCT). Results: Patient A (1955) underwent endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) 4/2010 with diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. He did not tolerate chemotherapy because of heart failure. OHT was performed 8/2010 and he underwent HD MEL with ASCT 3/2011, without signifi cant toxicity. However, CR was not achieved and free light chain concentrations slowly increased. Multiple myeloma criteria was completed 12/2011. The patient started BDD therapy and after 7 cycles reached CR. The function of the heart graft is good with no presence of amyloid from the latest EMB 29 months afterOHT. Patient B (1962), with severe heart failure and monoclonal gammopathy, but negative EMB, underwent OHT 7/2010. Non-homogenous deposits of amyloid were found in the explanted heart. Control EMB showed new amyloid deposits in transplant. Therefore, HD MEL with ASCT was performed 1/2011, but with minimal response. CVD 8 cycles given 3-11/2011 resulted in PR. Using 3rd line therapy(RAD, 11/2011(RAD, 11/ -7/2012) stable VGPR was reached. The heart graft function is good, with no presence of amyloid from the latest EMB 31 months afterOHT. Patient C  (1949): Cardiac amyloidosis was diagnosed from EMB 12/2011 and she underwentOHT 5/2012. ASCT was also planned, but the patient surprisingly reached CR -probably because of immunosuppression (tacrolimus, MMF, prednison). The patient is in a stable condition with no evidence of amyloid in the heart graft from the latest EMB (7 months after OHT). Conclusions: OHT in amyloid cardiomyopathy is the only way how to enable a curative hematologic treatment with signifi cant survival improvement.

Results : Median time to ASCT was 7 months vs. 16 months in the early vs. late ASCT. The 3 and 5 yr overall survival (OS) from diagnosis was 89 and 88% versus 88 and 67% in early and late ASCT respectively (P=0.38). 10 and 4 patients in the early and late ASCT have relapsed or progressed with median time to relapse of 26 and 15 months (P=0.17).

Overall survival and event free survival rates were signifi cantly better in patients without neurological events (60.2\u00b13.8% (p=0.004), and 55.5\u00b13.8% (p=0.008), respectively). Conclusion: It was thought that allo-immunoreaction such as GVHD, administration of immunosuppressive drugs, vascular disorder related to SCT, and virus reactivation were involved in the development of neurological complications.

Prete on behalf of the Bone Marrow Transplantation Working Group of the AIEOP Introduction: Busulphan (BU) has been employed for over 30 years in a variety of conditioning regimens for HCST. It has marked neurotoxicity,specifi cally causing seizures. Hence, seizure prophylaxis is routinely utilized during BU administration for HSCT. The risk of seizures is higher with intravenous administration, higher dose and adult age. Most of the available knowledge in this fi eld has been gained on adult patients. In this study we collected data on the incidence of seizures among children undergoing SCT in Italy. Methods: Twelve pediatric transplant centers agreed to report data on all children receiving a BU as part of the conditioning regimen for SCT, between 2005 and 2012. Data on route of administration, drug monitoring, seizure-specifi c risks factors, neurological associated conditions, seizure prophylaxis, and occurrence of seizures were collected. Results: 580 pediatric patients were evaluated; all of them received seizure prophylaxis with very diff erent schedules and drugs. Of them, 61% received BU per os. A total of 12 patients developed seizures (2%). Of them, 3 had a history of epilepsy (or other seizure-related pre-existing condition); 3 had a documented brain lesion potentially causing seizures per se; 1 had seizures during plasma hypo-osmolarity; only in 5 patients seizures were considered not explained by concurrent factors and thus potentially related to BU administration. Conclusion. The incidence of seizures in children receiving BUcontaining regimen is very low. Furthermore, most of the patients who developed seizures had at least one factor which could be considered as a specifi c risk-factor. Thus, universal prophylaxis of seizures in all children receiving BU-containing regimen appears to be not justifi ed. A prospective trial for assessment of seizures in children receinving BU-containing regimen without prophyxis appears warranted. Long-term observation of thrombotic microangiopathies after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation M.Koldehoff , M. Ditschkowski, D.W. Beelen, A.H. Elmaagacli  University of Duisburg-Essen (Essen, DE)    Introduction: Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are rare but serious complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This syndrome associates microangiopathic hemolysis with renal and/or neurologic impairment. The relation between allogeneic HSCT and endothelial injury are complex. Methods and Patients (Pts): To examine this association, we retrospectively studied 1,714 allogeneic pts (median age 48, range 15-74 years) between January 2002 and September 2013. Results: Among these pts, 1193 (70%) developed acute graftversus-host disease (aGvHD) (615 pts (36%) had an aGvHD of grade \u2265 II). We followed 27 pts (14 male, 13 female) in whom concomitant presence of megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (<25/nl), Coombs\u00b4-negative hemolytic anemia (<10 g/dl), absent or reduced plasma haptoglobin levels, fragmented erythrocytes and increased serum level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with no other identifi able cause for those abnormalities, characteristics for TMA. Sepsis and autoimmune hemolysis were excluded. The median age at transplant was 45.0 (range, 18-67) years. Onset of TMA was at 30 days (range, 15-50) after HSCT. Median level profi le of enzymatic activity of the plasma metalloprotease (ADAMTS13), von Willebrand factor (VWF):AG and VWF:multimers shown not signifi cant diff erent in the group of TMA versus controls without TMA. TMA had a higher prevalence in older adults and in male pts. TMA occurred in 89% in pts, who were transplanted with G-CSF mobilized and peripherally collected stem cells (PSC), but in only 11% in pts with bone marrow (BM) source, comparing all transplanted pts (1526 PSC, 188 BM). Stem cell grafts from matched unrelated donor (74%) versus related donors were associated with a higher risk of TMA. Acute GvHD of grade \u2265 II occurred more frequently in the groups with TMA(15/27 vs. 615/1714), and extensive chronic GvHD (30%) was ascertained in TMA pts vs. 21% in all transplanted pts. Three pts with TMA are still alive (11%) at a median survival time of 407 days and 24 pts (88%) with TMA died from multiple organ failure, sepsis and relapse. Conclusions: Our evaluation confi rms a strong association between G-CSF mobilized PSC, severe aGvHD, unrelated donors and the development of TMA.Ferritin levels and comorbidity scores as predictors for allo-haematopoietic stem cell transplantation outcome R. Fern\u00e1ndez, AP. Gonz\u00e1lez, AJ. Gonz\u00e1lez, C. Pardo, C. Alarc\u00f3n, P. Palomo, S. Gonz\u00e1lez, C. Ray\u00f3n, C. Vallejo Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Introduction: High ferritin levels have a signifi cant impact on post-HSCT complications and survival. Patients comorbidity (as categorized by the HCT-comorbidity index [HCT-CI] and the pretransplant assessment of mortality [PAM] score) are also predictors for HSCT outcome. Objective: We aimed to estimate the predictive value of ferritin levels and comorbidity scores on the outcome after allo-HSCT. Patients and methods: we retrospectively analyzed 94 patients who received allo-HSCT, 50% from unrelated donor, in our center between 2008 and 2011. Median age was 48 years (range 15-65).Most frequent diseases were acute leukemia (n=28, 29.8%) and multiple myeloma (n=28, 29.8%). RIC regimens were used in 48% of cases. The median follow-up for survivors was 763 days (range 296-1950). Results: The median pre-HSCT ferritin was 623 ng/ml (range 17-4468), and 38.3% patients had ferritin >1000 ng/ml. The median Sorror and PAM scores were 2 (range 0-9) and 21 (range 11-32), respectively. Patients with higher ferritin levels (\u2265 median value; HFL group, n=47) had more acute leukemia (55.3% vs. 4.2%, p=0.004) and less multiple myeloma (10.6% vs. 48.9%, p=0.02) compared to patients with lower ferritin levels (< median value; LFL group, n=47). The ferritin levels refl ected the transfusion load and the patient comorbidity, as HFL group had more frequently been transfused and showed more adverse risk scores than LFL group (\u226520 PRCB units: 53.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001; Sorror \u22652: 61.8% vs. 38.2%, p= 0.008; PAM score \u226524: 46.8% vs. 21.1% p= 0.01). The day 100 non-relapse mortality rate was 8.7%(2.1% in LFL group  and 19.1% in HFL group; p=0.02). The 2-year overall survival (2-y OS) was 63% (75% in LFL group and 45% in HFL group; p= 0.002). Non-relapse and relapse mortalities accounted for 17.4% and 14.8% of the whole series, respectively. LFL and HFL groups had similar risk of: bacteriemias until day 100, aGVHD, cGVHD and grade III-IV hepatic and renal toxicities. The comorbidity scores showed association with HSCT outcome. A Sorror index \u22652 and a PAM \u226524 score correlated with a lower 2-y OS (r2=1.020, p= 0.026 and r2=1.076, p= 0.045, respectively). In multivariate analysis, ferritin levels showed predictive value for 2-y OS (p=0.011), while transfusion history of \u226520 RBC units, Sorror index \u22652, and PAM score \u226524 did not. Conclusion: In our cohort of pts, comorbidity scores (HCI-CI, PAM) and, particularly, high ferritin levels are good predictors of HSCT outcome.

Arcese On behalf of Rome Transplant NetworkIntroduction: Quality of life (QoL) during and after stem cell transplantation could be infl uenced by both transplant (SCT) related complications, disease complications and co-morbidities. Transplant-related complications are frequent and well-known events, although data about their eff ect on QoL are scarce. Purpose: To identify a pattern of post-transplant QoL monitoring having the highest chance to intercept QoL variations. Methods: By analyzing available scientifi c literature data about transplant related complications, we addressed the following variables: onset period, clinical course, duration, frequency and risk of QoL reduction; for the latter, we measured 3 elements for each complication: complication-related symptom burden, treatmentrelated symptom burden and risk of hospitalization (considered to be key factors on inducing a reduction in quality of life). Results: We analyzed 38 complications, early (<30 days), intermediate (30-100 days) and late (>100 days) in 12, 7 and 19 complications respectively. Clinical course: acute in 20 and chronic in 18; among acute complications, duration was: <30 and >30 days in 19 and 1 respectively; duration of all the chronic complications was >30 days in all the cases. Frequency was high (>30%), moderate (10-20%), low (5-10%) and very low (<5%) in 11, 9, 12 and 6 complications, respectively. We calculated the risk of QoL reduction as very high, moderately high and low in 15, 17 and 6, respectively. Among the high/moderate frequency (>20%) groups (20/38), we chronologically located complications as: early in 6 (all acute, duration <30 days in 5/6), intermediate in 3 (all acute, lasting <30 days) and late in 11 complications (all chronic, lasting >30 days). Conclusions: In the early phase, we suggest QoL monitoring at least once a week (in order not to miss many of the complications, due to their short duration, usually <30 days) even with daily monitoring of certain parameters (eg CINV, mucositis, pain); in the intermediate-late phase indeed, complications are more diluted over time, but many of them can heavily impact on qol; their duration, however, usually exceeds 30 days; for this phase, therefore, we suggest both to monitor QoL upon a fi xed rarefi ed schedule (eg. quarterly) and to intensify monitoring at the onset of the complication, anchoring intensifi ed QoL assessment to the date of complication diagnosis and carrying on until resolution and treatment discontinuation.P1027Management of mucositis in adult patients after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation: adherence to guidelines A.Tendas, A.

Objectives: To compare and evaluate strategies for mucositis monitoring, prevention and treatment used in the 6 adult centers of the Rome Transplant Network (RTN). Methods: Each center fi lled out an assessment form by including: incidence, monitoring, prevention and treatment of mucositis. Cost-eff ectiveness ratio of each scheme was evaluated by counting missing prescriptions and not required prescriptions, as recommended by MASCC/ESMO mucositis guidelines (2007 update). Results: Forms were delivered and completed on April 2011. Incidence: median reported mucositis incidence was 77% (20-100).",

Elez, B. Balint, O. Tarabar, S. Marjanovic,  Z. Tatomirovic, M. Strnad, A. Zivanovic Ivic, Lj. Tukic  Military Medical Academy (Belgrade, RS)    Introduction: Approximately 20-40% of all HLA matched allogeneic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are ABO incompatible. Persistent anti-donor isoagglutinins after major ABO blood group incompatible HSCT may cause delayed red blood cell (RBC) engraftment and post transplant pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Appropriate treatment of PRCA is not well established. The therapeutic approaches that might be eff ective in some patients with post transplant PRCA include: plasma exchange and immunoadsorption, erythropoetine, donor lymphocyte infusion, steroids or induction of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) by Cyclosporine A (CsA) discontinuation, anti CD20 antibody. Aim: We are representing two patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) successfully treated with anti CD20 antibody for PRCA after ABO incompatible HSCT. Cases: Two patients, one 18 years old male and one 24 years old female with AML were transplanted in our center after initial treatment and achievement of complete remission. Donors were HLA identical siblings with ABO major incompatibility in both cases. They were conditioned with Busulphan (16 mg/kg) and Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and stem cell sources were peripheral blood. In each case, plasma exchange was performed before myeloinfusion in order to overcome ABO incompatibility. GvHD prophylaxis was consisted of CsA and short course Methotrexate. Engraftments of polymorphonuclears and platlets were achieved on +13. and +17. day, respectively. Complete chimerism in both cases was documented by accepted methods. Bone marrow aspirate on day +28. showed complete absence of erythroid precursors, while neutrophils and megakariocytes were present. Diagnosis of PRCA was established according to hematological parameters (anaemia and reticulocytopoenia) and exclusion of relapse, Parvo B19, other viral infections and RBC alloantibodies. Treatment approaches with plasma exchange, corticoteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins together with tapering of CsA were without response. Afterwards, patients have received monoclonal anti CD20 antibody 200 mg/m 2 . Even after fi rst dose, RBC have arised promptly. Both patients were still in complete remission for 42 and 32 months after transplant. One of them have mild form of chronic GvHD. Conclusion: Immunotherapy with monoclonal anti CD 20 antibody may be eff ective in the treatment of PRCA after ABO incompatible HSCT, but future analysis are necessary. ), A. Giulivi(1), E.

Conditioning regimens included busulfan + melphalan for NB and Ew patients and BCNU, etoposide, cytosar and melphalan for NHL patients. Four MB patients received 3 tandem transplants (conditioned with carboplatin + thiotepa) and 4 patients -4 tandem transplants (conditioned with cisplatin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide). Measures of number of days out of normal range, for each electrolyte, were counted. Results: Out of normal range was mainly documented for K, P and Mg but not for Na and T.Bili., with no diff erences between patients getting tandem transplants and those receiving only one transplant, across all protocols and diagnoses. NB patients suff ered more comparing to Ew patients though receiving the same conditioning. No diff erences were seen between MB patients receiving 3 or 4 tandem transplants, but in Mg where it was 10 times more frequent in patients getting 4 transplants. Moreover, no deterioration was documented during proceeding from transplant to transplant. NHL patients demonstrated the higher number of days with electrolyte disturbances. No change in T.

Conventional treatment (withdrawal of immunosuppression, administration of rituximab/chemotherapy) is often eff ective but risks organ rejection and causes signifi cant side eff ects. EBV specifi c cytotoxic T cells (CTL) generated in vitro from autologous lymphocytes can be eff ective with few side eff ects, but take months to prepare so are diffi cult to use in clinical practice. We have established a bank of EBV CTLs derived from platelet/ plasma donors for issuing 'off the shelf product' to partially Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) matched patients on a named patient basis. Donors from the New Zealand platelet / plasma panel were sourced to reduce the risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The current panel of donors selected was EBV positive, Blood Group O, and met all current requirements for mandatory virology markers. The panel was also chosen to maximize the probability of HLA class I and II matches and minimize the number of mismatches. We estimated that this initial panel of 25 donors should provide a partial match for at least three (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1) loci for ~80% of Caucasian patients. So far, lymphoblastoid cell lines have been made from 25 donors ready for use in stimulating CTLs and 18 CTLs have been manufactured and cryopreserved for clinical use. Since the bank was granted a 'Specials' license by the MHRA for this Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product in January 2012, there have been enquiries about 14 patients: 4 improved on conventional therapy without requiring CTLs, 3 died before any cells could be issued and 6 cell lines have been released. The indications for issue have been: 3 cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (1 CD20-rituximab resistant, 1 with concomitant graft versus host disease precluding reduction of immunosuppression, 1 unfi t for chemotherapy), 2 cases with congenital immunosuppression as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and 1 case of EBV-associated leiomyosarcoma post-cardiac transplant (related donor). Clinical improvement has been seen in 4 out of 6 assessable patients. A 3rd party donor-derived anti-EBV CTL cell bank can be operated under current legislation and is a valuable addition to existing therapies for selected patients.P1047 Frequent chromosomal instability in somatic and tumour cells after haematopoietic cell transplantationM.

Aims:(1)  to examine the prevalence of SM (i.e. Medical-SM i.e. smoking, alcohol consumption, vaccination, physical activity, dietary habits, sun protection, medication adherence; Role-SM i.e. professional employment; Emotional SM i.e. depression & anxiety in SCT survivors; and (2) to compare the prevalence of specifi c health behaviours with health recommendations by the Swiss Federal Offi ce of Public Health (FOPH) and with normative data of the Swiss population. Methods: This multi-centre cross-sectional study (2 Swiss SCT centres) included a convenience sample of 374 patients [54.6% males; mean age 50.3 years (SD=12.8); median 7 years post allogeneic SCT (IQR=8.7), chronic Graft versus Host Disease=40.6%].

Medication adherence was measured with the BAASIS\u00ae and depression and anxiety by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. FOPH Health recommendations in regard to physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption and normative data from the Swiss Health survey (2007) were used for comparison. Frequencies/% were calculated to describe SM behaviours. Results: SM assessment revealed following fi ndings: actual smoking (13.5%), alcohol use (81.4%), no fl u vaccination in past year (41.9%), medication non-adherence (67% for immunosuppressants and 42.9% for other medications), depression (11.3%) and, anxiety (14.8%). 73.7% of patients were employed (37.7% fulltime/36% part-time). Large discrepancies with Swiss National health recommendations were observed; only 17.6% of SCT patients vs. 38% in normative sample were moderately physically active for at least 30 minutes/ day. Fewer SCT patients compared to the normal population ate the recommended daily 5 pieces of fruits and vegetables (17.6% vs. 29%), one dairy product (12.3% vs. 62%), and at least once weekly fi sh (31.2% vs. 58%). Conclusions: This study reveals considerable room for improvement in SM post-SCT. Compared to the normal population less SCT patients were physically active and had a balanced diet. Future studies should investigate associations between SM and clinical outcomes.Gonadal dysfunction is very common after HCT, particularly in women. The aim of this study was to investigate the methods of conception and delivery, as well as the course and outcome of pregnancy in patients with thalassemia major (TM) treated with HCT. Among 98 patients (males 51, females 47) who survived more than 1 year after transplant (median follow-up 249 months, range 19-360), 23 pregnancies occurred in 7 female patients and partners of 3 male patients. None of these patients had chronic graft-versus-host disease. FEMALE PATIENTS: the median age at time of HCT was 14 (12-19) years, whereas the median interval from HCT to fi rst pregnancy was 16",

In the current study, pulmonary function (PF) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) was longitudinally analyzed and the clinical variables aff ecting PF were evaluated. Methods: From Jun 2002 to Oct 2008, we retrospectively analyzed PF in 116 consecutive patients who received allo-SCT and survived at least 3 months after transplantation. Pulmonary function test was performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. Ventilatory capacity was measured by forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the fi rst second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC ratio. Lung volume measurements included total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and RV/TLC ratio. Diff usion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was determined with correction for hemoglobin concentration. Results: Of the 116 patients, 63 patients were followed more than 1 year. The patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; p=0.011), chronic GVHD (p=0.009), or CMV infection (p=0.410) showed a decline of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC after 1 year of transplantation. TLC and RV/TLC also showed an increasing tendency after 1 year of transplantation which refl ected abnormal ventilatory pulmonary function. Conditioning intensity, unrelated donor type, stem cell dose did not adversely aff ect the pulmonary function. We calculated the lung function score (defi ned as FEV1 score plus DLCO score; NIH chronic GVHD consensus Project, 2003) at 1 year of transplant and compared it from that of baseline to identify the factors aff ecting late pulmonary dysfunction. In the multivariate analysis, extensive cGVHD (OR=3.692, 95% CI=1.154-11.818; p=0.028) and previous CMV infection (OR=5.356, 95% CI=1.311-21.882; p=0.019) negatively aff ected on late pulmonary function.",

            "text": "Objective: Few studies have documented rates of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders in patients planning to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), although high rates of distress have been reported. The aims of the current study are to: 1) determine rates of major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and clinically signifi cant depressive and anxious symptomatology prior to HCT, and 2) compare quality of life (QoL) in patients with depression and/or anxiety to those without. Methods: As part of a larger study of HCT, mood and anxiety disorders were assessed in 127 participants (61% men, mean age 51 years old) with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders. Self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and QoL were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form -36. Data were collected prior to HCT. Results: A total of 6% (n=7) participants met criteria for current major depressive disorder and 13% (n=16) met criteria for an anxiety disorder. A total of 20% (n=26) reported clinically signifi cant symptoms of depression while 16% (n=20) reported clinically signifi cant symptoms of anxiety. Patients with major depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder were more likely to be past or current smokers (ps<.05). Patients with current major depressive disorder reported lower physical functioning, role functioning emotional, vitality, social functioning and mental health (ps<.05). Patients with an anxiety disorder reported lower physical functioning, social functioning and mental health (ps<.05). Of patients with clinically signifi cant depressive symptomatology or major depressive disorder (n=28), 61% (n=17) were not prescribed antidepressant medication. Conclusions: Prior to HCT, a sizeable minority of patients met criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder or clinically signifi cant depressed or anxious symptomatology. Proactive management of depression and anxiety in these patients may help to improve pre-HCT QoL.

Kyrcz-Krzemien, G. Helbig, M. Markiewicz, A. Waclawik,  K. Bialas, M. Kopera  Medical University of Silesia (Katowice, PL)    Introduction: Isolated extramedullary relapses (IEMR) are increasingly observed late complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, an optimal therapeutic approach to IEMR following allo-HSCT has not yet been established. Aims and methods: We retrospectively investigated incidence, clinical features, treatment options and long-term outcome of this pattern of leukemia recurrence in a cohort of 544 consecutive patients (pts) (208 with ALL, 336 with AML) who underwent allo-HSCT in our institution between June 1993 and December 2011. 82 pts (37 with ALL, 45 with AML) relapsed (any site). Results: 14 (17%) out of all pts who relapsed (4 with high-risk B-line ALL, 2 with T-line ALL, 8 with AML, F/M 8/6, median age 35 years, range 23 -54 years) experienced histologically proven IEMR after a median time of 12 months (mts) (range, 5 -80 mts) following allo-HSCT. 6 pts (4 with ALL, 2 with AML) developed skin and/ or subcutaneous tissue infi ltrates. Other sites of IEMR included (No. of cases/diagnosis): leptomeninges of the brain (1/ Ph+ ALL), paraspinal soft tissues (1/AML), small intestine (1/AML), lymph nodes (1/AML), paranasal sinuses (1/AML), pleura (1/ALL), breast (1/AML), retro-orbital region (1/ALL). Treatment plans for those IEMR included (No. of cases/diagnosis): 1/involved-fi eld radiotherapy (IF-RT) followed by chemotherapy (CHT) and interferon-\u03b1 (2/ ALL), 2/ imatinib + CHT + steroids and methotrexate intrathecally (1/ ALL), 3/ imatinib + CHT (1/ ALL), 4/ CHT (3/ AML, 3/ALL), 5/ dasatinib (1/ CD117+ AML,), 6/ surgery (1/AML), 7/ CHT and secondary allo-HSCT (2/AML). 10/14 pts died after a median time of 9,5 mts (range, 1 -30 mts) due to resistant systemic relapse and/or infectious complications, 4/14 pts are currently under CHT or after secondary allo-HSCT. Conclusions: Our data indicate that extramedullary disease following allo-HSCT aff ects a signifi cant proportion of pts with acute leukemias. Sites of relapses vary widely among the pts with skin and/or subcutaneous tissue being frequently involved. IF-RT seems to be eff ective initial treatment option, but it does not prevent from systemic relapse and should be combined with more intensive systemic therapy that can produce favorable response in a percentage of the pts.P1054 Pubertal development and ovarian function after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in childhood D. Bresters, J. Emons, N. Nuri, W.J.W. Kollen, L.M. Ball, S.E. Hannema, J.G. van der Bom, W. Oostdijk LUMC\\WAKZ (Leiden, NL)Objectives: To assess the cumulative incidence of ovarian failure after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in childhood. In addition, HSCT related risk factors for ovarian failure, and in (pre-)pubertal girls the need for hormonal induction of puberty, were assessed. Patients and methods: In a retrospective cohort study, patients who fulfi lled the following requirements were eligible: 1. HSCT during childhood (<18 years) in the pediatric department of Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), 2. survival at least 2 years after HSCT, 3. age more than 10 years at start of study. Data collected included: age at time of study and at HSCT, diagnosis/indication for HSCT, conditioning regimen, date of last follow-up, date of menarche, Tanner stage, hormonal levels involved in the pituitary gonadal axis (FSH, LH, estradiol), date of diagnosis of gonadal failure and hormonal induction of puberty/hormonal replacement therapy. Data were analyzed by Chi square tests, Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: Of 141 eligible girls 109 girls were followed up in our center and subsequently included in this study. The cumulative incidence of gonadal failure was 61.5% (67/109). Hormonal induction of pubertal development was needed in 33 of 102 girls (32%) who were (pre-)pubertal at HSCT. Cumulative incidence of ovarian failure was signifi cantly diff erent (p=0.001) depending on puberty stage at HSCT: 49% (35/71) in pre-pubertal girls, 81% (25/31) in pubertal girls and 100% (7/7) in post-pubertal girls. Cox regression analysis, accounting for follow-up time, showed neither diagnosis (relative risk (RR) 1.6 for malignant versus benign hematological disease, p=0.16) nor conditioning regimen (RR 0.9 for conditioning including total body irradiation versus chemotherapy but no irradiation, p=0.72) to be signifi cant risk factors for ovarian failure. However, in girls who received a conditioning regimen with chemotherapy only (n=51), the RR for ovarian failure with a regimen including Busulfan as compared to a regimen without Busulfan was 3.6 (p=0.03). Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of ovarian failure after HSCT in childhood is high and will presumably increase with duration of follow-up. Risk for ovarian failure is increased in girls with a more developed pubertal stage at HSCT and with the use of Busulfan in the conditioning regimen.Background: The success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is limited by chronic pulmonary Graft-Versus-Host Disease (cGvHD) with risk of progressive obliteration of peripheral airways (PA). Diagnosis may be delayed due to low sensitivity of standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs) on which conventional criteria for bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) are based. Lung clearance index (LCI) measured by nitrogen multiple breath washout is a promising method to assess ventilation distribution inhomogenity indicative of peripheral airway disease (Robinson 2010). This study investigates LCI in children and young adults years after HSCT in childhood and associations to cGvHD, respiratory symptoms and other PFTs. Methods: We performed a population based cross-sectional study of paediatric SCT-patients transplanted between 2003 and 2009. Patients were screened for cGvHD(Filipovich 2005)  and respiratory symptoms(St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ). LCI was measured by Exhalyzer D (Eco Medics, AG, Switzerland), and are presented as z-scores based on normative data from an ongoing study (Houltz 2012). LCI were correlated to standard PFTs by linear regression. Results: Ninety-six patients were eligible for the study of whom 67 participated(table 1). cGvHD was diagnosed in 7 patients but none met the criteria for BO. One patient was excluded due to severe sclerodermic extrapulmonary restriction. LCI was abnormal in 52 % of patients, while only 12 % had abnormal forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). LCI was weakly Presence of cGvHD or previous acute GvHD, malignant versus non-malignant diagnosis, conditioning with busulfan or total body irradiation, current age, time from HSCT and age at HSCT were not signifi cantly associated with LCI values.",

            "text": "Objectives The concept of HRQoL is considered to be an important endpoint when evaluating allogeneic HCT outcome. Using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Bone Marrow Transplantation scale (FACT-BMT, including some additional items), we attempted to obtain prospective real-life HRQoL data from our region and to compare HRQoL among diff erent groups of survivors (divided esp. age, intensity of conditioning, etc.). We also tried to identify the following: factors predicting diminished HRQoL, survivor drop-out, percentage of patients returning to work and whether HCT survivors regret their decision to undergo HCT. Methods Because HRQoL is lowest during inpatient stay due to acute complications, we do not follow the HRQoL in the early post HCT period. HRQoL was measured in 158 patients (3 years descriptive statistics) in addition to fully pair-wise analysis of the cohort of survivors (N = 56) at three consecutive follow-up points (prior HCT, 6 months and 1 year post HCT). Results Patients over 50 years described signifi cantly worse HRQoL 6 months and 1 year post HCT; no changes were identifi ed during 1 year and 2 year follow-up and no eff ect of type of conditioning (reduced-intensity /RIC/ vs. myeloablative /MAC/) was detected. Potential predictors of lower HRQoL: age over 50, lower degree of education, diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, presence of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease, long stay in hospital and lower HRQoL prior HCT. During 3 year follow-up, there was signifi cant drop out and only 9.5% patients (21% HCT survivals) cooperated during the whole period. Employment status: 14.3% after 1 year and 6.7% after 3 years. Offi ce workers returned to work more frequently than others. 96.2% patients with good HRQoL do not regret their decision to undergo HCT (84.6% of those with low HRQoL). The same number gave a positive answer to the question concerning their positive decision to undergo HCT in view of their current experience and more than 90% in both groups would recommend HCT to their best friend. Conclusion Systematic measurement of HRQoL is necessary, but in everyday practice it is associated with signifi cant drop-out of survivors willing to participate. In contrast to published data, only a minority of our patients returned to work (perhaps due to diff erent economic motivations and social and health care programs). Survivors only rarely regret their decision to undergo HCT (even if their HRQoL is not good).Introduction: Relapse represents the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) could be valuable in the early detection of recurrence. Multiparameter Flow Cytometry (MFC), chimerism, cytogenetics and molecular analysis have been used for this purpose. Assuming that blasts may be present in decreasing mixed chimerism (de-MC) but not in the complete chimerism (CC) status, we used these two ranges as markers of positive and negative MRD. The aim of our study was fi rstly to assess the overall agreement among chimerism (de-MC vs CC), MFC and WT1 mRNA methods in monitoring MRD and secondly to investigate whether results were associated to patient' s relapse-free and overall survivals. Methods: 67 fresh BM samples from 24 pts(17 AML , 7 ALL)  in CR after allo-SCT were investigated. MRD by six-color MFC, RQ-PCR WT1 mRNA and 16 (STR) chimerism analysis was evaluated at diff erent time points. Results: A signifi cant moderate agreement between MFC and WT1 mRNA evaluations was found (k= 0.463, p<0.001) as well as between chimerism and both MFC (k= 0.284,p=0.009)and WT1 (k= 0.197,p=0.073). A higher concordance by both MFC (75.0% vs. 32.7%, p=0.010) and WT1 (58.3% vs. 29.1%, p=0.090)was detected among de-MC rather than CC samples. The median follow-up times for RFS and OS were 11.07(6.05-18.46) and 12.80 (8.72-21.71) mths. At the end of follow-up, 5 pts relapsed and 4 pts died. Data suggested longer RFS and OS for MRD-negative pts than ones positive for any method with the exception of chimerism. In fact, similar results at 30 mths were observed from comparisons between positive and negative MRD by MFC (RFS: 74.5% vs 87.5% , p=0.532; OS: 87.5% among MFC-, p=0.674) and WT1(RFS: 76.0% vs 85.7% , p=0.672; OS: 41.2% vs 85.7% ,p=0.919). Diff erently, from chimerism analysis (RFS: 81.8%vs 76.9%, p=0.694; OS: 79.1% among CC, p=0.936), the de-MC identifi ed a good risk setting. Conclusions: MFC, WT1 mRNA and chimerism displayed an overall agreement in monitoring MRD. A better concordance among three methods was obtained within the de-MC status compared to CC but levels of positivity were also found within CC status. These results discourage the chimerism analysis in the monitoring of MRD but suggest closer times of follow-up in the setting of de-MC. MRD by MFC and WT1 RQ-PCR demonstrated better capabilities to stratify pts on the basis of the risk of relapse respect to the chimerism.P1061Acquired factor IX and XI defi ciency in a Hodgkin's lymphoma patient after allogeneic stem cell transplant M.Sever, J.

            "text": "Case report: A 29 year-old patient with Hodgkin's disease in second remission has autologous HSCT with BEAM conditioning in 02/2010. In 07/2010 he had a second relapse and started with CHLVPP. Allogeneic MUD SCT was performed with Cy-TBI conditioning in 02/2011. The post transplant period was uneventful until D+120, when he was admitted for massive hematuria. Coagulation tests showed prolonged aPTT and a low activity of factors IX and XI with inhibitors. The patient started with rFVIIa. At the same time, a long term inhibitor eradication began with methyprednisolone 1 mg/kg and four weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/m 2 . After four weeks, the factor IX and XI activity normalized and spontaneous bleeding stopped (Picture 1). Due to intense immune suppression, the patient developed Rhisopus spp. pneumonia, for which he expired despite intensive therapy. Discussion: Acquired coagulation factors defi ciency after SCT is rare. In our case, it developed in spite of stringent GvHD prevention with MTX/CSA. To our best knowledge, this is the fi rst case of inhibitors against FIX and FXI reported. The decision to proceed with the above treatment was based on reports of acquired FVII hemophilia with responses close to 90% after rituximab. The accompanying immune defi ciency early in the post-SCT period and additional immune suppression is an important risk factor for infection and in spite of all precautions it was fatal for the patient. Conclusions: Acquired FIX and FXI defi ciency can develop in the post allogeneic SCT setting. Condition can be treated with rFVIIa, corticosteroids and rituximab. Severe immune suppression following the treatment is challenging and potentially fatal.P1062Female fertility after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in Denmark. A national cohort studyH. Larsen, C. Roepstorff , H. Petersen, C. Heilmann, H. Sengel\u00f8v  University Hospital Copenhagen (Copenhagen, DK)    Background: It is well known that female fertility is impaired after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), however, more female patients become long term survives, and wish to have children of their own. Data regarding pregnancies and child births are scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of female patients obtaining documented pregnancy and motherhood following SCT. Methods: We obtained data regarding pregnancies and child births in consecutive female transplant recipients from our center. The patients were treated with SCT in the period from 1976 to 2012. Data was obtained through the national centralized access to the patients\u00b4 medical records including specialist treatment. Patients less than 17 years of age at the time of analysis were excluded. In total, 161 women were included in the analysis. The median age at SCT was 17.2 years, and 31.4 years at analysis. Of the 161 women, 24 (15%) died in the observation period, the surviving 138 women were observed median 12.3 years (0.. Results: Of the 161 women, 20 (12.3%) had at least one documented pregnancy (i.e. fertile). One of the 20 women which experienced pregnancy is dead and never gave birth. Thirteen (8%) woman obtained motherhood: 8 had one child, 5 had two children. All children born were healthy. Among the women with a pregnancy, 9/20 (45%) had non-malignant hematological disease, and 11/20 (55%) had malignant disease, among the non-fertile women the numbers were 36/141 (25%) and 106/141 (75%), respectively (p=0.66). Of the woman with motherhood, 7/13 (54%) had non-malignant disease, whereas 38/148 (26%) of the remaining women had non-malignant disease (p=0,029). Total body irradiation (TBI) was given to 7 (54%) of the women with completed delivery, at a dosage of 200 cGy in 2 and 850-1200 cGy in 5 patients. The median age at HSCT was not diff erent among fertile and non-Not all women are infertile following allogeneic SCT, despite treatment with TBI chemotherapy and chronic GvHD. However, only 8% obtained motherhood, emphasizing the need for fertility conservation procedures. The current study benefi ts from centralized access to patient information ensuring a high quality of accurate and complete data.P1063 Expansion of large granular lymphocytes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation G. Sucak, S.Z Aki, M. Pamukcuoglu, E. Suyani, S. Altindal Gazi University Faculty of Medicine (Ankara, TR)Objectives: Chronic persistent antigenic stimulation by an autoantigen or a foreign infective antigen can trigger and maintain the expansion of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). We examined the peripheral blood smears of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) recipients for presence of LGL expansion and investigated its clinical signifi cance. Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients[55 male, 25 female with a median age of 32 years-old (range 20-64)] attending the allogeneic HSCT follow-up clinic between January 2012 and September 2012 were included in the study. LGL \u2265 0.4x109/L was considered to be signifi cant and patients were grouped into LGL (+) and (-) by accordingly. Patients with absolute lymphocyte count \u2265 3.0 x109/L and LGL count \u2265 1.5 x109/L were identifi ed as having \"LGL expansion\". Results: The median follow-up after allogeneic HSCT in LGL (+) vs (-) patients was 30 months (range 4-95) vs 27 months (range 9-101) (p=0.477) respectively. LGL was \u2265 0.4x109/L in 31/80 patients (38.75 %). Immunophenotypically LGL cells expressed CD3+/ CD57+/CD8+ in 16 out of 31 patients (51.6 %). The incidence of CMV reactivation was higher in LGL (+) group though without statistical signifi cance (p= 0.062). The frequency of acute and chronic GVHD was similar in the two groups (p= 0.726 and p= 0.332 respectively). Two out of 80 patients (2.5 %) showed LGL expansion. In univariate regression analysis mean LGL count was signifi cantly higher only in patients who were transplanted with a myeloablative conditioning regimen (487.03 \u00b1 481.49 vs 257.23 \u00b1 246.30, p= 0.025). Discussion:LGL lymphocytosis was observed in 38.75 % of the patients and LGL expansion was limited to 2.5 % of the patients.LGL expansions after allogeneic HSCT have been published previously with relationship with viral reactivation. In our study higher frequency of CMV reactivation in patients with LGL (+) group, though not signifi cant might suggest that viral stimulation could have been the cause of the reactive lymphocytosis. We have not demonstrated cytopenia(s) or autoimmune abnormalities in patients with LGL (+) group. In conclusion persistent benign lymphocytosis with LGL expansion can be seen in clinically asymptomatic allogeneic HSCT recipients during long term follow-up. Clinical signifi cance of LGL expansion, its role in graft versus tumor eff ect, and factors associated with LGL expansion should be evaluated in further studies with larger sample size and longer follow up.

In this study we retrospectively analyzed patient data to investigate the frequency and clinical implications of passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS), pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in 310 patients undergoing allogeneic SCT who received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) at Karolinska University Hospital between 1998 and 2011. Methods: Each patient's computer patient journal was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with PLS, PRCA or AIHA. PLS and PRCA were defi ned as patients having detectable ABO-antibodies of donor or recipient type respectively after SCT. Transplantation characteristics and clinical outcome were then analyzed using multivariate and univariate analysis for groups with or without PLS/PRCA/AIHA. Incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM), graft versus host disease (GvHD), overall survival (OS), relapse free survival (RFS), ATG, diagnose, graft source, type of donor (sibling or unrelated), graft failure (GF), incidence of post-SCT virus infection and for major ABO-mismatch pre-SCT anti-A/anti-B titer were investigated. Re-transplantations were excluded. Results: There were no signifi cant correlation between ABO blood group incompatibility and any tested clinical outcome. 6 patients were found to have had PLS, 12 patients PRCA and 12 patients AIHA post SCT. OS in the PLS group was 0% compared to 61% in the whole group receiving minor ABO mismatched transplants (p<0.001). 4 out of 6 patients died from a relapse. In the PRCA group OS was 17% as compared to 73% in the whole group receiving major ABO miss matched SCT (p=0.002). TRM was 50% in the PRCA group and 21% within the major ABO mm SCT (p=0.03) and RFS was 33% compared to 78% (p=0.03). PRCA was not correlated to titer anti-A/anti-B in recipient plasma prior SCT. AIHA did not aff ect survival, TRM or RFS, but AIHA patients had less aGvHD II-IV (p=0.05). Conclusion: At our center PLS and PRCA were found to be associated with a signifi cant decrease in OS. In addition patients suff ering from PRCA had an increase in TRM and a decrease in RFS. PLS and PRCA are risk factors in allogeneic SCT and may be important to diagnose.Background: Autologous transplantation (ASCT) is used for the treatment of lymphoproliferation, in smaller degree for the treatment of some autoimmune diseases and solid tumors. We focused on patients quality of life (QoL) after ASCT, especially on patients suff ering from lymphoproliferative disease in our work. We consider this study as very unique project. Long-term data about patients quality of life are missing. was used for this analysis. The questionnaire consists of four parts -physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and functional well-being (FWB). The patients completed the Q before the transplantation (at the time of indication or at the time of admission to SCT). Patients were divided into 7 groups -before SCT (207), day +100 up to 1y (72), 1-2y (93), 2-3y (68), 3-5y (142) and more than 5y (287). The clinical characteristics were obtained from national transplant registry; the data was cleaned and updated. Wilcoxon and Kruskall-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. There was no formal control, we have used the Austrian data of normal responders with 86.6 for total FACT-G (Holzner 2004). Results: The QoL measured by FACT-G was 73.9 before ASCT and it has been signifi cantly (<0.01) improved during time afte r ASCT. It was due to the PWB and FWB (<0.0001 and <0.001 resp). It was observed in NHL as well HL subgroups, there was however no signifi cant improvement in MM subgroup, in fact there was decrease from score 77.1 at y 1-2 to score 70.9 among the pts > 5y. The QoL FACT-G was infl uenced by age , diagnosis and relapses. The FACT-G score among long-term survivors (> 5y) was however lower(79.0) compared to the published data (86.6). Conclusion: The QoL after ASCT is improving during time and it is signifi cantly better in NHL and HL pts compared to the MM patients. Higher age and relapse after ASCT is correlated with worse QoL.

P1066 High incidence of normal pregnancies after high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant in young females with non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma: defi ning and analyzing 'potential to become pregnant' group S. Akhtar, T.A.M. Elhassan, H. Soudy, I. Youssef, R. Belkhedim, I. Maghfoor King Faisal Specialist Hosp. & Res. Ctr (Riyadh, SA) Background: Available data is limited to address the incidence of pregnancies after high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDC ASCT); even non-existing in Middle East/Arab countries where patients are young with big family size and having children without marriage is unacceptable. After HDC ASCT, primary infertility, electively no pregnancy, physiological menopause and other issues are not usually addressed. We report our observation. Patients and Methods: All female patients who underwent HDC ASCT for non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma from 1996 to 2010 were reviewed to identify \"potential to become pregnant\" (PTBP) patients. This is defi ned as 1. alive 24 months after HDC ASCT with no disease. 2. No active disease at the time of analysis. 3. < 40 years at HDC ASCT. 4. No known cause of infertility and 5. No radiation therapy to pelvic area. We analyzed our data to 1. Identify patients with PTBP. 2. Overall incidence of pregnancy in PTBC group and 3. Incidence of pregnancy in patients who actually tried to get pregnant. Results: Total of 157 females underwent HDC ASCT. 55 of them were dead at the time of this analysis, not eligible as PTBP; 29/55 persistent / progressive disease, 7/55 treatment related mortality, 10/52 died due to relapsed disease within 24 months, 7/52 > 40 years at transplant, 2/55 other reasons. For remaining 102 alive patients, 27 were excluded as; 16/102 were > 40 years at the time of HDC ASCT, 8/102 with <24 months of follow up (all are <30 years, median age 26 years) and 3/102 with active disease. Remaining 75 patients are PTBP. 13/75 had no information available (in process). For remaining 62 patients, 33 are married / sexually active and 29 of them tried to get pregnant: of these 29 who tried, 19 (65%) became pregnant 35 times (26 live birth, 7 abortions or miscarriage), age at the time of HDC ASCT was 14-20 yrs in 5, 21-30 in 13 and only one patient was 33 years. 4/19 pregnant patients used hormone assisted ovulation, 1/19 in-vitro fertilization, reaming 14 had normal pregnancy. Of remaining 27/62 PTBP single / not sexually active females, 19 (57%) are having periods (median age 26 years). For all 62 PTBP patients, so far 19 (31%) became pregnant and 48/62 (77%) are having regular periods. Conclusion: studies addressing the issues related to female fertility should properly defi ne selection criteria for these patients. High incidence of fertility / pregnancy is observed in PTBP population. Longer follow-up is likely to increase the incidence further. Background: Several studies have focused on the impact of pulmonary function tests (PFT) prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In contrast, data from serial evaluation of PFT's in transplant survivors are scarce. Objectives/methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the eff ect of Total Body Irradiation (TBI) on PFT. We evaluated 241 adult patients receiving a myeloablative transplant at our centre from January 2001 to December 2008. Patients surviving at least one year, and with a complete set of PFT's at 4 months, 7 months and one year were selected to analysis. Results: Seventy patients were included, transplant indications were: 22 ALL, 22 AML, 16 CML, 5 MDS and 5 SAA. Fifty patients received high dose TBI 1200 cGy (three fractions at 4 Gy), and 15 received none or TBI 200 cGy. Analysis of all patients revealed a highly signifi cant decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and haemoglobin corrected Diff usion Lung capacity for Carbon monoOxide (DLCOc) at all time points after transplantation. When patients were stratifi ed for high dose TBI versus low dose/ no TBI, only patients receiving high dose TBI had signifi cant, long term deterioration of FEV1, FVC and DCLOc, table 1. Stratifying for donor type (related/matched unrelated), age (<35 years/>35Years), chronic graft versus host disease (\u00b1) and disease (acute leukaemia/other) could not identify a subgroup free from impairment of pulmonary function. Conclusion: We conclude that TBI is detrimental to both short and long term pulmonary function in allogeneic transplant survivors.",

Salooja  Hammersmith Hospital (London, GB)    Survivors of haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) have an increased risk of developing endocrinopathies including hypothyroidism. In the normal population thyroid antibodies occur in 1-5% individuals who then have a 20% chance of developing hypothyroidism and require indefi nite follow up with annual thyroid function tests. The prevalence of antibodies in long term survivors of SCT is not known and nor is it clear whether the same relationship between antibodies and thyroid dysfunction applies to transplant survivors. In this study, we have investigated the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid antibodies in long term survivors of myeloablative HSCTs for haematological malignancies. Of 93 consecutive patients attending a dedicated adult haematology/endocrine clinic, data on thyroid antibodies were available for 72 patients. The median transplant-follow up interval was 18 years post SCT (range 8-29 years). All patients received TBI/Cyclophosphamide conditioning with a median dose of 12Gy (range 10-14Gy). 57 patients were transplanted for CML, 8 patients for AML, and 7 patients for ALL. The source of stem cells were sibling (n= 52), unrelated donor (n = 18) syngeneic (n = 2). Two patients received 2 allogeneic transplants in their treatment course. 17/72 patients (23%) developed biochemical hypothyroidism the majority of whom (64 of 72) were negative for thyroid antibodies. The median time to develop hypothyroidism was 13 years post SCT but the range was wide at 4.5 -24 years. 8 of 72 patients (9%) had thyroid antibodies, half of whom were euthyroid.",

Sivgin, S. Baldane, G. Akyol, M. Keklik, L. Kaynar, F. Kurnaz, C. Pala,  G. Zararsiz, M. Cetin, A. Unal, B. Eser  Erciyes University (Kayseri, TR)    Introduction: Iron overload (IO) has been shown to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). This study aimed to evaluate the eff ect of oral iron-chelation treatment (deferasirox) on survival in alloHSCT recipients in the posttransplant period. Materials and methods: A total of 80 alloHSCT recipients with IO were analyzed, retrospectively. Pretransplant and posttransplant data were obtained from the patients' fi les. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1; patients who received deferasirox treatment in the posttransplant period and Group 2; patients who did not receive any chelator treatment due to commerciall unavailability of the agent, side eff ects or compliance problems. Results: The median treatment duration with deferasirox was 122 days (min-max:91-225). The iron chelating treatment significantly reduced serum ferritin levels administered at a dosage of 20-30 mg/kg/day (p<0.001). The median OS in Group 1 wasfound 16.0 (min-max:1.0-63.0) months and 25.0 (min-max: 3.0-72.0) months in Group 2. In univariate and multivariate analysis, patients in Group 1 showed poorer OS compared to those in Group 2 with an increase in risk of death (HR:3.22, min-max: 1.67-6.23, p=0.001 and HR:3.51, min-max:1.75-6.99, p<0.001; respectively). The median DFS in Group 1 was found 11.0 (minmax:3.0-24.0) months and 22.0 (min-max:8.0-43.0) months in Group 2. The diff erence was found statistically signifi cant (p=0.023). Conclusion: Oral deferasirox (Exjade) treatment may improve survival in patients with iron overload who underwent alloHSCT. Kim, J.-H. Park, S. Park, J.-H. Moon, H.-J. Shin, J.-H. Lee for the Korean Society of Blood and Marrow TransplantationBackground: Secondary primary malignancy (SPM) is a rare but critical long-term complication after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Incidence and prevalence of cancer/SPM can be diff erent in terms of nation and age of patient. There are a few data for SPM in adult patients who had undergone autologous and allogeneic HCT in all types of underlying diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features of SPM. Methods: We retrospectively collected data for SPM after HCT among adult patients in Korea. SPMs were defi ned as any malignancy having occurred after the initial diagnosis and distinct from it. SPM was classifi ed into 4 categories; solid cancer, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), hematological cancer and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Results: Data were collected from 1637 patients over 15 years old who had undertaken HCT since 2000. Among them, allogeneic HCT was (n=1324, 80.9%). SPM was identifi ed in 35/1637 patients (2.1%). SPMs were developed mostly after allogeneic HCT (n=34, 97.1%). Age at SPM was 53.1 (19.6-66.6) years old. Median time from HCT to SPM was 12.2(1.0-139.3)  months. The cumulative incidence of 4 categories were 1.0% in solid cancers (n=16) 0.7% in PTLD (n=12), hematological cancers (14%) followed by MDS (6%). Most common solid cancers were head/neck cancers (14%), digestive tract cancers (9%), gynecological cancers (6%) and other solid cancers (17%). The cumulative incidence of SPM in subgroup analysis was follows: 2.6% in allogeneic HCT vs. 0.3% in autologous HCT; 2.6% in AML vs. 12.5% in PNH as original disease; 1.5% in sibling donor vs. 7.1% in family donor other than sibling vs. 3.0% in unrelated donor. The survival of PTLD was signifi cantly short among all categories of SPM. The median survival in all SPMs and PTLD were 20.4 (95% CI, 0.00-40.8) months and 7.8 (95% CI,",

Mohty on behalf of the SFGM-TCIntroduction: Allo-SCT remains the treatment of choice in relapsing AML patients (pts) who achieve a second complete remission (CR2) (Dohner, Blood, 2010). uCBT has been increasingly used as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells. Nevertheless, its role in patients with AML in CR2 in the absence of an HLAmatched donor has not been yet fully investigated. Patients and methods: This study describes the outcomes of 181 AML pts (93 males) transplanted in CR2 and reported to the SFGM-TC registry between 01/2005 and 06/2012. Pts received either auto-SCT (n=82) or uCBT (n=99) (37 single-unit and 62 doubleunits) following myeloablative conditioning regimen (n=21) or RIC (n=78). Results: The two groups were comparable in terms of gender (p=0.15) and median age at transplant [Auto: 48 years (range, 20-72) vs uCBT: 46 years (range: 19-69); p=0.32]. Despite a comparable median white blood count at diagnosis [Auto: 13 109/L (range: 0.4-120) vs uCBT: 18.3 109/L (range: 1.1-710), p=0.4], the Auto group showed a signifi cant better prognostic profi le at allo-SCT with more good-risk cytogenetics (45% vs 17%, p=0.for the Auto and the uCBT groups, respectively. 3-year OS, LFS, RI and NRM were 59\u00b16% vs 50\u00b16% (p=0.45); 57\u00b16% vs 46\u00b16% (p=0.37), 35\u00b16% vs 29\u00b15% (p=0.29) and 8\u00b13% vs 25\u00b15% (p=0.01), for the Auto and the uCBT groups, respectively.",

Outcomes of RIC HCT for AML pts over 50 years in complete remission (CR) using matched SIB, unrelated (URD) or umbilical cord blood (UCB) donors were compared. From 01/2000 to 12/2010, 197 consecutive pts (median age 59, range 50-74) received RIC and allogeneic HCT in 3 independent centers, either from SIB (n=82), HLA 8/8 matched URD (n=36) or UCB (n=80). SIB and URD received PBSC. Conditioning was fl udarabine-based (86%) and 79% received GvHD prophylaxis by CSA + MMF. 68% were in CR1; 6% of pts had good risk cytogenetics and 29% had poor risk (MRC classifi cation). Pts characteristics were similar between the 3 groups for age, gender, CR# and the interval from diagnosis to HCT. UCB recipients had more frequent high risk features (KPS<90%, female donor: male recipient and somewhat more high risk cytogenetics). Conditioning regimens using Fludarabine and low dose TBI were more frequent in UCB; Fludarabine and Busulfan (more in URD); and cytoxan plus low dose TBI (more in SIB) also diff ered between the 3 groups.

Coppola,  C. Bonini, C. Bordignon, C. Corti, J. Peccatori, M. Bernardi, F. Ciceri  San Raff aele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT)    Background: Understanding of leukemia biology and advances in the transplant fi eld have improved safety and access to S381 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients (pts) aff ected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The trend of growth of HCTs can be expected to continue based on acceptance and availability of alternative donor. Our policy is to off er a haploidentical HCT to pts lacking a matched donor in the appropriate time according to clinical indications (www.leukemianet.org, www.ebmt.org). Methods: Here we are reporting the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of HCT in all consecutive AML pts referred to our Institution between Jan-'04 and Apr-'12. Results: Indication to HCT was given to 241 pts (tab1), of note pts in 1st complete remission (CR1) are evenly distributed according to donor source (HLA-matched sibling donor -MSD, unrelated donor -URD, haploidentical related donor -haplo-HCT). HCT was performed in 201 pts (median time from diagnosis to HCT and from HCT-indication to HCT are 222 and 80 days). In ITT analysis, 83% of candidate pts received an HCT. The 3y overall survival (OS) analysis for pts transplanted in CR is 56%, for pts in morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) 21%, for pts in persistence of disease (PD) 11% (p<0.0001). The relapse incidence (RI) for pts in CR at 3y is 21%, for pts in MLFS 43%, for pts in PD 36% (p0.002). The 3y transplant related mortality (TRM) is 28% for CR pts, 44% for MLFS pts, 53% for PD pts (p<0.0001). For pts transplanted in CR, the 3yOS according to donor source (MSD, URD, haplo-HCT) is 57% vs 59% vs 53% (p ns) -fi g1; the 3y TRM is 37% vs 18% vs 28% (p ns); the 3y RI is 14% vs 23% vs 22% (p ns). For pts in CR1, the 3yOS according to donor source (MSD, URD, haplo-HCT) is 53% vs 73% vs 67% (p ns). TRM and RI are superimposable. For pts transplanted in PD, the 1y OS/TRM/RI according to donor source are superimposable, long term survivors are present only in haplo-setting (5yOS 10%). Comparison between relapsed vs refractory pts didn't show any diff erence. Conclusion: In high risk AML, HCT from a MSD provides the best chance for long-term survival. In our experience, the option of HCT for adults with AML is not limited to those pts with MSD thanks to the exploitation of an high-committed strategy of donor search and of haplo-HCT as alternative donor. So far Haplo-HCT, in comparison with MSD and URD, off ers equal outcome in any setting, noteworthy in CR1 and regardless of disease characteristics.",

There was no statistically signifi cant diff erence in the MRD techniques employed in predicting adverse outcomes. In the fi nal multivariate model both MRD and age were simultaneously signifi cant at p<0.05 level. Older age was associated with a 4% increase in the rate of mortality (HR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.00-1.07) while adjusting for the other factors. Unfavorable cytogenetics was associated with a 1.64 times greater rate of mortality (HR=1.64; 95% CI: 0.83-3.23).

Result: The hazard of death in favorable group of DFCI cytogenetic risk categorization was not signifi cantly lower than adverse group (HR=0.34; P=0.245), and in CIBMTR no death was observed in favorable group compared to adverse group. It was also signifi cantly lower in intermediate group compared to adverse group (HR=0.33; 95%CI ( 0.1,1.09); P=0.069) in CIBMTR but not signifi cantly in DFCI (HR=0.51; P=0.273). The hazard of relapse or death in favorable group of DFCI was not signifi cantly lower than adverse group (HR= 0.26; P=0.122), and in CIBMTR no death and relapse were observed in favorable group. It was also signifi cantly lower in intermediate group of CIBMTR than adverse group (HR= 0.27;95%CI:(0.1,0.77);P=0.014) but not signifi cantly lower in DFCI (HR=0.49; P=0.169).Cumulative incidence of relapse in DFCI one year after HSCT in favorable, intermediate and adverse groups was 9.1%,15.6% and 42.9%, respectively. In CIBMTR, it was 15.2% in intermediate and 60% in adverse group. Conclusion: For patients in favorable group of CIBMTR no relapse or death was observed after HSCT but not in DFCI.

Schwind  Uniklinikum Leipzig (Leipzig, DE)    Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is increasingly used in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (pts) ineligible for conventional conditioning receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). High BAALC, ERG & MN1 expression associate with worse outcome in AML pts treated with standard chemotherapy. Whether their expression also associates with outcome in AML pts undergoing RIC-HCT, with a therapeutic approach mainly based on a graft-versus-leukemia effect, remains unknown. We tested the prognostic impact of BAALC, ERG & MN1 expression in RIC-HCT treated AML pts. We analyzed 68 AML pts (median age, 61 years [y]; range 21-74y) who received RIC (Fludarabin 30 mg/ m 2 at day-4 to -2 & 2Gy total body irradiation day 0)-HCT at the University of Leipzig, with pretreatment bone marrow material available. Donors were human leucocyte antigene (HLA)-matched related (15%) or HLA-matched (68%) or mismatched (\u2265 1 antigen; 18%) unrelated. At HCT 82% of pts were in complete remission. 34% had acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD; \u2265 grade 2) & 80% (29% limited; 51% extensive) chronic GvHD (cGvHD). Median follow-up was 6.7y for pts alive.Medical research council (MRC) genetic classifi cation was: Favorable 8%, Intermediate 63%, Adverse 29%. Pts were characterized for NPM1 mutations.

While the choice of allogeneic HSCT is clear for the high risk group of patients, a question that still remains unanswered is how to treat patients in the intermediate or even low risk group? Apart from allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), available options include multiple consolidation chemotherapy courses and autologous HSCT. It is with that question in mind that we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients that received autologous HSCT as a part of treatment of AML in our Center during the period form 1988 until the end of 2012. A total of 221 AML patients were transplanted, data is available for 207 patients. Median age was 40.2 years (range 2-62).

Methods: The median age at time of SCT was 46 years with a range from 18 to 76 years. Conditioning therapy consisted of a myeloablative regimen (264/455 patients) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)(191/455 patients). In 397/455 peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were transplanted, 38 patients received bone marrow (BM), in 3 cases both were used, and in 17 patients a umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) was performed. Results: Patients were followed up with a median observation time of 27 months. Overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 37 %, with a median survival time of 25 months. Post-transplant relapse was documented in 134/455 patients, and 106 patients died due to the recurrence of AML resulting in a disease-free survival of 59 %. Acute Graft-vs-Host-Disease (GvHD) was documented in 177/360 patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis the EBMT score was a statistical signifi cant parameter for OS, as well as age and type of conditioning. Conclusions: Following our results, we conclude that for patients < 40 years allogeneic SCT with myeloablative conditioning is still the treatment of choice in AML patients in fi rst complete remission who are considered candidates for transplantation. For AML patients > 40 years RIC should be considered.

Patients: Between September 1989 and September 2010, 82 patients with Ph+ALL were transplanted in our institute. Seventeen patients (auto or second transplantation, RIST) was not included from this analysis. We reviewed in detail the clinical features of 65 patients.

Conclusion: Follow-up with FC for the detection of MRD in AML before and after SCT is useful for predicting relapse. In post-transplant setting, MRD+ by FC maybe useful to prevent relapse by preemtive intervention. The combination of multiple methods increases the detection of MDR.

Mean follow-up from HSCT was 10.9 years. Late eff ects were assessed and reported by physicians. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the occurrence of late eff ects according to conditioning regimen when adjusting for gender, age at HSCT, CNS irradiation, leukaemia type and time from HSCT to last visit. Quality of life was evaluated in 130 adults using SF-36 questionnaires and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the infl uence of conditioning regimen. The scores obtained were also compared to the French reference scores for age and sex. Patients developed fewer late complications after BU (2.35 vs 3.01, p=0 .03) while the risk to present with at least one complication was equivalent in both groups (87.9% after BU and 93.1% after TBI, p=0.68). Univariate analyses revealed that adverse eff ects on height were signifi cantly less common after a BU-based conditioning regimen (27.3% of patients vs 49.4 in the TBI group, p<0.01). Cataract, hypothyroidism and iron overload were also signifi cantly less frequent in the Although the numbers are small, we can conclude that the prevalence of thyroid antibodies is higher in these patients than in the normal population and that the presence of antibodies is associated with a high chance (50%) of developing hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism was common, however, irrespective of thyroid antibody status and new cases continue to occur more than 20 years after SCT. This highlights the need for indefi nite surveillance in all patients regardless of antibody status.",

Hong, C. Ki, H. Jung, J. Lee, S. Lim Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, KR) Introduction: With steadily growing number of long term survivors after allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT), late physiologic side eff ects are also increasingly reported in these patients. However, the incidence and the risk factors for post transplant late complications were rarely reported so far. Methods: Medical records of 634 post transplant long term survivors from 3 institutes in Seoul, Korea were retrospectively reviewed. Long term survivors were defi ned as those who were still alive at least 2 year after allo-HSCT. Results: The median age was 37 and AML was the most common disease (39.9%). Sibling donor was common (64.5%), and PB was more frequently used as a stem cell source (PB=51.5%; BM=48.6%). ATG was used in 33.3% of patients, 10.3% received TBI, and RIC transplantation comprised 35.6%. Acute GVHD and chronic GVHD occurred in 26.5% and 57.6% of patients. Among the endocrine dysfunction, hypothyroidism, gonadal failure, and adrenal insufficiency were observed with an incidence of 1.4%, 95.9% and 2.2%. In multivariate analysis, only TBI attained statistical signifi cance for hypothyroidism (HR=7.1) and adrenal insuffi ciency (HR=9.7). BO/BOS was the most common pulmonary complication (7%) and then the BOOP (2%) and interstitial pneumonitis (1%). PB source and cGHVD were the risk factors for lung complications in multivariate analysis (PB, HR=2.3; cGHVD, HR=7.9). Osteoporosis and avascular necrosis (AVN) were observed in 4.1% and 3.9% of patients. Female sex, age \u226540, and cGHVD were the signifi cant risk factors for osteoporosis in multivariate analysis with a HR of 9.6, 4.9 and 7.2, respectively. No use of ATG had signifi cance for AVN in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis. Among the long term survivors, 6.2% of patients experienced cataract; age \u226540, PB source, no use of ATG and cGHVD were signifi cant in univariate analysis, of which, only age \u226540 was signifi cant in multivariate analysis (HR=5.5). Nephropathy was observed in 7.4%, and male sex was the risk factor with a HR of 2.3. Cardiovascular diseases involving cardiomyopathy, CHF, arrhythmia and pericarditis were reported from 1.4% of patients, and unrelated donor was the risk factor in multivariate analysis (HR=12.1). Conclusion: This retrospective data showing the incidence and risk factors for late physiologic side eff ects could serve as a basis for optimal approach in long term survivors after allogeneic HSCT.",

This perspective, although informative, is inherently biased by studying only transplanted patients. We report herein the outcomes of ALL patients aged 50-70 years prospectively included and treated following consecutive PETH-EMA protocols (1999 -2010 . HCT was recommended for patients with Philadelphia + ALL and for slow responders. All patients who underwent HLA typing were considered as being HCT candidates (intention-to-treat approach). A total of 110 patients were eligible with a median age of 59 years (range 50-70) and a median follow-up for survivors of 51 months (range . Most common cytogenetics were t(9;22) (19%) and normal karyotype (19%) . HLA typing (HCT candidates) was performed in 55 (50%) patients. HCT candidates were younger (57 vs 62 years, p<0.001) and were more likely to be included in conventional protocols rather than in elderly/unfi t protocols (90% vs 67%, p=0.01). Among HCT candidates, 34 (61%) patients had an HLA identical sibling (donor group). Demographic and disease characteristics were similar to the no donor group (n=21, 39%). Eventually, 25 patients (45% of HCT candidates) underwent an allo-HCT, 21 with a fl udarabinebased reduced intensity conditioning and 4 with cyclophosphamide-TBI. Cyclosporine A with mycophenolate mophetil or short course methotrexate were used for GVHD prophylaxis. The complete remission (CR) rate was 83%, while 4-year overall survival (OS), leukemia free survival (LFS) and relapse risk (RR) for all patients were 28% (95%CI 23-32), 27% (95%CI [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and 53% (95%CI 46-59), respectively. In multivariate analysis the only factor associated with lower LFS was not achieving CR after induction therapy (p<0.001). The lack of an HLA identical sibling did not aff ect LFS (Fig.1) , OS (p=0.7) or RR (p=0.8). Among patients who achieved CR, those receiving an allo-HCT had higher LFS , p=0.06) and lower RR ], p=0.01) than non-HCT patients. 4-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and any grade of acute and chronic GVHD were 41%, 52% and 56%, respectively. In conclusion, only 50% of patients with ALL aged 50-70 years are considered potential candidates for HCT by their physicians. Although HCT is capable of achieving long-term remissions, having a related HLA identical donor is not associated with improved outcome in this population.",

Zeiser Freiburg University Medical Hospital (Freiburg, DE) Clinical trials in AML focus on patients achieving CR and most transplant centers require CR prior allogeneic transplantation, assuming that prognosis for patients transplanted with active disease is dismal. However, with older age the percentage of patients primary refractory to chemotherapy increases and without allogeneic transplantation the prognosis of these patients is fatal.Here we report on our 20 year long experience with 187 patients, (median age 57 years, 20-77) transplanted with primary refractory AML from related (n=61) or unrelated (n=126) donors. All patients failed prior chemotherapy and presented with median number of leukemic blasts in the marrow of 43% and in peripheral blood of 6%. Conditioning was mainly standard ablative Busulfan/ Cyclophosphamid based up to the age of 50 years and Fludarabin/ BCNU/ Melphalan in older or frail patients. GvHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin based with anti T-cell antibodies in unrelated or in elderly sibling transplants. PBSC was the preferred graft source. Of all evaluable patients only 7 did not achieve CR after transplantation. Median overall survival was 411 days with 35% patients surviving after 3 years and 20% patients being alive with a survival plateau 7 to 20 years after allotransplant. 133 patients died from relapse (n=87) or non relapse associated (n=50), mainly infections. Conclusion: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in primary refractory AML resulted in cure for 20% of the patients. Early donor search at initial diagnosis, adequate conditioning combined with PBSC and GVHD strategies including anti T-cell antibodies in patients with high risk off er cure in every 5th patient. Novel AML targeting drugs pre and post allotransplant as well as better antiinfections strategies in recent years are likely to improve these S387 results. Therapeutic nihilism for primary refractory AML patients is not warranted.",

Here we report the SCT data of a single center. 12/1995 to 12/2011 51 T-ALL pts underwent allo SCT, median age 31 years . 24 pts had prae-T-ALL, mature T-ALL (n=9), thymic T-ALL (n=17), unclassifi ed T-ALL (n=1). Stage of disease was CR1 in 28 pts (21 pts had prae-T or mature T-ALL, 7 pts with thymic ALL had leukocytes > 100.000 at diagnosis (1) , complex karyotype (1), delayed response (2) or molecular persistence/relapse (3) and were regarded as high risk. 23 pts were transplanted in CR2 or CR3 (8 and 3 pts) or with active disease (primary refractory n=2, 1. relapse n=9, 2. relapse n=1). Conditioning regimens were 12 Gy TBI + Cyclophosphamide or VP 16 (n=46), 8 Gy TBI (n=1) and FLU/BU in pts with contraindications against TBI (n = 4). Stem cell donors were related in 16 pts (HLA id. siblings n=13, mismatched family donors n=3) and unrelated in 35 pts (HLA id. in 29, mismatched in 6 pts) . ATG as GvHD prophylaxis was given in mismatched donor transplantation and from 2006 onwards in all unrelated SCT. Results: 19/51 pts are alive in CR, 1/19 pts after 2nd SCT after relapse. Median follow up of the surviving pts is 69 months . 32/51 pts are dead. Causes of death were leukemia in 14/32 pts and transplant related mortality (TRM), e.g. GvHD \u00b1 infection in 18/32 pts.Probability of survival (PoS) at 5 yrs for the whole group is 0.41. For all pts transplanted in CR1 (n=28) PoS at 5 yrs is 0.57 and for pts with prae-T and mature T-ALL (n=21) is 0.43, for pts transplanted beyond CR1 PoS at 5 yrs is 0.23. For pts with CR2 and CR3 or with active disease PoS at 5 yrs was not diff erent (0.24 vs. 0.22). The TRM was high (prob. at 5 years) in pts with CR1 0.27 and in pts > CR1 0.48. Prob. of relapse at 5 years was 0.28 for pts in CR1 and 0.56 in pts > CR1. In conclusion: In high risk T-ALL allo SCT is a curative therapy. The survival rate could be improved after 2005, when high resolution typing was done and ATG was given to all unrelated transplant recipients besides improved supportive care.",

Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) remains the main curative treatment for most cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the past decade, the development of reduced-toxicityconditioning regimens has decreased the transplantation-related morbidity and mortality. However, relapse after Allo-SCT remains a major issue and occurs in about 30% of patients transplanted for AML. To identify predictive factors of poor outcome after All-SCT in the specifi c setting of AML is a key issue to stratify patients and to develop specifi c risk-adapted strategies. To assess factors infl uencing relapse incidence (RI), we retrospectively analyzed 263 consecutive patients with AML who underwent Allo-SCT at the Institut Paoli Calmettes from 2000 to 2012. Median age was 50 . Matched related donor, unrelated donor, cord blood unit and haploidentical donor were used in 145 (55%), 73 (28%),",

Among 70/160 IK patients with FLT3 mutational status available, 26/70 (37%) carried a FLT3-ITD. Median follow up was 37 months . We identifi ed in univariate analyses that no CR at the time of Allo-SCT, UK and FLT3-ITD (in IK patients) were associated with high RI. No diff erence was found between patients who received RIC or myeloablative regimens. To assess a stratifi cation model with these relevant adverse factors, we performed a step by step partitioning analysis on 186 patients (77 patients excluded for missing FLT3 status or cytogenetic; referred patients or treated before 2006) and found 3 risk groups ( Figure  1 ): Very high risk (VHR, n=40) (patients in no CR at the time of Allo-SCT); High risk (HR, n=79) (patients with UK or IK FLT3-ITD, transplanted in CR); Standard risk (SR, n=67) (patients with IK FLT3-WT or FK, transplanted in CR). RI at 2 years was 17%, 38% and 53% in the SR, HR and VHR respectively (p<0.001) ( Figure 2 ). This translated in survival stratifi cation with 2-year progression-free survival of 68%, 41% and 27% (p<0.001) and 2-year overall survival of 75%, 52% and 33% (p<0.001) in SR, HR and VHR respectively. We conclude that this AML-specifi c stratifi cation model predicts RI and survival after Allo-SCT. It could be useful to conduct risk-adapted strategy in further trials.

Arnold (1) (1)Charite Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin (Berlin, DE); (2)Klinikum G\u00fctersloh (G\u00fctersloh, DE) Purpose: Failure to achieve early blast clearance (i.e. at day +16) following the fi rst course of induction chemotherapy is an important predictor for long-term disease control in patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the impact of early blast clearance on the overall outcome of patients (pts) with AML undergoing alloSCT in fi rst complete remission (CR1) after either reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) or standard myeloablative conditioning (MAC). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 169 pts (median age 47 (range: 17-69) years) with AML who underwent alloSCT in CR1 from a matched-related (82 pts, 49%) or an unrelated donor (85 pts, 51%) at our center between 1994 and 2011. Cytogenetic risk was either favorable (6 pts, 4%), intermediate (104 pts, 62%), or poor (47 pts, 27%). Prior to alloSCT all pts were treated in a German multicenter AML trial and received at least two courses of induction chemotherapy, i.e. either standard \"7+3\" or a \"high-dose Ara-C\" containing regimen (Ara-C 1-3 g/m2). In 98 pts (58%) early blast clearance was achieved, whereas 71 pts (42%) entered remission after a subsequent induction course. In 146 pts (86%) peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were used, whereas 23 pts (14%) received bone marrow (BM). Conditioning consisted of standard myeloablative conditioning (6x2 Gy TBI and 2x60 mg/m2 CY) in 81 pts (48%), whereas 86 pts (52%) received reduced intensity conditioning (BU 2x4 mg/kg, FLU 6x30 mg/m2, ATG 4x10 mg/kg). Results: After a median follow-up of 45 (range: months, 91 pts (54%) are alive and in CR. Causes of death were relapse in 38 pts (22%) or NRM in 33 pts (19%). At 1, 3 or 5 years projected overall survival (OS) was 72\u00b16%, 58\u00b16%, or 54\u00b18% for all pts. Probability of relapse or non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 1, 3, and 5 years was 20\u00b110% (20\u00b111%), 31\u00b112% (20\u00b111%), and 34\u00b112% (20\u00b111%). Pts who achieved early blast clearance as compared to pts who failed to do so (p=0.09), disease-free survival (DFS) and probability of relapse diff ered signifi cantly between the two groups at 3 years (77\u00b18% vs 55\u00b114%) or 5 years (75%\u00b19% vs 52%\u00b114%) (p=0.02). There was no signifi cant diff erence in NRM. Likewise, there was no statistically signifi cant diff erence between pts conditioned with either MAC or RIC. Conclusions: Early blast clearance following the fi rst course of induction chemotherapy predicts a very favorable outcome in pts with AML undergoing alloSCT in CR1.",

Olioso (2) Introduction: For patients with high-risk AML a family donor represents the ideal source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplant. Herein, we report results of unmanipulated, G-CSF primed, haploidentical BMT in high-risk AML patients lacking an HLA identical sibling. Materials and methods: Between January 2006 and October 2012, 48 patients (median age: 44 yrs, range 5-66) with high-risk AML (CR1=29; CR2=11; advanced stage=8) underwent BMT from haploidentical donor in 2 transplant Centers (Rome: n=32; Pescara: n=16). For patients grafted in CR1, AML was refractory (n=8), secondary (n=9), with cytogenetic-molecular high-risk characteristics (n=10) or MRD positive after consolidation (n=2). All patients were prepared with a myeloablative (MAC) or a reduced intensity (RIC) conditioning regimen consisting of Thiotepa at days -7 and -6 i.v. Busulfan combined with Fludarabine at days -5, -4 and -3 (TBF-MAC: n=33). In the TBF-RIC (n=15), one dose of Thiotepa and one dose of Busulfan were omitted. All patients received an identical GvHD prophylaxis. Donors were primed with G-CSF at 4 mcg/Kg/ day for 7 days. BM was infused unmanipulated. Results: The median number of CD34+ and CD3+ cells infused was 2 (0.7-11) and 30 (9-170)x10 6 /Kg, respectively. Two patients died early after transplant and engraftment was reached at a median Results: The probability of OS and DFS at 3 years after HSCT were 40.1% and 38%, respectively. Table1 shows the result of risk factor analysis for OS and DFS among all 65 patients. In univariate analysis, hematological status (CR and non CR), the days from the diagnosis to the transplant, the number of WBC at diagnosis were the factors to infl uence OS and DFS. In multivariate analysis, the factor to infl uence OS and DFS was gender and hematological status. By the uni-and multivariate analysis, the hematological status was only associated with unfavorable OS. We analyzed the risk factor for OS and DFS among 51 patients with CR. In univariate analysis, the number of WBC at diagnosis was the factors to infl uence OS and DFS. In multivariate analysis, the factor to infl uence OS and DFS was gender, the number of WBC at diagnosis and the source of stem cells. Twenty one patients relapsed after HSCT with a median of 207 days (range : 19-1324 days). The estimated cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years was 39.4%. Patients with CR showed lower relapse rate (34.2%) compared with patients with non CR (62.7%) at 5 years. The treatment after the relapse was chemotherapy with TKI : 7 patients, without TKI:13 patients, respectively. Four patients received the second HSCT. Two patients survived and 19 patients died. Among 19 patients, the main cause of the death was recurrence (15 patients).",

Uhlin (3) In this single center study we evaluated risk factors for relapse in 476 patients with acute leukemia undergoing HSCT between 1995 and 2012. AML was the underlying diagnosis in 295 patients and 181 had ALL. Median age of the patients was 33 (0.5-69) years. HLA-identical sibling donor (SIB ) was used in 173 patients, matched unrelated donor (MUD) in 237 and mismatched graft (MM) in 66 patients. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 381 patients and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in 95 patients. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA +MTX in the majority of patients. Transplant related mortality (TRM) at one year was 15%. Acute GVHD grades I-II was diagnosed in 281(59%) patients and 37(8%) had grades III-IV. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was diagnosed in 150(35%) patients. Leukemia relapse occurred in 176 patients (37%), hematological relapse in 156 and molecular in 20 patients. In patients with early disease relapse was diagnosed in 32% compared to 44% in patients with late disease (p=0.01). In patients with grade I aGVHD relapse incidence was 38%, grade II 30% and grade III-IV 12% (p<0.001). The risk of relapse was 25% compared to 46% in patients with or without cGVHD (p<0.001). The overall survival (OS) was 74% in patients without relapse and 77% in patients with molecular relapse compared to 22% in patients with hematological relapse (p<0.001). Patients with a SIB donor had a relapse-free survival (RFS) of 59%, 42% for MUD and 26% for patients with MM donor (p<0.001). RFS was 53% for patients with aGVHD grade I compared to 29% in patients with aGVHD grade III at 5 years. Patients with a blood stream infection (BSI) had an overall survival of 40% at 5 years compared to 64% for those without a BSI (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis for relapse late disease (p<0.01) and RIC (p=0.025) were associated with an increased risk and chronic (p<0.001) and acute GVHD (p=0.006) with a decreased risk. For survival early disease (p<0.001), cGVHD (p<0.001) and no BSI (p<0.001) were associated with a prolonged survival and aGVHD grades III-IV with a decreased survival (p<0.001).In conclusion, acute and chronic GVHD was signifi cantly correlated to less relapse whereas late disease and the use of RIC signifi cantly increased the risk. Interestingly patients with molecular relapse showed a comparable survival to patients without relapse. Early disease, cGVHD and no BSI was signifi cantly correlated to improved survival and severe GVHD with a decreased survival.",

Aim of the study: To evaluate outcomes in newly diagnosed patients, younger than 66, who achieved complete remission (CR) after induction/consolidation therapy at the Divisions of Hematology at Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza, Universit\u00e0 di Torino, Torino, Italy, between 2000 were consecutively diagnosed and stratifi ed by risk as follows: low risk included presence of t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16); high risk features included WBC>50.000/uL at diagnosis, secondary leukemia, presence of extramedullary AML, complex karyotype, chromosomal monosomy, no remission after induction, and FLT3/ MLL mutations (since 2004). Intermediate risk included patients who did not meet either low or high risk criteria. Moreover, the standard risk group included low+intermediate risk patients. Patients were treated according to Center guidelines or on clinical trials active at the time of diagnosis. All high risk patients were considered for an allograft since diagnosis Results After induction/consolidation, 229/302 patients (76%) achieved complete remission: 16/229 (7%) were at low, 54/229 (24%) at intermediate, and 159/229 (69%) at high risk respectively. Eighty/159 (50%) high risk patients received an allograft as 1st line treatment; 56% from a HLA-matched sibling, 42% from an unrelated donor and 2% received a haplo-identical transplant. Seventy-nine/159 (50%) did not receive an allograft primarily because of failure to fi nd a suitable donor either sibling or unrelated. At median follow-ups of 53 months from induction therapy and 49 months from achieving CR, 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year event free survival (EFS) of the entire patient cohort were 45% and 35% respectively. By risk category, standard risk patients showed a 5-year OS of 56% and high risk patients of 40% (p=0.008). Five-year EFS was 37 and 34% in standard and high risk patients respectively (p=0.194). High risk patients who underwent an allograft up-front showed a 5-year OS of 53% and showed a statistically signifi cant advantage as compared with those who did not receive a transplant (p=0.018). Conclusion: Allografting plays a pivotal role in OS and EFS for high risk acute myeloid leukemia. The lack of a donor is associated with bad clinical outcomes. Prospective clinical trials designed to evaluate the use of more readily available donors such as haploidentical siblings or parents are needed.",

Elez, B. Balint, O. Tarabar, S. Marjanovic, Z. Tatomirovic, M. Strnad, O. Tasic Radic, M. Malesevic, Lj. Tukic Military Medical Academy (Belgrade, RS) Background: Several factors such as patient age, immunophenotype and clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features of the disease are predictors for treatment outcome in patients (pts) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Adolescents and young adults with ALL still have lower rates of survival than younger children. Majority of reports published so far indicate that these pts have a better outcome when treated with pediatric, rather than adult therapeutic protocols. Role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in fi rst complete remission (CR) in this particular cohort of pts is still controversial. Aim: Analysis of treatment outcome in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 30 years with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated in our adult hematology department either with conventional approach or allogeneic SCT. Patients and methods: Since 1989 till 2012. a total of 90 pts, male/ female 58/32, aged 15 to 30 (average age 20), with newly diagnosed ALL were treated with adult chemotherapy protocol and allogeneic SCT. In the postremission setting, pts were divided in two gruops: with \"donor\" (40 pts) in whom we have performed allogeneic SCT in CR1 from idenstical sibling and with \"no donor\" (50 pts) who were treated with conventional maintenance therapy. With respect to disease risk parameters (standard vs. high risk), age (15-18 vs. 19-30) , white blood count (>30x109/l vs. <30x109/ l), time to achieve remission (below 28 days vs. above 28 days) groups \"donor\" vs. \"no donor\" did not diff er. Results: For the whole cohort, the remission rate was 91,4%, iduction failure 8,6%, early deaths 3,4% and relapse rate 55,1%. After a median observation time of 9 years the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of pts who were treated with allogeneic SCT in CR1 were superior in comparisson to pts who were treated with conventional therapy (OS 43,2% vs. 25,3%, p < 0.05; DFS 54,1% vs.28,7%, p < 0.05). Relapse incidence was signifi cantly lower in the group of pts with allogeneic SCT (32,1% vs 67,3%, p < 0.05). Signifi cantly better OS had pts with initial lower white blood count and those who have achieved remission in the fi rst 28 days. In this cohort of pts age had no impact on the results. Conclusion: Allogeneic SCT in CR1 is superior treatment option for adolescents and young adults with ALL in comparisson to conventional adult chemotherapy protocol, but further investigation, especially in the new target agents era is needed.",

Diez-Martin Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1on (Madrid, ES) Aim: To study the prognosis impact of minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis by fl ow cytometry (FC) for the follow-up of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) before and after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: From January 2008 to August 2011 all ps with a diagnosis of AML who underwent allo-SCT were analyzed. MRD was studied at bone marrow (BM) by 4-color multiparametric FC with a Cytomics FC.500 fl ow cytometer. FC was performed at the pretransplant moment and at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 after SCT. The CXP acquisition program was used for acquisition with a gating strategy and INFINICYT software (Cytognos) was used for data analysis. We also collected information about molecular techniques (WT1, NPM) karyotype and chimerism. Regarding FC, only pts who had 2 or more leukemic aberrant phenotypes (LAIPs) at the time of diagnosis were analyzed. MRD was considered negative when it was lower than 0.1%. The relationship between MRD, and clinical evolution was described. Results: 35 pts were included; features are described in table 1. 28 of the pts had LAIPs at diagnosis, (5 missing data at diagnosis and 2 had no LAIPs). Of the 28 pts: 13 pts had less than 3 LAIPs, 13 had 4 or 5 LAIPs, and 2 had 5 or more LAIPs; 19 pts (68%) went to transplant with MRD-and 9 (32%) with MRD+. Patients MRDby FC who underwent transplantation had lower rates of relapse (12% vs 48%) and better survival (15% vs. 46%) one year posttransplant (p: \u22640.05) compared with patients with MRD+. One year after transplant 2 pts had MRD+ and 17 MRD-(9 losses), for a cut value of 0.1, the area under the ROC curve for FC to predict relapse was 0.85 (IC: 0.61-1). Of 11 pts (1 missing by persistent MRD+) with MRD+: 6 were detected by FC and molecular techniques at the same time and 2 were detected by FC fi rst. In Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic anemia which is eff ectively controlled with eculizumab. We hypothesized residual intravascular hemolysis under treatment may be due to incomplete C5 blockage. From October 2010 to February 2012, 22 pts (7 male, median age 42 years range 21 to 72) with hemolytic PNH treated with eculizumab (900 mg intravenously every 14\u00b12 days) were prospectively followed 22 patients proceeded to salvage allografting, 7 of these with refractory disease prior to alloSCT. With a follow-up of 34 months (14-95), 12 allografted patients live disease-free, translating into a PFS of 61% at 3 years after alloSCT. In contrast, all 7 patients who received a salvage autoSCT relapsed and died, and only 3 of the 29 patients not eligible for SCT salvage survived, none of them with sustained disease control (Fig) . Conclusions: In patients with ALK-PTCL scheduled for primary autoSCT, transplantation is feasible only in a limited fraction of patients. A signifi cant benefi t of 1st-line autoSCT over non-transplant induction remains to be shown. More than two thirds of all patients will fail after 1st-line treatment and have a very poor outlook if salvage alloSCT cannot be performed.",

(Porto, PT) Background: Reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIC-HSCT) has been used in refractory or relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) as an alternative to myeloablative transplantation. Disease status at HSCT is an important factor that has emerged as a predictor of outcome. The aim of this study was to describe our experience with RIC-HSCT in refractory or relapsed FL and to identify predictive factors for the outcome. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of patients (pts) with refractory or relapsed FL submitted to RIC-HSCT from September 2000 until October 2010. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed by Kaplan-Meier method. Predictive factors of relapse/progression and prognostic factors in PFS and OS were identifi ed by chi-square and log rank tests. Results: Thirty-two pts were submitted to RIC-HSCT. Median age was 48 years old [33;62] and 60% were male. At diagnosis, 62% of pts were in stage IV and 60% had extra-nodal disease. At HSCT, 31% had performed > 2 therapy lines and 53% of pts were in complete remission (CR). Median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 35 months [14;174]. All pts received grafts from an HLA-identical sibling and the conditioning regimen was fl udarabine and busulfan. Median CD34 dose was 6 x10 6 /Kg [2;12] . Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Incidence of acute and chronic GvHD was 19% and 59% respectively. After HSCT, CR was possible in 72% of pts. Five pts had progressive disease (PD) and one relapsed. Four pts received donor lymphocyte infusion (PD: 3; loss of chimerism: 1).With a median follow-up of 60 months [21;135] , 20 pts are alive and without evidence of disease. Four pts died (extensive-type chronic GVHD: 2; PD: 2). A secondary neoplasm occurred in one patient (squamous cell carcinoma of the lip, 9 years after HSCT). The estimated 5-year and 10-year PFS and OS are 79% and 85% respectively. CR at the time of HSCT and after allografting were identifi ed as factors with impact on relapse/progression, PFS and OS (p<0.05). There was a trend to a better OS in pts submitted to rituximab therapy before HSCT, although without statistical signifi cance (p=0.06). Conclusion: Our data confi rm that RIC-HSCT has the potential to induce long term remissions and eventually cure some pts with refractory or relapsed FL. CR at the time and after HSCT was an important predictive factor for the outcome.",

However, outcome in non-remission pts is still poor. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the feasibility of a protocol using the concept of sequential therapy with clofarabine as induction chemotherapy followed by haploidentical HSCT. Methods: Since March 2010 ten adult pts (6 male, median age: 56 years) with MCL (n=5), transformed CLL (n=2) or DLCL (n=3) were included. All pts were classifi ed as high risk according to the age-adjusted IPI. Four pts were primary refractory and 6 pts had relapsed after autologous HSCT. The mean number of prior chemotherapy regimens was fi ve. After a rituximab (n=8) or ofatumumab (n=2) containing salvage chemotherapy prior to HSCT a partial remission (PR) or stable disease was achieved in 3 and 2 pts, respectively. Five pts had progressive disease. Chemotherapy with clofarabine (5x30 mg/m2 IV) was followed -after three days of rest-by a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen consisting of fl udarabin/cyclophosphamide (Flu/Cy) plus either melphalan 110 mg/m2 IV (n=9) or TBI 2 Gy (n=1). High-dose Cy post-transplant was applied for post-grafting immuno-suppression. Results: Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was achieved in 9/10 and 8/10 pts within a median of 21 and 31 days. No primary graft rejection and only one early death were observed. Complete remission (n=4) and PR (n=3) could be induced by day +100 in 7/10 pts. Full donor chimerism by day +100 was achieved in 7/10 pts. After a median follow up of 6 month (range 3-27) the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at day +100 was 10%. Rate of grade II-IV acute GvHD was 40%. Exceptionally mild chronic GVHD was seen in 4 pts. Three pts died from infection (n=1), toxicity (n=1) or relapse (n=1). Accordingly, overall survival and progression free survival after one year from haploidentical transplantation were both 70%. Regimen related grade III-IV toxicity (non-hematologic) was reported in 5/10 pts with mucositis and transient elevation of transaminases as the most common seen toxicities. Conclusion: Haploidentical HSCT following initial induction with clofarabine, RIC and high-dose Cy post-transplant is feasible with an acceptable toxicity profi le in patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma. Our preliminary results are promising, but long-term results are required.",

Uotinen, T. Ruutu, L. Volin Helsinki University Central Hospital (Helsinki, FI) The use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in lymphoma has been limited by high transplant-related mortality (TRM) in heavily pre-treated patients. However, the potentially curative graft-versus-lymphoma eff ect is well established, and TRM can be reduced with less toxic conditioning. We report our single centre experience of 35 patients treated with allogeneic SCT using treosulfan-based conditioning since the year 2001, showing low TRM and a good relapse-free survival (RFS). The median age of the patients was 47 (range 19-63) years. The diagnoses were mantle cell lymphoma 9, Hodgkin's disease 8, follicular lymphoma 7, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 6, T-cell lymphoma 3, Waldenstrom's disease 1, and small B-cell lymphoma 1. The conditioning consisted of treosulfan 42 g/m 2 (10 patients) or 30 -36 g/m 2 (25 patients)We present the analysis of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma which summarizes the results of all transplant centers in the Czech Republic. In the period from june 1998 to june 2011, overall 45 patients (pts) were transplanted; 23 men / 22 women, median age was 31.5 years (range; 10.5-56.2) . As a graft, PBPC were used in 37 (82%) pts, thirty-six (80%) pts were transplanted after RIC, thirty-one pts (70%) were transplanted from an unrelated donor. Thirty-nine pts (87%) were previously treated with autologous transplant. At time of allo-SCT, twenty-one (47%) pts had chemoresistant disease. The median time from diagnosis to allo-SCT was 44 months ( range; 14-144), the majority (93%) of allo-SCT were performed after 2000. Median follow-up was 17 months (range; 1-125) for all patients and 70 months (range;14-125) for survivors. All but one patient engrafted, the median time to neutrophils engraftment was 15 days (range; 8-31). Acute GVHD grade 1-2 developed in 7 cases, grade 3-4 in 7 cases. Overall incidence was 33%. Thirty-seven patients could be evaluated for chronic GVHD and its incidence was 49% (18 patients; eight had extensive and ten had limited form). Twenty-fi ve (56%) patients relapsed after a median time of 13 months (range; 3-50), ten out of them were treated with DLI. At the last follow-up, fi fteen pts (33%) were alive, thirty pts (67%) died: seven (16%) of NRM and 23 (51%) of disease progression. Estimated 3-and 5-years OS and PFS were 42% and 30% and 23% and 16%, respectively. Median survival was 22 months. Cumulative incidence of NRM was 7%, 21% and 21% at 100 days, 3 years and 5 years resp. Cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years was 32%, 69% and 79% resp. OS after relapse was signifi cantly better for pts receiving DLI (median survival 29 vs 6,5 months, p= 0.048), moreover OS of relapsed pts treated with DLI was comparable with pts who never relapsed. Conclusion: Despite the fact that this is an unfavourable prognostic group of heavily pretreated patients, a third of them are longterm survivors. Undoubtedly, the main problem of allo-SCT failure is disease recurrence. Optimal timing, and the eff ort to achieve maximum of GVL eff ect using DLI provide the possibilities of further improvement of allo-SCT outcomes.

Some metaanalysis demonstrate that pegylated fi lgrastim is more eff ective than fi lgrastim in reducing chemotherapy induced neutropenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pegfi lgrastim (PEG-G-CSF) administration on haematopoietic reconstitution and supportive care in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies after autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (autoPBSCT). We analyzed 139 patients including 61 with multiple myeloma, 38 with Hodgkin's lymphoma and 40 with non-Hodgkin's lymohoma. Patients received a single 6 mg dose of PEG-G-CSF on day +1 after transplantation (n=39) or fi lgrastim (n=70) at a dose 5 \u03bcg/kg/d on day +1 posttransplant and continued to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)>1,5x109/L. The median consumption of fi lgrastim vials a 0,3 mg was 19 (range 1-30). The control group consisted of 30 patients who did not receive G-CSF. The median time to ANC>0,5x109/L was signifi cantly shorter in PEG-G-CSF group than in the control group (10 vs 15 days, p<0,0001) and also between patients receiving fi lgrastim and control (11 vs 15, p<0,0001). We did not fi nd diff erences in time to ANC recovery between PEG-G-CSF and fi lgrastim groups. There was also diff erence in the median time to platelet engraftment (PLT>20 x 109/L), which was signifi cantly shorter in control compared to groups receiving fi lgrastim (12 vs 13 days, p=0,04). The median number of platelet transfusions in PEG-G-CSF, fi lgrastim and control group was 12 vs 15 vs 5 units, respectively. The diff erence was signifi cant between PEG-G-CSF and control (p=0,001) and between fi lgrastim and control (p=0,001). No statistical diff erences in the number of red blood cells transfusions and duration of febrile neutropenia were seen between all groups. The length of hospitalization was signifi cantly shorter in patients receiving PEG-G-CSF compared to fi lgrastim (30 vs 37 days, p<0,0001) but longer relative to control group (30 vs 28 days, p=0,047). PEG-G-CSF signifi cantly reduce the duration of severe neutropenia but has no impact on the time of hospitalization in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies after autoPBSCT. According to the median number of G-CSF vials used, PEG-G-CSF administration may be more cost eff ective compared to fi lgrastim (1 vs 19 vials). Our study support some previous observations that use of G-CSF can delay platelets recovery. (1) Hematologic malignancy currently represents the main indication for HSCT. Clearly, autologous and allogeneic HSCT are established therapies in many of hematologic malignancies. High dose therapy (HDT) supported by autologous HSCT are the preferred choice for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Between Jan 2004 and Nov 2011, 68 patients with diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HD) underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in our center in Shiraz University of with medical sciences. Patients were treated by intensive chemotherapy followed by reinfusion of non-cryopreserved autologous stem cells. The pretransplant conditioning chemotherapy regimen was CEAM (lomustin150-200mg/m2, etoposide 1000mg/ m2, cytarabine 1000-1200mg/m2 and melphalan 140mg/m2). All apheresis products were kept in a conventional blood bank refrigerator at 4\u00b0C for 3 days before infusion. During 7 years 68 patients with relapsed or refractory HD, underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Median age of patients was 28 years (range; 16-50). The median time to platelet count > 20\u00d7109/L was 15 days (range; 9-35). The median time to ANC > 0.5\u00d7109/L was 12 days (range; 8-27). All patients have engrafted and there were not graft failure in this study group. 100 days transplant related mortality rate was 2.9%. The mean number of MNCs collected and transfused was 3.8 \u00d7 108/kg (range, 1.9 \u00d7 108-9 \u00d7 108/kg). All patients in our study showed hematopoietic engraftment after receiving the CEAM conditioning regimen, with neutrophil and platelet recovery times comparable to those reported for most carmustine-based regimens.Our data refl ects the important role of HDT followed by HSCT in improvement of outcome for a Hodgkin's lymphoma patients of in our center. We concluded high dose therapy with this modifi ed conditioning regimen rescued with non-cryopreserved auto SCT is safe and eff ective method that is feasible in our patients. The eff ectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as a frontline treatment in peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) is still unclear. We retrospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of HDT/ASCT as an intensifying frontline treatment in 31 patients with newly diagnosed PTCLs. The conditioning regimen of HDT/ASCT consisted of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (BuCyE). At diagnosis, fi ve (16.1%) patients were classifi ed as high risk according to the prognostic index for PTCL (PIT). The disease status of the patients before HDT/ASCT consisted of 23 patients (74.2%) with complete response (CR) and eight patients (25.8%) with partial response (PR). Six (75%) out of eight patients with PR at pretransplantation were improved in terms of the response to CR after HDT/ASCT. At a median follow-up of 32.4 months, the three-year probability of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 64.5 \u00b1 8.6%. Transplant-related mortality occurred in three patients (9.7%), due to septic shock, hemorrhage and delayed pneumonia respectively. Bone marrow involvement of PTCL at diagnosis was a poor prognostic factor for OS. In conclusion, frontline HDT/ASCT with a conditioning regimen of BuCyE may be an eff ective and tolerable intensifying therapeutic option to improve outcomes in patients with PTCLs.",

Martin, L. Ya\u00f1ez, A. Bermudez, C. Richard, E. Conde, A. Insunza Hospital Marques de Valdecilla (Santander, ES) Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an alternative therapy for patients with relapsed lymphoma, but the role of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning before allogeneic SCT is uncertain. Objective: To investigate whether disease status evaluated by PET before reduced intensity allogeneic SCT predicted outcome. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 33 patients transplanted between 2004 and June 2012. Twenty-two were male and median age was 46 years (IQL, 36-55). The diagnoses were Hodgkin lymphoma (n=15), diff use large B-cell lymphoma (n=5), follicular lymphoma (n=3), transformed follicular lymphoma (n=3), mantle cell lymphoma (n=3), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (n=3) and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (n=1). Eighteen patients underwent HLA-matched sibling donor transplantation, 8 matched unrelated donor transplantation, 6 mismatched unrelated donor transplantation and 1 haploidentical transplantation. Except in 3 patients, fl udarabine (160 mg/m2) and melfalan (70 mg/m2) was used as the conditioning regimen. Controlled disease was defi ned by a negative PET or a unique area of weakly human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. FACS-sorted and cloned GFP+ cells displayed a constitutive and specifi c downregulation of HSP105, as the expression of the two major molecular chaperones, HSP90 and HSP70, was not aff ected. Despite no increase in cell death, the two best-silenced clones showed a signifi cant reduction in their in vitro proliferation rate due to a signifi cant extension in their doubling time (P= 0.04, < 0.001, and P= 0.03, 0.001). Accordingly, the tumour-forming capability of these clones, subcutaneously injected into severe combined immunodefi cient mice, was signifi cantly hampered compared with that of the MOCK-infected cells (P= 0.0009, 0.019), to the point of the complete loss of tumorigenicity when 10 4 HSP105silenced cells were inoculated (Fig 1) . Western blot analysis of 6 silenced clones showed that BCL-6 and c-Myc were both downmodulated in function of HSP105 knockdown levels. In two diff erent aggressive B-NHL cell lines, HSP105 co-immunoprecipitated with BCL-6 and c-Myc, suggesting that it may favour the stabilization of these oncoproteins. Along this line, immunohistochemistry analysis of 50 primary human aggressive B-NHLs revealed that HSP105 expression is signifi cantly higher in c-Myc+ Burkitt's (P= 0.0264) or BCL-6+ diff use large B-cell lymphomas (P= 0.0068) than in other aggressive histotypes that do not overexpress these oncoproteins. In addition, we found a signifi cant positive correlation between HSP105 and BCL-6 expression in these cases (Pearson r= 0.8537, P< 0.0001). Conclusions: Overall, these results point to HSP105 as a per se non-oncogenic molecule that can contributes to lymphomagenesis by fostering the expression of key oncoproteins. They equally provide the rationale for developing HSP105 inhibitors as a new strategy to improve the treatment of aggressive B-NHLs.",

Sadek (2) High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered the gold standard of care for patients (pts) with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in chemosensitive relapse. In spite of this consideration, the pts autotransplanted after multiple relapses have poorer long-term outcome than those autotransplanted after a fi rst chemo-sensitive relapse. Between June, 2000 and June 2011, 35 consecutive pts with HL in chemo-sensitive relapse underwent ASCT. Median age at ASCT was 33 years (y) (18-57). There were 26 males and 9 females. All the pts received a fi rst line chemotherapy (CT) which was combined to radiotherapy in 15 pts. First line CT was ABVD in 33 pts, BEA-COPP in one patient (pt), and MOPP in one pt. Among the 35 pts, 27 underwent ASCT in fi rst chemo-sensitive relapse (2ndCR/PR) after one line of salvage CT which was ICE in 25 pts and DHAP in 2pts. Eight pts underwent ASCT after subsequent chemosensitive relapses including 7 after 2 relapses (in 3rd CR/PR) and one after 3 relapses (in 4th PR). High-dose CT consisted in BEAM protocol (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan). Source of transplant was peripheral stem cells in all the pts. Median follow-up was 40 months. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 10y were 60% and 57%, respectively. There was no signifi cant diff erence in DFS and OS at 10y between the two groups of pts undergoing ASCT after a fi rst and subsequent sensitive relapses. Disease-free survival rates at 10y were 55.4% and 55.6% for pts autotransplanted in fi rst and subsequent sensitive relapses, respectively (p=0.933) (fi g 1), and OS rates at 10y were 58% and 66%, respectively (p=0.51)(fi g2).This study conducted in a developing country showed that if ASCT for HL in sensitive relapse is not feasible after the fi rst relapse for non medical reason, it could be performed after subsequent sensitive relapses with no diff erence in long-term outcome.",

Ibrahim, M. El-Saifi , O. Chamdine, G. Nsouli, J. Makdissi, R. Jalloul, L. Khayat, M. Ha\u00efdar, S. Faddoul, F. Kamar, T. Jisr, A. Mugharbil Makassed Hospital (Beirut, LB) Between January, 2000 and December, 2011, 53 consecutive patients (pts) with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) sensitive to salvage therapy after a primary refractory status (18pts) or after relapse (35 pts) underwent high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Median age at ASCT was 33 years (y) (18-57). There were 35 males and 18 females. Among the 18 S434 primary refractory pts, 14 received ABVD alone and 4 pts ABVD combined to radiation therapy (RP), as primary therapy. Fourteen pts responded after one line and 4 pts needed \u2265 2 lines of salvage therapy to respond. Ten of the 18 pts were autotransplanted in complete remission (CR) and 8 pts in partial remission (PR). Among the 35 pts autotransplanted in sensitive relapse, 20 pts received, as primary therapy, chemotherapy alone (ABVD: 19 pts, BEACOPP: 1 pt), and 15pts received chemotherapy (ABVD: 14 pts, MOPP: 1pt) combined to RP. Of these 35 pts, 21 were autotransplanted in CR and 14 pts in PR. Among the all 53 pts, 31 underwent ASCT in CR and 22 pts in PR. Evaluation of response to salvage therapy before ASCT was performed by PET scan in 32 pts. Source of stem cells were peripheral blood in 51 pts and bone marrow in 2 pts. With a median follow-up of 36 months (m) , overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 10y were 62% and 58%, respectively, for the 53 pts. Concerning the 18 pts with primary refractory disease, OS and DFS rates at 10y were 60% and 59%, respectively. Concerning the 35 pts with sensitive relapse, OS and DFS rates at 10y were 60% and 57%, respectively. There was a signifi cant diff erence in long-term outcome between the two groups of pts autotransplanted in CR and those autotransplanted in PR. Overall survival rates at 10y for the pts autotransplanted in CR versus in PR were 86% and 31%, respectively (p< 0.001). Disease-free survival rates at 10y for the pts autotransplanted in CR versus in PR were 76.5% and 28%, respectively (p< 0.001). (4), S. Kim (5), J. Kim (6) , B. Park (7) The addition of rituximab to CHOP has resulted in signifi cant improvement in the overall survival (OS) of CD20+ diff use large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with high-intermediate or high IPI DLBCL was not satisfactory, and the upfront autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) was reported to improve the survival in these patients subset. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the survival rates in patients with DLBCL with CD20+, who were treated with R-CHOP followed by ASCT. We analyzed 48 DLBCL patients who underwent an ASCT, reported to the Korean Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry between 2005 and 2011 by 12 centers. The patients treated with the upfront ASCT had either stage II with bulky disease (4.2%) or stage III/IV disease (95.8%). Patients characteristics at diagnosis: median age, 48 years(range, 23-66); male, 60.4%; high LDH, 77.1%; high-intermediate or high risk by IPI score and age-adjusted IPI score, 64.6% and 79.2%, respectively. Patients characteristics at the time of ASCT: 81.3% of patients received \u22656 cycles of R-CHOP; response to R-CHOP, 77.1% CR and 22.9% PR; 12.5% of patients received involved fi eld radiotherapy prior to ASCT for bulky disease or residual lymphoma; median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 7.85 months (range, 4.4-16.1) . Median CD34+ cell count infused for ASCT was 5.0x106/kg (range, 1.10-50.47). Median time to ANC \u2265500/\u03bcL and platelet \u226520,000/\u03bcL without platelet transfusion were 12 days (range, 8-25) and 18 days(range, 2-559) posttransplant, respectively. One patient died from transplantation, and lymphoma relapsed after ASCT in 11 patients. Median followup period from diagnosis was 37.4 months (range, 6.3-88.5). 3-year estimates of PFS, OS and relapse from diagnosis were 72.6\u00b16.8%, 82.7\u00b16.0% and 25.8\u00b16.8%, respectively. 5-year estimates of PFS, OS and relapse from diagnosis were 72.6\u00b16,8%, 74.4\u00b19.5% and 25.8\u00b16.8%, respectively. 3-year estimates of PFS and OS according to IPI score were not signifi cantly diff erent among 4 risk groups (P=0.688 and P=0.949, respectively). 3-year estimates of PFS and OS according to aaIPI score were not signifi cantly diff erent among 4 risk groups, either (P=0.890 and P=0.417, respectively). The upfront ASCT following R-CHOP induction therapy may improve survival for patients with advanced high risk DLBCL. Prospective evaluation of the treatment outcome of R-CHOP followed by ASCT is warranted for high risk DLBCL on a large scale. Background: Diff use large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) account approximately 30% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Their curse is aggressive but the cure is the only option that we should look for. The role of high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in fi rst complete remission (CR1) is not clearly established, although several groups propose this alternative in young and fi t patients (pt) with intermediate/high or high risk features. We show our experience about HDT/ASCT in a cohort of DLBCL pt in our hospital. Patients and methods: We analyzed retrospectively 61 consecutive adult pt with DLBCL transplanted for a period of 16 years (y), (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) . They had a median age of 49 y [18-69 y]. Thirty-six pt were transplanted in CR1, 12 pt in second or more complete remission (CR2), 10 pt in partial remission (PR) and 3 pt in refractory or progressive disease (Rf/Pg). Pt were risk-stratifi ed using International Prognosis Index (IPI). There were 26 extranodal DLBCL (42%), and 20 pt (32,8%) did not received rituximab-based therapies before HDT/ASCT. All of conditioning therapies were non-radiotherapy contained (i.e. BEAC and BEAM). Results: After a median follow-up time of near 5 y, median overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) was not reached. Nineteen pt (31%) dead: relapsed or progressive lymphoma in 13 pt (21%), transplant-related mortality (TRM) in 1 (1,6%) and other causes in 5. We did not observe signifi cant diff erences in OS or RFS rate considering regimens before ASCT (rituximab-contained therapies or not), site (nodal or extranodal), or response before ASCT (CR1 or PR/CR2) ( Figure 1 ). In addition, OS rate were higher considering IPI (low/intermediate-low or intermediate-high/high, p=0,021). Four pt were diagnosed of epithelial neoplasm in a median time after ASCT of 4,5 y [2-13y].",

Delia, T. Perrone, P. Curci, F.E. Laddaga, G. Specchia University of Bari (Bari, IT) No standard treatment exists for relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) failure, and prognosis is poor. The natural history of recurrent HL in this setting ranges from a rapidly progressive to a more indolent course. We performed a retrospective analysis of 25 adult patients (15 females/10 males) with cHL relapse/progression after ASCT in order to analyze prognostic factors, response rate and survival. Disease status at transplant was complete remission in 7 patients (28%), sensitive disease in 14 (56%), and refractory disease in 4 (16 %). Median time from ASCT to relapse was 7 months (range 0.5-72), and 44% of the patients relapsed <6 months after ASCT; 12 patients (48%) had stage 3-4 at relapse/progression. Forty percent of the patients had B symptoms, 8% bulky disease and 56% extranodal involvement. Treatment following relapse/progression consisted of the standard BEACOPP regimen in 11 patients (44%), 2nd ASCT in 5 (20%), and Bendamustine in 9 (36%). Results: Overall response rate was 64%, including 36% complete remission and 28% partial response. Thirty-four percent experienced progression and 12% had stable disease. No diff erence in response rate was found between the three treatment regimens. Factors aff ecting the response were: refractory disease, early relapse (<6 months) and more than 3 previous chemotherapy lines. Seven patients (5 in complete remission and 2 in partial remission), underwent non myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant (NMT) and 6 of them are still in complete remission at a median follow-up of 11 months (range 3-60). After a median follow-up of 39 months (range 1-80), PFS at 3 years from relapse/progression after ASCT was 18% and OS was 40%. To date, 15 patients (60%) are alive, nine (29%) still in complete remission (67% of them underwent NMT). All patients treated with BEACOPP and with 2nd ASCT experienced hematologic toxicity (WHO 3-4) and two deaths occurred due to septic shock. In patients treated with bendamustine, drugrelated toxicity WHO 3-4 grade was documented in 2/9 (22%) of patients, with no toxic death. Conclusions: Patients with cHL who fail ASCT have a very poor prognosis and the ultimate goal of treatment should be to refer them for NMT. New agents, including monoclonal antibody are useful in order to reduce disease burden before allo-SCT. Hodgkin lymphoma (HLy) is one of the frequently and potentially curable hematological neoplasm, most patients (pts) are curable with chemo -and radiotherapy but the rests achieve only partial remission or have relapse after treatment. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AutoHCT) can off er the chance to obtain long-term survival for some patients with refractory form of HLy. In Department of Hematology and BMT Medical University of Silesia until November 2012, 390 AutoHCT in HLy patients were performed. Most of Chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies support a role for B cell involvement in the pathogenesis of cGvHD. A unique population of CD21-CD20hiCD27-B cells with features of exhaustion was recently described in patients with chronic HIV viremia. In this study we describe a similar population of CD21-B cells in the peripheral blood of cGVHD patients. Using multicolor fl ow cytometry we performed an extensive analysis of B phenotype and function in 16 patients with active cGvHD compared to 14 age-matched HSCT recipients without clinical evidence of cGVHD and 11 healthy controls. Chronic GvHD patients had signifi cantly higher frequencies of CD21-B cells in the PB compared with patients without cGvHD and HC (median 12.2% vs. 2.12% vs. 3%; p<0.01). Multi-parameter fl ow cytometry revealed that the majority of these cells were CD10-CD27-CD21 CD20hi, reminiscent of the recently described exhausted B cells in HIV patients with chronic viremia. We did not observe increased transitional (CD24hi-CD38hi-CD19+) or immature B cells (CD10+CD21-CD27-CD19+) in cGvHD patients compared with patients with no cGVHD (median transitional 3.4% vs. 6.3%; p=0.08) and [median immature (out of total CD21-B cells) 3.15 vs.9.34%; p=0.045)]. As reported in chronic HIV viremia, expanded CD21-B cells in cGVHD patients also expressed higher inhibitory receptors namely FCRL4, CD22 and CD85J, chemokine receptors CD11c, CXCR3 and lower CD62L and CCR7 compared with na\u00efve (CD27-CD21+CD19+) and classical memory (CD27+CD21+CD19+) B cells. Moreover, B cells in patients with cGVHD had a lower proliferative potential following B-cell receptor crosslinking compared with B cells from patients with no GvHD or HC, a feature of exhaustion associated with high expression of inhibitory receptors. The frequencies of CD21-B cell were predictive for the severity of cGVHD with an OR for severe, moderate and mild cGVHD of 1.31 (p=0.001), 1.22 (p=0.005) and 1.17 (p=0.02) respectively. In multivariate analysis, previous history of aGvHD (p=0.01) and CD21-B cell frequencies > 5% (p=0.001) were the only variables found to be independently associated with cGVHD. These data suggest that CD21-B cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD and could be used as as a marker of disease severity.",

Bussmann, C. Wolschke, H. Lellek, U. Bacher, A.R. Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Only few studies addressing survival of patients who developed cGVHD used the recently introduced NIH consensus criteria. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 495 consecutive adult patients who underwent allo-SCT at our center between 2005 and 2009. GVHD occurring \u2265 100 days after allo-SCT was classifi ed as late acute or chronic GvHD. cGVHD was retrospectively categorized according to NIH consensus criteria and considered progressive onset if diagnosed \u2264 2 weeks of end of steroid treatment for aGVHD or quiescent onset if diagnosed > 2 weeks after end of steroid treatment for aGVHD. GVHD was categorized as overlap syndrome if cGVHD and acute gastrointestinal GVHD were present. Survival was estimated from time of diagnosis of cGVHD. Results: In all 412 patients were evaluable for GVHD \u2265 100 days after allo-SCT of whom 179 (43%) developed no GVHD, 32 (8%) developed late acute GVHD, 182 (44%) classic cGVHD and 19 (5%) overlap syndrome. Of the 201 patients with cGVHD 66 (33%) were categorized de novo onset, 123 (61%) quiescent onset and 12 (6%) progressive onset. Late acute GVHD was associated with worse 3 yr. survival (38%) compared to classic cGVHD (73%) and overlap syndrome (76%) p < 0.001. In patients with cGVHD platelet counts less than 100.000/ul at time of cGVHD diagnosis was associated with worse 3 year survival 51% vs. 80% (p< 0.001). 3 year survival according to NIH overall stage was 58% for severe, 69% for moderate and 79% for mild cGVHD (p= 0.174). After excluding patients with myeloma, low IgG level at diagnosis also negatively impacted survival with 3 year survival rates of 74% for normal, 79% for decreased and 47% (7 months) for increased IgG level (p= 0.04). In multivariate analysis only platelet counts at diagnosis (RR = 3.24; 95% CI = 1.81-5.80; p< 0.001) and patient age (RR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.06; p= 0.01) signifi cantly impacted survival of patients with cGVHD. Conclusion: Our results confi rm the negative prognostic impact of low platelet counts and late acute GVHD and indicate that these are still the parameters with strongest impact and highest consistency even in the era of the NIH classifi cation. We suggest a prognostic role of serum IgG level that merits further investigation. S438 P1193 Successful use of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) in the management of ocular chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) F. Zallio (1) Purpose: Allogeneic (allo)-SCT represents a potentially curative treatment option for many hematological malignancies; the widespread use of this procedure has, however, a number of important limitations. Ocular chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is one of the most frequent complications after allo-SCT and is often associated with signifi cant morbidity and reduced quality of life. The main therapeutic aim in the management of ocular cGVHD is the treatment of infl ammation and dryness in order to decrease patients' symptoms and to maintain ocular integrity and function. Unfortunately conventional medical treatments, represented by systemic immunosuppressive and local therapies (mainly artifi cial tears and corticosteroids), off er unsatisfactory results. Methods: We investigated the safety and effi cacy of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) to treat ocular cGVHD unresponsive to standard medications. From 2007 to 2012 we treated with PRP eye drops 18 patients who underwent to allogeneic SCT and aff ected by ocular GVHD refractory to local steroid therapy. PRP eye drops were used six times/day for one year. PRP eye drops are prepared under laminar fl ow hood, in sterile single dose, stored at -20\u00b0C. Patients were evaluated through subjective (symptoms pointed out in a self-assessment questionnaire) and objective tests (Schirmer test, FBUT, BVA, anterior segment score, fl uorescein score, lissamine score) by the same ophthalmologist at time 0, 30, 180 and 365. Results: Patients were defi ned as \"responders\" if they had showed at least one sign: at 30 days 86% and 57% of the patients had an improvement of symptoms (S) and ocular signs (T), respectively and 0% had corneal damage; these response was kept on throughout the treatment period: in fact after one year of treatment 86% and 43% continued to have an amelioration of their symptoms (S) and ocular signs (T), respectively, while 7% had corneal damage. Conclusions: Therapy with autologous PRP eye drops is easy to use, safe and low cost; this procedure shows an improvement of symptoms and corneal damage already since 30 days of treatment, with a progressive improvement in quality of life and return to daily activities; in addition it is worthwhile to demonstrate that the effi cacy is maintained throughout the year of treatment. Therefore autologous PRP eye drops could represent a valid alternative option to conventional therapy in the management of ocular cGVHD. Introduction: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the leading complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and causes signifi cant morbidity and mortality. CD4+ T-cells play a critical role in mediating GVHD, and much eff ort has been devoted to studying the eff ect of CD4+ T-cells during the pathophysiology process of GVHD. Even though just accounting for 5% of the total CD4+ T-cell population, the most promising candidates are naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are one of the regulators of immune responses. TH17 is a newly identifi ed T-cell lineage that secretes IL-17, a proinfl ammatory cytokine. However, the functional role of TH17 cells in the development of GVHD has not been well characterized in humans. The aim of our study was to characterize the expression of Treg (FOXP3) and TH17-related (ROR\u03b3t) genes in peripheral blood of patients undergoing HSCT and correlate them with the development of GVHD in allogeneic HSCT.Patients and Methods: Samples were collected from the peripheral blood of 50 patients before and after HSCT and at the time of GVHD onset. Thirty patients were diagnosed as acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, eleven as chronic myeloid leukemia and ten with lymphomas. Seven healthy donors were used as controls. All patients received an HLA-identical related donor graft.Expression of FOXP3 and ROR\u03b3t were assessed by Real-Time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), by Taqman method. Results: Median age for the 50 analyzed patients was 36 years-old (range: 17-60), 52% were female. 50% had GVHD, with an average onset of 39 days after HSCT for acute GVHD (range: 12-93) and 182 days for chronic . No signifi cant association was observed between FOXP3 expression and patients with or without GVHD. On the other hand, ROR\u03b3t showed significantly higher expression in patients with chronic GVHD compared to samples before HSCT (p<0.0001), without GVHD (p<0.0001) and acute GVHD (p=0.0006). Both FOXP3 and ROR\u03b3t showed signifi cant statistical decreased expression in patients compared to healthy controls, except for ROR\u03b3t expression in patients with chronic GVHD (p=NS). Conclusion: ROR\u03b3t showed signifi cantly higher expression in patients with chronic GVHD compared to samples before HSCT, without GVHD and acute GVHD, suggesting that a proinfl ammatory state is involved in chronic GVHD pathophysiology.",

Taylor Rotherham General Hospital (Rotherham, GB) Introduction: In 2008, Rotherham Foundation Trust became the fi rst UK hospital to utilise the Therakos Cellex TM integrated extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) system for the treatment of chronic Graft versus-Host Disease (cGvHD). The device was designed to supersede the UVAR XTS TM , introduced in 1998. The newer device off ers simultaneous blood collection and return via continuous fl ow modality resulting in reduced extracorporeal volumes compared to single-needle confi guration. We and others have reported diff erences in the leucocyte harvests generated by the 2 devices. To examine whether the introduction of the Cel-lex\u2122 device has impacted on clinical and steroid dose response we compared patients treated with either device. Methods: cGvHD patients treated either exclusively with the Cellex (n=50) or the XTS device (n=51) for a minimum period of 6 months, were included. Clinical assessment of organ involvement and then response was taken prior to ECP start and at 3,6 and 12 rates in our cohort. However, the Cellex device may off er shorter median in-treatment time for patients due to continuous fl ow technology.",

            "text": "The Impact of lung chronic GVHD on survival after cord blood transplantation S. Kato (1) Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is major cause of mortality and impairs patient's quality of life after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Especially, the prognosis of patients suff ered from lung cGVHD is poor. Although incidence and severity of cGVHD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is lower than those after bone marrow transplantation, impact of cGVHD on survival has not been analyzed enough in CBT. We have investigated the eff ects of cGVHD on outcomes of CBT. One-hundred-eighty adult patients with various hematological diseases underwent CBT after myeloablative conditioning containing 12Gy total body irradiation in the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo between August 1998 and August 2012. Among them, we have analyzed 153 patients who survived more than 100 days after CBT. Eighty-six patients (56%) were categorized as standard risk (CR1,CR2,CML-CP,NHLCR-u,MDS-RA, MDS-RCMD, AA) and 67 (44%) were high risk(others)in disease status. All patients received single cord blood unit and acute GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine plus short-term methotrexate . Median age was 41(range:18-55years, median weight was 57(37-104) kg, median numbers of cryopreserved nucleated and CD34 positive cells were 2.5(1.3-3.7)\u00d7107/kg and 0.9(0.2-7.8)\u00d7105/kg, respectively. Variables considered in statistical analyses were age,weight,disease risk,total nucleated and CD34 positive cell dose, positivity of CMV, sex ,ABO and HLA mismatches.The impact of cGVHD was assessed as a time-dependent covariate using Cox models. Median follow up period of survivors (N=124) was 80(3-174) months after transplant.Cumulative incidence of extended type cGVHD (extGVHD) and lung cGVHD at 5 years after CBT were 34 (95% confi dence interval [CI], 26-41)and 20(95%CI, 13-26)%, respectively. The 5years probabilities of overall survival of patients with/without extGVHD and with/without lung GVHD were 73 (95% CI, 57-84) %/85 (95% CI, 75-91) % (p<0.05) and 67 (95% CI, 44-82) %/84 (95% CI, 76-90) % (p<0.05). The cumulative incidences of relapse between patients with/ without extGVHD or those of lung GVHD were similar. However, the 5-years cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was higher in patients with both extGVHD [1 (0-3) %vs 18 (7-30)%; P<0.05] and lung GVHD [3 (0-5) % vs 25 (8-43)%; P<0.01]. It is suggested that patients developing lung GVHD had significantly poor survival due to increasing NRM. This is the fi rst analysis evaluating the impact of lung GVHD on patients after CBT. derived MP levels. However there was no signifi cant diff erence in plasma levels of MPs in patients with and without chronic GVHD. In a previous study by Pihusch R et al patients with chronic GVHD demonstrated seven fold increased levels of circulating platelet derived MPs. In that report blood samples were analysed when patients showed signs of chronic GVHD, however our patients were already on immunosupressive treatment for chronic GVHD. Infl ammatuary activity of chronic GVHD which might have been supressed by immunosupppressive treatment might explain the contoversial results. Acknowledgements: This study was supported by the research grant from the Turkish Society of Hematology. Objective: To analize BO as a severe complication of allo-SCT in order to identify risk factors, response to specifi c treatment and overall survival. Material And Methods: Retrospective study in 439 patients who have undergone allo-SCT between 2002 and 2012 in our centre. From the 350 analizable ones for chronic GVHD,41 were diagnosed of BO (11,7%): probable BO when they only showed clinical, radiologic and spirometric characteristics (19 patients), and proven BO if they also met histological criteria (22 patients). The median age at SCT was 52 and 22/19 were men/ women. Allo-SCT was related in 22 patients and unrelated in the other 19, with a missmatched donor in 10 cases (24%). Conditioning regimen was ablative in 28(68%), including radiotherapy in 7 cases, and 6 patients had undergone a SCT before. GVHD prophilaxis was based on calcioneurin inhibitors (Ciclosporine in 88%), with Methrotexate in 21patients and Micofenolate in 18.ATG was employed in 6 cases. Stem cell source was peripheral blood in 10 (24%). >grade1 acute GVHD was observed in 26 patients (63%), and 23 were good responders to corticosteroids (15CR and 8PR). Extensive chronic GVHD, basically mucocutaneous, was observed in 35 patients (85%) before the onset of BO. Median time from allo-SCT to chronic GVHD was 9 months and, from the 15 patients (37%) with pulmonary tests, the median FEV1 decrease was 35% [0-69]. Median time from chronic GVHD to BO was 2 months [0-31]. All patients were treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids: 9 (22%) at high doses, and 21 (51%) in combination with another immunosupressor. 15 patients (37%) needed outpatient oxygen support. Results: Estimated overall survival (OS) was 56% at 2 years and 47% at 5 years,with a median follow-up of 19 months [8-115] from the diagnosis of BO. 22 patients are alive by now (54%), half of them without treatment and with ECOG0. 19 patients died, 12 of them (63%) because of BO. We found signifi cant diff erences in 2 variables: need of treatment (OS if independent: 100% at 2 years, and if dependent: 39%, p<0.001) and time to develop BO (OS if < 1 year: 48% at 2 years and if > 1year: 77%, p=0.008). Conclusions: BO related to GVHD involves high mortality in our series. Early BO onset and high dose corticosteroids/ immunosuppressive therapy seem to decrease the OS. Pulmonary tests could help with an earlier diagnosis of BO.",

There are few reports of the eff ect of ECP on patients' quality of life. Objective: To prospectively assess the impact of ECP on healthrelated quality of life in patients with chronic GvHD using two validated questionnaires. Methods: We report a single-centre prospective study of patients undergoing fortnightly ECP. Response was assessed after 6 months of treatment using National Institutes for Health scoring criteria and reduction in immunosuppression. Patients completed a formal assessment of quality of life at baseline and after six months of treatment using the chronic GvHD symptom scale (cGvHD SS) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Results: Eighteen patients (8 male, 10 female) completed the cGvHD SS at baseline and after six months of ECP. 14 patients had received a transplant from an unrelated donor and 4 from a sibling donor. 15 patients had moderate GvHD and 3 had severe GvHD. 15 had classic chronic GvHD, 2 had overlap syndrome and 1 had developed GvHD post donor lymphocyte infusions. 14 patients had cutaneous GvHD. Other organs involved were: mouth (9), liver (4), ocular (9), gastrointestinal tract (3), lung (2), musculoskeletal (4), gynaecological (1). Ten patients were receiving 2 immunosuppressive drugs at start of ECP, 4 were receiving one drug, 3 were receiving 3 drugs and one patient was not receiving any immunosuppression. Baseline cGvHD SS scores ranged from 8/120 to 64/120 with a median score of 38/120. 17/18 (94%) showed an improvement in scores. The mean cGvHD SS was signifi cantly lower after 6 months of ECP (22 compared to 36, p=0.012). Sixteen patients completed the DLQI at both time points. Baseline scores ranged from 0/30 to 15/30 with a median of 7/30. The mean score was signifi cantly lower after 6 months of ECP treatment (3.4 compared to 6.9, p=0.009). 13/18 (72%) patients had a partial clinical response and 1 had a complete response. Two patients had a mixed response, one a minimal response and one patient had progressive disease. All the patients who had a complete or partial response had an improvement in both scores except for one. 9/15 (60%) patients receiving steroid therapy at baseline had a > 50% dose reduction. Conclusion: ECP may lead to an improvement in quality of life in patients with GvHD in addition to clinical response and reduction of immunosuppression.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effi cacy and safety in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients converted from continuous infusion tacrolimus (TAC cont. IV) or twice-daily tacrolimus (TAC BID) to once-daily prolonged release of tacrolimus formation (TAC OD). Patients and Methods: We have retrospectively analyzed the records of 51 adult patients who underwent allo-HSCT and have treated with TAC OD in our hospital before December 2011. The dose conversion ratio between TAC cont. IV and TAC OD was 1:5, TAC BID and TAC OD was 1:1. Tacrolimus trough level has checked day0 and day7. Laboratory parameters (total cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood sugar, brain natriuretic peptide, estimated glomerular filtration rate) and adverse events were assessed. Results: The underlying disease was Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 11 patients, Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 13, MDS overt AML in 10, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 8, Malignant lymphoma in 7, Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in 2. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative regimen in 26 and non-myeloablative in 25. The donor source was sibling-donor in 16, unrelated-donor in 31, cord blood in 4. In all patients, tacrolimus was started at 0.02mg/kg/day as continuous infusion from day -1 or -3. All patients were combined with short-methotrexate and 2 patients with anti-thymocyte globulin. After engraftment, 11 patients were first changed to TAC OD from TAC cont. IV, and 40 patients to TAC BID and changed to TAC OD from TAC BID at the TAC concentration stable. GvHD status when converted to TAC OD was no sign of GvHD in 24, and acute or chronic GvHD in 27. After one week, TAC concentrations were lower in 20 patients (7 patients from TAC cont. IV) and higher in 9 patients when compared with baseline. By changing TAC BID to TAC OD, there were only 3 patients to GvHD got worse, but TAC cont. IV, 5patients got worse. All laboratory parameters were not significantly different. Adverse events were consistent with the safety profile known from previous studies with TAC BID. In 32 patients, chronic GvHD has been improved gradually during treated with TAC OD, but in 5 patients, lung GvHD has not improved. Conclusion: Conversion to TAC OD is eff ective and safe, enhances immunosuppressant adherence and should be accompanied by a close tacrolimus level monitoring during the initial period.",

            "text": "Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment for many hematological disorders. Chronic graft-versushost disease (GVHD) is a serious complication that appears in 20-70% of the patients. There are some described cases of patients with nephrotic syndrome after bone marrow transplantation(BMT) as an expression of GVHD.The objective of our study is to analyze patients with allogenic BMT who developed a glomerular pathology as an expression of GVHD. Material and methods: We analyzed all patients who underwent allogenic BMT in our hospital from October 1995 to June 2011 who developed a glomerular pathology after the transplant. Chronic GVHD was defi ned in patients who survived >100 days after allogenic BMT.The diff erent clinical and analytical variables of patients with chronic kidney GVHD were studied. Results: Five hundred and ten allogenic BMT patients were analyzed. The age range was 1-69 years old ( Table 1 ). The prevalence of chronic kidney GVHD was 0.784%. All patients with renal GVHD, were patients with BMT of peripheral blood, identical HLA. GVHD prophylaxis was administered with methotrexate and ciclosporin, and in 1 patient, this treatment was replaced by tacrolimus due to neurological toxicity. Chronic kidney GVHD appeared after removal of the GVHD prophylaxis with proteinuria levels of 2.65-15.46 g/day secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulonephritis and lupic nephropathy class III. After the start of the immunosuppressant treatment with corticoids in all patients and anti-calcineurin drugs in 3 patients,complete remission was achieved.In 3 patients under complete remission, recurrence of the glomerular pathology was observed when the immunosuppressant therapy was removed, which led to the re-introduction of the treatment. Conclusions: Chronic GVHD with renal involvement is a rare entity associated to the removal of immunosuppressant therapy which usually appears with proteinuria. Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common histology. It can be useful to monitor proteinuria levels in these patients.-In our population,we identifi ed the following risk factors for GVHD of the kidney: donor/recipient gender disparity, positive results for CMV, peripheral blood BMT, and the presence of previous acute or chronic GVHD.-Complete remission was achieved in all cases of chronic GVHD of the kidney, but some outbreaks appeared after removal of the immunosuppressant therapy. We must consider a diff erent therapeutic approach for glomerular pathology secondary to chronic GVHD.",

In 2011, 1217 procedures were performed with 40% plasma exchanges (TPE), 32% extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), 16% Stem cells collection and lymphocyte collection.[P1210] S447 Two Spectra (Terumo BCT), one Com.Tec (Fresenius) and one Optia (Terumo BCT) are currently used. We evaluated the Amicus Separator (Fenwal) as an alternate platform to collect lymphocytes for off line ECP. The objective was to assess procedure performance, safety and compatibility with off -line technique. Methods: A total of 21 procedures to collect Mononuclear cells (MNC) for ECP were evaluated between June and August 2012 in patients with GVHD (14), cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (4), lichen planus (2), systemic lupus erythematosus (1). One total blood volume was targeted to process. Maximum whole blood fl ow rate was 60 ml/min. The software version was 4.3. The procedure settings were MNC off set 1.5ml, RBC off set 5.0 ml, plasma fl ush 8ml, WB per cycle 2000ml for patient with WBC count < 5 x 10E9/l and 1400ml for patient with WBC count > 5 x 10E9/l. The illumination procedure post collection was performed after addition of 8-MOP (Macopharma) using a UVA PIT System device (Med Tech Solution). The 21 Amicus procedures were compared with historical data for Spectra (N=260), Optia (N=174) and Com.Tec (N=198). The performance was evaluated based on 1) lymphocyte collection yield and purity; 2) patient PLT depletion; 3) procedure time (reinfusion included) and 4) adverse events during the collection procedure. Results: The average blood volume treated was 1.02 for Amicus, 1.04 for Spectra, 0.95 Optia and 0.95 for Com.Tec. Yield and purity of collected products are presented in table 1. Adverse events with Amicus were mild. No citrate related reaction was observed. Conclusions: Monocytes and lymphocytes collection effi ciency with Amicus was satisfactory and comparable to other platforms with signifi cantly lower platelet depletion from the patient. Yield and purity of the Amicus collected product are predictable and show less variability than with Optia. The full automation of the Amicus machine was well appreciated by the operators who keep the opportunity to adjust parameters during the procedure.",

Unfortunately diagnosis and treatment of BOS still remain diffi cult. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has shown effi cacy in treatment of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) as well as BOS. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria for diagnosis of BOS after allogeneic stem cell transplantation 26 patients (pts) at our centre were diagnosed with BOS between 2003 and 2012. All patients (median age 52 years) were treated by corticosteroids including inhalative application forms. 19 patients (73%) additionally received ECP treatment for a minimum of 3 months. Improvement of pulmonary function, clinical symptoms and outcome were analyzed. The donors were HLA identical siblings in 8 patients, HLA-mismatched siblings in 2 patients, HLAcompatible unrelated donors in 11 patients and unrelated donors with one HLA-mismatch in 5 patients. 6 Patients presented with de novo cGvHD, 6 with quiescent and 14 with progressive cGvHD. Manifestation of BOS, diagnosed by the NIH criteria for diagnosis of BOS, was in median detected at day 343 after transplantation (range day 126-1679). FEV1 and FEV1/FVC as parameters of pulmonary function were monitored continuously during treatment. At diagnosis of BOS FEV1/FVC was less than 50% in 4 pts, less than 60% in 8 pts and between 60% and 70% in 14 pts. 3 patients showed a FEV1 of less than 35% predicted, 9 between 36% and 50% and 14 between 51% and 75%. Improvement of lung function was defi ned as 10% increase of FEV1. Response to treatment measured by pulmonary function tests was observed in 10 of 26 pts (38,5%) and clinical response in 12 pts (46,2%). Overall survival (OS) after a follow up between 280 and 3469 days was 65,4% and median OS was 958 days. Additional treatment with ECP had no positive impact on survival: OS was 58% in the ECP group compared to 86% in the other group. Cause of death was progressive BOS and GvHD in 7 patients, relapse of leukemia in one and unknown in one patient. BOS and cGvHD were confi rmed as life threatening complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In our patient cohort additional treatment with ECP for BOS did not improve survival. To evaluate the eff ect of ECP in BOS treatment further studies should be performed. E. Jakob, A. Knoll, K. Brandauer, B. Dobner, G. Auff arth, P. Dreger, U. Hegenbart, F.

To assess goblet cell density we compared the more invasive impression cytology (IC) with the less invasive in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Methods: Patients who were listed for HSCT were examined before and 100 days after the transplantation. The examination included a questionnaire, slit lamp examination, Schirmer Test II, impression cytology and confocal microscopy of the conjunctiva with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph with the Rostock Cornea Modul attachment (HRT-RCM). At least three specimen/pictures of each patient were assessed for goblet cell density and means were calculated. Approval of the Ethical Review Board Heidelberg and informed consent was obtained. Results: 44 patients were included (mean age 56 years). 18 patients were not re-examined after HSCT (4 died, 2 were pre fi nal, 2 were not transplanted, 10 repeatedly cancelled their follow-up examination due to poor health). Mean time to follow-up examination was 147 days after HSCT. Goblet cell density before and after HSCT of all patients with evaluable pre-and post HSCT -examination was 52.6\u00b17.5 vs. 43.9\u00b14.1 cells/mm2 (Mean\u00b1SEM, p=0.46, n=8, wilcoxon's signed rank) assessed with IC and 62.7\u00b13.4 vs 61.6 \u00b14.3 Zellen/mm2 (p=0.8, n=24) assessed with IVCM. 8 healthy subjects were examined via IVCM as control (mean age 38 years), mean goblet cell density was 74.8 \u00b1 4.3 cells/mm 2 . Conclusions: IVCM showed goblet cell numbers in similar magnitude to the standard method IC, we therefore conclude that IVCM can also reliably be used. Conjunctival goblet cells did not show a signifi cant decrease after HSCT. The time interval to follow-up examination may have been too short as most patients still were on immunosuppressants and only 2 had signs of oGvHD. Patients who present with oGvHD symptoms will be re-examined for goblet cell density in our clinic.",

Lupo-Stanghellini San Raff aele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Background: Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) is a serious complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: frequent cause of late morbidity and non-relapse-mortality. Steroids are the treatment of choice to control GvHD manifestation, but for steroid-refractory GvHD alternative options are of need. In view of the anti-infl ammatory and antiproliferative properties and its successful use in patients (pts) with autoimmune disorders, low dose methotrexate (MTX) is an option mainly for skin and oral manifestations of cGVHD. Methods: We describe here the data from a retrospective study in our transplanted pts in order to assess the effi cacy of MTX in GvHD therapy. Pts were treated between Jan-2011 and Oct-2012. Results: Overall 13 pts with GvHD were treated with a starting dose of 7.5 mg/m2 weekly of MTX. Only 1 pt was treated for acute GvHD but the drug was discontinued after 2 weeks due to pancitopenia and worsening of liver function. Pts characteristics are reported in table 1, of note 11 pts had a severe chGvHD and 7 an overlap chGvHD. Three out of 13 pts had to discontinue therapy with MTX (median 2 administration) due to the onset of hepatic toxicity (grade II-III). Nine pts were able to receive a proper treatment for a median time of 9 months (range 2-20). All of them had skin involvement, 7 eye and 5 notes of scleroderma or fasciitis. After the introduction of MTX 5 pts completely resolved skin GvHD, 2 had major response, 1 partial response (reduction of sclerodermic features and reduction of Rodnam score from 19 to 5.5), 1 pt is so far stable after 2 months of treatment. In our records scleroderma/fasciitis improved with MTX in 4/5 pts, one pt shows stabilization -table 2a.At the start of MTX 6 pts were assuming steroid-therapy with a mean dosage of 0.25mg/kg/day; 3 pts succeeded in discontinuing the therapy with prednisone and the other 3 encountered a substantial reduction of the steroid dosage -table 2b. Furthermore, all pts were also receiving several lines of immunosuppressive treatment (IST): 7/9 pts reduced the IST during therapy with MTX, no case of strengthening of IST. Discussion: A global evaluation of all 9 pts shows an improvement of the chGvHD in the totality of them. As previously reported, lowdose MTX show good tolerance and easy manageability. Longterm use seems feasible. So far, from our data, we can state that MTX seems an eff ective choice as steroid-sparing agent in severe chGvHD and, of interest, in overlap chGvHD therapy.",

El-Haddad, M. Abdel-Mooti, R. Abd El Fattah, O. Fahmy, H. Mahmoud Nasser institute hospital for research&treatment (Cairo, EG) Background: Allogeneic HSCT is the only curative approach for patients with B-Thalassemia Major (BTM). Compared to PBSCs, BM is the preferred source of engraftment with an expected lower incidence of cGVHD. Aims: Back in 1997, when we started our transplant program at Nasser Institute (Cairo, Egypt), the vast majority of our patients, including those with BTM, recieved PBSCs; and we published some of our encouraging results regarding engraftment, GVHD incidence & outcome (HK Mahmoud et al. Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999; 24:355) . Thus, in this single arm in this single arm prospective study, we investigated the same approach on a wider b-thalassemia patient scale, with a much longer follow up to, eventually, evaluate the incidence & severity of cGVHD, as well as EFS & OS (Primary end points). Patients & methods: In the time period between November 1997 and March 2010, 118 BTM patients received allogeneic HLA-Matched sibling PBSCT at the BMT unit of Nasser institute, Cairo, Egypt. Mean age of patients was 5.6(Range=15 months -18 years). The regimen consisted of Bu at a total dose of 16 mg/Kg, a total Cy dose of 120mg/kg and a total ATG dose of 110 mg/Kg.Cyclosporine & Methotrexate were used for GVHD prophylaxis.Results: The mean number of infused CD34+ve cells was 7.2 x 106 /kg recipient weight. All patients engrafted promptly at a median of 17 days for neutrophils and 19 days for platelets. The total incidence of cGVHD was 9% ,while that of grade 2-4 acute GVHD was 3.3%. Incidence of primary graft failure did not exceed 6. At a follow up period of up to 13 years (median 7.9 years), OS&EFS were 89 %, with 70% of patients having complete chimerism and 19% stable mixed chimerism, all of whom are transfusion independent. Conclusion: Allografting BTM patients using PBSCs instead of BM, is a signifi cantly easier & safer approach for the donor, with promising outcome regarding engraftment, DFS & OS. Finally, Our results showed signifi cantly lower incidence of cGVHD, compared to that reported with BM stem cells. Introduction: Interest in defi ning the role of immunomodulation of graft versus host disease (GVHD) by ultraviolet radiation has recently increased, since systemic immunosuppression (IS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We have been using at our institution three modalities of phototherapy -PUVA (psor-S450 alen+ ultraviolet A), UVBNB (ultraviolet B narrow band) and extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) -to treat diff erent manifestations of cutaneous GVHD for the last 22 years. Objective: Report the applicability, indications and benefi cial eff ects of each phototherapy modality in the treatment of GVHD in a single institution. Methods: Puvatherapy was used in 55 patients to treat lichen planus like and sclerodermic chronic GVHD(cGVHD) with no visceral involvement. UVBNB was used in 15 patients for vitiligo, limited lichen planus like cGVHD, those with psoralen intolerance and children. ECP was reserved to treat 36 patients with extensive sclerodermic, fasci\u00edte cGVHD, systemic cGVHD and 11 patients with acute GVHD (grade III and IV) as second or third line therapy. It was not feasible to evaluate median time of sessions until an answer or time for reducing IS, because there was great heterogeneity of disease severity and systemic treatment adopted.Results: From the 55 patients treated with PUVA, 23(42%) achieved complete response, 16(29%) partial response, 9(16,3%) no response and 7(12,7%) were too early to evaluate (in treatment). Immunosuppression was withdrawn in 27 patients and reduced in 12. Three patients treated with UVBNB achieved complete response, 8 partial response, 2 no response and 2 were still under treatment. In 7 patients, IS was suspended and in 4 reduced. FEC was performed in 36 cGVHD steroid refractory patients. Eight (22%) achieved complete response and 19(53%) partial response with global response in 75%. Immunossupression was withdrawn in 3 and reduced in 24. Among the 11 acute GVHD patients submitted to FEC, 6(54.5%) responded well. Conclusion: PUVA and UVBNB is a topical direct therapy and should be considered in patients in whom the increase of systemic IS leads to high risk of infection or interference with the graft-versus-tumor effect. ECP is indicated to patients not responsive to corticosteroids, those with IS toxicity or those who need early withdrawal of IS (high risk of relapse of malignant disease). Phototherapy modalities are safe, effective and should be individualized for the type of cutaneous GVHD. Introduction and objectives: Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) of the lung, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is a serious complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Therapy of BOS includes topical treatment and systemic treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. However, when medical treatment fails, lung transplantation (LTX) may be indicated as the ultimate treatment option. Methods: We searched our institutional data base for lung and bone marrow transplantation and three patients were found with an history of both procedure performed. We collected demographic and outcome data about transplant procedures. Results: Between 1998 and 2005, 3 patients (2 females and 1 male), with a median age of 24 years (range 21-49), underwent alloHSCT because of myelodisplastic syndrome, B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma. In all cases, donors were HLA identical siblings while the cell source was the bone marrow for one patient and the peripheral blood for the other two. No patient presented acute GVHD and in all cases a de novo chronic GVHD developed and, eventually, respiratory failure. LTX was needed after a median time of 4 years (range 3-9) from HSCT. Bilateral LTX was performed in 2 out of 3 patients, cardiopulmonary bypass in 2 and only one of them required tracheostomy (before LTX). All patients are alive and in hematological complete remission after a median follow-up of 5 years (range 4-6) from LTX. One of them developed acute lung rejection 2 years after LTX that was successfully treated with high dose steroids even though the late follow up was also complicated by chronic rejection. At last follow up his pulmonary function tests (PFTs) by spirometry show a severe reduction of the diff using capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and severe restrictive and obstructive changes of the lung volumes. This patient is currently being considered for a second LTX. The other two patients are leading an active life, are currently maintained on immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone and their PFTs show normal or middle reduction of DLCO and lung volumes with stable values over time. Conclusion: Our data indicate that lung transplantation may represent an eff ective treatment option of BOS with remarkable improvement of the quality of life. In selected good prognosis HSCT patients, lung transplantation should not be unnecessarily delayed or refused. (1) Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) represents an innovative therapeutical option, however data supporting the efficacy are limited. Methods: 42 months after double-lung transplantation due to cystic fi brosis a patient presented himself with BOS grade 3 with a vital capacity (VC) of 5,100 ml (BOS grade 1: VC of 5,940 ml) and a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2,120 ml (BOS grade 1: FEV1 of 4,930 ml). He showed a progressive decline in lung function despite a triple drug therapy with steroids, FK506 and mycophenolate mofetil. At our unit he was treated with two ECPs per week for 8 weeks, later at lower frequency. Multi-color fl ow cytometry was performed for naive T-cells, CD45RA+ eff ector T cells (T EMRA), memory T-cells and FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg), NK-cells, NKT-cells and BAFF-R+ B-cells. Results: 12 weeks after the start of ECP treatment no further decline of lung function with a VC of 5,070 ml and a FEV1 of 2,160 ml was measured by spirometry. In addition, the lung function improved to a VC of 5,360 ml and to a FEV1 of 2,410 ml 15 weeks later. The frequency of regulatory T cells of all CD4+ T cells increased over the time of ECP treatment from 1.2% before ECP to 6.7% after 106 days of treatment. The frequency of CD8+ eff ector T cells was reduced from 58.8% to 36.6% and of T(EM) from 10.4% to 3.2% over the time of ECP treatment, while na\u00efve T cells increased from 27.8% to 55.6%. The B cell population presented with a very low percentage of < 2.6% over the time of therapy. The NK cell population presented with a low regular percentage of around 10% of all lymphocytes over the time of therapy, as well as NK-T cells of around 0.7% of all lymphocytes. Conclusion: ECP treatment was well tolerated and no severe infectious disease complications occurred during the therapy. Through ECP the lung function improved. Immunologically, the frequency of eff ector T cells thought to be responsible for the allograft rejection were reduced and the frequency of the regulatory T cells hampering the eff ector T cells increased. S451 Therefore, ECP therapy is an immunologically interesting and clinically promising therapeutic option for patients suff ering from allograft rejection.",

Marks, H. Schumann University Hospital Freiburg (Freiburg, DE) Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) as a major post-transplant complication is responsible for increased morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Skin is the most common organ involved by chronic GvHD (cGvHD). In patients with sclerodermatous GvHD treatment of chronic wounds is challenging. Water-fi ltered infrared A (wIRA) radiation can improve the healing of acute and chronic wounds by increasing tissue temperature, oxygen partial pressure and perfusion.Here we present an impressive case report of a 52-year-old patient after allogenic HSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in December 2007 who was treated later on with wIRA because of his numerous very badly-healing wounds on sclerodermatous skin due to chronic cutaneous GvHD. In 10/2008 he presented with his first symptoms of cutaneous GvHD: initially inflammatory signs changing into multifocal sclerodermatous lesions leading to restriction of motion and loss of function. Next to diverse immunosuppressive systemic therapy and physiotherapy the patient underwent extracorporeal photopheresis since 5/09 and had UV-A1 phototherapy in 11/2009. He experienced slight improvement, but no striking success by these treatment modalities. In January 2010 numerous painful ulcerations developed on the sclerodermatous skin, especially on shoulder, neck and head. The wounds measured up to 6 x 5 cm and were up to 5mm deep and purulent. Every week numerous new skin lesions developed-altogether around 30 smaller wounds. Local therapy with antiseptic agents like octenidine, fucidic acid and diverse wound dressings did not improve the situation. In 3/2010 we started wIRA. The patient was advised to perform this therapeutic procedure at home for at least 4-5 times a week for 30 minutes for each affected localisation. Only two weeks later we could observe considerably pain alleviation with substantially less need for analgesics. In addition, reduction of wound size could be observed and the patient regained range of motion. Only three months after, he showed a 50% improvement concerning wound size, after one more month he showed complete healing. Since then he no more developed any wounds on the shoulder/neck/head area. The patient is still performing wIRA twice a week with continuing improvement of his mobility. In conclusion wIRA is a promising therapy option for bad healing wounds in sclerodermatous GvHD.",

Ashford on behalf of the Cellular Therapy Coding and Labeling Advisory Group ISBT 128 terminology has been widely adopted by cellular therapy facilities globally and its use has been an accreditation requirement by AABB, FACT and JACIE for several years. Accredited facilities are now required to put in place an implementation plan for the full use of ISBT 128 coding and labeling in addition to terminology, and many facilities are moving forward with this implementation. Responding to regulator concern about the use of TC (\"therapeutic cell\") terminology, the Cellular Therapy Coding and Labeling Advisory Group (CTCLAG) re-evaluated existing terminology. As a result of this review, a revision of the terminology was drafted to eliminate the \"TC\" class designation and to create a more consistent format for cellular therapy class terms. The revised terminology also takes into consideration consistency with nomenclature used for tissue products. Changes will not aff ect HPC terminology which represents about 65% of ISBT 128 product description codes. For class names that will change, not all nomenclature changes will result in a change to the ISBT 128 product description code (\"S\" code). While accepting that changing terminology will create rework for facilities that have implemented ISBT 128 and delay for those in the process of implementation, it is felt the revised terminology provides a strong foundation for consistent nomenclature as new products are developed and addresses regulatory concerns. An appropriate timescale for implementation of the revised terminology will be developed. This presentation will describe the revised terminology and explain the reasoning supporting the changes.",

Involvement of all personnel implicated in collection, processing and clinical procedures is absolutely necessary. Involvement includes strategic scheduling of QMS development, writing of SOPs and documents, and implementation of the system. Collaboration between diff erent centers could have advantages and disadvantages. We present the experience of such collaboration in our country. The four major BMT centers of the country had an agreement to collaborate in the establishment of a common QMS and apply for JACIE accreditation. The goal was all the centers to be able to communicate and collaborate in a more efficient way. Centers were located in three different cities. A common strategy was applied. A team of QM specialists was hired to work for the common project. Doctors, nurses, technicians and the QM specialists attended JACIE courses for center preparation. Writing of SOPs and documents was shared between the centers. The duration of the task from the beginning to the fi rst application for JACIE accreditation was four years. The development of the system lasted three years. SOPs and documents written by one center were distributed to the other centers for adjustments according to each center's demands. The total cost was estimated to be 30% lower compared to individual projects for each center separately. The cost was covered by a donation. In contrast, the separation of the tasks and the implication of more than one center were time-consuming. Delay of writing of SOPs in one center could aff ect the whole system. The development of the system is estimated to have lasted 50% more than the expected time. Two of the centers have already applied for JACIE accreditation. Overall, the major benefi t was that doctors, nurses and technicians from diff erent centers collaborated and shared knowledge and experience for a common task. (1), J. Baran (1) (1)Polish Stem Cell Bank (Warsaw, PL); PL) Introduction: Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) is a widely used alternative to bone marrow and a mobilized peripheral blood source of transplantable hematopoietic stem cells in treatment of various disorders. Nowadays, two basic models of UCB banking exist: public (allogeneic donations from volunteers donors) and private (parents deciding to store UCB units in case of need by the donor-child or his/her family). In many countries public UCB banking is not developed, mainly due to insufficient funds. The Polish Stem Cell Bank (PBKM S.A.) decided to start UCB banking for public use in April 2011. In the autumn of the same year some public resources were raised (POLGRAFT -Program for Transplantation Medicine Development). In this paper we present the results of public UCB banking at our company. Materials and methods: Donations were collected from donors, after they mothers had given informed consent. The UCB were transported to the PBKM S.A. After preliminary assessment and qualifi cation, the UCB were processed by volume reduction and red blood cells depletion, followed by controlled-rate cryopreservation in the presence of 10% DMSO as a cryoprotectant. Units were stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen at the monitored temperature of below -150 \u00b0C. The following assay were performed: total nucleated cell number (TNC), CD34+ cell, nucleated red blood cell, viability, as well as blood group, microbial culture, the presence of infectious agents, and HLA typing using molecular methods (PCR-SSP) at low resolution level (loci HLA-A,B and DR). Obtained HLA data were transferred to the database of the Polish Central Potential Unrelated Bone Marrow Donor and Cord Blood Registry and published on Bone Marrow Donor Worldwide websites, making them accessible for physicians all over the world. Results: After two years of UCB banking for public use, we have collected over 900 UCB units. 65% of collected UCB units were qualifi ed for processing, and fi nally more than 400 units were reported. The mean fi nal TNC count and CD34+ count were 101 x 10 7 and 3.2 x 10 6 respectively. Conclusions: The PBKM S.A. is a good model of combined public/ private umbilical cord blood banking. In 2 years, more than 400 UCB units were registered. The costs of these units were covered equally by public resources of POLGRAFT and the PBKM S.A. The quality of UCB units banked for public and private purposes revealed the same quality features, despite the diff erences in the processing for long-term storage.",

The number of HCST made in the last fi ve years was 380, of these, 146(38%) were peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Since november 2010, both centres are accredited by Comit\u00e9 Conjunto de Acreditaci\u00f3n(CCA:JACIE+CAT+ONT) for HCST activity. Aim: Knowing the degree of satisfaction of our clients, in this case, PBSC patients and donors, to be able to detect attitudes or incorrect cares by staff of BSTC during the collection and to be able to resolve them, in order to meet with our policy of continuous improvement. Material And Methods: Since june 2009, every patient and PBSC donor received, just after collection end, one opinion survey with 6 questions about issues like \"information\", \"cares\", \"security\" and \"privacy\" provided by staff of BSTC during apheresis processes. The fi ve possible answers vary from \"very unfavourable(VU)\" to \"very favourable (VF)\". The survey was delivered in stamped envelops intended to answer anonymously. Results: The percentage of opinion surveys answered was 47%(65/139). Of total valid answers (390), 83%(322) were \"VF\" and 15%(58) \"favourable(F)\". Only 2%(8) and 0.5%(2) were valued as \"correct(C)\" and \"unfavourable(U)\" respectively. There were no \"UF\" answers. Related to the specifi c issues, more favourable were \"attention\" and \"security\"(VF: 92%), followed by \"information\"(VF: 80%). \"Privacy\" was the issue than achieved \"VF\" in fewer times(VF: 71%). Conclusions: The opinion surveys are useful tools that allow easily know the satisfaction degree of the users on important issues as attention and security provided to apheresis patients and donors, allowing recognise the weakest points, to establish corrective or improvement actions.",

Conclusion: 85% of patients received fl udarabine based conditioning. When administered as a single agent this may potentially be given in an ambulatory care setting, with resultant cost savings. CMV reactivation accounts for at least 23% of readmissions post-AlloHSCT with median duration >2w. Ganciclovir is fi rstline therapy for CMV reactivation & may be safely delivered as ambulatory care with potential cost reductions & improved patient experience. This may provide better quality of life for patients.",

Plummer, S. Lonial, E. Waller Winship Cancer Institute (Atlanta, US) Background: Randomized clinical trials have shown palifermin reduces the incidence and severity of oral mucositis, TPN use, and use of opioid analgesics in patients with hematological malignancies receiving TBI-based conditioning regimens and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). However, similar outcomes data for patients receiving non-TBI conditioning is inconclusive. Our objective was to determine whether resource utilization including length of stay (LOS), analgesic use, and total transplant costs were diff erent between patients who received palifermin and those who did not in the setting of ASCT following non-TBI based conditioning. Methods: Patient data was retrospectively obtained on 829 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or lymphoma (LY) who received ASCT following non-TBI based conditioning regimens between 1/02 and 12/10. Patients were stratifi ed by diagnosis and multiple linear regression controlled for other diff erences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (age, gender, ethnicity, and conditioning regimen). Results: 598 patients were in the palifermin-treated group (P) and 231 in the control group (C). There were 508 MM pts (389 P; 119 C) and 321 LY pts (209 P; 112 C). MM pts were conditioned with Melphalan and LY pts were conditioned with BEAM (28 P; 6 C), Bu/Cy or Bu/Cy/etoposide (174 P; 106 C), or Melphalan (7 P; 0 C). Two year survival did not diff er between P and C groups. Mean LOS was not signifi cantly diff erent between those who received palifermin and those who did not [MM: 18.7 days (P) vs. 19.1(C); LY: 23.0 (P) vs. 22 .8 (C)]. A sub-set analysis matching 24 C pts with 72 P pts (based upon diagnosis, conditioning regimen, age, and race) found no signifi cant diff erence between the P versus C groups on mean duration of PCA use (0.81 days vs. 0.88 days), mean duration of all analgesic use (8 days vs. 6 days), total PCA dose per day morphine equivalent (58.95 mg vs. 57.39 mg), or total dose of morphine equivalents (634 mg vs. 518 mg). Also, mean total charges incurred for the transplant hospitalization were not signifi cantly diff erent comparing the P vs. C groups, after adjusting for infl ation ($139K (P) vs. $135K (C); P=0.5). Conclusion: In patients receiving non-TBI conditioning regimens and ASCT, palifermin does not signifi cantly decrease length of stay, analgesic use, or total costs associated with ASCT. More detailed quality-of-life endpoints are needed to support palifermin use in the setting of non-TBI conditioning and ASCT.

The cost of transplantation raises the question to how this treatment modality compares economically with standard insulin therapy. So far this question was not addressed for this population of patients and there is only a scarce data for HSCT in autoimmune diseases Aims of the study: We analysed the cost eff ectiveness of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation when compared to the standard insulin therapy. Methods: The retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients with early diabetes type 1 treated with autologous hematopoietic transplantation and patients with diabetes type 1 treated with insulin was performed. Then the CORE model was used for economic analysis. The CORE model is a tool that allows simulation of diabetes type 1 outcome and complications. Simulation with patient data was performed to obtain the QALY and ICER values of the treatment based on observation of patients after transplantation. Results: Series of scenarios using the real patient data were tested with CORE model. The QALY increased in all scenarios. The worst case scenarios assumed that after HSCT full doses of insulin were to be taken by patients and eff ect on HbA1c disappeared after given period of time. In that case if the observed diff erence in HbA1c between transplanted and not transplanted patients could be preserved over 10 years the ICER of the treatment would be still below the threshold value. In the more optimistic scenarios that included patients achieving remission and reduction of doses of insulin in the post transplantation period with the eff ect on HbA1c the ICER was under the threshold values in shorter time frame. Conclusion: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in early diabetes type 1 leads to improvement in QALY and in preliminary analysis show cost-eff ectiveness of HSCT versus standard insulin therapy if the eff ect of the treatment on HbA1c is sustained over few years. The ICER values will be positively aff ected by the reduction of doses of insulin after HSCT and increase of use of expensive long term analogues of insulin in the population of patients with diabetes type 1.",

            "text": "Outpatient-based autologous stem cell transplantation is a safe and eff ective strategy: a single centre experience M. Robinson, M. Lawes Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust (Norfolk, GB) Traditionally the inpatient stay for those undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) is from initiation of conditioning chemoradiotherapy until evidence of bone marrow recovery. Given that blood products are given frequently in our outpatient department and severe neutropenia is not an immediate complication of the procedure, we have designed an outpatient based transplant protocol that allows early discharge. After conditioning and stem-cell re-infusion, patients can be discharged on day +1 if they have (i) an adequate oral intake and require no IV fl uids or medication (ii) have no clinical evidence of infection (iii) access to adequate social support which would allow immediate transport to hospital if required. Prophylactic antimicrobials were given to patients as standard, as well as emergency contact details. Supportive GCSF was not given. Follow up occurred via the specialist nurse-led day unit, three times per week for blood product support and central line care. Patients would be readmitted at any time in their recovery phase if there was evidence of infection or other complications requiring IV therapy. We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients who underwent ASCT following this protocol. The median time for marrow recovery for all patients (defi ned as a neutrophil count of >0.5x109/L) was 14 days . The majority (83.2%) required readmission for treatment of infection. A small group (8.8%) required no inpatient care; the remainder were required to remain as inpatients throughout the entire recovery period as they failed to meet the discharge criteria. After readmission, a median of only seven days (IQR 10-14) was spent as an inpatient in the recovery phase of their transplant. Following our protocol suggests that an average of 7 days in-patient care (IQR 3-12) is saved in comparison to waiting for evidence of marrow recovery before discharge. There was no transplant related mortality from any patient in this cohort, however one death occurred within 100 days due to early disease relapse. Our data suggests that outpatient based ASCT is safe and may benefi t the majority of patients undergoing the procedure. We also suggest it signifi cantly reduces the length of time that patients are required to remain in hospital following stem cell re-infusion. This may confer benefi ts in terms of psychological and nutritional support for those undergoing the procedure and produce institutional savings with regards to cost and bed occupancy. Results of alloHSCT from HLA-identical siblings performed between 2004-2008 for adults with ALL in CR1 were analyzed. Among 983 individuals treated in 27 European countries the median age was 35 (18-55) years and the interval from diagnosis to alloHSCT -158 (42-831) days. TBI was used for conditioning in 820 (83%) cases and peripheral blood was a source of stem cells in 656 (67%) cases. The following factors were studied for their impact on outcome: current HCE, HCE as % of gross domestic product, public HCE, private HCE, no. of physicians, nurses and pharmacists per population, no. of teams per country area and population, HDI and center activity (no. of alloHSCT for ALL in a study period). All variables were categorized by medians. In a univariate analysis the probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was positively infl uenced by current HCE > median (p=0.003), public HCE (p=0.002), higher number of nurses/population (p=0.002) and higher center activity (p=0.04). The incidence of relapse(RI) was decreased for current HCE > median (p=0.001) and higher number of nurses/population (p=0.0001). The incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was reduced for HDI > median (p=0.02) while increased for higher number of teams per population (p=0.03). A tendency was found for increased NRM in centers with lower activity (p=0.06). In a multivariate analysis, adjusted for other potential prognostic factors (age, type of conditioning, CR duration, source of stem cells, donor/recipient gender), current HCE >median was associated with reduced risk of treatment failure (HR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.62-0.97, p=0.03) and reduced risk of relapse (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.5-0.89, p=0.006). Other variables could not be included in the model due to strong internal correlations. We conclude that health care expenditure and related economic factors infl uence results of alloHSCT for adults with ALL. The outcome may also be related to the distribution of transplant centers and the team experience. Our fi ndings may be useful for creating future strategies of transplant development at national levels as well as for interpretation of results of clinical analyses in the fi eld of alloHSCT.

CryoStem has been created to federate all French HSCT unit to be able to collect and store a large number of pre-and post-HSCT samples to study GvHD. The French Society for Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy (SFGM-TC) is the project promoter. CryoStem already brings together 21 HSCT Units and 14 Biological Resources Centers that will contribute to a networked, prospective, longitudinal and standardized HSCT samples collection with a concomitant well documented clinical database. CryoStem has been selected and funded to the extent of 5,5 millions \u20ac over a period of 9 years by the French Government's Investissements d'Avenir program. Patients sampling is scheduled before and after HSCT, depending on the occurrence or not of acute and/or chronic GvHD. Three types of pre-analytical products are processed and stored, according to standardized techniques: viable cells in DMSO, dried cell pellets and plasma. Samples and clinical data are anonymized and centralized in CryoStem-dedicated web-based database application. National projects are the only way to acquire the high number of samples needed for statistically signifi cant results in a reasonable time line. CryoStem thus expect to draw more than 5000 HSCT samples per year. The fi rst partner center is open and includes patients since july 2012. The other centers will open shortly on the whole French territory. Currently, about one hundred patients and related donors have been included within two centers in no more than 3 months.

Value, in this context, is defined as an attribute which adds benefit to the patient. Process improvement strategies based on Lean solutions can cut costs, dramatically reduce processing times and free up valuable staff to undertake more productive work. Such gains can be directly translated into availability of extra capacity and improved patient care. Lean brings a fundamental change in working practices and the thinking behind them. It is an attitude of mind which constantly seeks to challenge and refine every aspect of working life.

Observations were made of variations in key parameters of the patient journey including; arrival to start delay, pre-observations, treatment times and post-observations. Data was collected from 133 ECP treatments and a statistical analysis was performed. The assessment included a review of both process and equipment and how personnel integrated within the work processes. Results: A lack of standardisation in the process resulted in substantial variation in all of the parameters assessed as illustrated below. Bottle-necks and inefficiencies were identified throughout the patient journey resulting in valuable time and capacity not being utilised efficiently. The implementation of Lean working practices, in combination with the Therakos\u2122 Cellex\u00ae instrument, resulted in substantial efficiency and productivity gains with capacity being more fully utilised. The number of daily treatments can be increased in a two-phase approach from an average of 6 per day to 12 and then to 18 with the same number of nurses. Conclusions: Implementation of these new practices means that the number of treatments performed per annum can be increased by 63% and the department can move to a six and then a four day treatment week, compared to seven days previously.

Klein (2) , P.M. Button (2) (1)RTN -Policlinico Tor Vergata (Rome, IT); (2)ProcEx Solutions Ltd. (London, GB) Introduction: The Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Policlinico-Tor-Vergata in Rome provides Extra Corporeal Photophoresis (ECP) for patients presenting with acute and chronic Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) and various dermatological disorders. The centre performs approximately 450 treatments per annum utilising a 5 day treatment week. Currently two processes are used for ECP; Open System (collection of buff y coat with a blood cell separator and irradiation with an external irradiator system) and Therakos Cellex (Closed System). The department desires to move all treatments to the Therakos Cellex system utilising a 2 day treatment week (currently 5 days/week) with minimal changes in cost compared to the current condition. Study: Data was collected and statistically analysed from a total of 149 routine ECP treatments performed in the period July to November 2012 (Open=75, Cellex=74). Parameters assessed included; patient arrival to start delay, pre-observations, treatment times and post-observations. Results: Therakos Cellex off ers a reduction in overall procedural times from 221 to 145 minutes with ECP treatment times reduced from a mean of 192 to 115 minutes: Treating all 447 patients on Therakos Cellex compared to all patients on Open System releases an annual capacity of 76 doctor days and 47 bed days. Conclusions: The Assessment concluded that the Therakos Cellex system off ered substantial improvements in patient treatment times improving patient Quality of Life and substantially increases capacity for more patient treatments with the same number of staff . Improvements in patient safety are off ered with the Therakos system due to the security of the closed system methodology. Activity Based Costing illustrated that a change from the current treatment regime to performing all treatments on Therakos Cellex (n=447), incorporating the application of Lean principles, added a small increase in actual cost (4.4%). A comparison of performing all 447 procedures on either system means a gain of 76 FTE days together with 47 bed days when using Therakos Cellex compared to Open System.

Anagnostopoulos (1) (1)George Papanikolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR); (2)Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Thessaloniki, GR) Objectives: The BMT Unit and the Post-Transplant Unit (PTU) of Hematology Clinics are major consumers of blood products: red blood cells (RBCs), platelets (PLTs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). We estimated the total consumption of blood products in the 328 patient admissions to the BMT Unit and the PTU of our Hospital for 2011. We tried to identify the parameters aff ecting the consumption needs of blood products in both Units. Methods: We evaluated all patients' admissions in relation to the following parameters: days of hospitalization, diagnosis, disease status, transplantation type, conditioning and number of RBCs, PLTs and FFPs consumed. All measurements of blood products follow the rule: Mean blood product unit (MBPU) consumption per day= [Number of blood product units consumed/Total days of hospitalization] x 100. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: 328 admissions corresponded to 4291 hospitalization days. MBPU in the BMT unit were 13. 5 RBCs, 18.2 PLTs, and 15.6 FFPs versus 19.9 RBCs, 26.3 PLTs and 50.6 FFPs in the PTU. Allo-transplanted patients had the highest consumption of RBCs and PLTs vs autoand allo-RIC-transplanted (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001), whereas allo-RIC had the highest consumption of FFPs (p=0.045). No statistically signifi cant diff erence was shown between MBPU of lymphomas and multiple myelomas in the BMT Unit (Mann-Whitney test). Again, no signifi cant diff erence was recorded between MBPU of Hodgkin and NHL in the BMT Unit (Mann-Whitney test). In the PTU, the type of transplantation aff ected the consumption of RBCs (auto: 8.2%, allo: 91.8%, p<0.001) and FFPs (auto: 7.1%, allo: 92.9%, p=0.002, Mann-Whitney test). In the PTU AML patients consumed more RBCs and PLTs, but less FFPs compared to ALL patients (no stat. signifi cant diff erence, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusion: In this study we identifi ed which groups of hematological patients undergoing BMT and which types of diseases require most blood product units in order to minimize the amount of units given to recipients. Such a survey can serve as a tool to estimate in advance the mean annual needs of the BMT Unit and PTU patients and coordinate accordingly the Blood Bank's donations.",

Gonz\u00e1lez, P. Palomo, R. Fern\u00e1ndez, S. Gonz\u00e1lez, C. Ray\u00f3n, C. Vallejo University Central Hospital of Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Objective: to evaluate the pharmacy costs of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Materials and methods: all patients who underwent allo-HSCT due to hematological diseases at the Hematopoietic Transplant Unit of University Central Hospital of Asturias (Spain) between February 2008 and October 2012 were included in this study. The period analyzed is from the moment of admission to hospital for HSCT to discharge from hospital. Total charges for the hospitalization were obtained from medical charts and from the Pharmacy-dispensing software. Medications included: preparative regimens, immunosuppressive therapy, prophylactic treatments and drugs for comorbidities and complications. Fluid therapy was not included.Total costs were calculated using laboratory sale prices (without taxes). Results: a total of 116 patients were transplanted during the period of the study. Characteristics of the series of patients and procedures are shown in table 1. The median hospitalization stay was 33 days (range 8-69), during which 338 different pharmaceutical specialities were prescribed. Nineteen of those specialities accounted for 80% of costs, including thymo globulin (16 % of total prescription cost), busulphan (11 %), voriconazole (6 %) and non-specific immunoglobulins (5 %). The breakdown analysis of drug cost by therapeutic groups showed that group J (anti-infectives for systemic use) was the most expensive category, accounting for 30,9 % of the total cost, followed by group L (anti-neoplastic and immunomodulating agents), accounting for 30,5 % of the total cost. The total median and average costs per patient were 7.722,5 \u20ac and 10.108,8 \u20ac, respectively (range: 1.438-61.805 \u20ac) . Costs of unrelated donor and family donor transplants were similar, while UCBT was more expensive (figure 1). Conclusions: our fi ndings show that allo-HSCT for patients with hematological diseases is a cost-eff ective choice. These fi ndings provide useful information regarding costs of allo-HSCT to physicians, highlighting the challenge faced in the effi cient management of therapeutic resources. S458 P1236 Filgrastim XM02 (Tevagrastim) after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT): favourable cost-effi cacy eff ect in comparison with lenograstim A. Gardellini, F. Gigli, A. Babic, G. Andreola, D. Radice, G. Martinelli, D. Laszlo European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), filgrastim and lenograstim, are recognized to be useful in accelerating engraftment after ASCT. Studies comparing the efficacy of filgrastim and lenograstim demonstrated no difference in this setting. Recently, several forms of biosimilar non-glycosylated G-CSF have been approved by the EMA, with limited published data supporting the clinical equivalence in peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and recovery after ASCT. With the aim to compare the cost-effective strategy in the use of G-CSF after ASCT, we retrospectively evaluated 32 patients cosecutively treated at IEO with biosimilar filgrastim XMO2 (Tevagrastim) and 26 with lenograstim between November 2010 and December 2011. Median age, sex, diagnosis, conditioning regimen and median number of CD34+ reinfused were similar in the two groups. All patients received G-CSG (biosimilar or lenograstim) at the dosage of 5mcg/Kg/day subcoutaneously from day +5 to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1500/mm3 for three consecutive days. Engraftment was defined as ANC > 500/mmc and platelets count > 20.000/mmc. Results: median days to ANC engraftment was 11 days (range 10 -11) for filgrastim XM02 group and 12 days (range 10 -12) for lenograstim group (p 0.055). As for platelets recovery, median days was 12 in both groups with a range of 7-22 for filgrastim XM02 group and 9 -30 for lenograstim group. Median number of G-CSF vials used was 9.5 for Tevagrastim and 10.5 for lenograstim, reflecting a mean estimated cost of about 556.1 (\u00b1 20.0) euros for Tevagrastim versus 932.2 (\u00b1 54.4) euros for lenograstim (p < 0.001). Median days of febrile neutropenia was 1.5 (range 0 -5) and 1 (range 0 -10) for filgrastim XM02 and lenograstim respectively. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range 3 -23) no adverse event related to the use of XM02 filgrastim was recorded. With the growing importance of managing limited healthcare resources, biosimilar G-CSFs may represent a cost-effective strategy; for this reason, clinical results confirming the efficacy of biosimilar G-CSF in any indications as the reference filgrastim are needed. To our knowledge, this is the first experience comparing biosimilar G-CSF to lenograstim after ASCT. In our experience filgrastim XM02 and lenograstim showed comparable efficacy to shorten the period of neutro penia after cytoreduction and ASCT with a favourable cost-effect profile for filgrastim XM02.",
