All dogs in group 1 engrafted and developed donor PBMC and granulocyte chimerism (w4: median 32% (5-44%) and 68% (10-74%), respectively). 4/7 animals remain stable chimeras >w38, 3/7 rejected their graft (w10, w14, w16). All dogs in group 2 engrafted and developed donor PBMC and granulocyte chimerism (w4: median 12% (10-19%) and 19% (11-24%), respectively), but all rejected their grafts later (median w10 (w8-w11)). Dogs in group 3 had a median w4 PBMC and granulocyte chimerism of 13% (8-16%) and 19% (16-27%), respectively. Whereas 4 dogs rejected their grafts (median w10 (w8-w13)), 2/6 dogs remain currently chimeric >w12. Compared to group 1 engraftment kinetics of groups 2&3 indicate a delayed engraftment combined with significantly lower donor chimerism and reduced engraftment duration (group 2). No differences in w4-chimerism patterns between groups 2&3 were observed. Conclusion: Vaccinations with recipient hematopoietic cell lysates failed to expedite long term engraftment following a 1Gy TBI conditioning. However, addition of donor-MoDCs to the graft might favour sustained engraftment.",

Wiesneth, H. Schrezenmeier University of Ulm (Ulm, D) Purpose: Various types of stem cell preparations and their migration and homing patterns have attracted a lot of interest as it has been shown that they can repair organ tissues and functions in different rodent models. One possibility of cell tracing is the use of magnetic particles which can be detected by magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). Factors for cellular uptake are not well characterized. Methods: Different nanoparticles (Feridex\u00ae, Resovist\u00ae, newly synthesized by the miniemulsion process) were used for labeling mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), HeLa and CD34+ peripheral stem cells, as well as cell lines (Jurkat, KG1a). Surface functionalized nanoparticles (carboxyl or amino groups, lysine) were synthesized to evaluate differences in cellular uptake and adhesion. Detection of cell suspensions in 5% gelatin was performed in a standard MRT scanner (1.5 T) . Results: While with Feridex\u00ae a transfection agent (poly-Llysin) had to be used to achieve intracellular uptake Resovist\u00ae was taken up spontaneously by MSC and HeLa, resulting in 10-20 pg Fe/cell. Uptake of magnetic nanoparticles in CD34+ cells, KG1a, Jurkat or Daudi was not detected by Prussian blue staining whereas other groups reported values of around 2 pg Fe/cell for CD34+ cells. Aggregation of nanoparticles -a potential pitfall of labeling -was quantified by sorting cells versus aggregated particles and in some preparations more than 50% of the nanparticles are localized in aggregates. We also set out to elucidate the difference between Resovist and Feridex. Since the type of dextran (Feridex\u00ae: dextran versus Resovist\u00ae: carboxydextran) is the most striking difference between these two magnetic nanoparticles we synthesized nanoparticles with different amounts of carboxylic side groups and showed that carboxyl groups enable cellular uptake. In order to integrate the function of the transfection agent we synthesized particles with lysine or amino groups on the surface. These particles enable cellular uptake in MSCs and attach to the plasma membrane in Jurkat and KG1a as shown by laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In 10 ml gelatin in which 1000 labeled cells were suspended a clinically used MRT scanner (1.5 T) detected single susceptibility spots. Conclusions: This approach enables a rational design of particles and protocols for labeling of different cell populations by nanoparticles and elucidate problems and limitations of these procedures.",

            "text": "Introduction: We previously reported co-infusion of purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from a third party donor, selected as CD34+ (2-2.5x106/kg, CD3<104/kg), as a procedure that significantly reduces neutropenia after single unit cord blood transplantation (CBT). We describe the results of 11 selection procedures of CD133+HSC for similar use. Material and methods: Selections were done from peripheral blood mobilized mononuclear cells; CD34+HSC were also selected from the same donor in 5 cases (CliniMACS inmmunomagnetic method, Miltenyi). Six apheresis products were processed immediately after collection and 5 after 18h storage (22\u00baC, continuous agitation). Cells were incubated with human immunoglobulin before processing (0.15% w/v). Products subjected to CD133+ selection had the following counts (median, range): total nucleated cells (x109) 52. 1 (26.5-66.1) , CD133+ (%) 0.83 (0.37-1.59), CD133+cells (x106) 407. 7 (213.4-609.8 ) and CD3+ (%) 44.64 (28.9-52.9). Standard techniques were used for freezing, storage, thawing and infusion. Six patients received only CD133+HSC and 4 a combination of CD133+and CD34+. Results: CD133 positive fractions had the following counts (median, range): -total nucleated cells 198.4 x106 (84.5-313.1) -CD133+ 97.3 % (79. 1-98. 2) -CD133+ recovery 46.7 % (35.6-71) -CD3+ depletion 4.59 logs (4.5-5.1); CD3 45.7 x104 (18.2-76.8) CD133+ cell recovery was<50% in 6 cases; in one the initial number of processed cells was>60x109, 4 were delayed procedures and 3 had either a high number of processed cells, a low percentage of CD133+cells (<0.4%) or both. One of these products was not infused (low number of CD133+HSC). When both CD133+ and CD34+HSC were selected, median CD133+ recovery was 53.8 % (35.6-62.7) and median CD34+ recovery 66.9 % (49.8-72.8). CD3 depletion logs ranges were 4.5-5.1 (CD133) and 4.53-5.47 (CD34). CD133+ selection is 1 h longer than CD34+selection. Cell recovery and viability of cryopreserved CD133+HSC were adequate for clinical use. Infusions did not result in any untoward effect. Conclusions: CD133+ selection procedure yields enough cells with an adequate CD3 depletion to use in our protocol of dual transplants. CD133+ selection is longer than CD34+ selection, target cell recovery is lower and CD3 depletion, comparable. Factors influencing yields include high number of total processed cells, low proportion of target cells and delayed processing. (Grants PI04/2794 Allostem) M. Schumm, P. Lang, S. Kuci, M. Ebinger, T. Feuchtinger, M. Pfeiffer, R. Handgretinger University Children's Hospital (Tuebingen, D) Introduction: Depletion of T-and B cells by immunomagnetic microbeads is a attractive alternative to stem cell enrichment for transplantation of HLA-mismatched stem cells. However, due to the large number of cells after depletion, residual T cells cannot be detected by standard flow cytometry. We therefore developed a multi-gating strategy using four colour analysis to detect as low as 0,001 percent of T cells in an apheresis product after depletion.",

Results: Fluorescence of CD3+ cells was diminished after incubation with CD3-microbeads for the depletion process. Therefore, APC labelled CD3 antibody showed improved resolution compared to a FITC labelled antibody. In a first step, dead cells were excluded by Propidium Iodide. CD14 and CD33 were used to exclude myeloid cells in a second step and to improve resolution. T cells were determined in a third step by two marker antigens: CD4 or CD8, and CD3 forming a clear and distinct population in the dot plot. Gates were set using cells from the depleted fraction spiked with a small amount of cells from the positive fraction to determine more precisely the level of fluorescence of the wanted cells. B cells were negative for CD19 after incubation with magnetic beads and therefore had to be determined using antibodies against CD20. Conclusion: Standard immunophenotyping is not sufficient to detect residual T and B cells after depletion. Even small deviations in the percentage of detected cells results in large deviations in the number of T cells for the transplant. As a result, graft versus host disease can be induced or in the case that T cells are overestimated, the number of stem cells given might be to low.",

Carste (2), M. Sch\u00f6ffel (1) , R.E. Peter (1) , K.S. G\u00f6tze (1) , E. Schafnitzel (1) , C. Peschel (1) , C. von Schilling (1) (1)TU Munich (Munich, D); (2)Gambro BCT (Lakewood, USA) Objective: More than 16.000 autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplants are performed in Europe annually. Stem cell products need to be cryopreserved according to European Union (EU) Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. This requires expensive and cumbersome GMP clean-rooms and/or laminar flow hoods for cell processing. Our goal was to develop a method that allows for processing and cryopreservation of PBSC within a closed system that fulfils EU-GMP guidelines. Materials and Methods: Patients and donors underwent a total of 17 leukapheresis procedures using a functionally-closed apheresis set (Spectra MNC, Gambro BCT) that contains a pre-attached ACDA and NaCl sterile filter. With use of a sterile connect device (SCD, Terumo), the leukapheresis product was transferred into a blood bag for volume reduction. The product was transferred into freezing bags that are preattached to a new functionally-closed cryopreservation set (CF100-C3, Cell-Max GmbH). DMSO was introduced into the CF100-C3 set via a pre-attached DMSO resistant sterile filter and EVA tubing to achieve a final concentration. Controlled rate freezing was performed according to standard procedures. The integrity of the system was tested both preand post cryopreservation by performing extensive pressure tests. Furthermore, all wet and dry sterile connections were tested according to the German Robert Koch Institute guidelines and were additionally validated by Terumo for tensile strength and air-leakage. Sterility, viability, and recovery tests were performed using the BacT-Alert System (aerobe & anaerobe), flow cytometry, and an automated cell counter respectively. Results: After volume reduction and product transfer, the median cell recovery prior to freezing was 94% . After thawing, the median viability of all 26 cryopreserved products was: lymphocytes 99% (98-100), monocytes 95% (84-99), and CD34+ cells 96% (89-97). All sterility and integrity tests were successful. While the final DMSO concentration was held constant, there was no difference in respect to viability of the Background: Manipulation, for example cryopreservation, of cellular therapeutics carried out in an open system has to be performed in a class A environment and a surrounding class B environment in qualified and validated cleanroom facilities according to international guidelines. Such processing steps performed in a cleanroom area are quite expensive and timeconsuming. We therefore evaluated at two different centers a new closed bag system with an incorporated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-resistant sterile filter for cryopreservation of cellular products outside of cleanroom facilities and outside of a laminar airflow bench. Study Design and Methods: A total of 44 different products (22 buffy coats (bc) and 22 leukaphereses (lk)) were split and processed in parallel in cleanroom facilities (Method I) and with the new closed system on the bench of a \"normal\" laboratory (Method II). Cryopreservation was performed with a controlled rate freezer with a final DMSO concentration of 10%. Viability analyzed by 7-AAD staining and flow cytometric analysis, and sterility of the products were analzyed. Results: For the bc as well as for the lk group, the median viability decreased significantly (p<0.01) for CD45+ cells (before cryopreservation: 99.1% (bc) and 98.9% (lk) versus 83.3% (Method I and Method II each, bc) versus 93.5% (method I, lk) and 94.1% (Method II, lk)), for CD3+ cells (99.8% and 99.1% versus 87.3% and 93.3% versus 91.6% and 86.9%), and for CD14+ cells (99.5% and 99.4% versus 92.7% and 96.6% versus 97.4% and 97.3%) on comparison of the values from freshly analyzed samples with the respective sample after cryopreservation in the cleanroom as well as after cryopreservation in the closed system. For CD19+ cells only for the bc group the decrease was significant (p=0.027, 99.4% versus 97.7%) when comparing the results of the fresh sample with the sample processed with Method I. There was no difference of the viability for the different cellular populations on comparison of products either being processed with Method I or with Method II. Sterility testing of fresh products as well as of samples directly before cryopreservation as well as of samples from the cryopreserved and thawed product was negative independent of the processing modus in or outside cleanroom areas. Conclusion: The new closed system for cryopreservation of cellular products seems to be equivalent to \"standard\" cleanroom-based methods regarding cellular integrity and sterility.",

            "text": "The success of adoptive transfer of anti-tumor CTL lines depends on the number of infused cells and on their long-term survival and proliferating capacity in vivo. We have demonstrated the possibility of generating and expanding in vitro a large number of long term CTL lines, directed towards different types of acute leukemia blasts (LB), to be employed in approaches of adoptive immunotherapy aimed at preventing/treating leukemia relapse after allogeneic HSCT. Anti-leukemia CTL lines were generated from CD8-enriched donor T lymphocytes stimulated with donor-derived immature DC pulsed with patients leukemia blasts (LB), in the presence of IL-12 and IL-7 during the primary cultures. Cultures were expanded by means of three rounds of leukemia-specific stimulation and one round of antigen-independent expansion supported by low doses of IL-2. It has been recently demonstrated, that common gamma-chain cytokines, in particular IL-7 and IL-15 can promote T-cell proliferation and are required for the development or maintenance of memory T cells. Based on these data, in this study we evaluated the possibility of modulating the anti-leukemia response, in terms of specificity and phenotypic characteristics of CTLs, using common gamma-chain cytokines (IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15) at different phases of the in vitro induction and expansion of anti-leukaemia CTL lines. In particular, anti-leukemia CTL lines supported with the different cytokines were compared for i) levels of the in vitro proliferation and cytotoxic activity against both patient LB or non malignant cells, and ii) the distribution of T memory and effector subsets. We found that, even though sizeable levels of anti-leukemia T-cell response can be obtained in all cultures, the use of different cytokines during the various phases of the induction of antileukemia CTL response allows us to modulate not only the expansion rate of anti-leukaemia CTLs and their leukaemia-directed cytotoxicity, but also the percentage and the absolute number of T memory and effector cells, without loss of specificity. In A major complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by mature donor T cells in the stem cell graft. Prophylactic treatment of GVHD usually comprises immunosuppressive medication including cyclosporine A (CsA) that blocks calcineurin phosphatase activity and thereby inhibits nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-mediated cytokine production. CD4+CD25+ natural regulatory T (Treg) cells have been shown to suppress the proliferation and cytokine secretion of conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and to protect from GVHD lethality in murine models of allogeneic BMT. As the adoptive transfer of human CD4+CD25+ Treg cells as a means of GVHD prophylaxis is currently under debate, we aimed to explore the influence of CsA on survival, cytokine production and suppressive activity of this T cell subpopulation. To this end, in vitro expanded human CD4+CD25high and CD4+CD25-T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and simultaneously exposed to CsA. While T cell death occurred in both in vitro expanded subpopulations at high CsA concentrations (1000 ng/ml), CD4+CD25high T cells showed enhanced resistence to intermediate CsA concentrations. At 100 ng/ml, CsA blocked the proliferation of the two subpopulations after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation and inhibited their cytokine production in response to PMA/ionomycin. Addition of exogenous IL-2 protected both subpopulations from CsA-induced cell death and restored their proliferative capacity but was unable to abrogate the block in cytokine production. Surprisingly, the suppressive activity of in vitro expanded CD4+CD25+ Treg cells was neither affected by a pre-incubation of the cells with 100 ng/ml CsA, nor by its presence during the suppression assay. In summary, these results indicate that in vitro expanded CD4+CD25+ Treg cells are less sensitive to CsA-induced apoptosis and their -yet unknown -mechanism of suppression does not involve the calcineurin pathway.",

            "text": "The down-regulation of IL1alpha and IL6, in monocytes exposed to extracorporeal photopheresis-treated lymphocytes, is not dependent on phosphatidylserine externalisation J. Bladon, P. Taylor Rotherham General Hospital (Rotherham,UK) Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an apheresis-based procedure, whereby isolated peripheral blood leucocytes are exposed to 8 Methoxpsoralen and UVA light and subsequently re-infused back to the patient. ECP has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and various steroid-refractory inflammatory conditions, including acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). ECP induces apoptosis in treated lymphocytes and directly reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in both monocytes and T cells. More recently, an indirect role for ECP-treated lymphocytes has been proposed, whereby untreated monocytes, exposed to ECP-treated lymphocytes, down-regulate production of some pro-inflammatory cytokines. During early apoptosis, phosphatidylserine (PS) residues are externalised on the cell membrane. Exposed PS is a potent recognition site for phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells (APC's). Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, by APC's, reduces the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines they produce. This study attempted to establish if the monocyte immunosuppression, observed in untreated monocytes exposed to ECP-treated lymphocytes, was linked to PS externalisation (detected using Annexin V) on the apoptotic lymphocytes. Using density gradient and magnetic separation, lymphocytes were isolated from 3 CTCL and 9 chronic GvHD patients pre ECP and prior to re-infusion (post ECP). The collected lymphocytes were cultured overnight and Annexin V levels determined using flow cytometry. Peripheral blood was taken from the same patient 20 hours later and the monocytes were isolated. The 'fresh' monocytes were introduced to each 20 hour pre and post ECP lymphocyte culture and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Brefeldin A for 5 hours. The monocytes were subsequently tested for intracellular TNFalpha, IL1alpha, IL1beta, IL6 and IL8, using flow cytometry. CTCL patients demonstrated no statistical change in monocyte cytokine expression, between the pre and post ECP cultures. For chronic GvHD patients, the relative levels of IL1alpha and IL6 were significantly reduced in untreated monocytes exposed to post ECP lymphocytes. However, the down-regulation of IL1alpha and IL6 did not correlate with the levels of Annexin V-positive lymphocytes. ECP-treated lymphocytes can reduce the ability of untreated monocytes to produce some pro-inflammatory cytokines; however this effect is not dependent on phosphatidylserine externalisation. P. Hoffmann, R. Eder, B. Piseshka, T. Boeld, J. Albrecht, K. Doser, E. Orso, A. Dada, R. Andreesen, E. Holler , M. Edinger University Hospital Regensburg (Regensburg, D) Donor derived CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells do not induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but suppress GVHD induced by CD25-conventional T (Tconv) cells when cotransplanted at a 1:1 ratio in murine model systems. Purified human CD4+CD25+ Treg cells display similar phenotypic and functional characteristics as their murine counterparts, i.e. they constitutively express high levels of intracellular CTLA-4, preferentially express the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor FOXP3, they are anergic to T cell receptor-mediated stimulation, and they suppress the proliferation of Tconv cells after polyclonal or allogeneic activation in vitro. Thus, their adoptive transfer is a promising strategy for the prevention of GVHD in patients after allogeneic BMT. For potential clinical applications, we now developed a protocol for the large-scale isolation of human CD4+CD25+ Treg cells from leukapheresis products of healthy volunteers using the CliniMACS\u00ae device. In six cell separations performed under GMP-conditions, B cell depletion with CD19-beads, followed by three cycles of CD25enrichment resulted in on average 91.5 % pure CD4+CD25+ T cells (range 85.2 to 95.6 %). Positively selected cells constituted on average 1.72 % of the initial MNC (range 0.89 to 2.47 %), resulting in absolute numbers of 63 to 262 x 10 6 cells, depending on the initial size of the leukapheresis product. Since it has been suggested that Treg cells are predominantly found within CD4+CD25high T cells, we further determined their proportion within the generated cell products. CD4+CD25high T cells represented on average 49.5 % of the purified cell population (range 30.3 to 63.1 %) as compared to 1.9 % (range 1.1 to 2.9 %) within the MNC of the leukapheresis products. CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated according to this GMP protocol were highly enriched in CTLA-In allogeneic transplantation it is a major goal to maintain a stable long term engraftment. However, viral infections, drug toxicity or low stem cell numbers may hamper hematopoiesis. In this retrospective analysis, the efficacy of additional stem cell donations (boosts) with highly purified peripheral stem cells from matched unrelated or from haploidentical related donors was evaluated in pediatric patients with stagnant hematopoiesis (<1500 leucocytes or <50 000 platelets between 30-90 days posttransplant, n=11) or with initially increasing and then decreasing hematopoiesis (n=3). Patients with graft rejection or hemophagocytosis were excluded. Diagnoses were: acute leukemias (n=10), nonmalignant diseases (n=4). Most boosts were taken from the original graft: if the grafts contained >10x10 6 (unrelated donors) or >20x10 6 /kg BW CD34+ cells, surplus stem cells were purified with an immunomagnetic selection method using antiCD34 or antiCD133 coated microbeads and cryopreserved. Three haploidentical donors were asked for a second donation. Our aim was to maintain stable and complete hematopoiesis without inducing GvHD. A total of 18 boosts were given between 30 and 290 days after transplantation with a median number of 5 (0.6-34) x10 6 CD34+/CD133+ progenitor cells/kg and only 2200 (100-25000) residual T-cells/kg. All patients had a complete donor chimerism and no reconditioning or posttransplant pharmacological immunosuppression was administered. Patients who received G-CSF were excluded. Due to the low number of T-cells, acute GvHD >grade I and also chronic GvHD could be completely avoided. Leukocytes, neutrophiles, lymphocytes (and platelet counts in patients with thrombocytopenia) within the week before infusion of the boosts were compared with cell counts 4 and 8 weeks after infusion, using the paired T-test. A significant increase of all cell counts was observed (median numbers pre boosting: 900/\u00b5l, 312/\u00b5l, 142/\u00b5l; 4 weeks post boosting: 2065/\u00b5l, 1264/\u00b5l, 317/\u00b5l; 8 weeks post boosting:2570/\u00b5l, 1780/\u00b5l, 385/\u00b5l; p<0.05 for all comparisons). Furthermore, independence from platelet and erythrocyte transfusion could be achieved. Conclusions: Boosts with purified stem cells and low T-cell contamination (<10000 T-cells/kg) can be administered after transplantation without the risk of inducing GvHD, even in mismatched donors. No pharmacological immunosuppression was necessary. Thus, the method is safe and can improve donor derived hematopoiesis.",

Niederwieser, S. Tschiedel University of Leipzig (Leipzig, D) Objective: The minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) HA-1 derives from a polymorphic protein and is presented on HLA-A02. Due to its restricted tissue distribution, HA-1 induces potent graft-versus-tumor reactions after hematopoetic cell transplantation (HCT). Adoptive transfer of ex vivo generated HA-1 specific oligoclonal T-cells could therefore become a curative tool in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Methods: T-cell lines were established from PBMC of unprimed HLA-A2+, HA-1R healthy blood donors and from invivo sensitised HLA-A2+, HA-1H patients after HLA-identical, HA-1-mismatched allogeneic HCT. PBMCs were stimulated with HA-1 peptide pulsed autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs) and specifity for HA-1 was tested with the Elispot and Cr-release assay. Furthermore HA-1 specific T-cells were quantified using HA-1H/HLA-A02 tetramers. Results: HA-1 specific T-cell lines were established from both primed and unprimed individuals, and expanded up to 100fold over 4 weeks of culture. Both groups yielded T-cell lines which could be generated that recognized HA-1 peptide pulsed target cells but showed little or no response to the natural ligand. However, in each group we also obtained T-cell lines that recognized both peptide-pulsed target cells and the natural ligand. Neither changes of the APCs, nor reduction of HA-1 peptide concentration, nor depletion of CD4+-T-helper cells were found to have a major influence on the incidence of these two recognition patterns. The level of HA-1 specific Tcells within the cell lines was assessed by weekly tetramer analyses. A maximum of 15% HA-1 specific CD8+ T-cells was detected up to d28 of culture. After this point, however, a dramatic increase was observed with up to 55% HA-1 specific T-cells at d35 and 70% at d70. Altough tetramer staining proved to be more sensitive than Elispot at detecting and quantifying HA-1 specific T-cells, it was not a clear indicator of the ability of T-cells to recognize the natural ligand. Functional analysis therefore remains the domain of the Elispot and Cr release assay. Conclusions: HA-1 specific T-cell lines can be generated in vitro in numbers sufficient for adoptive immunotherapy. Both the Elispot assay and tetramer staining are necessary to monitor the development of HA-1 specifity. The determination of factors which reliably induce reactivity to the natural ligand remains a key challenge. vivo.",

Remes Turku University Central Hospital (Turku, FIN) Background: Oral mucositis is often the most inconvenient and painful complication of high-dose therapy. Palifermin (recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor) has, however, recently been shown to give protection against mucosal damage after intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Spielberger et al 2004) . It would be most valuable to identify the patients at highest risk for mucosal damage and to whom palifermin therapy would be most beneficial. Patients and methods: The incidence of oral mucositis and lower gastrointestinal tract toxicity after high-dose chemotherapy alone or in combination with total body irradiation (TBI) was evaluated prospectively in 284 consecutive autologous transplantations for multiple myeloma (n=153) and lymphoma (n=131). As conditioning, 127 patients received high-dose melphalan (HDM), 121 BEAM and 32 TBI plus HDM /cyclophosphamide (HDCY). Severity of oral Recently, we and others have shown in mice that depletion of regulatory/suppressor T-cells, contained within the CD4+CD25 high cell fraction led to increased effector T-cell functions. Moreover, we showed using a murine model of bone marrow transplantation that depletion of regulatory/suppressor T-cells before grafting was associated with an increase of the alloreactivity. Similarly, we have shown that depletion of human regulatory/suppressor T-cells from total T-cells and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells also led to increased effector T-cell functions. Subsequently, CD25 depletion can be envisioned for improving the anti-tumor properties of other T-cells. Using good manufacturing practices, we report here the validation of large-scale CD25 Tcell depletion from leukapheresis products collected from 3 healthy volunteers. The initial number of cells collected after one blood mass (the 2 first donors) and two blood mass (third donor) were 8x10 9 and 17x10 9 cells, respectively. After platelet removal, cells were stained with anti-CD25 magnetic microbeads, using a CliniMACS device (Myltenyi Biotech) negative fractions (i.e. CD25-depleted) were harvested. Aliquots obtained before and after depletion were studied for various quality controls: viability, cell numbers, immunophenotyping, Foxp3 expression, T-cell proliferative responses to allogeneic stimulation and microbiological tests. After depletion, the mean cell viability was 98.7\u00b10.3% and the number of recovered CD3+ cells was 0.99x10 9 (donors 1 and 2) and 4.4x10 9 (donor 3). Comparison of the initial (after platelet removal) fraction and the negative fraction showed a mean cell recovery of 71\u00b11.5% and a mean CD25-depletion of 99.2\u00b10.6%. The latter was correlated to a ~200 fold decrease of Foxp3 expression assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. The mean duration of the selection procedure (leukapheresis excluded) allowing the release of the clinical product was ~6 hours. No contamination after 10 days of culture was observed. Overall, these data permit to validate the reproducibility of the technique and to finalize the batch release specifications: cell viability \u2265 80%; percent of CD4+CD25+ cell depletion \u2265 90 %; number of infused CD3+ cells \u2265 2x10 6 cells/kg. This strategy of regulatory/suppressor T-cell depletion is now under clinical investigation with the aim to enhance the anti-tumor effect of donor T-cells.",

Glass Georg-August-University (Goettingen, D) The NK cell repertoire consists of clonally distributed NK cells of which each NK cell subpopulation has their own inhibitory receptor repertoire. We determined the genotypic and phenotypic repertoire of inhibitory receptors and their ligands in an individual. This gives an expected proportion of the bulk NK cells that should be inhibited by target cells expressing single ligands to these receptors. We confirmed this with functional analysis of the reactivity of same bulk NK cells. KIR genotyping was performed on donors DNA by PCR amplification of KIR genes and KIR specific PCR-SSP typing. HLA class I expression of HLA genotyped target cells was confirmed by flow-cytometry (FACS). Multi-colour FACS analysis of immuno-magnetically isolated NK cells gave the phenotype of inhibitory receptors of the NK cell repertoire. Granzyme B ELISPOT assay was used for measurement of NK cell reactivity and detection of reactive NK cells in bulk population. HLA type of NK cell donor is HLA*A3,32 (ligand to 3DL2); HLA*B7,44 (Bw4; ligand to 3DL1); HLA*Cw5,7 (C group 1 and 2; ligands to 2DL1 and 2DL3).

Incidence of NK cells from bulk population with indicated inhibitory receptor repertoire: 2DL1 5,35%; 2DL1 and 2DL3 4,65%; 2DL1 and 3DL1 4,53%; 2DL1 and NKG2A 6,11%; 2DL1, 2DL3 and 3DL1 2,48%; 2DL1, 3DL1 and NKG2A 3,14%; 2DL1, 2DL3 and NKG2A 2,55%; 2DL1 2DL3, 3DL1 and NKG2A 1,8%; 2DL3 4%; 2DL3 and 3DL1 3,03%; 2DL3 and NKG2A 5,64%; 2DL3, 3DL1 and NKG2A 2,06%; 3DL1 6,48%; 3DL1 and NKG2A 9,19%; NKG2A 31,64%. Giving cumulative 62,25% expected to be inhibited by targets expressing HLA C group 1 and 57,85% expected to be inhibited by HLA C group 2. In GrB ELISPOT bulk NK cells are inhibited from maximum activity by targets highly expressing HLA C group 1 73% , 71% by group 2 and completely (100%) by targets expressing all ligands to inhibitory receptors. For the first time the (near to) complete NK cell repertoire with their diverse inhibitory receptors in an individual is described: from genotype to phenotypic expression of the subpopulations. This correlated well with functional activity and inhibition against target cells with distinct ligands to the inhibitory NK cell recetors. This data supports evidence for the KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch hypothesis of NK cell allo-reactivity: Allo-reactivity occurs, if a ligand of a KIR on the NK cells is missing on the target cells.",

This MoAb cross links CD3-positive T cells with EpCAM-positive tumor cells and Fc-receptor bearing antigen presenting cells to induce tumor cell lysis. Patients and methods: Four patients with EpCAM-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas refractory to standard radio-/chemotherapy underwent lymphocytapheresis using a COBE Spectra cell separator. After immunotyping lymphocytes were divided in 4 portions and cryopreserved using DMSO. For therapy the cells were thawed, opsonised with catumaxomab-antibodies, incubated at +37\u00b0C for 24 hours and subsequently washed to remove cytokine containing supernatant to prevent severe side effects. Patients received 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 and 10 7 CD3-positive MoAb-opsonised autologous lymphocytes per kg intravenously in 14-day intervals. Quality controls including immunophenotyping, sterility test and functional analysis by elispot assays for IFNgamma and granzyme B production were done for each administration. Results: Only patient I and IV showed slight side effects with shivering and tachycardia after the infusion of the highest cell dose which responded promptly to steroid treatment. Patient I is now two years with stable disease and improvement of quality of life and back to work. Patient II and III died within three months after treatment due to disease progression and patient IV is not evaluable. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show, that opsonisation of autologous lymphocytes with MoAb is feasible and safe. The use of anti-tumor specific MoAb in combination with DLI may improve the effect of DLI in the allogeneic transplant setting without increasing the risk of GvHD. Further studies are necessary to answer this decisive question.",

            "text": "Objectives: Major ABO mismatch in allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) can cause several clinical complications. These include hemolysis and delay of the erythroid engraftment which in turn can lead to pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Major ABO mismatch occurs when the recipient's antibodies are directed against the graft RBCs and thus the host's RBCs after engraftment. The literature cites several modes of treatment including plasma exchange and immunosuppressive treatment with varying results and more recently anti-CD20 (Rituximab) in a few patients. We administered Rituximab as first line treatment to our patient. Case Report: A 41 year-old male case of Myelodysplasia, refractory anemia with excess blasts, was admitted for allogeneic BMT after receiving one cycle of induction chemotherapy with Idarubicine and Cytarabine. Conditioning regimen consisted of IV Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis by cyclosporine and methotrexate. The patient was O positive and the BMT was from his HLA-identical sister of blood group A positive. The donor was heterozygous for B-thalassemia. Successful engraftment of both granulocytes and platelets was observed on day + 26. However, the patient remained transfusion dependant with a reticulocyte count less than 0.2% and bone marrow aspirate revealed decreased erythropoiesis. FISH analysis of the bone marrow aspirate on day + 30 and day + 100 showed full chimerism with 100% Donor cells. The blood group was strictly O positive with anti-A antibodies. The patient also developed progressive renal failure despite the tapering and stopping of cyclosporine at 6 months post BMT. The patient was then administered rituximab at the dose of 375 mg/m\u00b2 for four consecutive weeks. Results: The patient's blood group shifted to A positive with complete disappearance of the anti-A agglutinins. The reticulocyte count and hemoglobin level both started to increase progressively reaching 5% and 10.5 gm/dL on day + 7 from the end of rituximab treatment (day + 200 from BMT). The creatinine level also progressively returned to normal. No side effects of rituximab were observed. Conclusion: Rituximab administration is safe and effective as first line modality of treatment in PRCA secondary to major ABO mismatch in allogeneic BMT.",

Liepert (1) , N. Hentschel (1) , C. Schmid (1) , T. Kroell (1) , S. Kufner (1) , H. Salih (2), S. Kaiser (1) , F. delValle (3) Leukemic antigen presentations be improved by conversion of leukemic cells in leukemia-derived DC (DCleu), thereby enabling the generation of leukemia-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). We could already generate DCleu from mononuclear cells (MNC) in AML and MDS under serum-free conditions, stimulate autologous T-cells and create CTL (Kufner et al, 2005) . DC/ DCleu were qualified and quantified according to their DC / blast -marker profiles (FACS) or by a combined FISH/Immunophenotyping. The generation of DC was regarded as successful if more than 10% DC were generable from MNC, DCleu had to show the coexpression of a suitable blast marker and a DC marker on more than 20% of the DC. In 6/30% of cases with AML/MDS less than 10% of DC could be generated and only 50-60% of leukemic cells were convertible to DCleu . The aim of this study was to generate DCleu in every patient using 5 alternative methods in 99 AML and 55 MDS-patients: (1) ' MCM-mimic' (Lee, 2003) , 2) 'Ca-Ionophore' (Houtenbos, 2003) , 3) 'Picibanil' (Sato, 2003) , 4) 'Cytokines' (Westers, 2003) and 5) 'Poly I:C' (Rouas, 2004) . Results: 1)The percentual harvest of DC/ DCleu was comparable in all methods, but not successful with all methods in individual patients: Depending on the 5 methods on average 28-31%/22-42% DC in AML/MDS were generated with 42-50% mature (CD83+) , 31-37%/21-45% migratory (CCR7+) DC and 47-60%/44-60%DCleu proportions of DC (total proportions of DCleu after culture: 9-12%/8-32%). 2)However DC can be generated from every sample with at least one of the following methods: MCM-mimic, Ca-Ionophore and Picibanil. 3)In all methods DC/ DCleu yields were independent of the cytogenetic risk group and highest in monocytoid differentiated FAB-types 4)Many 'DC-surface markers' are already expressed on naive blasts. On DC the expression is variable depending on individual patients and culture methods. Summary: 1)The generation and quantification of DCleu is possible under serum-free conditions in every AML/MDSpatient -independent from FAB-or karyotype. 2)Although the overall percentual harvest of DCleu after culture is low autologous anti-leukemic CTL can be generated after MLR with leukemic DC. 3)The generability and quality of DCleu should regularily be tested. 4)MLR of DCleu with autologous or allogeneicT or NK-cells could contribute to define the specific T/NK-activating or inhibitory potential and contribute to develop optimized immunotherapeutic approaches in AML/MDS.",

Ibig-Rehm, G. Prinz, J. Finke University Hospital Freiburg (Freiburg, D) Human regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells (Treg) have been shown to suppress activation and proliferation of alloreactive T cells in vitro. Animal models suggest a role for Treg in prevention of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) together with sustained Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL) activity in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We examined several human blood products as cell sources for isolation of Treg using magnetic anti-CD25 coated beads together with AutoMACS devices. Functionality of isolated Tregs were determined by MLR (1:1 ratio of CD4+CD25+ to CD4+CD25-) using allogeneic PBMC or OKT3 as stimulators. Single CD25+ bead separation of buffy coats or leukapheresis products w/o prior G-CSF mobilisation resulted in populations containing 70-80% CD4+CD25+ (52-64% CD25high) T cells. Despite coseparated CD8+ and CD19+ cells, this CD25+ population did not proliferate upon activation by cellular or antibody stimuli. However, Treg from buffy coat or unmobilized leukapheresis products did suppress proliferation of syngeneic CD4+CD25-T cells stimulated by allogeneic PBMC or OKT3. In contrast, although Treg from G-CSF leukapheresis products still remain anergic upon stimulation they do supress much less efficient the proliferation of CD4+CD25-T cells from the same cell product or from unstimulated blood of the same donor in allogeneic MLR or by OKT3 activation. This functional defect of G-CSF Treg correlates with G-CSF induced downregulation of CD62L on Treg and on CD4+CD25-T cells. Additionally it could be shown that reduced suppressive capacity of Tregs is only a result of 5 day in vivo G-CSF stimulation, since the presence of G-CSF in suppression assays of untreated T cells did not interfere with Treg mediated suppression. Further early results imply monocytes as mediators of G-CSF Treg functionality, since depletion of CD14+ cells restored full suppressive capacity of G-CSF Treg towards syngeneic CD4+CD25-T cells. This data show that highly pure enrichment of CD25high T cells is not critical for suppressive Treg function in CD25+ single separated cell fractions and that in vivo G-CSF treatment results in reduced suppressive capacity of Treg. These findings imply certain cell sources and separation strategies for generation of Treg cell products for clinical application. In addition, the reduced function of G-CSF Treg could be involved in pathogenesis of acute or chronic GvHD after allogeneic peripheral HSCT.",

Gastl, D. Nachbaur Medical University Innsbruck (Innsbruck, A) To define the role of graft composition parameters, i.e., the number of mononuclear cells (MNC), CD34+ cells, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, for outcome after HLA-identical sibling peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), we retrospectively analysed 43 consecutive transplants performed for haematological malignancies. Twenty-four patients received myeloablative conditioning and nineteen patients received busulfan/fludarabine based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Univariate analyses were performed for overall survival (OS), relapse incidence (RI), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) . Only in the RIC subgroup a significant impact of graft composition was found: OS was superior in recipients of high T cell (0.83 vs. 0.37; p=0.01) and MNC doses (0.88 vs. 0.28; p=0.024). A trend towards reduced RI was found in patients receiving high numbers of NK cells (0.16 vs. 0.54; p=0.09) . NRM was significantly reduced in patients receiving high T cell or MNC doses (0.00 vs. 0.33; p = 0.046). By multivariate analysis comprising both conditioning subgroups, superior OS was associated with standard risk disease (p=0.002). The probability of relapse was significantly decreased in case of a high CD34+ cell dose (p=0.024) and NK cell dose (p=0.046). The risk for NRM was increased in patients at high risk by the underlying disease (p=0.034) and recipient CMV seropositivity (p=0.029). These data suggest a role for graft composition on outcome following allogeneic PBSCT, particularly in patients undergoing RIC transplantation. Yet, the latter warrants confirmation by further studies.",

For further analysis of the outcome in these patients we have compared the clinical results of our transplanted HD HIV+ patients (pt) with a matched cohort of transplanted HD HIV-pt. Patients and Methods: Since June 2000 five transplanted HD HIV+ pt and 10 transplanted HD HIV-pt were consecutively included. Both groups (HIV+ vs HIV-) were similar for the most relevant clinical characteristics (p value Mann-Whitney test or chi-square test > 0.05): median age, Ann Arbor advanced stage, status at ASCT, chemotherapy before ASCT. BEAM was used as conditioning regimen in all 15 pt. In HD HIV+ pt HAART was maintained during mobilization and ASCT, except during the conditioning in 1 Pt, wich was necessary to resume due to an increase in viral load. A median of 3,3 CD34+ cells/kg were infused in HIV+ pt and 4,9 CD34+ cells/kg in HIV-pt (p: ns). We used G-CSF in all HIV+ pt until engraftment starting at a median of 8 days after ASCT. Results: All 15 pt engrafted, at a median of 14 (11-29) days (d) after ASCT in HIV+ pt and 14,5 (11-18) d in HIV-pt. The incidence of acute infectious and toxic events were not different in both groups. All pt developed neutropenic fever. The documented infections were (HIV+ vs HIV-): Gram+ (2 vs 3), Gram-(1 vs 0), CMV (2 vs 1). Pneumonia was documented in one pt of each group. 1 HIV+ pt showed liver toxicity grade II and grade II renal toxicity occurred in 1 HIVpt. All events were succesfully resolved. In 2 HIV+ pt HAART was discontinued due to gastrointestinal toxicity. The median follow up was 27m. Two pt relapsed in each group and 3 died due to disease progression (2 HIV-pt and 1 HIV+ pt). The event free survival was 40% in HIV+ pt and 77% in 41) . Overall survival was not different, 80% in HIV+ pt and 78% in HIV-pt. Conclusions: Our results showed that the clinical outcomes are similar in HD HIV+ and HD HIV-pt undergoing ASCT. Engraftment, infectious and toxic events and survival were not statistically different. ASCT may be applied with guarantees on patients diagnosed with HD and AIDS as long as HAART is maintained in a similar manner to the HIV-negative setting.",

Wiesneth, J. Greiner, M. Ringhoffer University Hospital Ulm (Ulm, D) Objective: T cell generation through the thymus after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is assessable by the measurement of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). However, the reliability of the TREC assays has often been hampered by TREC dilution due to an antigen driven lymphocyte proliferation in the periphery. Recently, a more specific method for TREC assessment has been reported in HIV patients (pts), which correlates DbJb-TRECs with sjTRECs and is therefore independent of peripheral T cell dilution (Dion et al.,Immunity 2004) . However this method is cost and labour intense. We report an economical assay which allows the quantification of DbJb-TREC and sjTRECs with a reduced necessity of cloning for the standard set-up procedure and with less numbers of total PCR rounds. Methods: We generated three different standards by cloning a part of the sjTREC gene or of a consensus sequence of the Db1Jb1 or Db2Jb2 gene family together with a part of the CD3 gene into a plasmid vector. As TREC source we used peripheral blood lymphocytes which have been purified by CD3+ cell positive selection. We performed a two round-PCR which consisted of a multiplex 1st-round and of a quantitative Light-Cycler based 2nd-round-PCR in a nested fashion. To guarantee the comparability between the experiments the resulting copy numbers of the sjTRECs and DbJb-TRECs were adjusted to the same number of CD3+ cells. Results: By a set of independent experiments we obtained a mean standard deviation of the respective standard curve crossing points of 0.38 (sjTRECs), 0.31 (Db1Jb1) and 0.35 (Db2Jb2) cycles. The sensitivity of our assay was 1 / 10 5 cells. The median of sjTRECs in healthy volunteers (n=16, median age 35 y) was 509 copy numbers /10 5 CD3+ cells. As expected the onset of sjTREC production in the pts, who mostly received T cell depleted grafts(n=24, median age 46 y) was after 3 months but only a limited number of values normalized during the first year. Dbjb-TREC production was detectable in 11/24 pts. The sjTREC/Dbjb-TREC ratio of the healthy volunteers was 54, this value has not been reached in any of the transplanted pts during the first year after transplantation. Conclusion: Our newly developed assay was reproducible and showed a high sensitivity. It might by particularly useful in the assessment of thymical damage caused by the conditioning prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and of potential interventions to enhance the immune reconstitution.",

The role of the graft content of regulatory T-cells in patients undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains elusive so far. In addition, the role of post-transplant levels of Treg in the peripheral blood of recipients as surrogate marker for Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risk is currently debated. We analyzed the content of Treg in peripheral blood stem cell grafts isolated from 21 HLA-identical sibling donors. Moreover, Treg were monitored in the peripheral blood of the recipients on day 30, 60, 90, and 180 after SCT by FACS staining of CD4, CD25, CD45RO and CD69.

A median of 20.72x10 6 (5.47-106.2) Treg per kg body weight (bw) of the recipient were transplanted. No correlation between the graft content of Treg with either MNC, CD3+ T-cells, CD56+ NK cells or CD34+ stem cells numbers in the graft was observed. In addition, Treg numbers in the graft did not significantly correlate with post-transplant levels of Treg measured on days 30, 60, 90, and 180, respectively. Using the median value of Treg as cut off-point, recipients receiving grafts containing low Treg numbers had a 73% cumulative incidence of acute GVHD vs 40% for high Treg number recipients. Contrary, the risk of relapse was 18% for patients receiving low Treg numbers vs 40% for patients receiving high Treg numbers. No correlation of post-transplant Treg numbers at any time point measured was found with incidence of acute or chronic GVHD, relapse or CMVinfection. These preliminary results suggest that the number of TREG within the graft might have an impact on acute GVHD and relapse following HLA-identical sibling PBSCT. M. Nonn, M. Todorova, I. Link, S. Khan, T. C. Wehler, I. Gockel, R. G. Meyer, C. Huber, W. Herr, U. F. Hartwig Hematology and Oncology (Mainz, D) Donor T lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease. However, they concomitantly support engraftment, mediate immunity to pathogens, and reduce the risk of relapse by inducing the graft-versusleukemia effect. Strategies which allow enrichment of leukemia/tumor-specific donor lymphocytes while selectively eliminating alloreactivity are thus of central interest. We intended to expand and to characterize primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts to be used as non-professional antigenpresenting cells (APC) for stimulation and subsequent CD137 mediated depletion of contaminating allospecificities within acute myeloid leukemia or renal cell carcinoma driven donor T cell lines (see concomitant abstract by T.C. Wehler et al.) . Skin biopsies obtained from surgical procedures (foreskin and adult skin of different body regions) were used to establish human serum free epidermis or dermis derived primary keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures. We defined ciprofloxacin concentrations which sufficiently protect cell cultures from recurrent mycoplasma infections without affecting cell growth. Keratinocytes isolated from stratum basale as defined by expression of cytokeratines 5 and 8, could be expanded up to 18 times (range 10-26). Even more efficiently, fibroblasts showed a 10e7 fold expansion (range, 10 6 -10 9 ). Phenotypic analyses revealed that both cell types constitutively expressed intermediate amounts of the costimulatory molecule CD40 and of HLA class I molecules. In addition, expression levels of these molecules could be increased as well as de novo expression of HLA-DR molecules induced following IFN-g treatment for 3 to 5 days. When used in functional assays, both IFN-g pretreated keratinocytes and fibroblasts induced significant allogeneic responses by naive T cells, and alloreactivity could even be more enhanced in the presence of soluble anti-CD28 antibody. Moreover, recipient derived fibroblasts were successfully applied to deplete allospecificities from haploidentical donor CD8+ -T cells lines.",

Gadner St. Anna Kinderspital (Vienna, A) Meanwhile the Leukapheresis developed to a routine procedure in pediatrics. Nearly all available apheresis systems have been adapted to the special needs of children and especially very small children. The AMICUS\u2122 system is recently introduced for adults in PBSC and PBMNC apheresis. We described in this study our experience with very small children and the concomitant adaptations to the needs of the small total blood volume of the children. From 8/2005 until 07/2005 we performed 34 apheresis with the AMICUS\u2122 system in 27 patients (median age 2.99, range 0.97-7.67; 20male and 7 female) under 25 kg bw (median bw 14 kg, range 6. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In 31 procedure the target were the CD34+ cells and in 3 procedures the target were monocytes for tumor vaccination with dentritic cells. 70% (18/26) had a bw below 15 kg. In 76% (26/34) the AMICUS\u2122 system was primed with blood and in 24% (8/34) with saline solution (bw 15-24kg). 3 to 4 times the blood volume was processed. the machine settings were in median a cycle volume of 1000 ml, RBC offset volume of 7.0 ml and a citrat infusion ratio of 12-15:1. During the procedure no severe adverse events and in 88% (30/34) no maior technical problems were observed. Three times the blood flow rate of the inlet line was reduced, twice the blood flow rate cold not be increased over 20 ml/min and in one procedure the return line has to be replaced due to extravasations. The yield and collection efficiency (CE) of the CD34+ cells were in mean 18.4 10 6 /kg (+/-21) and 70% (+/-22)respectively. For the other leukocyte populations lymphocytes, monocytes, MNC and granulocytes we found a yield in mean of 200 10 6 /kg (+/-226), 372 (+/-241), 608 (+/-395), 373 (+/-278) and a CE in mean of 65% (+/-23), 61 (+/-29), 61 (+/-23) and 14 (+/-13) respectively. The CE`s were lower in comparison to results in adult. This seems to be an effect of the hemodilution during the procedure. The loss of platelets was in median 45% (range 9-78%). All so far transplanted patients engrafted in time and the tumor vaccine could be manufactured without complications. Conclusion: Leukaphereses for PBSC and DLI with the AMICUS system are save and efficient even in very small children. This is the first report on the AMICUS system with children weighting < 10 kg (n=6).",

Mostly the loss TBV and RBV of the patient is only calculated by the bodyweight (bw), hematocrit (hct) of the patient and the extracorporal volume of the machine and measured befor and after the procedure. During the procedure little is known regarding the loss of RBV. To adress this we prospectively collected data from 21 apheresis procedures (5 with blood priming =pBC with HA5% (group A), 16 with saline priming (group B)) performed with the AMICUS system in various patients with malignant diseases undergoing stem cell harvest for megatherapy or PBMNC harvest for tumor vaccination (median age 1.23y,range 0.99-6.6 A and 8.3y,range 2.4-27 B;bw 9.5kg,6. 7-19.5 A and 33 kg,16-67 B) . Blood smears were performed at 4 time points: beginning(0), end of priming (1) , beginning of reinfusion(2) and after reinfusion(3). In group A we used in patients with a low hematocrit (<25%) and a low bw (\u2264 10kg) (3/5 patients) the priming solution (pRBC + HA) also for the RBC collection at the end of each cycle to increase the RBC volume of the patient. We calculated the loss/increase of RBV in the 2 groups and at the 4 time points. The hematocrit was significantly lower in group A than in group B (23%(18-30);29%(22-38)).During priming there was a loss of RBV in group B from 100% to in median 85%(range 73-92) of the RBV which correlated well with bw (r=0.79,p<0.01)and in group A a constant RBV of in median 100%(95-108). Between time point 1 and 2 during the separation phase we saw in group A a variable situation (100 to 95%(76-130)) depending on the use of the priming fluid for RBC collection and in group B a loss from 85 to 74%(53-90%) depending on bw and processed blood volume. During Reinfusion the RBV increased to 100%(100-136) in group A and to 84%(73-98) in group B. The procedures were well tolerated and no side effects were seen in either group. The extend of the loss of RBV was well correlating with bw and was near by the calculated RBV loss from TBV, hematocrit and extracorporal volume of the system. We conclude that the AMICUS system with blood priming in even very small children could be used to increase the RBV during the apheresis procedure. In small children an isovolemic hemodilution up to 47% was seen without side effects for the patients.",

We retrospectively analysed clinical and analytical data from 71 children (37 males; 34 females) proposed for autologous PBPC transplantation between December 1995 and September 2005. Patients (median age 10 years, range 2-16; median weight 29 kg, range 10-72) presented the following malignancies: neuroblastoma 20, Hodgkin disease 13, acute myeloid leukaemia 9, acute lymphoid leukaemia 8, non-Hodgkin lymphoma 6, Ewing sarcoma 5, others 10. Prior to mobilization, all patients received chemotherapy (median number of 2 protocols, range 1-5) and 9 patients also received radiotherapy. All children were mobilized with G-CSF with a median daily dose of 11. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] in the first mobilization and 18. in the second mobilization. Collections started on day 5 and a maximum of three aphaeresis per mobilization was performed to obtain at least 2x106/kg CD34+ cells. Twenty children (28,2%) needed a second mobilization and 4 children (5,6%) a third one to achieve the CD34+ cell target. For the aphaeresis collections, red blood cell priming was performed in 32 patients (45%). The median procedure time was 141 minutes and the rate of inlet flow 59 ml/min. We processed a median of 4 blood volumes (range 1,7-4,2) in a single session. A median number of 0.94x106/kg and 0.80x106/kg CD34+ cells was collected per aphaeresis in the first and second mobilization, respectively. The highest CD34+ cell number was obtained in the first day of collection. By linear regression analysis, a significant correlation was observed between peripheral blood CD34+ cell count and CD34+ cells/kg patient body weight collected (Pearson coefficient 0.834, p<0,01). Additionally, a significant correlation between pre-aphaeresis platelet count and CD34+ cell yield and pre-aphaeresis white blood cell count and CD34+ cell yield was found (Kruskall Wallis test p<0.01). We didn't find any correlation between prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy and the number of CD34+ cells collected.",

Methods: PCR-SSP (One Lambda, Canoga Park, USA) was employed for detecting SNPs involving positions -592 (A/C), -819 (T/C) and -1082 (A/G) of Interleukin 10 (IL10); position -308 (A/G) for Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa); position -174 (G/C) for IL6; position +874 intron 1 (T/A) for Interferongamma, (IFNg); positions at codon 10 (T/C) and codon 25 (C/G) for Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGFb1). We evaluated 64 patients (pts) affected by hematological malignancies (40 males, 24 females). Median age: 48 years. 38 pts received a myeloablative conditioning, 26 a reduced intensity conditioning; 58 pts received cyclosporine plus methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. Stem cell source was bone marrow for 31 pts and PBSC for 33. Results: 35 pts are alive with a median follow up of 35 months. Overall survival at 5 years was 48%. Transplant related mortality was 29%. 13 pts (20.3%) developed a severe Acute GvHD (aGvHD) (> 3) and 5 of them died because of aGvHD. 22 pts are alive with chronic GvHD. Factors significantly associated with survival were: severe aGvHD, type of disease, CMV reactivation and fungal infection after HSCT. Cytokine SNPs and HSCT outcome: IL6: pts with allele C had a better survival than those with the G allele and the G/G genotype was related to severe aGVHD but not to chronic GVHD. TGFb1: pts with G/G had a greater incidence of aGVHD and worse survival. IL10: only 4 pts presented the ATA/ATA genotype (high producers according to Lin), all of them died, 3 with severe aGVHD. 32 pts with the C/C genotype in position -592 (low producers) had a survival of 39%, while 28 pts with C/A genotype had a survival of 65% (p=0.01), a trend confirmed only for pts who underwent a myeloablative conditioning. Incidence of aGVHD in pts with the C/C genotype in -592 was higher (22/32) compared with C/A pts (14/28). No correlations were found between SNPs of others cytokines and HSCT outcome. Conclusion: it seems that immunogenetics is moving beyond HLA. Cytokine gene SNPs may play a role in the outcome of HSCT. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these data.",

Recombinant PLIF-C48 exhibited cell mediated immunosupression. The aim of the current study was to investigate the regulatory effects of native placenta ferritin (PLF), recombinant PLIF and C48 on hematopoiesis of human bone marrow (BM). Methods: Bone Marrow mononuclear cells BM-MNC and CD34+ selected cells were treated in-vitro with either PLF, PLIF or C48 without and in combination with granulocytemonocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and subjected to hematopoietic progenitor cell assay. Cytokines and chemokines secreted by the treated cells were evaluated in culture supernatant using antibody array assays to determine mechanism of action. Results: In-vitro treatment of BM-MNC with PLF, PLIF or C48 induced significant growth of myeloid colonies and when mixed with GM-CSF or G-CSF exhibited additive enhanced CFU-GM growth. Yet, C48 treatment of selected CD34+ cells did not yield colony formation and did not affect their response to GM-CSF. Treatment of BM-MNC with C48 for 48h induced secretion of marked levels of GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-1 and IL-10. These cytokines were secreted primarily by C48 treated BM adherent cells and partly by non-adherent cells, whereas the CD34+ selected cells, secreted IL-6 only. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated the unique growth promoting activity of PLF, PLIF and C48 on BM progenitor cells, while exhibiting suppression of BM T cell proliferation. The differential effect of PLF-PLIF is attributed to the non-ferritin novel C-terminal amino acid sequence (C48), which is structurally different from the known H chains, and is due to the effect on the cytokine-chemokine networks. The results of the current study may offer a new strategy for treating non-manipulated donor derived BM cells with C48 in allogeneic transplantation. This treatment may enhance myelopoiesis while partially suppress T-cells and thereby mimic its role in maternal-embryonic relationship in-utero.",

Langner, P. Staber, G. Radspieler, K. Triebl-Roth, C. Urban, W. Zinke-Cerwenka, H. Sill, W. Linkesch, P. Neumeister Medical University of Graz (Graz, A) Objectives: In this ongoing randomized open label study we evaluate the effect of Palifermin on the development of oral and intestinal mucositis in 17 patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo/auto-HSCT). Methods: Nine patients, transplanted for acute leukaemia (AL, n=5) and non-Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma (NHL, n=4) received 60 \u00b5g Palifermin per kilogram of body weight per day for three consecutive days before the initiation of conditioning therapy and immediately after HSCT. The control group comprised 8 patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia (n= 6) and NHL (n=2). In the Palifermin group the distribution between alloand auto-HSCT was 4 and 5 compared to 5 and 3 in the control group. Conditioning therapy consisted of fractionated total-body irradiation/ cyclophosphamide in case of AL and chemotherapy only based regimens in NHL patients. Oral mucositis was graded daily according to World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. The intestinal mucosal barrier damage was assessed by analyzing Citrulline serum levels on HSCT days -12, -6, 0, +7, +14 and +21. Results: Our preliminary analysis demonstrates a significant decrease in the incidence of oral mucositis WHO grade 3 or 4 with 33 percent in the Palifermin group as opposed to 75 percent in the control group (p=0,04). The median duration of mucositis was 5,4 days (range 0-19) in the Palifermin group compared to 9,5 days (range 0-19) in controls (p=ns). Whereas both groups showed a similar decline in Citrulline serum concentrations until day +7 -reflecting a maximal intestinal mucosal barrier injury at this timepoint -a significantly faster recovery of Citrulline levels (18,5 vs 13,8 \u00b5M, p=0,04) in Palifermin recipients at day +21 could be observed. The duration of total parenteral nutrition was almost equal (16 vs 15 days). However, there was a trend in the use of opioid analgesics as determined by morphine equivalents (median 71mg vs 117mg, p=ns) in favour of the Palifermin treated patients. Conclusions: Palifermin reduces the incidence and duration of WHO grade 3 and 4 oral mucositis and promotes a faster recovery of intestinal mucosal in allogeneic and autologous HSCT recipients. Further trials are needed to determine the role of Palifermin on the incidence of infections and acute graft versus host disease.",

Willems, G. Fillet, Y. Beguin University of Liege (Liege, B) In order to assess the effect of Pegfilgrastim on the duration of neutropenia and clinical outcome of patients after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), we compared 20 consecutive patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma receiving a single 6 mg dose of Pegfilgrastim on day 1 posttransplant to a historical control group of 60 patients receiving daily Filgrastim 5 \u00b5g/kg starting on day 1 posttransplant. There were 54 M and 26 F, 30 patients with lymphoma and 50 with myeloma, 26 in CR and 54 not in CR. Mean age was 55\u00b110 yrs and 25 had already received a previous autologous transplant. The two groups were matched for disease and disease status, transplant number, age and sex. Cell dose infused tended to be higher in the Pegfilgrastim group (7.16\u00b13.82 vs 10.03\u00b16.25 x106 CD34+ cells/kg, p=0.0575). There were no differences (p>0.05) in time to 0.5 (8 vs 9 days) or 1 (9 vs 9 days) x109/L neutrophils; to 1 % reticulocytes (13 vs 15 days) or 9 (12 vs 14 days) or 10 (30 vs 25 days) g/dL Hb; to 20 (9 vs 9 days) or 100 (20 vs 31 days) x 109/L platelets. The number of days with fever (2.7\u00b12.3 vs 2.3\u00b12.4 days), incidence of infections (all infections; bacteremia; bacterial, fungal or viral infections; FUO), duration of antibiotic therapy (8.7\u00b15.9 vs 8.4\u00b15.9 days), RBC (1.1\u00b11.6 vs 0.9\u00b11.6) and platelet (1.0\u00b11.7 vs 1.2\u00b11.8) transfusions, and time to hospital discharge (14.5\u00b15.3 vs 15.4\u00b15.8 days) were similar in the Pegfilgrastim compared to the Filgrastim group. However, after initial hematopoietic recovery, several differences between the groups became apparent, with the group always showing higher counts compared to the Filgrastim group (p values <0.05 to <0.001). Neutrophils remained significantly higher in the Pegfilgrastim group between days 14-30, lymphocytes between days 56-90, monocytes between days 21-24, reticulocytes between days 17-42 and platelets between days 35-90, respectively. These differences had no impact on clinical outcome after day 30 due to the low incidence of infectious events after engraftment. We conclude that Pegfilgrastim administrated on day 1 posttransplant impacts hematopoietic reconstitution similarly to daily Filgrastim. However, despite a trend towards fewer CD34+ cells transplanted, the Pegfilgrastim group enjoyed higher trilineage cell counts for some time after initial engraftment. This should be further tested in prospective randomized trials.",

Szczylik CSK MON WIM (Warsaw, PL) Objectives: Oral mucositis is a common complication of highdose chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem-cell support (HSCT). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of palifermin (recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor) for prevention and reduction of severity and duration of oral mucositis in patients treated with HSCT. Methods: In 2005 eleven patients were treated. Three received allogeneic stem cells (ALLO): 1-chronic myeloid leukemia, CML; 1-myelodysplastic syndrom, MDS; 1-myeloma multiplex, MM. and eight autologous transplantation (AUTO): 3-acute myeloid leukemia, AML; 1-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL; 1-MM; 3-non Hodgkin lymphoma. For ALLO conditioning regimens were composed of: treosulphan and cyclophosphamide (CML,MDS) and melphalan, fludarabine, alemtuzumab (MM). AUTO were treated with: treosulphan, cyclophosphamide-AML; total body irradiation+ etoposide-ALL; melphalan-MM; BEAM+ rituximab-non Hodgkin lymphoma. The source of hematopoietic stem cells was peripheral blood. Palifermin 60 micrograms per kilogram per day was given intravenously for three consecutive days, starting three days before the initiation of chemo-or radiochemotherapy, then patients received three additional doses of palifermin on days 0, 1, 2 after transplantation. Oral mucositis was assessed with the use of the five-grade World Health Organization (WHO) oral-toxicity scale. Safety was assessed on the basis of the incidence of adverse events. Results: Oral mucositis grade 2-4 was not observed. Nobody had to receive opioid analgesics or total parenteral nutrition. Neutropenic fever occurred in all patients with median duration of three days. Seven patients did not suffered from oral mucositis and four (1-AML, 1-CML, 1-MM, 1-NHL) had grade 1 according to the WHO scale with duration from 4 to 6 days. They did not need any painkillers. Three patients developed mild rash, pruritus and erythema during palifermin therapy. Side effects occurred in the first period of treatment, 3 to 4 days after the initiation of therapy and lasting approximately three days. They were successfully treated with antihistaminic pills. Conclusion: Palifermin is a very promising medicine for prevention of oral mucositis for patients treated with high dose chemotherapy supported with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

In the current study, we aimed at evaluating the effect of CD8-depletion on graft rejection, AGvHD and CGvHD, and relapse. Fifty-three patients were randomised between CD8-depletion (group 1) (n=25) and no manipulation (group 2) (n=28). Two patients in the CD8 group were excluded for poor CD34+ cell count collected. Diagnoses were: AML (n=3), CML-AP (n=2), MDS (n=14), MPD (n=3), CLL (n=5), NHL (n=14), MM (n=8) and RCC (n=2). Median age was 57 (range 36-69) yrs. After conditioning with 2 Gy TBI with (n=39) or without (n=12) fludarabine, patients received PBSC from family (n=21) or unrelated (n=30) HLA-matched donors. CD8-depletion was carried out using the Eligix system and GvHD prophylaxis consisted in CyA and MMF. CD8 depletion removed 96% of CD8+ cells so that the number of CD8+ cells infused was 6.8 vs 136.8 x108 cells/Kg in group 2 (p<0.0001). AGvHD of any grade was observed in 13 (56%) patients in group 1 and 17 (61%) in group 2 (NS); it was grade 3-4 in 1 (4%) and 5 (18%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (NS). Limited and extensive CGvHD developed in 3 and 1 patients in group 1 and in 7 and 2 patients in group 2, respectively (NS). Nine patients in group 1 and 12 in group 2 received unmanipulated DLI for poor chimerism or disease progression. Eight (3 initial and 5 late) graft failures were observed in group 1 and one (late) in group 2. Full donor chimerism was achieved in 57% (group 1) and 50% (group 2) at day 100, and in 73% (group 1) and 59% (group 2) (NS) at 1 yr. The 2-yr OS and PFS rates are 55% and 43 % in group 1 vs 59% and 46% in group 2, respectively (NS). Four (17%) patients died of their disease in group 1 vs 3 (11%) in group 2 (NS). Two patients died of severe AGvHD in group 2 vs none in group 1. In conclusion, in vitro CD8-depletion results in higher rates of graft failure after NMSCT. The incidence of acute and chronic GvHD is not reduced but there is a trend towards reduced severity of AGvHD. Relapse and survival rates are not changed by this strategy.",

Amrolia Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms causing graft versus host disease (GvHD), steroid refractory GvHD remains a life threatening condition with poor prognosis. Treatment modalities such as ATG and Campath have been associated with a high infection related mortality and responses have not been durable. We investigated the combined use Dacluzimab, a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting IL-2 and Infliximab-anti TNF alpha, in order to target two different points in the GvHD cytokine cascade. Between September 2002 and June 2005,162 children underwent an allogenic SCT at our institution. Of these, 13(8%) children (median age 2.79 years range 0.13 -12.38) developed steroid refractory GvHD (defined as acute GvHD that failed to improve after one week of at least 2mg/kg/day of MP). Donors were MSD or MFD (3), MUD (7) and mismatched UD (3). The mean T-Cell dose was 5.5 X10 8 /kg (range 0.4-20.2 x 10 8 kg). Conditioning regimes used were myeloablative (3) and non-myeloablative (8) and none (2) with serotherapy, Campath 1H (8) and no serotherapy (5). T-replete BM (7) or PBSC (6) was the stem cell source. GvHD prophylaxis was with Ciclosporin (5) or Ciclosporin plus MMF (8). Organs involved were lower gut (12), liver (4) and skin (11). Patients were treated with a combination of Daclizumab (1mg/kg, days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22) and Infliximab (10mg/kg, days 1, 8, 15, 22) . Median time of starting the monoclonal antibodies was day 54 (range 30-133). All children received fungal prophylaxis with AmBisome or Voriconazole and prospective monitoring by weekly PCRs in the blood for CMV, EBV and Adenovirus. 10/13 patients had a complete resolution of GvHD. Median time to complete response was 13 days (range 10-28 days) 2 patients developed recurrent GvHD and needed a second course of Mabs. Both responded to the second course. 9 patients developed viral reactivations (CMV 3, adeno 3 and EBV 5) and 4 developed opportunistic fungal infections. At a median follow-up of 20.5 months (range 5.03-67.83 months), 9/13 (69%) children are alive. 4 children died of progressive GvHD. There were no infection related deaths. This data suggests that combination treatment with Daclizumab and Infliximab is an effective therapeutic option for children with steroid refractory GvHD.",

Therefore we intended to reduce the toxicity of the procedure by the application of Alemtuzumab in combination with cyclosporine. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen, has demonstrated particular high efficacy in the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Between October 2002 and August 2005 200 patients were transplanted with allogeneic stem cells after conditioning regimen which contained Alemtuzumab with 50 or 100mg absolute, depending on present risk factors. Alemtuzumab was given on five consecutive days during conditioning. Conditioning regimen were in majority myeloablative and contained mainly TBI in combination with Fludarabine or Treosulfan with Cyclophosphamide. Underlying diseases were AML (n=80), NHL (n=24), ALL (n=23), MDS (n=22), CLL (n=14), MM (n=12), OMF (n=10), CML (n=8), CMML (n=3), SAA (n=3) and PNH (n=1). 79 patients (39,5%) had progressive disease, partial remission or second or higher complete remission. 57 patients (28,5%) were 55 years or older at transplantation.",

Early non-relapse mortality at day 100 was 9,5% (n=19) and occurred due to infectious complications with or without multiorgan failure. The relapse/progressive disease related mortality at day 100 was 5,5% (n=11). Severe acute GvHD clinical grade III-IV occurred only in 10 patients (5%). 85% of patients (n=170) survived day 100. In conclusion Alemtuzumab was given in 1000 applications without serious adverse events. The reduction of toxicity and severe GvHD decreased transplant related mortality to levels which appear comparable to those of reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Bearing in mind the aggravated risk of our patient population, a day100 non-relapse mortality below 10% after myeloablative conditioning has to be considered favourable. Future investigations will determine the rate of infectious complications after day 100 and the overall rate of relapse.",

We evaluated 32 patients who underwent allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) for haematological malignancies, 15 with cGVHD, 17 without cGVHD; the Stem Cell source was Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell in 13 cases (10 in the cGVHD group and 3 in the control group), Bone Marrow in 18 (5 in cGVHD group and 13 in the controls) and Cord Blood in 1 (1 in each group). We incubated purified IgG from the patients with cGVHD and from those without cGVHD, with mouse embryofibroblasts carrying inactive copies of PDGFR alpha or beta chains (PDGFR -/-) or the same cells expressing PDGFR alpha or beta, respectively. Stimulatory antibodies to the PDGFR were selectively found in all patients with extensive cGVHD while none of the patients without cGVHD had detectable levels of specific IgG anti-PDGF-R; antibodies recognized native PDGFR, induced tyrosine phosphorylation and ROS accumulation. Stimulatory PDGFR antibodies induced selectively Ha-Ras-ERK1/2 and ROS cascade, stimulated type I collagen gene expression and myofibroblast phenotype conversion in normal human primary fibroblasts. Their activity was abolished by pre-incubation with PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Moreover we were able to study directly in the fibroblast from 5 patients and 5 controls, the Ha-Ras-ERK1/2 stimulation: Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of Ha-Ras protein in the controls while in all patients with cGVHD we observed very high levels of Ha-Ras, like the 46 patients with SSc In conclusion stimulatory auto-antibodies against PDGFR represent a specific hallmark of patients with cGVHD. Their biological activity on fibroblasts strongly argues for a causal role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Bone marrow (n=39) and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC, n=29) allografts were compared to assess whether graft composition influence allogeneic stem cell transplantation outcome. Lymphocyte counts were higher in PBSC, but percentages of naive, TCM, TEM, and TTD within CD4+ and CD8+ populations did not differ between the two graft sources. Ranges of CCR7+/CCRneg ratios of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were broad but not age-dependent. Regarding clinical outcome of recipients, multivariable analysis showed that recipient age \u00a1\u00dc 40.4 years predicted event free survival (EFS; p=.027). Male sex was associated with better overall survival (OS; p=.036), better EFS (p=.023), and lower risk of relapse (p=.029). Unrelated donors led to worse OS (p<.001), EFS (p=.010), and higher transplantation-related mortality (p=.016). Higher T-cell doses infused with PBSC were associated with higher incidence of chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), but the T-cell dose by itself was not associated with acute GVHD (aGVHD). However, a CCR7+/CCR7neg ratio of CD4+ T cells > 2.66 (proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing the CCR7 within either BMSC or PBSC) conferred by multivariate analysis the highest adjusted hazard ratio (3.9; p=.008) of acute GVHD, but graft composition was not associated with transplantation-related mortality, relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival. Determination of the CCR7+/CCR7neg ratio of CD4+ T cells in the graft provides a predictive indicator of aGVHD and could help coming selected T-cell-depletion approaches.",

Using a murine haploidentical BMT model (C57Bl/6 -> B6D2F1), we now tested whether HO-1 induction alters the alloreactive T cell response or rather modulates the inflammatory cytokine storm early after BMT. In vitro administration of CoPP did not affect the expression of MHC class I and II or of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on murine peritoneal macrophages and on splenic dendritic cells (DCs). Also, allospecific T cell proliferation (37053 \u00b1 6089 vs. 41940 \u00b1 5554 cpm) and IFN gamma secretion (1858 \u00b1 552 vs. 2418 \u00b1 624 pg/ml) did not differ in mixed lymphocyte reactions using either CoPP or control treated DCs as stimulators. Splenic DCs, isolated one to four days after BMT from CoPP pretreated allo recipients did not show any differences in the expression of costimulatory molecules compared to untreated controls, and T cell expansion 14 days after BMT was equal in control and CoPP pretreated allo groups. Also, cytotoxic function of T cells isolated 14 days after BMT from allo recipients was not altered. These data suggested, that HO-1 induction did not affect the alloantigen-specific T cell response in vivo. Next, we determined whether HO-1 induction affected inflammatory cytokine levels, specifically TNF alpha and IL-1. While IL-1 was not detectable on day 14 after BMT in any group, serum TNF alpha levels were significantly elevated in allo controls (31,4 \u00b1 8,3 pg/ml). In contrast, TNF alpha levels in CoPP pretreated allo recipients were significantly lower (7,4 \u00b1 7,4 pg/ml) and did not differ from syngeneic groups (untreated: 14,3 \u00b1 8,4 pg/ml, CoPP: 13,6 \u00b1 7,5 pg/ml ). These results were supported by in vitro findings, showing a significant suppression of peritoneal macrophage TNF alpha secretion in response to LPS, when pretreated with CoPP and in comparison to controls (51,2 \u00b1 8,7 pg/ml versus 460,6 \u00b1 62,8 pg/ml). In conclusion, our results indicate, that the protective and beneficial effects of CoPP mediated HO-1 induction on survival and aGvHD severity after allo BMT involve a reduction of the proinflammatory cytokine storm rather than alterations in the alloantigen-specific T cell response.",

Herr University of Mainz (Mainz, D) Alloreactive (allo-) T lymphocytes are important mediators of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allograft recipients. Strategies allowing the depletion of allo-T lymphocytes, while preserving anti-malignoma and anti-virus T cells would be advantageous. We generated malignoma-reactive T cell lines by stimulating healthy donor lymphocytes with allogeneic acute myeloid leukemia or renal-cell carcinoma cells over 3 weeks in vitro. HLA of donors and malignomas were either fully matched, or differed at a single allele or haplotype. Of the activation markers CD25, CD69, CD71, CD95, CD134, and CD137 tested, the tumor necrosis factor receptor molecule CD137 (4-1BB) was most suitable for allo-depletion strategies due to a transient expression kinetic on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following malignoma stimulation. Accordingly, we developed a two-step procedure allowing the activation and subsequent CD137-mediated depletion of allo-T cells. To activate allo-CD8+ T cells, HLA-negative K562 cells transfected with single HLA-class I mismatch alleles or patient-derived fibroblasts were used. After 24h of incubation, allo-T cells were depleted using a biotinylated CD137 antibody, anti-Biotin microbeads, and immunomagnetic depletion columns. Subsequently, CD137neg and CD137pos fractions were re-cultivated and were stimulated again with the original AML/RCC cells. The depletion efficacy was controlled by analyzing the specificity of T-cell lines on d0, d4, and d11 after depletion in IFN-g ELISPOT assays.",

The CD137neg fractions maintained significant numbers of anti-malignoma (median, 64%; range, 40-92) and anti-cytomegalovirus (median, 87%; range, 38-150) CD8+ T cells. Side by side comparison of CD69 and CD137 mediated depletion approaches showed a significant higher yield of anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) specificities using the CD137 strategy. This was explained by HLA-tetramer staining results showing more than two-third of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CD69 and only onethird of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CD137 after allo-stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the CD137-mediated depletion of allo-CD8+ T cells is efficient, and preserves substantial antimalignoma and anti-CMV activities. One major challenge will S78 be to develop this approach in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines. G.H.S. Richter (1) , A. Mollweide (1) , E. Uhlmann (2), S. Burdach (1) (1)Munich University of Technology (Munich, D) ; (2) Martin-Luther-University (Halle, D) Inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) interaction with its ligand (ICOSL) is involved in several T cell effector functions. The abundant expression of ICOSL in a variety of target tissues of acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) provided the rationale to investigate its role in acute GvHD development. C57BL/6 mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with allogeneic spleen cells in the absence or presence of ICOSL-blocking antibody. Mice reconstituted with allogeneic spleen cells experienced GvHD starting day 3 with 12-16% weight loss around day 4 after transplantation and died untreated of acute GvHD within 7-10 days after transplantation. When treated from day 3 after transplantation with an anti-ICOSL mAb, mice gained weight again and survived for additional 18 days, although the treatment was already stopped at day 11 after transplantation. Such mice revealed less transplanted T cells in spleen at day 4 with reduced effector activity. In contrast, anti-ICOSL treatment starting from day 0 did not prevent GvHD. The difference between day 3 and day 0 anti-ICOSL treatment was independent of CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells since their depletion did not abrogate the effect of ICOSL blockade starting day 3. Similarly, depletion of NK cells did not improve anti-ICOSL treatment suggesting that mainly transplanted effector T cells are influenced by ICOSL blockade. Significant differences between day 0 and day 3 treatment are revealed by transcriptomics. Our results clearly show that therapeutic but not prophylactic blockade of ICOS:ICOSL interaction can interfere with acute GvHD development and alleviates disease in a polyclonal T cell setting.",

Montserrat Hospital Cl\u00ednic (Barcelona,E) Objective: To determine the clinical factors involved in T-cell reconstitution after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: Eighty-three patients undergoing allogeneic SCT in one single institution were evaluated (40 M/ 43 F). Serial assessments of lymphocyte subset and T-cell receptor excision circle (TRECS) levels were performed using flow cytometry and real time quantitative PCR. The samples were obtained at 1 (n=50), 3 (n=45), 6 (n=38), 9 (n=32), 12 (n=29), 24 (n=19), 36 (n=8), and 42 (n=2) months post-transplantation with a median follow-up of 9 months. Results: The factors that adversely affected CD3+ and CD8+ T cells recovery after SCT were patient age > 25 years, unrelated donor, history of CMV infection, and acute graft versus-host disease (GVHD) (p<0.05). TRECs levels were low or undetectable during the first three months after transplant and progressively increased thereafter. However, median TRECs levels of patients did not achieve normal values compared to healthy donors at any time point post-SCT. Presence and severity of chronic GVHD significantly affected TRECs counts: patients with chronic GVHD had lower TRECs levels than patients without chronic GVHD at 9, 12 and 24 moths after SCT (p=0.002, p=0.022, p=0.015, respectively). Moreover, patients with limited chronic GVHD had higher TRECs levels compared to patients with extensive chronic GVHD (p=0.018). Influence of severe infections on TRECs levels was also analyzed. No relationship was observed between invasive fungal infection or severe bacterial infections and TRECs levels. However, CMV infection was associated in to lower TREC counts at 9-12 months post-SCT (p=0.032). Conclusion: Our data support the notion that adult patients have certain degree of preserved thymopoiesis after allogeneic SCT that is strongly influenced by clinical events such as chronic GVHD and CMV infection.",

Median ferritin in pts who subsequently died was 3815 ng/ml and significantly higher than that of surviving pts (1146 ng/ml; p<0.0001). Therefore, outcome was analysed according to ferritin levels. For pts with ferritin <400, 401-1600, and >1600 ng/ml, OS was 100%, 85%, 53% (p<0.0001) and TRM was 0%, 9% and 34% respectively (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, diagnosis, MUD, CMV status and the gender of the donor did not correlate with TRM. Excess body iron and blood transfusions (BT) strongly correlated with TRM (p<0.0001). Mutant HFE genes were found in 98 (37%) pts prior to HCT [heterozygous (het) , n=82 (84%), compound, n=9 (9%), homozygous (homo), n=7 (7%)]. Similarly, 99 (37%) donors showed mutant HFE genes [het, n=86 (87%), compound, n=8 (8%), and homo, n=5 (5%)]. After HCT, all pts expressed donor HFE genotype. HFE genotype of pts and donors did not correlate with TRM. In multivariate analysis, acute GvHD of the liver strongly correlated with iron overload and BT (p=0.009). Interestingly, chronic GvHD of the skin and liver tended to occur more in pts with mutant HFE genotype prior to HCT (p=0.03). Conclusions: Excess body iron and the number of BT strongly correlate with acute GvHD of the liver, OS and TRM after HCT. These data need to be confirmed in prospective studies and might provide new insides in the pathomechanism of acute liver GvHD.

Montserrat (1) (1)Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, E); (2)Universitat de Barcelona (Barcelona, E) Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOD2/CARD15 have been associated with the incidence and severity of acute GVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) (Holler et al, Blood 2004; 104:889-894) . In Holler's report it was also suggested that SNPs in NOD2/CARD15 might influence the patient's outcome independently of GVHD. We have investigated this possible \"GVHD independent\" role of SNPs in NOD2/CARD15 in a model of allo-SCT with a low incidence of GVHD, such as Tcell depleted transplants (TCD). Eighty-four patients undergoing allo-SCT with TCD by means of CD34+ selection have been studied, and results were compared with a concurrent group of 94 patients receiving an allo-SCT with unmanipulated grafts (Non-TCD). Transplants were performed in a single institution, donors were HLA identical siblings and all patients received myeloablative-conditioning regimen. Median follow-up was of 30.6 months (range, 0.2-112). SNPs 8, 12, and 13 were identified by RT-PCR allelic discrimination method in 178 patients and in 137 donors. SNPs in NOD2/CARD15 were detected in 13.8% of patients and in 10.7% of donors. No statistically significant association was seen between donors' or recipients' NOD2/CARD15 genotype and cumulative incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD (Fine and Gray). In TCD group, factors associated in the univariate analysis (log-rank) with a lower disease free survival (DFS) were SNPs in NOD2/CARD15 (17% vs. 49%, p=0.03), age older than 38 years (34% vs. 65%, p=0.01), and patient's CMV positive serology (39% vs. 64%, p=0.06). Of these three factors, in the Cox multivariate analysis only NOD2/CARD15 genotype (RR 2.3; CI95%: 1.02-5.4) and age (RR 2.2; CI95%: 1.05-4.7) showed to be independent prognostic factors. In the non-TCD group, no association was found between NOD2/CARD15 genotype and DFS. In conclusion, polymorphisms in NOD2/CARD15 have a deleterious effect on clinical outcome in TCD transplants independent of GVHD. This result supports that SNPs in NOD2/CARD15 might be associated with an abnormal unspecific inflammatory response after allo-SCT, independent of allogeneic immune reactions.",

Dammann, J. Gottlieb, M. Eder, T. Welte, A. Ganser, B. Hertenstein Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) Background: Involvement of the lung is a most devastating form of chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (cGvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Its clinical manifestations, Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS, with predominant small airways obstruction), and Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP, with predominant restrictive changes), carry a high morbidity and mortality. Treatment options are limited and new agents for effective therapy are urgently needed. Patients: We report on 20 consecutive adult patients with pulmonary cGvHD treated at our institution. Median age was 42 years (range: 21 -59); 8 patients were female and 12 male. HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell (n = 18) or bone marrow (n = 2) transplants from family (n = 13) or unrelated (n = 7) donors had been performed for AML (n = 9), ALL (n = 1), MDS/secondary AML (n = 3), CML (n = 3), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (n = 2) or lymphoma (n = 2). Conditioning was myeloablative (n = 14) or of reduced intensity (n = 6); GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) plus methotrexate (n = 15) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; n = 5). Initial diagnosis of pulmonary cGvHD was made after 8.5 months (range: 3 -36); 16 patients were diagnosed with BOS and 4 with BOOP. Twelve patients received conventional therapy with steroids, either alone (8) or in combination with CsA (2), MMF (1) or extracorporeal photopheresis (1) . Eight patients (all with BOS) were treated with SRL in combination with CsA (3) or steroids (1) or both (4). Results: Four out of 8 patients treated with SRL showed an objective response, whereas 4 had no improvement of pulmonary cGvHD. Due to hematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia, grade 2 -4), SRL had to be discontinued in 3 patients. An increased incidence of infectious complications was not observed. After a median follow-up of 9 (range: 1 -71) months, 5 of 8 patients treated with SRL are alive, whereas 3 of 8 BOS-patients have survived with conventional immunosuppression; of the 4 BOOP patients, 2 are alive. Among the patients treated with SRL 4 of 8 are alive and free of disease versus 5 of 12 patients with conventional therapy.",

Faucher, S. Furst, J. El-Cheikh, D. Blaise, M. Mohty Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Corticosteroid (CS)-resistant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and therapeutic options are limited for those patients. Also, elderly patients undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) are more exposed to the side effects of long term CS administration. Low dose methotrexate (MTX) therapy is a well established modality for GVHD prophylaxis. However, little is known about the role of this drug in CS-resistant GVHD. This pilot single center study investigated the role of MTX in a curative setting after failure of CS treatment in patients undergoing RIC allo-SCT. 20 patients received IV infusions of low dose MTX (5 mg/m\u00b2/infusion) at weekly intervals, for at least 4 weeks. Reasons for MTX administration were: CSrefractory acute GVHD, CS-refractory chronic GVHD, chronic GVHD exacerbation after CS taper, or CS severe side effects. Responses to low dose MTX infusions were assessed one month after the last infusion in each involved organ. 12 patients were treated for severe acute GVHD, while 8 patients received MTX for extensive chronic GVHD. Median age of patients was 51 (range, 22-60) . Median time of administration of MTX was day +89 (range, 32-300). Of note, none of the patients received any other concomitant therapy for refractory GVHD. 13 patients responded to MTX administration (65%) with 5 complete responses (25%). Among the 12 patients treated for acute GVHD, 7 responded (58%) of whom 5 CRs (42%). 3 patients did not respond and died from resistant GVHD. Interestingly, 5 patients from the group of grade 3-4 acute GVHD responded. Among the 8 patients treated for chronic GVHD, 6 were responders (75%). In addition, MTX allowed a significant reduction of CS daily dosage ranging from 25% to 80%, as assessed one month after the last administration of MTX. With a median follow-up of 287 days, no increase of CS therapy was necessary among these 6 MTX-responding patients. In all, toxicity of low dose MTX administration was low (transient and mild reversible cytopenia in 3 cases, 15%). Among the 20 patients, 14 are still alive (70%) with a median follow-up of 293 (range, 65-513) days. Overall, 2 patients died of progressive disease, while 4 patients died from refractory GVHD. We conclude that low dose MTX is a well-tolerated, inexpensive and likely steroid-sparing agent that is worthy of further investigation in prospective trials for treatment of refractory GVHD, but also as frontline therapy in combination with CS.",

Kim (1) Introduction: The current study attempted to evaluate the association between the IL-10 promoter gene polymorphism and transplant outcomes, including the occurrence of chronic GVHD and its clinical course during systemic immunosuppressive treatment (IST) after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Methods: Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the proximal region of the IL-10 promoter gene (-1082/-819/-592) were analyzed in 60 recipients of cytokine-mobilized PBSCs from HLA-matched sibling donors, and the transplant outcomes compared in terms of the occurrence of chronic GVHD and its clinical course. Results: The current study only found two haplotypes (1082*A/819*T/592*A [ATA] and 1082*A/819*C/592*C [ACC] ). An increased occurrence of chronic GVHD was noted dependent on the IL-10 haplotype (43% vs 68% vs 96% in ACC/ACC vs ATA/ACC vs ATA/ATA haplotype, p=0.003). In a logistic regression based on a multinomial model, the ATA/ATA homozygote presented a 7-fold increased risk of the development of chronic GVHD compared with the ACC/ACC homozygote. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year post-transplant was 46\u00b120%, 64\u00b110%, and 82\u00b15% in the ACC/ACC, ATA/ACC, and ATA/ATA groups, respectively (p=0.0266). The recipients without the ACC haplotype had a more frequent history of acute exacerbation of chronic GVHD (p=0.031, odds ratio 6.750), while 72% of the recipients with the ACC haloptype did not experience any history of acute exacerbation after the initiation of systemic IST for chronic GVHD compared to 38% of those without the ACC haplotype (p=0.014, odds ratio 4.375). Plus, the duration of systemic IST was significantly shorter in the recipients without the ATAhaplotype compared to those with the ATA haplotype (339 days versus 1,146 days, p=0.0091). In terms of GVHDspecific survival, the recipients without the ATA haplotype showed a 100% survival compared to 70.5% for the ATA haplotype group (p=0.2825). Conclusion: The IL-10 promoter gene polymorphism was found to be apparently associated with the occurrence of chronic GVHD and its clinical course during systemic IST for chronic GVHD in an allogeneic PBSCT setting.",

Di Carlo (1) Chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a frequent and major complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Decreased quality of life, impaired functional status, and increased risk of non-relapse mortality of 20-40% are associated with cGvHD. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a method of immune modulation proposed in the last ten years as successful adjunct therapy of cGvHD resistant to standard protocol. We examined the clinical and biological effects of ECP in 23 patients (pts) affected by cGvHD steroid resistant or steroid dependant, treated between March 2001 and November 2005. Enrolled pts have developed cGvHD following HLA-matched bone marrow (16 pts) or peripheral blood stem cell allografts (7 pts) for malignant (22 pts) or non-malignant (1 pt) haematological disorders. The median duration of ECP therapy was 14 (range, 1-36) months. No serious side effects due to ECP occurred and no increased incidence of infections was observed. Four pts (17%) were considered non responders due to progressive worsening of cGvHD or the inability to taper other medications. A complete response (CR), defined as resolution of the clinical manifestation of involved organs, was observed in 10 (43%) pts at a median of 12 (range, 3-27) months. Seven (30%) CR pts are off therapy at a median of 15 (range, 4-33) months. Nine (39%) pts obtained a partial remission (PR), defined as greater than 50% response in organ involvement at a median of 3 (range, 3-16) months. One pt died due to BC-LMC relapse, 2 pts developed fatal pulmonar mycotic infections. The 3 years OS is 87%. No correlation was observed between CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ peripheral blood counts, CD4/CD ratios and response. Persistence of low basal peripheral NK cells counts (< 100/microL) during ECP treatment correlate negatively with response to ECP (4/4 pts). In 4 others pts with basal NK < 100/microL, the NK cells cont increased and normalized at response. NK cells are an important element of innate immunity and have both regulator and effector functions. In the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation NK cells are involved in engraftment, graft rejection, GvHD, GvL effects and CMV reactivation. ECP mechanism of action is unknown, but recently it has been suggested that ECP acts modulating NK cells and APC cells. Interestingly, our data demonstrate a correlation between NK cell reconstitution and response to ECP treatment, but these oservation must be confirmed in larger numbers of patients.",

San Miguel Hospital Clinico de Salamanca (Salamanca, E) Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. In refractory acute (aGVHD) and chronic (cGVHD) GVHD, mortality is very high. Pentostatin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, induces lymphocyte apoptosis and may be useful in the treatment of this condition. Patients and Methods: We have conducted a prospective study of pentostatin in patients with refractory acute and cGVHD. Ten patients were enrolled in the analysis, 7 with refractory aGVHD (2 skin, 5 gut and 2 liver aGVHD with a grade 2 and 3 in 2 and 5 patients, respectively) and 3 with refractory extensive cGVHD (2 skin, 1 gut and 1 sinew as organs involved). Pentostatin dose was 1.5-2.5 mg/m\u00b2/d by intravenous injection for 3 days among seven patients diagnosed of refractory aGVHD patients (one patient required an additional dose on day +14 and +28) and 2.5 mg/m\u00b2/week during 4 weeks and them 4 mg/m\u00b2/2 weeks regarding 3 refractory chronic GVHD patients. Results: Regarding refractory aGVHD, response rate was 79%, with 2 (28.5%) out of 7 patients in complete response (CR) and 3 (43%) out of 7 patients in partial response (PR). Two (28.5%) out of 7 aGVHD patients did not response. Regarding refractory cGVHD all patients included reached responsed to Pentostatin, all of them PR. Only 2 out of 10 patients receiving Pentostatin as refractory GVHD treatment died due to GVHD complications. No more incidence of late infections and other complications were observed in this subgroup of patients, the drug was well tolerated. Conclusion: Pentostatin has activity in patients with refractory acute and chronic GVHD without important side efects.",

Terpe, A. Sekora, M. Freund, G. Hartung, D. Wolff University of Rostock (Rostock, D) Introduction: The development of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) disease and its associated morbidity is one of the major limitations of adoptive immunotherapy. We describe a bone marrow transplantation model in which cGVHD can be induced by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Methods: 23 female F1 hybrid LEW/BN rats were transplanted on day 0 with female BN-rats (n=18, groups 1-4) or LEW-rats (n=5, group 5) one day after total body irradiation (TBI). Stem cell enrichment of bone marrow (BM) grafts was performed by depletion of MHC II, OX52 and CD45R positive cells with MicroBeads (Miltenyi). DLI grafts were gained by depletion of adherent cells followed by immunomagnetic depletion of CD8a, CD45RA and TCR gamma delta positive spleen cells and subsequent enrichment of CD45RC+ T-cells. Group 1 (n=5) received 7.5Gy TBI, 4x10 7 BM cells and 7.5x10 6 CD4CD45RC+ T-cells on day 0. Group 2 (n=5) received 9.2Gy TBI, 3x10 7 stem cell enriched BM cells on day 0 and 1x10 7 CD4CD45RC+ T-cells on day 10. Group 3 (n=4) received 4.5Gy TBI, no BM cells and 1x10 7 CD4CD45RC+ Tcells on day 0. Group 4 (n=4) received 4.5Gy TBI, 4x10 7 BM cells and 1x10 7 CD4CD45RC+ T-cells on day 0. Group 5 (n=5) received 9.2Gy TBI, 3x10 7 stem cell enriched BM cells on day 0 and 1x10 7 CD4CD45RC+ T-cells on day 10. Results: Transplantation of BN BM cells and CD4CD45RC+ T-cells on day 0 (group 1) resulted in acute GVHD (aGVHD) with splenomegaly, jaundice, skin loss, and erythema. No S82 difference was observed between group 1 and 4 concerning incidence, onset and severity of aGVHD. Delayed infusion of CD4CD45RC+ BN T-cells (group 2) resulted in discrete aGVHD with mild splenomegaly and jaundice. Skin involvement was not observed. One animal progressed to cGVHD with hyperkeratosis, hair loss, slight weight loss and jaundice. Transplantation of CD4CD45RC+ BN T-cells in the absence of BM cells (group 3) resulted in aGVHD and pancytopenia. Transplantation of LEW BM cells and CD4CD45RC+ T-cells on day 10 (group 5) resulted in cGVHD in 2 of 5 animals and mixed aGVHD and cGVHD in the 3 remaining rats. Discussion: The described experimental model (group 5) provides a tool for further analysis of DLI induced cGVHD. We were able to demonstrate that reported models on cGVHD based on transfer of T-cells only result in bone marrow aplasia preventing the use for therapeutic intervention studies as well as long term analysis in cGVHD. Moreover, the transplantation of BN T-cells into LEW/BN rats does not necessarily result in cGVHD as previously reported.",

Sohn (1) Background: Building on a previous investigation identifying poor prognostic factors (lymphocytopenia and visceral involvement) at the onset of acute GVHD (aGVHD) in patients with a history of aGVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), the present study attempted to identify variables that can predict the development of progressive or quiescent-type chronic GVHD (pq cGVHD) and the transplant outcomes after the diagnosis of cGVHD in a cohort of 99 patients who experienced aGVHD after allogeneic SCT. Patients and Methods: Risk factors for pq cGVHD were evaluated using various clinical parameters in a patient group with a history of aGVHD, plus the prognostic significance of various clinical parameters at the diagnosis of cGVHD were examined to determine the prognostic factors for GVHDspecific survival (GSS) in patients with pq cGVHD . Results: Among 118 patients who experienced any degree of aGVHD, 99 patients were evaluated for cGVHD. The incidence of overall and extensive pq cGVHD at 2 years was estimated as 84.4% and 63.1%, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that severe aGVHD (grade 3,4) (p=0.022), primary treatment failure (p=0.009), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (p=0.001) were all significant independent factors predicting a higher overall incidence of pq cGVHD, whereas severe aGVHD (p<0.001), primary treatment failure (p=0.010), and lymphocytopenia (p=0.031) predicted a higher incidence of extensive pq cGVHD. The prediction model of subsequent pq cGVHD validated these risk factors with respect to the overall incidence of pq cGVHD (48.6% versus 91.9% for no risk factor versus 1~3 risk factors) and incidence of extensive pq cGVHD (34.2% versus 59.6% versus 92.2% for no / 1 / 2~3 risk factors). HLA-disparity and the stem cell source were not found to have any influence on the development of pq cGVHD in this cohort. The GSS and probability of systemic immunosuppressive treatment at 2 years after the diagnosis of cGVHD was estimated as 55.9% and 51.9%. The GSS was significantly associated with the performance status (p=0.004) and lymphocytopenia (\u2264 1,000/\u00b5l, p=0.022) at the diagnosis of cGVHD by Cox's proportional hazard model. Conclusion: Severe aGVHD, PTF, lymphocytopenia, and elevated ALP may be useful predictive factors for the development of pq cGVHD in patients who experience aGVHD after allogeneic SCT. Background: Variable endpoints have been investigated in the filed of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) such as GVHD-specific survival (GSS) or the duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment. It enables to evaluate the prognosis of cGVHD patients more precisely than that using overall survival (OS). However, to reach its endpoint, long observation time and follow-up duration is demanding. Accordingly, the new endpoint for the prognosis of cGVHD, the time-to-first attack of acute exacerbation of cGVHD (TTF), was evaluated in the current study. Patients and Methods: Out of 99 patients who experienced acute GVHD and evaluated for cGVHD, 78 patients (79%) was diagnosed as a cGVHD. The correlation of TTF with GSS was performed using time-dependent Cox's proportional regression. Also, GSS and TTF were evaluated as a endpoint of cGVHD according to previously well-known prognostic factors such as extent of cGVHD, the Hopkin's system, and the severity system of cGVHD by Lee et al. Results: The median time to first attack of was 129 days after diagnosis of cGVHD (95% confidence interval 92 to 166 days). The 2 years rates of free from acute exacerbation was estimated as 23.4\u00b15.3%, 53.6\u00b16.6%, and 75.1\u00b16.4% for first, second, and third episode of acute exacerbation of cGVHD. With respect to GSS according to the episode number of acute exacerbation of cGVHD, the group without any episodes showed 95.0\u00b14.9% of GSS rates, while those with 1-, 2-, and 3-episode(s), 54.6\u00b19.7%, 23.5\u00b110.3%, and 63.5\u00b115.0% (Comparing the groups without or with episode of acute exacerbation of cGVHD, 95.0\u00b14.9% versus 47.0\u00b16.9%, p=0.001). In a multivariate survival analysis, time-dependent covariate of TTF was the only independent prognostic factor for GSS. The correlation of TTF with GSS also revealed as regards the extent of cGVHD (p<0.001 versus 0.014), the Hopkin's model (p=0.002 versus 0.05), and the severity of cGVHD by Lee et al (p=0.025 versus <0.001), respectively. The TTF was significantly associated with the progressive type onset (p<0.001) and extensive cGVHD (p=0.032) by Cox's proportional hazard model. Conclusion: The TTF seemed to be well correlated with GSS, and the prognostic factors that were associated with GSS also showed good prognostic implications with respect to TTF. The new endpoint, TTF, might reduce time and labor in further trials or studies of cGVHD.",

Univariate (chi-square/Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (binary logistic regression/Cox regression) analyses were performed to study associations and P values less than 0.05 were regarded as being statistically significant. Clinical factors such as recipient age, gender mismatch (female donor/male recipient), cytomegalovirus (CMV) status and stem cell source were also included in the analyses. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV increased with gender mismatched HSCTs and donor IFNg 3,3 homozygosity (P=0.032 and 0.014 respectively) and decreased when transplant recipients received stem cells from donors with the VDR AA genotype (P=0.038).

Finally, decreased overall survival was demonstrated to associate with the presence of acute GVHD grades II-IV and recipient IL-6-174 GG genotype (P=0.018 and P=0.051 respectively). The findings of this preliminary investigation are encouraging, indicating that immunogenic polymorphisms associate with the development of GVHD and have the potential to influence the outcome of unrelated HSCTs. This investigation was performed on a relatively small cohort and several factors previously shown to influence transplant outcome were not included.",

Shimoni, M. Hertz, I. Hardan, O. Portnoy, N. Shem-Tov, M. Amitai, R. Yerushalmi, A. Nagler, S. Apter Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel-Hashomer, IL) Acute GVHD is the major treatment-related complication after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Acute GVHD of GI tract is a clinical diagnosis supported by histo-pathological findings. The volume of diarrhea determines disease stage and prognosis, however its assessment is inconvenient and inaccurate. Moreover, patients (pts) may present with atypical symptoms while GI-tract biopsies may be falsely negative due to patchy involvement or may be contraindicated in pts with severe thrombocytopenia. This study was designed to determine the CT features associated with acute GI GVHD and to evaluate its role in assessment of severity and prognosis. 41 consecutive pts with symptoms suggestive of acute GI GVHD were evaluated by abdominal CT. 20 pts had clinical stage I-II and 21 had clinical stage III-IV by the Glucksberg criteria. 39 pts had pathological finding in CT. The most consistent finding was thickening of the bowel wall, which was limited to the small (n=14) or large bowel (n=5) or involved both (n=20). Involvement was diffuse or segmental. Other manifestations included intestinal dilatation (n=17), mucosal enhancement (n=6) and gastric wall thickening (n=9). Extra-intestinal findings included mesenteric stranding (n=25), ascites (n=17) and biliary system abnormalities (n=12). 12 pts had urinary excretion of orally administered gastrografin which is not normally absorbed by an intact intestine. Diffuse thickening of the small bowel wall and/or any involvement of the large intestine were patterns associated with severe clinical presentation. 16 and 16 of the 21 pts with clinical stage III-IV had these patterns, compared to 5 and 9 of the 20 pts with stage I-II, respectively (p=0.01). Overall, 23 pts responded to immunesuppressive therapy. 11 pts are alive; 30 died, 16 of complications directly related to GVHD. Diffuse small bowel disease was associated with poor prognosis. Only 8 of 21 pts showing this pattern responded to therapy compared to 15 of 20 pts without this pattern (p=0.04). The cumulative incidence of GVHD-related death was 62% and 24%, respectively (p=0.01). Overall survival was not significantly different in the two groups. In conclusion, abdominal CT may have an important role in the diagnosis of GVHD in atypical presentations and in the prognostic evaluation. Diffuse small intestinal disease is associated with poor response to therapy and GVHD-related mortality. CT findings may direct the clinician in determining the therapeutic approach.",

Dickinson University of Newcastle Upon Tyne (Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD) remains the most serious complication following haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, with an incidence of 40-60% and can be fatal in up to 50% of cases. Extracorporeal phototherapy (ECP) is a novel treatment of both acute and chronic GvHD involving psoralen and UVA (PUVA) treatment of peripheral blood cells with high reported success even in those resistant to conventional immunosuppressive treatments. ECP appears to induce selective immune suppression without increased rates of infection or disease relapse, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In our department the human skin explant model for GvHD has been shown to be highly predictive of clinical GvHD and has been used to investigate the pathophysiology of the disease. The model involves sensitising donor lymphocytes with recipient lymphocytes in vitro in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction and then evaluating the secondary response on recipient skin biopsies by grading the graft-versus-host reactivity (grades I-IV) histopathologically using the Lerner grading system for GvHD. ECP only treats a small proportion of circulating mononuclear cells at each visit, but is able to downregulate GvHD through effects on untreated cells. Similarly in the skin explant model, Graft-versus-Host reactivity of untreated cells was inhibited in 11 out of 19 (p=0.007) experiments by combining the untreated cells with PUVA treated cells. Investigation of the mechanism of this downregulation of alloreactivitity revealed inhibition of T cell proliferation with a dose response dependent upon the ratio of PUVA treated cells to untreated cells. Furthermore downregulation of T cell proliferation only occurred when PUVA treatment was performed on sensitised responder cells. Treatment of na\u00efve cells caused minimal or no inhibition. This selective downregulation of an alloresponse has previously been shown in mice, but this is the first demonstration of the selective action in a human system. This unique human model of ECP will allow investigation of cellmediated and soluble factor changes associated with PUVA treatment of mononuclear cells and thus enable us to better understand the mechanism of action of ECP in the treatment of GvHD. Better understanding of the mechanism is crucial for refining the use of this novel therapy.",

Burns, D. Hart, K. Atkinson, D. Munster, A. Rice Mater Medical Research Institute (South Brisbane, AUS) Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is a major limitation to widespread application of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Dendritic cells (DC) as key initiators of the immune response are central to allogeneic transplant interactions. Preparative myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens aim to control malignancy and ablate host immune responses to facilitate haematopoietic reconstitution. Conditioning also facilitates cytokine release and activates the residual host immune system, driving host DC/donor T cell interactions that result in GVHD. Reducing the intensity of conditioning (RIC) regimens maintains anti-leukaemic activity and reduces treatment related mortality but the overall incidence of GVHD is unchanged. We hypothesise that this may be due to increased persistence of host DC. Whilst there is information on the effects of MAC on DC, there is none on the effects of RIC on DC. We established murine models of conditioning (MAC = Cyclophosphamide [CY] + 800cGy and RIC = Fludarabine + CY + 200cGy). Effects on DC numbers, activation and function, proinflammatory cytokine and systemic endotoxin levels were studied on each day of the conditioning regimens. In the absence of donor cells, a significantly higher proportion of plasmacytoid DC (pDC) was documented in mice receiving MAC (p<0.001), but mice receiving RIC have significantly higher absolute numbers of host pDC. Subsequent HSCT experiments indicate similar levels of donor DC chimerism between the two conditioning regimens. Residual host pDC may explain delayed GVHD in RIC transplant recipients. Upon addition of fully mismatched donor cells, levels of TNFa and IL-1\u00e2 are significantly higher in mice that received MAC when compared to mice that received RIC. Significantly, we have been able to delay, but not prevent, the onset of GVHD by strategic administration of DC depleting antibodies in murine HSCT models. Intra-peritoneal (ip) injection of N418 (500mg), a monoclonal antibody to mouse leukocyte integrin CD11c depleted 50% murine DC in vivo. Subsequent experiments show that 1.0mg of N418 is sufficient to significantly delay, but not prevent, GVHD in a full MHC mismatched model of HSCT (p=0.025). Understanding the impact of conditioning regimens on host DC activation will influence the strategic administration of DC depletion to control GVHD and will improve the safety of HSCT for patients with leukaemia.",

Perseghin (1) Objectives: Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) is frequently used in the treatment of chronic GvHD (cGvHD) refractory to conventional therapy. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action, the optimal treament schedule as well as factors predictive of responsiveness are still to be defined. Patients and methods: 26 patients (pts) with cGvHD were retrospectively evaluated to assess whether a correlation exists between the number of treated peripheral blood (PB) monuclear cells (MNC) and response to treatment. ECP was performed with the two-step method: PB MNC were collected by using a COBE Spectra device, 8-methoxypsoralen (200ng/mL) was added to the yield and UV-A irradiation (2J/cm\u00b2) was then performed. Data are shown as median and range. Results: 482 ECP were performed in 26 pts who previously underwent allogenic related (n=19), unrelated (n=3) or haploidentical (n=4) stem cell transplantation (SCT), and who developed cGvHD refractory to standard therapy; cGvHD occured at 102 days (100-730) from SCT, 22 pts had extensive and 4 limited disease. A median of 20 ECP (8-24) were performed in each case. Three pts were unresponsive (NR), 11 showed a partial response (PR) and 12 a complete response (CR) to ECP treatment, as assessed by at least a 50 % decrease in organ involvement, or by drug tapering. CR pts received a median MNC dose of 127 x 106/Kg (25-75 percentile: 83-173), which significantly differed when compared to PR and NR who received 95 x 106/Kg (25-75 percentile: 61-140) and 63 x 106/Kg (25-75 percentile:50-84) MNC cells, respectively (P< 0.0001). Moreover, MNC cell dose/Kg was identified as a unique predictive factor at multiple regression analysis with stepwise selection (P< 0.0001). Conclusion: Our retrospective study confirmed the usefulness of ECP as a rescue treatment in cGvHD pts. Moreover, we observed a positive relationship between the number of treated MNC cells and response.This finding could prospectively help in tailoring a more appropriate treatment schedule.",

Meyer Johannes-Gutenberg-University (Mainz, D) Skin is the most frequently affected organ in acute graft versus host disease (GvHD). Data in animal models support the hypothesis that the interaction of residing host Langerhans cells (LC) of the epidermis and donor T cells is crucial for the initiation of acute GvHD. Furthermore, donor T cells are necessary to induce the switch of LC from host to donor origin after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in mice. Therefore, the persistence of host LC after T cell depleted allo-SCT is of particular interest. In an ongoing clinical protocol on alemtuzumab-based T cell depleted reduced intensity allo-SCT, we observed acute skin GvHD very early after SCT even in the presence of low T cell numbers in peripheral blood. For prospective LC chimerism analysis, we performed a total of 20 skin punch biopsies of 6mm diameter in 15 patients undergoing this SCT protocol. After CD1a-based immunomagnetic LC isolation from biopsy material, we demonstrated a delayed switch of LC chimerism to full donor status beyond d+100 after transplantation. However, the low LC numbers usually obtained from skin biopsies did not allow for a concomitant analysis of LC purity. Therefore, mixed chimerism results might be caused by contaminating host keratinocytes. Thus, we combined a recently established very short tandem repeat (STR) typing strategy (BioPlex-11) with the detection of the LC-specific marker langerin in a single 12-plex PCR assay. The sense primer for the langerin PCR was located in the first exon, whereas the antisense primer was located in the third exon, allowing the differentiation between cDNA (without introns) and genomic DNA (with introns). Total DNA and RNA were isolated in a single sample by using standard RNA preparation without the DNAse digestion step prior to RT-PCR. The 12plex PCR was performed side by side for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and LC. Langerin PCR did not interfere with the detection of the entire STR systems in PBMC and LC. In addition, the LC-specific marker langerin was exclusively detectable in LC preparations, thereby confirming the specificity of our approach. We have established a sensitive assay allowing the simultaneous detection of donor chimerism together with the LC marker langerin in a 12-plex PCR assay. The addition of further tissue-specific markers might enable us to perform similar chimerism studies on antigen presenting cells of other GvHD target organs.",

Stussi (1) Hemolysis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is mediated by immunological and non-immunological mechanisms. Whereas ABO incompatibility is a known risk factor, there are few studies on the overall incidence, other risk factors and the consequences of hemolysis after HSCT. A retrospective two-center analysis of 860 consecutive patients receiving allogeneic HSCT from 1980-2003 was performed. Hemolysis was defined as a simultaneous elevation of LDH > 300 IU/L, bilirubine > 20 micromol/L, and a decrease in hemoglobin > 10g/L/day. The Kaplan-Meier estimator, cumulative incidence and Cox proportional hazards regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to analyze the two endpoints time to hemolysis and mortality. The cumulative probability of hemolysis at day 100 was 40.7 for major ABO-incompatible transplantations (95% CI 32.9-48.5), 32.9 for minor ABO-incompatibility (95% CI 25.3-40.5), 28.5 for bidirectional ABO-incompatibility (95% CI 14.4-43.0), and 18.4 for ABO compatible HSCT (95% CI 15.0-21.8, p<0.001). The severity of hemolysis was analyzed in a subset of 271 patient according to physician's judgment. It was clinically asymptomatic in 29%, mild in 21%, and moderate to severe in 50% of the patients. The onset of hemolysis occurred after a median time of 10 days (range, 1-274 days) without significant differences among the groups of ABO-incompatibility. Patients with hemolysis required 10 RBC transfusions whereas patients without hemolysis received only 5 (p<0.001). Risk factors associated with hemolysis were ABO-incompatibility (RR, 2.1; 95 CI 1.6-2.8), HSCT from an unrelated donor (RR, 2.2; 95 CI 1.6-3.0), and acute GvHD grade II-IV (RR, 1.9; 95 CI 1.3-2.8). In contrast, age at HSCT, gender, stem cell source, GvHD prophylaxis, reduced-intensity conditioning, rhesus and HLA mismatches were not associated with more hemolysis. The combination of hemolysis and acute GvHD was negatively associated with overall survival: One-year survival was 78.3 (95 CI 74.0-82.6) in the absence of hemolysis and GvHD in the presence of hemolysis without in the presence of GvHD II-IV without hemolysis, and 38.0 (95 CI 28.2-47.8, p<0.001) if both complications were present. In conclusion, posttransplant hemolysis is a frequent event after allogeneic HSCT even outside ABO-incompatibility and independently associated with poorer survival in combination with acute GvHD.",

Gungor, K. Dalva, E. Soydan Akcaglayan, M. Beksac Ankara University (Ankara, TR) Killer Ig-like receptors is a major cluster of the natural killer cell receptors whose role has been demonstrated in haploidentical or matched unrelated hematopoietic transplants. The role of KIR matches on outcome has not been published in related transplants yet. Since the initial reports, new KIR alleles and ligands have been defined. To analyze the frequency of inhibitory and activatory KIR alleles, their effect in the presence or absence of relevant ligands, we initiated this retrospective study in 2004. To exclude the effects of disease type, we included only all the AML, CML patients transplanted at our center. Patients and Methods: 83 Patients (M/F:45/38)transplanted from their HLA matched siblings were included. All patients and donors typed for HLA-A,-B by serological and/or molecular techniques (PCR SSP); HLA-C,-DRB1 were typed using PCR-SSP/SSO method. KIR genes (2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3,  2DL4, 2DL5A, 2DL5B, 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS4*001/002,  2DS4*003, 2DS5, 3DL1, 3DL2, 3DL2, 3DL3, 3DS1, 2DP1 , 3DP1*001/002, 3DP1*003) were typed with KIR Genotyping SSP Kit (Pel-Freeze, Dynal Biotech, US). Results: In 74.6% of the patients 1-9 allele mismatches(mm) were observed. 49 patient-donor pairs had mm at the 10 inhibitory loci whereas 51 pairs had mm at the 5 activatory loci. Allele distribution within the recipients and donors showed a frequency of 55%(2DL5a)-100 %(2DL4). The rate of acute or chronic GVHD was analzed in all KIR match/mm and significant ones are summarized : Acute GVHD was observed more frequently among patients with 2DL5a, 2DS5, 3DS1 mm. Overall survival was also better in the presence of 2DL5a (p=0.055)(GvH), 2DS5 match (p=0.06), 3DS1match(p=0.064). DFS was better for 2DS1(p=0.046)(HvG), 2DS5 match(p=0.003). The KIR ligand was only important only in cases with 2DS4 A1 type(+) and lack of the ligand C*04 where AGVHD was observed more frequently(p=0.027). None of these were found to be influential on chronic GVHD. Conclusion: Mm at the inhibitory loci were noted more frequently than activatory alleles. These results emphasize the role of the most infrequent allele 2DL5a as an GVHD enhancer or supressor depending on the mm direction: GvH or HvG. In the previous reports aGVHD,OS and DFS were also found to be influenced in the unrelated setting. In conclusion, KIR alleles are more important than the ligands. KIR match/mm which influence OS, DFS and acute GVHD must be included into the analysis when predictors of outcome are being evaluated.",

Most of these genes are involved in the regulation of immune response and inflammatory reactions towards pathogens. The heme oxygenase (HO) protein is the rate limiting enzyme in heme degradation to biliverdin, free iron and carbon monoxide. Its inducible form I (HO-I) is constitutively expressed in the spleen due to the abundance of its substrate. It is inducible in a wide range of tissues upon exposure to cellular stress factors such as irradiation, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, proinflammatory cytokines and heat shock. Further, HO-I is involved in regulating inflammatory response and has been described as a protective gene in solid organ transplantation. In man the promoter region displays length polymorphism due to a variable number of gt repeats within a 500bp region upstream of the TATA box.

Overall GvHD (\u2265 grade III) and grade III gut GvHD displayed a trend towards significance (p=0.088 overall GvHD, p=0.056 gut GvHD). Overall survival was influenced by pre transplant disease stage, with a bias towards more advanced disease in the group with \u2264 30gt repeats (high HO-1 expression). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of pretransplant factors such as age, disease stage, sibling/unrelated donor etc., polymorphism in the donor HO-1 displayed a significant influence on overall survival (p=0.027). These data suggest a role for HO-I in GvHD pathophysiology and involvement in reactivity towards proinflammatory stimuli since HO-1 is mainly expressed in monocytes and macrophages.",

Wolff (1) Introduction: Although Sirolimus is a well established immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation, limited data are available on treatment of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Here, we report the interim analysis of a German multicenter phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of Sirolimus in the treatment of cGVHD. Methods: Fifteen patients with steroid refractory cGVHD (lichenoid n=3, sclerodermoid n=12) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were entered into the study. All patients had multi organ involvement including the skin in eleven patients, and five patients had bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment consisted of Sirolimus with an initial dose of 0.5mg and subsequent dose escalation according to plasma levels (5-15ng/ml) combined with Prednisolon <1mg/kg/day. Eight patients received additional FK506 adjusted for plasma levels (5-15ng/ml) and one patient received additional mycophenolat mofetil. Steroid refractory cGVHD was defined as no response to Prednisolon 1mg/kg/d given for at least 1 month. Six patients received Sirolimus as second line treatment, nine patients received more than one treatment regimen for cGVHD prior to Sirolimus. Results: Long lasting complete remission was achieved in one and partial response in five patients. Eight patients did not respond to treatment with Sirolimus. The follow up of one patient is to short for evaluation. Three of eight patients receiving Sirolimus combined with FK506 developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which resolved after withdrawal of FK506 and Sirolimus (n=2) or FK506 only (n=1). One additional patient developed temporary TTP through the phase of initiation of Sirolimus and concurrent taper of cyclosporin. Two patients developed thrombocytopenia and three patients developed hypercholesterolemia. The occurrence of TTP in patients receiving FK506 and Sirolimus lead to an amendment, which excluded the combined treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor. Fourteen patients are currently alive with a follow up ranging from 1-21 months after initiation of treatment with Sirolimus. One patient died due to bacterial sepsis 1 year after initiation of Sirolimus and Prednisolon. Conclusion: The results suggest that Sirolimus is an effective treatment in a subgroup of patients with steroid refractory cGVHD. However, combined treatment with FK506 is associated with considerable toxicity (TTP), and further evaluation of Sirolimus in the treatment of cGVHD is warranted. Introduction: The recent discovery of the von Willebrand Factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) and the association of its defficiency with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has generated enormous interest. We aimed to evaluate the ADAMTS13 activity weekly after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and its relationship with clinical outcome,complications. Patients ans Method: We studied thirthy patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with different conditioning regimens in Ankara University School of Medicine, Hematology Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit and fifteen healthy controls. Plasmas were collected from patients prior to the initiation of the conditioning regimen (day -10), allogeneic cell infusion day (day 0) and post transplantation day 7, day 14, day 21 and day 28. Besides, plasma samples were further obtained from patients with acute or chronic GvHD. Median follow-up was 13 months (6-24 months).Activity of the enzyme was studied by residuel Ristocetin co factor based method as described by M Bohm. Results: ADAMTS13 activity of healthy controls were found between 76% and 136%. Enzyme activities of patients did not show a significante change through weeks (figure). None of our patients had enzyme activity lower than %5.Enzyme activity of the patients on the day of acute GVHD was not significantly different from pretransplantation period (73%\u00b132% vs 87%\u00b120%, p=0.231) but lower than healthy controls (73%\u00b1 32 vs 97%\u00b116, p=0.02). Besides, on day 28 patients with acute GvHD (n=14) had lower enzyme activity than those without acute GvHD (n=16) (62% \u00b136% vs 95% \u00b1 22%, p=0.009).ADAMTS13 activity was lower in samples taken from patients with chronic GVHD (n=15) compared to baseline level (67%\u00b1 13% vs 91%\u00b130%, p=0.15) and to healthy controls (67% \u00b113% vs 97%\u00b116%, p=0,002).The enzyme activity of the patients at febrile neutropenia period was lower than the pretransplantation period (68%\u00b1 25% vs 78% \u00b120%, p=0,418) and healthy controls (%68\u00b125 vs %97\u00b116, p=0.004).We did not observe any thrombotic complications such as TTP, hepatic VOD and others. Conclusion: According to our data, transplantation does not have significant effect on ADAMTS13 activity. Acute or chronic GVHD and infections (febrile events) cause a slight decrease of the enzyme activity which may indicate the possible cytokine effect . To our knowledge, this is the first study done for allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients with this method.",

These effects or graft-versus-tumour (GvT) reaction is interrelated however, with potentially deleterious graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), one of the major limitations of allogeneic HSCT. Mutated tumor-associated antigens, as well as selectively or aberrantly expressed nonmutated antigens, represent potential tumor-associated antigens (TAA) for T cell-mediated GvT effects that are in principle, separable from generalized anti-host responses. We have previously demonstrated that a significant CD8+ T cell-mediated TAA-specific GvT effect accounts for immunological tumor control after allogeneic HSCT. We now sought to expand our initial findings to spontaneously occurring less immunogenic tumor cell lines. In addition, we asked what impact GvHD on GvT effects in the absence of alloantigens on tumor cells had. [C57BL/6 x BALB/c]F1 (H-2b/d) mice were transplanted with whole bone marrow with or without splenocytes from allogeneic C57BL/6 (H-2b) or BALB/c (H-2d) donors. Recipient mice were inoculated subcutaneously with hematological and solid tumors derived from either parental strain. In this setting it was possible to study GvT effects in the absence of alloantigens on tumor cells. Furthermore, using different numbers of coinjected donor splenocytes the interrelation of GvHD intensity and alloantigen independent GVT effects was assessed. While in allograft recipients having weak or no GvHD tumors grew progressively, a significant tumoralloantigen independent GvT effect against all tumors tested was present in animals undergoing intense GvHD. These data indicate that a biologically relevant GvT effect that is independent of alloantigen recognition on tumor cells is active for a broad variety of tumors and is influenced by GvHD intensity.",

Holler (1) (1)University of Regensburg (Regensburg, D); (2)University of Haukeland (Bergen, N) So far, only few reports have described the role of Langerhans cells (LC) and markers of apoptosis in the context of skin graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). We therefore performed a retrospective analysis of CD4, CD8, CD1a, activated Caspase 3 and HSP70 expression in skin biopsies obtained from 26 patients with suspected acute or early chronic GvHD and compared the results with those obtained in skin biopsies from 6 non-transplant patients (ND). Immunohistological results expressed as numbers of positive cells/ocular field were correlated with major clinical variables. The statistical analysis was performed using the Student`s t-test. There was no significant correlation between the number of T helper cells in the skin and occurrence of acute GvHD. However, the numbers of CD8+ T cells were significantly higher both in the epidermis and dermis of patients suffering from GvHD compared to ND: The mean number of CD8+ cells in the epidermis of ND was 0.91 +/-1.1 per ocular field. In contrast, in patients suffering from overall GvHD grades up to 2 (n=13) the numbers of CD8+ were 5.7 +/-6.6 (p< 0.05). Similar results of increased CD8+ were obtained in patients with more severe GvHD (> grade 2; n=13). In contrast, LC numbers were significantly lower in post-transplant patients (p< 0.01 for GvHD \u2264 2; p< 0.001 for GvHD> 2) compared to ND. Beside an association of low LC counts with GvHD, kinetics of LC recovery after transplantation seemed to have an additional impact on LC numbers. The CD1a+ cells declined immediately after transplantation (Tx) and recovered slowly with time. Even biopsies taken more than 100 days after Tx showed mean CD1a values less than half of the NDs mean CD1a numbers. Furthermore, there is an additional strong correlation between LC numbers and the amount of corticosteroid treatment given to the patient at the time of biopsies. Furthermore, apoptosis was assessed as percentage of caspase 3+ cells. Severe GvHD and consecutive transplant related mortality (TRM) were correlated with increased expression of activated caspase 3 in the epidermis (p<0.05). The mean caspase 3 expression in NDs was 0.015 +/-0.02, whereas patients dying due to TRM showed a mean expression of 1.56 +/-3.95. Our results confirm apoptosis as an hallmark of clinical GvHD. Further, the observed correlation between diminished LC numbers and occurrence of GvHD indirectly indicates that T cell priming occurs rather in the lymph nodes than in the affected GvH-tissue.",

Rabitsch, P. Hoecker, R. Knobler, A. Schulenburg, D. Pohlreich, F. Wrba, P. Kalhs Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, A) The standard initial therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is corticosteroids. Thereby, 40% to 50% of patients experience a complete or partial response. Higher mortality rates directly attributable to acute GVHD or subsequent immunosuppression required for treatment of GVHD have been reported in steroid-refractory GVHD patients. Extracorporeal exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to the photosensitizing agent 8methoxypsoralen and UV-A radiation (ECP) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of selected T-cell mediated diseases. We performed a study in patients with acute GVHD grades II to IV to improve response to first-line therapy by adding ECP. Fourteen patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) from 3 related and 11 unrelated donors. In 5 cases an HLA-mismatch between recipient and donor was present. Onset of acute GVHD was after a median of 28 (range, 9 to 58) days after HSCT. Seven patients had grade II, 4 grade III and 3 grade IV acute GVHD. Organs involved included skin in all patients, liver in 6 and gut in 2. After a median of 4 (range, 1 to 6) days of steroids at 2 mg/kg body weight ECP could be started on 2 consecutive days per week (=1 cycle) and was given for a median of 5 (range, 1 to 10) cycles administered within a median of 1.5 (range, 0.5 to 3) months in addition to conventional immunosuppression with cyclosporine A and prednisone. Complete responses to firstline therapy were achieved in 93% of patients with cutaneous, 83% with liver and 100% with gut involvement. Complete resolution of GVHD was obtained in 100% of patients with grade II and III and 67% with grade IV GVHD. Probability of transplant-related mortality at 4 years after HSCT is 15%. After a median follow-up of 20 (range, 4 to 36) months since discontinuation of ECP, 10 patients are alive including 7 without chronic GVHD. Two patients (14%) died of relapse of hematologic disease. Probability of survival at 4 years after HSCT is 71%. Thus, ECP is an effective adjunct therapy for newly diagnosed acute GVHD resulting in excellent patient survival.",

Activated OX40+ donor T-Lymphocytes exert cytotoxicity against target-host tissues liberating lysosomal granulation, which exposes lysosomal membrane on cell surface. Therefore, detection of surface lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1, CD107a) on T cells is a novel assay for quantifying antigen-specific T cytotoxic lymphocytes. Nevertheless, the expression of CD107a in the context of GVHD has not been evaluated yet. Patients and Methods: We studied 24 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematological diseases between May 2004 and April 2005.

We prospectively analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) a total of 92 peripheral blood samples (32 obtained before 100 days post-HSCT and 60 obtained after 100 days post-HSCT). After gating T cells according to CD3 positivity, absolute number and percentage of CD4+OX40+, CD8+OX40+, CD4+CD107a+ and CD8+CD107a+ T cells were measured as markers of activation and cytotoxicity respectively.

In addition, samples of patients with aGVHD had superior percentage of activated CD4 lymphocytes OX40+ (29.1 % vs 14 %, p 0.05). Samples (n 43) from patients developing chronic GVHD (cGVHD) harboured superior absolute number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes than those from patients without cGVHD (n 17), mainly CD8+CD107a+ lymphocytes (89.1 vs 16.7 x10 9 /L, p 0.01). This finding was correlated with a superior number of CD8+OX40+ lymphocytes in patients with cGVHD (370 vs 116 x10 9 /L, p 0.01). We did not found statistical differences in CD107a+ cells, when comparing samples from patients with or without active CMV viral replication. Conclusions: Despite immunosuppression therapy, peripheral blood donors T lymphocytes exert antigen-specific cytotoxic activity measurable using MFC.

Dickinson University of Newcastle upon Tyne (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) Graft versus Host disease (GvHD) remains the major limitation to successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation and contributes significantly to transplant related mortality and morbidity. Steroid refractory or steroid depending GvHD is linked to poor survival or life quality. Second line therapy has shown limited success so far and increases susceptability for infection and relapse. Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) is a promising therapy for acute and chronic GvHD not responding to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The mechanisms of action of ECP in GvHD include lymphocyte senescence or apoptosis and cytokine modulation. Some groups hypothesised that antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells (Dc) might contribute to ECP mechanisms. We have developed an in vitro model of ECP (in vitro PUVA) to investigate ECP effects on antigen presenting cells. Initial experiments have shown the maturation of monocyte derived Dcs treated with in vitro PUVA (upregulation of CD83, CD86, HLA-DR) as well as reduced endocytosis capacity. The stimulatory capacity of in vitro PUVA treated Dcs was strongly inhibited in autologous and allogeneic MLR. However, treatment of antigen-primed Dcs resulted in less inhibition, suggesting factors that might preserve Dc stimulatory capacities. Immature Dcs, retrieved after coculture with in vitro PUVA treated lymphocytes, show inhibited stimulatory capacity on autologous and allogeneic T cells. Currently, we are investigating the changes in phenotype and cytokine pattern which could transfer anergy or promote tolerance induction. In parallel, we are analysing effects on monocytederived dendritic cells from patients undergoing ECP treatment for chronic GvHD. Dcs rendered tolerogenic could play a major role in ECP mechanisms.",

Aims: In this study we analyzed the number and phenotypic characteristics of circulating APCs in patients with and without chronic GVHD (cGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Flow cytometry analysis was performed on fresh peripheral blood (PB) (n=19) and bone marrow (BM) (n=7) samples of patients with cGVHD. As control, we analyzed PB (n=12) and BM (n=15) samples of patients without cGVHD and at comparable time after transplant. Each sample was stained to detect BDCA-1+ myeloid DC (mDC), BDCA-2+ CD123+ plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and CD14+ monocytes, as well as the expression of adhesion receptors (CD62L and CD49e), costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86 and CD40) and chemokine receptors (CXCR3, CXCR4, CCR5 and CCR7) on the surface of APCs. Results: Patients with cGVHD showed increased numbers of CD14+ cells in the BM (p=0.006), but not in the PB (p=0.09), and similar numbers of mDC and pDC, as compared to patients without cGVHD. CD14+ cell populations were then compared in the two groups, and in patients with cGVHD a greater Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of CD86 was observed both in BM (p=0.02) and PB (p=0.04). A trend for an increased expression of CXCR4 chemokine receptor was also observed in PB monocytes (p=0.06) of patients with cGVHD. Analysis of these markers in mDC and pDC showed no correlation with cGVHD. Interestingly, in patients with cGVHD who were analyzed after treatment with prednisone >1mg/kg, the expression of CD86 on monocytes was significantly reduced both in BM (p=0.02) and PB (p=0.04). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that in patients with cGVHD: there is a greater number of CD14+ monocytes in the BM; both in BM and PB CD14+ monocytes are more activated with higher expression of CD86 and CXCR4; treatment with prednisone significantly downregulates the expression of these receptors. Since a quantitative and qualitative difference in circulating CD14+ monocytes, but not mDC or pDC, is observed in patients with cGVHD, we hypothesize a role of donor CD14+CD86+ DC precursors in the pathogenesis of cGVHD.",

Deville (1) Steroid-resistant acute GVHD (aGVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) continues to be associated with a high mortality. Daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor has been recently used in this indication. The aim of our retrospective study was to identify prognostic factors associated with response to therapy and survival. Twenty patients with grade II to IV steroid-resistant aGVHD have been treated in our institution between 1997 and 2004. The median age of the cohort was 52 (18 to 60). All patients had hematological malignancies of which 12 were in an advanced phase at time of alloSCT. Thirteen patients received a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen. The origin of the stem cells was bone marrow for 11 patients and peripheral blood for 9 patients. Donor types were HLA-matched related (n=14) or unrelated (n=2), and HLA-mismatched unrelated (n=4). Treatment consisted of daclizumab 50mg/day given i.v. from day 1 to day 7 and tapered twice a week for the first week and then once a week, the duration of the treatment depending on the evolution. The median number of doses per patient was 10 (5-35) and the median duration of treatment was 27 days (5-150). Daclizumab was well tolerated but 70% of the patients experienced infections during or after the treatment. The overall response rate at day 8 and day 28 were 50% and 49%, respectively. Complete response was observed for 3 patients (15%) at day 8 and 5 patients (25%) at day 28. The overall survival of the cohort was 35% with a median survival time of 192 days. The cause of death was recurrence of aGVHD for 6 patients, infection for 2 patients, prolonged aplasia for 1 patient and relapse of the primary disease for 4 patients. An advanced phase of the disease at time was associated with a poor response rate at day 8 or day 28 (p = 0,005 and p = 0,01, respectively) and had also a negative pronostic impact on survival (p = 0,03). Response to therapy at day 8 or day 28 was independently associated with improved survival (p = 0,002 and p = 0,0004, respectively). In conclusion, daclizumab in the treatment of steroid-resistant aGVHD provides an acceptable response rate. Disease status at transplant is strongly associated with response and survival rates. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the best treatment dose and duration and to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from this approach.",

Conlan (2) (1)University of Schleswig-Holstein (Luebeck, D) ; (2)Cerus Corporation (Concord, USA) Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD) is an infrequent, but fatal complication associated with transfusion of cellular blood components. At present, gammairradiation (g-irrad) is the only acceptable method for preventing TA-GvHD. 25 cGy of g-irrad inactivates T lymphocytes while preserving the functional integrity of the blood components. The INTERCEPT Blood SystemTM (IBS) for platelets uses amotosalen and UVA to inactivate viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Although both IBS treatment and girrad inactivated >5 logs of T lymphocytes in platelet concentrates, IBS is more robust, with the ability to still inactivate >5 logs of T cells if the treatment dose is reduced by 1,000-fold, whereas if the gamma dose is dropped by 10fold, only 1-log inactivation can be obtained. In a mouse model of TA-GvHD, IBS treatment of T lymphocytes prevented TA-GvHD. To evaluate further the clinical efficacy of IBS for prevention of TA-GvHD, we compared the incidence of TA-GvHD after transfusion of IBS platelets (IP) without g-irrad to conventional platelets (CP) with g-irrad in 3 European clinical trials involving 166 patients in which IP or CP were given for up to 56 days to thrombocytopenic patients with malignancies or therapies that would put them at risk for TA-GvHD. 71% of CP patients (n = 51) were judged by treating physicians to be at risk for TA-GvHD and received g-irrad CP (268 transfusions). 29% of CP patients were judged not at risk for TA-GvHD and received CP without g-irrad. 93% of IP patients (n = 87) received only IP without g-irrad (575 transfusions). All patients were monitored for development of TA-GvHD for up to 28 days after the last transfusion. 52% of IP patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia and 48% with other malignancies. Among IP patients, 32% received stem cell transplants and 68% chemotherapy only. IP patients received a mean of 6.1 transfusions per patient (1 to 21) without girrad. 35% of g-irrad CP patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia and 65% with other malignancies. Among g-irrad CP patients, 63% received stem cell transplants and 37% chemotherapy only. G-irrad CP patients received a mean of 5.4 transfusions (1 to 26) per patient. No cases of TA-GvHD were identified in either IP or g-irrad CP patients. These results support prior in vitro and animal data, indicating that INTERCEPT treatment of platelets may replace g-irrad in preventing TA-GvHD in an at-risk population.",

Baro, S. Hermana, J. Gomez, M. Lopez, A. Iriondo Marques Valdecilla Hospital (Santander, E) Introduction: Digestive complications are frequent after allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Their main causes are graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infections and toxicity. The clinical presentation of each disease is non-specific. Aims: To study the relation between the clinical parameters and the histological and molecular studies of intestinal biopsies of HSCT patients. Patients and methods: We studied the intestinal biopsies of 29 patients (18 male/11 female) who had a HSCT between 1999 and 2005. Eighteen patients had received myeloablative conditioning (12 BU/CY, 5 CY/TBI) and 11 patients nonmyeloablative. The prophylaxis of GVHD was cyclosporine and metotrexate in 21 patients and cyclosporine and mycophenolate in the rest. The stem cell source was bone marrow (17) or peripheral blood (12). Nine patients underwent HLA-matched unrelated transplantation. The majority of patients developed mucositis. All patients developed acute GVHD (11 grade III-IV), the majority with digestive involvement. Ten of 18 patients evaluated presented chronic GVHD. Ten patients had serious digestive complications. At the time of biopsy, 17 patients were on corticoid treatment. Results: Median time from symptoms until the biopsy was 15 days. Sixteen patients (55%) presented a positive CMV antigenemia (6 previous and 10 during episode). The following table shows the relation between clinical suspicion histology and PCR. 24/29 patients (83%) showed coincidence between clinical suspicion and histology. In 22 of 26 patients (85%) with suspected GVHD, histology confirmed this diagnosis. In 8 of these patients virus were also detected by PCR but their role in the clinical picture remained uncertain. In 3 patients with suspected GVHD (11.5%) both histology and PCR indicated viral infection. All of them had received intensive immunosupression (based on clinical suspicion) an died because of infectious complications. In all cases the previous CMV antigenemia was negative. Conclusions: In the majority of cases, clinical suspicion coincided with the pathological and molecular studies. However, in some cases histology and PCR indicated an alternative diagnosis with decisive therapeutic implications. An early intestinal biopsy may help in clinical decision making.",

Since acute GvHD grade \u2265 2 requires intensive immunosuppression, a correct diagnosis is crucial. At time of therapeutic decision making, however, histologic results often are pending. Previously we had found that macroscopic findings such as redness and granulation of the mucosa, aphthous lesions, erosions, ulcerations, confluent defects, mucosal bleeding and loss of epithelium can be regarded as criteria for intestinal involvement of acute GvHD. Depending on the extent of these findings in sigmoidoscopy we had established a score from grades 1 to 4 ( Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 1994; 6: 723-729) . Using these criteria we investigated whether colonoscopy is an appropriate method for a rapid and reliable diagnosis of acute intestinal GvHD. Patients and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 35 colonoscopies in 35 successive patients with acute intestinal GvHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The median age was 57.6 years (range 34.5-68.4 years). They were transplanted for AML (n=6), AML/MDS (n=9), MDS (n=6), CML (n=1), NHL (n=5), CLL (n=1), MM (n=2) and MPS (n=3). All patients received fludarabine, BCNU and melphalan for conditioning. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetile (n=29) or mini-MTX (n=6). In case of unrelated donor grafts (n=13), anti-T-cell globulin ATG-S was additionally administered. Colonoscopies were evaluated using the described criteria, and a comparison between macroscopy, histology and clinical grading was performed. Results: In no patient colonoscopy induced a complication such as major bleeding, perforation, or infections. In all 35 patients with clinically suspected GvHD \u2265 2 and histologically proven intestinal GvHD \u2265 2 macroscopy showed aphthous lesions (grade 3) and/or ulcerations/confluent mucosal defects (grade 4). The sensitivity of macroscopic examination of the colon including the terminal ileum for correct diagnosis of GvHD \u2265 2 amounted to 100%. Conclusions: (1) Colonoscopy can be safely performed even in patients with high-grade GvHD.",

Dilloo University of Duesseldorf Medical School (Duesseldorf, D) The role of HLA-C mismatch was assessed in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent HSCT (excluding cord blood) with a non-sibling donor in a single center. Donor selection was performed prospectively on the basis of HLA A, B low resolution and DRB1, DQB1 high resolution-typing. High resolution HLA-A,B,C-typing was performed retrospectively for all patient/donor pairs. To analyse the influence of HLA-class I, transplantations mismatched for HLA-DRB1 and/or -DQB1 (n=4) were excluded from the analysis. Overall, 43 patients aged 0-18 years (median: 8,2 years) who were transplanted with an unrelated (n=35) or non-sibling family (n=8) donor with a typical disease distribution for pediatric transplant recipients (11 ALL, 8 AML, 8 MDS, 3 JMML, 3 CML, 3 FEL, 1 NHL, 1 M. Hodgkin) were included in the analysis. Based on high resolution typing, 21 donor/recipient pairs were completely matched for HLA-A,B, and C. 11 pairs matched for HLA-A and B had HLA-C-mismatch(es) (MM) and 11 pairs were mismatched for HLA-A and/or HLA-B and/or HLA-C with a maximum of 3 MM. Mismatches for HLA-A, B, and C based on high(low) resolution were present in 5(3), 6(4), and 17(15) transplantations, respectively. Upon evaluation of the influence of HLA-C high resolution MM on severe aGvHD (aGvHD III-IV), only 4/26 pts without HLA-C-MM developed severe aGvHD compared to 8/17 pts with HLA-C MM (p=0,037). When only HLA-C low resolution MM were included, this correlation changed to 4/28 vs. 8/15 (p=0,012). There was no significant correlation between severe aGvHD HLA-AB MM, HLA-A MM or HLA-B MM. Other critical transplantation parameters like patient age, sex, underlying disease, stem cell source or HLA-C KIR epitope had also no influence on severe aGvHD. In those pts evaluable for chronic GvHD there was no difference between pts transplanted from an HLA-C MM vs. -matched donor. As in other studies, in our transplantation cohort, aGvHD III-IV is significantly correlated with transplant-related mortality (TRM). There was correlation between HLA-C MM and TRM which can be explained by other factors influencing TRM and the overall limited numbers of pts. In conclusion, the high risk of GvHDIII-IV in pts. with HLA-C MM documents the necessity for HLA-C typing for optimal donor selection in T-cell replete transplants.

S. Saba, C. Canepa, J. Malacalza, C. Mendez, G. Garcia, C. De Leo, M. Granero Hospital Rossi (La Plata, RA) Purpose: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is an important complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Severe airflow obstruction was recognized as a serious pulmonary drawback of this disease. We conducted a study to examine every spirometries realized before and after the following periods : 6 months, -1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years and more than 3 years, once HSCT was done. Patients and Methods: Airway Obstruction was defined as decline of FVE1 and FEF25-75 in subjects with FVE1/FVC ratio 0,8 less and change of FVE1 and FEF25-75 as follows: Post -Baseline/Baseline x 100. From 88 evaluated patients with allogeneic HSCT, 29 (33%) developed cGVHD. All patients had normal pulmonary function before HSCT. Results: The change of VEF1 in subjects with cGVHD was -18,7%; -24%; -23,8% and -22,4% versus -2,9%: -5,1%: -2,6% and -11,8% in subjects without cGVHD in reference to the above mentioned periods (p<0,001). The change of FEF25-75 in subjects with cGVHD was -38,7%; -43,6%; -45% and -46% in the same periods versus -7,2%; -15,4%; -y 4,6% y -10% in subjects without cGVHD (p<0,001). Conclusions:The decline of FEF25-75 was more important than VEF1 during 6 moths/1year period (-38,7% vs -18,7%)(p<0,001). In order to improve the sensitivity of the diagnosis cGVHD after allogeneic HSCT; we infer that the diagnosis should be based on decreases in FEF25-75% rather than on FEV1.",

Vande Broek, A. Willekens, I. Van Riet, R. Schots AZ-VUB (Brussel, B) The aim of this study was to compare 2 doses of fixed donor T cell add-backs in allogeneic CD34+ selected (CliniMACS) peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) recipients with respect to early (<d100) transplant-related mortality (TRM) and incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD). We analysed 2 consecutive cohorts of patients (pts) receiving either 1x10 6 (n=22) or 1x10 5 (n=18) CD3+ cells per kg BW added to the transplanted stem cells on d0. The median age was 37 yrs (range: 6-56 yrs); 22 were male and 18 female; 27 (67.5%) had a HLA-identical and 15 a volunteer unrelated donor; 16 (40%) had CML in first chronic phase or acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in first remission or severe aplastic anemia (all defined as good risk category) while 24 others had lymphoma, myeloma or more advanced leukemias. All had myeloablative conditioning and cyclosporin A as additional GVHD prevention. CRP was daily monitored (nephelometry, nl value: < 5 mg/L) from d0 until discharge or early death. TRMd100 occurred in 11 (27.5%) pts after a median of 46 days (range: 25-85 days). In univariate analysis, TRMd100 was not significantly associated with the level of T cell addback (32% vs 22%, P= 0.72) or with the type of transplant or disease risk category or number of CD34+ cells infused. Only mean CRP levels during d0-d5 (P= 0.017) and d6-d10 (P= 0.038) were associated with TRMd100. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with CRP levels exceeding 100 mg/L on 2 consecutive days (CRP>100) during the first 10 days after PBSCT had a higher probability of TRMd100 (50 +/-28% vs 18 +/-14%, P= 0.014). Stepwise logistic regression identified CRP>100 as an independent risk factor for TRMd100 (OR: 4.6, P= 0.045). The use of 10 6 versus 10 5 T cells (per kg BW) as add-back dramatically increased the incidence of AGVHD \u2265 II (50% vs 6%, P= 0.004) with a clear impact on early but also on late transplant morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: 1) monitoring of CRP levels is a practical tool to identify pts at risk of early TRM after allogeneic PBSCT; 2) immediate T cell add-back of 10 6 CD3+ cells cannot be recommended because of the high risk of severe AGVHD.",

Stenberg, U. Stenevi, M. Brune Gothenburg University (Gothenburg, S) Objective: To identify and characterize cells of donor origin in the ocular surface after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Patients: Nine women in CR, median age 40 (31-61) yrs, with CML (n=3) or AML (n=6), allografted from male donors (4 siblings, 5 unrelated) using bone marrow (n=1) or blood stem cells (n=8), after full (n=5) or reduced (n=4) conditioning. Samples were obtained at a median of 20 (10-72) months after transplant. Mild signs or symptoms of ocular GvHD were present in 7 patients (pts). Methods: Conjunctival cells were sampled from pts and 18 healthy controls by blotting the eye with a sterile filter membrane lifting an imprint from the ocular surface. Cells thus obtained were immediately fixed and analysed on the filter using immunohistochemistry markers for epithelial cytokeratin 3 and 19, leukocyte CD45, and myofibroblast (MFB) alpha-SMA (Smooth Muscle Actin). Donor cells were identified using sex-chromosome specific fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results: The number of cells lifted off the conjunctiva averaged 11500 (9600-15200) and cells were typically arranged in a monolayer, predominated by recipient epithelial (70%) and goblet (10%) cells. We found no donor epithelial cells; however, other cells of donor origin (XY genotype) were observed in all 9 patients, accounting for a mean of 9% (range 3-12) of all cells on the filter and distributed as 6% (2-27) CD45+/aSMA+ MFB and 3% cells not possible to categorize. A further 3% of cells were MFB of recipient origin (XX genotype). No MFB were observed on cytological imprints from healthy controls. Discussion: MFB are cells considered to be involved in the wound-healing process and the finding of superficially located conjunctival MFB would suggest a role for these cells in ocular GvHD. In this small group of pts, there was no apparent association between content of MFB and presence or severity of local or systemic chronic GvHD, or other clinical parameters such as type of donor or time from transplant. The finding of MFB (CD45+/aSMA+) of both donor and recipient origin in allografted pts may indicate that the MFB found have differentiated not only from progenitors or stem cells in the graft, but also from remaining recipient cells. The role of conjunctival donor and recipient MFB, as well as the differentiation route(s) of these cells after allo-SCT, should be the focus of future studies. Introduction: CsA is a cornerstone for the prophylaxis of GvHD after allogeneic SCT with a narrow therapeutic window. CsA monitoring is usually done using CsA trough levels (C0). However, data from solid organ transplant recipients have shown a much better correlation of 2-h blood level concentrations (C2) with the CsA exposure as compared to the through level (C0). Here, we present data of paediatric patients after SCT, where full pharmacokinetic CsA profiles were undertaken. Patients and Methods: Monitoring of 40 full CsApharmacokinetic profiles was performed following a 2-hour infusion (measurement of CsA levels before, one hour after initiation of the CsA infusion, and 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 hours thereafter) in 27 children (age at SCT 0.9-20 years; median 9.2). The indication for SCT was leukaemia (n=15), non-malignant haematological diseases (n=9) and metabolic or immunologic disorders (n=3). Patients received a median CsA dosage of 3mg/kg/day at a 12 hours interval starting 36 hours prior to SCT. CsA was regularly adjusted to maintain a trough level of 90-200ng/ml. Results: The mean CsA level prior to infusion (C0) was 120ng/ml (range 29 to 226), increasing to mean levels of 897ng/ml (C1; range 216-2560), 877ng/ml (C2; range 225-2500), 719ng/ml (C2.5; range 209-2500), 460ng/ml (C3; range 154-1495), 311ng/ml (C4; range 104-772), 220ng/ml (C5; range 65-356), 184ng/ml (C6; range 45-304) and 193ng/ml (C12; range 57-430). The mean area-under the curve (AUC) corresponding to these 40 pharmacokinetic profiles was 3843.83ng*ml/h (range 1355-7840). The AUC correlated significantly (p<0.01) to the C1-C6 levels, but not to the CsA trough levels (C0). In addition, no correlation between CsA dosage and AUC was found. Conclusions: The CsA dosage is associated with the frequency of GvHD and the overall outcome in patients after SCT. However, the route of administration and the CsA dosage and CsA monitoring remain controversial issues. Most centres do monitor CsA using trough levels measurements. The pharmacokinetic profiles of intravenous CsA presented in this study strongly indicate that CsA trough levels do not reflect the drug exposure (=AUC) in paediatric SCT patients. In contrast, CsA blood levels after 1 to 6 hours do correlate significantly to the AUC and can be therefore used as a tool for the calculation of the AUC. Prospective studies will reveal the clinical relevance of CsA-AUC measurements with regard to GvHD and relapse after SCT.",

Saccardi, A.M. Vannucchi, A. Bosi AOU Careggi (Florence, I) Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is an important determinant of long-term morbidity and mortality in allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients. cGVHD has clinical, histologic, and laboratory findings of autoimmune diseases in which anti-B-cell therapy has shown efficacy. Therefore we reviewed the clinical outcome of 8 pts treated with monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) for cGVHD. Patients characteristics were: 6M/2F, median age 41 (range 32-50), 3 pts with AML, 2 CLL, 1 CML, 1 MDS and 1 MM; 5 received an HLA identical sibling transplant and 3 an unrelated donor transplant. Stem cell source was marrow in 4/8 pts. All patients presented an extensive cGVHD with lichenoid or sclerodermic skin involvement, oral mucositis and xerophtalmia. Other extracutaneous involvements included liver (3 pts), lung (1pts) and muscles (1 pt) and systemic symptoms as fever (3 pts). In all pts cGVHD was refractory to at least three lines of treatment. 6/8 pts had already received extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP). Treatment with rituximab consisted of weekly intravenous infusions at the dose of 375 mg/m\u00b2, given for 4 weeks. One pt received only two doses of rituximab and was shifted to other therapies for cGVHD progression. A partial and transient response was observed only in three pts, in the term of steroids tapering and improvement of symptoms. In the remainig 5 pts no improvement or progression of cGVHD was observed. In pts who responded, the improvement concerned the sclerodermic skin envolvement, oral mucositis, xerophtalmia and systemic symptoms. No effects of rituximab treatment was observed on liver or lung involvement. In our small experience anti-CD20 therapy for refractory cGVHD resulted not effective in most of the pts. These few data suggest that rituximab may be employed earlier in treatment of cGVHD and particularly in case of skin or mucosal involvement.",

Dickinson University of Newcastle upon Tyne (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) Graft versus Host disease (GvHD) is the major limitation to successful allogeneic transplantation and contributes significantly to transplant related mortality and morbidity. Steroid refractory or steroid depending GvHD is linked to poor survival or life quality. Conventional immunosuppression has shown variable success in these conditions and increases susceptability for infection and relapse. Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) is a promising therapy for acute and chronic GvHD not responding to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. ECP treatment seems to have quite selective effects on the pathogenic process in GvHD as the number of relapses and infections is not increased. The mechanisms of action of ECP in GvHD known so far include lymphocyte apoptosis and cytokine modulation. Some groups have proposed that monocytes are modulated by ECP treatment and that dendritic cells derived from treated monocytes have a more tolerogenic rather than Th1 stimulating character (DC1 \u2265 DC2 balance). However, conflicting data exists on monocyte survival and susceptability for apoptosis after ECP treatment. So far there are no reports on the effects of ECP on circulating dendritic cells although DCs are considered to play a major role in ECP mechanisms. This study investigates the fate of monocytes and monocyte derived DCs using an in vitro model for ECP (in vitro PUVA). In vitro PUVA treated monocytes undergo apoptosis after 24h-48h. Hence, there is no generation of monocyte-derived DCs from treated monocytes in our system. However, the coculture of treated and untreated monocytes in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF leads to immature and (after stimulation with IL1-beta and TNF-alpha) mature DCs with increased expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and subsequently enhanced immunostimulatory capacity on allogeneic naive T cells. In vitro PUVA treated immature and mature DCs undergo apoptosis starting from 4h and 8h respectively and immunostimulatory capacity is strongly abrogated. The cytokine patterns are about to be assessed and will be presented. Our in vitro data suggest that monocytes and DCs are susceptible to ECP induced apoptosis.The removal of APC precursors might diminish GvHD and contribute to ECP mechanisms. Denileukin diftitox (Ontak) is a recombinant fusion protein composed of diphtheria toxin fragments A and B and human interleukin (IL)-2. Ontak preferentially binds to the high-affinity IL-2R expressed on activated T-cells and, after internalization of the receptor-ligand complex, kills T-cells by inhibiting protein synthesis. Recently, Ontak has been used for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in human patients and showed promising activity. We therefore hypothesized that Ontak would be effective in the prevention of acute GVHD. After demonstrating cross-reactivity of Ontak with canine T-cells in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures, we tested our hypothesis in the dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-nonidentical canine transplant model that has been highly predictive for outcomes in human patients. Six dogs were given myeloablative total body irradiation (9.2 Gy) and DLAnonidentical haematopoietic cell grafts, followed by Ontak, 9 \u00b5g/kg/day intravenously (IV) on days 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10, in combination with MTX, 0.4 mg/kg/day IV on days 1, 3, 6 and 11 after transplantation. Median survival of dogs given MTX in combination with Ontak was 16 (range, 13-18) days, which was shorter compared to historic controls (n=35) given MTX alone (median survival, 20 [range, 11->100] days; p= 0.001) ( Table 1 ). The median survival of controls (n=16) given a combination of MTX and cyclosporine (CSP) was 88 (range, 5 ->372) days. Five of 6 (83%) MTX/Ontak-treated dogs had clinical and pathological evidence of three-system GVHD; one dog died of canine herpes virus infection without evidence of GVHD. The median onset of GVHD in MTX/Ontak-treated dogs was on day 13 (range, days 9-14) after transplantation, which was not significantly different compared to controls given MTX alone.",

Marbet, B.C. Biedermann University Hospital Basel (Basel, CH) Endothelial cells (EC) have been recognized as a major target of graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The mechanisms of endothelial-T-cell interactions are poorly understood. Methods: We measured soluble markers of endothelial injury (von Willebrand factor vWF, soluble VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and Eselectin) in 27 recipients of allogeneic HSCT in a retrospective cross-sectional and in 25 HSCT recipients in a prospective study over 24 months. Plasma levels were correlated to clinical outcomes and compared with healthy controls. Results: Patients with cGVHD had higher von Willebrand factor (vWF) and sVCAM-1 levels than healthy controls (p<0.001 for both) and patients without cGVHD (p<0.05 for both). VCAM-1, which is not present in healthy, uninflamed skin, was expressed on cutaneous microvessels of patients with cGVHD. CD4 and CD8 positive T-lymphocytes from patients with cGVHD had a significantly higher expression of the VCAM-1 ligand VLA-4 (alpha4/beta1 integrin) compared to healthy controls, or patients without GVHD. Numbers of circulating CD4 T cells showed an inverse correlation with VLA-4 expression and with plasma sVCAM-1 levels. Conclusion: These data suggest that binding of VLA-4 to VCAM-1 is involved in the T-cell-endothelial interaction and in recruitment of T-cells to the lesion. We hypothesize that endothelial activation and injury in GVHD is mediated, upregulated and potentially perpetuated by VCAM-1/VLA-4 in the context of T-cell-endothelial interactions.",

            "text": "Anti-T-lymphocyte globulin induces programmed cell death by caspase dependent and independent pathways C. Gr\u00fcllich, C. Ziegler, J. Finke University of Freiburg (Freiburg, D) Introduction: Rabbit Anti-T-Lymphocyte Globulin (ATG) is widely used as GvHD prophylacsis in allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Cytotoxic activity of ATG against Tlymphocytes leads to a in vivo T-cell depletion. ATG is generated by immunizing rabbits with Jurkat proteins resulting in a polyclonal antibody. Hence, a wide variety of ATG binding epitopes has been identified. The mechanisms of cytotoxic activity induced by ATG include complement mediated lysis and programmed cell death (PCD). PCD pathways must be induced by antibody mediated activation of membrane receptors. Since the mechanisms of PCD have not been fully elucidated, we investigated PCD in Jurkat cells induced by ATG. By using specific inhibitor for caspase dependent and independent pathways we found both pathways to be active in parallel. Methods and results: The T-lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat was used as target for ATG induced PCD. For caspase inhibition the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD was used. For serine protease inhibition, we used TLCK and TPCK and dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), for inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent cell death we used Nacethylcysteine (NAC). We found that ATG strongly induces PCD in Jurkat cells with overlapping features of apoptosis and secondary necrosis, as assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide positivity. Caspase and serine protease inhibition can partially inhibit PCD by about 20 %. Furthermore, combinations of caspase and serine protease inhibition act in an additive fashion. Inhibition of ROS formation also reduces PCD and enhances the inhibition by either caspase or serine protease inhibitors but is not additive to a combination of both. Discussion: ATG induces programmed cell death by both caspase dependent and independent pathways. The features of PCD are overlapping between apoptotic and necrotic. Caspase dependent and serine protease dependent pathways appear to act in parallel since inhibition of both pathways is additive. Hence, both pathways constitute independent effector mechanisms induced by membrane receptor activation. The formation of ROS appears to be involved in both pathways, since it can enhance the inhibition of PCD by either pathway, but does not constitute an independent pathway. Thus, ATG is a strong inducer of PCD in Jurkat cells, mediated by signal transduction pathways, that utilize caspase dependent and independent effector mechanisms with ROS formation contributing partially to both pathways. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) remains the most problematic complication after reduced-intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation (RIC SCT) and induces prominent morbidity and mortality. We aimed to reveal the frequency and optimal treatment for cGVHD in pts underwent RIC SCT for different malignancies. 24 pts were treated by RIC SCT from 2000 to 2005. 23 of them were transplanted for high risk hematological malignancies (17 for MDS, 6 for AML) and 1 -for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. All pts had comorbidities, such as CMVdisease, or were heavily pretreated, or belonged to an elder age group. The median age was 37 yrs (18-65), there were 12 women/12 men. All of them were treated with Fludaracontaining conditioning regimens, 22 with Busulfan and 15 with ATG also. The source of stem cells were BM for 16 pts (median 4,7x10 8 nucleated cells) or PBSC for 7 pts (median 4,76 x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells). GVHD was prophylacted by CSA only in 10 pts, by CSA+MTX in 14 pts. Median follow-up was 21 months . 15 pts (62,5%) are alive and in CR with 100% donor chimerism. 13 pts (86,6%) developed cGvHD at median time of 7 months post SCT (3-24 months). 6 pts (46%) progressed to cGvHD from acute GvHD being on immunosupression and 7 pts (53%) developed de novo cGvHD after immunosupression cessation (1 -because of increasing mixed chimerism). Limited cGvHD was registered in 1 pt. 12 pts had extensive disease, 3 (25%) demonstrated scleroderma. 6 pts had lichenoid form of disease with Sicca syndrome. Others suffered from lung damage, hepatic disease or intestinal incontiniency. The basic therapy consisted of 2mg/kg Prednisone with slow tapering. To the end of the first month of therapy all pts recieved three immunosupressive drugs. 3 pts with scleroderma were treated with PUVA (2 -successfuly). 1 pt died from CMV disease. 4 patients improved after 11-13 months of treatment, 7 pts had stable disease after 7-10 months of therapy and 1 pt worsened after quick therapy tapering. We conclude that cGVHD develops later on post-transplant period in the most pts after RIC SCT than after conventional BMT. Most of them have extensive disease with high frequency of scleroderma, need long-term combined treatment and improve after 3-5 years post SCT. The age, comorbidities, stem cell source or history of pre-treatment had no impact on cGVHD. It seems reasonable that the late onset of cGVHD in these pts demands more extensive GVHD prophylaxis on late posttransplant period.",

Locasciulli Azienda Ospedaliera S. Camillo-Forlanini (Rome, I) There are few published papers reporting GVHD involving the cardiac muscle. Idiopathic myositis with proximal muscle weakness, myalgia, and increased creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level may be the sole manifestation of chronic GVHD, although more often it is associated with other organs involvement. We report a case of a 56 year-old man who developed cardiac failure and severe myositis two years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for Ph+, BCR-ABL+ (p210) ALL. Following a conditioning with thiotepa 10 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg, the patient underwent an unpurged PBSC transplantation (CD34+ cells = 5.5 x 10 6 /kg; CD3 1.1 x 10 8 /kg) from a matched sibling male donor. His course was complicated by acute GVHD grade II involving skin and gut since day +26 and was successfully treated with 6-metilprednisolone (2mg/kg) and cyclosporin (CSA). The patient then developed extensive chronic GVHD involving skin and eyes and treatment with low-dose steroids and CSA was restarted. Due to further extension of GVHD steroids were scaled up (to 1 mg/kg). Disease evaluation at that time confirmed CR (also at a molecular level) and full-donor chimerism, but suddenly developed severe myopathy with loss of muscle strength, lower limb pain, fever, fatigue and orthopnea. CPK level was 724 U/L (normal values 10-170U/L), ALT 52 U/L (normal values 10-36 U/L ), AST 105 U/L (normal values 10-36 U/L ). LDH and myocardial enzymes were within the normal range. Ecocardiography showed a picture of heart failure with 38% ejection fraction (NYHA II). Skeletal muscle biopsy only showed non-diagnostic inflammatory changes. Barium swallow oesophagogram documented decreased motility. Based on these findings, according to Bohan and Peter criteria, a diagnosis of \"possible\" polymyositis was made. Prompt administration of corticosteroids (1mg/kg) and cyclosporin (6mg/kg) resulted in striking improvement in both cardiac and skeletal muscle functions. The patients is now at more than two years from transplantation but only 3 months from the onset of myopathy. Over the following weeks CPK level normalized as well as ejection fraction (58%), but the patient is steroid-dependant with cardiac function deteriorating upon steroid reduction. Cardiac GVHD involvement is rare and represents a diagnostic challenge. This complication is often fatal and response to immunosuppressive agents unpredictable.",

Halaburda, K. Guz, A. Orzinska, A. Kalinska, B. Nasilowska, A. Szczepinski, B. Marianska, E. Brojer Institute of Haematology (Warsaw, PL) Patients: We evaluated early hematopoietic chimerism in 12 patients allografted for haematological malignancies from HLA-matched sibling donors. 10 patients had myeloablative conditioning. Of those, 7 patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and 3 bone marrow (BM). The remaining 2 patients had a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with PBSC infusion. Methods: Blood samples were collected on days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 after transplantation (Tx). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated on Ficoll density gradient and DNA was isolated according to standard procedure (Qiagen, Germany) with spectrophotometry concentration control. Chimerism evaluation was based on pre-transplant testing of donor/recipient pairs for 24 markers (6 null alleles -SRY, S03, S06, GSTM1, GSTT1, RHD and 9 insertion/deletion polymorphisms -ACE, S01, S04, S05, S07, S08, S09, S10, S11) using real-time PCR TaqMan technology on ABI PRISM 7700. 50 ng of DNA was used in each PCR at all time points after Tx. Real-time PCR was performed with probes and primers specific for recipient and donor alleles as well as control CCR5 gene. Relative quantification of target genes vs. control was used for assessment of chimerism. Pretransplant DNA concentration in recipient and donor were used as calibrators for posttransplant PCR reactions. Results: All patients engrafted with varying tempo and at day 30 showed 91.7% to 100% donor chimerism in mononuclear cells of peripheral blood. Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) was seen in 5 patients. Median recipient chimerism in those patients at day 15 was 2.6% (range 2.0-6.0), while in 7 patients without aGvHD it was 11.6% (range 5.5-36.77). Of 7 patients who received PBSC after myeloablative conditioning 4 developed aGvHD. In all of them increase of donor chimerism between day 5 and 10 was more than 36%, while in patients without aGvHD it did not exceed 18%. Patients who received BM or were conditioned with RIC had substantially lower donor chimerism on day 5 in comparison to those with PBSC transplantation after conventional conditioning (median 4.0% vs 41.8% with ranges of 0.9-10.5 and 27.4-72.2 respectively). Conclusions: 1/ Real-time PCR permits to reliably follow early chimerism after allogeneic transplantation 2/ Kinetics of engraftment varies depending on types of conditioning and source of stem cells 3/ Preliminary results suggest potential value of this method to predict aGvHD after transplantation Several predictive factors for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) have been reported. Notably, the donor-recipient sex mismatch, that might underlie a role for chromosome Y minor hystocompatibility antigens, has been reported as a risk factor. However, the results appear contradictory in different studies and might have been influenced by a number of confounding factors related to different ethnic origin, underlying disorders, age at bone marrow transplantation (BMT), different conditioning regimens in patients with or without acute GVHD. The impact of donor-recipient sex mismatch in a series of 204 patients transplanted from siblings with HLA identical bone marrow from the homogenous founder population of Sardinia, in which the vast majority of paediatric patients (92%) performed BMT to cure beta-maior thalassemia, was evalutated. Seventy-eight had acute GVHD. Consistent with some previous reports it was found that in this homogenous group of patients the donor-female/recipientmale pair provided an increased risk for acute GVHD when compared with a reference donor-male/recipient-male pair (POR= 2.3, P=0,04). Twenty-eight male patients, with acute GVHD that had received BMT from HLA identical sisters, were assessed with a case-control experimental design, for a role of variation at the male specific portion of chromosome Y(MSY) in acute GVHD. No significant association between MSY haplogroups and acute GVHD in male patients that had received bone marrow from HLA identical donor sisters was observed. This data is not consistent with the presence of Y chromosome founder variants contributing significantly to acute GVHD in the Sardinian population.",

Klink, S. Scholl, V. Schmidt, K. Schilling, K. H\u00f6ffken Friedrich-Schiller-University Hospital (Jena, D) Inhibitors of inosine monophoshate dehydrogenase are effective immunosuppressants by inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and has been successfully used in solid organ transplantation. They act at a late stage of lymphocyte proliferation, beyond the steps where either corticosteriods or cyclosporine (CSA) have inhibitory activity. In this ongoing single-centre open phase II trial, we evaluated enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) [Myfortic \u00ae] 720 mg twice a day orally in the prophylaxis of GvHD starting EC-MPS at day 10 after transplantation. In addition GvHD prophylaxis consisted of standard CSA 3mg/kg/bodyweight (bw) continuous infusion w/wo methotrexate. So far 24 patients with advanced haematological malignancies and either HLAmismatched family donors, matched or mismatched unrelated donors are enrolled (8/03 -10/05). The median age of the 7 women and 17 men was 46 years (range: 26-61). 66% (n=16) received 40 mg/kg/bw antithymocyte globulin, either with 8 Gray total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (CY) 120mg/kg/bw, or with fludarabine 120mg/m\u00b2 and busulfan 8mg/kg/bw . 33% (n=8) received 12 Gray TBI and CY. Patients received G-CSF primed allogeneic blood stem cells grafts with a mean of 5.63 x 10 6 CD-34 positive cells per kg/bw (range 2.7-9.27). One patient received bone marrow with 1.9 x 10 6 CD-34 positive cells. Beside one HLA mismatched family donor (4.2%) and 17 (70.8%) HLA-A, -B and -DR matched unrelated donors (UD), 6 patients (25%) received grafts from HLA 1-antigen mismatched UD. All, except for one patient, showed a leucocyte engraftment on day + 15 (range 11-20) and platelet engraftment on day + 21 (range 13-30). Out of the 23 evaluable patients, 13 (56.5%) presented acute GvHD \u2265 grade II, including 3 patients (13.0%) with grade III and one (4.3%) with grade IV. EC-MPS had to be changed temporary to intravenous mycophenolate mofetil substitution in nearly one third of all study patients. At present 5 (20.8%) patients have died (3 due to relapses, 2 due to GvHD). The degree of acute GvHD grade II seems to be limited to skin-GvHD. In the patient group with 12 Gray TBI severe mycositis avert oral intake of the tablets at day +10. Follow up observation and chronic GvHD has to be further evaluated. EC-MPS combined with standard GvHD prophylaxis is feasible and effective in reducing severe GvHD. This is the first report of a combined acute GvHD prophylaxis protocol with orally taken EC-MPS.",

Ilhan Ankara University Medical School (Ankara, TR) Dermatological complications in chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) are well known and affecting many allogeneic transplant recipients. One of the major dermatologic complications of chronic GVHD is sclerodermoid changes. Our purpose was to analyze the clinical features of sclerodermoid chronic GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) from 1986 through 2005. We assessed age, sex, pre-transplat diagnosis, conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, preceding acute GVHD, clinical properties of sclerodermoid GVHD. Sclerotic skin changes developed in 15 patients. Thirteen patients were male and 9 were female with a median age of 32.7(20-45). Underlying malignancies were 10AML, 7CML,1ALL, 1MDS and 1MM. Conditioning regimens were in 18 with a GVHD prophylaxis of 14 CSAMTX (short term)and 4 CSAMMF. Results: Acute GVHD appeared in 17 patients (2hepatic, 2gastrointestinal tract and 13skin involvement). Extensive chronic GVHD developed in 14 patients. Sclerotic lesions developed after a mean of 681 days. Sclerosis was generalized in 19 patients (86.4%) and localized in 3 patients (13.6%). Leopard skin eruption appeared in 8 (36,4%) of the 19 patients with generalized sclerodermoid changes. In most of the cases sclerotic lesions appeared in the trunk and distal parts of the extremities spared. Joint retractions and dysfagia developed in 2(9%) of the 22 cases. Eleven patients presented with oral mucosal involvement.",

Szczylik CSK MON WIM (Warsaw, PL) Objectives: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in long-term survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Ocular involvement occurs in approximately 60% of patients with chronic GVHD with clinical manifestations: dryness, photophobia and burning. The Schirmer`s test should be routinely performed in all patients early in the onset of chronic GVHD. The treatment is composed of topical lubricants and systemic therapy as these patients have a poor long-term prognosis. In more severe cases pathological ocular lesions are refractory to therapy. Methods: We describe five patients with: 2-acute myeloid leukemia, 3-chronic myeloid leukemia who developed extensive chronic graft versus host disease with eye involvement after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All had liver disease, lichenoid skin changes and mucositis. Two of them had bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS). They were treated with cyclosporin and prednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulins (for BOS). No improvement was observed. Mycophenolate mofetil with tacrolimus was used as a second line therapy. Topical therapy consisted of: preservative-free tears during the day, preservative-free ointment at night and topical corticosteroids. After two to four months of second line therapy more pathological symptoms in involved organs resolved (including bronchiolitis obliterans) but patients still suffered from ocular manifestations of chronic GVHD. Treatment with cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% was started (Restasis-Allergan U.S.A.). Two drops of Restasis were instilled twice a day in each eye approximately 12 hours apart. Results: Only mild side effects were observed including: eye pain, foreign body sensation and transient visual disturbances (blurring). All patients responsed to this therapy, but clinical ocular improvement was seen from the fifth month of starting treatment. The Schirmer`s test showed increasing of tears production. Systemic therapy was successfully slowly tapered. We tried to reduce dose of topical cyclosporine, unfortunately it was leading to exacerbation of eye manifestation of chronic graft versus disease. Conclusion: Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion is indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. It can be used to improve eye disease in chronic graft versus host disease as we observed in our patients. Objective: Cytokines and their receptors are known to play a crucial role in inflammatory diseases. Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) remains a major cause of early deaths after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Using HLAidentical sibling grafts, the incidence of severe aGVHD (grade III-IV) has been reduced down to 10-15%. IL-18, a novel immunoregulatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of aGVHD but neopterin is useful and innovative tool to early identification of complication in allograft recipients. Patients and methods: Serum levels of IL-18, IL-8, IL-6, TNFalpha and neopterin were frequently measured during high dose chemotherapy/radiotherapy the first 30 days after allogeneic SCT in 15 patients (mean age 31,3\u00b13,0 years) with S97 hematological malignancies (AML, ALL, CML) and SAA. Different conditioning regimens were used: BuCy2, Cy+TBI, Cy200. Serum of 30 healthy people were used as control. Levels of cytokines and neopterin were measured by ELISA method. Results: Major transplant-related complications (MTCs) occurred in 33% of cases included veno-occlusive liver disease, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, CMV infection, endothelial leakage syndrome and grade III/IV aGVHD. Compared with minor complications those with MTCs developed higher levels of IL-18 (1196 vs. 315,8 pg/ml); IL-8 (56,8 vs.20,7 pg/ml); IL-6 (315,0 vs. 5,47 pg/ml) and neopterin (46,5 vs. 12,3 nmol/l p<0,01). Mutual interrelations confirm correlation between increased concentration of neopterin and IL-6 (r=0,27) and between neopterin and TNF-a (r=0,71; p \u2264 0,05). Conclusions: IL-18 and neopterin were shown to be sensitive and specific parameters for GVHD after bone marrow transplantation and IL-18 shown to be good predictor of incidence and severity of aGvHD after SCT.",

Barulli, L. Malerba, M. Lucesole, A. Isidori San Salvatore Hospital (Pesaro, I) Corticosteroid-resistant GVHD following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents the main cause of transplant-related mortality, showing poor response to conventional immunosuppressive agents. The purine analogue pentostatin has promising activity in GVHD, decreasing lymphocyte number and function. We investigated pentostatin for refractory GVHD in 7 patients (4 males and 3 females) who failed to respond to cyclosporine A and high dose steroids (2-5 mg/kg/day). Median age of this cohort was 13 years (range 8-28). Diagnoses included hematological malignancies (2 acute leukemia: 1 T-ALL, 1 AML, 1 Hodgkin's lymphoma) and nonmalignant diseases (4 beta thalassemia major). Five pts had HLA-matched unrelated donors (4 BM, 1 PBSC) and 2 had HLA identical sibling donors (1 BM, 1 PBSC). Two thalassemic patients received respectively 1 and 2 previous transplants. Severe acute GVHD (grade III-IV with multiple organ involvement)occurred in 5 pts. One patient had severe chronic GVHD and another both acute and chronic GVHD. Patients with refractory acute GVHD received pentostatin 1,5 mg/m2 x 3 (4 pts) or 4 consecutive days (2 pts). One patient received a second course of pentostatin at 1 mg/m2 x 3 days. Out of 6 pts with acute GVHD, 2 (33%)were responders and 4 (67%) died for GVHD (3 cases) or GVHD and disease recurrence (1 case). Results are very poor in liver disease and best in skin and gut. Patients with refractory chronic GVHD, both thalassemic, (one of them was previously treated successfully with pentostatin for acute refractory GVHD) are treated with pentostatin 4 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. every 2 weeks for 3 or 4 months. They had improvement in skin and mouth symptoms and tapered concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Pentostatin was well tolerated without severe neutropenia or impairing engraftment. Our results suggest that pentostatin might be considered in all patients with severe acute GVHD not responding to the primary treatment with high dose steroids. Moreover pentostatin appears to be an encouraging and well tolerated salvage therapy particularly for the treatment of refractory chronic GVHD in young thalassemic patients. The efficacy of this approach need to be confirmed in a larger series of transplanted patients.",

Gramatzki UK-SH (Kiel, D) Severe acute graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a major cause of treatment related mortality. Steroid administration is still the first choice of therapy of established acute GvHD with a response rate of 30%-70%. To date, there is no standard for salvage treatment of steroid resistant acute GvHD. Various agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), pentostatin, thalidomide, antithymocyte globulin as well as monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD25, TNF-alpha or IL-1 and extracorporal photophoresis have been tried with variable results. Alemtuzumab (MabCampath\u00ae) is a humanized antibody targeting CD52, which is expressed on T-and Blymphocytes and on some monocyte derived dendritic cells. It has been successfully used in conditioning regimes for GvHD prevention. In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of Alemtuzumab treatment for severe acute GvHD, five patients (19 -68 y.) with steroid resistant acute GvHD after an allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a sibling (n=2), matched unrelated donor (n=1) and one antigen missmatch donor (n=2) were treated. The initial three patients with grade IV liver GvHD received 70-80 mg of alemtuzumab after failure of steroids up to 2000 mg/day, cyclosporine, and MMF. In patient #1, bilirubin levels normalized from a maximum of 48 mg/dl within 6 weeks, with an additional administration of 40 mg alemtuzumab after four weeks. The patient died four months after start of alemtuzumab from adenoviral sepsis. Patient #2 showed a significant although temporary response (bilirubin 29.4 to 15.2 mg/dl) with 3 additional applications of 40 mg alemtuzumab every 2 weeks. Patient #3 died from progressive GvHD and sepsis two weeks after start of alemtuzumab. In order to reduce infectious complications due to pronounced lymphocyte depletion, two additional patients were treated with lower doses of 30 mg alemtuzumab repeated every two to three weeks, concomitant with cyclosporine. Patient #4 suffering from acute GvHD of liver (III\u00b0) and gut (IV\u00b0) resolved completely after 4 cycles of alemtuzumab and the response is ongoing (>2 month). Patient #5 patient with acute grade IV liver and gut GvHD is still receiving treatment and has already ceased diarrhea. In summary, Alemtuzumab shows promising activity in steroid refractory acute GvHD and may be used in comparably low dose to avoide infectious complications. A. Larocca, A. Brizio, P. E. Pioltelli, E.

We analysed the blood sampled at the day of transplant from 10 patients (pts) (4 AML, 2 MDS, 2 CML, 2 IMF), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) since October 2004 to September 2005, together with a sample of the cells infused, performing a cytofluorimetric assay with anti CD3, anti CD14, anti CD25, anti CD56 and anti CD62L. Patients, 7 female and 3 male, (median age 47), received bone marrow (BM) (7 pts) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) (3 pts) from HLA identical sibling donors (9 pts) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) (1 pt), after myeloablative or low intensity conditioning regimens. After a median of 14 days (range 7-100), 7 pts experienced acute GvHD grade I with only skin involvement and 3 pts were treated with low dose prednisone. Hepatic acute GvHD grade III was diagnosed on a biopsy specimen in 1 pt after 80 days from MUD transplant. Limited chronic GvHD was diagnosed in 4/9 pts and extensive GvHD with hepatic involvement in 1 pt. After a median follow-up of 170 days (range 44-325), 8 pts are still alive in complete remission, 1 pt with CML experienced a molecular relapse and 1 pt died in relapse. Analysis of patients blood samples did not show any correlation with the frequency of GvHD. Data obtained from CD14 analysis performed on the graft of 9 pts, did not show a significant predisposition towards GvHD; only 1 pt, who received a large amount of CD14+ cells (150,5 x 106/Kg), didn't experience acute GvHD. In the same way CD62L and CD56 did not correlate with the frequency of GvHD. A significant correlation between GvHD and high dose CD3+ (365x106/Kg) and CD3+CD25+ cells (169,8x106/Kg) was found in 1 pt, whereas 5 pts experienced acute GvHD in spite of the low amount of CD3+ and CD3+CD25+ cells infused.",

Cervello (Palermo, I) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of the NOD2/CARD15 gene mutations resulting in a diminished response to bacterial cell products are involved in Crohn's disease, but recently they have been associated with increased risk for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and complications following stem cell transplantation. The end point of our study was to analyze the major outcome variables (TRM and aGvHD) after transplant with respect to the presence of NOD2/CARD15 R702W, G908R, L100finsC single mutations. We collected and retrospectively analyzed DNA from 29 patients (P) and their respective donors (D). Al genomic DNAs were obtained from peripheral blood by phenol-chlorophorm extraction. The three main NOD2/CARD15 gene variations, were investigated by direct genomic sequencing of exons 4, 8 and 11(CEQ 8000System, Beckman), and by allele specific reverse dot-blot hybridization (RDB). All patients were affected by hemato-oncologic diseases (AML 19, ALL 4, NHL 3, MM 1, CML 2) and received graft from HLA-identical donors (20 siblings, 9 unrelated) . In all cases PBSC were the source of stem cells. As conditioning 8 patients received fludarabine-based non myeloablative regimens while 21 received myeloablative conditioning with BU-CY2 or TBI-CY. Cylosporine A and a short course of methotrexate were given as GvHD prophylaxis. ATG at the dose of 7.5 mg/kg was added in patients receiving an unrelated transplant. NOD2/CARD15 mutations were found in 5 (17.8 %) recipients and in 4 (13.7 %) donors. We found NOD2 mutations in both D and R in 3 pairs, while in 3 pairs the mutation was present only in the donor. The distribution of mutated and unmutated NOD2/CARD15 gene both in patients and donor was similar to healthy open Sicilian population, while the incidence of the same mutations was significantly higher in Sicilian patients with Crohn disease (previous published data). Up to now with a median follow-up of 14 mo (2.4 -40) 19 pts are alive while 11 died (10 due to relapse or disease progression, one due to gr IV aGVHD). aGVHD gr.1-2 was observed in 7 patients (26 %) and aGVHD gr 3-4 only in one patient. None of the pts with mutated alleles showed TRM or severe aGVHD. For the time being we didn't observe any correlation between aGvHD or TRM and presence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations in this series of patients. However the number of observations is too low to draw any definitive conclusion and the study is still ongoing.",

Purroy Vall d\u00b4Hebron (Barcelona, E) Inttrodustion: Graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurs when immunologically competent cells are introduced into an immunoincompetent host. GVHD refers to both the immunologic insult and the consequences to the organism. The leading cause of GVHD is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), other causes like solid organ transplants, blood transfusions, and maternal-fetal transfusions also reportedly cause GVHD. Case: We present a 33 years old man, who was diagnosed in October 1997 of acute myeloid leukaemia, treated with idarrubicin, etoposid and citarabine (IDICE), with complete remission; after that he received intensification treatment with mitoxanthrone and citarabine, and consolidation with an allogeneic HSCT from a sibling donor. The chimerism was 100% of the donor since first month. There wasn't any important complications after HSCT; except a GVHD skin , resolved with corticoids. Seven years after HCST, in November 2004, a rutinary control detected donor's chimerism 34% with a medullar relapse, leukemia characteristics were the same than the initials, a new treatment with IDICE was administrated, showing no response, therefore, a second cycle was administrated. One week after the first treatment fever appeared, which persisted besides large spectre antibiotics, so empiric antifungal treatment was added.Two months after the relapse the patient remained febrile, and skin lesions appeared in head, arm, legs, abdomen and oral mucosa, a biopsy was performed and diagnosticated fusarium s.p. The neutropenia persisted, and the overall status was worsening, so we decided donor granulocyte infusions from two HLA identical sisters; ten days later, neutropenia disappeared, the bone marrow hadn't blastic cells, and chimerism was 100% donor. A month later, new skin lesions appeared, the biopsy confirmed GVHD and severe liver affectation was also demonstrated by biopsy. It was treated with corticoids and ciclosporine, with rapid resolution. The patient left hospital, and until now chimerism remains 100% donor with complete remission, without treatment nor GVH. Conclusion: Graft versus Host disease is usually presented after hematopoietic stem cells infusion but other causes are been reported as lymphocytes infusion, where is not a rare event and in other cases as granulocytes infusion as in our patient. GVHD after granulocyte infusion is not a common complication even though it has to be taken in mind in patients that show skin or liver afectation after infusion.",

Voltarelli, B.P. Simoes Medical School Ribeirao Preto (Ribeirao Preto, BR) Treatment of GVHD has relied on high-dose steroids. Patients who do not respond to steroids have a poor outcome and no standard treatment at this moment exists for these patients. Use of high-dose intra-arterial steroid infusion (IASI) has been S99 described with encouraging results (MP 3 mg/kg intra-arterial and Mtx 10 mg/m\u00b2). We report 4 cases of patients with steroid refractory GVHD treated with IASI. All patients were submitted to allogeneic mieloablative transplants from there HLA identical siblings (2 AML, 1 Plasma cell Leukemia and 1 MDS). GVHD prophylaxis was undertaken with CsA and Mtx. In all cases GVHD was confirmed by biopsy. Patient 1 (24 years) started on day +250 with liver cGVHD. CsA was started but with deterioration on liver enzimes and bilirrubin levels, IASI was given on day +272. On day+308 patient recovered some of his weight and controlled hepatic GVHD. Patient 2 (32 years)started on day+63 skin (grade II) and liver (grade II) aGVHD controlled with CsA. He progressed to hepatic cGVHD on day +203. Without improvement with CsA, IASI was made on day+803. CsA was interrupted on day +850. He relapsed and died of extramedullary diseases after complete remission after 2 DLIs without further developing GVHD. Patient 3 (23 years, MDS)on day+51 intestinal GVHD (grade III). He was treated with metilprednisolone (MP) 2mg/kg, MP pulses and Basiliximab with partial control. On day+122 diarrhoea started again. In use of MP 2mg/kg and without improvement IASI was made on day +173 with good response after 10 days (from 1800 ml/day to 260 ml/day). After a second infusion patient controlled GVHD but developed intestinal occlusion. After colonostomy patient was maintained for several months with parenteral nutrition. He is today at home, has recovered his weight and needs no special nutritions. Patient 4 (43 years)on day +26 developed gut GVHD (grade III) initially controlled only with MP 2 mg/kg. On day 72 diahrroe increased until 3500 ml/day. On day +78 he received IASI and controlled the disease on day + 87. Patient relapsed extra-medullary and received DLI on day +120 without further GVHD. These cases illustrate that for hepatic and intestinal GVHD IASI can be a interesting steroid sparing option reducing long-term imunosupression and infectious complications. Although most of previous published data claimed for the early use of IASI, we could treat a very advanced and severe case of intestinal GVHD successfully. Background: There are not publications about the presence of soluble HLA-antigens (s-HLA) in the patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). There is opinion that after allogeneic BMT the presence of s-HLA associated with GvHD. Method: We studied the presence of s-HLA in serum of the patients undergoing autological BMT as a group of comparison. The time of research: Before BMT and 1 time a week after BMT. For S-HLA determination the method of ingibition of anti -HLA antibody in test-serum by recipient's serum was used. The evidence of the appearance of s-HLA in the patients was the decrease of anti -HLA antibody level in test-serum. We studied serum of 6 patients: M/F 5/1, in age 20-57 years ( in median 35) with AL in CR (4), MM G\u00eb (1), T-cells malignant lymphoma (1) in PR. Conditioning: BU+Cy (AL), melphalan 200mg/m\u00b2 (MM) and BEAM (lymphoma). There are not complications after BMT in the patients with AL; in patient with MM increase of G\u00eb paraprotein secretion to 4, 9% was observed. A patient with malignant lymphoma had severe complications: gram+ sepsis and necrotic enteropatia. S-HLA in the patients with AL was absent. There were s-HLA in the patients with MM and lymphoma that might be connected with complications in posttransplantations period (monoclonal secretion in one, sepsis, enteropatia in other) and the phase of disease (absent of CR) in the last patients. In conclusion: We suggested that appearent of s-HLA is not specific for recipients of autotransplantation without complications. Influence of complications for appearance of s-HLA in BMT recipients need in further investigations.",

Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, E. Karakulska-Prystupiuk, M.A. Krol, M. Feliksbrot, B. Blajer, R. Gorska Medical University of Warsaw (Warsaw, PL) Background: In graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) donor alloreactive T cells are believed to infiltrate host tissues, act cytotoxically and thus cause clinical signs of disease. Objectives: The aim of the study was to quantitatively evaluate T-cell subsets, NK cells and B-cells in the peripheral blood and in situ in patients with acute and chronic GVHD. Material and methods: 25 patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were included in the study. In all the patients a thorough dental examination, consisting of medical history and clinical examination, was performed on days 0, +30, +90, +180 and +360 after SCT. In patients with GVHD an additional examination was performed while pathological changes were present. Peripheral blood collection in all patients took place on the same day as physical examination. A lymphocyte phenotypes analysis was carried out by means of flow cytometry, using monoclonal antibodies CD3 FITC/CD4 RPE (DAKO), CD3 FITC/CD8 RPE (DAKO), CD19 RPE (DAKO), CD3 FITC/CD16+56 PE (BDIS), CD45RO FITC/CD4 RPE, CD45RO FITC/CD8 RPE, CD4 FITC/CD45RA RPE and CD8 FITC/CD45RA RPE (DAKO). In 5 patients suffering from chronic GVHD in situ assessment of lymphocyte subsets in oral mucosa was performed. Results and conclusions: A significant increase in the amount of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, memory (CD4+CD45R0+, CD8+CD45R0+) and naive (CD8+CD45RA+) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of patients with acute GVHD. A positive correlation was found between these cells and the occurrence of acute GVHD. Moreover CD4+:CD8+ ratio was reversed. No correlation was observed between acute GVHD occurrence and neither NK cells nor B-cells level. NK cells level was statistically significantly decreased in patients with cGVHD. Obtained results confirmed other reports concerning role of T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+), naive and memory cells, and NK cells in GVHD etiopathogenesis. On the basis of performed survey it may be concluded that also NK cells may play an important role in the chronic GVHD etiopathogenesis. Objective: The inflammatory response induced during stem cell transplantation (SCT) may be critically involved in the pathogenesis of complications and treatment related mortality (TRM). Inflammation may be monitored by the levels of soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR I and -II) released from cell surfaces in response to proinflammatory signals. In the present study we investigated plasma levels of sTNFRI at day -7, before start of conditioning. Patients and methods: 66 patients (11 under 20 years) were included in the study. Underlying diseases included 23 ALL, 18 CML, 14 AML and 8 MDS. Fifty-seven patients had matched unrelated donors (MUD); 9 were transplanted with HLA-identical sibling donors. Fifty patients were conditioned with TBI/CY, 10 with BU/CY, 9 with TBI/VP-16,1 with BU/Cy/VP-16 and 1 with BU/VP-16. Forty-one patients were treated with ATG as part of the conditioning. sTNFRI levels were measured by ELISA(R&D). Results: Total mortality during the first year after transplant (n=24) was associated with increased levels of sTNFRI (1713 pg/ml (801-4969) vs. 1274 pg/ml (783-6209); p=0,002). This pattern was also seen in a separate analysis of TRM (1873 pg/ml (1227-4516) (n=16) versus 1301 pg/ml (783-6209); p=0,0003). In line with this finding, sTNFRI levels were slightly higher in patients who developed severe aGvHD grade 3-4 (n=12) (1672 pg/ml (801-4516) compared with those with no or moderate aGvHD (1316 pg/ml (783-6209), p=0,035). sTNFRI levels were not associated with the occurrence of cGvHD. These findings are in line with the notion that the pretransplant inflammatory status has a major impact on the outcome in SCT. Measuring of sTNFRI levels in plasma may prove clinically important in the pre-transplant assessment of candidates considered for SCT. B cells are able to induce tolerance of antigen specific CD8+ T cells, induce T cell anergy via TGF-beta production, down regulate IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DC) and influence Th1/Th2 differentiation. Through these mechanisms, B cells can exert a regulatory function in in vivo models of T cell immunity including, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, B cells have been shown to be essential in the prevention of effector T cell differentiation in a model of autoimmunity. We have previously shown that resting B cells inhibited tumor protection induced by dendritic cells vaccination. Inhibition of DC immunity by B cells was independent of presentation of major histocompatibility molecule (MHC) class-I bound tumor antigen but dependent on the expression of class-II MHC. The inhibitory effect of B cells was lost if B cells were first activated by CD40L. CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) were not induced in vivo by B cells, however if Treg were depleted, the suppressive effect of B cells was diminished. We have now also examined the role of resting B cells on the induction and severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD) induced in a major MHC mismatch model. We have found that mice transplanted with B cell depleted marrow revealed more rapid CD8+ T cell engraftment, higher IL-2 and IFN-alpha production and more severe GVHD. Conversely, those mice which were treated with 1 million additional resting B cells at the time of marrow infusion were substantially protected from GVHD but without induction of a Treg population. These findings indicate that resting B cells regulate T cell activation directly, possibly via a role in T cell homeostasis. Resting B cells may therefore dierctly limit the outcome of DC/T cell inteactions and be used therapeutically to limit CD8+ T cell mediated pathology including autoimmunity and GVHD.",

Krawczyk-Kulis, M. Markiewicz, I. Wylezol, T. Kruzel, B. Stella-Holowiecka, K. Nowak, M. Kopera, T. Czerw, J. Holowiecki Silesian Medical University (Katowice, PL) Chronic GVHD deteriorates quality of life and is an improtant cause of non-relapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic HSCT. On the other hand it may be accompanied by graft-vs.leukemia (GVL) effect. The goal of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors for this complication as well as its impact on long-term outcome in various hematological malignancies. We analyzed outcome of 255 patients (age: 29(10-56) years) treated in a single institution with alloHSCT from either HLAidentical sibling (n=177) or an unrelated volunteer (n=78), surviving at least 100 days after transplantation. Following factors were analyzed for their impact on the probability of cGVHD: patient and donor sex, age, CMV status, diagnosis, interval diagnosis-alloHSCT, donor type, source of stem cells, cell dose (MNC, CD34+, CD3+), conditioning regimen, type of GVHD prophylaxis. For the whole group the cumulative overall incidence of cGVHD was 48% (CI 42-54%) and extensive cGVHD -22% (CI 18-28%). In Cox model following factors were associated with increased risk of cGVHD: unrelated donor (HR 2.24, p=0,001), diagnosis of CML or MDS (HR 1.98, p=0.003), recipient age >40 years (HR 1.83, p=0, 03) , and CD3+ cell dose >50 x10 6 /kg (HR 1.62, p=0.03). Risk factors for extensive cGVHD were: diagnosis of CML or MDS (HR 3.06, p=0.002), unrelated donor (HR 2.77, p=0.005), steroids used for acute GVHD prophylaxis (HR 2.67, p=0.01), CD3+ cell dose >100 x10 6 /kg (HR 2.61, p=0.01). In multivariate analysis of the whole group the incidence of cGVHD was associated with decreased probability of OS (HR 2.87, p<0.0001) and DFS (HR 1.62, p=0.04), which resulted mainly from increased risk of NRM (HR 25.56, p<0.0001). On the other hand, cGVHD resulted in decreased risk of relapse (HR 7.09, p=0.0002), which was most prominent in case of ALL (HR 32.26, p=0.001) . In this disease, in contrast to AML and CML, the incidence of cGVHD resulted in improved DFS (HR 3.56, p=0.01). Conclusions: The incidence of cGVHD strongly depends on CD3+ cell dose. Steroids administered for acute GVHD prophylaxis paradoxically increase the risk of extensive cGVHD. The incidence of cGVHD increases NRM after alloHSCT, which translates into decreased survival but, in case of ALL this effect may be overcome by reduced risk of relapse suggesting strong GVL effect. These facts should be taken into account when choosing source of stem cells and immunosuppressive traetment regimen, which both should be adjusted to the expected risk of relapse.",

Del Principe (2), S. Ceccarelli (1), G. Isacchi (1) (2) (1)Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9 (Rome, I); (2)Tor Vergata University (Rome, I) Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a severe complication of allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).The improvement of ECP in low weight patients was related to the overcoming of some difficulties such as venous accesses, metabolic and haematological tolerance, minimization of the extracorporeal volume and shortening of the time of collection which are important in the pediatric context. The techniques hitherto currently used for photoactivation had a two step system with the leukoconcentrate transfer into a UVA permeable bag, the dilution until a final volume of 200/300 ml and subsequently the static irradiation. We have studied 11 patients (3 female,8 male) all subordinates to transplant,8 of bone marrow,2 of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC),1 of cord blood. All patients with GvHD were resistant to conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The medium weight of the small patients was 18,5 Kg (range .Nine children had a bilumen central venous catheter, two requires combined central-peripheral access. All patients were submitted to leukapheresis with Cobe Spectra and to photoactivation with PUVA Combi Light or with the new UVA PIT System. This new system is composed by an UVA irradiator with a peristaltic pump and a sterile closed circuit connected both with saline solution and collection bag. It allows the diluition of the concentrate until a final expected pediatric volume of 150/180 ml related to body weight of the patiens and through the continuos flow pump the exposition of the mononuclear cells to the UVA radiation. Cells collected treated with 8-Methoxsalen (Uvadex)were irradiated with UV-A 2 Joule/cm\u00b2 and then reinfused to the patients into 30 minutes.The average duration of the procedure was 115/130 minutes. Our standard protocol previews 2 consecutive ECP weekly during the first month, 2 ECP every two weeks in the second and third month and 2 procedures monthly for another 6 months. The eleven patients in this study received a total of 183 procedures with only minor side effects: hypotension, cardiovascular or gastrointestinal symptoms were not observed. No signs of citrate toxicity were noted. Only three procedures were interrupted due to vascular accesses. Our data suggest that compared to the standard operating procedure this new system ensures a greater safety and sterility, guarantees a final volume adjusted to the pediatric patients and makes a dynamic photoactivation of collected leukoconcentrate. Whereas the GVL effect of allogeneic HSCT has been clearly documented, few data are available on the possible immunological effect played by autologous anti-leukemia T cells in the anti-tumor immune surveillance. We tested the capacity of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to develop T-cell response towards autologous leukemia blasts (LB). To address this issue we tested whether: i) anti-leukemia T cells can emerge in peripheral blood (PB) of AML patients who, based on their morphology and cytogenetics subtypes, have received chemotherapy alone or also underwent autologous BMT (A-BMT). In case of patients receiving A-BMT we studied whether i) anti-leukemia T cells are present in the BM of patients at the time of harvesting; and ii) BM resident anti-leukemia T cells can be transferred with the graft and can be detected in the patients early after A-BMT. To this aim, anti-leukemia CTLp frequency was evaluated in PB of 6 patients treated with chemotherapy alone at various time points after the diagnosis and in PB and BM of 11 patients, undergoing A-BMT, at the time of BM harvesting and at various time points after transplantation. At present, 9 patients are in remission, while 8 patients relapsed. Anti-leukemia CTLp were found in most patients who maintain stable remission after chemotherapy alone or after A-BMT (8 out of 9 pts in remission), while undetectable frequency of anti-leukemia CTLp was usually associated with leukemia relapse (8 out of 8 relapsed patients). In patients receiving A-BMT, the heteroduplex analysis of TCR-Vb repertoire demonstrated that at least some selected antileukemia T-cell clonotypes present in BM before transplantation can be found in the recipient after A-BMT and may contribute to the early anti-leukemia immune response. The correlation between the emergence of antileukemia T cell response and the maintenance of patients in a state of remission, argue for an active anti-leukemia effect of autologous T cells naturally elicited in vivo by the encounter with LB-associated antigens. Moreover, the finding of a strict correlation existing between undetectable anti-leukemia T cell response and the inability to maintain a stable remission for childhood AML suggests that the quantification of the frequency of anti-leukemia CTLp may be a useful tool to identify patients with high risk of relapse after either chemotherapy alone or in combination with A-BMT. The concept that in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) the immune system plays a prominent role in the control of leukemic disease is supported by the clinical observation that immunological effector mechanisms contribute to the elimination of leukemic blasts called graft versus leukemia effect (GvL). For induction of an effective cytotoxic T cell response both efficient antigen presenting capacity as well as target cell susceptibility are required. The CD40-ligand/receptor pair displays a central role in B cell/T cell interactions while upregulating both costimulatory molecules and the CD95 death receptor in non malignant B cells. Primary precursor B-ALL-blasts (BCP-ALL) lack CD95-expression (2.6+1.1% positive cells) and are therefore resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Upon CD40stimulation CD95-expression is upregulated in BCP-ALL to levels equivalent to normal B cells (65.4+4.3% vs 59.3+13.1%). Inspite of this, specific apoptosis is markedly lower in BCP-ALL compared to normal B cells (19.1+3% vs 36.7+5.5%) and caspase-8 and -3 are not activated in CD40stimulated BCP-ALL upon CD95-ligation. The short isoform of FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIPs) is known to counteract CD95-mediated apoptosis. Contrary to constitutive expression of FADD and procaspase-8 in both malignant and non malignant B-cells, FLIPs is strongly up-regulated after 72h CD40-ligation in BCP-ALL. Prolonged and enhanced induction of the FLIPs-expression may thus inhibit the onset of apoptosis in otherwise CD95-sensitized BCP-ALL. As an additional antiapoptotic mechanism inhibiting the downstream effector caspases we demonstrated significant overexpression of survivin protein in 65% of native BCP-ALL (n=69) and further upregulation after CD40-stimulation (n=6) compared to the unstimulated control (632pg/ml+200pg/ml vs 180pg/ml+52pg/ml). Thus, we identified FLIPs as a CD40regulated upstream anti-apoptotic element and concomitant downstream upregulation of survivin protein expression in BCP-ALL as critical mechanisms contributing to apoptosis resistance. Addition of response modifiers inhibiting crucial transcription factors like NFkB regulating FLIP expression or siRNA approaches targeting survivin may in future contribute to optimize the immunological component in alloHSCT.",

            "text": "Converting mixed chimerism to full donor chimerism in recipients of campath-containing reduced-intensity transplants reduces the relapse risk and improves survival compared to those with persistent full donor chimerism B.E. Shaw, J.L. Byrne, E. Das-Gupta, I. Carter, N.H. Russell Nottingham City Hospital (Nottingham, UK) Donor leucocyte infusions (DLI) are frequently required following reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) allografts to S102 convert mixed donor chimerism (MC) to full donor chimerism (FDC). The rationale is to prevent tolerance developing and maximise the graft versus tumour (GvT) responses. However, the impact of chimaeric status on relapse and transplant outcome remains controversial. We analysed the impact of the complete (global) chimerism pattern in 125 recipients of RIC transplants. Transplants were performed for malignant diseases. Conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine, melphalan, campath (65), fludarabine, busulphan, campath (13), BEAM, campath +/fludarabine (38) and other (9). The donors were siblings (68, 55%) or unrelated (57, 45%). The median patient age was 52. The median follow up was 823 days (range 99-2674). Four patterns of chimerism were seen: A. always 100% donor chimerism (68, 54%), B. persisting MC post transplant including cases refractory to DLI (27, 22%) C. MC post transplant with subsequently development of FDC either spontaneously or post DLI (22, 18%), D. lost DC and had autologous reconstitution (8, 6%). A number of patients in both groups B and C had FDC early post transplant. In group A,18 (26%) patients received DLI for relapse or residual disease (RD): complete response in 6 (35%). In group B 10 (37%) patients had DLI: 4 for MC, 1 for RD, 2 for relapse and 3 for both MC and relapse; only partial responses seen (20%). In group C DLI was given in 14 (64%) patients: 4 for MC, 5 for RD, 3 for relapse and 2 for both MC and relapse: complete response in 12 (86%). The 2-year relapse risk (RR) was significantly associated with the chimerism pattern (p=0.012). Group C patients (DLI responders) had a RR of 24% compared to 61% in group B (DLI non-responders) and 37% in group A. There was a significant survival advantage (p=0.009) at 2 years for patients in group C (95%) compared to all other groups (54% -58%). We conclude that patients with MC who later achieve FDC have a lower incidence of disease relapse than those with persistent MC, supporting the use of DLI in this group. However the observation that the patients receiving DLI to achieve FDC have a superior outcome to those patients with persistent FDC (group A) suggests that this group may have benefited from a GvT effect against minimal residual disease. The use of pre-emptive DLI in this group (despite FDC) may reduce the risk of relapse and improve transplant outcome. To date allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high grade lymphoma suffers from high transplant related mortality and minimal success in achieving long term complete remission. The immunological aspects behind rejection of high grade lymphoma are poorly understood, partly due to the lack of animal models. Using a transgenic mouse lymphoma model, where the proto-oncogene c-myc is driven by parts of the immunoglobuline lambda locus representing a t8;22 translocation as found in Burkitt\u00b4s Lymphoma, we developed a haploidentical transplantation model. c-myc-lambda transgenic C57BL/6 mice were crossbred with DBA mice, giving rise to a F1 generation that develops high grade lymphoma spontaneously within the first 6 months post birth. Primary F1-lymphoma cell lines displayed low MHC class I and class II expression compared to wild type B-cells. When transferred into healthy C57BL/6 parental mice, F1-lymphoma cells were rejected even at high doses of 50 Mio. cells, whereas the syngeneic transfer of 10.000 cells into B6D2F1 mice resulted in 100% mortality due to lymphoma growth. Immunosuppression of C57BL/6 mice by lethal total body irradiation and transplantation of T-cell depleted bone marrow allowed F1-lymphoma to grow when animals were challenged at day +1 after transplantation with 1 Mio. cells. Addback of 10 Mio. parental T-cells together with F1-lymphoma at day +1 completely prevented lymphoma growth, and resulted in long term survival for more than 60 days. When T-cell addback was delayed until day +6 after lymphoma challenge, animals died due to lymphoma progression 7-8 days later. By using \"green\" T-cells from GFP transgenic C57BL/6 mice we could show that spleens 7 days after T-cell addback contained only 0.5% (15% of total CD3+ cells) GFP positive T-cells, whereas up to 15% (55%-75% of total CD3+ cells) of total splenocytes were GFP positive in long term survivors that rejected lymphoma. This indicates that T-cell expansion is associated with lymphoma rejection; animals that receive T-cells after lymphoma has been established do not show any T-cell expansion, even when lymphoma cells display a haplomismatch and mature T-cells are co-localized within the spleen. T-Cell expansion is suppressed when lymphoma cells are present in splenic tissue, indicating efficient immune escape. These results point to the crucial role of pretransplant lymphoma burden for the success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in high grade lymphoma. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens may be of benefit in older patients. However, the probability of relapse may be higher compared to patients transplanted with standard conditioning regimens and also the incidence of chronic graftversus-host-disease (GVHD) is relatively high which may have impact on quality of life and late mortality. In this study we evaluated outcome of partial T cell-depleted allogeneic SCT together with pre-emptive and therapeutic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in 42 patients older than 50 years (median age, 55 years) and compared these results with a cohort of 81 younger patients (median, 35 years). Patients were transplanted for acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission (AML CR1), acute lymphoid leukaemia in first and second remission (ALL CR1,2) and chronic myeloid leukaemia in first chronic phase (CML CP1). The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 120mg/kg body weight, idarubicine 42 mg/m 2 and total body irradiation 9 Gy (TBI). In 12 patients TBI was replaced by busulphan. Donors were HLA-identical siblings. Stem cells were derived from either the bone marrow (n = 98, fixed dose of T lymphocytes: 0.7 x 10 6 /kg) or from the peripheral blood (n = 25, fixed T cell dose: 0.1 x 10 6 /kg). The median follow-up was 6.0 years (median, 1.2-9.5) and 4.5 years (median, 0.5-8.6) in patients aged <50 and \u2265 50 respectively. After SCT, acute GVHD \u2265 grade 2 occurred in 26% of patients aged < 50 years and in 33% of patients aged \u2265 50 years. Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 7% of patients aged <50 years compared to 13% in patients aged \u2265 50 years. The two years probability of non-relapse mortality was 18% in patients aged < 50 years and 27% in patients aged \u2265 50. The 4 years probabilities of relapse, survival, leukaemia-free survival (LFS) and current LFS in both groups are shown in table 1. We conclude that T cell-depleted SCT combined with preemptive and therapeutic DLI is still a very feasible procedure even in older patients. The low incidence of chronic GVHD and a plateau in the survival curve of these patients after median 2 years may even exceed the results of RIC transplantation strategies.",

            "text": "Assessing the risk of relapse associated with glutamine use in allogeneic transplantation P.S. Maclean, A.N. Parker, I.G. McQuaker Glasgow Royal Infirmary (Glasgow, UK) Hepatic injury predisposing to veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is thought to be largely due to reduction of anti-oxidants, such as glutathione, resulting from intensive conditioning regimens. Glutamine is rate limiting in the regeneration of glutathione and, therefore, critical in limiting the effects of its depletion. Parenteral glutamine has been shown to preserve hepatic function post SCT and we have used this approach to reduce VOD risk in selected patients. However, concerns have been raised that, as well as protecting sinusoidal endothelial cells, glutamine may protect malignant cells from the effects of conditioning. This study sets out to establish whether the use of glutamine results in any adverse effect on relapse rate. From January 2000 to June 2005 we have performed 186 allogeneic transplants (102 sibling, 84 volunteer unrelated donors). The patient demographics were 108 male, 78 female, median age at transplant 41 (range 16-63). The conditioning regime was myeloablative in 61% (113/186) and reduced intensity in 39% (72/186). In 68% (127/186) peripheral blood was the stem cell source and in 32% (59/186) bone marrow (BM) was used. Glutamine was used in 40% (75/186) of patients perceived to be at high risk of VOD; those with abnormal liver function, and those extensively pre-treated. There have been 29 relapses post transplant, 10 in the glutamine group (relapse rate 13%) with 19 in the nonglutamine group (relapse rate 18%). Kaplan Meier analysis shows no excess relapse up to 2 years post transplant, but 3 late relapses (>2yrs post SCT) have occurred in the glutamine group. Using Cox regression analysis there was no excess risk of relapse (p=0.74) or significant effect on survival (p=0.58) associated with the use of Glutamine. Subgroup analysis by stem cell source or conditioning regime showed no significant differences in survival or relapse. However, among those receiving BM sourced stem cells the early suggestion is that relapse is more frequent in the glutamine group. Only 1 death was attributable to VOD (0.5%), and he had received glutamine. Overall glutamine is well tolerated and associated with a low incidence of severe VOD. In the first 2 years of follow up we have not shown any evidence of an excess relapse rate, though a small number of late relapses have occurred in those receiving glutamine. It should be remembered that these are, by definition, a higher risk group, and on going monitoring for the possibility of late relapse is required.",

In the other cases, GM-CSF (at a reduced total dose of 500 mcg) is given from day 5 to day 9. The median follow-up of patients alive in CCR (20), although promising (4 relapses), is currently 13 months, compared to the median of relapse in the 2 first groups (6 months). Overall, TRM at day 100 is 2/29, reflecting the good tolerance of the conditioning in a heavily pre-treated population (median age : 43). Overall relapse rate for all patients treated with GM-CSF, without the benefit of NKalloreactivity, is 3/16 (median FU: 15 months), 2/11 in step 3 patients compared to 2/9 in the NK+ group. We conclude that GM-CSF, without DLI, might improve the outcome and the relapse rate of NK-patients without exposing them to severe GVHD. From 2001 to 2005 16 transplantations from haploidentical relatives were performed in 15 poor-prognosis pts with hematological malignancies (AML-4, CML-4, NHL-3, JMML-3, ALL-1). One pt with CML had relapsed 7 mo after PBSCT from mother and was grafted 16 mo later from father. The median age was 11 (0.9-18) years. Nine pts received 3 antigen, 5 pts 2 antigen and 2 pts 1 antigen mismatched grafts. Mothers as donors were chosen in 14 cases. RIC regimens included fludarabine 180 mg/m\u00b2, horse ATG 40 mg/kg and busulfan 8 mg/kg (n=12) or treosulfan 22500-30000 mg/m\u00b2 (n=4). The PBSC with a median number of 6.3 (2.0-12.4) x 10 6 CD34+ cell/kg with 4.6 (2.2-8.6) x 10 8 CD3+/kg were infused after incubation in vitro with vincristine and methylprednisolone to obtain a functional T-cell depletion. Cyclosporin A and short methotrexate were used as a GvHD prophylaxis. WBC and PLT levels >1.0 x 10 9 /l and >20 x 10 9 /l were reached on day+12 (9-18) and +11 (0-22), respectively. All pts experienced a full donor chimerism by d+90 or earlier. Acute GvHD grade 0 in 4 pts, grade I in 3, II in 4 and III in 4 pts, respectively, and was sensitive to ATG+steroids therapy. Chronic GvHD experienced in 4 out of 8 pts survived more than 100 days in CR (50%) (disseminated in 1, limited in 3). Nine pts are alive and well in CR. Six pts died: 4 from DP, 1 from sepsis and 1 from fungal pneumonia. DFS, EFS and OS were 61.9%, 42.9% and 64.3% with a median follow-up of 34, 26 and 34.1 mo., respectively.

LeBlanc, J. Mattsson, B. Omazik, P. Ljungman, O. Ringd\u00e9n Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, S) Background: The strongest anti-leukaemia effect (GVL) is seen in patients with chronic GVHD after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); however, some patients relapse even though they develop chronic GVHD. Patients: This study includes 281 patients with a haematological malignancy who developed chronic GVHD after HSCT. A majority of the patients were considered as low risk (first CR/CP) with a median age of 33 years (2-63). Median age of the donors was 34 years (3-67). Conditioning was cyclophosphamide (Cy) in combination with total-body irradiation or busulphan. A few patients received reduced intensity conditioning. Bone marrow was the stem cell source in 208 cases and peripheral blood in 73 cases. GVHD prophylaxis mainly consisted of cyclosporine combined with a short course of methotrexate. Results: Of the 281 patients, 55 (20%) relapsed at a median of 21.5 months (5.5-119) after HSCT. In multivariate analysis, we found that higher donor age (OR 1.72, CI 1.12-2.64, p=0.015), the use of ATG (OR 1.90, CI 1.12-3.22, p=0.02) during the conditioning, and developing chronic GVHD within 168 days after HSCT (OR 1.75, CI 1.02-2.99, p=0.04) were significantly associated to relapse when corrected for disease stage. The 3-year survival, from time of relapse, in patients receiving a second HSCT, bulk DLI, escalating doses of DLI, and no DLI were 31%, 33%, 40%, and 10%, respectively (p=0.002). Conclusion: In patients who experience chronic GVHD, the strongest GVL effect was seen in patients with younger donors, in those who did not receive ATG during conditioning, and when chronic GVHD occurred late.",

Zhelnova, I. Demidova, L. Mendeleeva, L. Liubimova, A. Misiurin, E. Parovitchnikova, V. Savchenko, E. Zhelnova Russian National Centre for Hematology (Moscow, RUS) Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are considered to be the treatment of choice in pts with relapses after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Their effect is based on alloreactivity of donor lymphocytes (DL), mediating a graftversus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Rodent experiments showed the stronger GVL effect when non-tolerant DL were administered to mixed hematopoietic chimeras (MC). It was reported that the concominant administration of cytokines (IL-2, IFN-alfa) and DLI leads to quick conversion to complete donor chimerism (CC) from MC and remission in pts relapsed after ASCT. We aimed to find out the dependance of CC induction and remission duration from chimerism status before DLI treatment combined or not with IL-2 i.v. administration. 20 pts were treated with DLI for relapses after ASCT from related siblings in 2001-2005. 6 of them were included in the study. Median age was 20 y (16-31), 5 men/1 woman, 3 pts with AML, 2 -CML, 1-MDS. 1 pt received reduced intensity ASCT, 5-conventional one. Median time to relapse was 17 months (3,5 -48 months). All pts with AL/MDS received chemotherapy before DLI. CML pts were treated with Hydrea and Glivec and then DLI were administrated. Median dose of infused DL was 6,34 x 10 8 /kg (median 6 transfusions per pt). Chimerism status was investigated on BM and PB using VNTR/STR analysis at relapse, before every DLI and monthly after DLI completion. All pts demonstrated MC in bone marrow before chemotherapy (median 74% of host DNA). 4 pts were still MC before DLI (median 38% of host DNA), 2 pts became CC. In 4 pts DLI were combined with IL-2 (2 MU with every DLI). In 4 pts with MC only 1 (with CML) became CC after 1 course of DLI and developed aGVHD II-III and then cGVHD. 3 pts (with AL and MDS) were still MC remaining in hematological remission. One of them died of CMV infection. 2 pts recieved the 2 course of DLI + IL-2, became CC and are still well and alive (1 -with cGVHD, 1 -without GVHD) for 30 months. 2 pts with CC before DLI+IL-2 (1-with CML, 1 -with AL) showed no GVHD and soon relapsed (1 and 3 months) despite the 2 DLI course in 1 pt. Despite the small and heterogenious stadied group we may conclude, that DLI administration during MC leads to more prominent GVL effect especially when combined with IL-2. It seems possible that host antigen presenting cells (maybe of S105 tumor origin) in MC pts allow improved presentation of host antigenes to DL and induct optimal antitumor effect.",

Schmitz Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Dresden (Dresden, D) Objectives: Efforts to decrease the risk of GvHD by depleting T cells from the graft in CML patients have been complicated by an increased incidence of leukemia-relapse. Newer protocols using CD34+ selected hematopoietic cells from matched-sibling donors and subsequent infusion of T cells in incremental doses to treat or avoid relapse of disease seem to be more promising. We tried to further optimize this approach by the prophylactic infusion of cytotoxic T cells activated exvivo against leukemia-associated/specific antigens using peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Patients and Methods: Within an ongoing phase I/II trial, six patients with chronic myeloid leukemia received CD34+ selected peripheral blood progenitor cells from matched sibling (n=4) or unrelated (n=2) allogeneic donors after ablative conditioning therapy. Five patients underwent transplantation because of intolerance (n=1) or nonresponsiveness to imatinib mesylate. Conditioning therapy was performed with 8-12 Gy Total-body irradiation, 5 x 40 mg/sqm (total doses 200 mg/sqm) Fludarabine, 10 mg/kg Thiotepa and 40 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin. Cyclosporine (CsA) was added from day -10 to day -3 to as prophylaxis for graft-rejection. No post-grafting CsA was used. Donor T cell lines were subsequently generated by stimulating CD8+ selected T cells with bcr/abl ( n=3) and/or proteinase-3 (n=4) derived HLA-restricted peptides loaded onto donor-derived dendritic cells. Results: Rapid engraftment could be achieved in all patients without infectious complications or significant extramedullary toxicity. After 3-4 weekly restimulations 1 to 50 x 107 ex-vivo activated donor T cells were infused on up to three occasions between day 21 and day 150 after transplantation. With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 4-24) all patients are alive with three of them having undetectable levels of bcr/abl transcripts measured by quantitative PCR. No acute or chronic GvHD occurred after the infusions of ex-vivo stimulated T cells. In two cases, imatinib was started after bcr/abl transcript levels had risen after day 100. One patient achieved a second molecular remission after the additional infusion of unmodified donor lymphocytes and could stop imatinib. Conclusion: These data suggest that ex-vivo generated T cell lines reactive against leukemia-associated antigens can be safely infused in patients with CML early after allogeneic transplantation without an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease or relapse. Objectives: End-of-life care (ELC) has gained much interest in medicine recently. However, little is known about ELC in HSCT units, despite substantial transplant-related mortality. Employing a qualitative approach, the aim of the study was to examine ELC in HSCT as perceived by physicians and nurses. Methods: 32 interviews were conducted in 3 HSCT units (Basel, Ulm, Vienna) with 12 doctors and 20 nurses who were at least 3 years on the unit. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. Data were analyzed according to \"grounded theory\", an established qualitative research methodology. Results: The main finding was that doctors and nurses differ in their perception of when the shift from a curative approach to ELC is appropriate. All nurses interviewed are prone to begin ELC earlier than doctors. Characteristics of individual centers and attitudes of patients each influence the time at which ELC is initiated. The potential for conflict within the treatment team is related to the degree to which doctors and nurses agree about the appropriateness of ELC. Strategies such as devaluation of the other professional group, persistence in maintaining one's own view, or unwillingness to pursue discussion divide the team and diminish the quality of patient care. On the other hand, strategies such as acknowledging the other's view or showing interest in arguments of the other professional group enhance team cohesion and improve patient care. All these strategies are used both by physicians and nurses. Conclusions: Views of HSCT physicians and nurses are frequently in conflict about when to switch to ELC. Our findings may help in the development of guidelines that promote team cohesion during the decision of when to change over to ELC care.",

Vandenberghe St. James Hospital (Dublin, IRL) Loss of bone mineral density is a complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The mechanisms of loss of bone density post transplantation are complex and probably multifactorial. The medical notes of 218 SCT patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine the incidence and risk factors for osteoporosis and osteopenia. Data collected included; diagnosis, lifestyle, chemotherapy, weight loss in the peritransplant period, use of steroid treatment, chronic graft versus host disease and hormonal parameters including sex hormones and thyroid function tests. The results were correlated with the results of bone density scans (DEXA). 167 patients( 74 female and 93 male) had DEXA scans. We found a high prevalence of osteoporosis post SCT at 10%. Osteopenia was diagnosed in 46%. Median time from bone marrow transplantation to DEXA was 6 years. The median age at SCT was 28 years. Surprisingly, no correlation was seen between primary diagnosis and the prevalence of osteopenia/ osteoporosis. No difference in the rate of osteoporosis or osteopenia was seen between the patients who had chemotherapy treatment pre SCT and those in whom SCT was the primary mode of treatment. Concerning SCT conditioning, patients were categorised according to whether they received total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their conditioning or chemotherapy alone. There was no statistically significant difference between the rate of osteoporosis/ osteopenia between the TBI and chemotherapy groups (p=0.281). There is a strong association between both steroid treatment and GVHD and osteoporosis ( table 2). 32% of the normal/healthy subjects were on steroid treatment post SCT compared to 60% of those with osteopenia and 71% of those with osteoporosis. There was a significant non-linear association between osteoporosis and the duration of treatment with steroids (p=0.03). A similar analysis looked at the time on immunosupressents ( including cyclosporin, tacrolimus or both) and found no significant association with osteoporosis. There was no association between hormone levels and osteoporosis/ osteopenia. This study shows the high prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in a young patient cohort post SCT. Further study into this field , regarding how best to alleviate the effects of SCT on bone metabolism is needed to prevent lifelong morbidity. The data on the incidence and causes of late (> 100 d) nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in adult autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) recipients is limited. We have analysed NRM in a cohort of 1482 adult patients who received ASCT in 1990 ASCT in -2003 in six Finnish transplant centres. The most common diagnoses included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (N=542), multiple myeloma (MM) (N=528), breast cancer (N=126), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (N=86) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (N=63). Altogether 164 patients (12 %) received total body irradiation (TBI) as a part of highdose regimen. Until September 2005, 646 patients (44 %) have died. Late NRM was observed in 69 patients (4.7% of ASCT recipients, 9 % of all deaths). There were 39 males and 30 females with median age of 58 years (24-69) at the time of ASCT. The median time from ASCT to late NRM was 796 days (102-3354). The risk of late NRM was highest in patients with HL and CLL (9%) followed by MM (5%) and NHL (5%). Secondary malignancy was the most common cause of late NRM (26 patients, 38% of late NRM). Altogether 14 patients (1 % ASCT recipients) have died from secondary haematologic malignancy (AML 7, MDS 7); only one of these patients (6 %) had received TBI-based conditioning. Solid tumours were the cause of death in 12 patients. Altogether 22 patients (32 % of late NRM) died from infectious causes. Nine patients died from pneumonia and eight from sepsis. Cardiovascular reasons were the cause on late NRM in 12 patients, most commonly myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy.",

            "text": "Late TRM, especially secondary malignancies are important causes of death in ASCT recipients. Even fatal late infections may occur several years after ASCT. These facts stress the importance of long-term follow-up in ASCT recipients. We have analyzed the incidence and risk factors of developing a secondary malignancy after total body irradiation (TBI) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). From March 1986-Dec 2002, 205 patients received TBI as a part of the HSCT conditioning regimen (6 fractions, twice a day, total dose of 12 Gy, median dose rate of 11.44 cGy/min). Allogeneic HSCT was performed in 119 patients, the other 86 patients received an autologous HSCT (AHSCT). Median age was 30 ys (5-63). We have calculated the cumulative incidence of solid tumors and secondary hematologic malignancies among these patients. Death due to noncancerous causes and patients lost to follow-up were entered as a competitive risk. With a median follow-up of 32 months (0.2-229)-including patients deceased in the first three months-13 (6.3%) developed a secondary malignancy, 7 of them (3.4%) developed a solid tumor and 6 (2.9%) developed a secondary hematologic malignancy. The 7 patients who developed a solid tumor-1 glioblastoma, 2 head and neck carcinoma, 2 basocelular carcinoma, 1 osteosarcoma and 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-had received an allo-HSCT. The 6 patients that developed a secondary hematologic malignancy-5 therapy-related leukemia / myelodisplasia (t-AML/MDS) and 1 B cell non Hodgkin s lymphoma-had received an AHSCT. The overall probability of developing a secondary malignancy after HSCT is 2.5% at 3 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-6); 5% at 10 years (95% CI 2.6-9.3), and 9% at 15 years (95% CI 5-16.5). The probability of developing a solid tumor after HSCT is 0.5% at 3 years (95% CI 0.1-3.6), 1.8 % at 10 years (95% CI 0.6-5.5), and 6 % at 15 years (95% CI 2.6-13.7) and the probability of developing a secondary hematologic malignancy is 2% at 3 years (95% CI 0.8-5.3), and 3,1% at 10 and 15 years (95% CI 1.4-6.9). Median time to develop a solid tumor was 134 months (29-229). Median time to develop a secondary hematologic malignancy was 31 (3-60) months. Multivariate analysis proved that allo-HSCT was the only risk factor of developing a solid tumor, and that AHSCT and advanced age were risk factors of developing secondary hematologic malignancy (mean age 30 vs. 50 years). To conclude, the probability of developing a solid tumor after HSCT is higher if an allo-HSCT has been performed and increases with time. AHSCT and advanced age are risk factors for the development of a secondary hematologic malignancy, a risk that decreases 5 years after AHSCT. Long term analyses on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients are reported mainly after non-transplant therapies (splenectomy, HU, IFN) while major studies on transplant rarely extend beyond 5 years of median observation. Here we report a series of 79 CML patients who underwent allogeneic myeloablative transplant from HLA identical sibling at a single institution between 1983 and 1994 with a median follow up of 14.5 years. Median age was 36 years; 56 were in 1st CP, 17 in AP and 6 in BP. Preparative regimens were TBI based in 35 and Busulfan in 44. GVHD prophylaxis consinsted of CsA (28) or CsA+MTX (51). Bone marrow was the source of stem cells in all cases. With a minimum follow up of 10 years, 40 died (7 from disease and 33 from non relapse mortality) and 39 are alive, leading to an overall survival of 50.5%; no additional events were recorded after that point, except for one pt who developed leukemia in donor cells and died at 10,8 years from BMT. Factors associated with a better survival in multivariate analysis were: phase at transplant (59.8% in CP, 34.1% in AP, 16.6% in CB), sex (female 63.3% vs male 37.4%), conditioning regimen (Bus 61.3% vs TBI 37.4%) and a shorter interval (continuous variable) between diagnosis and transplant.",

            "text": "A. Mumm, P. Auclair, J. Weis, H.H. Bartsch Tumor Biology Center (Freiburg, D) A specialised in-patient rehabilitation program was developed at the Tumor Biology Center (KTB) in Freiburg, Germany for patients after allogenic stem cell transplantation. The main aims of this medical and psychosocial program are to decrease the degree of restrictive late effects of the transplantation and to increase the medium-term and longterm quality of life of this patient group. The purpose of this study, sponsored by the German Jos\u00e9 Carreras Leuk\u00e4mie-Stiftung e.V., was to evaluate this rehabilitation program. The results should help to identify the patients who could benefit most from the program. The study was designed as a prospective controlled trial with repeated measurements. The treatment group consisted of 132 patients who were taking part in the in-patient rehabilitation program at the KTB. We also recruited a control-group of out-patients from several transplantation centres. In-patients received the first questionnaire on their admission to the hospital, out-patients at an early control appointment at their transplantation centre (T1). T2 was at discharge from the hospital or four to six weeks after T1. T3 was six months and T4 twelve months after T2. The questionnaires were established standardized instruments. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a large number of rehabilitation patients have been investigated over a time of more than one year. A total of 132 rehabilitation patients and 23 control group patients took part in the study. Two types of analysis were made. First, patients in the control group were compared with a matching partner from the rehabilitation group. Second, the whole rehabilitation group was described over the course of the study. The rehabilitation patients showed poorer initial values than the control patients. The psychosocial and physical parameters improved in both groups over time. The results therefore show that patients who are more restricted and in need of support take part in the in-patient rehabilitation program. Although most patients show improvements and manage to reach the same level as a healthy group after one year, some patients have to continue to live with the restrictions resulting from the transplantation. Secondary malignancy is a serious complication that occurs in 2.2-13.0% of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Here we report a case of leukemia S108 that developed two neoplastic diseases after HSC transplantation, one of which arose from donor cells. A 58year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as mixed-lineage leukemia in June 2000. The patient showed poor response to combination chemotherapy, and underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from an HLAidentical sibling female donor in November 2000. The donor had a history of gastric cancer that was considered cured at the time of transplantation. The conditioning regimen adopted was as follows: total body irradiation (12 Gy in six fractions given twice daily from day -8 to day -6), cytarabine (2 g/m\u00b2 twice daily from day -5 to day -4 and once daily from day -3 to day -2), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day from day -3 to day -2), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (100 \u00b5g/body subcutaneous infusion once daily from -6 to -3). Short-term methotrexate and cyclosporin A were given as prophylaxic purpose against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Successful engraftment was documented on day +14 using chromosomal and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, and complete chimerism of the bone marrow and remission of the disease have been maintained for more than five years after the transplantation. The patient developed de novo chronic GVHD with skin rash and stomatitis that was effectively treated with combination immunosuppressive therapy. The first neoplastic disease after the transplantation was diagnosed as gastric tubular adenocarcinoma, and the patient underwent distal partial gastrectomy in January 2002. Cytogenetic analysis was not performed for the tumor sample. The second neoplastic disease was diagnosed as gingival squamous cell carcinoma in July 2005. Cytogenetic and FISH analyses of the surgically removed sample showed normal female karyotype, suggesting that the donor-derived peripheral HSC constituted the recipient's oral mucosal tissue that was later transformed into malignant squamous cells due to some critical genetic hits. Our case is consistent with the plasticity of HSC in differentiating into various cell-types. However, it is still possible that the circulating cancer cells from the donor's gastric tumor contaminated the graft and eventually caused the mucosal tumor in the recipient. The present report summarized our experience with development of secondary malignancies after high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients and methods: a cohort of 490 patients (195 females and 295 males) with the median of age 51 years (16-73) underwent ASCT at our institution between November 1993 and September 2005 with following diagnosis: lymphoma/m. Hodgkin (232 pts), myeloma (165 pts), leukaemia (25 pts), CLL (33 pts), germ cell tumor (12 pts), breast cancer (18 pts) and other (5 pts). Conditioning regimens were BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, ara-C, melphalan) in 232 pts, melphalan alone in 183 pts, busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 25 pts, cyclophosphamide alone in 33 pts, CarboPEC (carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide) in 12 pts and other in 5 pts. 463 pts (94%) underwent peripherial blood stem cell collection, bone marrow was harvested in 6 pts (1%) and peripherial blood stem cell together with bone marrow in 21 pts (4%). Results: In all, 16 pts (3%) with primary diagnosis of lymphoma (10), CLL (5) and breast cancer (1) developed at a median follow up of 59 months (1-141) following second malignancies: MDS/AML 2 (12,5%), solid tumors 11 (68,8%), EBV-lymphoproliferative disorders 2 (12,5%) and morbus Hodgkin 1 (6,2%). Second cancers developed at a median of 23 months (1-95 months) following ASCT and 38 months (9-122 months) following the diagnosis of primary malignancy. Only one of the 16 pts is alive, the median survival from diagnosis of second malignancy is 7 months with the probability of 5 year survival 6%. Conclusion: this study has evaluated a heterogeneous population of patients undergoing ASCT, so it is difficult to predict the risk of second malignancy for individual patient. However, we conclude, that patients who have undergone HDT and ASCT are in significant risk for developing secondary malignancies, hence long term survivors of transplant require regular monitoring for early signs of cancer because of poor prognosis of secondary malignancies. Of 197 hematopoietic stem cell recipients prepared with conventional myeloablative conditioning and immunoprophylaxis, 8 (4%) developed BOOP after a median interval of 420 days post-transplant. No BOOP was diagnosed in the comparison population comprising 84 stem cell recipients transplanted with a CD34 purified graft (n=70) or following in vivo T-cell depletion using alemtuzumab (n=14) (p<0.05). Chronic GVHD was ascertained in all BOOP patients and was observed more frequently (p<0.001) in the conventional transplant group. The probability of developing BOOP post HSCT was 4.7% for all stem cell recipients and the overall mortality of BOOP patients could be assessed with 11%. Among patients transplanted without T-cell depletion 10 (5%) developed BO while no BO was observed after T-cell depletion (p<0.05). In conclusion our evaluation confirms a strong association between donor T-cells, chronic GVHD and the development of BO and BOOP. Our data point out the significant impact of T lymphocytes in the pathomechanisms of BOOP and BO. More than two thirds of allo-SCT patients develop persistent anaemia beyond the first month of the transplant. The main objectives of this study were to determine the aetiology of this complication and the degree of response to erythropoiesisstimulating protein administration. Between May 2002 and February 2005, 87 HLA-identical allo-SCT were performed in our institution; of them, 63 (72%) showed persistent anaemia S109 at a median of 34 days (30-244) post-transplant. In 22 (30%) the anaemia was secondary to haemorrhage, graft failure, haemolysis, leukaemic relapse, or severe infection. In 41 (70%) patients there wasn't an evident aetiology, and were considered to have primary anaemia, which represented an incidence of 45% of the total of patients submitted to allo-SCT. In the multivariate analysis two independent factors predicted primary anaemia: renal toxicity during the first month of the transplant (RR 2.6, p=0.007) and delay in platelet engraftment (RR 2.5, p=0.006). All 38 patients in which serum Epo was quantified had median (range) value unexpectedly low (43.2 mU/mL; 2.5-134); 34 of them received either epoietin alfa (n=11) or darbepoietin (n=23). In 26 (86%) patients a major response was achieved (increment of Hb>20 g/L and Hb>100 g/L without RBC-transfusion) and 2 (7%) attained a minor response. Two (7%) patients did not respond (1 relapsed shortly after the treatment and 1 had a persistent CMV infection) and in 4 cases response was not valuable. Within the responding group (n=28), Epo was discontinued without anaemization in 25 patients, after median of administration of 7 months (1-30), and 3 patients are still being treated. Median (range) ferritin level at the beginning and at the end of the Epo treatment was of 2710 (168-15200) ng/mL and 1112 (14-1725) ng/mL, respectively (p=0.01). In conclusion, primary anaemia after allo-SCT is more frequent than expected and it is associated to renal toxicity and subsequent inadequate Epo secretion. Primary anaemia easily reverts with exogenous Epo administration, which contributes to reduce iron overload.",

Studies describing these complications are rare and mostly concerning pediatric patients. To establish the etiology of seizures and to evaluate the risk factors for their occurence in adult HSCT recipients and their impact on transplant outcome, we reviewed records of 310 consecutive recipients of HSCT, transplanted between January 1994 and February 2005. Results: We found 24/310 (7,8 %) patients who developed seizures. In 14 (58,3 %) of 24 patients, seizures were due to cyclosporine neurotoxicity; in 4 (16,7 %) there was an infective cause (encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis); in 3 (12,5 %) patients we could find a metabolic cause (jaundice or multiorgane failure); in 3 (12,5 %) patients we could not establish a cause. 22 (91,7 %) of 24 patients were conditioned with a TBI containing regimen and 2 (8,3%) of 24 underwent the transplant with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. In 19 cases the donor was an unrelated voluntary donor and in one case a mismatched familial donor (83,3%), while only in 4 (16,7%) of 24 patients the donor was an HLA identical sibling. Only 2/24 patients survived and are alive and well. We studied as potential risk factors in univariate analysis with Chi-Square test: the conditioning regimen myeloablative or not (p=n.s.), the use of total body irradiation (TBI) (p< 0.001) versus no TBI regimens, the disease stage early versus advanced (p=n.s.) the stem cells source bone marrow versus peripheral blood (p=n.s.) and the donor type HLA identical sibling versus alternative donor (mismatched familial or voluntary unrelated donor) (p< 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that the use of alternative donor significantly (p=0.003) correlated with the onset of seizures. Conclusions: As well known in solid organ transplantation in HSCT recipients the main cause of seizures is identified in cyclosporine neurotoxicity, while less frequently the cause is infective or metabolic. We found a high correlation for seizures occurrence with TBI conditioning instead of chemotherapy alone regimens and we confirm the role of genetic disparity (alternative donor stem cells source) in seizures occurrence and the poor outcome for seizures hematopoietic stem cells transplantation recipients.",

As the survival of these patients increases, long term complications such as osteoporosis should be considered, because it associates with morbidity and mortality of the patients directly. The pupose of this study is Comparison of bone mineral density changes before and after BMT in the patients suffering from leukemia and lymphoma. Methods: We have prospectively investigated 63 patients undergoing BMT for acute and chronic leukemia and lymphoma (hodgkin and non Hodgkin). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual x-ray absorptiometry before BMT then 6 and 12 months after it .Osteocalsin and bone alkaline phosphatase as markers of bone formation and cterminal telopeptides of type 1 collagen as a marker of bone resorption were assessed. Moreover serum concentration of calcium, phosphorous, vitamin D, parthormone (PTH) and sex hormones [follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) , leutinizing hormone(LH), testostorone and estradiol] were measured. Results: There was significant decrease in BMD of femoral neck 6 months after BMT(4.9% decrease in allogenic and 3.2% in autologous) but no considerable changes were seen in lumbar vertebras(figure 1 and 2) . However more decrease in bone loss betwen 6th and 12th months was not observed.",

Introduction: haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is able to cure a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases. HSCT is associated with many physical and psychological threats to quality of life (QoL); attention must now be extended also to the evaluation of overall QoL, especially in older (over 50) patients (pts). Methods: 70 pts were evaluated, median age 57 (50-64), 45 men and 25 women; 38 pts underwent myeloablative (MY) HSCT and 32 reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). A sibling was the donor in 31 cases (2 x another relative), a matched unrelated donor in 22 and a mismatched unrelated donor in 15 cases. Diagnosis: AML, CML, MDS, NHL, CLL, solid tumours, myeloproliferative diseases. QoL was evaluated using questionnaires sent by mail. Questionnaires in Czech were based on the well-validated international Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant Scale (FACT-BMT); included were 3 other sections about chronic GvHD-related symptoms and sexual and work activities. Results: Overall 49 pts (70%) survive for 31 (5-56) months; 21 (30%) pts have died: 15 (21%) from transplant-related mortality (TRM), 4 (6%) from relapse. Twenty-one (66%) of the pts undergoing RIC survive, 7 (22%) died of TRM, 2 (6%) died of relapse. 27 (71%) of pts undergoing MY survive. 8 (21%) died of TRM and 2(5%) died of relapse. Of the 24 pts aged 55-59 undergoing MY (n=12), 8 (67%) survive and the TRM is 25%, while in the same age group undergoing RIC (n=12), 7 (58%) survive and the TRM is 33%. Of the 13 pts aged 60-65 undergoing MY (n=3), all survive, while in the same age group undergoing RIC (n=10) 5 (50%) survive; TRM: 40%. QoL: the scores reported in FACT-BMT were high with the exception of functional well-being. Occupational functioning: the majority of patients are disabled, less than 20% are employed full-time. Sexual function: 33% described their sexual activities to be as satisfactory as pretransplant, 33% are active after a period of 6 months (3-11) sexual disability, 33% previously active pts are still not sexually active 25 months (10-57) after HSCT. The question: \"Would you undergo HSCT once again at your experience?\" 100% pts answered \"Yes\". Conclusion: The authors believe that no patient should be excluded from the allogenneic HSCT program because of age. The QoL in majority of pts is very good, only a minority of pts are employed full time and one third of these older pts described their sexual activity as satisfying as prior HSCT.

Feldman Fundacion Favaloro, Hospital Aleman (Buenos Aires, RA) Autologous BMT experience on patients (pts)with impaired cardiac function or chronic heart diseases is scarce. We performed a retrospective review of 254 consecutive pts who underwent ABMT due to hematologic malignancies at our units between September 1991 to June 2005. Pts characteristics, clinical course and transplant related mortality (TRM) were compared between pts with (n=19)(group A) or without cardiac diseases(n=235)(group B). Group A included 6 pts.with valvulopathy , 5 dilated cardiomiopathy, 4 coronary artery disease, 2 arrythmias, 1 congenital cardiopathy and 1 pericardial restrictive disease. Echocardiographic findings: 47 % of pts had low left ventricle ejection fraction ( < 50% and >30%); 36,8% with wall motion abnormalities; 36,8 % dilated left ventricle and 31,6% with valvular disease. Comparing both groups, no significative difference was found regarding gender (M 55% vs 51%),primary disease (lymphoma: 57,9 vs 51%; leukemia 10,5 vs 18%; myeloma 31,6 vs 20%), stem cell source:bone marrow 10,5 vs 14,6%; peripheral blood stem cells: 89,5 vs 85,4%. Mean age in group A was 49,9 years \u00b1 13 vs 36,1 \u00b116 (p< 0,001). Conditioning was with BU-CY, CVB, BEAM, Melphalan, 6 pts. of group A received high doses of cyclophosphamide as part of their treatment. Results: no significative difference was observed between both groups regarding: hospitalization length (23.3 \u00b1 5.6 vs 24.1 \u00b1 12.3), neutrophil engrafment time (11.2 \u00b1 4 vs 12.1 \u00b1 5.5), platelet engrafment time (13 (Range:10-155) vs 12,1 (R:6-113)), days on antibiotics (10.7 \u00b1 3.8 vs 11.5 \u00b1 6.5), positive blood cultures (26,3 % vs 27,1 %), packed red cells transfusion (4 vs 3,2) or platelets transfusion (4,5 vs 5,7). Complications after ABMT such as grade III-IV mucositis (53 vs 57%) hepatic (10,5 vs 11,3%), pulmonary (5,3 vs 4,2%) or renal toxicities (5,9 vs 4,2% ) and arrythmias (5,3 vs 2,8%)were similar between groups. Heart failure showed statistical difference (15,9 vs 2,8%)with RR 4,8 (CI 1,3-17,3).TRM did not reach significance (5,3% in A group vs 3,9 %)RR 1,38 (CI 0,18-10,3) Transplantation follow-up and overall incidence of non cardiac complications were similar in both groups.Heart failure appeared more frequently in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease but adequate therapeutical measures avoided an increase in TRM. Careful selection of patients with stable, mild-to-moderate heart disease patients for ABMT can achieve similar transplant related complications than controls P519 Late effects of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation E. Di Bartolomeo, S. Santarone, P. Di Bartolomeo Ospedale Civile (Pescara, I) The purpose of this study was to analyze medical late effects among patients with TM treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Overall, 111 patients (M56, F55) were transplanted from HLA identical related donors. Transplant related mortality was 9%. As of March 2005, 99 patients are living (95 free of thalassemia and 4 with autologous reconstitution) after a median follow-up of 14 years and are included in our analysis. Late deaths. Two patients died from septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy 54 months post-HSCT and from parotitis carcinoma 138 months post-HSCT, respectively. Chronic graft-versus-host disease. The actuarial probability of developing cGvHD was 17% (7% limited, 10% extensive). Only two patients are under immunosuppressive therapy for active cGvHD with lung involvement and pulmonary insufficiency. Secondary malignancies. One patient showed parotitis carcinoma 134 months post-HSCT and died 4 months later. An other patient was diagnosed with carcinoma of cervix and is now living and doing well following surgical treatment. Pulmonary complications. Pulmonary function tests were done in 58 patients. The mean value expressed in liters for VC, FVC and FEV1 was 3.46 +/-0.83 (83% of predicted value), 3.44 +/-0.79 (82%) and 3.08 +/-0.68 (86%) respectively. The pulmonary function was normal in 49 patients. A mild restrictive defect was present in 7 patients, a mild obstructive defect in 1 patient and a mild combined defect in 1 patient. Endocrine dysfunction. The thyroid function was studied in 72 patients. The mean value of TSH was 2.39 +/-1.27 mU/L. The mean value of FT3 and FT4 was 4.2 +/-0.83 and 13 +/-4.26 pg/ml respectively. Six patients are under treatment for hypothyroidism. The parathyroid function evaluated by PTH and the adrenal function evaluated by ACTH and cortisol levels were normal in all patients. Fertility. Eight pregnancies were observed in 4 female patients and in partners of 2 male patients and resulted in 8 normal live births. The median age of these patients at time of HSCT was 15.06 years (13-24). Bone abnormalities. Bone abnormalities were studied in 84 patients. Avascular necrosis of bone was observed in 2 patients with involvement of hip in one and shin-bone in the other patient. Osteoporosis evaluated by dual photon densitometry was diagnosed in 10 patients. Following HSCT a careful follow-up is required to monitor and treat late transplant-related and thalassemia-related complications.",

Here, we report a case of a 32 year old woman diagnosed in chronic phase CML in September 1996. At the time of diagnosis she was pregnant in gestational week 16. She was initially treated with interferon and gave birth to a healthy boy by caesarean section in pregnancy week 33. She subsequently underwent BMT with a HLA matched male sibling donor in July 1997. At the time of BMT she was 100% Ph+ by bone marrow cytogenetic assessment. The conditioning regimen was cyclophasphamide and total body irradiation. She had an eventless post-transplant course with no graft versus host disease. Regular bone marrow cytogenetic assessments showed a normal male karyotype. From 37 months post-BMT and thereafter she was additionally monitored by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). During the whole observation period she had detectable BCR-ABL mRNA with levels in the range 0,1 -0,3 % (BCR-ABL/ABL%). In September 2002 she became pregnant (last menstruation August 21th). From November 2002 she was monitored monthly by RQ-PCR. No raise in BCR-ABL mRNA level was observed, in fact a slow decrease reaching one log of magnitude was observed during the course of the pregnancy. April fourth she gave birth to two healthy girls (dizygotic twins) at gestational week 31. The level of MRD was from then on monitored by RQ-PCR initially every 2-3 months and later every four to six months. A slow, steady increase of BCR-ABL mRNA has been observed during the last two years and she currently has a level of MRD comparable to the period before the pregnancy. Our patient did not have a relapse during pregnancy, although she had detectable MRD for the whole period monitored by RQ-PCR. Furthermore, we believe that by closely monitoring the level of MRD we had a chance to intervene if BCR-ABL mRNA had significantly increased during the pregnancy.",

The nutritial status at transplantation may as well be a predictor for survival. We therefore analyzed the values of the body mass index (BMI), the albumin, which shows conjunction to the protein balance of the patient and the C-reactive protein (CRP), higher measures may be related to tumour cachexia. We evaluated retrospectively the BMI, defined as weight in kg / height in m2, CRP and albumin at the day of admission for allogeneic transplantation in 265 consecutive pts. between 2001 and 2005. Due to missing data a few patients had not all three values analyzed. 121 female and 144 male pts. had their first allogeneic trans-plantation for myeloid and lymphoid malignancy. In 81 transplantations a sibling and in 184 an unre-lated donor served as the donor. In 247 transplantations PBSC was the graft source and in 18 BM. An univariate analysis for the overall survival was performed using GraphPad Prism\u00ae. Results: Median BMI in all patients is 24,757511 kg / m2. The statistical analysis shows no significant difference, but a trend to better survival in pts. with a BMI above the median. As well no differences where seen between the groups: BMI <20; \u2265 20 and <25; \u2265 25 kg/m\u00b2. There was no increased risk for the 4 obese pts. (BMI > 34, 9) to die. The median albumin is 4,1 g/dl; in the group > the median 100/139 pts. (72%) are alive compared to 57/121 pts (47%) with an albumin < 4,1 g/dl (p < 0.0001). Pts. with a CRP < the median value of 8 mg/l at admission had a significant better probability of survival at the day of evaluation (p< 0.05). In both groups the pts. with a lymphoid malignancy where balanced 26 versus 28 pts.. S112 Conclusion: Preconditioning albumin and C-reactive protein values significantly predict overall survival after alloHCT. They are associated with an impaired nutritional status at HCT, but as well may be an indicator of illness as an acute phase reaction. The BMI alone, even in the different groups, is not a good predictor.",

Raunow Royal Melbourne Hospital (Melbourne, AUS) Almost all patients undergoing conditioning with melphalan (mel) or total body irradiation (TBI) will have significant nausea and vomiting occurring after stem cell transplantation and at least 50% of them (but probably >85%) will be non-responsive to standard antiemetics even in high doses. Aprepitant is an oral neurokinin (NK1) inhibitor with potent antiemetic properties in patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The mechanism of action of NK1 inhibitors suggests that this class of agents may be more active than current antiemetics for the control of delayed chemotherapyinduced emesis. The scientific literature related to the control of nausea and vomiting after high dose chemotherapy and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is extremely limited and largely anecdotal. We treated 14 patients undergoing HSCT following mel or TBI-containing conditioning with oral aprepitant. A 125mg oral dose was given on the day prior to mel or TBI and 80mg daily was administered through to day 7 after HSCT or discharge, whichever came sooner. Ondansetron and dexamethasone were administered before HSCT and dexamethasone 8mg intravenously was administered with each post transplant dose of aprepitant. The observation period was for 14 days after HSCT. Conditioning regimens were cyclophosphamide and TBI (2 pts), fludarabine-mel (3) busulphan-mel (2) mel alone (4) and carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and mel (BEAM) (4). Seven of 14 patients had total control of nausea and vomiting in the first week after HSCT and 11 of 14 had total control in the second week. Aprepitant was generally well tolerated. The only toxicity was mild to moderate hiccough in 4 patients present for a median of 5 days. These data suggest that aprepitant may be a useful addition to HSCT antiemetic therapy particularly for the prevention of delayed emesis. A randomised study in a larger cohort is required to establish the true efficacy of this agent.",

Goldman, D. Marin, E. Kanfer, E. Olavarria, J. Apperley, N. Salooja Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) Endocrine dysfunction is common after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and may increase in frequency with time post transplant. We have evaluated the growth hormone axis in 25 patients transplanted for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) at a minimum of 8 years following SCT. In all cases conditioning included total body irradiation (TBI). The aim was to assess a possible contribution of disturbances in the growth hormone (GH) axis to hyperlipidaemia or fatigue, both of which are recognised long term effects of transplantation. Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) measurements together with lipid profiles were measured and patients were asked to complete a self-assessment rating of their energy level. Of 25 patients, 11 were female (median age at follow up 48 y range 42-69) and 14 were male (median age 45 years range 29-54). 19 patients received cells from sibling donors and 6 from unrelated volunteers. TBI doses ranged from 10-14.4 Gy given in 5 or 6 fractions. Patients were evaluated at a median of 13 years (range 8-25y) following SCT. IGF-1 levels were reduced in 6/25 patients all of whom had received sibling SCT. Cholesterol levels were elevated (>5mmol/L) in 19/25 patients with 14 patients having cholesterol >6mmol/L. One additional patient with a normal cholesterol level was on statin medication. Of these 20 patients, IGF-1 levels were low in four. Self-assessment ratings of fatigue were available on 15 patients, 3 of whom gave themselves a fatigue rating of 3 or 4 (out of a maximum of 4). Of these 3 patients, one had a low IGF-1. We conclude that growth hormone deficiency is uncommon in this group of patients. Deficiencies in the GH axis were not related to hypercholesterolaemia or fatigue in the majority of patients who had these particular long term effects.",

Leone Universit\u00e0 Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore (Rome, I) Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS), acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), and solid neoplasia are frequent and serious complications of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) for lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD). We report the incidence of secondary malignancies arisen after autologous PBSCT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), multiple myeloma (MM) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). From 1988 to 2004 we studied 142 patients (pts) submitted to PBSCT (79 NHL, 31 MM, 26 HD, 6 CLL) in absence of karyotypic abnormalities before transplant and at least 12 months of follow-up not receiving other chemo-radiotherapy in order to assess sMDS without interference of conditioning regimen. The evaluation of sAML and secondary solid neoplasia was done after transplant without any delay. Follow-up was stopped for progression disease (PD) requiring treatment or patient's death. Check-up including morphological studies of bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood, cytogenetic and FISH analysis was performed after 12 months from PBSCT and at least every 12 months of follow-up. 81 pts were male, 61 were female with median age of 44 years (range 17-63). At PBSCT 69 pts were in complete remission (CR), 64 pts in partial remission (PR) and 9 pts in PD. All pts received standard chemotherapy at diagnosis; 53 pts underwent second line chemotherapy, 26 third line or more, 26 pts second line plus rituximab, 7 pts second line plus radiotherapy and 17 pts third line plus PBSCT. Median follow-up was 48 months from PBSCT (range 12-182) for a total of 376 morphologic evaluation, 256 cytogenetic analyses and 46 FISH analysis. We observed one case of sAML with deletion of chromosome 7 occurred 10 months after PBSCT in pt affected by heavily pre-treated NHL (5 lines chemotherapy); he died 2 months later. Another pt with CLL developed sMDS (refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia) with del(20) detected by FISH and cytogetic analysis, at 15 months after PBSCT; he is alive 28 months after sMDS without therapy. Three pts developed secondary solid malignancies (lung, pancreas, colon) at median time of 32 months (range 23-126). In conclusion secondary haematological and extraematological malignancies are serious complications of PBSCT for LPD. A stringent and complete follow-up is requested in order to rapidly detect these complications offering to the pts a chance of treatment.",

Intestinal-derived citrulline, an intermediate in the urea cycle is the primary source of renal production of arginine, a pre-NO substrate. Severity of the mucosal barrier injury of the intestines after myeloablative conditioning for a HSCT can be measured by the concentration of citrulline. Citrulline levels reach a nadir 1-2 weeks after HSCT. However, no data are available about the kinetics of citrulline concentrations in these complex patients. We were interested to know whether the citrulline concentrations vary during the day and therefore sampling time should be adjusted to obtain accurate values. Methods: We selected 5 patients who participated in an antifungal pharmacokinetic study and we collected 11 plasma samples of each patient at day of transplant and 11 samples at HSCT day + 7. Samples were collected via a central venous catheter at 9. 00, 9.15, 9.30, 10 .00, 11.00, 11.30, 12.00, 13.00, 15.00, 17.00 and 21.00 hour and were stored frozen. The citrulline concentration was determined by HPLC. Results: The citrulline concentrations were significantly lower on HSCT day +7 (mean 6.6 \u00b5mol/L) than at day of transplant (mean 10.0 \u00b5mol/L). There is a gradual decline of the concentration, although not significant during the 12-hour sampling period on both days. The mean citrulline concentration decreased from 10.7 \u00b5mol/L to 9.3 \u00b5mol/L at transplant day and from 6.4 \u00b5mol/L to 6.1 \u00b5mol/L 1 week later. The coefficient of variance per patient, was at HSCT day 0; 4.9%, 18,2%, 4.8%, 9.5%, 14,5% and at HSCT day +7; 6.1%, 14.0%, 4.6%, 10.4% and 13.4%. Patients had severe oral mucositis on HSCT 0 and +7 and received continuously total parenteral nutrition. Conclusion: Citrulline is a valuable marker of small intestinal injury after myeloablative treatment and can be determined safe and sound daily at office hours to document this injury.",

Afanasyev Pavlov's State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RUS) Background: The progressively increasing number of longterm survivors after allo-HCST led researchers to focus on the early and late complications of this procedure. Hormones of circulating rennin-angiotensin-aldosteron-system (RAAS) are signs of general pathological processes. Mechanism of hypertrophical and profybrotical effects of hormones RAAS have been indicated in the clinical and experimental investigation many times. Its accelerate the structural remodeling of myocardium, which is the basis of transgression systolic and diastolic function of the heart. Positive effects of blockade RAAS have been proved with the aim of decrease consequences of the neurogumoral activity. The aim: to investigate concentration of rennin and aldosteron in children and adolescents after allo-HSCT as early marker of heart late complication connected with conditioning regimen and previous chemotherapy. Material and methods: We examined 13 patients (pts): 8 boys and 5 girls, with medium age 17.3\u00b11.1 yrs (range 10-23 yrs), suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia-8 pts, acute myeloblastic leukemia-2 pts, chronic myeloblastic leukemia-2 pts, myelodysplastic syndrome-1 pt. The follow-up after transplantation was 4.53\u00b10.44 year (range 2-7 years). Age at the moment of transplantation was 6-17year, median 12.7\u00b10.95 year. As control group-10 healthy people the same age and gender. Concentration of rennin and aldosteron was defined by ratio immunological method. Results: Medium concentration of the rennin was 1.07\u00b10.51 ng/ml/hour and medium concentration of and aldosteron was 104.3\u00b124.7 pg/mg that in general is found in admissible limits for normal meanings but it is higher than in healthy people (normal level of rennin-0.32\u00b10.09 ng/ml/hour, normal level of aldosteron-41.2\u00b112.48 pg/mg). Conclusions: Children after allo-HSCT have elevation of RAAS activity. Because of RAAS activity has potential profybrotical effects this control is very important for early elucidation late heart change and necessity of blockade elevation RAAS.",

Zinke-Cerwenka, M. Eibl, P. Neumeister, H. Sill, W. Linkesch Medical University (Graz, A) Background: The strategy of autologous followed by reducedintensity allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is designed to reduce the tumour burden and to use the graft versus myeloma effect with the advantage of less toxicity. Early transplant related mortality (TRM) could be reduced with this procedure. But the influence of the sequential autologous/nonmyeloablative allogeneic PBSCT on late complications that result from the conditioning regimens, cGVHD and its associated immune-deficiency state is an important point as well. Patients and methods: We report on six patients (5 female, 1 male; ages between 35 and 57 years) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who received single autologous PBSCT with melphalan 200mg/m\u00b2 followed by reduced-intensity allogeneic PBSCT between three to four months later. The allogeneic transplantations were performed between September 2003 and April 2004. Disease status showed PR in 5 patients and CR in 1 patient before the second transplantion. The conditioning regimen consisted of intravenous fludarabine 30mg/m\u00b2 on days -4,-3, and -2 and melphalan 100mg/m\u00b2 on day -1. Five patients received unmanipulated peripheral stem cells from their HLA-identical siblings, one patient from an unrelated donor with c-mismatch. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient with the unrelated donor received additionally antithymocyte globulin (5mg/kg, days -4,-3,-2, and -1). All patients achieved complete donor chimerism by day 28. One patient developed severe acute GVHD (grade IV). One patient died on day +210 in nearly complete remission (only positive immunofixation) because of new developed refractory cardiac arrhythmia. Results: In November 2005 5/6 patients are alive. Three of them achieved a CR. One of them transplanted in September 2003 could return to work. The second patient (11/05)developed pulmonary complications (obliterative bronchiolitis) and a keratoconjunctivitis sicca syndrome. The third patient (4/2004) is affected by an autoimmune hepatitis. Two patients achieved a nearly CR. One of them (March/2004) started to work again one year after transplantation. The other one (11/2003)is suffered from sicca syndrome and a steroid-induced cataract based on the therapy of extenive cGVHD. Conclusions: The remission rates are encouraging. Although the primary goal is to cure the patients the next task is to minimize the incidence of late complications mainly based on cGVHD.",

Salooja Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) The incidence of osteoporosis in very long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation (SCT) is currently unknown. We have evaluated bone density in 17 long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation a minimum of 10 years following transplantation. All the patients received total body irradiation in their conditioning. 17 patients (10 male) were evaluated by history and DEXA scans a median of 16 years (range 10-25) following SCT. All had received total body irradiation, median 12Gy (range 10-13.2Gy). Three patients (one male) had unrelated SCT, two (both male) had syngeneic SCT and the remainder had sibling allografts. The median age at follow up was 44 years (range 35-59). None had a history of bony fracture. Following DEXA scan, 4/10 male patients had osteopenia but none were osteoporotic. 4/10 male patients had increased bone density compared to that expected for healthy aged matched controls. Of the 4 male patients who were osteopenic, possible risk factors for decreased bone density included low testosterone (n=2), long term immunosuppression (n=1). Of the 7 female patients evaluated, all had an underlying diagnosis of CML. The median age at follow up was 49 years (range 42-59). One patient had a history of avascular necrosis of the femoral head secondary to steroids but none had a history of spontaneous fracture. Following DEXA scans 5/7 women were found to be osteopenic. All had been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for a minimum of 10 years following SCT and all had normal thyroid function tests. We conclude that osteopenia may be common in female longterm survivors of SCT despite HRT. In men with osteopenia post SCT hormone deficiencies may be contributory. Allogeneic transplantation increases the risk of developing secondary malignancies. A rare post transplant complication is the development of donor cell leukaemia (DCL). We report a patient with granulocytic sarcoma who developed DCL 3 years after receiving a matched volunteer donor (MVD) allograft. Case Report:33 year old female was diagnosed with granulocytic sarcoma of the small bowel in October 2004 at 17 weeks of gestation. Bone marrow was not involved at diagnosis. She experienced a spontaneous abortion at 20 weeks. She underwent tumour resection and chemotherapy. Because of suspected residual disease and persistent cytopenia, the patient underwent a Cyclophosphamide/CAMPATH/TBI allograft from a male volunteer donor. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on Day 21. She never achieved platelet engraftment. The post transplant period was complicated by persistent thrombocytopenia and a delayed CMV reactivation (retinitis) requiring prolonged periods of antiviral treatment leading to secondary graft failure. She developed limited skin and liver GVHD and immunosuppression was continued in some form for 7 months post transplant. Immunotherapy for CMV retinitis was considered but could not be implemented because of logistical reasons (MVD, identification of CMV peptides). The cytopenia was treated with G-CSF and erythropoietin (EPO) for prolonged periods. In November 2004 her marrow was in remission and CT scan of the abdomen showed no relevant findings. In July 2005 she received Stem Cell Factor (SCF)in addition to G-CSF. In September 2005 she presented with a high peripheral white cell count. Blood and bone marrow sample showed myeloid blasts consistent with the diagnosis of AML. Cytogenetics showed 45XY (male donor) in 200/200 cells with monosomy 7 and 100% donor chimerism. This was confirmed with immunophenotyping, and FISH studies. Male donor cells were also confirmed by FISH. The chimerism analysis by quantificative short tandem repeat (STR) DNA detection persistently revealed 100% donor type of cells. Conclusion: We present a case of de novo DCL in a patient 3 years post MVD transplant. This patient received G-CSF and EPO for prolonged periods and SCF. Binding of SCF can activate the c-kit receptor which is broadly distributed in haematopoietic cells. This can be displayed by neoplastic or precursor cells and can stimulate the proliferation of these cells. Host marrow microenvironment and G-CSF has also been implicated in the development of secondary leukaemia. A. Spyridonidis, P. Faber, P. Fisch, M. Waterhouse, A. Schmitt-Gr\u00e4ff, H. Bertz, J. Finke Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, D) While typically found in cancers, frameshift mutations in microsatellites have also been detected in chronically inflamed tissues. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may potentially produce chronic tissue stress through graftversus-host reactions. Therefore, we examined non-neoplastic epithelial tissues (colon, buccal) obtained 1 to 5061 days after human allogeneic HCT for the presence of genomic alterations at three tetranucleotide (SEE33, THO-1, D14S120) and three mononucleotide (ZP3, BAT26, SRY) microsatellite loci. All except two colon biopsies examined had histological signs of GvHD. No signs of mucositis or oral GvHD were present at the time of buccal sampling. Novel bands indicative of microsatellite instability (MSI) were detected in lasercapture microdissected (LCM) colonic crypts in 12 out of 16 pts (75%) and in buccal smears in 10 out of 24 (42%) allografted pts. In contrast to the allografted pts, no MSI was found in the LCM crypts obtained from 4 pts after intensive chemotherapy or from 7 control subjects, and in the buccal smears obtained from 8 pts after autologous HCT, from 8 pts after chemotherpay or from 9 healthy controls. MSI was found only at tetranucleotide markers but not at mononucleotides. There was no statistical correlation between the presence of MSI in colon and the underlying disease, the previous history of multiple (\u2265 3) intensive chemotherapies before transplantation, the type of preparative regimen for HCT, the overall GVHD grade any time before sampling or the GvHD stage in colon at sampling. The MSI found in colon, which was often affected by graft-versus-host disease, was not due to loss of expression or nitrosylation of DNA repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, APE-1, XPA). There was no significant association between MSI in the buccal mucosa and patient age, gender, disease, type of conditioning, history of oral GvHD or overall GvHD occured at any point before buccal sampling. Interestingly, we found a significant association between the time of buccal sampling after transplantation and the presence of MSI (p=0.008). MSI was also found in three post-transplant squamous cell cancers examined. Our data show that genomic alterations in epithelium regularly occur after allogeneic HCT. This previously unacknowledged genomic instability after allogeneic HCT may be implicated in the evolution of post-transplant diseases, including secondary cancer. S115 Acute leukaemia / Myelodysplasia P531 Stem cell transplantation after arsenic trioxide treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia: comparison with a historic control of transplantation following a combination of all-trans retinoic acid plus intensive chemotherapy X. Thomas (1) Arsenic trioxide (AS2O3) has shown great promise in the treatment of patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). We evaluated the results of stem cell transplantation (SCT) performed after an As2O3-based treatment strategy proposed to French patients with relapsed APL over the last few years and compared retrospectively these results to those of our previous strategy in which SCT followed a combination of ATRA with EMA (etoposide plus mitoxantrone plus cytarabine) timed-sequential chemotherapy (Thomas et al., Leukemia 14:1006 , 2000 . Thirteen consecutive patients (median age, 39 years; range, 16 -50) with relapsed (relapse 1, R1 = 12 of whom 1 in molecular relapse; R3 = 1) APL received either genoidentical allogeneic SCT (4 patients of whom one received a \"mini\" transplant) or unpurged autologous SCT (9 patients) after an AS2O3-based treatment. Initial treatment was AS2O3 (0.15 mg/kg/day) intravenously administered alone (n = 12) or combined with ATRA (n = 1) until CR. Median time to CR was 34 days. CR achievement was followed by at least a second cycle of AS2O3 (range, 1 -5) combined in 2 patients with ATRA plus idarubicin, and in one patient with low-dose cytarabine. Median time from CR to transplant was 3.7 months (range, 2.3 -8.3): 3.3 months for allogeneic SCT and 5.01 months for autologous SCT. All allografted and autografted patients tested were PML-RARa negative on sensitive nested RT-PCR before transplantation. At a median follow-up of 1.07 years, all patients were alive. So far, none of the patients had relapsed. The efficacy and toxicity of SCT after AS2O3-based treatment were compared with our historic control including 11 allografted patients and 22 autografted patients. Results showed a benefit with AS2O3-based regimen in terms of LFS (2-year LFS, 100% vs 54%) and OS (2-year OS, 100% vs 61%), the historic control showing a high mortality associated with the allogeneic SCT procedure. The data from the present study confirm that patients in first or subsequent relapse following ATRA-anthracycline-based therapy will benefit when they are treated with AS2O3 before transplantation. The administration of at least two cycles of AS2O3 prior to SCT appears sufficient for an optimal outcome. These results confirm the recommendations of the European APL Group of Experts (Sanz et al., Haematologica 90:1231 . Fludarabine (Flu) in combination with intravenous Busulfan (Bu) has been used to reduce treatment related mortality (TRM) in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), specially the sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS). Considering that Bu has erratic bioavailability and unpredictable intestinal absorption, previous investigations have used intravenous Bu with plasma-targeted levels dosing. In Brazil neither intravenous Bu nor routine plasma level measurement of Bu are routinely available. We retrospectively analyzed 84 patients (49 AML, 35 CML) submitted to SCT using a Flu and oral Bu based conditioning regimen. AML patients, 35% were in first remission (CR1), 28% in second remission (CR2) and 37% patients had active disease (AD) at the time of transplant. CML patients, 70% were in chronic phase (CML-CP) although with a median age of 45 years, 25% in accelerated phase (CML-AP) and 5% in blast crisis (CML-BC). Conditioning regimen consisted of Flu 30 mg/m 2 and oral Bu 4 mg/kg for 4 days with CsA and Mtx GVHD prophylaxis. All patients engrafted (median 14 days). At a median follow up time of 240 days non-relapse mortality was 8%. Twenty four patients (28%) died (12 AML and 5 CML patients). Major cause of death was relapse of disease in patients transplanted with active disease. SOS occurred in only two patients, one death. Among survivors (60 patients), 59 remain in complete remission. Only three AML patients in CR1 died (chronic GVHD, sepsis and fulminant hepatic failure) in contrast to 60% of patients with active disease (88% relapsed). Two patients with CML-CP died (one with a relapse in CML-BC), the remaining 22 (92%) patients are alive in complete remission. Both patients transplanted in BC died of their disease. Incidence of acute GVHD was 23% (only one grade III). Overall survival for CML is 92% and 54% (CP and AP/BC respectively, p=0,04) and for AML 72% and 23% (CR1/CR2 and AD, respectively, p=0,005). These preliminary data show that oral Busulfan and Fludarabine can safely be used without plasma level monitoring. The follow up time is short and the effect on the control of CML cannot be concluded. However AML has been effectively controlled as far as patients were transplanted in an early phase of the disease (AML-CR1 and CR2). For patients in more advanced disease stages this regimen is not optimal. However, this regimen is safe and may improve the results in early stages of AML and CML even in countries with limited resources in health care.",

Leo, A. Mazzone, V. Liso, G. Specchia Hematology (Bari, I) Engraftment kinetics in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (alloPBSCT) depend on the number and efficiency of the stem cells in the graft, the conditioning regimen and GvHD prophylaxis. Currently, stem cell evaluation is performed by counting CD34+ cells; however, CD34+ cells are a heterogeneous population including the early uncommitted fraction as well as different subsets committed to one or the another lineage; hence, defining the CD34+ subset most predictive of engraftment would be of the utmost importance. This study aimed to identify which graft product subset of CD34+ cells might be the most predictive of early hematopoietic recovery following alloPBSCT. The relationships between the number of \"mature\" subsets of CD34+ cells (CD34+/CD33+, CD34+/CD38+, CD34+/DR+ and CD34+/CD133-) and \"immature\" subsets of CD34+ cells (CD34+/CD33-, CD34+/CD38-, CD34+/DR-and CD34+/CD133+) and early neutrophil and platelet engraftment were studied in a homogeneous series (for disease, pretransplant chemotherapy, conditioning regimen, GvHD prophylaxis) of 22 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients after alloPBSCT from HLA-identical siblings. All patients received the BU-CY regimen; GvHD prophylaxis included cyclosporin and methotrexate. The CD34+ dose infused ranged from 2.9 to 8.8 x 10 6 /Kg (median 4.6); the percentage of immature CD34+ cells was 36% for CD34+/CD33-, 60% for CD34+/CD38-, 5% for CD34+/DR-and 70% for CD34+/CD133+; this translates into a median dose of 1.6 x 10 6 /Kg (0.3-5) for CD34+/CD33-, 2.6 x 10 6 /Kg (0.1-6.2) for CD34+/CD38-, 0.4 x 10 6 /Kg (0.1-2.3) for CD34+/DR-and 0.95 x 10 6 /Kg (0.6-2.3) x 10 6 /Kg for CD34+/CD133+. Median time to achieve engraftment of neutrophils and platelets was 13 days (10-16) and 15 days (13-19), respectively. In our experience the total CD34+/CD133+ cell number was inversely correlated with the days required for recovery of 0.5 x10 9 /L neutrophils (r=-0.76, p<0.05) and 100 x 10 9 /L platelets (r=-0.71, p<0.05); this correlation was similar to total CD34+ cells dose and neutrophil (r=-0.71, p<0.05) and platelets engraftment (r=-0.68, p=0.06). We suggest that a high number of CD34+/CD133+ peripheral blood stem cells may be associated with faster neutrophils and platelets recovery; these findings may help to predict the repopulating capacity of PBSC in patients after allogeneic PBSCT, especially when a relatively low number of CD34+ cells is infused.",

Russell Nottingham City Hospital (Nottingham, UK) Between September 1996 and May 2005 we undertook 51 VUD transplants for AML at Nottingham City Hospital. The median follow up of the 21 surviving patients is now 5.45 years (0.5-9.2 years). Conditioning was with TBI 14.4 Gy and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/Kg x 2). Campath 1G or 1H (Alemtuzumab), 10 mg/day was given on days -5 to -1 to prevent rejection and reduce GVHD. GVHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporin A and methotrexate (days +1, +3 and +6). 33 patients received bone marrow (BM) and 18 PBSC. The median CD34+ cell dose was 3.35 x 106/kg (1.03 -18.6 x 106/kg). 35 patients received a fully HLA matched transplant, 13 a 1 antigen-and 3 a 2 antigen-mismatched transplant. The median age was 36.7 years (16.4 to 57.8). 14/51 patients were not in CR at the time of transplant. 47/48 evaluable patients had sustained haemopoietic recovery. One patient did not achieve platelet recovery due to the presence of HPA antibodies against donor platelets. The median times to engraftment of neutrophils to 0.5 x 109/L and platelets to 20 x 109/L were 14 (10-26) and 15 (11 to 40) days respectively. 17/51 (33%) patients developed acute GVHD, but only 1 case was grade IV, all others being grades I/II. 11/44 (25%) evaluable patients developed chronic GVHD but only 2 cases were extensive. Predicted 5 year OS and EFS were both 39%. Patients who were not in CR at the time of transplant had a predicted 5-year OS of 7% compared to 52% for those in CR (p<0.00001). 15 patients died of TRM between 2 days and 1.5 years post transplant. The predicted 5-year TRM was 34%. The predicted risk of relapse at 5 years was 34% for those in CR at the time of transplant and 85% for those not in CR (p<0.00001). The development of acute GVHD did not affect the probability of relapse. The development of chronic GVHD protected against relapse (p=0.04). Patients with adverse risk cytogenetics at presentation were significantly more likely to relapse post transplant with predicted relapse rates at 5 years of 0% for good risk cytogenetic groups, 36% for intermediate risk groups and over 70% for poor risk groups (p=0.03). We conclude that myeloablative transplantation is an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia provided disease remission is achieved prior to transplantation. Cytogenetic risk group has a significant impact on the risk of relapse post transplant. The addition of Campath 1G/1H is highly effective in preventing both rejection and severe acute and extensive chronic GVHD in this setting.",

Dammann, M. Eder, A. R. Boerner, A. Franzke, M. Stadler, A. Ganser, W. Knapp, B. Hertenstein Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) The application of radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies in the conditioning for stem cell transplantation may enhance the antineoplastic activity without increasing the toxicity of the procedure. We treated 21 patients (median age 48; 21-62) with high risk AML with a Rhenium-188 labelled anti-CD 66 antibody in addition to conventional or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). AML was classified as high risk based on response to induction treatment or cytogenetic abnormalities (n=8) or disease stage (2.CR: 5, refractory: 8). The conventional conditioning regimen consisted of Busulfan (4x4mg/kg) and Cyclophosphamide (2x60mg/kg) (n=11), for RIC Fludarabine and Busulfan (2x4mg/kg) or Melphalan (140mg/m2) was used. Bone marrow (n=2) or PBPC (n=19) were obtained from matched related (n=5) or unrelated (n=16) donors. Grafts were not manipulated and GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA and either MTX (n=17) or MMF (n=4). The anti-CD-66 antibody antigranulocyte (Scintec, Switzerland) was labelled with the beta emitting isotope Rhenium-188. Rhenium-188 was obtained as Perrhenat from a 188W-188Re-generator. The radiochemical purity of the radioimmunoconjugate was 92 %. For treatment an activity of 10.5 (6.4-11.2) GBq was given. The dose to the bone marrow was 11.2 Gy (4.95-18.5), to the spleen 15.1 Gy (7.27-40.9 ), to the liver 3.6 Gy (3.9-11.5) and to the kidney 6.7 Gy (3.9-12-2). There were no acute side effects associated with the antibody application. 20/21 patients engrafted. Acute GvHD occurred in 8 patients (I-II: 7 35%; III-IV 1 5%), cGvHD was seen in 11 patients (52%). 3 patients showed a significant rise of creatinine, but in all three patients other drug toxicity was the most probable cause. 3 patients developed VOD. The overall treatment associated mortality was 6/21 (29%). Relapse was seen in 6 patients. 3/13 patients transplanted in remission and 3/8 patients transplanted in refractory disease relapsed. All 3 patients transplanted in refractory disease with a RIC regimen relapsed. With a median follow up of 41 month (30-48) 9 patients (43%) are alive in remission. Our data demonstrate that radioimmunotherapy can safely be given in addition to a conventional or reduced intensity chemotherapy based conditioning regimen. In combination with conventional conditioning radioimmunotherapy showed sufficient antileukemic activity in patients in CR and relapse whereas only patients in CR seem suitable for radioimmunotherapy combined with reduced conditioning. Relapse is the major cause of treatment failure following an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Most relapses occur in the bone marrow (BM), however, isolated extramedullary (EM) relapses occur. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of myeloid EM relapses and their outcome. Eleven patients with local relapses of AML (8), CML (2) or MDS-AML (1) were documented in patients transplanted from 1977-2005 at the Karolinska University Hospital/Huddinge. The incidence was 3.5% among 255 patients with AML and 0.9% of 225 with CML. The median age of the patients was 15.1 ys (1.1-52.2). Eight patients had advanced leukemias at the time of transplant (not in CR; CR2; blast crisis). Six patients had received grafts from sibling donors (54.5%) and five from unrelated donors (45.4%). The incidence among patients receiving grafts from sibling donors was 2.1% (6/290) and 2.6% (5/190) among patients receiving unrelated grafts. All patients had received myeloablative conditioning. Six patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide + TBI and five with busulphan + cyclophosphamide. Seven of 11 had developed a chronic GVHD at the time of EM relapse. The median time from SCT to EM relapse was 15.5 months (5.2-116). The localizations of the EM relapses were in the skeleton (3), breast (3), lymph glands (2), adrenal gland (1), perirenally (1) and in the mediastinum (1) . Bone marrow (BM) relapse occurring after EM relapse developed in 7 of 11 patients. The median time between EM and subsequent BM relapses was 2 months (range 5 days -8.6 years). Different treatment protocols were used. Six patients received local radiotherapy; in 4 combined with chemotherapy and in one with DLI. Three patients received chemotherapy only and two patients had surgical resections followed by treatment with either chemotherapy or isotretinoin. Three of 11 patients are alive at 5, 23 and 143 months after the EM relapse, respectively. The survival after diagnosis of EM relapse of the 8 deceased patients ranged from 0.6 to 106 months. Conclusions: EM relapses are rare in patients undergoing allogeneic SCT for myeloid malignancies but seem to be more common in patients transplanted for advanced disease. The rate of subsequent BM relapse was high and the survival was poor. No optimal treatment could be identified. The prognosis of sAML after MDS in patients aged 60 years or more is dismal. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, due to the high treatment related mortality allo-SCT is not frequently offered to this patient group. This report summarizes our cumulative experience in a cohort of 14 consecutive elderly patients (age 60-66, median 62 years) with sAML after MDS treated with different toxicity-reduced conditioning regimens followed by allo-SCT. The patients had a median comorbidity index of 2 (range 0-5). All patients received mobilized peripheral blood stem cells as graft and 5 patients had a sibling and 9 an unrelated donor (MUD), respectively. In the majority of patients the disease was uncontrolled and only 1 patient was in CR1 and two patients in CR2 at the time of transplant and 7 patients had an unfavourable karyotype. For this patient cohort the conditioning regimens applied were all myeloablative as evidenced by full donor chimerism at day +30 in all patients. The time to recovery of absolute neutrophil count \u2265 0.5 x 10 9 /l was 10-24 days (median 15 days). Despite the high relapse risk in the majority of patients we observed only 3 deaths because of recurrent leukemia. Severe acute GVHD (grade 3 and 4) occurred in 29% of patients surviving beyond day +30 and the non relapse mortality was 24% with 2 patients dying from GVHD and one patient dying from cardiac failure. With a median follow-up of 15 months (range 3 -67m) for surviving patients the Kaplan-Meyer procedure estimates a 45% probability of survival at 3 y after transplantation. Interestingly, there is no difference what so ever in survival if patients were in remission or not at the time of transplant. However, patients having more than two prior chemotherapy cycles had only a 22% probability of survival as compared to 60% in patients with a maximum of 2 prior chemotherapy cycles. No difference was observed with respect to family or unrelated donors. Our data support the notion that toxicityreduced conditioning followed by allo-SCT can safely be applied and has excellent anti-leukemic efficacy in elderly patients with sAML. However, the transplant should not be delayed by multiple chemotherapeutic efforts to achieve a complete remission.",

Ghavamzadeh Tehran University Medical Sciences (Tehran,IR) Introduction: The finding that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) induces apoptosis in APL cells, including APL cell that are resistant to RA, has generated a wave of excitement in both the laboratory and the clinic. Following these promising results especially in relapsed patients, the role of this agent is being presently investigated as front-line therapy for newly diagnosed patients. WT1 gene encodes a transcription factor which is involved in differentiation and proliferation of Hemtopoeitic precursor cells as well as some other tissues like kidney, ovary, heart etc. It is also expressed in 80% of Acute Leukemia cases It is proposed to be a useful marker in minimal residual disease (MRD) detection and leukemia management. Methods: To assess the relevance of this gene, sequential peripheral blood samples from 60 APL who have been treated with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) were analyzed for the expression level of WT1 mRNA, using Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR. Samples from patients were obtained at the time of diagnosis, during treatment (follow-up), in complete remission (CR), before relapse and relapse. Results: Samples of diagnosis and relapse showed significantly higher WT1 expression levels (90%), compared to samples from patients in CR or healthy volunteers. Our study revealed that rising of WT1 expression predicts a forthcoming relapse 1-6 months before overt clinical relapse. A linear correlation between quantities of WT1 and PML-RARa fusion transcripts could be seen in APL patients treated with arsenic trioxide. Conclusion: There was a strong correlation between WT1 and specific fusion gene (PML-RARa) expression in APL patients, showing the significant potential of WT1 as a non-specific leukemia marker (NSLM) for monitoring of MRD and treatment approaches in APL.",

Czyz (1) The allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a potentially curative treatment option for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. However, relapse still remains the main cause of treatment failure. We evaluated long-term outcome of alloSCT in 45 pts, median age 25 (15-55) years, with standard (9), high (29) or very high risk (7) ALL treated between January 1997 and December 2005 from three centers in Poland. The disease status before alloSCT was: CR1-36 pts, CR2-6 pts, NR-3 pts. Different conditioning regimens were used: TBI/Cy in 23 pts, BuCy2 in 20 pts and RIC with fludarabine plus melphalan in 2 pts. The patients received infusion of filgastrim-mobilized PBSC (9 pts), bone marrow cells (36 pts) with a median of 5,6 x106 CD34+ cell/kg from HLA-matched sibling (41 pts) or unrelated HLAmatched donor (5 pts). CSA and a short course of MTX were given as GVHD prophylaxis and in 5 patients ATG was added. The incidence of acute GvHD grade III-IV was 21% (10/44 pts). Chronic GvHD occurred in 23/38 (61%) pts surviving day 100, extensive in 10 cases. With a median follow-up of 35 (1-127) months 19/45 pts died, 5 in first 100 days after alloSCT (relapse-2, VOD-2, infection-1) and 14 after 100 days (relapse-11, GVHD-2, infection-1). OS and DFS was 48% (95% CI 32-66) and 48% (95% CI 32-65) at 5 years estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The cumulative incidence of relapse and NRM were 37% (95% CI 24-57) and 14% (95% CI 7-30) respectively. Factors predicting negative outcome by Cox univariate analysis for all 45 patients were: Karnovsky score below 90 (p=0.0026, HR=2.53, 95%CI=1.38-4.65), Phpositivity (p=0.0062, HR=2.04, 95%CI=1.21-3.33), response to induction therapy (p=0.0154, HR=1.81, 95%CI=1.12-3.03), and risk group (p=0.0372, with HR=1.28 for HRG and HR=2.12 for VHRG). Factor predicting negative outcome by Cox multivariate analysis was Karnovsky score below 90 (p=0.0143, HR=4.53, 95%CI=1.35-15.2). Estimated 5-yrs OS, DFS (Kaplan-Meier method), cumulative incidence of relapse and NRM with respect to Ph status are shown in Table. Conclusions: Our findings on a limited number of pts confirmed that alloSCT may offer a sustained remission with acceptable NRM in high proportion of patients with Ph negative ALL. Ph positive ALL remains a very aggressive disease with high incidence of relapse despite alloSCT. It suggests that new pretransplant-or postransplant-treatment strategy should be studied in prospective clinical trials.",

The present study evaluated the role of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes and HLA-C genes in 37 acute lymphoblastic leukemic patients and 36 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by PCR-SSP using Pelfreze for KIRs and Genovision for HLA-C genes. In this study; 21 male, 16 female in total 37 ALL patients with a mean age of 13 and 19 male, 15 female in total 36 healthy controls with a mean age of 16 were investigated. We observed a significantly higher frequency (P=0.05) of the inhibitory KIR2DL2 in the ALL patient group compared to the controls. On the other hand KIR3DL2 was found significantly higher (P=0.02) in the control group.We believe further investigation on the polymorphisms of NKR genes, their HLA ligands and the expression of HLA class I molecules on leukemic cells are crucial to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of the possible NK cell dysfunction in leukemia but larger groups of studies must be done in future.",

Such treatment, mieloablative and immunosuppressive, he favours the engraftment of the marrow in the allogeneic transplant, not clear the advantage in the autologous transplant. In the last years, new conditioning regimes to more intense mieloablation has been used in AML autotransplant patients. We have retrospectively evaluated, in terms of efficacy and results, the classical conditioning BuCy-2 with a conditioning with busulfan (4mg/Kg days -5 -3) and melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2 day -2) (BuMel). From June 2001 to June 2005 we have autotransplantated 27 patients with AML in first CR (9 males and 18 females; median age: 47 years (range 14-61) subtype FAB: M0: 2; M1: 5; M2: 8; M4: 11; M5: 1). 11 patients have been conditioned with BuMel (3 M and 8 F; median age: 49 years (range 18-61) subtype FAB M1: 3; M2: 4; M4: 4; M5; 1) and 16 with BuCy-2 (6 M and 10 F; median age: 41 years (range 14-59) subtype FAB M0: 2; M1: 2; M2: 4; M4: 8). The factors of risk in the 2 groups are similar. High risk: 4 patients (2 in every group), intermediate risk: 19 (12 in BuCy-2 and 7 in BuMel) and low risk: 4 (2 in every group). The PBSC has been the source of the stem cells in all patients, and the median CD34 infused cells has been of 5,15 and 5,65 x 106/Kg in BuCy-2 and BuMel groups respectively. All patients have achieved a full haematological recovery. The median days to neutrophil> 1000/mm\u00b3 and platelets> 20000/mm\u00b3 have been of 14 and 12 days in the BuCy-2 and BuMel groups respectively. In the BuMel group one patient is died for mycosis (mucor) at day +27 after transplantation. With median follow-up of 13 months, after autotransplant, 9 patients (80%) they are alive (8 in CR) in BuMel group; in the BuCy-2 group the median DFS and OS are 8 and 11 months respectively (graph 1-2). The EFS projected to 25 months is 65% and 40% (graph 3) in BuMel and BuCy-2 groups respectively, this difference is not statistically significant (p: 0.02, Cox F-test). In conclusion it is evident the advantage of a conditioning regime more mieloablative, in AML autotranpsplant patients, such difference statistically is not significant for the short follow-up and low number of patients. Is necessary a large cohort and a randomized study to confirm these preliminary data. Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) with a t(4;11) is a very rare disease in adults with a poor prognosis when conventionally treated. Aggressive treatment including allogeneic stem cell transplantation may contribute to improve the survival. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may be a valid alternative in patients lacking an histocompatible donor, especially when a complete molecular remission (CMR) has been obtained . Two adult pro B-ALL patients (age 28 and 24 years) with t(4;11) were autotransplanted in our Institution in first CMR. At the onset of the disease the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed the presence of the ALL1-AF4 fusion transcript and the quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) detected 42360 and 7324 ALL1-AF4/ABLx104 copies respectively. Both patients achieved CMR after induction therapy with high dose anthracycline, vincristine and prednisone. As consolidation therapy they received high-dose cytarabine and mithoxantrone followed by G-CSF administration to collect peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC). The RT-PCR and the Q-RT-PCR were performed on PBSC collected and on bone marrow at the time on CD34+ cells collection, showing a negative qualitative and quantitative PCR status. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan 4 mg/kg for 4 days and etoposide 20 mg/kg for 3 days. Molecular analysis (RT and Q-RT-PCR) performed one month after transplant, confirmed the CMR status in both patients. After complete haematological recovery the patients were submitted to conventional maintenance therapy and monthly therapeutic rachicenteses for one year. Molecular monitoring during maintenance therapy (every 3 months) showed a negativity of qualitative RT-PCR in both patients, while a fluctuation between 14 and 0 ALL1-AF4/ABLx104 copies in one case and 11 and 0 copies in the other was detected with Q-RT-PCR. At this time both patients are alive in CMR after 36 and 47 months from ASCT with a complete negativity of Q-RT-PCR. Our data suggest that ASCT, when performed in CMR, can be a feasible and curative approach in this very high risk category of patients.",

Marianska Institute of Hematology (Warsaw, PL) Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was diagnosed in 34year old man in August 2001.The remission induction, consolidation and maintenance therapies were given according to GIMEMA protocol.In October 2002 he experienced hematological and cytogenetic relapses.Arsenic was started.The hyperleucocytosis with differentiation features, fever, dyspnea, hepatic impairment, retention of fluids, hypotension, pericardial and pleural exudates were reported as a components of APL differentation syndrome.The pleural fluid examinations did not revealed leukemic cells.All described symptoms resolved but complete hematological and cytogenetic remissions were not achieved.The therapy was continued combining ATRA with next three lines of chemotherapy. In the end the second complete hematological and cytogenetic but no molecular remissions were obtained.The promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alfa (PML/RARa) rearranged gene was detected by RT-PCR assay with detection threshold of 10-2.The patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) from his HLA identical sister in October 2003.The limited chronic graft vs. host disease (GvHD) developed 6 months after transplantation and the patient was placed on effective therapy with cyclosporine A and steroids for two months. Nested RT-PCR assay (10-3/10 -4) was positive for PML/RARa over all the time after transplantation but short tandem repeat PCR used to evaluate chimerism showed 100% of donor profile.Due to out-patient observation after transplantation he was in good clinical condition until July 2005. Twenty one months after transplantation the symptoms of congestive heart failure arose due to the third degree of atrioventricular block, pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions and intracardiac masses located in the ventricles.The recurrence in bone marrow was excluded. However PML/RARa determined by RT-PCR assay was found to be positive for the first time after transplantation.The result of examination of pleural and pericardial biopsy specimens confirmed the APL infiltrations.He died of severe cardiogenic shock resulted directly from disintegration of cardiac muscle due to chemotherapy in September 2005. The monitoring of PML/RARa after alloBMT has predictive value for extra-(EM) or medullary relapses.The antileukemic activity results from GvHD which trigger a GvLeukemia effect but it seems that the strongest effect occur in bone marrow excluding EM sites.",

Cetin Erciyes University (Kayseri, TR) Background: Busulfan (Bu) is commonly used as a component of conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Intravenous (IV) Bu gives more predictable exposure than the oral form. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the findings of 19 patients with hematologic malignancies were treated with a IV Bu-cyclophosphamide (IV BuCy2) regimen consisting of IV Bu (0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours on days -8 to -5) followed by cyclophosphamide (Cy) (60 mg/kg on days -4 to -3) at our institution between January 2003 and November 2005. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells and underwent allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors. Cyclosporine and short-term methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Results: Median age of the patients was 23 years (range 15-53 years); 12 were males and 7 were females. Seven patients had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 8 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 1 had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and 1 had myelofibrosis. Median time between the diagnosis and transplantation was 9 months (range, 2-48 months). Median time to neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count, >0.5 x 109/L) and platelet engraftment (platelet count, >20 x 109/L) were 13 days (range 10-20 days) and 14 days (range, 14-102 days), respectively. Engraftment failure and aplastic death occurred in one patient (5.2%). Most common toxicity was mucositis in early engraftment period and grade 3-4 mucositis occurred in 16/19 patients (90%). Severe acute GVHD (Grade II-IV) developed in 53% of the patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 56% of the patients who survived at least 100 days after transplant. Fatal venoocclusive disease occurred in one patient and treatmentrelated mortality at 100 days was 10.5% (2/19). Conclusion: The IV BuCy2 was a moderately well tolerated regimen and major complications were mucositis and GVHD.",

We report on a 16 years old boy with BCR/ABL positive high risk T-ALL who developed decreasing chimerism and subsequent reappearence of bcr/abl after matched unrelated SCT in first complete remission. Conditioning was carried out with etoposide and TBI. The patient developed acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) grade I on day +40, which subsided without further treatment. On day +133, MC was first detected in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) and reappearance of bcr/abl in BM was demonstrated by RT-PCR. Pre-emptive immunotherapy with increasing doses of donor lymphocytes (DLI) was initiated on day +160 starting with 5x105/kg body weight CD3 positive cells to prevent relapse. However, chimerism decreased to 80-70% in BM on day +210. The patient did not develop any signs of GvHD. After 6 DLIs on monthly intervals with cell dosages of up to 2,8x107 cells/kg no change in chimerism was observed.

Ten days after the onset of IFN-alpha therapy the patient developed acute GvHD grade II (skin involvement only). Due to side effects (mucositis, fatigue, low grade fever) the IFNalpha dose had to be reduced to three times/week. Four weeks after the initiation of IFN-alpha and only one additional DLI complete chimerism could be induced in blood and marrow and bcr/abl was no longer detectable in the bone marrow using RT-PCR. Interferon-alpha therapy was discontinued after two negative results for bcr/abl RT-PCR four weeks apart and two demonstrations of complete chimerism in the bone marrow.

Milone, B. Farsaci, S. Leotta, S. Mercurio, M. Poidomani, P. Murgano, V. Pinto, A. Tornello, R. Giustolisi Ospedale Ferrarotto (Catania, I) Mobilization of an high number of CD34+ cells in P.B. has been associated in patients affected by AML in 1st CR to a poor prognosis (Keating et al 2003 , Feller et al 2003 . A different pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs or an intrinsic chemoresistence of bone marrow precursors are hypothesized as possible explanations for these findings. With this background we started a study aimed to assess in a group of AML the in vitro chemosensitivity of non leukemic CFU-GM to maphosphamide and to correlate the in vitro sensitivity to maphosphamide to CD34+ mobilization strength. So far 10 patients have been studied, all were treated using a same chemotherapeutic regimen; bone marrow cells sensitivity to maphosphamide was determined in CFU-GM grown from bone marrow obtained in 1st CR after administration of induction and consolidation course. In normal subject at maphosphamide concentration of 50 mcg/ml, residual CFU-GM was 44% , 4/10 AML patients had a increased sensitivity to maphosphamide with a mean residual CFU-GM of 2% (P=0.0006 respect to controls). 2/10 AML patients had a decreased sensitivity with a mean residual CFU-GM of 82 % (P=0.01) and 5/10 patients had a mean residual CFU-GM of 33%, not different from controls ( P=0.2). Between residual CFU-GM and peak of CD34+ cells in P.B. during mobilization there was a significant correlation (r=0.686, P=0.02).Patients were then divided in two groups on the basis of peak of CD34+ reached in P.B. The \"Low Mobilizing\" group had at maphosphamide concentration of 50 mcg/ml a number of residual CFU-GM significantly lower than that measured in \"Good Mobilizing\" group (13%, versus 54% P=0.01). The Poor Mobilizing group had, at recovery after consolidation course, a lower number of WBC and PLT in respect to good Mobilizing group. In patients who underwent bone marrow harvest before ABMT, harvested CD34+ cells/Kg were lower in \"Poor Mobilizing\" group in respect to group of patients showing \"Good mobilization\" (3.3 x10 6 /Kg versus 6.2 x10 6 /Kg , P=0.09).We have found that in vitro sensitivity of normal non leukemic CFU-GM to maphosphamide is correlated to CD34+ cells mobilization and to bone marrow function and we therefore retain that in AML patients showing hypersensitivity to chemotherapy this abnormality may be the explanation for severe mielotoxicity after chemotherapy and in turn for a poor CD34 mobilization.",

Bornh\u00e4user, T. Illmer, U. Platzbecker, R. Ordemann, J. Schetelig, M. Schaich, A. Kiani, U. Schuler, G. Ehninger University of Dresden (Dresden, D) Objectives: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) has been associated with an increased risk of liver sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)when applied early after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for relapse of CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, excess of liver toxicity has been observed when GO was used directly before conventional intensive preparative regimens. We hypothesized that GO might be safe and effective as part of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen containing fludarabine and total-body irradiation (TBI). Patients and Methods: 19 patients relapsing after conventional induction chemotherapy (n=11) or after previous transplantation (autologous n=3; allogeneic n=5) have been included in a prospective phase I/II trial. The preparative regimen contains 6 mg/sqm and 3 mg/sqm GO on day -21 and day -14 followed by fludarabine 120 mg/sqm, 200 or 800 cGy TBI (depending on age and pretreatment) and stem cell infusion during GO-induced aplasia. Two patients with refractory disease after GO did not proceed to conditioning therapy and went off study. Ten out of 19 patients had a reduction of blast counts in a bone marrow aspirate performed before conditioning therapy. In seven cases without response to GO, an additional salvage regimen was included before conditioning therapy and transplantation. Seventeen patients received G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells from matched-sibling (n=4) or unrelated donors (n=13). Results: Primary engraftment was observed in all cases. With a median follow-up of 21 months (range 6-55) no case of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or related delayed liver toxicity was documented. Grade II-IV acute GvHD occurred in eight patients (47%). Seven patients are alive in complete remission. Reasons for death in the other patients were relapse/progression (n=5) and GvHD/Infection (n=4). The probability of overall and disease-free survival at two years is 51% and 46%, respectively. Conclusion: These data suggest that GO can be combined with a TBI-containing, fludarabine-based conditioning regimen before allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed AML.",

Khodabandeh, R. Hosseini, F. Ferdosi Hematology, Oncology Research Center (Tehran, IR) Introduction: Arsenic Trioxide is effective and approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory APL cases resistant to ATRA. Also hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been used for APL patients after first complete remission or after relapse. The actual role of HSCT in Arsenic era is not clear now. Materials and methods: We studied 111 patients with APL treated by ATO and 31 patients who transplanted. Arsenic Trioxide infused at 0.15mg/kg daily doses, until complete remission. Then, after 28 days rest, Arsenic Trioxide infused daily for 28 days as consolidation therapy. We studied minimal residual disease (MRD) by semi-sensitive RT-PCR on peripheral blood samples. Transplantation have been done as autologous (12 cases) or allogeneic (19 cases) type. Most of the cases (80.65%) of HSCT arm selected from new cases after first complete remission. Median age at transplantation was 21 years old and 27 for Arsenic arm. Results: Complete remission observed in 95 patients in Arsenic arm (85.6%). With the median follow-up period of 16.5(1-57) months in this group ,one and two year disease free survival (DFS) was 88.3% and 63.7%respectively,24 patients relapsed; 19 of them achieved second complete remission, again by Arsenic Trioxide. Third and fourth remissions were seen in some relapsed patients, again by Arsenic Trioxide. For patients in complete remission, one and three year survival was 95.5% and 87.6% respectively. Also with a median follow up of 25 months 3 years OS was about 70% and DFS about 62.6%. DFS and OS in allogeneic arm were 82% and 85% respectively. DFS and OS for autologous patiets were 40% and 52% respectively. Conclusion: Arsenic Trioxide is effective as first line treatment for APL. its results are comparable to HSCT in new cases. We can reserve BMT(allogeneic or autologous) for second relapse after Arsenic Trioxide or for patients who have persistant PML-RARA after optimal Arsenic Trioxide treatment.",

Ghavamzadeh Tehran University Medical Sciences (Tehran,IR) Introduction: The telomeric DNA together with its associated proteins protects the chromosome ends from degradation or aberrant recombination. The length of telomere in cancer cells depends on a balance between the telomere shortening at each cell cycle and the telomere elongation resulting from telomerase activity. In leukemias and in some solid tumors, a correlation between decreasing telomere length and an increasing severity of disease has been described. Telomere reduction was previously demonstrated in acute and chronic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation t(15;17) that form a PML-RAR\u00e1 fusion gene. Arsenic trioxide (As2o3) is able to induce complete remission in t(15;17)-positive APLs. Arsenic trioxide treatment promotes telomere shortening and apoptosis. Methods: 300 peripheral blood samples were taken from 30 APL patients before, during and after therapy with Arsenic Trioxide. Leukemic blasts were isolated by ficoll-gradient, and then genomic DNA extracted by salting out protocol from those samples, and NB4 cells. Genomic DNA was digested with Rsa1 and Hinf1 restriction enzymes; electrophoresis was performed in 0.8% agarose gels. Finally telomere length was determined by southern analysis. Results: We studied telomeric DNA in APL leukemic cells from patients as well as NB4 cell line as a human APL model. Marked differences were observed in the sizes of the telomeric repeats in the normal blood cells and APL leukemic cells. The leukemic cells of 30 patients with APL showed a variable reduction in the length of telomeric DNA, ranging from 2.0 to 7.0 kb, while the telomere length in PB mononuclear cells obtained from the same patients during complete remission was 9.0 to 10 kb. Conclusion: Arsenic therapy leads to telomere shortening, growth arrest, and leukemic cell death (by apoptosis). Longer telomeres were found in APL patients after induction by arseninc treatment compared with those found in diagnostic specimens. Most likely this was due to the loss of the leukemic clone (with shorter telomeres) and the emergence of normal hematopoietic cells (with longer telomeres) after induction therapy. These data indicate that telomere length shortening in APL patient treated with arsenic can be used as a marker to monitor disease condition and response to therapy.",

Methods: The material -bone marrow from 28 children with initially diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The quantities of proteins of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk2 and cdk4) and cyclins (cyclin D, cyclin E) were studied by Western blotting. The rate of proliferating cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, using nuclear cell proliferation-associated antigen Ki67. The sensitivity of leukemic cells to chemotherapy was studied in MTT-assay. Results: The cyclin D expression was not observed in 4 out of 18 cases of initial B-ALL and in 3 out of 10 cases of initial T-ALL; the cyclin E expression was not visualized in 1/10 cases of initial T-ALL; the level of cdk2 expression was not observed in 1/10 cases of initial B-ALL; the level of cdk4 expression was not visualized in 1/17 cases of initial T-ALL. The levels of expression of cyclins D,E, cdk2 and cdk4 were higher in initial B-ALL in comparison with T-ALL. There were no differences in the rates of Ki67-positive cells between T-ALL and B-ALL. The rates of Ki67 positive cells in relapse were 1.9-fold higher than in initial ALL. Positive correlation was observed between: cyclins (D and E); cyclin E and cdk2, cdk4; cyclin D and cdk2, cdk4; cdk2 and cdk4. Negative correlation was observed between: Ki67 and cyclins (D and E), cdk2, cdk4. The probability of 3-year disease-free survival in patients with high levels of cyclin D, cyclin E, cdk2 and cdk4 was 98% versus 80%, 81%, 85% and 82% in patients with low levels of these proteins. There were no any correlation between the levels of cyclin D, E, cdk2 and cdk4 in leukemic cells and their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Conclusion: Expression rates of cyclin D, cyclin E, cdk2 and cdk4 have clinical and prognostic significance in childhood leukemia. The initial high levels of cyclin D, cyclin E, cdk2 and cdk4 in leukemic cells are associated with good prognosis of 3 years disease-free survival.",

Hellmann Medical University School of Gdansk (Gdansk, PL) AutoHSCT has been largely used to prevent relapse in patients with AML, who achieved complete remission after induction therapy. It remains the best therapy for the control of AML in adult patients. The aim of this study was to assess the results of mobilization of progenitor cells in patients with AML and the clinical outcome in patients with low mobilizing capacity. Materials and methods: Patients were treated according to 3+7 or 3+7+Cladribine protocols. Progenitor cell collection was conducted following the 2nd consolidation cycle. Mobilization was conducted in 49 patients in CR1. AutoHSCT was conducted in 35 patients, 17 females and 18 males. The average age was 40 (16-61). PB was a source of progenitor cells. In 12 cases it was not possible to obtain an adequate number of cells for transplantation (<2x106/kg CD34+). The potential influence of recognized prognostic factors (age, WBC, cytogenetics), the number of cells in mobilized material, on the risk of a relapse, was assessed. Results: 33 of 35 patients transplanted achieved recovery. 30 patients obtained CR and 5 early deaths were recorded. 14 patients relapsed (46.7%). In 14 cases, an inadequate number S123 of cells for autoHSCT was obtained (29,8%). 12 patients (64,3%) are in CR. Within that group, an alloHSCT was conducted only in 3 cases. A relapse occurred in 3 patients. Initial WBC, age, immunophenotype and morphological subtype had been shown to have no influence on mobilization capacity and the risk of relapse. Cytogenetics was conducted only in 50% of the cases for the reason that the influence of this factor on the mobilization and the risk of relapse had not been assessed. Neither the number of CD34+, MNC, CFU-GM cells affected the risk of relapse. However it is likely, having compared a group of patients who did not undergo transplantation with a group of patients who underwent transplantation, that the low number of CD34+ cells is a factor positively affecting the duration of CR. Conclusions: AutoHSCT results obtained are comparable to those achieved in other centres (3ys LFS of 50%). We have found a high percentage of \"poor mobilizers\". The lack or poor mobilization of progenitor cells has not been shown to be a negative prognostic factor in patients with AML, as regards clinical outcome. New prognostic factors, that would allow the isolation of a group of patients with AML, for whom autoHSCT would be the therapy of choice, should be investigated. Introduction: Telomerase the patching up enzyme that extends shortened telomeric repeats of chromosomal ends is differentially expressed in cancer cells and in normal cells. Telomerase is activated in more than 85% of malignant tumors; therefore it might be as an important target for cancer therapy strategies. Telomerase inactivation is considered as a key reason of apoptotic and anticancer effects of As2O3 in Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. To investigate anti telomerase effect of As2O3, we evaluated APL patients and NB4 cell line as a model of APL pre-and post-As2O3 treatment. Methods: Arsenic was used with dosage of 0.15mg/kg/day as a routine treatment for APL patients at shariati hospital. Sequential peripheral blood samples were collected pre-and post-As2O3 treatment from 25 patients. The human NB4 cell line was cultured in presence of different concentration of As2O3 M). Telomerase activity was assayed using \u00b5 (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 2.0 TRAP-ELISA procedure and gel electrophoresis in both APL patient and NB4 samples. Results and conclusion: Establishment of quantitative assays for telomerase activity in APL patients had shown more than 80% elevated levels of telomerase activity in comparison with normal individuals and decreased after remission to normal level. Telomerase activity was shown down regulating in NB4 cell line after 24-48h as a result of As2O3 therapy. Decreasing in telomerase activity in time was intensively correlated with increasing in As2O3 treatment doses in NB4 model. These data indicate that telomerase can be a potent target for cancer therapy in APL treatment with As2O3 and to monitoring disease condition. Background: PRAME (Preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma), highly expressed in various solid tumor cells and normal testis, was first isolated as a human melanoma antigen recognized by cytotoxic T cells (CTL). This gene was also expressed in some hematological malignancies, including acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma. Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate PRAME expression levels in children with acute leukemia using quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Patients -Methods: A total of twenty-five children were enrolled to the study. Seventeen bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (12 ALL, 5 AML) were studied. Normal bone marrow from 8 children with non malignant hematological diseases and solid tumors without bone marrow infiltration was used as control. Results: Overexpression of PRAME was found in 52.9% (3 AML, 6 ALL) of our patients. Five out of 9 children with positive PRAME expression, as well as three out of 8 with no PRAME positivity, were patients with high risk leukemia. Therefore no important correlation between PRAME expression and leukemia characteristics, response to therapy or outcome was observed. Conclusions: This is the first study of quantitative assessment of PRAME expression in childhood leukemia. These preliminary results are in accordance with the fact that PRAME expression in acute leukemia does not seem to be of prognostic significance, whereas it might be a candidate marker for the monitoring of the patients' response to treatment and for early detection of hematological relapse prior to its occurrence.",

Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate WT1 expression levels in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia. Patients-Methods: A total of twenty-one children were enrolled to the study. Bone marrow samples from 14 patients with acute leukemia (10 ALL, 4 AML) were studied using quantitative real time RT-PCR (RQ-PCR). Normal bone marrow from 7 children with non malignant hematological diseases and solid tumors without bone marrow infiltration was used as control. Results: Five of the 14 patients (2 ALL, 3 AML) studied (35.7%), expressed high levels of WT1. Four of the WT1 positive patients, who had additional adverse prognostic factors according to their treatment protocols, have succumbed from their disease. Conclusions: The above data suggest that high WT1 expression could correlate with unfavorable outcome of acute leukemia in childhood. Further studies are needed in order to assess the potential role of WT1 in the monitoring of the patients' response to treatment and the detection of minimal residual disease. High-dose busulphan combined with cyclophosphamide (BuCy) proved effective in terms of cytoreduction ad immune suppression for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). As a consequence, BuCy has become a widely used regimen in autologous transplantation, though immune suppression is not being pursued in this setting. Busulphan alone has been used before autologous BMT transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia, but is not currently used for AML. Recently, to reduce toxicity, it has been our policy to treat AML patients up to 70 years of age with high dose busulphan as a single agent. Overall, 29 patients with AML in CR have been treated with busulphan-based regimens (16 mg/kg orally or, more recently, 13.2 mg/kg i.v.) at our center. All patients received autologous peripheral blood stem cells plus G-CSF after transplant, and low dose heparin was given as VOD prophylaxis. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 6,1 months; 5 years overall survival was 60%; relapse rate was 41%; median time to relapse was 7 months. Retrospectively, relapse-free survival (RFS) and toxicity were compared in patients who received busulphan alone (group A, 7 patients, median age 63), BuCy (group B, 14 patients, median age 52) or busulphan + etoposide (group C, 8 patients, median age 44). No toxic deaths occurred. A lower toxicity, as expected, was observed in group A: in this group, in spite of a profound neutropenia, only 1 of 7 patients had a WBC nadir lower than 500/mcL, and no patient needed RBC transfusions. The relapse rate was 42.8% in group A, 42.8% in group B, and 37.5% in group C. In conclusion: these data must be interpreted cautiously considering the small sample size, the heterogeneity between groups, and the short follow up of group A patients (9 vs 34 months, median). As a matter of fact, however, cyclophosphamide has no role in the treatment of AML and this agent might increase the toxicity of busulphan without adding substantial benefit in autologous BMT. We did not observe, so far, any difference in terms of RFS between patients receiving BuCy and patients receiving busulphan alone. Since relapse is the main cause of death in AML after autologous transplantation, these data might suggest that cyclophosphamide can be omitted in elderly AML patients undergoing autologous BMT in first remission. Background and objetives: Conventional chemotherapy is ineffective to obtain long-term survival in patients with acute leukemia in advanced phase (>2CR or relapsed/refractory). In this study we analyze the results of allo-SCT for acute leukemia in advanced phase. Patients: Sixty-three patients received an HLA-identical related allo-SCT between sep/1995 and jan/2005. Median age was 28. Nineteen patients had ALL and forty-four had AML. Thirty-six were in first relapse, thirteen in second relapse and fourteen in other phase. Busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy) was employed as conditioning regimen in 44 patients. Fifty-seven patients received CSA+MTX as GVHD prophylaxis. Results: Fifty-five patients engrafted. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 16 (range 10-31) and 13 (range 7-62) days, respectively. Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade 2-4 (D+100) was 40%. Nine of 42 patients at risk presented chronic GVHD (8 extensive). Twenty-seven out of forty-six patients alive at D+60 relapsed. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 87% vs. 39% for patients with or without chronic GVHD, respectively (P=0.008). With a median followup of 1137 days, estimated 5-year overall survival was 16%. Overall survival for patients with or without chronic GVHD was 14% vs. 53%, respectively (P=0.009).

Svoboda Charles University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Background: high-risk or advanced AML has poor prognosis without allogeneic transplantation (alloSCT). Myeloablative alloSCT in older patients (pts) or pts with comorbidities is associated with high transplant related mortality (TRM). Reduced-intensity transplantation (RIT) can allow pts with high risk of TRM to undergo alloSCT. To evaluate the role of RIT in treatment of \"high-risk\"pts with high-risk AML we retrospectively analysed the outcome of such pts undergoing RIT in our centre and we compared their outcome with a control group transplanted for high-risk AML after myeloblative conditioning. Patients and methods: since 2001 22 pts (Group 1) with median of age 57 years (22-68) with high-risk AML in 1.CR (10 pts) or AML beyond 1.CR (12 pts) underwent RIT (41% identical related, 36% matched unrelated, 23% mismatched unrelated). Source of stem cells was peripheral blood and the median of CD 34+ cells was 6,0x10 6 /kg (1,7-19,0x10 6 /kg). The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (30mg/m\u00b2, 4days) and melphalan (140mg/m\u00b2, 1day). Cyclosporine and methotrexate were administered as GVHD prophylaxis. The control group (Group 2) of 23 pts transplanted after myeloablative conditioning (BuCY2) did not differ for any significant variables except for younger age (p=0.004). Results: Group 1: all patients engrafted and achieved CR with full donor chimerism (FDC). 9 pts (50%) developed acute GvHD (9% grade III-IV) and among 16 evaluable pts 7 pts (44%) developed chronic GvHD. With median follow-up 549 days (64-1327) 9 pts (41%) are alive in CR with FDC. 6 pts (27%) relapsed and died. 7 pts (32%) died due to TRM. The estimated probabilities of 3-years EFS and OS are 32%. Group 2: all patients engrafted and achieved CR with FDC. 10 pts (43%) developed acute GvHD (9% grade III-IV) and among 17 evaluable pts 4 pts (24%) developed chronic GvHD. With median follow-up 377 days (100-1219) 12 pts (52%) are alive in CR with FDC. 6 pts (26%) relapsed (5 of them died). 5 pts (22%) died due to TRM. The estimated probabilities of 3-years EFS and OS are 39% and 52%.We observed no significant difference in aGvHD (p=0,76), chGvHD (p=0,28), TRM (0,51), relapses (p=1.00), 3-years EFS (p=0.45) and OS (p=0,45) between both groups. Conclusion: our data suggest that RIT in elderly pts or pts with comorbidities is associated with acceptable TRM and disease control of high-risk or advanced AML. Our results of RIT do not differ from results of high-risk AML after myeloablative alloSCT.",

Cevreska, N. Siljanovski, Z. Stojanoski, S. Genadieva Stavrik, I. Panovska, S. Krstevska Balkanov, S. Trajkova, B. Georgievski Clinical Center (Skopje, MK) G-CSF is the standard agent commonly administered to AML patients undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization and collection in a dose of 10 micro/gr in a 4 days regimen. The additional Etoposide to G-CSF proved efficient primary mobilizing regimen for patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, mainly NHL and HD. Since the kinetics of etoposide as mobilizing agent is sparsely described, we evaluated its effectiveness on 9 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Pts received VP-16(2gm/m\u00b2) followed by daily G-CSF(10mcg/kg). All pts experienced a significant WBC nadir on median day +6, and began pheresis in recovered WBC up to 5.0x109/L on day +13(median). All analyzed patients reached at least 2x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells with median 3 (ranges 1-6) apheresis procedures. 7 (78%) of pts began collection on day +12,+13 or +14 and 2 (22%) pts did not begin pheresis until day +16 or longer. In statistical data we followed several variables concerning the platelet count on day 1 of apheresis which correlated with the ability to collect over 5x106CD34+cells/kg (p<0,001) and previously received chemotherapy cycles of 5pts(32%) who started pheresis on median day +17 (p<0,001). We can conclude that the VP-16+G-CSF mobilizing regimen for AML patients showed effective with excellent yields results for median 3 day leukopheresis procedure, which shows the possibility for establishing this regimen as primary mobilizing regimen for AML patients.",

Barta (1) HSCT remains the best therapy for the control of acute leukemias in adult patients. The aim of this study was to analyse the treatment outcome of 37 cases with acute leukemias, who were treated at the National Medical Center, Budapest, Hungary. In the period of 1993-2003, 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 7 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were transplanted in National Medical Center. 30 patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical sibling (N=23), or unrelated (N=7) donors. Autologous transplantation was performed in 7 patients. In the majority of cases (32/37), total body irradiation (TBI) and Cyclophosphamide were used for conditioning. Cyclosporine-A and short course of Methotrexate were used for graft-versus host disease (GVHD) prevention. In 4 patients receiving grafts from unrelated donors, in vivo or in vitro T-cell depletion were also administered. In 30 patients bone marrow, in 2 patients peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) were used for stem cell source, and 5 patients received both bone marrow and PBSC. 5 year survival of all transplanted patients with AML is 50 % and in those with ALL 58%. Among AML patients, 50 % of sibling donor transplants are surviving, whereas 25% of unrelated transplants are alive and in complete remission (CR). The timing of the transplantation (1st CR,or 2nd CR) did not appear to have any impact on outcome. Conclusions: HSCT proved to be a potentially curative procedure in AML and ALL, in our Institute. The poorer outcome of unrelated transplants was related to the higher transplant-related mortality of this subgroup. Incidence of GVHD was comparable to the data in literature. In AML patients the timing of the HSCT (1st CR or 2nd CR) did not appear to have any impact on outcome.",

Altogether 36 cases (6 children and 30 adults, median age: 23 years) suffered from acute leucaemias. 21 patients were in 1st complete remission (1CR), 15 in CR > 1st. 26 patients received myeloablative conditioning regimen which consisted of Busulphan (16mg/.kg) , Cyclophosphamide (120mg/kg ) and ATG or Campath for ALL and 10 were conditioned with reduced toxicity protocol : Busulphan 8mg/kg or Melphalan 140mg/m\u00b2 plus Fludarabine 150mg/m\u00b2 and ATG (or Campath) . Cumulative proportion survival was similar for AML and ALL cases in early stage of the disease, and worse in cases in advanced stage of the disease (45% vs.36% at 8 years post transplant). Altogether 16 patients out of 36: (44%) are alive and well. Profile of fatal outcome differed along the time elapsing post transplant, the main cause of death until day +100 was aGvHD (6 cases) and after day +100 relapse (7 cases). Figure. In conclusion: the outcome of the procedure is hampered by aGvHD and relapses in an equal proportion. Objectives: Damage of endothelial cells is the one of the features of vascular disorders associated with early toxicity after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The endothelium by regulating the contact between adjacent endothelial cells, highly effective intercellular junctions maintain endothelial integrity and modulate several functions such as vascular permeability and leukocyte transmigration. CD 146, also referred as MUC 18, is constitutively expressed in all human endothelium irrespective of anatomical site or vessel calibers. CD146 is not restricted to the endothelium since it is also found on several other cell types, including for example melanoma cells but CD146 expression is not detected in mature hematopoietic cells. Elevated numbers of circulating endothelial cells reflect the extent of endothelial damage in variety of disorders but their role in tissue damage after HSCT has no been investigated so far. Patients and methods: We analyzed sCD146 serum levels during high dose chemotherapy and first 30 days after allogeneic HSCT in 15 patients (mean age 31,3\u00b13,0 years) with hematological malignancies (AML, ALL, CML) and SAA. Different conditioning regimens were used: BuCy2, Cy+TBI, Cy200. Serum of 30 healthy people were used as control. Serum sCD146 levels were measured by CY-QUANT ELISA sCD146 kit BIOCYTEX. Results: Median value of sCD146 before HSCT was high: 345\u00b1125,7 pg/ml and tent to decreased during consecutive 25 days (254,8\u00b191,7). There is no statistically significant difference with healthy controls (253\u00b158; p \u2264 0,05) and patients after HSCT. The studied interrelations confirmed existing correlations between decreased levels of sCD146 antigen and increased concentrations of interleukin-6 (r=-0,240; p \u2264 0,05) and serum amyloid A (r=-0,242; p \u2264 0,05). Conclusions: Monitoring of soluble antigen CD146 levels seems to be a novel marker to investigate endothelial damage and the effects of different conditioning regiments undergoing HSCT. Its measurement could be useful in other clinical settings associated with junctional alteration. Background: Hematologic relapse after an allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for acute leukaemia is associated with poor outcome: 5 year survival for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) relapsing after an allograft is 10% and for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) this figure is 15%. Most relapses (79%) occur within the first year after transplant. Aim of the study. Prospectively assess minimal residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic HSCT to test (a) incidence of MRD positivity, (b) predictive value on hematologic relapse and (c) whether MRD positivity can be used to initiate treatment with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Patients and methods: Seventy three patients with ALL (n=29) or AML (n=44) received an allogeneic HSCT, most of them after a conventional (CY-TBI) conditioning regimen. Rearrangement for JH regions and fusion genes (bcr/abl) (RQ-PCR) were used to monitor MRD in ALL, whereas Wilms Tumour 1 (WT1) expression (RQ-PCR) was used in AML. Monitoring was done on bone marrow samples taken pretransplant, and on day+30, +60, +90, +120, +150, +180. At the time of a positive MRD patients would be eligible for DLI in escalating doses. Results: Overall 30 patients of 73 patients (41%) were MRD positive after transplant, 66% for ALL and 25% for AML. Hematologic relapse occurred in 15 of 30 MRD+ patients and in 2 of 43 MRD negative patients (p=0.0001). For ALL patients these figures were 10/19 vs 2/10 (p=0.09) and for AML it was 5/11 vs 0/33 (p=0.0004). Of the 30 MRD positive patients 16 were given no DLI because the donor was not available or unsuitable for second donation at the time of MRD positivity: 14 patients relapsed (87%) and 3 (19%) survive. Fourteen patients were given DLI, one relapsed (7%) and 12 survive (86%). The difference of hematologic relapse in MRD positive patients receiving DLI (8%) or not receiving DLI (57%) is highly significant (p=0.0001). This particularly true for ALL patients receiving DLI (n=10) (1 relapse and 8 survivors) as compared to ALL patients not receiving DLI (n=9) (9 relapses and 1 survivor).",

Spinelli (1) Background: The risk of recurrence in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo HSCT) can not be predicted with accuracy by clinical prognostic models. We investigated whether the molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) could be used to predict leukemia relapse after transplantation. Methods and Patients: MRD was evaluated by Real Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR) using molecular probes derived from fusion chimeric genes (19 BCR/ABL and 2 ALL/AF4), or rearrangements of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta, gamma and delta or Immunoglobulin Heavy chain (18 patients). The maximal sensitivity of the probes was at least 10-4 for TCR or Ig probes and 10-5 for BCR/ABL or ALL/AF4. Experiments were performed on bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells. Thirty-nine adult ALL patients were studied before and after allo HSCT conditioned with myeloablative (TBI 1200 cGy based) (n= 33) or reduced intensity (n= 2) regimens. Results: Before the conditioning regimen, a negative RQ-PCR analysis was demonstrated in 9 cases while a positive MRD was found in 30. Among these latter, 21 patients had a high BM leukemia burden (1 leukemic cell in 100 to 1000 normal BM cells) while 9 showed a lower level of residual disease (1 cell in >1000 to 100000 normal cells). The relapse rate of patients with a negative or low MRD level before conditioning was 17% as compared to 43% observed in patients with a high leukaemia burden. With a median follow up of 2 years the overall survival of these 39 patients is 48%. The DFS of patients who achieved a molecular response in the BM by day +90/120 after transplantation is 87% as compared to 37% for patients who did not convert to molecular negativity (p< 0.002). Conclusions: The achievement of a molecular remission within 3 months after transplantation is associated with a significantly better clinical outcome. These observations may help identifying patients who are in need of more aggressive treatments or earlier innovative immune interventions before the occurrence of hematologic relapse.",

Ganser Hannover Medical School (Hannover,D) Introduction: It still remains unclear whether routine monitoring of peripheral hematopoietic chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a meaningful parameter in terms of early diagnosis of relapse or graft failure. To address this question we retrospectively analyzed the value of chimerism monitoring in 262 patients following HSCT for malignant and non-malignant diseases. Patients and Methods: 223 patients received peripheral stem cells, 38 bone marrow and 1 patient cord blood for hematologic malignancies and Aplastic Anemias. 159 patients received conventional conditioning regimen and 103 reduced intensity conventional (RIC). 19 patients had a T-cell depleted graft, 58 patients received prophylactic or therapeutic donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). 171 patients were alive at time of last follow up. 56 patients relapsed or had a disease progression after transplantation. Chimerism studies were performed on peripheral blood using variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) techniques. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. Results: 30 of 55 relapsing patients had a mixed chimerism (MC) prior to diagnosis of reoccurrence of the underlying disease. 61 of 191 patients without relapse showed transient or sustained mixed chimerism. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between MC and relapse rate (p=0,046) in all patients. There is no significant correlation between myeoloablative and RIC regimen and MC in this group of patients. Subgroup analysis showed correlation between MC and disease re-occurrence in patients with AML, MDS, ALL and CML. In contrast, patients with MM, CLL or lymphoma showed no correlation between MC and relapse based on conventional parameters. 4/5 patients showed MC and subsequently rejected their graft. Out of 58 patients receiving DLI 24, showed a MC at time of DLI. Only eight patients had increasing donor chimerism after receiving DLI. Conclusion: In summary, the results show that the routine analysis of peripheral donor chimerism has prognostic significance to identify patients with enhanced risk for relapse in patients with AML, MDS, ALL and CML. Assessment of donor chimerism in patients with MM, CLL or Lymphoma has no prognostic value for disease re-occurrence in this group of patients. Therefore analysis of donor chimerism might only be meaningful in patients with a higher risk of graft rejection or above-listed diseases. Background: Curative potential of allogeneic bone marrow transplant (ABMT) is partly attributed to the graft-versusleukemia (GvL) effect. Published data confirm that acute graftversus-host disease (AcGvHD) has a preventive effect on relapse in patients with acute leukemia (AL), especially a medullary relapse. Objectives: We analyzed characteristics of AL patients relapsing post ABMT at our center with reference to AcGvHD, age and disease group. Results: 126 AL patients (69 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 5 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 52 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) were transplanted from a matched sibling donor between 1995 and 2005. Median age was 29 years . Most patients were in first complete remission. Conditioning regimen included busulfan/cyclophosphamide for AML and MDS and cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation for ALL. Methotrexate and cyclosporine were used for GvHD prophylaxis. All patients received unpurged mobilized peripheral stem cells with CD34+ >5x10 6 /KG. ACGVHD grade 2-4 developed in 24/52 (46%) ALL patients, 29/69 (34%) AML patients and 1/5 MDS. 15/69 AML patients relapsed, 11 with medullary relapse, at a median time of 6 months post transplant (2-29months). 9/11 medullary relapses occurred without AcGvHD. 8/11 died. 3 were rescued with chemotherapy, followed by a second transplant in 2, with survival >24 months. 2/15 developed CNS extramedullary relapse 15 and 60 months post transplant. Both suffered from AcGvHD, still alive >12 months. 2/15 developed medullary and extramedullary relapse with no AcGvHD and died. 9/52 ALL patients relapsed. 7/9 developed a medullary relapse at a median time of 5 months from transplant (2-8 months). 6/7 had no AcGVHD. 4/7 died. 3/7 were rescued with chemotherapy and GvL. 2/9 developed extramedullary relapse 6 and 34 months post transplant (1 CNS and 1pulmonary); both died. Conclusion: Relapse of AL post ABMT has a dismal outcome. Medullary relapse appears early compared to extramedullary, confirming other publications. Data shown confirm that AcGvHD has a preventive role in medullary relapse in both AML and ALL as it appeared more frequently in non-relapsed patients and the 3 rescued ALL were in part due to induced GvHD. No correlation between GvHD and extramedullary relapse could be documented due to small numbers. Patients with extramedullary relapse may have an indolent course and raise the unresolved issue of post-transplant CNS prophylaxis.",

Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia secondary to MDS (sAML) is considered a high risk procedure with above average treatment related mortality. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) from related or unrelated donors therefore is often discussed only late in the course of the disease. In our centre allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) is offered to all patients with MDS meeting at least one of the following criteria: life threatening cytopenia, transfusion dependence or blast excess. We here report on the results of this approach. Patients and methods: Between September 1997 and September 2005 25 related and 51 unrelated transplants were performed for 32 patients (pts) with MDS and 54 pts with sAML (>20 % blasts), median age 51 years. MDS cases were 19 RA/RCMD, 10 RAEB and 3 CMML. IPS scores were intermediate low in 14, intermediate high in 11 and high in 4 RA(EB) cases. 37 pts received unmanipulated bone marrow, 49 unmanipulated PBSC after standard (Bu/Cy or TBI12/Cy, n = 40 ) or reduced toxicity (TBI8/Flud/Cy, BCNU/Flud/Mel or FLAMSA, n = 46) conditioning. In unrelated transplants rabbit ATG Genzyme or Fresenius was added. At a median (md) follow up of 45 (3 -83) months (mo) probability of overall survival (pOS) is 52 % for the whole cohort. At a md follow up of 35 mo pOS is 77 % for RA and RAEB pts (md age 44), irrespective of IPSS, blast excess, age, donor type or stem cell source. At a md follow up of 56 mo pOS is 43 % for sAML pts (md age 56), irrespective of donor type. Survival curves of pts with or without blast clearance at transplant are superimposable. However sAML pts with < 3 chemotherapy cycles have a better outcome than those with heavy pretreatment (pOS of 50 % vs 31 %). The same is true for younger pts (pOS < 50 years 58 % vs \u2265 50 years 35 %). No pt with CMML survived. To date 9/32 MDS pts have died: 7 from treatment related toxicity (TRT) and two from relapse. From the sAML group 29/54 pts have died: 12 from TRT, 7 from GvHD, 9 from relapse and one from bronchial carcinoma. Conclusion: In symptomatic MDS primary alloSCT from either related or unrelated donors may yield excellent results. The chances of cure decline with disease progression to sAML, and with the number of chemotherapy cycles administered before transplant. AlloSCT therefore should be considered as part of the initial disease management plan and performed when best results can be achieved with moderate toxicity.",

Background and objectives: The intensive chemotherapy is routinely used in younger patients with advanced MDS or AML evolving from MDS. In attempt to improve the CR rates and to prolong the remission duration, we initiated a multicentric prospective study to assess the efficacy of intensive remission-induction and consolidation chemotherapy, followed by autologous (ASCT) or allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Design and Methods: 92 patients (aged >15 years) diagnosed of high-risk MDS or sAML in 10 Spanish hospitals from Jan. 1999 to June 2005 were treated with intensive regimen, consisting of Idarrubicin, ara-C and etoposide (ICE) for remission induction. Responding patients received one consolidation course of ICE, followed by autologous PBSCT. Patients \u2265 55 years with an allogenic HLA-identical donor proceeded to stem cell transplantation after induction treatment (allo-SCT). Patients with hypoplastic marrow or <10% blast cells in bone marrow and with related donor, made alol-SCT without induction treatment. Results: 92 patients (57 males/29 females) with median age of 52 y. (range 16-69) have been entered and 86 are valuable for response: 66 had MDS and 20 sAML. 16 patients had MDS or sAML following treatment for previous malignancy. 9 patients received allo-SCT as initial treatment; all 9 achieved CR. 5 of the 9 patients maintained the response at 13,30,46,49 and 56 months respectively. 75 patients received ICE; the overall CR rate was 57%, PR rate 12%, Treatment failure 21%, and early death rate 10.7%. 22 patients received ASCT, 11 allo-SCT (6 non-myeloablative and 5 conventional), 2 no treatment after, 1 died at consolidation, 5 no mobilized enough. After a median follow-up of 52 months, the median overall survival was 21%, median duration relapse-free survival 8 months. 20 patients valuables are in CR (5 allo-SCT direct; 6 allo-SCT consolidation, 1 allo-SCT in rescue, 4 autologous SCT, 2 ICE). Patients who received allo-SCT for induction didn't yet achieve the median of survival. Unfavourable karyotype derives no benefit from intensive chemotherapy. IPSS cytogenetic risk group's help to predict the outcome of intensive chemotherapy in our study. Conclusions: this strategy of treatment is highly effective in obtained CR's. In 52% of the patients it was possible to make an intensive treatment. Allo-SCT is the choice for younger patients with donor. Nevertheless, six patients without a donor remained in first remission without allo-SCT.",

            "text": "In marrow aplasia reduced-intensity conditioning and Tcell depletion of cytokine mobilised stem cells provides good engraftment without GvHD N. Novitzky (1) Introduction: In patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) schedules seem well tolerated, but have been associated with substantial rates of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). In haematological malignancies GvHD seems to have a protective role from disease recurrence, but such effect is not useful in patients with marrow aplasia and compromises patient survival. We report on a strategy of pre transplant conditioning that when combined with T-cell depletion of grafts has been associated with universal engraftment and no GvHD. Methods: Patients with aplastic anaemia who had HLA identical siblings were entered into the study. Conditioning was with fludarabine (FLU) 30 mg/m\u00b2 for 5 days followed by cyclophosphamide (CY) 60 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days. Cytokine mobilised blood progenitor cells were collected by apheresis. GvHD prophylaxis was by ex vivo incubation of the graft with CAMPATH-1H (0.1 mg/10 8 mononuclear cells) and with therapeutic blood levels of cyclosporin until day 90. Results: Between March 2003 and October 2005, 14 patients with aplasia received 15 PBPC grafts. Their median age was 31.5 (12-46) years and 10 were male. The conditioning was well tolerated and except for haematological suppression, there was no other grade 3 or 4 toxicities reported. Patients received median of 12.9 x 10 8 /kg mononuclear cells containing 3.46 (1.05 -5.27) x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells. The median dose of CAMPATH-1H \"in the bag\" was 10 (5 -10) mg. Engraftment (> 0.5 and 20 x 10 9 /L polymorphs and platelets respectively) was seen by day 13 in all and there was no transplant related mortality. None of the patients developed GvHD. Blood values had normalised by day 132 (median 117) in all patients. Following discharge, 3 individuals required readmission for infections (pneumonia and line sepsis in 2) and all recovered. None showed evidence of CMV reactivation. One patient developed graft failure 7 months from transplantation and received a second equally conditioned Tcell depleted graft from the same donor that resulted in quick recovery blood values and he remains well 8 months later. At a median follow up of 442 days all patients survive with normal blood parameters. Conclusions: We conclude that conditioning with this schedule of FLU/CY has an acceptable toxicity profile, and allows effective engraftment of T-cell depleted grafts and has provided effective protection from GvHD. Fanconi aplastic anemia (FA) is characterized by progressive bone marrow failure. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from healthy donors is the only treatment modality for the correction of hematological abnormalities in FA patients. The cells are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. At the clinical level this has translated into severe toxicity when conventional conditioning regimens were used in preparation of FA patients for HSCT. Recently low toxicity SCT protocol excluding irradiation has been proposed. Aim of this study is the comparison of two protocols used in preparation of FA patients for HSCT in respect to engraftment and toxicity. Between July 2000 and August 2005, 11 patients with FA underwent transplantation from 10 related and one unrelated donor. The median age at transplantation was 10 years. We have performed HSCT by using two different conditioning regimens. While anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG 30-60 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (20mg/kg) and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (total 5Gy) were used for six patients (regimen A), fludarabine (120 mg/m\u00b2), cyclophosphamide (40mg/kg), ATG (60mg/kg) were given to four patients in regimen B group. Patient who underwent unrelated SCT was conditioned with fludarabine (150 mg/m\u00b2), cyclophosphamide (40mg/kg) and ATG (90 mg/kg). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was with cyclosporin A alone but also included mycophenolate mofetil for the unrelated allograft. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred in all patients on day 10 (median) and day 20 (median), respectively. One regimen B patient lost his graft before day 100. Only one patient in regimen B group experienced grade II acute GVHD while two in group A. Post-transplant acute myeloid leukemia was developed in one patient who received regimen A. In regimen A group, fungal pneumonia were observed in one patient and he died at posttransplant 15th month. None of regimen B patients had severe organ toxicity or malignancy. Three out of 6 patients in regimen A group (50%) were alive with a followup 27, 32 and 54 months without any clinical problem while 4 patients out of 5 (80%) were well with the longest follow up as being 23 months in regimen B group. We conclude that fludarabine based conditioning regimen is well tolerated and ideally suited to reduce regimen related toxicities in FA patients' SCT. Further information on more patients and longer follow-up is necessary to determine if this indeed will be the case. The current standard conditioning regimen for SAA consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) given either alone or combined with antithymocyte globulin (ATG); as ATG supply was expensive and not regular in our country, we decided to use a conditioning for polytransfused patients with SAA (\u2265 15 transfusions) using busulfan (BU) 4 mg/Kg plus CY 200 mg/Kg as previously described (Dulley FL, BMT 2004 SCT was 3, 9 months (range, 0, . Bone marrow was used as stem-cells source in all but 4, who received a peripheral blood SCT. Median infused nucleated cell was 3,05(range, 1,1-17,3)x 108/ kg. The graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprised cyclosporine and methotrexate. Median time to achieve an absolute neutrophil count 0,5x109/l was 20 days (range, 12-37) and to free from platelet transfusion was 20 days (range,11-45). Acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was found in 32% and 10% of patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of graft rejection was 28,2%. Five and nine patients experienced primary and secundary graft failure, respectively. Until November 2005, 9 of those 14 patients are alive after a second allo-SCT or immunosupressive therapy. There was a trend to a lower risk of rejection for patients receiving CY+BU (P=0.13). The number of previous transfusions did not influence rejection. Probability of overall survival rate was 72% with a median follow-up of 55 months (range, 8-122) . There was a significant improved survival in patients that received < 15 transfusions, received >3,0 x 108/ kg NC, had not acute GVHD, and for whom disease was not very severe (neutrophil > 0,2x109/l). In multivariate analyses, the occurrence of acute GVHD remained the sole independent risk factor for survival (p=0,0003). The conditioning regimen with CY alone or CY plus BU was well tolerated; however, graft rejection remains a significant problem. Pre-conditioning regimen in 3 patients (age: 4.5 y, 10y, 10y) included cyclophosphamide (Cy) 20mg/kg, thoraco-abdominal irradiation (TAI) of 400cGy and anti-tymocyte globulin (ATG). T cell depletion (TCD) using positive selection of CD34 cells by immunomagnetic beads was employed in 2 patients. Only 1 patient with 1antigen mismatched stem cells who did not have TCD engrafted after the first transplant. He later developed cyclosporine toxicity, acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and multifocal encephalopathy and died. The other 2 patients did not engraft and needed a second transplant. One received fludarabine and ATG and TCD stem cell from a different haploidentical family donor and engrafted. She is the only long-term survivor (7 years) in this group, and clinically well. The second patient received TCD stem cells from another 3 haploidentical donors and engrafted only after forth transplant after full conditioning with thiotepa, melphalan, ATG and fludarabine. Unfortunately he died due to venoocclusive disease, systemic fungal infection, hemorrhagic cystitis and multi organ failure. Conditioning regimen for the fourth patient (age: 18y) included fludarabine, ATG and Cy 40mg/kg without TAI. TCD was done. No engraftment occurred and he required a second transplantation. Conditioning for the second transplant included thiotepa, fludarabine and ATG. He died during neutropenia with sepsis and respiratory failure. Conclusions: Due to the high transplant related mortality using full conditioning regimen in FA patients, the standard pretransplant preparative regimen consisted of low doses of Cy coupled with TAI or recently fludarabine. Adding TCD to this regimen while using mismatched donor may increase the risk of non-engraftment. On the other hand, T-cell replete transplant would obviously increases GVHD. One of the major problems with FA is the uncertainty regarding the limits of tolerance for the preparative regimen, especially in the setting of TCD. The one patient who needed 4 transplants engrafted finally after using full conditioning regimen. In vitro studies of individual sensitivity to chemotherapy are urgently needed.",

Gaslini (Genoa, I) A 21 year old splenectromized male with intractable Evans syndrome (ES) with high-titers of anti-red cells and platelet antibodies was transplanted with the unmanipulated bone marrow (BM) of his HLA-identical 12-year old sister on November 3, 2000. Because of progressive relapse associated with recipient mixed chimerism he received 5 incremental donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and achieved full donor chimerism, associated with complete hematologic and immunologic remission (1). In the 5 years of FU he maintained his remission, although the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was on occasion weakly positive. In 2002 he suffered with an acute infectious episode with ARDS. On August 28, 2005 he was hospitalized with an acute hemolytic/thrombocytopenic crisis with strongly positive antibodies. The total bilirubin peak attained mg 52.9%. Treatment consisted of corticosteroids, Rituximab infusions, plasma exchanges, cyclophosphamide (CY) and high-dose immunoglobulins (HDIG). The ES condition improved markedly, but on day +17 irreversible anuria could not be counteracted by immediate dialysis, and the patient expired. Autopsy confirmed a hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Full donor chimerism by cytogenetics and single-tandemrepeat-PCR (STR-PCR) was found in all examined blood and marrow cells. T and B cell microcultures were expanded and tested. Chimerism was assessed by FISH analysis utilizing probes specific for the centromeres of X and Y chromosome. Approximately 5000 bulk cultured T cells displayed the donor genotype. All B cell microcultures also showed the donor genotype. Supernates from 10 B cell microcultures were found to contain IgM only or mixtures of IgM-IgG. None of these reacted with a panel of erythrocytes. Donor cell leukemia (DCL) was found in 14 out of 10489 patients (0.01%; 2). In contrast, there are now three well documented cases of relapses in autoimmune diseases (AD) in spite of full donor chimerism in a greatly inferior number of cases (20-30?) . Differently from DCL we show here that donor cells are innocent of autoimmunity. Independently from clinical problems which will be discussed elsewhere, a possible interpretation might be consistent with the concept of survival niches for long-lived, replicating recipient plasma-cell lines. (3) (1) During the last several years high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT)+autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is more often used as a therapeutic option for MS patients. The major treatment outcomes for MS patients are disease-progression free period and improvement in the patients' quality of life (QoL). We aimed to study the clinical and QoL responses in MS patients at long-term follow-up after HDCT +ASCT. Twenty-three patients with MS (secondary progressive -12, primary progressive -7, progressive relapsing -1, relapsing remitting -3) were included in this study (mean age -32.7, SD -7.4; male/female -6/17). Median EDSS at base-line was 6.0 (range 2.0 -7.5). The median follow-up duration was 18 months (range 6 -72 months). All of the patients had previously undergone conventional treatment. Neurological and QoL evaluation was provided at baseline, at discharge, 3, 6, 9, 12 months, and then every 6 months after HDCT+ ASCT. MRI was performed at baseline, at 6, 12 months, and at the end of follow-up. FACT-BMT and FAMS were used for QoL evaluation. QoL response was evaluated using the Integral QoL index. Nineteen (95%) out of 20 patients included in the analysis of clinical response experienced a clinical stabilization or improvement. Three patients showed significant improvement in EDSS (by more than 1.0 point), 4 patients improved by 1.0 point, and 4 patients -by 0.5 points on EDSS. Eight cases remained stable. All of the patients with clinical stabilization and improvement exhibited negative MRI scans. One patient deteriorated to a worse score after 18 months of stabilization and died of acute leukemia 3 years post transplant. One patient after 12 months of improvement progressed to a worse EDSS score. Sixteen patients (18 patients analyzed) with clinical response exhibited improved QoL at 6 months post-transplant. At one year after HDCT+ASCT 3 patients exhibited good QoL response; 6 patients -moderate QoL response and 7 patients -minimal QoL response. At 2.5 years post-transplant 3 patients had excellent QoL response. Further QoL improvement was observed at longer follow-up. Notably, the patient who experienced progression after stabilization had no QoL response. In conclusion, clinical response was observed in 95% of MS patients after HDCT+ASCT. The majority of patients with clinical response had good or moderate QoL response. Thus, HDCT+ASCT appears to be an effective treatment for MS both in terms of clinical and patient-reported outcomes.",

Twenty seven patients were treated by high dose conditioning BEAM. Four patients underwent PBPC mobilisation but did not proceed to the high dose therapy. T cell depletion in vitro was performed in 18 grafts. Nine patients with not purged graft received in vivo ATG 4mg/kg i.v. D+1, D+2 after transplantation. Median follow-up is 50 months (24 -74). Median EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) of grafted patients at the time of inclusion were 6.5 (5.0-7.5), median EDSS of grafted patients at the last follow up was 7,0 (5.5-10.0). Two patients out of 27 (7 %) remain improved significantly (by > 0.5 point on EDSS), 3 patients (11 %) are improved not significantly (by 0.5 point). Five patients (19 %) are stable in their EDSS.

Seven patients (26 %) gained their disability significantly (by > 0.5 point on EDSS) despite the treatment, one of them died 31 months after the transplantation from disease progression (EDSS 10.0). Ten other patients (37 %) worsened not significantly (by 0.5 point) on their EDSS. Increase of EDSS (gain of the disability) at the 50 months of the follow up is significant, however, is not at 36, 60 and 72 months respectively. The development of disability between the group that was grafted with in vitro purged graft and the group with ATG i.v. was also not significant. Among 4 mobilized but not transplanted patients 1 improved by 1.5 point on EDSS, 3 patients worsened by 1.0 or 0.5 points. 18 patients stabilized their MRI finding, in 2 patients decreased number and size of lesions were detected, 5 patients worsened their MRI. The toxicity of the transplantation differed in each individual, two serious events were observed, however, no mortality has been noted in this cohort. Both patients needed temporary artificial ventilation. Changes in lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood were followed before and after the treatment. At least twelve months after the transplantation percentage of CD4+ cells and CD4+CD45 as well as IRI are still significantly decreased. As the significant majority of patients at least stabilized in their disability, we consider the results to be promising.",

Conditioning regimens included BEAM (n=3), Melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 + VP-16 1600 mg/m\u00b2 (n=2), Cy 200 mg/kg (n=4) and Melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 alone (n=7). Horse ATG (60 mg/kg) was given for in vivo T cell-depletion (n=5). Clinical outcome and immunological features were assessed before ASCT and at 1, 3, and 6 months and yearly after transplantation. We assessed basic aspects of the immune reconstitution by flow cytometry. Patients and results: ASCT has been applied in 9 patients with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 6 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), and 1 patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) relapsed after splenectomy. The median time to engraftment did not differ from that generally found after ASCT. Three SLE patients died due to transplant related infections, one MS patient died due to t-AML. At a median follow up of 34 months 6 patients are in complete remission (3 SLE, 2 MS, 1 ITP) and 5 patients have demonstrated improvement or stabilization. Mean absolute lymphocyte counts were back to baseline level at the 6 month. The CD4/CD8 ratio significantly decreased at 1 month after ASCT due to reduced proportions of CD4 T-cells and remained stable in 6 months. There were no significant changes from pretherapy in the proportions of CD4+DR+ and CD8+DR+ lymphocytes. At 1 month posttransplant the number of na\u00efve CD4+45RA+ cell have been reduced significantly as well as CD8+45RA+ cells, but these subpopulations recovered at 6 month after ASCT completely. CD8+45RO+ cells decreased steadily during the posttransplant follow-up. Before conditioning in vitro T-cell mitogenic responses were decreased in most of all patients with a trend toward a baseline level at 3 month after ASCT. Conclusion: ASCT can induce stable long-term remission in SAD patients. We did not found differences in T-cell recovery between patients with complete and partial response or between patients treated with different regimens. But we noted more rapid numerous and functional T-cell recovery in SAD patients treated with ASCT compared with lymphoma patients.",

Kamat (1) (1) (1) The association Association of thiotepa and cyclophosfamide (TT-CTX) has been extensively reported as an efficient and low toxicity conditioning regimen in the allogeneic setting and it was also proposed for the autologous HSCT in both solid tumors and Autoimmune Diseases (ADs). We report here a case of a SLE patient five years after an Auto-HSCT following a TT-CTX conditioning. A 40 yrs old woman with an intermediate pulmonary involvement with positivity of Scl-70 and global SLEDAI=9 was mobilized with CTX 4 g/sqm followed by Filgrastim 5 mcg/Kg; CD34+ cells were positively selected by CliniMacs (Miltenyi, Germany) and cryopreserved. On January 2001 the patient was administered with TT 10 mg/Kg at day -5 and CTX 50 mg/Kg at days -3 and -2 respectively. On day 0 the patient was reinfused with 4,46x10 6 CD34/Kg; CD3+ cells in the graft was 0.8x10 4 /Kg. The regimen was well tolerated and the patient reached 5x10 9 PMN/L and 20 x10 9 Plts on day 11 and 13 respectively. No major side effects were reported in the follow-up; a CMV reactivation at + 60 was effectively treated with Foscarnet in outpatient regimen. The patient experienced a negativization of SCL-70 Abs and SLEDAI score dropped to 0. Despite a persistence of ANA (1:160), the patient reported a marked improvement of dyspnea and metilprednisolone was gradually tapered to 2 mg/day, which is still the only maintenance treatment, resulting also in a remarkable improvement of steroidassociated symptoms. The patient is still in a good performance status, free of non-steroid treatments, 5 years after the HSCT. The association of TT-EDX might be proposed for ADs patients candidate to an auto-HSCT and at risk for organ toxicity related to conventional high-dose conditioning regimens.",

The disease is responding temporarily to immunosuppressive treatment, however, long-term prognosis is poor. There is only limited information about stem cell transplantation in patients with Evans syndrome. In 1999, Evans syndrome was diagnosed in a 2-year-old boy. Different treatment modalities including corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclosporine A, mycomofetilphenolate, vinblastine and rituximab were introduced yielding only partial responses. In 2004, double autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation ( auto-PSCTx ) was performed after conditionioning with cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globuline ( ATG ) and fludarabine, Campath, respectively. A short-term response was seen, however thrombocytopenia reappeared on day +14 and +100, respectively. In August 2004, intracerebral haemorrhage following hypertensive crisis occurred leading to emergency splenectomy and external ventricular drainage. Postoperative platelet counts were >800 x 10 9 /l, however, fell to below 10 x 10 9 /l after 24 days. In this critical clinal situation, the decision for allogeneis stem cell transplantation was made. Since there was no suitable related or unrelated donor available, umbilical cord blood with a 3/10 HLA loci mismatch was given following myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, VP-16, thiotepa and ATG. The posttransplantation course was complicated by different viral infections, feeding disorder and acute as well chronic graft versus host disease (gvhd) of skin, liver and gut necessitating immunosuppressive treatment. To date, 18 months following umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT), the patient is feeling well, he currently undergoes an intensive neurorehabilitation programme and is in stable remission without immunosuppression or evidence of gvhd. Conclusion: This is the first report describing the successful use of unrelated UCBT in a child with Evans syndrome refractory to conservative treatment. Median baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) was 6,0 (4,5-6,5). Methods: We used granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for mobilization, CD34-selection were not performed. High-dose immunosuppressive therapy included BEAM+ATG (antithymocyte globuline) in 10 patients and Fludarabine+Melphalane + ALG in 2 respectively. Regimenrelated toxicities were mild. Period after SCT was associated with transient worsening of neurological symptoms in all patients: emphasis ataxia, paresis and in 2 cases acute bladder dysfunction.

Oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid decreased in 2 patients across 9 months and 1 year after SCT. Conclusion: Clinical response was observed in most patients (8 of 9) after SCT. These findings confirm that SCT might be considered as an effective treatment for MS. Material an Methods: 12 patients with ALS met the inclusion criteria for this study. Spirometry with a forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity ratio not inferior to 60% was required. All patients were measured with an ALS function scale to settle an individual initial score. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected through a central venous catheter by a continuous flow apheresis equipment. CD34+ cells were tested and selected. In the operating room, the first step was to insert a spinal needle in the intervertebral space between L4 -L5, to obtain 4 milliliters (ml) of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to suspend 2 ml of Stem Cells in it, injecting the mixture in the subarachnoidal space. The second step was to locate the intervertebral space between D8 -D9 and to introduce percutaneously a flexible neuroendoscope to find the spinal posterior sulcus. Once 1 millimeter (mm) deep in the posterior side of the spine, one ml. of concentrated stem cells were transplanted. After checking through the neuroendoscope, the graft is firmly attached, 2 ml of concentrated stem cells were injected in the perispinal space and the procedure was finished. Results: 12 patients with ALS (8 males, 4 females); with an average of 57 year old (38 -75); 27 months after diagnosis (8 -36) were treated. CD34+ cells employed were 7.6 x 10 6 per kilogram (3.3 -17.8). Periodically assessment of the evolution of the score points of the ALS function scale, revealed that 3 patients improve their initial scores, while 9 keep the same condition with no progressive deterioration of their neurological performance. In all cases a remarkable decrease of the muscular fasciculations was observed. Conclusions: The procedure was safe, feasible and easy to reproduce. No complications or morbility were observed. Improvement of neurological condition was registered in 3 patients and stabilization of the progressive disease in other 9.

Recently we have shown that MSC can also modulate T and B cell responses thus providing a rationale for their use as therapy for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study we show that i.v. injected MSC can ameliorate both relapsing-remitting (PLPinduced) and chronic progressive (MOG-induced) EAE before and after disease onset. In vivo T cell response and antibodies production against the immunizing antigens and mitogens were significantly decreased in MSC treated mice. The adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic PLP sensitized, preconditioned with MSC, did not induce disease thus suggesting the induction of peripheral tolerance. Upon i.v injection, Green Fluorescent Protein labeled MSCs were detected inside the lymph nodes and the inflamed CNS. MSC injection resulted in a decreased number of inflammatory infiltrates and reduced demyelination. Inside the CSN we did not observe critical evidence of GFP positive MSC differentiation toward a neural fate. In contrast, MSC infiltrated lesions showed significant sparing of axons and oligodendrocytes. Overall, we propose that MSC may have a dual function that may be effective for the treatment of EAE, an autoimmune disease of the CNS where degeneration of neural cells follows inflammation Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) remains the only curative treatment option for patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Graft rejection or nonengraftment are frequent causes of treatment failure. PCR-STR analysis is a highly informative, fast, and simple method for monitoring hemopoietic chimerism post SCT. From 04/1998 until 09/2005, 49 patients were examined (46 suffering from beta-thalassaemia and 3 from beta thalassemia/sickle cell anaemia), who were subjected to 51 transplantations. The mean age of patients was 12.4 years (range, 1.4-21) and the mean time of surveillance was 24.5 months (range, 4-72). Chimerical status was examined in bone marrow, peripheral blood samples, and in single BFU-E colonies. Twenty out of 49 patients had full donor chimera (FDC) at all time points investigated, and they all survive disease free. Three out of 49 patients had FDC one month post-transplant but the following 1, 2 and 3 months converted to mixed chimera (MC). Two out of three patients survive with MC without need for transfusions. The third patient six months later had full thalassemia recurrence, received a second transplant from the same donor, and survives without disease. Twenty-five out of 49 patients had MC one month posttransplant. In 16 of 25 patients, MC was progressively converted to FDC in a mean time of 6 months (range; 2-12).",

            "text": "These patients survive with normal hemopoiesis except one who died from graft versus host disease. In 7 of 25 patients MC remains stable, and all of them survive free from transfusions. In 2 of 25 patients MC progressively increased and led to graft failure 8 and 4 months post-transplant, respectively. Both patients survive with disease. One patient never engrafted and lives with thalassemia. In 24 patients chimera was investigated in single BFU-E colonies with similar results to those obtained from peripheral blood nucleated cells analysis. STR-based chimerism analysis post SCT for hemoglobinopathies is a useful tool for graft function surveillance. Mixed chimera is common, but, when stable, is often related with normal hemoglobin levels and transfusion independency. Increasing mixed chimerism in the first months post SCT, usually heralds graft rejection and its detection can define a group of patients at high risk of disease recurrence that may profit from preemptive immunotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from HLA identical donors is an accepted treatment for patients with beta thalassemia major. We reviewed the results of 24 HSCT in 22 patients with thalassemia major who were treated in our center. These transplants were performed between March 1997 and September 2005. Median age of the patients was 6.9 years (1.9-17). Fourteen of them were low risk (Class I: 3 and Class II:11) and 10 of them were high risk patients(Class III: 10) according to Pesaro criteria. All donors were HLA identical, 23 were siblings and one was father. Stem cell sources were bone marrow (BM) in 15, peripheral blood in 6 and cord blood (CB) in 2 patients. BM plus CB were used in one patient. Preparative regimen consisting of busulfan+cyclophosphamide (BU+CY) was used in 11 patients, BU+Thiotepa+CY was used in 2 patients and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in one patient who had low risk criteria. The dosage of BU was calculated from body surface area (480 mg/m2) because of age-dependent pharmacokinetics of BU. All class III patients except one received Pesaro Protocol 26 plus ATG and one patient received Pesaro Protocol 26. The patients whose stem cell source was CB received only Cyclosporine A (CsA), other patients received CsA+methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. Median follow-up period was 24.5 months (2-105). Engraftment was achieved in all transplants except two(92%). Median neutrophile engraftment time was 15 days (9-29) and platelet engraftment time was 26 days (17-52). We observed acute GVHD in 2 and chronic GVHD in 2 patients. Two patients underwent second transplantation thus recurrence of thalassemia was seen in one and aplastic bone marrow was seen in the other. Both patients achieved engraftment after second transplants. Veno occlusive disease (grade II) was seen in 3 patients. One patient died because of the interstitial pneumonia. In our series, overall and event free survival was found as 95.5% and mortality rate was 4.5%. Graft rejection was detected 2 of 24 transplants (8%). We concluded that using a combination of ATG plus Pesaro Prot 26 as a conditioning regimen in class III patients and receiving higher doses of BU in class I-II patients were associated with an lower rejection rate in our series than the other studies. This sudy demonstrated that developing countries are be able to perform HSCT successfully which is considered as the only curative treatment approach for hemoglobinopathies. Inborn errors of metabolism P587 CD34+ stem cell top-ups without conditioning after initial HSCT for correction of incomplete haematopoietic and immunological recovery in severe congenital immunodeficiencies C. Booth (1) Haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) can be limited by ineffective recovery of haematopoiesis and for severe immunodeficiencies, incomplete immune reconstitution. Strategies for correction include DLI, whole marrow top-ups or fully conditioned 2nd HSCT. For mismatched unrelated or parental donor transplants, improvement using a second procedure must be balanced against the risk of inducing further GvHD. Infusion of CD34+ selected cells without conditioning from the original donor, may limit toxicity and GvHD and potentially engraft stem cells that may allow haematopoietic and immunological recovery. We reviewed 18 patients at two European paediatric immunodeficiency centres who had received CD34+ infusions without conditioning and assessed the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Patient diagnoses included SCID (n=13), Wiskott Aldrich syndrome (n=2), CD40L deficiency, HLH and osteopetrosis. Original transplants were from a haplo-identical parent (n=12), unrelated donors (n=3) and matched sibling or related donor (n=3). Mean age of initial transplant was 25.6mths and the reasons for the repeat procedure included lack of B cell function (n=5), severe HPV infection (n=3), lymphopaenia (n=3) and cytopaenias (n=7). Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n=7): CD34+ cells (mean cell dose-3.56 x 106/kg) were given within 1yr of initial HSCT (mean time after HSCT-3.4mths) and in all cases were given for correction of cytopaenia. Group 2: CD34+ cells (mean cell dose-6.28 x 106/kg) were infused at least 1 yr after initial HSCT (mean time after HSCT-120mths) and indications were B cell deficiency, HPV infection and lymphopaenia. Of the patients in Gp 1, 6 of 7 showed a positive response and achieved transfusion independence. However, in Group 2 patients, there was minimal improvement in immunological parameters. In one patient, B cell and myeloid engraftment improved significantly but there was no change in immunoglobulin production. In a second individual, resolution of HPV infection was seen but this was not associated with an improvement in immune parameters. In the majority of patients, no GvHD was seen. These data suggest that CD34+ selected top-up procedures are safe and are likely to be more effective in the 1st year after initial HSCT. Late top-up procedures to promote immune recovery are largely ineffective. A low intensity conditioning regime in association with a CD34+ selected top-up may be of more benefit but needs to be studied formally. Patients were assigned to an asymptomatic group who underwent a routine BAL whilst under anaesthetic for insertion of a CVL prior to HSCT, or a symptomatic group who had preexisting lung disease, changes on a chest radiograph or an oxygen requirement. BAL specimens were sent for routine bacterial and fungal culture, mycobacterial culture, viral culture, PCR for CMV, and immunofluorescence for respiratory viruses and Pneumocystis carinii. Pathogens isolated were noted, as well as complications arising from the procedure. Twenty six patients underwent a routine BAL, pathogens were isolated from 4 (15%); Hib, pseudomonas, Hib & pneumococcus, candida. All were treated. One preterm patient had self-limiting apnoeas following the procedure. Fourteen (50%) of 28 symptomatic patients had pathogens isolated: Pneumocystis carinii (8), Parainfluenzae 3 (2), CMV (2), HHV6 (1), pseudomonas (1), Hib & E.Coli (1), BCG (1): all were treated. No additional complications were observed. In 1 symptomatic patient, Pneumocystis carinii was demonstrated on BAL, in addition to RSV detected on NPS by immunofluoresence, demonstrating the co-existence of more than 1 pathogen in these patients. A high yield of pathogens was observed in symptomatic patients, 3 of which had more than 1 pathogen. Even in asymptomatic patients, a moderate yield of pathogens was found, which left untreated could have caused significant morbidity during HSCT. A mild adverse effect was seen in only 1 patient (2%). We report a 4-years 7-months-old girl with Niemann-Pick type C disease who received an allogeneic BMT. Her disease presented with prolonged neonatal icter, hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive and progressive neurodevelopmental delay from 2 years ago. Bone marrow biopsy revealed abundant lipid-filled foamy macrophages. Her serum sphingomyelinase assey was normal. She received hematopoietic stem cells from a healthy HLA-identical female sibling, 19 years old, donor. She had neutrophil recovery (WBC>0.5*10 9 /L) at the day of 17th and platelet recovery (platelet>20*10 9 /L) at the day of 33rd after transplantation. She had grade one skin GVHD. She had not any serious infection or complication. She discharged after 38 days. Full engraftment was evidenced by regression of the hepatosplenomegaly, markedly reduced foamy macrophage infiltration in bone marrow and STR-PCR of 90% (Short Tandem Repeat-polymerase chain reaction) at the day of 30th. She has not had any serious problem except three times blood transfusion because of anemia, since transplantation 6 months ago. Her donor has shown symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis disease two months after transplantation. Follow-up will show the long term effect of BMT on her disease and neurocognitive development. S136 P590 A successful haematopoietic engraftment after allogeneic HLA identical bone marrow transplantation without conditioning in a child with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency C. Aytekin, M. Yuksek, F. Dogu, A. Yagmurlu, A. Yildiran, S. Fitoz, M. Kologlu, A. Ikinciogullari, E. Babacan Ankara University School of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency with profound T cell abnormalities and variable B cell function. The disease is characterized by recurrent infections in addition to neurological disorders. The only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here we report a patient with PNP deficiency who was successfully transplanted (HLA matched family donor) without using conditioning regimen. Case: A 13 months old boy was the second child of consanguineous parents. He was invited to our clinic while his brother hospitalized with the diagnosis combined immunodeficiency. His past medical history was unremarkable for immunodeficiency. Neurologic examination showed truncal muscular hypotonia. Immunological investigation revealed combined immunodeficiency. Red blood cell studies showed normal activity of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in the patient and his parents while PNP activity was absent in patient, and 50% of normal in his parents. He received a fully matched bone marrow cells (2.7x10 6 CD34+cell/kg) one year after the diagnosis from his uncle without using a conditioning regimen because of disseminated herpes infection accompanied by profound lymphopenia. He received cyclosporine for GVHD, isoniazid and ciprofloxacin for mycobacterial prophylaxis. He engrafted at posttransplant day 9. Full chimerism in T cells and mixed in myeloid achived. Subsequently disseminated BCG infection (M. bovis) presented with right preauricular and left axiller lymphadenitis, right crural intramuscular and retro peritoneal abscess. The antimycobacterial therapy comprising five agents (isoniazid, rifampicin, clofazimine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin) was initiated. Rifampicin was replaced with ethambutol due to drug induced hemolytic anemia which was developed at 8 months of antimycobacterial therapy. Surgery was needed for right crural intramuscular and retro peritoneal abscess which were not resolved with antimycobacterial therapy. He is now at the first year of BMT with complete immunoreconstitution and has normal receptive language and cognitive abilities. To our knowledge the present PNP deficient patient is the first successfully engrafted case without receiving a conditioning regimen during bone marrow transplantation. Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type B is a clinically heterogeneous disorder usually diagnosed in childhood due to hepatosplenomegaly (HSM). Two mutations of the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene account for approx. 85 % of the alleles in Saudi Arabian NPD patients (pts). These mutations, H421Y in exon 4 and K576N in exon 6 of the ASM gene, confer a severe form of NPD type B with pulmonary involvement and some neurodegeneration. Three patients with such mutations have been transplanted at our institution over the last 6 years. The characteristics are summarized in the following table: Results:Early transplant related problems were little with only limited chronic graft-versus-host disease in pt. #3. Pt. #2 died of sepsis 9 mo. post HSCT with improving HSM but still impaired liver function. Pts. #1 and #3 are well and alive, 6 and 3 years after transplantation. Both demonstrate a decrease of liver and spleen size, and have no cardiac or pulmonary impairment. The development of pt. #1, however, is clearly limited with psychomotor retardation and demyelinating polyneuropathy, whereas pt. #3 displays only a mild spastic gait. Conclusion: These limited data favour the idea that allogeneic transplants can change the course of NPD type B. But the families should know that some neurodegeneration might occur also in type B disease, and cannot completely be prevented by the transplant. Genotyping might help in the future to direct more precisely treatment stratifications in this heterogeneous syndrome.",

Bochtler, S. Schoenland, U. Hegenbart, M. Hundemer, J. Dengler, N. Al Nava, M. Volkmann, A. Ho, H. Goldschmidt University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, D) AL amyloidosis is a plasma cell dyscrasia, which leads to the deposition of immunoglobulin light chains as amyloid. Standard hematologic assessment includes immunofixation of serum and urine as well as the quantification of light chain excretion in the urine and the bone marrow plasma cell content. We analysed the role of serum free light chain (FLC) measurements at first diagnosis and follow-up of patients after autologous transplantation. The overall sensitivity of the FLC test in untreated patients was 93% (42 out of 45 patients) as compared to 96% (43 out of 45 patients) for the combined immunofixation of serum and urine samples. In all cases analysed the monoclonal light chain identified by FLC testing was in accordance with the immunofixation results. Markedly, 2 out of 45 patients with a double negative immunofixation had a diagnostic benefit from the FLC testing, which yielded abnormal ratios in both cases. In the other 43 patients, 29 had a double positive immunofixation and 14 were either positive in urine (n=12) or in serum (n=2). FLC testing displayed an abnormal ratio only in 40 out of these 43 patients. Remission status after high dose melphalan was monitored in 14 patients with a follow-up of more than six months after transplantation. FLC and immunofixation results were in congruence in 11 patients, including 5 CRs and 6 non-CRs for an average follow up of 13 months. In patients with discrepant laboratory results we observed a normalized FLC paralleled by a positive immunofixation in 2 out of 3 patients. This is in accordance to a report published by Sanchorawala et al. (Blood 2004, abstr.) describing a normalisation of the FLC ratio in 25% of patients who had failed to obtain a CR after transplantation as assessed by immunofixation. One of our patients has experienced a gradual improvement of his aberrant FLC ratio from 9.2 initially to 2.6 by 11 months after autologous transplantation whereas immunofixations of serum und urine turned negative by three months. In summary, we did not observe a higher sensitivity of the FLC testing compared to immunofixation as described previously. Therefore both methods seem to be complementary in the assessement of the remission status in patients with AL amyloidosis.",

The quality of CR can be further assessed by monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). In other haematological malignancies disappearance of MRD has been shown to be associated with improved long-term outcome. A sensitive way to measure MRD in MM is with realtime quantitative IgH-PCR with allele-specific oligonucleotides (qASO-PCR). Preliminary observations have shown that PCR negativity after high-dose therapy may result in prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), and PCR has been superior to paraprotein measurements in monitoring MRD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of auto/allografted patients according to their qASO-PCR status after transplantation. Patients and methods: During years 1996-2004 there were 27 patients who after initial debulking therapy received high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m\u00b2) and single (N=13) or double (N=9) autografting, or allografting with myeloablative (N=3) or reduced-intensity conditioning (N=2), and who were in CR or VGPR (IEF positive) after transplantation and had a patientspecific qASO-PCR available for MRD assessment. qASO-PCR was performed usually 3-6 months after transplantation, with follow-up measurements in 8 patients. For most patients, TaqMan probes for qPCR were used; in some patients SYBR Green fluorescence was used. MRD status is ranked \"negative\" if at least one qASO-PCR assessment was found to be negative. Results: There were 14 and 13 patients in the PCR negative and positive groups, respectively. The CR/VGPR rates in the respective groups were 12/2 and 7/6. Median PFS for the PCR negative and positive groups were 39 and 20 months (P=0.098) while median overall survival (OS) has not been reached in the PCR negative group and is 50 months in the PCR positive group (P=0.078).Median follow-up for the living patients is 53 mo. In the patients with negative IEP (N= 14) qASO-PCR turned out to be positive in 36 %. Conclusion: Post-transplant negativity of the patient-specific qASO-PCR seems to predict prolonged PFS and OS in MM. However, the differences in PFS and OS between the PCR positive and negative patient groups remained nonsignificant depending most apparently on the small patient numbers. qASO-PCR is a promising tool to assess the long-term prognosis after stem cell transplantation in patients with MM.",

Recher, F. Rigal Huguet, C. Nouvel, G. Laurent, M. Attal CHU PURPAN (Toulouse, F) The achievement of Complete Response (CR= disappearance of M component by immunofixation) or Very Good Partial Response (VGPR= >90% of M component reduction) is the main prognostic factor for survival after Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) inMultiple Myeloma (MM). High Dose Melphalan (HDM) (200mg/m\u00b2) alone is the recommended preparative regimen before ASCT. However, after HDM alone the rate of CR+VGPR is only 40% to 50%. Velcade (VEL) has demonstrated a significant activity in relapsed/refractory patients, a synergistic effect with Melphalan and a lack of haematological toxicity. Therefore, the combination of Vel and HDM was a logical approach to try to improve the rate of CR+VGPR after ASCT. Between June and August 2005, 10 patients with stage III DS MM have been enrolled. Their main characteristics were: median age = 59 years ; M component= IgG in 6 cases and IgA in 4 cases; chromosome 13 deletion in 4 cases; beta-2 microglobulin >3 mg/l in 5 cases. Five patients were in first partial response (> 50% of M component reduction) after the VAD regimen, 2 patients were in second partial response after the VMCP regimen, and 3 patients were in minimal response (MR) or with a progressive disease (PD) 3 months after a first ASCT prepared with HDM (200 mg/m\u00b2) alone. VEL (1 mg/m\u00b2/d) was delivered on days -6, -3, + 1 and + 4, MEL (200 mg/m\u00b2) was administered on day -2, and blood stem cells (4.6 x 106 CD34/kg) were infused on day 0. The dose of VEL was further increased to 1.3 mg/m\u00b2 for three consecutive patients. Vel was not found to increase the haematological toxicity observed after HDM. The median durations of neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/l) and thrombopenia (< 20 x 109/l) were 7 and 3 days, respectively. Extrahaematological toxicities were limited: grade 3 mucositis in 3 cases and cardiac arrhythmia in 3 cases. Arrhythmia was only observed at the 1.3 mg/m\u00b2 dose level. No toxic death was observed. Three months after ASCT, 6 patients achieved a CR (IF-) and 4 patients a VGPR. Among the 3 patients failing to respond after a first ASCT prepared with HDM alone, 2 CR and 1 VGPR were observed after Vel+HDM. These preliminary results strongly suggest that VEL (1 mg/m\u00b2) and HDM is a safe and highly effective preparative regimen in MM, requiring further investigations.",

D\u00fchrsen University Hospital Essen (Essen, D) Since the publication of the Intergroupe Fran\u00e7ais du My\u00e8lome in 1996 high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous PBSCT is considered to be the standard treatment for patients with multiple myeloma \u2264 65 years. In the following years it was shown that patients up to 70 and even 75 years may also benefit from HDT. Recently it was reported that in a two region population based survey less than half of patients aged 65 years or under received HDT. This surprising results stimulated us to evaluate how patients had been allocated to HCT in our university hospital department. We retrospectively evaluated 143 consecutive patients treated in our department between 1997 and 2005. Eighty patients received at least one cycle of HDT while 63 patients received conventional therapy. Only 19 of 90 patients \u2264 65 years (21 %) did not receive HDT as compared to 57 % in the abovementioned report. In contrast, only 20 % of patients between 66 and 75 five years received HCT. However, not age itself but rather the significant comorbidity was the main reason. While in patients \u2264 65 years the major reasons not to receive HDT were failed mobilization (26 %) and patient decision (16 %) only 11 % had severe comorbidity. In contrast, the reasons not to receive HDT were quite different in patients between 66 and 75 years (43 % severe comorbidity, 23 % patient decision and only 11 % failed mobilisation). When we retrospectively applied the novel Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCTCI) recently published by the Seattle group and the older Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), we could confirm this clear segregation of patients \u2264 65 years and older patients. While the mean HCTCI was 1.0 in patients \u2264 65 years the mean HCTCI was 2.8 in patients > 65 years (p < 0.001) with virtually no differences between 66 -70 years (HCTCI 2.8), 71 -75 years (HCTCI 2.9) and patients > 76 years (HCTCI 2.5). The CCI gave similar but somewhat less discriminating results. The conclusions from our results are threefold. First comorbidity rises sharply above an age of 65. Secondly, routine clinical assessment of patients' comorbidity correlates well with comorbidity indices, especially with the HCTCI. Finally, the use of HCTCI as a tool for treatment allocation is strongly encouraged to improve the comparability of patients, transplantation centers and treatment modalities.",

Nunziata, C. De Rosa, L. Mettivier A.O.R.N. \"A. Cardarelli\" (Naples, I) High dose therapy with single or double transplantation (auto-SCT) has improved prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM). Thalidomide (thal) is an active drug in the treatment of myeloma, and is been investigated as first line therapy. It could be useful in the control of minimal residual disease. We used thal as maintenance after autologous transplantation (single or double) and compare the outcome with other maintenance or none. From January 2001 to November 2005 21 patients (10 males and 11 females) with MM have been treated in our institution. Median age was 58 years (range 51-72). 9 were IgG, 6 IgA, 3 light chains and 2 plasma-cell leukaemia. Treatment was 4 cycles of VAD regimen followed by auto-SCT. 10/21 performed double auto-SCT. 3 months after SCT, 11 patients (6 single and 5 double SCT) began thal 50 mg/die as maintenance therapy. 10 patients (5 single and 5 double SCT) received IFN-g (3/10), dexa (3/10) or no therapy (4/10). The 2 groups were regarding the type of myeloma: 5 IgG, 2 IgA, 3 light chains and 1 plasma-cell leukaemia in the thal group; 4 IgG, 4 IgA, 1 IgD and 1 plasmacell leukaemia in the other. Response to SCT: 3 CR, 7 PR and 1 NR in the thal group; 5 CR, 4 PR and 1 NR in the other. In the thal group 3/11 patient relapsed. Median follow up from the beginning of maintenance therapy was 30 months (range 9-46) with 7/10 patients in CR or stable disease, with a progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) projected at 47 months of 73%. In the other group, 8/10 patients relapsed. Median follow up was 30 months (range 4-54) with a median PFS and OS of 8 and 18 months respectively. The difference between the 2 groups is statistically significant for PFS (p: 0,007), and not significant for OS (p: 0,057) even if difference (73% vs. 0%) appears clear. (Graph.1-2) . From diagnosis the median OS is of 72 months in no thal group and is 73% projected at 100 months in the thal group (Graph 3). Thal was administered for a median period of 12 months, being neurological toxicity the main reason of suspension (3/10 patients). Neurological toxicity grade I-III was present in 65% of patients, while haematological toxicity grade I occur in 55% of patients. In conclusion,low dose thal as maintenance after auto-SCT resulted in an improved PFS and OS when compared with other or none maintenance, with acceptable toxicity. Further studies in larger cohorts and randomized trials are needed to confirm this experience.",

In order to evaluate its efficacy in disease control and its toxicity profile compared to conventional dose (CD) allo-transplant (CD-tx), 19 consecutive MM patients who underwent allo-tx at our Center between 1993 and 2005 were reviewed. Patients and methods Group A = CD-tx included 13 pts, median age 42 yrs (range 32-53); conditioning regimen 12/13 CTX+TBI, 1/13 ATG-BU-Mel; disease status at tx: CR 3/13, PR 9/13, SD 1/13. Group B = RIC-tx included 6 pts, median age 56 yrs (range 55-64); conditioning regimen TT+Fluda+Mel; disease status at tx: CR 2/6, PR 4/6. Group A: 6/9 PR pts achieved CR; at 54 mos (range 10-136) median follow-up 11/13 are alive with a Karnofsky score > 90%. The pt with SD progressed 8 months after tx and died two months later; one pt in CR after tx experienced relapse at 20 mos and died 23 mos later; one pt relapsed and one pt progressed 119 and 44 months after tx respectively. Group B: all pts achived full chimerism; 2/4 PR pts achieved CR; at 16.5 mos (range 5-24) median follow-up all pts are alive, 3/6 with a Karnofsky score < 90%. Disease progression was observed in 2/6 pts, both in PR, and, in one case, it occurred in spite of extended cGVHD. FIG 1 In both groups TRM was 0%.; aGVHD (grade II in all cases) occurred in 38% (5/13) in group A, vs 17% (1/6) in group B; extended cGVHD, occurred in 15% (2/13) vs 50% (3/6) pts, respectively; in group A: one pt developed late VOD and P Carynii pneumonia; 5/13 experienced CMV reactivation, none developed CMV disease; sepsis occurred in 1 pt. Among group B pts, 2/6 were admitted to the hospital because of recurrent sepsis; CMV reactivation occurred in 4/6 pts,1/4 progressed to CMV pneumonia; in 2/6 pts, significant DLCO reduction was recorded. In our experience, it seems that MM relapse/progression may be better controlled by CD-tx rather then RIC-tx. Moreover, the higher incidence of extended cGVHD, recorded among RIC-tx pts (50% vs 17%), contributes to increase morbidity and reduces performance status without a clear effect vs disease. Our data need to be confirmed in a larger series of patients with longer follow-up in order to better evaluate both the effect and the real impact of toxicity on patient's life expectancy in RIC-tx. As of now, our policy is to offer RIC alloTX as an opportunity for patients who are really not eligible to conventional Allo-TX rather than considering it as an approach alternative to CD allo tx.",

Jantunen, T. Kuittinen, K. Penttil\u00e4, P. Lehtonen, E. Mahlam\u00e4ki, T. Nousiainen Kuopio University Hospital (Kuopio,FIN) Although the median age of the patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is over 65 years, limited information is available on the feasibility and efficacy of high-dose therapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in this age group. Altogether 22 MM patients \u2265 65 years (median 68, eight > 70 years) and 79 MM patients < 65 years (median 57) were included into identical treatment protocol in 1995-2005. The first progenitor cell mobilisation was successful in 95% and 97% of the patients, respectively. Until now 92 patients have received MEL200 supported by ASCT. No early deaths were observed among 22 elderly patients, while one younger patient died early due to treatment-related reasons. Engraftment as well as the need for supportive care was comparable between these age groups. The elderly patients tended to have more often WHO grade 3-4 mucosal or gastrointestinal toxicity (45% vs. 23%, P=0.06). After ASCT a complete remission was observed in 44% of the elderly patients and in 36% of the younger patients, respectively. No sugnificant differences were observed between these age groups in the median progression free survival (22 vs. 21 months) or overall survival (57 vs. 66 months). We conclude that MEL200 is safe and effective also in selected elderly myeloma patients but limited information is available in patients more than 70 years of age. Prevention of mucositis might be of importance especially in the elderly patients. ",

On the other hand, both SWOG staging system and ISS were feasible for OS from day of diagnosis either at diagnosis (p=0.0207, p=0.0105, respectively) or at APBSCT (p=0.0198, p=0.0054, respectively). PFS from day of APBSCT was not predicted by all DS staging system (p=0.1644 and 0.5731), SWOG staging system (p=0.2660 and 0.2817) and ISS (p=0.2233 and 0.1167) both at diagnosis and at APBSCT, respectively. Alike OS from day of diagnosis, DS staging system was meaningless not only at diagnosis but also at APBSCT (p=0.2542, p=0.5426, respectively) for OS from day of APBSCT. Although ISS for OS from day of APBSCT showed similar tendency with ISS for OS from day of diagnosis either at diagnosis (p=0.0207) and at APBSCT (p=0.0198), SWOG staging system not at diagnosis (p=0.0553) but at APBSCT (p=0.0392) was predictive for OS from day of APBSCT. In this study, PFS and OS after APBSCT were influenced by the stages according to SWOG or ISS, but not DS. Moreover, staging evaluation at the time of diagnosis was correlated with survival comparing with stages at the time of APBSCT. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite progress in treatment strategies the median survival rate remains pure, approaching two to three years. Recently, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation has been introduced as a first-line therapy. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize autologous T cells that are reactive against multiple myeloma and to test their anti-cancer potential in 10 patients with MM. Irradiated myeloma cells from patients with MM has been used as tumor antigen. Autologous dendritic cells prepared in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were loaded with tumor antigen matured and served as specific stimulators (using two rounds of weekly stimulations) of autologous T cells.",

Dalva (1) The initial results published between 1972-1992 based on serological HLA antigen frequencies have revealed controversial results for an association between HLA B5, HLA B13, 18, Cw2 myeloma . Moreover the only two published reports analyzing the frequency of HLA Class II antigens were not informative either. The progress in HLA typing have prompted us to re-evaluate the role of HLA Class I and II in Multiple Myeloma. Patients: In this study we will present the frequency of HLA ClassI(AB) and II(DR) specificities among 92 MM patients diagnosed at our center (n=66) or in a different center in Ankara(n= 26) in comparison to a control group of 328 healthy subjects . Control subjects were chosen among our donor population, siblings were discarded to prevent haplotype accumulation. Methods: Patients and controls were typed by cytotoxicity assay and /or by DNA based typing for class I(MM:92,Control:320); Class II alleles were typed by PCR-SSP or PCR-SSO at low resolution (MM:69, control:175). For statistical analysis SSPS for Windows 11.5 was used. For comparison of frequencies between patients and controls Chi Square analysis and Odds Ratios(OR) were done. Results: When single antigen frequencies were evaluated none of the HLA A, but HLAB 51(OR:0,528 p=0,04)were significantly lower in patient group, HLA B 35(OR:1,577 p=0,061), HLA DR04(OR:0,516 p=0,076) differances were not significant . When combinations of the Class I and II antigens which were selected based on the results of previous studies or in our single antigen frequencies we found B35 DR11 (OR=3,051,p=0,004), A3 B51 (OR=0,296, p=0,06), A11 B35 DR11 (OR=3,839, p=0,042), A24 B35 DR11 (OR=3.180,p=0,053) to be more frequent among patients. Homozygocity for these antigens were also found to be significantly more common among myeloma patients: A2(OR=7.614 p=0,01), B35(OR=19,630 p=0,001<), DR11(OR=14,667 p=0.009). Conclusion: This consistency support the role of HLA A2, B 35, DR 11 as susceptibility and HLA B51 and HLA DR04 as protective antigens. Our results add to the findings of Ludwig(1982) . Recently a membrane bound antigen MUC1,which is a prognostic factor, has been found to be presented by HLA A2 and to induce T cell responses in myeloma patients (Witzens,2005) . In our experience among the six allotransplanted patients only two were long term survivors and both shared B51 and DR04. These results are promising for evaluation of HLA in transplant outcome.",

Fenk, N. Hieronimus, U. Steidl, I. Bruns, T. Graef, F. Zohren, L. Ruf, R. Haas, G. Kobbe Heinrich-Heine-University (Duesseldorf, D) Objective: Pegfilgrastim has shown to decrease the duration of severe neutropenia after conventional chemotherapy, but its use after high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) has not been established yet. Therefore we studied the efficacy and the pharmacokinetic profile of pegfilgrastim in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing HDT. Methods: In total, 21 patients received a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg pegfilgrastim on day +1 after SCT and G-CSF plasma levels were measured daily. Duration of neutropenia was compared with data of a historical group of patients without G-CSF support, which were matched for number of infused CD34+ cells, age and disease status before SCT. Results: The median duration of grade 4 neutropenia was significantly shorter in the pegfilgrastim group in comparison to the historical control group with 6 and 11 days, respectively (p < 0.001). In the same way time to engraftment was significantly faster in the pegfilgrastim group with 10 days versus 15 days in the control group (p < 0.001). Within the pegfilgrastim group, patients susceptible for G-CSF stimulation could be identified by quintubled absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) the day after pegfilgrastim administration and these patients had a significantly (p = 0.006) shorter duration of neutropenia (median 5 days) in comparison to patients who responded with a lower augmentation of ANC (median 8 days). The median G-CSF level peaked at day +4 (94 ng/ml; range: 37-205) and was sustained until day +7 (85 ng/ml; range: 35-186). G-CSF levels after pegfilgrastim administration were subject to ANC at the same time. In all but 3 patients maximum levels were reached only after the ANC was < 0.5 x 10 9 /L and G-CSF levels of all patients dropped below 20 ng/ml about the day of neutrophil recovery. As a consequence of neutrophil mediated clearance the maximum G-CSF serum levels of each patient depended on the ANC at day +2. Patients with ANC > 10 x 10 9 /L at day +2 had significantly (p = 0.02) lower G-CSF levels (median 91 ng/ml) than patients with less ANC (median 140 ng/ml). However, there was no correlation of G-CSF levels and duration of neutropenia. Conclusion: Neutrophil engraftment after HDT can be accelerated by the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with myeloma. Responsiveness of neutrophils to pegfilgrastim before neutropenia is correlated with neutrophil engraftment, whereas G-CSF levels had no impact on neutrophil recovery.",

            "text": "Cancer-testis antigens are frequently expressed in multiple myeloma and induce immune responses following allogeneic stem cell transplantation D. Atanackovic, J. Arfsten, Y. Cao, C. Wolschke, K. Bartels, C. Faltz, A.R. Zander, C. Bokemeyer, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) Background: Despite the introduction of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation into the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) recurrences are frequent due to minimal residual disease. MM-specific immunotherapies could represent a potentially useful treatment option in these patients. Cancer-testis (CT) antigens, the expression of which is restricted to cancer and the human germ line, might be promising targets for antigenspecific immunotherapy in MM. In addition, it seems possible that CT antigens also represent natural targets for graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects following allogeneic transplantation. Methods: We analyzed the expression of 11 CT antigens in bone marrow samples from patients with stage II-III MM (N=55) and from healthy donors (N=20) using RT-PCR. Furthermore, we analyzed antibody and T cell responses against MAGEA3, MAGEE1, and NY-ESO-1 in these patients and in 20 MM patients in remission following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Results: Most CT antigens were frequently expressed in bone marrow from MM patients with 56% (MAGEE1), 55% (MAGEA3), 35% (SSX1), 20% (SSX4, SSX5), 16% (SSX2), 15% (BAGE), 7% (NY-ESO-1), and 6% (ADAM2, LIP1) expressing the given CT antigen. SSX3 was negative in all samples. With the exception of SSX4, positive in 20% of samples, none of the antigens were expressed in healthy bone marrow. We rarely observed antibody-mediated immune responses against CT antigens in patients who were chemotherapy-na\u00efve, who had received chemotherapy alone or who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. In contrast, we found strong and persistent antibody responses against SSX2 and NY-ESO-1 in single patients who had received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Humoral immunity was accompanied by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the same antigen. Importantly, these responses had not been present pre-transplantation and were not detectable in the stem cell donor's peripheral blood. Conclusions: We show here that CT antigens are strongly expressed in MM. Importantly, CT antigens are capable of eliciting spontaneous humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses in these patients. This is especially the case in patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation, indicating that these antigens might represent targets for GvL effects. These immune responses could be boostered by antigen-specific immunotherapy which might help to achieve long-lasting remissions in patients with MM. To reduce GVHD after alloSCT, the feasibility and transplant related mortality (TRM) of CD34 selected alloSCT was explored. Eleven MM patients (pts, 7 with beta2microglobulin >2.5 and del 13, 4 with 1 of these pronostic factors, 1 with plasmocytic leukemia) underwent alloSCT following TBI 12 Gy, thiotepa, SAL and cyclophosphamide with matched sibling donors (n=10) or matched unrelated donor (n=1). For two pts, donor stem cell collection was too low to allow CD34+ cell selection. Prior alloSCT, 3 pts were in CR, 7 in PR and 1 in progress. For the 9 pts receiving CD34 selected cell, a median of 7.86 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (range 4.9-16.4) with mean purity of 96.3% was infused. Those pts had sustained both neutrophil (>0.1 x 10 9 /L) and platelet recovery (>20 x 10 9 /L) with a median time to engraftment of 12 days. Total donor chimerism was reached in 6/9 pts within 3 months. Six of the 9 CD34 selected cell transplanted pts presented EBV reactivation at a median of 62 days (range 37-145). Three of them developed to EBV-LPD. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI; n=2) and/or Rituximab (n=5) overcame EBV reactivation or LPD in 5 pts. One EBV-LPD progressed in a patient despite of DLI and rituximab. CMV reactivation was observed in two pts. DLI (1 x 107/kg CD3+ cells, the thawed CD34 negative fraction of donor SCT cells) was performed for 6 pts: 3 for MM relapse, 2 for EBV-lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) and 1 for EBV reactivation non responding to rituximab. Acute GVHD (\u2265 II) responses were observed after DLI in 4 pts of them. None pt treated with DLI for MM relapse responded. After a median follow-up of 225 days for surviving pts (range 113-1491), 7 pts out of 11 (6 grafted with CD34+ cells, 1 with unselected cells) are alive, 5 are in CR, 1 in PR, 1 in progress. The probability of one year survival is 65 %. TRM at one year is 9%. Causes of death are progression of myeloma in 2 pts, multivisceral failure in 1 pt, GVHD in 1 pt (unselected graft). Although the pts included in this trial had particularly bad prognosis and had a short follow-up, CD34 alloSCT is associated with a low nonrelapse mortality and has some efficacy in pts responding to prior chemotherapy.",

Pitini (1) Bortezomib is a specific inhibitor of the 26s proteasome and has profound effects on both Multiple Myeloma (MM) tumor cells and stromal cells in the bone marrow micro-environment. Its efficacy is increased with the addition of dexamethasone and it demonstrates synergy with doxorubicin, thus providing the rational for a combination therapy (PAD); a pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet) could potentially extend the duration of malignant plasma cell exposure to the therapeutic levels of Doxorubicin, so, increased exposure of MM patients (pts.) to doxorubicin could improve the response rates. Here, we report the results of a pilot study using a chemotherapy protocol which combines bortezomib 1.3mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (30 mg/m\u00b2) on day 1 and oral or intravenous dexamethasone (40 mg per day for 4 days) for four 21 day cycles before mobilization with Cyclophosphamide at a dose of 5g/m\u00b2 and G-CSF (10 mg/Kg/d).

(4 males and 2 females, median age of 50 years) were enrolled. After bortezomib, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and dexamethasone there were four complete remissions (CR), one nCR and one SD. All pts. underwent attempted PBSC mobilization and 5 out of 6 mobilized, with a median of 3.50 x 106 CD34+cells /Kg collected with a median of 2 (range 1-4) collection procedures. All 5 pts. received high-dose melphalan with stem cell transplantation. The median time to reach neutrophil and platelet regeneration was 13.5 days and 13 days. To date all the five pts. are alive and in CR. In the light of these promising preliminary date we feel it is appropriate that this induction therapy is explored further in prospective randomised phase III trials.",

In patients with poor performance status at transplant or previous history of infection or renal impairment the total dose of melphalan was reduced of 20% respect to the full standard planned dose. At the day + 90 from transplant, 17 of 25 patients were in CR or PR (68%) (group A); in this series the actuarial probability of survival and event free survival at 5 years were 40% and 20% respectively( one patient died of transplant and one developed solid tumour 24 months after transplant). In the second group (group B) the actuarial probability of survival was 50% at 5 years, the event free survival 28%. In the third group (group C) the overall survival and event free survival was respectively 48% and 20%.

We have evaluated the changes in lymphoid cells subsets induced by chemotherapy, in the attempt to explore the path of these complications. We performed lymphocyte and leukocyte count, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subset, natural killer cells (CD56+), CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ and CD19+ B-cells evaluation by multiparameter flow cytometry. We studied 45 patients enrolled in a program including two autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells transplant (HSCT), taking peripheral blood samples at diagnosis, before mobilizing chemotherapy, before stem cells infusions, at 180 and 360 days after the last HSCT. During the study 17 major infectious (bacterial) episodes have been recorded, during aplastic phase of treatment. We observed that the number of CD19+ cells (expressed as cells to kg of body mass) decrease after induction therapy (IT) then recover after HSCT. The CD3+ cells decrease after IT and increase after HSCT, returning to normal levels within 6 months. The CD4+ number decreases along the treatment period, without recover after cells infusion. The number of CD8+ progressively increases throughout the study time despite treatment. The levels of CD56 cells is sharply reduced by chemoterapy and do not increase after HSCT. The CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ subsets of CD4+ cells decrease progressively up to 12 months after HSCT. Our results show that immunological recovery is very poor, if any, for a long time after aggressive chemotherapy, despite HSCT and leukocyte recover, even if the major infectious complications seems be linked to neutropenia. Nevertheless a selective depression on innate and T arm of immune system is probable. The recovery from memory cells seems poor for the reduction of CD45RO+ CD4+ lymphocytes and a new expansion of na\u00efve cells in the first year after HSCT is not found. The B cells behaviour could means a recovery to S143 normal value, but, as the lack of T regulatory subsets would suggests, could express a derangement of humoral arm.",

Leone Universit\u00e0 Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore (Rome, I) POEMS is a rare multisystemic paraneoplastic syndrome, the acronym refers to Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M protein, Skin changes. Major diagnostic criteria include: Polyneuropathy and Monoclonal plasmacell proliferative disorder, and minor criteria Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Skin changes, Edema, Papilledema, Castelman disease, Sclerotic bone lesions. Patients (pts) must have all major criteria and at least 1 of minor criteria. In this study 3 pts affected by POEMS syndrome were treated with high dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (aPBSCT). Pts were M/F 2/1, age 61-44-52 ys. At diagnosis all pts had a severe, rapidly progressive sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy, involving extremities, with inability to walk. All pts had monoclonal component (MC) IgA\u00eb and 1 had also MC IgG\u00eb.

All pts presented melanosis. 1 patient had splenomegaly, and 1 hepatomegaly. One pt had sclerotic bone lesion. None showed positive periumbilical fat biopsy. 1 pt had significantly abnormal pulmonary function before aPBSCT. Pts received Cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1,3 and Methylprednisolon 250 mg from day 1-4 for 2 cycles and G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/die was added after 2 cycle for mobilization. 2 pts were previously treated with high dose Ig i.v. and steroids in the neurologic unit.

The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 4.22 (range 3.08-5.63) x 106/kg. Engraftment was rapid and sustained. After a median followup of 19 months (range 18-30), all pts are alive with slow but progressive improvement in neurological disease, skin changes, performance status and without evidence of plasmacytosis. Organomegaly was resolved in both cases. Negativization of MC was observed in 1 pt. Pt with sclerotic bone lesion received radiotherapy (dose 5000 cGy) as consolidation. Our experience confirms that HDMel and aPBSCT is feasible and efficacious and should be the treatment of choice for POEMS, arresting and even reversing the disease course. Early diagnosis is important to obtain best response and improve clinical outcome. aPBSCT might be safely be performed at experienced transplant centers combined to neurological expertise.",

Kata, S. Krzemien, K. Nowak, J. Holowiecki Silesian Medical Academy (Katowice, PL) POEMS syndrome is a very rare multisystem disorder characterized by clonal plasma cell proliferation, peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy and skin changes. So far, no standard treatment has been defined. To our knowledge, there has also been no report on leukemic form of this disease. Here, we present a 47-year-old woman who developed plasma cell leukemia associated with sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy predominating in the lower limbs, hepatosplenomegaly, hypothyroidism and multiple cutaneous angiomas. At the presentation in November 2002 peripheral blood examination showed mild hyperleukocytosis (24 x 10 9 /l) with 41% of lymphoplasmatic cells in the smear. A bone marrow (BM) aspirate contained 100% atypical plasma cells showing bright expression of the CD38 and CD138 antigens. Immunoelectophoresis revealed monoclonal (M) IgG-lambda protein (44 g/l) in the serum. The patient achieved complete remission (negative immunofixation and negative minimal residual disease assesed by flow cytometry analysis) following 4 courses of VAD (vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone) chemotherapy and all of the symptoms of POEMS syndrome subsided. Peripheral blood stem cells were subsequently collected following IVE (ifosphamide/etoposide/epirubicin) + G-CSF mobilization regimen. Double autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) was performed in August and October 2003 preceded by high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m\u00b2) and CAV (cyclophosphamide/cytarabine/etoposide) conditioning regimens, respectively. No severe complications were observed during the posttransplantation course. After 12 months the patient relapsed with BM involvement and the reemergence of the M-component, however, without reappearance of other features associated with the disease. The patient received salvage therapy consisted of thalidomide (200 mg dayly) and eight cycles of bortezomib (1.3mg/m\u00b2 twice weekly for 2 weeks followed by an interval of 10-12 days) in combination with dexamethasone, achieving stable partial remission observed one year after relapse. In conclusion, our case indicates that AHCT for POEMS syndrome should be considered even in patients with disseminated disease. Bortezomib in combination with thalidomide and dexamethasone may induce good quality response in case of relapse following AHCT.",

The primary objective of this investigation was to compare the overall response rates and toxicity of the standard regimen VAD-D-D and regimen HyperCVAD for first line treatment patients with multiple myeloma III stage (high cell mass). Staging was accomplished by means of the Durie and Salmon system , Durie and Salmon PLUS system and International Myeloma Working Group staging system simultaneously. First group consist of 20 patients (62\u00b14 years) which received 2-6 standard regimens VAD-D-D every 28 days. Second group consist of 20 patients (57\u00b13 years) which received 2-6 standard regimens HyperCVAD (Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. twice 1-3 days, vincristine 2 mg i.v. day 1 and 9, doxorubicine 50 mg/m\u00b2 i.v. day 4, dexametazone 40 mg per os 1-4 and 9-12 days) every 28 days.

An objective response (complete or partial) was documented in 40% and 60% of patients treated with VAD and HyperCVAD, respectively. Hematological and non-hematological toxicities were mild or moderate and equally distributed between the two treatment arms with the exception of neutropenia III-IV, which was more common after HyperCVAD (90%). The duration of neutropenia was from 5 to 9 days. 3 (30%) patients had febrile neuthropenia. Early death was in first and second groups 5% and 0% respectively. Project 3 years overall survival was 65% and 90% in VAD and HyperCVAD groups respectively. These preliminary date suggest that regimen HyperCVAD more effective than standard regimen VAD.",

Linderholm Link\u00f6ping University Hospital (Link\u00f6ping, S) Introduction: Systemic amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a clonal plasma cell disorder causing deposition of light chain amyloid in various organs. Kidney involvement may result in nephrotic syndrome. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk factor for thromboembolism and are often treated with anti-coagulants, e.g. warfarin. AL amyloidosis may also be complicated by loss of coagulation factors, especially factor X, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Currently, stem cell collection and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered the best treatment option for eligible patients. Case reports: We report two serious bleedings during and after stem cell mobilization. Both patients had warfarin substituted for low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) during treatment with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 2 g/m\u00b2 and filgrastim 10 mg/kg /day s.c. On the fourth day of filgrastim the first patient, a 61-year old woman, experienced sudden pain in her left shoulder. Her hypotension was aggravated, anemia and anuria ensued and she died two days after onset of symptoms. Autopsy revealed a large subcapsular hepatic bleeding with signs of a possible older bleeding. In the second patient, a 65-year old man, filgrastim was given for six days. During treatment with LMWH the APT-time was prolonged at 35 seconds (normal 23-31). Two days after discontinuation of filgrastim and LMWH he had sudden pain and distension of the abdomen. A CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma. Hemoglobin dropped from 150 to 85 g/L in less than 24 hours. He made a quick recovery after transfusions and conservative treatment. In both patients amyloid deposits in tissues may have contributed to the bleedings. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that patients with AL amyloidosis should be treated with LMWH only after careful consideration, especially in conjunction with stem cell mobilization.",

We have studied here the impact of marrow fibrosis n patients with myeloma on other clinical parameters and overall survival. This study included 38F:22;M: 16) patients with myeloma between May 1995 and March 2005.At diagnosis all patients underwent bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy along with routine haematological, biochemical and radiological investigations. Conventional staining for cellular components included haematoxylin and eosin (H& E). Reticulin silver impregnation staining is employed as standard matrix stain. Bone marrow reticulin is quantified as Grade0 to Grade 4.Reticulin staining>2 was considered increased. Patients received either intensive or non intensive anti-myeloma therapy as per standard practise. Overall Survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Median age at diagnosis was 65.3yrs and the median follow up period was 16 months.21 patients had IgGmyeloma,7patients had IgA myeloma,6patients had LC myeloma and one each patient had IgM myeloma, IgD myeloma, Plasma cell leukaemia and Amyloidosis. 20 patients received VADchemotherapy, 6patients had Melphalan therapy, 5patients were not given any therapy, 3patients received single agent Cyclophosphamide and 2 patients each received steroids and single agent thalidomide as initial therapy.Marrow reticulin was increased in 25patients and normal in 13 patients. Haemoglobin <8gms/dl was observed in 24% patients. 74%patients were positive for Bence-Jones proteinuria. 21 patients required single line of therapy during the study period, where as 12 patients needed more than one line of therapy. Bone marrow reticulin, sex of the patient, presence of Bence-Jones protein, presence of renal failure at diagnosis did not impact on the overall survival,where as Hb<8gm/ dl, raised serum calcium and elevated\u00e22M at diagnosis was associated with poor overall survival.marrow reticulin had no effect on the requirement for more than one line of therapy. Bone marrow fibrosis at diagnosis does not impact on the overall survival in patients with myeloma. Marrow fibrosis also does not predict the need for more than one line of therapy in patients with myeloma. Our study also confirms the poor prognostic role of anaemia,hypercalcemia and elevated\u00e22Mlevels in patients with myeloma. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

Bacigalupo for the GITMO Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) was introduced to reduce toxicity, and has proved a feasible procedure for patients not eligible for conventional transplantation. In 2001 S145 we designed a new RIC protocol for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). It included thiotepa 5 mg/kg, fludarabine 3 x 30 mg/m 2 and melphalan 80 mg/m 2 and an attenuate GVHD prophylaxis. We present here the results in 53 patients (M=35, F= 18; age 38-68 y, median 52), transplanted from their HLAidentical siblings. The majority (N=43) had advanced disease and 33 one or more previous autograft(s). A small cohort (N=10) was allografted soon after the diagnosis following 3 VAD. Stem cell source was G-CSF-primed PB in 44, BM in 8 and PB+BM in 1. With a median of 5.4 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells and 2.5 x 10 8 /kg CD3+ cells infused as graft, PMN 0.5 and platelet 50 x 10 9 /L were recovered on day +14. Acute GVHD grade II-IV occurred in 24 (45%) patients, but was grade II-IV only in 3. Chronic GVHD incidence was 77% at 2 y, but TRM was 12%. Following allograft, 62% patients were in CR and 28% in PR. With a median FU of 22 mo, median OS is 30 mo, and PFS 18 mo. OS is 44% and PFS 37% at 3 y. The following factors were analysed for TRM, OS and PFS: age (\u2264 vs >52 y), sex, Ig type (IgGk vs others), previous autograft(s), status at allograft (responding vs non-responding), time to allograft (< vs \u2265 12 mo), beta2-micro level (< vs \u2265 3.5 mg/L), allogeneic as front-line, sex-matching (F don and M rec vs other combinations), CD3+ and CD34+ cells/kg in the graft, CR after allograft, acute GVHD (none or I vs II-IV) and chronic GVHD. On multivariate analysis no factor was associated with TRM. Transplant front-line (p=0.0074), CR post-allograft (p=0.0015) and chronic GVHD (p=0.0294) were factors for OS, while attainment of CR post-allograft was the only factor (p=0.0127) for PFS. PCR (IgH-gene rearrangement) on BM samples (patients specific probes) was negative (at least once) in only 5 out of the 14 CR patients studied. Four of the 9 PCR-pos patients in contrast with none of the PCR-neg patients have relapsed till now. The combination of thiotepa, fludarabine and melphalan is a valuable RIC protocol, that may produce a high rate of response with minimal toxicity. What appears to be prognostically important in this category of patients is CR attainment. These data confirm that an effort should be addressed at improving the conditioning in order to acquire a better response without a rise in TRM.",

Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) The quantitative assay for free light chains [FLC] has been reported to be sensitive and specific for detecting and monitoring free light chain diseases such as multiple myeloma. To evaluate the sensitivity of FLC for monitoring patients in complete remission for early detection of relapse, the measurement of more than 250 serum free light chains were performed with the commercial available Freelite TM kit [Binding Site] in 26 patients who achieved complete remission with negative immunofixation after dose reduced allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient groups were divided in those who remained immunofixation negative [n=12, group 1] during follow-up of at least 1 year and those who had been immunofixation negative but became positive during follow-up [n=9, group 2] and those who had achieved near complete remission with positive immunofixation but then became immunofixation negative during follow-up [n=5, group 3]. In group 1 the measuring of 105 FLC concentration and kappa/lambda ratio was performed in 12 patients. In 10 patients [83 %] free light concentration of kappa or lambda remained within the normal range during follow-up of more than 1 year. In 2 patients [17 %] kappa or lambda FLC concentration was above the normal range, but remained stable without any signs of increasing amount. Group 2 consisted of 9 patients who had been immunofixation negative but became positive during follow-up. In all patients an increase of the corresponding free light chain could be observed in serum. In 4 patients a very close monitoring of immunofixation and free light assay was performed and an at least 25 % increase of the free light concentration in serum was observed at a median of 97 days before immunfixation became positive. In group 3 five patients who had been immunofixation positive became negative during follow-up. In all of the patients the free light concentration was within the range at time of negative immunofixation. The corresponding free light concentration dropped down and reached normal level at a median of 38 days before the patients had achieved negativity of immunofixation. These results suggest that serum free light chain assay allows monitoring of patients with complete remission and might detect early relapse before immunofixation becomes positive, thus FLC might be an useful guide for adoptive immunotherapy strategies to prevent clinical relapse.",

Cortes-Dericks, S. Schwartz, A. Badbaran, B. Fehse, A.R. Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) Highly sensitive methods are essential to an accurate diagnosis of minimal residual disease (MRD) in multiple myeloma (MM). Recent studies have indicated that nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using patient-specific primers to identify rearrangement of immunoglobulin-heavychain sequences (ASO-primers) and multi-parametric flow cytometry (FCM) to detect phenotypical aberrations of plasma cells (PC) are equally reliable techniques in this case. Here we performed a comparative analysis of those two and a third method which assesses lineage-specific (plasma cell) chimerism by real-time PCR based on bi-allelic sequencenucleotide polymorphism regarding their sensitivity to detect MRD. We investigated thirty seven bone marrow (BM) samples from 30 MM-confirmed patients at different time points after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All samples were analysed by real-time PCR for chimerism analysis and by FCM using a quadruple panel consisting of CD38/CD56/CD19/CD45 following the SSC/CD38+++/CD138+ gating strategy. For FCM an MRD threshold value of \u2265 0.01% of the total white blood cells (WBC) for PC with phenotypical aberrations was used. Eight samples were tested with patient-specific PCR using ASOprimers. FCM and ASO-primer PCR results correlated very well in all 10 samples tested (3 positive and 7 negative MRD cases, Table 1 ). Also, all nine samples which were positive for MRD using FCM (0.02% -1.41%) revealed a PC chimerism of <99.7% (0.00% -99.6%). In contrast, only seven of the 28 samples with no detectable MRD (by FCM) showed a PC chimerism below 99.9% (96.4% -99.7%), but 21 of the 28 samples had a full donor chimerism of >99.9% in the PC department. The present report summarizes the comparison of 3 different methods in the evaluation of MRD in MM. It shows that FCM is as sensitive as the patient-specific ASO-PCR. We have seen a correlation between FCM and PC chimerism data in all MRD cases, but mixed chimerism was not predictive for MRD. Obviously, chimerism kinetics would be much more reliable. In conclusion, we suggest that multi-parametric FCM can be regarded as an effective surrogate method in addition to PCR (supposed to be the most sensitive tool) in monitoring of MRD in MM patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

            "text": "Reliable monitoring of minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma: how specific is flow cytometry?! M.V. Lioznov, L. Cortes-Dericks, B. Fehse, A.R. Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) Recent studies have indicated that flow cytometry (FCM) is a sensitive tool to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Although this approach has been shown to allow a reliable prediction of MRD, its specificity has not been proven yet. To detect aberrant plasma cells (aPC) based on their phenotypical characteristics, we applied a quadruple panel consisting of CD38/CD56/CD19/CD45 following the SSC/CD38+++/CD138+ gating strategy described by Rawstron (2002) . We investigated 13 BM samples from healthy donors as control and 12 BM samples from 10 MMconfirmed patients. Surprisingly, in normal control subjects we detected a cell population mimicking the phenotypic aberrations (CD38+/-CD56+CD19-CD45-) characteristic for myelomatous cells. Indeed, we found that cells in all of the 13 BMs from healthy donors displayed the immunophenotype typical for MM. The median percentage of these \"positive\" cells from healthy donors ranged from 0.001% to 0.05% as related to the entire white blood cell (WBC) population. This corresponded to 0.11% -8.51% of the entire plasma cell (PC) population (Table 1a) . This data is in conflict with the broadly used threshold value for MRD, which is, based on a proposal of Rawstron et al. (2002) , set at 0.01%. In fact, in 8 of our 13 healthy donors we detected between 0.02% to 0.05% \"aberrant cells\". This was not only higher than the above mentioned threshold for MRD but equalled or exceeded the values for three of the 12 probes from MM-confirmed patients ( Table 1b. ). The presence of cells in the bone marrow mimicking a pathological phenotype is not unusual. Kern et al. (2003) reported the observation of immunophenotypic aberrations characteristic for AML cells in the BM of healthy donors. The presence of cells with pathological markers typical for CLL in normal blood has also been reported (B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2004 ). The frequency of those pseudo-malignant cells in the samples of healthy individuals has been considered in the definition of cut-off values allowing a reliable diagnosis of MRD in both types of leukemia. Considering our data, it appears that the simultaneous investigation of BM from healthy donors and possible MRD candidates is mandatory to obtain specificity in the identification of MM-associated immunophenotype. Clearly, further analysis of the observed phenomenon is necessary in order to allow stringent diagnostics of MRD using flow cytometry. Objective: Although improvements in conventional therapies have increased the overall survival of patients with early stage breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer is still effictively incurable, so that about 40% of patients eventually die of the disease. There is therefore considerable interest in improving overall results by combining traditional therapy with immune therapy, and to this end a number of potential breast cancer vaccines are currently being assessed. Here, we report a screen for new immunogenic antigens on the breast cancer cell line T47D. Methods: Irradiated cells of the breast cancer cell line T47D were used to stimulate CD8+ T cells of an HLA-identical donor in vitro. The MLTC was expanded to >200 Mio cells and tested for restriction and specifity by Elispot assay. T47D cDNA libraries were established in an eukaryotic expression vector and cDNA pools established from 100 cDNAs each. Each pool was co-transfected with HLA-cDNA into 293T cells, screened in an Elispot assay 48h later. Positive pools were divided into pools of 10 colonies each and re-screened. Finally, the single colonies from positive sub-pools were screened individually to identify the reactive clone. Four independent sequences isolated in this way were found to be correspond to the 3`UTR of the MORF4L2 gene. This region was scaned for alternative ORFs, which were then cloned into the expression vector, and tested for reactivity as described above. Results: The MLTC recognized T47D cells in a HLA class I restricted manner. Reaction was blocked completely by the mAb W6/32 (pan HLA-I Ab) and to 90% by B1.23.2 (HLA-B, C Ab). Further analysis revealed restricted recognition with HLA-A33. Screening of one-thousand \"100\"-clone pools yielded 6 single cDNA clones recognized by the MLTC, four of which were identical to the 3`UTR of MORF4L2. The sequences of 3 alternative ORFs were cloned and transfected into 293T. Screening in the Elispot assay revealed recognition of all three sequences in different extend. Conclusions: T47D breast bancer cells may encode immunogenic peptides from alternative open reading frames in the 3`UTR region of the MORF4L2 gene. Introduction: Treatment with intensive chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation is still controversial in patients with poor risk germ cell cancer. We report our experience of intensive chemotherapy with stem cell support. Male patients with de novo poor risk germ cell tumours (International Germ Cell Consensus Classification), refractory or early relapsing tumours were included in this study after informed consent. After induction chemotherapy and stem cell harvesting, they received 3 consecutives cycles of high dose Ifosfamide-Carboplatine-Etoposide (ICE / I=10'000 mg/m\u00b2; C= AUC 20; E= 1200 mg/m\u00b2) with stem cell rescue. The engraftment, toxicities, response rate and overall survival were evaluated. Results: Between 1995 and 2005, we intensified 18 patients with testicular non-seminomatous (9) or mixed germ cell (5), primary mediastinal teratocarcinoma (2) or retroperitoneal embryonnal carcinoma (2).13 had poor risk tumours, 3 intermediate risk and 2 good risk. Treatment was decided for poor risk initial disease (10 patients), early relapses (4), late relapses (2), refractory (1), early second tumour (1) . Induction were with PEI (12 patients), Epirubicin (3), Taxane based (2) and VIP (1) . Median CD34+ cells infused were 7.4x10 6 /kg (Range 2-22). The median number of sequential ICE was 3 (Range 1-3) with a median interval of 28 days (Range 21-42). Median engraftment time was 10 days for neutrophils (>0,5 G/l) and 11 for platelets (>20 G/l). Grade \u2265 3 toxicities were renal failure (1),lung toxicity (1),digestive (1),neurological (1) and infectious (2). 2 patients died before day 100, 1 from viral pneumonia and 1 from relapse. Resection performed in 12 patients showed no residues in 6, mature teratoma in 3 and immature teratoma in 3. 15(83%) had complete response. With a median follow-up of 69 months, 10 are alive without disease, 2 are alive with disease and 1 was lost from follow-up.5 died, 4 of progression. The 5y OS from time to the last autograft is 72%. In the subgroup of poor risk (10 patients), only 2 have relapsed with a 5y OS of 80 % with a median follow-up of 82 months. Conclusion: These results suggest that high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may offer a survival benefit with limited toxicities. This is particularly the case for patients treated upfront after short-term induction chemotherapy. These results warrant further confirmation particularly in this subgroup of patients.",

Natural Killer cells are known to exert cytotoxic activity against several leukemias and also solid tumors. Since haploidentical stem cell transplantation from related donors (parents) allows to infuse high numbers of HLA or KIR-ligand mismatched NK-cells, we investigated the activity of mismatched NK-cells against 7 sarcoma cell lines in vitro an started a clinical study with haploidentical transplants as consolidating immunotherapy in high risk patients with STS. In vitro results: at least 3 experiments with purified NK-cells from different donors were done per cell line. The target cells were lysed to various extents (range 5-64%, E:T=20:1), 6/7 cell lines showed a significant lysis>20%. Stimulation with low dose IL2, high dose IL2 or IL15 resulted always in significant increased lyses (48-94%, 72-100%, 40-100%). Cell lines with high expression of the adhesion molecules CD54 and CD58 were susceptible to NK lysis, whereas targets with weak expression did not. A correlation of r2=0.6 and 0.7 was found. HLA class I expression had no influence. In vivo results: up to now 4 patients with Neuroblastoma, Ewing or Rhabdomyosarcoma relapsed after standard or high dose therapy received a haploidentical transplantation (follow up: 3 months (1-72)). All patients exerted significant lysis against K562 and corresponding soft tissue cell lines 30-60 days post transplant. The patient with the longest follow up (Ewing, ews/fli1+) was monitored for 1 year: NK activity against K562 was high (>80%, E:T 20:1, n=10 exp.) within 3 months posttransplant and decreased later on to normal levels. Low dose IL2 was given for 14 days. A soft tissue cell line (A673 ews/fli1+) was lysed significantly (>10%) within the first year. The patient had a local relapse after 3 years, received a local therapy and is again in CR. Conclusions: HLA mismatched donor NK-cells were able to lyse effectively different sarcoma cell lines in vitro; the degree of lysis correlated with the expression of adhesion molecules on the targets. Cytokine stimulation significantly enhanced specific lysis. These results suggest, that haploidentical donor derived NK-cells may play a role for an immunotherapeutic approach in vivo. Moreover, favorable NK-cell activity was observed also in patients after transplantation.",

Conrad (1) Objective: Various regimes of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in solid cancer patients may mirror different kinetics of donor chimerism, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and outcome. Patients: Thirty-two patients, 9 females/23 males, median 58 (range 38-77) years with renal cell carcinoma (n=17) or colorectal carcinoma (n=15) received RIC and SCT between September 1999 and November 2004. RIC was fludarabine (Flu, 30 mg/m\u00b2) for 3-5 days and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) (n=17) or cyclophosphamide (Cy, 30 mg/kg) for 2 days. Antithymocyte globulin 4 mg/kg was given to patients with matched unrelated donor (n=15). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (n=16) or methotrexate. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given for progressive disease or after tapering of CsA in patients without aGVHD. Methods: Chimerism was analysed bimonthly until complete donor chimerism (CDC) was achieved using PCR of VNTR/STR. Evaluation of lineage-specific chimerism was based on separation of CD3+, CD19+ and CD33+ or CD45+ cells using immunomagnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). CDC was defined as the date of \u2265 95 % donor DNA and confirmed by 100 % donor DNA in the following analyse. Results: CDC of B and T cells were reached in 26/32 and 24/32 patients, median 48 (12-283) and 79 (26-234) days post SCT, respectively. B cells' CDC preceded T cells' CDC in 13/21 patients. This occurred in 10/11 patients with Flu+TBI conditioning but only in 3/10 patients with Flu+Cy (p=0.008). Graft rejection occurred in 3/17 and 1/15 patients, respectively (n.s.). AGVHD grade \u2265 II was found in 9/17 and 9/15 patients with Flu+TBI and Flu+Cy, respectively (n.s.). DLI was given to 21/32 patients. AGVHD grade \u2265 II post DLI occurred in 4/5 and 4/16 patients when DLI was given in parallel with or after tapered CsA, respectively (p<0.05). CDC of B cells developed later in Flu+Cy group as compared with Flu+TBI group (p<0.001). Conclusions: 1) CDC of B cells preceded the CDC of T cells in patients with Flu+TBI based RIC. 2) DLI given during CsA did not diminish the risk for aGVHD. 3) In patients with Flu+Cy, later CDC of B cells and a trend to prolonged overall survival were found as compared with patients receiving Flu+TBI.",

Arnaud, S. Chehata, N. Itzhar, C. Boccaccio, B. Escudier, J.H. Bourhis Institut Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, F) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a treatment -resistant malignancy but sensitive to immune-based therapies. Graftversus -tumor effect has been already demonstrated by previous studies. We report here our experience relative to 10 pts with metastatic renal cancer who received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from an HLA identical sibling between 2001 and 2005. Median age at the time of the HCT was 51 (range 38-61). All pts had a metastatic clear-cell carcinoma. All but one pts had already received and failed previous immune-based therapy (interferon, interleukine 2) prior to the HCT. At the time of HCT 6 pts had progressive disease. RIC consisted of Fludarabine 120mg/m\u00b2 + Busulfan 4mg/kg + ATG 5mg/kg (4 pts) and Fludarabine 125mg/m\u00b2 + Endoxan 120mg/m\u00b2 (6 pts). A median of 6.96 x 106/Kg CD 34+ cells from an HLA identical sibling were reinfused in each pt after the RIC. Post transplant immunosuppression consisted of CSA and short course methotrexate or ciclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. All pts achieved donor type hematopoietic reconstitution. One toxic death occurred because of severe pneumonia in a pt that had already undergone pneumectomy for metastatic disease. 3 pts developed acute GvH during immunosuppressive treatment (IT), 1 during the IT drug tapering, and 1 pt after the IT was ceased. 3 pts received one or more donor lymphocyte infusions for disease progression. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range 1,5 to 30 months) only one patient is still alive. Median OS was 8 mo (range 2-30). One pt died from pneumopathy and severe sepsis and tumoral progrssion, and 8 pts died from disease progression. A partial response was achieved in two pts. Those pts underwent radical surgery prior to HCT. HCT should be indicated only for patients with low volume, slowingly growing disease. New treatment strategies as combining anti angiogenic drugs together with allogeneic transplant and GvT modulation should be evaluated for patients with rapidly progressive disease. C. Solano, I. Benet, I. Marugan, C. Arbona, F. Martinez, J. Hernandez-Boluda, M. Tormo, A. Teruel, M. Terol, A. Lluch Hospital Clinico Universitario (Valencia, E) Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who do not achieve a complete remission after conventional chemotherapy, have a poor prognosis, with a median time to progression of 9 months and a probability of progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years of less than 10%. This prognosis has not changed by conventional high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT). Preliminary results suggest that some cytokines might enhance the antitumor activity after HDC+PBSCT in patients with MBC. Aims: 1. To determine if treatment with HDC + PBSCT, using busulphan, melphalan and thiotepa, followed by immunotherapy with GM-CSF and IL-2, prolongs the PFS in patients with MBC in partial remission (PR) to chemotherapy. 2. To study the treatment toxicity. Patients and Methods: Between July-2000 and June-2004, 15 pts with MBC has been included in the study. Inclusion criteria: 1. Age: 18-60 years; 2. Measurable or evaluable MBC in partial remission (PR) to first line conventional chemotherapy (including anthracyclines or taxanes); 3. Absence of significant comorbidities; 4. Mobilization of more than 2x10 6 CD34+ cells. Characteristics: Median age: 42 years (33-56). Primarily metastatic: 3 pts; relapse: 12 pts (median TTP: 24 months). Median number of metastatic locations: 2 (1-3). HDC: Busulfan: 12 mg/Kg, Melphalan 100 mg/m\u00b2, Thiotepa: 500 mg/m\u00b2. Immunotherapy: GM-CSF (Leucomax\u00ae,Schering-Plough): 60 mcg/Kg/48 hours + IL-2 (Proleukin\u00ae,Chiron): 1 x10 6 IU/m2/48 hours, 2 months (day +35 to +90). Immunological study: Quantitative reconstitution of different T lymphocyte subpopulations and NK cells, and T cell function were done before transplant, before and after immunotherapy. Results: After a median follow-up of 38,5 months (0,5-60), 9 pts are alive and 10 pts progressed after a median time of 24,3 months after PBSCT. The probability of PFS at 24 and 38 months was 46% and 30%, respectively. Toxicity (WHO): oral mucositis grade 3 (75%), grade 4 (10%); cardiac: grade 3: 1 pt. TRM: 2 pt (13%), due to bilateral pneumonia. Quantitative T lymphocyte subpopulations showed significant increment after immunotherapy in activated T cells subpopulations without statistical significant association with PFS. Conclusions: Preliminary results of this phase II study suggest that the use of this HDC combination plus PBSCT followed by immunotherapy is and effective treatment with an acceptable toxicity for this poor prognosis group of patients Patients (pts) with high risk soft tissue sarcoma (STS), metastatic neuroblastoma (NBL IV) or Ewing tumors refractory to risk adapted intensive primary treatment have a dismal prognosis. Intensification of chemotherapy in these heavily pretreated pts is associated with pronounced toxicity, hematotoxicity in particular. As salvage therapy parallel application of four chemotherapeutic agents known to be effective in these disease entities but previously not assessed in combination were given to 12 pts (4 m, 8 f, median 10,3 yrs, range 0.5-20.2 yrs) diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma (6), extraosseous",

Pts received a total of 48 TECC cycles (median 4 cycles/pt). 4 pts were given only 2 cycles due to progessive disease (3) or surgical intervention. 26 pts received \u00a31.0x106, 15 pts 1.0-1.5x106, 6 pts >1.5x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight (bw) (mean 1.15x106, range 0.5-2.8x106 CD34+ cells/kg bw). In 30/45 (67%) of these highly intensive chemotherapy cycles, S150 pts had to be readmitted due to neutropenic infection with more than 50% of these pts discharged within a week. This may have been due to short cytopenic intervals of 9 days duration (mean; range 0-15 days), starting 9 days after chemotherapy (mean; range 0-13 days). Moreover with hematopoetic support a mean interval between chemotherapy cycles of 35 days (range 21-55 days) could be achieved in the absence of other therapeutic intervention such as surgery or radiation. 4 pts achieved CR and are alive and well (2 STS, 1 EES, 1 SS). 40% (5/12) of the pts are alive (4 CR, 1 PD (SS)) with a median observation time of 19 mths (8-44 mths). Even pts that subsequently died of their disease lived for a mean of 12 mths (range 1-23 mths) after end of TECC-therapy. In summary, our data provide evidence that in highly pretreated pts refractory to standard high risk therapy, a combination of TECC and stem cell support induces durable remissions in a significant proportions of pts. This outcome compares very favourably with other forms of salvage therapy.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of transplantation in children with solid tumors, treated with myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in our hospital. From October 1997 to October 2005, 22 autologous transplantation were performed in 18 patients (pts) -9 boys and 9 girls, with median age of 11 years (3-18). Four pts received 2 transplantations. The diagnoses were: rhabdomyosarcoma -4 pts; Ewing sarcoma -4 pts; lymphoepithelioma epipharyngis -4 pts; germ cells tumors -2 pts; neuroblastoma -3 pts and pulmoblastoma -1 pt. The indications for high -dose chemotherapy were chemosensitive relapse in 10 pts and refractory disease in 8 pts. At the time of transplantation the state of remission was: complete remission (CR) -8 pts; partial remission (PR) -8 pts and with disease progression -2 pts. All pts received PBSC. The mobilization regimen consisted of chemotherapy with Cyclophosphamide -4 g/m\u00b2 and Vepeside -300mg/m\u00b2 BS and G-CSF in daily dose -5 \u00b5g/kg BW. The median number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 4,49x106/kg. The high-dose chemotherapy regimen were: Thiotepa + Cisplatina -1; Thiotepa + Cy -4; ICE -11; Vepeside + Cisplatina -2; VCM -1; Melphalan +Fludara -1; Melphalan + Bu -2. Sixteen pts engrafted and 2 died from graft failure. The median engraftment time for neutrophiles and platelets was 10 and 13 days respectively. The most significant transplant related toxicities included: mucositis in 90% of pts, fever in 85% and diarrhea in 75%. Transplant-related mortality was 9%. With a median follow-up of 32 months, the overall survival and the event-free survival were 60% and 59.09% respectively. Conclusions: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment option for most of children with poor-prognostic solid tumour. Patients with advanced lung cancer have a poor prognosis after standard radiochemotherapy. An innovative treatment strategy is the targeting of tumor associated antigens with cellular effector cells. The telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) is an attractive target for cytotoxic T cells that is highly expressed in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. The aim of the study was the expression of hTERT in dendritic cells (DC), that are the most powerful activators of specific CTL. We used electrotransfection of DC with hTERT mRNA that enables an HLA independent whole antigen approach potentially targeting a wide range of hTERT epitopes. Immature human DC were prepared from peripheral blood monocytes in serum-free growth medium, GM-CSF and IL-4. Subsequently the DC were electroporated in transfection buffer with mRNA and matured in a cytokine cocktail consisting of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and PGE2. Verification of hTERT mRNA transfection efficiency was performed by analyzing the induction of telomerase activity with the TRAP assay, the efficiency of GFP electrotransfection was determined by FACS.To establish mRNA electrotransfection conditions the DCs of 3 healthy individuals were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA.The percentage of electrotransfected DC was in between 18-89% (mean 46%). Subsequently we electrotransfected monocyte derived DCs with mRNA in 3 lung cancer patients (1 SCLC, 2 NSCLC). In 1 patient tested GFP mRNA transfection resulted in 62% GFP positive DC. In the 2 other patients the telomerase activity measured in the DC 24 hrs after hTERT electrotransfection was equivalent to HL60 cells that biologically express high levels of hTERT. Non-transfected DC did not show any telomerase activity.",

The same was true in another patient, in whom an electrotransfection was not done. In both patients the DC were expressing high levels of HLA-DR and no lineage markers, but CD83 as an indicator of maturation was found in only 1% and 9% respectively. Also the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were expressed at low levels. These data show that strong hTERT expression can be achieved in DCs of lung cancer patients using mRNA electrotransfection but demontrate the need for other more potent maturation stimuli. Purpose of this single centre study was to investigate/evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of non-myeloablative SCT. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (25 mg/m\u00b2 on days -5, -4, -3, -2, -1) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg on days -2, -1). Patients received stem cells from an HLAmatched related /sibling donor, prophylaxis for graft-versushost disease (GVHD) consisted of standard Cyclosporine-A and Methotrexate. Diagnoses are: Renal cell (n=7), metastatic breast cancer (n=6), melanoma (n=2) and various haematological malignancies (n=18). Treatment-related mortality assessed at 180 days after transplantation was 11/33 (33%). Acute GVHD occurred in 13/31 (42%) evaluable patients, chronic GVHD in 9/25 (36%). Chimerism data at days 30-90: in 3/26 (12%) <30% donor cells, all others were higher. At days 180 or later 9/11 (82%) had >80% donor cells and 8 of theses more than 95%. From these data we conclude that non-myeloablative transplantation using this cyclophosphamide/fludarabine regimen is feasible and results in adequate chimerism in the majority of patients. Morbidity and TRM may be higher than expected. However, these might be related to patient selection. More data are necessary to assess the efficacy in relation to anti-tumour effect. Six weeks before the SCT, 50 cc of bone marrow are sampled under sterile conditions. Ficoll-separated MNCs are plated into tissue culture flasks in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 degrees with 5% CO2. At 70% confluence, the cells are trypsinized and replated at 4E3 cells/ cm2 until the target dose of 1-2E6/kg recipient body weight is obtained. Enrichment and expansion of MSCs is performed under GMP conditions in nationally accredited laboratories. MSCs (either fresh or cryopreserved) are administered i.v. 4 hours before infusion of donor G-CSF mobilized PBSCs. All toxicities associated with the procedure were documented, as were the engraftment kinetics and immune recovery. The study was carried out with approval of the respective local ethical committees. The data indicate that expansion and co-transplantation of MSCs is feasible and well tolerated. While the study is ongoing initial engraftment and immune recovery data (compared to historical data) is encouraging and to date there have been no episodes of graft rejection or severe adverse events related to this treatment.

Ex vivo expanded human MSC are currently evaluated in studies for the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease and for HSC engraftment support. This study was performed to define standardized expansion conditions to generate the requested quantity of 2x106 MSC/kg/patient for clinical purposes under good manufacturing practice (GMP). We explored the influence of log fold decreased cell seeding density (2500; 250; 25; 2.5 MSC/cm\u00b2) in defined standard media. MSC phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunomodulatory MSC function was assessed in T cell stimulation assays. Multiplex cytokine arrays were employed to study regulatory pathways of cell proliferation and immune modulation. Maintenance of SC characteristics was tested in CFU-F and differentiation assays. An initial 10 day expansion of 10mL bone marrow on 10x225cm\u00b2 allowed to generate multiple aliquots of 106 MSC each. Seeding densities between 40-100 MSC/cm\u00b2 almost guaranty to obtain >108 MSC starting from 1-2 aliquots of 106 MSC within additional 10-14 days in cell factories under GMP conditions without additional manipulation. MSC for repeated applications could thus be generated from only 10mL BM aspiration. Amplified cells displayed the common CD73+/90+/105+/29+/13+/34-/45-/133-/146+/HLA-AB+ phenotype and retained their adipo-, chondro-, and osteogenic differentiation potential. Immunosuppressive function was unaffected by clonal density culture as indicated by dose dependent inhibition of T cell proliferation accompanied by downregulation of IFN-\u0192\u00d7/TNF-\u0192\u00d1/IL-2/IL-4/IL-5, and upregulation of IL-10/IL-12 production. Significant increase of IL-1-\u0192\u00d1/IL-6/Eotaxin secretion indicates that MSC dependent immune modulation does not present a pure anti-inflammatory situation. These data introduce a standard 2-step MSC expansion at reduced seeding density under GMP conditions. Further insight into the behavior of MSC with respect to proliferation, homing efficiency and regulatory function will help to assess evolving therapeutic strategies.",

To be used in clinical setting, particularly in preventing GVHD, MSCs need to be cultured according GMP standards. To reach this goal, the SFGM-TC (French Society for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy) has studied and described a set of culture conditions. Briefly, without any manipulations whole bone marrow nucleated cells were seeded at 50x103/cm\u00b2 in MEM alpha supplemented with 10% of FCS (Hyclone, USA) and 1 ng/mL of FGF2 (R&D systems, USA). The medium was changed twice weekly until confluence (P0). Then the adherent cells were harvested and seeded at 1x103/cm\u00b2 in the same medium until the confluence (P1). Using this protocol, bona fide MSCs were obtained. FACS analysis showed the absence of CD45, CD34, HLA class 2, and the expression of CD90, CD73, CD49a, CD105, CD146, CD164. The cells were multipotent and differentiated along the osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and adipocytic pathways. They inhibited the proliferation of T Lymphocytes. According to this protocol, clinical scale productions of MSCs were performed using specific connecting systems with bags containing medium (Macopharma, France) and containers (CellStacks,Corning, USA). The cultures were initiated using as few as 4 mL of bone marrow. From the first experiment, the duration of culture decreased from 42 days till now 21-28 days. The total fold increase (fold increase at the end of P0 x fold increase at the end of P1) was 170,4 (min 87, max 387). To prevent any immunological reaction with FCS proteins, a washout could be performed during 24 hrs to 48 hrs in medium without FCS. After washing out, the cells produced at clinical scale were identical to these previously reported. By implementing this method of production, the SFGM-TC will start a double blind comparative study evaluating allogeneic MSCs for prevention of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) after standard related or unrelated HLA identical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The aim of the study is to reduce grade II-IV aGVHD in the group of patients with MSC compared to a placebo group. Donor of MSCs will be identical to HSCs donor in related HSCT.

            "text": "Objectives: Differentiation of bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into mature mesodermal tissues, such as smooth and skeletal muscle, occurs more frequently and reliably compared to tissues of other germ layers. As urinary incontinence is associated with damaged sphincteric myofibers or age-dependent decrease of myofibers by apoptosis, tissue repair using MSC is a tempting approach for a cell-based therapy. Aim of this study was to examine myogenic differentiation of MSC and their integration into the urethral sphincter in a rat model. Methods: BM-derived MSC of Lewis rats were isolated by plastic adherence and grown to confluence. To induce myogenic differentiation, cells were exposed to 5-azacytidine for 24 hours. Differentiation was examined in passage 2 and 3 by immunocytochemistry (ICC) with monoclonal antibodies against alpha-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4 and CGA7), skeletal muscle MyoD (5.8A), and skeletal slow muscle myosin (NOQ7.54D). For in vivo tracking, differentiationinduced MSC were detached, stained with PKH26, and injected into the bladder neck of syngeneic Lewis rats. Results: Positive reactions were obtained with both alphasmooth muscle actin mAbs (1A4 in 50-90% and CGA7 in 20% of the cells). The MyoD antibody only detected single cells. There was no reactivity with the myosin antibody. Treatment of BM-derived MSC from Lewis rats with 5-azacytidine therefore mainly resulted in differentiation towards smooth, and, to a lesser extent, skeletal muscle. Integration into the host tissue was monitored after local injection into the bladder neck. Histology demonstrated well-defined groups of fluorescent cells in the bladder neck tissue 2, 4 and 7 days after injection. After 6 and 18 weeks however, applied cells were equally spread in the whole tissue. Conclusions: These results underscore the myogenic potential of BM-derived MSC and suggest that after local injection, differentiation-induced MSC migrate locally and spread in the bladder neck. This model therfore emphasizes the use of autologous MSC as a potential cell-based treatment of urinary incontinence that can be administered endoscopically. Further S153 studies will elucidate final myogenic differentiation and tissue integration of MSC in more detail using human MSC in a xenograft large animal model, which will also allow assessment of improved sphincter function. (1) Antibodies against alloantigens are implicated in the pathogenesis of several immune reactions complicating transplantation. In particular, this humoral response has been hypothesized to be responsible for some of the clinical manifestations related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In organ transplant recipients, the presence of antibodies against donor cells is a contraindication to transplantation because of the risk of hyperacute rejection. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated to possess immunomodulatory capacity, since they induce T-cell hyporesponsiveness in vitro, prolong survival of skin graft in a primate model, and seem to decrease GVHD incidence and severity in humans given HSCT. To verify whether MSC may exert inhibition on antibody production during allostimulation, we stimulated B-cell-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from controls (n=9) or sensitized subjects awaiting kidney allograft (n=5) in a mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) against irradiated HLA-disparate PBMC (controls) or stimulators cells bearing HLA antigens found positive in cross-match (patients). MLC in the presence of agonist anti-CD40 mAb + IL-10 was also included. Antibody production in the absence or in the presence of third-party allogeneic MSC (responder:MSC ratio: 4:1 and 20:1) was then evaluated by ELISA. We found that both controls and patients produced high levels of Ig (controls: IgG 1583 ng/ml; IgM 1167 ng/ml; IgA 1902 ng/ml; patients: IgG 866 ng/ml; IgM 240 ng/ml; IgA 95 ng/ml ) in response to allostimulation in MLC. Stimulation through anti-CD40 binding induced higher levels of Ig production. The addition of MSC at the beginning of MLC considerably inhibited Ig production (controls: IgG 261 ng/ml; IgM 103 ng/ml; IgA 676 ng/ml; patients: IgG 152 ng/ml; IgM 87 ng/ml; IgA 25 ng/ml) in standard MLC, while Ig secretion induced via CD40 binding was not inhibited. In a patient with positive cross-match, Ab-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by patient's serum and control MLC supernatant could not be detected by using supernatant from MSC-MLC. Our findings suggest that third-party MSC are able to suppress allo-specific antibody production in vitro, mainly through T-cell help inhibition, and may therefore help to overcome a positive cross-match in sensitized transplant recipients. These results may also partly explain the mechanism at the basis of the favourable effect played by MSC in patients with GVHD. Objective: Renal failure is a common disease with high morbidity and mortality. Ischemic injury is one of the most common cause of renal failure. Recent studies have reported that adult bone marrow-derived cells can contribute to renal remodeling and a dramatic repopulation of the mesangium. Moreover, there was a report that the role of bone marrowderived hematopoietic stem cells in the regeneration of the renal tubular epithelium after ischemic injury in mice. When ischemic injury is inflicted on targeted organ, MSCs may migrate to the site of damage, undergo differentiation, and promote structural and functional repair. We evaluated whether bone marrow-derived MSCs contribute to the healing process and improve renal function in injured kidney of rat by ischemia. Materials and Methods: Right nephrectomy was performed in six-week-old SD rat. And the left renal artery and vein were clamped for 45 min followed by 2/3 nephrectomy was done and then clamp releases to allow perfusion. MSCs prelabeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) injected via tail vein. Peripheral blood was collected serially for evaluation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and functional evaluation was done with radioisotope renal scan. Histologic study and confocal microscopic evaluation were performed at 4 days, 1 week, and 4 weeks after MSCs injection. Results: We demonstrated that GFP positive cells were detected in damaged kidney by confocal microscopy and engrafted MSCs promoted healing process by ischemic injury. Also engrafted MSCs differentiated into tubular epithelial cells, thereby restoring renal structure. In the group with MSCs injection, the levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were lower than control group without MSCs injection (BUN Day 4, control group; 65.0\u00b181.3, MSC infusion group; 31.1\u00b15.1). And MSCs injected rats demonstrated that renal function recovered more rapid and more close to the normal value in radioisotope renal scan. Conclusions: The results presented here suggest that MSCs are capable of healing and functional restoring of damaged kidney by ischemic injury. So MSCs may be useful for cell therapy of renal failure.",

Several studies demonstrated that immunomodulatory properties of MSCs are dose-dependent and that, at a high lymphocyte/MSC ratio MSCs may exert either a suppressive or an enhancing activity on lymphocyte activation. Aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms underlying the experiment variability observed using MSC in the modulation of antigen-specific lymphocyte response in vitro. PBMCs of two different volunteers (Don 1, Don 2) were stimulated in vitro with heat-inactivated Candida Albicans (CA) in the presence or absence of allogeneic bone marrowderived MSCs (PBMC:MSC, 10:1) obtained by an HSCTdonor. Lymphocyte subset activation and MSC growth were monitored throughout 10-day culture. In the absence of MSC, a similar CA-induced increase in the number of CD3+, CD4+, CD3+/CD56+ T lymphocytes and CD3neg/ CD56+ NK cells was observed in both donors, while a consistently higher increase of CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma production was detected in Don 2, as compared with Don 1. MSCs added to Don 2 lymphocyte cultures gradually diminished in number, becoming undetectable within 7-day culture; on the contrary MSC added to Don 1 lymphocyte cultures continued to grow for about 7days, and were still detectable after 10-day cultures. MSCs caused, for both donor's lymphocyte-cultures, a slowing down of CA-induced expansion of CD4+ T and a sharp decrease of NK cells. Remarkably, Don 1 CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma production were also decreased by addition of MSCs, while in case of Don 2 we observed a considerable MSC-related increase of CD8+ T cells, mostly co-expressing CD56, and no decrease in IFN-gamma production. These preliminary results suggest that PBMC of some donors, if properly activated, can either kill allogeneic MSCs or promote their apoptosis. Apoptotic MSCs might, in turn, be presented by cross-priming mechanisms to allogeneic lymphocytes, further promoting their activation. In case activated lymphocytes are not able to induce MSC lysis or apoptosis, MSCs may keep growing and exerting immune suppressive activity. Further experiments are in progress to better define these phenomena, whose comprehension would provide useful information for employing allogeneic MSCs in transplantation setting.",

Therefore they are already used for prevention and treatment of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and for additional clinical applications. The mechanism underlying these effects is not fully understood. In GvHD, apoptosis may play a major role by MSC-mediated suppression of T-cells. We have investigated induction of apoptosis by MSC on 3 different mononuclear peripheral blood cell preparations (MNC) and 9 malignant cell lines of the haematopoietic system. In addition, apoptosis independent effects on proliferation were analysed over incubation for 16 days. Methods: MSC were isolated from spongiosa or bone marrow aspirate and characterized by flow cytometry for the presence of MSC markers and their potential to differentiate in osteoblasts and adipocytes. Results: Cultivation of MSC with Jurkat cells resulted in significant increase of AnnexinV-positive cells after 24 hours, but no increase of apoptotic cells could be seen when incubated for 72 hours with cell lines KG1a, K562, 697, LOUCY, U937. Basal apoptosis rate in MNC and the CD34+cell line CS1 was reduced. Cell-cell contact is essential for apoptosis induction by MSC, as no increase of apoptotic Jurkat was seen after cocultivation in a transwell-system. Coincubation with MSC also increases apoptosis in Jurkat mediated by Fas-or TRAIL receptor. This MSC-mediated sensitization to Fas-or TRAIL-induced apoptosis is sustained after removal of the agonists. Table1 summarizes results of incubation for 72 hours: % of AnnexinV-positive cells is indicated. Using the membrane dye PKH, we could demonstrate that different MSC-preparations influence growth of cell lines independent of apoptosis induction and -in most cases-independent of cell-cell contact. Sensitivity of malignant cells lines to MSC-induced growth inhibition is heterogeneous (Table1). Conclusion: Our data show a selective apoptotic effect of MSC in the malignant T-cell line Jurkat but no effect on apoptosis in MNC. In addition, MSC inhibit proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cell lines.

Since the interaction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in the bone marrow environment is of special importance for the maintenance of the quiescent HSC pool, we specifically studied the in-vitro effects of IM on primary cultures of human MSC. Methods: MSC were isolated from bone marrow of healthy volunteer donors and cultured for 7 days with 1, 5 and 10 \u00b5mol IM and a specific MEK inhibitor (UO126). Morphologic changes were recorded using phase contrast and electronic microscopy. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were tested using standard media. Clonogenicity and the support of hematopoietic stem cells were screened by a standard CFU-F assay and a new four-week LTC-IC culture. Changes in PDGFR\u00df and ERK expression and phosphorylation were investigated by Western blot analysis. Results: Characteristic morphological changes of MSC could be observed as soon as 12 hours after the first contact with IM: The spindle-shaped cells flattened, lost confluence and developed perinuclear granula resembling multivesicular bodies when analysed by electron microscopy. Cell proliferation was inhibited significantly with increasing concentrations of IM. There was a significant decrease in the median number of fibroblastoid colony-forming units (d14 CFU-F: 29 vs. 55, p=0.04)) with a predominance of small colonies (1-2 mm) compared to control cultures. The induction of alkaline phosphatase activity after osteogenic differentiation was decreased from 5 fold to 2 fold by IM compared to untreated control cultures. MSC show baseline activation of pERK that was inhibited by the administration of IM (10\u00b5M) with a long lasting kinetic. The effect of IM was only partially overcome by co-administration of exogenous PDGF. The influence of IM was comparable to the inhibitory effect of the MEKinase inhibitor (UO126). Interestingly, we could not observe an inhibition of baseline PDGFR\u00df-phosphorylation by IM. Conclusions: IM inhibits the capacity of human MSC to proliferate and to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage. In addition, the support of hematopoiesis mediated by MSC is also hampered. The observed effects may in part be mediated by suppression of the MAPKinase pathway.",

They support hematopoiesis (stroma function) and have potent immune-modulatory properties making them promising candidates for clinical use. Although MSC cultures show considerable morphological differences, no specific markers are available that would allow for the prospective isolation of distinct subpopulations. We therefore investigated whether MSC subpopulations could be identified based on functional parameters (i.e. proliferation characteristics). Methods: Human MSC were generated in standard cultures and stained with Carboxyfluoresceine-succinimidylesther (CFSE) for cell division tracking. After 10 days culture MSC were sorted by FACS according to their divisional history (non-divided cells, NDC; rapidly-divided cells, RDC) and assayed for stromal progenitor cell frequency in standard CFU-F assays as well as single-cell assays. Oligonucleotide microarrays were utilized for gene expression profiling of sorted MSC subpopulations. Results: After 10 days culture the majority of cells had undergone more than 3 cell divisions (51.2 \u00b1 1.7%, SDC) and only 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 % had not divided (NDC). Interestingly, the CFU-F frequency in NDC (0.6 \u00b1 0.2 CFU-F per 100 cells) was up to 5-times lower compared to RDC. MSC single-cell sorts demonstrated that CFU-F were only present in RDC, indicating that NDC consisted primarily of more mature, possibly postmitotic cells. However, after 5 weeks of culture, colonies were also found in NDC. This finding might point to the existence of a rare population of early, immature MSC within NDC. Comparison of sorted MSC subpopulations by oligonucleotide microarrays showed that 50 genes were significantly higher expressed in RDC compared to NDC with several of them being cell cycle associated. Of the 62 genes upregulated in NDC, more than 20 were related to adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix proteins or cell senescence. Conclusion: Taken together, the data clearly demonstrate functional differences between the isolated MSC subpopulations and point to a possible hierarchical organization of MSC cultures. Cell sorting based on proliferation characteristics and gene expression profiling yielded interesting candidates for potential MSC subpopulation markers.",

Aside from its effects on neoplastic cells, imatinib also affects various nonmalignant cells such as hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and T-cells. However, little is known about the possible effects of imatinib on the bone marrow microenvironment, which might be relevant considering the essential role of the microenvironment for hematopoiesis. Therefore, we studied the in vitro toxicity of imatinib on normal human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells. Marrow stromal progenitor cell growth was considerably inhibited by imatinib in a dosedependent fashion: CFU-F were reduced to 75 \u00b1 35.5%, 52 \u00b1 29.2%, 32 \u00b1 25.7%, 33.7 \u00b1 23.4%, and 20.6 \u00b1 20.6% of control at 0.04, 0.16, 0.62, 2.5, and 10.0 \u00b5M imatinib, respectively (IC50: 0.44 \u00b5M). Culture-derived mesenchymal stem cells, MSC, were also affected dose-dependently with reduction to 20.0 \u00b1 2.2% (0.62 \u00b5M), 14.6 \u00b1 1.2% (1.25 \u00b5M), 10.1 \u00b1 0.3% (2.5 \u00b5M), 5.8 \u00b1 0.5% (5 \u00b5M), and 2.8 \u00b1 0.3% (10 \u00b5M) of controls after 2 weeks culture. After 4 weeks, corresponding data were 3.1 \u00b1 0.5%, 2.2 \u00b1 0.4%, 1.8 \u00b1 0.3%, 1.1 \u00b1 0.2%, and 0.5 \u00b1 0.1%. Furthermore, following a 7-day culture period in imatinib-containing medium (0.62 -10 \u00b5M), the MSC growth kinetics were delayed for up to 2 weeks after withdrawal of the drug. Imatinib did however not impair functional MSC capacities as measured in standard long-term culture initiating cell assays. Moreover, it did not significantly affect cell cycle parameters. However, MSC in maximum growth phase were considerably more susceptible to imatinib when compared to the steady-state. Receptor blocking experiments demonstrated that imatinib acted on MSC -at least in part -independently of PDGFR-and c-kit-signaling. To further investigate the mechanism of action, cDNA microarray analyses were performed. Several key genes involved in apoptosis were found among those that were significantly higher expressed in imatinib-treated MSC. Imatinib-induced apoptosis was confirmed in first experiments utilizing the TUNEL assay and further supplementary experiments are under way. Taken together, the data show that imatinib severely affects normal marrow stromal cell growth, most likely by induction of apoptosis. Possible in vivo effects on the marrow microenvironment should be investigated.",

Total (CD19+), naive (IgD+CD27-), IgD memory (IgD+CD27+) and class switched memory (IgD-CD27+) B lymphocyte populations were identified. Indications for transplantation were various haematological malignancies (n=49) and aplastic anaemia (n=2). 13 patients received stem cells from a matched unrelated and 38 from a related or sibling donor. 24 patients received reduced intensity and 27 full intensity conditioning regimens prior to transplant. All patients with a matched unrelated donor and those receiving reduced intensity conditioning, received Campath 1H with the transplant conditioning. In six patients, B cell subsets could not be analysed due to the low numbers of B cells present: 2 had received rituximab (anti-CD20) for post transplant complications, 2 received systemic conrticosteroid for treatment of graft versus host disease (GvHD). The majority of patients (n=38) have retained a predominantly naive B cell phenotype at 3 to 48 months (median=10 months). One patient has a normal percentage of memory with a low percentage of class-switched B cells. Eleven patients have a normal percentage of class-switched B lymphocytes at 5 to 28 months (median = 15 months). Nine of these eleven patients received peripheral blood stem cells rather than marrow. One patient achieved a normal percentage of class-switched B cells but returned to a naive B lymphocyte phenotype on relapse of his underlying haematological maligancy. No patient who required treatment with additional immunosuppressive therapy, in the post transplant setting When patients with hematological malignancies develop a lifethreatening complication there may be reluctance to admit them in intensive care units (ICU) because of their supposed poor prognosis, specially if they have received a previous HSCT.

The majority of studies were based on low numbers of patients, thus statistical analyses of factors influencing the reconstitution were based exclusively on the univariate analyses, which excluded significant interactions between the variables. Our prospective study included 70 patients (median age 12.2), who underwent altogether 73 AHCTs from November 1996 to September 2004. There were unique patients, who survived day +100 post HCT. The analysis of the immune recovery was based on the logistic regression model, incl. a detailed multivariate analysis The criterion of the quality of reconstitution was the achievement of the fifth percentile (p5) of age-matched reference value for different lymphocyte subsets. Several factors, incl. the diagnosis, the source of haematopoietic cells, the amount of CD34+ cells/kg in the graft and the occurrence of relapse were analysed with regard to the quality of immune recovery. It was shown, that the number of Th cells (incl. naive Th cells) remained decreased months long in children post autologous HCT. Only approximately 50% of children reached p5 of agematched reference value for Th cells at 1 year post AHCT, whereas almost 90% of pts had normal values of Ts cells within the whole study period. B cells started to recover at 2 months post AHCT with almost 40% of pts reaching p5 of agematched reference value. The most important factor, which favoured T and B cell recovery was the number of grafted CD34+ cells/kg (OR 3.2, CI 0.99 -10.1 for T cells at 1 month and OR 10.8, CI 2.0-58.2 for B cells at 2 months post AHCT, respectively). Therefore, it should be aimed at performing PBPC apheresis as early as possible in the course of chemotherapy, provided the clinical status is stable and complete BM disease remission is achieved. Patients, who developed relapse of underlying disease had a poorer chance to reach p5 of age-matched reference value for total lymphocytes at 1 year and B cells at 9-12 months post AHCT, respectively. Furthermore, higher number of grafted CD34+ cells favoured better T cell recovery at 1 year post AHCT, which may play a role in controlling MRD and preventing relapse.",

We report here a second patient who received allogeneic MSC for graft failure after autologous bone marrow transplantation. A nulliparous 40 year old woman was diagnosed in 2000 with an acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). No HLA identical related or unrelated donor was identified. An autologous bone marrow transplantation was performed in first complete remission (CR1). Because of a primary graft failure the patient then received her back up marrow but again whithout any effect on hematopoiesis. Partial hematopoietic recovery was finally obtained under G-CSF and EPO given several times a week. The patient remained dependant of the growth factors for over 3 years. Infusion of allogeneic MSC was therefore decided in 2004. MSC were isolated and ex vivo expanded from the bone marrow of a fully HLA mismatch related donor. A dose of 3x106 MSC/kg of patient body weight was IV infused in October 2004. No conditioning regimen, no prophylaxis of graft versus host disease were done. At time of infusion the patient was still in CR1 of AML. Baseline peripheral blood cell before MSC infusion were: polymorphonuclear cells (PMN): 810/mm\u00b3, platelets: 45000/mm\u00b3, hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dl. No hematopoietic growth factor was given after MSC infusion. A slow but sustained hematopoietic recovery was observed on PMN and platelets. No effect on Hb was noted. Figure 1 and figure 2 show platelet and PMN recovery curves over a period of 13 months after MSC infusion and indicate that the best effect was seen on platelets. Recovery of platelets over 100.000/mm\u00b3 was observed on day 425 post MSC infusion.

In our proteomic screen we identified JNK1 among others such as PAK6, MADP-1, Calmodulin like skin proteins and ZNF45 as proteins interacting with DBD of C/EBPs from nuclear extract of myelomonocytic cells.

The precise mechanism of engraftment after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has not been fully understood yet. Accordingly, in the current study, we attempted to evaluate the impact of the transplant dose of each cell subset on the engraftment kinetics and transplant outcomes in HLA-identical allogeneic PBSCT setting. Methods: A total of 69 patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling allogeneic PBSCT were included in this retrospective study. The engraftment kinetics, the transplant outcomes and the immune reconstitution up to 1 year post-transplant were analyzed according to the transplant dose of CD34+ and non-CD34+ cells including NK and Tc. Result: The faster engraftment of neutrophil was strongly associated with higher transplant dose of NK (12 days versus 16 days, p<0.001), and of Tc (13 days versus 16 das, p<0.001), but not of CD34+ cells (p=0.442). The survival analyses revealed a favorable prognosis for the group transplanted with higher dose of non-CD34+ cell subsets in terms of OS (p=0.024 for NK, 0.050 for Tc) or NRM (p=0.005 for NK, 0.060 for Tc), but not of CD34+ cells. In addition, higher dose transplantation of NK or Tc was also found to correlate with faster lymphoid reconstitution. Especially, the group showing rapid engraftment of neutrophil had a superior OS or NRM to slow engraftment group. In multivariate analyses, rapid engraftment of neutrophil was correlated with higher transplant dose of NK (p=0.001) and Tc (p=0.004). In terms of OS and NRM, improving OS was associated with NK cell dose (p=0.007) and chronic GVHD (p=0.009), and improving NRM with NK dose (p=0.024) Conclusion: In PBSCT setting, higher dose transplantation of NK or Tc seems to fasten neutrophil engraftment, to improve immune reconstitution, and to reduce NRM, thus improving OS after allogeneic PBSCT.",

Due to this peculiarity, telomere restriction fragment (TRF) length has been used as a marker of residual proliferative capacity and ultimately of cell senescence. In a recent report (Ricca I et al, Leukemia 2005) we analysed TRF length on peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) harvested after 2 tightly-spaced hdchemotherapy courses, i.e. hd-cyclophosphamide (CY) and hd-Ara-C and found that PBSC TRF length markedly shortened at the second hd-course. Aim of this study was to assess how TRF length of the graft may influence telomere status of post stem cell transplantation (SCT) hematopoiesis. Patients and Methods: TRF length was monitored in 20 patients undergoing autograft with PBSC collected after hd-CY (7 patients) or hd-Ara-C (13 patients) and in 8 allografted patients. Overall, their median age was 47 years (range 23-60). TRF length was assessed both on graft material and on bone marrow (BM) samples taken at a median time of 20 months after SCT. All patients were in complete remission of their underlying disease at the time of TRF length assessment. TRF length was evaluated by Southern blot, as previously described (Ricca I et al, Leukemia 2005) . Results: As shown in Figure A Figure C . Donor PBSC had TRF length significantly longer than recipient BM cells (p<0.01). Again, post-SCT TRF length was similar to the graft (p=0.37) but markedly longer if compared to patient pre-SCT value. Conclusions: TRF length of BM cells following SCT reflects that of graft, suggesting that telomeres of hematopoietic cells can be modified according to telomere length of grafted stem cells.",

            "text": "NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells) transcription factors are a family of five proteins that are primarily known for their central role in the regulation of inducible gene expression in T cells. It is now clear that NFAT proteins are also expressed in various non-immune cell types, where they regulate the expression of genes involved in such diverse cellular processes as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. We have previously shown that NFATc2 is strongly expressed in human CD34+ cells and megakaryocytes, but not in purified peripheral blood neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes. Furthermore, granulocytic differentiation of CD34+ cells in vitro was paralleled by the rapid and profound suppression of NFATc2 mRNA and protein (Kiani et al., J Leukoc Biol 76:1057 , 2004 ). In the present study, we established a comprehensive expression profile of all five NFAT family members in CD34+ cells and during their in vitro differentiation into neutrophil, eosinophil, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. CD34+ cells were purified from umbilical cord blood and cultured in the presence of cytokines inducing differentiation of the respective lineages. At several time-points during the culture, the efficacy and specificity of the differentiation was monitored by morphological examination of cytospin preparations as well as by analysis of lineage-specific cell surface markers. By quantitative RT-PCR, NFATc3 and NFAT5 were the NFAT family members found to be most prominently expressed in CD34+ cells of both peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood. NFAT expression during the differentiation of CD34+ cells into the diverse hematopoietic lineages followed a family member-and lineage-specific pattern. Neutrophil differentiation was accompanied by a rapid suppression of transcript levels for all NFAT family members. In contrast, eosinophil, erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation was paralleled by an upregulation of NFATc3, NFATc1/NFATc3 and NFATc1 mRNA, respectively. The most obvious lineage-specific pattern was observed for NFATc4, which was specifically upregulated about 12-fold when CD34+ cells were differentiated into megakaryocytes. The expression profile of NFAT family members in developing hematopoietic cells of diverse myeloid lineages presented here will allow predicting and directly assessing the role of individual NFAT family members in hematopoietic differentiation.",

Moreover, recent reports favor CD34+ cell enumeration over CFC assays. The aim of this study was to compare the quantification of the colony forming units (CFUs) derived from the CD34+ and the CD133+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in order to improve the cell selection criteria for cord blood banking and transplantation. CBUs were collected in utero after informed consent. Using the SEPAX Automated Cell Separation System, partial removal of both plasma and red blood cells from the CB collection unit was achieved; with the standardisation of all CBUs' volume to 26 ml. Full blood differential cell counts of the samples post-volume reduction were obtained. HSCs (CD34+, CD133+) were isolated using the Miltenyi Midi MACS Separation system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD34+ and CD133+ cells were counted using three-colour flow cytometry. The CBUs' proliferating capacity using white blood cells (WBCs) and isolated CD34+, CD133+ stem cells was examined. CFU assays were used to indicate the cells' capability of duplication and differentiation on a semi-solid methylcellulose medium (Methocult GF H4434, StemCell Technologies) and scored after 14 days. Data is presented as mean \u00b1 sd. CFUs correlated with the CD34+ and CD133+ stem cell content of a CBU (R= 0.577 and R= 0.606 respectively), while correlation between WBCs and CFUs was weaker (R= 0.427). In addition, isolated CD133+ cell population had a better capability of duplication and differentiation compared to CD34+ (mean CFU relative counts 918.10 and 481.15 per 104 isolated cells respectively). Taken together, these preliminary results indicate that the enumeration of CD133+ stem cells is a better indicator of the CBU's proliferative capacity and, therefore, a more accurate index of the haematopoietic content of a CBU than the CD34+ stem cells quantity. This conclusion would improve the cell selection criteria for cord blood banking and transplantation, although, further investigation of this approach in the context of clinical trial is indicated, in order to determine the full impact of the CD133+ stem cells dose of a CBU on transplantation outcome.",

For mobilisation, the combination of cytostatics and G-CSF has been the most efficient. Pegfilgrastim (PEGFIL), a long-acting pegylated form of filgrastim (FIL), has been shown to be as effective as daily FIL in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The experiences with PEGFIL in stem cell mobilisation are so far limited. The aim of this study was to compare PEGFIL-supported mobilisation chemotherapy with that of daily FIL in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies. Patients and methods: 24 consecutive patients (median age 55 years) with multiple myeloma (MM; n=11), lymphomas (n=8) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL; n=5) were mobilised with PEGFIL and compared to a double number of historical control patients (median age 54 years; ) who were mobilised with daily FIL (MM 22, lymphomas 16 and CLL 10). Cyclophosphamide 2g/m\u00b2 was the most common mobilisation chemotherapy. In the PEGFIL group, the dose was 12 mg sc (21 patients) and 6 mg sc in 3 patients, given one day after the end of cytotoxic therapy. For the FIL patients the dose was 5 ug/kg sc daily started one day after the end of cytotoxic therapy. Leukaphereses were performed using the COM. TEC Blood Cell Separator (Fresenius Hemo Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) with reduced volume program. For a few historical controls the Fenwal CS-3000 Plus (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL, USA) devise was used. Results: The median onset of apheresis was on day +10 (10-15) in PEGFIL group and on day +11 (10-19) in FIL group.

In PEGFIL group the median apheresis yield was 5.2 (1.63-17.9) x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg with the median of 2 (1-3) aphereses.

We assessed, in a large cohort, the risk of leukemic relapse, death, and GVHD associated with donor CMV serostatus among HLA-A2 seropositive and seronegative hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Methods: Matched-sibling T cells repleted HCT recipients with leukemia after 1st myeloablative HCT (1992 HCT ( -2003 were analyzed. Cox regression models were used to assess the potential risk factors (age; sex; cell source; underlying disease; conditioning regimen; year of HCT; CMV, herpes simplex virus [HSV] and HLA-A2 serostatus) associated with leukemic relapse and overall survival. Probabilities of relapse, acute and chronic GVHD were estimated using the cumulative incidence curves. Overall and relapse-free survivals were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results: Of 432 \"standard risk (SR)\" (acute leukemia in 1st remission and CML-chronic phase [CP])patients, 46% were HLA-A2 positive, 52% had a CMV seropositive donor, 15% experienced a relapse and 25% died. Of 336 \"high risk\" (all other underlying diseases) patients, 43% were HLA-A2 positive, 61% had a CMV seropositive donor, 45% presented with a relapse and 72% died. Risk factors for relapse included acute lymphoid (ALL) or myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to CML-CP (ALL: hazard ratio [HR] 8.7, p<0.001; ANL: HR 2.9, p<0.001) in SR patients and recipient HSV seropositivity (HR 1.9, p=0.006) in high-risk patients. Risk factors for death included acute leukemia compared to CML-CP (ALL: HR 3.5, p<0.001;ANL: HR 2.0, p=0.001) and sex mismatch (HR 1.8, p=0.004) in SR patients, and acute leukemia vs. CML-CP (ALL: HR 1.8, p=0.008; ANL: HR 1.5, p=0.01), age 40 or greater (HR 1.5, p=0.005), and HSV recipient seropositivity (HR 2.2, p<0.001) in high-risk patients. Neither recipient nor donor CMV serostatus affected the risk of relapse or death; furthermore HLA-A2 serostatus did not affect any of the outcomes including relapse, GVHD and death. Conclusion: This study does not provide evidence that donor CMV serostatus or HLA-A2 serotype affect leukemic relapse, GVHD or mortality in the setting of HLA-identical sibling HCT. The data do not support a clinically significant effect of HLA-A2-restricted CMV-specific lymphocytes on leukemic cells. EBV-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare, life-threatening complication of immunosuppression in hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) recipients. In certain cohorts (unrelated and haploidentical donor HSCT, T-cell depleted allograft), the risk of developing PTLD is higher. We describe the impact of specific routine surveillance and pre-emptive treatment on the course of EBV infection and development of PTLD in pediatric recipients of Tcell depleted, haplo-HSCT. Since August 2001, we monitor EBV DNA in peripheral blood of haplo-HSCT recipients by quantitative PCR weekly for the first 3 months, and monthly thereafter until 1 year posttransplant. Upon detection of increased positivity in 2 subsequent samples, patients are treated with rituximab (375 mg/m\u00b2/dose x 2 doses). In the presence of relapsed viremia and clinical EBV disease, patients are rescued with EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). A total of 27 patients have been enrolled so far, with a median follow-up of 23 months. Twelve patients (44%) developed viremia, with 8/12 (30% of the total population) presenting with sustained positivity requiring treatment. Treatment was well tolerated. After Rituximab, B-lymphocytes were undetectable in the periphery and EBV-load decreased to undetectable levels in all children from 43856 mean copies (range 2200-165700)/2x105 PBMC. However, in 4/8 patients (50%) a new increase of EBV load was observed after a median time of 18 days, accompanied by fever and fatigue in 1 patient and overt PTLD in 3 patients. In the latter HSCT recipients, viremia relapse and appearance of clinical symptoms coincided with the emergence of CD20-negative, CD19+ B cells. The 4 patients received 3\u00b11 doses of EBV CTL (5x105 cells/Kg body weight) and achieved complete remission with undetectable viral load after a median time of 20 days. The frequency of EBV-specific IFNg-secreting Tcells, measured by Elispot analysis, undetectable in all patients at time of EBV infection/reactivation, was restored by infusion of EBV-specific CTL to levels comparable to those of controls. Our results indicate that EBV infection/reactivation is common in pediatric haplo-HSCT recipients. Frequent monitoring may help to guide intervention. Pre-emptive treatment with rituximab is effective in 50% of patients, while restoration of EBV-specific immunocompetence by infusion of T cells with EBV-specific activity is always associated with successful prevention and treatment of PTLD.",

Early application of antimycotic agents is an essential prerequisite for successful therapy. However, standardized diagnostic techniques permitting rapid, sensitive and, no less importantly, economic screening for the clinically relevant fungi have been lacking. We have developed two different real-time PCR systems for quantitative analysis of pathogenic fungi. The Pan-AC assay* permits in a single reaction the detection of all important Aspergillus and Candida species, which are responsible for the great majority of IFI in immunosuppressed individuals. In view of the increasing incidence of invasive infections caused by hitherto uncommon fungal species, new diagnostic tests with very broad specificity are required. We have therefore developed an additional two-reaction Pan-fungus assay*, which facilitates quantitative detection of a wide spectrum of fungal species (n>50), including also the newly emerging pathogenic fungi. The assays display high sensitivity and show no cross-reactivity with non-fungal pathogens or human DNA sequences. We have established an additional rapid molecular assay based on PCR fragment length analysis of a variable region in the fungal genome permitting rapid identification of the fungal species present. In the current series, the new technical approach has been applied to the monitoring of 50 pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia during the post-transplant period. In view of the hitherto unclear clinical impact of molecular screening of IFI, serial blood specimens were collected during febrile episodes and investigated in a double-blind fashion. Fungal pathogens were reproducibly identified in peripheral blood of more than 20% of the patients screened, revealing predominantly mold (Aspergillus spp) infections. The new assays are readily applicable to routine clinical diagnosis and provide a rapid and economic approach to the screening and monitoring of invasive fungal infections. The study is ongoing to assess the clinical benefit of screening for pathogenic fungi by the highly sensitive and quantitative broad-spectrum real-time PCR techniques introduced.

To evaluate the influence of pretreatment with C-AMB on the outcome of allogeneic HSCT, a retrospective analysis including 270 consecutive allogeneic HSCT was performed at our institution between 1/2002 and 12/2003. Median patient age was 42 years, female to male ratio 49/51 and CMV positivity 83 %. Diagnosis was AML (n=90), ALL (n=72), CML (n=45), MDS (n=21), NHL (n=14), MM (n=8) or miscellaneous (n=20). Sixty percent (164/270) of patients were in early, the remainders in advanced disease stages. Conditioning therapy was TBI or chemotherapy in 237 and 33 patients, respectively. Donors were identical siblings (n=110), non-identical family members (n=3), matched unrelated (n=116) or mismatched unrelated (n=41). Pretreatment with antimycotics was reported in 74 cases (C-AMB, n=73; voriconazole, n=1) for FUO (n=23), not specified fungal pneumonia \u00b1 (n=23), pneumonia due to aspergillus sp.(n=18), hepato\u00a8Csplenic candidiasis (n=6), fungemia (n=3), and IFI by scedosporium prolificans (n=1). A cluster analysis could not detect any significant subgroups in this cohort of patients. Than a Cox regression model was used to test C-AMB pretreatment as an independent risk factor on TRM. Age in decades, disease stage, preceding neutropenia, renal impairment (creatinine > 1mg/dl) was also included. Only previous treatment with C-AMB (p=0.001; RR 3), and advanced disease stage (p=0.008; RR2,5) remained statistically significant. Subsequently, to identify patients at increased risk, we defined following strata: 1. patients without previous neutropenia; 2. patients with previous neutropenia; 3. patients with C-AMB pretreatment, creatinine < 1,0 mg%; 4. patients with C-AMB pretreatment and creatinine \u2265 1,0mg%; 5. patients with renal impairment for other causes; 6. patients with renal impairment or C-AMB pretreatment and antimycotic therapy during transplant procedure. TRM was 3.2%, 5.43%, 19.57%, 26.67%, 29.63% and 24.14%, respectively We conclude that patients being pretreated with conventional C-AMB have an increased independent risk for TRM (RR 4; p<0.001).",

From October 2004 to October 2005 we prospectively tested for hMPV-RNA sequential nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples from 20 adult patients with hematological malignancies submitted to allogeneic HSCT because affected with: AML 11, ALL 4, MDS 3, LNH and MM 1 patients. All patients were adults with a median age of 37 yrs, five were grafted by sibling and 15 by unrelated donor; 14 were conditioned by a standard regimen (TBI-CTX, BU-CTX, or BU-Melphalan), and 6 received a reduced toxicity regimen (Thiotepa-Fludarabine or Thiotepa-CTX). Acute GVHD prophylaxis for all patients consisted of a combination of Cyclosporine A and Methotrexate; six out 15 pts grafted by MUD received ATG. We analyzed by specific reverse transcription PCR assay for hMPV-RNA NPA samples collected before transplant, on day 0, +15, +30, +60, +90, +180. Sequence analysis performed on hMPV strains were referred to genotype A. No differences in nucleotides sequence were evidenced in 8/12 patients, where hMPV-RNA samples have been collected at different times. Such data confirm the presence of a prolonged infection due to the same hMPV strain, and probably exclude hypothesis of re-infections. Twenty-nine samples were collected before HSCT, 39 within 30 days and 37 from 60 to 180 days; 52/101 (51.4%) specimens and 17/20 (85%) patients examined resulted hMPV-RNA positive. Sixteen out 20 pts have a follow up longer than 100 days and 7/16 (43.7%) presented hMPV persistently detected in NPA. Patients hMPV-RNA positive, did not referred clinical signs of respiratory disease and at present, there is not evidence between hMPV infection and incidence of acute or chronic GVHD. Data obtained suggest that hMPV infection is common in adults with hematological malignancies and hMPV may sustain an asymptomatic and prolonged infection. Objectives: Patients who are neutropenic due to chemotherapy are at risk for developing life-threatening invasive fungal infections (IFIs), which contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in this population. We compared the efficacy and safety of posaconazole (POS), a new extendedspectrum triazole, with that of fluconazole (FLU) or itraconazole (ITZ) for the prevention of IFIs in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Methods: This was a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study conducted in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (\u2264 500 cells/mm\u00b3). Patients received oral POS suspension (200mg three times daily) or oral FLU suspension (400mg once daily) or ITZ solution (200mg twice daily) with each cycle of chemotherapy for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the incidence of IFIs during the treatment phase (from randomization to 7 days after last dose) as adjudicated by a blinded expert panel using EORTC/MSG criteria. Other analyses included the incidence of IFIs 100 days after randomization, clinical outcome (treatment success or failure) at the end of the treatment phase, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis of time to death. Treatment failure was defined as presence of proven/probable IFI, use of >3 days of empiric systemic antifungal treatment, use of intravenous study drug (or alternative POS formulation) for >3 consecutive days or a total of 10 or more days, discontinuation due to an adverse event (AE) related to study drug, or loss to follow-up during treatment. Results: A total of 602 patients were enrolled in the study (POS 304; FLU/ITZ 298 [FLU 240; ITZ 58] ). Significantly fewer IFIs occurred with POS prophylaxis than with FLU/ITZ prophylaxis. Analysis based on log-rank statistics of time to death 100 days postrandomization indicated a significant survival benefit in favor of POS in terms of all-cause and IFIrelated mortality (table) . Furthermore, there were significantly fewer treatment failures in the POS arm compared with the FLU/ITZ arm (36% vs 46%, respectively; P=.0091). The most common treatment-related AEs were nausea (7% vs 8%), diarrhea (7% vs 7%), and vomiting (5% vs 7%) in the POS and FLU/ITZ groups, respectively. Conclusions: POS was superior to FLU or ITZ in preventing IFIs and conferred a significant survival benefit in patients with AML or MDS and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.",

Russell Nottingham City Hospital (Nottingham, UK) Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus areus (MRSA) is a major nosocomial pathogen, endemic in most countries, with a dramatically increased incidence in the UK since 1993. MRSA causes serious morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, however there is little information concerning the incidence and impact in haematology patients in general, and in recipients of haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) specifically. We analysed the incidence and outcome of MRSA in a single centre transplant population over a five-year period. The total number of patients infected during this time was 34/645 (5%). The incidence in autologous, sibling and unrelated donor transplants was 3% (9/324), 6.5% (11/167) and 9% (14/154) respectively. There was a low rate of infection in the early years of the study (<4%/year), however an MRSA outbreak in the day unit in 2004 resulted in 22 patients becoming newly infected (representing up to10% of the transplant patients). Over 90% of all infections were clinically relevant, with over half (53%) of the patients having bacteraemia. There were three patterns of infection noted: those who were known to be MRSA positive at some time prior to the transplant (n=11), those who became positive during the neutropenia phase (n=4) and those who only became positive after engraftment and discharge post transplant (n=19). In the first two groups (early infection) 3/8 (38%) of deaths were directly attributable to MRSA. This included 2 patients receiving autologous transplants. In those with late infections, MRSA was implicated in up to 60% (6/10) of the deaths. In addition the morbidity, particularly in the last group, was significant. Patients with GvHD were particularly at risk of colonisation and recurrent infections requiring in-patient stay and prolonged treatment with antibiotics. Following an intensive eradication policy instituted in 2004 including: early routine screening protocols, cleaning and isolation procedures, and aggressive treatment strategies; the number of new MRSA infections dropped dramatically to less than 2% in 2005. In conclusion, MRSA in likely to remain endemic in our transplant population, however the use of robust early screening protocols and aggressive eradication strategies have effectively limited the spread of and morbidity due to this pathogen. T. Widmann, J. Schubert, U. Sester, M. Pfreundschuh, M. Sester Universit\u00e4tklinikum des Saarlandes (Homburg/Saar, D) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes significant morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Immunity against CMV is T cell dependent. We quantified CMV specific CD4 T cells in 7 autologous and 38 allogeneic transplant recipients weekly after stem cell transplantation by antigen induced intracellular interferon gamma production after CMV lysate stimulation. Furthermore, CMV specific CD8 T cells were quantified using MHC class I pentamers (n=7). CMV specific CD4 T cells were detectable on average 2,4 weeks (SD +/-0,5 weeks) after autologous (n=7, CMV IgG positive) and 3,4 weeks (mean, SD +/-2,3 weeks, n=38) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Donor specificity of detected T cells was proven by sorting of CMV specific CD4 T cells and identification of donor specific short tandem repeats by PCR (n=3, chimerism >95%). Early after transplantation, intraindividual CMV specific CD4 T-cell levels showed a marked fluctuation. During the early posttransplant leukopenic phase until reconstitution of CMV specific CD4 T cells, 13/38 (34%) allogeneic transplanted patients developed CMV viraemia, indicating a relationship between absence of CMV specific T cell immunity and viraemia. After reconstitution of CMV specific T cells, CMV viraemia was strongly associated with a drop in CMV specific CD4 T cells (14/19 patients, p=0,0005, Fisher's exact test), whereas CMV specific T-cell frequencies in non viremic patients were rather stable (14/16 patients). Moreover, no case of CMV viraemia was diagnosed after autologous transplantion, even during the early posttransplant phase of leukopenia. This suggests that immunosuppression and anti-GvHD therapy in the allogeneic setting directly influence T cell immunity and therefore may indirectly affect CMV replication. The levels of CMV specific CD4 T cells from long-term transplanted patients (> 12 months after transplantation) were significantly higher compared to healthy individuals (median 3,99% for patients (n= 31) and 1,82% for healthy individuals (n=50) respectively, p=0.01). In contrast to CMV specific CD4 T-cell immunity, preliminary data on CMV specific CD8 T-cell immunity (n=7 patients) indicate that CMV specific CD8 T cell levels are rather stable, even during episodes of CMV replication. These findings have implications for the monitoring of CMV specific immunity and may help to identify patients at risk for CMV related complications in the future. H. Visscher, PJ. Pagter, R. Schuurman, JWA. Rossen, T. Wolfs, AB. Versluys, J. Boelens UMCU (Utrecht, NL) Although human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) is known to reactivate during haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and is suggested to be associated with severe clinical manifestations in adults, the clinical significance in childrens remains controversial. In this study we investigated the incidence of HHV6 reactivation and HCT-associated morbidity and mortality in children. Between 1/2004 and 11/2005 50 patients, median age 6.6y (0.1-18.1), underwent 56 allogeneic HCTs. By quantitative PCR HHV6, EBV, CMV and adenovirus (AdV)-plasma loads were measured once a week. Clinical features, engraftment, number of transfusions, HCT-associated mortality and morbidity (like GvHD) were monitored and reviewed retrospectively. Antiviral treatment for HHV-6 reactivation was only given from 4/2005 for those with clinical symptoms assumed to be associated with HHV6. HHV6 reactivations were grouped in group I (no HHV6), group II (loads <1000cp/mL) and group III (loads >1000cp/mL). CMV, EBV and AdV-reactivations were treated according to local guidelines. 29 HLA-id and 27 HLA non-id grafts were used: 41 bone marrow / PBSC and 15 cordblood (CB) grafts. Median follow up was 11 mths. HHV6 reactivation occurred in 37/56 (66%) with 30/37 (82%) occurring within the first 30 d post-HCT. 19/56 (34%) had HHV6 loads above 1000cp/mL. Groups did not differ regarding sex, age, donor source or HLA-disparity. HHV6 reactivation was associated with higher all cause mortality in group III, grade 2-4 acute GvHD, chronic GvHD and higher platelet transfusion requirement. HHV6 was reactivated in 11/13 (85%) aGvHD cases at presentation and 8/9 (89%) cGvHD cases had previous HHV6 reactivation. In addition, in 26/29 (90%) of multiple viral reactivations, HHV6 was reactivated and in 19/29 (66%) HHV6 was the first virus to be reactivated. Of the deceased, 9/12 (75%) had multiple viral reactivations. HHV6 reactivation is common after HCT in children and is associated with serious aGvHD, multiple viral reactivations and with a subsequent higher mortality rate. Although the exact role of HHV6 reactivation in transplantation associated morbidity and mortality has to be elucidated, early detection and initiation of therapy might influence the outcome.",

Lymphoma (278), acute leukemia (182) and myeloma (160) were the main underlaying diseases. 375 patients were in complete remission and 285 (43%) were transplanted with persistent disease. 24 patients (4%) had a prior history of IFI. Determination of serum galactomannan was introduced in the last two years and data were available from 127 cases (20%). Nearly all patients received antifungal prophylaxis (639) (oral fluconazol in 576 cases-90%). An empiric antifungal treatment was instaurated in 190 cases (28%) and was more common in the allo population (40% vs 25%, p:0,007). Ambisome was the drug of choice in 120 cases (62%). IFI after SCT(EORTC criteria) ocurred in 32 patients (4,8%) (posible:17, probable: 7, proven:8). Median day of diagnosis was day +27 , and pulmonary disease was the most common clinical presentation. Aspergillus was the most frequently involved mold(60%). 16/32 patients with a diagnosis of IFI have died (50%), in 5/16 cases death was attributed directly to IFI and contributed in other 4 cases. IFI was more frequent among allo vs auto (14,4% vs 2,7%; p<0,0001); AL vs other disease (7,6% vs 3,7%, p:0,04); a previous history of IFI (17% vs 4%, p<0,02); severe GVHD(grades III-IV and extense C-GVHD on IS treatment) (30% vs 4%; p:0,0002) and disease not in CR (6,67 vs 3,47;p:0,059). A multivariate analysis selected type of S165 transplant(allo) (p:0,003; RR: 8, 76), previous IFI (p:0, 04; RR: 3, 9) , and severe GVHD (p:0,04; RR: 4,02) as the main risk factors for the development of IFI. Our findings shows that IFI had a low impact on mortality in the present series, 9/660 (1,3%) and that current fatality rate among SCT with IFI was 28% (9/32) although global mortality in patients with IFI was 50%, higher that the non IFI cohort. Advances in clinical management, incluiding anticipate diagnoses, a more appropiate use of antifungal drugs, and the presence of low numbers of really high-risk patients could be argued for explanation.",

Peccatori (1) (16) had T-cell depletion both in vivo (ATG) and ex vivo (CD34 positive selection by Clinimacs). EBV-reactivation was defined by a positive PCR (exceeding 50 copies/10 5 cells); patients with viral load of 1000 or more copies/10 5 cells were treated with Rituximab 375 mg/sqm weekly till a negative PCR, as pre-emptive therapy. Only patients with overall survival more than 60 days were considered evaluable for the study. EBV-LPD diagnosis included, in addition to EBV reactivation, clinical symptoms such as nodes, liver or spleen enlargment or central nervous system involvement. Results: In 66 of the 97 evaluable patients at least one episode of EBV-reactivation was observed. The median time to first reactivation was 61 days from SCT (range, 19-421 days). High-level EBV-reactivation (at least 1000 copies/10 5 cells) developed in 42 but only 8 of the latter developed EBV-LPD. Three patients died of EBV-LPD. Discussion: Our study population was at high risk of EBVreactivation because of intense T-cell depletion; thereafter the high incidence of EBV-reactivation is not surprising. However, pre-emptive therapy with Rituximab in patients with high viral load significantly reduced EBV-LPD incidence and EBVrelated mortality. (1) Introduction: Drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DAA) is approved in the EU for treatment of severe sepsis in adults with multiple organ dysfunction (OD). In the pivotal trial of DAA, stem cell transplant (SCT) patients were excluded as it was unknown if the benefit would outweigh a perceived increased risk of possible bleeding complications. Nonetheless for SCT patients who develop organ dysfunction in association with sepsis or graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD), mortality is extremely high, and pathophysiological considerations might favor DAA use. To evaluate the role that bleeding risk might play, a retrospective review was conducted. Methods: During a period of 1.5 years, the transplantations conducted at 16 stem cell transplant centers in 7 EU countries were screened retrospectively over a time period of 180 days after SCT via hospital notes. The predefined entry criteria were widely based on criteria used in prospectively conducted studies with DAA. Data on mortality, organ dysfunction, transfusions, bleeding events and laboratory values of patients meeting the entry criteria were documented. Results: Of 2,092 patients screened, 160 patients met the entry criteria. None of these patients was treated with DAA. The mean age was 44.2 years. For 68.1% of patients respiratory, and for 63.1% cardiovascular OD was documented; 31.3% suffered from both. Organ dysfunction was due to sepsis in 96.6% of patients; only 15.6% were attributed to GvHD. The mortality rate was 53.1% at 28 daysand 65.6% at 100 days post date of meeting entry criteria. The documented cause of death was severe sepsis including multi-organ failure in 49.1% of patients, refractory septic shock in 15,1%, respiratory failure in 19.8%. 20% of all patients experienced 62 bleeding events within 100 days after study entry. Conclusion: Entry criteria were met by 7,6% of SCT patients. Two thirds of the patients suffered from either respiratory or cardiovascular organ dysfunction, one third from both. SCT patients developing organ dysfunction are at high risk of death most often from sepsis and only <3% from bleeding complications. The extent to which the routine use of DAA in such patients might increase the rate of bleeding-associated mortality remains unknown, but the overall high death rate raises the possibility that any such increase may well be outweighed by a reduction in sepsis driven mortality. This possibility deserves further investigation. Funded by Critical Care Europe, Eli Lilly & Company",

Ewijk, J.J Boelens UMCU (Utrecht, NL) An association between respiratory virus (RV) infection and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is seen in lung transplant recipients. In haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) RV infection might directly progress to pneumonia or lead to immune mediated effects on lung function. We prospectively studied the clinical impact of RV infection in 54 pediatric HSCT patients. All patients with respiratory symptoms had a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) taken, and a PCR on all common RVs was done. The test was repeated weekly. Clinical symptoms at onset, and long term complications were recorded. IPS was defined as signs of alveolar injury in absence of active lower respiratory tract infection. BO was defined as obstructive lungdisease (a decrease in FEV1 of > 20%) and specific changes on HR-CT (airtrapping and mosaic parenchymal attenuation). S166 61 HSCTs were done from 31 matched donors and 30 mismatched donors. Median follow up is 11 months . Overall survival is 65%. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) \u2265 grade II occurred in 23%. Chronic GVHD occurred in 20%. In 23 patients a RV was identified; rhino-(15), parainfluenza-(3),influenza-(1) and multiple virus(4). Three patients with otherwise unexplained, typical viral symptoms were considered as RV positive, despite negative PCRs. Initial clinical symptoms, occurring within 2 weeks after HSCT, were usually mild. The virus was not cleared from the NPA. IPS occurred in 7/26 patients, after a median of 8 weeks post HSCT (range 3-12). Despite treatment with pulsed high dose methylprednisolone (HDMP)6 patients needed ventilation, 2 of them died. BO occurred in 4/26 patients, with a median onset of 4 months post HSCT (range 2-6). Pulsed HDMP was given, with only partial response. 2 patients died and 1 is awaiting a lung transplantation. In the RV negative group only 1/28 patients developed a severe pulmonary complication; IPS coinciding aGVHD grade IV. In a multivariate analysis (possible confounders HLA-disparity, source and GVHD \u2265 2) a RV-infection early in transplant proved to be a risk factor for developing IPS/BO (p= 0.005, RR 31, range 2.8-334). RV-infection early after HSCT is strongly associated with severe pulmonary complications. We hypothesize that persistence of RV and tiggered alloreactivity leads to fibrosis of lung tissue. Stringent isolation, close monitoring of pulmonary function and early treatment in case of symptoms seems warranted.",

Here we report our experience with three different treatment strategies for ADV infection in three consecutive cohorts receiving allogeneic transplants at a single center in the period from April 1999 to November 2003. In this single center retrospective analysis we evaluate the incidence of ADV-infection, ADV-associated mortality and transplant-related mortality (TRM) in pediatric recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants. According to different screening strategies for ADV as well as different strategies of treatment for ADV-infection three periods can be distinguished. In the first period (4/1999-11/2000, n=43) treatment of patients with cidofovir was started only in case of symptomatic ADV-disease. In the second period (12/2000-01/2002, n=36) patients with ADV-infection were treated with cidofovir and/or ribavirin earlier, based on detection of ADV-DNA or ADV-antigen in diagnostic specimen. In the third period (2/2002-11/2003, n=34) patients received ribavirin prophylaxis and in case of detection of ADV, preemptive treatment with cidofovir was started. With ribavirin prophylaxis incidence of ADV-infection reached 29% and thus was significantly lower compared to the incidence of 61% in the second period without ribavirin prophylaxis (p = 0.009, Fisher's Exact Test). No ADV-associated mortality was observed in the period with ribavirin prophylaxis and preemptive cidofovir treatment, while ADV-associated mortality was 9% and 14% in the first and the second period. Overall TRM was reduced to 9% in the period with ribavirin prophylaxis and preemptive cidofovir treatment, while TRM was 30% in the first and 28% in the second period. TRM in ADV-positive patients in the first period without ribavirin prophylaxis reached 66.7% (8/12), whereas TRM of ADVpositive patients treated with ribavirin prophylaxis and preemptive cidofovir was 10% (1/10, p = 0.012, Fisher's Exact test). Results from this retrospective analysis suggest that prophylactic ribavirin treatment reduces the incidence of ADV infection. Additionally, preemptive therapy with cidofovir may protect these patients from ADV-associated mortality and may also reduce TRM in general.",

The serological status of both donors and recipients are important factors for transplant outcome. Our aim was use the EBMT registry to study trends over time as well as analyzing the effects of age, gender, and country on the donor and recipient CMV serostatus. Patients and Methods: All patients in the EBMT registry for whom CMV serological status was known before SCT were included in the study. Since it is well known that the use a CMV seronegative donor to a CMV seronegative patient is favourable, there might be a selection bias in favour of CMV seronegative donors in the registry. Therefore, with the aim to decrease this selection bias, we included only donors to CMV seropositive patients in these analyses. Applying these criteria, 40311 patients and 18873 donors were selected from the registry database. The patients were transplanted 1985-2004. Logistic regression models were constructed predicting seropositivity using as covariates year of SCT, age, gender, and country for both patients and donors separately. Results: Females had a higher likelihood to be seropositive than males both among patients (OR 1.22; . With a median follow/up > 3-years in all groups, CBT recipients had a higher risk of developing any severe infection (85% vs. 69% in BMT/PBSCT), which was mostly due a higher incidence of severe bacterial infections before day +100. The 100-day and 3-year incidence of infection related mortality (IRM) did not differ between groups (p=0.2 and p=0.5, respectively). In multivariate analysis, the most significant risk factor for IRM in all 192 patients was monocytopenia (0.2 x 109/l). In CBT recipients, only neutropenia (0.2 x 109/l) on day +30 and low nucleated cell dose infused (< 2 x 107/kg) showed a trend for an increased IRM. Stem cell source had no impact on the incidence of invasive fungal infections, non-relapse mortality (NRM), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, CMV disease (7% vs. 6%, respectively) nor overall survival (36% vs. 39%, respectively). The number of mismatches in HLA (A, B and DRB1) had no impact on any outcome in CBT recipients. In contrast, in the BMT/PBSCT group the presence of any mismatch by low or high-resolution HLA typing (A, B, C and DRB1), increased NRM and reduced overall survival (P < 0.01). IRM was the primary or secondary cause of death in 61% and 59% of CBT and BMT/PBSCT recipients who died. Our results confirm the relevance of severe infectious complications as source of severe morbidity and NRM after VUD HSCT in adults, but suggest that CBT have a similar risk of dying from an infection if an accurate selection of a cord blood unit is done.

The main purpose of this study was to assess this subject in a series of 56 consecutive CMV-seropositive adults with hematologic malignancies who underwent UCBT at our institution and who received prophylactic treatment with high-dose IV acyclovir from day -5 until engraftment followed by IV GAN (5 mg/kg per day 3 to 7 days per week, first 38 patients) or oral VALGAN (900 mg once daily, last 18 patients) until day +100. All patients received thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin (Lymphoglobulin in 22 and Thymoglobulin in 34) as conditioning and cyclosporine and prednisone as GVHD prophylaxis. Median age was 32 yr (range, 18-47), HLA match was 6/6 in 2 (4%), 5/6 in 20 (36%), and 4/6 in 34 cases (61%), and the median number of nucleated and CD34+ cells infused was 2.2 x 10 7 /kg (range, 0.9-5) and 1 x 10 5 /kg (range, 0.1-5.7) respectively. The cumulative incidence of CMV infection was 43% at day 100 and 51% at day 365, and the cumulative incidence of CMV disease was 2% at day 100 and 16% at day 365. No clear differences between patients taking GAN or VALGAN were observed in the cumulative incidence of CMV infection (45% and 39% at day 100 and 53% and 48% at day 365; P=0.59) and CMV disease (3% and 0% at day 100 and 16% and 15% at day 365; P=0.97). Ten patients (7 receiving GAN and 3 receiving VALGAN) experienced recurrent CMV infection. Two of 8 patients who developed CMV disease, both in GAN arm, died from CMV. Twenty-two patients receiving GAN (58%) and 8 patients receiving VALGAN (44%) experienced 31 and 11 episodes of other severe infections. GAN was withdrawn in 2 patients due to renal toxicity and VALGAN in 2 patients due to neutropenia. Higher doses of nucleated (P=0.0026) and CD3+ (P=0.012) cells infused, presence of acute GVHD below grade II (P=0.0094), and use of Thymoglobulin (P=0.022) were associated with a lower risk of CMV infection. The CD3+ cell dose was inversely associated with the risk of CMV disease (P=0.0087). These results suggest that CMV prophylaxis with intravenous GAN or oral VALGAN reduces the occurrence of CMV infection and delays the development of CMV disease after UCBT. Further, these data show, for the first time, the importance of the CD3+ cell dose infused in the development of CMV infection and disease after UCBT.",

However, few data are available in non-neutropenic patients who represent a large population of patients with IA. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of GM Ag in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients with IA documented through microbiological criteria. Methods: The episodes of IA occurring in the hematology department are prospectively collected and classified according to the EORTC-MSG Criteria (Ascioglu et al.2002) . From the 2000-2004 data base, we selected proven and probable cases, rejecting possible cases, cases documented by GM Ag only, and those lacking neutrophil count at time of diagnosis (\u00b1 2 days). All the selected cases were documented by direct examination, culture, or both; or biopsy. The patients were classified according to their PMN count at IA diagnosis: Group 1 (PMN<100:mm3; n=15), Group 2 (PMN:100-500; n=15), and Group 3 (PMN>500; n=43). The GM Ag (Platelia aspergillus, Biorad) value considered was the higher patient:control ratio within \u00b1 5 days of IA diagnosis. The mean GM Ag ratios were compared between groups using the Mann and Withney test. Results: 73 episodes of proven (n= 6) or probable (n =67) IA were studied in 72 patients, including 20 allogeneic and 5 autologous SCT patients (AL or MDS:34; NHL:17; others:21) . The proportion of patients receiving antibiotics was comparable in the 3 groups. The cases were documented by direct (n=4) or culture identification of Aspergillus sp.

S168 However, the ratio of Gr 1 was significantly higher (p<.001) than that of Gr 2+Gr 3. Conclusion: In microbiologically documented (probable or proven) IA, GM Ag ratio is higher in deeply neutropenic (PMN < 100) than in other (PMN > 100) patients. This can explain previous discrepancies between series about the relevance of GM Ag in different populations of IA. In our experience, only the deeply neutropenic patients had a mean GM Ag ratio > 1. This should be considered in the routine use of GM Ag in nonneutropenic patients: a negative result does not eliminate the diagnosis of IA and should encourage other investigations.",

Koldehoff, D.W. Beelen University Hospital (Essen, D) The introduction of highly effective antimicrobial substances and toxicity reducing regimens in allogeneic haematopoietic blood stem cell transplantation (HSCT) makes a potentially hazardous therapy applicable to high risk patients with haematological disorders and coexistent infections or organ impairment. Among 445 pts who underwent allogeneic HSCT following myeloablative conditioning between 1/02 and 12/04, 14 pts (3%) developed post-transplant infectious CNS complications. All CNS infections occurred in severely immunocompromised pts with prolonged T-cell deficiency following in/ ex vivo T-cell depletion (n=8) or due to high dose steroid application for severe GVHD (n=6). Five pts had a history of probable or proven pulmonal aspergillosis before transplantation. Diagnosis of encephalitis based on neurological status, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and liquor findings. The most common CNS infection was cerebral mycosis observed in 7 pts (50%). Six pts (43%) were diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis and 1 pt (7%) demonstrated HHV-6 encephalitis. The overall mortality due to CNS infection was 71% and the median onset of clinical symptoms was 3 months (median) after HSCT. Compared to a previously reported historic patient cohort at our centre (Bone Marrow Transplantation, 23, 1999) , the overall incidence of opportunistic CNS infections after allogeneic SCT remained constant (3% vs. 4%) as well as the overall mortality due to CNS infections (71% vs. 67%). In contrast the rate of cerebral mycosis remarkably increased (22% vs. 50%). MR imaging could detect opportunistic infections in 7 cases at onset of neurological symptoms and in 4 cases after a subsequent confirmatory control examination. In three pts CT examination prior to MRI failed to display structural abnormalities although pts were symptomatic with neurological deficiencies. In conclusion our data show that cerebral mycosis and toxoplasma encephalitis presently are the most important causes of opportunistic CNS infection in allogeneic stem cell recipients and develop predominantly in severely immunodeficient pts. MR imaging is able to detect pathologic findings at early stages. There were no significant differences observed in frequency and causes of infections. However of the 8 patients with very low MBL levels (<400ng/ml) 5 died of transplant related mortality (TRM) (2 patients from sepsis, 1 from infection and GVHD, 1 from toxicity and 1 from a new malignancy). This is twice the TRM seen in the group as a whole (62% vs 30%). Conclusions: MBL levels are elevated for the first 6 weeks following ABMT in MBL wild type patients. TRM seems to be higher in profoundly MBL deficient patients. MBL could be operating to modulate infection, engraftment and GvHD, which may be related to the higher mortality observed in severe MBL deficiency. Results: 75 out of 872 HSCT recipients (8.6%) developed IFI. The incidence of Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) in allo-HSCT was 11.3% (42 cases) and in auto-HSCT 1.6% (8 cases). Regarding Invasive Candidiasis (IC) the incidence was in allo-HSCT 4.3% (16 cases) and in auto-HSCT 0.2% (1 case). Two out of 372 allo-HSCT (0.5%) were diagnosed of mucor infection and 6 (1.6%) suffered from IFI due to Fusarium solani. S169 C.albicans (32%) was the most common species isolated in IC followed by C.glabrata (26.8%), C.krusei (16.1%), C.parapsilosis (16.1%), C.tropicalis (7.4%). Non-albicans species were involved in 76.5% of IC in HSCT. Candidemia (54%) was the most common type of infection. In IA, A.fumigatus (60.8%) was the most common species isolated followed by A.flavus (21.7%). The cumulative risk at one-y of IA in Allo-HSCT was 12.9%. Conclusions: In this prospective study from RESITRA, allo-HSCT is a population at a high risk for IA with a cumulative risk at one-y of 12.9%. The incidence of IFI due to mucor or zygomycetale seems to be very low ( 0.5% ).",

Donnelly, T. de Witte University Medical Centre St Radboud (Nijmegen, NL) Background: Oral mucositis is recognised as one of the most debilitating complication of high-dose cytostatic chemotherapy used to prepare for HSCT but very little is known about its oesophageal counterpart as endoscopy is not routinely performed. We incorporate the HR-CT scan in the diagnostic work-up of fever during neutropenia to search for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This allowed us to speculate whether mucosal injury to the oesophagus can be determined using HR-CT scan. Methods: We selected 46 patients without cancer or immune suppression (controls) who had a normal oesophagus and measured mucosal thickness at upper part (UP), middle part (MP) and lower part (LP) of the oesophagus. Next we selected 30 patients having a HR-CT scan done for diagnostic purposes within 14 days after HSCT (subjects) with no evidence of oesophageal infectious disease due to Candida or Herpes species, and measured mucosal thickness at the same levels. We also documented oral mucositis according to the Daily Mucositis Score (ref). Results: The mucosal thickness of the UP, MP and LP respectively for the controls (mean\u00b1SD) was 4.1 mm (\u00b11.1), 4.2 mm (\u00b11.2) and 4.8 mm (\u00b11.3) and corresponding values for the subjects were 5.9 mm (\u00b12.2), 5.9 mm (\u00b12.0) and 7.7 mm (\u00b13.0). ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between subjects and controls of all levels. At the same time patients suffered from severe oral mucositis. Conclusion: Mucosal injury to the oesophagus can be objectively measured by HR-CT scan. Ref. Blijlevens et al. Support Care Cancer. 2004 Apr;12(4):227-33 L. Zimmer, T. Zabelina, B. Zoellner, F. Ayuk, N. Kr\u00f6ger, A.R. Zander University Medical Center Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) Purpose: The aim of this study was, (1) to determine pulmonary complications after unrelated stem cell transplantation (SCT), (2) to identify factors associated with development of post-SCT pulmonary complications, (3) to evaluate the diagnostic yield of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and (4) to determine the effect of BAL on therapy and on patient outcome. Methods: The study design was a retrospective review of 111 patients allografted from an unrelated donor between 1998-2001. To identify factors predictive for the development of pulmonary complications, patients were separated into 2 study groups: Patients with and without pulmonary complications. Pulmonary complications were defined as pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph or chest computed tomography scan, respiratory symptoms or obstructive or restrictive disorders in pulmonary function tests. Results: 53 patients (48%) developed pulmonary complications, of whom 44 were examined by bronchoscopy and BAL. Mortality in the group with pulmonary complications was 85% as compared with 26% in the patients without pulmonary disease (p=.000). In multivariate analyses pulmonary complications remained the strongest independent negative factor for overall survival (OS) (RR: 6.8, Cl: 3.5-13.34, p=.000). Development of pulmonary complications was significantly lower for patients with absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \u2265 500/ul on day 30 (p=.001) and for female recipients (p=.044). The diagnostic yield of BAL was 41%, with a BAL/patient ratio of 1. Infection was the most common finding, accounting for 89% of positive diagnoses. Fungal infection (Aspergillus and Candida species) was the most common type. According to the BAL results therapy was changed in 16 (36%) and verified in 10 (23%) cases. Patients who had a BAL that changed treatment or verified therapy had no better OS than patients with BAL that did not change treatment or verify therapy. The study also showed that patients undergoing diagnostic BAL did not have better OS compared to patients who had a nondiagnostic BAL. Conclusion: Pulmonary complications are a major negative factor for OS. The ALC on day 30 could be a useful and simple predictor of patients at high risk for pulmonary complications. The diagnostic yield of BAL was satisfying, whereas BAL was a useful procedure for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections. The impact of BAL on therapy and on patient outcome was limited.",

Krauter, M. Eder, B. Hertenstein, T. Schulz, A. Ganser Hannover Medical School (Hannover, D) Introduction: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a life-threatening disease after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation. PTLD after HSCT is associated with a rise in EBV-DNA load which can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based methods in peripheral blood samples. In our center we screened patients after allogeneic HSCT for EBV-DNA levels by light-cycler real-time PCR (detection limit > 800 copies/mL). Patients with an increase in EBV-genomes were treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). Patients and methods: 166 patients (69 female, 97 male) were screened for EBV-DNA levels either weekly or, after demission, at each outpatient-visite from December 2004 until November 2005. 160 patients were transplanted for malignant diseases (70 AML, 23 ALL, 24 MDS, 14 CML, 15 MM, 8 Lymphoma, 6 CLL) and 6 for aplastic anaemia. For haematologic malignancies conventional conditioning was given to 94 patients, 72 patients were treated with reduced intensity regimens. Most of the patients have been transplanted from a unrelated donor (n=94, 56,6%), 72 (n=43,4%) from a matched related donor. Transplants were PBSC in 141 patients, BM in 24 patients, and 1 patient received PBSC and BM. GvHD-prophylaxis consisted of CSA/MTX in 98 cases, CSA/MMF in 36 cases, CSA/MTX/steroids or MMF in 10 cases, 12 patients were transplanted with T-cell-depleted PBSC, and in 10 cases other GvHD-prophylaxis has been used. In total 703 samples have been obtained before and after transplantation. The median number of EBV-DNA copies was 800 (range 0-15.295.000 copies/mL). Two patients with excessive high EBV load suffered from PTLD and died. In 5 patients a sharp increase in EBV copy number was detected (median 350.000 copies, range 230.000-2.900.000 copies), and all five patients have been treated with rituximab (4 patients received 1 cycle, 1 patient received 2 cycles). Two patients showed clinical symptoms of PTLD with lymph node enlargement, abdominal pain, and three patients remained without any EBV-related clinical symptoms. Four patients responded to therapy and turned to PCR-negativity whereas one patient has currently still a low EBV copy number after a single course of rituximab therapy. Conclusion: Close monitoring of EBV-DNA and PCR-guided therapy with rituximab for EBV reactivation is effective in reducing EBV-viral load and may prevent development of PTLD.",

Seventy-seven episodes of early CMV reactivation (within day + 100) were observed in 54 SCT after a median time of 43 days post-SCT (range 12-97) while 23 episodes of late CMV reactivation in 15 SCT were observed after a mediant time of 161 days (range 104-407). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for CMV reactivation were: use or not of ATG in the conditioning regimen , p 0.009; and CMV R/D serology pos/neg. According to the type of CMV pre-emptive therapy, 4 groups were identified: ganciclovir (GCV), foscarnet (FSC), GCV + FSC, cidofovir (CDV). In 94 of 100 episodes the attack phase was performed with GCV, 30 (32%); FSC, 43 (46%); GCV + FSC, 18 (19%); and CDV, 3 (3%). respectively. Complete clinical and virological response was observed in 22 of 30 GCV(73%); 28 of 43 (65%) FSC; 10 of 18 GCV+FSC (55%); and in 3 of 3 episodes treated with CDV. An increase of baseline creatinine level > 1.5 was found in 16% of GCV; 16% of FSC; and 50% of GCV + FSC. During the attack therapy, no significant difference was found in the ratio of creatinine baseline/creatinine final level between GCV and FSC group; while a difference in the ratio of creatinine baseline/creatinine maximum level was observed in patients treated for a late CMV reactivation: 0.97 GVC vs 1.18 FSC, p 0.02. A maintenance therapy was performed in 68 episodes obtaining a complete response in 79% with GCV, 86% with FSC, and 81% with CDV. An increase of creatinine level > 1.5 was found in 21% of GCV; 39% of FSC; and 25% of CDV. A significant difference in the ratio of creatinine baseline/creatinine final level was found between the episodes of early CMV reactivation treated GCV and FSC: 0.99 vs 1.20, p 0.02. No patient had a severe renal impairment (III-IV WHO) or required hemodyalisis. Our data suggest that CMV reactivation can treated successfully with pre-emptive therapy based either on GCV, FSC, FSC + GCV, or CDV. For patients receiving GCV or FSC, a significant, though mild, worsening of renal function was observed in FSC patients with early CMV reactivation during the maintenence therapy.",

Bacteremia is a frequent complication that may increase morbidity. The use of profhylactic antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) is a common strategy, but the impact on development of bacteremia is not established. Aim: To analyze factors influencing the development of bacteremia in ASCT. Methods: We analyzed jointly two consecutive observational, prospective, multicenter studies carried out between 1998 and 2003 in 720 patients submitted to ASCT. All patients enrolled presented febrile neutropenia and received first line antibiotherapy. In the first sudy (1998) (1999) (2000) 121 patients received piperacillin/tazobactam + amikacin and 130 cefepime + amikacin. In the second study (2001) (2002) (2003) 218 patients received imipenem and 251 imipenem + glucopeptide. Results: Median age was 50 years (range 18-74). The most prevalent underlying disease were lymphoma (35%) and multiple myeloma (35%). Peripheral blood (PB) was the source of stem cells in 92% of patients, G-CSF was given in 80%, and prophylaxis with oral fluorquinolone in 59%. Median duration of neutropenia was 10 days (range 1-64). Bacteremia was documented in 108 patients (15%). Gram negative bacteria were isolated in 62 cases (9%), and Gram positive in 54 (8%). In univariate analysis, PB as source of stem cells (p=0.04), G-CSF (p=0.03), prophylactic quinolones (p=0.03), and duration of neutropenia <10 days (p<0.01) were associated to a lower risk of bacteremia. Regimes containing amikacin (p=0,05), G-CSF (p=0.03), prophylactic quinolones (p<0.01), and duration of neutropenia <10 days (p<0.01) were associated to a lower risk of Gram negative bacteremia. Only days on parenteral nutrition <8 (p=0.04) was associated to a lower risk of Gram positive bacteremia. In multivariate analysis duration of neutropenia <10 days was independently related to a lower risk of bacteremia and Gram negative bacteremia (RR 2.6 and 4.5 respectively; p<0.01). In total 14 patients (2%) died during the first 45 days, 9 due to infection. The development of bacteremia was not statistically related with a higher infectious mortality rate (2.8% vs 1%, p=0.15). Conclusion: Duration of neutropenia is the main prognostic factor for development of bacteremia during ASCT. Use of G-CSF and prophylactic quinolones are related to a lower risk of bacteremia, mainly by Gram negative bacteria.",

The optimal secondary prophylaxis has not been found so far since the application of standard drugs is hampered by potential ineffectiveness or intolerable side effects. This investigation describes haemopoietic cell transplantation of patients with a history of invasive or systemic fungal infection (IFI). The strategy was either administration of liposomal amphotericin B as secondary prophylaxis or an early switch to liposomal amphotericin B after administration of azoles. The 43 patients had a history of proven (n = 14), probable (n = 14) and possible (n = 15) IFI. Twenty-eight patients (65%) could be discharged from the BMT ward without signs of mycosis. Transplant-related mortality was 35%. Overall, 12 fungusrelated (IFI) deaths (28%) occurred. The percentage of fungus-related deaths was highest in the 'proven' group with 43% compared to 20 and 21% in the two other groups. Side effects of liposomal amphotericin B were low. A discontinuation of the drug was not necessary in any patient. Serum creatinine showed a slight increase to 128% (median) of the baseline (100%) allowing continuous administration of concomitant nephrotoxic drugs such as cyclosporin A. In conclusion, secondary prophylaxis with or early switch to liposomal amphotericin B facilitates allogeneic stem cell transplantation of patients with a history of IFI with minor side effects. However, fungal infections and transplantrelated mortality remain major problems in this often heavily pretreated subgroup of patients. Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (CMV-R) is associated with increased morbidity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, after the introduction of ganciclovir preemptive therapy, CMV-R can be successfully controlled if the recipient's immunity recovers. Although many investigations have already focused on CMV-R as a risk factor, data related to the impact of asymptomatic CMV-R on transplant outcomes is scarce. Accordingly, the present study analyzed the differences in the transplant outcomes the immune reconstitution according to the CMV-R after allogeneic PBSCT. Method: A total of 76 patients undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) were included in the current study. The transplant outcomes and immune reconstitution after 3, 6, and 12 months were analyzed according to the occurrence of CMV-R in 33 patients. Result: The analysis revealed a favorable prognosis for the group with CMV-R compared to those without CMV-R: p=0.0037 for OS, p=0.0204 for NRM, and p=0.05 for the risk of relapse. CMV-R was also found to correlate to the lymphoid reconstitution (p=0.024). In multivariate analyses, CMV-R was found to be a favorable prognostic factor in terms of OS (p=0.010, hazard ratio [HR] 2.948) and NRM (p=0.05, HR 2.665), along with a higher transplant CD34+ cell dose (p=0.003 for OS, p=0.002 for NRM), standard risk (p=0.023 for OS), and acute GVHD grade 0~2 (p=0.007 for NRM). Conclusion: In a PBSCT setting, CMV-R did not seem to be a poor prognostic factor in terms of OS and NRM, possibly due to the accelerated lymphoid immune reconstitution associated with CMV-R.",

The Graft versus Host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was based on oral Mycofenolate until day +30 plus Cyclosporin until day +180 from transplant and the viral infection prophylaxis was based on daily intravenous administration of Foscarnet. The degree of HLA compatibility (at the serological level for class I A-B and high resolution for class II DR), was 6/6 in one patient, 4/6 in three patients and 3/6 in other three pts.

The PTLD were characterized by aggressive lymphoma with multiple adenopaties and bone marrow infiltration in the patient affected by MM; in the second pt, affected by T lymphoblastic lymphoma we have demonstrated an infiltration of bone marrow by EBV+, CD20+ Large Cell Lymphoma; in the third pt, affected by AML, there was a contemporary spleen and neck lymphonode involvement. All pts received Rituximab, median infusion 2 (range 1-4), but only one showed clinical response. Among these 3 pts one with MM, died for PTLD, the other, with T-lymphoblastic Lymphoma and one for relapsed of AML, are died for progressive disease. This experience is in contrast with a previous paper reporting a low incidence of EBV reactivation after CBT although greater experiences were on pediatric setting.",

Koza Charles University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Objectives: CMV remains a major cause of transplant related morbidity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The aim of the study was to investigate the reconstitution of CMV specific cellular immunity in transplant recipients. Patients: 47 pts treated by peripheral blood stem cells (43pts) or bone marrow (4pts) transplantation was analyzed. Conditioning consisted of Bu/Cy2 (21pts) or FLU/melphalan in reduced intensity transplants (26pts). Mean CD34+ and CD3+ doses transplanted were 6.66 (2.23-19.0) x10 6 /kg and 2.77 (0.26-5.13) x10 8 /kg respectively. 85% of recipients were CMV seropositive, 15% seronegative, in 26% cases seropositive recipient received transplant from a seronegative donor. Lymphocyte subpopulations, CMV DNAemia and CMVspecific CD8+ T-cells (CTL) counts were monitored on day +30 and every 2 months afterwards. Comparison of CTL levels was made 6 months after SCT. A total of 131 samples were analyzed using HLA-A*0201 and B*0702 tetrameric complexes. Results: CMV specific T-cells were detected early after transplantation (1 month). Median CTL level in CMV PCR negative patients was 25.2 vs. 2.7/ul in PCR positive (p=0.0003). Recovery of CTL to levels >10 cells/ul was associated with protection from CMV. Only 6% pts above this threshold experienced CMV reactivation, among pts with levels <10 cells/ul 39% had PCR positivity. CMV seropositivity of the recipient was associated with more rapid CTL reconstitution than CMV seronegativity. Median CTL level at the 6 month after SCT was 47.0 in seropositive vs. 0.22 cells/ul in seronegative pts (p<0.0001). In seropositive pts with CMV reactivation the absolute numbers of CTL were lower (22.5 cells/ul), but the kinetics of reconstitution was faster achieving levels similar to pts without reactivation in the 12 month. Delayed CTL reconstitution was found in seropositive patients-seronegative donors pairs (9.6 cells/ul). After the viral reactivation episode the number of CTL increased. Prolonged steroid treatment led to a fall in the levels of CTL in all patients group. Conclusions: Tetramer monitoring allows efficient CMV immune reconstitution assessment. There is a good correlation between frequency of CTL and protection against CMV reactivation. Delayed reconstitution of CMV specific Tlymphocytes was associated with an increased risk of CMV reactivation. CMV serostatus influences the rapidity of immune reconstitution, which is faster in seropositive than in seronegative recipients.",

Ljungman Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, S) Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are important complications to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Many patients experience repeated reactivations and thereby need repeated courses of preemptive therapy increasing the risk for side effects. Monitoring of CMV-specific T-cell reconstitution might be a tool to assess the need for antiviral therapy. Methods: 46 allo-SCT patients were prospectively studied between engraftment and 6 months after SCT. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated by CMV antigen (AD-169) and the intracellular INF-g production by CD3+ T-cells analyzed by flow cytometry. The stimulation results were correlated to transplant factors, CMV infections, preemptive therapy, and CMV disease. Results: There was an association between the CMV-specific T-cell response and the peak CMV viral load. Patients with detectable INF-g production at 4 weeks after SCT had lower peak mean viral loads compared to patients with negative stimulations (log10 2.1 vs. 2.8; p=.03). There was a similar but not significant trend at 8 weeks (2.1 vs 2.6, p=NS). Patients who had received non-myeloablative conditioning were slightly more likely to have a detectable CMV-specific T-cell response at 4 weeks (43% vs. 22%; p=.09) but not at 8 weeks (27% vs. 22%) or 12 weeks (37% vs. 40%) after SCT. There was no effect on the specific T-cell response by the stem cell source, the donors' or recipients' serological status, the type of stem cell donor, or by acute Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV at any time point. Only 3 of 46 patients developed CMV disease. None of these patients had detectable CMV specific intracellular cytokine production in the test performed closest to the time of CMV disease. Conclusion: These results show that CMV-specific T-cell response might be able to reduce the rate of viral replication resulting in a lower peak viral load. Furthermore, nonmyeloablative conditioning seems to result in an improved early T-cell reconstitution. The reconstitution of CMV-specific immunity might be delayed in patients with CMV disease. These observations suggest that the detection of CMVspecific T-cells is useful to assess immune reconstitution against CMV.",

Hayden, L. Bacon, P. Browne, E. Conneally, E. Vandenberghe, S. McCann St. James's Hospital (Dublin, IRL) Objectives: Tools to diagnose invasive fungal infections (IFI) now include the detection of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and computerised tomographic (CT) imaging. Concern has been expressed, however, at the fact that the detection of GM by EIA does not appear to precede the detection of major lesions by pulmonary CT (Weisser et al, Clin Infect Dis 2005; 41(1143-49) ) and at the effect of systemic antifungal prophylaxis on the sensitivity of the GM assay (Marr er al, Clin Infect Dis 2005; 40(12): 1762-9). We therefore performed a retrospective single-centre assessment of our experience with caspofungin as treatment of presumed IFI in patients with acute leukaemia and in stem cell transplant recipients, with a focused appraisal of the utility of both GM and CT imaging. Methods: From March 2003 to September 2005, caspofungin was used for the treatment of proven, probable or possible IFI based on the EORTC/MSG consensus diagnostic criteria. Patients underwent screening for GM by EIA twice weekly. Systemic antifungal prophylaxis with either low-dose liposomal amphotericin (1mg/kg Mondays Wednesdays Fridays) or lowdose voriconazole (100mg bd daily) was routine practice during this period. Results: A diagnosis of proven (n=1), probable (n=1) or possible (n=13) IFI was made in 15 patients (12M:3F, median age(range):42(18-62)) during this period. Eight patients had undergone allogeneic SCT, 1 autologous SCT and 6 had acute leukaemia. All patients were receiving systemic antifungal prophylaxis with either liposomal amphotericin (n=12) or voriconazole (n=3) at the stated doses. At the time of commencing treatment-dose antifungal agents, all 15 patients had thoracic CT imaging read as consistent with IFI. Simultaneous GM measurements within 72 hours were negative (0.1 to 0.3 (Positive=>0.5)) in 13 patients, and positive in 2 patients (1.3 and 5.7). Summary: Although 13 of the 15 patients were only possible IFI by EORTC/MSG criteria, the clinical and radiological evidence required the introduction of treatment-dose antifungal therapy. These findings support previous evidence that detection of GM by EIA does not precede radiological evidence of IFI by CT. It is also possible that the use of systemic antifungal prophylaxis may have contributed to the decreased sensitivity of the GM assay in this context. These findings suggest that novel diagnostic algorithms for IFI including GM by EIA should also incorporate early CT imaging.",

Lafon CHU Bordeaux (Bordeaux, F) Background: Human herpesvirus (HHV-6) infection is a serious complication of allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The clinical diagnosis is difficult, the symptoms are not specific and usually looks like graft versus host disease. There is no study about the antiviral treatment of this infection. Patients and methods: From January 2001 to December 2004, we studied 63 patients who underwent allogenic HSCT in our haematological unit and presented clinical signs suggesting HHV-6 infection. All the patients were tested by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the blood. Forty seven patients had tissue biopsy or LBA with PCR to confirm the diagnosis. Only the patients with positive PCR in blood and tissues biopsies were treated. The antiviral treatments proposed were first FOSCAVIR and in second intention VISTIDE. The evaluation of the response was the resolution of the clinical symptoms and a negative blood PCR. Results: Fifty two (82.5%) patients were positive for HHV-6 by PCR in blood. Among these 26 (55.3%) were positive in blood and tissues. The patients positive in blood and negative in tissues showed infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV ,4), graft versus host disease (GVHD,14) , or not proven infection (3). HHV-6 infection was associated with acute GVHD in 16 (61.5%) patients. Clinically 13 patients had one localisation (4 colitis, 4 hepatitis, 2 interstitial pneumonia and 3 febrile rashes) and 5 had two localisations (2 colitis and rashes, 2 hepatitis and rash and 1 colitis and hepatitis). We treated 18 patients. Eight patients were not treated (5 cured without treatment, 2 relapsed of haematologic disease and 1 died of acute GVHD).We didn't observed any encephalitis. Among the 18 patients treated with FOSCAVIR 12 were cured. FOSCAVIR treatment was effective in all the patients without GVH (6 patients). In case of HHV6 infection associated with an acute GVH (12 patients) we observed an positive response only in 6 patients (50%). Conclusions: We propose the diagnosis of HHV-6 infection if the blood and the biopsy of the localisation is positive by PCR. The treatment by FOSCAVIR seems to be effective. A prospective study on a larger population of patients could allow to confirm these first results.",

Beelen University Hospital (Essen, D) The mortality rate associated with respiratory failure due to invasive fungal infections (IFI) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is exceedingly high. In this study we compare the impact of new antimycotic agents and early tracheostomy on the outcome of respiratory failure due to pulmonary IFI after allogeneic HSCT. We performed a retrospective analysis of 515 allogeneic HSCT recipients who were treated at our center shortly before or after the introduction of the new antimycotic agents. 16 out of 236 patients (pts) treated before the introduction of new antimycotics required artificial ventilation (AV) due to pulmonary mycosis. All 16 pts (median age:38 years) died during or soon after weaning from AV (median survival:75.5 days). The mean weaning time was 14.5 days, only one patient could be tracheotomized. In contrast to this, within a cohort of 24 pts from 279 allogeneic transplant recipients who required AV after the introduction of the new antimycotic agents, 9 (38 %) pts could be brought back to spontaneous breathing. The median survival of these pts was 396 days. The mean weaning time was 23.5 days, 67% of those pts underwent tracheotomy within ten days after initiation of AV. There were no differences between the two cohorts regarding underlying diseases, engraftment time or the use of myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimens. However, the cohort of pts who were transplanted during the era of new antimycotic agents had a higher median age (43 years,not significant) and included more mismatched and unrelated allografts with a higher incidence of GVHD grade II-IV (79% vs. 69%). It is, noteworthy that even though the number of pts receiving T-cell depleted allografts increased clearly in cohort 2, the incidences of IFI (12,7% vs. 15,1%) and subsequent AV (53% vs. 57%) did not change. Moreover, several clinical parameter indicate a remarkable improvement in the clinical courses of those pts: weaning time (P<0.02), extubation rate (P<0.01), and improvement of additional organ failures (P<0.001) were significantly increased in cohort 2, resulting in a long-term survival of four pts (mean survival:463 days), and a prolonged overall survival of mechanically ventilated pts (P<0.05). We propose that our observations reflect an improved management of these pts nowadays due to more effective antifungal treatment approaches including the use of new antimycotics as well as the advantages of early tracheostomy.",

S\u00e1nchez de Toledo Hospital Infantil Vall d'Hebon (Barcelona, E) Umbilical cord blood has proved to be a valid source of haematopoietic progenitors for transplantation despite its reduced number of cells, and permits partially HLAcompatible units to be used. However, haematological and immunological reconstitution is slow and the risk of infections is high. The aim of this study was to assess the probability of viral and fungal infections, their associated risk factors and mortality. respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), enterovirus, aspergillus, candida, fusarium and pneumocystis jirovecci were detected. The probabilities of infection from BKV, ADV, CMV, Aspergillus and RSV were 34%, 27%, 19%, 9% and 5%, respectively. The only risk factor for infection was GVHD II-IV p=0.004 ; RR: 1.9 CI (1.2 -2.9). 14 patients developed clinical disease (ADV invasive disease:4, invasive fungal infection:4, RSV pneumonia:2, severe hemorrhagic cystitis:2, CMV pneumonia:1, Pneumocystis jirovecci pneumonia:1), cumulative probability 29%. Infection-related mortality (IRM) was 21%. The risk factor for IRM was: GVHD II-IV p=0.028; RR: 6.5; CI (0.85-48.73). Conclusions: Infections mainly appeared in the first 6 months post-transplantation and were related to GVHD II-IV. The risk of severe disease was 29% and of infection-related mortality 21%. The risk factor for IRM was again GVHD II-IV. Although infections were caused frequently by BKV, ADV and CMV, IRM was directly related to severe ADV, CMV, RSV and fungal infection.",

Patients and methods: From February 1998 to November 2005, 136 patients with multiple myeloma (30), non Hodgkin lymphoma (46), Hodgkin lymphoma (49) and solid tumors (11), received Melphalan 200mg/m\u00b2 and PBSC (median dose: 4.65x10 6 CD34+/Kg). G-CSF was administered from day +5 to patients receiving less than 5x10 6 CD34+/Kg. Prophylaxis consisted of acyclovir 800 mg per day, while no antibiotic prophylaxis was given. The day after PBSC infusion, patients were discharged and admitted in our unit at day +5 or earlier in case of medical complications. Results. One hundred and six patients (78%) were discharged the day +1 and were admitted on day +5, (group A). Five patients (5%) required admission to hospital earlier because of fever (1), diarrhoea (1), severe oral mucositis (1), nausea and vomiting (1) and allergic exanthema (1). Thirty patients (22%), (group B), were not discharged: 4 of them due to early complications (3 fever and severe diarrhoea and 1 transient ischemic attack), the other 26 because of geographic inaccessibility. At day +5, the median ANC was 1. Severe extra hematological toxicity (grade III/IV) was evident in 12/10 6 (11%). All but one had GIII mucositis (1 GIV). One was febrile. During hospitalization, 108/136 (79%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia, 84/108 were considered FUO, 25/108 had a clinical and microbiological infection. In group A, 82/106 (77%) had fever, 14/82 (17%) documented infection, 68/82 FUO (83%). In group B, 26/30 (87%) had fever, 8/26 (31%) with proven infection, 18/26 (70%) with FUO. Median period of fever was 1 day (0-11) in group A, and 1.5 day (0-11) in group B. In all cases antibiotics were given for a median period of 5 days in group A and 6 days in group B. Antifungals were used in 5/82 and 2/26 patients. Median discharging day from transplant was +16 (11-57). In group A +16 (11-57), in group B +18 (13-28). Conclusions: In our experience early discharge after reinfusion and admission for neutropenia management is safe and feasible. This strategy could be cost saving and improve patients quality of life. Our patients did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. Next step will be to extend day hospital regimen to these patients and reserving their hospitalization only to those with severe complications.",

Urban Medical University Graz (Graz, A) Background: Procalcitonin (PCT) is considered a sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic marker of systemic bacterial infection. Methods: We analysed PCT together with C-reactive protein (CRP) in 56 patients of a pediatric hematology-oncology unit during 110 consecutive febrile episodes without evidence of infection, after administration of T-cell antibody (n=22), alemtuzumab (monoclonal CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H; n=8), interleukin-2 (IL-2; n=41), prophylactic donor granulocytes (n=9) or in patients with acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD; n=10) and compared the results with 20 episodes of gram-negative sepsis. Results: In the majority of the examined non-infectious episodes PCT and CRP rose to serum levels indistinguishable from gram-negative sepsis. Significant differences of peak levels comparing the IL-2 or GvHD group (PCT) or the T-cell antibody group (CRP) with the sepsis group were clinically irrelevant due to a wide overlap between all groups (see tables 1 and 2). Conclusions: PCT and CRP are of limited value as isolated diagnostic markers of infection in hematological and oncological patients, particularly in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, during T-cell directed immunomodulatory treatment, granulocyte support or acute GvHD.",

Primary IPA may develop during intensive chemotherapy courses before SCT and can exacerbate after allogeneic SCT.

Patients and Methods: Between April 2003 and August 2004 79 pts (42 m, 37 f, mean age 39 y) were admitted for allogeneic SCT. 26 pts received grafts from related and 53 pts from unrelated donors after myeloablative (n=63) or reduced intensity (n=16) conditioning. 58/79 pts (73%) had no history of fungal infection before SCT. 21/79 pts (27%) suffered from proven (n=1) or probable (n=20) IPA before SCT according to the EORTC definitions. In 8/21 pts (38%) CT scan revealed typical persisting pulmonary round lesions and/or an extended diagnostic work-up was feasible. Consequently, these 8 pts were examined by bronchoscopy, bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (TBB) before SCT. BAL was analyzed by microscopy, microbiological culture, galactomannan antigen (GM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of Aspergillus DNA. TBB were investigated by microscopy and Grocott staining. Results: Before SCT in microscopical and cultural analysis and the GM test of TBB and/or BAL Aspergillus spp. were not detected in any of the 8 pts with previous IPA. PCR for Aspergillus DNA were positive in 2/8 probes. After SCT, in 10/79 pts (13%) proven or possible IPA emerged, 5/58 pts (9%) without and 5/21 pts (24%) with primary IPA before SCT.

The relevance of fungal DNA detection must be evaluated further. Pts with previous IPA had a higher risk of exacerbation of IPA and an increased mortality after SCT. Thus, in these high-risk pts with previous IPA a primary antimycotic prophylaxis should be discussed. Introduction: Infections by opportunistic filamentous fungi are frequent complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Besides aspergillosis, non-Aspergillus moulds, such as Fusarium spp. are emerging at increasing numbers. In patients after SCT fusariosis is associated with a very poor prognosis. Unfortunately, an effective treatment strategy in fusariosis is not well established. Case: A 46-year old white female with progressive myelodysplasia was admitted for allogeneic SCT from an unrelated donor in January 2005. On day 15 after myeloablative conditioning with successive SCT, disseminated erythematous skin nodules appeared on limbs and back in the neutropenic patient. Multiple blood cultures were negative. First-line pre-emptive therapy with Caspofungin (C) was unsuccessful. A histological biopsy of a nodule yielded in Fusarium oxysporum. In parallel, in CT scan a mucosal swelling in ethmoidal sinuses was indicative of the primary focus. 10 days later we changed over to Voriconazole (V), which resulted in progressive disease. Repeated biopsies confirmed vital Fusarium oxysporum. After change to Terbinafine (T) plus liposomal Amphothericin B (L-AmB) from day 36 on, primary focus radiologically disappeared, skin nodules vanished and skin biopsy was sterile. Susceptibility testings of the isolated Fusarium oxysporum resulted in a multi-resistance with increased minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of azoles and echinocandins (MIC: V >8\u00b5g/ml, Itraconazole >16\u00b5g/ml, Posaconazole 8\u00b5g/ml, C > 32\u00b5g/ml). AmB was resistant as well. T was the only susceptible therapy against this Fusarium oxysporum (MIC 0,12\u00b5g/ml). Preliminary in vitro-combination testings could not proof a synergy between T and L-AmB. 11 months after SCT the patient showed no clinical or radiological signs of persisting infection. Conclusion: Fusarium spp. are emerging pathogens in transplanted patients. In cases reported in the literature, azoles or AmB are the most successful agents in these lifethreatening infections. However, susceptibility testings seem to be indispensable diagnostic tools. The isolated Fusarium oxysporum showed multiple resistances against azoles, including recently licensed Posaconazole, echinocandins and AmB. T is a very keratophilic substance which accumulate in skin. Thus, Terbinafine can be regarded as therapeutical alternative in disseminated fusariosis.",

Skapa, P. Keslova, R. Formankova, J. Stary University Hospital Motol (Prague, CZ) Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation can cause a life threatening disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Between January 2002 and April 2005, 89 children (median age 9.1 yrs) underwent allogeneic HSCT (64% from alternative donor). We tested 2888 blood samples drawn weekly during first 3 months after HSCT and less frequently thereafter (median 32/patient). CMV and albumin gene was quantified from whole blood DNA using real-time PCR. Viral load was normalized to 100000 human genomic equivalents. Samples with less than 100 normalized copies were considered negative. CMV viral load of 100 normalized copies was exceeded in 311 (10.8%) samples from 46 (51.7%) children, higher than 1000 in 121 (4.2%) from 27 (30.3%) children and load higher than 10000 in 24 (0.8%) from 13 (14.6%) children. Based on the viral load and clinical evaluation, threshold for preemptive therapy was determined to 1000 CMV copies. All the patients exceeding this threshold were given ganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir for at least three weeks and than directed according to trend in viral load. Despite this approach clinical signs consistent with CMV disease appeared in five children. Three of them died (CMV pneumonia in two, in one together with mucormycosis, pulmonary apergillosis in one, all confirmed on autopsy). In both patients with CMV pneumonia high quantity of CMV was detected in lung tissue but much lower in peripheral blood. In one patient CMV was also detected in endotracheal fluid and pulmonary exudates. In two other patients CMV genome was detected both in blood and stool supernatant during the course of diarrhea confirming CMV etiology in contrast to diarrhea due to GvHD. In both CMV viral load markedly decreased after ganciclovir treatment. The fifth patient developed hypoxemia and tachypnea in connection to interstitial pneumonitis during antiviral treatment of second CMV reactivation and was successfully treated with additional administration of cidofovir. PCR monitoring of CMV viral load has proven useful for guiding preemptive therapy as shown by only two CMV related deaths in 51.7% transplanted children with documented CMV reactivation. CMV detection also from other clinically relevant sites should not to be forgotten for disclosing the role of CMV in clinical symptoms. From our limited experience level of viral load detected in blood might not necessarily correlates with severity of CMV disease.

Granulocyte Transfusions were examined before three decades as a therapeutic strategy with no evidence of success because of the limited granulocytes counts available by the traditional cell seperation technique. But after the wide use of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating factor(GCS-F) and the growing ability of winning sufficient granulocytes count, it was reasonable to re-examine the efficacy and feasibility of granulocyte transfusion. We have analysed the data of 50 patients which had granulocyte transfusions in our centre in the last five years. The detailed patients\u00b4 characteristics are presented in the attached table.The indications of GTx were as follows: severe mucositis in 5 patients, severe infection in 21, both (severe mucositis and uncontrolled infection) in 22. Two patients had received GTx on a prophylactic basis because of preexistence of infectious risk factors in the history. The infectious indications were: Fever of unknown origin in 22 patients, proven or probable fungal infection in 16, bacterial infection in 1, mixed infection in 4. All the patients had received GTx from healthy donors whom were stimulated 12 hours before cell separation with GCS-F. The transfusions were given nearly once every 48 hours until engraftment. A total of 196 Transfusion were applied, with a median granulocytes count in one transfusion of: 10,10 x 10 8 /kg (2,44-71,25). Twenty-Nine (58%) of the patients had responded to the therapy with normalization or regression of clinical and laboratorial signs of infection or mucositis, 45 (90%)were alive at the day 30 after transplantation, 24 (48%) at the day 100. Of the patients who had fungal infection were 14 (87,5%) alive at day 30, and 8 (50%) at day 100. Five patients had GTx only because of mucositis, 4 of them had a good response, and no fatal complications of mucositis were recorded in the whole analysis group. All the five deaths before the day 30 were caused by infection, but among the 26 (52%) deaths until the day 100, 16 (61%) were attributed to infectious complications. Conclusion: We feel that granulocyte transfusions are of clinical value as an adjuvant therapy (a long with targeted use of antibiotics) in stabilizing the patients with severe neutropenia problems until the stable engraftment.",

Min Yonsei University College of Medicine (Seoul, KOR) Patients undergoing HSCT are at high risk of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. We report an analysis of VZV reactivation after HSCT in 311 HSCT recipients (96 auto-HSCT, 215 allo-HSCT) receiving prophylaxis with oral acyclovir 400-800 mg/day, administered until immunosuppression was discontinued (median: 146 days, range: 29-622 days). Twenty-seven (8.7%) developed post-HSCT VZV reactivation (8/96, 8.3% in auto-HSCT vs 19/215, 8.8% in allo-HSCT). Seventeen received allo-HSCT from HLA-matched sibling donors. Fourteen patients received the myeloablative HSCT (14/164, 8.5%) and 5 the reducedintensity HSCT (5/51, 9.8%). The incidence of VZV reactivation was not different according to the TBI containing (12/126, 9.5% vs 15/185, 8.1%). The incidence of VZV reactivation was higher tendency in the ATG containing preparative regimen group (6/44, 13.6%) compared to the non-ATG group (21/267, 7.8%) (P = 0.164). The median time of onset was 400 days (range: 52-1652 days) after HSCT. The median time of VZV reactivation after auto-HSCT (median: 233.5 days) was earlier than after allo-HSCT (median: 434 days, P = 0.023). And the median time of VZV reactivation after myeloablative HSCT (median: 549.5 days) was later than after the reduced-intensity HSCT (median: 383 days, P = 0.02). There was no disseminated case. Fifteen of these 27 (55.6%) patients had VZV reactivation after 1 year following HSCT. VZV reactivation developed median 156 days (range: 15-1542 days) after acyclovir prophylaxis withdrawal. Viral reactivation was successfully suppressed by acyclovir prophylaxis, with only 1 case of breakthrough infection (3.7%). Of the 27 patients with VZV infection, 4 (14.8%) had chronic GVHD when VZV reactivation developed. All patients responded to acyclovir or famciclovir. One (3.7%) and 13 (48.1%) patients with VZV reactivation developed postherpetic infection complication and post-herpetic neuralgia, respectively. Chronic GVHD and relapse developed after VZV reactivation in 4 (14.8%) patients, respectively. No mortality was directly attributed to VZV infection. We conclude that the incidence of VZV reactivation had no correlation with the type of transplantation or conditioning regimens and the onset of VZV reactivation after HSCT was later in the conventional allo-HSCT than other HSCT. We also conclude that VZV reactivation might be developed after 1 year following HSCT, so long-term acyclovir prophylaxis may be helpful for prevent VZV reactivation after HSCT.",

Zubarovskaya, B. Afanasjev Pavlov's State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RUS) Cytomegalovirus infection is one of the main causes of infection complication and infection-associated mortality after allogeneic haemopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The aim of the study was to estimate the rate and clinical features of early CMV-reactivation after allo-HSCT in depending on age, stem cell source, type of transplantation, conditioning regimens (CR) and CMV-serologic status of donor/recipient (D/R). We analyzed data of 73 patients (pts) after allo-HSCT performed since November of 2000 till May of 2005, 49 children before 21 years old (yo) after matched related (20) and unrelated (29) in comparing with 24 adults after related (8) and unrelated (16) HSCT. The diagnoses in children group were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-30, acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)-9, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-3, aplastic anemia (AA)-3, lymphomas-2, Kostmann's syndrome-1, hypereosinophilic syndrome-1. In control group ALL-7, AML-5, CML-6, Lymphomas-6. Source of SC was bone marrow (BM)-20 pts, peripheral blood (PB)-49 pts. Conditioning regimens (CR) were myeloablative in 41 pts, non-myeloablative in 32 pts. ALG was used in 50 pts mostly in unrelated HSCT. CMV-serologic status of D/R were +/+ -36 pts, +/-7 pts, -/+ -25 pts, -/--5 pts. For monitoring of CMV we used qualitative and quantitative PCR twice a week. Results: early CMV-reactivation developed in 35 (71%) pts of children, in 14(58%) pts >21yo (p=0,02). CMV disease caused death in 20% of children and 12,5% of adults. There was no significant difference between related and unrelated transplantations in both age groups as there is no dependance on source of HSC. In children CMV reactivation occurred after myeloablative vs non-myeloablative CR in 76% vs60% and in adults 100% vs 44%, (p=0,03). In children without vs with acute GVHD CMV-reactivation occurred in 58% vs 72%), in adults 56% vs 64% (p=0,04). The early CMVreactivation correlated with acute GVHD III-IV grade (p=0,15). Conclusion: the rate of early CMV-reactivation after allo-HSCT is higher in children then in adults, after myeloablative vs nonmyeloablative CR. There is no significant difference in related and unrelated HSCT and in source of HSC in both age groups. In children early CMV-reactivation correlates with acute GVHD and increases with its grade.",

Ciceri San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, I) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease are major complications of allogeneic HSCT. In TCD haplo-HSCT setting, the delayed immune recovery results in prolonged risk of post-transplant CMV reactivation. Pre-emptive therapy based on detection of CMV, is effective to reduce risk of CMVassociated sickness and death. Prolonged ganciclovir (GCV) treatment is limited by myelotoxicity, particularly after CD34+ selected HSCT. We performed a study to evaluate the efficacy of foscarnet as single agent pre-emptive treatment of CMV reactivation. We treated with foscarnet 31 patients with a median age 52 (range 17-67), affected by AML (20 patients), solid tumors (3 patients), ALL (3 patients), NHD (2 patient), HD (1 patient), MM (1 patient), CML (1 patient). 26 patients were evaluable for CMV reactivation (overall survival > 30 days from HSCT). All patients received CD34+ selected allogeneic HSCT from haploidentical donor after myeloablative conditioning. Host/donor CMV status was: 21/26 +/+, 4/26 +/-, 1/26 -/-. Median CD3+ cell counts at time of CMV reactivation was 4/mcl (range 0-857). Patients were monitored for CMV quantitative pp65 antigenemia twice weekly; response to treatment was defined as negativization of pp65 antigenemia for at least 2 consecutive determinations under treatment. The first detection of pp65 antigenemia in peripheral blood after HSCT occurred at a median time of 30 days (range 15-47), the last at 216 days (median time follow-up 213 days, range 37-900). Median duration time of pre-emptive treatment was 14 days with no difference among drugs. 53 CMV reactivations were treated with pre-emptive therapy and 40 (75%) were completely controlled after 1^ line treatment: 29/34 (85%) after foscarnet 90 mg/kg twice daily, 2/8 after GCV 5 mg/Kg twice daily, 9/11 after valganciclovir 900 mg twice daily. In 7 cases, reactivation were controlled after a 2^ line therapy and 1 after a 3^ line. 5 patients died with persistence of CMV pp65 positivity, only one death was due to CMV disease (pneumonia). Our experience confirm the relevance of foscarnet as singleagent pre-emptive treatment of CMV reactivation in T-cell depleted allogeneic HSCT recipients. Preliminary data are promising also for the use of valganciclovir.",

Due to previous data showing that high doses of liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) are well tolerated, we designed an open-label, pilot multicentre study of weekly administration of 10mg/kg of LAB in acute leukemia (induction or consolidation) and allogeneic myeloablative SCT patients Patient and Methods: The study was initiated at Henri Mondor and St-Louis Hospitals (10 patients), Paoli-Calmettes Institute being secondary involved (13 patients), and conducted between February 2004 and June 2005. Patients were either treated for 4 weeks (AL) from the beginning of chemotherapy or 8 weeks (SCT) from transplant. Treatment consisted of a 2 hour weekly infusion of 10mg/kg LAB. Premedication was not allowed prior to day 1 study drug infusion. The primary endpoint was the incidence of reported adverse events occurring during the course of prophylaxis treatment. Results: Twenty three patients (14 males and 9 females), mean age 44 years (range: 20 to 79) were treated in this interim analysis (8 ASCT and 15 AL). Safety was monitored with particular attention to infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and nephrotoxicity. In a total of 60 infusions, 5 IRRs (8.3%) occurred (flush, shock, thoracic pain, bone pain and dyspnoea). These were exclusively observed on day one in 5 patients (21%). Seven patients (30%) reached serum creatinine (SCr) \u2265 1.5 times their baseline values. In the AL group, no patient discontinued LAB or required dose reduction during the study. In the ASCT group, 4 patients discontinued after the first infusion, 3 for IRRs and one for SCr increase related to the study drug and other factors, including reactions to concomitant drugs. One additional ASCT patient had discontinued study drug following the third infusion for SCr increase. Mean duration of prophylaxis was 18 days (range: 10-28) in the AL patients and 14 days (range: 6-31) in the ASCT patients. Conclusion: A weekly dose of 10 mg/kg appears to be very well tolerated during induction or consolidation therapy for AL. In the allogeneic SCT setting where multiple drugs are concomitantly administered, appropriate timing for the initiation of high dose LAB prophylaxis is yet to be determined in order to optimise the safety profile of this regimen.",

Jaskula (1) Thirty-six recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were followed for a number of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) copies beginning from 2 weeks after transplantation and thereafter in one to two weeks intervals. The presence of 10 EBV-DNA or CMV-DNA copies / 100 000 blood cells was chosen as a cut off point. Thirty seven percent, 52% and 19% of patients were positive for CMV-DNA while 42%, 54%, 21% of the patients were EBV-DNA positive at 0-50, 50-150 and over 150 days after transplantation, respectively. Range of positivity expressed by a number of viral copies in positive cases was rather higher in patients receiving Fludarabine and ATG or Campath as compared to patients receiving sibling transplantation without these immunosuppressive agents in conditioning regimen (median value: 14 vs 26 EBV-DNA copies per 100 000 blood cells and 114 vs 153 CMV-DNA copies per 100 000 blood cells). Elevated number of CMV-DNA copies was indicative for Gancyclovir pre-emptive treatment in CMV patients and tapering of CsA in EBV-DNA positive cases. There was no apparent clinical manifestation of CMV except for fever, marrow depression and arthralgia. In the course of EBV reactivation one patient developed lymphadenopathy, 12 patients had increased fraction of CD20+ cells in blood, one encephalitis and in two cases pure red cell aplasia was clinically apparent. In addition to clinical complications which may be attributed to CMV or EBV reactivation in the group of patients positive for these viruses reactivation 8 fatal cases were noted in the course of sepsis (2 pts) and acute GvHD (5 pts). Majority of patients showed either CMV or EBV reactivation at different time post transplant. Only six patients did not show elevation of either EBV or CMV copies in any time post-transplant. Notably, none of these patients developed acute GvHD or any severe transplant related complications. This study shows that EBV and CMV reactivation is frequent post HSCT, especially in patients receiving ATG or Campath and Fludarabine as a part of conditioning regimen. Early detection enables implementation of pre-emptive measures especially needed as clinical manifestation of these viruses reactivation may cause severe and life-threatening complications.

Iriondo Hospital Marques de Valdecilla (Santander, E) Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality in the posttransplantation period. We analyze differences in incidence, presentation and clinical characteristics of CMV infection in myeloablative (ALO) and non myeloablative allogeneic (RIC) stem cell transplantation, and recognize risk factors associated with it. Patients and methods: between 1999 and 2004, 130 patients underwent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation at our institution, (87 ALO; 43 RIC). Risk factors studied were: gender, age at transplantation, donor and recipient CMV serostatus, stem cells source, number of previous treatments, use of fludarabine before or during conditioning, and development of acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). Results: We did not find any differences between both groups in gender, donor and recipient CMV serostatus and development of acute or chronic GvHD. Moreover, in RIC group donors and recipients were older than ALO group (donor: 47 vs 37 years; p= 0,001 and recipient: 47 vs 37 years; p=0,0013). Peripheral blood as the principal stem cell source and multiple previous treatments were characteristic in RIC group. CMV infection or disease incidence was different between both groups (ALO 15%, RIC 37%, p = 0,007) and 72% patients had received fludarabine before or during conditioning. Relative risk associated with RIC was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1,32 -4,69) but it was not related with an increase in mortality. The groups did not differ substantially at the day of onset CMV infection (ALO 50 days, RIC 52 days, p > 0,05). Recurrence of CMV infection and CMV disease was more frequent in RIC group (37% vs 28%) and ALO group ( 38% vs 25 %) respectively, without statistical significance. In univariate analysis risk factors associated with CMV infection were: non myeloablative conditioning (p = 0,005), receptor age at transplant > 50 y (p = 0,002), the use of 3 or more lines of treatment (p = 0,005) and use of fludarabine previous or during conditioning (p= 0,00005), but only the last one showed significance in multivariate analysis (p=0,01). Conclusions: In our study, we have seen that incidence of CMV infection is higher in patients received reduced intensity conditioning and risk increases when fludarabine is added at treatment.",

Bahar Shariati Hospital (Tehran,IR) Purpose: To evaluate the potential advantages of imipenem/cilastatin in control of fever in neutropenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Patients and Methods: In this single-center study, 111 febrile episodes in 104 neutropenic HSCT recipients with a mean age of 26 years were randomized to treatment either with Imipenem/cilastatin 1 g every 8 h i.v. or cefepime 2 g every 8 h i.v. per day. If fever persisted, sequential antibiotics were added in 72-hour intervals: vancomycin, amikacin and amphotericin-B. The study population was at serious risk of a poor outcome, since 73.5% and 26.5% of febrile events occurred after allogeneic and autologous HSCT respectively. Results: The median total duration of neutropenia was 10 days, and the median leukocyte count at study inclusion was 0.16 x 10 9 /l. The two patient groups were comparable in terms of risk factors. Bacteremia was found in 20.6%, other microscopically documented infections in 9.8%, clinically documented infections in 20.6% and fever of unknown origin in 49% of the febrile episodes. Most (102) febrile episodes were evaluable for response. No significant difference was found between two groups in terms of success rate (73.1% versus 62%), empirical addition of vancomycin (38% versus 26.2%) or median duration of antibiotic therapy (7 days in both).The difference between imipenem/cilastatin and cefepime was statistically significant for median duration of fever (1.5 versus 2 days) and median time of resolution of neutropenia (12 versus 14 days) . The overall response rates to initial monotherapy was significantly higher for HSCT recipients with thalassemia, MM, lymphoma and AA, than recipients with ALL, AML, CML and CLL and for episodes of fever of unknown origin than episodes of clinically documented infections (87.8% versus 12.2%). In episodes of success without modification, the median duration of neutropenia before entry was longer than episodes when vancomycin was added. No patient died from the infection. Both antibiotic regimens were well tolerated, the study treatment being stopped only in 1 patient because of toxicity (cutaneous allergy to imipenem/cilastatin). Conclusions: Both regimens are effective and well tolerated when used as initial empirical treatment for HSCT recipient with prolonged neutropenia. But imipenem/cilastatin may be more effective than cefepime, as evidenced by a significantly better response in two outcome measures and in one subgroup of patients (AML). J.R. Cabrera, I. Krsnik, R.

(Madrid, E) We have co-infused mobilized purified hematopoietic stem cells from a third party donor to shorten neutropenia in single unit cord blood transplantation (CBT). We describe postengraftment infections in 33 adults (22 male, median age 30, range 16-59) with high-risk hematological diseases. Pre-CBT serology was: toxoplasma 12 positive/13 negative (4 received HSC from a seropositive donor)/8 unknown; 30 were positive for CMV. Seven patients were HBsAb(+), HBsAg(-) and 1 HBsAg(+) HBsAb(-). ANC>500/uL was achieved by 32/33, median time 10 days (9-36) and full CB chimerism by 32/33 cases. Most significant infections occurred after ANC recovery. There were 34 episodes of CMV reactivation (3 deaths<day+60 of CMV peumonitis). Of 3 patients with CNS toxoplasmosis (2 sero+ pre-CBT), 1 died as a result (day +70), 1 of acute GVHD (+120) and 1 is alive on Fansidar (+570). One patient had visceral leishmaniasis (day +180) (BM aspirate for FUO; alive on amphotericin, day +410). Seven patients developed hemorrhagic cystitis, 6 related to polyomavirus (PCR on urine): 4 resolved with no treatment, 2 with cidofovir or leflunomide, one had asymptomatic viruria. HBsAg reappeared in 3/7 HbsAb(+) HBsAg(-) patients (1 asymptomatic, 1 acute hepatitis and 1 cirrhosis). A HBsAg(+) patient was uneventfully transplanted on adefovir. Eight late (>120) episodes of HZV were seen. A 27-year-old Spaniard died (day +39) of tripanosomiasis (BM aspirate for FUO, positive PCR). Activation of pre-CBT transfusion-related infection is suspected. CBT recipients suffer a high number of non-bacterial postengraftment infections, which seem related to delayed recovery of cell-mediated immunity. CMV heads the list but early diagnostic techniques and antivirics are available. Our toxoplasma cases have prompted us to use prophylaxis in seropositive patients. HBV reactivation among HBsAb(+) S180 HBsAg(-) patients raises the issue of prophylaxis during CBT versus serological monitoring and pre-emptive therapy. Leishmaniasis is endemic among our dogs, so we search for it in FUO (BM examination and culture). Polyomavirus viruria (50% of BMT recipients) precedes symptoms but the value of prospective monitoring and antivirals is unknown. CBT infections require wide pre-BMT screening, close analytical and clinical monitoring, prophylactic/preemptive strategies or early aggressive therapy and innovative immunotherapeutic approaches.

Sanchez, R. de la Camara Hospital Universitario de la Princesa (Madrid,E) Objective: To assess the clinical value of two commercial quantitative plasma CMV-PCR assays in allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patients by comparing the results obtained with the PCR with those obtained by antigenemia. The techniques studied were cobas\u00ae amplicor\u00ae CMV monitor test, Roche Molecular System (CA) and a real time PCR affigene\u00ae CMV trender, Sangtec Molecular Diagnostics (ACT). Methods: All patients were monitored during 10 months post-SCT with antigenemia and PCR CA. A total of 562 blood samples from 30 patients (23 mieloablative and 7 nonmieloablative SCT; 25 HLA identical siblings and 5 from unrelated donors) were tested prospectively. 27 CMV patients (seropositive or negative with seropositive donor) received high dose of acyclovir as prophylaxis. Antigenemia was considered positive when one or more positive cells were detected (\u2265 1 + cell/2x105 PMNs). PCR was considered positive when more or equal than 600 DNA copies/ml were detected. A total of 86 samples were retrospectively tested with real time PCR ACT: all positive samples by antigenemia and/or PCR CA (n= 57 samples); and negative samples by antigenemia and PCR (<600 copies/ml) but with more than 50 copies/ml and less than 600 by manual calculation (n\u00ba= 29 samples). DNA was prepared from 200 \u00b5l plasma using affigene\u00ae DNA extraction kit. The limit of detection (LOD) is 180 copies/ml for affigene\u00ae CMV trender. Results: All CMV seronegative patients with a seronegative donor (n=3) were antigenemia and PCR CA negative. Seropositive patients (n=27): 14 had a positive antigenemia and/or PCR CA with a total of 23 CMV infection episodes. None developed CMV disease. Only one patient had a positive PCR CA with a negative antigenemia. PCR CA detected 10 out of 23 CMV episodes. Overall there were 44 positive antigenemias (belonging to 13 patients): 23 were PCR CA positive, 20 PCR CA negative and 1 inhibited. Real time PCR ACT detected 14 out of 23 CMV infection episodes. Of the 44 positive antigenemias: 25 were PCR ACT positive, 15 PCR ACT negative, 1 inhibited and 3 were not tested (not enough sample). Conclusion: Results were comparable for CA and ACT. Both of them are useful methods to monitor CMV infection in SCT patients. The main advantage of ACT is its rapidity. Antigenemia (pp65) detected a higher number of episodes than any of the PCR based methods.",

Fern\u00e1ndez H. U. Puerta de Hierro-UAM (Madrid, E) Background: Reactivation of human polyomaviruses types BK and JC (BKV, JCV) is recognized as a relatively frequent and potentially severe event (generally as a hemorrhagic cystitis) in patients undergoing hematopoietic transplantation. The diagnosis of the reactivation of those viruses is usually based on the employment of PCR, viral cultures and/or electronic microscopy (EM) in urine specimens. However, those techniques are not easily available for many transplant centers. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of immunocytochemistry in the diagnosis of reactivation of BKV and JCV in the urine of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. Material and method: In 42 urine specimens from 12 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation, cytospin smears were prepared for Papanicolau stain and immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal antibody anti-JC/BK (NCL-JCK Novocastra). Results: In the 4 patients (in days +15, +68, +76 y +87 of the transplant) where cells containing viral inclusion bodies (\"decoy cells\") were seen, immunocytochemistry was positive. Two of those cases presented with macroscopic hematuria, 1 case with microscopic hematuria and 1 case was asymptomatic and with normal urine. EM and PCR showed the presence of BK virus in 3 cases and BK and JC virus in 1 case. In the specimens from the rest of the patients (8) the viral cytopatic effect was not seen in the cytological study and immunocytochemistry was negative. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the study of urine specimens with Papanicolau stain and immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal antibody anti-JC/BK is an effective, fast, cheap and easy technique to diagnose reactivation of polyomaviruses BK and JC in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation.",

Beretta, V. Leoni, B. Schicchitano, A. Rovelli, M.R. Rossi University of Milano-Bicocca (Monza, I) In the last few decades, as the results of bone marrow transplantation (SCT) have improved,the number of long-term survivors has increased,at the expence of higher risk for infectious disease, due to ablative chemiotherapy and prolonged immunosuppression. Objectives and Methods: We retrospectively analysed 70 paediatric patients undergoing high-risk SCT for hematologic malignancies or metabolic diseases, to evaluate the incidence and the mortality related to infections and the different hazard ratio of the following variables: Acute Graft versus host disease (aGvHD), Engrafment, type of SCT and Total Body Irradiation (TBI). Results: From 1th January 1997 to 31th December 2004, 75 SCT, 50 unrelated-SCT (uSCT)a nd 20 haplo-SCT (hSCT)were analyzed from 70 patients with haematologic or metabolic diseases, age 1 to 18 years, except for a 32 years woman.The underlyng diseases were: 40% Acute Linfoblastic Leukemia, 24.2% Acute Mieloid Leukemia, 7% Chronic Mieloid Leukemia, 7% Mucopolysaccharidosis, 22.8% other diseases.TBI was performed in 50% of patients who underwent hSCT, and in 29% of patients who underwent uSCT. For prevention of GvHD, T-depletion was performed in all patients, while B-depletion was performed in 85% of hSCT and in 20% of uSCT.6/20 of patients in haplo group developed aGvHD, within 80 days after SCT, while 8/20 developed cronic GvHD. 41/55 of patients in the unrelated group developed aGvHD within 98 days after SCT, while 11/55 developed cronic GvHD. We reported 161 infectious events, 65 from hSCT, 96 from uSCT. Among the hSCT we documented 33 proved viral infections, 6 bacterial infection, 8 fungal infections, 50% probable, 50% proved,according to the EORTC criteria, and 18 other presumptive infectious events. Among the uSCT, we documented 53 proved viral infections, 15 proved bacterial infection, 8 fungal infections, 75% proved, 25% probable, and 20 other presumptive infectious events. At the date of follow-up (July 31st), 34 of 70 patients (48.5%) were alive; 66.6% of deaths was in hSCT group. The leading cause of death in hSCT group was an infection (9/12 deaths, 75%); in uSCT group the rate of infectious related death was lower (9/24 deaths, 37.5%). Conclusions: This retrospective study showed that hSCT and uSCT are different groups in terms of type and time of infections. The hazard ratio of the variables analysed shows that the haplo type of SCT (HR: 2.308, p=0.02) and the noTake (HR: 5.849, p=0.007) are the principale factors influencing the risk of life-threatening infections. Results: A total of 20 admissions in 18 patients were identified within the study period, which represents 8% of total patients transplanted. 6 patients had received an autologous HSCT (163 total autologous HSCT), 12 patients had received an allogeneic HSCT (66 total allogeneic HSCT) of which 11 were from HLA identical siblings and 1 was from a fully HLA matched unrelated donor. Indications for transplant included a wide spectrum of haematological disease.",

Park Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, KOR) Objectives: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is an important complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Severe HC often requires prolonged and expensive hospitalization, and occasionally may be life-threatening. The aims of study were to analyze the characteristics of HC. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 34 patients to investigate the characteristics of HC associated with HSCT, who were undergone HSCT and diagnosed HC at Samsung Medical Center, between February 1996 and June 2005. The information on patients was prospectively collected by the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) database. These patients enrolled in the study had had genitourinary complications such as dysuria or gross hematuria and so on. Results: Among 406 patients who received the allogeneic or autologous HSCT, 34 patients developed moderate to severe HC, an incidence of 8.4 % (95% CI. 5.7 -11.1%). The median age of 34 patients was 31 years (range 15 to 64 years). Nineteen patients received allogeneic HSCT from sibling donors. Allogeneic HSCT from unrelated donors was performed to 11 patients. One patient received the hematopoietic stem cell from umbilical cord blood and two patients did from autologous peripheral stem cell. Eleven patients (32.3 % of 34 patients) had severe HC. Two patients suffered from urinary obstruction and they needed the cystostomy or percutaneous nephrostomy. Nine patients needed the bladder irrigation because of uncontrolled bleeding. There was no HC related mortality. Median onset day after HSCT was 30 days with range from -8 days to 386 days. Late-onset HC developed after 60 days from HSCT had broken out among 26 patients (76.5% of 34 patients). Median duration of HC was 21 days with range from 5 days to 117 days. Fischers' exact test revealed that hematologic malignancy was inversely associated with the risk of severe HC (RR = 0.080; 95% CI. 0.008 -0.835). Late-onset HC had no significant differences from early-onset HC in duration of HC, dose of cytoxan and association with GVHD and CMV antigenemia. Conclusions: This study confirmed that HC frequently developed around post-HSCT 30 days. But, this study couldn'tshow any clinical differences between late-onset HC and early-onset HC.",

Dan, S. Taioli, N. Vianelli, M. Baccarani S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, I) Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are reported to have increased in recent years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): we have thus examined our series of transplants to assess the true incidence and prognostic factors.179 patients with a variety of hematological neoplasia were transplanted between 2001 and September 2005; ; median age is 40 yrs(range 18-61), 57% from sibling donors, 43% from VUD, 60% with advanced and 40% early disease, 73% myeloablative and 27% RICs regimens,source of stem cells-BM 50%, PBSC 48%,CB 2%; GvHD prophylaxis with CsA/ sMTX (48%), CsA/sMTX /ATG-Fresenius 44% (all the VUDs), other 8%. Anifungal prophylaxis consisted of Fluconazole, 400 mg/day for all patients. There were 19 patients with IFIs, including those possible (10) probable (2), proven (7); agents were Candida (1), PC (1), Aspergillus fum. 6, Aspergillus terr. 2, unknown 11.The sites affected were the lung (19), CNS , myocardium and paranasal sinuses (1 each) and kidney (2). In 11 pts the infection was diagnosed during neutropenia, in 8 later; of these, it was associated with severe GVHD in 5 cases, while 3 had no GvHD, but all were receiving high-dose steroids. Patients with IFI were compared with those who did not develop the infection: in univariate analysis no associated factor was found of those examined (age, advanced disease, acute leukemiavs other, source of stem cell,IFI pre HSCT, myeloablative vs RIC, family donor vs VUD). Therapy consisted of one agent in 13 cases and multiagent in 6 (5 sequential, 1 combined), with a median duration of 30 days (RANGE 3-120); drugs were lyposomal amphotericin-B (7), caspofungin (7),voriconazole(4), fluconazole (1, candida) . Therapy results could be assessed in 11 patients ( the others died too early): no response (1), improvement (4, who then died of rejection-1 pt-, relapse-2 pts-other -1-), resolution 6 (2 dead of relapse, 1 other, 3 alive and well).If analyzed according to the probability of diagnosis, the results were: in the 7 with proven disease five died of IFI and two of leukemia relapse; in the 2 with probable disease 1 died of GvHD and 1 of relapse; in the 10 with possible disease 7 died of TRM and 3 are are alive and well. We conclude that the incidence has been low, that no associated factors were found. In particular no differences were found between sibling and VUD transplants, who differ only for GVHD prophylaxis (CSA+mtx for siblings and CSA+mtx+F-ATG-15-30 mg/kg-for VUDs). Introduction: Intravascular catheters (CVC) are commonly used for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CVC related infections (CRI), including bloodstream infections (BSI) or localized catheter colonizations (LCC) result in the frequent loss of catheters and in increased morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic lock (ABL) is recommended for treatment of uncomplicated CRI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a short course (3 days) ABL for the treatment of CRI in patients undergoing HSCT. Methods: 20 consecutive ABL were given to 14 patients, for a total of 19 CRI. 19 ABL were given as first line treatment and 1 as second line ABL in resistant CRI. 13 patients were receiving allogeneic HSCT and 1 patient a sequential autoallogeneic HSCT. Criteria of non eligibility were the presence of gram negative bacteria or complicated-gram positive CRI. Six cases had BSI and 13 LCC. 7 CRI were treated in a single-lumen Groshong and 12 in a double-lumen Hichmann CVC. Of the 19 CRI, S. epidermidis was the pathogen in 15, S. haemolyticus in 3 and multiple gram positive bacteria, including S. epidermidis in 1. In 16 procedures, ABL was preceded by systemic antibiotic therapy; in 4 cases, treatment consisted of ABL only. The median interval between the first positive blood-culture and ABL was 8 days (range 5-27). Treatment consisted in Teicoplanin as first line ABL and Vancomycin in case of S. haemolyticus, as second line ABL and in patients resistant to a previous systemic treatment with Teicoplanin. Results: Resolution was obtained in 14/19 CRI (74%) with first ABL; of the 5 persistent CRI, 3 were not eligible for a second line ABL, 1 was lost at follow up and 1 had a persistent CRI to a second line ABL.. No complications were seen due to ABL. Re-infection free probability of the 14 successful CRI was 50% and 30% at 100 and 180 days from ABL, respectively. CRIrelated removal probability was 30% and 40% at 100 and 180 days from ABL and 10% and 25% at 100 and 180 days from HSCT, respectively. Conclusion: In our experience, the short course ABL was safe, efficacy and at lower cost compared with those due to CVC removal or longer course ABL. The possibility to limit the period of CVC inability to few days makes this technique routinely feasible and well tolerated by all patients.",

Schwinger, H.J. Dornbusch, M. Benesch, G. Lanzer, C. Urban Medical University Graz (Graz, A) Background: Prolonged aplasia after unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) represents a major risk factor for infectious complications. Transfusion of granulocytes during the time of severe aplasia might reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. Patients and Methods: Five patients (f: 3, m: 2, median age 7 years) underwent SCT from unrelated donors. Stem cell sources were bone marrow (n= 3), peripheral stem cells (n= 1) and umbilical cord blood (n= 1). Underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n= 1), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n= 3), and Evans-syndrome (n= 1). All patients developed severe and prolonged sepsis with hypotension refractory to antibiotic and antimycotic treatment during the posttransplantation course. The median duration of leukopenia before first granulocyte transfusion (GTX) was 11 days (range 3-25). Median leukocyte level at that time was 0/\u00b5l(range 0-300), median CRP level was 53 mg/l(range 23-102; normal < 8) and median PCT level was 0.48 ng/ml (range 0.21-1.28; normal <0.1). Granulocyte donors were healthy adult volunteers (related n=1, unrelated n=4) after G-CSF stimulation with 10 \u00b5g/kg body weight /day. Results: Each patient received a median number of 11 (range 4-12) granulocyte transfusions from multiple donors (median 2, range 1-3). The median number of granulocytes in each GTX was 192 x 109 WBC/l (range 58 x 109 -384 x 109) equivalent to a median of 1.8 x 109/kg recipient (range 0.1 x 109 -8.0 x 109). Leukocyte levels in the recipients increased from a base line of 0/\u00b5l (range 0-300) to a median of 1300/\u00b5l (range 100-6200). All patients developed normalisation of CRP and PCT levels as well as normalisation of body temperature within 6 days after initiation of granulocyte transfusion. Beside a short lasting increase of body temperature GTX were tolerated very well without any severe side effects. 30 days following SCT, all patients were alive with no signs of infection. Median long term follow up is 17 months (range 12-33), 4 patients are alive and free of disease, 1 patient died of multiorgan failure due to a relapse of ALL after 13 months. Conclusion: Transfusion of granulocytes might be beneficial to get through prolonged aplasia in patients with severe sepsis after stem cell transplantation.",

Objetc: To analized the epidemiology in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, its clinical characteristics and pronostic of CMV disease. Design and methods: prospective study made in RESITRA (spanish research network including 16 trasplant centers and 3 reference laboratories) including patients who received AHSCT from june 2003 to october 2005 and developed CMV disease. Results: 460 AHSCT were realizated and 125 (27%) of them developed active CMV infection, (positive CMV antigenemia, PCR or blood culture). Median age was 42\"b16 years, 70(56%) were men and 55(45%) women. The median of the onset day of active CMV infection was 23\"b23 days after AHSCT. Asintomatic viremy were developed in 85 (68%) episodes and there were 40 (32%) CMV disease.

Lombardini, R. Saccardi, A.M. Vannucchi, A. Bosi AOU Careggi (Florence, I) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare but severe complication arising after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The monitoring of EBV load by quantitative EBV-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is mandatory to reveal early EBV reactivation and start a preemptive treatment. Moreover ELISPOT (Enzyme Linked Immunospot) assay, monitoring the specific anti-EBV T cell response, resulted predictive of EBV-PTLD risk. In our BMT Unit, ELISPOT assay was introduced from January 2005 to evaluate specific T-lymphocyte response in pts at high risk of EBV reactivation for an unrelated donor (UD) HSCT. 2/15 UD HSCT performed from January to October 2005 reactivated EBV within 100 days from transplantation: a 23 yrs old male and a 35 yrs old female affected by acute myeloid leukaemia. Both pts were conditioned with ifTBI and CY and received CSA, MTX and ATG (15mg/kg) for aGVHD prophylaxis. EBV DNA real time (RT) PCR was weekly measured from engraftment in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and simultaneously EBV specific T-cell response was evaluated by ELISPOT assay on peripheral mononuclear cells (200.000 cells/100\u00b5L). For EBV reactivation (DNA>1000 copies/100.000 PBMCs) rituximab (375mg/mq weekly) treatment was started in both pts and continued until negativity of EBV DNA RT-PCR. In both cases a significant reduction of EBV DNA load and simultaneously increasing activity of EBV specific T-cells response with ELISPOT were observed since the first dose of rituximab. The EBV DNA negativity was reached in one pt after a single dose of rituximab and in the other pt after the third dose. None pts developed a PTLD. These preliminary results are consistent with those previously reported by Smets et al (2002): a reduction of EBV DNA load associated with an increased activity of EBV specific T-cells is predictive of response to rituximab treatment and of low risk of PTLD development.",

Bittencourt, P.H. Mour\u00e3o, G.H. Martinho, C. diLorenzo Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas -UFMG (Belo Horizonte, BR) Introduction: Nosocomial infections (NI) represent a major complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) often related to imunossupression, neutropenia, use of invasive procedures, besides the possibility of microbiological crossed transmission in the hospital environment. In spite of the great importance of NI, a method for surveillance and registration data has not been established yet. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of NI in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients using NNIS methodology. Methods: This was a retrospective study, conducted at the University teaching hospital from 2000 to 2005. Each patient submitted to BMT was followed up by an infection control professional according to NNIS method and all NI were registered for one-year period. Results: In this period of study, 269 procedures were carried out and 211 patients had 474 NI. Each patient presented a median of 2 NI and the notification median time was 19 days after the BMT. The most frequent NI was bloodstream infection (BSI) (278;58,6%), followed by otorrhinolaryngologic topography (56;11,8%) and inferior respiratory tract infection (49;10,3%). A hundred and forty two BSI were diagnosed based on clinical criteria (51,1%) and 136 (48,9%) were confirmed by laboratory methods with microbiological isolation. The most common microorganism was coagulasenegative staphylococci (37,3%) followed by Enterobacter spp (10,6%), Klebsiella spp (9,8%), Acinetobacter spp. (8,4%), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group viridans (7.0% each). From 278 patients with BSI, 79 had invasive procedure and 97,4% used intravascular device. The majority of NI (64,8%) occurred in the first thirty days after BMT, mainly ( 51,4%) in the first two weeks. Conclusion: The most frequent NI in BMT recipients were BSI, associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci. NISS methodology allowed NI notification and may make temporal comparison and comparison between different institutions possible. However, modifications that consider the specific risk factors may be necessary to adequate this methodology for epidemiological studies in TMO recipients. . 20 autologous (auto) transplants for high risk solid tumors or lymphoma and 36 T-replete allogeneic HSCT (related: 15, unrelated: 21) for acute leukemia (n=26) or congenital disorders (n=10) were performed. All pts received high dose prophylactic aciclovir and preemptive ganciclovir (GCV) when VL rose above 500 K/\u00b5g (EBV or HHV6) or >1 K/\u00b5g (CMV) for 2 consecutive times. There were 13/20 viral reactivations (VR) in autoHSCT (5CMV, 3EBV, 3HHV6) and 29/36 VR in allogeneic (allo) transplants. While VR-frequency is comparable in the auto and alloHSCT cohorts, in allo pts incidence of viral disease (VD) was significantly higher with only 1 VD in autoHSCT (p<0.05). In alloHSCT with rec. and/or don. CMV-seropositivity, VR was observed in 9/27 cases while there was only 1/9 VR in the seronegative setting. 4/9 pts with CMV-VR had readily treated viral disease (2 pneumonia, 2 hepatitis). In the group with rec. and/or don. EBV-seropositivity, 11/27 pts showed VR with 4 pts developing well-controlled disease (2 gastritis/oesophagitis, 2 pneumonia). Only in 2 pts HHV6-VR was increased with 1 pneumonia. Pts transplanted for immunodeficiency had a higher risk for developing VD (4/6: 67%, p=0.001). In the alloHSCT cohort with a high degree of HLA-match (18pts 10/10; 5pts 6/6; 4pts 8/10; 1pt 7/10) there was no increase in VR frequency due to HLA-disparity. With a regimen of tight VL monitoring and preemptive GCV accompanying standard immunosupression there was no GvHD IV in our cohort. Also no correlation between VR or VD and GvHD II-III nor chronic GvHD could be observed. There was no death consecutive to VR or VD including adeno-and BK-virus. Lymphocyte engraftment (0-2 yrs >2500/\u00b5l, 2-5 yrs >1500/\u00b5l, >5 yrs >1000/\u00b5l) was prompt in this T replete predominately PBSCT (29/36) group with 16 pts (47%) engrafted at 3 months and 23 pts (70%) at 6 months post HSCT with no difference in VR in pts with early lymphocyte engraftment vs those reconstituting later. Thus in T replete alloHSCT pts, with tight monitoring of VR typical complications of herpesviral disease can be avoided including triggering of severe GvHD reactivation. In auto HSCT, viral monitoring results in negligible VD.",

During repetitive CMV reactivations, he reconstituted early after SCT with high NK cell numbers that were reactive with CMVinfected fibroblasts at a frequency of 2 \u2030. HLA-class I blocking by w6/32 did not reduce specific spot production in the NK cell fractions whereby an IFN-g production by contaminating T cells was excluded. CMV-pp65 specific T cells were first observed on day +127 after SCT. Ex vivo visualization of CMV-directed NK reactivity was also independent of the addition of cytokines or cytoglobulin, indicating pre-activated NK cells whose anti-CMV responsiveness appeared not to be mediated by antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the CMV-reactive NK cells were present until day + 110, and disappeared as soon as CMV-specific T cells were detectable. We were able to reproduce these results using different fibroblast lines, thereby excluding any relation to a certain HLA-type or KIR status. Eight healthy donors (4 CMV positive and 4 CMV negative) were analyzed for NK reactivity against infected cells, and we found a CMV-directed NK reactivity in 3 CMV negative donors. This reactivity was not blocked by w6/32. In contrast, the CMV-reactivity in one of the CMV positive donors was blocked, indicating contaminating T cells rather than NK cell reactivity. We also analyzed a second CMV patient, undergoing the same transplantation protocol for Non-Hodgkins lymphoma as our first patient. This patient and his HLA-matched unrelated donor were CMV sero-negative and a fibroblast culture was obtained from a skin biopsy of this patient. These fibroblasts were CMV-infected and NK cells of the patient obtained 30 and 170 days post transplant were reactive to CMV-infected autologous fibroblasts. This reactivity could again not be blocked by w6/32. In both patients, the highest frequency of CMV-reactive NK cells was observed early after transplantation. Our data indicate that CMV-directed NK cell reactivity may occur predominantly in the absence of a specific T cell response. In addition, the strongest CMV-directed NK cell reactivity occurred very early after SCT. Whether it is due to a direct interaction of T cells and NK cells, or whether it is related to a change in the NK activation status after the induction of antiviral T cell responses, remains to be analyzed.",

El-Cheikh, C. Faucher, S. Furst, H. de Lavallade, D. Blaise, M. Mohty Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, F) Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are increasingly used for allo-SCT in elderly or patients not eligible for standard myeloablative allo-SCT. Such regimens have yielded promising results in terms of decreasing early transplant-related toxicities. However, acute GVHD remains a matter of concern in this setting. Of note, the use of high dose corticosteroids (CS) for GVHD treatment increases the risk of severe fungal infections in this high risk population usually presenting several comorbidities. Therefore, prophylactic strategies aiming to reduce this risk are needed. We conducted a pilot single centre study in 15 adult patients receiving high dose CS (2 mg/Kg/day) for acute GVHD therapy after RIC allo-SCT. Treatment consisted of a 2 hour weekly infusion of 7.5 mg/kg Liposomal Amphotericin B (LAB) with a maximum of 8 total doses. The primary endpoint was the incidence of serious adverse events occurring during the course of prophylaxis treatment. Of note, safety was monitored with particular attention to nephrotoxicity in this relatively elderly population receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs such as cyclosporin A. Median age of these 15 patients with various hematological and non-hematological malignancies was 54 years (range, 40-70) . Patients received a median of 4 weekly doses of LAB (range, 1-8), with 8 patients (53%) receiving at least 4 consecutive weekly doses. In terms of toxicity, 6 patients (40%) didn't experience any sign of toxicity. One patient experienced a violent chest pain with transient extra-systoles, during the first infusion of LAB, and did not receive any subsequent infusions. Other mild and transient infusionrelated reactions (fever, flush, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, pruritous, bone pain, abdominal pain) were observed in 5 patients, usually at time of first LAB infusion. Despite concomitant administration of cyclosporin A in all 15 patients, only 4 patients (27%) had to interrupt the course of prophylactic LAB (respectively after 3 (n=2), 4 and 7 infusions) because of renal toxicity (increase of serum creatinine over 1.5 times from baseline values). Although long term efficacy of such antifungal prophylactic strategy is yet to be established, the results of this feasibility study demonstrate that a weekly dose of 7.5 mg/Kg of LAB is relatively safe and well tolerated when given as prophylaxis in high-risk immuno-compromised patients receiving high dose CS for GVHD after RIC allo-SCT, despite concomitant administration of multiple nephrotoxic drugs.",

Recent efforts have been directed at prevention, early diagnosis and treatment HCMV disease following transplantation. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) are harbors of virus during active phase and when HCMV disease is developed. Therefore, the introduction of the HCMV antigenemia assay, which allows direct detection and quantification of HCMV, infected peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLS) has been of great benefit to patient\u00a1\u00a6s management. Objectives: Based on detection of pp65, the immediate early antigen of HCMV, this study was designed in order to rapid quantitative diagnosis and monitoring of HCMV active infection for initiation and managements of anti-HCMV peremptive treatment. Materials and Methods: A total of 354 samples include peripheral blood mononuclear cells,MNLs (n=177) ,and PMNLs (n=177) were collected from 26 allogenic related recipients at Namazi Hospital , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. Samples were collected at 7-10 days before transplantation and then weekly from day 14 to 120 after transplantation .Clinical data were collected and analyzed prospectively by physicians .HCMV antigenemia assay were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction for the presence of pp65 antigen. Results: Based on clinical status of the HCMV infected patients new classification for quantification of HCMV infected cells was developed .In asymptomatic patients total infected cell was found to<10/ 2 x 10 5 PBLS. In mild symptomatic and in HCMV disease the PMLS level of antigenemia was calculate to be 10-100 and >100 pp65 infected PMNLS / 2 x 10 5 PBL s respectively. Statistical analysis proved the correlations between clinical conditions of the patients and number of infected cells. (r =0.818). Conclusion: Quantitative antigenemia assay would be a good marker for predication of clinical and management of antiviral drug in case of HCMV infection in BMT recipients.",

Ibrahim, A. Mugharbil, N. Droubi, G. Nsouli, R. Jalloul, N. Yassin, T. Jisir, R. Mughnieh Makassed Hospital (Beirut,LBN) Fungal infections especially due to Aspergillus and Candida are a major cause of treatment related mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Although amphotericin B has been a mainstay of therapy for systemic fungal infections, it has many adverse effects, including fever, chills, nausea and vomiting, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic acidosis, and most importantly, acute renal failure which induces significant morbidity and mortality. Liposomal amphotericin B used in allogeneic BMT is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity. Seven patients (pts) who underwent allogeneic BMT and were at high risk for invasive or systemic fungal infections (previous history of systemic or invasive aspergillosis and or advanced disease), received empirical treatment with caspofungin. Median age was 36 years old (16-52). There were 2 females and 5 males. Allogeneic BMT (with a standard myeloablative regimens) was performed for AML in relapse in 2 pts, ALL in relapse in 2 pts, CML in one patient (pt), aplastic anemia (AA) in one pt and thalassemia major (Thal) in one pt.

The median duration of therapy with caspofungin was 22 d (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . No other systemic antifungal was given. Caspofungin was well tolerated with no significant side effects. No pt developed fungal infections. One pt allografted for ALL died of acute GVHD on d 39 after allogeneic BMT. The 4 other pts allografted for leukemia are alive in complete remission at 2,5,9 and 21 months (m). The pt allografted for AA is alive and well at 22 m. The pt allografted for Thal is alive and transfusion independent at 6 m. Conclusion: Empirical use of caspofungin is safe and very effective in pts undergoing allogeneic BMT and at high risk of invasive or systemic fungal infections.",

De Vita, L. De Padua, F. Sor\u00e0, N. Piccirillo, S. Sica, G. Leone Universit\u00e0 Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore (Rome, I) Valgancyclovir is a valyl ester of ganciclovir which is hydrolyzed to ganciclovir before reaching the systemic circulation, having higher bioavailability than oral ganciclovir. Despite the efficacy of valganciclovir has been demonstrated in immunosuppressed patients (CMV retinitis in AIDS patients, solid organ transplant recipients, patients treated with alemtuzumab), no data exist for the established dose and the indication of this formulation as CMV pre-emptive therapy in stem cell transplantation (SCT). Starting from July 2004, valganciclovir at a dose of 900 mg os once a day, was administered in 8 out-patients submitted to allogeneic SCT as pre-emptive therapy on the basis of detection of primary or reactivated CMV infection by positive antigenemia (Ag), or positive PCR. The median age was 43 years (range 21-54 years). They were affected by acute myeloid leukemia (4), aplastic anemia (1), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2) and low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1) . Six patients obtained complete remission after transplant. Acute GVHD occurred in 7 patients and chronic GVHD was noticed in 3 patients. Immunosuppressive regimen consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate for all patients with addiction of steroids and mycophenolate or tacrolimus based on the development of acute or chronic GVHD. Antigenemia and PCR DNA for CMV were monitored twice a week. The median time of positivization of Ag and/or PCR for CMV was 45 days after transplant (range 35-63). Among evaluable patients, the mean baseline antigenemia level was 2/200.000 cells (range 1/200.000-5/200.000), whereas the mean level of Dna viral copies was 6 x10\u00b3/ml (range 0.320 x10\u00b3-24x10\u00b3). The negativization of PCR and/or Ag for CMV occurred in 6/8 patients (75%) at a median of 2 weeks from starting valganciclovir (range 2-3 weeks). One patient required further CMV treatment for a 2nd re-activation, at 252nd day, but obtained a rapid negativization after 1 week of therapy. Two patients, not achieving negativization, were shifted to foscarnet but developed CMV pulmonary disease and died at 189 days and 431 days. The cause of death was not attributable to CMV because they also developed recurrence of their malignancy. No significant increased myelo or nephrotoxicity was observed. Oral Valganciclovir was well tolerated showing efficacy and safety without significant hematological and/or extrahematological toxicity; moreover it allowed good compliance and outpatient management.",

Altuntas, O. Yildiz, N. Koc, H. Mavus Buldu, I. Kocyigit, B. Eser, A. Unal Erciyes University (Kayseri,TR) Background: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are the most serious infectious complications in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Candida sp. And angioinvasive moulds (mainly Aspergillus) are the pathogens involved in the majority of cases. Despite recent advances in prophylaxis and therapy, the mortality of IFI remains extremely high, both in the pre-engraftment phase and in the post-engraftment period, especially when chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is present. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the incidence and outcome of IFI in 78 consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT, both myeloablative (49 patients, 63%) and non-myeloablative (29 patients, 37%), over a six years period (April 1999-September 2005) at our center. All the patients received antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole. For the definition of IFI (proven, probable or possible), the EORTC guidelines were used. Results: We documented 12 IFI, with a total incidence of 15%. The incidence was the same in the myeloablative (4/29, 13%) and non-myeloablative (8/49, 16%) setting. The IFI was proven in 8/12 cases (67%), probable in 3 (25%) and possible in one (8%). The majority of IFI developed in patients had an (67%) acute and chronic GVHD. Both in the myeloablative and non-myeloablative transplant, the higher percentage of cases (8 cases, 75%) occurred in late post-engraftment period (>100 days). The most common agents of IFI were Aspergillus sp. (75%) and Candida sp. (25%). The lung was the most common localization (100%) while a multi-organ involvement was present in 2 cases (17%). Only in 2/12 cases the IFI was cured, while 10 patients died because of infection, with an overall survival at 30 and 100 days of 17% and 33%. Conclusion: Our results suggest that IFI remains an important complication after allogeneic transplantation, regardless of the type of conditioning regimen.",

Gonzalez-Mesones, M. Puente, J. Baro, E. Conde, A. Iriondo Marques de Valdecilla (Santander, E) Introduction: Oral Valganciclovir is effective for preemptive anti-CMV therapy in solid organ transplant recipients. In allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) it has not been studied much. Aim: Analyze the effectiveness of Oral Valganciclovir (900mg /12 hr) as an anti-CMV therapy in HSCT. Design: A prospective pilot study performed in our hospital between the dates of August 2004 to November 2005.CMV infection was detected by antigenemia. Outpatient follow-ups were performed twice a week with analytical and antigenemia tests. Treatment lasted 2 or 3 weeks, depending on the fast negativization or not of the antigenemia. If needed, a dose adjustment was made due to kidney insufficiency. Materials and methods: 10 patients with CMV infection post-HSCT were studied. Median age was 40 years old: 5 males and 5 women. In 5 patients mieloablative conditioning was used (3 BUCY, 2 Cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy) and in 5 non-mieloablative (4 Fludarabina-Melfalan and 1 Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide). Prophylaxis for graftversus-host disease (GVHD) was performed in 4 patients with Cyclosporine (CSA) and Metotrexate, in 6 cases with CSA and Mycophenolate +/-ATG. Eight developed light to moderate acute GVHD and 4 chronic GVHD. Median days between transplantation and CMV infection was 58. Six patients developed CMV infection before day 100. Four presented late CMV infection during chronic GVHD. Median cells in antigenemia was 6 /10 5 leucocytes (2-100). Results: No patient developed CMV disease or died during treatment. In 9 patients the antigenemia negativized before day +9 of treatment and received two weeks of treatment. Only 1 needed 3 weeks of treatment due to positive antigenemia in day +14. 2/10 patients had late reappearance of positive antigenemia. Nine completed the therapy. One developed severe pancytopenia that required us to stop the therapy. Two patients developed moderate haematological toxicity that was resolved by G-CSF and /or blood transfusion. Conclusions: 1. Oral Valganciclovir seems to be an effective preemptive therapy for CMV infection in HSCT. 2. The haematological toxicity was acceptable and the treatment improved the patient's quality of life, allowing them outpatient treatment. 3. More research is needed to confirm these results. Z.

Georgievski Clinical Center (Skopje, MK) Introduction: the aim of this studie is to evaluate type,severity and frequency of infective complications during the aplastic phase after stem cell transplantation in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), conditioned with Bu-Cy regimen. Material and Methods: during a five years period (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) we have treated 48 AML patients with PBSCT. Preparative regimen Bu-Cy was used in 23 patients (15 allogeneic and 8 autologous), while 25 patients were treated with other chemotherapeutic regimen (Flag/Ida,BEAM) Median age 34 years. Male:11 Female:12. Patients were treated in sterile room, conditioned with HEPA filters,and antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen consisted quinolon (ciprofloxacin 500mg/12h), antimycotic (fluconazole 200mg/12h.or itraconazole 200mg./12h), virostatic (acyclovir 200mg/6h). Results: in the group of allogeneic recipients 8/15 patients (53,3%) developed fever,mucositis 8/15 (53,3%), pneumonia 2/15 (13,3%), acute B-hepatitis 1 (6,6%), thrombophlebitis 2/15 (13,3%), cvc assotiated infection 3/15 (20%). The most frequent isolated microorganisms were Gram-positive cocci (80%), Gram negative bacteria (20%), Candida albicans (6%), Non-Albicans Candida (4%). One patient dye in septic shock caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the group of autologous recipients fevbrile episode were noted in 4/8 (50%) patients, mucositis (50%), pneumonia 1/8(12,5%), perianal abscess 1(12,5%).The most common isolated were Grampositive cocci (75%), Gram-negative bacilli (15%), Non Albicans Candida (5%), Candida albicans (5%). The infective complication was fatal in one patient due to septic shock caused by Streptomonas maltophilla. Conclusion: confirmong other study data we detected no significant differences between AML patients treated with autologous or allogeneic PBSCT (preparative regimen Bu-Cy) with respect to infective complications.",

Pivkova, L. Cevreska, N. Siljanovski, O. Karanfilski, S. Genadieva Stavrik, I. Panovska, B. Georgievski Clinical Center (Skopje, MK) Infections still present major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing highdose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. We present our five year results of infectious complications in 97 patients with hematological malignancies that underwent stem cell transplantation in a period from September 2000 till September 2005 at Department of hematology, Skopje. 67 patients were treated with autologous transplantation (10 MM, 12 NHL, 13 HD, 29 AML, 3 ALL) and 30 with allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA identical siblings (19AML, 6 CML, 1 AA, 1CLL, 1 NHL, 2 ALL). Median age at transplant was 34 years (20-64), and bone marrow as a source of stem cells in 29 patients opposite to peripheral blood stem cells as a source in 68 transplant procedures. We retrospectively analyzed the infective complications that occurred during an aplastic phase after stem cell transplantation. All patients were treated in sterile room, conditioned with HEPA filters. Median duration of neutropenia ( granulocyte count < 0,5 x 109/L) was 10 days. Growth factor, was administered to all patients until neutrophil engraftment. All patients received oral antimicrobial prophylaxis consisting of ciprofloxacin, trimetoprimsulfamethoxazole, acyclovir and fluconazole or fluconazole plus itraconazole. Results: The overall incidence of fever requiring antimicrobial treatment was 53%. 11% of patients have fever of unknown origin (FUO), whereas primary bacteriemia occurred in 32%, pneumonia in 11%, severe skin infection in 4,7%, neutropenic enterocolitis in 11%, acute viral B-hepatitis in 2 patients. Infecton was fatal in 2 (2,5%) patients, due to septic shock, caused by Gram negative bacteria (Streptomonas maltophilla and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The most frequently isolated were Gram-pozitive cocci from central venous line and sputum. Non-Albicans Candida were predominantly isolated fungi (Non-Albicans Candida vs Candida Albicans = 60% : 40%). First-line therapy consisting third generation cephalosporine plus amycacin was succesful in 66% of patients. Conclusions: Since we registered higher percent of isolated gram positive cocci from central venous lines and lower respiratory tract, which was the result of gram negative prophylaxis, we suggest future possible need of using prophilactic agents against gram positive bacteria as standard prophylactic regimen.",

Gharebaghian, K. Alimoghaddam, M. Dehghan, A. Ghavamzadeh, A.R. Shamshiri Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of infection in bone marrow transplantation recipients. It is monitored by measuring pp65 antigenemia and Real-Time PCR(RT-PCR) and compared results of these methods on serial samples collected from recipients. We could detect CMV DNA in this patients by RT-PCR For monitoring of CMV reaction. If copy number of CMV was increased, preemptive therapy will be start.51 recipients of BMT (9-51 years) were monitored as weekly intervals until day 100 after transplantation. For amplification of the pp65 gene (UL83) RT-PCR assay and pp65 Antigenemia method were preformed in parallel with 415 samples. By cloning of this region, we made standards for RT-PCR. The results obtained by the two techniques were significantly correlated (p<0.01). We could detected 10 copies of CMV DNA / capillary. Detection limits of this method were 13\u00d7101-15\u00d7107copies/2\u00d7105cells by RT-PCR.76% of patients developed more than one episode of CMV replication. First positive result of RT-PCR 13 days earlier than first positive of pp65 Antigenemia. After preemptive therapy 16 days (7-21 days) needed to become negative result of RT-PCR. There was no relationship between death and increase of CMV copy(p<0.419).RT-PCR was more sensitive than pp65 Antigenemia. After preemptive therapy, negative results of RT-PCR were the best indicator for determining of successful treatment. Reaction of CMV in our patients mostly endogenous and depend on kind of immunosuppressive therapy. If copy number of CMV increased one log, CMV reaction developed 1.22 fold. Antiviral compounds including ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir are routinely used in the treatment of CMV infection and disease, however, these agents have a poor oral bioavailability and have the inconvenience and expense of iv administration. Aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral valganciclovir (VGCV) for preemptive treatment of CMV reactivation in a cohort of 15 allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. Patients and methods: We treated 15 patients with hematological malignancies (n=14) or solid tumors (n=1) who received allogeneic HSCT from related (n=9) or unrelated (n=6) donors. In all patients, either the donor, host or both were CMV IgG positive pretransplant. Indication for therapy was preemptive treatment of CMV infection defined as one or two consecutive positive tests of pp65 antigenemia assay or CMV-PCR. VGCV was administered orally in a dosage of 900 mg BID for 2 weeks followed by 450 mg BID for 2 additional weeks. Twelve patients received VGCV as 1st line preemptive therapy, while 3 patients received previous antiviral therapy. Results: Patients developed a positive CMV-PCR after a median of 52 days (range 37-427) post-HSCT and a positive pp65 antigenemia after a median time of 74 days (range 37-427) post-HSCT. Preemptive treatment with VGCV was started a median time of 56 days (range 37-429) after transplant. In all, 11 patients (73%) completed the 28 days of therapy with VGCV, 4 patients discontinued the drug because of toxicity. All patients showed a complete clearance of the virus (pp65 negative, quantitative CMV-PCR negative). The median time to achieve a negative CMV-PCR was 6 days (range 4-18). A relapse of CMV infection after VGCV preemptive therapy occurred in 6 patients (40%) a median of 15 days (range 7-101) after the completion of the treatment. No patient developed early or late CMV disease. Six patients (40%) presented hematological toxicity including neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia which required drug discontinuation in 4 cases. Two patients complained of nausea and vomiting and 1 patient experienced reversible renal toxicity. Conclusion: Our preliminary results although restricted to a small cohort of patients, suggest that VGCV can be safely and effectively used in preemptive treatment of CMV infection in an outpatient setting. VGCV provides a cost-effective and efficacious alternative to induction-maintenance regimens of iv antiviral drugs P733 Viral infections following reduced-intensity conditioning with graft failure in 4/10 patients P. Sovinz, W. Schwinger, H. Lackner, H.J. Dornbusch, M. Benesch, G. Lanzer, C. Urban Medical University Graz (Graz, A) Objectives: Infections -mainly of viral origin -remain a significant cause of non-relapse morbidity and mortality following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). In a series of 10 pediatric and adolescent patients (pts) undergoing RIC and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at our institution between 2001 and 2005, viral infections were detected in 9 pts. 4 of them experienced graft failure despite complete donor chimerism necessitating stem cell boosts. Patients and Methods: 9/10 pts undergoing RIC showed replication of 2 to 5 different viruses detected by routine PCR monitoring. 4 pts (whose characteristics are shown in the table) experienced graft failure between days + 45 and +263. Viral DNA was detected by PCR in bone marrow (BM) in pts 1 and 2 (HHV6, Parvo B19) and in blood and stools in pts 3 and 4 (Adenovirus). Patient 1 received antiviral treatment with foscarnet, pts 3 and 4 with ribavirin. Results: All 4 pts achieved engraftment after stem cell boosting, immunoglobulin substitution and antiviral treatment. Patient 1 died on day + 400 due to chronic GVHD and sepsis; the other 3 pts survive for 205, 170 and 50 days and have cleared the respective virus or are asymptomatic carriers. Of the 6 remaining pts, one died due to tumor progression, 5 are alive after a median of 280 days. Conclusions: Viral infections may contribute to significant complications for patients receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning containing fludarabine and alemtuzumab or ATG. We report on 4 patients who experienced graft failure due to coincident viral infections despite complete donor chimerism and were successfully managed by stem cell boosts. Objectives: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection remains a major and potential life threatening complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Since DCs are essential for T-cell activation leading to a specific T-cell response for viral clearance, we prepared a HCMV vaccine based on ex vivo generated and matured DC loaded with HCMV peptides. This vaccine will overcome the impaired DC function among HCMV infected allogeneic stem cell recipients. The primary and secondary objective was safety and efficacy of the DC vaccine respectively. Methods: Mature DCs were generated under GMP conditions and pulsed with peptides from the HCMV proteins pp65 and pp150, restricted by the HLA-class I elements A1, A2, A3, A11, A68 and B7. After performing sterility controls, 1 x 105 -5 x 106 DCs/m\u00b2 were administered subcutaneously near the inguinal lymph nodes. 24 SCT recipients were recruited in our study; 6 at high risk for HCMV disease received prophylactic vaccination whereas 18 received therapeutic vaccination after their infection failed to respond to conventional antiviral chemotherapy. As efficacy parameter long term control of HCMV infection was analysed instead of viral load since all patients with HCMV infection received antiviral chemotherapy at the time of vaccination. Results: No local or systemic acute side effects occurred after vaccination. An observation period of 3 months was defined to evaluate long term side effects and control of HCMV infection. 17 patients were completely evaluable (5 prophylactic and 12 therapeutic). Only one patient developed grade III Graft-Versus-Host-Disease of the skin. Due to a time lag of 3 months between vaccination and event, a causative relationship seems to be unlikely. Four of five patients receiving prophylactic vaccination never have HCMV reactivation. The other 10 patients cleared HCMV infection after a mean of 50 days post vaccination. Over all, 15 patients controlled their HCMV infection. 10 of them demonstrated a specific T-cell response against the vaccine peptides after a mean of 23 days post vaccination. Only two of these 10 patients have further HCMV reactivation due to high dose steroid therapy. Conclusion: Our results indicate that peptide loaded mature dendritic cells (DCs) can induce HCMV specific T-cell responses which may serve as a safe and feasible modality for immunotherapy in allogeneic SCT patients. No relevant side effects were observed in this first DC vaccination trial in SCT patients.",

Current anti-viral agents are not wholly effective and it is also evident that elimination of adenovirus (ADV) is only achieved by recovery of the T cell immune response. Using an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion and capture assay to isolate ADV specific T cells, followed by a two week expansion and restimulation protocol, we have generated ADV T cell lines that may be used for cellular immunotherapy. In contrast to virus specific T cells for CMV or EBV, the ADV T cell lines consist predominantly of CD4+ cells which display an effector/memory immunophenotype. Restimulation of T cells with ADV and control antigens demonstrated highly specific ADV activity both by intracellular IFN-gamma expression and cytotoxicity assays. Although the T cell lines were initially generated in response to ADV species C, the resultant T cell lines also showed equivalent activity against species B virus suggesting cross-reactivity across ADV species; a finding that has important clinical consequences. Separation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells showed that adenoviral cytotoxic activity was equivalent in both T cell populations. In mixed lymphocyte reactions, ADV specific T cell lines showed significantly decreased alloreactive potential in comparison to fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same donor. This protocol can be readily translated to generate clinical grade ADV specific T cells and as such, may offer an effective immunotherapeutic strategy to control ADV infection.",

Abu-Khader, M. Grube, S. Krause, E. Holler University Hospital Regensburg (Regensburg, D) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease remains a significant cause of morbidity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The purpose of this study was to use a novel molecular detection system to establish a rapid and precise method to identify CMV-specific T lymphocytes after allogeneic SCT. Two CMV antigens were used to activate CMV-specific T lymphocytes, namely pp65 HLA-A2-restricted peptide (495-503) and pp65 recombinant protein. After ex vivo stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 patients with CMV seropositive donors, between 40 days and 54 months after allogeneic SCT, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate CMV responses by measuring interferon-gamma (IFN-g) mRNA transcripts in 31 samples. This was compared in parallel with HLA-A2 restricted CMV-tetramer, IFN-g-ELISPOT and intracellular (IC) IFN-g accumulation. Both CMV antigens induced significant quantities of IFN-g mRNA production after 3 hours in the qRT-PCR protocol. Among the 24 samples of the HLA-A2+ patients, tetramer detected 62% (13/21) of CMVspecific T cells compared to 39% (9/23) with IC IFN-g assay and 68% (15/22) with qRT-PCR when pp65-peptide was used as antigen. In the 7 HLA-A2-patient's samples all the tested methods did not detect any CMV reactive T cells in response to the pp65-peptide. On the other hand, among all of the HLA-A2+ patients CMV reactivity was found in 79% (15/19) with IC IFN-g assay compared to 84% (16/19) with qRT-PCR when pp65-protein was the stimulus. This was similar to the HLA-S190 A2-patient's results who shown 50% (3/6) reactivity with IC IFN-g compared to 100% (6/6) with qRT-PCR when stimulated with pp65-protein. Stronger correlation was found between IC flow cytometry and qRT-PCR methods, when CMV pp65-protein (r = 0.96) was used in comparison to CMV pp65-peptide (r = 0.51). As a result, the measurement of IFNg mRNA by qRT-PCR can be used to detect CTL responses 3 hours after CMV peptide or protein stimulation of PBMCs. In conclusion, qRT-PCR allows rapid monitoring of CMV-reactive CTLs reconstitution after allogeneic SCT using patient's PBMCs.",

Arbach (1) Introduction: Adenovirus (AdV) infection is a severe complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, particularly in paediatric patients. Control of AdV infection seems to be dependent on CD4+ T-cells but the main antigenic targets for AdV-specific CD4+ T-cells have remained unknown so far. In order to design protocols for targeted adoptive immunotherapy the identification of the main AdV antigenic targets would be a fundamental prerequisite. Methods: We here use a novel technique to directly assess the entire repertoire of CD4+ T-cells specific for a defined antigen according to antigen-induced CD154 expression after short-term ex vivo stimulation. AdV-lysate-specific and AdVhexon-specific CD4+ T-cells were isolated, expanded in vitro and further assessed for their fine specificities using recombinant AdV-proteins and AdV-lysates from various AdVserogroups. Additionally, we evaluated the cytokine profile of AdV-lysate-and AdV-hexon-specific CD4+ T-cells. Results: AdV-lysate-specific CD4+ T-cells reacted efficiently with AdV-hexon and penton proteins. Furthermore, CD4+ Tcells specific for hexon protein derived from AdV-serogroup B crossreact with recombinant hexon protein derived from various other AdV-serotypes and are characterized by a Th1like cytokine profile. Conclusion: Our results prove the effectiveness of antigeninduced CD154-expression for assessment of the entire repertoire of CD4+ T-cells specific for pathogens, for the identification of immunodominant antigenic targets. We demonstrate that adenovirus hexon protein is a suitable candidate antigen for the ex vivo generation of adenovirusspecific, serogroup cross-reactive CD4+ T-cells with a Th1like cytokine profile for adoptive T-cell therapies.",

Shimoni, I. Hardan, N. Shem-Tov, R. Yerushalmi, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel-Hashomer, IL) Relapse of acute leukemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) carries poor outcome. Reducedintensity conditioning (RIC) is increasingly used as means to reduce toxicity after SCT, however it is still not established whether the outcome of patients (pts) relapsing after RIC is different than of those relapsing after standard SCT and whether treatment should differ .We compared outcome after relapse among 131 patients with AML/ MDS given SCT following myeloablative conditioning consisting of intravenous busulfan (ivBu) and cyclophosphamide (BuCy, n=48), and following RIC consisting of fludarabine and ivBu (n=84). With a median follow-up of 19 months , 47 pts relapsed, with a cumulative incidence of 41%, 32% after BuCy and 46% after RIC (p=NS). Relapse occurred in a median of 4.8 and 2.1 months, respectively (p=0.04). Treatment consisted of rapid withdrawal of immune-suppressive therapy (all pts), DLI alone or following low-dose chemotherapy (n=9), or intensive chemotherapy (most often FLAG-ida) followed by a second SCT (n=16). Twelve pts (26%) achieved CR, 8 following second SCT (CR rate 50%) and 4 following less intensive treatments (CR rate, 13%, p= 0.009). With median follow-up of 9 months (2-31), 6 pts remain alive; estimated 1 and 2-year overall survival from relapse (OS) of 19% and 4% respectively. Six of the 12 pts achieving CR died, 3 of relapse and 3 of acute GVHD. Pts having a short remission after SCT (< 6 months) had dismal outcome with 1 and 2-year OS of 6% and 0%, respectively, compared with 56%, and 19%, in pts with a longer remission (p=0.0001). Second SCT was associated with a better outcome than less intensive treatments with 1 and 2 year OS of 41 and 10% compared with 7 and 0%, respectively (p=0.0004). Pts relapsing following BuCy had a better outcome, 1 and 2 year OS of 39% and 13%, compared with 5 and 0% in pts relapsing after RIC (p=0.02). Multivariable analysis determined that short remission and treatments other than second SCT were associated with poor outcome with hazard ratios of 3.4 (p=0.005) and 2.2 (p=0.04), respectively. Pts with longer remission having second SCT had an estimated 2-year OS of 24%. Pts relapsing after RIC had dismal outcome, but this was mostly related to shorter initial remission. Relapse after SCT, especially when occurring after > 6 months should be treated aggressively, both in the myeloablative and in the RIC setting, to allow a reasonable chance for prolonged survival.",

            "text": "Patterns of lineage specific chimerism following reducedintensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation using Campath-1H based regimens K. Sibson (1) Establishment of full donor lympho-haematopoietic chimerism following allogeneic stem cell transplatation (alloSCT) is considered a prerequisite for sustained allogeneic engraftment and subsequent graft versus leukaemia/lymphoma reactions. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) alloSCT that incorporates CAMPATH-1H depletes both recipient and donor lymphoid cells and may result in mixed blood/marrow chimerism but the impact upon myeloid and lymphoid specific chimerism is unknown. We therefore studied myeloid and lymphoid lineage specific chimerism in 31 patients undergoing CAMPATH-1H based RIC alloSCT. All patients received conditioning with CAMPATH-1H (50-90mg) combined with fludarabine/melphalan (19), fludarabine/busulphan (3) or BEAM (9). GVHD prophylaxis was achieved with cyclosporin A. Serial whole blood (WB) and purified CD3 and CD15/45 lineages were analysed by PCR to identify donor and recipient specific STRs. Chimerism results were defined as follows:-full donor (FD) chimera \u2265 95% donor; mixed donor/recipient (D/R) <95% donor and \u2265 5% donor. Results: With a median follow up of 6 months (range 3-24) 122 peripheral blood samples were analysed. In 114/122 samples WB chimerism was concordant with CD15/45 chimerism. FD chimerism in WB, CD15/45 and CD3 fractions was present in 88, 89 and 29 of the samples respectively. In the 88 samples that were FD in WB, 60 were mixed D/R in the CD3 lineage. When studying serial chimerism status in individual patients four distinct patterns could be identified:-Pattern 1 (12 patients), mixed D/R in CD3 with stable FD in WB and CD15/45; Pattern 2 (9 patients), mixed D/R in CD3 with progression from FD chimerism to mixed D/R in WB and CD15/45; Pattern 3 (7 patients), stable FD chimerism in all lineages; Pattern 4 (2 patients), mixed D/R in all lineages. Withdrawal of cyclosporin did not alter the chimerism status. Administration of donor lymphocyte infusions to 3 patients resulted in conversion of mixed D/R chimerism to full FD chimerism in all patients. Conclusions: 1. CD3 lineage specific chimerism identifies a high incidence of mixed D/R lymphoid chimerism that is not apparent from WB chimerism analysis. 2. Mixed D/R chimerism in the CD3 lineage is associated with the subsequent development of progressive loss of donor myeloid chimerism. 3. Administration of DLIs may convert a state of mixed D/R chimerism to full donor chimerism in both the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. G.-N. Franke, S. Leiblein, J. Edelmann, R. Krahl, C. Kliem, E. Hennig, H.-K. Al-Ali, W. P\u00f6nisch, D. Niederwieser, T. Lange University of Leipzig (Leipzig, D) Objektives: In the background of the increasing numbers of SCT`s with reduced conditioning (RIC) in Europe, lineage specific chimerism (LSC)has been widely used to monitor engraftment and disease control. In contrast, LSC kinetics that predicts graft rejection (GR) and potential factors who influence the LSC has not been reported on a large and uniform cohort of patients. We report that T-cell chimerism in peripheral blood (PB)<10% is the appropriate value to predict GR. Furthermore, LSC is dependent on the underlying disease and varies between PB and bone marrow (BM). Patients and Methods: 264 patients (median age 57, range 17-74 years) underwent allogeneic SCT for AML or MDS (n=116, group A), CML or MPS (n=39, group B), NHL and multiple myeloma (n=76 group C) or other diseases (n=33, group D) using related (n=94) or unrelated (URD, n=170) donors following a TBI 2 Gy and Fludarabin (n=241) conditioning regimen. Post-grafting immunosuppression consisted of MMF and CSA in all patients. The degree of donor chimerism among T-cells, granulocytes and unselected nucleated cells in BM and PB and from CD34+ cells in BM only has been evaluated at day 14 (PB and URD only), 28, 56, and 84 in a total of 1352 samples. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the XY chromosome and PCR based analysis of polymorphic micro satellite regions has been used in sex matched or mismatched donors, respectively. Results: 19 patients (7,2%) developed GR. When using chimerism at day 28 in PB T-cells and unselected BM cells as a categorized (<10% and \u2265 10% donor)or continuous variable, T-cell chimerism <10% at day 28 predicted GR with a specificity and sensitivity of 99,6 and 87%, respectively. Using a logistic regression model, PB T-cell chimerism <10% was significantly superior to unselected BM (p<10-8) in predicting GR. Furthermore, granulocyte chimerism in PB at day 14 and 56 in group B was significantly higher at day 14 (p=0.004) and day 56 (p <0.0005, Kruskal-Wallis-test) compared to all other patients. In contrast, T-cell chimerism in PB but not in BM increased more rapidly in group C at day 28, 56 (p<0.003) and 84 (p=0.013) compared to group A, B and D together. Conclusion: T cell chimerism <10% in PB at day 28 is the best parameter to predict GR. To further improve SCT with RIC, a multivariate analysis of additional characteristics beside underlying disease is in progress to identify independent parameters who influence donor cell engraftment of different lineages.",

After Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) which reduce TRM, transplantation can be extended to older patients, those with poor performance status, organ dysfunction or intensive prior therapy. In absence of HLA-matched donor, UCB is a possible source of hematopoietic stem cells : graft vs leukemia increases with HLA disparity and GVH incidence is similar for 4-6/6 identities. The study assessed RIC regimen described by Barker et al (Blood 2003 , 102, 1915 . Primary endpoint was neutrophil recovery and chimerism. Secondary endpoints : early outcomes, early TRM, acute GVHD incidence, late outcomes, relapse, survival. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 24 patients (pts) were enrolled : median age : 48y (19-69), weight : 66 kg(45-90), gender : 14 females and 9 males, CMV serpositivity in 13 pts, ABO major incompatibility in 10 pts. The median of follow-up was 7.5 mo (2-22). Disease status was 2 ALL (CR1: 1; CR2 : 1), 14 AML (CR1 : 6, CR2 : 7, CR3 : 1), 1 MDS, 1 AP CML, 1 CLL, 1 Waldenstr\u00f6m disease, 3 follicular lymphomas relapsed after autologous transplantation. Cryopreserved and infused nucleated and CD34+ cells number was : 3.4x107/kg (2.6-5) and 1.4x105/kg (0.5-6.5) ; 2.3x107/kg (1.7-3.7) and 0.7x105/kg (0.4-1.2). HLA disparity was 0/6 in 1, 1/6 in 7 and 2/6 in 16 (10 class I and 6 class I + class II). RIC regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg D-6, fludarabine 200 mg/m\u00b2 and 2Gy TBI at D-1. GVHD prophylaxis was ciclosporine and micof\u00e9nolate from D-3. Pts received GCSF until 5 G ANC/l. Results: Median day for 0.5 G/l ANC was D+14 (0-28), for 20 G/l platelets : D+28 (0-48). One pt had autologous recovery, 3 early relapse and remaining others showed full chimerism. Mucositis was not observed. CMV reactivation in 5 pts, bacteremia in 3, SRV pneumonitis in 1 pt. In 2 pts, limbic encephalitis was diagnosed and 1 was the cause of death. Three pts recovered normal ovarian function after UCBT. Grade 2-4 acute GVHD incidence was 20% ( 3 grade 2 and 2 grade 4) and chronic GVHD in 7 out of 17 pts at risk. TRM was seen in 1 pt. Five pts relapsed. EFS was 80+/-13%. Rapid recovery after RIC and > 1.7x107 infused nucleated cells/kg. Early relapses were seen in 5 pts. Low TRM was seen in this series. The favourable results justify to analyse a larger series of pts.",

Pagliuca, A. Ho, S. Devereux, G. Mufti Kings College Hospital NHS Trust (London, UK) Venoocclusive disease (VOD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in myeloablative (MA) HSCT and incidence in reduced-intensity conditioning haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIC HSCT) is not clearly defined.We retrospectively reviewed the incidence and management of VOD following RIC HSCT at our centre. Patients and Methods: 237 RIC allografts were performed from Jan 1999 to Dec 2004.Patients were conditioned with BEAM-C*(n=37), FMC**(N=26), or FBC***(n=174).The median recipient age was 51 years (range 19-72).45 patients had previous HSCT (21 autografts, 24 allografts).10 patients had impaired baseline liver function tests (LFTs), and 8 patients had past hepatitis B infection.All patients had LFTs and body weight monitored daily until discharge and twice weekly thereafter for the first 3 months. Clinical diagnosis of S192 VOD was based on the Seattle Criteria. All suspected patients had liver imaging and comorbid events such as sepsis and hepatotoxic drug exposure were excluded wherever possible. Results: 14/237 (5.9%) patients were diagnosed with VOD.Matched unrelated donors in 6 and matched sibling in 8 patients.Median duration of onset of VOD was 10.5 days (4-183). The median age of the patients was 48 (26-57). 2 patients had grade I-III GVHD at time of VOD.12 patients had busulphan as part of conditioning and 1 patient received mylotarg 32 days prior to transplant. 5 patients had a previous HSCT (4 allograft and 1 autograft). Multi-organ failure occurred in 5 patients with a mortality rate of 80%.All patients were treated with Defibrotide (DF) obtained on compassionate use from Gentium SpA Italy.10/14(71%) of patients received a dose of 40mg/kg/day while 4/14 received doses between 10-20mg/kg/day.Median duration of therapy was 13 days (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) .DF was discontinued in 2 patients due to gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. Complete response of VOD was observed in 3/14(22%) with partial and no response noted in 5/14(35%) and 6/14(44%) respectively.Mortality at D100 was 6/14(44%) and 1 year mortality of 10/14(71%).On univariate analysis, prior allogeneic HSCT was the only variable associated with risk of developing VOD (p=0.005).This compares with 11.9%(n= 59) incidence of VOD in patients who underwent MA HSCT during the same period. Conclusion: RIC HSCT is associated with a lower incidence of VOD. Prior allogeneic HSCT correlates with a significant risk of VOD. DF can produce complete response in a certain proportion of patients. *BCNU/Etoposide/Cytarabine/Campath**Fludarabine/Melphal an/Campath***Fludarabine/Busulphan/Campath P743 Second reduced-intensity transplants are effective and well tolerated in older patients with relapsed myeloid malignancies F. E. Chen, H. N. Ahmad, P. Junagade, Z. Lim, S. Devereux, A. Pagliuca, A. Ho, G.J. Mufti Kings College London (London,UK) Previous reports of second allografts for relapsed leukaemia involved children or young adults. However, the majority of myeloid leukaemias present in patients over 50 years of age. Lower Transplant Related Mortality (TRM) from Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant has permitted older, previously not eligible patients to undergo allografts but options are extremely limited when the disease relapses. We report the outcome of second RIC transplants for these patients. Retrospective analysis of RIC transplants from Kings College identified 18 patients who received double RIC allografts for myeloid malignancies (3 AML, 10 MDS, 3 CML and 2 Myelofibrosis), of which 16 relapsed and 2 developed graft failure after the first transplant. The median age at second transplant was 55 years (R: 18-69). For the first allograft, 14 received Fludarabine (150mg/m\u00b2)/Busulphan (8mg/Kg)/Campath (100mg) (FBC), two Campath(80mg)/TBI (200cGy), and one Busulphan (12.8mg/Kg)/Cyclophosphamide (200mg/Kg) and one Etoposide (60mg/Kg)/TBI (1440cGy). For the second allograft, 6 received FBC, 4 FB, one Cyclophosphamide (120mg/Kg)/ALG (45mg/Kg), one Campath (100mg), 2 Mylotarg (18mg/m\u00b2), one Campath/TBI, one Fludarabine (150mg/m\u00b2)/Melphalan (140mg/m\u00b2) and 2 Fludarabine (150mg/m\u00b2)/Cytarabine (10g/m\u00b2)/GCSF(1800ug/m\u00b2) (FLAG). 11 patients received stem cells from the same donor as the first transplant and 7 from different donors. The median cell dose was 4.7 x 106 CD34 /Kg (R: 0.57 12.48). Seven received HLA-matched VUD and 11 HLA-matched sibling donor cells. Day 100 Disease Free Survival (DFS) was 50% and TRM 33% with no significant difference between sibling and VUD allografts. With a median follow up of 233 days (R: 4-1690 days), the Kaplan-Meier DFS reached a plateau of 26% at one year. Outcome was improved for those transplanted in complete remission (CR) (dysplastic and hypoplastic CR) compared to those transplanted in frank relapse. 50%(4/8) transplanted in CR remain disease-free, whereas only 12.5%(1/8) transplanted in relapse remain alive. Relapsed disease (38.5%), was the major cause of mortality after a second allograft, followed by Graft-versus Host Disease (30.8%) and infection(15.4%). Despite high TRM, second donor allograft performed for patients who achieve CR prior to transplant confers a DFS of 50% at 1 year. The risks of a second RIC transplant for patients who achieve remission prior to procedure are acceptable in patients over 50 years of age.",

Prebet, Q.H. Le, J. Boiron, D. Blaise, A. Huynh, I. Yakoub Agha, H. Esp\u00e9rou, M. Michallet Evidence of an impact of graft product on transplant outcome after PBSCT is actually rising. Here, we investigated retrospectively the potential impact of HSC recruitment procedure (i.e. G-CSF stimulation schedule and apheresis number) and graft composition (CD34+ and CD3+ cell number) on transplant outcome (GVHD, OS, EFS). Our analysis concerned 488 HLA matched sibling allogeneic reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) PBSCT for hematological malignancies (Table 1) reported on the SFGM-TC registry between 1998 and 2004. Follow-up was updated in April 2005. G-CSF median duration was 5 days (3-7days) at a median dose of 10\u00b5g/kg/day (4.6-16). G-CSF was given bid in 40% of the stimulations. Filgrastim was used in 59% of the donors (Lenograstim: 41%). Only 107 donors (22%) had a single apheresis. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5.6x106 CD34+/kg and the median CD3+ cells was 302x106 CD3+/kg (63-996). Conditioning regimen was most frequently an association of Fludarabine Busulfan and Anti Thymocyte Globuline (246 cases, duration of ATG 1 day: 18%, 2 days: 20%, 3 days: 20%, 4 days: 8% 5 days: 33%) or Fludarabine + TBI 2 Gy (123 patients). GVHD prophylaxis was a cyclosporine based treatment in 478 (95%) patients. Median follow-up after transplantation was 35 months (range: 0-86). Acute GVHD (grade II-IV) and cGVHD incidences were 35% (n=163) and 50% (n=217 for 430 patients) respectively. The 3year OS was 40% and the 3-year EFS was 34%. Treatment related mortality was 15% at 3 years. In multivariate analysis studying pre and post transplant factors a significant impact was shown of G-CSF duration (HR: 0.79 (0.62-1) p=0.05), G-CSF daily dose (HR: 1.13 (1-1.28) p=0.04) on OS and a trend for G-CSF dose on EFS (HR: 1.1 (0.97-1.25) p=0.12). Other variables also influenced OS (NHL vs AML, aGVHD grade II vs 0-I and III-IV vs 0-I and cGVHD: yes vs no) and on EFS (Sex mismatch, ABO incompatibility, NHL vs AML, FBS ATG duration: 5 days vs 2 days, aGVHD grade II vs 0-I and III-IV vs 0-I and cGVHD: yes vs no). No influence of graft composition or stem cell recruitment was demonstrated on incidence and severity of aGVHD and cGVHD although we found a significant impact of conditioning (FBS ATG 1 day vs 2days and Fluda-TBI vs FBS ATG 2days). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, surprisingly, graft composition has no impact on transplant outcome. Prolonged administration of moderate dose of G-CSF seems to be the best schedule for PBSC recruitment. (38%) developed a cGVHD:185 limited and 203 extensive (41% PBSC patients). With a median follow-up of 21 months, the 3-year probability of overall survival (OS) was for the global and PBSC population, 42% and 43% respectively. The cumulative TRM incidence was 13.5% at 1 year and 15% at 3 years. Table 1 showed, using a multivariate analysis, all variables which had a significant impact on OS for global and PBSC populations. This study pointed out, the major impact of disease status, acute and chronic GVHD and the important role of ATG duration on transplant outcome after RICT.",

This regimen consists of treosulfan 10-14 g/m\u00b2 on three days and fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 on five days. We have treated 32 patients with this conditioning regimen. The age of the patients was 23-64 (median 51) years. The diagnoses were MM 9, NHL 8, sAML 6, AML 2, ALL 2, MDS 1, CML 1, HD 1, MF 1, CLL 1. Most patients were heavily pretreated; 11 had previously undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. Eight patients received treosulfan in the dose of 10 g/m\u00b2, fourteen 12 g/m\u00b2, and nine 14 g/m\u00b2 per day. ATG was given to six of the 16 patients receiving a graft from an unrelated donor. Thirty grafts were blood stem cells and two bone marrow. Sixteen patients had a sibling donor and 16 an unrelated donor. The follow-up time is 0.2-43.5 (median 13.3) months. Twelve patients developed acute GvHD (grade I 6, grade II 1, grade III 5 patients). Fourteen of 24 evaluable patients have developed chronic GvHD (limited 11, extensive 3). Twenty-three of the 32 patients survive; the survival at 15 months is 63 per cent with no later deaths thus far. Of the nine patients who died, all but one died of disease relapse. The remaining patient died of early EBV lymphoproliferative disorder. We conclude that the use of a conditioning regimen consisting of treosulfan and fludarabine resulted in a very low transplantrelated mortality in this high-risk patient group, and the overall outcome looks promising, the follow-up still being relatively short. Conditioning with treosulfan and fludarabine deserves further evaluation in larger clinical trials.",

Todisco (1) Background: We analyzed the feasibility and efficacy of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) with reducedintensity conditioning (RIC) in patients with refractory or progressive Hodgkin's disease (HD) after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT). Patients and Methods: Fourteen patients with HD received allo-SCT with RIC. Six had chemoresistant disease and eight had chemosensitive one. All patients received a fludarabinebased RIC. Results: All patients engrafted and full donor chimerism was achieved in all but one patient. Grade II acute graft-versushost disease (GvHD) developed in 6/14 patients (43%). Chronic GvHD developed in 6/8 patients (75%). There was no early or late transplant-related mortality. With a median followup of 16 months (range 1-58), 10 of the 14 patients were alive (71%). Estimated overall survival at 1 and 2 years was 92% and 59%, respectively, for the whole population, 83% and 42% respectively for patients with chemoresistant disease and 100% for those with chemosensitive disease. Estimated progression-free survival at one year was 26%; 62.5% for chemosensitive patients and 0% for those with chemoresistant disease. Conclusions: Allo-SCT with RIC is feasible and prolongs survival of patients with relapsed and refractory HD after HDCT. Even if several questions are still open, this approach should proposed for these poor prognosis patients.",

Chevallier, S. Vigouroux, T. Guillaume, P. Moreau, N. Milpied, J.L. Harousseau CHU Hotel-Dieu (Nantes, F) Since almost ten years, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) hematoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)have been developed in order to obtain longer term disease control thanks to a graft versus leukemia effect and with an acceptable toxicity in patients with advanced age and disabilities. However, the place of RIC HSCT is still not clear in hematological tumors, also when it should be proposed according to the course of the disease. Here we report our own experience of 28 successive AML patients who underwent RIC HLA matched related (n=17) or unrelated (n=11) HSCT between november 1998 and september 2005 comparing outcome between patients in CR1 and those > CR1. There were 16 male and 12 female, 20 with de novo and 8 with secondary AML. According to FAB classification, there were 9 AML1, 9 AML2, 1 AML3, 4 AML4, 2 AML5, 1 AML7 and 2 with unknown subtype AML. Cytogenetics data included 5 patients with good risk, 14 with intermediate risk and 9 with high risk cytogenetics. Median age was 56 years (22-64).

Taniguchi Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: Although cord blood transplantation (CBT) is a promising approach for adult patients who lack a suitable donor, little information is available on central nervous system (CNS) complications after CBT, particularly with reducedintensity preparative regimens. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical characteristics of CNS complications after reduced-intensity cord blood transplantation (RICBT). Methods: Medical records of all patients who underwent RICBT for treatment of hematologic diseases at Toranomon Hospital between January 2001 and October 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects comprised 183 patients with a median age of 55 (range, 17-79 years). All patients received fludarabine-based reduced-intensity preparative regimens. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was cyclosporine (n = 92) or tacrolimus (n = 91) alone. The median number of infused total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34 positive cells was 2.8 x 10 7 cells/kg (1.7-5.2 ) and 0.74 x 10 5 cells/kg (0.11-3.90), respectively. Serological HLA matching was 4 of 6 in most patients. Results: A total of 38 patients (21 %) developed various CNS complications. Subtypes comprised infectious (n = 17; human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) encephalitis, n = 11; other viral encephalitis, n = 3; invasive aspergillosis, n = 2; bacterial meningitis, n = 1), cerebrovascular (n = 5; hemorrhage, n = 4; infarction, n = 1), metabolic (n = 6; hyperglycemia, n = 2; hypoglycemia, n = 1; hyponaturemia, n = 2; cyclosporine neurotoxicity, n = 1), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (n = 4), others (n = 2) and unknown (n = 4) complications. Eighteen patients (47.4 %) died within 30 days of developing CNS complications. Cause of death included disease progression (n = 1), infection (n = 10), subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 2), cerebral hemorrhage (n =1), multiple organ failure (n = 1), TMA (n = 1), acute heart failure (n = 1) and seizure (n = 1). Conclusion: The incidence of CNS complications after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation has been previously reported about 8.7 %. Our data suggests that cord blood source increases CNS complications. HHV-6 encephalitis may be the most common subtype of CNS complication after RICBT. We should try to reduce the incidence and severity of CNS complications after RICBT.",

Cordonnier (1) Flu-2Gy irradiation in 5, Cyclophosphamide (CPM)-antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in 1, and various Flu-regimens in 4. One patient had 2 consecutive RIC SCTs before MA SCT. The median delay between RIC and MA SCT was 10 months (range: 2.5-36 months). The same donor was used for the 1st and 2nd SCT in 13/18 cases. The MA transplant was conditioned with BU-CY (\u00b1VP16) in 9, Cyclo-TBI in 4, and other regimens in 5 patients. The median follow-up after MA SCT was 8 months Results: After the MA transplant, 1 patient developed venoocclusive disease, 2 developed interstitial pneumonia. Five patients died from relapse between 8-21 mo after MA SCT. Seven (41%) died from transplant-related causes at a median of 8 months (GVHD:3; infection:1; multi-organ failure:1;microangiopathy:1; EBV proliferative disease:1). 6/18 (33%) patients are alive and well 2 to 26 months after MA transplant. Three of them have extensive chronic GVHD while they did not develop any GVHD after RIC. The delay between the 2 transplants did not influence the outcome. Conclusion: Considering that most of these patients have initially received a RIC regimen because of their age or comorbidities, this survey shows that MA after RIC SCT has an acceptable toxicity. It may be considered for patients who relapsed or rejected after RIC transplant. Donor lymphocyte infusion should be, however, considered before a second transplant, each time possible.

We explored the effect of CD34+ cell graft dose and lymphocyte subpopulations on aGVHD in 28 patients treated with RIST for malignant (27) or non-malignant (1) haematological disorders. The preperative regimen was based on Fludarabine in combination with Busulfan, Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide while ATG was given in 13 patients. Patients received allografts from HLA-identical donors: 26peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), 1bone marrow( BM), 1 BM and PBSCs. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA and Mycophenolate Mofetil. Median doses of infused cells were: CD34 5.87x106/Kg, CD3 5,04 /CD4 2.74 /CD8 1.86/ CD19 0.47/ CD20 0.67/ CD56 0.08 x108/Kg. Prompt engraftment was achieved in all patients [platelets>50x109/l by day +12 (10-30); granulocytes >0.5x109/l by day +10 (4-18)]. Chimerism studies indicated 100% donor-derived engraftment in 17/19 evaluable patients (median time: day+60, range: 14-180). Eight patients developed aGVHD (3/8 Gr. III-IV); and 17/19 evaluable patients (89%). extensive cGVHD. Seven patients received donor lymphocyte infusions for relapse, without induced aGVHD. We studied the impact of ATG administration,CD34+ cell dose and lymphocyte composition of the graft on aGVHD incidence, overall survival (OS),disease free survival (DFS)and treatment related mortality (TRM). On univariate analysis, ATG administration was associated with reduced incidence of aGVHD (14% vs. 50%, p: 0.03). In ATG-treated patients, a significantly reduced aGVHD risk was associated with a CD8+ cell dose<1.86x108/Kg (0% vs. 25%, p: 0.03) and a CD56+ cell dose<0.08 x108/Kg (0% vs 22%, p: 0.03). On multivariate analysis, ATG administration was the only variable predicting for reduced aGVHD (p: 0.04). OS, DFS and TRM were not influenced by any variable.",

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the sole potentially curative approach in the therapy of multiple myeloma. In recent years, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens prior to allogeneic SCT are increasingly used in patients not eligible for conventional conditioning therapy due to advanced age or significant comorbidity. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label phase II trial to assess the feasibility of RIC with treosulfan and fludarabine prior to allogeneic SCT in multiple myeloma patients. Secondary assessment endpoints included engraftment and chimerism kinetics, acute and chronic graftversus-host disease (GvHD), conditioning-related toxicity, mortality analysis and efficacy. Treosulfan was administered on days -6 to -4 with daily doses ranging from 12g/m\u00b2 to 14g/m\u00b2, whereas fludarabine was administered on days -6 to -2 at a dose of 30 mg/m\u00b2. Twenty-eight patients with a median age of 52 years entered the trial between 2001 and 2005. Donors were matched unrelated in 13 (46%) cases, mismatched unrelated in one (4%) case and matched related in 14 (50%) cases. The median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 15 and 13 days, respectively. Conditioning-related grade III/IV toxicities occurred in 21 patients (75%). Grade III and IV acute GvHD was observed in 6 of 27 patients (22%), whereas 11 of 23 (48%) had chronic GvHD. The best response according to EBMT criteria was complete remission (CR) in 54% (14 of 26 patients), 45% of whom (10 of 22 patients) remained in CR at the last follow-up. Two patients (8%) died up to day +100 (both deaths treatment related). At last follow up 8 patients (32%) have died, one of them caused by relapse and 7 caused by treatment related complications. No patient died because of conditioning related toxicity. The median overall survival was not reached yet. We conclude that RIC with treosulfan and fludarabine is feasible in severely pretreated multiple myeloma patients and merits further evaluation.",

Ringhoffer, S. v Harsdorf, M. Schmitt, M. Wiesneth, J. Greiner, T. Zenz, S. Stilgenbauer, H. D\u00f6hner, D. Bunjes University Hospital Ulm (Ulm, D) Objective: The optimal time schedule and intensity of conditioning for patients (pts) suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is currently a matter of debate. We initiated a pilot trial for CML patients with a good response to imatinib and employed reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) followed by a T cell depleted graft. Study design: Study inclusion was based on a high risk Hasford score or patient choice. All pts were initially treated with 400 mg imatinib per day, the dosage was increased to a maximum of 800 mg in the case of insufficient response. The response to imatinib was determined by a quantitative Real-Time PCR with a sensitivity of 1 / 10 5 cells. All pts who had at least a 2 log reduction of bcr-abl/abl transcripts proceeded to transplant. The conditioning regimen consisted of 150 mg/m\u00b2 fludarabine and 140 mg/m\u00b2 melphalan (total dose). GVHD prophylaxis was performed with 100 mg Campath-1H iv (total dose). CyA was added in case of a MUD. Results: 10 pts with a median age of 50 (39-60) years have entered the trial so far. The median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 18 (9-99) months. 6 pts have been transplanted from an unrelated donor (1 pt: MUD-mismatch) and 4 pts from a matched related donor. The median follow-up is 23(5-31) months. All pts engrafted and we observed only grade I regimen related toxicity. 7 pts experienced a molecular and 1 pt a haematological relapse at a median interval of 6 months (4-11 months) after transplantation. 5 pts have been treated with a total of number of 8 donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and 1 further pt with imatinib. 3 pts achieved a 2nd molecular remission, however the other patients are still early after DLI. 3/10 pts died due to infectious complications. The probability of survival 2 years after transplant was 63% (SE 17%) by Kaplan-Maier analysis. Conclusion: Our early results show, that RIC followed by a T cell depleted graft in this patient group was feasible but associated with a high risk of molecular relapse. Scheduled DLI seem to be necessary to reintroduce or maintain the GvL effect and to protect from infectious complications.",

Lazzarino IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, I) Non myeloablative conditioning regimen for allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell leads to a reduction in acute post transplant morbility and mortality. This benefit may be counterbalanced by a possible increase in post transplant relapse. To address this topic we evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation from sibling donor using a reduced intensity preparative regimen versus myeloablative for patients with high risk acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Twenty one patients (RI group) selected for reduced conditioning regimen for advanced age, co-morbidities or poor performance status at transplant were conditioned with Thiotepa and Fludarabine given at total dose of 10 mg/kg and 125 mg/m\u00b2 respectively and peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation. Thirty four patients (MA group) were conditioned with Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide given at the standard total dose of 16 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg respectively; they received bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cell as stem cell rescue. As GvHD prophylaxis all patients received Cyclosporine A and Methotrexate. The median age in the RI group was 52 years (44-62), and 45 years (20-55) for the MA group. Disease status at transplant was as follows: five of 21 pts in the RI group were in first complete remission, one in partial remission, fifteen in advanced disease. In the MA group, 15 of 29 were in first CR, one in partial remission, one in second CR, the remaining patients were with more advanced disease. The actuarial overall survival at 3 years was 42% in the RI group and 53% in the MA group(p=NS). There was a trend towards a better DFS in patients with RA, RARS or acute leukaemia in remission. There were no significant differences in relapse between the two groups. Transplant related mortality at three years was 25% in the RI group and 23% in the MA group. Even though the majority of patients receiving thiotepa and fludarabine were with poor performance status or co morbidities only 4 pts died of transplant. Conclusion: Thiotepa and Fludarabine is a safe and effective conditioning for AML and MDS patients with poor performance status or advanced age. Its antileukemic efficacy appears to be equal to that observed using busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The bet will be to test this combination ( TT-Fluda ) in a randomised trial designed for patients candidate for myeloablative conditioning.",

Asfour King Hussein Cancer Center (Al-Jubeiha, JOR) Stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for patients with Thalassemia major. Older patients with high risk features are at increased risk for rejection and non-rejection complications. Reduced intensity conditioning is typically associated with reduced non-rejection mortality and could result in stable full or mixed donor chimerism. We report on two patients with high risk thalassemia major who received HLA-matched sibling allografts and had sustained full donor chimerism after preparation with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Our patients are two male patients 11 and 15 years of age. Both patients have hepatitis C. Both were transplanted from an HLA matched sibling. The conditioning regimen included Busulfan (2mg/kg every 12 hrs for 2days), Fludarabine (35mg/sqm per day for 5 days), horse ATG (30mg/kg per day for 5 days) and Total Lymphoid Irradiation (500 cGy once on day zero). GvHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine A and mycophenylate mofitil. VOD prophylaxis included actigal and clexane. Both patients tolerated the conditioning regimen pretty well with the exception of moderate mucositis in one patient. There was no VOD. Each opatient received 3 PRBC transfusions, the latest was on day 13 post transplant. One of the patients received one platelets transfusion on day 9. The nadir WBC was 0.7 and 0.5 on days 11. Only one patient developed mild acute GvHD of the skin. One had CMV reactivation on day 38 which cleared by day 52. Serial chimeric analysis showed a donor chimerism of 100%, 92%, 99% and 100% on days 21, 60, 180 and 365, respectively in one patient and 75%, 87%, 95% and 98% on days 18, 30, 60 and 180, respectively in the other patient.

Nachbaur Laboratory for Tumor and Immunobiology (Innsbruck, A) Background: Donor-recipient sex mismatch is an established risk factor for poor outcome after allogeneic myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) due to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is higher in male than female recipients of female stem cells. With longer follow-up, however, the graftversus-leukemia (GvL) effect due to HY minor histocompatibility antigen mismatch may predominate. The contribution of donor-patient sex on outcome after nonmyeloablative HSCT, however, has not been examined in detail yet. Methods: We therefore analyzed a single center cohort of 72 high risk patients transplanted with a related or unrelated stem cell graft after non-myeloablative conditioning for outcome. Results: The highest cumulative incidence for acute and chronic GvHD was detected in male patients receiving a stem cell graft from a male donor (52.4% and 53.3%, respectively). The highest relapse incidence (55.6%) was detected in male patients transplanted with stem cells from a female donor. This was borderline significant (p=0.0845) to female patients receiving a female graft (20% relapse incidence) and argues against an effective anti-HY-response in this patient cohort. Female recipients receiving a graft from a female donor displayed an unexpected high incidence for TRM (87.5%) which could not be explained by clinical characteristics. The overall survival of 40.6% 2.5 years after transplant in this group, however, was not different from male patients receiving a female graft (43.7% at 1.4 years after transplant). The overall survival from male patients with a male donor was slightly lower (33.0% at 2.5 years after transplant) compared to female patients transplanted with male stem cells (47.4% at 1.4 years after transplant). Conclusions: These data, analyzed in a small cohort of patients, show that a sex mismatch between patient and donor may have a negative impact also on outcome after myeloablative HSCT. However, studies with larger and homogeneous cohorts have to be performed to prove these findings.",

Harousseau CHU Nantes (Nantes, F) Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens provide the possibility of extending the procedure of allogeneic transplantation to older patients. Relatively limited data are available in patients aged above 60 years. We reviewed the outcomes of 21 older pts (median age, 62 years; range 60-65) with hematologic malignancies treated with RIC based on fludarabine, SAL and Busulfan followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation of matched sibling (n=19), matched unrelated donors (n=2) or bone marrow of a mismatched unrelated donor (n=1). Pts were treated for AML-MDS (n=10), CLL (n=5), multiple myeloma (n=3), lymphoma (n=2), and CML (n=1). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate for all except one who received in addition mycophenolate mofetil. Only one pt had a graft failure and recovered with his own marrow. Prior to allografting, 12 pts were in complete remission (CR). With a median follow-up of 40,6 months for surviving pts (range, 2 to 88.7 months), 14 of 21 pts are alive resulting in a 3 year survival rate of 64 %. Seven pts died as a result of relapse (n=2 both AML), GVHD-associated complications (n=3), or infections (n=2). Among 19 assessable pts following alloSCT, 14 were in CR, 2 in partial responses while 3 pts had relapsed. Clinical relevant acute GVHD grade II or higher developed in 7 of 21 pts (33%). Two pts transplanted with unrelated donor stem cells developed fatal grade IV GVHD. Extensive chronic GVHD was experienced by 8 of 16 assessable pts (50%). In older pts with responding malignancies, RIC with alloSCT may offer prolonged survival. Frequency of relapse was low in our group of pts, however at the expense of a high incidence of extensive chronic GVHD. Age \u2265 60 years is not anymore an obstacle to alloSCT.

Haas Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf (Duesseldorf, D) Dose reduced conditioning has expanded the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation to patients with advanced age or comorbid medical conditions who are not able to tolerate conventional conditioning regimens. A combination of CSA and MMF has most widely been used to promote engraftment and reduce the risk for severe GvHD. Encouraging results from solid organ transplantation prompted us to evaluate the combination of Tacrolimus and MMF after non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation in high-risk patients. During a 5 year period 42 patients with hematologic cancers (10 AML, 2 ALL, 4 CML, 4 MDS, 4 MM, 15 Lymphoma, 1 RCC) or vsAA (2) were treated with Fludarabine and 2Gy TBI. Both patients with vsAA received Cyclophosphamide (100mg/kg) in addition. Median age was 52 years (range 26-66) and 39 patients (93%) were considered to be high risk because of failure of previous therapies or unfavourable cytogenetics. The median number of previous chemotherapy cycles was 7 (range 1-17) and 22 patients (52%) had relapsed after a previous autotransplant. Patients received a median number of 8x10 6 CD34+cells/kg (range 1.4-25) from marrow (5) or mobilized blood (37) of matched related (4) or unrelated (38) donors. Of these, 10 patients (24%) received Campath 1H in addition and were scheduled for preemptive low dose DLIs in the absence of GvHD. A total of 39 evaluable patients (95%) engrafted of whom 2 (5%) experienced a secondary graft failure. Both patients with vsAA engrafted with marrow. A disease response was evident in 14 of 21 patients (67%) who had active disease at the time of transplantation. Acute GvHD occured in 55% (16x I-II, 6x III-IV) and 16 of 34 evaluable patients (47%) developed cGvHD (9x limited, 7x extensive). A total of 16 patients (38%) relapsed or progressed after initial response and 12 (29%) died of progressive disease. On the other hand 12 patients (29%) died of treatment related complications, which were GvHD and (7) or infection (5). After a median follow up of 643 days (28-1696) 18 patients (43%) are alive in remission (15 complete, 3 partial). We conclude that in this high-risk population the combination of Tacrolimus and MMF was effective in promoting engraftment and preventing severe GvHD in the majority of patients. Our data suggest, that Tacrolimus/MMF may be equivalent if not superior to CSA/MMF for GvHD prophylaxis after reduced intensity stem cell transplantation. Randomized studies comparing both regimens in this setting are needed.",

We report on a patient with severe pancytopenia who was transplanted using Campath 1H, cyclosporin and MMF alone for AML. The patient aged 57 years presented with AML. BM 50% blasts, typed as M1. Cytogenetics were trisomy 21. He was treated with FLAG-Ida and Myelotarg within the AML15 trial and BM at week 5 was in remission. Following a second course of FLAG-IDA he developed severe pancytopenia and at 3 months WCC 0.2 x 10 9 /l, platelets 10 x 10 9 /l. He developed a fungal chest infection and BM biopsies showed severe hypoplasia with no blast cell population detected. G-CSF stimulation showed no improvement. He was treated with Campth 1H 90mg given over 3 days and received a peripheral stem cell transplant from his HLA compatible brother. Posttransplant CSA and MMF were given for three and one month respectively. Post-transplant engraftment was prompt with WCC 3.7, neutrophils 2.7 and platelets 24 x 10 9 /l by day +28. BM at day +84 residual blast cell count 6%, at day +144 full remission with VNTR studies full donor chimerism. The patient had no toxicity related to the conditioning treatment, did not develop GVHD and remains well in full remission with followup 23 months. The immunosuppressive effect of fludarabine in the primary treatment protocol probably aided the engraftment of the transplant following Campath alone but this case demonstrates that the amount of conditioning an individual patient requires to ensure successful engraftment may be very little and that a GVL effect in AML can result in long term remission in a patient treated with minimal chemotherapy.",

In parallel, more and more patients can benefit from a suitable unrelated donor. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate survival and complications rates and to identify prognostic factors associated with prolonged survival after allogeneic HSCT following RIC from a fully or partially match unrelated donor. We choose to study the 130 patients registered in France from January 1998 to December 2003 to have a sufficient followup. The median patient age was 46y (18-67). All patients had haematological malignancies: acute leukaemia (n=43), myeloma (n=21), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=17), myelodysplasic syndrome (n=14), non Hodgkin lymphoma (n=15), Hodgkin disease (n=10) and myeloproliferative syndrome (n=5). Seventy-two patients (55%) were in an advanced phase of the disease at time of HSCT. The main conditioning regimens consisted in Fludarabin plus TBI 200 cGy (n=30), Fludarabin plus Melphalan (n=19), or were based on Fludarabin plus Busulfan (n=32). Anti-thymocytes globulins were part of the conditioning regimen for 95 patients (73%). The source of stem cells was the bone marrow for 52 patients and peripheral blood for 78 patients. Engraftment occurred in 117 patients (89%). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grade II to IV occurred in 58 patients (44%). Among the 37 patients who developed chronic GvHD, 16 patients had an extensive disease. Relapse occurred in 30% of the patients. There are 49 patients alive (38%) 7 to 88 months (median 29 months) after HSCT. The only clinical prognostic factor associated with poor survival was an advanced disease at time of HSCT. The impact of mismatches on engraftment, acute or chronic GvHD and survival is currently under evaluation in this cohort. In conclusion HSCT following RIC, with match or mismatch unrelated donors, is a feasible approach for patients with haematological malignancies leading to results comparable to those observed with sibling donors. However, prospective studies are needed to define the best conditioning regimens and the population of patients who is more likely to benefit from this approach.",

Tabrizi (1) Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (RICR) are increasingly used before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for patients not eligible for myeloablative conditioning. The relapse and survival rates after RICR allogeneic SCT were studied in 19 high-risk patients treated between February 2002 and December 2004. Ten males and 9 females with a median age of 47 years (15-55) received PBSC transplantation from a 10/10 (n=15) or 9/10 HLA antigenmatched donor (n=4). Acute leukemia was the main diagnoses (n=12; 6 AML and 6 ALL), the other diagnoses were 3 multiple myeloma, 2 CML, 1 NHL, 1 CLL. All patients had high-risk disease: 12 had second or > 2 complete remission, 5 second partial remission and 2 refractory disease. The preparative regimen consisted of cumulative dose of Busulfan 8mg/kg, Fludarabine 150 mg/m and ATG 7.5 mg/kg (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme, Lyon, France). Graftversus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen consisted of cyclosporine A and short-course methotrexate. Median followup was 14 months (5-39 months). Engraftment was complete in all but 2 patients with refractory disease and 14 patients achieved 100% donor CD3 (median 56 days, range 18-123). Grade 2 to 3 acute GVHD was seen in 3 (16%) patients, no grade 4 acute GVHD was observed. Grade 1 chronic GVHD was seen in 1 patient. Nine pts relapsed at a median time of 9.5 months, 3 pts had never reached a full CD3 donor chimerism. Twelve pts are alive, seven pts in complete remission, 2 pts with relapsed disease. Three pts relapsed and achieved a subsequent complete remission by chemotherapy, one of them received a second SCT, one a DLI and one other developed hepatic cGVHD and didnt receive DLI. Five pts died from recurrent disease, One pt died from cerebral toxoplasmosis and one other from cerebral hemorrhage due to a secondary poor graft function. Survival rate was 73% (95% CI 0.52-0.93) at 6 months and 60% (95% CI 0.38-0.83) at 1 year. PFS rate was 73% (95% CI 0.52-0.93) at 6 months and 33% (95% CI 0.09-0.57) at 1 year. In conclusion, in this cohort of pts, the progression-free survival is unsatisfactory. This can be explained by the advanced stage diseases and the low incidence of cGVHD, probably due to high immunosuppressive treatment. A less intensive immunosuppressive protocol can be tested to improve the results in this particular group of patients. The combination of fludarabin/melphalan-based reducedintensity allo-transplantation (RIT) with in vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) by the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab has demonstrated efficient engraftment and reduced graft-versushost disease (GVHD). However, this protocol is associated with a slow lymphocyte recovery leading to a delayed antiinfectious and anti-tumor immunity. In a phase I study, we investigated the early prophylactic use of CD8-depleted donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) in order to improve immune reconstitution after TCD/RIT. For CD8 depletion of donor leukaphereses, a protocol using novel clinical grade CD8 microbeads was applied. This procedure was efficient in reducing the content of CD8 T cells by 2.5 to 4 logs, while NK cells, B cells, and CD4 T lymphocytes remained largely unchanged. Eighteen high-risk patients with various hematological malignancies were treated and followed for longer than 6 months. In 4 patients, persistent cutaneous GVHD prevented the DLI application. These patients exhibited a spontaneous rise of circulating T cells to > 200x10 6 /L before d+120 posttransplant. Neither increasing T-cell numbers nor persistent acute GVHD were seen in patients who qualified for DLIs. Up to now, 11 patients received a total of 17 CD8-depleted DLIs starting on d+60 after sibling and d+120 after unrelated donor transplantation, respectively.",

Guenther, S. Leiblein, J. Thiery, D. Niederwieser, T. Lange University of Leipzig (Leipzig, D) Objectives: The majority of patients with acute leukaemia lack disease-specific molecular markers to monitor the graftversus-leukaemia effect after stem cell transplantation (SCT) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). WT1 is expressed on normal hematopoietic progenitors but has also been used as a panleukemic marker to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with acute leukemia. We show that WT1 transcript kinetics within day +84 predict a relapse in patients after SCT with RIC. Patients and Methods: 96 consecutive patients (median age 60.4, range 21.9-74.2 years) under-went allogeneic SCT for AML (n=69), ALL (n=7) or MDS (n=20) using related (n=24) or unrelated (n=72) donors following a TBI 2 Gy (n=95) or 3 Gy (n=1) and Fludarabin (n=90) conditioning regimen. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of mycophenolyte mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporin A in all patients. WT1 levels were analyzed in duplicates at baseline, and on days 28, 56, and 84 in a total of 322 peripheral blood (PB) samples and normalized by the control gene ABL. To ensure sufficient RNA quality, all negative samples with less than 5000 copies of the ABL gene were excluded. Results: WT1/ABL expression levels in PB were significantly higher in patients (median 2.9, range 0 -4649.1) compared to 10 healthy volunteers (median 0.7, range 0-3.1, p=0.018, Mann-Whitney-Test). Furthermore, there was a close correlation between the levels of WT1 in PB and bone marrow blasts (r=0,7; Pearson). 23 patients (24%) relapsed within the first six months after SCT. WT1 expression of these patients prior to relapse (median 8.3, range 0 -1970.5) was significantly higher compared to pa-tients without relapse (median 1.7, range 0 -2322.3, p<0.01). In addition, patients with relapse beyond day 84 (n=8) showed a significant (p=0.013) increase in WT1 levels within 3 months (median 2.4, range -4.4 -5.4log) compared to relapse-free patients (median 0, range -7.4 -4.8log). WT1 expression one month prior to relapse (n= 16, median 28.9, range 2.6 -1970.5) was significantly higher compared to patients without relapse (p<0.01). We conclude that WT1 expression in PB is a reliable marker for disease monitoring in AML, ALL and MDS patients after SCT with RIC. The question whether WT1 quantification is superior for predicting relapse compared to FISH or chimerism is currently being evaluated. Nevertheless, WT1 expression is an additional tool for an individualized immunosuppressive therapy after SCT to avoid relapse.",

Mohty (1) to sustain a long term thymopoiesis or to a limited potential of the grafted bone marrow compartment to supply the thymus with progenitors, we have tried to correlate the level of donor myeloid chimerism to the status of thymopoiesis in 31 SCID patients analyzed between 10 to 27 years after HSCT. Thymic function was evaluated by quantifying T-cells receptor excision circles (TRECs) as well as CD31+CD45RA+CD4+ naive T-cells in PBMCs. Detection of donor myeloid cells segregated patients into two main groups: the first group (12 patients) in which neutrophil cells are partially or exclusively from donor origin. The second group (19 patients) characterized by myeloid cells belonging to the recipient. Significantly higher TREC levels have been found in group 1 compared to group 2. All the patients who received a high dose busulphan (16 or 20 mg/kg) displayed a high TREC levels and myeloid donor engraftment. Conversely, no difference in the frequency of donor myeloid engraftment appeared between patients who received a low dose of busulphan (8mg/kg) and those who did not receive any conditioning regimen (CR). The 2nd group with recipient myeloid chimerism has been dissociated in 2 subgroups depending on the thymic function: patients with TREC counts near zero (10 patients) and those still harboring positive TREC values and normal amounts of CD31+CD45RA+ CD4+ (9 patients). The heterogeneity in the recent thymic emigrants production observed in this group has been influenced neither by the conditioning regimen nor by GVHD occurence. Two main differences have been suggested to explain the discrepancy between the 2 subgroups: first, the patients who have positive TREC values have been analyzed before those who displayed negative TREC values. Second, the subgroup with positive TRECs levels is composed of SCID-X1 patients. It is possible that the profound absence of thymic progenitors characterising this disease had permitted the thymic seeding by a population of very early progenitors with some self-renewal capacity, enabling long term potentialities. Thirteen SCID and three Ommen's syndrome children were transplanted in our BMT unit. Mutations in gamma-chain of cytokine receptor (2), IL-7Ra (1) and RAG1/RAG2 (4) were identified among genetic hallmarks of the disease. Five girls and ten boys with median age of 13 months (ranged: 3-36 months), conditioned with BuCy (6) or TreoCy (8) and with ATG for alternative donors transplantation, were transplanted. Patients received bone marrow (4 pts), PBPC (10 pts) or bone marrow and PBPC in 2 cases. Transplantations were from sibling (2), matched unrelated (8) or haploidentical (6) donors. PBPC was manipulated in 6 cases (counter-flow elutriation -4, CD3+ cells depletion -1, CD34+ cells selection -1). Median dose of transplanted CD34+ cells was 8.1x10 6 kg/bw (range: 1.1-37.6). CsA was given as GvHD prophylaxis in all cases. Thirteen patients (81%) are alive (range: 4-95,4 months, median 54). At the blood level four patients achieved complete chimerism (CC), 8 mixed chimerism (MC) and one patient failed to engraft. However, all patients including those with MC in whole blood showed donor genotype in CD3+ blood cells. There was no difference in mean percentage of CD3+ cells, measured from 4 to 54 months post transplant, between children with whole blood CC and those being MC in whole blood but CC in CD3+ cells (61.3% vs 60.3%). In 9 out of 12 children TREC were detected in PBMNC. In these 9 children numbers of TREC were, however, lower (range: 259-1760x10 5 , median 808x10 5 cells) as compared to their healthy counter partners (range: 1239-3394x10 5 , median 2075x10 5 cells, p<0.005). TREC were found in a similar proportion of children with blood CC and MC -being CC only in CD3+ cells population (3/4 vs 6/8, respectively). However, blood CC children had a higher number of TREC as compared to those being CC only in CD3+ cells subpopulation (median values: 880.5x10 5 vs 536x10 5 ; ns). Total number of CD3+ lymphocytes was higher in TREC positive than in TREC negative children post-transplant (1713 cells/ul + 848 vs 378 cells/ul + 167). Observation time post-transplant was from 521 to 1536 days in TREC negative and from 369-2862 days in TREC positive children. Complete chimerism in CD3+ cells population, in spite, of mixed chimerism in whole blood cells, secures T cells recovery (percentage of T cells and TREC) in SCID patients receiving HSCT.

Friedrich, A. Schulz University of Ulm (Ulm, D) Malignant infantile osteopetrosis (OP) is a rare hereditary disorder of osteoclast function and is characterized clinically by early onset visual impairment, hypocalcemia, hematopoietic failure and early death. The major molecular defect is a mutation in osteoclasts of the proton pump TCIRG1. Since osteoclasts are cells of hematopoietic lineage the disease can be reversed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). In patients with OP this curative treatment has been associated with a significant incidence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD). In recent studies defibrotide (DF) demonstrated superior efficacy in the treatment of VOD. Early intervention in severe VOD and younger age of patients were associated with a better outcome encouraging prophylactic use of DF in children. We report here the outcome in 20 children with OP transplanted in a single centre between 1996 and 2005. Nine patients transplanted between 2001 and 2005 received DF prophylaxis and were compared to a historic control of 11 patients with OP transplanted between 1996 and 2001 not receiving this prophylaxis. Age, sex, time to transplant and hematologic status prior to transplant were comparable in both groups. The control group differed with the use of thiotepa for conditioning and a predominance of peripheral blood stem cells due to more haploidentical donors. Severe VOD was defined based on the presence of multiorgan failure (MOF). The overall incidence of VOD in the control group was 63.4% (7/11) versus 11.1% (1/9) in the prophylaxis group. Severe VOD occurred in 3 patients in the control group versus none in the prophylaxis group. Two of the three patients were admitted to intensive care for a total duration of 54 days. The overall mortality was 18.2% (2/11) in the control group and 11% (1/9) in the prophylaxis group. One patient in the control group succumbed to VOD related MOF. The second patient in the control group and the one patient in the prophylaxis group died of complications secondary to graft rejection. DF was tolerated well. Infectious complications, the incidence of graftversus-host disease and the long term outcome were comparable in both groups. Prophylactic DF can be implemented in current transplant protocols and might be beneficial in a high risk pediatric population. A prospective randomized international multicentre trial is open for recruitment and intends to answer the question if prophylactic DF can influence the incidence, morbidity and mortality of VOD.",

Vassal (1), H. Esp\u00e9rou (2), , J.C. Gentet (3), F. Doz (4), F. M\u00e9chinaud (5) , C. Galambrun (6), B. Neven (7) , C. Levrault (8), V. Cadic (8), L. Nguyen (8), H. Zouabi (8) Background: busulfan (Bu) based conditioning regimens is frequently included in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, plasma concentrations versus time profiles (AUC) of oral Bu vary considerably. Overexposure is correlated with higher toxicities while underexposure is associated with graft rejection. The IVBu provided reliable dosing, reduced inter-and intra-pts pharmacokinetic (PK) variability avoiding therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). A new body-weight based calculation of IV Bu fixed dose demonstrated to target AUC (900-1500 \u00b5M.min) in children [ Nguyen L et al. BMT 2004] . The PK results of a new prospective study in children have been presented earlier [Vassal G. et al, ASCO 2005; # 8535] . We now report the results of PK, PK vs. pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships on engraftment and regimen-related toxicities. Methods: children received either IVBu/Melphalan (Mel, 140 mg/m\u00b2) or IVBu /Cyclophosphamide (Cy, 200 mg/kg) before autologous (auto-) or allogeneic (allo-) HSCT, respectively. IV Bu was infused over 2 h at 1.0 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 0.95 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg for pts < 9 kg, 9 to < 16 kg, 16 to 23 kg, >23 to 34 kg, and >34 kg strata of weight, respectively. No dose adjustment was allowed. Bayesian Bu AUCs were calculated at doses 1, 9 and 13. Results: Overall, 55 patients (pts) with a median age 6 y [0.3 -17.2], 20 pts \u2264 4 y, were enrolled: 27 and 28 received IVBuMel and IVBuCy, respectively. Bu clearance widely varied (CV=50%) however the new dosing enabled homogeneous AUCs whatever the patient's weight. AUC inter-pts variability was hugely reduced (CV < 20%). In allo-HSCT, all AUCs were > 900 \u00b5M.min (engraftment threshold) without early and/or late graft rejection. Over-exposure was limited (all AUCs < 2100 \u00b5M.min) without correlation with the low incidence of VOD in allo-(2/28; 7%) and in auto-(4/27; 15%) pts. Of note, 87 % and 91% of AUCs in allo-and auto-pts were < 1500 \u00b5M.min. In auto-pts, there was a significantly positive correlation (R^2=0.35, p<0.01) between stomatitis severity and AUC. It was also illustrated that higher AUC tended to increase bilirubin value from baseline, but the correlation was weak. No significant correlations were detected with other toxicities and efficacy parameters. Conclusion: IV Bu fixed doses on body weight successfully targeted a therapeutic AUC without any PK monitoring and contributed to the efficacy and safety in IV Bu-based HSCT regimens in children. Busulfan is an alkylating agent, used in conditioning regimens before stem cell transplantation in combination with other cytostatic drugs. Intravenous busulfan is a relatively new pharmaceutical formulation of which the optimal dosage regimen has not been fully established in children. Until recently, busulfan was administered four times daily per os and the dosing scheme was based on both weight and age. We studied the pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical outcome of a new once-daily intravenous AUC-targeted dosing scheme for busulfan based on body surface. Methods: All children (n=18) undergoing busulfan-based conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantation were enrolled. Median age was 6 years (0.5 -14 years). The starting dose was 1 x 80 mg/m\u00b2. Unlimited dose adjustment was allowed to reach the target AUC (3800 mmolar*min). This target AUC was based on a previous study in our hospital (Zwaveling, 2005) . PK studies were performed as described (Cremers, 2002) . In an additional study with short follow up 17 patients received a higher starting dose (120 mg/m\u00b2) and higher target AUC; the results are pending. Results: The average AUC was 2882 +/-753 mmolar*min at a dose of 80 mg/m\u00b2. This resulted in an average dose increment to 108 (+/-23) mg/m\u00b2 in order to reach the target AUC. In only one patient the dose was decreased. The mean elimination half-life and volume of distribution were 2.4 (+/-0.5) hours and 0.78 (+/-0.15) L/kg, respectively. Despite the high systemic peak levels, there was no unexpected or unusual toxicity. Treatment related mortality due to GvHD III-IV plus sepsis was seen in two patients (11%); one (5.5%) also had moderate veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Donor engraftment was established in 14 out of 18 patients (78%); two were successfully re-transplanted. Relapse occurred in two patients. Fourteen patients survived with a median followup of 1.5 year (0.8 -2 years). In our previous study, in which busulfan was administered four times daily, engraftment was observed in 94% and VOD in 26% of the children (Zwaveling, 2005) . Conclusion: Our data show that intravenous once-daily busulfan in children is safe, convenient, and feasible and can be dosed surface-based, independent of age. There was very limited (liver) toxicity but the lower target AUC may have contributed to the relatively high rejection rate. Future investigations should be aimed at further optimizing the target AUC of intravenous busulfan for specific patient groups.",

            "text": "Anti-leukaemic activity of NK-cell-clones in children after haploidentical stem cell transplantation M. Pfeiffer, T. Feuchtinger, A. Barbarin-Dorner, M. Schumm, R. Handgretinger, P. Lang University Tuebingen (Tuebingen,D) Relapses after haploidentical transplantation in children with acute leukemias represent a major problem. Influence on relapse rate after haploidentical transplantation has been shown if there is a KIR-Ligand mismatch or a KIR-Receptor-Ligand mismatch between donor and recipient in regard to the three \"major\" KIRs. We have shown a significant higher amount of KIR negative and KIR single positive NK cells in the first 100 days after transplantation, which could have an alloreactive potential due to these two models of alloreactivity. Here we present functional data of KIR negative and single positive NK clones in children after haploidentical transplantation . We generated a total of 135 NK-cell-clones in 5 patients after haploidentical transplantation (mean clone number/patient: 27\u00b1 6,5) and tested their cytolytic activity against different cell lines and/or different kryopreserved leukemic blasts. 39% of all tested clones were KIR-negative, 40% KIR-single-positive and 21% expressed more than one KIR-receptor. All clones showed a high activity against K562 cells and a different activity pattern against cell lines missing different KIR-ligands. We found reactive clones (specific lysis > 10%) against ALL and AML leukemic blasts, but the killing could not be predicted by the expression of KIR-receptors. Further flow-cytometry analysis of well-and poorly-killing clones did not show differences in the expression of different activating-and adhesion-molecules and therefore other influencing variables remain to be investigated. Interestingly, occurrence of reactive clones was not limited to patients with a KIR-mismatched donor. In conclusion we found NK-clones in children after haploidentical transplantation reactive against both AML and ALL leukemic blasts. Killing of the leukemic blasts could not be predicted by the KIR-expression of the clones and was not limited to patients with a KIR-mismatched donor. Such reactive NK cells may be potential effectors of a GvL-effect after transplantation. Bu exposure (AUC) has been correlated with outcomes, thus dose adjustment and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were needed. An IV Bu formulation would allow to target AUC and improve outcomes of HSCT. We previously reported that a new IV Bu fixed dose based on body-weight calculation can successfully target a therapeutic AUC in children without any dose-adjustment and TDM. We report here the pharmacokinetics (PK) results and clinical outcomes of this cohort. Methods: children received Bu/Melphalan (Mel, 140 mg/m\u00b2) before autologous (auto-, n=27) or Bu/Cyclophosphamide (Cy, 200 mg/kg) before allogeneic (allo-, n=28) HSCT. Donors were mainly HLA-matched sibling (n=22). IV Bu was administered over 2 h at 1.0 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 0.95 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg for pts with < 9 kg, 9-< 16 kg, 16-23 kg, >23-34 kg, and >34 kg strata of weight, respectively. PK was performed at doses 1, 9 and 13 but no dose adjustment was allowed. Indications for HSCT were: high risk neuroblastoma (n= 24), Ewing sarcoma (n=3) for auto-HSCT; AML (n= 14), CML (n= 3), ALL (n=1), MDS (n=1), hemoglobinopathy (n=6), and immunodeficiency (n=3) for allo-HSCT. Median age (range) was 4.0 y (0.7-14.9), and 7.2 y (0.3-17.2) for auto-and allo-HSCT, respectively. Results: Bu PK analysis demonstrated that 91% of AUCs were in 900-1500 \u00b5M.min range, despite a large variability (CV= 50%) on Bu clearance among dose levels. IVBu was well tolerated. VOD incidence was 15% (95% CI: 4-33.7%) and 7% (95% CI: 0.9-23.5%) in auto-and allo-HSCT recipients, respectively but none was severe. There was no death at Day+100. Median follow-up was 31.6 months (range 20.1-41.2) and 28.0 months (range 18.2-38.2) after auto-and allo-HSCT, respectively. Cumulative incidence of TRM was 0% (auto-HSCT) and 3.8% (allo-HSCT). Donor engraftment was documented in all recipients: 26/28 achieved complete chimerism, and 2/28 were mixed chimeras but had mainly donor cells (>85%). Two-years Event-free and overall survivals were as follows: 59% + 18% and 70% + 18%, respectively after auto-HSCT; and 85% + 13% for both probabilities after allo-HSCT. Conclusion: This new IV Bu fixed dosing can successfully target a therapeutic AUC without any dose-adjustment (TDM) and results in a low incidence of transplant-related mortality. Almost all allo-recipients achieved complete donor cells. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only definitive treatment for bone marrow failure in patients with Fanconi's Anemia (FA), but the unique susceptibility of these patients to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents presents special challenges. We present data on first SCT's performed in 41 FA patients in 4 Israeli medical centers between 1989 and 2004. Reason for SCT was aplastic anemia in 33 pts, leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in 6 pts, and cytogenetic aneuploidy in 2 pts. Half the patients were Jewish (evenly split among Ashkenazi and Sephardi ancestry); the remainder were of Arab ancestry. Mean age at SCT was 10.7 yrs (range 3 -21 yrs). Donors were matched family members (MFD) (29 patients), mismatched relatives (5 pts, including 3 haplotypemismatched donors), or unrelated volunteers (7 patients). Stem cell sources included marrow (21 pts), peripheral blood (13 pts), cord blood (4 pts), and cord blood + marrow (3 pts). Six grafts were T-cell depleted ex-vivo. 19 pts received thoraco-abdominal irradiation (TAI), while others received fludarabine + cytoxan with or without serotherapy (non-TAI). Median time to neutrophils > 500/ul was 13 days; the last platelet transfusion was administered on day +19 (median). Eight patients did not engraft or suffered early graft rejection. Among 29 pts grafted from MFD, 23 survived > 100 days and 1 patients experienced autologous recon-stitution. None of the patients receiving haploidentical transplants engrafted after their first transplant, and 4/9 pts grafted from alternative donors survive. Acute graft vs host disease (aGVHD) occurred in 5/19 TAI and 6/22 non-TAI pts, and was fatal in 5 TAI and 1 non-TAI pts. Median follow up is 96 months in TAI pts and 36 months in non-TAI patients. Late deaths occurred in 3 TAI pts (2 with recurrent leukemia, 1with esophageal carcinoma), but in none of the non-TAI patients. Overall survival is 21% in TAI and 86% in non-TAI pts. Mean hemoglobin at follow-up is 14.3 g/dl vs. 12 g/dl in a group of non-FA long-term SCT survivors (p=0.001). SCT in FA pts using MFD and non-TAI conditioning results in excellent survival. Longer follow-up is required to document occurrence of late malignancy. Results of alternative donor SCT and of transplants utilizing TAI yield less favorable outcomes. The finding of higher hemoglobin concentration in long-term survivors merits further investigation. A. Mu\u00f1oz, S. Maldonado, T. Olive, E. G.Valentin, P. Gomez, J.M. Perez-Hurtado, A. Martinez, A.

The use of unrelated matched donors represents a therapeutic option. We reviewed the outcome of all patients who received a matched -sibling donor (MRD , n=30) or matched-unrelated donor ( MUD , n=27) HSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL )in second remission(2nd CR) between January 1999 and December 2003 in the 10 centers belonging to GETMON. Age, sex and interval diagnosis / relapse were similar in both groups. The interval relapse/ HSCT was longer in the MUD group. Conditioning regimen consisted of irradiation plus chemotherapy in 22/30 for MRD transplants and 20/27 for MUD transplants; the remaining patients were conditioned with chemotherapy alone. ATG was added to the conditioning regimen in 19 /27 MUD transplants. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA and methotrexate in most patients. There were not significant differences in engraftment rate or time to engraftment between the two groups. Acute GVHD grade 3-4 was 48% for MUD HSCT recipients and 30% for MRD (p=0, 16) . The early transplant -related mortality were 6,7% and 37% in the MRD and MUD groups respectively ( p=0,016).Relapse rate were 36.7 and18.55 respectively (p =0.05). Lansky performance scores in event-free survivors were 90-100 in 86% of the MRD group and 81% of the MUD group. With a median follow -up of 50 months, 3-year probability of EFS was 43% +/-9% and 36% +/-9% in the MRD and MUD HSCT groups respectively (p=0, 25). Conclusions: These results suggest that MUD HSCT is a valuable therapy for children with ALL in 2nd CR and underscores the importance of unrelated donor expediting searches for patients lacking a MRD.",

The therapeutic window is narrow and the intra-and inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics is wide. High concentrations of busulphan have been reported to be correlated with increased incidence of veno-occlusive disease, while low concentrations were associated with graft rejection and relapse. The standard dose is 1 mg/Kg administered orally every 6 hours for 16 doses, but once-daily dosages of busulphan have been used without increased incidence of complications. Material and methods: 37 age-and disease-matched patients from each of two Swedish paediatric transplantation centres; one using a standard 4-times a day administration of 1 mg/Kg and one using a b.i.d administration of 2 mg/Kg of busulphan as part of the conditioning regimen are presented. The patients were analysed for outcome, frequency of venoocclusive disease and busulphan plasma concentration expressed as area under the curve (AUC). To estimate AUC for the first dose, we used our limited sampling model based on three concentrations (1, 3 and 6 hr) for all population of children. The dose was adjusted to maintain an AUC of 4800-5500 ng/mLx hr in the 4 dose regimen and 9600-11000 ng/mL xhr during the conditioning period in the b.i.d regimen. Results: During the period 1990-2005 eight vs. nine autologous and 29 vs. 28 allogeneic transplantations were done at the 4-dose regimen centre and at the two-dose regimen centre, respectively, for malignant (leukaemia, neuroblastoma, lymphoma) and non-malignant (immunodeficiencies, FHL, aplastic anaemia and metabolic) diseases. The incidence of VOD at the 4-dose centre was 6/37 and at the 2-dose centre 7/37. Overall survival (mean follow up of 65 months) was 18/37 (49%) in the 4-dose regimen centre and 26/37 (70%) in the 2-dose regimen centre (mean follow up of 24 months). Median value of busulphan concentration was at 4530 ng/mL x hr (range 2589-8649 ng/mL x hr) in the 4-times daily population and 8835 ng/mL x hr (range 1233-31167 ng/mL x hr) in the 2-times daily population. No significant differences between both centres were observed when analysing the treatment related toxicity such as VOD and GVHD. Conclusion: The b.i.d administration of oral busulphan at the dose of 2mg/kg for 8 doses is a safe alternative to the standard regimen given 1 mg/kg four times a day for 16 doses. It is generally better tolerated by children and easier to administer.",

Gorczynska (1) Late-onset (> 48 hours after end of conditioning) hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a frequent, potentially life-threatening complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HPCT). Polyomaviruses (HPV: BKV and JCV) and Adenoviruses (AdV) are common etiological factors. There is no accepted treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Cidofovir in the treatment of HC after HPCT. The study included 321 children, 35 with non-malignant diseases and 286 with malignancies, 117 after auto-HPCT and 204 after allo-HPCT. In 142 patients regular urine and plasma screening for AdV and HPV with qualitative PCR-based method was performed. HC diagnosis was based on the symptoms of lower urinary tract irritability and hematuria (> 50 ery/mm\u00b3) lasting \u2265 3 days. The severity of HC was assessed according to a 3-stage scale. Symptomatic treatment of HC included: hyperhydration (all), bladder catheter installation (stage 2 and 3), irrigation with AgNO3 (some stage 2); cystoscopic clots evacuation, suprapubic catheter installation and continuous bladder irrigation (stage 3 HC with urinary tract obstruction). Cidofovir (CDV, 5 mg/ kg once weekly) was used in 29 children until resolution of HC. In 1 patient with renal impairment CDV was reduced to 1 mg/kg. Results: Late-onset HC was diagnosed in 56 children (17.4%), in 55 (26.7%) after allo-HPCT. Viruria was detected in 33 children with HC: AdV in 4 (12,1%), BKV in 27 (81.8%), JCV in 1 (3%) and BKV+JCV in 1. Twenty three patients with HC were not screened for viruses. Among 30 treated patients: a) 2 progressed to grade 3 HC (6.7%) but improved after 59 and 105 days; b) 22 (73,3%) presented with mild (17) or moderate (5) symptoms and improved after median 26 days; c) 6 (20%) died due to other reasons without progression of HC. No HCrelated death was noted. Among 26 patients without CDV: a) 7 (26.9%) progressed to grade 3 HC -6 died with HC, 1 resolved; b) 14 (53.8%) presented with mild (12) or moderate (2) symptoms and improved after median 28 days; c) 5 (19.2%) died due to causes other then HC without progression. In 2 untreated children HC was the main cause of death. The 100-day TRM was higher in untreated patients (0.35 vs 0.17), the duration of HC did not differ. No considerable side effects of CDV were noted. Conclusions: Late-onset HC mainly related to BKVreactivation is a frequent complication after allo-HPCT. Treatment with Cidofovir is feasible and may improve the outcome of virus-induced HC.",

Although it is well characterized in adults especially in autologous transplants, data analyzing its frequency and significance in pediatric patients and in the allogeneic setting are limited. We therefore retrospectively analyzed 68 consecutive stem cell transplants after myeloablative chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation performed at our center to determine incidence, complications of and predisposing factors for ES in a pediatric transplant cohort. Methods: Diagnosis of ES was established when patients presented with either skin rash or signs of capillary leakage (defined by weight gain and hypalbuminemia) or pulmonary dysfunction (dyspnea and requirement of oxygen supplementation) within 7 days before engraftment (neutrophils >500/mcl for 2 consecutive days). Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was also documented but not esteemed sufficient for diagnosis of ES when occurring without additional symptoms. Results: We could diagnose ES in 56% of all patients in this patient cohort. It was associated with FUO in 62%, rash in 32%, capillary leakage in 29% and pulmonary dysfunction in 13% of all patients. In a univariate analysis, incidence did not differ statistically significantly between recipients of autologous or allogeneic transplants (43% vs 59%). Application of G-CSF was also not associated with a higher frequency of ES (63%), but these patients had a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary dysfunction (42% with G-CSF vs. 2% without). Prednisolone (2mg/kg) was administered therapeutically in 68% of patients with ES. No patient died of complications attributable to ES. Conclusion: ES is an equally frequent complication in pediatric allogeneic as well as autologous HSCT recipients. Administration of G-CSF did not lead to an increased incidence of ES as reported elsewhere, but it lead to a higher rate of pulmonary complication in this study. Empirical treatment with prednisolone was effective and associated with an excellent outcome in these patients.",

However, a proportion is still not cured by this therapy and may benefit from bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first complete remission. Because the majority of these children will not have suitable related donor, unrelated bone marrow transplantation (URBMT) offers a therapeutic alternative. Until recently, URBMT has been restricted to patients with high-risk features, because of high transplant-related mortality (TRM) (60%), especially in adults. However, in paediatric patients, recent studies have shown no difference in TRM between related donors (RD) and URD BMT.

            "text": "Between January 1993 and September 2002, 32 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, 22 acute myelogenous leukaemias and 20 myelodysplasia received BMT in the paediatric bone marrow transplantation in Lyon. BMT was performed in the presence of one (n=11), two (n=2), or three (n=3) HLA disparities in the URBMT group. The median age at BMT was 8.11 years [0.6 to 17.8]. Cyclosporine alone was used for GVH prophylaxis for RBMT. Antithymocyte globulin was added in all URBMT. All patients received non manipulated bone marrow transplant and myeloablative conditioning. Results: Marrow engraftment was obtained in 68 children (no engraftment for 2 URD BMT and 4 MRD BMT). The median time to achieve 0.5x109/L neutrophils was 18 and 24 days for RBMT and URBMT respectively. The probability of developing acute Graft-vs-Host-Disease (GVHD) III-IV was 4% and 8% and cumulative chronic GVH was 14% and 24% respectively for RBMT and URBMT. Eight patients died from BMT related causes (10%). No significant difference was observed in overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) between RBMT and URBMT: 77.5% vs 80% and 69% vs 68% (p-value=NS). Analysing influence of severity of GVHD on OS demonstrated an improvement in OS for patients with grade I to II acute GVHD in comparison with patients without grade I to II GVHD or severe grade 3 to 4 GVHD (p=0.04). Unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation should be considered in high risk paediatric patient early in CR1. There is an ongoing debate about the relativ benefit of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) versus bone marrow (BM) for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) in children. In adult HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation, previous studies have indicated a comparable outcome with both stem cell sources. Here we present the first comparison of the outcome following PBSC vs. BM transplantation from MUD in an entirely pediatric cohort. A total of 61 pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies underwent PBSC (n=38) or BM (n=23) transplantation from \u2265 5/6 HLA antigen-matched unrelated donors following myeloablative conditioning at our institution from 1992 -2004. PBSC and BM groups were comparable with regard to GvHD prophylaxis, disease category, disease status at transplant and recipient age, while differences were detected in recipients sex, conditioning regimen and median year of transplant. Neutrophil (ANC > 500/\u00b5l) and platelet (>50.000/\u00b5l) engraftment was achieved faster after PBSC compared to BM transplantation (median time: 18 vs. 24 days for neutrophils, p=0.001 and 26 vs. 33 days for platelets, p=0.09). The rate of acute GvHD grade III/IV (PBSC vs. BM: 28.9% vs. 19.0%, p=0.54) and chronic GvHD (63.0% vs. 56.3%, p=0.75) was comparable between both groups. There was a trend towards increased risk of extensive chronic GvHD following PBSC transplantation (48.1% vs. 25.0%, p=0.2). However, this did not translate into any detectable difference in treatment-related mortality (PBSC vs. BM: 28.9% vs. 26.1 % (p=1.0). With a median follow up of 3.4 years (PBSC) and 10.0 years (BM) overall survival (PBSC vs. BM: 47.5 +/-8.6 % vs. 51.8 +/-10.5 %; p = 0.88) and event-free survival (43.3 +/-8.3 % vs. 51.8 +/-10.5 %; p = 0.60) is without detectable difference between both groups. This result was confirmed in a final multivariate analysis, showing that advanced disease status at transplant is the only significant, independent risk factor for overall mortality (RR 2.4, 95%-CI 1. 1-5.2, p=0.02) . In summary, our data provide evidence that in pediatric recipients of MUD transplantation the use of PBSC instead of BM leads to a faster engraftment and a slightly higher incidence of extensive chronic GvHD. PBSC appears to be a valid alternate stem cell source for pediatric aHSCT from MUDs, as overall survival and event-free survival is comparable when using PBSC and BM.

Woessmann (1) Introduction: Patients with refractory or early relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) have a poor chance to survive. We report on 20 children and adolescents with high risk relapsed or refractory ALCL who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients: We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients who relapsed between December 1991 and April 2003 during (6 patients) or early after first line BFM-type chemotherapy (14 patients) and underwent allogeneic HSCT. CD3 staining of the ALCL was positive in 8 patients and negative in 12. Nine patients received allogeneic HSCT after the first relapse and 11 after multiple relapses. Five patients had received autologous HSCT for an earlier relapse. Eight patients received their transplants from matched sibling donors, 8 from unrelated donors and 4 from haplo-identical family donors. The conditioning regimen was based on TBI in 15 patients. Results: 2 patients relapsed after allogeneic HSCT and died. 3 patients died of transplant related toxicity. Event-free survival at 3 years after allogeneic transplant was 75+10%. There was no influence of CD3 reactivity, donor type or conditioning regimen on outcome. 2/6 patients with progressive disease during frontline therapy survived compared to 13/14 patients with a first relapse after frontline therapy. Two of three patients transplanted with active lymphoma survived diseasefree. All five patients who received allogeneic HSCT for relapse following autologous HSCT survived disease-free. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT is effective and has acceptable toxicity as rescue therapy for high risk ALCL relapses. It even offers cure for patients with ALCL refractory to chemotherapy suggesting a graft-versus-ALCL effect. In the last years, the necessity of regulating the accreditation rules for centres involved in paediatric SCT have been growing in Europe. On June 2005, a questionnaire investigating accreditation rules and activity of transplant centres was distributed to 10 EBMT PDs WP Board Members. Information on 18 European countries (Austria, Czech Rep., Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia Rep., Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, The Netherlands, UK) have been obtained. According to the questionnaire, in all 18 countries is active a National Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Society and in 15/18 (83%) is also active a National Registry collecting data on paediatric SCT. In 12/18 (67%) and in 13/18 (72%) countries have been approved standards for indications on SCT and for accreditation of teams involved in allogeneic SCT, respectively. In 8 out of the 13 (61%) countries where accreditation rules exists, they include a minimal number of allogeneic transplants/year necessary to obtain it. According to the questionnaire, in 7 countries the minimal number is 10 allogeneic transplants and in 1 country is 5. As for the number of both paediatric and combined centres involved in transplantation in children, the results showed that in all investigated countries but Denmark, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden the number of only paediatric teams is higher than the combined ones. Moreover, 30/72 (42%) and 13/40 (32%) only paediatric and combined teams performed >10 allogeneic transplants/year between 1998 and 2002, respectively. The results of the questionnaire give a survey on accreditation rules on the most active European countries involved in Paediatric SCT. This may represent an important tool for the creation of homogeneous rules in all European countries. Aims: Since the short Rapid COJEC induction induces a period of continous aplasia over 70 days, G-CSF was evaluated in a randomised fashion for its capacity to reduce significantly the number of febrile neutropenic episodes and for its potential influence on the stem cell pool with regard to the feasibility and quality of the peripheral stem cell harvest in view of the second MGT /SCT randomisation. Patients and Methods: 239 patients with high risk Neuroblastoma over the age of one have been randomised within the HR-NBL1/ESIOP trial in 16 participating countries. The planned sample size has been reached in terms of completely evaluable patients and the randomization is closed. The data collection and randomisation was managed through a remote data entry system. Results: The comparison of the primary endpoint showed a significant reduction of the mean number of febrile episodes (p=0.015). Patients randomised not to receive G-CSF had an average of 0.34 febrile episodes per cycle compared to 0.26 for patients randomised to the G-CSF arm. G-CSF significantly reduced the incidence of infections with CTC score 2 and 3 (p=0.004), the days in hospital (average reduction by 8 days, p=0.010,) and days on i.v. antibiotics (average reduction by 10 days, p=0.010).",

No deaths occurred in the group randomised not to receive G-CSF; 4 deaths occurred in the G-CSF arm: 3 early tumour related deaths (on days 2, 10, 19) and one death related to a septic shock in an outpatient returning in neutropenia, febrile and miserable. No major differences were seen in the response rates and the PBSC harvest success rate. The subsequent R1-randomisation rate (megatherapy-question) was not influenced by the addition of G-CSF. Conclusion: Based on a significant reduction in mean number of febrile episodes the use of G-CSF is considered. Currently 30% of the patients cannot proceed to MGT randomisation for insufficient response. As G-CSF had a significant positive impact on the general condition, infection rate and haematological toxicities and days in hospital, its use may help to allow to increase induction dose intensity with additional chemotherapy in poor responding patients allowing to increase response and thus the MGT randomisation rate.",

Malik-Gebicka, R. Ryczan, A. Chybicka Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial tumor in children. The tumors show expression of catecholamine synthesis pathway genes (tyrosine hydroxylase -TH) and genes responsible for disialoganglioside production (GD2 synthase -GD2S), which make possible minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment. Another assay used for quantification of micrometastases is the flow cytometric analysis (FCM) of cells with fenotype TAPA-1+/CD45-/CD56+. Material and methods: 17 samples of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) collected for megachemotherapy were assessed. A minor portion of the sample was used for immunological staining and flow cytometric analysis. From the remaining part mRNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed to cDNA which was subsequently tested for presence of transcripts for TH and GD2S. The primers for TH were located in exons that are not affected by alternative splicing. The PCR products were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under a UV lamp. The sensitivity of MRD assays was established in spiking experiments and was shown to be 1 tumor cell (TC) in 10 6 cells in nested PCR for TH, 1 TC in 10 5 in PCR for GD2S, and 1-3 TC in 10 4 cells in flow-cytometric studies (TAPA-1+/CD45-/CD56+). Results: The FCM studies for minimal residual disease were performed in 13 cases and all samples were negative for tumor cells. Minimal residual disease was assessed by PCR in 16 samples of which 3 were positive for GD2S (TH-/GD2S+), 2 for TH (TH+/GD2S-) and 2 for both markers (TH+/GD2S+). The graft contamination was not shown to have the impact on patients survival (log-rank test p =0,39769). Conclusions: The PCR revealed metastatic cells in 41% of PBSC samples. The frequency of graft contamination was similar to other studies. In case of low number of metastatic cells in analysed material the PCR can lead to false negative results due to varying number of HT and GD2S transcript copies in single neuroblastoma cell. The use of 2 different molecular marker assays (GD2S and HT) improved the sensitivity of MRD assessment. Basing on the FCM studies the level of graft contamination of analysed samples was below 1 neuroblastoma cell in 10000 cells. The results are consistent with observations that posttransplant treatment with retinoids efficiently eradicates MRD in neuroblastoma patients.",

Owoc-Lempach, A. Dyla, D. Wojcik, M. Slociak, J. Toporski, A. Chybicka Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) Treatment of children with solid tumors remains unsatisfactory due to high incidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease. Good chemosensitivity of pediatric tumors justifies the use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) as a consolidation therapy. We analaysed the results of ASCT performed in years 1994-2005 in Wroclaw (Poland). Patients: 82 patients underwent megachemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The group consisted of 43 boys and 39 girls. Median age at transplantation was 83 months (range 16-230 months). Diagnoses in analysed group were neuroblastoma (NBL)-43, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)-11, germ-cell tumors (GCT)-6, Ewing sarcoma (EWS)/peripheral primary neuroectodermal tumors (pPNET)-13, Wilms tumors (WT)-3, brain tumors (CNS)-4, and other-2. Stem-cell source were peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in 57 patients, bone marrow (BM) in 13 pts, and PBSC+BM in 12 pts. Graft contained median of 3.6*10 6 CD34 cells/kg BW (range 0.5-21*10 6 CD34cells/kg BW). Conditioning consisted of busulfan+ melphalan in 48 pts, melphalan/ etoposide/ carboplatin (MEC)-15 pts, melphalan-5 pts, melphalan/ etoposide-5 pts, thiotepa/ etoposide/ carboplatin-3 pts, carboplatin/ etoposide/ melphalan (CEM) -2 pts, cyclophosphamide/ thiotepa-2 pts, other-4 pts. Six patients underwent second autologous transplantation (tandem ASCT) with conditioning containing cyclophosphamide/ thiotepa-4 pts or other regimens-2 pts. Two patients received haploidentical transplantation due to primary graft failure (1) or tumor relapse (1) . Results: Neutrophil engraftment defined as a rise above 500/uL occurred at day +12 (range 9-112) and platelet recovery >50 K/uL at day +30 (range 13-408). 28 patients (18 NBL, 5 GCT, 3 EWS, 2 CNS) remain alive and well with a median follow-up of 502 days, in 9 occurred relapse or progression. 45 died of disease or treatment complications with median survival time of 309 days (range 51-2161). Our results discourage the use of megachemotherapy in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas or pPNET tumors (0/13 alive). S209 deliver high doses of radiation to the bone marrow. We have pioneered an approach where we combined this targeted radiotherapy with RIC in patients suffering from non-malignant paediatric diseases with a high comorbidity. Five patients aged 4 to 20 years were transplanted for severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID, n=2), thalassaemia major (n=1), congenital haemolytic anaemia (n=1), and Hyper-IgE-syndrome (n=1). Indications for RIC were pre-existing pulmonary problems due to chronic viral or fungal infections (n=3) and liver cirrhosis/fibrosis (n=2). Donors were MUD (n=3), a matched sibling donor and an HLA-haploidentical family donor, respectively. The antibody used for radioimmunotherapy was the anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 labelled with 90-Yttrium. After favourable dosimetry the antibody was administered on a outpatient basis14 days before SCT. Additional conditioning consisted of fludarabine (140 mg/m\u00b2) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG-Sangstat 10 mg/kg) in all patients, combined with melphalan (70-140 mg/m\u00b2) in 3 patients. Stem cell sources were unmanipulated bone marrow in 2 patients and positively selected blood CD34+ cells in 3 patients (residual T-cell dose 1 x 107/kg in 2 MUD cases, 0.6 x 104/kg in 1 HLAhaploidentical case). GvHD prophylaxis in all but the HLAhaploidentical transplant consisted of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. Favourable dosimetry was achieved in all patients with doses to bone of 16 to 20 Gy and reduced doses to liver (1 to 13 Gy, mean: 5.5 Gy), to kidney (< 3 Gy) and to lung (< 2 Gy). The conditioning was tolerated well with no additional side effect due to radioimmunotherapy. All patients engrafted within expected time periods. One patient rejected the HLAhaploidentical graft but was retransplanted successfully from another HLA-haploidentical donor after intensified chemoconditioning. All patients are alive with full donor chimerism 1 to 7 months after SCT (mean: 4 months). Radioimmunotherapy in combination with RIC is a promising approach for myeloablative conditioning in selected paediatric patients.",

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a well-established treatment modality for children with non malignant diseases. Treatment failures are mostly caused by graft rejection (GR). Increasing mixed haematopoietic chimerism (in-MC) represents an early stage of GR which might be prevented by pre-emptive immunotherapy. Design and Methods. To substantiate this we monitored haematopoietic chimerism after SCT in 56 transplantations performed in 53 children (Acquired and congenital disorders of the hematopoietic system n=31, Immune deficiencies n=8, Adreno-leukodystrophy n=6, Osteopetrosis n=5, Histiocytosis n=3). When in-MC over 30% autologous cells occurred Cyclosporin A (CSA) was withdrawn and/or repetitive donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were performed. Results. During the course of follow up 29/56 were complete chimeras (CC) or MC (0-1%) and 28/29 remained in continuous complete remission (CR). In-MC was found in 19/25 patients. 15/19 received additional immunotherapy by DLI. 11/15 remained in CR, 2/15 are in PR and one patient showed progressive disease.

Aims: to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), the toxicity and the compliance to intravenous (iv) versus oral (os) BUS assumption in children undergoing to pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients and methods: 12 patients (pts), median age 37 (7-177) mos, body weight 6-69 kg, affected by AML (3), ALL (4), NB (3), Thalassemia (2), undergoing to autoSCT (4) or alloSCT (8), received as preparative regimen oral BUS at the dose of 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for a total of 16 doses (6 pts, GR1), or 2 hours i.v. infusion of BUS at the dose of 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours for a total of 16 doses (6 pts, GR2). Four out 6 GR1 pts (7-30 mos) had a nasogastric radiolus to allow BUS assumption. PK studies were performed after the first dose of BUS on blood samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 hours after first administration in GR1 and at 0, 2, 3, 4, 6 hours from the beginning of the first infusion in GR2. BUS plasma level was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography as described by Henner et al. Results: GR were comparable as for age (p= 0.07) and body weight (p= 0.14). Comparison of PK median values (+SD) in GR1 versus GR2 didn't highlighted statistically significant differences as for AUC (p= 0.20), and for T1/2 (p= 0.11). Peak concentration was higher in GR2 (p=0.058). Bioavailability was 0.61. Data are reported in Table I . Variation factor (VF%) were constantly low in GR2. No pt showed acute or late treatment-related extra-medullary toxicity and all pts developed a rapid and sustained hematopoietic recovery. Conclusions: systemic exposure to 0.8 mg/kg iv BUS versus 1 mg/kg oral BUS is overlapping. Low VF% highlight a smaller interpatient variability in exposure compared to oral BUS. Moreover allows to avoid assumption difficulties in younger pts.",

            "text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is treatment of choice in pediatric leukemia with poor prognosis. Allogeneic HSCT is the preferred option if match donors are available. Autologous HSCT is mainly applicable as a consolidation therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Between May 1998 and October 2005 in our center 21 HSCT in children with leukemia were performed. Seven were autologous and 14 allogeneic. Median pts age was 11.5 (4-18) years. The diagnoses were: ALL-9 (1 auto and 8 allo), ANLL -9 (6 auto and 3 allo), MDS -2 allo, CML -1 allo. The donors for allo-HSCT were matched sibling donor (MSD) -8; MRD (parents) -3; haploidentical parents (one antigen mismatch) -1 and full identical unrelated donors -2. Most pts received peripheral blood stem cells. In 1 patient the donor was a 1y9m old sister and bone marrow stem cells were applied. The state of remission before transplantation was: I CR -12, PR or progression -5 and II and III CR -3. The patient with CML was in chronic phase. For autoHSCT the mobilization included Cyclophosphamide -4 g/m\u00b2 and G-CSF -5\u00b5g/kg, and 10\u00b5g/kg G-CSF for 5 days in donors. Median CD34+ cells count transplanted was 4,76x106/kg. The conditioning regimens were: for autologous transplantation: BVC -2, CVD -1 and BC -4; for allogeneic: BC -3, Cy+TBI -2, VP-16+CY+TBI -6, Bu+CY+ATG -1 and Melph+Fludara+ATG -2. GvHD prophylaxis was implemented according to EBMT instructions. Engraftment was achieved in 16 pts, 5 died from graft failure (GF). Median engraftment time for neutrophiles and platelets were 14 an 17 days, respectively. AGvHD Grade I-IV was observed in 9 pts and cGvHD -in 5 pts. The transplant-related mortality (TRM) for autologous setting is 0% and for allogeneic -28.5% (GF and hemorrhagic complications). Median follow-up is 50 months. The 5-year OS and EFS for the whole group are 52, 38% and 71, 43% respectively. For autologous HSCT the OS and EFS are 57, 14% and 42, 86% and for allogeneic HSCT -50% and 85, 71% respectively. Statistically significant prognostic factors for long survival are state of remission before transplantation for all pts and type of donor and the conditioning regimen for allogeneic setting. Conclusion: HSCT in children with high-risk leukemia is safe and successful procedure in most of patients, especially the allogeneic setting and in those with first CR and matched sibling donor.",

CD4+CD25+ T cells uniformly expressed high levels of FOXP3-mRNA (~ 2log > CD4+CD25-cells) suggesting that FOXP3 expression and the frequencies of CD4+CD25+ T cells are strictly correlated. Post-HSCT CD4+CD25+ FOXP3+ T cells failed to proliferate upon polyclonal stimulation, thus resembling Treg cells. However, even CD4+CD25-cells, when stimulated, were induced to express FOXP3 as they converted to a CD4+CD25+ phenotype; and these \"induced\" CD4+CD25+FOXP+ T cells readily proliferated upon stimulation and failed to suppress CD4+CD25-T cells. Conclusions: Because FOXP3 expression appears to reflect the frequency of CD4+CD25+ T cells irrespective of the presence of GvHD and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ populations may also contain recently activated T cells that lack typical Treg characteristics, to clearly define the role of CD4+CD25+ T cells in GvHD, a more extensive approach than simply quantifying FOXP3 expression is required.",

            "text": "Chronic immune activation underlying immunosuppression after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation A. Heitger (1) The time period following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is characterized by profound immunosuppression affecting multiple cell types of the immune system. Continuous immune activation which is known as a mechanism to finally induce immunosuppression, is likely to be present in HSCT recipients as the recovering immune system is exposed to a multitude of antigens, including environmental antigens as well as allogeneic and self-antigens. To this point, we have shown that post-HSCT monocytes when compared to healthy control cells (i) were in a state of sustained activation (enhanced neopterin release in resting cultures) and (ii) superimposed, were highly sensitive to activation by the pro-inflammatory stimulus IFN-g (2-fold higher neopterin release upon exposure to low dose IFN-g). Exposure of post-HSCT monocytes to IFN-g further supported their conversion into suppressor cells by mechanisms that involved upregulation of the activity of the tryptophancatabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (5-fold increased release of the of pro-apoptotic tryptophan metabolite kynurenine of post-HSCT monocytes versus control monocytes). However, while post-HSCT monocytes effectively suppressed proliferative responses of post-HSCT cells, T cell responses from healthy controls remained unaffected. Possibly underlying this susceptibility for impaired proliferative responses post-HSCT T cells showed low levels of T cell receptor (TCR) zeta-chain expression, which as well have been shown to result from prolonged immune activation by IFN-g (Bronstein-Sitton et al, 2003) . Current experiments investigate whether down-regulation of TCR zeta-chain expression directly or indirectly is a result of elevated IDO activity or related phnomena e.g. enhanced arginine metabolism. Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, sustained immune activation affecting cells of lymphocytic ontogeny as well as cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage may effectively contribute to immunosuppression following HSCT. The otherwise pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-g may, by continuous release, activate anti-inflammatory mechanisms to balance a hyper-activated immune system.",

Iori (1) Both CB and BM from volunteer donors represent a stem-cell source for patients with High Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (HR ALL) who lack a family HLA compatible donor. Herein, we report long-term results of a prospective single center study on outcome of 117 patients with HR ALL, aged 1-20 years, for whom the search for an unrelated donor was addressed towards the IBMDR and the Cord Blood Banks worldwide, between April 1995 and July 2005. The close out date for the analysis was November 2005. At the start of the search, 30 patients were in HR I CR, 57 in II, 4 in >III CR , 26 in more advanced phase. A CB unit was found for 89 patients (76%) at a median time of 26 days (range 1-284) from the beginning of the search. A suitable identical BM donor was identified for 45 patients at a median of 90 days (range, 30-365). After a median time of 5 months (range 2-58) from start of search, 52 patients (44%) underwent a transplant: 39 from CB, 12 from a volunteer BM donor and 1 from an haploidentical relative donor. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range 1-112), 38 out of 117 patients are alive (32%) and 79 died. The major cause of death was disease progression occurring prior to transplant in 46 patients at a median of 4 months (range 1-30) from the start of search. For the whole population, the 9 -year probability of OS, relapse and LFS was 24%, 68% and 21%, respectively. By censoring the grafted patients at the time of transplant, the 9-year probability of OS, relapse and LFS were18%, 78% and 13%, respectively. The differences between the actuarial curves between patients censored and not censored at transplant were not statistically significant. Conclusions: the policy of search for an unrelated donor has a positive impact on outcome of young patients with HR ALL, even though a higher number of patients is required to find a significant difference between transplanted and not transplanted patients. Since the risk of death for disease progression in this population is particularly high, ASCT must be performed as soon as possible with either CB or BM stem cells according with the current criteria of donor selection. Recent data suggest that KIR-driven alloreactivity in the transplantation setting might be better predicted if the donor KIR genotype is considered in addition to the HLA genotype of the recipient. The prediction of NK alloreactivity relies on the missing ligand in the recipient, a scenario that can be found in HLA identical and nonidentical allo-transplantations. The goal of this study was to investigate, at a genetic level, the impact of HLA ligand lack in the recipient for the donor KIR on the outcome of HLA identical and non identical transplantation. To this aim, we analyzed the outcome of 17 pediatric patients with different acute hematologic malignancies (NHL n:2, LAM n:6, LLA n:6, LMC n:1, Aplastic Anemia n:1, MDS post LLA n:1), who received marrow unrelated donor transplantation. Donors/recipient pairs were separated into two cathegories, depending on the presence or absence of recipient HLA-C and HLA-Bw4 ligands for donor-inhibitory KIR, in particular for KIR 2DL2-3, KIR 2DL1 and KIR 3DL1. Three patients did not showed any mismatch whereas 14 cases were suitable for the study, showing one or two mismatches. Within this last series, 4 patients (group A: LLA n2, LNH n1, LMC n1) showed only inhibitory genes which missed their relative HLA-CwLys80, HLA-CwAsn80, or HLA-Bw4 ligand, while 10 patients (Group B) were equipped with both activating and inhibitory genes, potentially involved in the genetic mismatching. During a 24 +/-8 months follow-up, all group A patients were alive without evidence of disease relapse, whereas in group B 5 patients died or relapsed (LNH n1, LLA n2, LAM n1, Aplastic Anemia n1). Interestingly, using redirected cytotoxicity assay, while in the group A patients the engagement of the specific KIR involved in the mismatch showed inhibitory function, in two of the group B patients who died/relapsed, we showed the expression of an activating KIR. These results suggest that, in a missing ligand scenario, the presence of a inhibitory KIR may lead to a favourable prognosis, likely supported by a Graft versus Leukemia reaction. On the other hand, when the activating KIR is expressed, a similar favourable effect can not be predicted. This study was supported by a grant from Fondazione Citt\u00e0 della Speranza. AMD3100 is a new CXCR4 antagonist which induces a rapid release of hematopoietic progenitors from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. We conducted a clinical study where patients with multiple myeloma (n=15) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=4)were treated with AMD3100 (A) to increase the number of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) when given an mobilization regimen of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF, G). Since experimental data suggest that A+G-mobilized PBPC are functionally different from G-mobilized PBPC we were interested in an intraindividual comparison of the gene expression profile of CD34+ cells in the two different settings. To this end peripheral blood CD34+ cells of 3 patients (3 G, 3 A+G samples) were isolated by immunomagnetic followed by flow cytometric sorting to a purity of >99%. Differentially expressed genes were analysed by using the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus2.0. The expression analysis was performed with the SAS-MAS 1.0.3 software. We found a pattern of unanimously higher (81 genes, foldchange > 2 0.5 , p<10 -4 ) or lower (29 genes, fold-change > 2 -0.4 , p<10 -4 ) expressed genes in the G+A-mobilized vs. Gmobilized CD34+ PBPC. The significant changes noted in the microarray analysis were validated by representative quantitative real-time PCR of four genes in these three patients and in further four independent patients. Genes were grouped according to gene function. Only increased expression was found in the categories anti-apoptosis (e.g. MPO, HSPA1B), cell cycle (e.g. MS4A3, RRM2), replication/DNA repair (e.g. DNTT RRM2), cell motility (e.g. TNFSF4, HMMR) and oxygen transport. Only decreased expression occurred in the pro-apoptosis gene group (e.g. MDA5 BCL10). A mixed pattern of decreased and increased gene expression was found for the categories transcription, cytoskeleton, immune response, metabolism and signalling. CXCR4 receptor gene expression itself was significantly increased 1.5-fold in the A+G vs. G group. Interestingly also regulating molecules upstream of CXCR4 such as Id1, MYC, CREBP1, CEBP were increased in their expression while molecules downstream of CXCR4, e.g. in the MAP kinase pathway were significantly decreased (EGR1, EGR3) or increased (DUSP1, DUSP6), suggesting activity of feedback loops. We conclude that A+G mobilizes CD34+ PBPC with increased gene expression in categories which potentially promote superior engraftment after myeloablative therapy than Gmobilized CD34+ PBPC.",

Oelschlaegel (1) CAN) A combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 has been shown to be safe and efficient in stem cell mobilization of healthy donors and cancer patients. But, data predicting the efficacy of this approach are still missing. The present study investigated the correlation of the expression of CXCR4 and of adhesion molecules with the kinetics and efficacy of stem cell mobilization in 9 Myeloma patients. Steady-state mobilization was performed using Filgrastim (10\u00b5g/kg/d, 8am) for 4 days followed by AMD3100 (240\u00b5g/kg) on day 4 at 10pm. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) before AMD3100 application (day 4) and PB on day 5 were investigated with 4-color flow cytometry. BM of healthy donors (n=20) served as control. The qualitative and quantitative (MFI) expression of CXCR4 and of certain adhesion molecules were assessed in relation to CD34. The mean percentage of CXCR4 surface expression in healthy BM was significantly higher (87%) than in patients BM (67%; p=0.002), PB before AMD3100 (73%; p=0.050) and on day 5 (29%; p<0.001), whereas cytoplasmic expression was comparable (85%) in all cell compartments. The mean quantitative CXCR4 surface expression was significantly decreased in PB on day 5 compared to all other investigated materials (7 vs. 28; 28; 22; p<0.0156) . Furthermore, the qualitative expression of LFA1 and the quantitative expression of LFA1, PECAM1, VLA4 and CD44 were also downregulated in response to AMD3100 (p<0.010). A median of 63/\u00b5l (range: 15-132/\u00b5l) CD34+ cells was detected in the PB on day 5. Interestingly, the number of CD34+ cells in the PB on day 5 inversely correlated with the qualitative and quantitative CXCR4 expression in the same material (r=0.833; p=0.015). In healthy bone marrow a trend in the opposite direction was observed (r=0.397, p=0.103). Evaluating CXCR4 expression in patients BM and PB before AMD3100 no significant correlation to CD34+ counts could be detected. However, there was one very poor mobilizing patient in whom the quantitative CXCR4 expression in the BM was significantly higher than the median of all patients (MFI 95 vs. 26). Furthermore, some of the adhesion molecules (L-selectin, VLA4, and CD44) showed a rather positive correlation with CD34 count. These preliminary data suggest that the amount of CD34+ cells in the PB after G-CSF plus AMD3100 application seems to be negatively correlated with CXCR-4 expression. A higher quantitative CXCR4 expression in the BM pre AMD3100 might predict a lower mobilization efficacy.",

Liakopoulou Christie Hospital Nhs Trust (Manchester, UK) Etoposide, methyl-prednisolone, cytarabine and cisplatin (ESHAP) is an effective salvage regimen for B cell malignancies. We used ESHAP for patients with myeloma as a mobilising and cytoreductive regimen. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of ESHAP as a mobilisation regimen in patients with myeloma who have been heavily pre-treated or have failed cyclophosphamide mobilisation. Patients and Methods: Between October 2002 to October 2005, 32 patients (M=22, F=10) with myeloma received ESHAP either as mobilisation and cytoreduction regimen (C/M group)or mobilisation regimen alone(Mgroup). Fourteen of 32 (43%) patients received a prior autograft and all patients received one (n=13) or more (n=19) lines of anti-myeloma treatment prior to ESHAP. After ESHAP, patients received G-CSF (5 \u00b5gm/kg) after 1st (M group) or 2nd (C/M group)cycle with a view to achieve a peripheral CD34 predictive count of 50x10 6 /l. Results: 22/32 (69%) patients were evaluable.11/22 (50%) patients had failed a prior cyclophosphamide+GCSF mobilisation. 17/22 (77%) patients, underwent apheresis at a median of 12 days (range 7-18) after G-CSF was commenced. The mean CD34 yield was 5.2x10 6 /kg (range 1.1-8). Of these 12/17 (71%) patients produced >2x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells after the 1st procedure, 4/17 required 2 collections and in 1 patient a 2nd apheresis was not done as there were enough banked cells. A median of 12 days (range 7-18) of G-CSF was administered. The mean predictive peripheral CD 34 count after ESHAP+G-CSF was 66x10 6 /l (range 1-387). In 5/22 (22%) patients the mobilisation was considered a failure as the predictive count was poor. Eleven of 22 patients (50%) patients developed short lived neutropenia and 5/22 (23%) patients required admission for infectious problems (n=2) or metabolic dysfunction (n=3). There were no bleeding episodes and no deaths occurred. Except for mild nausea and vomiting the treatment was generally well tolerated. Conclusions: In 17/22 (77%) patients the CD 34 stem cell yield was satisfactory after ESHAP+G-CSF. Seven of 11(64%) patients who failed a prior cyclophosphamide mobilisation could be successfully remobilised. The treatment was reasonably well tolerated without any major side effects. This mobilisation regimen is effective and safe in both heavily pre-treated patients including those who have undergone previous autologous stem cell transplant and those who have failed to mobilise after cyclophosphamide+G-CSF.",

Jung, J.S. Lee, J.E. Park Ajou University (Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, KOR) Objectives: Survival of patients with high-risk refractory pediatric solid tumors has improved with the introduction of several times of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue. The optimal mobilization schedule for stem cell harvest is an issue of continuous research, since collecting the maximum dose of CD34+ cells once is being proposed in order to reduce the number and complications of apheresis. We undertook a study to investigate whether an increase in the mobilizing dose of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from 5 to 15 mcg per kg per day could lead to a higher CD34+ cell yield. Methods: From March 1996 to June 2005, 41 children underwent PBSC collection in Ajou university hospital, Korea (Group A, 5 mc/kg/day, n = 12; Group B, 10 mcg/kg/day, n = 6; Group C, 15 mcg/kg/day, n = 13). After disease-specific chemotherapy, when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was less than 0.5 * 10 9 /L, once-daily injections of G-CSF (5 mcg/kg/day) were continued to the day when the leukocyte counts were more than 1 * 10 9 /L. Starting on the day until the third day of leukapheresis, G-CSF (5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day) was given. Results: As compared with group A or B, group C induced significantly higher mean number of CD34+ cells collected in the first leukapheresis procedure (6.67 vs. 5.42 vs. 18.67 * 10 6 /kg, P<0.05). Also, as compared with group A or B, group C induced significantly higher mean number of mononuclear cells collected in the first leukapheresis procedure (2.52 vs. 2.62 vs. 7.34 * 10 8 /kg, P<0.05). Toxicity secondary to G-CSF priming was observed in 10 patients (24.4%). There was no significant difference in G-CSF related adverse effects of three groups. None of these patients needed to reduce the dose or discontinue G-CSF due to side-effects. Conclusion: PBSC mobilization with 15 mcg per kg per day of G-CSF is very efficient without serious side-effects due to high-dose G-CSF, for increase of collecting dose of CD34+ cells in most pediatric patients by only one procedure.",

Serrano, C. Martin, C. Fernandez, M. Capote, V. Arqueros, F. Blanco, L. Nevado, C. Herrera, F. Martinez, P. Gomez, A. Torres University Hospital Reina Sofia (Cordoba, E) Introduction: We have previously shown that red cell engraftment occurs before myeloid engraftment after allogeneic Stem cell transplant (Allo-SCT). This prospective study aimed to (I) validate the reticulocyte maturation parameters as predictors of engraftment post allo-SCT and (II) to identify clinics variables than can influence it. Patients and Methods: We included 136 consecutive patients undergoing allo-SCT from January 2000 to April 2005. Stem cell source was bone marrow in 113 (83.1%), umbilical cord in 9 (6.6%) and peripheral blood in 14 (10.2%). Donor type was HLA identical sibling in 83 patients (61%), unrelated HLAidentical in 32 (23.5%) and HLA-mismatched donor 21 (15.4%). Conditioning regimen was myeloablative (with or without RT) in 119 cases (86%). Using peripheral blood samples obtained every other day, we automatically measured: High fluorescence reticulocytes (RETH), Immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF), Mean fluorescence index (MFI) and mean reticulocyte volume (MRV). We considered engraftmente when MFI > 10, RETH > 3%, IRF > 10% and MRV > 110fl. Results: Median myeloid engraftment was 18 days (range 10-48). Red cell engraftment was detected earlier: RETH median was 14.5 days (range 7-43), IRF median was 14 days (range 7-45) and MFI median was 14 days (range 7-43). MRV median was 17 days (range 9-51). This differences reached statistical significance for MFI and IRF (p<0.001, log rank test). Stem cells source had a great impact on reticulocyte engraftment: IRF and MFI median was 15 days for bone marrow, 11 days for mobilized peripheral blood and 25 days for cordon transplantation (p<0.01). Also, ABO disparity negatively influenced red cell engraftment (p 0.03), number of CD34 cells (p <0.01) and donor type (p <0.01) had impact of reticulocyte engraftment, but in the multivariable analyses none parameter remained statistical significance. In a Cox regression analysis, >100 neutrophils and IRF are the only predictive parameters for myeloid engraftment. There were 7 engraftment failures (5.1%). 6 patients received rescue stem cells infusions (1 autologous and 5 allogeneic) between days +36 and +49, with hematopoietic restoration in two of them. Conclusions: After an allo-SCT red cells engraftment occurs aproximately 4 days before myeloid engraftment, the reticulocyte maturation parameters MFI (>10) and IRF (>10%) are the best predictors. This can help us in order to make early clinical decisions.",

Kim, R. Saragosa, N. Jamal, T. Panzerella, V. Gupta, J. Lipton, H. Messner Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto,CAN) Backgrounds: The safety of cryopreserving autografts (PBSCT) has been well investigated, however little is known about the safety and efficacy of cryopreservation in allogeneic PBSCT. We evaluated 1) the viability and engraftment kinetics of cryopreserved PBSCT from volunteer donors, 2) safety profiles of cryopreserved PBSCT infusion, and 3) transplant outcomes. Methods and materials: Total of 83 consecutive patients receiving allogeneic PBSCT from sibling (n=78), family (n=4) or syngeneic donors (n=1) were included in the current study between Sep 2003 and Oct 2005. Myeloablative conditioning was administered to 60 patients (72%), while reducedintensity conditioning was used in 23 patients (28%). G-CSF stimulated PBSC collection were started on D+5. The successful PBSC collection to collect CD34+ cells over 5.0x10 6 /Kg were completed in one (n=72, 87%), two (n=8, 10%) or three consecutive days (n=3, 3%), respectively. PBSCT products were cryopreserved with a TNC concentration below 3 x 10 8 /mL. The cryoprotectant was 10% DMSO. The products were placed in -86\u00baC freezer overnight and moved into the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer for long term storage. The median day between PBSC collection and PBSCT was 14.0 days. Results: The median 2.99x10 10 TNCs/bag were stored in 288 bags with a median volume of 117mL/bag. Overall, the median infused volume of PBSCs and DMSO was 357cc (201 to 709cc) and 36cc (20-71cc) with a median number of 3 bags (2 to 8 bags) per patient. The side effect profiles of 81 evaluated patients are listed in the Table 1 . The median viablity of the thawed product was 72.8\u00b11.5% (range 50 to 98%). The median number of total nucleated cells and CD34+ cells infused were 9.06x108/Kg and 7.08x106/Kg. Among the patients surviving over 1 month, all patients achieved a platelet count of over 20x10 9 /L. Four and thirteen patients failed to achieve a platelet count of over 50 (5%) and 100x10 9 /L (17%). Conclusion: Cryopreserved allogneneic PBSCs are feasible with safe engraftment and minimal complications. The comparason between cryopreserved and fresh PBSCT is now ongoing.",

Material: Between November 1998 and May 2005 one hundred and twenty six children with cancer were qualified to a stem cell collection procedure from peripheral blood. Two or more attempts of the collection procedure were noted in 21 patients. There were 38 girls and 88 boys in this group. Median age was 11 years (range 9 months -21 years).

Methods:126 patients were mobilized using G-CSF in a standard dose of 10-12 ug/kg/day. 260 measurements of CD 34 + cells were performed. The number of CD 34 + was to low to start apheresis procedure in 49 attempts in 23 patients. In the rest of 103 patients (81,7% of whole group) the total of 212 apheresis were performed. Children were divided into two groups: 1. those with successful mobilization and collection n=103 and 2. children which did not achieve enough CD 34+ cells in the peripheral blood enabeling apheresis procedure n=23.

Okamoto (1) It is postulated that hematopoietic stem cells are trafficking in and out through bone marrow microenvironment with various mechanisms even during peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvesting for transplantation. We hypothesized that PBSC could be effectively harvested in second apheresis which was held a few hours after first apheresis in a same day. During study period, 125 apheresis were done in 46 patients or healthy donors who received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 10 microgram/kg/day or 400 microgram/m\u00b2/day for 5 days in order to mobilize PBSC for autologous or allogeneic transplantation. The median age and weight of cases was 9 years (range 1 -45) and 26 kg (range 8 -87). The average time of apheresis procedure and processed blood volume were 185 minutes (range 120 -320) and 183 ml/kg (range 22 -318). The average number of CD34 positive cells per body weight was 6.6 x 10 6 /kg (range 0.25 -70.4). One apheresis on day 5 was enough for transplantation in 3 cases. Of 46, 24 cases underwent two apheresis on day 5 of G-CSF administration. Of these 24, 4 did not require further apheresis. Fifteen required third apheresis on day 6. Five cases required more than two apheresis additionally on day 6 or day 7. Of 46, 19 cases underwent a single apheresis on day 5 with various reasons. Of 19, second apheresis on day 6 was enough for collecting CD34 positive cells for transplant in 12 cases. Six cases underwent second and third apheresis on day 6. Of these 6, 1 required additional apheresis on day 7. One case underwent two apheresis on day 6. In conclusion, in order to harvest enough CD34 positive cells for transplantation, 3, 16, 19, 7, and 1 case required 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 apheresis, respectively. The majority of cases (41/46) completed apheresis in 2 days although the average numbers of apheresis were 2.7. The average number of CD34 positive cells per body weight (kg) collected were 5.0 +/-4.2 (range 0.6 -15.7) and 5.0 +/-3.2 (range 0.6 -11.6) x 10 6 in first and second apheresis in a same day, respectively. These were not different significantly. Doing two apheresis in a day was feasible and made it possible to harvest enough number of CD34 positive cells in a short time of period. Consequently this procedure could lessen the burden of PBSC harvests, namely catheter placement period, the time of hospital admission, in most cases.",

Bogunia-Kubik (1) The interaction between stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 plays a crucial role in homing and mobilization of haematopoietic progenitors. It has been postulated that SDF-1 degradation by granulocyte enzymes activated by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) plays a role in mobilization process. On the other hand, our previous study documented a role of CXCR4 membrane density on CD34+ cells in mobilization suggesting that this process is more complex (Dlubek et al. 2005) . Indeed, a recent study of Benboubker et al. (2001) suggested that the SDF1 gene polymorphism may influence the egress of CD34+ cells to peripheral blood in patients mobilized for autologous transplantation. All they received chemotherapy prior or during mobilization. Therefore, we investigated a putative association between the SDF1 gene polymorphism and mobilization yield in healthy donors receiving G-CSF only. In this setting the analysis was not biased by background disease and chemotherapy. The G-A transition at position 801 in the 3'untranslated region (3'-UTR) within the SDF1 gene and capacity of haematopoietic progenitor cells was analyzed in 49 healthy donors of allogeneic transplants (F/M=22/27; 33 sibling, 15 matched unrelated and 1 haploidentical donor). SDF1-3' UTR genotyping was determined by a PCR-RFLP technique and digestion with MspI restriction enzyme. Among 49 individuals 3, 16 and 30 were carrying SDF1-3'AA (6%), AG (33%) and GG (61%) genotype, respectively. The frequency of CD34+ progenitor cells in the first leukapheresis product was found be significantly higher for donors having SDF1-3'A allele as compared to GG homozygotes (with median values of 0.80% vs 0.53%, p<0.05). These results suggest that SDF1-3'A allele influences the yield of mobilization in healthy individuals receiving G-CSF.

Kodera Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital (Nagoya, JP) We evaluated 123 unrelated bone marrow transplantations for hematological malignancy in our institute between 1995 and 2004 to analyze the effect of HLA mismatch on the outcome. Twelve patients were mismatched at DR locus serologically, 10 at class I allele and 19 at DRB1 allele. Eighty-two patients who received HLA-matched transplantation were used as a control. Sixty-eight patients had high-risk disease, and 55 had standard-risk disease. Conditioning consisted of TBI-based, BU/CY or fludarabine-based regimen. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA+MTX or FK+MTX. Primary graft failure was observed in only one patients with class I allele-mismatched transplantation. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years (range 11 months -9.3 years), overall survival (OS) at five years was 63%, 20%, 43% and 44% among patients mismatched at DR locus serologically, class I and DRB1 allele and matched patients, respectively (Fig 1) . Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 5 years was 38%, 70%, 42% and 48%, respectively. Relapse rate (RR) at 5 years was 0%, 33%, 30% and 18%, respectively. DR serologically-mismatched transplantation resulted in comparable NRM, OS and RR to HLA-matched transplantation (p=0.50, 0.27 and 0.59, respectively). On the other hand, class I allele-mismatched transplantation resulted in higher NRM, worse OS and no better RR than HLAmatched transplantation (p=0.039, 0.0037 and 0.86, respectively). DRB1 allele mismatched transplantation was completely comparable to HLA-matched transplantation, which was already reported in Japanese population. Grade II-IV acute GVHD was significantly higher than matched transplantation (39%) in DR serologically-mismatched (75%) and class I allele-mismatched (75%) transplantation (p=0.021 and 0.0095, respectively) (Fig 2) , although only class I allelemismatched transplantation resulted in higher III-IV acute GVHD (38%, p=0.0055). There were no significant differences as to incidence of chronic GVHD in all groups. In conclusion, DR serologically-mismatched unrelated transplantation might be a good alternative in Japanese population in spite of higher II-IV acute GVHD. However, class I allele-mismatched transplantation might not be a good alternative because of higher III-IV acute GVHD and NRM, although modification with ATG or Campath could improve the outcome.",

Biener, M. Horvath, K. Baumgartner, H.T. Greinix, P. Hoecker University Hospital (Vienna, A) During the last years allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) have been increasingly used as graft source instead of bone marrow. Although the short-term safety profile of rhG-CSF seems acceptable, few data on long-term safety are available. We therefore analyzed results on 163 sibling donors (M/F 92/71) with respect to side effects of rhG-CSF, adverse events of collection and late effects of donation. Influence of rhG-CSF and PBSC donation on quality of life (QoL) and health status were assessed by a questionnaire in a crosssectional study. Written informed consent was signed before PBSC mobilization and collection. Donors had a median age of 40yrs (range 11-72) at PBSC collection. They received rhG-CSF at a dose of 2x5\u00b5g/kg bw/day for 4 days. Routinely, collection was started on day 5 and repeated until at least 4x10E6 CD34+ cells/kg bw recipient were collected, with a maximum of 3 consecutive collections. For follow-up we assessed peripheral blood counts and serum chemistry on days 1,7,30,100,365 after donation and then yearly for 5 yrs. A questionnaire to assess QoL and health status was sent to 112 donors 4 yrs (range 0.6-10.5) after donation. The main adverse events related to rhG-CSF were bone pain (32%), myalgia (31%) and headache (22%). In 73 (45%) donors laboratory tests showed a decrease of platelets during early post-donation period and an increase on day 30. White blood cells decreased within 7 days after donation, returning to normal on day 30. 68/112 (61%) donors responded to the questionnaire and reported a good to very good actual QoL in 46% and 51%, and a good to very good actual health status in 37% and 56%, respectively. 70% and 75% of donors reported that PBSC donation had no influence on QoL and health status, 25% and 23% reported a positive influence. As events since PBSC collection infections (n=7), surgeries (n=10) and new medications (n=13) were reported. Two donors had to be hospitalized within 2 weeks after donation due to severe enteritis (n=1)and subarachnoidal haemorrhage (n=1). The latter never had platelet counts < 100 G/L after PBSC donation and recovered without neurological deficit. Two donors, had died at the time of the survey, one of squamous cell cancer (51 yrs) and one of diabetic renal failure (49 yrs) occurring 6 and 3 months after donation. Thus, PBSC donation is a safe procedure. For assessment of long-term donor safety issues regular follow-up exams should be considered and their results compared with age-matched control groups. Disease relapse or developments of secondary malignancies are possible complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, cases of leukemia originated in the donor cells have been published. The aim of this work is to report the development of donor cell leukemia (DLC) in a 48 year old man, submitted to an allogeneic SCT from HLA identical brother, for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in March 03, 2001. Conditioning was oral busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg. Infused were 3,59 x 108 nucleated bone marrow cells. Methotrexate and cyclosporine were administered for graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxes. A mild acute GvHD occurs and none chronic GvHD. Until day 1279 after SCT, blood exam was normal, bone marrow shows 2% of blasts, analysis of minimal residual disease by cytogenetic and RT-PCR was negative and VNTR analysis of chimerism was compatible with a full chimerism of donor origin. On July 15, 2005, 1584 days after SCT, the patient's peripheral blood revealed pancytopenia.",

The VNTRs D4S43, TH and TPOX discriminated between patient and donor\u00b4s cells formally providing the donor origin of the leukemia relapse. The patient is in remission after induction with classical 7-3 aracytin/daunorrubicin regime and we are considering a second transplant with a different donor whereas the patient has another HLA identical brother. The previous donor is alive and without evidence of leukemia after 4 \u00bd years after donation. In conclusion, cytogenetic analysis combined with molecular techniques are useful to confirm this unusual event. Moreover our case reinforces the importance of defining the donor/recipient origin of leukemia relapse, since a donor lymphocyte infusion strategy doesn't apply for DCL.",

Leiblein, A. Junghans, W. Poenisch, E. Edel, D. Niederwieser, H. Al-Ali University of Leipzig (Leipzig, D) With the increased use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), the age of patients (pts) and, for related hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), of matched related donors (MRD) have increased. We analyzed the impact of donor age on peripheral blood stem cell harvest, engraftment, and donor chimerism. 167 consecutive pts [95 m/72 f; median age 48y] and their MRD [85 m/82 f; median age 47y (18-74)] were studied. 73 (44%) pts were conditioned with 12 Gy TBI/cyclophosphamid 120 mg/kg and 94 (56%) pts received RIC. 65 (39%) MRD were >50y old and 37 (22%) donors >60y. Results: In univariate analysis, donor age had no impact on the duration and amount of G-CSF therapy. In donors <50y, a median of 7.5x107/L CD34+ cells compared to 4.7x107/L in donors >50y were measured before harvest (p<0.0005). Grafts from younger donors contained more CD34+ cells compared to those from older donors [median 9x106/kg and 5.9x106/kg recipient's body weight (RBW) for donors <50y and >50y respectively; p<0.0005]. No difference in CD34+ cells/kg RBW was seen in grafts from donors >60y compared to grafts from donors 50-60y. Median natural killer (NK) cells in harvests from donors >60y and in those from donors <50y were 0.9x106 and 0.6x106/kg RBW respectively (p=0.003). CD3+ cells in the grafts was not donor age dependent. Engraftment occurred at a median of 12 days. Although the type of conditioning regimen, recipient's and donor's age, and CD34+ cells/kg RBW in the graft correlated with speed of engraftment in univariate analysis, only RIC was associated with more rapid engraftment in multivariate analysis (p=0.005). 28 days after HCT, donor chimerism was found with a median of 94%, 77%, and 99% of unsorted bone marrow-, CD3+-, and CD34+-cells, respectively. Recipients of grafts from donors >60y have less unsorted bone marrow-and T-cells of donor origin compared to recipients of grafts from donors <60 y (p=0.002, p=0.02 respectively). Donor's age had no influence on the chimerism of CD34+ cells. Comorbidities and co-medications which were more frequent in donors >50y than younger donors (p=0.003, p<0.0005 respectively) had no impact on the incidence and/or severity of non-hematologic side effects of G-CSF and/or leukapheresis. Conclusions: Adequate PBSC harvest is feasible and safe even in sibling donors >60y. Engraftment was not affected by advanced donor age. The increased number of NK cells in grafts from donors >60 y may contribute to an increased graftversus-tumor effect",

            "text": "The alterations in lymphocyte subset composition induced by G-CSF stimulation of normal stem cell donors are short-lived E. Haastrup, P. Andersen, J. Mikkelsen, H. Brandt, E. Dickmeiss, H. Ullum Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, DK) Stem cells and granulocytes are mobilised to the blood from the bone marrow after stimulation with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Also an increase in the number of T-cells, but not in NK-cells has been reported. Furthermore, G-CSF stimulation is reported to induce changes in the T-cell function towards a T-helper 2 prone response. This study investigated the influence of G-CSF stimulation on the CD4+ T cell subset composition and the NK-cell number in 28 normal allogeneic stemcelldonors stimulated with G-CSF and followed up prospectively at day +30 after the leucapheresis. All stem cell donors >18 years of age who were mobilised with G-CSF in our institution were enrolled in the study. The stimulation regimen was either 10 mg/kg/day for 5-6 days or 16 mg/kg/day for 5 days, for myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning transplantations respectively. Blood samples were collected before the stimulation, at the day of leucapheresis and 30 day after the leucapheresis. As expected there was a significant increase in the concentration of leucocytes and lymphocytes after the stimulation. The concentration of CD4+ T cells increased during stimulation. However, both the concentration and the proportion of CD4+ cells coexpressing CD62L were significantly reduced (p = 0,0006) and this was also found for the proportions of CD4+ cells coexpressing both CD62L and CD54RA (p = 0,002). Also the concentration of CD4+/CD62L+/CD45RA+ T-cells decreased during stimulation in spite of the increased CD4+ count. Similar results was found for the proportion of FAS expressing memory T-cells (CD4+/CD95+/45RO+), that was significantly reduced after the stimulation (p = 0,0001). The concentration of NK cells increased significantly as a consequence of the stimulation. At day 30 after the leucapheresis was the concentration of the CD4+/CD62L+/CD45RA+ cells and of the FAS expressing memory T-cells (CD4+/CD95+/45RO+) still marginally but insignificantly reduced. Likewise had the NK cell count returned to prestimulation values at day 30 after the leucapheresis. Conclusion: The effects on the lymphocyte composition induced by the G-CSF stimulation were short-lived. Samples of mononuclear cells from all the donors have been cryopreserved, and the cytokine production profile after mitogen stimulation of these samples have to be studied to determine if the G-CSF stimulation might induce long lived Tcell alterations of functional significance for the stem cell donor. During 2004, samples were requested for confirmatory HLA typing from a total of 195 Unrelated Donors for 68 patients awaiting HSCT in adult and paediatric centres. The registries used were the ANBMT (32%), NMDP(28%), BBMR(16%), Germany(15%) and WBMR(4%). The remaining 5% donors were requested from miscellaneous non-UK BM registries (France (2), Canada, Taiwan, South Africa, Australia, Cyprus, Italy and Switzerland). Of the donors requested, 28% (n=54) were unavailable or unfit to donate. The rate of unavailability ranged between 0%(WBMR) to 55% (Misc non-UK registries). The gender split of the donors unfit or unavailable to donate was not significantly different to the donors who were available, which suggests that female donors were not more likely to be withdrawn from the register. The male:female split of donors requested was 1.6:1 in the whole group, with the highest ratios observed in requests to the ANBMT (3.5:1) and the German registry (2.3:1). The quality of HLA typing of donors listed was generally good, but an average of 5.0% donors typed locally gave discordant HLA types to that listed. The registries varied in the number of discordant types listed from 0% (WBMR) to 25% (Misc Non-UK Registries). These figures probably reflect that donors were originally listed after HLA typing using serological methods. In general, donors were prioritised from national panels, then US or European panels, before approaching other international registries. In many cases, patients relying upon donors from these other international registries would have unusual allele combinations, or alleles restricted to discrete ethnic groups. The mean age of the donors requested was 34.7 years (+/-2.4 years), but the oldest donors were requested from the Misc non-UK registries (Mean age= 39 years). This may reflect our selection policy of prioritising younger donors from national panels, moving to international registries for more problematic matches. When we compared the number of patients transplanted (n=25) with the number of unrelated donors requested, 7.8 donors were requested, and of these, confirmatory HLA typing was performed on 5.6 donors for each patient transplanted. The highest number of requests and tests per transplant was from the NMDP, where an average of 13.5 donors were requested, and 9.5 donors tested for every patient transplanted with an NMDP donor. No patients were transplanted using donors from the misc. non-UK registries, but four donors were tested.",

            "text": "Introduction: CMV status of the recipient and his donor is one of many factors predicting the outcome of transplantation. Searching for an unrelated donor our department favoures CMV positive volunteers except for CMV negative patients. But with rapidly growing unrelated program in last time we have had a suspicion of higher number of CMV negative donors offered by registries in comparison to our general population. Methods: 144 related and 106 unrelated transplantations performed at our department were analysed regarding the donor/recipient CMV status. Both cohorts were compared according to donor age and gender. Subsequently CMV status of all unrelated donors examined in last two years at the time of confirmatory typing were overlooked by our national registry (CNMDR). Results were compared with CMV status of blood donors at the blood bank collaborating with the CNMDR as its donor center. Results: In the cohort of 144 related transplantations 27 donors (19%) were CMV negative, in the cohort of 106 unrelated transplantations 45 donors (42%) were CMV negative. Median age of family donors was 48 years (range 16-75), median age of unrelated donors was 36 years (range 20-59) (p < 0,0001). Male/female ratio of family and unrelated donors was 83/61 and 85/45 (p=0,2097). Among 527 unrelated donors undergoing confirmatory typing by the CNMDR 296 volunteers (56%) were CMV positive and 231 (44%) were CMV negative. 4 800 blood donors examined at the blood bank collaborating with the CNMDR as a donor center revealed 940 CMV negative (19,6%) blood donors. Conclusions: 1. Our cohort of unrelated donors consists of more than 40% of CMV negative volunteers compared to 20% incidence of CMV negativity in the common population. 2. The reason for more than two times higher CMV negativity in unrelated donors is unclear and can not be explained by age, gender, selective bias during the search and presumably also not by HLA phenotype. 3. Additional analyses aimed at the potential differences in donor's origin, their socioeconomic situation etc are undergoing. Background: Polymorphisms in regulatory sequences of cytokine genes influence their expression and, therefore, the intensity of the immune response. Some of such polymorphisms have been associated with the outcome of stem cell transplantation (SCT), which supports the hypothesis of a genetic predisposition towards certain complications post-transplants. Objective: To evaluate the association between donor (D) and recipient (R) genotype in the IL-6 gene -174G/C SNP polymorphism with the development of complications and survival after SCT. Patients and methods: 23 conventional ablative SCT from HLA identical donors. The IL-6 -174G/C SNP genotypes were determined by PCR, using allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO-PCR) as primers. Logistic regression was applied to identify associations between the analyzed polymorphism and SCT outcome. Results: The frequency of the different genotypes was 50% CC, 33.3% GC and 16,7% GG for Rs, and 54,2% CC, 37.5% GC and 8.3% GG for Ds. 66,7% D/R pairs were matched for the polymorphism and 33.3% mismatched. An association between D/R matching and the development of mixed chimerism (MC), graft rejection, acute GVHD, disease relapse and exitus (Table 1 ) was observed although statistical significance was not reached. However, both groups of patients showed significantly different overall survival ( Figure  1 ) with higher mortality rate in the D/R mismatched group. Although graft rejection was more frequent in the mismatched group, early diagnosis based on chimerism analysis allowed successfully treatment with immunosuppression withdrawal and donor leukocyte infusion. Mortality in the mismatched group was mainly due to transplant related toxicity and disease relapse/progression. Conclusions: The present study suggests an association between D/R matching for the IL-6 gene -174G/C SNP polymorphism and the outcome of HLA identical SCT. The analysis of a larger number of patients as well as further cytokines will eventually allow to confirm these observations and to establish this type of studies as a means for an improved management of transplanted patients.",

Clerici, B. Mazzi, J. Peccatori, M. Bernardi, M.T. Lupo Stanghellini, C. Bonini, K. Fleischhauer, C. Bordignon, F. Ciceri San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, I) The study of hematopoietic chimerism (HC) after T-cell depleted (TCD) myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potential useful marker to predict disease relapse in high risk hematologic malignancies. In this clinical setting the detection of host signal can be assumed as a sensitive and early marker for disease relapse and therefore trigger pre-emptive immunotherapy strategies. However, PCR-STR, the standard method for the HC study, has a low sensitivity for the detection of micro-chimerism. We developed a semiquantitative method for the early detection of mixed chimerism based on studying patient and donor-specific HLA alleles by PCR and reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO) for HLA-A,B,C,DRB,DQB1, and by PCR sequence specific primers (SSP) for HLA-DPB1. These methods are always applicable in HLA-mismatches HSCT. SSO's and SSP's sensitivity are, respectively, 1% and 5%. We monthly analysed 47 TCD-HSCT from alternative donor (25 haplo, 18 MUD, 3 family MM, 1 UCB) for the state of HC in bone marrow samples by HLA-methods and, in parallel, by PCR-STR (total number of analysis: 235). The stage of disease at HSCT was complete remission (42.6%) or advanced disease (57.4%). The median follow-up of HC analysis was 179 days.",

Navarro (1) Hematopoietic chimerism (HC) has proven to be useful for relapse predicition after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in acute leukemia patients. Lineage-specific chimerism in leukemic cells has been used to increase its sensitivity and predictive capacity. Our group has recently described a very sensitive method (10-4) for HC determination based on realtime PCR of indel polymorphisms (indels). This method detected increasing mixed chimerism (MC) about 60 days before relapse. In this work, we examined the role of lineagespecific chimerism, determined by real-time PCR, to anticipate relapse. The study includes twenty-four acute leukemia patients (12 with lymphoid and 12 with myeloid leukemia) followed for a median of 30 months (range: 2-73) after SCT. Cell separation was performed by immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec), targeting CD33 for myeloid and CD19 for lymphoid malignancies. Immediately after separation, DNA from whole peripheral blood and from cell populations was obtained. HC was analyzed at regular intervals by quantitative real-time PCR of indels; nine different polymorphisms were necessary to obtain informativeness in all patients. Seven patients (29%) relapsed. All of them showed previously increasing MC both in whole peripheral blood and in the leukemic lineage. The rise in chimerism was parallel in both types of samples, although a trend to higher percentages of recipient cells was observed in the leukemic population. From 17 non-relapsed cases, 16 showed decreasing MC and finally complete chimerism (CC) a few months after SCT. The remaining patient showed increasing MC on day +42 after transplantation, both in whole blood and in the leukemic lineage.",

Narinski, H. Or, J. Stein, T. Klein, D. Kristt Rabin MC (Petach Tikvah, IL) Since SCT engraftment is dynamic, a realistic picture of patient status should depict the current sample's chimerism (Ch) results in relation to all previous levels. Fortunately, software for routine display of sequential Ch levels is available. However, for sequential monitoring to be technically feasible, platform variation needs to be lower than the biological fluctuation in the graft occurring between samples. In this study, the longitudinal performance of a multiplex STR-PCR platform was evaluated. Since a sample's results represent the mean of Ch estimates from individual marker loci, these loci values were evaluated for accuracy (%true), precision (in replications), sensitivity, and STR size estimation. Known Ch values in artificial DNA mixtures and in a simulated chimerism model, based on normal DNA, were used to determine sample mean, deviation of individual locus estimates from the mean, and sample variance. This variance level was compared to clinical samples where true Ch values are unknown. For all marker loci, accuracy was 88-100%; precision, 92-100%, mean deviation, 2-4%. STRs were sized precisely; an important property for repeated examinations on the same samples. Sensitivity was 2-5%. In conclusion, despite variability across samples and marker loci, mean % Ch closely approximates the known Ch level in models. Therefore, using \u2265 3 markers /sample provides a reliable mean value if the variance is low, enabling long-term tracking of a patient's chimeric status. Routine display of all sequential results maximizes the value of long term tracking for clinical decision making, and is trivially feasible using ChimerTrack software [Leukemia 2004,18:909] .",

Dickmeiss University Hospital Copenhagen (Copenhagen, DK) The study comprised 28 patients with haematologic malignant disease who were transplanted with major AB0-incompatible grafts. In 22 of 28 patients the AB0 type was 0 prior to transplantation. A sensitive indirect antihuman globulin method was performed in gel cards to assess the anti-A and -B titers in the patients. Anti-A and -B titer range was 1-2048, median 64 prior to transplantation, titers that are concordant to titers of a normal donor population. Titer ranges of anti-A and -B on day 30 and 90 were 0-128 and 0-64, respectively, medians 2 and 0. The range of reticulocyte concentration was 2 -310 mia/L (median 50) at day 30, and at day 90, 2 -204 mia/L (median 64). Among 21 patients having an antibody titer (ab titer) \u2264 128 prior to transplantation, 17 had reticulocyte concentration >20 mia/L at day 30. Six of seven patients with ab titer >128 prior to transplantation had reticulocyte concentrations <20 mia/L, indicating a correlation of low initial ab titer to red blood cell engraftment at day 30 (Fishers exact test; p<0,007). 20 of 21 patients with ab titer \u2264 128 prior to transplantation had a reticulocyte concentration \u2265 20 mia/L at day 90, four of 7 patients having antibody titer >128, had a reticulocyte concentration <20 mia/L (Fisher exact test; p<0,0154). Titer determinations after transplantation indicated that reticulocyte take were rarely seen until the titer had fallen to \u2264 4. Five patients had a titer of >4 at day 90, and only the one with the lowest titer (8) had a reticulocyte take. The present study also included ten patients who were transplanted with an AB0 minor mismatched graft. Upcoming donor derived antibodies were not detected in these patients neither at day 30 nor at 90. Ab titers in the donors ranged from 0 -1024 (median 128). Conclusion: The titer of the antibodies reactive with the donor AB0 type in the recipient prior to transplantation in major AB0incompatible stem cell transplantation is a predictor of the time to reticulocyte take after transplantation. Reticulocyte take is only seen when the titer of the incompatible antibody after the transplantation has fallen to a very low level. The threshold with the sensitive technique used in the present study was a titer of 1:4.",

Cho Catholic University of Korea (Seoul, KOR) Objectives: Several groups have reported successful cases of non-T-cell-depleted stem cell transplantation (SCT) from HLAhaploidentical family members based on feto-maternal microchimerism, but the interpretation of studies requires consideration of the technique used, which is especially important because microchimerism is a low-frequency event and there are no standardized methods yet. Methods: Given the limited specificity of the typing using nested polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP), we sequenced the final products that were suspected to be non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMAs) in two adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Both cases were relapsed patients undergoing haplotypemismatched peripheral blood SCT. We performed nested PCR-SSP for HLA-A to detect potential microchimeric materials, i.e., the NIMAs (HLA-A*0101 and HLA-A*0201 for the offspring in Cases 1 and 2, respectively) before SCT. We isolated genomic DNA from the recipients' and donors' peripheral blood samples. We first amplified the DNA samples with a generic HLA-A locus-specific primer pair and followed by a second amplification with an HLA-A*01-specific primer pair for Case 1 and an HLA-A*0201-specific primer pair for Case 2. The templates consisted of 100 ng of the patient's genomic DNA, and then a 10\u00b2-fold dilution of the first PCR products in double distilled water. We diluted the final products from 10 1 -fold to 10 10 -fold and then sequenced the final PCR products of the potential NIMAs. Results: In each case, the offspring appeared to possess a potential NIMA based on the nested PCR reactions, but sequencing revealed that both products were inherited maternal antigens (IMAs) (HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*24, respectively). Conclusion: The nested PCR method, however, is prone to contamination and PCR artifacts, especially when using nested primers. Moreover, we demonstrated that the microchimeric materials detected using nested PCR-SSP could actually be nonspecifically amplified IMA, by using nucleotide sequencing. This work raises a question about the feasibility of using this technique for detecting feto-maternal microchimerism.",

Klein Rabin MC (Petach Tikvah, IL) A common platform for chimerism testing is based on multiplex STR-PCR. Results from this platform reflect variability during preparation, amplification, and uncalibrated product detection. Nonetheless, these measurements of relative DNA quantity are then used to estimate % chimerism (Ch). Using multiplex PCR, measurements from each locus provide an estimate of % Ch. These are averaged, giving the reported sample mean. Not all loci necessarily provide reliable estimates. The question is how to detect these aberrant performing loci. To assess relative performance at a locus systematically we derived two novel quantitative parameters based on theoretical numerical relationships between measurements in a locus. One parameter reflects the asymmetry in measurements between alleles [independent of chimerism level], referred to as: DNA measurement differential, DMD. When DMD<1.0, the locus's % Ch is <5% deviant from the optimal %ch estimate, and can be considered reliable. The detection level parameter, DLx indicates the signal amplitude relative to the Genescan threshold setting, at an anticipated sensitivity of x%. When DLx <1.0 the locus will not detect an x% minor component. This is particularly important for estimates of 0 and 100 % Ch. Using an Excel spreadsheet one can simultaneously compute and display % Ch, DMD and DLx from the same DNA measurement data. In conclusion, this approach affords for the first time a basis to compare the reliability of results between a patient's samples. This aids in insuring that changes in the patient's chimeric status reflect biologically significant alternations, and not merely platform error levels. These QC procedures are supported by a modified version of ChimerTrack (Leukemia 2004; 18:909) .",

Methods: Autologous transplantation of bone marrow stem cells was performed in 56 patients. In 47 patients ABMSC were injected intracoronary during coronary angiography. Intramyocardial delivery was used in 7 patients as adjunctive therapy to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and in 2 patients -intracoronary during angioplasty. Each patient received 510 \u00b1 120mln nuclear-containing cells, among them 140 \u00b1 50mln mononuclear cells and 1,6 \u00b1 0,7mln CD34+ cells. Results: Patients were followed for 3-18 months.

Interim analysis of a doubleblind randomised phase II clinical trial P. Iacopino (1) , G. Pucci (1) Recent studies suggest that bone marrow-derived progenitor cells induce both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in experimental models of myocardial infarction (MI). Implantation of autologous bone marrow stem cells (SC) into the infarcted myocardium is a novel therapeutic approach to repair heart damage and restore myocardial function after acute MI. We analyzed the expression of some humoral factors and the trafficking of early and late endothelial progenitor cells in a setting of MI patients who underwent intramyocardial injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMC) according to a double-blind randomized phase-II clinical trial. Between March 2004 and September 2005, a total of 29 patients who had suffered from acute transmural MI less than 6 months before admission, were recruited for the study. The patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BMMC or placebo implantation plus conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Serial samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum and plasma were collected to evaluate circulating SC subset-populations and to examine factors potentially involved in the homing and retention of SC in the myocardium. No major perioperative complications were observed. One patient died of non-transplantation related cause four months after CABG. The number of circulating hematological CD34+ cells coexpressing either CD133 or CD117, early CD34+/VEGFR-2+ and late CD34+/CD31+ endothelial cell subsets, circulating mononuclear cells, expressing ICAM-1 and E-selectine antigens, increased at different time points going back to baseline value. In addition, other humoral factors, such as VEGF-2 and SDF-1 alpha, were quickly upregulated after bypass surgery. From our experience certain interim conclusions can be drawn. One, adjunctive bone marrow-derived cell implantation at the time of bypass surgery appears to be feasible and safe. The second conclusion is that both cell implantation and placebo infusion in CABG patients could regulate endothelial progenitor cell mobilization and angiogenic/homing factors which might act to recruit circulating SC to the ischemic heart. Of interest, only few cases showed no substantial modification of either progenitors trafficking or cytokine/chemokine levels. However, we are not able to provide any definitive conclusion on the association between biological results and clinical outcome since this study is still blinded.

However, significant amount of fundamental questions remains completely unanswered. In this work, we tried to: (1) develop a pig model of myocardial infarction (MI) by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery via a balloon catheter; (2) estimate an optimal timing for mononuclear cells (MNC) delivery by studying the myocardial tissue in various time intervals after MI, using a classical microscopy, and DNA-micro arrays technology; (3) develop a methodology for MNC visualization in myocardial tissue by iron-based staining (colloidal iron, Resovist, with or without poly-l-lysine), and immunofluorescence -based staining (fluorescent probe CMFDA); and finally (4) analyze whether MNC could be delivered by continuous intracoronary infusion of cells instead of classical interrupted balloon inflation-deflation techniques and repeated boluses. The latter approach can increase the safety of the intracoronary cell transplantation by avoiding the risk of repeat balloon inflations at the site of stent. Results: Maximum changes in gene expressions occurred between the days 3-5 after MI. The most prominent down-, or up-regulated genes were those involved in muscle contraction and oxidative energy metabolism, or extra cellular matrix constituents, respectively. Dynamics of MI healing in this pig model of acute ischemia seems to be significantly accelerated when compared with the published data seen in human pathology. None from the extensive amount of ironlabelling experiments resulted in acceptable labelling of most mononuclear cells. On the other hand, however, CMFDA labeling is very easy and reliable. Surprisingly and importantly, the retention of MNC was the same regardless of whether they are administered by repeated boluses or by continuous infusion. The cells homed predominantly in the areas adjacent to the central MI necrosis and not in the non-ischemic tissue. The amount of cells trapped in the infracted myocardium increases with the delivered dose and decreases with the time from infusion. Conclusion: It seems that BM-derived MNC can be effectively administered not only by method of interrupted catheter balloon occlusions and repeated boluses, but also via continuous intra-coronary infusion. The clinical trial is under preparation. The optimal infusion timing in humans remains to be established.",

Schots (1) Homing of stem cells to injured tissue is a prerequisite condition to contribute to local tissue repair. Stem cell homing in chronically failing myocardium is poorly understood. We conducted a pilot clinical trial to investigate homing of CD133+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after intracoronary injection in 8 patients (pts) (median age 53 yrs, range: 50-72) with chronic ischemic heart disease (CIHD) (NYHA class I-II) after acute myocardial infarction (> 12 mths) and with at least one native coronary artery which could be injected. PBSC were mobilized with G-CSF and collected by apheresis on d-1. On d0, CD133+ cells were purified to a median of 89% purity (range: 79-97%) by immunomagnetic method (CliniMACS, Multenyi), labeled with 111Indium (1MBq/10 6 cells) and injected during a coronary catheterisation procedure through a balloon catheter. After a first cohort of 3 patients injected with a lower dose (5-10x10 6 ) of cells, our final protocol was applied in 5 patients in whom an average of 34.4x10 6 (range: 18.6-49.4) of CD133+ selected cells, was injected. The radioactivity at the level of the heart was evaluated with a dual head gamma camera. In the 5 patients receiving the higher doses, a clear residual radioactivity was observed at the level of the heart at 1-2, 12 and 36 hours after injection. A detailed biodistribution study in 2 patients showed 6.9-8.0% after 1-2 hours and 2.3-3.2% after 12 hours residual radioactivity (with decay correction) at the heart expressed as a percentage of total body initial radioactivity. Using PETscan, we could not detect any significant increase in metabolic activity in the injected cardiac regions. On the other hand, MRI showed a significant improvement in the overall left ventricular ejection fraction as early as 5-6 weeks after injection in 3 of the 4 patients evaluated. No adverse events were observed during the procedure and up to 3 months follow-up. There was 1 case of sustained ventricular tachyarrythmia requiring cardiac pacing at 4 months and 1 progressive coronary stenosis requiring angioplasty at 3 months after procedure. Conclusions: 1) a significant amount of CD133+ PBSC home to the heart after intracoronary injection, 2) these data are useful for the design of trials to evaluate the tissue repair potential of CD133+ PBSC in the setting of CIHD.",

Lozano University Hospital of Salamanca (Salamanca, E) Background: Critical limb ischemia is a severe clinical manifestation of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and can lead to amputation if revascularization is not performed. Cellular therapy as strategy to repair damaged tissues is promising in the area of the critical limb ischemia, mainly in those cases that exists contraindication for surgery. In the present study the safety and feasibility of autologous peripheral blood CD133+Stem Cells (CD133+SCs) implantation after G-CSF mobilization was investigated in patients with critical limb ischemia of lower extremities. Methods and Results: Three patients with atherosclerosis obliterans were enrolled. After administration of 5 mg/kg/12 hours of G-CSF by subcutaneous injection for 4 days peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested using a CobeSpectra cell separator. The median total mononuclear cells harvest was 90.2x109. The leukapheresis harvest was processed by immunogenetic cell separation using CliniMACS System (CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec) to enrich for CD133+ cells. The CD133+SCs were injected into the gastrocnemius muscle under epidural anaesthesia. The median CD133+SCs injected were 1.2x106/kg. No serious adverse events related to G-CSF, harvest or implantation were observed. After 17 months of follow-up the first patient enrolled shown limb salvage, symptomatic relief and functional improvement. Second patient a decrease of pain has been observed after 3 months. Beside, we have observed the appearance of the right peroneous artery that it was blockage before the procedure in the magnetic resonance. Conclusion: Implantation of CD133+SCs collected after G-CSF administration could be an alternative to therapy angioplasty in patients with critical limb ischemia of lower extremities.

Median follow-up after SCT was 2.03 years with range from 0.02 to 17.16 years. Median survival was not reached, 20(6.3%) pat have died due to progression of disease and 107(33.8%) of deaths were transplant-related. Over time significant increase in patients\u00b4 age (p=0.041) and in use of graft from unrelated donors and peripheral blood (p<0.0001) was confirmed. Also, as time passed significantly more pat were transplanted earlier than one year after diagnosis (p<0.0001) and in more pat reduced intensity conditioning or TBI was used (p=0.002 and 0.019). Factors significantly associated with inferior survival after SCT were: accelerated or blastic phase of CML (p<0.0001), interval from diagnosis to SCT longer than one or two years (p=0.006 and 0.002), use of mismatched related donor (p<0.0001) and rising EBMT prognostic score (p<0.0001). Improved survival was observed in pat without aGvHD or with aGvHD gr.I-II in comparison with gr.III-IV (p<0.0001) and in pat with cGvHD (p<0.0001) despite the negative impact of extensive cGvHD (p=0.0003). In Cox multivariate analysis EBMT prognostic score, phase of disease, year of SCT and presence of chronic GvHD were the best predictors of the outcome.",

Bi20 is able to mediate cell killing and phagocytosis of the tumor cells by T cells and accessory cells. Bi20 was applied in escalating doses from 10 \u00b5g up to 640 \u00b5g and followed by DLT (1 x 107/kg body weight). Patient 2 and 3 received repeated courses of antibody and DLT. Results: In all cases we observed a prompt, dose-dependent decrease of B-CLL cells in the peripheral blood, which already started hours after application of the antibody infusion. Furthermore, in all cases the reduction of the enlarged lymph nodes and spleen went along with a significant improvement of the clinical symptoms like night sweat. Clinically, side effects were restricted to fever, chill and bone pain that could be easily controlled. These effects peaked at a concentration of 80\u00b5g and did not increase or even decreased at higher concentrations. The cytokine profile was characterized by a transient increase of IL-6, IL-12 and IL-10. With respect to the transaminases, only a transient and modest increase of gammaGT was observed. HAMAs (human anti mouse antibodies) were not detectable; the absence allowed repeated transfusions of the trifunctional antibodies. Moreover, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was not observed. Unfortunately relapse of the disease occurred in all cases. In two cases repeated application of Bi20 and T-cells induced a repeated response. The overall survival was 47, 151 and 196 days. Conclusion: Bi20 can induce a prompt anti tumor response in B-CLL patients with a p53 mutation. The toxicity of treatment is not severe. However the response is of short duration and further studies are necessary to improve the outcome of patients by e.g. optimizing the application schedule.",

Olavarria, J.F. Apperley Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) Aim: In order to investigate the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation after Imatinib prior to conditioning we analysed retrospectively the engraftment rate, incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD and cGvHD) and transplant related mortality (TRM) in adult patients (pts.) with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), who received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from sibling (SIB) or volunteer unrelated donors (VUD). Patients: 37 pts. (23 male, 14 female; median age 31 y, range 16-55) were treated with SIB (n=6) or VUD (n=31) allogeneic SCT (n=11) or BMT (n=26) for CML in first chronic (CP1, n=13) or accelerated phase (AP, n=17)or for more advanced disease stages: second chronic phase or blast crisis (CP2 or BC, n=7). Transplant conditioning consisted of fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) in all pts. All but one recipients of VUD transplants received in vivo T-cell depletion (TCD) with CAMPATH 1H (Anti CD52, n=29) or ATG (n=1). In all pts. GvHD prophylaxis was provided by Cyclosporin A and short-term methotrexate. Results: 7 pts. received Imatinib for treatment of BC, 30 pts. with the aim to achieve haematological or cytogentic remission in CP1 or AP. The median duration of Imatinib pretreatment was 8.5 months (range 1-31 months). The used drug dose ranged from 200mg to 800mg. Imatinib was discontinued within 8 weeks prior transplant in 26 pts. 11 pts. had a longer than 8 weeks break between Imatinib and BMT or PBSCT. Engraftment failure occurred in 1 patient (2.7%). The probability of TRM at day 100 was 13%, which increased to 38% at 1 year. aGvHD grade III-IV occured in 8 pts (22%), whilst extensive cGvHD was seen in 10 pts (31%). The overall survival is 65% after a median follow up of 203 days (14-1419 days). Conclusion: In 37 pts. treated with Imatinib prior to allogeneic SCT or BMT the overall rates for engraftment failure, TRM, aGvHD and cGvHD were comparable with previously published data in BMT or SCT in CML without Imatinib pretreatment and with our institution's experience prior to the Imatinib era. Imatinib prior to allogeneic transplantation does not seem to have a negative impact on the tranplantation outcome. Further investigations on larger cohorts are needed in this field.",

Median age was 36 years; 56 were in 1st CP, 17 in AP and 6 in BP. Preparative regimens were TBI based (10 Gy, single dose, low dose rate from a Co60 source) in 35 and Busulfan based (oral formulation, untargeted, 16 mg/kg total dose) in 44. GVHD prophylaxis consinsted of CsA (28) or CsA+MTX (51). Bone marrow was the source of stem cells in all cases. Relapse occurred in 11 patients, resulting in 17.8% probability at 10 years. It was strongly correlated with phase at transplant (8.5% for 1st CP, 32.5% for AP and 60% for BP). Median times to relapse were 80 months for 1 st CP, 52 for AP and5 months for BP. Only two very late relapses occurred, at 135 (AP) and 137(1st CP) months. Of the 11 relapsed patients, 5 had had grade I acute GVHD; 9/11 did not have cGVHD and 2/11 had de-novo cGVHD. Out of 26 patient who developed cGVHD 2 relapsed, while 9/37 without cGVHD relapsed (p=0.08). 7 patients relapsed in advanced phase and died (3/3 of those transplanted in BP, 2/4 of those in AP and 2/4 of those in 1st CP). The 4 surviving patients, on the contrary, relapsed in CP and have achieved a II CR after therapy with IFN (1) or Glivec (3). These findings indicate that relapses are very rare, when the transplant is performed in 1st CP with a myeloablative regimen, even after a very prolonged observation. Nonetheless, very late relapses may occurr.",

Disease at time of treatment with Imatinib was in chronic phase in 21 patients and blastic phase in five. Median S228 time from graft to relapse was 8 months (3-80) and from relapse to Imatinib was 15 months . Ten patients had previously received DLI, fourthteen interferon. Only six patients had no treatment prior to Imatinib. Result: 20 patients are alive and 6 died of relapse. The majority of patients in chronic phase (20/21) are alive.The response rate for CHR, CCR and MCR was respectively for patient in hematologic relapse (20%/40%/40%), for patients in cytogenetic relapse (-/27%/45% ) and for patients in molecular relapse (-/-/100%). Imatinib was well tolerated, only two GVH reactivation observed but 8 patients (42%) experienced cytopenia that required transient arrest or dose adjustment, and two grade IV toxicity (muscle cramps, cardiomyopathy). Six patients have stopped Imatinib (1 hepatitis, 1 toxicity, 4 molecular remission). Four of these patients experienced relapse (1 hematological, 3 molecular).

Moreover, due to their immunomodulating capacities these agents are discussed to possibly influence acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Therefore the EBMT CLWP performed a survey on the use of antibodies after allo-SCT for CLL by sending an initial request to all EBMT centers. 13 of 41 responding centers indicated experience with moab in this situation and received a second questionaire asking for details. Altogether, 18 patients were identified, 17 treated with rituximab and 1 with alemtuzumab. In all cases, indication for moab treatment was progressive disease. Median age was 49 (38-64) years. Reduced-intensity conditioning had been used in 83% of the cases. 67% were grafted from an HLA-identical sibling and 33% from alternative donors. The median time from allo-SCT to moab administration was 13 (1-37) months. In 33%, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were administered together with moab, and 22% received chemotherapy in addition to moab. Overall response rate was 50% with 22% complete remissions, translating into a median overall survival of 30 months from moab administration. GVHD improved in 2 of 6 patients at risk.

Relapse is the major cause of treatment failure. Imatinib mesylate (IM), a drug that inhibits the Abl tyrosine kinase and thus blocks the proliferation of CML cell lines and clonogenic CML progenitor cells, is a new treatment for these patients with CML in relapse after allo-SCT. Materials and Methods: From November 1995 to October 2005, we have studied twelve transplanted patients (pts) treated with IM after relapse. Eleven pts were in chronic phase at the moment of the allograft. Nine pts received HLA-sibling transplantation and 3 HLA-mismatched. Prior IM, seven pts received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after relapse while 5 pts did not receive it because severe acute or chronic graft versus host disease. Their median age was 27 years old (range: 6-49) being 9 male and 3 female. Median time between allo-SCT and relapse was 24 months (range: 2-79). At the moment of IM therapy, disease status was respectively 3 pts in molecular relapse, 5 in cytogenetic relapse and four in haematological relapse. IM was administered at a dose of 400 mg daily. Definition of CML response was according IBMTR. Bcr-abl and chimerism were monitored using real-time quantitative PCR. Results: With a median therapy time of 25 months (range: 6-41), all the patients achieved complete molecular remission. Concerning chimerism, 7 pts (58%) showed full donor chimerism, 3 pts (25%) mixed chimerism and 2 (17%) autologous recovery. At a median follow-up of 52 months (range: 30-116), 12 pts (100%) remain in molecular remission. Conclusions: 1) IM is a highly effective option to induce molecular remission in patients with CML relapsed after allo-SCT. 2) IM is able to reestablish the full donor chimerism in an important percentage of patients. 3) The response is rapid and complete restoration of donor-type haematopoiesis was achieved after 6 months of therapy. 4) IM can be a very good alternative to DLI when this procedure can not be administered or it is ineffective.",

Di Carlo, P. Olioso, G. Papalinetti, P. Di Bartolomeo Ospedale Civile (Pescara, I) In this study we report the results of stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 83 patients (M 45, F 38) with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) transplanted from HLA identical sibling between May 1982 and February 2005. The median age was 34 years (4-53). At time of SCT, 75 patients were in CP, 6 in AP and 2 in BC. The median interval from diagnosis to SCT was 8 months (2-76). The median EBMT transplant score was 2. The stem cell source was bone marrow for 75 patients (median nucleated cell dose 3.0 x 108/Kg) and PBSC for 8 patients (median CD34+ cell dose 5.8 x 106/Kg). The conditioning therapy was cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) for 24 patients and busulphan (BU) and CY for 59 patients. For GvHD prophylaxis, 17 patients received CYA alone and 63 were given CYA and short course MTX. The median time to achieve 0.5x109/L neutrophils and 50x109/L platelets was 20 (10-37) and 21 (11-99) days respectively. Acute GvHD grade II-IV occurred in 21%. The combination CSA-MTX and a dose of nucleated cells > 3.0 x 108/Kg were associated with a lower significative incidence of acute GvHD. Chronic GvHD occurred in 32% (extensive in 17%). Transplant related mortality (TRM) was 19%, 24% and 25% at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. In univariate analisys the patient age <35 years, the interval from diagnosis to SCT < 12 months, the BU-CY regimen and a marrow cell dose >3.0 x 108/Kg were associated with a lower TRM. Fourteen patients transplanted in CP and 3 patients transplanted in more advanced phase relapsed (7 in CP, 1 in AP and 9 in BC) after a median time of 711 (160-1657) days. Leukemia relapse was associated with a minor incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD. Eleven patients (8 in 2nd CP, 1 in AP, 2 in BC) underwent a second SCT after a median interval from the 1st and 2nd SCT of 29 (9-246) months. Six of them are living and cured and 1 is living under imatinib therapy. After a median follow-up of 8.2 (0.7-22.8) years, the 20 years probability of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 64% and 58% respectively for 75 patients transplanted in CP and 50% and 38% for 8 patients transplanted in AP and BC. In univariate analysis the patient age <35 years, the interval from diagnosis to SCT < 12 months, the BU-CY regimen and the year of SCT were associated with a better OS and DFS. We conclude that SCT is a curative treatment for patients with CML, in particular in young recipients treated with BU-CY regimen, CSA-MTX prophylaxis and high marrow cell dose.",

Chidley, J. Burthem, J.A. Liu Yin, G.S. Lucas Manchester Royal Infirmary (Manchester, UK) Patients diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) often undergo leukapheresis at presentation. This cryopreserved \"rainy day harvest\" has enabled patients to receive an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) as a palliative measure at time of transformation or for those ineligible for allogeneic SCT. Since its licence in September 2001 (UK), imatinib mesylate (IM) has become standard treatment for most patients with CML. Consequently, autologous SCT has declined which warrants a review of current practice. Here we critically assess this and compare data from before and after IM licence. From 1989 to present a total of 264 patients with CML were seen at Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK, of which 160 (60%) underwent leukapheresis at time of presentation. From January 1989 to September 2001, 68 (35%) of 196 patients were treated with an allogeneic SCT and a total of 18 autologous SCT were performed in 16 patients. Of those, 12 procedures were from presentation leukapheresis stem cells. The median overall survival (OS) of those patients was 16 months (range <1-71 months). From October 2001 to present, 15 (22%) of 68 patients underwent allogeneic SCT and only 2 patients received an autologous SCT. In both cases presentation leukapheresis was used to salvage relapse post allogeneic SCT where IM resistance was observed. Here, the median OS was 5.5 months (<1-11 months). 77 patients died with no use having been made of their leukapheresis collection. In summary, most patients presenting with chronic phase CML undergo leukapheresis at our centre but only a minority of these patients subsequently proceed to an autologous SCT. The value of a presentation leukapheresis collection must therefore be increasingly questioned. The alternative approach of stem cell collection after IM-induced cytogenetic remission is variably successful and unlikely to replace presentation leukapheresis for most patients.",

Guman, N. \u0160tecova, M. Fricova, J. Rosocha Faculty Hospital L.Pasteura (Kosice, SVK) Objective: Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is effective in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, most patients treated with 400 mg imatinib daily have variable levels of residual molecular disease. Unfortunately, the optimal long-term management of patients (pts) who achieve complete cytogenetic response (CCR) after imatinib is unknown. Therefore it may be prudent to collect autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) in CCR pts treated with imatinib with low levels of detectable leukemia analyzed by molecular tests. Methods: In 14 chronic phase-CML patients (6 men and 8 woman) who responded to imatinib (CCR), PBSC mobilization was performed using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, Neupogen) at a daily dose of 10mg/kg by subcutaneous injections until the harvest was completed. Imatinib administration continued during the mobilization and collection at previously established dose (400mg once daily) in 4 pts (group A) and in 10 pts imatinib was witheld one month prior to PBSC colection (group B). PBPC collection was started upon CD 34+ cells >10x106/kg and was stopped after achievement of the target cell dose. Collected PBSC were cryopreserved with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen (-196\u00baC) . Adverse events and the amount of BCR-ABL transcripts in peripheral blood were evaluated before mobilization and in collected cells by RT-PCR (LlightCycler) . Results: Our data demonstrated that the target CD 34+ cells yields of > 2,0x106/kg was attained with G-CSF in 2/4 (50%) pts group A during interrupted Glivec therapy and in 8/10 (80%) when Glivec was temporarily interrupted (group B). Eleven pts were evaluated on PBSC for BCR-ABL by RT-PCR. The median of relative concetration of BCR-ABL transcripts before apheresis was 0,001% (< 0.001%-0,12%) in group B vs < 0.008% (< 0.001%-0,021%) in group A, respectively. The median concentration of BCR-ABL transcripts in collected cells was < 0.002% (<0.001%-0.003%) in group A vs <0.001% (<0.001%-0. 013%) in group B, respectively. Conclusions: PBPC mobilization with G-CSF in CCR patients is feasible a safety. CD 34+ cell yield is significantly better with temporary witheld of imatinib, G-CSF did not preferentially mobilize leukemic progenitors and leukemic burden did not significant change in the 10 months following mobilization. In spite of BCR-ABL negativity in some pts, minimal residual concentration of BCR-ABL transcripts was found in collected cells in most pts both investigated groups.",

Afanasyev St. Petersburg State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RUS) Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by altered stem cell genotype. Clinical application of Gleevec has sufficiently increased the efficiency of CML therapy. However, the causes of relapse in some patients, due to evolving drug resistance, still remain unclear. Increased telomerase activity (TA) may determine cell immortalization, being a frequent event of malignant transformation. Precise mechanisms of activation/reactivation of telomerase gene expression are not yet defined, in particular for CML. The aim of our study was to evaluate the levels of hTERT gene expression in the patients with CML during monotherapy with Gleevec.",

Parikh Tata Memorial Hospital (Mumbai, IND) Objectives: To analyze the outcome of Allogenic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) in CML patients using EBMT score based risk groups. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all consecutive CML patients who underwent ASCT in our hospital from 1983-2005 was done. The EBMT score was used to stratify into risk groups which were compared for differences in outcome. Results: A total of 81 patients (63 males and 18 females) underwent ASCT. The median age was 31 years (range 6-46). The stem cell source was PBSC in 46% (n=37) and BM in 54% (n=44) Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 77% (n=62) and nonmyeloablative in 23% (n=19). Cyclosporine and Methotrexate was used for Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in 88% (n=71) patients. The median mononuclear cell (MNC) dose was 3.84 X 10 8 /Kg (range 0.9-8.3). Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred in 85 % (n=69) and 68 % (n=55) patients respectively with median of 16 (range 9-47) and 20 (10-175) days. Acute and Chronic GVHD occurred in 85% (n=69) and 44% (n = 35) patients respectively with skin being the most common site. Post ASCT 69% (n=56) patients had remission marrow with complete cytogenetic and complete molecular response (RT-PCR negative for bcr-abl) in 67% (n=55) and 64% (n=52) respectively. There were 14 relapses of which 9 had only cytogenetic relapse. At a median follow up of 67.8 months 52 %( n=42) of patients are alive with 47% (n=38) in complete remission (Fig 1) . The Transplant related mortality was 29% (n=24) with acute GVHD and sepsis being the most common causes. There were 19% (n=15) deaths post 100 days of ASCT and most common causes were Chronic GVHD (n=11) and relapsed disease (n=3).Based on the EBMT score the distribution of patients were n=39(risk 0&1), n=29(risk 2), n=8(risk 3), n=3(risk 4) and n=1 in (risk 5-7). The median overall survival (OS) for risk 0&1 group has not yet reached while the median OS was 31.64 months (risk 2), 26.07 months (risk 3), 24.36 months (risk 4) and 20.72 months (risk 5-7) [(p=0.287) (Fig 2) ].Even when risk category 3 to 7 were clubbed together there was no significant difference in overall survival (p=0.108). The OS was also not significantly different for myeloablative (33 patients alive among 62) versus nonmyeloablative (9 patients alive among 19) conditioning (p=0.798). Conclusion: The EBMT score based risk group analysis failed to show significant difference in overall survival in our study population (Asian Indians).",

However the cytogenetic response is short-lived with relapse occurring within one year following transplant. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in increasing the remission rate in CML patients after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Between October 2002 and March 2005, twenty patients with Ph+ CML within the one year of diagnosis were enrolled in the study after informed consent. All patients were mobilized with (mini-ICE) regimen and the collected CD 34+ cells were cryopreserved. Then, patients received high dose busulphan followed by infusion of the collected peripheral blood stem cells. After hematological recovery imatinib as 400 mg/day was given to all patients for one year. After 12 months of imatinib therapy, 60% of patients achieved complete cytogenetic response from whom 45% were in major molecular response, and 15 % were in maximum measurable response ( > 4.5 log reduction of BCR / ABL transcripts compared to pretransplant levels). Three patients died due to blast crisis , one after 3 months and two after 6 months of starting imatinib. So far, we can conclude that imatinib increased the molecular remission rate of CML patients after APBSCT, however longer follow-up is warranted to confirm these preliminary results.",

Koldehoff, A. Bicen, N.K. Steckel, R. Trenschel, D.W. Beelen University Hospital (Essen, D) A single point mutation (VAL617Phe) in the janus tyrosine kinase gene JAK2 was identified to be characteristic for some patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). Since the pre-transplant presence of risk factors (anemia, osteosclerosis and peripheral blasts) affects the result of myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in MMM patients, we intended to evaluate the impact of a JAK2 gene mutation in those patients regarding their outcome after allogeneic SCT. We report on 25 patients (pts) (13 male, 12 female; median age= 45 years) with idiopathic myelofibrosis (n=14), postpolycythaemic (n=6) and post-thrombocythaemic (n=5) myeloid metaplasia who underwent allogeneic HSCT between 1994 and 2005. Myeloablative conditioning was based on fractionated total body irradiation in 24 cases or on treosulfan (n=1). Donors were HLA-identical related (n=12), matched unrelated (n=8), mismatched sibling (n=1), or mismatched unrelated (n=4). Transplants consisted of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells (n=24) or bone marrow (n=1). GVHD-prophylaxis was performed using CSA and MTX (n=15), alemtuzumab and CSA (n=9), or CSA and MMF (n=1). Among all pts a pre-transplant JAK2 gene mutation was found in 14 cases (56%): idiopathic myelofibrosis n=7 (50%); postpolycythaemic myelofibrosis n=4 (67%); postthrombocythaemia n=3 (60%). After transplant 7 (53%) of the surviving pts had a JAK2 positive status prior to SCT whereas 6 (47%) were JAK2 negative. Due to a clinical risk stratification based on the pre-transplant presence of adverse prognostic factors 11 pts were categorized into a low risk group whereof 6 (55%) showed JAK2 mutation. Among 14 high risk pts JAK2 positivity was observed in 8 cases (57%). In total 5 (20%) hematologic relapses occurred [1 (10%) in the low risk, 4 (29%) in the high risk group]: of 14 pts with an initially detectable JAK2 gene mutation 3 relapsed after SCT. Vice versa 2 of 11 initially JAK2 negative pts developed relapse. As reported for the natural course of MMM, JAK2 gene mutations seem to have no prognostic significance regarding relapse risk and survival after allogeneic SCT.",

Ottinger, S. Ferencik, H. Grosse-Wilde, R. Trenschel, A. Elmaagacli, M. Lindemann, D.W. Beelen University Hospital of Essen (Essen, D) DNA-based HLA-typing is performed either at the antigen (low resolution) or allelic (high resolution) level. The role of HLA-A,B,C,DRB1 antigen mismatches on clinical outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is well established, whereas the role of the corresponding allelic level mismatches is less clear. Our group could not demonstrate any effect of single or combined HLA-A,B,C allele mismatches on clinical outcome in a well defined homogenous cohort of 171 unrelated transplants (Ottinger et al., Transplantation 78:1077 -80,2004 . To clarify the role of allele mismatches in transplant biology, we examined our parallel cohort of 91 transplants from related donors mismatched for at least 1 A or B or DRB1 HLA-antigen in graft versus host (GvH) and/or host versus graft (HvG) direction according to pretransplant low resolution typing results. The present study was guided by the idea, that effects of allele mismatches might be detected or ruled out more easily if accompanied by the preload of at least one HLA-antigen mismatch. The mean age of the enrolled 41 female and 50 male patients suffering from early or advanced stage acute lymphatic (n=8), acute myeloic (n=24) or chronic myeloic (n=59) leukemia, was 32 years (range 16-57). Retrospective DNA-sequencing revealed that 21 (64) patients were mismatched for 1 to 3 additional loci at the allelic level in GvH (HvG) direction. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed for the classical clinical endpoints including patient and donor age, diagnosis, disease stage, graft source, and sex mismatch as covariates beside the sum of HLA (class I and II) antigen and additional HLA (class I and II) allel mismatches in GvH-and HvG direction. Independent risk factors (p = p-value, RR = relative risk) for overall survival are shown in Table 1 . Not in the Cox Model was the covariate sum of HLA-antigen mismatches in GvH-direction(RR: 1.1, 0.7). For the endpoint acute graft versus host disease the most important independent risk factor was sum of HLA-class II antigen plus class II allel mismatches in GvH-direction (p= 0.005), followed by advanced disease status (p=0.04) and sum of HLA-class I plus class II antigen mismatches in GvHdirection (p=0.06). We conclude that additional HLAmismatches at the allele level have an independent impact on transplant outcomme in patients transplanted with HLAantigen mismatched related donors. This study was supported by the Deutsche Jos\u00e9 Carreras Leuk\u00e4mie Stiftung Increased amount of indications for alloBMT is connected with increased demand for donors. For approximately 30% of the patients is possible to find HLA identical sibling, for another 70% of the patients is necessary to obtain graft from alternative donors. Because it can be difficult or even impossible to find fully matched alternative donors, that means donors identical in all 10 HLA antigens typed on HR level of A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 loci, we must often accept donors with some mismatches.",

Half of these patients were transplanted in advanced stage of the disease. In 80% of the patiens ATG-Fresenius was used in conditioning and 17% of the patients were transplanted without serotherapy. The most frequent mismatch in our cohort of the patients was single mismatch on C locus (28%), followed by combined mismatch in class I and II (24%). Multiple mismatch in class I was present in 19% and one single mismatch on A or B loci in 8% of the patients. 7% of the patiens received graft with 2 mismatches on C, while 7% received graft with one and 7% with multiple mismatch in class II. HLA. Results: 34 patiens developed GVHD.( Gr.I-38%, Gr.II-38%, Gr. III-12% and Gr. IV-12%). 41 patiens died after BMT. 40% for relapse, 31% for infection, 18% for GVHD and 11% due to VOD. Three year probability of survival is 40% for AML, 60% for CML, 75% for ALL and 30% for MDS patients. 3-year probability of survival of the 17 patiens, 14 of whom in advanced stage of the disease, who received graft mismatched for DRB1, is 50%. Summary: BMT from mismatched alternative donors offer chance for the patients without fully(10/10) matched donor. ATG in conditioning decreases the risk of severe GVHD (24% Gr. III+IV) The survival after BMT depends on diagnosis and on the stage of the disease. Relapse and infection were the most common causes of treatment failure in our cohort of the patients. Altogether 145 post HSCT patients were observed and the follow-up was obtained in 100% (111 patients) transplanted in our institution and in about 20% transplanted in other Polish transplant centers from donors typed by NPBMDR. Groups of patients belonging to different levels of matching were well balanced with respect to the background disease and age. Cumulative proportion of survival were plotted for each level of matching and for our and other Polish institutions and evaluated with the use of Cox's F test. It appeared that: survival of patients receiving transplant from fully matched donors at 5 loci at HR (Level 3) was superior over survival of all groups matched at lower levels or mismatched at least in one allele. It was seen when compared patients fully matched at Level 3 against patients fully matched at Levels 1 and 2 (p=0,02) or mismatched (p=0,02). In this analysis only patients from our institution were evaluated, however similar results were obtained when our and other Polish TC patients were considered. Conclusion: high resolution matching at least for 5 loci secures optimal confirmatory typing results evaluation and patients fully matched at this level enjoy the best probability of survival.

Haioun H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor (Cr\u00e9teil, F) Follicular lymphomas (FL) have a median survival ranging between 8 10 years. At relapse, high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) can be considered as an alternative to conventional chemotherapy. However, efficacy of this strategy remains controversial. The purpose of our retrospective study is to evaluate ASCT in the pre and post rituximab era as consolidation after 2nd or 3rd remission (at least PR). Between March 1989 and Apr 2004, 54 pts were treated at relapse with ASCT. At initial diagnosis, median age was 47 yrs (range 24-61) and FLIPI score was > 3 in 18%. ASCT was performed in 2nd (n=43) or 3rd remission (n=11) [median delay diagnosis-ASCT=44 months (range 7-139) and 53 months (range 21-227), respectively]. The conditioning regimens used were: VP16/cyclophosphamide (CY)/TBI in 33 cases, CY/TBI in 9, BEAM in 10 and CY/busulfan in 2. After ASCT, 49 pts achieved CR, 4 achieved PR and 1 pt progressed. In Dec 2004, with a median follow-up of 4.7 yrs, 27 pts (50%) had relapsed after ASCT with a median time to relapse of 12 months (range 2-95) and 18 pts have died. Causes of death were: lymphoma recurrence in 8 cases, secondary malignancy in 6 cases (3 MDS/AML, 2 radiationassociated solid tumors, 1 EBV associated lymphoma after salvage allogenic transplantation), and late infection in 4 cases, occurring in remission (varicella, septicaemia) or after a new salvage therapy (cellulitis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, HHV6 encephalitis after allogenic transplantation). Ten-year overall survival (OS) from initial diagnosis was 68%. Five-year OS and event-free survival after ASCT were 74 and 52%, respectively. Patients treated at relapse before 1998 did not receive rituximab (n=29) and those treated after 1998 received a rituximab-based salvage regimen before ASCT (n=25). The main characteristics of the two populations were as indicated in the table 1. After adjusting for the follow-up (median follow-up of the rituximab-treated group: 3.8 yrs), comparison between the 2 groups of pts treated with ASCT at relapse shows a significantly better OS of the rituximab treated group as compared to that of the rituximab-na ve group (100 vs 61% at 4 years, p=0.01). These data suggest that the well-established efficacy of rituximab in FL is not abrogated by consolidative ASCT delivered at relapse in pts not previously treated with rituximab and further emphasize the superiority of immunochemotherapy over chemotherapy alone. failure) were succesfully resolved. The median follow up was 20,6m in HIV+ pt and 12m in HIV-pt. In the HIV+ group 3 pt relapsed, 2 of them died and 1 remains in a new CR after chemotherapy. Other 2 pt died from multiorgan failure and late opportunistic infection. In the HIV-group 8 pt relapsed and 7 of them died. The EFS was 50% in HIV-pt and 64% in HIV+ pt (p=0,34). OS was 53% in HIV-pt and 65% in HIV+ pt (p=0,3). Conclusions: Our results showed similar clinical outcomes in NHL HIV+ and NHL HIV-pt undergoing ASCT. ASCT may be applied with guarantees on patients diagnosed with NHL and AIDS, as long as HAART is maintained, in a similar way to the HIV-setting Indolent B-cell and mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) can not be cured by conventional chemotherapy. The only curative therapy for these patients is allogeneic SCT. We evaluated the outcome of partially T-cell depleted SCT and the effect of therapeutic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in case of relapse after SCT in intensively chemotherapy-pretreated patients. Between October 1995 and December 2004, 42 consecutive patients with follicular lymphoma (n = 26), MCL (n= 6) and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 10) underwent partially Tcell depleted SCT. Before SCT, patients received median 12 cycles (range, 6-27) of chemotherapy using median two different treatment lines (range, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Disease status at the moment of SCT was chemosensitive residual disease in all patients except for one patient who was in complete remission (CR). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (n = 36) or voluntary HLA-identical unrelated donors (n = 6). In the first 24 patients transplanted with a sibling donor anthracyclines were added to intensify the standard marrow ablative conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and TBI 9 Gy. The next cohort of 18 patients received the standard conditioning regimen. Median follow-up was 4,1 (range, 0.4-9.5) years. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was high in the first cohort of 24 patients treated with the intensified conditioning (46%). In the second cohort of patients, NRM decreased to 22% after omitting the anthracyclines. The incidence of acute GVHD \u2265 grade II was not dependent of the type of conditioning regimen (33% in the first cohort vs 28% in the second cohort). Extensive chronic GVHD occurred more frequently in patients treated with anthracyclines (33% vs 19%). Nine out of the 42 patients relapsed after SCT. Three of them died before DLI could be given. Six patients received DLI from their sibling donors at median 29 months after SCT (range, 8-85). Four of these patients achieved CR, 1 patient achieved partial remission and 1 patient remained in stable disease after SCT. The 5 years probability of relapse, lymphoma-free survival (LFS), current LFS and overall survival was 25%, 36%, 39% and 44% in patients treated with anthracyclines and 36%, 49%, 49% and 69% in patients conditioned without anthracyclines, respectively. We conclude that heavily chemotherapy-pretreated patients with indolent and MCL types may benefit from T-cell depleted SCT. Attenuating the conditioning regimen in combination with DLI improved outcome substantially.",

Ho, M. Hensel University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, D) Between 1992 and 2005 a total of 52 patients (pts) with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) with a median age of 34 years (17-65) were treated in our institution. 31 were females (60%). 41 pts had stage I/II (79%), 11 pts stage III/IV (21%). All pts were first treated with a sequential chemotherapy (CHT) consisting of 3-6 cycles of CHOP or CHOP-like regimens (incl. 8 pts treated with Mega-CHOEP) for remission induction. 9 pts received additional 1-3 cycles of DHAP, HAM or DexaBEAM for further consolidation. A total of 24 pts (46%) received upfront high-dose CHT and autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT), either as part of study protocols such as the Mega-CHOEP trial (n=8) or because of individual treatment decisions (after conditioning with BEAM). All pts who underwent SCT and 21 of 28 conventionally treated pts (75%) received additional mediastinal radiotherapy. Since 2001, pts received rituximab as part of induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy (8 of 24 transplanted pts and 18 of 28 conventionally treated pts). Results: With a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 8-112), estimated 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) from diagnosis of all 52 patients was 76%. After induction therapy 23 pts (44%) achieved a complete remission (CR) or a CR unconfirmed, 26 pts (50%) a partial remission (PR). 3 pts (6%) had progressive disease after 3-5 cycles of CHT. 7 pts. of the conventional treated group relapsed within 12 months, whereas only 2 of them achieved a long-lasting remission after reinduction therapy and SCT. There were only two pts who had a relapse 4 and 8 months after upfront SCT, respectively. Pts who received Rituximab had a significantly improved PFS (log-rank, p=.01). Upfront high-dose CHT and SCT improved PFS in pts not pretreated with rituximab (5-year PFS 85% vs. 34%, p=0.005), whereas in pts pretreated with rituximab, SCT had only marginal impact on PFS (5-year PFS 100% vs. 85%, p=0.2). In a cox proportional hazards regression model, both rituximab treatment (p=0.01) and upfront SCT (p<.001), correlated with PFS, whereas radiotherapy was not associated with better outcome. Conclusions: The addition of Rituximab to conventional or high-dose chemotherapy improved the outcome of pts with PMBL as compared to pts in the pre-rituximab era. Upfront autologous SCT has a favourable impact on PFS, mainly in pts not pretreated with rituximab. A beneficial effect of radiotherapy on PFS and OS could not be observed in our pts.",

There were 70 males and 40 females with a median age at diagnosis of 29 years (range, 10 -79). At diagnosis, sixty-seven patients (61%) presented with advanced stage, 55 patients (54%) had B symptoms, 29 (26%) bulky mediastinal mass and 34 patients (38%), extranodal disease. Forty-one patients (37%) had previously received radiotherapy during first line therapy. Disease status at the time of administration of the salvage protocol was primary refractory disease (n = 17, 15%), first relapse (n = 72, 65%) and second or subsequent relapse (n = 21, 20%). Eighty-three patients (75%) received only one line of chemotherapy (CT) before PBPC mobilization while the remaining 27 patients (25%) received two or more lines. Median number of cycles administered per patient was 2 (range, 1 -3) with a median time interval between cycles of 28 (range, 21 -76) days. PBPCs were collected after the second and the third cycle of chemotherapy in 50 (45%) and 45 patients (41%), respectively and the mobilization procedure was successful (> 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in 107 patients (97% of the series). In 24 patients (25%), PBPC mobilization was optimal (> 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg collected). DHAP / ESHAP regimens side effects were mostly associated to hematological toxicity. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity was seen in 20% of the cycles with severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/l granulocytes) and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l platelets) developing in 26% and 7% of the cycles, respectively. The most frequent grade 3-4 extra-hematological toxicity was nausea/vomiting (30%). Two patients died during the administration of the salvage therapy, leading to a treatment-related-procedure of 1.8%. In conclusion, DHAP / ESHAP administration leads to an adequate mobilization of PC into the PB in a vast majority of this group of heavily pretreated patients without significant hematological and extra-hematological toxicities.",

Thomas University of Cape Town (Cape Town,ZA) Introduction: The long-term prognosis of lymphoproliferative disorders remains poor. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be curative, but patients receiving standard conditioning develop substantial morbidity and mortality from graft vs host disease (GvHD), while in individuals with aggressive malignancies, reduced intensity conditioning schedules may result in higher rates of disease recurrence. Methods: Patients with advanced follicular lymphoma, transformed malignancy, and non CD30+ T-cell lymphomas, still responsive to chemotherapy, who had an HLA identical sibling were offered T-cell depleted stem cell grafts. Individuals with lymphoblastic lymphoma were first treated with intensive (ALL like) modalities. Conditioning was with ablative doses of either chemotherapy or total body radiotherapy. Stem cell grafts were harvested from the bone marrow (BM) or were obtained from the peripheral blood, by apheresis following mobilisation with cytokines (PBPC). GvHD prophylaxis was by ex vivo depletion of lymphocytes from the graft with CAMPATH-1 G or H antibodies. Patients receiving PBPC grafts were also prescribed therapeutic doses of cyclosporine. Results: Thirty-nine patients (follicular: 12, transformed: 11, lymphoblastic: 7 and peripheral T-cell: 9) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received stem cell grafts. Median age was 46 (range 21-59) years and 14 were female. In B-cell malignancies, median number of previous treatments was 3 (2-7). Twelve subjects with T-cell neoplasm received grafts in first remission. None had undergone a previous transplant. Ten received BM grafts and 29 had PBPC transplants. The median CFU-GM and CD34+ cells infused were 23.6 x 10 4 /kg and 2.76 x 10 6 /kg, respectively. All patients engrafted, although one patient died on day 15 of C. Albicans sepsis. Seven patients (18%) developed GvHD. In total 12 (31%) individuals expired of transplant related (TR) causes (n= 6) or from disease recurrence (n= 6). One year TR mortality was 15%. Cox analysis showed that GvHD and relapse of the malignancy were independent factors for treatment failure. At a median of 1226 (92-4157) days 69% survive disease free. Conclusions: By reducing the incidence and severity of GvHD, T-cell depletion allows patient to tolerate myeloablative doses of chemotherapy satisfactorily. This has resulted in acceptable treatment related mortality rates, with adequate protection from disease recurrence.",

Zevain is indicated for relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell NHL. We tried Zevalin in 11 patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. One of them who had relapsed DLBL after autologous stem cell transplantation received Zevalin before nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation. Method: All patients had positive CD20 expression in tissue. Treatment schedule was rituximab 250mg/m\u00b2 on days 1 and 8, Zevalin 0.4 m Ci/Kg on day 8 immediately after rituximab infusion. Results: 11 were enrolled between Oct 2004 and Jun 2005. There were 5 diffuse large B cell lymphomas, 2 follicular lymphomas, 1 MALToma, 2 Burkitt lymphomas, and 1 highgrade lymphoma (pathology, unspecified). Median age was 44 years (range: 24-77). All patients had been heavily treated (median 3, range: 2-6 regimens, median 11, range: 5-23 cycles). 2 patients had stage III and 9 patients had stage IV disease. 9 of 11 patients had previously been treated with rituximab containing regimens. Median Zevalin dose was 24 mCi. 2 with follicular lymphoma and each of DLBL and MALToma had complete remission, 1, stable disease, 6, progressive diseases. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia developed in 6 patients. No patient experienced febrile neutropenia. Median time to development of grade 4 cytopenia in 6 patients was 21 days from initiation of treatment (range: 20-48 days). In 4 patients with complete response, response duration was 419+ days, 321+ days, 258+ days and 181+ days respectively. In one patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who had leukemic-transformation 4 months after autologous stem cell transplantation, conventional ALL type induction chemotherapy was unsuccessful. With Zevalin, she achieved complete remission, and then she received nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation from her sister and remains free of disease for 321 + days. Conclusion: Zevalin is effective in patients with relapsed, refractory low grade B cell lymphoma and safe in old age and in patients with poor performance status. Also, Zevalin showed a remarkable efficacy as a debulking treatment before allogeneic stem cell transplantation in relapsed aggressive lymphoma which had been refractory to various lines of conventional and high-dose chemotherapy treatments. was considered as abnormal. A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was recorded and QT dispersion was defined as the difference between the maximal and minimal QT values. A QT dispersion > 50 ms was considered abnormal. Bazzett's formula was used to obtain heart rate-corrected QT dispersion (QTc dispersion). LVEF and QT dispersion were assessed prior to BEAC (d-7), twelve days (d+12) and three months (m+3) after BEAC. In addition, to these time points, QT dispersion was assessed on d-2. Stem cells were infused on day 0. Results: LVEF decreased significantly from d-7 (52+2%) to d+12 (49+2%, P=0.009) and returned towards base-line by m+3 (51+2%, P=0.13). QT dispersion and QTc dispersion increased from d-7 (31+2ms; 32+2ms) to d-2 (43+3ms; 44+3ms, P=0.011, P= 0.012, respectively). However, on d+12 and m+3 both QT dispersion and QTc dispersion did not differ significantly from baseline. Altogether 10 patients (33%) developed abnormal QT dispersion until d-2. The increase in QT dispersion did not correlated with the decrease in LVEF. Conclusions: High-dose CY results in cardiac systolic dysfunction as assessed by LVEF. This cardiotoxic effect was mirrored by QT dispersion and QTc dispersion. ECG seems to be feasible and cost-effective surrogate marker of cardiotoxicity related to high-dose CY. This allows clinicians to prevent cardiac function impairment and to start treatment in early phase.",

Hussaini, I. Maghfoor King Faisal Specialist Hosp. & Res. Ctr (Riyadh, SA) Objective: The outcome of high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (PR-HL) is not as encouraging as in relapsed HL. The aim of this study is to report our experience with HDC and ASCT in PR-HL. Methods: From 1996 to July 2005, 44 consecutive patients with biopsy proven HL who failed induction chemotherapy i.e. partial response (PR), no response (NR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or relapsing within 3 months of finishing the planned treatment were identified. All patients received ESHAP as salvage. Responding or stable patients received ESHAP for mobilization of stem cell and then received BEAM as HDC. Results: Male 23 ( 52 %), female 21 (48 %), Median age at diagnosis 19 years and at ASCT 20.8 years. Prior to salvage ESHAP, stages I:II:III:IV were 1:15:10:18, bulky disease (\u2265 8 cm) in 15 (34 %), mediastinum involvement 36 (82 %), spleen 11 (25%) and extranodal-site 19 (43 %) patients. 16 (36 %) had short lived CR, and 12 (27 %) had prior XRT. 26 (59%) had tissue confirmation at relapse. Median ESHAP cycles given were 3. 33 patients ( 75 %) received 3 and 9 (20 %) received 4 cycles. Responses to ESHAP were CR in 7 (16 %), PR 29 (66 %), NR / SD 8 patients ( 18 %). Median follow-up from diagnosis and ASCT is 34 months (14-137) and 15.3 months (2-78) respectively. 18 patients (40%) had <12 months of follow-up. Disease evaluation post ASCT showed overall response of 75 % ; CR 23 (52 %), PR 10 (23 %), NR / SD/ PD in 10 (23 %) patients. One patient had treatment related mortality. 17 out of 37 patients (46 %) with no CR prior to ASCT achieved CR after ASCT. 10 (43 %) out of 23 patients in CR post HDC ASCT relapsed. Over all events free survival (EFS) is 32 %; 14 (32 %) remain in CR, 12 (27 %) died of disease and 16 (36 %) were alive with disease at last follow-up. Conclusion: In patients with PR-HL, ESHAP + BEAM combination results in 75 % response rate with 50 % CR rate. Despite this high responsiveness, almost half of patients with CR relapsed. 25 % patients died due to disease. At a median follow up of 15.3 months, EFS is only 32 %. Better treatment strategies are urgently required for this group of patient population.",

            "text": "Interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter gene polymorphism (-592*C) associated with poor clinical outcome in DLBCL patients who underwent autoSCT after high-dose chemotherapy Y.K. Kim (1) IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine inhibiting Th1 functions, which may facilitate development of NHL by supporting tumor escape from the immune response. Among the various IL-10 promotor genes, the IL-10-1082G, -819C and -592C alleles were reported to be associated with high serum IL-10 level and there were a few reports about their roles in treatment outcome of DLBCL patients underwent autolougous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT). In the present study, we studied the frequency of these 3 alleles and their influence to the clinical outcome in 21 DLBCL patients underwent autoSCT after high-dose chemotherapy. At the time of high-dose chemotherapy, 3(14.3%) patients were in high risk first CR and 5(23.8%) were in second CR. And 7(33.3%) were in PR after salvage chemotherapy and 6(28.6%) had refractory disease. The median age of patients was 45 years (24~65) and the median follow-up duration was 37.1 ms. (11.0~122.4). Commonly used conditioning regimen were either BEAM or Bu/Cy/VP-16. Of total 21 patients, 5 (23.1%), 10 (47.6%) and 9 (42.9%) were found to carry IL-10-1082G, -819C and -592C alleles, retrospectively. As compared with -1082AA genotype, -1082G allele (GA/GG) failed to show better overall survival (OS), however -1082AA genotype showed longer progression free survival (PFS) than -1082G allele (median, 17.0 ms. vs. 0.8 ms., p<0.05) after auto-SCT. The PFS was also significantly shorter in patients carrying -819C allele than TT genotype (3.12 ms.vs. not applicable (NA.), p<0.05) and in -592C allele compared with AA genotype (3.12 ms. vs. NA., p<0.05). In multivariate analysis including IPI, stage at diagnosis, disease status at transplantation, 3 allele frequencies, -592C allele remained as an independent prognostic factor predicting shorter PFS (RR=10.6, p<0.05). Additionally, in a haplotype analysis, there was a longer PFS in patients carrying ATA/ATA than in other haplotypes (NA. vs. 3.2ms., p<0.05). In conclusion autoSCT after high-dose chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic approach in NHL patients. However, it is still a matter of problem to find and to manage the patients with refractory or progressive disease despite of autoSCT. This study suggests that the detection of IL-10 gene promoter polymorphism such as -592C allele at diagnosis helps us to predict the patients with poor outcome after autoSCT and to prepare other treatment plan such as alloSCT or tandem transplantation after autoSCT for those patients.",

However, neurological symptoms and laboratory data worsened. He presented seizures and finally died three days after TTP diagnosis without any response to established treatment. Case 2: A 31-year-old female diagnosed with AML and trilineal dysplasia in relapse after an autologous HPT, received an unrelated cord blood transplant in April 2005. She presented acute GVHD grade III involving the skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. She was receiving cyclosporine, prednisone and sirolimus on day +65 when she was admitted to hospital due to CMV disease involving the gastrointestinal tract and TTP was diagnosed. Cyclosporine and sirolimus were immediately interrupted and mycophenolate mofetil was started on. An oscillating response of the hemolytic process was seen on initiation of plasmapheresis. After 33 plasmapheresis sessions she began defibrotide 10 mg/kg/6h for 15 days. She completed 45 plasmapheresis sessions and was finally discharged with only daily prednisone 0.5mg/kg without any evidence of hemolysis. She is alive and well 210 days after transplant. Conclusion: Post-transplant microangiopathy may be a nonexceptional complication after UCBT and may require urgent intervention with cyclosporine suppression, optimization of immunosuppressive treatment if there is active GVHD and specific PTT treatment (plasma exchange and/or defibrotide).",

            "text": "Despite enormous increase in the number of available marrow donors that recently exceeded 10 million still a considerable proportion of patients requiring allogeneic hematopoietic transplant lack histocompatible donor. This has a little chance to change, particularly for patients with rare genotypes. On the other hand, in recent years cord blood emerged as a source of hematopoietic cells that may be more easily matched as it was shown that less stringent criteria of matching do not deteriorate the results of transplantation. Consequently, cord blood mismached at up to 2 out of 6 HLA antigens (A, B, DR) could be successfully used. However, the available inventory of unrelated cord blood units is much smaller than the inventory of marrow donors approximating 200 000 units. We have failed to find in the available literature analysis of searches for cord blood units mismached for no more than 2 out of 6 antigens for patients for whom there was no any marrow donor mismached at no more than 1 out of 10 antigens (A, B, Cw, DR, DQ). Therefore, we have performed such an analysis for consecutive 35 such patients treated in our Department. In this group there was no single individual for whom it was not possible to find cord blood unit mismatched at 2 antigens. Patient (HLA A *03, 30; B *35; Cw*03, *04; DRB1*08, *12; DQB1*03, *04) with the smallest number had 2 such units, and the next smallest number of units for any of the remaining 34 patients was 35, while the largest was 3257. Moreover, each of them had at least 2 (and up to 181) units mismatched in either one or one broad HLA antigen. Three patients had at least 1 HLA identical cord blood unit, and additional 2 at least 1 broad HLA identical cord blood unit. These data suggest that virtually for each patient requiring marrow transplant and lacking marrow donor it is now possible to match cord blood unit. Only for individual patients the number of available matched units might be too small to select unit (units) of sufficient cellularity. Therefore, wider use of cord blood should allow to transplant almost all patients requiring such therapy.",

            "text": "Umbilical cord blood banking: high-resolution HLA typing for DRB1 is an effective strategy to improve management of UCB donor search P. Bergamaschi, C.G. Perotti, C. Del Fante, G.L. Viarengo, L. Bellotti, A. Marchesi, C. Parisi, D. Romano, M. Martinetti, L. Salvaneschi Policlinico S. Matteo (Pavia, I) Objective: Prompt availability of the graft, cell dose and HLA disparities represent the major criteria for the donor selection in umbilical cord blood (UCB) banking. The degree of HLA compatibility influences the donor choice suggesting alternatives to UCB Banks current practice in order to better address the transplantologists needs. According to the FACT Netcord international standards, HLA-A, B and DRB1 loci shall be determined on a pre-cryopreservation sample from each UCB unit. Typing for A and B loci may be performed by serological methods and ambiguous results shall be confirmed by DNA techniques; DRB1 typing shall be performed by DNA techniques. Once a UCB unit is selected, a sample shall be tested to verify HLA class I and II typing and confirmation of maternal haplotype should be provided. No more than 2 mismatches are accepted considering HLA-A, B and DRB1, this last being assessed by high resolution molecular techniques. At the Pavia Cord Blood Bank, UCB donations have been routinely typed for both HLA class I and class II by low resolution molecular techniques (LR-DNA), then high resolution molecular technique (HR-DNA) has been adopted for DRB1. The mother haplotype is always assessed before inclusion in the inventory. Methods: We retrospectively evaluate the impact of such a strategy on the management of the UCB donor search process. Results: We review the data referring to the first 100 requests of UCB units potentially suitable for a patient that we have received from 2002. At that time, our inventory consisted of 1325 UCB units, all typed by LR-DNA for class I loci and 316 (24%) and 1009 (76%) by LR-DNA and HR-DNA respectively for class II loci. Our findings are detailed in graphic 1. Conclusion: Despite increasing initial costs, DNA techniques can solve the ambiguities of HLA A and B loci produced by serological tests. So together with the practice of confirming maternal haplotype before inclusion in the inventory, we are able to avoid that incomplete and inadequate information become evident at the request. Shrinking the period between search starting and issue for transplant, the availability of high resolution DRB1 guarantees the prompt availability of the graft. Our strategy offers economical and organizational advantages to the Transplant Facilities (i.e. no charges for unnecessary sample shipment, no delay in the patient's schedule) and optimizes the time for search requests management.",

The levels of hTERT gene expression were significantly higher in Bcr/Abl positive group of patients (\u00d0=0.032), as compared to Bcr/Abl-negative patients (resp., 67.0 AU vs. 37.3 AU). The differences in TA between Bcr/Abl positive group of patients and the donors (58.4 AU) were also significant (\u00d0=0.045). hTERT expression in Bcr/Abl-negative patients did not differ from controls (\u00d0=0.68). The ranges of individual values of hTERT gene expression in Bcr/Abl-positive and negative patients were, resp., 28.9 and 52.1 \u00c0U, thus showing much higher heterogeneity in the latter group. Conclusions: Gleevec therapy causes a decrease in Bcr/Ablpositive cells with altered hTERT gene expression. However, the clones of Bcr/Abl-negative hematopoietic cells with upregulated TA may remain in some patients, thus being a prerequisite for CML relapses. Hence, initial increase in hTERT gene expression in certain patients may retain during Gleevec monotherapy, thus suggesting a drug resistance mechanism. A more intensive therapy, including HSCT, may be considered for these cases.

The 1-year DFS is 48% (24-72). So far, only 3 pts relapsed with a 1-year cumulative incidence of only 18% (6-51). Three pts died of multi-organ toxicities, two died of acute GVHD, and two of late infections. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at day 100 was 22% (10-49), 13% after autologous and 41% after allogeneic SCT. These rates are expected in heavily pretreated pts with refractory lymphoma and there was no additional toxicity related to Zevalin. In conclusion, the inclusion of Zevalin in the conditioning regimens given prior to autologous and RIC allogeneic SCT may reduce the risk of post SCT relapse and improve the poor outcome of pts with refractory lymphoma given SCT with standard regimens.

The delay between collection and processing must not exceed 24hrs. Since 2001, the CBU volumes have been reduced (Sepax technology) for long-term storage in the BioArchive. Quality controls include testing maternal blood samples for infectious markers (HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV, syphilis) and the presence of IGg-and IgM-antibodies against toxoplasmosis, EBV and CMV on the day of birth and after a quarantine period of at least 60 days. No active infectious disease is mandatory. A baby's clinical examination is performed at the same time points. Moreover, in order to alert in case of severe disease occurring to the baby, the CBU donation and the FCBN contact were mentioned on the specific baby's health record. Microbiological tests on the CBU must be negative. In addition, the FCBN requires a minimal collection volume of 80 ml and a minimum of 2 x 10 6 CD34 cells for CB qualification",

San Raffaele (Milan, I); (2)Ospedale San Martino (Genoa, I) Introduction: EBV-lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) is a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Its incidence may increase up to 20% in patients who receive a T-cell depleted graft or when antithymocyte globuline (ATG) is used as graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)prophylaxis. EBV-LPD is frequently characterized by a fulminant clinical course and poor response to treatment; therefore early diagnosis and pre-emptive therapy may be clinically useful. Different studies have demonstrated a correlation between viral load and development of EBV-LPD with a positive predictive value of a copy number of 1000 copy/10 5 cells about 40%. Methods: We developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of EBV-DNA in PBMCs and monitored 111 consecutive patients undergoing allo-SCT. Patients with unrelated HLA-matched donor (77) or single HLA-mismatched related donor (12) received ATG or Campath during the conditioning regimen; patients with haplo-identical donor",

MBL can act as an acute phase protein and may modulate inflammatory response. Objectives: To explore the role of MBL in risk of infection and GvHD in patients undergoing ABMT. Methods: From 01/2001 to 10/2003 a total of 133 patients (age range 14 to 69 years, mean 43.5) were enrolled in a combined retro-and prospective study. Frequency, causes of infections and episodes of GVHD were recorded, and MBL genotype of recipient and donor were determined by heteroduplex analysis and MBL phenotype by ELISAs. Serial MBL concentrations were also measured pre BMT, day 0-45 and day 46-7 post BMT, and the results correlated with the MBL genotype (A/A indicating wild type, A/O indicating heterozygous for MBL structural-gene mutations and O/O indicating homozygous, for such mutations). Results: MBL concentrations increased between days 0 and 45 in all patients (A/A p=0.003) from pre-transplant levels. Between days 46-75 levels fell significantly (A/A p=0.0001, A/O p=0.001 and O/O p=0.008).",

Results: During the study period, a total of 123 gastrointestinal biopsies (upper intestinal tract: n=62, lower intestinal tract: n=61; median: 2 per patient) were taken. 56 of 123 showed signs of acute GvHD, 6 showed signs of residual GvHD and 61 showed no signs of active GvHD. The PCR detected DNA of EBV in 13 of 93 samples (14%), of CMV in 12 of 107 samples (11%), of HSV in 9 of 101 samples (9%), of HHV-6 in 57 of 102 samples (56%), of VZV in 2 of 92 samples (2%) and of Adenovirus in none of 50 analysed samples. In 13 of 123 biopsies there was no pathologic finding, whereas in 18 of 123 biopsies HHV-6 was the only pathologic finding that could explain gastro-intestinal symptoms. Taken together, 32 of 57 patients (56%) had gastro-intestinal biopsies positive for HHV-6 (5 of them turned from negative to positive under immunosuppressive treatment for GvHD). 10 of 12 biopsies positive for CMV showed concomittantly histologic signs of GvHD. 9 of 13 samples showed DNA of EBV and HHV-6 simultaneously. Conclusion: Endoscopic evaluation of patients with suspected GvHD of the gastro-intestinal tract frequently reveals virus of the herpes family as causal agent. This demonstrates an important therapeutic target in addition to immunosuppressive treatment for GvHD.",

This retrospective study from SFGM-TC registry concerned 1108 patients who underwent reduced-intensity conditioning regimen haematopoietic stem cell transplantations (RIC HSCT) for hematological malignancies [449 females, 659 males, median age:51.5 years]. The diagnosis were 291 AML, 62 ALL, 104 MDS, 222 NHL, 55 HD, 58 CLL, 95 CML, 219 MM. Before conditioning, 442 patients (40%) were in complete remission (CR), 337 patients in partial remission (PR), 107 in stable disease (SD) and 222 (20%) in progressive disease (PD). Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were used in 878 patients (79%) with a median CD34+ cell number of 6x106/kg, bone marrow in 213 and cord blood cells in 17 patients from 932 HLA matched related donors (84%) and 176 unrelated donors. There was a sex mismatching in 569 cases (51%) and an ABO incompatibility in 390 cases (35%). CMV serology showed 769 (69%) sero-positive pairs (pos vs neg:160, pos vs pos: 397, neg vs pos: 212). As conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis: 255 patients received fludarabine and TBI (2 grays), 465 patients (42%) received fludarabine associated to busulfan and 1 day to 5 days of anti-thymocyte globulins (FBS) (ATG 1day :100, 2 days:173, 3 days:68, 4 days:17, 5 days:81) and 388 patients other regimen;430 patients received cyclosporine A (CsA), 347 CsA+MMF, 247 CsA+methotrexate and 84 other regimes.

Kazmi Guy's & St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK) Introduction: We describe two patients with refractory Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculopathy (CIDP) who underwent intensive immunosuppression with Cyclophosphamide/ATG conditioning followed by autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation. Post transplant , both patients were off all immunosuppressantsone showed clinical improvement while the other had stable disease. Transplantation in refractory CIDP-CIDP is characterized by progressive symmetrical weakness with impaired sensation , absent or diminished reflexes, elevated CSF protein level & demyelination. About 25% patients are refractory to corticosteroids, plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin. Treatment modalities such as azathioprine , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil , ciclosporin & rituximab have been tried in refractory patients. Chemo-radiotherapy followed by autologous haemopoeitic progenitors is considered a valid treatment for refractory autoimmune disorders with limited experience in CIDP. Case A: A 42 year old gentleman presented in mid 2002 with rapidly progressive CIDP failing several lines of treatment including cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis & rituximab. At transplant he was transfering between a chair & bed but unable to walk unaided or do stairs. He underwent G-CSF mobilisation. In May 2004, he was conditioned with Cyclophosphamide /ATG followed by PBSCT with full engraftment by day + 13. He showed a marked recovery in his neurological status post transplant. At 18 months post transplant he was mobilising without aids & managing stairs. He has been off all immunosuppressants since transplant. Case B: A 72 year gentleman presented in 1995 with CIDP. He had a slowly progressive disease failing several lines of treatment. At mobilisation he was wheelchair bound with severe neurological disabilities. He had a successful stem cell ATG conditioned transplant & showed engraftment on day +15. At day +90, his neurological status has stabilised off all immunosuppressants. We looked at the lymphocyte subsets in both patients which showed recovery of CD3, CD4 & CD 8 positive cells by Day + 28. Further studies are pending to evaluate the T-cell repertoire.Conclusion: High dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by autologous PBSCT is a feasible option in patients with advanced progressive CIDP failing multiple lines of therapy.P580Association of thiotepa and cyclophosfamide as conditioning regimen for autologous HSCT in SLE.

The OS [EFS] is 37% [33%] with a median observation period (MOP) of 8.6 yrs. The OS for pts (n=2414) in first remission is 39% (CR1/VGPR/PR/SD/PRD) and 29% for relapse (CR2/SR/RR) pts (n=294). The OS rates in compliance with the status at MGT are 43% for CR1 (1094 pts), 36% for VGPR/PR (1223 pts), 24% for PRD (48 pts), 31% for SD (49 pts), 44% for CR2 (122 pts), 24% for SR (116 pts) and 9% for RR (32 pts) and 7% for UR (17 pts). The Busulfan-Melphalan MGT approach produced statistically superior OS rates during first remission: OS 49% vs. OS 35% with other regimens (p<0.001) and is currently under randomised investigation in the European HR-NBL-1/ESIOP study. Ewing tumours: 1318 pts up to 18 yrs., 55% are male, median age: 12.6 yrs. The OS (EFS) rates are 41% [38%]; MOP: 6.7 yrs. The OS for 866 first remission pts is 48% and 30% for 306 relapse pts. The OS rates according to status at MGT are 55% for CR1/VGPR (544 pts), 39% for PR (270 pts), 10% for SD/PRD (52 pts), 45% for CR2 (146pts), 16% for SR (90pts) and 17% for RR (34 pts) and 0% for UR (20 pts, 18 deaths). Busulfan-Melphalan containing regimens resulted in statistically superior survival in first remission pts (OS 61% vs. OS 36% with other regimens, p<0.001). The Euro-EWING 99 Study is currently asking a prospective, randomised question with BU-MEL MGT in selected high-risk patients. Wilms Tumours: 280 pts, 43% are males, median age: 6.1 yrs. and MOP 7.7 yrs. The OS [EFS] rates at 5 years are 52% [47%]. The OS was for 74 first remission pts 61% and was 50% in 177 relapse patients. Currently CEM MGT is evaluated prospectively in defined relapse patients within the SIOP 2001 Nephroblastoma trial. Potential candidates for new prospective studies in 2006 are: Soft tissue sarcomas: 787 pts, 55% are male, median age: 8.8 yrs., MOP: 8.9 yrs. The OS [EFS] rates are 29% [25%]. The OS rate of 470 first remission pts is 30% [27%] and 24% [20%] for 237 relapse patients. Retinoblastomas: 83 pts, 57% were males, median age: 3.7 yrs. and MOP: 10yrs. The OS [EFS] rate at 5 years is 65% [60%]. OS in 40 first remission pts was 76% and 54% for 39 relapse pts.",

In stem cell recipients clinical manifestations include diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain, weight loss, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, anorexia; sclerosing cholangitis has been also documented. The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence, clinical outcome and management of cryptosporidiosis in children after allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (allo-HPCT). Thirty children and adolescents, 12 girls and 18 boys, aged from 0.8 to 18.9 years (median 11.5 years) suffering from hematological malignancies (n=25), severe anaplastic anaemia (n=3) or congenital immunodeficiency (n=1) who underwent allo-HPCT from matched sibling (n= 10), partially matched family donor (n=5) or unrelated donor (n=15), in whom diarrhea occurred after transplantation were included into the study. The cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the stool samples using acid-fast staining method (Ziehl-Neelsen). Cryptosporidium was identified in 7 out of 30 children (23.3%). Two children with positive stool presented with symptoms of mild, self-limited diarrhea only. In 5 children diarrhea was prolonged and accompanied by jaundice, severe abdominal pain, remarkable flatulence, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. In 5 patients with severe symptoms and positive stool examination oral azithromycin in the dose of 10 mg/ kg for median 24 days (range from 14 to 55 days) was given. Three children improved which correlated with eradication of cryptosporidium from the stool. In one child the symptoms of diarrhea and cholecystitis resolved, but control examination of the stool after treatment was not performed. In one patient elimination of cryptosporidium oocysts with transient release of diarrhea and jaundice was followed by exacerbation of gut GvHD. Conclusions: Cryptosporidium should be considered among possible causes of diarrhea and jaundice in stem cell transplant recipients.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been the only curative treatment for children and adult with myelofibrosis. Transplantation outcome in children has been better than that of adult patients. Here, we report on 4 infants with idiopathic primary myelofibrosis who were treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our patients are 4 infants, 4-24 months of age. All have primary grade 3-4 (of 4) myelofibrosis and peripheral pancytopenia. One had splenectomy and evidence of lymph nodes extramedullary hematopoiesis. Cytogenetic studies showed that 2 patients had chromosome 7 abnormalities (del 7q33 and monosomy 7), the other 2 infants had normal cytogenetic studies. The conditioning regimen included busulfan (16 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and horse ATG (120 mg/kg). GvHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine and short course methotrexate. Patients' grafts were from an HLA matched sibling (in 3 patients) and from a grand father (in one patient). Antimicrobial prophylaxis included fluconazole and acyclovir. Patients had prompt neutrophil engraftment on days 11-18 and platelet engraftment 16-25. No transfusions were given after discharge from the unit. Patients tolerated conditioning fairly well. One patient developed gram-negative sepsis. Two patients developed mild acute and chronic GvHD, which had fully responded to corticosteroids therapy. With follow up periods of 346, 324, 206 and 198 days, all patients are doing very well. None of the patient is on immunosuppressive therapy. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for infants with idiopathic myelofibrosis appears to be curative.

Median age was 6.3 years (0. 55-19.4 ). Underlying disease was acute leukaemia in 128 cases (55 ALL, 53 AML), Lymphomas: 15 patient's and solid tumours in the remaining 103 patients. One hundred seventy three grafts were autologous and 68 were allogeneic (37 MSD, 7 MMSD, 27 MUD) . The most common source of stem cells was peripheral blood followed by bone marrow and umbilical cord blood (174, 55 and 15 respectively). Etoposide was part of the conditioning regimen in 56 patients and it was administered as a single IV 3-hour infusion (30-40 mg/Kg) with adequate hydration in 39, out of whom 9 received TBI.

Abecasis Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Oncologia (Lisbon, P) Introduction: Pediatric Hodgkin's disease (HD) can be cured in a large proportion of patients with current combined chemo and radiotherapy regimens. In the patients with relapsed or refractory diseases high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can improve their prognosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 11 pediatric pts (5 males, 6 females) with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin disease, submitted to HDCT-ASCT between December 94 and December 04, in our Institute. Results: At diagnosis 45% had extensive disease (IIIB-1; IVA-2; IVB-2) and 55% had localized disease (IIA-4; IIB-1; IIBE-1); 27% had bulky disease. Mean age at diagnosis was 12 y (9-15 y). All pts but one was treated before HDCT-ASCT with combined standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After front line therapy 4 pts were in CR; 2 in CRu and 5 in PR. Median time to progression was 11 months (range 6 to 44). Eight pts had 2 chemotherapy lines and 3 had 3 before the HDCT. Pre transplant disease status was RC in 4 pts and chemosensitivity was shown in all other. The HDCT regimen used was BEAM in 7, Melphalan/Etoposide in 3 and Melphalan alone in 1.The graft consisted of bone marrow in 4 pts, PBSC in 5 and both in 2. No toxic deaths occurred. Hematological recovery was as follow: median time to granulocytes >0,5 x 109/L was 15 days (range 10-31); median time to platelets >20x109/L was 28 days (range 10-55). Relapse occurred in 3 pts, after 3, 3 and 13 months. Two died, one and 4 years after relapse; the other patient is still in complete remission after salvage therapy. At present, 9/11 pts (81, 8%) are alive, in CR. The median follow-up is 55 months (11 -127 m) , with an event free survival of 72% and an overall survival of 71% at 4,5 years. Conclusions: Hodgkin Disease is an uncommon condition in pediatric patients and small series are published about the S211 management of refractory or relapsed cases. In our series HDCT with PBSC rescue is a safe and effective procedure in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin Disease, with long remissions, in according to published data.",

Han, E.S. Song, S.J. Kim, H.J. Kim, T.J. Hwang Chonnam University Hwasun Hospital (Hwasun, KOR) Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been accepted as a curative therapy for many hematologic malignancies, immune disorders, and genetic diseases. However, failure of HSCT may be encountered in practice because of either relapse of the malignancy or dysfunction of the graft. Second HSCT may be clinically indicated in some patients whose initial HSCT failed. Method: From May, 1991 to December, 2004 transplants were performed at the Pediatric Blood & Marrow Transplantation Center, Chonnam National University. This study was a retrospective analysis of the medical records on 15 patients who received the second HSCT after initial graft. The reasons for the second HSCT were dysfunction of the graft (N=8; AA, 6; Fanconi anemia, 1; adrenoleukodystrophy, 1), or relapse [N=7; AML, 5; ALL, 2; CML, 1]. Result: Among 8 patients with nonmalignant diseases 2 underwent the second HSCT because of primary graft failure and 5 because of late graft rejection. The median interval between the first HSCT and graft dysfunction was 130.5 days (range, 59 ~ 279 days) and the median intertransplant interval was 348 days (range, 86 ~ 1875 days). Seven patients received cyclophosphamide based conditioning. Stem cells were PB from matched sibling (N=6), BM from matched sibling (N=1), and UCB (N=1). Same donors were used except for one cord blood transplant. Grade IV AGvHD was developed in one. Two patients died and 1 experienced primary graft failure but is still alive. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year overall survival rate was 75% and disease free survival rate was 62.5% in nonmalignant diseases. All malignant patients underwent the second transplants because of relapse. The median interval between the first HSCT and relapse was 174 days (range, 90 ~ 1474 days) and the median intertransplants interval was 319 days (range, 178 ~ 1715 days). Five patients were conditioned with fludarabine, busulfan and antithymocyte globulin. Stem cells were PB from same donor in 5 and CB in 2. GvHD Grade II was found in 2. Four died of relapse and one of treatment-related complications. The Kaplan-Meier 22month overall and event free survival rate were 28.6% each in malignant diseases. Conclusion: Second HSCT for graft dysfunction of nonmalignant disease seems to be feasible and should be considered as a standard practice. The relapse of malignant diseases remains to a big obstacle even after the second HSCT, although small portion of patients might be salvaged.",

Erttmann, N. Kr\u00f6ger, T. Zabelina, P. Freiberger, A.R. Zander University Hospital Eppendorf (Hamburg, D) In a previous study we have shown significant influence of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) on immune recovery for several months after stem cell transplantation (SCT) in adult patients. The present study was undertaken to investigate the impact of Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) -prophylaxis using ATG on immune reconstitution in paediatric patients.Methods: A cohort of 42 paediatric patients received allogeneic SCT from related fully HLA-matched or 1 locusmismatched donors for different malignant and non-malignant diseases. Group 1 included 19 patients without ATG prophylaxis and group 2 included 23 patients with ATG prophylaxis for GVHD. Flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subsets was performed at various time points: until day 30, between day 31-60, 61-90, 91-180, 181-365 , between 1-2 years, between 2-5 years and more than 5 years post transplant. Results: Comparing the ATG-group with the non-ATG-group we found a significantly delayed recovery till day 30 of CD4+CD45RA+ cells (p=0.01), between day 31 and 60 of CD3+ (p=0.02), CD3+CD4+ (p=0.003), CD3+CD8+ (p=0.048), CD4+CD45RA+ (p=0.008), CD4+CD45R0+ (p=0.008) and CD8+CD45RA+ (p=0.005) cells and between day 91 and 180 of CD4+CD45RA+ cells (p=0.04) in the ATG-group. Interestingly, from day 181 on the number of all T-cell subpopulations, but not of B-and NK-cells, was higher in the ATG-group (significantly only CD4+CD45R0+ cells between 2 and 5 years post transplant). Conclusion: In paediatric patients GVHD-prophylaxis with ATG induces lymphocyte depletion and leads to impaired immune reconstitution for 6 months after transplantation. After that the recovery of all T-cell-subsets tends to be better in the ATG-group.",

Kuci, M. Ebinger, T. Feuchtinger, R. Handgretinger University Childrens Hospital (Tuebingen, D) Introduction: Transplantation of HLA-mismatched stem cells opens the possibility to trace even single cells by their differing expression of HLA molecules. We were able to detect even small amounts of autologous cells after haplo-identical stem cell transplantation. Method: Peripheral blood from 12 patients transplanted from HLA-mismatched family donors were monitored for autologous cells using HLA-specific antibodies in combination with lineage specific antibodies. Results: Pre-transplant controls of donor and recipient were necessary as the level of fluorescence differed widely depending on the HLA-antibody used. Antibodies against split antigens could also be used and allowed more patients to be included. CD5 was used in OKT3 treated patients to detect even small amounts of T-cells. Autologous T cells could be detected in all patients with high CD5 expression, while allogeneic CD5+ cells showed lo to medium expression of CD5. After withdrawal of OKT3, CD3+ cells could be detected and autologous T cells faded away by time. Therapeutic intervention could be monitored on a daily schedule and allowed early feedback. HLA-antibodies could also be used to monitor the number of residual tumor cells in peripheral blood an marrow after transplantation. HLA-antibodies were used to confirm the detection of leukemic cells presenting an aberrant phenotype or could also be used where an aberrant phenotype was missing. Conclusion: Flow cytometry using fluorescence labelled antibodies against HLA-antigens offers a interesting tool after HLA-mismatched transplantation. Even 1 HLA-mismatched cell out of 100 000 can easily be detected within several hours with a standard flow cytometer. Combining HLA-antibodies with antibodies against known antigens of leukemic cells may improve the resolution of MRD diagnosis and confirm the result. Reticulocytes reflect the rate of bone marrow production and can be divided into low, medium and high fluorescent fraction according to the RNA content using automated analyzer. We measured the immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) daily after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using XE-2100 (Sysmex cop.) and compared with ANC which is a conventional marker of engraftment in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The median day of rising IRF and IRF > 3% were day 8 (4-29) and day 11 (4-31) in 42 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT and preceded the day of ANC > 0.5x10 9 /L, which was day 14 (8-38) (P < 0.001, P = 0.026). The median day of rising IRF and IRF > 3% were earlier than the day of ANC > 0.5x10 9 /L irrespective of the stem cell sources in allogeneic HSCT. In 45 autologous HSCT, the median day of rising IRF, IRF > 3% and ANC > 0.5x10 9 /L were day 8 (2-16), day 9 (2-17) and day 11 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , respectively (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). The median day of rising IRF, IRF > 3% and ANC > 0.5x10 9 /L were day 8 (2-16), 10.5 (4-16) and day 12.5 (8-20) in 24 transplants with CD34+ cell selection (P = 0.006), day 7 (2-12), 8 (2-17) and day 11 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) in 21 transplants without CD34+ cell selection (P = 0.011), respectively. Immature reticulocyte counts using automated analyzer allow early detection of hematopoietic regeneration in both allogeneic and autologous HSCT. Our results showed rising IRF and IRF value of 3% are useful for predicting subsequent myeloid engraftment in pediatric HSCT.",

            "text": "A treosulfan-based conditioning regimen for children with refractory or recurrent leukaemia K.-W. Sykora, K. Rehe, B. Meissner, M. Sauer, L. Grigull, K. Welte Hannover Medical University (Hannover, D) Background: Children with refractory and recurrent leukaemia require rapidly paced intensive chemotherapy. They accumulate organ toxicity and tolerate standard myeloablative conditioning regimens poorly. They would, nevertheless, benefit from a conditioning regimen with high antileukemic and, if possible, myeloablative activity. Treosulfan is an alkylating agent with both of these desired activities. Surprisingly low toxicity has been reported in transplantation (TX) of high-risk adult patients. Methods: In 2004 and , five children with high-risk, refractory or recurrent leukaemia were transplanted. One 10 months old boy with refractory infant ALL received a double transplant 4 weeks apart, one 12 months old girl with infant leukaemia in 3rd remission, and one 16 year old girl with ALL relapse after BMT received unmanipulated bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings. Conditioning: fludarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2/day x 6), treosulfan (12 g/m\u00b2/d x 3), melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2/d x 1). Mean cell doses transplanted were 3.75 x 108 nucleated cells/kg BW (range 3.3 to 5.4 x 108/kg), GVHD prophylaxis was CSA only. Two boys, one 16 years old with refractory AML M5 in full relapse and one 10 year old with high-risk BCR-ABL-positive AML in first remission received conditioning as above, but with Treosulfan 14g/m2 x 3, Thio-TEPA (2 x 5 mg/kg) replacing Melphalan, and OKT3 plus Mycophenolate as GVHprophylaxis. Both received CD3-CD19 depleted PBSC (11.7 and 20.5 x 106 CD34 cells/kg) from their haploidentical fathers. Results: All patients engrafted rapidly and achieved full donor chimerism after the first TX. Conditioning toxicity was minor except engraftment syndrome in 2 patients. The patient treated with the double TX relapsed 4 months after the second transplant and is awaiting a third transplant. No GVHD exceeding grade II was observed. All other patients are in remission with followup of 1 to 17 months. Conclusion: This treosulfan-based conditioning regimen is feasible, has low toxicity and appears to have antileukemic acitivity in children with high-risk, recurrent or refractory leukaemia. Larger numbers and a longer follow-up are needed to compare results of this low-toxicity myeloablative regimen to conventional dose reduced \"mini-transplant\" regimens which are an alternative for this patient population. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is performed in an increasing number of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) patients (pts). There are contradictory data about the adverse impact of more lines of chemotherapy and previous treatment with Chlorambucil (CLB) on stem cell harvest. From September 2004 to October 2005 we treated 10 poor-risk CLL pts, (7 pts Rai stage II, Binet B, 2 pts Rai I Binet B, 1 Rai III Binet C, 7 pts ZAP 70 positive, 3 pts ZAP 70 negative, 7 pts CD38+, 3 pts CD 38-), median age 56,4 years ( range 34-65), 6 male and 4 female, the median follow up to diagnosis was 4,5 years (range 1-8 years).The pts underwent previously to treatment with 2 lines (7 pts),3 lines (1 pts) or 4 lines (2 pts) of chemotherapy and all previously underwent treatment with CLB, median time 4,8 months,(range 1-9 ). The treatment of mobilization was a intermediate-dose (ID) of Ara-C, 800 mg/m\u00b2 every 12 h for six doses +G-CSF 10 mcg/Kg. The status at the time of mobilization was: 9 pts in partial remission (PR), 1 pts in complete remission (CR). The target yield was \u2265 5.0x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. All pts mobilized peripheral stem cells. A median of 401 cells/mcl was count of peripheral CD34+ cells (range 35-732). A median of 13,49.x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg was collected per pts ( range 5,1-26,5). The median time of the first collection from chemotherapy was 14,9 days (range 11-21).The median number of apheresis to obtain the target was 2,4( range 1-3) The study of minimal residue disease (mrd) demonstrated median infiltration on collected product of 8% (range 1-21)Only 3 pts received irradiated and filtered packed red blood cells (2 for pts),while platelet support was needed in 7 pts, 3 pts received apheresis (1 for pts),4 pts received randomly obtained platelet concentrates (range 6-11 HSCT remains the only curative therapy for CML patients (pts). We present results of myeloablative (MAB) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT from sibling donor in 62 pts with CML, treated between 2000 and 2005. In MAB group, 44 pts (median age 39.5, range 17-54 yrs) were conditioned with BuCy2 regimen. Thirty four pts were in chronic, 7 in acceleration and 3 in 2nd chronic phase. 26 pts received PBSC and 18 were grafted with bone marrow HSC. Transplanted material contained 3.8(1.24-14.6)x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells. Prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of CsA and methotrexate. Eighteen pts (median age 48, range 37-56 yrs) were treated with fludarabine-based RIC regimen. This group comprised 13 pts in chronic and 5 with accelerated phase. Patients were grafted with PBSC only, containing 4.75 (2.25-10)x10 6 /kg CD34+. CsA and ATG were given as GVHD prophylaxis. RIC group differ from MAB group by 2 factors: higher age (p<0.001) and higher pre-transplant (Gratwohl) risk score (p=0.028). Results: Hematopoietic recovery occurred in all pts in MAB, and in 94% in RIC group. Probability of overall survival for all pts was OS=0.57 \u00b1 0.09. Thirty one pts developed aGVHD \u2265 2 grade (21 in MAB and 10 in RIC) and 25 pts extensive cGVHD (18 in MAB and 7 in RIC). Eight pts (44%) in RIC and 6 (14%) pts in MAB group died because of GVHD or infection and GVHD. Mean survival, estimated 5-yrs OS, probabilities of GVHD incidence, relapse and treatment related mortality (TRM) with respect to transplantation method, are shown in In summary, this experience with sibling donor allogeneic HSCT in CML, demonstrates a similar incidence of aGVHD\"d2 and extensive cGVHD in RIC and MAB, but higher treatment related mortality caused by GVHD in RIC-HSCT group.Treatment with rituximab is widely used for B cell non Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). However its effects on peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and function are poorly understood. We retrospectively studied 72 consecutive patients with NHL (42 follicular and 30 diffuse large cells) who underwent peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collections, and we compared the mobilization characteristics and engraftment kinetics of 28 patients receiving and 44 patients not receiving rituximab six months before PBSC mobilization. The mean age was 37 years (range 17-60). Sixty-four patients (88.9%) had stage III-IV disease. Forty-eight patients (66.7%) had bone marrow involvement. Systemic B symptoms were present in 42 patients (58.3%). Mobilization chemotherapy regimens consisted of: high dose cyclophosphamide in 34 patients (47.3%), a high dose cytarabine containing regimen (DHAP) in 38 patients (52.7%). All patients received subcutaneous G-CSF from day +2 after chemotherapy. At the time of PBSC mobilization 46 patients (63.9%) were considered to be responsive (complete remission, partial remission or sensitive relapse) and 26 (36.1%) not responsive (refractory relapse or refractory to therapy). The median CD34+ cells collected was 5.8 x10 6 /kg in patients receiving rituximab compared vs. 7.2 CD34+ cells x10 6 /kg (p=n.s.) in non rituximab treated group. Three patients (10.7%) in rituximab group and five (11.4%) in non rituximab group fail to mobilize, defined as failure to reach a circulating CD34+ cell count of 10/mcl (p=ns). The comparison of the two groups showed no significant difference between median days to absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x10 9 /L and platelet >20 x10 9 /L after autologous stem cell transplantation. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the use of rituximab six months before PBSC might not affect the ability to collect an adequate number of PBSC for autologous stem cell transplantation in NHL. Further studies are warranted in larger populations to determine the impact of rituximab on PBSC collection and engraftment.",

Andreini, M. Sorio, A. Andreoli, M. Krampera, D. de Sabata, S. Ledro, R. Di Bella, F. Benedetti Bone Marrow Transplant Unit (Verona, I) The current treatment of newly diagnosed mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is based either on Rituximab-CHOP followed by SCT or Rituximab-HyperCVAD regimen. More recently good results were obtained with Rituximab combined with fludara containing regimens. Despite high remission rate, many authors are convinced that new drugs and new approaches are needed. Two years ago a long remission was described in a multicentric Italian study from Istituto Tumori in a group of 28 patients, using an aggressive sequential regimen with Rituximab in vivo purging and SCT at the end of therapy (Gianni AM, Blood, 102; 749, 2003) . The age limit for this study was 60 years. Methods: After this first study we continued to enroll in the same protocol all the patients with MCL referred to our Institution: 16 consecutive patients (3 females/13 males), median age 55 years (range 47-69), have completed the therapy. 13/16 are suitable for evaluation. All patients had advanced disease. For all the 13 patients we obtained a molecular marker (9 bcl-1/4 VDJ-IgH), useful for monitoring the response and to evaluate the stem cells collection. Results: Clinical and molecular CR was reached in all the patients. In all cases we tested by PCR analysis the stem cells, and we only used the PCR negative collections. In four cases the aphereses collected after Rituximab/cytoxan were PCR positive, so that we repeated stem cells collection after the following cycle with high dose ARA-C and Rituximab. At the transplant the stem cells were PCR negative in all the patients. Two episodes of bacterial infection, a sepsis and a pneumonia, were observed. At present 12/13 are alive (estimated OS >90%). One patient died because of heart failure due to myocardial infarction one year after transplant. One patient relapsed 14 months after treatment, and is currently on allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Follow-up has included clinical evaluation 4 times a year, bone marrow biopsy and molecular monitoring on marrow and peripheral blood cells twice a year: 11/13 are alive and in continuous CR (estimated PFS >80%), with a median follow-up of 30 months (range 7-74). Conclusions: This is considered an aggressive treatment, suitable for patients in good Performance Status, aged less than 60. In this group of patients we have increased the age of a decade, apparently without toxicity. The outcomes (remission rate, survival and the progression free survival) are comparable to those obtained in a younger cohort of patients with the same diagnosis.",

This toxicity may present as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and sudden death. QT dispersion reflects local differences in the repolarization of the myocardium. Increased QT dispersion has been shown to increase the risk of ventricular ar-rhythmias. We prospectively evaluated cardiac effects of high-dose CY in 30 adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients receiving CY with total dose of 6g/m\u00b2 as part of BEAC HDT regimen. Methods: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by radionuclide ventriculography and LVEF <50% Introduction: We undertook a retrospective analysis of patients (pts) with primary refractory or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) following LACE (Lomustine 200 mg/m\u00b2, Ara-C 4 g/m\u00b2, Cyclophosphamide 4.8 g/m\u00b2, Etoposide 1 g/m\u00b2) conditioning between 1991 and 2004. Patients: We analysed 67 pts (46m, 21f, median age at diagnosis 29y, range 15-67) with Hodgkin lymphoma. The predominant histology was nodular sclerosis (42), whilst disease stage at diagnosis was: stage I (2), stage II (29), stage III (22), stage IV (14). Pts. received the following firstline chemotherapy: ABVD or COP/ABVD (20), BEMOP-CA (29), COPP and similar (14) or mantle radiotherapy (4). Results: LACE and ASCT was undertaken in 45 pts in 1st relapse, in 16 pts in 2nd or higher relapse and in 6 pts in refractory disease. Median age at HDC was 32 y (range: 17 -70). Prior to ASCT 40 pts were in complete or partial remission, but 27 pts had less than partial response. There were 2 treatment related deaths in the first 100 days (3%). With a median follow-up of 43 months (range 1 -145) the probability of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) at 5 years was 72% and 69%, respectively. OS was not significantly different for patients who received ASCT in complete or partial remission (78%) when compared with the others (64%). In univariate analysis gender, age at diagnosis or at ASCT, extranodal disease, bulk or bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, initial treatment type, response to first line chemotherapy, duration of first remission, time from diagnosis to ASCT, number of treatment lines before ASCT and disease status at ASCT did not have an impact on OS. Histology at diagnosis (nodular sclerosis as favourable type, p<0.0001), stage at diagnosis (stage I or II vs stage III or IV, p=0.058) and haemoglobin (HGB) at ASCT (cut off 10 g/dl, p=0.022) had impact on OS. In multivariate analysis histology and HGB level at ASCT were independent risk factors for survival. The OS at 5 years of pts. with favourable histology and HGB at ASCT > 10 g/dl (26 pts.) was 91.3%. We conclude that LACE and ASCT is an effective salvage treatment for pts with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma and should be recommended for eligible patients independent of remission duration, number of relapses and disease status at ASCT.",

            "text": "Use of gemcitabine, cisplatin and methylprednisolone with or without rituximab in relapsed and refractory patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma B. Sirohi, D. Cunningham , A. Norman, M. Trumper, Y. Prior , K. Last, G. Chong, A. Horwich, A. Wotherspoon Royal Marsden Hospital (Sutton, UK) There is currently no standard salvage chemotherapy regimen in patients with relapsed/ refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We have previously shown that gemcitabine, cisplatin and methylprednisolone (GEM-P) is an effective salvage regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma; 10 patients in this study had DLBCL ( Br J Cancer 2005; 92:1352-7) . The aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of GEM-P in a larger subset of DLBCL patients. This has not been reported before. Between 1/01 and 3/05, 39 (10 patients had transformed lymphoma) heavily pre-treated relapsed and refractory DLBCL patients received GEM-P; 24 (61%) of these patients also received Rituximab (R). The median age was 49 y (range, 18-68); 28 males; 64% patients had Stage III/IV disease; 69% had IPI 2. The median time from diagnosis to start of GEM-P R was 17 mo (range, 2mo-7 yrs). All patients had previously received an anthracyclinebased regimen. The disease status at start of GEM-P R was: 24 patients were in 1st relapse, 7 had primary refractory disease, 5 were in 2nd relapse and 3 in 3rd relapse. Median number of cycles of GEM-P R received were 2 (range, 1-4). The overall response rate (RR) was 59% (95% CI 42. 1-74.4 ). 11 (28%) patients attained complete response, 12 partial response and 15 patients did not respond; 1 patient died of progressive disease. The median response duration to GEM-P R in 23 responding patients was 332 days (range, 36-1530) compared to 170 days (range, 26-2264) in 32 responding patients to 1st-line chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients who received R (not randomised ; given when available via NHS funding network) with GEM-P, the overall RR was 67% (95% CI 45-84) compared to 47% (95% CI 21-73) in those who did not receive R (P=0.2). Median PFS was 157 days and 3-y OS was 53.4%. Patients who received GEM-P with rituximab had a significant;y longer PFS compared to those who did not (P=0.03, 1-y PFS 51% vs 27%). 23 patients are alive at a median follow-up of 543 days (76-1598).In conclusion, GEM-P is an effective salvage regimen with long response duration in patients with relapsed or refrcatory DLBCL. The additional benefit with Rituximab on outcome warrants further studies in new and relapsed patients with DLBCL in a prospective, randomised trial. In 1999 we introduced as treatment for lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) the same regimen as used against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Norway (1) . Optionally, high dose treatment with autologous stem cell support (ASCT) could be given after 4 months of induction and consolidation, instead of 3.5 years of maintenance treatment. Induction therapy was vincristine, prednisone and asparaginase, with doxorubicine weekly for 3 weeks and cyclophosphamide weekly for 3 weeks. Consolidation was daunorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C) and 6-thioguanine (RAT) followed by highdose methotrexate (MTX) x 2 and continuous 6mercaptopurine for 7 weeks. Intrathecal MTX was given x 7. Stem cells were harvested after RAT. At our center, 17 patients (pt) (4 B-LL, 13 T-LL), median age 30 years (15-60), all Ann Arbor stages (I=2, II=2, III=1, IV=12) were included during 1999-2005. 3 pt were given other drugs for one course S241 prior to inclusion (1 prednisolone, 1 epirubicine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednison and 1 cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, vincristine, ifosphamide, cytarabine and teniposide ). 1 pt received enforced consolidation of MTX and Ara-C due to cranial nerve involvement and young age (15). Local radiotherapy was given to 10 of 17 pt at maximum of 30 Gy, usually after ASCT. All pt completed induction, consolidation and stem cell harvest. 1 pt progressed and died prior to ASCT. 16 received ASCT with BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan). 1 pt died due to ASCT-toxicity. 1 pt relapsed and died 2 years after ASCT. 14 of 17 pt (82%) are alive in first complete remission at a median follow up of 37 months compared to 66% reported using hyperCVAD (2). No secondary malignancies have been diagnosed. 1 female became pregnant and another pt has menstrual bleedings after finishing treatment (16 and 15 years old at inclusion). Conclusion: ASCT in combination with ALL-induction and consolidation therapy is feasible and results in 82% 3-year disease free and overall survival as first line treatment for adult lymphoblastic lymphoma. Several drug combinations are currently used as conditioning regimens for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The combination of ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) was used for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients (pts) who underwent ASCT in our Institution. We here analyse 33 consecutive autologous transplantations in DLBCL pts performed since March 1994. 21 pts were male, 12 female. Ann Arbor stage at diagnosis was I and II in 17 pts (51,1%) and III and IV 16 pts (48,5%); 20 pts (60,6%) suffered Bsymptoms; bulky disease was present in 16 pts (48,5%); performance status was 0-1 in 75,1%, 2 in 21,9%, 3 in one case. LDH value at diagnosis was evaluable in all but three patient; 60% had a pathologic LDH value. In the evaluable subset IPI at diagnosis was 0 in 7 pts; 1 in 12; 2 in 6; 3 in 5. First-line therapy was a third generation regimen in all but two patient, who were treated with a CHOP-like regimen. The median age at ASCT was 36 years (range 19-63); the median interval between diagnosis and ASCT was 10,6 months (range 3-65). 23 pts in first or subsequent complete remission at ASCT were considered as chemosensitive; the other 10 pts (partial remission or progressive/stable disease at ASCT) were considered as chemoresistant. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood in 29 pts; bone marrow in 3; both in a patient. ICE regimen included ifosfamide 3 g/sqm on days -6 to -3, carboplatin 500 mg/sqm and etoposide 300 mg/sqm X 2 on days -6 to -4. ICE regimen was well tolerated by most pts; two highly pretreated chemorefractory pts developed a multi-organ failure after the ASCT and died of toxicity. All pts had nausea and emesis, but only 3 needed total parenteral nutrition. The median time to engrafment for absolute neutrophil count was 11 days (range 9-18) and for platelets was 11 days (range 7-26). The median hospitalisation was 20 (range 18-27) days. The median time to treatment failure (TTF) was not reached after a mean observation time of 93 months. The actuarial overall survival (OS) after 5 years was 78%. At the univariate analysis only the disease status at ASCT was statistically associated with TTF and OS. These data show a good efficacy in term of TTF and OS. We observed a 100% TTF in chemosensitive disease, while disappointing outcomes were observed in chemorefractory pts. We can conclude that ICE is a safe and effective conditioning regimen for ASCT in DLBCL.",

Alessandrino IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, I) Between September 1986 and December 2000, 53 patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease were treated with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. We analyzed time to treatment failure, overall survival, treatment related complications and the occurrence of late events The median age of patients was 28 years ( range 13-58 ), 34 were males and 19 were females. Fifteen patients (Group A) were in second or subsequent CR, 29 patients (Group B) were with untreated relapse or resistant relapse, 10 patients (Group C) had primary refractory disease. All patients had received more than one line of therapy before transplant. Fifty-one pts were treated with Carmustine, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide (CVB) given at the total dose of 600 mg/m\u00b2, 30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg respectively followed by autologous transplant. Two patients with primary refractory disease received Thiotepa and Melphalan. The overall response rate was 67% at three months after transplant The overall survival was 50% at 16 years. The probability of relapse for patients achieving complete remission was 39%. The median time to relapse was 182 days (range 120-519 days). At present 28 patients are alive, 5 died of transplant complications including death for secondary malignancy. The actuarial probability of developing second cancer was 8,2% at ten years (one solid tumor and one myelodysplasia). Overall survival and probability of relapse or progression according to status at transplant was as follows: Group A 65% and 32% ; Group B 49% and 44%; Group C 20%; 76%. Conclusion: better results were observed in patients receiving transplant in CR; in patients with untreated relapse or resistant relapse, high dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant can lead to durable remission. In patients with primary resistant disease, due to the high post transplant relapse rate, other therapeutic strategies should be investigated. Although the majority of patients with advanced HL achieve durable remissions and cure with conventional therapy, a subset will fail to enter remission or will relapse after an initial response. In the last decade high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation has become the optimal therapy for this subgroup of patients. However, the superiority of megatherapy over conventional salvage strategies has not been proven in patients relapsing after a long first remission (i.e >1yr) or in patients with chemoresistant disease (partial remission <50%(PR), or primary refractory) and constitutes a matter of debate. Between 1992 and 2004, 54 patients with HL (males n=38, females n=16) with median age 31 years (17-58) were treated with megatherapy and autologus stem cell transplantation. Twelve (22%) had primary resistant disease, 40(74%) relapsed (17 <1yr, 23 >1yr) and two transplanted in first complete remission (CR) because of unfavorable clinical S242 characteristics(advanced stage, bulky disease). After salvage chemotherapy and before transplantation, 36 patients (67%) were evaluated as chemosensitive and 15 (28%) as chemoresistant. In thirty-three (61%)patients the conditioning regimen was CBV, in 18 (33%) BEAM and 3 received other combination. Twenty patients received bone morrow graft, 32 received peripheral blood and in 2 patients we administered both peripheral blood and bone morrow. Among 33 patients transplanted with residual disease (partial remission(PR), progressive disease), 25(78%) achieved CR, 3 PR and 3 were resistant. Two patients died of transplantrelated complications (TRM 3.7%). Among 25 complete responders, 10(40%) relapsed. Nineteen patients (35%) have died and 34(62%) are alive thirty of them (55%) in CR with a median follow-up of 97 months(16-129). One patient with progressive disease was lost in follow-up. The estimated 10year overall survival and event free survival(EFS) were 56% and 51.8% respectively. The difference in EFS was significantly better in chemosensitive group (66.4% vs 16.6%)(p<0.0001)( fig.1 ). Although longer follow-up is necessary to address ultimate cure rates and toxicity, these results from a single institution demonstrate the efficacy of high-dose therapy and autografting in refractory or recurrent HL. However, patients with chemoresistant disease before high dose therapy have a very poor prognosis.",

Jaksic Clinical Hospital Merkur (Zagreb, HR) The chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and the graft-versus-leukaemia/lymphoma effect after allogeneic stem cell transplantation have improved therapy of lymphatic malignancies dramatically during the last decade. In addition, successful therapy of chronic graft-versus-host disease after stem cell transplantation with rituximab has been published by one group. Other investigators correlated prolonged neutropenia after autologous stem cell transplantation to prior therapy with rituximab. To address the question, if rituximab pre-treatment prior to transplantation diminishes the graft versus lymphoma effect afterwards and can prolong engraftment of allogeneic haemopoiesis, we analysed retrospectively data from twentysix patients allografted for lymphoid malignancies. Seventeen patients had received at least one course of rituximab prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and nine did not. Both groups matched excellent for patients' characteristics. Preceding therapy with rituximab had no influence on eventfree survival (p=0,81), overall survival (p=0,87), or manifestation of acute (p=0,72) or chronic (p=0,50) graftversus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease had a significantly better event-free survival (p=0,04) and overall survival (p=0,03) comparing to patients without. Patients with rituximab pre-treatment reached 1 leukocyte/nl significantly faster than patients without prior rituximab therapy (11 days [median, range 1-18] vs. 15 days [median, range 12-20], p=0,025, Mann-Whitney U-test). Engraftment of thrombocytes (TC) occurred as well faster after rituximab pre-treatment. The differences were significant for all three steps [20TC/nl: 11 days (median, range 1-24) vs. 27 days (median, range 11-33) p=0,013; 50TC/nl: 15 days (median, range 11-37) vs. 41,5 days (median, range 22-70) p=0,013; 100TC/nl: 19 days (median, range 13-44) vs. 58,5 days (median, range 25-177) p=0,008; Mann-Whitney U-test]. The mechanism leading to faster engraftment remains unclear so far. In conclusion, this investigation gives no hint for a suppression of GvH and GvL effects by rituximab administration prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In addition, in contrast to results published for autologous stem cell transplantation, no detrimental effects on establishment of graft haemopoiesis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation by preceding rituximab therapy were found. Introduction: Children with B-cell NHL showing progression on the 1st and 2nd line chemotherapy have extremely poor prognosis as the patients with relapse of lymphoma. Highdose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can improve the outcome of these patients. Addition of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab) into \"the bag\" and after stem cell transfusion may decrease the risk of relapse by in vivo stem cell purging and adjuvant immunotherapy of MRD. Patients and methods: Since July 2000 to May 2005 8 patients (4 m, 4 f, median age 5(4-15)) with poor prognosis Bcell NHL -6 Burkitt, 1 BLCL and 1 with follicular DCL were included into the study. The indications for transplant wereresidual tumor mass after 4 cycles of intensive chemotherapy in 5 pts., early relapse in 1 patient, 2-nd relapse in 1 patient, progressive disease -1 patient). Five pts were pretreated with rituximab concomitantly with chemotherapy. Conditioning was with BEAM (BCNU, VP, cytosine arabinoside, melphalan) in 2 pts and Bu16,Cy,Vp in 6 pts. The stem cell sourse were peripheral blood cells (PBSC) mobilized with G-CSF alone. All patients have received Rituximab 375mg/m\u00b2 on day (-1), 50 mg in the bag and 375mg/m\u00b2 x 4 weekly after neutrophil recovery. Results: A median time to neutrophils recovery over 0,5x109/l was 18 days (8-30), and to platelets over 20x109/l -30 days (14-45). The main toxicity of conditioning were fever in 5pts (62%) (mean -3,8 days per febrile patient) and mucositis in 7 pts (87,5%). With a median follow-up of 2,5 year 7 pts are alive, all in CR. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) are 88% both. One patient transplanted in relapse progressed and died 2 month after transplant. There were no toxic deaths. Late effects. Two patients developed long lasting hypoimmunoglobulinemia and remain on IVIG transfusions at 42 and 26 mo. In 5 hypoimmunoglobulinemia resolved by 12 months after transplant. Conclusion: Rituximab is well tolerated in the scheme in HDT and ASCT and may have additional role in the treatment of children with high-risk lymphoma.",

            "text": "Remission of EBV associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disease confined to the brain after intravenously administered rituximab G. Stuhler (1) Background: Post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a serious complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation that can be controlled by anti CD20 antibody rituximab. In striking contrast, the treatment for PTLD confined to the brain is not established and current modalities reach from high dose chemotherapy to anti-viral drugs with limited efficiency. Patient: We report on a patient who developed progressively growing cerebral lesion in the postcentral region 2 years after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor for mantle cell lymphoma stage IIIA. The diagnosis of post transplant lympho-proliferative disease (PTLD) confined to the brain was established by biopsy. Expression of CD20 on all transformed cells within the lesion and antigens associated with EBV latency program III was S244 confirmed by immunohistochemistry. After 4 cycles of intravenous treatment with rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2, a dramatic improvement of the neurological status was observed and MRI showed a remission with resolution of the contrastenhancing lesion. A small but significant population of CD8 positive T cells with specificity for EBV LMP2a but not LMP1 could be demonstrated after but not before rituximab therapy utilizing tetrameric peptide:HLA complexes and flow cytometry techniques. Conclusion: The clinical course of our patient with PTLD shows that rituximab given intravenously might be an effective therapy for EBV-triggered lymphoma of the CNS after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The data indicate that sufficient amount of antibody penetrate the disrupted blood brain barrier and the nodular lesion observed here. The therapeutic effect appears to be limited to lesions with CD20 expression on all transformed cells. The inability of the host immune system to control PTLD was demonstrated. Methods: In this single center phase-II prospective study, high-dose therapy (HDC) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APSCT) was done during the first remission following induction and consolidation therapy for 18 patients with Burkitt (n: 5) and LL (n: 13) without bone marrow and central nervous system involvement at presentation. Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, adriamycin with or without L-asparaginase induction regimen was followed by dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin consolidation therapy with total body irradiation and cyclophoshamide conditioning. Results: Mean patient age was 24.6 (range: 21-55) years and male to female ratio was 5 to1. 44% (8/18) of the patients were in the intermediate and high-risk groups of International Prognostic Index. Median treatment duration until APSCT was 104 days (range: 87-128). 83% and 17% of the patients were in complete and partial remission before transplantation. One patient with Burkitt lymphoma out of 5 (20%) and 6 patients with LL out of 13 (46%) have died of progression. Overall survival (OS) at 113-month follow-up for all patients was 59.03% with 59.26% of disease-free survival (DFS). However, LL cases revealed OS and DFS rates of 50.35% and 50.77%, respectively. Only one early death (5.5%) was noted due to liver toxicity following HDC and APSCT. Conclusion: In conclusion, this single center phase-II study reveals an acceptable toxicity, short treatment period and high survival rate in adult Burkitt and LL cases, suggesting APSCT to be a good treatment option in the first remission. The optimal approach for patients (pts) with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HD) who do not achieve a complete remission (CR) or relapse after induction therapy is still not definite. Conventional schemes produce few second CR; recently the German Hodgkin Study Group produced good results with high-dose sequential chemotherapy (HDST) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in this subset of pts. Since March 2002 to August 2005 15 pts were enrolled in this study in our Institution. The schedule was constituted by a first phase (2 cycles of DHAP), a second phase (cyclophosphamide 4g/sqm, methotrexate 8 g/sqm, etoposide 2g/sqm every 14 days) and an ASCT with BEAM conditioning. All phases but the ASCT one were delivered on outpatient basis. After the first phase a CT evaluation was performed to assess the chemosensibility: pts not achieving at least a partial response (PR) according to Cheson were considered off-study.Pts underwent leukapheresis after cyclophosphamide, and G-CSF 5 microg/Kg was administered from day +5 until collection. Pts status at the enrolment were: 7 relapsed within an year after the obtainment of CR; 6 refractory to the induction therapy (ABVD); 2 refractory to conventional salvage treatment for relapse occurred after 9 years. Characteristics of the pts at diagnosis were: median age (range) 28 years (19-42); 8 pts were female; 7 had B symptoms; ECOG performance status were 0 in 10 pts, 1 in four, 2 in one. All pts received the two cycles of DHAP without delays: after this phase 6 pts were excluded, 4 for stable/progressive disease, 2 for not achieving a PR (late relapsed pts: both are still alive with disease). The other nine pts completed the therapy according to the schedule; after the ASCT all of them were in CR with negative PET scans. A CR patient developed a myelodisplasia 13 months after the ASCT, shortly evolved in an acute leukaemia; this patient died because of acute graft versus host disease after a salvage allogeneic transplantation. The other eight CR pts are still without disease after a median observation of 667 days (range 82-1124). HDST is an effective therapy for treatment of relapsed and refractory HD pts. A longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the toxicity, especially the long-term myelotoxicity, and the real curative efficacy of this approach, which looks better in the relapsed pts.",

The results reported by Gianni et al. with high dose sequential therapy (HDST) showed a significant improvement of Overall Survival (OS) and Event Free Survial (EFS) in comparison with a standard chemotherapy. We decided to use this therapy adding an intensified scheme in the debulking phase. The first phase was constitued by an intensified CHOP (MegaCHOP): cyclophosphamide 3 g/sqm; doxorubicin 75 mg/sqm; oncovin 1,4 mg/sqm on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg for 5 days. Stem cells collection was planned after the third cycle. The second phase was: cyclophosphamide 4 g/sqm, methotrexate 8 g/sqm and VP16 2 g/sqm. The third phase was the peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) with melphalan 180 mg/sqm and mitoxantrone 60 mg/sqm as conditioning regimen. Inclusion criteria were: large B-cell lymphoma, age less than 50 years and intermediatehigh with bulky or high risk IPI. From March 2002 until February 2004 we enrolled 11 pts. Median age was 39 years (range 25-49), 8 pts were stage III-IV (73%), 7 presented bulky disease (64%), 9 pts had a WHO performance status 0-1 (82%), all but one had an abnormal LDH value. Four pts performed the first cycle with MegaCHOP as inpatients. All other cycles and the phase II were performed on outpatient basis. At the end of planned therapy 9 pts obtained a complete remission (CR) (82%), a patient after radiotherapy was alive with disease and one died of progressive disease during phase I. After first phase six pts obtained a very good partial remission (PR), after phase II six were in CR unconfirmed and 4 were in PR. After PBSCT 8 pts were in CR and 2 were in PR, one of this obtained a CR after mediastinal radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 28 months (range 6-41) OS was 81%. Two pts died: one for progressive disease and one after relapse. With a median follow-up of 25 months 88% of complete remission pts were free from disease and only one patient relapsed after 2 months from CR. We did not find grade III or IV WHO extrahaematological toxicity. We can conclude that this protocol is feasible as outpatient basis in phases I and II. Moreover, this therapy was highly effective (81% OS) in a subset of pts with very high risk characteristics at diagnosis. Rituximab could further improve these results and could also be used in pts with involvement of bone marrow at diagnosis.",

            "text": "Purpose: Refractoriness to platelet transfusions in patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning with consecutive hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplantation may represent a major problem in clinical management especially in case of immunization against frequent antigens. We report a case of a patient from Oman with an aggressive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and a refractoriness to platelet transfusions solely caused by a Naka antibody. Case Report: A 36-year-old male patient with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a history of previous chemotherapy and transfusions underwent mobilization chemotherapy with CD20 antibody rituximab and ICE combination chemotherapy. In aplasia surprisingly refractoriness to platelet transfusions (1 pool and 3 single donor apheresis platelet units) was observed.The patient's platelet count recovered spontaneously without bleeding complications and a sufficient number of HPC for transplantation could be harvested. Examinations of the patient's serum with enzyme immunoassays (GTI-PAK PLUS\u00ae) revealed an iso-antibody against CD36 (glycoprotein IV(GP IV)). Flow cytometric analyses showed that CD36 was absent on monocytes as well as on platelets suggesting a type I deficiency of CD36. In Europe GP IV-typed suitable donor were not available for the planned autologous HPC transplantation. Samples of six relatives living in Oman (2 siblings, 4 nephews) were shipped to Germany, tested, and 5/6 were found to be GP IV negative. Two relatives traveled to Germany and served as platelet donors. The patient was conditioned with BEAM and received 12.2E+06 CD34+ cells/kg. Due to infectious complications and a severe mucositis the patient was transfused with 9 single donor platelet units to maintain a platelet count > 10,000/\u00b5L in peripheral blood. On day +10 after transplant, leukocyte engraftment was observed and on day +17, the platelet count exceeded 50,000/\u00b5L without transfusion support. Conclusions: In patients with an ethnic background different from the European, investigations to elucidate refractoriness of platelet transfusions should include HLA antibodies, alloantibodies against HPA, and rare antibodies such as an anti-CD36. For patients with an anti-CD36 antibody, the most promising strategies to find suitable donors is to search among relatives or to search in countries with a higher prevalence of CD36 deficiency such as in Asia. Immunophenotyping for CD36 may be a rapid and helpful diagnostic tool in such instances.",

            "text": "Treatment with Rituximab followed by autologous stem cell transfusion is an increasingly frequent association for treating non Hodgkin lymphomas either in first line or relapse. In a retrospective study, 166 (60.5%) patients treated between 1998 to 2003 who received Rituximab before transplantation (R-group) are compared to 108 (39.5%) patients Rituximab naive who underwent ASCT between 1994 to 1997 (Non-R group). We analyze the impact of Rituximab with that well known factors associated with or without successful mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (lines of chemotherapy before transplantation, Fludarabine alone or associated therapy, bone marrow involvement) and with engraftment kinetics (number of CD34+ cells infused). For the study we divided patients from R and non-R group in 3 groups according to the richness of the collect: a low group with less than 2.5.106CD34+ cells/kg, a high group with greater or equal than 10.106CD34+ cells/kg and a standard group between 2.5 and 10 CD34+/kg harvested. In term of mobilisation, for the entire population, median CD34+ collected was 4,4.106 CD34+/kg (0,51-128). Fludarabine and number of previous treatment had a significantly negative impact on the harvest; 28, 5% of the patients previously treated by fludarabine are represented in the low group (p=0,008). When we compared R and non R group, we did'nt show any statistically difference in term of total number of CD34+ (p=0.373) but a significant difference in the repartition of patients between the three selected CD34+ groups (p<0.001). In term of engraftment, haematological recovery was significantly influenced by the richness of graft with a rapid recovery of neutrophils in the high group versus the two others (p<0,001) and a delay to obtain platelets>50000/mm\u00b3 in the low and standard groups versus the high (22 days, 15 days and 12) (p <0,001). We show a significant delay to neutrophils recovery in the R group (12 days vs 11 days) versus Non-R group (p= 0.0022) but no difference in term of Therapeutic use of cord blood (CB) is limited by low numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). We developed a clinical system to expand CB HPCs using interleukin-6 (10 ng/ml), stem cell factor (50 ng/ml), Flt3 ligand (50 ng/ml) and thrombopoietin (10 ng/ml), in serum-free medium and 10% AB allogeneic plasma. After immunoselection (CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec), CD34+ cells are cultured for 2 weeks and the cytokines replaced twice a week. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of this experimental approach, we developed a phase I/II trial based on allogeneic transplantation of expanded CB HPCs. For safety reasons, only 1/3 of the CB unit is thawed, immunoselected and expanded. The negative fraction after CD34+ selection, that contains the T-cell component of the graft is thereafter transplanted, together with the unmanipulated and expanded cells. Three children, affected by thalassemia, sickle cell disease and refractory anemia with excess of blasts respectively, were given ex vivo expanded CD34+ cells from an HLA-identical sibling. The first patient, a 6-year-old boy with thalassemia, was given 2 CB units derived from 2 HLA-identical fraternal (i.e. non syngeneic) twins (1 unmanipulated CB unit and 1 CB unit infused after ex vivo expansion). CD34+ cells were cultured for 2 weeks in class B, ISO 6 laboratories. The mean+SD fold expansion of CD34+ cells were 48\u00b115. The expanded grafts included 11.7\u00b11.8x10 6 CD34+, 1.8\u00b10.7x10 6 CD61+ cells and had a low lymphocyte content (CD3+ cells 2.5\u00b11.3x10 4 ). The neutrophil and platelet engraftment time was 18\u00b13 and 32\u00b18 days respectively. In the first patient, chimerism evaluation showed the presence of erythroid and myeloid colonies derived from the ex vivo expanded cells up to 7 months after CBT; T cells deriving from the expanded unit were present at various time points after the allograft, as well. The patients are alive and well at 16, 9 and 6 months from transplantation. These results demonstrate that CB HPCs, safely and efficiently expanded with our system, can contribute to sustain hematopoietic recovery after CBT.",

We, in Korea, performed about 200 cases of CBSCT until May, 2005 and banked about 80,000 units of CB for public purposes, 170,000 units for private purposes. However, until yet we do not have had any national guideline nor regulations for CB banking to qualify the CB banks and assess the quality of stored CBs. We organized the Cord Blood Committee in the Korean Society of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation at March, 2002. Based on the political research reports of our committee, the Ministry of Health and Welfare officially noticed the national guideline for CB banking on August, 2005. Also, the legislation was just drafted in the National Assembly by about 30 members of National Assembly. The essentials of the legislation drafted in this year are as follows: The purchase and sale of CB is prohibited (Article 3). The Cord Blood Committee is consisted in the Ministry of Health and Welfare to review the overall items regarding quality control as well as safety of CB. (Article 4) . The CB bank associates should get permission to establish CB banks from an Administrator of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (Article 5). The Administrator of the Ministry of Health and Welfare could establish or assign public CB banks to manage donated CBs (Article 6). The Public Cord Blood Data Center should be established to manage the informations regarding donated CBs, and to coordinate and supply CBs (Article 7). Mother, spouse or legal deputy should assign to permit CB collection and could abandon their consent at any time before collection (Article 8). The CB banks should adhere to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and provide donated cord bloods to the transplantation centers with nonprofit program (Article 11). The CB bank associates should keep the documents regarding CB banking until 10 years after releasing cryopreserved CB (Article 15, 16) . The government could provide budgets for public CB banking and networking projects, even the CB banks could claim the appropriate banking fees for private CBs (Article 27). Based on this statute, we could establish the National Public Cord Blood Banks as well as Networking System to supply the qualified CBs for domestic as well as foreign patients.",

Kato, Y. Matsuhashi, T. Kawano, Y. Oota, E. Kusumi, T. Matsumura, N. Uchida, A. Wake, A. Yoneyama, S. Morinaga, S. Taniguchi Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Introduction: Haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a rare but fatal complication after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). There has been only a few case reports after HSCT and little information on it.It is widely accepted that transplantation using umbilical cord blood has lower engraftment rate than other stem-cell sources. Recently we have reported high incidence of HPS after reduced-intensity umbilical cord blood transplantation (RI-CBT) (2005 ASH annual meeting, #2743). We hypothesized that HPS played significant role in engraftment failure after RI-CBT. Objective, Patient and Methods: The purpose of this report is to study the causes of engraftment failure after RI-CBT. We reviewed medical records of 109 adult patients with advanced hematological diseases who received RI-CBT between January 2004 and October 2005 at Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Median age of the patients was 53 years old (23-69). Most of the preparative regimens were fludarabine phosphate 125 mg/m\u00b2, melphalan 80 mg/m\u00b2 and TBI 4 Gy. Tacrolimus was used as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in most of the cases. The median number of infused total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34 positive cells was 2.65*10 7 cells/kg (1.67-5.24 ) and 0.65*10 5 cells/kg (0.11-3.90), respectively. Most of the donor-recipient pairs had serological mismatches at 2 HLA loci. Engraftment failure was defined as following; an absolute neutrophil count not exceeding 0.5*10 9 /L by day 21 after transplant. The diagnosis of HPS was S247 made with the followings; prolonged high grade fever, cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and liver dysfunction with histopathological evidence of increased activated histiocytes and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow. Results: Fifteen patients were diagnosed as engraftment failure after RI-CBT (13.8 %). Of 15 patients, 10 had the features of HPS (66.7 %). Among these, sepsis had preceded in 9 patients. Median interval from transplant to the diagnosis of HPS was 21 days (14-28). Of 10 patients with HPS, 8 were dead before engraftment. The remaining two patients were successfully treated with high-dose steroid. All of 7 patients without HPS died due to infection. Conclusion: HPS may play a major role in engraftment failure after RI-CBT. Since steroid therapy appears to be effective to some patients, an early diagnosis of HPS and prompt initiation of steroid could improve the outcome.",

Traineau, V. Hubert, H. Esperou, C. Dosquet, J.P. Marolleau, G. Socie, E. Gluckman, M. Benbunan Hopital Saint-Louis (Paris, F) Cord blood (CB) is increasingly used as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells and the nucleated cell (NC) dose plays a key role in engraftment and survival. In 78 CB transplanted to 74 patients (median age 10 yo; range 1.5-44; median weight 32kg; range 10-90), we analyzed NC, CD34+ and CFU-GM recovery and viability. The impact of pre-and post-thaw cell dose on neutrophil recovery was analyzed. The median delay of cryopreservation was 1151 days (22-3145). Before cryopreservation, median NC, CD34+ and CFU-GM were respectively 1.84x10 9 (0.84-9.22), 5,43x10 6 (0.5-42) and 10x10 5 P894 Evaluation of viability in post thawed leukapheresis and cord blood units by flow cytometry G.L. Viarengo, C. Perotti, L. Bellotti, C. Parisi, A. Marchesi, V. Galiazzo, P. Bergamaschi, C. Del Fante, L. Salvaneschi Policlinico S. Matteo (Pavia, I) Objectives: Nowadays the role of flow cytometry in oncohematology is central. Detection of cell viability on cryopreserved stem cells (peripheral and cord blood) before chemoablative conditioning regimens needs more reliable methods. Herein we attempted to assess cell viability in post thawing samples by flow cytometry. Methods: 81 samples (55 leukapheresis, 26 cord blood) obtained from vials stored together with the cryopreserved units were diluted, immediately after thawing, with a PBS solution to 1:10 rate.The samples were promptly stained with anti CD45 FITC and anti CD34 III class PE MoAbs (BeckmanCoulter), then incubated at 4\u00b0C in darkness for 15' in TrueCount tubes (BD Biosciences) with a known number of beads to have an absolute single platform cell count. Samples were added with lysing solution and stained again with 7AAD (BeckmanCoulter). Flow cytometry analysis was performed immediately by BD Biosciences FACSCalibur according to S248 EWGGCA recommendations, that allow to obtain a single platform data of viability both on CD45 and CD34 positive cells. A comparison with Trypan Blue test on post thawing samples and pre-freezing short term cultures was assessed on every sample. Results: Mean viability assessed by flow cytometry in the leukapheresis group was 61,3% (range: 37,3-89,7), while in the cord blood group was 64,1%, (range: 39,3-81). Viability on CD45 positive cells was worse than on CD34 positive cells (61,3% versus 74%). Mean viability on leukapheresis samples, calculated by Tripan Blue test, was 80% (range: [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] , while on cord blood samples was 72% (range: 65-77). Clonogenic assays on pre-freezing samples showed an adequate CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-MIX growth for all samples seeded both in cord blood and leukapheresis group. Conclusion: Data obtained by flow cytometry analysis are not representative of the real stem cell viability because of the negative influence exerted by DMSO on stem cells during the sample thawing. Samples analysed post thawing by flow cytometry do not reflect the real status of stem cells inside the cryopreservation bag. At moment flow cytometry analysis of stem cells viability in post thawed leukapheresis and cord blood units is not reccommended. Post thawing tripan blue test together with pre-freezing short term cultures still remain the most representative test for clinicians involved in stem cell transplantation.",

While expression of the transporter protein ABCG2 has been strongly implicated in the SP phenotype of bone marrow stem cells, relatively little is known about the SP in umbilical cord blood. The aim of this study was to establish a multi-channel FACS analysis procedure to determine the relationship between the side population phenotype and the expression of surface markers (CD45, CD34, CD133, ABCG2) in mononuclear cells from both fresh and cryopreserved umbilical cord blood. Methods: Mononuclear cells were prepared from fresh and cryopreserved umbilical cord blood, exposed to Hoechst 33342 for 2 hours, then stained with antibodies. Two-colour detection of the SP phenotype was then combined with fourcolour FACS analysis, forward and side scatter using a BD FACS Vantage to enable simultaneous detection of all relevant markers. Gene expression in sorted cell populations was determined by qRT-PCR. Results: SP cells were readily detectable in both fresh and cryopreserved blood, with a higher relative frequency following cryopreservation (0.78% versus 0.21%). While between 9.5% and 24% of the side population expressed either CD34 or CD133, the majority of the CD34+ and CD133+ cells were found outside the side population. There were no differences in either the relative frequencies or the distribution of CD34 and C D133 cells between fresh and cryopreserved blood. Both FACS and qRT-PCR analysis showed ABCG2 expression to be selectively absent from the SP cells. Conclusions: The SP of umbilical cord blood is heterogenous, but contains a subpopulation of the CD34+ and CD133+ cells. The SP as a whole appears to have a survival advantage during cryopreservation and recovery. The side population phenotype of umbilical cord blood is not attributable to ABCG2 expression.",

Quah Children's Medical Institute (Singapore, SGP) Reduced intensity conditioning (\"transplant-lite\") with dual unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation was reported by the Minnesota group to be a feasible alternative for adult patients with haematological malignancies. The same strategy, if applied to children with very high risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (VHR ALL), may provide several advantages to conventional transplants, principally in ensuring engraftment, reducing transplant-related mortality, severe acute GVHD and relapse. We piloted this strategy in 4 children (median age, 9.5; range, 6.4-13.4 years) with VHR risk ALL. The preparative regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg, fludarabine 200mg/m\u00b2, 200cGy TBI +/-ATG as per Barker et. al. (Blood 2003) . UCB grafts were 0-2 HLA antigen mismatched with the recipient and contained a median cryopreserved total nucleated cell dose of 7.4 (range, 6.8-8.0) x 10 7 /kg and CD34 cell dose of 2.5 (range, 1.9-2.7) x 10 5 / kg recipient body weight. GVHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. The cumulative incidence of engraftment was 100%. The median day of sustained neutrophil recovery (\u2265 0.5x10 9 /L for 3 days) was 10 (range, 6-12) days. The median day to achieving platelet engraftment (>50 x10 9 /L) and red blood cell transfusion independence were 73 (range, 31-175) and 30 (range, 0-77) days, respectively. All patients achieved 100% donor chimera by molecular studies at a median of 43 (range, 22-68) days. All patients developed steroid responsive acute GVHD of skin (grade II -III) at a median of 27 (range, 21-32) days. Herpes viruses re-activation was the only complication in heavily pre-treated, sero-positive patients. One patient relapsed on day 147 and achieved a 2nd remission on palliative chemotherapy. The average duration of hospital stay was 28 (range, 16-60) days. All patients are alive at a median follow-up of 203 (range, 84-301) days. These data demonstrated that \"transplant-lite\" with dual UCB is extremely safe and effective in grafting children with VHR ALL. Longer follow-up is required to evaluate relapse risks, graft-versusleukaemia and late effects. While long-term disease-free survival needs to be further determined, in comparison to conventional transplants, this strategy is superior in its toxicity profile and may eventually translate into overall life and costsavings.",

Grifols, A. Oriol, E. Feliu, J.M. Ribera ICO-H. Germans Trias i Pujol (Badalona, E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a well-known complication that may develop after hematopoietic progenitor transplantation (HPT) and seems to be related to immunosuppressive treatment (usually cyclosporine), chemotherapy, infectious events or GVHD. We present the first two reported cases of systemic TTP following unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT). Both cases were conditioned with thymoglobulin, cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and busulfan. GVHD prophylaxis was performed with cyclosporine and prednisone. Case 1: A 35-year-old male was diagnosed with Phi+ ALL in May 2003. He received an unrelated cord blood HPT when in 2nd CR in May 2004. He developed acute GVHD grade III involving the skin and gastrointestinal tract and was treated with prednisone 2 mg/kg/d and mycophenolate mofetil. He suddenly presented drowsiness and CT scan was negative. There was a sudden drop in platelet count and hemoglobin.From July 1995 to September 2005, 30 patients with high risk ALL aged < 18 years, underwent cord blood transplantation (CBT) from unrelated, <2 antigens HLA mismatched donors. Twenty patients were in < 2nd complete remission (CR), 10 in more advanced phase. Conditioning regimen (12 Gy f-TBI, Etoposide, CTX and anti-lymphocyte serum), GVHD prophylaxis (CsA and 6-methylprednisolone), infectious disease prevention and supportive therapy were identical for all patients. The median number of infused nucleated cell and CD34+ cells/Kg were 3.7x107and 3.4x105/Kg of the recipient body weight, respectively. The median number of infused CFU-GM was 1.9x104/Kg of recipient body weight. The cumulative incidence of engraftment was 88% (95%CI:0.78-0.85). The cumulative incidence of acute-GVHD (III-IV grade) and chronic-GVHD was 4% (95%CI: 0.03-0.36) and 33% (95%CI: 0.07-0.48), respectively. At a median follow-up of 15 months (range 2-117) after transplant ,16 patents are dead and 14 patients are alive and disease free (median f-up 69 months) with full donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence of TRM and relapse at 7 years is 33% (95%CI:0.13-0.45) and 32%(95%CI:0.26-0.67), respectively. The 7-year probabilities of overall survival (OS), leukaemia-free-survival (LFS) and event-free-survival (EFS)were43%(95%CI:0.52-0.93),47%(95%CI:0.25-.41)and46%(95%CI:0.33-0.61) respectively. In univariate analysis, the only factor negatively affecting outcomes was the CFU-GM for the cut-off dose of < 1x104/Kg of recipient body weight. Conclusions: CBT is a valid option in the treatment of high risk ALL young patients who lack of a compatible donor. The cell dose expressed as CFU-GM is predictive of outcomes and should be considered in selecting cord blood units for transplant.",

Barfield, R. Hayden, J. Knowles, F. Behm, S. Shurtleff, V. Turner, R. Handgretinger St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, USA) Conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has historically used ablative regimens, which can cause severe toxicity and mortality, especially in highly pre-treated patients. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens (RICR) for partially HLA-matched transplants have not been widely explored. In 2 simultaneous prospective trials, we transplanted 34 patients with hematologic malignancies using peripheral blood grafts from mismatched family members depleted of T cells with immunomagnetic beads targeting CD3+ cells, and containing high doses of CD34+ cells. 22 patients in RICR group (mean age 10yrs) had refractory diseases and received fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan and OKT3 without TBI and ATG. Mycophenolate mofetil was used for GvHD prophylaxis. 12 patients in conventional conditioning regimen (CCR) group (mean age 11 yrs)received TBI (12 Gy), cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, ATG and OKT3 with cyclosporine GvHD prophylaxis. Monthly analysis of immune reconstitution included TREC, VBeta spectratyping and lymphocyte immunophenotyping. Weekly monitoring of blood by PCR for adenovirus, EBV, or CMV DNA was performed. After HSCT, 91% (20/22) RICR pts achieved full donor chimerism compared with 92% (11/12)of CCR pts. 2/22 (9%) RICR pts developed grade 3-4 acute GvHD compared to 0/12 CCR pts. Only 5 pts (all in RICR group) developed chronic GvHD. Reactivation of 1 or more viruses occurred in 16/22 (73%) RICR pts compared to 11/12 (92%) CCR pts. During the first 2 months after HSCT, all Tcell(CD3+, CD4+, CD8+)populations were decreased in both groups with the RICR groups having levels 25-73 times greater than the CCR group (p<0.0086). At one month after HSCT, NK cells were 4 times higher in the RICR group (p=0.01); NK cells remained 1.6 to 4 times higher in the RICR group for the entire 1st year. B cells in both groups were normal by 3 months post-HSCT. TREC counts were below normal pre-HSCT in 13/22(59%)RICR pts and in 5/12 (42%)CCR pts. TCR repertoire was significantly greater at 3 months post-HSCT in the RICR group(p=0.092). This welltolerated RICR approach led to more rapid reconstitution of Tcells, early re-emergence of TREC numbers with early recovery of TCR repertoire diversity, more rapid NK cell number increase rapidly leading to a reduced incidence and duration of viral infections with less GvHD compared to CCR. This approach offers the possibility of improved anti-cancer immune effect with less regimen-related toxicity. During the past decade, transplantation of highly purified peripheral haploidentical stem cells has become a well established treatment procedure in many children with malignant and non malignant diseases. Positive enrichment of peripheral stem cells by anti-CD34 or CD133 magnetic micro S251 beads provides a graft profoundly depleted of T and B cells facilitating engraftment without inducing severe GVHD. However, despite transplanting \"mega doses\" (>10 6 /kgBW) of positive enriched stem cells, primary graft rejection and, delayed immune recovery associated with increased transplant related mortality remained major obstacles for the success of this therapeutic approach. As reported before, primary engraftment could be achieved in 88% and after reconditioning in 100% of 27 children with ALL transplanted with \"mega-doses\" (median: 16.4E6/kgBW; range 5.4-50.4) of positive enriched stem cells from their HLA-haploidentical parents. All patients received G-CSF post transplant and achieved more than 500 ANC/\u00b5l 12 days post transplant (range, 8-24) . All patients achieved more than 100 CD3+ and CD4+ cell/\u00b5l after median time of 67 and 101 days, respectively. Three year EFS of patients transplanted in remission (n=21) was 0.43 (+ 0.11). In contrast to positive selection of stem cells, grafts after depletion of CD3/CD19 cells consist of remarkable amounts of effector cells. These effector cells are expected to facilitate engraftment, shorten the time of immune reconstitution and may also provide anti tumour activity. Here we report on our experience with 10 children (ALL, n=4; AML, n=2; rhabdomyosarcoma, n=2 and aplastic anaemia, n=2) receiving CD3/CD19 depleted peripheral stem cell grafts (median number of 10.6E6/kgBW CD 34+ cells (range, 4.6-20.0)). Grafts also contained NK-cells (median number: 17.19E6/kgBW), dendritic cells, precursor T-cells and monocytes/granulocytes (median number: 446.45E6/kgBW). Without the administration of G-CSF, all 10 patients achieved rapid and sustained engraftment with more than 500 ANC/\u00b5l and more than 20.000/\u00b5l thrombocytes at day 16.5 and 16.75, respectively. All patients showed a complete chimerism post transplant at day 28. Median time to achieve more than 100 CD3+ and CD4+ cells/\u00b5l was 51.0 and 53.5 days, respectively. Nine out of 10 children are alive and well, one patient died on day +156 post transplant of relapsed AML.",

Hernandez-Navarro Hospital Universitario La Paz (Madrid, E) Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) represents several genetically distinct congenital birth defects what are an important cause of childhood mortality and is a time pediatric emergency. Is the focus of active investigation using altenative stem cell sourcer for most patients took matched sibling donors. We report our experience in nine cases of SCID that were underwent to haploidentical transplant in our centre. Median age at transplant was 16,6 months, (range 7m to 48m). The median follow up period is 50, 5 months (range 1-113), and SCID consecutive cases are described in table. All of them were transplant from haploidentical family donors from peripheral mobilized HLA-mismatched CD34 progenitors isolated. The separation of CD34+ cells from leukapheresis products was achieved in almost all patients (7/9) by the Clinimacs System (Miltenyi) with a CD34+ cell purity range of 93-98% and range of yield of 64% to 97%. The mean value of peripheral CD34+ cells infused was 28.6 x 106/kg (range 5,05-44,31) and the mean CD3+ cells number was 1,24 x 105/kg (range 0,15-2,17) with mean 4,09 log T cell-depletion ( range 3.63-4.64), the remaining patients (2/9) we used Ceprate and Isolex 300 system (Baxter) respectively. Conditioning regimen was undergone in five patients, only one case received prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with cyclosporine (patient n\u00ba 1). Survival rate was 47% and at least all of patients survived from 1 month to 14 months posttransplantation and also engraftment achieved in almost all treated patients(7/9 =74,8%) between day +15 to +20.Skin GVHD (grade I) was seen in only two patients. Causes of death were: two cases of graft rejection that needed a second transplant and finally they had a metabolic acidosis and lung bleeding respectively, one VOD, and two sepsis. We concluded that the engraftment achieved in almost all treated patients, and the acceptable conditioning-related toxicity suggests that this approach could be successfully applied to children affected by SCID who otherwise have no suitable donors.

Martelli University of Perugia (Perugia, I) Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a onehaplotype mismatched donor offers an immediate source of HSCs to almost all leukemia patients who urgently need an allogeneic transplantation because of the high-risk of relapse and who do not have a matched avaible donor. Over the past decade, our group has shown the two major obstacles to mismatched transplants, that is severe acute GVHD in T-cellreplete transplants and graft rejection in T-cell-depleted transplants, can be overcome by infusing a megadose of extensively T-cell-depleted HSCs after an immuno-myeloablative conditioning regimen. Here we report results in 56 AML (25 CR1, 21 CR2, 10 CR>2), 34 ALL (17 CR1, 15 CR2, 2 CR>2) and 10 CML (6 CP, 4 AP) who have been transplanted since 1999 when we started selecting peripheral blood CD34+ cells by the clinimacs instrument which ensures a 4.5 log T-cell depletion in a one-step procedure. Conditioning consisted of single dose TBI, thiotepa, fludarabine and rabbit ATG. T-cell depletion was the sole prophylaxis of GvHD. Median age was 35 (range 11-59) years. Early stages included CR1, CR 2, first and second chronic phase of CML; intermediate stages were CR>2 and accelerated phase CML. All CR1 acute leukemia were at high risk of relapse because unfavorable prognostic factors (cytogenetics in 21, secondary leukemia in 9, others in 9); the 10 CML, who were imatinib and/or INF resistant, have received the transplant more than 3 years from diagnosis. Full-donor engraftment was achieved in 99% of patients including 4 who needed secondary transplants. Without a post-transplant immunosuppression, probability of acute grade II-IV GvHD and chronic GvHD was 5% and 6%, respectively. 36 patients died of non-leukemic cause, 17 of leukemia relapse, 47 survive disease-free at a median follow-up of 38 months (range 2-83). Probability of EFS was 0.32, 0.48 and 0.66 for early ALL, AML and CML, respectively; it was 0.0, S252 0.48 and 0.50 for the intermediate ALL, AML and CML, respectively. Of the 6 CML patients, only 3 required DLI because of cytogenetic relapse; the other are in molecular remission 8, 57 and 81 months since transplantation. HSCT from a mismatched family member can be offered as a viable option to candidates with high risk acute leukemia and with imatinib-resistant CML before diseases progress to more advanced phases.",

Naveed, S. Kangarloo, M. Geddes, D. Quinlan, J. Russell Alberta Blood Cell & BMT Program (Calgary, CAN) An isocratic High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) method was successfully developed in order to quantify Busulfan (Bu) levels in human plasma by detection of its chemical derivative 1,4-bis(diethyldithiocarbamoyl butane). The concentration of drug in human plasma was measured with UV detection at 278nm by employing a Waters Nov-Pak C-18 analytical column heated to 40oC. The mobile phase, run at 1.5mL/min, consisted of a mixture of 20:80 deionized water and methanol respectively. The retention times for Bu and the internal standard were 6.7 and 8.8min, respectively. All concentration-time plasma Bu data were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin Version 4.1 software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Analyses were performed on 125 allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplant (SCT) patients (pts). All pts received fludarabine 50mg/m\u00b2 on days -6 to -2 and IV Bu (Busulfex, ESP Pharma) at a \"myeloablative\" dose of 3.2mg/kg daily, on days -5 to -2 inclusive. Additional TBI 200cGy x 2 was given to 48 pts. Graft-vs.-host disease prophylaxis for all pts comprised cyclosporine A, \"short course\" methotrexate with folinic acid and Thymoglobulin (Genzyme) 4.5mg/kg in divided doses over 3 consecutive days pre-transplant finishing D0. The range of AUC per dose was 2184 to 7513 (median 4731) uM*min. Nineteen pts (15%) had AUC <3600uM*min and 15 (12%) had AUC >6000uM*min. The remaining 91 (73%) were between 3600 and 6000uM*min, equivalent to an exposure of 900-1500uM*min per dose established as desirable from studies of qid oral Bu given with cyclophosphamide. Transplant-related mortality in the pts with AUC >6000uM*min was significantly greater than in the pts with lower exposures (39\u00b114% vs. 15\u00b14%, p = 0.03). Given its good reproducibility the analysis method is efficient and cost effective for PK studies. Although IV Bu gives more predictable exposure than PO Bu this regimen still results in a 3-4 fold variability in AUC and a significant proportion of pts with exposures previously deemed too high or low when PO Bu is given with cyclophosphamide. These results also suggest that high exposures (> 6000uM*min) may increase the risk of transplant-related death and provide some justification for therapeutic monitoring.",

Calmels (1) Adverse events following hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) infusion are rare but might be severe. These reactions have been associated to the amount of cryoprotectant infused, but persistence of such events after DMSO depletion have questioned this assumption. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of side effects for 354 consecutive patients (372 HSC infusions) undergoing autologous HSC transplantation for hematologic or solid malignancies at two institutions. Side effects following infusion of HSC grafts thawed and washed at the laboratory were reported by medical teams in 50 cases (13%), and were graded according to the NCI-CTC from 1 to 4. While none of the factors associated with patient characteristics or infusion procedure -such as the volume infused or the infusion flow -are different between the two groups (grade 0 vs grade 1 to 4), we found that the absolute number of granulocytes (PMNC) measured before freezing is considerably higher in the adverse events group (n=50, av. 38.10e9 PMNC) compared to the other (n=322, av. 13.10e9 PMNC, p<10 9 ). Furthermore, within the adverse event group, there is a strong correlation between the amount of PMNC and the severity of the reaction (n=41 for grades 1/2, av. 32.10e9 PMNC; n=9 for grades 3/4, av. 64.10e9 PMNC, p=0.006). Others parameters associated with the occurrence of side effects are post-thaw viability (p<10 7 ), absolute number of CD45+ cells before freezing (p=0.02) and CD34+ cells recuperation (p=0.02). Of note, incidence and severity of adverse reactions when using the CytoMate cell washer (n=82 procedures, 16% of grades 1 to 4), that remove more than 95% of DMSO (Calmels et al., 2002) , is identical to those reported when washing HSC grafts using a less efficient manual centrifugation technique (n=209 procedures, 16% of grades 1 to 4). Although the presence of PMNC in apheresis products is undesirable, the clinical consequences of such contaminations have rarely been evaluated. This survey demonstrates that adverse reactions occuring in the setting of DMSO-depleted HSC grafts are related to the amount of PMNC and thus emphasizes the need for high-quality apheresis products so as to improve the safety of HSC infusion. Our observations suggest that immediate toxicity after infusion is probably of multifactorial origin and implies that pre-infusion washing of HSC grafts, that cannot remove PMNC remnants, might not be enough to reduce infusion-associated complications. Introduction: Engraftment syndrome (ES) is an increasingly reported complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, there are no uniform definitions of the diagnosis criteria and there are contradictory reports relating to the incidence of the syndrome and the risk factors. Moreover, the pathophysiologic mechanism of ES has not been studied. Methods: In order to characterize the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ES and the risk factors for its occurrence, we prospectively followed 94 HSCT recipients, autologous 52%,a nd allogeneic 49%. In addition, we have measured the levels S253 of the soluble alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2Ralpha)\u0192n\u0192w known as an early and reliable marker of T-cell activation, prior to transplant and then on day 0, and upon engraftment. Results: Based on a univariate and multivariate analyses model we defined diagnostic criteria for the development of the syndrome. Following these criteria, patients were diagnosed as having definite ES when having noninfectious fever, maculopappular skin rash and >3% weight gain during the period of stem cell engraftment. Patients were diagnosed as having probable ES when having noninfectious fever plus one of the two other criteria. Using these criteria the incidence of ES was 18%. Importantly, ES occurred only following autologous HSCT in multivariate analysis. The risk factors for the diagnosis of ES were the diagnosis of non Hodgkin lymphoma, p=0.03, O.R. 9.8(0.8-116) and BEAC/BEAM as conditioning regimens, p=0.01 O.R. 11.2 (1.7-106.7). The ratio between the level of sIL-2Ralpha \u0192nas the day of engraftment and baseline was significantly higher in patients who developed definite or probable ES (collectively), when compared to those who did not (p=0.004). Conclusions: Based on this prospective study we suggest novel diagnostic criteria for engraftment syndrome. In addition, we have indicated certain risk factors for the development of ES. Importantly, based on the measurements of sIL-2Ralpha\u0192n we imply that T-cell activation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of the syndrome. Finally, we suggest sIL-2Ralpha \u0192nmay be a potential marker for the development of the syndrome.",

Bosi AOU Careggi (Florence, I) Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is still controversial and the main policy is to reserve it for high-risk or advanced patients (pts). To evaluate the efficacy and the mortality of HSCT, we analysed 79 consecutive pts affected by ALL referred to our BMT Unit for transplant from March 1989 to December 2004. 49 were male, 30 female; median age was 29 yrs (range 16-54). 53 pts had B-lineage ALL, 26 T-lineage. The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) was present in 20 pts (25%). According to the German ALL risk classification, 28 pts were classified as standard risk, 31 high risk and 20 very high risk. 43 pts (54%) received transplantation in > CR1; 35 pts (44%) received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy before the transplant procedure. The donor was in 52 patients an HLA-related identical sibling (IS) and in 27 pts an unrelated matched donor (UD). Stem cell source was in the majority bone marrow (82%). The conditioning regimen was ifTBI 1320 cGy and CY120 (addition of VP-16 50 mg/mq in 7 advanced IS pts). GvHD prophylaxis was CYA/MTX; in UD transplant group ATG was added. As regard the disease status, pts in> CR1 were 27 (51%) in the IS group and 16 (59%) in the UD group; 19 (37%) and 16 pts (59%) had received more than 3 cycles respectively in the IS and in the UD group. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range , the event free survival at 3 years (EFS) was 37% (median 7 months). The EFS for IS was 43% (median 12 months) and for UD 26% (median 6 months) (p=.04). The overall TRM was 23%; 12% in IS transplant vs 44% in UD (p=.0001); according to disease status, TRM was 11% for pts transplanted in first CR vs 33% for pts in more advanced phase of disease (p=.04). A significant difference in term of TRM was also documented in pts that received more than 3 courses of chemotherapy compared to the others (43% vs 7%) (p=.0007). In multivariate analysis, considering age, sex, immunophenotype, risk class, disease status, number of CT courses, type of BMT, number of CD34 cell infused, sex-match and CMV status, the only factors influencing TRM were the number of CT courses (p=.003; H.R: 6.5; CI 95%: 1.8-23) and the type of transplant (p=.01; H.R. 3.4; CI 95%: 1.26-9.26). These results suggest that allogeneic myeloablative transplant should be performed earlier, beginning therefore an unrelated donor search as soon as possible, in order to reduce the number of CT courses and so the TRM.",

Szomor, \u00c1. Nagy, H. Losonczy University of P\u00e9cs (P\u00e9cs, HUN) Research in the pathogenesis of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) has recently focused on four different areas, like the role of glutathione depletion and inflammatory mediators in the process and the activation of fibrogenesis and blood coagulation system. Our aims were to perform thrombophilia studies and examine the role of inflammatory mediators before SCT, to investigate endothelial function and fibrogenesis before and 10 days after SCT and compare the data of patients with and without hepatic VOD. Number of patients: 103, mean age: 41.13\u00b114.68 years, male/female ratio: 56/47. The indications for autologous transplantation were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 41, Hodgkin's disease in 34, multiple myeloma in 26 and Ewing sarcoma in 2 patients. Thrombophilia studies (before SCT): fibrinogen, APC resistance, Antithrombin, Protein C, Protein S activity and antigen, lupus anticoagulant, FV:Q506 (Leiden mutation), FII 20210A allele and MTHFR C677T mutation. TNF-alpha gene d allele polymorphism: microsatellite method. Tests for endothelial dysfunction: PAI-1 and vWF antigen (before and 10 days after SCT), plasma homocystein level. Test for fibrogenesis: N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) RIA. Six patients (5.8%) developed hepatic VOD. 70% (72/103) of patients had abnormality in the thrombophilia studies, 34% (35/103) showed combined defects. Three abnormalities had higher prevalence than in the general population: high fibrinogen levels in 20% (21/103), type II Protein C deficiency in 12% (13/103) and hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHC) in 46.6% (48/103) with MTHFR C677T mutation in only 35% (17/48). The vWF antigen levels were high before SCT and increased significantly (p< 0.0002) afterwards. The PAI-1 antigen and the PIIINP levels increased markedly in patients with VOD, but remained unchanged in patients without it (p=0.24). There was no statistically significant difference in the TNFd3 allele frequency between the general population (47%) and our patients (54%) (p= 0.54). The marked HHC could be attributed to acquired factors, but folate levels remained normal. The prevalence of MTHFR C677T mutation was not higher than in the general population. The endothelial damage caused by high dose therapy and HHC resulted in an elevated vWF and PAI-1 Ag levels. We could not prove the importance of TNF gene polymorphism, but PAI-1 antigen and PIIINP levels had predictive role in the development of hepatic VOD.",

Freiberg-Richter, A. Jenke, U. Schuler, U. Platzbecker, G. Ehninger Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Dresden (Dresden, D) Objectives: Busulfan (BU) at doses of 12-16 mg/kg combined with 120-200 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide (CY) has been established as the most frequently used conditioning protocol for allogeneic transplantation. Efforts to decrease extramedullary toxicities especially in older patients have lead to the introduction of Fludarabine (FLU) as a potential alternative compound mediating immunosuppressive effects to allow for engraftment of allogeneic stem cells from related and unrelated donors. Recent studies have suggested that FLU can be safely combined with standard doses of oral and intravenous BU. The aim of our study was to retrospectively compare both regimens applied at a single institution. Patients and Methods: Either FLU 120 mg/sqm or CY 120 mg/kg were combined with 16 mg/kg oral or 13,8 mg/kg intravenous BU in 62 patients with myeloid malignancies. The two cohorts (n=31 each) were matched for disease (19 AML, 8 MDS, 4 CML), cytogenetic risk, number of previous chemotherapy regimens (n =2), donor sex and graft source. The median age was 54 years (range 24-66) in the FLU/BU group and 48 (range 27-63) in the BU/CY group. Etoposide 30 mg/kg was added to BU/CY in 9 patients and 7 patients in this group received ATG during conditioning therapy. GvHD prophylaxis was comparable with CsA/Mtx or CsA/MMF. The proportion of matched sibling donors was significantly higher in the BU/CY group (21/31 vs. 6/31, p<0.0001). Results: Neutrophil engraftment was significantly faster in the BU/CY group (12 vs. 14 days, p=0.001). Platelet engraftment was comparable in both groups. The incidence of renal and liver toxicity as well as grade 3-4 mucositis during the first 30 days after transplantation did not differ significantly. Although a higher proportion of unrelated donors was selected in the FLU/BU cohort, the rate of acute GvHD grade II-IV tended to be lower compared to BU/CY patients (52% vs. 65 %, p=0.3). Chronic GvHD occurred in 14 (FLU/BU) and 15 patients (BU/CY) patients, respectively. The probability of disease-free survival at 24 months was not significantly different (32% FLU/BU vs. 38% for BU/CY). The same was true for nonrelapse mortality and probability of relapse. Conclusion: This retrospective comparison suggests that CY can be replaced by FLU in combination with 16 mg/kg BU and that the FLU/BU regimen has comparable clinical efficacy. Whether specific subgroups may benefit more from one or the other regimen has to be studied prospectively.",

Mayer Dpt.of Internal Medicine Hematooncology (Brno, CZ) Introduction and Methods: ATG is a part of many ablative as well as nonmyeloablative regimens and several side effects of this drug are described. However, ATG-caused acute hemolysis has not been systematically studied. During the year 2005, we saw several causes of hemolysis, sometimes severe, being very suspicious to be caused by ATG. Therefore, we decided to review retrospectively all transplantations performed at our Dept. from Jan 2006 to Sept. 2005 and to search the hemolytic reactions probably caused by ATG.Results: Twenty-three patients (pts) were eligible (Bu+Flu+ATG, n=20; Cy+ATG, n=2; Bu+Cy, n=1), transplanted mostly for myeloid malignancies (n=15; other diagnoses: aplastic anemia: n=2, CLL: n=4, NHL: n=2). None of these patients showed any signs of hemolysis before ATG administration. ATG (Fresenius) was given mainly at the dose 10 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days. Two days after the last dose of ATG, 16 pts (70%) showed elevated bilirubin levels, 9 of them had elevated LDH. In 4 pts, free plasma hemoglobin and haptoglobin were evaluated and in all pts the results were compatible with hemolysis. Eighteen (78%) pts showed decrease in hemoglobin level more than 20 g/L on the 2nd day after the ATG administration. Five pts (22%) showed laboratory and clinical signs of florid fierce hemolysis and one developed acute renal insufficiency. Moreover, all of them had problems with red blood cell transfusion compatibility. The immunohematological investigation demonstrated nonspecific antibodies bond on the erythrocytes with the activation of complement. Direct antiglobulin test was positive in all 5 cases. All of these pts had to be given more than 5 units of packed red blood cells and 2 pts were treated with pulse corticosteroids. Other 9 pts showed clinical and laboratory signs of mild hemolysis not requiring massive substitution. Conclusion: Despite the retrospective nature of this study, hampering the exact description of all hemolysis-related laboratory phenomena, it is clear that ATG given in the peritransplant period can be frequently linked with the signs of hemolysis, severe in about one fifth of the pts and requiring therapy. Further studying of this potentially life-threatening complication is warranted.",

            "text": "Treosulfan-based conditioning regimen can replace TBI for studying the plasticity of bone marrow cells using EGFP transgenic mice A. Ibatici (1) In experimental mouse models, total body irradiation (TBI) plays a critical role facilitating donor BM chimerism and promoting migration of BM cells into several tissues mainly through a radiation damage. The fate of donor-derived BM cells can be tracked by using transgene markers such as the enhanced version of the green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We are interested in the study of cell fusion of BM-derived cells to Purkinje neurons and, in trying to dissect the favouring role of radiation in this process. To this end, we have used an alternative conditioning consisting of the alkylating agent Treosulfan (TREO) which was compared to TBI in an H-2 compatible allogeneic transplant model. Female C57BL/6 (H-2b) were used as recipients. Donor BM cells and splenocytes were obtained from H-2b compatible mice ubiquitously expressing EGFP. Recipients mice received TBI at a total dose of 800 (N=8) or 900 cGy (N=8) on day -1. The alternative conditioning consisted of TREO at 3 different schedules (5000/6000/7000 mg/kg total dose) in association to Fludarabine (FLU) at 300mg/kg total dose, injected intraperitoneally on days -3, -2, -1. TBI and TREO/FLU recipients were transplanted with comparable doses of BM-EGFP+ cells. Donor engraftment was evaluated as percentage of circulating mononuclear EGFP+ cells on day +20 and +40 after transplant. All mice but two were long survivors after transplant. On day+20, donor chimerism of TREO5 (N=5) and TREO6 (N=15) recipients was 3.47 and 18.55%, respectively and increased up to 3-fold following donor splenocytes infusion at a dose of 5 x 10 6 . When we compared TREO7 (N=5) with TBI 800 and 900, there was no difference in the percentage of donor chimerism on day +20 and on day +40 ( fig.1) . Interestingly, chimerism of circulating EGFP+ lymphocytes was significantly higher in the TREO7 group compared to TBI 800 and 900 (79 vs 44 and 49%).",

Although TBI remains the most reproducible conditioning in mice, alternative regimens using combination chemotherapy could be taken into account for experimental designs of BM cell plasticity. In fact, the contribution of BM-derived cells into various organs is greatly influenced by tissue injury in a dosedependent manner. Thus, using alternative regimens such as TREO could lead to remarkably different results than using TBI.",

De Samblanx ZiekenhuisNetwerkAntwerpen (Antwerp, B) Background: Nonmyeloablative allotransplantregimes enable older patients to undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In this population prevalent comorbidities impact on outcome. A focused comorbidityindex (HCT-CI) was recently validated, allowing better prediction of non relapse mortality (NRM) and survival. (Blood. 2005 Oct 15 ; 106 (8) : 2912-9) Frequently disease persists at the moment of conditioning (minimal residual disease, partial remission, persisting disease) for nonmyeloablative allotransplantation. Objective: Is HCT-CI usefull in predicting transplantation risk for patients not in complete remission at transplantation? Method: Analyse time to death and retrospectively application of HCT-CI for patients not in complete remission at transplantation. Results: From 5/2000 to 11/2005 46 consecutive patients received a non myeloablative allotransplant from a HLA identical sibling and with a fludarabin/ATG based conditioning. 20 Patients (43%) died during followup, of which one patient was not evaluable (missing data) and two patients had no evidence of disease at death (true NRM). From the remaining 17 analysed patients, 12 were catalogued as early deaths (<3 months after transplantation) and 5 late deaths. The mean HCT-CI score for early deaths was 3,9 (range 2-6) versus 2,8 (range 0-5) for late deaths. Mean age at transplantation for early deaths was 55 years and for late deaths 61 years, so age does not account for this difference. Conclusion: A short survival after transplantation is more likely with higher HCT-CI.",
