To identify residues comprising the ICLs, we generated a homology model of CFTR based on the crystal structure of Sav1866 in which NBD1 and NBD2 form a productive dimer (Dawson and Locher. Nature. 2006) . Our data on a peptide corresponding to the first intracellular loop (ICL1) indicate that binding to NBD1 requires phosphorylation of the RI. Our homology model shows that the ICL1 binding site is buried when the RI is bound to the NBD core. NMR data comparing phospho and non-phospho NBD1 indicates that phosphorylation of the RI and RE disrupts their interactions with the NBD core, likely exposing the site for ICL1 binding. The structure of the molybdate transporter ModB2C2, with the NBDs in an open conformation, shows ICL1 binding is cognate NBD at a different interface (Hollenstein et al. Nature. 2007) . ICL1 in ModB2C2 interacts with the NBD near Y93, the analogous residue to F508 in CFTR. We will show binding data of ICL1 with WT and \u2206F508 NBD1 in different states and also present resonance assignments of NBD1 to map the ICL1 interaction sites. Since the Sav1866 and ModB2C2 structures were solved in different states, the different ICL interactions may represent structural changes during the reaction cycle. The \u2206F508 mutation may thus affect intramolecular associations in certain conformations, which would account for another part of the \u2206F508 defect. Probing differences in interactions of WT and \u2206F508 NBD1 is critical for understanding the molecular basis of normal CFTR function and of the altered CFTR function in cystic fibrosis.",

Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 2. Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA The most frequent disease-causing mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF) is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (dF508) in the first nucleotide binding domain of CFTR. Essentially all of the mutant protein, as well as 70% of wild type (WT) CFTR, is retained in the ER and targeted for ERassociated degradation (ERAD) by the 26S proteasome. Key mediators of CFTR folding and degradation are molecular chaperones, which help protein substrates fold, but can target them for degradation if folding efficiency is compromised. To identify factors modulating ERAD of CFTR we performed a microarray analysis, screening for transcription profile differences between yeast expressing CFTR and control strains, and identified enhanced transcript levels for the small heat shock protein Hsp26 in yeast expressing CFTR. We then demonstrated that CFTR degradation was blocked in strains lacking the genes encoding the two yeast sHsps, HSP26 and HSP42 (1) . To examine whether sHsps regulate CFTR biogenesis in mammalian cells, we asked which of the 10 human sHsp homologues are endogenously co-expressed with CFTR using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. We detected 5 sHsps, including alphaA-crystallin and Hsp27, in Calu-3 and primary HBE cells. Co-expression of alphaAcrystallin or Hsp27 together with WT or DF508-CFTR in HEK293 cells selectively decreased the steady state levels of dF508-CFTR. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the rate of dF508-CFTR degradation was enhanced when either sHsp was over-expressed, but WT CFTR biogenesis was unchanged. Co-immuno-precipitation experiments in HEK 293 cells revealed that alphaA-crystallin and Hsp27 interacted preferentially with dF508-CFTR. Thus far, our results suggest that sHsps selectively increase dF508-CFTR's accessibility to proteasome-mediated degradation pathways. Previously, Hsp27 was reported to interact with Ubc9, the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) conjugating enzyme (2) . SUMO is covalently linked to its substrates, often at sumoylation consensus sites; similarly to ubiquitin, this occurs through a series of thiol transfer reactions. We confirmed this interaction by co-immuno-precipitation and found that Ubc9 as well as the SUMO specific protease, Senp1, are expressed in airway epithelial cells. Over-expression of Ubc9 decreased, while over-expression of Senp1 increased dF508-CFTR protein levels. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that these enzymes regulate selectively the degradation of dF508-CFTR, similarly to the sHsps. Preliminary studies in vitro and in vivo indicate that CFTR, and particularly purified NBD1, is sumoylated and that Hsp27 facilitates this process. Mutational analysis of the 3 sumoylation consensus sites within CFTR suggests a cycle of SUMO modification that facilitates WT CFTR biosynthesis but targets dF508-CFTR for degradation, probably because the balance between SUMO addition and removal is impaired by an excessive interaction of sHsps with the mutant protein.",

Physiology and Biophysics, Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, IL, USA Efficient retrieval of wtCFTR from the cell surface is mediated by components of the clathrin mediated endocytic pathway; however many aspects of CFTR endocytosis remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that endocytosis of wtCFTR is dependent upon recognition of a tyrosinebased motif in the carboxyl tail of CFTR by the AP2 endocytic adaptor complex. In contrast to wtCFTR, less is known about the mechanisms whereby mutant CFTR undergoes internalization. According to one model, dF508 CFTR undergoes accelerated endocytosis compared to wtCFTR, whereas others have argued that endocytic rates of dF508 CFTR are comparable to those of wild-type CFTR. To further define the function of proteins involved in the initial steps of wt and mutant CFTR endocytosis, we investigated the role of the GTPase dynamin. Dynamin has been proposed to play a key role in endocytosis by facilitating the scission of nascent clathrin coated vesicles from the cell surface. Until recently, very few tools were available to modulate clathrin mediated events. We took advantage of Dynasore, a newly discovered small molecule, non-competitive inhibitor of the GTPase dynamin. Dynasore acts as a potent, rapid and reversible inhibitor of endocytic pathways known to depend upon dynamin, by blocking coated vesicle formation within seconds of dynasore addition. Endocytosis of wtCFTR was inhibited rapidly and efficiently upon addition of dynasore. Furthermore, within minutes of dynasore washout, endocytosis of wtCFTR resumed completely. Also upon dynamin washout, normal trafficking and recycling of wtCFTR was also observed. Temperature correction of dF508 causes expression of CFTR at the cell surface, however such 'rescued' dF508 CFTR is not stabilized upon returning cells to 37C. Application of dynasore prevented such rapid loss of mutant CFTR from the cell surface. Since maintenance of mutant CFTR at the cell surface is critical for effective therapeutic intervention in patients with CF, our results provide insight into additional potential targets for pharmacological manipulation for the treatment of CF.",

Physiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA Protein misfolding is the basis for a multitude of human diseases; however, the mechanisms underlying misfolding are not well understood. Most cases of cystic fibrosis are associated with mutations-including the most common, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (\u2206F508) in NBD1-that interfere with the folding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The resulting loss of functional CFTR causes the disease. Thus, elucidating how \u2206F508, affects the folding of CFTR is critical to understanding the pathology of the disease. CFTR is composed of five domains: two integral membrane transmembrane domains (TMDs), a regulatory domain (R), and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). \u2206F508 occurs in the N-terminal NBD1. Both the murine wildtype and \u2206F508 NBD1 can be expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity. While the soluble expression yield of \u2206F508 is lower than the wild type under identical conditions, \u2206F508 achieves a native conformation similar to wild type as monitored by a variety of hydrodynamic and spectroscopic characteristics such as analytical size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and fluorescence. Recently, a non-native, but folded, species has been detected under mildly denaturing conditions. Far-UV CD reveals a time and temperature dependent conversion from a mixed alpha/beta native conformation to a less helical non-native conformation, while fluorescence measurements reveal a parallel blue shift in the peak emission intensity from 343 to 330 nm. This non-native species is in a more open conformation as determined by both limited proteolysis and the change in retention time on analytical size exclusion chromatography. The conversion to this state is inhibited by the native state ligand (ATP) and by the presence of the second site suppressors (G550E, R553M, and R555K). Notably, the \u2206F508 NBD1 protein populates the non-native state under milder conditions than the wild type NBD1. These studies reveal the properties of the native state and its conversion to a partially folded state that is affected by the \u2206F508 mutation. This data highlight the proximal affect of the disease causing mutation and provide a means of assessing strategies designed to correct the defect. This work is supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation through a postdoctoral training grant and by the NIH We have previously demonstrated that the stability of CFTR is negatively modulated by the CFTR interacting protein, CAL. CAL competes with NHERF in binding to the PDZ motif at the C-terminus of CFTR and directs CFTR trafficking to the lysosome. Recently, silencing of CAL or overexpression of NHERF has been shown to restore chloride transport activity in \u2206F508-CFTR cell lines. To identify the molecular machineries involved in CAL dependent degradation of CFTR, we investigated the role of the CAL interacting SNARE protein syntaxin 6 (STX6). STX6 protein expression and function were manipulated by siRNA silencing, over-expression, and a dominant-negative mutant. We also performed a functional study of chloride transport activity in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o-stably expressing either wt-CFTR or \u2206F508-CFTR.",

In HEK293 cells, knockdown of either STX6 or CAL augments the expression of transfected GFP-tagged CFTR (GFP-CFTR), which is consistent with the observation that overexpression of either STX6 or CAL enhances the degradation of CFTR. STX6 interaction with CAL was confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Because of this interaction, we hypothesize that STX6 negatively regulates CFTR protein stability by interacting with CAL which in turn binds to the C-ter-minal PDZ motif of CFTR. Consistent with his hypothesis, STX6 knockdown has no effect on protein levels of a CFTR mutant lacking the PDZ motif (GFP-CFTR\u2206TRL). More importantly, CAL knockdown eliminates the inhibitory effect of STX6 overexpression on GFP-CFTR. A cell surface biotinylation assay and confocal microscopy showed significant increases in plasma membrane expression of CFTR in STX6 knockdown cells without gross changes in the expression pattern. Furthermore, consistent with its Trans-Golgi localization, STX6 knockdown has no effect on GFP-\u2206F508-CFTR expression.

Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada CFTR channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of the R-domain. Direct PKC phosphorylation at specific sites in the R domain and NBD1 is essential and modulates CFTR activation by PKA. However, the molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation of the R domain induces channel activity remains unknown. We have reported biochemical evidence for the role of phosphorylation in domain-domain association using a deltaR-Split construct encoding the front (TMD1-NBD1) and back (NBD2-TMD2) halves of CFTR as separate polypeptides (1) . In agreement with the inhibitory role of the R domain, iodide effluxes and patch-clamp experiments confirmed that deltaR-Split channels were functional and constitutively active without cAMP stimulation. Co-transfecting a plasmid that directs expression of the R domain restored the PKA-dependence of re-assembled channels. Co-immunoprecipitations of the 2 halves of the deltaR-Split with a GST-R domain fusion protein in vitro or with the cotransfected R domain in BHK cells revealed that PKA phosphorylation enhances the R domain binding to the rest of the channel. We have now investigated the effect of PKC phosphorylation on the R domain binding. Our data demonstrate that PKC phosphorylation also induces a strong binding of GST-R domain in vitro or co-transfected R domain in vivo when BHK cells are stimulated with PMA. Interestingly, the combination of PKC+PKA phosphorylation induced a stronger binding than PKA alone. Mutation of all consensus PKC sites on the R domain to alanine (7CA) eliminated specific PKC phosphorylation but did not alter PKA phosphorylation in GST-RD. Western blotting and confocal microscopy experiments confirmed that expression levels of all 3 domains of the Split-7CA/RD are unchanged compared to Split-RD and co-localize at the plasma membrane of BHK cells. Basal activity of the Split-7CA/RD was similar to that of the Split-RD in iodide efflux experiments. However, activation by cAMP+IBMX was delayed and significantly reduced (36.92 % of Split-RD and 13.85% of WT-CFTR activation). These results confirm the functional re-assembly of the 7CA-RD with the front and back halves of the channel and the inhibitory role of the R domain. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the same level of interaction was observed between the 7CA/RD and RD with the Split halves suggesting that basal, inhibitory interaction of the R domain is independent of PKC phosphorylation. However, 7CA/RD binding with the Split channel was not increased by PKC or PKA stimulation. We conclude that PKC phosphorylation is essential for PKA-dependent binding of the R domain to the rest of the channel, and that the combined effect of these kinases further strengthens the R domain interaction. These structural changes are consistent with the essential role of PKC sites for CFTR activation by PKA as previously reported (2) . Supported by CIHR, NSHRF, DMRF & CCFF. G.Seavilleklein was supported by NSERC. (1) The in vivo folding mechanism of multidomain membrane proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is poorly understood. CFTR, a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, contains two symmetrical halves, each consisting of a membrane spanning domain (MSD1 and MSD2) and a cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), connected by the regulatory (R) domain. To address whether CFTR follows the archetypical domain-wise folding of multidomain soluble polypeptides and/or the cooperative domain folding mechanism, first we determined domain combinations that are necessary and sufficient to escape the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. One-, twoor three-domain assemblies failed to be processed efficiently in cells, measured by biochemical and morphological assays. The smallest folding unit that escaped the ER quality control was composed of a four-domain assembly, containing MSD1, NBD1, R or MSD2 as linear or split polypeptide. As a second approach we showed that CF-causing point mutations in the MSD1, NBD1 or MSD2 provoked the ER retention of the full-length CFTR with severe conformational defect in the NBD2, measured by limited proteolysis and immunoblotting, using domain spacific antibodies. The posttranslational folding kinetics of the four-domain folding unit was comparable to that of CFTR, suggesting that cooperative domain assembly is essential for the channel biogenesis. This mechanism provides an explanation for the processing defect caused by numerous CF mutations and outlines a possible paradigm for CFTR folding in living cells.",

Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator). CFTR, a member of the ABC transporter family, is a multispanning membrane protein critical to chloride and water movement in secretory epithelia. Over one thousand mutations, in all parts of the CFTR sequence, have been identified, many of which disrupt the function of the protein to cause the disease. Some of the disease-associated mutations in the N-terminal portion of CFTR were predicted to alter cotranslational interactions with factors involved in the membrane integration of CFTR required for its proper function. To test this hypothesis, a photoreactive probe was incorporated into different positions of the N-terminal portion of CFTR by introducing amber stop codons and translating these messages in vitro in the presence of the amber suppressor tRNA N \u03b5 -(5-azido-2 nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNA amb . Ribosome-associated nascent chains of a specific length containing the modified amino acid at a defined position were produced using truncated mRNAs. Some of these CFTR nascent chains photocrosslinked with proteins of approximately 50 and 100 kDa molecular mass. Crosslinking to the ~50 kDa protein was observed only after the TM1 span had emerged from the ribosomal tunnel. Moreover, truncation analysis demonstrated that TM1 is necessary for this interaction. In evaluating a range of nascent chains, the extents of photocrosslinking to the ~50 kDa and 100 kDa proteins often varied inversely. Immunochemical and knockdown/depletion studies indicate the ~50 kDa protein is SRP54, a subunit of the signal recognition particle involved in targeting ribosome nascent chain complexes to the translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Highlighting the functional relevance of this interaction, in cells with reduced SRP levels, nonglycosylated forms of CFTR accumulate and total CFTR levels decrease. Notably, some CF-causing mutations in TM1 also reduce crosslinking to SRP. These data reveal that mutational inhibition of nascent CFTR association with SRP likely contributes to or mediates some types of CF.",

            "text": "The initial reversible steps of ATP binding to the first (NBD1) and second (NBD2) nucleotide binding sites of CFTR are divalent cation independent and dependent, respectively (Aleksandrov et al, J Biol Chem 277, 15419-25, 2002) . Subsequent to the initial binding, either Mg or Mn drive rapid hydrolysis at the second site while promoting trapping of the nucleotide at the first site. This occlusion at the first site of functional wildtype CFTR is somewhat similar to that which occurs when the catalytic glutamates in both of the hydrolytic sites of P-glycoprotein are mutated. This occluded state has been proposed to be the result of dimerization of the two NBDs and represent a transient intermediate formed during ATP hydrolysis (Tombline and Senior, J Bioenerg Biomembr 37, 497-500, 2005) . To test the possible relevance of this interpretation to CFTR, we have now characterized the process by which NBD1 occludes [ 32 P]-8N 3 ATP and [ 32 P]-8N 3 ADP. We have now found that only N 3 ATP and not N 3 ADP can be bound initially at NBD1 in the absence of Mg. Consistent with this Mg requirement for the NDP binding, N 3 ADP or ADP is able to compete for the N 3 ATP binding site only when the divalent ion is present. Despite the lack of a requirement for Mg for ATP binding, retention of the nucleotide triphosphate at the binding site at 37\u00b0C was dependent on the cation. However, at reduced temperature (4\u00b0C), N 3 ATP remains locked in the binding pocket with virtually no reduction over a 1 hour period even in the absence of Mg. These apparently paradoxical temperature effects hint that different molecular events can contribute to the occlusion of nucleotide at NBD1. That the occlusion process occurs exclusively at NBD1 and does not depend on its interaction with NBD2, was shown by experiments in which identical behavior was exhibited by \u2206NBD2 constructs of CFTR. Thus, nucleotide trapping by wild-type CFTR, unlike that by mutant P-glycoprotein, is accomplished by events at a single domain (NBD1), rather than by dimerization of the two NBDs.

The TMDs and the NBDs of CFTR are similar to those found in many ATP-binding cassette proteins, the majority of which are transporters. The domains are fused in a single polypeptide chain, linked in the sequence: TMD1, NBD1, R domain, TMD2, NBD2.

We study the changes in their reactivity in closed and open channel states to characterize the changes in transmembrane domain conformations during gating. Using membrane impermeant MTS-reagents, we have characterized the conformational changes in TM1-ECL1, ECL3-TM6, ECL4-TM8, and ECL6-TM12 of CFTR. Our results suggest that ATP binding induces modest changes in the transmembrane domains and extracellular loops. Channel opening involves a rearrangement of the TM helices leading to decreased hydration of residues near the extracellular end. This conformational change is either a part of, or allosterically coupled to the gating mechanism. 14 PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF NHERF1 IN THE REGULATION OF CFTR Raghuram, V.; Yang, Y.; Yaemsiri, S. Laboratory of Kidney and Electrolyte Metabolism, NHLBI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA In the apical membrane of epithelial cells, CFTR seems to exist within a multiprotein complex, in which its activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins. The c-terminus of CFTR contains a PDZ-binding motif, which binds to several PDZ domain-containing proteins, including members of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 regulatory factor (NHERF) family, NHERF1/EBP50, NHERF2/E3KARP, CAP70/NHERF3, NHERF4, and CAL/PIST/GOPC. PDZ domain proteins act as scaffolds to assemble signaling proteins to form signaling complexes. These signaling complexes are central to achieve specificity and efficiency of signal transduction. NHERF1 and NHERF2 have a c-terminal ERM domain, which interacts with cytoskeleton-associated ERM proteins. This interaction may anchor CFTR to the actin-cytoskeleton and restrict its movement within the membrane. In addition, several functional roles have been proposed for CFTR-PDZ domain interactions, including as an adapter to promote efficient PKA phosphorylation of CFTR, apical targeting and recycling of CFTR, regulation of single-channel activity, organization of \u03b2-adrenergic, and lysophosphatidic acid-2 receptor signaling complex, and trafficking of ROMK channels. Our current understandings of the role of CFTR-PDZ interactions are mostly obtained from heterologous expression studies. Very few studies have addressed the role of PDZ domain proteins in native epithelial cells or in organ physiology. We have used RNA interference techniques to produce a knockout or knockdown (KD) Calu-3 cell lines using a lenti-viral vector for stable suppression. Using four different shRNAs, we have generated four stable NHERF1-KD cell lines with varying levels of NHERF1 suppression. In these cells, NHERF1 expression ranged from 10-40% of Calu-3NT cells (control cells). In NHERF1-KD cells, steady-state CFTR protein level was greatly reduced, whereas its apical localization was unaffected. We also found structural defects in the apical microvilli. In polarized NHERF1-KD epithelia, membrane-permeable cAMP analogs were unable to stimulate CFTR mediated short-circuit currents. However, forskolin induced response was nearly normal despite reduced CFTR expression. Examinations of \u03b2adrenergic-, and adenosine-receptor signaling pathways suggest that NHERF1 plays a unique role in organizing the adenosine receptor signaling pathway. ",

Thus it is possible that the global effects noted here leading to dramatic upregulation of two novel genes OASL and SMAD9 could be previously unrecognized consequences of gene therapies. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease which is caused by mutations of the CF gene, which codes for the CFTR chloride channel. The \u2206F508-CFTR mutation results in a mutant protein that undergoes transcription but fails to localize to the apical membrane, where it normally functions as a cAMP-regulated Clchannel. However, Clchannel activity can be detected at the plasma membrane when \u2206F508-CFTR is overexpressed, synthesized at a reduced temperature, or in the presence of chemical chaperones. Thus, strategies that facilitate the translocation of \u2206F508-CFTR to the plasma membrane by increasing CFTR transcription may be beneficial for the treat-ment of CF. Previous studies performed using fluorescence halide efflux measurements and short-circuit current voltage clamp have shown that treatment with PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) agonists, such as pioglitazone and FLL (FMOC-L-leucine), resulted in an increased biosynthesis and trafficking of \u2206F508-CFTR to the cell surface. This effect was at least partially due to increased \u2206F508-CFTR expression. Further studies were designed to investigate the effect of PPAR\u03b3 agonists on CFTR promoter activity. Two firefly luciferase-conjugated CFTR promoter plasmids, containing either 0.79 kb or 3.9 kb fragments, were transfected together with a control plasmid containing a Renilla luciferase in human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells. The ratio of the firefly to Renilla luminescence was used to measure CFTR promoter activity. PPAR\u03b3 agonists increased CFTR expression acting both on 0.7 kb and 3.9 kb promoter fragments. These results were confirmed in quantitative RT-PCR studies. Transcription factor binding site analysis using current online programs and matrices showed three putative PPRE (peroxisome proliferator response element) consensus sequences in the CFTR promoter. The interaction of these sites with PPAR\u03b3 was shown using EMSA (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Interestingly, none of these consensus sequences appear in the 0.7 kb construct, which still maintained a significant PPAR\u03b3 activation response. Therefore, we hypothesized that a novel PPAR\u03b3 agonist effector site(s) is involved in transcription activation of CFTR. To characterize this novel site(s), a series of deletion constructs to the promoter region were created, using mutation-introduced restriction sites in the original promoter construct. The new constructs ranged from 0.61 kb to 24 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. In preliminary studies we found that at least one previously uncharacterized PPAR\u03b3 effector site was present in the 0.61 kb promoter fragment that regulated CFTR expression. Additional experiments were performed using EMSA to determine the proteins and cofactors which controlled the optimal conditions for CFTR expression. The results of this study show that PPAR\u03b3 agonists, currently prescribed to treat hyperglycemia and improve peripheral insulin resistance, may also have additional benefits for the treatment of CF. Our studies also show that pioglitazone and other PPAR\u03b3 agonists, by increasing CFTR expression, are potent activators of Clflux in epithelial cells expressing \u2206F508-CFTR.",

In CFBE41o-cells transfected with siRNA duplex specific for Hop (48 hr), Hop expression was modestly inhibited; however, GSNO dramatically augmented the inhibition. We next showed that knockdown of endogenous Hop by siRNA increased the steady-state levels of immature and mature forms of CFTR. Though overexpression of Hop did not significantly affect CFTR expression (immature and mature forms increased 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 fold respectively), in the presence of 10 \u00b5M GSNO, expression of both immature and mature CFTR forms significantly increased in the Hop overexpressing cells (3.6 \u00b1 0.4 and 2.7 \u00b1 0.2 fold respectively). Next, we treated CFBE41o-cells with a pulse of GSNO (10 \u00b5M; 4 hr); isolated cytosol, ER and Golgi fractions; immunoprecipitated CFTR from these fractions; and studied whether Hop, co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR, was S-nitrosylated (using a biotin substitution technique followed by streptavadin isolation). We found that SNO-modified Hop coimmunoprecipitated with \u2206F508 CFTR in the cytosol and ER at baseline; and that GSNO decreased the association between SNO-modified Hop and \u2206F508 CFTR. We speculate that the effect of GSNO to decrease Hop-CFTR association may 1) result from increased Hop S-nitrosylation; and 2) be permissive for \u2206F508 CFTR maturation. These data may be of relevance to the development of NO donor-based therapies for CF. Supported by CF Foundation and the NIH. Mouse models for cystic fibrosis (CF) provide new possibilities to study disease pathogenesis, to correlate genotype and phenotype, and to test novel CF therapies. We use the Cftr tm1Eu mice homozygous for the F508del mutation in a congenic FVB background as a tool in pre-clinical testing of therapeutic strategies aimed at the correction of the F508del folding and trafficking defect. These mice show characteristic CF ion transport abnormalities such as reduced cAMP-and cGMP activated intestinal chloride secretion and an increase of the amiloride-sensitive sodium absorption in nasal epithelium.",

Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of all PItreated tissues showed the appearance of Cftr positive crypt cells and mature band C Cftr protein. Rescue by ALLN remained detectable following inhibition of the ER to Golgi transport by brefeldin A.

Forskolin (10\u00b5M)-stimulated iodide efflux was very low in both mouse and human F508del CFTR cells (0.5 respectively 2 % of WT values) and was stimulated to a similar extent (3.5 and 3.8fold) by the CFTR potentiator genistein (100 \u00b5M). Preincubation for 14 h at 26 0 C, or at 37 0 C in the presence of the Vertex corrector CFcor-325 (3 \u00b5M) caused a 3-4 fold increase in forskolin-activated 125 I-efflux in both cell types that was further enhanced by 2.6-3 fold upon addition of genistein. Functional correction was paralleled by the appearance of mature, complex-glycosylated mouse or human CFTR on Western blots. Surprisingly, two other, structurally unrelated compounds known to correct the gating defect in hCFTR, i.e. the Vertex potentiator CFpot-532 (10 \u00b5M) and the uncharged NPPB analogue NPPB-AM (20 \u00b5M; cf.

Department of Physics and Astronomy, UNC at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is a cAMP dependent chloride channel. The phosphorylation of its 200 amino acid R domain by protein kinase A (PKA) is obligatory for channel gating under normal conditions. R domain contains multiple PKA phosphorylation sites, which participate in activation, but no specific site is essential for channel function. In spite of numerous studies of the role of R domain in CFTR regulation, the mechanism is largely unknown. One reason for this is the lack of information on R domain structure and its interactions with other parts of CFTR. It has been shown that R domain lacks well-defined secondary structural elements and is intrinsically disordered. In this study, we used computational methods to explore the structure and function of the disordered R domain. Our results show a specific disorder-order pattern in R domain, which is conserved among species even though the primary structure is not conserved. This result implies a role of the disorder-order pattern in R domain function and provides a basis of a novel working model. To gain some insight into the three dimensional structure of R domain, we per-formed ab initio folding of R-domain using discrete molecular dynamics with an all-atom force field. As disordered domains can not be characterized with a single structure, an ensemble was generated by selection of structures with the lowest energy from a large number of folding simulations. These structures were clustered to determine the dominant R domain conformations. They reveal features of secondary and tertiary structure, the positions of phosphorylation sites in 3D, and residue contacts within the R region that might be important for structure and function. To computationally confirm the mechanism proposed in our working model, an ensemble of phosphorylated R domain structures was also produced and characterized.",

            "text": "Our data suggest that truncated forms of CFTR (\u2206264) may be useful for CF gene therapy by affecting the maturation of endogenous CFTR. \u2206F508, the most common disease causing CFTR mutation, has impaired conformational maturation during its biosynthesis, and thus is unable to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A well-defined di-acidic ER exit code has been identified within the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of wildtype CFTR (JCB 167: 65-74, 2004) , the disruption of which prevents CFTR from efficiently exiting the ER. This is consistent with the role of the diacidic code in the COPII-mediated cargo concentration process. However, it is not known whether other types of ER-to-Golgi trafficking signals play a role in CFTR trafficking in the early secretory pathway. Even less is known about the trafficking signal(s) that are responsible for the rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR by a number of means. To achieve a better understanding of the trafficking signals dictating the export of CFTR from the ER, we constructed a series of CFTR mutants to probe the potential functional targeting signals within both wild-type and \u2206F508 CFTR. It has been shown that NBD2 is not required for the export of wild-type CFTR from the ER. We further found that an internal deletion mutant lacking membrane spanning domain 1 (MSD1) and NBD1-R but retaining the N-terminal cytoplasmic region, MSD2 and NBD2 does not have sufficient signal to allow ER export, suggesting that the signal(s) that are responsible for CFTR export largely reside within the NBD1-R. Unlike \u2206F508 CFTR, the di-acidic code mutants are not temperature-sensitive. Dissecting the di-acidic code revealed that both acidic residues contribute to ER export, and that simultaneous substitution of both leads to a much decreased export of CFTR. We found that the temperature-dependent export of \u2206F508 relies on the presence of the di-acidic code within the NBD1, suggesting that this code has a functional role in the temperature-dependent rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR. In our effort to further examine the role of the di-acidic code in the rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR by second site mutations, we found that \u2206F508 CFTR rescue by the simultaneous disruption of two of the arginine-framed tripeptides (AFTs) is also dependent upon the di-acidic code. Surprisingly, we found that while NBD2 is not necessary for the export of wild-type CFTR, it is required for the AFT-mediated rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR, suggesting a role for cytoplasmic inter-domain interactions in the AFT-mediated rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR. A detailed biochemical analysis of these mutants provides valuable insights into the roles of different CFTR \"trafficking\" motifs in the ER-to-Golgi transport of CFTR, the specific conformational defects of \u2206F508 CFTR and the potential molecular mechanism underlying the rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR.

Genetica Molecolare, Istituto Gianina Gaslini, Genova, Italy CFTR inhibitors are predicted to prevent intestinal fluid secretion in enterotoxin-mediated secretory diarrheas such as cholera. CFTR inhibitors that are not absorbed across the intestinal wall are attractive for diarrhea therapy because they may provide safe oral therapy. We previously discovered low affinity glycine hydrazide (GlyH, IC50 ~5 \u00b5M) CFTR inhibitors that block CFTR at its external pore (Muanprasat et al., J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124:125-137) . In order to increase inhibitor potency and prevent washout during severe secretory diarrhea, we synthesized a series of glycocalyx interactive CFTR inhibitors containing a malonic acid hydrazide (MalH) CFTR pore blocking moiety linked to a lectin (Sonawane et al., Gastroenterology 2007; 132:1234 -1244 . Lectin conjugation improved CFTR inhibitory potency by ~100-fold (IC50 to 50 nM). High-affinity CFTR inhibition was abolished by MalH-lectin heat denaturation, protease digestion, or competition by mannose or unconjugated lectin. Fluorescently labeled MalH-lectin remained membrane-bound for >6 hours after washout, whereas washout occurred in a few minutes without the lectin. MalH-lectins blocked cholera toxin-induced intestinal fluid secretion in closed intestinal loops in mice with EC50 50-100 pmol, and greatly reduced mortality in a suckling mouse model of cholera. We recently synthesized mono-and divalent CFTR inhibitors consisting of MalH coupled via a disulfonic stilbene linker to flexible mono and bifunctional polyethyleneglycols (PEGs) of molecular size 0. 2, 0.75, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 100 kDa, with calculated solution lengths of 1-23 nm, with the larger size PEGs potentially spanning CFTR dimers or inducing their formation. IC50 for inhibition of CFTR chloride current was 10-15 \u00b5M for monovalent MalH-PEGs, but substantially lower and size-dependent for divalent MalH-PEGs, decreasing from 1.5 \u00b5M to 300 nM with increasing PEG size. The mechanisms responsible for the improved and size-dependent potency of divalent MalH-PEGs were studied by whole cell, single-channel patch-clamp and by functional analysis of multivalent MalH-conjugated dextrans and asymmetric divalent PEGs. Whole-cell experiments revealed reversible voltage-dependent block of CFTR currents, with outward (positive) currents being more strongly blocked. In outside-out patch-clamp experiments, inhibitors caused a reduction of the mean open time. For MalH-PEG20kDa-MalH (2 \u00b5M) , the mean open time decreased from 189 \u00b1 44 to 97 \u00b1 29 ms. The effect on currentvoltage relationship and channel kinetics are consistent with a mechanism involving occlusion of the CFTR pore from the extracellular side. Luminally added divalent MalH-PEGs blocked by > 90% cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion in mouse intestinal loops with IC50s of <10 pmol/loop, and greatly reduced mortality in a suckling mouse model of cholera. Nonabsorbable, multivalent CFTR inhibitor-macromolecule conjugates may be useful as anti-secretory agents in the treatment of enterotoxin-mediated diarrheas. Supported by CFF and NIH. Activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Clchannel is primarily controlled by PKA-dependent phosphory-lation of the R domain. Once the R domain is phosphorylated, ATP binding and enzymatic activity at two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) open and close the CFTR Clchannel. We hypothesized that R domain phosphorylation regulates CFTR activity by modulating ATP interactions within two NBDs. To test this hypothesis, we studied the activity of wild-type CFTR and five variants with deletions of portions of the R domain between residues 708 and 835. To alter ATP-dependent channel gating, we tested three CFTR stimulators, pyrophosphate (PP i , 2 mM), 2'deoxy-ATP (2'dATP, 1mM) and CaATP (1mM) . Consistent with previous studies, PP i , 2'dATP and CaATP all increased current of wild-type CFTR about two-fold. Each stimulator produced a similar increase in the R domain variants. The similar effects of stimulators on the channel activities of wild-type CFTR and R domain variants suggest that the R domain does not have a major role in regulating ATP-dependent channel gating. The R domain deletions did not alter the single-channel current amplitude of the R domain variants. However, R domain variants missing the sequence between residues 784 and 835 markedly reduced the open state probability, suggesting that this region is required for normal gating. These data suggest that the R domain does not control CFTR activity by modulating ATP interactions with NBD binding sites. Instead, we speculate that the C-terminal part of R domain might participate in the channel-gating machinery downstream of ATP regulation.",

            "text": "Haggie, P.M.; Verkman, A. Medicine and Physiology, CVRI, U.C.S.F., San Francisco, CA, USA It was recently reported that phagolysosomes of alveolar macrophages from CF mice acidify in a CFTR-dependent manner and that defective phagolysosomal acidification impairs bactericidal activity (Di et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 2006, 8:933-944) . These findings suggested a unifying hypothesis for CF disease progression: defective phagolysosomal acidification in CF macrophages permits the initiation and promotes progression of bacterial infection in the lungs. To reassess the central finding of that study we measured phagolysosomal pH using a fluorescent pH indicator containing Oregon Green\u00ae 488 (pKa ~4.7) and tetramethylrhodamine covalently bound to zymosan. Phagolysosomal pH was insensitive to CFTR inhibition (10 \u00b5M CFTRinh-172) in J774 macrophages (pH 5.08 \u00b1 0.08 vs. 5.10 \u00b1 0.03), alveolar macrophages from mouse lung (pH 5.34 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 5.37 \u00b1 0.07), and alveolar macrophages from human lung (pH 5.30 \u00b1 0.08 vs. 5.35 \u00b1 0.07). Phagolysosomal pH in alveolar macrophages from \u2206F508 CF mice was not significantly different from that in alveolar macrophages from wild-type mice (pH 5.34 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 5.40 \u00b1 0.06). To account for their finding of defective phagolysosomal acidification in alveolar macrophages, Di et al. reported that lysosomal acidification was CFTR-dependent and that fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes (at ~20 min after phagocytic uptake) was responsible for phagosomal acidification. We measured lysosomal acidification in J774 macrophages using a dextran-conjugate containing Oregon Green\u00ae 488 and tetramethylrhodamine and found that acidification was not impaired by CFTR inhibition (pH 4.48 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 4.42 \u00b1 0.03) . We also measured the kinetics of phagosomal acidification using a zymosan-conjugate containing 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (pKa ~ 6.4) and tetramethylrhodamine. Phagosomal acidification in J774 macrophages and murine alveolar macrophages began within 3 min of phagocytosis and reached steady-state by 10-15 min, in agreement with prior data in murine peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Acidification kinetics in J774 macrophages was not altered by CFTR inhibition, nor was acidification kinetics different in wild-type vs. CF alveolar macrophages. Our findings do not support the conclusion that phagolysosomal acidification in alveolar macrophages is CFTR-dependent, nor that it is impaired in CF. The mechanism of phagosomal acidification proposed by Di et al. is not in accord with our data or precedents in the literature. Because phagolysosomal acidification is central to the proposed mechanism linking defective CFTR chloride channel function with CF lung disease, our results do not support the involvement of CFTR in defective macrophage function in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Supported by CFF and NIH. pared to that of wild-type CFTR. The Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones play important roles in the protein quality control process within the ER. Hsp70 ATPase activity is regulated by multiple co-chaperones such as Hsp40, BAG-1 and HspBP1. Hsp105, a high-molecular-weight member of the Hsp70 family was recently shown to display nucleotide exchange activity for Hsp70s in vitro. Furthermore, Hsp105 was identified as a component of a CFTR-associated multiple protein complex using a global proteomic approach (Cell 127: 803-815, 2006) . In an attempt to explore the role of Hsp105 in CFTR conformational maturation in the ER, we over-expressed the co-chaperone in HEK293 cells and quantitatively analyzed its effect on the maturation and degradation of CFTR. Consistent with its role as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70s, over-expression of Hsp105 inhibits the ER export of wild-type CFTR and promotes its degradation. However, in striking contrast, over-expressing Hsp105 stabilizes \u2206F508 CFTR and promotes its ER export at reduced temperature. This effect is less pronounced at physiological temperature. The apparently opposite effects of Hsp105 on wild-type and \u2206F508 CFTR maturation and quality control, suggests distinct conformational maturation pathways for the two CFTR molecules, and reveals a specific role for Hsp105 in regulating \u2206F508 CFTR refolding. Such conclusion is reinforced by RNAi experiments and further supported by quantitative co-immunoprecipitation. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Hsp105 expression destabilizes \u2206F508 CFTR and reduces its export at reduced temperature, and Hsp105 shows more extensive association with the ER form of \u2206F508 CFTR than that of wild-type CFTR. Further analysis revealed that Hsp105 not only modulates the chaperone activities of Hsp70s but also alters their steady state levels within the cell, creating secondary effects on CFTR maturation and quality control. Further studies are necessary to achieve a better understanding of the machinery, pathway and mechanism of \u2206F508 CFTR conformational maturation at reduced as well as physiological temperatures, and this in turn will provide critical insights and key factors that are of potential value to the rescue of the trafficking defect of \u2206F508 CFTR.",

Ctr Hum Genet, Nat Inst Health, Lisboa, Portugal The most frequent mutation in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene, F508del, causes retention of its protein product, F508del-CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a core-glycosylated intermediate that is rapidly degraded. Therefore, most F508del-CFTR fails to traffic to the plasma membrane, where wild-type (wt) CFTR normally functions as a chloride (Cl-) channel. Retention, however, is not due to lack of function, since the mutant still retains some function if it reaches the membrane. Instead, it results from misfolding which is recognized by the ER quality control (ERQC) in which many intervenients, including molecular chaperones, participate. Identification of molecular partners involved in the disposal of F508del-CFTR to the proteasome is therefore crutial.",

Analysis of CFTR-mediated iodide efflux from these cells revealed that G550E is unable to rescue the functional defect of G551D. However, 4RK generated an efflux of iodide larger than that elicited by cells expressing G551D, albeit smaller than that of cells expressing wild-type (wt) CFTR. Consistent with these data neither 4RK nor G550E rescued the defective channel gating of G551D-CFTR. However, both revertants caused a small increase in G551D-CFTR activity by attenuating the prolonged interburst interval of G551D.

[4] Teem JL, Carson MR, Welsh MJ (1996) improves \u2206F508-CFTR intracellular trafficking in CF epithelial cells, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. To identify gene products with atlered abundance in response to 4PBA, we performed a differential display RT-PCR screen on RNA isolated from IB3-1 CF epithelial cells treated with 4PBA for 0-24 hours. We isolated a cDNA encoding StIP-1, a putative human STAT-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) interacting protein and confirmed that 4PBA causes transiently increased StIP-1 mRNA and protein abundance after 8 hours of exposure. StIP-1 was originally described as a scaffold protein that is required for ligand-dependent activation of STAT-3. StIP-1 is also identical to elongator protein 2 (Elp-2), a subunit of the multicomponent Elongator complex that stimulates RNA polymerase II activity. Interestingly, recent data suggests that Elongator may also regulate polarized secretion (Rahl, et al. (2005) , Mol. Cell, 17:841-853). We therefore hypothesized that StIP-1/Elp-2 would regulate \u2206F508-CFTR intracellular trafficking. In IB3-1 cells, StIP-1/Elp-2 associates with \u2206F508-CFTR in coimmunoprecipitation experiments after 4PBA treatment. In IB3-1 cells overexpressing StIP-1/Elp-2, immunofluorescence experiments suggested that \u2206F508-CFTR trafficked to the plasma membrane even in the absence of 4PBA treatment. StIP-1/Elp2 co-localized with markers of the Golgi (58 kDa Golgi protein) and exocytic vesicles (SNAP-25) when overexpressed in these cells. In contrast, overexpression of a deletion mutant of StIP-1/Elp-2 lacking the WD domain, or STAT-3 binding region, blocks the improvement of \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking in response to 4PBA in immunofluorescence and surface biotinylation experiments. This StIP-1/Elp-2 deletion mutant did not co-localize with Golgi or exocytic vesicle markers. Furthermore, immunofluorescence experiments also suggested that 4PBA causes colocalization of StIP-1/Elp-2 and Elp-1, another member of the Elongator complex that is often defective in Familial Dysautonomia. These data are consistent with StIP-1/Elp-2 regulating \u2206F508-CFTR intracellular trafficking in response to 4PBA. This regulation may occur in the context of 4PBA stimulating assembly of Elongator, which in turn may promote trafficking of exocytic vesicles carrying \u2206F508-CFTR to the plasma membrane.",

The in vivo folding of these hmCFTR chimeric proteins was indirectly evaluated from their maturation status, after their stable expression in novel BHK cell lines. Like wt-hCFTR, most chimeric proteins were processed within the cell. However, two chimeras failed to mature: clone 12b (mNBD1, amino acid (aa) residues 518-585) and clone 114c (mNBD2, aa 1260-1412). We compared the murine sequence of these two chimeras with that of hCFTR to determine the respective physico-chemical distances (PCDs) of their aa changes. Changes with higher PCD values were selected and in vitro mutagenesis performed to introduce these aa alterations into hCFTR cDNA. For clone 12b the selected changes were: E527Q, E528Q (PCD = 29); S531T (PCD = 58); K536Q (PCD = 53), I539T (PCD = 89) and K584E (PCD = 56).

AC DaPaula is a recipient of PhD fellowship SFRH/ BD/17475/2004 (FCT, Portugal We recently reported that the UPR decreases endogenous wild-type (WT) CFTR expression. As a follow up of these studies, we investigated the role of the folding deficient, \u2206F508 CFTR on UPR induction and identified a mechanism by which the UPR decreases CFTR expression. For these studies, we developed a cell line expressing recombinant \u2206F508 CFTR on the endogenous WT background (Calu-3 \u2206F) and established individual clones with different ratios of endogenous (WT) to recombinant (\u2206F508 CFTR) expression. Two clones which express 1:1 (Calu-3 \u2206FC3) and 1:8 (Calu-3 \u2206FC5) ratios of WT to \u2206F508 CFTR and CFPAC-1 cells expressing endogenous \u2206F508 CFTR were tested as models. The UPR was constitutively active in Calu-3 \u2206FC5 cells only. In Calu-3 \u2206FC3 induction of \u2206F508 CFTR expression resulted in UPR activation, indicating that high expression of \u2206F508 CFTR is required for UPR induction. Furthermore, following pharmacological induction of the UPR, endogenous CFTR mRNA decreased to undetectable amounts both in Calu-3 \u2206F and CFPAC-1 cells. The decrease in CFTR mRNA levels was not the result of shortened mRNA half-life. In contrast, using a human CFTR promoter driven reporter (pCFTR-Pluc), we demonstrate suppression of the CFTR promoter when the UPR is activated. Considering that correction of \u2206F508 CFTR is the main therapeutic approach for CF, it is important that \u2206F508 CFTR expressed at low levels, such as in vivo, does not activate the UPR. However, our results also reveal that \u2206F508 CFTR correctors have to be tested for UPR activation, since transcriptional inhibition in this setting may contribute to inefficient rescue in native cells or in vivo. Genistein, a naturally occurring tryrosine kinase inhibitor, at low concentrations (50\u00b5M) stimulates Wt -CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in a variety of cell and tissue types by an adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-independent pathway. Genistein has been shown to potentiate the channel function of \u2206F508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR channels by prolonging channel open time (Hwanget al., Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 273: C988-C998, 1997; Illeck et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 277: C833-C839, 1999) Patch clamp studies have provided indirect evidence that genistein may bind directly to CFTR and potentiate channel open probability by modifying the function of the nucleotide binding domains (Weinreich Et al., Pfl\u00fcgers Arch 434: 484-491, 1997) . The goal of the present study was to determine whether genistein activated purified and reconstituted CFTR protein as an initial step toward defining its molecular mechanism of action.",

In the presence of 100\u00b5M ATP, phosphorylated CFTR exhibited a low open probability (Po= 0.12). The addition of 50\u00b5M genistein, caused a significant increase to the open probability of CFTR (Po=0.76). Using an electrogenic flux assay on a population of purified and phosphorylated CFTR molecules, we determined that 50 \u00b5M genistein caused a potentiation (70% increase) of chloride channel activity in the presence of 100 \u00b5M ATP. These results suggest that this macroscopic assay of purified CFTR function is sufficiently sensitive to detect the effect of this potentiator. Currently, the consequences of genistein on the channel activity and ATPase activity of purified reconstituted \u2206F508-CFTR and G551D-CFTR are being assessed. Preliminary results suggest that in the presence of low ATP concentrations (10-100 \u00b5M),50\u00b5M genistein inhibits the ATPase activity of \u2206F508-CFTR, suggesting that it interacts directly with the nucleotide binding domains to alter their function.",

However, the mechanisms responsible for such cooperativity between these ion channels are unknown. Previous studies indicated that: cytoplasmic pH controls CFTR activity through effects on phosphorylation (Reddy et.al. 1998) . At pH 6.0, CFTR chloride conductance was reduced to 10\u00b15 mS/cm 2 , but incresed to 42\u00b17 mS/cm 2 at pH 8.0 (n=number of ducts=5). ENaC channel activity is also a function of cytosolic pH in heterologous expression systems (Chalfant et.al, 1999) . The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the cytosolic pH may mediate the cooperative effects that occur between CFTR and ENaC. We used basolaterally a-toxin permeabilized apical membrane preparations of native human sweat duct which expresses ENaC and CFTR robustly as an experimental system. We showed that while luminal pH had no effect, changes in cytosolic pH acutely affected ENaC activity. That is, acidic pH inhibited, while basic pH activated ENaC activity. Alkalinizing cytosolic pH from 6.8 to 8.5 increased ENaC conductance (gENaC) by 35\u00b11.8 mS/cm 2 (n=6). pH regulation of ENaC activity appears to be independent of CFTR and endogenous kinase activities because basic pH stimulated ENaC: a.) after deactivating CFTR by removing cAMP and ATP in normal ducts, b.) in the absence of CFTR in CF ducts, and c.) after blocking endogenous kinase activity with the non-specific kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. Na + /H + exchanger (NHE) may mediate changes in cytosolic pH as a function of intracellular Na + activity. NHE mRNA is expressed in the sweat duct and cytosolic pH responds to changes in Na + gradients across the basolateral membrane. Conceivably, when transport conditions are favorable and intracellular Na + is low, alkaline pH would allow ENaC and CFTR to cooperatively admit Na + and Clthrough the apical membrane. When conditions are unfavorable and intracellular Na + is excessive, acid pH would limit Na + and Clentry to protect the cell from disruptive changes in cell volume. Thus, changes in cytosolic pH may play a crucial role in coordinating the activities of ENaC and CFTR during transepithelial salt transport.",

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel that is normally expressed in the plasma membrane but is mislocalized in CF. To monitor trafficking we inserted super ecliptic pHluorin, a pH-sensitive variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Miesenbock G, De Angelis DA, Rothman JE (1998) Nature 394, 192-5) into the fourth extracellular loop of CFTR. This construct, which we call CFTR-pHluor, has weak fluorescence intracellularly that increases ~10-fold when it is inserted into the plasma membrane and the pHlour becomes exposed to more alkaline extracellular pH . Thus CFTR-pHluor should be less fluorescent than CFTR with the normal GFP fused to the N or C termini when situated in intracellular vesicles. Despite the insertion of an entire GFP in the middle of the channel protein, CFTR-pHluor trafficked to the membrane and patch clamp studies revealed little change in unitary conductance or open probability compared to wild-type CFTR. CFTR-pHluor enabled visualization of vesicle insertion events at the plasma membrane by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Faintly fluorescent vesicles containing CFTR were observed under the plasma membrane and eventually fusing with it to generate a burst of fluorescence. pHluorin inserted at the same position in \u2206F508-CFTR, the predominant mutant in CF, was retained in the ER where the pHluor remained partially quenched. When the folding defect was corrected by culturing cells at 29\u00b0C or treating them with known correctors, \u2206F508-pHluor trafficking was partially restored and total cell fluorescence increased. This enabled a quantitative analysis of \u2206F508-CFTR correction based on the increase in fluorescence in individual cells by flow cytometry. CFTR-pHluor may be most useful for microscope-based high-content screening studies of CFTR and \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking.

Physiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Type III Secretion System (T3SS) toxins of P. aeruginosa are important virulence factors in P. aeruginosa infections. One of the T3SS toxins, ExoS, has been shown to facilitate uptake and invasion of P. aeruginosa at airway surface epithelium. In mouse models of Pseudomonas pneumonia, infection with P. aeruginosa ExoS+ strains caused increased levels of fluid in lungs as determined at autopsy in contrast to infection with P. aeruginosa ExoSstrains. The exact molecular mechanism underlying these observations is not known. ExoS is a bifunctional protein with GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) activity at the N terminal domain and ADP ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) activity at the C terminal domain. We found that ExoS-GAP activity increases total cellular levels of mature (C band) Wild Type (WT) CFTR in CFBE41o-cells as measured by western blot analysis. This increase was mediated by decreased delivery of WT CFTR for lysosomal degradation. In contrast, ExoS-GAP failed to increase total levels of \u2206508 CFTR (B band). Interestingly, ExoS-GAP increased total levels of \u2206508 CFTR, bands C and B, following rescue with 4-phenylbutyrate. This indicates that targets of ExoS-GAP exist in CFTR trafficking beyond the ER degradation pathway. ExoS-GAP also brought about a corresponding increase in surface levels of mature WT CFTR as measured by surface biotinylation. In conclusion, we have shown that P. aeruginosa T3SS ExoS-GAP, upregulates total and surface levels of mature WT CFTR by modulating CFTR trafficking beyond ER, most likely by decreasing lysosomal degradation. The decrease in lysosomal degradation could be occurring in part by inactivation of small molecular weight G-proteins involved in delivery of WT CFTR to lysosomes. Increases in total and hence surface levels of CFTR could in part explain increased amounts of fluids seen in P. aeruginosa pneumonia mouse model treated with ExoS+ strains.",

In particular, whereas overexpression of NHERF1 rescues \u2206F508-CFTR at the cell surface, overexpression of CAL has the opposite effect on CFTR. CAL-mediated downregulation of CFTR requires a functional PDZ binding site. We have now shown that suppression of endogenous CAL cooperates with temperature rescue to stabilize functional \u2206F508-CFTR channels at the apical membrane in polarized bronchial epithelial cells.

Using a fluorescence polarization assay and peptide-array technology, we have now identified a high-affinity, CAL-selective peptide inhibitor. Compared to CFTR, this sequence binds CAL more tightly, but NHERF1 more weakly. Furthermore, we have shown that the CAL:CFTR interaction is the weakest among the known CAL-binding proteins, and that CFTR should thus be susceptible to selective displacement from the CAL binding site. Finally, we have designed cell-permeable peptides that allow us to test the hypotheses (a) that such compounds will specifically disrupt the CAL:CFTR interaction and (b) that such targeted stereochemical inhibition will stabilize the functional cell-surface expression of \u2206F508-CFTR in airway epithelial cells.",

Immunoprecipitation and GST-fusion protein pulldown experiments revealed that Hdj-2 interacted with ubiquitin. In steady-state, Over-expression of Hdj-2 elicited increasing both immature and mature forms of wt-CFTR, but it resulted in decreasing immature form of \u2206F508CFTR. Pulse-chase studies showed that co-expression of Hdj-2 promoted \u2206F508CFTR degradation, reducing its half-life from 85 to 50 min. In contrast, Hdj-2 expression did not significantly affect wt-CFTR biogenesis. These data are consistent with our finding that Hdj-2 shows a selective physical interaction with \u2206F508CFTR, which translates into a functional discrimination between the mutant and its wt counterpart. The HPD motif within the J-domain of Hdj-2, which is necessary for the co-chaperone to bind Hsp70 and stimulate its ATPase activity, was required for Hdj-2 mediated \u2206F508CFTR degradation. Mutation of the HPD motif retarded the degradation of \u2206F508CFTR and increased the steady-state levels of \u2206F508CFTR 3-fold. A role for Hsp70 in Hdj-2 mediated \u2206F508CFTR degradation was tested in which Hsp70 knockdown increased \u2206F508CFTR expression 3-4 fold. Hjd-2 regulates \u2206F508CFTR maturation and knockdown of endogenous Hdj-2 promoted \u2206F508CFTR and its cAMP-dependent anion conductance in airway epithelial cells. In contrast, we were unable to detect maturation of \u2206F508CFTR in Hsp70 knockdown experiments, indicating that the maturation of \u2206F508CFTR mediated by reduced Hdj-2 expression may be independent of Hsp70 function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Hdj-2 is a molecular sensor that can detect differences in the folding related to the \u2206F508CFTR maturation. These data also highlight a novel pathway for Hdj-2 linked, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of \u2206F508CFTR. Reduction of Hdj-2 expression or its association with \u2206F508CFTR promotes maturation of this mutant and therefore represents a potential therapeutic approach for cystic fibrosis. [Supported by NIH and CF Foundation] How the loss of CFTR function results in cholesterol accumulation within the cell is currently unknown. CFTR activation is driven by the cAMP and we propose that CF cells respond to the loss of CFTR activity by increasing the cAMP pathway in order to increase CFTR expression. To test this hypothesis, epithelial cells were treated with the phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) and PDE4 inhibitors milrinone and rolipram, respectively. Inhibition of PDE4 function with rolipram in wildtype cells leads to peri-nuclear free cholesterol accumulation identical to what is observed in CF epithelial cells as viewed by filipin staining, strongly implicating a cAMP-dependent pathway in the regulation of cholesterol trafficking. The PDE3-selective inhibitor milrinone had no effect on cholesterol trafficking suggesting specificity for the PDE4 pathway. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis in that both CF-model 9HTEo-pCEPR cells and mouse nasal epithelium (MNE) from Cftr -/-mice exhibit reduced protein expression of the cAMPspecific phosphodiesterases PDE4 compared to wt controls. The proposed consequence of a chronic amplification in cAMP signaling is altered cholesterol transport regulation. To address this potential role of PDE4 in cholesterol trafficking, free cholesterol was visualized using filipin staining in wild type cells that were treated with rolipram, a PDE4-specific inhibitor. Conversely, treatment of CF-model pCEPR cells with the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPs significantly improves cholesterol processing, further pointing to the involvement of the cAMP pathway. We propose that the cAMP pathway influences cholesterol processing through the regulation of \u03b2-arrestin-2 (\u03b2arr2) according to the premise that chronic increase in the cAMP pathway would initiate an elevation in \u03b2arr2 expression. \u03b2arr2 is an important regulator of adrenergic receptor recycling and organelle trafficking. Because \u03b2arr2 is pivotal in regulating endocytotic recycling pathways, it could also impact cholesterol processing. This predicted increase in \u03b2arr2 protein expression is observed in both CF-model pCEPR cells and Cftr -/-MNE compared to respective controls. Over expression of \u03b2arr2 in wt epithelial cells leads to CF-like peri-nuclear cholesterol accumulation further implicating a role for \u03b2arr2 in the development of this phenotype. Altered cholesterol trafficking in CFTR would lead one to expect different \u03b2arr2 localization throughout the cell. Further understanding of the implications of altered cAMP signaling and its relationship to aberrant cholesterol accumu-Rationale: We recently reported that VCP (valosin containing protein) physically interacts with gp78/AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor) to couple retrograde translocation of \u2206F508-CFTR to proteasomal degradation (Vij et al. JBC 2006) . Recent studies have revealed an alternative system to the proteasome for degradation of polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins termed the aggresome. Histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) is a unique cytoplasmic deacetylase capable of interacting with ubiquitin and mediating the accumulation of \u2206F508-CFTR in aggresome bodies.",

Biopharmaceutical Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China Deletion of the codon encoding the phenylalanine residue at position 508 (\u2206F508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis (CF). The \u2206F508 mutation results in a CFTR protein with impaired folding, trafficking and gating in human and rodents. The consequences of \u2206F508-CFTR mutation in other species have not been studied. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the \u2206F508 mutant of porcine CFTR in cell culture model. cDNA sequence encoding full-length porcine CFTR (pCFTR) was cloned from the lung by RT-PCR using primers designed according to porcine genomic sequences in two BAC clones (GenBank Accession No. AC092497 and AC092478) containing all exons of the porcine CFTR. pCFTR encodes a 1482-amino-acid protein that shows 92.3% identity to human CFTR. The phenylalanine residue at position 508 is conserved in pCFTR. Functional analysis of pCFTR stably expressed in Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells by short-circuit current assays indicated a cAMPactivated Cl-channel similar to human CFTR except that the sensitivity of pCFTR to the specific CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 is 25-fold lower than that of human CFTR. A \u2206F508 mutation of porcine CFTR was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Surprisingly, \u2206F508-pCFTR expressed as a func-tional chloride channel activated by forskolin in stably transfected FRT cells. Western blot analysis of COS7 and BHK cells transiently transfected with cMyc-tagged \u2206F508-pCFTR indicated a protein pattern identical to that of wildtype pCFTR. Immunofluorescence analysis of the transiently transfected cells demonstrated similar plasma membrane expression pattern of \u2206F508-pCFTR and wildtype pCFTR. These results clearly demonstrated unimpaired cellular processing of \u2206F508-pCFTR. However, the sensitivity of \u2206F508-pCFTR to forskolin activation (IC50~2.5 \u00b5M) was dramatically lower than that of wildtype pCFTR (IC50~0.5 \u00b5M), indicating a defect of channel gating by PKA phosphorylation. The present study provided the first evidence that the \u2206F508 mutation in mammalian CFTR does not result in impaired cellular processing that is closely associated with CF phenotype. We have optimized airway epithelial cell spheroid cultures for functional measurements of CFTR chloride conductance in order to screen smallmolecule activators and inhibitors. Spheroids, which are sealed spheroidal monolayers of airway surface epithelial cells with diameter 75-250 micron, were generated within 2 to 4 days after nasal brushing and suspension culture. Yields of up to 2000 spheroids were obtained from nasal brushing of a non-CF or CF subject. Approximately 3,000 spheroids could be prepared from one million freshly isolated human bronchial epithelial cells. We compared several electrophysiological and fluorescence methods to assay CFTR function in spheroids. Whole-cell current was measured in single spheroids following pipette immobilization and micropipette puncture of the solutionexposed apical cell membrane. Large, forskolin-stimulated whole-cell chloride currents were measured in non-CF spheroids. As an independent approach, transepithelial potential difference was measured by micropipette insertion into the spheroid lumen. For fluorescence detection, cell cytoplasm was stained with the halide indicators MQAE or LZQ. Fluorescently stained spheroids were immobilized on a coated coverglass or in a custom microfluidic chamber. Halide flux across the apical surface was measured in response to chloride-nitrate or iodide-chloride solution exchange, in the absence and presence of cAMP activators. The fluorescence assay is suitable for medium-throughput screening of \u2206F508 correctors and potentiators, with definitive verification of CFTR chloride channel function by whole-cell current analysis. An airway spheroid cultures provide a powerful approach to prioritize the efficacy of \u2206F508 correctors because of their rapid generation without prolonged culture, and their suitability for quantitative analysis of CFTR function. Supported by CFF and NIH. Background and Aims: CFTR has been shown to be expressed and functional in ventricular cardiomyocytes. However, to date, no physiological role for CFTR in the heart has been established. The aim of this study was to determine if CFTR plays a role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contraction rate. Methods: Cardiomyocyte contraction rate was assessed using the neonatal mouse beating assay. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from neonatal mice and cultured for 2-3 days until they formed a functional in sitium. Contraction rates were captured by video imaging and analyzed by MetaMorph in the presence and absence of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by isoproteronol (10 \u00b5M). Assessment of CFTR activity was determined by pharmacological inhibition by glibenclamide (100 \u00b5M), DPC (500 \u00b5M), and CFTR inh-172 (10 and 20 \u00b5M). The role of K ATP channels was assessed by 5-HD (100 \u00b5M). Results: Baseline contraction rate of vehicletreated (DMSO or H 2 O) cardiomyocytes was unchanged. Addition of isoproteronol caused a significant increase in contraction rate, which was sustained for at least 30 minutes. In contrast, application of glibenclamide to beating ventricular myocytes significantly, but transiently, inhibited cardiomyocyte contraction rate, with recovery occurring within 20 minutes. Glibenclamide did not affect the initial increase in contraction rate caused by isoproteronol stimulation, but inhibited sustained increases in isoproteronol-stimulated contraction rate. To determine if this was an effect of K ATP channel inhibition we examined the effect of 5-HD on contraction rate. In contrast to glibenclamide, 5-HD had no inhibitory affect on basal or isoproteronol-stimulated contraction rate, indicating glibenclamide's inhibitory effect was due to its inhibition of CFTR. To further verify this, we examined the effect of two other CFTR inhibitors, DPC and CFTR inh-172 on ventricular cardiomyocyte contraction rate. Both DPC and CFTR inh-172 elicited similar responses as glibenclamide, with a quick, but transient inhibition of baseline contraction rate and inhibition of sustained isoproteronol-stimulated increases in cardiomyocyte beating. Summary and Conclusions: Using neonatal murine ventricular myocyte cultures inhibition of CFTR leads to a significant, but transient inhibition of baseline ventricular cardiomyocyte contraction rate. Additionally, while inhibition of CFTR did not affect initial increases in beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated contraction rate, CFTR inhibition did prevent sustained increases in contraction rate. The data suggest that CFTR plays a role in modulating ventricular cardiomyocyte contraction rate during resting and adrenergic-stimulated conditions.",

Hsc70/Hsp70 was covalently immobilised onto the surface of carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) sensor chips (500 \u00b5M) and the real-time binding of purified NBD1 and control proteins quantified. In control experiments, anti-Hsc70 antibody 1B5 (20 nM; against residues 373-650) bound specifically to immobilised Hsc70 with high affinity (K D , 0.46 \u00b1 0.07 nM; n = 3) whereas bovine serum albumin (15 \u00b5M) did not interact (n = 10). Given the difficulties associated with expression of hNBD1 carrying the F508del mutation [2] it was not used in our SPR analyses. Instead, we used purified murine (m) NBD1 to quantify the impact of F508del on the strength of the Hsc70-NBD1 binding. In the presence of low concentrations of ATP (\u22645 uM), the affinity of NBD1 binding to immobilised Hsc70 was strengthened when F508 was deleted (wt, K D app , 1.20 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5M; F508del, K D app , 0.43 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5M; n = 3; P < 0.05). Interestingly, raising the concentration of MgATP weakened the binding of NBD1 (0.5 \u00b5M) to Hsc70 (wt, K I , 29 \u00b5M ATP; n = 2). Furthermore, deletion of F508 dramatically increased the concentration of MgATP required to destabilise the NBD1-Hsc70 interaction (F508del, K I , 221 \u00b5M ATP; n = 2). In summary, we used SPR to demonstrate that: (i) NBD1 of CFTR binds specifically to Hsc70, and (ii) the F508del mutation enhances the association of NBD1 with Hsc70. We are presently investigating the effect of co-chaperones and small molecules on the interaction of Hsc/Hsp70 with wt-and F508del-NBD1.",

GMAS UMR 6187, Poitiers, France; 3. facult\u00e9 medecine et pharmacie, Poitiers, France In order to gain a better insight into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of CFTR protein, we have functionally characterized a cystic fibrosis mutation: the CFTR-G622D, identified in patients with oligospermia (Vankeerberghen et al., 1998) . We examined CFTR chloride channel activity by patch-clamp analysis, in whole cell configuration, using Cos-7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-CFTR-wt or with the mutant GFP-CFTR-G622D. CFTR channels were activated by 10 \u00b5M Forskolin (Fsk), and, after stable activation 10 \u00b5M CFTRinh-172 was added. As GFP-CFTR-wt, G622D chloride channels elicit a time and voltage independent current in presence of 10 \u00b5M Fsk. GFP-CFTR-G622D current density at +40mV (52.08 \u00b1 5.8 pA/pF) is 1.5 fold less than GFP-CFTR-wt current density at +40mV (76.67 \u00b1 9.3 pA/pF). G622D mediated currents are blocked by 10 \u00b5M of the specific CFTR-inhibitor, CFTRinh-172 (Ma et al., 2002) . As expected, GFP-CFTR-wt channels are stimulated by 100 \u00b5M of the potent activator 5-butyl-6-hydroxy-10-chlorobenzo[c]quinolizinium chloride (MPB-91, Derand et al., 2001 ) with a current density at +40 mV of 127.44 \u00b1 25.49 pA/pF. Interestingly, no activation of G622D channels is recorded in presence of MPB-91: difference between currents recorded in basal condition or in presence of MPB-91 is not significant. Using iodide efflux experiments, we showed that CFTR-G622D mutant does not respond to several benzo[c]quinolizinium derivatives. However, the mutant channel can be activated by forskolin, IBMX and genistein. Thus, the mechanisms of activation by xanthine and isoflavone are not affected by the mutation.

Over-expression of Csp blocks the formation of mature, glycosylated (band C) CFTR and increases the level of immature (band B) CFTR, whereas knockdown of Csp elicits a marked increase in CFTR maturation (Zhang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 281: 11312, 2006) . Thus, Csp appears to block the exit of CFTR from the ER. When the ER exit of CFTR is blocked by a different mechanism, i.e. the expression of mutant Sar1-GTP (Sar1 H79G interferes with the formation of COPII vesicles), the steady-state level of immature CFTR is two-fold greater than that resulting from Csp over-expression. This finding suggests that Csp, in addition to blocking ER exit of CFTR, may facilitate the degradation of the immature protein. In agreement with this concept, Csp expression increased CFTR ubiquitylation.",

This finding suggests that the pro-degradative effect of Csp on immature CFTR requires Hsp70 binding/activation. CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that can target WT and \u2206F508 CFTR for proteasome-mediated degradation (Meacham et al., Nature Cell Biol. 3: 100, 2001) . We sought to determine weather CHIP was involved in the Csp-mediated degradation of CFTR. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments showed that CHIP associated with Csp. Also, Csp H43Q, which has reduced interaction with Hsp70, showed a similar level of CHIP interaction by co-IP, suggesting that their association did not depend on Hsp70 as a linker between the two proteins. A Csp mutant that is truncated after the cysteine string domain, which is its site of membrane attachment, blocked CFTR maturation as did WT Csp; however, this mutant did not decrease CFTR band B levels like WT Csp did. In addition, the Csp mutant missing its Cterminus did not associate with CHIP. These findings further implicate CHIP in the Csp-mediated degradation of immature CFTR, and they suggest that the C-terminus of Csp is a CHIP binding domain.",

            "text": "[ The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) represents the main Clchannel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells for cAMP-dependent Clsecretion. Mutations of this channel causes cystic fibrosis disease ; thus discovery of pharmacological activators of CFTR is crucial to design future medicament for protein therapy. Recently, we reported on the synthesis and screening of a small library of 6-phenylpyrrolo [2,3b] pyrazines (named RP derivatives) evaluated as activators of wild-type CFTR, G551D-CFTR and F508del-CFTR Clchannels (No\u00ebl et al, 2006) . This preliminary structure-activity relationship study identified 4-hydroxyphenyl and 7-n-butyl as determinants required for activation of CFTR (RP-107 and RP-108). Here we studied structure-function relationship of more than 190 compounds prepared by chemical synthesis, and the subsequent activation of CFTR channels. Within the 6-phenylpyrrolo [2,3-b] pyrazines family, we observed by iodide efflux technique that RP-173 bearing a 2hydroxyphenyl substituant is more potent (EC 50 = 16 nM) than RP-107 having 4-hydroxyphenyl substituant (EC 50 = 150 nM). By whole-cell patch clamp recording analysis, we confirmed that nanomolar concentrations of RP-173 activate linear chloride current in CHO cells stably transfected with human wild-type CFTR. This current was inhibited by 10 \u00b5M of CFTR inh -172. We also found significant stimulation of short circuit current (I sc ) by RP-173 (EC 50 = 9 nM) on colon of Cftr +/+ but not of Cftr -/mice mounted in Ussing chamber. Stimulation of I sc by RP derivatives was inhibited by glibenclamide. The structural analogue , was less potent (EC 50 = 347 nM). As for RP-107 compound, we found that the 7-nbutyl chain is crucial for RP-146 and RP-173 activity, and that the 2-hydroxyphenyl compounds without 7-n-butyl chain are unactive on CFTR. In this study, we showed that the presence of an hydroxyl group at position 2, 3 or 4 of the pyrrolopyrazine cycle determined the highest activity on CFTR. The most potent compound is the 7-n-butyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)5Hpyrrolo [2,3b] pyrazine . The potency of these agents indicates that compounds in this class may be of therapeutic benefit in CFTR-related diseases, including cystic fibrosis. The most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis (CF) is the deletion of F508 in the CFTR gene, which results in inefficient trafficking of the CFTR protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. The surface expression of the CFTR is usually quantified biochemically with Western blot or functionally with electrophysiological assays. However, these methods are labor intensive. We explore using fluorescence-based techniques for monitoring CFTR surface expression. Wild-type CFTR was tagged at the amino terminus with green fluorescent polypeptides (GFP-CFTR). The GFP-CFTR was either transiently or stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The cells were then treated with a red fluorophore that specifically labels plasma membranes. The fluorescent images were acquired with an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope. Two image channels were taken simultaneously. The green channel was excited with a 488nm laser, and signals within 500-545nm were collected. The red channel was excited with a 559nm laser, and signals within 570-670nm were collected. For a single focal plane, each image was composed of 1024*1024 pixels. Threshold values were given to both green and red channels. Pixels with an intensity value above the threshold were marked as green/red pixels. The green pixels in the first channel represent the signal of GFP-CFTR, and the red pixels in the second channel represent the location of the plasma membrane. Thus, pixels that are both green in the first channel and red in the second channel are the CFTR surface expression, and denoted as yellow pixels. The percentage of successfully trafficked CFTR is thus quantitatively estimated by the ratio of yellow to green pixels in the single plane. Alternatively, a stack of images from the same cell at different depth was collected and analyzed. The total amount and surface portion of CFTR expression are then determined by summing the correspondent pixels. The percentage of CFTR surface expression was then calculated and will be verified both biochemically and functionally. The approach is modified to study deltaF508 CFTR trafficking. We anticipate that the method can be used to screen CFTR correctors from a small or intermediate sized chemical database. Supported by CFFT and NIH. The most common mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (deletion of Phe-508 (\u2206F508) in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1)) causes retention of the \u2206F508 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). \u2206F508 mutation prevents conformational maturation of CFTR protein without altering profoundly the local structure of NBD1, but possibly by disrupting the interaction between NBD1 and NBD2. However, the individual role of NBD1 and NBD2 in biogenesis, folding, maturation and membrane stability of a full length CFTR is still under debate. Using splicing by overlap extension method (SOE by PCR), we generated six recombinant CFTR proteins with inverted or suppressed NBDs. The native boundary domains of NBD1 and NBD2 were respected for all mutants (Riordan J.R. et al. 1989 ) and their C-terminal tails preserved. The constructs were transiently or stably expressed in Cos-7 and BHK cells respectively. Immmunodetection and immunolocalization assays confirmed that deletion of NBD2 domain (N1-CFTR) did not alter the trafficking or the plasma membrane expression of CFTR. Both processes were abolished in the presence of \u2206F508 mutation. However, using whole cell patch-clamp configuration, we did not detect any cAMP-stimulated Clcurrent. Pulse-chase experiments established that the turnover of N1-CFTR is 3-4 fold faster (T1/2~ 5h) than its wild type counterpart (T1/2~ 18h). When we replaced NBD2 with NBD1 (2N1-CFTR), we could detect a faint plasma membrane expression associated with a weak Cl-channel activation. More surprisingly, the T1/2 of 2N1-CFTR coreglycosylated form was around 12h. When NBD1 was deleted (N2-CFTR) or substituted with NBD2 domain (2N2-CFTR), the expression and functional pattern were similar to CFTR \u2206F508. Furthermore, we showed that the N1-CFTR folding was not attenuated as demonstrated by protease susceptibility and SDSresistant thermoaggregation tendency, supporting the notion that N1-CFTR membrane stability requires NBD1-NBD2 interaction. Altogether, our results suggest that NBD1 domain is essential to form a foldable CFTR that satisfies ER quality control (ERQC) but correct inter-domain assembly is mandatory for its stability at plasma membrane. The results are also in agreement with previous suggestion that \u2206F508 mutation alters the interactions between NBDs and transmembrane domains of CFTR.",

The aim of our work is to determine if there is a functional interaction between CFTR and NPT2a.

Electrophysiological or biochemical experiments were performed 3 days after ARNs injection. Currents induced by 1mM Pi (IPi) were measured in voltage-clamped (-50 mV) oocytes that expressed NPT2a alone, or in oocytes co-expressing CFTR + NPT2a.

Using a two-bath electrodes configuration during voltage-clamping did not change this observation. This result suggests that when expressed in oocytes, CFTR is in functional interaction with NPT2a. Kinetic analysis (IPi as a function of Pi concentration) of NPT2a showed a reduction in Vmax but not in phosphate Km. This suggests that NPT2a membrane expression and/or activity is altered when CFTR is co-expressed. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on protein lysate derived from oocytes co-expressing CFTR and NPT2a suggested an interaction between the 2 transporters. Using a PKA activating cocktail as a PKC activator induced CFTR-mediated currents in CFTR+NPT2a expressing oocytes. In these oocytes, IPi is decreased by PKC activation (as expected from NPT2a regulation) but is increased shortly after exposure to the PKA activating cocktail. The increase of IPi observed under this condition is at variance to that expected from classical NPT2a regulation. In oocytes expressing NPT2a alone, both PKA activation and PKC activation reduced IPi. These observations suggest that in oocytes, CFTR expression modifies NPT2a regulation.",

An interaction is also suggested by the co-immunoprecipitation of CFTR and NPT2a. These results cannot discriminate between a direct or an indirect (via a third protein) interaction. To determine if an intracellular chloride concentration change may participate to the functional interaction, we are now measuring in CFTR+NPT2a expressing oocytes intracellular chloride activity (using chloride-sensitive microelectrodes) during the use of the PKA activating cocktail, and measuring IPi when PKA is stimulated in the presence of a specific CFTR inhibitor. Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most commonly inherited lethal pulmonary disorder in Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). To date, more than 1000 mutations were identified in CFTR and were associated with clinical disease. A phenylalanine deletion at position 508 accounts for 70% of CF genotypes in Caucasian populations, and determines CFTR misfolding and degradation by proteasome. Consequently, limited CFTR abundance leads to multiorgan disease, affecting the lung, pancreas, gut, liver, sweat glands and the reproductive organs. The past several years have witnessed an explosion of information regarding the identification and elucidation of molecules and pathways that are regulated by CFTR or that regulate CFTR activity. Genomics and proteomics technologies now offer the opportunity to examine global alterations in the mRNA and protein expression patterns of CF cells and tissues to elucidate the pathways linking defective CFTR to clinical disease. Here we describe systems biology methods that integrate heterogeneous datasets, including protein-protein interaction networks, gene expression and mass-spectrometry profiles, and mutation and genetic variation information, in order to identify the regulatory circuits and active subnetworks that are responsible for the progression and the severity of CF disease. The study will focus on correlations that define the key events in the CFTR folding and trafficking pathways that lead to pathogenesis and dysfunctions, and could provide insights and targets for intervention and therapy. The number of CFTR Cl-channels in the plasma membrane, and thus the transepithelial Cl-secretion is controlled, in part, by the endocytic trafficking of CFTR. Rab GTPases regulate the endocytic trafficking by acting as molecular switches that cycle between the GDP-bound (i.e. inactive) and the GTP-bound (i.e. active) state, associate with target membranes, and recruit downstream effectors. Rab5 facilitates CFTR endocytosis and Rab11a facilitates the recycling of internalized CFTR to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, Rab7 and Rab9 facilitate CFTR trafficking to the lysosome. The mechanism of sorting internalized CFTR for either recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation in the lysosome is not well understood. Recent evidence demonstrates that protein sorting occurs in Rab4 specific sorting endosomes. Presence of CFTR in Rab4 compartment has been previously demonstrated in human airway epithelial cells by electron microscopy. Yet, the role of Rab4 in CFTR trafficking has not been determined in these cells. Rab4 did not control CFTR trafficking in fibroblasts (BHK cells). However, it negatively regulated the plasma membrane expression of CFTR in the colorectal cells . The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of Rab4 in the endocytic trafficking of CFTR in polarized human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells and CFBE41o-cells stably expressing WT-CFTR or deltaF508-CFTR). Endogenous Rab4 coimmunoprecipitated with CFTR in Calu-3 cell and CFBE41o-cells. To determine if Rab4 plays a role in CFTR trafficking, CFBE41o-cells were transfected with either the FLAG-tagged, dominant negative (DN) Rab4 mutant deficient in GTP binding (GDP-locked; FLAG-Rab4-N121I) or with a non-specific cDNA control (GFP). If Rab4 sorts internalized CFTR to the recycling pathway, the DN Rab4 should inhibit recycling, and, thus, should decrease the plasma membrane expression of CFTR. If, on the other hand, Rab4 sorts internalized CFTR for degradation the DN Rab4 should inhibit CFTR degradation, increase CFTR recycling and thus, should increase the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane. The DN Rab4 increased CFTR expression in the plasma membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation. These data are consistent with the role of Rab4 in sorting internalized CFTR for degradation. Similar to overexpression of the DN Rab4, silencing endogenous Rab4 with double stranded small interfering RNA specific for the human Rab4 sequence increased the plasma membrane expression of CFTR and increased the CFTR mediated Cl-secretion across polarized CFBE41o-cells in Ussing chamber experiments. The plasma membrane half-life of deltaF508-CFTR is decreased compared to WT-CFTR. However, after silencing Rab4, the plasma membrane half-life of deltaF508-CFTR was similar to that of WT-CFTR, as determined by CFTR disappearance from the plasma membrane following incubation with cycloheximide. Our data are consistent with the role of Rab4 in sorting the internalized CFTR for degradation and are consistent with the changing paradigm for the role of Rab4 in protein trafficking (supported by the NIH Grant 1 P20 RR018787 and the CFF SWIATE03QO). The conformational changes underlying activation of phosphorylated CFTR by ATP remain unclear. In the present study we assessed the utility of labeling endogenous cysteine(s) in CFTR using an environmentally-sensitive fluorescent probe Alexa-488 in monitoring such changes in structure.",

A significant increase in fluorescence emission occurred in Alexa-488 labeled CFTR of 17 \u00b1 5 (AU) relative to empty liposomes one minute after the addition of activating nucleotide, 1 mM Mg-ATP (n = 3). The non-hydrolyzable analogue, 1mM Mg-AMP-PNP, failed to cause an increase in fluorescence of Alexa-488-labeled CFTR. However, the higher concentration of 5 mM Mg-AMP-PNP evoked an increase in fluorescence similar in magnitude to that of 5 mM Mg-ATP suggesting that the fluorescence response reflects structural changes relating to ATP binding to CFTR. Analysis by mass spectrometry identified the labeled residue as C647. This cysteine resides at the junction between NBD1 and the \"R\" domain in a region which has been suggested to be highly dynamic on the basis of multiple crystal structures. Our studies suggest that this flexible region around C647 of CFTR undergoes conformational change upon Mg-ATP binding such that it moves the Alexa 488 fluorophore into a relatively more polar environment. This finding presents a first case where conformational changes in the CFTR NBDs induced by ATP binding could lead to changes in the conformation of the R domain.",

            "text": "Acknowledgements Cystic Fibrosis is caused by mutations in the apical chloride channel CFTR with 90% of patients carrying at least one allele of the \u2206F508 mutation. This mutant form of CFTR is characterized by a trafficking defect in which it fails to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have previously reported that \u2206F508 CFTR is found in complex with Hsp90 and its co-chaperones in cell extracts suggesting that either this mutant form of the protein accumulates in on-pathway folding intermediates which result in its accumulation in the ER or that these intermediates include inhibitory factors leading to retention of \u2206F508 CFTR in this compartment. We have examined the role of one of these Hsp90 co-chaperones, FK506 binding protein 8 (FKBP8), in the life cycle of CFTR. FKBP8 is a unique member of the immunophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) which mediate the cis/trans interconversion of peptidyl-prolyl bonds, which is thought to represent a rate limiting step in protein folding. In order to establish a functional role for FKBP8 in CFTR stability and trafficking, we modulated the expression level of this protein in human bronchial epithelial cells endogenously expressing either wild type or \u2206F508 CFTR. A knockdown of FKBP8 by siRNA resulted in a destabilization of both wild type and \u2206F508 CFTR as well as a concomitant loss in channel activity of wild type and temperature corrected \u2206F508 CFTR. Conversely, over expression of FKBP8 resulted in a stabilization of the ER glycoform of \u2206F508 CFTR in both mammalian and yeast systems. These data suggest that FKBP8 is an essential component of the Hsp90-mediated folding machinery for both wild type and \u2206F508 CFTR, which supports the hypothesis that \u2206F508 CFTR accumulates in the ER in an on-pathway folding intermediate.",

            "text": "DMH CFTR folding involves a series of sequential, although potentially overlapping steps that involve i) formation, orientation and integration of (TMs), ii) helical packing, iii) folding of cytosolic and extracytosolic domains, and iv) establishing proper domain-domain contacts. This process begins cotranslationally and is facilitated by the Sec61 ER translocation machinery and a diverse group of lumenal and cytosolic chaperones. The most common inherited CFTR mutation, deltaF508, disrupts one or more early steps along this folding pathway. A major obstacle in understanding how deltaF508 causes CF is that the native folding environment, comprised of lipids, cytosolic and ER proteins, is not amenable to traditional biochemical and biophysical approaches. To overcome this problem we are developing a flu-orescence based analytical approach that enables one to directly access nascent ribosome-attached folding intermediates at virtually any stage of synthesis. The strategy requires incorporation of fluorescent probes into the substrate protein, which provide a highly selective means to monitor structural features at sub-nanomolar concentrations in highly complex biological mixtures. Polypeptides are synthesized in vitro from truncated mRNA templates to generate uniform cohorts of ribosome-bound nascent chains. Progressive stages of folding can then be evaluated using mRNA templates of different length. As proof-of-principle we have shown that fully synthesized GFP variants can be readily trapped in an unfolded state and complete their folding only after the entire nascent peptide has exited the large ribosomal subunit. This approach enabled us to measure real-time folding kinetics of extended peptide domains following synchronous ribosome release and compare fluorophore maturation of four fluorescent protein variants with different spectral properties CFP, GFP, Venus and mCherry. To extend this approach to CFTR and other general protein substrates, we are employing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" probes incorporated simultaneously into the substrate protein. An in frame N-terminal fusion to CFP provides the \"Donor\" fluorophore, while the \"acceptor\" fluorophore is incorporated at an engineered stop codon using a synthetic modified aminoacyl-suppressor tRNA. We are currently developing a 'molecular ruler' to correlate the efficiency of energy transfer with changes in the relative distance between probes in ribosome-bound and ribosome-released CFTR folding intermediates. FRET-based experiments are underway to evaluate folding of both N-terminal (1-80aa) and NBD1 (387-674aa) domains. These studies will provide new insight into the mechanism of cotranslational CFTR domain folding and provide a potential means to identify agents that correct the deltaF508 folding defect. Relationships between hypoxia, Ado release, and prostenoid production in ariway cells are not defined. In the present studies, we examined mechanisms governing hypoxia-induced production of prostenoids in CFBE41o-and Calu-3 monolayers. Using ELISA-based detection of prostenoid and leukotriene production, both Calu-3 and CFBE41omonolayers treated with Ado (10 \u00b5M) or arachidonic acid (AA, 10 \u00b5M, the parent molecule of prostenoids and leukotrienes) for 16 hrs led to increases in PGE 2 levels (1198-1283 \u00b1 64-145 pg/mg of total proteins vs controls 732 \u00b1 89 pg/mg in Calu-3 cells, 756-839 \u00b1 8-12 pg/mg vs controls 408 \u00b1 42 pg/mg in CFBE41o-cells, p<0.05 in both airway cell types compared with control). In contrast, LTB 4 and LTC 4 release were not stimulated by both maneuvers. We next used siRNA techniques to knockdown A2B adenosine receptor expression, and demonstrated durable knockdown of A2B AR expression to~25% of scrambled siRNA-treated controls following lipid-based transfection with siRNA directed against the A2B AR in CFBE41o-cells. Following siRNA knockdown of A2B AR expression, cells were exposed to hypoxic conditions (mucosal volume = 2 ml in 12-well plate), normoxic conditions (mucosal volume = 0.2 ml, FiO 2 = 0.21), and Ado (10 \u00b5M). Hypoxic stress led to high levels of mucosal PGE 2 production (1613 \u00b1 102.8 pg/mg vs controls 495 \u00b1 19.6 pg/mg, p<0.01) that was sensitive to A2B AR knockdown (743 \u00b1 70.6 pg/mg, p<0.01). Exogenous Ado also stimulated PGE 2 production, but this effect was small relative to hypoxia. We next examined basolateral effects of Ado and AA on transmucosal Clsecretion in CFBE41o-and Calu-3 cells grown as monolayers on permeable supports and conducted Ussing chamber analysis under voltage clamp conditions. Addition of Ado and AA to the basolateral membrane (10 \u00b5M) activated transmucosal Clsecretion [18.94 \u00b1 4.07 \u00b5A/cm 2 (Ado) and 14.30 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5A/cm 2 (AA) for Calu-3 cells; and 12.65 \u00b1 2.31 \u00b5A/cm 2 (Ado) and 18.96 \u00b1 1.24 \u00b5A/cm 2 (AA) for CFBE41o-cells expressing wtCFTR] that was sensitive to basolateral blockade with barium Cl -(10 mM). Isc by either agonist was stimulat-ed in the presence and absence of apical glybenclamide (200 \u00b5M), adenosine deaminase (ADA -2U/ml) and hexokinase (HEXO -2U/ml), confirming that the effects were specific for the basolateral membrane and could be accomplished with or without CFTR activity. These results demonstrate that hypoxia is sufficient to stimulate PGE 2 production through A2B ARs, and that both Ado and AA activate basolateral K + channels to promote transepithelial Clsecretion. The findings further support a model in which Ado (and prostenoids) regulate Cltransport through effects on both the apical and the basolateral membrane, and elucidate molecules that couple the two membranes as part of the normal Clsecretory response. Hypoxia would be predicted to increase local prostenoid production through Ado release and stimulation of A2B ARs, and further highlight a unifying model by which local hypoxia promotes inflammation in airway epithelia.

            "text": "Low levels of tissue oxygen -observed in lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis -initiate a signaling cascade resulting in altered transcription of genes possessing a hypoxia response element (HRE). We recently used gene chip mRNA array, quantitative RT-PCR, protein analysis, and functional (short circuit current) assays to show that CFTR expression is strongly repressed by hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. Among several thousand human mRNAs suppressed by low ambient oxygen, CFTR was among the most strongly inhibited (by 10-20 fold) in a cell model system. However, CFTR and the vast majority of other repressed genes lack a traditional HRE. Because hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) acts primarily as a transcriptional activator, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia mediated suppression of mammalian genes are not well understood. We therefore tested the hypothesis that microRNAs play a central role during transcriptional regulation of genes such as CFTR. MicroRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, short noncoding RNA sequences believed important for repression of gene expression. Some reports have estimated that at least 30% of protein-coding genes are regulated by microRNAs. Thousands of microRNAs have been predicted in the human genome by available algorithms (e.g. PalGrade, MiRscan, and ProMiR) and several hundred experimentally validated. The CFTR gene contains 16 predicted target sites for 13 microRNAs in the 3'UTR, including hsa-miR-383 (nucleotides 1309-1331 of the CFTR 3'UTR), hsa-miR-449 (nt 1443-1463) and hsa-miR-509 (nt 1041-1063). However, no study to date has examined the effect of microRNAs on CFTR message levels, or the influence of microRNAs during the CFTR response to environmental perturbations such as hypoxia. We therefore performed a global, genome-wide analyses of both mRNAs and microRNAs expressed during hypoxia (using air/liquid or liquid/liquid interface culture systems) in HT29 (colonic epithelial) cells that robustly express CFTR. We found that approximately 9% of microRNAs were significantly altered by hypoxia, as judged by miRNA profiling (Ambion mirVana\u2122 Bioarray 1566v2, Asuragen microRNA Expression Profiling Service). Comparison of these hypoxia-related microRNAs with expression profiles of their predicted targets indicated a much lower level of correlation than has been previously hypothesized by others. We show that none of the microRNAs predicted to regulate CFTR are altered in HT29 (in response to hypoxia). These findings are therefore consistent with the notion that highly expressed genes in a particular tissue type are not co-expressed with their predicted regulatory microRNAs. Our data also indicate that microRNAs do not mediate the hypoxic repression of CFTR via the 3' UTR. Supported by NIH and CFF. 1 1. Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; 2. Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada The \u2206F508 mutation impairs CFTR maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane and results in a partially functional chloride channel that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. Using our highthroughput trafficking assay, we previously showed that the quinoline KM60, a structural analogue of sildenafil, corrects the \u2206F508-CFTR processing defect and leads to a significant increase in CFTR surface expression after 2 h treatment with 10 \u00b5M and after 24 h treatment with 10 nM according to detection of mature CFTR in Western-blots. Additional studies have now been carried out with other preparations to assess the functionality of \u2206F508-CFTR following rescue by KM60 treatment.",

Exposure to 10 \u00b5M KM60 for 2 h partially restored iodide efflux responses to 10 \u00b5M forskolin + 50 \u00b5M genistein in both cell line. After 24 h incubation, rescue of the mutant protein in BHK cells still required 10 \u00b5M, whereas 100 nM was sufficient in the human cell line CFBE. Iodide efflux assays were performed at different times following KM60 wash out to functionally assess the stability of the rescued mutant protein. cAMP-stimulated iodide efflux was still detectable 6 h after removing KM60, but responsiveness was lost after 24 h in both cell types. Electrophysiological studies were performed to examine the channel activity of \u2206F508-CFTR rescued by KM60 treatment. Incubation with 10 \u00b5M KM60 for 48 h increased cAMP-responsive \u2206F508-CFTR current density in HEK293 whole-cell patches ~6-fold. The conductance was time-and voltage-independent, anion selective, and strongly inhibited by glibenclamide. Incubating polarized CFBE monolayers with 20 \u00b5M KM60 increased the forskolin + genistein-stimulated short-circuit current after 48 h, and this response was inhibited by CFTRinh172 (10 \u00b5M). Permeabilization of the basolateral membrane with nystatin confirmed the apical location of the forskolin + genistein-stimulation. Ussing chamber experiments also revealed trafficking correction in ileum that had been excised from Cftrtm1Eu mice homozygous for \u2206F508. When the ileum was pre-incubated with 20 \u00b5M KM60 for 4-6 h, the forskolin + genistein-stimulation of short-circuit current was significantly increased when compared to untreated intestine. These results confirm partial correction of \u2206F508-CFTR by KM60 in unpolarized cells and in human polarized epithelial cell monolayers and ex-vivo intestine isolated from \u2206F508-CFTR mice. This work was supported by the BREATHE program funded by the CCFF and CIHR, CIHR, CFFT, and G\u00e9nome Qu\u00e9bec. Primary sequence and overall structure of human CFTR overlaps significantly with murine, rabbit and other homologues, a feature that has limited generation of conformation specific reagents to address CFTR folding. Because regions of \u2206F508 CFTR exposed extracellularly may exhibit aberrant topology (JBC 279:39620-7), probes that identify CFTR from the extracellular surface could be useful to 1) verify plasma membrane localization of \u2206F508 CFTR, 2) discriminate wild-type from mutant protein, and 3) provide a means of determining whether small molecule \"correctors\" of the \u2206F508 processing lead to a native (wildtype) CFTR configuration. Our laboratories are investigating phage-display techniques suitable for detecting properly folded extracellular domains of CFTR. Two large phage libraries encoding 7 or 12 amino acid sequences (approximately 10 9 phage per library) were panned against extracellular regions of CFTR in HeLa cells.",

Bound bacteriophage was dislodged after multiple washings by exposure to an acidic elution buffer and amplified to increase copy number (five rounds of antigen selection for each library, Eur J Biochem 268:2004-12). Supernatants from microtiter wells expressing phage were analyzed for binding to parental (no CFTR), wt or \u2206F508 CFTR expressing HeLa cells. Using this method we obtained enrichment of phage at the surface of cells expressing wt or \u2206F508 CFTR. An example using a 7-amino acid sequence (10 10 phage) with specificity for \u2206F508 CFTR (representative of four repeat experiments) is shown in a binding assay with 10 6 HeLa cells/condition. Reagents such as these can be further optimized by constructing second generation libraries using core recognition sequences (derived from the initial screen) and surrounding the core epitopes with random amino acid diversity. These experiments are intended to identify peptides with high binding affinity (nM binding constants) that recognize native CFTR epitopes exposed extracellularly. Because there is evidence that low temperature corrected \u2206F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane is misfolded, these probes may ultimately distinguish wild-type CFTR from the surface targeted \u2206F508 mutant and be useful as drug discovery reagents.

Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells were transfected with \u2206F508-CFTR and a stable cell line selected with G418. Cells were grown on transwell filters and studied under short circuit current (I SC ) conditions in Ussing chambers. I SC measurements were performed at 27\u00b0C. The basolateral membrane was permeabilized with \u03b1 toxin and chloride currents were measured with a serosal to mucosal chloride gradient. ATP (1 mM) and GTP (100 \u00b5M) were added to the serosal bath. CFTR channel activity was stimulated with cAMP (100 \u00b5M), IBMX (100 \u00b5M) and genistein (30 \u00b5M). Cells were treated with correctors or vehicle (DMSO) at 24 and 48 hours before the I SC measurements. A subgroup of cells were temperature corrected at 27\u00b0C for 48 hours for comparison. Because only modest currents were observed even in the temperature corrected cells (3 -6 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) cells were treated for 48 hours with 5 mM sodium butyrate and 30 nM dexamethasone to enhance the observed currents. Under these conditions temperature corrected cells displayed stimulated chloride currents of ~100 \u00b5A/cm 2 that were 6-8-fold greater than cells maintained at 37\u00b0C. Correctors C4 (N- 5' ]bithiazolyl-2'-yl]-benzamide) and C1 (6-(1H-Benzomidazol-2-ylsulfanylmethyl)-2-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-quinazolin-2-ylamino)pyrimidin-4-ol) caused a modest rescue of \u2206F508-CFTR chloride currents compared to cells maintained at 37\u00b0C (C4, 1.7-fold; C1, 1.3-fold) but far below the effect of temperature correction. Rescue by C4 was concentration dependent with a significant observable effect at 300 nM and a maximum effect at 1 \u00b5M. Rescue by C1 was observed at only 3 \u00b5M, lower concentrations had no effect and higher concentrations caused an inhibition of the stimulated chloride currents. Compounds C2 -piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-4-piperidin-1-yl-quinazoline) (1 to 10 \u00b5M), C3 (4-Cyclohexyloxy-2-{1- [4-(4- methoxy-benzensulfonyl)-piperazin-1yl]-ethyl}-quinazoline) (1 to 10 \u00b5M) and 4 phenylbutyrate (3 mM) did not significantly increase the stimulated chloride currents. All four compounds C1 -C4 caused significant decreases in the transepithelial resistances at the higher concentrations (3 -10 \u00b5M) suggesting some degree of cytotoxicity.",

CFTR contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSD), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), and a regulatory domain that require proper assembly for chloride channel activity. The most prevalent disease causing mutation, CFTR\u2206F508, arises from deletion of phenylalanine 508 in the NBD1 domain. The CFTR\u2206F508 mutant is translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, but is unable to attain its native state and accumulates in a kinetically trapped conformation that is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (1) . The nature of the misfolded CFTR\u2206F508 intermediate that is selected for premature degradation is not clear and is a topic of great interest (2) . Recent work in the Cyr lab indicate that defects in CFTR and CFTR\u2206F508 folding are sensed by two different E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that are located in the ER membrane and cytosol (3) . The membrane-associated Derlin-1/RMA1 E3 complex appears to recognize early folding defects of CFTR that may involve assembly of MSD2 into a complex with the amino-terminal regions of CFTR. In contrast, the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP E3 complex appears to sense folding defects that occur after synthesis of the NBD2 domain. Misfolded CFTRs recognized at either checkpoint are retained and degraded via the proteasomal pathway. The presence of dual protein quality control (QC) checkpoints suggests a mechanism by which the folding status of CFTRs membrane and cytosolic domains are sequentially monitored prior to its escape from the ER. Currently little is known about how these ERQC complexes sense misfolded substrates.",

In addition, because it is unknown at what point of CFTR biogenesis that the chemical correctors act to facilitate folding, we have determined how the chemical correctors affect the folding of different biogenic intermediates. Our results indicate that the correctors act in a post-translational manner to influence assembly of CFTR sub-domains.

The two chimeric cDNAs and intact human P-gp cDNA were cloned into the C. elegans ubiquitous expression vector pS235 and injected into mutant nematode strains for multidrug resistance genes [3] . The effect on the nematodes phenotype was evaluated by an assay of heavy metal sensitivity (2.0 mM arsenite), as described [3] . Our quantitative results show that the P-gp/wt-CFTR chimera increases the resistance to arsenite when injected into the pgp-1/pgp-3 C. elegans double mutant, whereas P-gp/F508del-CFTR causes no effect. These preliminary results indicate it is possible to generate two distinct nematode phenotypes caused by each of the transgenic chimeras (P-gp/wt-CFTR and Pgp/F508del-CFTR). They also suggest that the same folding defect impairing F508del-CFTR function in CF may be responsible for the loss of heavy metal resistance function by the P-gp/F508del-CFTR chimera. These chimeras are currently under test in pgp-1/pgp-3 double and in pgp-1/pgp-3/mrp-1 triple C. elegans mutants. Analysis of these strains by RT-PCR showed that the mRNAs from the two P-gp/CFTR chimeras have low expression levels. This led us to produce more robust constructs, including: 1) to test chimera expression under the C. elegans endogenous pgp-1 or intestinal-specific (potent) promoters; and 2) to develop P-gp chimeras with a full CFTR-NBD1.",

The phospho-regulation of R region interactions with NBD1 likely contributes to the regulation of CFTR channel function by modulating R region interactions with NBD1 at the NBD1/NBD2 dimerization interface, consistent with NBD1 crystal structures that include the regulatory extension (RE) comprising the first 20 residues of the R region (1). This regulation likely occurs via a dynamic complex where multiple segments of nonphosphorylated R region with \u03b1helical propensity transiently engage NBD1 and are released.

            "text": "The \u2206F508-CFTR mutation, the most common gene mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF), results in diminished plasma membrane expression of CFTR, leading to loss of functional CFTR and altered mucociliary clearance. This impairment promotes chronic infection of CF patients by the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We previously reported that a secreted protein from P. aeruginosa (CFTR Inhibitory Factor (CIF)) reduces the wt-CFTR and \u2206F508-CFTR-mediated chloride secretion and the plasma membrane expression of CFTR by decreasing endocytic recycling of CFTR. The aim of the current study was to investigate the mechanism by which CIF is secreted by P. aeruginosa and delivered to human airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-). In this study, we show that CIF is packaged in outer membrane vesicles (OMV) for secretion from P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, CIF secretion via OMV was increased when the bacteria were exposed to airway epithelial cells. Changes in CIF protein level or bacterial growth did not account for the increase in CIF secretion. Purification and application of P. aeruginosa OMV to airway epithelial cells caused a decrease in plasma membrane expression of CFTR. The decreased plasma membrane CFTR expression was followed by increased ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of CFTR. CIF delivery to the airway epithelial cells via OMV showed a more robust decrease in plasma membrane CFTR expression, in comparison with CIF delivery as purified protein. To investigate the mechanisms whereby CIF enters epithelial cells, Optiprep gradient fractionation experiments were conducted in polarized airway epithelial cells. In airway epithelial cells treated with P. aeruginosa OMV, CIF was associated with airway cell lipid rafts. Pharmacological inhibition of lipid raft formation with Filipin III blocked the decrease in CFTR plasma membrane expression upon treatment with OMV. These studies demonstrate that CIF is released by P. aeruginosa via OMV and enters the airway epithelial cells through lipid rafts. Upon entry into the epithelial cell, CIF increases the ubiquitination and degradation of CFTR and redirects CFTR trafficking from the recycling pathway to the lysosomal-degradative pathway. These data suggest that chronic infection of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung may reduce the efficacy of therapeutics developed to increase plasma membrane expression of the mutant \u2206F508-CFTR (supported by the NIH 5 RO1HL074175-06 and 5 T32-DK007301-29). 1 1. Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA; 2. Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA We have identified and cloned a secreted protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa PA14 and clinical isolates), designated CFTR inhibitory factor (CIF). CIF reduces the apical membrane expression of CFTR and inhibits the CFTR-mediated chloride ion secretion by human airway epithelial cells expressing wt-CFTR and dF508-CFTR. CIF does not have general effects on protein trafficking, as the localization and expression of gp114, Na + -K + -ATPase, and the transferrin receptor were not affected. CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. ABC proteins are ATP-dependent transporters involved in exporting a wide variety of cytotoxic agents across the plasma membrane. P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1, MDR1 gene product), also an ABC transporter, is one of the major drug-efflux pumps expressed in normal tissues, as well as in many human cancers. Over-expression of Pgp results in reduced intracellular drug concentration and reduced cytotoxicity, conferring multi-drug resistance (MDR) to cancer cells. The aim of the current study was to examine whether CIF also affects Pgp expression in the plasma membrane, which could be exploited as a potential therapeutic strategy for restoring the sensitivity to Pgp-transported drugs in cancer chemotherapy. CIF significantly reduced the apical expression of Pgp in MDCK cells stably transfected with GFP-tagged Pgp (MDCK-GFP-MDR1 cells) and in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells, which express endogenous Pgp in the apical plasma membrane. The drug sensitivity of MDCK-GFP-MDR1 cells to doxorubicin, a Pgp substrate, was evaluated in the absence and presence of CIF by measuring the EC 50 . CIF reduced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin by 100-fold. Neither CIF nor vehicle alone had a cytotoxic effect. The drug sensitivity of the parental cell line, MDCK-C7, that expresses 4-fold less Pgp than the transfected MDCK cells, to doxorubicin was also increased by 20-fold. By contrast, CIF had no effect on the EC 50 values of Cisplatin (a substrate of MRP2) and Etoposide (a substrate of MRP1), suggesting that the alteration of the sensitivity to doxorubicin was due to decreased apical expression of Pgp, but not other ABC transporters. These results suggest that although CIF may be an obstacle to therapeutic attempts to restore the apical expression of CFTR in the CF lung, it could be useful for the development of a novel class of inhibitors of Pgp aimed at increasing the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs (Supported by the NIH (5 RO1 HL074175)).",

Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by an inflammatory state and susceptibility to chronic lung infections. A common clinical finding is dyslipidemia characterized by altered plasma free fatty acid patterns, low plasma HDL levels and increased phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. It is not clear how CFTR mutations relate to lipid abnormalities. It was shown that defective CFTR is associated with decreased uptake of sphingolipids (SL). SL homeostasis is tightly regulated and metabolites are relevant to lipid metabolism and CF. SL synthesis (SLS) correlates with activity of SREBP, a key transcription factor of lipid metabolism; ceramide-1-phosphate, a SL metabolite, is a regulator of PLA2 that is highly activated in CF. We investigated the hypothesis that SLS is increased in CF. Experiments were carried out in airway epithelial cell lines that express defective CFTR (C38 / IB3), no CFTR (16HBE sense / antisense) and overexpress CFTR (A549 cells infected with AdCFTR or AdControl). SLS was assessed using radioactive tracers 3H-serine (de-novo SLS) and 3H-sphinganine (recycling pathways). Ceramide and sphingomyelin mass were determined enzymatically. Neutral and alkaline sphingomyelinase activity was assessed using 3H-sphingomyelin as substrate. SREBP mediated gene transcription was assessed using SRE-promoter assays. Cholesterol synthesis was evaluated by incorporation of 3H-acetic and 3H-mevalonic acid. Cholesterol mass was determined by gas-chromatography. ABCA-1 expression was determined by western blot analysis. PLA2 activity was measured using fluorescent phospholipid substrates. SLS was post-transcriptionally increased in cells expressing defective or no CFTR through the de-novo pathway (133 % \u00b1 15% for IB3; 78%\u00b1 12% for 16HBE-antisense; p<0.05 ) and the recycling pathways (38% \u00b1 11% or IB3; 27% \u00b1 12 % for 16HBE-antisense; p<0.05). Ceramide mass was increased by 50 % (\u00b1 18 %) in 16HBE antisense, 36 % \u00b1 9% in IB3 cells. Sphingomyelin mass was increased 2-fold in IB3, up to 3-fold in 16HBE antisense cells. Neutral and alkaline sphingomyelinase activity was increased up to 3-fold in both cell lines. SRE-mediated gene expression was increased up to 2-fold in IB3 and by 50 % in 16HBE-antisense cells. Overexpression of CFTR in A549 decreased SLS and SREBP activity up to 40%. Free cholesterol synthesis was increased by 60 % in IB3 and by 30 % in 16HBE antisense. Expression of the cholesterol efflux receptor ABCA-1 was decreased in IB3 and 16HBE antisense compared to controls. SL mass, SRE-mediated gene transcription and PLA2 activity were decreased following incubation with inhibitors of SLS in IB3 and 16HBE antisense cells. Conclusion: Defective CFTR or lack of CFTR expression correlates with 1) increased SLS synthesis and SL mass; 2) increased SREmediated gene transcription and free cholesterol synthesis; 3) decreased expression of the ABCA-1 cholesterol efflux receptor. Inhibition of SLS decreases SRE-mediated gene transcription and PLA2 activity. Dysfunctional SLS is a newly recognized pathway associated with defective CFTR and a possible therapeutic target in CF. The ability to make accurate, reproducible measures of mucociliary and cough clearance (MCC/CC) in CF patients is critical to assessment of new therapies designed to improve MCC/CC function, and thus decrease pulmonary infections and decline in lung function. For example, using MCC/CC methods developed in our laboratory, we showed that 2-week treatment with aerosolized hypertonic (7%) saline (HS) led to a sustained increase in MCC and improved lung function in CF patients (Donaldson et al, N Eng J Med 2006; 354:241) . The MCC/CC technique involves patient inhalation of radiolabeled particles followed by gamma camera scanning to determine the rate of particle movement from the lungs. While a few CF centers have shown the capability to measure MCC/CC, the techniques across these centers are not standardized, making comparison of results difficult. It is vital to develop standard, simplified techniques for these measures to make larger CF patient populations available for such studies.",

Protocol #1 was identical to that used in recent studies, and incorporates a Devilbiss 646 jet nebulizer to generate 5 \u00b5m MMAD (GSD = 2.0), aqueous droplets containing suspended Tc99m-sulfur colloid particles. Tidal volume and inhaled/exhaled flow rates were guided by a volume signal displayed on an oscilloscope. Protocol #2 was further standardized and simplified to allow use at other centers. This protocol utilized the same nebulizer, but triggered by a commercial dosimeter (Spira Electro 2, Finland) during inhalation as the subject breathed in time to a metronome (30 breaths/min) at flow rate of 0.5L/sec. Subjects controlled inspiratory flow rate by feedback from a digital flow readout on the dosimeter. Repeat measurements of MCC/CC were made in 8 healthy subjects and 5 mild CF patients to compare MCC/CC variables following radioaerosol inhalation using Protocols #1 and #2. There were no differences in particle deposition (i.e. central to peripheral ratio, or \"C/P\"), or clearance of particles through 90 minutes and 24 hours in either subject group. These data suggest that the new methodology (protocol #2) will be useful and easily employed by other CF centers to test effectiveness of new therapies for CF.",

This protocol used a nebulizer that generated very large droplets (9.5 um MMAD, GSD =2.0) and subjects inhaled at very slow flow rates (~80ml/sec). It was designed to provide greater bronchial airway deposition and thus an \"improved signal\" for MCC/CC evaluation. Indeed, this methodology produced a larger average C/P and significantly greater particle clearance from the lung compared to the other standardized methodology (protocol #2) (C/P = 1.77 vs. 1.60; 90min clearance = 25% vs. 18%; 24hr clearance = 54% vs. 35%, respectively). Interestingly, the greater fraction of clearance between 90min and 24hr may also reflect heightened ability to assess clearance from smaller airways, which could be particularly important in CF.

            "text": "Previous clinical trials in cystic fibrosis (CF) indicate that anti-inflammatory therapy probably will not result in improvement in lung function, but will slow the rate of decline. This imposes constraints on study design for new anti-inflammatory agents, requiring that they use many patients over long periods. It is highly desirable to design a strategy for evaluation of antiinflammatory agents that will allow for the selection of only the most promising agents for Phase III trials. Sputum induction (SI) samples lower respiratory tract secretions and permits measurement of inflammatory markers. The purpose of this study was to assess the measurement of inflammatory markers in induced sputum as one such strategy by using ibuprofen as the test agent because it has demonstrated clinical benefit in CF. If changes in inflammatory markers are detectable in ibuprofen treated patients, then SI might serve as a quick, noninvasive method by which to select the most promising anti-inflammatory agents for further study. Methods: In this twoarm (ibuprofen and no treatment), open-label, parallel group study, 114 CF patients >/= 10 years of age with mild to moderate lung disease were screened at 16 sites. SI was performed on days 0, 14, 42 and 56. Patients in the ibuprofen group received drug on days 14-42. 82 subjects met eligibility criteria. 40 were randomized to ibuprofen and 40 to no treatment. 63 subjects (32 ibuprofen and 31 no treatment) completed the study through day 42 and comprise the intent-to-treat efficacy population. A maximum of 60 subjects (32 ibuprofen and 28 no treatment) and a minimum of 47 subjects (23 ibuprofen and 24 no treatment) across all markers had acceptable inflammatory marker values at both Days 14 and 42. Within group and between group comparisons were made. Results: With respect to the within group comparisons (before and after ibuprofen), most inflammatory markers slightly decreased in the ibuprofen group and increased in the no treatment group. For ibuprofen patients, mean changes were most apparent for IL-6 (-0.13 log pg/ml, p=0.04) and % neutrophils (PMNs) (-4%, p=0.073). With respect to the between group comparisons (ibuprofen vs. no treatment), differences were strongest for IL-6 (0.03 log pg/ml, p=0.0237), percent PMNs (7%, p=0.085), and absolute PMN count (0.14 cells/ml, p=0.166). Fourteen days after discontinuing ibuprofen, inflammatory mediators tended to increase. There was no difference in AEs between the two groups, and SI was generally safe. Conclusions: 1. Overall, SI is well-tolerated in patients >/= 10 years, 2. A 4-week treatment period may not be long enough to study anti-inflammatory drugs, 3. With respect to changes in inflammatory markers associated with anti-inflammatory therapy, the effect size is small and the variance of the effect is small in clinically stable patients. 4. Measuring inflammatory markers in induced sputum has potential as a screening tool for studying anti-inflammatory drugs in CF, 5. Further studies of SI in CF are warranted.

            "text": "In preparation for our gene therapy clinical trial programme we are currently assessing a number of sputum biomarkers including viscosity and elasticity, total solids and DNA content and 24 hr sputum weight. We tracked and correlated these biomarkers in CF patients (12 years and over) during a course of IV antibiotics (Ab) by collecting samples on several occasions [visit (V)1: at the start of Ab treatment, V2: at the end of Ab treatment (generally after 2 weeks) and interim periods]. To ensure adequate reproducibility of the results viscosity/elasticity measurements were carried out in triplicate using a CSL 100 Rheometer which required a comparatively large volume (5 mls) of spontaneously expectorated sputum. Because of this requirement paired samples could only be obtained from approximately 50% of the patients. There was no change in viscosity/elasticity (n=13), solid or DNA (n=15) content when comparing samples at the beginning and end of IV Ab. In contrast, 24 hr sputum weight was significantly (p<0.05) lower at the end of the Ab treatment (visit 1: 57.74\u00b114.58 g, visit 2: 49.41\u00b124.01 g, n=16). There was a strong and significant correlation between solid content and viscosity/elasticity (r=0.8, p<0.0001) and a modest correlation between 24 hr sputum weight and % predicted FEV1 (r=-0.42, p<0.05) and 24 hr sputum weight and patient scored symptom severity (r=0.48, p<0.001). Surprisingly, sputum DNA content did not correlate with viscosity/elasticity, despite being generally thought of as a contributor to viscosity, which may in part be related to the assay not being able to discriminate between free and cell-enclosed genomic DNA.In summary, after a course of IV antibiotics which lead to significant subjective and objective (FEV1) improvement the overall quantity of expectorated sputum was significantly reduced but, based on analysis available to date, none of the other parameters (viscosity, elasticity, solid and DNA content) changed significantly. Considering the difficulties we encountered in collecting sufficient sputum during this period of an exacerbation, sputum viscosity/elasticity measurements may not be feasible parameters to measure in a gene therapy trial to which stable patients re likely to be recruited. This study was funded by the CF Trust. Chronic neutrophilic inflammation is a feature of cystic fibrotic (CF)related inflammation and serves as a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality associated with the condition. Recently, our group has described a novel collagen-derived neutrophil chemoattractant, proline-glycine-proline (PGP), in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. The purpose of this study was to explore both the presence of this peptide in sputum from CF patients and the determination of a proteolytic system involved in PGP generation. We show that lower airway secretions from CF subjects have 30-fold increase in PGP levels compared to normal controls and that CF sputum (p<0.05) is able to generate PGP from intact type I and II collagen 100-fold above that seen from normal control sputum ex vivo (p<0.01). We further demonstrate that production of PGP is dependent on two specific matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), MMP-8 and MMP-9. Finally, we show that the generation of PGP can be significantly inhibited (80-90% inhibition) by the use of either MMP-8 or MMP-9 specific inhibitors (p<0.01 versus no inhibitor); a nonspecific MMP inhibitor (doxycycline) also demonstrates significant attenuation of PGP production. The determination of the requirements of these proteases in PGP generation allows for the identification of logical targets for disease-modifying therapeutics in CF. 1 1. CFRC, UAB, Birmingham, AL, USA; 2. CFRC, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by chronic neutrophilic inflammation. The discrete collagen breakdown product prolineglycine-proline (PGP) is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant thought to be generated by a specific proteolytic cascade present during CF pulmonary exacerbation (Nat Med 12(3):317, 2006) . High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a potent inflammatory mediator found in sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. The role of PGP and HMGB1 as PMN attractants in CF is unknown. In this study we utilized specimens derived both from humans and Scnn1b-transgenic mice (\u03b2ENaC mice) in which overexpression of the \u03b2ENaC subunit in the airways leads to sodium hyperabsorption and airway surface liquid depletion, mimicking the CF muco-obstructive phenotype. PGP was quantified using tandem MS. Neutrophil chemotaxis was measured in vitro following preincuabtion of sputum or BALF with anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody. Murine BALF was assayed for HMGB1 by Western blot and ELISA. Human sputum was similarly evaluated after normalizing for total protein concentration. In vivo HMGB1 activity was measured after intratracheal instillation in wt mice. \u03b2ENaC mice had 60% higher cell counts and a greater percentage of PMNs (37.3% vs. 0.6%) in BAL samples than wild-type (WT) littermates (p<0.005, n=15/genotype). PGP was elevated in BALF of Scnn1b animals (48.0 vs. below limits of detection in wt controls, p<0.001, n=11), increased in serum from CF subjects (834 vs. 340 pg/mL normal controls, p<0.005, n=5), and detected at high levels in CF sputum (54,700 pg/mL). BALF screened for HMGB1 by Western blot revealed elevated levels in \u03b2ENaC mice (p<0.05 by densitometry, n=10/genotype); ELISA confirmed 52% greater HMGB1 concentration (61.8 vs. 40.6 ng/mL, p<0.02). HMGB1 was also detected by Western blot in human CF sputum (19 of 23) and at higher levels than secretions from normal subjects (p<0.05 by densitometry; n=23 CF, 4 control). Purified HMGB1 induced dose-dependent PMN chemotaxis in vitro (peak 50-250 ng/mL, p<0.05, n=5) and CF sputum caused potent chemotaxis (7-fold over control, p<0.005, n=12) that was inhibited by preincubation with HMGB1 antibody (p<0.005). BALF from \u03b2ENaC mice (but not wt controls) was also chemotactic (2-fold greater than media control, p<0.01, n=5) and inhibited by anti-HMGB1 antibody (p<0.05). Exogenous HMGB1 (25 ng) administered intratracheally to LPS resistant mice (C3HeJ, Toll-4 receptor mutant) and BALB/c mice caused PMN influx in BALF at 24 hours (C3HeJ: 9.0 x 10 5 PMNs after HMGB1 vs. 2.0 x 10 5 after vehicle, P<0.02; BALB/c: 3.5 x 10 5 vs. 0.8 x 10 5 , P<0.01), and generation of PGP (189.7 vs. 80.7 pg/mL in C3HeJ, P<0.05, n=3) . In summary, PGP and HMGB1 are elevated in BALF of \u03b2ENaC mice that present with CF-like lung pathology; in CF airway secretions, HMGB1 is present in vivo at concentrations that induce neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and PGP production in vivo, and is inhibited by blocking antibody. The role of PGP and HMGB1 in CF deserve further evaluation as they may be potential therapeutic targets of dysregulated inflammation.",

            "text": "Introduction: Mucociliary clearance and antimicrobial peptide activity may be affected by airway surface liquid (ASL) pH, which is regulated by epithelial ion transport. ASL pH is abnormal in disease states in which IL-17A is elevated, including cystic fibrosis (CF), and the IL-17A receptor is expressed at the basolateral surface of bronchial epithelium. Therefore, we investigated the effects of IL-17A on vectorial ion transport in well-differentiated HBE cells. Methods: HBE cells were grown with an apical air interface and incubated with IL-17A at 0 or 50 ng/ml in the basolateral medium for 48 hours prior to being studied with standard short-circuit current (Isc) techniques. Results: IL-17A treated cells had a minimal increase in resting and amiloride-sensitive Isc compared to control cells, and had a dosedependent, statistically significant increase in forskolin-stimulated Isc. At a dose of 50 ng/ml, IL-17A doubled forskolin-stimulated Isc (10.5 \u00b1 1.72 \u00b5A/cm2 for control vs. 20.3 \u00b5A/cm2 for IL-17A). The increased Isc was not bumetanide-sensitive, but was sensitive to acetazolamide and DNDS, and was not present in HCO 3 --free solutions, suggesting it was due to HCO 3 secretion. To investigate whether this HCO 3 secretion was Cl --dependent, we studied HBE cells in Cl --free solutions, and there was no difference between untreated and IL-17A treated HBE cells. To test the hypothesis that IL-17A promoted Cl -/HCO 3 exchange, we performed experiments in HBE cells mounted in Cl --free solutions, and after addition of amiloride and forskolin, 30 mM NaCl was added to the mucosal bath and 30 mM NaGluconate was added to the serosal bath. Under these conditions, one would predict a decrease in Isc due to mucosal to serosal Clmovement down its electrochemical gradient. In untreated HBE cells, we saw a decrease in Isc followed by a recovery. In IL-17A treated cells there was a sustained increase in Isc, suggesting that movement of Cldown its electrochemical gradient resulted in exchange of Clfor an anion at the apical membrane. In the absence of HCO 3 -, both untreated and IL-17A treated cells responded to Claddition to the mucosal bath with decreases in Isc. To assess the CFTR dependence of the IL-17A-induced Isc, we stimulated primary CF HBE cells treated with IL-17A. In CF cells, there was a minimal increase in amiloride-sensitive Isc (30.6 \u00b1 3.35 \u00b5A/cm2 for control vs. 37 \u00b1 8.24 \u00b5A/cm2 for IL-17A ) and in forskolin-stimulated Isc (1.2 \u00b1 0.56 \u00b5A/cm2 for control vs. 3.4 \u00b1 1.16 \u00b5A/cm2 for IL-17A ). Conclusion: The proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A induces Cl -/HCO 3 exchange in HBE cells. Notably, the observed Cl -/HCO 3 exchange appears to be CFTR-independent. However, CFTR activation is required for maximum Cl -/HCO 3 exchange as demonstrated by the smaller Isc generated in CF cells. These data suggest that the cytokine milieu of the airway epithelium can alter ion transport and potentially ASL physiology. Furthermore, they suggest that CFTR may interact with or regulate novel proteins in the presence of inflammation.",

            "text": "Supported by CFF and NIH Periciliary fluid balance is maintained by the coordination of sodium and chloride (Cl-) channels in the apical membranes of the respiratory epithelia. In the absence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), Cl-secretion is diminished and sodium reabsorption becomes exaggerated. Activation of non-CFTR-dependent Cl-channels can provide an alternate pathway for Cl-secretion in the airways and gastrointestinal tract. The pH and voltage-dependent type-2 Cl-channel (ClC-2) is expressed in airway epithelial cell luminal membranes. We hypothesize that topically applied ClC-2 agonists may restore Cl-secretion in cystic fibrosis (CF) murine airways. Using in vivo nasal potential difference measurements, we quantified ClC-2-mediated Cl-transport in both CF and wild-type mice during nasal perfusion with lubiprostone (a prostone compound and specific ClC-2 agonist; Sucampo, Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bethesda MD) or vehicle control. Wild-type (C57Bl6, n = 9) and CF knock-out (CFKO; n=10(JAX stock# 002364)(Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) mice were sedated and intubated to protect the lower airways from aspiration of perfusate. Nasal and subcutaneous bridges were connected to fluid-filled silver chloride electrodes. Baseline (in Ringer's), amiloride-inhibited, low Cl-(Cl-free, gluconate-substituted Ringer's with amiloride), and low Cl-plus lubiprostone (with increasing concentrations of lubiprostone or vehicle) mice were perfused and potential differences were measured with a high impedance voltmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota FL) and continuously recorded. A clear dose-response relationship was detected in both wild-type and CF mice. At 20 \u00b5M lubiprostone, wild-type mice showed hyperpolarization of -7.8 \u00b1 3.4 mV and CF mice responded with -4.7 \u00b1 1.5 mV hyperpolarization. A paired t-test of low Cl-perfusion and lubiprostone perfusions revealed significant (P<0.001) differences in both genotypes. Five ClC-2 CFKO mice were similarly tested and showed no response to lubiprostone (+1.1 \u00b1 1/5 mV). CFTR inhibitor-172(50 \u00b5mol) (Calbiochem, San Diego CA) added to the low Cl-perfusion in 6 additional wild-type mice eliminated the low Cl-response but did not abolish the lubiprostone response, confirming that ClC-2 is present and independent of CFTR regulation. We conclude that direct application of a ClC-2 agonist in the CF murine upper airways restores near normal levels of Cl-secretion. CFTR is an apical membrane chloride channel whose activity is required to maintain airway surface liquid (ASL) volume and efficient mucociliary clearance. CFTR is activated by cAMP dependent stimulation of protein kinase A. However, studies have suggested that the actin cytoskeleton may also be required for regulation of CFTR, by acting as a structural element in second messenger compartmentalization (1) . To determine whether an intact cytoskeleton is required for ASL volume homeostasis, adenosine (ADO), ATP, or isoproterenol (Iso) (all at 200 \u00b5M) were added apically to Human Bronchial Epithelial Cultures (HBEC's) before or after the cytoskeleton had been disrupted by cytochalasin D exposure (5\u00b5M for 1h). In control cultures ADO, ATP and Iso all resulted in a significant increase in ASL height (\u2206ASL) within 10 min (\u2206ASL; ADO, 6.2\u00b11.2\u00b5m; ATP, 7.2\u00b12.3\u00b5m; Iso, 8.3\u00b11.3\u00b5m). However, in cytochalasin D exposed cultures ADO was without effect while ATP and Iso were still able to evoke an increase in height (\u2206ASL; ADO, -0.7\u00b11.2\u00b5m; ATP, 7.4\u00b13.1\u00b5m; Iso, 10.2\u00b13.1\u00b5m). However, we showed that A2B receptor function was not compromised by cytoskeleton disruption as cAMP levels were seen to increase both after addition of adenosine and adenosine in the presence of cytochalasin D. Thus, the effect of cytochalasin D on ASL height appeared specific for adenosine-mediated Cl-secretion. To further test the effect of cytochalasin D on the relationship between adenosine and CFTR, we designed a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of cfp-CFTR (labeled at the n-terminus) and yfp-A2B receptor (labeled at the c-terminus). Addition of adenosine (100\u00b5M) increased FRET by 2.3 times (% efficiency; control, 15.2\u00b12.3%, ADO, 35.3\u00b13.5%) compared to the vehicle control (n=13). Cytochalasin D exposure (5 \u00b5M for 1 h) completely inhibited the increase in FRET that was observed after adenosine addition (p<0.01). In contrast, cytochalasin D had no effect on FRET between CFTR and the \u03b22adrenoceptor. To determine whether cytochalasin D treatment (5 \u00b5M for 1 h) had any direct effect on CFTR protein levels and localization we used a cell line stably expressed with an exotope-tagged CFTR (HB8 cells) (2) . CFTR protein levels were found to be significantly reduced as compared to nontreated controls by both Western blot analysis and chemiluminescence detection (n=3). Cells were also stained with an antibody against the external CFTR exotope and imaged by confocal microscopy and a significant decrease in staining at the plasma membrane was observed after cytochalasin D treatment (n=3). We conclude that cytochalasin D exposure decreases CFTR protein levels and specifically inhibits adenosine-mediated regulation of CFTR activity in the airways, leading to disruption of ASL homeostasis and inhibition of mucociliary clearance. Numerous studies have reported evidence that CFTR is expressed in the apical membrane of serous cells in the airway submucosal glands. Thus, it has been reasoned that (1) CFTR plays some role in normal anion and fluid secretion by airway glands and (2) loss of this channel's function in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways plays some role in the etiology of CF lung disease. A recent study by Joo et al. (JBC 277:50710-50715, 2002) indicates that CF airway glands lose the ability to secrete fluid when treated with forskolin or VIP but maintain the ability to secrete when treated with muscarinic agonists. This result suggests that VIP and muscarinic agonists mediate secretion by CFTR-dependent and CFTR-independent pathways, respectively. The present study was undertaken to explore the dynamics of fluid secretion by individual submucosal glands to determine if further differences in their responses to these two agonists could be distinguished. Pig tracheas were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. After removal of the cartilage, tissues were mounted in a warm (37\u00b0C) observation chamber that permitted exposure of the submucosa to Krebs solution. The mucosal surfaces of the airways were dried with a stream of warm dry air and then layered with mineral oil. Liquid secreted from the gland duct openings formed spherical aqueous droplets within the oil layer, and their volumes were estimated from spatial dimensions taken from sequential digital images. Liquid secretion rates were estimated for individual glands present within a 28.9 mm 2 region of interest. Rates were determined for two experimental protocols. For one group of tissues, secretion rates were determined for a control period, followed by a period of exposure to 1 \u00b5M VIP, and then a period of exposure to both VIP and 10 \u00b5M acetylcholine (ACh). In the second group, the order of VIP and ACh treatment was reversed. These agonist concentrations were expected to produce near maximum rates of secretion. When the agonists were applied first, secretion rates were significantly (P<0.05) increased from the control period by both ACh (2.01\u00b10.44 nL/min to 4.52\u00b10.38 nL/min) and VIP (2.26\u00b10.63 nL/min to 4.64\u00b10.78 nL/min). The secretion rates for individual glands were highly variable with both agonists (ACh: 0.11-19.20 nL/min; VIP: 0.03-32.21 nL/min). When ACh application followed VIP treatment, the mean secretion rate was significantly increased further to 6.13\u00b10.87 nL/min; however, when VIP application followed ACh treatment, the secretion rate was only marginally and insignificantly increased to 4.97\u00b10.48 nL/min. We conclude that both ACh and VIP are efficacious secretagogues for porcine airway glands and that the rate of secretion from individual glands to either agonist is very heterogenous. Because VIP has no effect following stimulation by ACh, we speculate that ACh induces secretion by activating all transporters relevant to VIP-induced secretion including CFTR. However, ACh must also activate channels and/or transporters not induced by VIP since its effects are additive to VIP. This most likely includes activation of a non-CFTR anion channel. ( Serous cells are thought to serve as the principal anion and fluidsecreting cells of airway submucosal glands. Mucous cells primarily secrete gel-forming mucins. These respective physiological roles for these two cell types imply that the mucous cells, which secrete the thick mucus gel, should lie downstream of the serous cells so that their watery secretions can flush the mucins out of the ducts and onto the airway surface. Early studies indicated that such arrangements existed within glands but reports of cell distributions have been descriptive rather than quantitative. Because of resurgent interest in serous cell function, we revisited this issue to formally document the distribution of these cell types within the secretory tubules of the submucosal glands as well as at the surfaces of the glands, where serous cells are most accessible for study. A piece of porcine lung, containing a 5mm diameter bronchus, was treated with formalin fixative, and 250 consecutive 5\u00b5m sections were taken. The apices of virtually all gland epithelial cells, except the cells lining the collecting and ciliated ducts, stain positive for PAS indicating that these cells are either serous or mucous cells. However, PAS staining does not allow distinctions to be made between these two cell types. Consequently, all slide sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. With these stains, mucous cells were identified as cells containing lucent granules in their apices whereas serous cells were considered to be cells where the apical cytoplasm stained a uniform dark reddish color. First, the distribution of serous and mucous cells in the secretory tubules were determined. The acini of individual tubules were located in the slide sections, and cells were identified and counted in consecutive sections that approached the collecting ducts until the tubules were no longer distinguishable as discrete tubes. Secretory tubules from 6 individual glands were studied. In the acini, serous cells accounted for 95.0\u00b13.2% of total cells whereas mucous cells accounted for 3.8\u00b12.2% of total cells (remaining cells were not distinguishable as either cell type). There was a significant (P<.05) negative correlation of serous cell numbers with distance from the acini so that at 35\u00b5m from the acinus serous cells accounted for only 73.4\u00b113.5% of total cells. There was a coincident significant positive correlation with mucous cell numbers so that at 35\u00b5m from the acini mucous cells accounted for 20.1\u00b110.5% of total cells. Next, we examined the cell distribution at the adventitial and mucosal surfaces and at the lateral margins of the glands. Serous cells accounted for 82.7%, 85.4%, and 96.9% of the total cells at these respective locales. Mucous cells represented 15.7%, 10.1%, and 2.4% of total cells in these same respective regions. We conclude that serous cells are by far the dominant cell type in secretory tubules of porcine submucosal glands. Mucous cells are rare in acini but increase in frequency with distance from the acini. The outer surfaces of the glands are dominated by serous cells as well. At the lateral margin of the glands, serous cells outnumber mucous cells by 20-to-1. (Supported by NIH HL63302) . Many of the membrane transporters that participate in this process have been identified; however, the identity of the class of Kchannels that maintains resting membrane potential and/or cell membrane polarization during the secretion process remains poorly characterized. Liquid secretion by porcine submucosal glands is insensitive to numerous K + channel blockers including Ba 2+ , tetraethylammonium, apamin, charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, clotrimazole, penitrem A, 4-aminopyridine, and quinidine. Recently, a new class of K + channels, the \"tandem-pore\" or K 2P channels, have been described. Potassium channels of this class are insensitive to many traditional K + channel inhibitors but are blocked by local anesthetics, such as lidocaine and bupivacaine. Additionally, many K 2P channels are sensitive to changes in extracellular pH. In the present study, we considered whether K 2P channels might participate in the liquid secretion response to acetylcholine (ACh). Intrapulmonary bronchi, excised intact from the lungs of pigs, were cleared of accessible luminal liquid, cannulated, and treated with 10 \u00b5M ACh to induce secretion. Paired airways were pretreated for 1 h with 3 mM bupivacaine. Bupivacaine blocked 90.4\u00b11.8% of the liquid secretion response to ACh. The IC 50 for the bupivacaine inhibition was approximately 220 \u00b5M. The inhibitory effect of bupivacaine was not due to nonspecific toxicity since tissues exposed to bupivacaine for 1 h and then washed with fresh inhibitor-free buffer recovered to 80% the control AChinduced secretory rate. The bupivacaine effect was not due to inhibition of voltage-gated Na + channels in intrinsic neurons since 1 \u00b5M tetrodotoxin did not inhibit ACh-induced secretion. No significant effect was seen in the secretion rate when the extracellular solution pH was lowered from 7.43\u00b10.01 (normal HCO 3 --buffered Krebs gassed with 5% CO 2 ) to 6.60\u00b10.01 by gassing with 40% CO 2 gas (balance O 2 ). While we recognize the relative nonspecificity of this agent, the inhibitory effects of bupivacaine on liquid secretion by porcine bronchi are consistent with K 2P channel participation in this secretory response. The failure to demonstrate inhibition with acidification of extracellular solution could signify a K 2P channel subtype that is insensitive to low extracellular pH. ( 4 1.

            "text": "Cotton, C. Pediatrics, Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes CFTR, a cAMP-activated apical membrane anion channel. Loss of CFTR-mediated anion conductance is a primary defect in CF but secondary defects such a sodium hyperabsorption are also implicated in CF pathophysiology. It is generally accepted that mucociliary clearance is compromised in CF airways due to reduced fluid secretion and/or increased fluid absorption. The recent generation of a transgenic mouse model with ENaC overexpression that exhibits CF-like lung disease highlights the importance of sodium hyperabsorption. Therapies designed to reduce mucus production and viscosity, increase lumenal water content, stimulate fluid secretion, and inhibit fluid absorption are under development for treatment of CF airways. Although controversial, several recent studies have demonstrated that SERCA pump inhibitors partially correct the trafficking defect associated with delta F508 mutant CFTR. The goal of this work is to determine if SERCA pump inhibitors affect ENaC-mediated sodium absorption. A renal collecting duct epithelial cell line and primary cultures of well-differentiated human tracheal epithelial cells (air/liquid interface culture) were used for these studies. Amiloride-sensitive short circuit current was determined as a measure of ENaC-mediated sodium absorption. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate expression levels for each of the 3 subunits of ENaC (alpha, beta, and gamma). Epithelial monolayers were treated for 18-24hours with SERCA pump inhibitors (thapsigargin, 100-500 nM; DBHQ,10-50 uM; and curcumin, 10-50 uM). Treatment with SERCA pump inhibitors decreased amiloride-sensitive short circuit current by 50-80%. In contrast, cAMPstimulated short circuit current was not reduced by treatment with SERCA pump inhibitors. The steady-state levels of alpha, beta, and gamma ENaC were reduced by 60-80% in renal epithelial monolayers treated with thapsigargin whereas beta and gamma ENaC were reduced by 80-90% with no significant change in alpha ENaC in airway epithelial cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that sustained depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and/or elevation of intracellular calcium by inhibition of SERCA pump activity reduces ENaC mRNA expression and ENaC-mediated sodium absorption. Thus, inhibition of SERCA pump activity in airway epithelial cells of CF patients that carry the delta F508 mutation may provide dual benefit by promoting delivery of mutant CFTR to the membrane 1 1.

Department of Medicine, Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Increased cytosolic calcium ([Ca 2+ ] i ) initiated by the release of stored Ca 2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key signal to elicit a wide range of essential cellular responses, including secretory functions of the respiratory epithelium that are modified in CF. SERCA pumps are responsible for (re)filling the ER Ca 2+ stores, and SERCA blockers such as thapsigargin are very potent and commonly used pharmacological triggers of Ca 2+ -signals. Modulation of the activity of SERCAs can profoundly affect Ca 2+ homeostasis. Although defective calcium homeostasis is a characteristic of several pulmonary diseases including CF, the role of SERCA is unknown. Lung tissue samples (bronchus and distal lungs) from normal (n=2) and CF subjects (n=2) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. SERCA2 expression was decreased in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia of CF. Non-CF and CF bronchial epithelial cell line pairs including Calu-3 and JME/CF15, C-38 and IB3-1, 16HBE14o-(16HBE), CFBE41o-(CF41o-) and CFBE45o-(CF45o-) were also probed. Given certain limitations of such cells, several consistent findings still emerged. A 65% and 75% decrease in SERCA2 expression was observed in CF41o-and CF45ocells as compared to 16HBE cells. Immunocytochemical studies in these cells confirmed that the SERCA2 was localized in the ER and that the decreased SERCA expression was not associated with decreased ER content. Reduced SERCA2 expression and activity (3.51\u00b10.27 vs 1.76\u00b10.23 and 2.59\u00b10.29 pmol/min/mg protein in 16 HBE vs. CF41o-and CF45ocells respectively) was observed in the purified ER membranes from CF cell lines. Northern blot analysis revealed a parallel reduced mRNA expression as well. Decreased SERCA2 was accompanied by increase in the low affinity isoform SERCA3 (0.95\u00b10.20 vs. 1.39\u00b10.10 and 1.68\u00b10.32 arbitrary SERCA2 intensity/b-actin in respectively) . We have also evaluated a limited number of primary airway epithelial cells isolated from lung samples of normal and CF subjects for SERCA2 expression. SERCA2 expression in polarized tracheobronchial epithelial cell lysates from CF subjects was decreased by about 60% as compared to those from normal subjects (1.86\u00b10.56 vs. 5.68\u00b11.24 arbitrary SERCA2 intensity/b-actin units in CF and normal respectively, n=3). Expression of SERCA2 could also be suppressed by inhibiting CFTR with CFTR inh 172 in normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( Various studies indicate that the airway surface fluid possess an antibacterial system based on the combined action of lactoperoxidase, H 2 O 2 , and SCN -(thiocyanate). The enzyme lactoperoxidase (secreted by submucosal glands) utilizes H 2 O 2 and SCNto generate OSCN -(hypothiocyanite) a molecule with antimicrobial activity. H 2 O 2 is produced by dual oxidases expressed on the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells whereas SCNis transported across the epithelium through anion transporters and channels. In particular, SCNtransport seems to occur through CFTR and other Ca 2+dependent Clchannels. Therefore, reduced SCNtransport in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients may contribute to impaired antimicrobial activity.",

CF patients become infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which release flagellin into the airway surface liquid to activate toll-like receptor 5 and proinflammatory signaling. Flagellin has been shown to inhibit Na absorption by airway epithelia. We tested flagellin on Cl secretion and proinflammatory signaling (NF-\u03baB activation) by Calu3 cells, a CFTRexpressing, serous-like airway gland cell line. Calu3 cells were grown on filters and either mounted in Ussing chambers (clamped to zero mV) in the presence of a serosa-to-mucosa gradient of [Cl] for measurements of transepithelial Cl secretion (I Cl ) or treated with an adenovirus expressing NF-\u03baB-controlled luciferase to assay NF-\u03baB activation. Flagellin (10 -7 g/ml) on either the apical or basolateral surface of cells increased apparent anion secretion that began in 3-10 mins and increased over 20-30 mins by 20-50 \u00b5A/cm 2 . This I Cl was blocked by glibenclamide and GlyH101, indicating that it resulted at least in part from activation of CFTR. Flagellin also stimulated fluid secretion by intact human tracheal glands. Flagellin activated NF-\u03baB (luciferase assays) in both Calu-3 cells and in the CF cell line CF15, while I Cl was stimulated in Calu3 but not in CF15 cells. Flagellin-stimulated I Cl in Calu-3 cells was blocked 50% by SB202190 (a p38 MAPK blocker) and by a similar amount by wortmannin (PI3 kinase blocker). Interleukin 1\u03b2 and the TLR2-agonist Pam3Cys also activated I Cl . The effect of flagellin was not due to increases in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] (Ca i ) because flagellin did not alter Ca i . In contrast to the slow effects of flagellin, Pam3Cys and IL1\u03b2, ATP rapidly increased I Cl (within secs, up to 80 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) followed by slower decrease to steady I Cl = 20-40 \u00b5A/cm 2 that had a similar time signature as the increases in Ca i . Forskolin (to increase cytosolic [cyclic AMP]) increased I Cl within 2 mins to a steady value = 50-80 \u00b5A/cm 2 . Flagellin had small or no effects on I Cl following maximal stimulation with either ATP or forskolin. ATP and forskolin on their own had no effect on NF-\u03baB. Flagellin increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and of AKT (down-stream kinase phosphorylated by PI3K) with a time course similar to the increase in I Cl . Flagellin-activated NF-\u03baB was reduced by roughly 50% by either wortmannin or SB202190. These results indicated that TLR agonists and inflammatory cytokines stimulate both NF-\u03baB and proinflammatory processes and also CFTR-dependent Cl and fluid secretion by airway gland cells. These responses are mediated in part by activation of both p38 MAPK and PI3 kinase. Flagellin-TLR5-activated increases in CFTR-mediated Cl secretion and reduction in ENaC-mediated Na absorption will increase fluid secretion into the airways, which may facilitate bacterial removal by the mucociliary escalator and thereby reduce the proinflammatory stimulus. In CF it is expected that bacteria will activate TLR signaling to trigger innate immune responses, but Cl and water secretion and the resulting \"bacterial flush,\" will be missing, leading to sustained inflammation.

The degree of inhibition was a saturable function of the imposed hypertonicity with an IC50 of 379 (Mannitol) and 398 (NaCl) mOsmol/kg H2O and a maximal inhibition of 97%. The inclusion of amiloride (10-100 \u00b5M) did not affect the HC-induced reduction in INa. The inhibition in INa by HC was rapid in onset and accompanied by a fall in the transepithelial resistance and the total transepithelial capacitance as expected for cell shrinkage. The inhibition in INa was only partially reversible (~20%) after returning to isotonic solutions for 45 min. Exposure of the airway surface to hypertonicity (680 mOsmol/kg H2O) inhibited INa by 72-79% at 30 min of exposure. As osmotically-driven water moved from the serosal to the mucosal side, the apical volume increased concomitant with a decrease in its osmolality and a recovery of INa. The osmolality declined exponentially and reached the isosmotic value after ~4 hrs. The recovery of INa lagged behind the recovery of apical osmolality by 80, 20 and 10% at 0.5, 2 and 3 hrs of incubation, respectively. After 4 hrs of airway HC exposure, the osmolality and INa recovered completely. Our results demonstrate that HC causes a rapid, dramatic and prolonged decrease in Na+ absorption and that continuous presence of amiloride had no effect on the inhibition of INa or the recovery of apical osmolality. HC also causes the epithelium to shrink. No appreciable differences were observed between CF and non-CF HBE cells.",

However, the mechanisms involved in ENaC/CFTR regulation are poorly understood. Using human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) under thick film conditions, i.e. in the Ussing chamber with the ASL washed away, adenosine (ADO) directly stimulates Cl-secretion. However, in a Cl-free environment, ADO has no effect on the amiloride-sensitive current, which is mediated by ENaC.

Mean delta amiloride (100\u00b5M) was -5.32 and -5.38 \u00b5A/cm 2 respectively (ns; n=3 each).",

We and others have recently reported that a protease / anti-protease balance regulates ENaC in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) and provides a mechanism for auto-regulation of ASL volume. In CF, this balance is disturbed, leading to constitutive proteolytic activation of ENaC and the pathological Na + hyper-absorption characteristic of the disease. To determine if channel activating protease expression is regulated by changes in ASL volume and is altered in CF, we examined prostasin expression in control and CF HBE under basal and ASL volume expansion conditions using Western blotting.",

In cystic fibrosis (CF), H2O epithelial permeability is reduced in airways. The demand of noninvasively imaging techniques with high spatial resolution potential is rising because such imaging tools would expedite anatomical and functional phenotyping in the genetically altered mice. Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a noninvasive, inherently three-dimensional (3D) imaging technique capable of visualizing anatomical structures in the mouse and allows for interpretation of complex spatial relationships between substructures and H2O. In this study, we explore different MR contrast parameters and signal-to-noise ratios at a 30 \u00b5m pixel size to characterize microstructure and H2O mobility in ex vivo trachea of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-deficient (CFTR knockout, Cftr tm1UNC ) mice and their aged-matched WT littermates. This study is performed using a Bruker MRM system at 11.7 tesla. We demonstrate for the first time the ability of 3D-MRM to map the H2O content and mobility in trachea epithelium. From the 3D-MRM videoimages, differential H2O content was visualized in different levels of trachea in WT and CF mice. T2 MRM images depicting the H2O rotational mobility which is related to environmental viscosity of trachea epithelium will be also shown. Finally, this 3D-MRM imaging method is a valuable method for measuring H2O content and permeability in airways and can serve for assessing the effects of drugs on H2O mobility in CF airways.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disorder caused by mutations in a single gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein resulting in progressive lung oxidative damage. In this study, we evaluated the role of CFTR in the control of ubiquitin-proteasome activity (UPS system) and the NF-\u03baB / I\u03baB-\u03b1signaling after lung oxidative stress. We exposed CFTR deficient (cftr-/-) and wild type mice for 64 h to hyperoxia-mediated oxidative stress. CFTR deficient mice exhibited significantly higher lung proteasomal activity than CFTR+/+ animals after oxidative stress. This was accompagnied by a strong reduction of lung caspase-3 activity and an absence of degradation of NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1. In vitro, human CFTR-deficient lung cells also exhibited higher proteasomal activity and a lack of increased NF-\u03baBdependent transcriptional activity compared to CFTR-sufficient lung cells after oxidative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasomal activity by MG132 in CFTR-deficient lung cells restored the NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB-\u03b1 signaling to that of CFTR-sufficient lung cells. Inhibition of caspase-3 by Z-DQMD in CFTR-sufficient lung cells mimicked the response profile of increased proteasomal degradation and lowered NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity of CFTR-deficient lung cells when exposed to oxidative stress. All together, these results suggest that CFTR is a crucial molecule in regulating proteasomal degradation and NF-\u03baB activity in lung epithelium under oxidative stress. Staphylococcus aureus, one of the major pathogen involved in airway infections, releases in the airway lumen virulence factors that may impair the airway epithelial functionality. To date, the effect of S. aureus virulence factors on the loss of electrolyte homeostasis of the airway epithelium has not been investigated. We have previously shown that the combination of a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta 2 agonist attenuated the airway epithelial cell inflammatory response induced by S. aureus virulence factors. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of S. aureus virulence factors on the airway epithelial tightness and on the chloride efflux of airway epithelial cells incubated or not with Salmeterol hydroxynaphthoate 2\u00d710 -7 M and Fluticasone propionate 1\u00d710 -8 M (SM/FP). The airway epithelial tightness was assessed by immunocytochemistry, western blotting and transepithelial resistance measurement. The chloride efflux was evaluated by dynamic imaging using the 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ) fluorescent probe. S. aureus (strain 8325-4) virulence factors were obtained by growing bacteria at 5\u00d710 8 CFU/ml for 18h at 37\u00b0C. The bacteria supernatant containing S. aureus soluble virulence factors was then centrifuged, filtered and diluted at 2% in cell culture medium (a concentration that did not alter cell viability). Human airway epithelial cells (MM39) were incubated with 2% S. aureus virulence factors for 1h and then co-incubated or not with SM/FP for 4h. We observed that the incubation with 2% S. aureus virulence factors alone did not significantly alter the epithelial integrity assessed by the expression of tight junction proteins and transepithelial resistance measurement. However, when the cells were incubated with SM/FP alone or with 2% S. aureus virulence factors plus SM/FP, the expression of tight junction proteins was significantly increased (p<0.05) as compared to cells incubated with S. aureus virulence factors. Interestingly, the chloride efflux in airway epithelial cells was significantly decreased in a time-dependent way by S. aureus virulence factors (3 fold decrease after a 4h incubation). The co-incubation of airway epithelial cells with S. aureus virulence factors and SM/FP prevented the S. aureus virulence factorsdependent chloride efflux decrease. Our results demonstrate that bacterial virulence factors induce the loss of the electrolyte homeostasis and suggest that the treatment by the combination of a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta 2 agonist may preserve the airway epithelial functionality.",

One explanation has been suggested, namely that hypertonic solutions open tight junctions, which may lead to increased water transport followed by an increased airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. Furthermore, the role in CFTR-mediated HCO3-conductance in regulating ASL pH has led us to investigate if pH changes may have an effect on the tightness of tight junctions.",

            "text": "The effect of osmolarity was investigated on the 16HBE14o-cell line by the addition of NaCl, NaBr, LiCl, mannitol or xylitol (295-700 mOsm). The effect of pH was investigated on the 16HBE14o-, Calu-3 and T84 cell lines as well as the cystic fibrosis cell line CFBE41o-. Transepithelial resistance was measured as indicator of the tightness of the cultures. Cell-cell contacts and morphology were investigated by immuno-fluorescence and by transmission electron microscopy, with lanthanum nitrate added to the luminal side of the epithelium to investigate tight junction permeability. The electrolyte solutions caused a significant decrease in transepithelial resistance from 450 mOsm on, when the hyperosmolar exposure was gradually increased from 295 to 700 mOsm, whereas the non-electrolyte solutions caused a decrease in transepithelial resistance from 700 mOsm on. Immunofluorescence micrographs showed weaker staining for the proteins ZO-1, claudin-4 in treated samples compared to the control. The ultrastructure revealed an increased number of open tight junctions as well as a disturbed morphology with increasing osmolarity, and with electrolyte solutions opening a larger proportion of tight junctions than non-electrolyte solutions. It was noted that during the exposure of the cultured cells to the hyperosmolar solutions, the pH of the medium increased from 7.4 to 8.0. 16HBE14o-cells exposed to both a rise in pH and hyperosmotic stress showed an overall lower TEER and a significantly reduced ability to recover from stress compared to cultures at a pH hold constant at 7.4. Without exposure to hyperosmolar solutions, a rise in pH caused a significant decrease in transepithelial resistance in 16HBE14o-cells, Calu-3 and T84 cell lines but not in the CFBE14o-cell lines, where the reaction was significantly less and delayed. In conclusion, hyperosmolar solutions caused a reversible opening of the TJ in 16HBE14o-cell cultures with electrolytes having stronger effects than non-electrolytes, where one of the effects on MCC may be due to increased water transport across the leaky paracellular space. An increase in pH caused a significant decrease in TEER in the healthy cell lines compared to the CFBE41o-cell line. We speculated that an impaired alkalinisation of the apical fluid due to a defective CFTR also will cause the tight junctions to react different to other external stimuli, such as osmolarity, compared to healthy cells, which is also indicated by preliminary experiments on the effect of NaCl on TEER in CFBE41o-cultures. Extracellular nucleotides regulate surfactant secretion in alveoli and mucociliary clearance in airway epithelia, but the mechanism(s) of their release and their regulatory pathways remain incompletely understood. Previously, we showed that hypotonic swelling of A549 epithelial cells induces Ca 2+ -dependent secretion of several adenosine and uridine nucleotides, implicating regulated exocytosis. In this study, we examined sources of intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) elevation evoked by acute 50% hypotonic stress and the role of autocrine purinergic signaling in Ca 2+ -dependent ATP release. We found that ATP release does not directly involve Ca 2+ influx from extracellular spaces, but depends entirely on Ca 2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. The [Ca 2+ ] i response consisted of slowly-rising elevation representing mobilization from thapsigargin (TG)-insensitive stores and a superimposed rapid spike due to Ca 2+ release from TG-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. The latter could be abolished by hydrolysis of extracellular tri-and di-nucleotides with apyrase; blocking P2Y 2 /P2Y 6 receptors of A549 cells with suramin; blocking UDP receptors (P2Y 6 ) by PPADS; emptying TG-sensitive stores downstream with 1 \u00b5M TG or 10 mM caffeine in Ca 2+ -free extracellular solution; or blocking the Ca 2+ -release inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 ) receptor channel of the ER with 75 \u00b5M 2aminoethyl diphenylborinate. These results demonstrate that the rapid [Ca 2+ ] i spike results from the autocrine stimulation of IP 3 )/Ca 2+ -coupled P2Y 2 /P2Y 6 receptors, which accounts for ~70% of total Ca 2+ -dependent ATP release evoked by hypotonic shock. Our study reveals a novel paradigm in which ATP release is amplified by the synergistic autocrine/paracrine action of co-released uridine and adenosine nucleotides. We suggest that a similar mechanism of purinergic signal propagation operates in other cell types.",

In this study, we examined ATP secretion from human lung A549 epithelial cell monolayers mounted in a closed, flowthrough chamber (0.5 mm height) and found that passage of an air bubble over the monolayer caused transient (<1.5 min) but significant ATP release (600 to 2,000 pmoles/10 6 cells). Air bubble-induced ATP release was reduced by~70% from cells loaded with the intracellular Ca 2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, and was completely abolished in N-methylmalemide-treated (1 mM) cells, suggesting the involvement of Ca 2+ -dependent exocytosis. Fura-2 intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) imaging experiments revealed transient [Ca 2+ ] i elevation during the passage of an air bubble over the cell monolayer, but the [Ca 2+ ] i response did not involve non-specific Ca 2+ influx from the extracellular space, e.g. due to cell damage, since similar responses were observed in Ca 2+ -free extracellular solution. Ethidium bromide staining did not disclose any cell damage in these experiments. Confocal fluorescence microscopy study showed reversible cell deformation (flattening) of 10% to 40% in height in the monolayer part in contact with the air bubble and confirmed that cell integrity was entirely preserved. These experiments demonstrate that in close proximity to the air-liquid interface (i.e. between the air bubble and the wet cell surface), surface tension forces are transmitted directly on cells, causing their mechanical deformation, elevation of [Ca 2+ ] i and subsequent ATP release. We propose that a similar mechanism may operate in vivo in the airways, where surface tension forces acting directly on exposed epithelial cell surfaces may provide a fail-proof mechanism to protect proper airway surface liquid volume via mechanosensitive, Ca 2+ -dependent ATP release and purinergic modulation of fluid secretion. This mechanism may be defective in cystic fibrosis due to excessive mucus layer covering the airways.",

            "text": "Synchrotron phase contrast X-ray provides a new option for non-invasive imaging of intact mouse lung, at a resolution that permits examination of small conducting airways in mice. Combined with volume-reconstruction software these ultraCT images can provide a powerful option for understanding the structure-function relationships produced by airway disease. Ultra-CT 3-D studies are underway to compare lung airways at high resoltuion in normal and transgenic mice having altered airway pathophysiology. The epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, has a vital role in the function of the pulmonary epithelia and significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of the CF airway. Thus, strategies to repair mutant CFTR dysfunction must also consider the influence of such repair on ENaC functional expression. The \u2206F508 trafficking repair agent 4-Phenylbutyrate modulates the expression of the 70 kDa molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 in CF epithelial cells. We therefore assessed the role of these chaperones in the regulation of ENaC trafficking. In Xenopus oocytes, we previously observed that overexpression of Hsc70 inhibits murine ENaC (mENaC) functional and surface expression. In contrast, Hsp70 can either enhance or inhibit mENaC functional and surface expression depending on the extent of overexpression [Goldfarb et al. (2006), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 103:5817-22 ]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these differential effects of Hsc70 and Hsp70 on mENaC expression also occur in epithelial cells. MDCK cell lines with stable expression of \u03b1-HA, \u03b2-V5, \u03b3-Myc-mENaC and tetracyclineinducible expression of either Hsc70, ATPase-deficient Hsc70, Hsp70 or ATPase-deficient Hsp70 containing myc/His epitope-tags were selected. All epitopes were fused to the respective C-termini. These cells were grown as high-resistance (>500 \u2126/cm 2 ) monolayers on permeable supports. Doxycycline-induced overexpression of Hsc70 decreased amiloride-sensitive I sc and the whole cell content of \u03b1-HAand \u03b2-V5-mENaC. In contrast, lower amounts of tetracycline-induced Hsp70 overexpression increased amiloridesensitive I sc and whole cell \u03b1-HAand \u03b2-V5-mENaC expression; these effects were absent at higher levels of Hsp70 overexpression. These data are consistent with our previous data in Xenopus oocytes. Interestingly, the ATPase-deficient chaperones had the opposite effect on mENaC functional expression. Modest doxycycline-induced expression of ATPase-deficient Hsc70 increased amiloride-sensitive I sc in these cells, while modest overexpression of ATPase-deficient Hsp70 decreased amiloride-sensitive I sc . These effects may result from \"dominant negative\" interference with Hsc70 and Hsp70 function, respectively. These data are consistent with Hsc70 and Hsp70 having different effects on mENaC functional expression in epithelial cells, and that these effects are dependent upon the ATPase activity of the respective chaperones.",

            "text": "Supported by grants from NIDDK. We have studied survival, airway epithelia bioelectrics and lung pathology of mice over-expressing various combinations of the 3 epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) subunits (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, genes Scnn1a, Scnn1b and Scnn1g). We generated double-transgenic mice and crossed them with single-transgenic mice to obtain litters comprising all 8 possible genotypes. Survival analysis revealed that overexpression of \u03b2ENaC in combination with either \u03b1ENaC or \u03b3ENaC significantly reduced survival in comparison to wild-type (WT) littermates. Strikingly, at 3 days of age, all genotypes were represented according to the expected Mendelian proportion, except for the triple transgenic \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3ENaC, which was significantly under represented. In utero studies are ongoing to understand if over-expression of \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 affects the fetuses or the newborn pups during the first hours post-partum. Due to the high mortality of mice over-expressing \u03b2ENaC subunit combinations, we studied tracheas from pups at 3 days of age. As previously reported, mice overexpressing \u03b2, but not the \u03b1 or \u03b3 ENaC subunits, exhibit airways hyperabsorption of Na + and lung pathology (Mall et all 2004) . The \u03b2ENaC tracheas exhibited Na + absorption [as measured by the change in short circuit current (Isc) in response to amiloride in the Ussing chamber] that was ~5.4 fold greater (\u2206Isc 24.6\u00b13.9 \u00b5A\u00d7cm -2 , n=9, means\u00b1SEM) than WT (4.6\u00b10.8 \u00b5A\u00d7cm -2 , n=7). Over-expressing \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b1\u03b3 ENaC subunits resulted in rates of Na + absorption that did not differ significantly from those of \u03b2ENaC or \u03b3ENaC subunit alone, respectively. However over-expressing the \u03b2 and \u03b3 ENaC subunits together resulted in an amiloride sensitive Isc that was ~13.7 fold greater (\u2206Isc 63.1\u00b18.2 \u00b5A\u00d7cm -2 , n=9) than WT. We also studied the tracheal bioelectrics of the few 3 day-old \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3ENaC pups available. Tracheas from the \u03b1b\u03b3 pups exhibited Na + absorption that was ~16.7 fold greater (\u2206Isc 77\u00b18.2 \u00b5A\u00d7cm -2 , n=3) than WT. Due to the small sample size, we cannot determine if this response is significantly different from the response of the \u03b2\u03b3ENaC pups. Analysis of lung pathology in 3 day-old pups revealed that all the combinations that exhibited increased airway Na + absorption and decreased survival in comparison to WT littermates, e.g. \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b2\u03b3 and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3, also presented with alveolar space enlargement, maybe due to postobstructive air trapping, and airway epithelia necrotic degeneration associated with AB-PAS negative bronchial obstruction. From these data, it appears that the rate of airway Na + absorption negatively correlates with the survival of the pups. Thus, it is likely that the mucus and airway surface liquid is more dehydrated as a function of the rates of Na + absorption (a\u03b2\u03b3 > \u03b2\u03b3 > \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b2 > WT) which produces gradual failure to survive due to asphyxia secondary to airway obstruction.

Cystic Fibrosis Research Laboratory, , Stanford, CA, USA; 2. otorhinolaryngology, Yonsei university, Seoul, South Korea Submucosal glands, which produce most airway mucus, are mainly controlled by parasympathetic pathways that stimulate glands via airway intrinsic neurons distributed along the airway walls. The intrinsic neurons can be stimulated via axon reflexes from receptors in the mucosa. In previous experiments, it was shown that capsaicin applied to the mucosa stimulated gland secretion in the upper tracheas of WT but not cftr -/-mice (Ianowski et al., J Physiol, 2007, 580, 301) . It seemed important to assess a possible role of capsaicin-sensitive pathways in pigs and humans. We obtained pig tracheas following acute experiments carried out for other reasons, and human airways following lung transplants from donor tracheas and from the excised lungs of the transplant recipients. Secretion from individual submucosal glands was quantified optically by time-lapse digital imaging of the growth of spherical bubbles of mucus in an oil layer In humans, commercial chili oil (5 \u00b5M dispersed in 20 \u00b5M mineral oil) stimulated mucus secretion from submucosal glands from both donors (n = 46 glands from 9 subjects, 0.30 \u00b1 0.24 nl/min/gland) and disease control subjects (n = 45 glands from 7 subjects, 0.25 \u00b1 0.16 nl/min/gland). However, there were no responses to chili oil in submucosal glands from CF subjects (n = 36 glands from 5 subjects, 0.01 \u00b1 0.01 nl/min/gland). In pigs, we determined concentrationresponse relations for gland secretion in response to purified capsaicin (Sigma). The threshold was ~1 \u00b5M and the EC50 was 19.01 \u00b1 4.9 \u00b5M. The response to 100 \u00b5M capsaicin was partially blocked by high dose TTX (>1 \u00b5M). As in humans, the capsaicin response required CFTR, because it was blocked ~70% by CFTRinh-172, (n = 29 glands, from 4 pigs, p < 0.05). CFTRinh-172 is presently the most specific inhibitor of CFTR that can be used with glands, where we do not have access to the apical membrane. In ferrets, intrinsic airway neurons express acetylcholine, VIP and SP, often colocalized within the same neurons (Dey et al., Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 1996, 14, 207) . In pigs, all three of these transmitter systems appear to be involved in gland secretion to capsaicin, because the response was partially blocked by the NK-1 receptor blocker L703606 (oxalate salt, 1\u00b5M), the VIP receptor inhibitor L8K (10\u00b5M), and the muscarinic receptor blocker atropine (1\u00b5M); each of these blocked 36 to 59 % of the response (n = 21 to 39 glands from 3 to 5 pigs). Indeed, most of the local pathways are probably damaged, which may account for the relatively small responses to strong stimulation. Relatively few experiments have been carried out in intact airways with uninterrupted innervation and circulation, but in those experiments the glands were highly responsive to modest mucosal stimuli (reviewed in Wine, Auto Neurosci, 2007, 133, 35) . Hence, we hypothesize that (1) reflex stimulation of glands plays an important role in lung innate defenses; (2) defects in these responses is an important reason that CF airways are prone to infection, and (3) local reflexes may assume greater importance for maintaining the mucosal defenses of transplanted lungs.",

            "text": "Most airway mucus arises from submucosal glands, which express CFTR in their ciliated ducts and in serous cells. The airway glands secrete to agonists that either increase intracellular Ca2+ (e.g. Acetylcholine) or cAMP (e.g. VIP).Substance P(SP) also stimulates airway gland liquid secretion in pig (Trout L et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2001, 281,:L639) , suggesting that sensory afferents or local neurons that express SP play a role in stimulating submucosal glands. We used pharmacological methods to dissect the secretory mechanism of SP-induced gland secretion in comparison with responses to carbachol. Tracheas were obtained from pigs after acute surgeries carried out for other reasons. The ventral mucosa with underlying glands was dissected from the cartilage, pinned mucosal side up at the gas/bath interface of a physiological chamber, and covered with oil. Secretions from individual glands could be visualized as spherical bubbles in the oil, and secretion rates determined by optical monitoring of bubble diameters. Concentration-response relations for gland secretion were determined for SP (19-42 bubbles at each concentration from 9 pigs). The threshold was ~100 nM for SP and the EC50 was 1.76 \u00b1 0.57 \u00b5M. The maximum secretion rate to SP was 1.17 \u00b1 0.21 nl/min.gland, which is only ~ 1/3 of the maximal secretion rate to carbachol (3.43\u00b1 0.29 nl/min.gland). The inhibition profile for responses to SP (10 \u00b5M) was quite different from those to carbachol (200 nM, a value chose to mimic the secretion rate to 10 \u00b5M SP). Gland secretory responses to 10 \u00b5M SP (0.75 \u00b1 0.17 nl/min.gland, 41 glands from 4 pigs) were strongly inhibited by 20 \u00b5M CFTRinh-172 (0.34 \u00b1 0.10 nl/min.gland, 36 glands from 4 pigs, p<0.05), and by 25 \u00b5M Clotrimazole (0.28 \u00b1 0.06 nl/min.gland, 31 glands from 4 pigs), whereas 100 \u00b5M Niflumic acid did not inhibit (0.81 \u00b1 0.25 nl/min.gland, 32 glands from 3 pigs). In contrast, secretory response to 200 nM carbachol (0.61 \u00b1 0.22 nl/min.gland, 36 glands from 3 pigs) were only weakly inhibited by CFTRinh-172 (0.49 \u00b1 0.13 nl/min.gland, 29 glands from 3 pigs, p<0.05), and by Clotrimazole (0.53 \u00b1 0.16 nl/min.gland, 33 glands from 3 pigs, p>0.05), but niflumic acid, which was ineffective with SP, inhibited the carbachol response (0.44 \u00b1 0.13 nl/min.gland, 41 glands from 3 pigs, p<0.05). Gland secretion to SP depends at least partially on intracellular Ca2+ release, because the response was partially inhibited by 50 \u00b5M BAPTA-AM (0.33 \u00b1 0.09 nl/min.gland, 21 glands from 2 pigs, p<0.05). There was no additional effect of SP on top of 1 \u00b5M carbachol, but a subthreshold level of SP (50 nM) showed synergic response (0.44 \u00b1 0.22 nl/min.gland, 21 glands from 3 pigs) with subthreshold level of VIP (10 nM). We are presently testing how SP activates CFTR-dependent mucus secretion. In initial experiments to determine if PKC was being recruited, however the PKC inhibitor (GF 109203, Sigma) did not suppress SP-induced mucus secretion. In contrast, the NKCC inhibitor bumetanide (100 \u00b5M) markedly suppressed secretion to SP (0.22 \u00b1 0.06 nl/min.gland, 23 glands from 2 pigs, p<0.05).",

            "text": "Supported by NIDDK RO1-51817 (JJW), CFF and CFRI. Mucus obstruction of airways is considered the most vicious agent of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). To provide optimal defense of the small airways the volume/thickness of airway surface fluid must be controlled according to physiological demand. To date we have no clear understandings of how these fluids are maintained in a steady state between two pathological extremes (too little or too much) in native small airways. Earlier studies have attempted to measure the ion transport properties of small airways of sheep (Al-Bazzaz et. al. 2001 ) and pigs (Ballard et. al. 1992 ), but the complicated branching structure of small airways may have compromised electrical signals. To avoid dissection trauma Wang et. al. (2005) examined the electrophysiological properties of undissected intact small airways from pigs in vitro by microperfusing bronchioles (diam.1-2 mm) embedded in the lung parenchyma; however, these studies were limited to luminal manipulations and transbronchiolar electrical potentials only. To more rigorously define small airway properties, we designed a special micro Ussing chamber ( Area \u22481 mm 2 ). We excised and opened small airways (diam.1-2mm) of pig lung that we mounted as a flat sheet over a PVC supporting filter (10-20 \u00b5m holes). Both sides of the tissue could then be bathed with different solutions at 37\u00b0C. The luminal side was isolated by pressing a pipette (\u22481 mm diam., tip fire polished) on to the apical surface of the tissue until it sealed electrically. Constant current pulses (0.5-3.0 \u00b5A) were passed across the tissue. Transepithelial potential (TEP) and resistance in bilateral 150 mM NaCl Ringers were, -1.3 \u00b1 0.1 mV and 83.1 \u00b1 8.1 \u2126.cm 2 (Mean \u00b1 SE) respectively. When 150 mM NaGlu Ringers replaced the luminal solution, TEP increased significantly to -36.7 \u00b1 1.5 mV (n=30, p< 0.0005) and resistance increased to 173.8 \u00b1 21.0 \u2126.cm 2 (n=30, p< 0.0005. Adding forkskolin (Fsk, 10 \u00b5M) plus IBMX (0.1 mM) hyperpolarized the TEP to -40.22 \u00b1 1.99 mV (n=16, p<0.002), but decreased the resistance to 142.9 \u00b1 28.2 \u2126.cm 2 (n=16, p< 0.0001). Luminal amiloride (10 \u00b5M) depolarized the TEP to -32.6 \u00b1 1.6 mV (n=25, p<0.0001) but significantly increased resistance to 215.7 \u00b1 26.6 \u2126.cm 2 (n=25, p<0.0005). These results show that this system supports measurements of ion transport properties of airways smaller than 1 mm diameter where CF lung pathology is thought to originate. These airway epithelia express a very high constitutively active Clconductance and are apparently capable of secretory as well as absorptive functions. Amiloride sensitive Na + conductance (\u2248 43 mS/cm 2 ) was not significantly affected by Fsk added to activate secretion. The observation that stimulation with Fsk did not significantly suppress Na + conductance (\u2248 41 mS/cm 2 ) (p= 0.4) may suggest that separate groups of reabsorptive and secretory cells comprise small airway epithelia. Mucins are class of proteins uniquely characterized by large glycosylated domains. These proteins likely play a key role in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease as major constituents of mucus. In airways of both humans and mice, the gel-forming secreted mucins are represented by MUC5AC and MUC5B, and the transmembrane mucins are represented primarily by MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16. We have been interested in the role of the transmembrane mucins in airways and have previously demonstrated that lack of Muc1 in a knock-out mouse model (provided by S. Gendler) shows increased susceptibility to adenoviral-mediated gene transfer (Stonebraker, J. Virology, 2004) . To expand upon these findings, mice deficient for Muc4 were developed using embryonic stem cell technology by deleting exon 1 of the mouse Muc4 gene, which contains the ATG start codon and signal peptide. RNA analysis reveals loss of exon 1 in homozygous mutant mice and immunohistochemistry using a VNTR antibody indicated a loss of full length Muc4 protein. Muc4 homozygous mice are viable and do not develop any spontaneous, readily detectable disease phenotype. Although the Muc4 deficient mice do have reduced fertility consisting of both reduced litter size and number, all major tissue systems where the Muc4 protein is easily detected, including the eye, respiratory tract, intestine, and reproductive tracts, appear normal in year old mice after histological analyses. In contrast to the results we reported in the Muc1 mice, the Muc4 deficient mice do not show an increase in adenoviral mediated gene transfer, suggesting that Muc4 is not involved in the barrier aspect of the airway glycocalxy, at least for adenoviral infection. Interestingly, quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed up-regulation of Muc16 protein in the trachea of the Muc4 deficient mice, suggesting that Muc16 may be able to compensate for loss of Muc4. The expression of MUC4 in human ciliated cells as revealed by recent antibody studies prompted us to evaluate the potential role of Muc4 in ciliary function. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was monitored in a shear chamber using microscopy image analysis. CBF under baseline conditions for this study (low shear stress) from Muc4 deficient trachea (C57BL/6J congenic N5) was significantly lower than that for littermate controls (8.86 vs. 11.53, SEM \u00b11.31, P = 0.046). Application of shear resulted in increased CBF in both groups, although the WT response to shear was smaller in magnitude. Thus, Muc4 may have a role in supporting basal CBF and may make CBF less vulnerable to stimulation by shear, perhaps by reducing the inherent friction of ciliary motion. This finding underscores the usefulness of this model for dissecting out the normal roles that the transmembrane mucins play in airway biology. Supported by NIH (HL066973) and CFF (R026-CR02).",

In a search for a model to test the hypothesis we found that Ussing chamber short-circuit current(I sc ) measurements with freshly obtained airway mucosa provided useful information about ENaC activity in response to various drug treatments. In these studies we observed an as yet unidentified pathway that regulates surface ENaC activity. Airway mucosa from sheep tracheas displays a large, amiloride/benzamil-sensitive I sc prior to stimulation. When stimulated with basolateral carbachol, the ENaC I sc was almost abolished, as indicated by a sustained decrease (77.1 \u00b1 3.4%, n=14) in I sc after an initial increase and left a small effect to subsequent amiloride or benzamil. In contrast, when carbachol was given after benzamil, it again produced a peak response followed by a sustained increase (~30%, n=4) in the I sc . ENaC inhibition by carbachol was dose dependent with a minimal sensitivity between 0.1~1 \u00b5M and was slowly reversible. Apical 100 \u00b5M ATP also inhibited ENaC I sc by 48.4 \u00b1 8.1% (n=3) and carbachol on top of ATP further reduced the ENaC I sc by 93.6 \u00b1 3.9% (n=3). However, 10 U/ml of apyrase pretreatment, in attempt to breakdown ATP, failed to inhibit carbachol-induced ENaC inhibition, indicating that ATP release is not on obligatory component of carbachol inhibition of ENaC. Carbachol inhibition of ENaC could result from a direct action of carbachol on the surface epithelia, by activation of airway intrinsic neurons, or by activation of the glands, which were intact in these preparations and are strongly stimulated by carbachol. Rabbit tracheas, which lack airway submucosal glands, displayed large ENaC currents and these were not inhibited by cholinergic stimulation (n=3). Carbachol-induced ENaC inhibition, like gland stimulation but unlike stimulation of neurons, was mediated by muscarinic receptors since it was eliminated by atropine but not by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexomethonium bromide (n=3). However, inhibition of gland secretion with HEPES/bumetanide did not eliminate the ability of carbachol to inhibit ENaC. The effects of carbachol on surface Na + transport in our study are consistent with previous observations in microperfused sheep bronchiole preparations (Al-Bazzaz, AJP-Lung 11, 1994). Although we do not yet know the mechanism, it would be physiologically efficient if parasympathetic, cholinergic activation of airway gland secretion was accompanied by ENaC inhibition, which would minimize the fluid absorption by surface epithelia and increase clearance. It will be important to determine if cholinergic inhibition of ENaC is present in human tissues, and if so, if it is defective in CF.",

The majority of research aiming to elucidate the reason(s) of severe lung disease has focused on airway surface liquid (ASL) layer homeostasis or composition. The CFTR gene encodes a cAMP-regulated Clchannel located on the apical side of the epithelium and is instrumental in maintaining a hydrated ASL layer and promoting effective mucociliary clearance (MCC). In patients with class I or class II CFTR genetic mutations, normal CFTR Clchannel activity in the epithelium is impaired resulting in Na + hyperabsorption and consequently in the generation of a thick and static overlaying ASL layer creating an environment that favors progressively worsening bacterial infections.",

Electron microscopy analysis revealed that although the ASL layer was present at the time of isolation, there was no ASL layer following the perfusion of solutions necessary for the CBF measurements.

Clinical studies have linked increased sputum and peripheral blood neutrophil MPO activity with increased airflow obstruction in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients of the same age, gender, airway bacterial flora, and CFTR genotype. Variations in the TGF-\u03b21 gene associated with increased TGF-\u03b21 production have been linked to worse airflow obstruction in CF patients of similar age, gender and CFTR genotype. We hypothesized that in the presence of MPO, TGF-\u03b21 production would increase in airway epithelial cells. We obtained normal human airway epithelial cells (hAE) and cultured them in trans-wells. TGF-\u03b21 mRNA was measured by PCR. TGF-\u03b21 protein was detected by immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation. We found increased TGF-\u03b21 mRNA after hAE were exposed to MPO (at activities found in CF sputum) normalized to mRNA of constitutive beta actin. Under identical conditions, TGF-\u03b21 protein expression was increased in hAE. We conclude that neutrophil MPO present on the apical surface of cultured hAE induces transcription and protein synthesis of TGF-\u03b21. These results suggest that MPO induction of airway epithelial TGF-\u03b21 is one molecular system linking the chronic neutrophilic endobronchitis seen in CF and subsequent airway wall fibrosis. are more oxidatively stressed than normal. As oxidative stress (OS) is a potent activator of NF-\u03baB, these data supported our hypothesis that CFTR dysfunction causes alterations in the expression and/or modification of redox related proteins thereby enhancing activation of NF-\u03baB. Delineation of this interaction will produce good therapeutic targets. In this report we examine the role of OS in CF inflammation. Methods: To address our hypothesis, we used both in vitro and in vivo models of CF. Our airway epithelial cell models are the 9HTEo-pCEP and pCEP-R cell pair; and the 16HBEo-sense (S) and antisense (AS) cell pair. Additionally, we examined whole lungs from 8-12 week old B6.129S6-Cftr tm2Mrc mice (R117H mutants back-crossed into the C57BL6j background). Proteins were prepared from homogenates of whole samples, run on 2-D gels, and their densities compared. The gel spots of differentially expressed proteins were excised, subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and identified by LC MS/MS. For biochemical analysis, we tested for the levels of H 2 O 2 , glutathione, and lipid peroxidation. We correlated these data with measurements of NF-\u03baB activity (ELISA and cytokine production), and the activity of Nrf-2, an antioxidant (AO) response pathway transcription factor. We studied cultured cells in the presence and absence of inflammatory stimulation (TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2), and compared non-stimulated CF mouse lungs to lungs from normal litter mates. Results: Our proteomic analysis revealed that in the absence of inflammatory stimulation, a paradoxical decrease in AO proteins exists in CF cells by 2 or more fold compared to matched pairs. This is despite a significant increase in intracellular OS, which we confirmed by 3 different biochemical measures. Activity of Nrf-2 was decreased by ~30% in CF cells vs. normal. The data predict an increase in H 2 O 2 , which is a potent activator of NF-\u03baB, and we confirmed both a significant elevation in H 2 O 2 (up 3-5 fold in CF) and a related significant increase in NF-\u03baB activity, as assessed by ELISA for nuclear p50, and IL-6 and IL-8 production. When we analyzed whole lungs from CF mice for antioxidant protein levels, we similarly observed decreases vs. normal littermates. When cells were stimulated, differences in protein expression and oxidative stress between CF and normal were further enhanced, corresponding to an excessive activation of NF-\u03baB and increased production of IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment with the antioxidants NAC or selenium decreased the activation of NF-\u03baB to normal levels. Members of the ClC family of proteins form either voltage-gated chloride channels or Cl -/H + exchangers; nine subtypes are found in mammals. Among these, ClC-2 is one of the most ubiquitous variants, which is expressed in several of the types of epithelial cells that also express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It has been postulated that ClC-2 may be a suitable alternative chloride pathway in these cells; however the contribution of ClC-2 to chloride transport in these cells is poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of appropriate pharmacological tools that are capable of specifically inhibiting ClC-2. We describe here the isolation, from venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, of the first peptide inhibitor of any ClC channel. This toxin, which we have named GaTx2, specifically inhibits the ClC-2 channel. GaTx2 bears primary sequence identical to that of a toxin thought to serve as a K + channel inhibitor, although no molecular target for this toxin was previously known. A homology model of GaTx2 reveals that it adopts a similar fold to other scorpion toxins. GaTx2 was prepared via solid-phase chemical synthesis, and the synthetic toxin inhibits ClC-2 with higher affinity than any other inhibitor of ClC-2 or any other chloride channel. The K D for GaTx2mediated inhibition of ClC-2 in multichannel patches is only 11 pM at V M = -100 mV, and 80 pM at -160 mV. Single channel experiments show that GaTx2 does not alter single channel amplitude, but may alter channel gating. These experiments provide the basis for developing GaTx2 into a useful tool that can be used to define the role of ClC-2 in airway and intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the high affinity and specificity of inhibition suggest that GaTx2 interacts intimately with the channel, and thus may The exploitation of alternative chloride channels to bypass the defect in CFTR-mediated chloride secretion is an established therapeutic strategy in CF. In search of such potential therapeutic targets, we assessed cAMP/PKAdependent chloride secretion across excised nasal epithelium of Cftr null mice and wildtype controls, by measuring short-circuit currents (Isc) in an Ussing chamber set-up. All experiments were performed in the presence of amiloride to block the contribution of epithelial sodium channels to the Isc. In Cftr null mice of mixed background (C57BL/6;129), the cAMP agonist forskolin activated a bumetanide-sensitive rise in Isc that was comparable in magnitude to the CFTR-mediated Isc response of littermate controls (118\u00b130 vs. 90\u00b121 \u00b5A/cm 2 , respectively). The forskolin-induced Isc in these null mice was inhibited by the general chloride channel inhibitor DPC, but appeared insensitive to the CFTR inhibitors CFTRinh-172 and glibenclamide, the ORCC and calcium-activated chloride channel inhibitor DIDS, and the CLC-2 inhibitors cadmium and pre-activated omeprazol. Moreover, the Isc response to forskolin greatly exceeded the response to the calciumlinked agonists ionomycin and carbachol. Intriguingly, in nasal epithelium of Cftr null mice with a different genetic background (FVB), no such forskolin-inducible secretory pathway was evident (Cftr-/-: 7\u00b14 vs. Cftr+/+: 98\u00b123 \u00b5A/cm 2 ). When, in nasal epithelium of Cftr null mice (C57BL/6;129), the basolateral membrane electrical resistance was negated by nystatin treatment, and in the presence of a transepithelial chloride gradient, forskolin failed to elicit a rise in Isc, suggesting that cAMP/PKA signaling targets a basolaterally located ion transport system. Indeed, in intact epithelium, addition of chromanol 293B, a selective inhibitor of cAMP/PKA-activated potassium channels, to the serosal bath, blocked the forskolin-induced rise in Isc. We tentatively conclude that the hyperpolarization of nasal epithelial cells, which ensues from cAMP/PKA-induced potassium efflux across the basolateral membrane, drives chloride exit across the apical membrane via a constitutively active anion conductive pathway that is absent from FVB Cftr null mice. RT-PCR and immunostaining demonstrated that, among the candidate anion channels that fit the above pharmacological profile, CLC-Ka, but not CLC-Kb, was expressed in nasal epithelium of both Cftr null mice and controls (C57BL/6;129), together with the accessory protein barttin. Importantly, immunostaining suggested a strong increase in ClC-K protein abundance in the Cftr null mice, as compared to wildtype animals. On the basis of these findings, we postulate that CLC-Ka channels may serve as CFTR bypass channels in nasal epithelium of Cftr null mice that, albeit indirectly, are responsive to cAMP/PKA signaling. Future studies aim to characterize CLC-Ka and barttin in the airways from CF patients and controls, and to identify the post-transcriptional mechanism resulting in the up-regulation of CLC-Ka protein in Cftr null mice. In the disease cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common mutation F508del results in endoplasmic reticulum retention of misfolded CF gene proteins (CFTR). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) F508del-CFTR protein retention is dependent upon chaperone proteins, many of which require Ca 2+ for optimal activity. An increase in cytosolic free Ca 2+ concentration is dependent on the activity of ion channels in the membrane of ER and on extracellular Ca 2+ influx. This influx, named capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), induced by calcium store depletion, represents the major Ca 2+ influx mechanism in cells (Putney et al., 1986) . During the CCE, Ca 2+ influx can be mediated by one or several of the 7 isoforms of transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC) (Putney et al., 1986) .",

The permanent contact of the airway epithelium with the external milieu induces frequent injuries caused by inhaled pathogens and particles. Regeneration of the wounded airway epithelium needs to respect its prior structure in order to restore its defence functions. The underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the regeneration of the human airway epithelium are poorly described. The aim of our study was to determine, using a global expression approach, the transcriptional profile of human airway cells during the epithelial regeneration process. Human airway epithelial cells collected from nasal polyps were seeded on type IV collagen-coated porous membranes, cultured up to confluence in liquid-liquid(LL) conditions, then put at the air-liquid interface (ALI) allowing epithelial mucociliary differentiation. RNA were extracted from epithelial cells at 70% confluence in LL conditions (epithelial cell proliferation and migration stage, step I), after 5 days in ALI conditions (beginning of epithelial cell differentiation, step II), when first ciliated cells appeared (step III) and when cultures were completely differentiated (step IV). Our results demonstrated that between step I and step II, 127 genes were significantly modulated (ratio R<-3 or R>3, P<0.001), among them 74 were activated and 53 were repressed. Between step II and step III, 127 transcripts were up-regulated (tubulin, dynein, STATH, microtubule associated proteins\u2026) and only one gene (fatty acid desaturase-1) was repressed. Finally, between step III and step IV, except STATH which was~12-fold down-regulated, we observed only few genes differentially and slightly modulated. All along the regeneration process, between step I and step IV, 305 genes were significantly modulated with 84% of activated and 16% of repressed genes, among them a family of genes encoding proteins involved in the ciliary differentiation (FOXJ1, tektin, dynein, tubulin, \u2026), extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, laminin, \u2026) and inflammatory-related genes like cytokines, growth factors and their receptors (CCL20, VEGFC, CSF3, IL32, IL13RA2\u2026). By elucidating the specific transcriptome involved in each step of the human airway epithelium regeneration, our study could allow to better understand the different cellular and molecular mechanisms, as well as the chronological events involved in these processes, and will further be applied to the study of the regeneration process in cystic fibrosis airway epithelium.",

Electrolytes may be transported either through cells, the transcellular pathway, or between cells, the paracellular pathway. Most research has focused on the channels and transporters of the transcellular pathway, while much less is known about paracellular transport. Paracellular transport is regulated by tight junctions. Claudins, the main component of tight junctions, are necessary and sufficient for tight junction formation and are important in establishing ion selectivity. The goal of this study was to further investigate the role of tight junctions in human airway epithelia. Real-time PCR identified claudins 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 16 in primary human airway epithelia. Immunocytochemistry localized claudins 1, 3, 4, and 7 to tight junctions. To measure the relative ion selectivity of tight junctions, we studied well-differentiated human airway epithelia in Ussing chambers. To minimize transcellular transport, we used CF epithelia, which lack CFTR and blocked ENaC with amiloride. We found the PNa/PCl is 1.55 \u00b1 .34, suggesting tight juctions are more permeable to cations than anions. The relative cation selectivity was Na+ > K+ > Cs+ > TMA+ > Mg2+ and the relative anion selectivity was Cl-> Br-\u2265 I-> NO3-> Gluconate-. We compared these in vitro results to in vivo studies in people with CF and measured nasal voltage in the presence of amiloride. We found the PNa/PCl is 1.2 \u00b1 0.1. Tight junctions were slightly more selective for cations than anions in vitro and in vivo. To determine the effect of specific claudins on the selectivity of the paracellular pathway, primary human airway epithelia were infected with adenovirus expressing claudin 4 or GFP. Epithelia overexpressing claudin 4 had a higher transepithelial resistance (TER) and the PNa/PCl was 1.11. However, infection efficiency was only 22%. This lead us to investigate if transformed human airway epithelial cells lines may be a better model to study permeability. CuFi cells also express claudins 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 16. Furthermore, like the primary human airway, CuFi cells are more selective for cations; PNa/PCl = 1.38 \u00b1 .14. Future studies will investigate the effect of claudin expression on the paracellular permeability of these cells. The results will help identify the properties of a pathway critical to epithelial transport and barrier functions. Altered adenosine (ADO) signaling is associated with chronic lung disease and increased ASL ADO levels are thought to drive inflammation by stimulation of A2B receptors (A2B-R) in airway epithelia, which can activate NF\u03baB. When measured by lavage, ASL ADO is \u2264200 nM. Due to its relatively low affinity to ADO, A2B-R are thought to be inactive under normal conditions (EC50 is ~1.5 \u00b5M), and only stimulated during chronic lung disease. However, we have previously demonstrated that the ADO-receptor (ADO-R) antagonist 8-SPT inhibits ASL volume regulation, and that A2B-R is in close proximity to CFTR. Thus, we hypothesized that the ASL ADO concentration close to the apical membrane is higher than measured by ASL lavage in bulk solution. We tested this hypothesis by looking for ADO-R expression and function in well-differentiated human bronchial epithelia cultures (HBECs) and in vivo. By PCR analysis, we found that A2B-R was the only ADO-R expressed in HBECs. We then measured ASL height over 8 h \u00b1 ADO-R antagonists by XZ confocal microcopy when ASL height was preset to ~5 \u00b5m at t=0. At 30 \u00b5M, caffeine is a non-specific ADO-R antagonist, which inhibited ASL volume regulation (8 h ASL height was 4.1 \u00b5m vs. 8.2 \u00b5m for controls, n=6). Similar inhibition was observed with alloxazine, which is relatively specific for A2B-R (n=6). In contrast, DPCPX, ZM241385 & MRS241385, which inhibit A1, A2A & A3-R respectively had no effect on ASL volume regulation. ASL height regulation was also ablated by the addition of adenosine deaminase (ADA) to the ASL (n = 6). We next attempted to recapitulate the changes in ASL height seen under control conditions, i.e. increase from 5 to 8 \u00b5m over the initial 2 h followed by a plateau (the remainder of the 8 h) by adding the non-hydrolyzable ADO analogue NECA to the ASL in the presence of ADA. 100 nM NECA was insufficient to regulate ASL volume and height remained at 5 \u00b5m over 8 h.",

            "text": "In contrast, addition of 1 \u00b5M NECA to the ASL resulted ASL volume regulation that was indistinguishable from control conditions (n=6), suggesting that near-membrane ASL is much higher than has been measured by lavage. To confirm that A2B-R stimulates CFTR chloride secretion, we measured transepithelial potential differences of HBECs mounted in Ussing chambers. A dose-dependent increase in Cl-secretion was observed by ADO addition with an EC50 of 1.6 +/-0.09 \u00b5M, similar to the concentration of NECA required to regulate ASL height. To demonstrate which ADO-R are expressed in human airways in vivo, we used laser capture to obtain ciliated cells from frozen tissue sections of excised donor bronchi. Relative expression of A2B-R by qPCR was found to be 4.42 +/-0.30 fold higher than the A1, A2A-R, or A3 receptors (n=3). To confirm that ADO-R activate CFTR in vivo, we measured nasal potential differences. We found that ADO activated chloride secretion at similar levels to isoproterenol. The effect of ADO was inhibited by pre-exposure to 30 \u00b5m caffeine (ADO, 20.2 +/-2.5 mV; ADO + caffeine, 5.6 +/-4.9mV). We conclude that A2B-R has an important role in ASL homeostasis through regulation of CFTR and it is active in human airway epithelia under normal physiological conditions. Through osmotic forces, hypertonic saline (HS) may increase the volume of CF airway surface liquid, restore mucus clearance, and improve lung function. The Na + channel antagonist amiloride is predicted to increase the duration of action of HS. However, patients taking amiloride with HS showed less clinical benefits than patients taking placebo with HS. In vitro data suggested that amiloride inhibits transepithelial water flux (pF) in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. We have extended this study by looking at the effects of amiloride on aquaporins in a heterologous expression system (MDCK cells) and have used immunofluorescence to determine which aquaporins are expressed in human airways in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of ENaC by aprotinin pretreatment had no effect on HS-induced pF (n=6), suggesting that amiloride did not exert its actions on pF by inhibiting ENaC. However, since HS-induced pF was also inhibited with HgCl 2 , we speculated that amiloride directly blocked an aquaporin. To test this hypothesis, we measured the rate of cell shrinkage of wild-type MDCK cells, and those stably-expressing AQP1 or 5, or expressing AQP3 (after 24 h exposure to a mildly hypertonic media; 400 mOsm). Following mucosal exposure to a 450 mOsm hypertonic Ringer solution, MDCK cultures grown to confluency on permeable filters shrunk by 8% after 30 s (n = 6), as measured by XZ confocal microscopy following staining with calcein-AM. In contrast MDCK/AQP1 or MDCK/AQP3 cultures shrunk by 20% over the same period and MDCK/AQP5 cultures shrunk by 35% (all n=6). A 10 min pretreatment with 200 \u00b5M amiloride abolished hypertonic Ringer-induced cell shrinkage in MDCK/AQP5 cultures (93% at 30 s; n=6) but had no affect on cell shrinkage in AQP1 or AQP3 expressing cultures. Amiloride is fluorescent and can be imaged in epithelia by XZ confocal scanning under UV excitation. Amiloride was not internalized immediately (<10 s) before hypertonic Ringer addition and did not block AQP5-mediated cell shrinkage (69% at 30 s; n = 6). However, a 10 min pretreatment with amiloride caused it be internalized and at this time AQP5-induced cell shrinkage was blocked, suggesting that amiloride blocks AQP5 intracellularly. To confirm that AQP5 is present in airway epithelia, we performed immunostaining with an AQP5 antibody and found that AQP5 is highly expressed at the apical membrane of ciliated cells in human bronchial tissue and well-differentiated bronchial cultures. We conclude that amiloride blocks AQP5, which is abundantly expressed in the superficial airway epithelia.",

We have also shown that A1 expression is decreased in cftr-/-mouse tissues. We postulate that CFTR, A1 and cPLA2 participate in the regulation of inflammation by their dynamic interaction within DIM. In this study we aimed to (i) demonstrate and characterize this interaction, and (ii) identify other potential partners of this complex in DIM. By coimmunoprecipitation, we examined the interaction between CFTR, A1 and cPLA2 in human pulmonary epithelial cells CALU3. To search for additional partners we developed a new proteomic approach based on double SDS-Page (dSDS-Page), which is compatible with membrane protein analysis. CALU3 cells and human epithelial bronchial CFBE cells (expressing either WT or F508delCFTR) were subjected or not to proinflammatory conditions (TNF\u03b1). DIM were isolated by density gradient and analyzed by dSDS-Page. CFTR immunoprecipitated with A1 and cPLA2 in CALU3 cells. dSDS-Page analyses showed significant differential expression of cytokeratin 18, actin and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, involved in protein folding) in DIM between control and proinflammatory conditions in CALU3 cells, and between WT and F508del CFBE cells, as determined by mass spectrometry.

HBEs exposed to SMM for 48 h, or infected with RSV 72 h prior, released 2-3 times more ATP following hypotonic challenge than control cultures (Okada, Ped Pulm sppl, 2006) . The increase in peak ATP concentrations correlated with the degree of inflammation as indexed by IL-8 secretion and the increase in intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ i ) mobilization in response to hypotonic challenge, but not with the goblet cell number. Ca 2+ i mobilization in response to hypotonic challenge in control HBEs was almost completely due to extracellular Ca 2+ i influx which was inhibited by antagonists of a transient receptor potential V4 (TRPV4) Ca 2+ channel. In contrast, an additional component of ATP-induced Ca 2+ i release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was observed in SMM-treated HBEs. The increase in hypotonicity-induced ATP release in SMM-treated HBEs compared to control HBEs was almost completely sensitive to chelation of Ca 2+ i by BAPTA (10 \u00b5M; 1 h), or inhibition of exocytosis by brefeldin A (5 \u00b5M; 2.5 h), monensin (10 \u00b5M; 18 h) or N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM; 15 min), whereas these reagents were ineffective against hypotonicity-induced ATP release from control HBEs. These data suggest a positive feedback loop between the increased ATP release linked to Ca 2+ i -dependent exocytosis and the increase in ATP-induced Ca 2+ i mobolization linked to increased ER Ca 2+ i stores (Ribeiro, JBC 280, 2005) in inflamed HBEs.",

The advantage of this new technology is the high throughput, parallel detection of identified, known, low abundance proteins. Antibody microarray results are usually given in terms of ratios between two samples (e.g., \"experiment\" and \"control\"). However, given the printing and calibration issues inherent with antibody microarrays, this ratio'ing approach precludes statistically valid inter-array comparisons of the individual protein concentrations. We have therefore developed and implemented a different calibration strategy using a benchmark mixture that is applied to every array as an internal standard, thus controlling for any differences in antibody activities as well as printing imperfections. The amount of protein bound to each spot is determined relative to the respective protein in the internal standard. Since all samples in the study are compared to the same internal standard, this semi-quantitative approach permits the comparison of multiple samples.

Female gender appears to be associated with more rapid decline of lung function and earlier death in CF. This suggests that gender differences in hormonal environments might influence ASL height regulation, thus modifying the pulmonary phenotype. We hypothesized that changes in estrogen concentrations might alter ASL hydration by affecting CaCC. Consistent with this, we have shown that estrogen attenuates increases in intracellular calcium and ASL height that follow purinergic receptor activation in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs, see accompanying abstract by Hengrui Sun et al).

However, how epithelial cells release nucleotides into the airways remains largely unknown. CFTR has been suggested to mediate ATP release in airway epithelia, but conclusive demonstration remains elusive. CalU-3 is a human airway derived cell line often described as a model of airway gland serous cells. At least 70% of cells in a monolayer expressed high levels of CFTR protein and activity at the apical membrane. ATP, adenosine, and UDP-glucose, the naturally occurring agonists for the P2Y2, A2b, and P2Y14 receptors, respectively, were quantified in airway surface liquid with nanomolar sensitivity using radiolabeling and fluorescence HPLC-based techniques, and real-time ATP measurements. ATP (and UDP-glucose) was found to be released constitutively and selectively onto the mucosal surface of Calu-3 cells. However, the specific CFTR inhibitor 172 (10 \u00b5M, 10-30 min) failed to decrease ATP concentration in the mucosal bath of resting CalU-3 cells. Forskolin (10 \u00b5M, 10 min) stimulated CFTR channel activity, but did not affect basal levels of ATP (or UDPglucose) release. In contrast, elevation of intracellular calcium using ionomycin (1-10 \u00b5M, 1-10 min) significantly increased ATP (and UDP-glucose) release into the mucosal (but not serosal) bath of CalU-3 cells. Calciummediated nucleotide release enhancement was not abolished by CFTR inhibitor 172. Maneuvers like pre-incubation in nominally free-calcium solution, BAPTA (10 \u00b5M, 30 min), or cytochalasin D (5\u00b5M, 30 min) to disrupt actin cytoskeleton, which inhibited regulated exocytosis in CalU-3 cells, also reduced calcium-mediated increase in nucleotide release. CalU-3 monolayers presented a fraction of cells (<30%) exhibiting negligible CFTR immunostaining signal, but displaying airway goblet cell mucin granules. Remarkably, stimulation of ATP and UDP-sugar release with ionomycin resulted in concomitant enhanced exocytotic secretion of MUC5AC. These results suggest that CFTR is not involved in regulation of ATP release in airway epithelial cells. More likely, nucleotides and nucleotide-sugars residing in the biosynthetic pathway involved in modification of apically targeted glycoconjugates (e.g. mucins) are released to the extracellular environment via calcium-triggered exocytosis.",

Furthermore, the secretion of exoenzyme S by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is enhanced during an exacerbation of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. In the past few years, our laboratory has shown that exposition of lung epithelial cells to P. aeruginosa LPS leads to a rapid decrease in activity and expression of ENaC channel. The aim of our study was to evaluate the mechanism involved in the modulation of ENaC expression and activity by LPS. Primary culture of lung epithelial cells grown on filters were treated with LPS (15\u00b5g/ml) for different time (30min, 1, 2, 4h). At each time point, the total and amiloride-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) was determined in Ussing chamber. In parallel, the cell proteins were collected to investigate by western blot the signalling pathways involved in this response to LPS. A 4 hours LPS treatment leads to a significant decrease in alpha and gamma ENaC mRNA to 44% and 53% of control respectively. Similarly, the amiloridesensitive current was decreased by 53% of the current in untreated cells after a 30 min exposure to LPS. By western blot, we demonstrated the strong implication of the PI3K/Akt pathway in response to LPS in the regulation ENaC mRNA and the potential implication of tyrosine/kinase receptors signalling pathway through mTOR in the regulation of ENaC channel activity.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we demonstrate that inflammatory molecules can modulate the expression and function of the Na+ transport mechanism in lung epithelial cells and could contribute to the modulation of airway surface fluid in the chronic infectious process associated with CF. Serous acinar cells are thought to be crucial for secretion of airway surface liquid by submucosal glands in large airways, but the molecular mechanisms of serous cell ion and fluid transport are not well understood. To address this, we isolated murine nasal serous acinar cells and studied them using simultaneous DIC and quantitative fluorescence microscopy to track changes in cell volume and intracellular concentrations of ions involved in fluid secretion ([Cl -] i ; SPQ) and its regulation ([Ca 2+ ] i ; fura-2). Previous results indicated that serous acinar cell volume changes were indicative of solute efflux (shrinking) and solute influx (swelling), reflecting the secretory state of the cell. Acinar cells stimulated with 100 \u00b5M carbachol (CCh) exhibited a rapid increase in [Ca 2+ ] i and subsequent ~ 20 % cell shrinkage due to efflux of ~ 67 % of cell Clcontent and parallel loss of K + and osmotically obliged H 2 O. Because murine serous cells are sites of apical CFTR expression in the airway, we tested the requirement for CFTR in CCh/Ca 2+activated shrinkage/Clefflux. Acinar cells isolated from either cftr tm1Unc-/mice or Wt cells pre-treated with CFTR inh 172 exhibited identical rates and magnitudes of Ca 2+ -induced cell shrinkage and Clloss compared to Wt control cells. Resting [Cl -] i was also identical in Wt and cftr tm1Unc-/serous acinar cells (65 \u00b1 4 and 66 \u00b1 2 mM, respectively), suggesting similar levels of resting Clconductance. Thus, murine serous acinar cells can secrete KCl/H 2 O by Ca 2+ -dependent mechanisms in the absence of functional CFTR, in agreement with studies of intact glands suggesting CCh-induced glandular fluid secretion is CFTR-independent. Wt serous acinar cells were stimulated with cAMP-agonists, including 15 \u00b5M forskolin, 100 \u00b5M isoproterenol, 200 \u00b5M adenosine, and 3 \u00b5M VIP. However, no cAMP-induced shrinkage was observed, even in the presence of a cocktail of inhibitors to block solute uptake. To determine if CFTR activation could enhance CCh/Ca 2+ -induced cell shrinkage at a sub-optimal [CCh], serous acinar cells were pre-treated with forskolin followed by stimulation with 1 \u00b5M CCh in the continued presence of forskolin. However, similar rates and magnitudes of cell shrinkage were observed in forskolin-treated and control cells. These results suggest that the magnitude of the CFTR Clconductance in murine serous acinar cells is much smaller than the Ca 2+ -activated Clconductance, below the resolution of these optical assays. More sensitive electrophysiological approaches are being used to determine the molecular identity of the non-CFTR Clconductance(s) and the role of CFTR in murine serous acinar cell ion transport. Females with CF exhibit more rapid decline in FEV1 than males, which reduces their life span. Normal airway epithelia regulate airway surface liquid (ASL) volume and mucus transport by secretion through both CFTR and the Ca2+-activated Cl-channel (CaCC), and inhibition of either of these pathways in isolation does not abolish mucus transport. However, a loss of both pathways is predicted to result in mucus plugging which contributes to lung disease. Despite a loss of CFTR, CaCC is functional in CF airways due to mechanical stimulation of ATP release and activation of the P2Y2 pathway which serves to raise intracellular Ca2+. We hypothesized that E2 may inhibit CaCC, leaving females with CF more prone to lung disease than males due to a greater depletion of ASL volume. Using confocal microscopy, we found that acute pre-exposure with E2 inhibited ATP induced ASL secretion in normal and CF human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) from both male and female donors. The IC50 for E2-inhibition of ATP-induced ASL secretion was 0.75 nM. To better understand how estrogen receptors (ERs) interact with the P2Y2 pathway, we transiently transfected ER-\u03b1 or ER-\u03b2 linked to an orange fluorescent protein in an ER null BHK cell line. With the co-transfection of HA tagged P2Y2-R, we observed that E2 addition did not induce internalization of P2Y2-R, neither did it alter the internalization induced by ATP. We then measured total cell inositol phosphates (IP) in CF airway cells +/-E2 pretreatment. Cell IP levels were not different between groups (n=9), suggesting that the effect of E2 is downstream of IP production. The investigation of the changes of the intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) by recording Fura-2 emission ratio over time in ER-\u03b1 or ER-\u03b2 expressed cells provided clues. After 10 nM E2 exposure, the Fura-2 emission ratio in untransfected cells (n=7) or ER-\u03b2 transfected cells (n=7) increased by 0.6 following 10 uM ATP addition. This increase was significantly inhibited by~40% in ER-\u03b1 transfected cells (n=7), providing good evidence that ER-\u03b1 is respon-sible for inhibiting the P2Y2 pathway. We next measured Ca2+i in normal HBECs. While acute 10 nM E2 addition had no affect on basal Ca2+i levels, which were around 370 nM, this maneuver reduced the Ca2+i response to 70 nM following ATP addition (both n=9), suggesting that E2 addition altered Ca2+ signaling in response to ATP. Thapsigargin induces Ca2+i release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but the magnitude of Ca2+i release after thapsigargin addition was not altered by E2 pretreatment, indicating that E2 works further up stream to affect the P2Y2 signaling pathway. Together, these results suggest that E2 directly interacts with the P2Y2 signaling pathway through ER-\u03b1 by altering Ca2+i. We propose that this interaction leaves females more vulnerable to infections due to a reduced ASL volume during periods of high E2, such as occur prior to ovulation. The nasal potential difference (or NPD) is a sensitive, real time bioelectric assay of CFTR-dependent and independent ion transport that is a commonly used study endpoint in early clinical stages of drug development. Technical limitations of the assay must be controlled to facilitate its use in multicenter trials and limited intra-site variability.",

We repeatedly evaluated (within 7 days) the basal potential difference of five normal subjects using the two available techniques, then compared variance and repeatability of the measures. Basal PD was measured during perfusion of Ringer's solution, and measured at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 cm within the inferior meatus, as indicated in the CF-TDN standard operating procedures. Mean basal PD were within 0.8 mV using the two techniques, with very similar coefficients of variation (CVar; 0.36 vs. 0.32 in AgCl vs. calomel, respectively). Maximum basal PDs were also similar between the two methodologies (mean difference 1.5 mV; CVar 0.32 and 0.28, respectively). The correlation between first and second measures of mean PD was highly reproducible, and similar between the two techniques (r=0.94 vs. 0.91 in AgCl vs. calomel, respectively); however, when each individual basal PD measure was compared, correlation between first and second PD using the AgCl device appeared superior (r=0.90 vs. 0.60 respectively; n=25 measures per device). Comparison of values obtained in CF subjects are currently in progress and will also be reported. Next, we examined diagnostic NPD tracings in 12 CF subjects for whether the effect of amiloride might influence values obtained in the contralateral nare. An effect of cross-contamination by amiloride or other agent (gene therapy vectors or other nasal administered compounds, for example) could influence accurate measure of NPD values. When basal PDs were performed in both nostrils prior to amiloride exposure in either nostril, mean basal PD between nares remained stable (<1 mV, p=NS for change). However, if the basal PD in one nostril was measured after amiloride exposure in the contralateral side, mean PD depolarized by 12 mV (from -50 to -38 mV; p<0.01), indicating the presence of a 'cross-nostril' amiloride effect that might potentially affect interpretation of this endpoint if not performed in a sequence designed to avoid amiloride exposure. In summary, we show that calomel and AgCl electrodes perform similarly in repeated measures from the same normal subjects, and that improper NPD sequence can adversely affect basal PD measures. Other potential impediments to the PD measurement (e.g. solution temperature, tonicity, ionic content, and sources of electrical offset) will also be discussed. These findings are relevant to the optimizing the use of the NPD assay in clinical trials.",

            "text": "Supported by NIH, CFF, and CFFT. The gene defective in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel in the apical membrane of epithelia, but alteration of expression and function of many genes undoubtedly contributes to the pleiotropic manifestations of CF. A hallmark of CF in airway epithelia is the hyperabsorption of sodium through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the apical membrane followed by extrusion through the Na,K-ATPase in the basolateral membrane. This results in airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration, mucus buildup and bacterial infection characteristically observed in the lungs of CF patients. Previous studies have shown that the Na,K-ATPase is increased in CF airway epithelia, consistent with increased sodium transport along the ENaC/Na,K-ATPase axis. We have previously demonstrated that FXYD5, a member of a small family of proteins known to regulate the Na,K-ATPase, is increased in S489X CF mouse lung and nasal epithelia and in primary human tracheal epithelial cells (HTE) after treatment with an inhibitor of CFTR (172). Recent evidence has indicated that ENaC activation occurs through modification of the serine protease-protease inhibitor balance in ASL. Thus, we hypothesized that ENaC-mediated increases in sodium absorption may be partially responsible for the increase in FXYD5 expression observed in CF airway epithelia. We now report that increasing ASL volume on HTE cells upregulated FXYD5 expression (P<0.01) after 24 hours, an effect that was further increased after trypsin addition and abrogated by the serine-protease inhibitor aprotinin. Treatment of HTE cells with nystatin also increased FXYD5 expression measured by quantitative RT-PCR (P<0.01). Based on these results and the observation that mice overexpressing ENaC beta-subunit exhibit cystic fibrosis-like lung pathophysiology, we examined FXYD5 expression in the lungs of mice overexpressing the Scnn1b-transgene. Contrary to our expectations, FXYD5 lung expression was decreased as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis (P<0.005), indicating FXYD5 may be alternatively regulated in epithelia under conditions of acute versus chronic sodium hyperabsorption. Therefore, we measured FXYD5 expression in an epithelial cell culture model using an inducible, tri-cistronic vector capable of expressing ENaC alpha, beta and gamma subunits. We determined that FXYD5 expression is decreased after chronic ENaC induction. We conclude that FXYD5 expression is coordinately regulated based on acute versus chronic ENaC-mediated sodium absorption and suggest that FXYD5 is increased in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia as a result of an imbalance between increased inflammatory signaling and altered ion transport.",

            "text": "Picher, M.; van Heusden, C. Cystic Fibrosis Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Airway infection by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered an important cause of pulmonary exacerbation and hospitalization in cystic fibrosis (CF) children. This disease is characterized by functional mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The inability of CFTR -/-mice to clear RSV is associated with exaggerated inflammatory responses. A relationship was recently established between airway inflammation and chronically-elevated airway adenosine. This signaling molecule regulates key aspects of lung defenses, including bacterial clearance and inflammatory cells. High adenosine levels measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic or CF patients cause airway inflammation, remodeling and fibrosis in animal models. The objective of this study was to investigate the longterm effects of RSV infection on adenosine regulation and inflammatory responses in human airway epithelia. Methods. Polarized primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells from healthy subjects and CF patients were exposed to vehicle, UV-inactivated or active green fluorescent protein (GFP)-RSV. The cultures were monitored 21 days for infection (fluorescence microscopy), adenosine levels (fluorescence chromatography), the release of cytokines regulating adenosine TNF\u03b1) and enzyme activities (ecto 5'-nucleotidase [ecto 5'-NT: AMP \u00c7 adenosine] and adenosine deaminase 1 [ADA1: adenosine \u00c7 inosine]). Results. (A) Both normal and CF cultures exhibited detectable RSV infection over 21 days, with peak density on day 3-4. (B) We demonstrate that RSV enhances the release of all five cytokines from normal cultures over 21 days. In contrast, CF cultures responded to RSV by a transient decrease in IL-1\u03b2, IL-4 and TNF\u03b1 (peak on day 3), but a sustained decrease in IL-12, and a sustained increase in IL-13, secretion. (C) On normal epithelia, RSV transiently stimulated ecto 5'-NT (peak on day 3) but caused a sustained increase in ADA1 activity, resulting in chronically-low adenosine levels. In CF, RSV raised adenosine levels by the combined effects of a sustained increase in ecto 5'-NT activity and the lack ADA1 response. (D) Chronically-elevated adenosine generated by ADA1 inhibition [erythro9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine] stimulated the secretion of all cytokines, except IL-12. Conclusion. These data support a complex relationship between adenosine and cytokine regulation in human airway epithelia. The IL-13-adenosine amplification pathways identified in RSV-infected CF epithelia are in agreement with animal models and their key role in chronic airway inflammation/remodeling. On the other hand, the data also suggest that ADA1 activity is influenced by IL-12, known to stimulate the expression of a major protein anchoring soluble ADA1 to epithelial surfaces: CD26. Altogether, this study suggests that an RSV infection in CF children may accelerate the progression of the disease by setting the stage for airway adenosine-cytokine amplification pathways. Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (Picher 05G0). Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway submucosal glands are defective in mucus secretion rate (Jayaraman, PNAS, 2001, 98, 8119; Joo, J Biol Chem, 2002, 277, 50710; Joo, Pediatr. Pulmonol., 2003, Suppl. 70, 281; Wine, Proc ATS, 2004, 1, 47; Thiagarajah, Faseb J, 2004, 18, 875; Song, AJP Cell, 2005; Salinas, Faseb J, 2005, 19, 431) . One hypothesis is that loss of CFTR results in reduced secretion of electrolytes leading to underhydration of mucins, thereby altering the mucus properties. It has been generally believed that the CF mucus in response to cholinergic agonists is thicker and more viscous. However, comparisons of pure gland mucus are difficult because of variability in gland secretion rates and a decline in mucus solids with repeated stimulations (Wu, Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2006, Suppl. 29, 252) . In the present study, we directly compared the solid content of airway submucosal gland mucus between control and CF individuals. Human donor tracheas (HN) or disease control bronchi (DC) were dissected and mounted as previously described but without mineral oil. Tissue was kept warmed and humidified in a chamber with two layers of saturated 37 degree C 95/5% CO 2 /O 2 water vapor. The mucosal surface was blotted dry and coated with a thin layer of dimethylpolysiloxane to prevent re-absorption by the surface epithelium. The tissue surface was covered with a cover slip, leaving minimal air space between it and the surface to further reduce evaporation. A 12 \u00b5L droplet of 2% NaCl was placed at the side of every tissue as a standard to assess evaporation and measurement error. Any basal secretions were removed prior to stimulation with 10 \u00b5M carbachol. Mucus secretion from individual glands was pooled using forceps and then drawn into a constant bore microcapillary (Drummond) that had been alcohol-cleaned, dried, and weighed. Stimulation time was allowed to vary so that at least 2 \u00b5L of mucus was collected. After mucus collection, both the standard and the bath solution were refreshed. Mucus filled capillaries were weighed with a Mettler microbalance before and after overnight 80 degree C oven drying to obtain nonvolatile solid content. The average solids measured in six repeated measures of 2% salt solutions was 2 \u00b1 0.2 % with no trend over time. Results for HN (N=5) and DC (N=3) did not differ and were pooled as 'Control'. The initial Control secretion yielded 6.5 \u00b1 0.8 % solids (mean \u00b1 SEM, n=8 subjects) and required 24 \u00b1 3 min to produce adequate mucus. The initial CF secretion gave 9.1 \u00b1 0.5 % solids (n=4) in 31 \u00b1 2 min. The second Control secretion yielded 5.6 \u00b1 0.5 % solids (n=8) and required 40 \u00b1 5 min, whereas the second CF secretion gave 7.4 \u00b1 0.9 % solids (n=4) and required 56 \u00b1 7 min. In summary, CF gland mucus solids content was 40% higher than Control following the first stimulation (P = 0.05). After the second stimulation, CF solids content was 32% higher than the control (P = 0.08). Solids contents of controls observed in our experiment are much higher than was found for mucus collected from airway lumens after 2 hr stimulation (c. 2%, Trout, Am J Physiol, 1998, 274, L258) . Supported by NIDDK RO1-51817 (JJW) and CFF. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) as well as in some animal models of CF lung disease, higher levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) have been detected compared to control subjects. It is not clear whether this excess of PGE2 contributes to the airway pathology of CF, or whether it may serve a protective function against airway constriction. Inhaled PGE2 has been tried in asthma and may be of benefit as a bronchodilator. Interestingly, PGE2 has shown benefit in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics, a population that shares some features with the CF airway phenotype including nasal polyposis. The mechanism of airway relaxation to PGE2 is mediated primarily by EP2 receptors signaling through cAMP. In CF, beta-adrenergic bronchodilators are commonly used, but are often only partially effective at reversing bronchospasm. Beta-agonists and PGE2 both signal through G-proteins coupled to cAMP and PKA signaling, thus PGE2 may offer another treatment when beta-agonists are ineffective at reversing bronchospasm in CF. In mouse tracheas, the beta-agonist isoproterenol (ISO) will partially relax a pre-contracted airway, but 47 \u00b1 2% of contractile force remains (n=13). In contrast to the limited relaxation with ISO, constricted mouse airways demonstrate significantly greater relaxation to PGE2, with only 18 \u00b1 3% of force remaining (n=9, p<0.001 compared to ISO). This difference in relaxation responses suggests different intracellular signals are activated by each agonist despite both signaling through PKA. To investigate phosphorylation events in response to ISO or PGE2, we developed a new method for perfusing isolated mouse lungs. Using this technique, tissues were perfused with buffered solution containing 32P for radiolabeling. Lungs were then stimulated with either ISO or PGE2, and phosphoproteins were compared from each condition. Radiolabeling was effective under all three conditions. Targets were chosen from each group (unstimulated, ISO, or PGE2 treated) that showed phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, and proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Over 20 differentially phosphorylated proteins were identified, and two of these (Rho GDI 1 and Inositol-requiring protein 2) were selected as candidates to be tested in the context of relaxation to PGE2 compared to ISO. By identifying signaling targets involved in airway relaxation to PGE2, it may be possible to activate beneficial airway relaxation responses without the limitations seen in ISO relaxation and without activating PGE2 responses other than relaxation that may link PGE2 to the airway pathology seen in CF. The parental \u2206F508/\u2206F508 CF bronchial epithelial cell line (CFBE41o-) was compared to clones of CFBE41o-complemented with 6.2kB wild type (wt) or 4.7kB \u2206F508 CFTR cDNA in terms of their ion transport characteristics. The transepithelial resistance (RT) (~310 (cm2) observed in the parental CFBE41o-was maintained in the complemented cells. Two clones complemented with wt CFTR cDNA (c7-6.2wt and c10-6.2wt) demonstrated RT ~315 \u2126cm2, while another clone (c4-4.7\u2206F) complemented with the \u2206F508 CFTR cDNA showed an RT of ~340 \u2126cm2. Two stable clones expressing wt CFTR were selected based on electrophysiological characteristics and stability of CFTR expression. Forskolin-stimulated Cl secretion in clone c7-6.2wt was on average 13.4\u00b12.5 \u00b5A/cm2 and 41.3\u00b125.3 \u00b5A/cm2 in clone c10-6.2wt. Furthermore small cAMP-stimulated transepithelial current of 4.7\u00b10.7 \u00b5A/cm2 was observed in clone c4-4.7\u2206F indicating that \u2206F508 CFTR can traffic to the plasma membrane if present at high enough levels at physiological temperatures. The role that CFTR plays in Ca-activated Cl conductance was investigated following treatment of the cells with ATP in parental CFBE41o-and wtCFTR6.2-CFBE41o-monolayers. In symmetrical Cl-containing solutions, mucosal application of ATP (100 \u00b5M) elicited a small, transient Cl secretory response in the parental CFBE41ocells (8.5\u00b12.1 \u00b5A/cm2), while the magnitude of the ATP-stimulated Cl current was markedly enhanced in CFTR-corrected CFBE41o-cells with peak currents at 29.8\u00b16.4 \u00b5A/cm2. Recordings done in presence of a serosal-tomucosal Cl gradient to increase the driving force for Cl secretion showed a transient ATP-dependent activation of Cl currents in parental CFBE41ocells with peak Cl currents of 33.3\u00b13.8 \u00b5A/cm2 (n=30). CFTR corrected CFBE41o-cells showed a sustained activation of Cl currents of similar magnitude (42.7\u00b110.5 \u00b5A/cm2; n=16). ATP-stimulated Cl currents were effectively blocked by the CFTR inhibitor GlyH101 (20\u00b5M). Histochemical analysis showed prominent epithelial characteristics in all clones. These observations indicate that i) the apical driving force is limiting for ATP-stimulated Cl secretion and that ii) CFTR participates in the Cl secretory response to ATP. Furthermore, the findings suggest that these novel clonal isolates of the CFBE41o-bronchial epithelial cell line can be useful for the investigation of CF therapies. This work was supported by grants from the CFF, CFRI, NIH, Elizabeth Nash Foundation, and PACFI. The lactoperoxidase (LPO) system functions in normal airways to prevent infection and may be compromised in cystic fibrosis (CF) due to defective transport of its substrate thiocyanate. A computational model of normal airway surface liquid suggests that hydrogen peroxide levels regulate LPO system activity and that the lower thiocyanate in CF airways may result in elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide that is likely produced by Duox the major NADPH oxidase in airway epithelial cells. To investigate the regulation of Duox by bacterial products, passage 1 normal human airway epithelial cells were grown and redifferentiated at the air liquid interface and treated for 12, 24 or 48h with either Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin or LPS, applied apically. Treated and mock treated cultures were analyzed for levels of Duox and LPO mRNA and protein, and for hydrogen peroxide production. Quantitative PCR was performed using Taqman kits, protein was measured by Western blots, and hydrogen peroxide was quantified using amplex red-HRP coupled fluorescence. The data showed the Duox 2 and LPO mRNA but not Duox 1 mRNA, were significantly upregulated at all measured time points following apical treatment of the cultures with purified flagellin compared to mock treated. At 24 h Duox 2 was increased 7.7 +/-3.8 fold and LPO was increased 2.3 +/-0.7 fold (means +/-S.E.M., n = 5 lungs, 1-3 cultures of each lung).",

            "text": "MUC5AC mRNA was also upregulated by flagellin treatment (4.9 +/-1.6 fold, n = 5 lungs, 1-3 cultures of each lung). Apical treatment with LPS had no effect on any tested mRNA and induced minimal IL-8 secretion in these cultures. Western blots using anti-Duox antibodies (courtesy of F. Miot, Brussels, Belgium) showed corresponding increases in Duox protein following flagellin treatments. Hydrogen peroxide production by flagellin treated cultures was increased in proportion to increases in Duox 2 mRNA. Application of flagellin alone to the apical surface of previously untreated cultures did not increase hydrogen peroxide production. Thus, Pseudomonas flagellin up-regulates Duox 2 and results in higher activity in normal human airway epithelial cells perhaps serving to increase innate host defense activity of the LPO system. Chloride ion in phagolysosomes is an essential substrate for neutrophils to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl), an important bactericidal agent. We have previously shown that CFTR was present in the phagolysosomal membrane of neutrophils and the CFTR defect led to deficient chlorination of ingested Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) (Painter et al, Biochemistry, 45:10260-10269, 2006) . These results suggested that chloride accessibility to the phagolysosomal lumen might be impaired in CF neutrophils thereby affecting neutrophil-mediated bacterial killing. To understand the role of chloride ion in the process, we first assessed the effect of extracellular chloride concentration on PA killing by normal neutrophils under iso-osmotic conditions. Surprisingly, bacterial killing was strongly dependent on extracellular chloride concentration. The initial rate of killing of PA was~2 fold less in a chloride-free medium than a physiological chloride medium. Killing efficiency increased as the chloride concentration was raised in a dosedependent fashion and plateaued at~60 mM chloride concentration. To determine what percent of the chloride-dependent killing was oxidantdependent, we applied the CFTR inhibitor GlyH-101, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) and the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodium chloride (DPI), respectively to bacterial killing assays. The results showed that the killing of PA could be divided into three discernible components: (1) a component accounting for about 20-25 % of the total killing rate that was inhibited by GlyH-101, ABAH or DPI; (2) a second component amounting to~25-30% that was chloride-dependent and partially sensitive to GlyH-101 and; (3) a third accounting for~50% of the total killing activity that was not sensitive to oxidant inhibitors, or extracellular chloride concentration. DPI and ABAH had no effect on killing of PA in the absence of extracellular chloride suggesting that most of the oxidant-mediated killing activity toward PA was due to HOCl. None of the inhibitors had any significant effect on phagocytosis. Finally, the rate of PA killing by CF neutrophils was found to be significantly lower (30-40 %) than that seen for normal neutrophils and was comparable to the effect of GlyH-101 on killing of PA by normal neutrophils. The data suggest that CFTR plays a significant role in killing of PA by normal neutrophils and, when defective as in CF, may compromise the ability of neutrophils to efficiently kill PA. This research was supported by a CFF grant to GW. 1%. The CF group demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of Pseudomonas respiratory infections than the non-CF group. Interestingly, no significant differences were detected in any infections from other systems including blood, sinuses, skin, wounds, oral cavity, bowel, eyes, peritoneal cavity, and urinary tract. Moreover, the CF lung-transplant patients had significantly less time free from Pseudomonas infections in the transplanted lungs.",

            "text": "CONCLUSION Normal lungs transplanted into CF patients had significantly higher susceptibility to Pseudomonas infections than those transplanted into non-CF patients, which strongly suggests that defective host defense mechanism(s) beyond the respiratory system contribute to CF lung pathogenesis. Pyocyanin (N-methyl-1-hydroxyphenazine, PCN) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is found in pulmonary secretions of infected CF patients at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M. PCN is a redox-active compound that generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of cellular reductants. Since CFTR was reported to be modulated by H 2 O 2 , we hypothesized that PCN, through its ability to redox cycle and to produce H 2 O 2 , would affect CFTR-mediated Cl transport. We therefore tested PCN and H 2 O 2 for effects on Cltransport (transepithelial short-circuit currents in Ussing chambers measured with serosal-to-mucosal Clgradient) and cytosolic redox potential (imaging microscopy on cells transfected with a redox sensitive GFP, roGFP1) using CFTR-corrected CF bronchial epithelial cells (wtCFTR6. . Under resting conditions, acute exposure of the apical epithelial surface to 100 \u00b5M PCN elicited a small Clsecretory response (7.3\u00b10.9 \u00b5A/cm 2 , n=10) that was completely blocked by the CFTR inhibitor GlyH101 (20 \u00b5M). In contrast, in presence of the cAMP-elevating agonist forskolin, PCN caused a time-dependent decline of forskolin-stimulated CFTR Clcurrents by 86%. Exposure to H 2 O 2 (100 \u00b5M) elicited a more pronounced Clsecretory response than PCN in resting cells and H 2 O 2 -stimulated Clcurrents peaked at 47.4\u00b15.8 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=10). H 2 O 2 was less effective than PCN at inhibiting forskolin-stimulated CFTR Clcurrents and currents declined by 33%. Both PCN and H 2 O 2 oxidized the cytosolic redox potential from a resting value of -270 mV by similar amounts (48\u00b18 mV for PCN vs. 44\u00b110 mV for H 2 O 2 ), but rates of oxidation were faster for H 2 O 2 (2.5\u00b10.1 mV/min) than for PCN (1.1\u00b10.2 mV/min). Inhibition of cAMP-stimulated CFTR Clcurrents by oxidation was a linear function of the cytosolic redox potential, but PCN (2 \u00b5A\u00d7cm -2 \u00d7mV -1 ) was more potent than H 2 O 2 (0.69 \u00b5A\u00d7cm -2 \u00d7mV -1 ). CF bronchial epithelial cells homozygous for \u2206F508-CFTR did not show a Clsecretory response to PCN or H 2 O 2 . These data suggest that CFTR-corrected CF bronchial epithelial cells respond acutely to oxidative stress by turning on CFTR activity probably as part of the innate host defense response and this mechanism is absent in CF airways. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to PCN and H 2 O 2 is detrimental for the proper function of the cAMP-regulated CFTR Clconductance. We conclude that oxidative stress in P. aeruginosa-infected airways is a key factor that needs to be considered for successfully correcting CFTR function in CF airways.",

            "text": "Supported by NIH (NCCAM P01 AT002620), CFF (Fischer07G0) The lung is continually exposed to environmental agents and pathogens. The lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) is first to encounter these agents and GSH is a major antioxidant found in this apical fluid. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) is the only known GSH transporter that maintains lung ELF GSH levels. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patient have low levels of GSH in their ELF and have copious and viscous mucus. Hypertonic saline is used in CF patient to help clear mucous and improve lung function however the mechanism(s) by which it does so are poorly understood. The purpose of these studies was to examine whether hypertonic (3.0%) saline can modulate apical GSH levels and protect lung epithelial cells against the oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). We used human lung epithelial cell lines sufficient (C38) and deficient (IB3) in CFTR. The CFTR deficient IB3 cells have 40% lower basal levels of apical GSH as compare to CFTR sufficient C38 cells. Cells were exposed separately and in combination to 3% saline, and t-BOOH (100 uM) for 48 hours. The CFTR deficient IB3 cells were much more sensitive to t-BOOH-mediated oxidative injury as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Hypertonic saline exposure was associated with an increase in apical GSH levels in both CFTR sufficient and deficient cells and decreased t-BOOHmediated oxidative injury in both cells lines. Hypertonic saline increased GSH in the apical compartment, which appeared to be largely CFTR mediated. We examined this issue in mice given a clinically used dosing regimen of 7% hypertonic saline nebulized twice daily and examined changes in ELF GSH levels 12 hours after last treatment. Mice receiving the hypertonic saline treatment had significantly higher GSH levels in their ELF than untreated controls. This data suggests that CFTR and GSH adaptive responses play an important role in lung's reaction to oxidants. We propose that factors, which interfere with the lung's capability to mount and maintain an adequate adaptive apical GSH response, may compromise and sensitize the lung to oxidative injury.

The proinflammatory mediators in the CF airway recruit a large number of polymorphonuclear neukocytes (PMNs), which release high levels of neutrophil elastase and human neutrophil peptides and damage the lungs. The intense neutrophil-dominated inflammatory response associated with chronic PA infection results in progressive airway obstruction, the cause of death of over three-quarters of CF patients.",

We measured the inflammatory response (IL6, IL8, TNF\u03b1) of these cells following stimulation with: (i) CF pathogens (P. aeurginosa, B. multivorans, B. cenocepacia); (ii) purified TLR ligands. Both CF respiratory epithelial cells and CF PBMCs had a greatly increased inflammatory response compared to matched controls when stimulated with whole bacteria and purified TLR ligands (P<0.05). Interestingly, the CF airway cells responded most vigorously to the TLR5 ligand, flagellin (P<0.001). To investigate TLR5 as a potential anti-inflammatory target, we found that TLR5 mRNA (P<0.001) and protein (P<0.05) were expressed at a higher level in CF compared to CF-corrected lung epithelial cells.

Background: Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading genetic causes of end stage lung disease for which the treatment is lung transplantation. However, mortality due to chronic rejection known as obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) remains high due to small airway obliteration. OB is associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), an interstitial collagenase, expressed by polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). PMNs are among the first inflammatory cells to be detected in OB but very little is known about the role of PMN MMP-8 or the mechanisms used by PMNs to migrate through extracellular collagen matrices. Objective: To identify the molecular mechanism for neutrophil recruitment into the airway. We hypothesize that MMP-8 promotes accumulation of PMNs in OB lesions by promoting their migration through the extracellular matrix protein barriers by its pericellular collagenase activity. Method: The heterotopic airway transplant model was used to study the role of neutrophil MMP-8 in promoting PMN migration through extracellular matrices. MHC-disparate Balb/c tracheas were subcutaneously transplanted into C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) or MMP-8 deficient (MMP-8-/-) mice. To further dissect the mechanism of PMN migration in vitro their migration through collagen gels was studied. Collagen gels were made in transwells using rat-tail collagen providing a highly cross-linked thick collagen barrier. Bone marrow derived PMNs from WT or MMP8 -/-mice were fluorescently labeled and stimulated to induce the surface expression of MMP-8. PMNs were placed on thick collagen gels in traswells. The transwells had polycarbonate membranes at the bottom of the gels. The pore size of the membranes did not allow PMNs to pass through into the lower chambers that had fLMP a chemo attractant. At 4 hours and 24 hours the gels were fixed and the polycarbonate membrane at the bottom of the collagen gel was gently peeled off. PMNs on the membrane were counted under a fluorescent microscope. Results: Significantly decreased migration of PMNs into the airway lumen was noted in the MMP-8 deficient mice (P<0.05) 2 weeks post-transplantation compared to WT mice in the heterotopic airway transplant model. In addition there was more than a three-fold increase in the PMNs outside the lumen in the extracellular collagen matix (P<0.02). WT-PMNs were able to penetrate collagen barriers in greater numbers both at 4 and 24 hours compared to MMP8 -/-PMNs in vitro (P < 0.002 for 4 hours and 0.001 for 24 hours). In addition, MMP inhibitor GM 6001-treated WT cells demonstrated decreased migration through collagen gels (4 hours P<0.008 and 24 hours P<0.008). Conclusions: MMP-8 -/-mice has significantly less PMNs in the airway lumen due to decreased migration through collagen matrices providing protection against OB. This has great significance for conditions such as cystic fibrosis, lung transplant rejection (obliterative bronchiolitis) and other inflammatory diseases mediated by PMNs. MMP-8 blockade can potentially be a novel therapeutic target to decrease neutrophil efflux into the airways and thus reduce airway inflammation. Background: Our laboratory has demonstrated alterations in CF-related regulation of cholesterol processing. Hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols) are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol formed from autoxidation of cholesterol and from de novo synthesis. Oxysterols are known to be key regulators of cholesterol metabolism and cellular signaling. The role of oxysterols in the cellular pathways involved in cholesterol processing in cystic fibrosis has not been elucidated. Based on our previous findings of increased de novo cholesterol synthesis in CF tissues, we hypothesize that oxysterol production in CF would be positively impacted. Increased oxysterol production may lead to abnormalities in cellular signaling associated with oxidative stress and may influence the inflammatory response in CF. The goals of this research are to investigate the effect of oxysterols on inflammation in CF and to determine if there is a difference in oxysterol production in CF compared to wild type controls.",

Initial studies demonstrate that CF-model 9/HTEo-pCEPR cells failed to respond to 25-OH cholesterol (25-OH) with regards to NF\u03baB activation. Control 9/HTEO-pCEP cells, however, exhibited a significant 2-fold increase in NF\u03baB activity upon 25-OH stimulation (2.1-fold +/-0.1 increase from IL-1, TNF alpha alone). However, IL-8 promoter activation in response to 25-OH was not significantly altered in either CF or wt cells (2.5-fold +/-2.3 (CF) increase from IL-1, TNF alpha alone, 1.8-fold +/-2.3 (wt) increase from IL-1, TNF alpha alone). In order to verify IL-8 promoter results, IL-8 protein production was measured directly in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IL-8 protein level in response to 25-OH was increased in CF cells (1.4-fold) and decreased in wt cells (1.2-fold), although not significantly in either group. Oxysterol content and de novo synthesis are currently being examined in vivo in CF and wild type mouse models.

Interestingly, although oxysterols robustly activate NF\u03baB in wt cells, oxysterol-dependent pathways are not involved in IL-8 production. These data suggest that IL-8 is not a primary cause for increased oxysterol mediated inflammation.

This work is supported by grants from the CFF and the NHLBI. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the CFTR, a chloride transporter of the ABC transporter family. Innate immunity, the first line in host defense against infectious agents, is abnormal in CF patients. CF patients are commonly colonized with bacterial pathogens, which is the major clinical problem of this disease. Despite a marked difference in the clinical outcome amongst CF patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, the mechanisms under-lying these differences remain unclear. Understanding the innate immune response, specifically the role of CFTR, in P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia infections will lead to new insights into mechanisms that limit these infections.",

Our experiments have demonstrated that, when compared to growth on their natural food source, E.coli OP50, worms fed on PA14 and BC die prematurely. Specifically, worms survive up to 140 hours on OP50, whereas PA14 fed worms die with in 40 hours. Death on PA14 also requires active infection, as heat inactivation of these bacteria destroys their killing capacity. Two BC strains have been tested, a virulent strain (25416) and an avirulent strain (17616). Worms infected with BC show an intermediate phenotype, surviving approximately 100 hours. Our future work will define whether synergy occurs during coinfection with P.aeruginosa and B.cepacia, as would be suggested by clinical data.

            "text": "Supported Serine proteases released from neutrophils are considered central to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, and have been obvious therapeutic targets. Although intracellular serine proteases are important in host defense and bacterial killing, extracellular enzymes may contribute to bacterial persistence and promote airway inflammation. Neutrophil elastase (NE) digests key opsonins present in the lung and has been shown to disrupt phagocytosis, allowing the bacteria to persist in the face of established pulmonary inflammation. In addition we have found that other proteases, like cathepsin G (CG), an abundant serine protease found in human and murine neutrophils, may also have other, critical roles in development of CF lung disease. Indeed, using murine models of endobronchial inflammation, CG inhibits airway defenses and interferes with the host's ability to clear Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the lung with effects quite distinct from NE. To test the hypothesis that differences in bacterial killing are due to defects in innate defenses created by excess, unopposed CG at the apical surface of the airway epithelium, we have examined profiles of proteins secreted into the airway lumen by epithelial cells, which are necessary for P. aeruginosa clearance and susceptible to CG proteolysis. Analysis of lavage fluid utilizing 2-D PAGE indicated a total of 88 spots which were increased in pooled lavage fluid from 6 infected CG-deficient mice as compared to 6 wild-type littermates. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified several novel proteins that were cleaved by CG, including inter-alpha inhibitor protein, selenium-binding protein, SEC14-like protein, beta-2-glycoprotein, and Annexin A5. Another protein candidate, serum amyloid P component (SAP), is a novel opsonin and may be involved in airway defenses. Immunoblot analy-sis demonstrates that CG cleaves SAP. These results suggest that CG, like NE, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. We have previously demonstrated in \u2206F508-CF mice that in vivo treatment with azithromycin (AZM) attenuates cellular infiltration in baseline and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, and inhibits proinflammatory cytokine release in induced inflammatory condition (Legssyer et al, 2006) .",

J. Resp. Cell. Mol Biology, 2007] . Since both evidence support a direct link between CFTR function and inflammatory response in respiratory epithelial cells, we extended our investigation to other F508del CFTR correctors, such as miglustat [Norez et al, FEBS letters, 2006] , which is an approved drug for Gaucher disease, in comparison with an isomer without any correcting effect, namely NB-DGJ. Human bronchial IB3-1 (CFTR F508del/W1282X), CuFi-1 (CFTR F508del/F508del) and NuLi-1 (CFTR w/t) cells were exposed to the laboratory strain of P.aeruginosa (PAO1) or TNF-alpha or IL-1beta and the transcription of ICAM-1 and IL-8 were quantitated by real time RT PCR. CFTR function was assayed by single-cell fluorescence imaging, using the potential-sensitive probe DiSBAC2 [Renier et al, Hum. Gene Ther. 1994 ]. Analysis of binding of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors to labelled DNA target was performed with Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) [Borgatti et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2003 ]. Miglustat significantly reduced the expression of IL-8 by 90% in IB3-1 and by 70% in CuFi-1 cells and of ICAM-1 by 80% in IB3-1 and by 50% in CuFi-1 cells, upon infection by PAO1. In parallel, correction of F508del CFTR function was observed after miglustat treatment in both IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells. Miglustat had no major effects on overall binding activity of transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1, activated by PAO1 in IB3-1cells. The inflammatory response induced by TNF-alpha or IL-1beta was also significantly reduced in IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells treated with miglustat. NB-DGJ, which is not a corrector of function of F508del CFTR, down modulated the induction of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells. In addition, both miglustat and NB-DGJ reduced the inflammatory response to PAO1 in non CF NuLi-1 cells. In conclusion, miglustat and NB-DGJ have an anti-inflammatory effect in bronchial cells independently of the correction of F508del CFTR, by interfering with the pro-inflammatory signaling downstream the receptors for pathogens and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Since miglustat is already approved for the treatment of Gaucher disease and other glycosphingolipidoses, it may be an interesting candidate to ameliorate lung inflammation in CF patients. Background: The primary cause of mortality and morbidity in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is lung disease, which is characterized as a chronic cycle of infection and inflammation dominated by a neutrophilic infiltrate and increased levels of circulating mediators such as IL-8. A wide variation in the rate of progression of lung disease is observed in CF.",

Overexpression of the epithelial Na + channel \u03b2 subunit (protein = \u03b2ENaC, gene = Scnn1b) in transgenic mice results in CF-like lung pathology, characterized by neonatal mortality, mucus obstruction and airway inflammation (Mall et al., Nat. Med. 2004) . Breeding \u03b2ENaC mice into gene-deleted mice enables quick and efficient determination of the specific pathways relevant to the development of lung pathology. TNF\u03b1 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine released by many different cell types, including T cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and epithelial cells. TNF\u03b1 levels are significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from \u03b2ENaC mice in comparison to wild-type (WT) littermates. We crossbred \u03b2ENaC mice (heterozygous, inbred line C57-6608) with TNF\u03b1 knockout mice, generating four types of mice: WT, TNF\u03b1 +/-; WT, TNF\u03b1 -/-; \u03b2ENaC, TNF\u03b1 +/-; and \u03b2ENaC, TNF\u03b1 -/-. All mice had comparable, high survival, ranging between 80-90%. The lack of TNF\u03b1 did not prevent neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration and did not significantly modify the lung pathology characteristic of \u03b2ENaC mice, namely mucus plugs, mucous secretory cell hyperplasia, airway inflammation and emphysema. The absence of TNF\u03b1 in BAL from \u03b2ENaC, TNF\u03b1 -/-mice, in comparison to \u03b2ENaC, TNF\u03b1 +/mice, was confirmed by Luminex cytokine assay. The levels of KC, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, were significantly elevated in BAL fluid from \u03b2ENaC mice, regardless of the presence or absence of TNF\u03b1. In WT mice, no granulocytic infiltrate or morphologic changes were observed and TNF\u03b1 and KC were undetectable. Similarly, the pathologic changes in \u03b2ENaC mice were not mitigated by crossbreeding to knockout mice for TNF\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNF\u03b1R1), the major mediator of biologic responses classically attributed to TNF\u03b1. These results suggest that TNF\u03b1 per se does not have a critical pro-inflammatory role in the development of inflammation in the \u03b2ENaC mouse model. The production of alternative cytokines may compensate for the loss of TNF\u03b1 bioactivity in the TNF\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1R1 -/-mice.",

These data suggest that a TNF\u03b1-independent signaling cascade links airway surface dehydration to airway inflammation in the \u03b2ENaC mouse model. Innovative pharmacological approaches to control the excessive neutrophil infiltrates into the bronchial lumen of CF patients are thought to be beneficial to reduce the extensive airway tissue damage. The activation of expression of proinflammatory genes by P.aeruginosa with bronchial epithelial cells is a central mechanism to be targeted with novel therapies. Medicinal plants from the socalled traditional Asian medicine are attracting a growing interest because of their potential safety, already tested in large scale applications in human diseases. However, due to the presence of different active principles in each plant extract, whose multifunctional effects may even result contradictory, understanding the effect of each component is mandatory to pursue selective and reproducible applications. A panel of medicinal plant extracts have been firstly screened for their capacity to interfere in the binding of nuclear transcription factor proteins (TF) with DNA consensus sequences identified in the promoters of the pro-inflammatory genes, thus for their potential inhibitory action on gene expression. Extracts from several medicinal plants have been screened for their ability to interfere with the TF NF-kB, AP-1 and CREB, which are induced by P.aeruginosa, and some of them, such as Emblica officinalis (EO), Aegle marmelos (AM), Polyalthia longifolia (PL), have been shown to inhibit TF/DNA interactions, opening the possibility of potential applications to downregulate expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Extracts from EO, AM, PL were tested in IB3-1 CF bronchial cells exposed to the P.aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1. EO, AM and PL strongly inhibited the PAO1-dependent transcription of IL-8 in IB3-1 cells. Pyrogallol, one active principle of EO, was tested in IB3-1 cells, where it inhibited the transcription of the neutrophil chemokines IL-8, GRO-alpha and gamma, of the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule ICAM-1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6, similarly to the whole EO extract, whereas a second active principle from EO, namely 5hydroxy-isoquinoline, had no effect. Similar results were obtained with EO and pyrogallol in the monocyte-derived macrophage cell line THP-1 exposed to PAO1. In conclusion, extracts from plants of the traditional medicine can inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory genes and screening active principles purified from medicinal plants could result useful to identify safe and innovative pharmaceutical molecules to control lung inflammation in the lung of CF patients.",

Massive infiltrates of neutrophils in the mucosal wall and lumen of the conductive airways of CF patients contribute to the progressive lung func-tion decline by releasing different proteases responsible for the progressive airway tissue damage. Bacterial products and pathogens themselves within the mucopurulent material of the airway surface fluid induce the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, AP-1, Sp1, NF-IL6, NF-AT, Elk-1, CREB resulting in expression of chemo/cytokine genes driving the recruitment of leukocytes inside the bronchial lumen. To find new treatment options focused on the reduction of neutrophil chemotaxis, without abolishing the immune response against pathogens, we are exploring the transcription factor (TF) \"decoy\" strategy, in which oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) mimicking the consensus sequences for the TFs proteins identified in the promoters of different chemo/cytokines are delivered inside the cell in order to interfere with gene transcription. CF bronchial epithelial cells IB3-1 have been exposed to the (i)P.aeruginosa(/i) strain PAO1. A clear PAO1-dependent activation of TFs such as NF-\u03baB, Sp1, AP-1, NF-AT, NF-IL6 was confirmed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). In parallel, transcription of genes involved in innate immune response has been quantified by real-time RT PCR. Transcription factor \"decoy\" ODNs directed against the consensus sequences identified in the promoters of different genes have been designed and validated by testing their interference in TF protein/DNA binding assays. Transfection of IB3-1 cells with HIV-1 LTR and IgK chain NF-\u03baB ODN \"decoys\" complexed with Lipofectamine, performed 30 hrs before challenge with PAO1, was shown previously to inhibit strongly PAO1-dependent transcription of IL-8 but not GRO, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and ICAM-1. Therefore other TF \"decoy\" ODNs have been also tested: a) ODN for NF-\u03baB from IL-8 promoter inhibited IL-8, GRO-gamma and IL-6 by 50%, b) ODN for Sp1 from HIV-1 genome inhibited IL-6 by 50%, c) ODN for AP-1 from IL-8 promoter inhibited both IL-8 and GRO-gamma by 50%. A TF \"decoy\" molecule designed as peptide-DNA chimera mimicking the consensus sequence of HIV LTR NF-\u03baB strongly and selectively inhibited IL-8 transcription. In conclusion, transcription of chemo/cytokines induced by (i)P.aeruginosa(/i) in CF bronchial epithelial cells (i)in vitro(/i) can be inhibited with different efficiency and selectivity by TF \"decoy\" molecules. These results provide useful hints for a gene-targeted anti-inflammatory approach and add further information on the regulation of expression of pro-inflammatory genes induced by (i)P.aeruginosa(/i) in bronchial epithelial cells.",

Background: CF is characterized by hypersecretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 from airway epithelial cells. However the mechanism by which IL-8 gene expression is dysregulated in CF is not known. The expression of cytokine and chemokine genes is known to be regulated at multiple mechanistic steps including transcription, mRNA decay, translation, and various post-translational steps. Sequence-specific mRNA degradation is now recognized to be an important site controlling the expression of several chemokine mRNAs. This selective behavior is conferred by cisacting elements in the mRNA composed of AU-rich sequences (AREs). The regulatory function of AREs is thought to be mediated via RNA-binding proteins that specifically recognize the ARE motifs. The steps required for mRNA decay is comprised of deadenylation, decapping and body decay. Deadenylation or removal of the poly (A) tail by poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) appears to be the first and perhaps the rate-limiting step. This is accompanied by decapping or enzymatic removal of the 5' methylate guanosine cap. Subsequently, exonuclease activities in the 5' to 3' or 3' to 5' direction predominate to degrade the remaining mRNA.",

Consistently, the actual levels of IL-8 mRNA are higher in the CF cells compared to controls. Understanding the mechanism by which TTP promotes enhanced destabilization of IL-8 mRNA in CF cells may be important for developing novel therapeutic targets to alleviate the pulmonary pathophysiology of this disease manifested by hyper-secretion of IL-8 protein. Understanding the mechanism of airway remodeling could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of irreversible lung damage in CF. We have investigated transcriptional responses to epithelial injury in a mouse model of CF that was developed in our laboratory (F508del, Cftr tm1EUR FVB backcross F12). To induce transient epithelial lung injury, homozygous normal and mutant age matched littermates were treated in parallel with Naphthalene (200 mg/kg IP) or carrier (corn oil) as control (N= 4x12). Naphthalene causes an almost complete selective ablation of CLARA cells overnight, followed by migration of resistant ciliated cells and rapid proliferation of undifferentiated progenitor cells. Two and seven days after treatment, lungs were collected for histological and transcriptome analysis. Based on a previous Affymetrix microarray analysis (N=6), a quantitative PCR array was designed containing 56 genes differentially expressed after naphthalene injury. As expected, naphthalene injury results in a transient increase of cell proliferation markers (Mki67, Cdc20, Cdc2a etc), and a strong (90%) reduction of CLARA cell markers (CC10/Scgb1a1; Claudin10/Cldn10; Cyp2f2). In addition, we have now identified twenty-five genes that are increased (P< 0.001) two-to fifty-fold after naphthalene injury in both normal and mutant mice. This includes known and novel markers of epithelial tissue injury such as Timp1, Retlna, Mmp8, Serpin3n, and Lipocalin. In particular, a group of EGF receptor agonists is strongly induced: Amphiregulin (Areg, 13 fold), Epiregulin (Ereg 50 fold) and Heparin binding EGF (3 fold). Amphiregulin mRNA can be detected by in situ hybridization only in airway epithelial cells after injury. These EGFR agonists are involved in stimulating epithelial repair, but can also activate cells in the underlying mesenchyma. Indeed, we observe a substantial increase of major extracellular matrix mRNA's two days after injury (Co1a1: 5-fold, Col3a1: 10-fold, Elastin: 3-fold). Whereas expression levels were substantially reduced in normal animals seven days after injury, in CF mutant animals two to three fold higher levels were observed for these three genes at day seven (P<0.04). CONCLUSIONS. We have designed and validated a gene array that can be used to study distal lung injury and repair. EGFR agonists produced by epithelial cells are the most prominent growth factors after injury, involved in both epithelial repair and extracellular matrix production by mesenchymal cells. ECM production in CF mouse lung is sustained compared to normal mice, suggesting an inherent tendency towards fibrosis in CF lungs. Our data suggest that the mesenchymal EGF receptor and regulation of its agonists are important future targets of novel therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "Supported by EEC 6th FW projects EUROCARECF, IMPROVED PRECISION The mucosa of the proximal airways defends itself and the lower airways from inhaled irritants, allergens, and microbial and viral infections by several mechanisms. Sensory nerves monitor the luminal microenvironment and trigger reflexes in the central nervous system (CNS) that alter breathing, induce cough and stimulate mucus secretion when challenged with noxious stimuli. Sensory nerves also release the tachykinins substance P (SP), neurokinin A and calcitonin gene-related peptide through axon reflexes in neighboring tissues, and these locally released tachykinins stimulate mucus secretion by binding to neurokinin 1 receptors on submucosal glands. Recently we reported that local fluid secretory responses to noxious stimuli are dependent on the Clchannel CFTR in mouse airway submucosal glands and are defective in glands from CFTR knockout mice (Ianowski et al., J Physiol, 2007, 580, 301) . We have now tested the effects of SP directly and examined the possible role of CFTR in mediating these responses using tracheas from congenic wild-type and CFTR knockout mice (Cftr m1UNC /Cftr m1UNC ) that had been bred onto C57BL/6 J or Balb/c genetic backgrounds. We compared single gland secretion rates using optical methods as described previously. The cftr genotype of each mouse was assessed by using PCR to amplify genomic DNA from tail clippings obtained at age 18 days. After the CFTR knockout mice were weaned, intestinal obstruction was minimized by supplementing their water with Peglite. Capsaicinoids (chili pepper oil) increased fluid secretion from glands of wild-type mice from 10 \u00b1 2 pl/min (n=9 tracheas, 17 glands) to 50 \u00b1 10 pl/min (n=4 tracheas, 9 glands, Anova p<0.05, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test p<0.05). This response was abolished by exposing the basolateral surface of the tracheas to L-732,138 (10 \u00b5mol/l), a known SP (NK-1) receptor antagonist (15 \u00b1 5 pl/min, not different from control, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test p>0.05). Secretion was stimulated from 4 \u00b1 1 pl/min to 100 \u00b1 30 pl/min (n=12 tracheas, 55 glands, Student's t-test p<0.05) by the direct application of SP, and this response was strongly inhibited by pre-incubation with the CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh172 (saturating concentration, nominal 100 \u00b5mol/l; n=6 tracheas, 21 glands). Finally, submucosal glands from CFTR knockout mice failed to secrete when exposed to SP (1 \u00b5mol/l) whereas wild-type littermates were responsive. These results indicate that SP mediates local responses to capsaicinoids through a CFTR-dependent mechanism. Loss of this local regulation in CF may contribute to the susceptibility of CF airways. Support: Canadian CF Foundation, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, NIH (DK51817), and the CFF (USA). Chronically infected/inflamed CF human bronchial epithelia (HBE), or normal HBE exposed to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from human CF airways, exhibit expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ stores and amplification of Ca 2+ -mediated inflammatory responses. We have shown that infection/inflammation of HBE triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) coupled to mRNA splicing of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Spliced XBP-1 (XBP-1s) is a transcription factor that promotes ER expansion to augment the protein folding capacity during increased protein synthesis. Because we have shown that HBE inflammation couples to increases in protein synthesis, we hypothesized that HBE infection/inflammation-induced ER Ca 2+ store expansion is mediated by XBP-1s. To test this hypothesis, we constructed four retrovirally-tranduced stable 16HBE14o-cell lines containing empty vector (EV), XBP-1 unspliced (XBP-1u), XBP-1s, or dominant negative XBP-1 (DN-XBP-1). Cells were grown to confluence under an air-liquid interface and ER Ca 2+ store expansion and IL-8 secretion studied in the absence or following 24 hr mucosal PBS or SMM exposure. Consistent with our hypothesis, expression of XBP-1s in the absence of stimulation induced ER expansion and increased mucosal UTP-sensitive ER Ca 2+ stores ( To confirm that these effects were mediated by UPR activation, cells were transfected with a UPR response element luciferase reporter plasmid, and luciferase activity was measured in the absence or presence of the UPR inducer tunicamycin (TM). Cells expressing XBP-1s exhibited higher baseline luciferase activity than cells expressing EV or XBP-1u, whereas luciferase activity was decreased in the DN-XBP-1 expressing cells. Furthermore, while TM increased luciferase activity in cultures expressing EV or XBP-1u, its effect was blocked in DN-XBP-1 expressing cells. These findings suggest that XBP-1s is the major trigger of ER Ca 2+ store expansion, which mediates the amplified Ca 2+ -dependent inflammatory response in infected/inflamed airway epithelia. Although it remains to be established whether UPR-dependent XBP-1s is a beneficial or a maladaptive response in infected/inflamed airways, therapies aimed at manipulating this UPR pathway may be beneficial for patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Luminal exposure of well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelia (HBE) to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from human CF airways increases the secretion of inflammatory mediators and triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by the mRNA splicing of the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Spliced XBP-1 (XBP-1s) is a transcription factor that expands the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and protein secretory pathway during ER stress induced by accumulation of unfolded proteins due to increases in protein synthesis. Our previous studies in primary cultures of HBE and 16HBE14o-cells stably expressing empty vector, inactive unspliced XBP-1 (XBP-1u), XBP-1s or a dominant negative XBP-1 (DN-XBP-1) suggest that induction of XBP-1s by SMM exposure promotes ER Ca 2+ store expansion, which mediates a Ca 2+ -dependent hyperinflammatory response. The present studies were designed to determine if Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK strain (P.a.) would reproduce the effects of SMM in both in vitro and, importantly, in vivo models. For in vitro studies, HBE were exposed to broth (TSB) or to a 20% P.a. extract for 24 hr, and inflammation, XBP-1s, and ER Ca 2+ store expansion investigated by IL-8 secretion, Southern blots and calreticulin expression, respectively. Similar to SMM, P.a. induced a 4.5 fold increase in IL-8 secretion coupled to a 2 fold increase in XBP-1s and larger ER Ca 2+ stores as compared with TSBexposed HBE. These data demonstrate the link between P.a. infection, UPR activation and XBP-1s in vitro. We next tested the relevance of these findings in vivo. Wild-type mice airways were challenged with PBS or 10 6 cfu of P.a., and airway epithelial ER density was assessed by calreticulin staining 24 hr later. In comparison with PBS challenges, P.a.-challenged mice exhibited airway epithelial ER expansion, which correlated with the degree of airway inflammation, based on the presence of inflammatory cells. To test whether this P.a.-induced ER expansion was linked to XBP-1s, we utilized \"ER stress activated indicator\" (ERAI) mice expressing a fusion protein consisting of XBP-1u and the fluorescent protein Venus. In ERAI mice, UPR activation-dependent XBP-1 splicing leads to Venus expression; hence, Venus fluorescence is an index of XBP-1s. Consistent with our hypothesis that P.a. infection-triggered inflammation would induce UPR-dependent XBP-1s, Venus fluorescence, after 24 hr challenge with 10 6 cfu of P.a., was increased in inflamed as compared with non-inflamed airways. These findings suggest that 1) airway epithelia respond to bacterial infection-induced inflammation by up-regulating the ER Ca 2+ stores and 2) activation of the XBP-1s pathway by bacterial infection may be relevant to airway inflammatory responses in vivo.

            "text": "We have shown that luminal exposure of well-differentiated primary cultures of normal human bronchial epithelia (HBE) to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from human CF airways increases total cellular protein synthesis, which reflects the increased secretion of inflammatory factors induced by the infectious and inflammatory process. In the present studies, we first investigated whether these HBE responses to SMM were linked with an increased metabolic rate by measuring lactate accumulation into the serosal media. SMM increased lactate production, and this effect was maximal within 24 hrs (9.0+1.0 vs. 13.2+0.8, and 7.1+0.9 vs. 13.1+0. 4 mmol/L in 24 and 48 hr PBS vs. SMM, respectively; n=5-10), suggesting that the increase in protein synthesis couples to a hyper-metabolic state in infected/inflamed HBE. In agreement with this notion, 6 or 24 hr SMM, as compared with PBS exposure, induced the expression of genes associated with amino acid transport and metabolism (n=4). In addition, 6 or 24 hr SMM exposure up-regulated genes involved in oxidative stress (n=4). We hypothesized that these HBE responses were linked to an unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by activation of the PKR-like ER kinase/pancreatic eIF2\u03b1 kinase (PERK)-induced activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), since this pathway has been shown to confer protection against amino acid loss and oxidative stress in other cells. We first tested whether SMM induced activation of PERK/ATF4 in HBE by performing Western blot analyzes of the components of this pathway. Twenty-four hr SMM exposure induced PERK activation, as indexed by phosphorylation of PERK, in comparison with PBS-exposed HBE. On the other hand, total PERK protein levels were unchanged in SMM-treated HBE. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, the downstream effector of PERK, and increased ATF4 protein levels, which depend on the phosphorylated status of eIF2\u03b1, provided additional evidence that the PERK/ATF4 pathway was activated by SMM. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that induction of ATF4 is triggered by UPR activation resulting from increased synthesis of inflammatory factors. We next utilized RNA microarrays to test whether ATF4 target genes were induced by SMM. Six or 24 hr SMM exposure induced ATF4 target genes (e.g., ERO1, an oxido-reductase that provides protection against the accumulation of endogenous peroxides during ER stress; stanniocalcin 2, whose expression is associated with anti-apoptotic functions; and heme oxygenase 1). These findings suggest that 1) activation of the UPR-dependent ATF4 pathway is a compensatory component of the airway epithelial adaptive response to luminal infection/inflammation, and 2) activation of the ATF4 pathway protects against inflammation-induced amino acid loss and oxidative stress by up-regulating genes involved in amino acid transport/metabolism and oxidative stress responses. Unraveling the functions of ATF4 should help determine if therapies targeted to manipulate pathway activity would be likely to improve lung function in patients with CF or other chronic inflammatory airway diseases.

            "text": "Miller, T.J.; Perez, A.; Qian, Y.; Davis, P. Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA FXYD5 is a cell surface protein originally identified in a screen for molecular markers of tumorigenesis. Increased FXYD5 expression was found in tumors from stomach, thyroid, colon, pancreatic, breast and lung cancers and correlated with down-regulation of E-cadherin and poor patient prognosis. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of FXYD5 promotes cell motility, decreases cell-cell attachment and increases tumor metastasis. FXYD5, also known as Dysadherin, is a member of small family of proteins known to regulate the Na,K-ATPase. We now report that FXYD5 is upregulated in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelia and modulates wound healing. We show by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analyses that FXYD5 is increased in the lungs of S489X CF mice, and demonstrate an almost 3-fold increase in FXYD5 expression in the nasal epithelia of CF mice compared to wild-type littermates (P<0.001). Furthermore, we show that FXYD5 is upregulated in nasal scrapings from human CF patients compared to controls (P<0.02). Immunofluorescence data show that Flag-tagged FXYD5 co-localizes with the Na,K-ATPase in epithelial cells, suggesting that FXYD5, similar to other members of the FXYD family, may regulate Na,K-ATPase function. It has previously been shown that expression and localization of the Na,K-ATPase is required for efficient polarization and suppression of cell motility in epithelial cells. The recurrent remodeling of pulmonary epithelium as a result of bacterial infection in CF requires that airway epithelial cells polarize and migrate to wound sites in order to maintain lung integrity. Thus we hypothesized that FXYD5 may be involved in wound healing after infection. Laser-capture microdissection and microarray analysis of murine lung epithelia after 3 hours treatment with P. aeruginosa indicated a significant, 5-fold increase in expression of FXYD5 that was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Others have shown that FXYD5 may mediate expression of MCP-1, a critical determinant in monocyte recruitment, through activation of the NF-kB pathway. Treatment of human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cells with a CFTR inhibitor (172) confirmed that loss of CFTR function correlated with increased FXYD5 expression by quantitative RT-PCR (P<0.001), an effect that was abrogated with treatment of PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-kB (P<0.01). We speculated that FXYD5-induced increases in cell motility may be due in part to phosphorylation at serine 163. In a murine airway epithelial cell wound healing model, serine to alanine (S163A) mutations at serine 163 inhibited wound healing compared to wild type FXYD5 overexpression, whereas aspartic acid (S163D) mutations increased wound healing (P<0.005). Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses of these mutants suggest phosphorylation at Ser163 regulates membrane localization. We conclude that FXYD5 is increased in cystic fibrosis epithelia due to increased inflammatory mediators and suggest that FXYD5 may modulate airway epithelia wound healing after infection with P. aeruginosa through phosphorylation at Ser163. The inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the CF airway is exaggerated compared to normal, leading to the accumulation of millions of necrotic neutrophils. Extracellular neutrophil elastase (NE) activity in the CF airway not only compromises innate defences by cleaving opsonins and reducing ciliary activity, but amplifies the inflammatory response by stimulating expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 and increases mucus production, in addition to degrading the tissue matrix leading to fatal bronchiectasis. NE therefore represents an important target for the development of new therapies. However, this strategy requires consideration of the normal physiological function of this enzyme, since previous studies in knock-out mice indicated an essential role for NE in cell migration, bacterial phagocytosis and killing.",

CF BAL was characterized by an abundance of neutrophils (837 x 10 3 /ml vs. 3 x 10 3 /ml in controls, p<0.0001) with moderate numbers of lymphocytes (48 x 10 3 /ml vs. 3 x 10 3 /ml in controls, p<0.001). In contrast, CF subepithelial tissue was characterized by a lymphocytic infiltrate (961 cells/mm 2 vs. 575 cells/mm 2 , p<0.01) with only very few neutrophils (12 cells/mm 2 vs. 0 cell/mm 2 , p<0.05). The lymphocytic infiltrate in CF consisted mainly of T lymphocytes (91%). Eosinophil counts in subepithelial tissue did not differ between CF and controls. For all cell types, there was no correlation between counts in BAL and counts in subepithelial tissue. Conclusions: In contrast to the neutrophil-dominated inflammation in the airway lumen, CF is characterized by a lymphocytic inflammation in the airway mucosa. The lymphocytic infiltrate consists mainly of T lymphocytes, the pathophysiological function of which may be important and is being investigated in future work. Support: ERS long-term fellowship and Swiss National Foundation grant to NR The epithelium serves as a barrier to the penetration of foreign antigens, particles, and infectious agents across the airway. The integrity of this barrier is dependent, in part, upon the apical junctional complex consisting of the tight junction (TJ) and the adherens junction. Alterations in TJ permeability have been linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and this increased intestinal permeability may actually precede the onset of chronic inflammation. In cystic fibrosis (CF), the airway lumen is filled with high concentrations of inflammatory cells, bacteria, and inflammatory mediators. Since TJ barrier function can be significantly reduced by inflammatory mediators, we hypothesized that measures that enhance airway TJ barrier function will decrease airway responses to the continuous presence of inflammatory mediators in the lumen. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between lung inflammation and epithelial permeability in vivo using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of lung inflammation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS was instilled intratracheally into the lungs of C57Bl/6 mice which were then euthanized at 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Lung inflammation was assessed by total cell counts using a hemacytometer and differential counts by Wrights staining of cytospin preparations of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). LPS increased total cell counts and neutrophil concentrations that peaked at 48 hours after LPS administration, compared to saline controls. Measurements of the proinflammatory murine cytokine KC in BALF, by a cytokine antibody bead technique, showed an increase in murine KC at 48 hr following LPS administration, which correlated with the substantial increase in neutrophil concentration. Changes in lung permeability with inflammation were assessed by ELISA measurements of the levels of serum protein murine albumin in BALF. Correlating with changes in cellular inflammation and murine KC levels, albumin concentration peaked at 48 hr after LPS administration. This increase was subsequently resolved, consistent with the restoration of barrier function. An examination of frozen sections of lung from LPS-treated animals showed a redistribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 consistent with the disruption of barrier function. Since the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in LPS-induced airway inflammation, and an inhibitor of this kinase, SB203580 has been shown to reduce this inflammation, the effect of this inhibitor on barrier function is being investigated. In initial studies, SB203580 appears to reduce total and neutrophil cell counts by 50% in vivo. The effect of SB203580 on murine albumin concentrations in BALF and on TJ protein localization is currently being evaluated. A reduction in these parameters will be used as indices of improved barrier function with SB 203580. These studies will determine whether a reduction in lung inflammation correlates with a restoration of barrier function. The degree of protection provided by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580 could have important implications for inflammatory lung diseases such as CF. Background: Chronic pulmonary inflammation in CF is characterized by a robust neutrophil response associated with airway damage and failure to eliminate the pathogen, P. aeruginosa (PA). PA is a highly adaptable opportunist which quickly develops resistance to antimicrobials. Thus, the development of specific immunotherapy targeting the neutrophil recruitment without ablating the host's immune response to infection or promoting pathogen resistance would be ideal. Our group has identified IL-17 as a prime target for the development of immunotherapy due to the central role that the IL-23/IL-17 proinflammatory axis plays in neutrophil recruitment. However IL-17 does not mediate the early neutrophil recruitment seen in response to infection. Hypothesis: IL-23, acting synergistically with IL-1, is critical to early neutrophil recruitment during pulmonary PA infection. The primary effector cells are the IL-23-producing antigen presenting cells: alveolar macrophages (AMs) and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). Methods: WT and IL-23-deficient mice were infected with PA at 1x10 6 cfu/50ul by intratracheal (IT) inoculation for 3 hours. BAL inflammatory cell counts, and cytokines and chemokines were measured. AM and DC cultures were infected for 3 hours in vitro and supernatant cytokines/chemokines were measured by luminex and ELISA; IL-23 levels were measured by Taqman. These studies were designed to elucidate the role of IL-23 in the early neutrophil peak and define AM-and DC-mediated cytokine/chemokine production. Recombinant murine IL-23, IL-1, and IL-23 + IL-1 were instilled via IT into WT and IL-23-deficient mice. BAL inflammatory cell counts and cytokines/chemokines were measured at 3 hours. These studies were designed to elucidate the role of IL-23 and IL-1 in the early neutrophil peak and define AM-and DC-mediated cytokine and chemokine production. Results: At 3 hours post-infection, IL-23 deficient mice had significantly lower percent neutrophils (p<0.02) and lower MIP1\u03b1, KC, and IL-6 (p<0.001) in the BAL. IL-17 was undetectable. There was no significant difference in bacterial load that could account for these cytokine/chemokine differences. Infected WT AMs elaborated significantly more MIP1a, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-1, G-CSF, IP-10, KC and IL-6 than the IL-23-deficient AMs (p<0.001) and the response was inoculum-dependent (p<0.01). DCs elaborated no IL-1 and exhibited IL-23-dependent differences in Mip-1\u03b1 and MCP-1 production (p<0.05). In vivo studies of IL-23 and IL-1 effect demonstrated a synergistic increase in BAL neutrophil recruitment (p<0.01) and cytokine and chemokine induction (p<0.01). Conclusion: The first wave of neutrophil recruitment seen during PA infection is IL-23-dependent and IL-17-independent. AMs and DCs are critical to IL-23 and IL-1 indcution of this neutrophil recruitment. These studies identify IL-23 as a key mediator of neutrophil recruitment in the early stages of infection as well as the proximate mediator in the IL-23/IL-17 pro-inflammatory axis and suggest IL-23 as a potential target for anti-inflammatory therapy in the treatment of PA pulmonary infection.",

Despite the intake of up to 100,000 bacteria per hour, the airways are sterile below the larynx in healthy individuals. The task of maintaining this sterility falls to the airway surface liquid layer (ASL), the protective twophased system consisting of the viscoelastic mucus layer and the periciliary layer (PCL) through which cilia beat, sweeping the mucus layer away from the lungs. The mucus layer, which is responsible for trapping pathogenic material, is comprised of mucins (high molecular weight glycoproteins), cellular debris, DNA, neurtifils, and more than 100 other proteins. This chemically heterogeneous mixture forms a viscoelastic gel that is thick enough to trap pathogens of various sizes and surface chemistries, while not sticking to the underling cellular / cilia layer, allowing the transport of trapped pathogenic materials away from the lungs. The performance of this trapping / transportation system is defined by the rheological properties of the mucus layer and the force imparted on the mucus. Therefore, understanding how mucins and other chemical components of the mucus layer interact with each other to form a successful mucus gel (i.e. one that is cleared from the airways) is crucial to understanding airway defense.",

The rheological properties of each sample was assayed using parallel plate rheolometry, probing the materials non-linear viscoelastic properties such as viscosity, elasticity, and yield stress. The physical properties of the sample are then correlated to the sample's chemical properties such as percents solids (divided between salts, proteins, and mucins), as well as the relative concentrations of the key airway mucins Muc 5B and Muc 5AC. Our results indicate that the physical properties of sputum are not well predicted from the total amount of biosolids in a given sputum sample, but by the relative concentrations of Muc 5B and Muc 5AC and the interactions of these molecules with themselves and the other proteins present. Further, we establish that the heterogeneous physical properties within a given sputum sample correlate to differences in the Muc5B and Muc 5AC concentrations. The Gene Modifier Study (GMS) was established as an effort to identify potential genetic modifiers of cystic fibrosis pulmonary disease and survival. During the course of this study over 1000 delta F508 homozygous CF patients classified as having mild lung disease, severe lung disease, or increased survival, have submitted both clinical data and blood samples for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. The original SNP analyses have shown a significant association between variants in the endothelin receptor A (EDNRA) gene, and CF survival, most markedly in female CF patients. Sixteen additional SNPs within and around the EDNRA gene have now been genotyped, and have implicated the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the gene as having the most significant association with pulmonary disease in females (p<0.000001), suggesting quantitative differences as a possible mechanism for the association with pulmonary phenotype. We are in the process of saturating the 5' and 3' regions of EDNRA with an additional 20 SNPs to further delineate the genetic association. EDNRA binds endothelin-1 (ET-1) in airway smooth muscle cells, causing increased cell proliferation, smooth muscle contraction, and stimulation of inflammatory molecules. Because each of these effects is known to be deleterious to the CF lung, we hypothesize that the EDNRA variants found more commonly in \"severe\" CF females (\"severe\" alleles) are marking increased EDNRA expression compared to alleles found more commonly in \"mild\" CF females (\"mild\" allelels). Because the genetic association was strongest in CF females, we used the Matinspector software to analyze 2kb of EDNRA promoter sequence and found several putative binding sites for both estrogen and progesterone. We then used a BrDU assay to measure cell proliferation after stimulation with both estrogen and progesterone. These experiments showed that the ASM cells with the \"severe\" 5' EDNRA genotype proliferated at levels approximately twice that of the ASM cells with the \"mild\" 5' EDNRA genotype following stimulation with either estrogen or progesterone. Using a single base extension protocol and quantitative PCR on human airway smooth muscle cells, we were also able to compare EDNRA expression from the \"severe\" allele, and the \"mild\" allele. These comparisons of EDNRA expression demonstrate that expression levels appear to be approximately 20% higher from alleles found more frequently in the \"severe\" CF females. In addition, preliminary data suggest that stimulating the ASM cells with estrogen increases EDNRA expression by approximately 10 fold, and like the cell proliferation experiments, these increases are most pronounced in cell lines with the \"severe\" genotypes. These data suggest that the \"severe\" genotypes are marking alleles with increased expression, perhaps due to estrogen binding, that leads to increased ET-1 functional effects that over time are deleterious to the CF lung. CF patients do present with variable spectra of lung disease, of which infections are most life-threatening. \u03b2-defensins have an antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms and are chemotactic agents for cells of the adaptive immune system, and therefore assist in combating these infections.",

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common extrapulmonary complication of CF and is an increasingly important contributor to morbidity and mortality as CF patients live longer. While pancreatic fibrosis and loss of exocrine and endocrine tissue are common in CF, 20-30% of CF adults develop defects in insulin secretion and accumulation of islet amyloid polypeptide, features typical of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the general population. To test whether modifier genes play a role in CFRD, we compared concordance rates for CFRD in 68 pairs of monozygous (MZ) twins, 22 sets of dizygous (DZ) twins, and 470 sets of 2 or more siblings (1176 individuals with CF). Criteria for defining CFRD included physician diagnosis, treatment with insulin/oral agent, and 2 episodes of glucose \u2265200 mg/dl. MZ twins were highly concordant for CFRD (9 of 12 pairs, 75%). The young age of DZ twin recruits precluded analysis of this group in isolation (0 of 4 pairs were concordant). Twelve of 71 (14%) sibling pairs were concordant for CFRD. With heritability defined as: h 2 =2*(MZ concordance -DZ concordance), and including siblings as a proxy for DZ twins, heritability is estimated as ~1.0. The same results were obtained considering only same-sex DZ twins and siblings, correcting for differences in age and duration of clinical follow-up, or restricting analysis to \u2206F508 homozygotes. These data support a significant role for one or more modifier genes in development of CFRD. We then tested whether CFRD correlated with a strong family history of adult-onset diabetes (at least 1 first-degree or 2 second-degree relatives on the same side of the family). Of those reporting family history of diabetes, 20 of 69 had CFRD, compared to 34 of 271 with no family history (OR=2.84 [1.5-5.4 ]; p=0.001). This correlation persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and pancreatic insufficiency (OR=2.6; p=0.028). Thus, family history of diabetes correlated with increased risk of CFRD. We then tested whether variants in TCF7L2, a transcription factor in the Wnt signaling pathway, that have been reproducibly associated with T2DM in the general population were associated with CFRD in our study subjects. Genotyping of four single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with T2DM (rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, rs12255372, here termed snpA-D) and transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) of 53 parent-parent-child trios revealed significant overtransmission for snpB (31:16, p=0.03) and snpC (28:15, p=0.047), and possible overtransmission for snpA (33:22, p=0.1) and snpD (31:18, p=0.06). In every case, the TCF7L2 allele overtransmitted to patients with CFRD is the same allele that confers increased risk for T2DM. Furthermore, individuals with CFRD who were homozygous for risk alleles were diagnosed at a significantly earlier age (average 14.6 vs. 20.1; p=0.03). These data support a key role for modifier genes in development of CF-related diabetes, and demonstrate that CFRD and type 2 diabetes may share disease mechanisms such as alterations in Wnt signaling.

Important clinical features, such as severity of lung disease, liver disease and meconium ileus (MI) status, are well defined. TGF\u03b21 has been previously identified as a modifier of CF lung disease (Drumm et al., NEJM, 353(14) : [1443] [1444] [1445] [1446] [1447] [1448] [1449] [1450] [1451] [1452] [1453] 2005) , but it does not explain all of the genetic heterogeneity in this population. Current evidence suggests that mucus is involved in the progression of CF, making the MUC genes prime candidates as modifiers of lung disease and/or other phenotypes. METHODS: Our approach to evaluate MUC genes utilizes both variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). VNTR polymorphisms in the MUC2 and MUC5AC genes (n=405 and n=366 patients, respectively) were detected by Southern blotting under conditions fully optimized to maximize the allele size resolution. To minimize gel to gel variation, a genomic DNA mixture with the most common MUC2 and MUC5AC alleles was used as internal markers. Accuracy and reproducibility were evaluated by duplicating the Southern on the critical DNA samples for MUC2 and MUC5AC genes (n=85 and n=63 patients, respectively). Fifty SNPs in MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC2, MUC1 and MUC4 genes are being tested using Illumina technology in 808 CF patients. RESULTS: Preliminary analysis suggests there are significant differences between CF patients with \"severe\" and \"mild\" lung disease for both MUC2 and MUC5AC allele distribution, which is mainly driven by the male population; exhaustive statistical data analysis still is underway. The VNTR data also suggest significant association between the larger MUC2 allele size and CF patients with MI. The ongoing VNTR analysis will be complemented by MUC gene SNPs being genotyped. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results indicate that we can reproducibly characterize MUC2 and MUC5AC VNTR alleles. Additional characterization of MUC2 and MUC5AC VNTR alleles, coupled to SNP data, will allow us to better define the significance of MUC gene variations as modifiers of different CF phenotypes.",

            "text": "Reporting for the Gene Modifier Study group (MRK). We have previously reported that \u03b2ENaC transgenic mice, which overexpress the beta subunit of the amiloride sensitive sodium channel (Scnn1b) specifically in the airways, share common features with CF, including increased ENaC activity, reduced airway surface liquid, mucus accumulation and obstruction, inflammation, and death. Interestingly, analysis of this model also suggested the existence of potential genetic modifiers of phenotype severity, and we speculated that identification of these modifiers would provide novel insights into disease phenotype. To establish a set of reagents that could be used to uncover genetic modifiers, we have bred \u03b2ENaC transgenic mice from two independent founder lines (6608 and 6047, B6:C3 background) onto several strains of inbred mice, including C57BL/6N, C3H/HeN, BALB/cJ, FVB/J, and 129/SvJ. These studies revealed dramatic phenotypic differences as measured by survival (0 to 80%) among strains and between lines. All lines thus far tested show ~2-3 fold increases in amiloride sensitive short-circuit current as measured by Ussing chambers in the trachea. Complete phenotypic characterization of C57BL/6N Line 6608 at backcross generation 12 reveals high survival (66\u00b15% in comparison to 54\u00b14% of the mixed B6:C3 background), yet the mice maintain the pulmonary features of the originally reported mice, including increased mucus plugging, mucous cell hyperplasia, neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation peaking at early timepoints (5 days -2 weeks). Lymphocytic nodules, which are not commonly seen in 4-6 weeks-old animals with mixed strain background, are a common feature in the C57BL/6N congenic line. Emphysema and early airway epithelial cell necrosis, two phenotypes initially not strongly associated with transgene expression, are also observed. Line 6608 on BALB/cJ and C3H/HeN backgrounds has reduced survival compared to the C57BL/6N background, and generation 8 backcross lines are now being evaluated in these two strains for other phenotypic characteristics. Analysis of backcross data from Line 6047, which has low survival on all genetic backgrounds tested to date, including C57BL/6N, suggested that the transgene may have integrated onto a C3H locus with a dominant negative effect on survival. Genetic analysis using genome-wide SNP genotyping revealed a region of Chromosome 4 linked to the transgene in Line 6047 (LOD score > 3.0). Further analysis of this region is underway. In summary, backcrossing onto different genetic backgrounds is revealing genetic modifiers for phenotypes in the \u03b2ENaC overexpressing model. Characterization of these phenotypic and genetic differences should provide clues about the mechanisms relevant to disease development. Furthermore, inbred lines with variable phenotype will likely be an important reagent for the CF community as the utility of this model is evaluated in future studies.

Introduction: New York State screens newborns with immunoreactive trypsinogen levels within the top 5% of all infants, for 32 common CF gene mutations. Infants found to be heterozygote carriers are referred to a CF Center to determine sweat chloride concentration. The proposed abnormal sweat chloride value for this group of newborns is \u2265 40 mmol/L, \u2265 3 standard deviation (SD) above the mean (Farrell, 1996) . This retrospective study reports on the mean sweat chloride value + 3 SD in CF heterozygote newborns who have been referred for evaluation to SUNY Upstate Medical University Cystic Fibrosis Center, and regarding the genotype of these infants with abnormal sweat chloride levels.",

            "text": "Conclusions:The clinical effect of compound heterozygosity as a result of novel or rare CF gene mutations appears to be mild in early childhood. Prior to newborn screening (with the exception of the patient with CFTR deletion), these patients may not have been diagnosed with CF in the first few years of life. These patients may have subclinical airway inflammation and thus benefit from early treatment. Patients with CF manifest symptoms in the pancreas, respiratory tract, male reproductive tract and sweat gland due to mutations in CFTR. Patients with non-classic CF have disease in a subset of these organ systems. Most non-classic CF patients have two disease-causing mutations in CFTR and at least one mutation permits residual CFTR function. A subset of non-classic CF patients have only one CF-causing mutation after screening for a panel of common CF-causing mutations or following mutation scanning of the coding region of CFTR. These patients present a diagnostic dilemma and a challenge for genetic counseling. We evaluated 10 CF patients with only one CF-causing mutation identified after a screen of 97 CFTR mutations (3 patients) or scanning of the coding region of CFTR (7 patients). Nine of these patients, including one set of siblings, have non-classic CF with borderline or elevated sweat [Cl -] plus lung disease (Table) . One patient is pancreatic insufficient and has classic CF. Many of these patients have features which are consistent with CFTR dysfunction including a CF-like nasal potential difference (NPD),P. aeruginosa infection, or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), suggesting that they have a second CFTR mutation. Mutations that are not detected by screening methods include insertions or deletions, mutations outside of the CFTR coding region that affect RNA splicing or expression, or mutations in the coding region of CFTR that were missed by screening methods. To exclude the third possiblity, DNA sequencing of the 27 exons and flanking introns of CFTR was performed. A second mutation was identified in the coding region of CFTR in 6 of the 10 patients; 3 had screening for 97 known CFTR mutations (Genzyme), while the remaining 3 had comprehensive scanning of the coding region of CFTR by modified TGGE (Ambry). Each of the mutations identified by sequencing has been previously described in patients with CF and is predicted to cause CFTR dysfunction. These results reaffirm that patients with one CFTR mutation who have biochemical and clinical features of CF are likely to have a second mutation in the coding region of CFTR. Thus, we suggest sequencing CFTR in patients with only one mutation after mutation screening before employing other more complex genotyping methods (insertion/deletion or RNA analysis). Diagnostic criteria for confirming CF in symptomatic individuals includes two positive sweat tests or two known disease-causing CFTR mutations. Accurate sweat testing is performed at accredited CF Centers, while CFTR testing is available through national and specialty genetic labs. Most labs offer analysis of a basic panel of CFTR mutations as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), while specialty laboratories may offer an expanded panel or full sequencing/scanning. We report on one Center's use of these methodologies to confirm the diagnosis of CF presenting in adulthood.",

We acknowledge that circumstances may arise where reliable sweat testing is not conveniently available; but in our series, genotyping with the ACMG panel would have diagnosed 10% of pts; using an expanded panel would have diagnosed 35%. Genotyping is an important tool for genetic counseling, determination of eligibility for research studies, furthering knowledge of CFTR dysfunction and CF pathophysiology, and for confirming a CF diagnosis after borderline or suggestive sweat test results.

            "text": "In Colorado, 318 infants with CF (non-meconium ileus) have been diagnosed with CF by a two tiered immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT/IRT) based newborn screening approach. The IRT/IRT algorithm has been recently adopted by other screening programs with two mandatory screening tests. While most infants in Colorado have been successfully identified, the program has had a missed case rate of approximately 5%. The more common approach to CF newborn screening is the IRT/DNA method in which the blood spot of infants with an initial elevated IRT is tested for the most common CF mutations. The initial IRT cutoff is lower in the IRT/DNA programs than in the IRT/IRT programs, resulting in a lower missed case rate. The considerable number of carriers identified through the IRT/DNA approach puts a significant burden on the genetic counseling community, as carriers are identified at a rate of 1/20-1/25 of positive IRTs We propose an IRT/IRT/DNA newborn screening algorithm that will maximize sensitivity and specificity while minimizing the number of identified carriers. Using new database technologies in the newborn screening lab we will be able to identify those infants with an elevated first IRT (>60ng/ml, approximately 97th percentile). All infants with an IRT >60ng/ml will have a repeat IRT on their second state mandated blood-spot. If the second screen is also elevated (>60ng/ml), the blood spot will be tested using a panel of 43 mutations, including mutations specific to the Hispanic community. Infants with one or two CFTR mutations will have a sweat test to confirm the diagnosis, or rule out CF. We compared the projected statistics of our current method IRT/IRT to the new IRT/IRT/DNA method, and to IRT/DNA is presented in the table, based on 70,000 births per year in Colorado. Four infants (1.5%) identified under the current IRT/IRT protocol would not have been identified by the mutation panel proposed in the new algorithm, out of 288 genotyped, non-meconium ileus infants. Three of these missed cases are Hispanic. Two would be identified using an extreme IRT cutoff of the 99.9th percentile (150ng/ml). The projected missed case rate would be <0.7% (0.2 -2.5%, 95% CI), using the IRT/IRT/DNA algorithm, with 23 carriers identified, maximizing both sensitivity and specificity. This algorithm may provide a better alternative to the IRT/IRT screening methods in states with two mandatory screening tests, and has advantages over both the IRT/IRT and IRT/DNA methods. Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) is rapidly expanding and has been implemented in at least 30 states. Although most newborn screening assays are done using biochemical testing, many laboratories screening for CF include both biochemical and molecular testing of multiple alleles in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene. In response to the growing need for proficiency testing (PT) materials for molecular testing, the Centers for Disease Control's Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program (NSQAP) in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Case Western Reserve University, created a repository of dried-blood spot specimens with known mutations in the CFTR gene to be used in a PT program. Twenty milliliters of blood was collected voluntarily from adult donors with CF and sent to the NSQAP laboratory. Each specimen was adjusted to a hematocrit of 55% before being spotted onto Whatman 903 paper (75 \u00b5L per spot), dried, and stored at -20\u00b0C with desiccant. Proficiency testing (PT) panels consisted of 5 to 7 blind-coded specimens from adult donors. The panels were sent quarterly to laboratories worldwide that test specimens for CF using molecular methods. Laboratories were asked to report the genotype, method used, and the presumptive clinical assessment of each specimen. Twenty-two laboratories participated during both Quarters 1 and 2, 2007. The laboratories used 16 different methods ranging from in-house assays to commercially available kits. Most reporting laboratories tested the following 3 alleles -\u2206F508, G542X, and G551D. Another twelve alleles were detected by most participants. Nine more alleles were common among commercially available kits. Laboratories were evaluated based on the clinical assessments. Mutations that were not detected by a particular method were not evaluated. Overall, the laboratories performed well. Data compiled from both quarters demonstrated that there was 1 incorrect clinical assessment and 2 amplification failures. Developing a PT program for DNA-based testing is complicated by the number of methods and different alleles each laboratory chooses to test. Though molecular testing for CF may be complex, PT monitors the laboratory's ability to test multiple alleles, including uncommon alleles, the limitations of various assays, and the different algorithms used for screening. The repository will also allow storage and access to rare specimens that may be useful for future research but are not readily available. who did could not reproduce. Genetic counseling focused on a patient's parents, who were counseled about their recurrence risk at the time of the child's diagnosis. Today, CF is a disease of adulthood. In 2002, >40% of CF patients in the US were >18; by 2010 it will be >50%. Together with advances in assisted reproductive technology (ART), reproduction and recurrence risk are now important issues for adolescent and young adult CF patients.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Despite widespread availability, the lack of knowledge of adolescents and young adults with CF about the genetics of their disease continues. Furthermore, these patients are unaware of both modern technologies that could enable them to have biological children and the risk of those children having CF. This study illustrates the changing needs of patient education as medical knowledge progresses. CF patients would benefit from further genetic knowledge and counseling to enable them to make informed decisions about reproduction as they mature into adulthood. Center at the University of Minnesota is one of three sites in the state providing confirmatory testing and follow up services for newborns identified by screening. While CF NBS identifies children with CF, most of the infants with positive screening results are carriers. Our goal is to provide genetic counseling to every CF NBS patient seen at our center, and we believe that a protocol incorporating genetic counseling in the initial care plan for infants both with and without CF is imperative. The literature has shown that families who obtain genetic counseling through the CF NBS process recall genetic information more easily and accurately and are more likely to have testing to determine parental carrier status. For parents of a child that is determined to be a CF carrier, it is especially important to find the optimal method and timing of genetic counseling as many of these families are from several hours away and therefore less likely to return to clinic. To provide genetic information and emotional support for the families of infants screening positive on CF NBS, our center has a genetic counselor who serves as the CF NBS coordinator and clinical contact for the family. This allows many opportunities to speak with the genetic counselor and ask questions, as well as learn about their child's diagnosis or carrier status and the subsequent carrier testing recommendations for the infant's parents and families. To assess the success and impact of the Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis Center's NBS follow-up program and the incorporation of genetic counseling, an anonymous questionnaire was developed for parents of infants who were seen at our center due to a positive CF NBS result. Questionnaires were mailed to parents of all infants seen at our center for a sweat test and genetic counseling due to a positive cystic fibrosis newborn screening result. As of the last mailing, this totals 54 families. Two questionnaires were returned due to incorrect address and 28 questionnaires were returned answered, indicating a response rate of 54% (28/52). Responses overwhelmingly indicated that parents were satisfied with our center's algorithm for the CF NBS follow-up program and found the information and support provided through genetic counseling to be a useful and recommended portion of the program. As CF NBS continues, it is critical that we learn about the patient's experience with genetic counseling and the NBS program, as well as identify areas needing improvement. Genetic counseling is vital to the comprehensive success of our center's program, and we will report on the responses gathered from the families identified through CF NBS this first year, as well as discuss the lessons learned from setting up such projects on a state-wide basis. Background & Aims: Aberrant splicing and nonsense mediated decay (NMD) lead to dysfunctional mRNAs by skipping exons and to a reduced number of functional mRNA respectively. Both mechanisms have a strong quantitative aspect and may determine whether a CF patient develops a classic or atypical disease phenotype. In order to approach these highly important questions we wanted to establish a new quantitative real-time PCR based assay which allows allele specific quantification on cDNA level. Using this assay we like to determine the exact proportions of the F508del and non-F508del CFTR mRNA in CF patients compound heterozygous for the F508del mutation (for example in CF patients carrying the F508del and a nonsense mutation such as the R553X).",

Background & Aims: As clinical presentation varies significantly among CF patients with the same genotype, e.g. in the F508del homozygous, it is evident that factors in addition to the CFTR genotype such as modifier genes, are involved in determining disease severity. However, only one of several previously postulated modifier genes, the TGF\u03b21 gene, could recently be confirmed in a large association study. Hence the identification of new modifier genes is a very important task in order to find new explanations for the heterogeneity of pulmonary disease in CF patients. We decided to search for new potential modifier genes applying a quantitative proteomic approach comparing the proteomes of a wild type (16HBE14o-) and a F508del homozygous bronchial epithelial cell line (CFBE41o-). The main goal of this study is the identification of up or down regulated proteins in the CFBE cell line which may act as modifiers of CF disease.",

Healthy controls are age 18 and older, Caucasian males and females, obtained from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR), a DNA registry of 20,000 self-reported normal volunteers. We genotyped 485 blood samples from the EPR to define 30 healthy control subjects for each of the CC and TT cohorts. Subjects have a blood draw of 35 ml. Blood is divided into 4 tubes and each tube is used to measure a different parameter: CBC with differential; TGF\u03b21 levels in platelet poor plasma by Quantikine Human TGF\u03b21 ELISA kit; TGF\u03b21 levels in the buffy coatwhich includes platelets; and TGF\u03b21 mRNA levels in lymphocytes from the buffy coat, using real-time PCR Roche Light Cycler. CBC with differential is performed to quantitate lymphocytes and platelets in order to reference TGF\u03b21 protein and RNA levels to the number of circulating blood cells. Analyses will include graphical comparisons between the two groups, Chi Square analysis, student's two-sample t test, and one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results: Pilot studies show that ELISA TGF\u03b21 measurements are reproducible and mRNA levels can be quantified. We have currently enrolled 14 CC genotype and 26 TT genotype of the 60 CF subjects and 11 CC genotype and 19 TT genotype of the 60 healthy controls. Blood samples have been collected and processed.

A recent study reports strong genetic influences for MI (Blackman et al., Gastroenterology, 2006) , but it did not replicate the modifier locus on chr. 19q13. Inconsistency of results may reflect the variability of data reporting and different classifications of MI (i.e. surgically or medically treated). We tested the accuracy of reporting of MI on Case Report Forms (CRFs), as compared to primary source documents. Methods: The CRF for the GMS has a checklist for past medical history. For example, we requested \"Yes\" or \"No\" for MI (an obstruction of the terminal ileum at birth), but did not require source documents or identification of the type of treatment. To evaluate CRF reporting of MI, we requested source documents for patients with reported MI, including a surgical or medical treatment report. If a written report from the time of birth was unavailable, a clinic note, detailing MI at birth, treatment, and evidence of a surgical, abdominal scar (if applicable), was required. Verbal confirmation by the patient and evidence of a surgical scar was also accepted, if no written documentation was available. Results: On CRFs, 233 of 1371 patients (17%) were initially reported to have MI. To date, source documentation has been obtained for 140 patients, and 112 of those (80%) have been confirmed to have MI (92% by written report, 8% by verbal report). Of the 112 with confirmed MI, 92 (82%) had surgery, and 20 (18%) had medical treatment. There were 10 false reports of MI (7.1%). MI could not be confirmed or refuted for 18 patients (12.9%) because of insufficient information (n=16) or confounding circumstances (n=2). To date, documentation for 243 patients who were reported to have no MI has been obtained, and no false negatives have been found. Additional documentation for MI from other sites is expected. Conclusion: At least 7%, and perhaps as many as 18%, of the reports of MI on CRFs were inaccurate. Gene modifier studies must include rigorous documentation of MI to ensure an accurate correlation between phenotype and genotype. Studies should also characterize different classifications (i.e. surgical vs. medical treatment) to assist the detection of gene modifiers of MI.",

We have also analysed the I1234V mutation at the protein level by producing a stable BHK cell line expressing the I1234V-CFTR, after generating the respective mutant cDNA construct by site-direct mutagenesis. Protein expression and function was determined by immunoblot and iodide efflux assay, respectively. Results show that I1234V-CFTR protein is processed and functional.

Our findings were seen in two independent cohorts and verify existing associations found in other populations. The endothelin pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CF lung disease. Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a recessive \"monogenetic\" disorder, but there is heterogeneity of lung disease severity and survival reflecting environment and non-CFTR genetic modifiers. The UNC/CWRU multisite Gene Modifier Study (GMS) identified patients who were \"severe\" or \"mild\" as teenagers or young adults and pertinent cross-sectional data was collected; however, we did not collect all pertinent information about early (age <8 years) clinical features. Objective: We sought to retrospectively evaluate the early clinical features of \"severe\" and \"young mild\" patients enrolled in the GMS. Methods: We obtained all CFF Registry data available on 596 patients. There were 303 \"severe\" (worst 25 th percentile of birth cohort, age range 8-25) and 293 \"mild\" (best 25 th percentile, age range 15-28). Initial analyses focused on cross-sectional plots of patient age versus multiple clinical features, including age at diagnosis, hospitalizations, CDC height and weight percentiles, presence/absence of Ps. aeruginosa from respiratory cultures, and FEV 1 (% Pred). Results: There were 15.5 and 17.6 years of CFF Registry data per patient for \"severes\" and \"milds,\" respectively. Preliminary results indicate \"severe\" patients were diagnosed earlier in life than \"mild\" patients (mean: 1.2 vs. 1.9 years, p=0.004). This difference is greater after omitting patients who had meconium ileus (diagnosis: 1.4 vs 2.3 years, \"severes\" and \"milds\" respectively, p=0.003). Between 1 and 7 years of age, \"severe\" patients were hospitalized more frequently than \"mild\" patients and, from age 8 onwards, the disparity in frequency of hospitalization increased. \"Severes\" and \"milds\" had similar CDC height percentiles (~35 th percentile) until age 8, at which point percentiles increased more for \"mild\" versus \"severe\" patients. By age 3, \"severe\" patients already had lower CDC weight percentiles than \"milds\" (32 nd versus 41 st percentile) and this disparity increased throughout adolescence. From age 1 to 8, \"severe\" patients had a 2-3 fold higher prevalence of Ps. aeruginosa than \"mild\" patients. As early as 6 years of age, FEV 1 (% Pred) was ~30 points lower in \"severes\" as compared to \"milds.\" However, some \"severe\" patients had normal lung function at ages 6-8 and overlapped with mild patients; thus phenotyping of lung severity for young patients is not optimal. All of these results were similar for males and females. Summary: Retrospective analysis of the CFF Registry data indicates that patients classified later in life as being \"severe\" experience a worse course of disease from early in life. Understanding the early clinical course may prove helpful in defining surrogate phenotypes for modifier studies, and help define appropriate therapeutic targets. Cystic fibrosis is mainly caused by small molecular defects of the CFTR gene; despite the genotype is defined in the majority of patients, a number of CF cases still remain uncharacterised. The CF mutation database lists more than 35 large rearrangements that may escape detection using PCRbase techniques. The Innogenetics assay, the DHPLC and sequencing screening showed a mutation detection rate of 92.6% in our population. We report here the results of MLPA screening for CTFR gene rearrangements, performed on the unidentified alleles of our CF patients.",

A number of the non-coding regions of the CFTR gene were found by our laboratory to contain DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS), suggesting the presence of regulatory elements at these sites. Studies presented here investigate the role of an intron 1 DHS (DHS1) in the tissue-specific regulation of CFTR gene transcription.

In silico analysis of this sequence uncovered a number of transcription factors binding motifs, including a consensus binding sequence for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1). We have previously identified a role for this factor in the regulation of CFTR expression. Results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrate that HNF1\u03b1 specifically binds to the motif in CFTR intron 1 in vitro. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of cells expressing both CFTR and HNF1\u03b1 factor shows that this factor binds to the intron 1 site in vivo. When cloned as an enhancer, the DHS1 element was found to augment minimal CFTR promoter activity in a luciferase reporter based assay. This increase in luciferase activity was abolished when two nucleotides within the core HNF1 binding site were mutated, suggesting a functional role for HNF1\u03b1 in CFTR gene transcription. Further experiments are underway to determine whether additional transcription factors can be recruited to the core of the intron 1 DHS regulatory element and can interact with HNF1 and the CFTR basal promoter to modulate tissue-specific CFTR gene expression. The promoter of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene is not solely responsible for its complex pattern of expression. To identify potential regulatory elements for CFTR we previously mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) across 400 kb spanning the locus. In addition to intronic DHS, a number of sites were observed that flank the CFTR gene. We hypothesized that these may include insulator elements that establish the chromatin expression domain, within which the CFTR gene is regulated. Insulators are elements that shield against the effects of regulatory elements from adjacent genes, and they may also block silencing of integrated transgenes.",

Lifetime, systemic exposure to these antibiotics is significant and can be associated with significant nephro-and ototoxicity. These toxicities have the potential to significantly reduce the quality of life in the aging adult CF population. We previously reported an incidence of aminoglycoside ototoxicity of greater than 50% with sensitive audiometric studies (i.e. pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions). These studies indicated considerable variability in ototoxicity in patients with similar systemic aminoglycoside exposure. The literature suggests that genetic variability in mitochondrial DNA can partially explain these differences. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the mitochondrial 12SrRNA gene are associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity. We genotyped 90 unselected adult CF patients for four of the mitochondrial 12S-rRNA polymorphisms associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity by direct sequencing of DNA harvested from peripheral blood. Four patients exhibited polymorphisms in this gene. Two patients possessed the A1555G transition, while another patient each revealed a polymorphism at A827G and C1494T transitions. The patient with the A827G polymorphism died prior to audiometric testing. Both patients with the A1555G had audiometric studies consistent with moderate to severe ototoxicity. while the patient with the C1494T had mild aminoglycoside ototoxicity. All four patients had severe airway obstruction and at least one full course of parenteral tobramycin at 8mg/kg/d. There was no history of toxic serum levels aminoglycosides during this therapy. Both patients with the A1555G polymorphism had a family history consistent with the expected maternal inheritance pattern associated with the mitochondrial 12S-rRNA gene. We found no evidence of the delT961 polymorphism in this population. These studies indicate a higher than expected frequency (4%) of mitochondrial 12S rRNA polymorphisms associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity. These studies demonstrate that genetic screen-ing provides valuable susceptibility information and may change clinical decision-making. Support: Rising Hope Foundation/National CF Foundation. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic autosomal recessive disease that is caused by deleterious mutations in the CFTR gene. In its most severe form, CF results in abnormal sweat electrolytes, sino-pulmonary disease, male infertility, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. In fact, CF is the most frequent cause of pancreatic insufficiency in humans. Carriers of CF (i.e., heterozygotes) do not express any of these classic symptoms. Recent studies indicate that significant numbers of non-CF patients diagnosed with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) or idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) are compound heterozygotes and carry two CFTR mutations of varying severity. In dogs, especially German Shepherds and rough-coated Collies, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) has been observed with symptoms similar to those seen in human patients. EPI in dogs is most often caused by pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA), a degenerative disease of the exocrine pancreas that has been shown to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The locus responsible for canine PAA has not been identified to date. We considered the possibility that CFTR mutations might be responsible for this disease. A dog that had been diagnosed with PAA and one that was a known carrier of PAA were screened for CFTR mutations. Our samples also included dogs diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis as well as healthy dogs. We have established protocols for detecting putative mutations in the canine CFTR gene using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). In the dog with PAA and in the carrier of PAA, our screening methodology identified mutations in 8 of the 27 amplicons that span the 27 exons of the CFTR gene. DNA sequencing revealed silent mutations in exons 17, 26 and 27. In exons 17 (L888) and 26 (L1402), single nucleotide polymorphisms converted CTT codons into CTC codons, both leucine codons. In exon 27 (P1447) another single nucleotide polymorphism converted a CCC proline codon into a CCT proline codon. The other identified mutations (amplicons 15, 16 and 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26 and 27) were found in intronic sequences and have no predicted effect on CFTR expression or function. Based on these findings, we conclude that CFTR mutations are not responsible for PAA and the EPI that it causes in dogs. Hypothesis: Specific polymorphisms in genes of the innate immunity may modify the severity and progression of CF pulmonary disease and influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation.",

CBAVD lacks extra-genital organ system abnormalities; it has been viewed as a mild (variant) form of CF. The disease serves as an excellent model for studying the clinical and experimental ramifications of marginal CFTR activity, and the functional thresholds necessary to confer a CF-related phenotype. Recently, Drumm et al. (NEJM, 2005) found that the codon 10 CC genotype of TGF\u03b2-1 is associated with more severe pulmonary disease, particularly in individuals homozygous for \u2206F508 CFTR. TGF\u03b2 is also known to play a critical role during normal development and differentiation of the human vas deferens (Han-nema et al., Horm Res, 2007) . Because 70% of CBAVD subjects carry at least one defective CFTR allele (but millions of males worldwide are heterozygous for CFTR mutations without developing CBAVD), the present study was designed to test whether TGF\u03b2 polymorphism might serve as a genetic modifier underlying isolated vas deferens loss in the setting of CBAVD. We sequenced the 5' end of the TGF\u03b2 gene in eighty CBAVD individuals possessing at least one CFTR mutation, and compared genotype frequency with results previously published from demographically similar controls. When CC frequency in CBAVD subjects was compared to pooled estimates from earlier trials, no significant differences were seen using a non-dominant model. Compared to frequencies reported by Arkwright et al. and Garrote et al., a greater number of homozygous CC subjects (23.8% vs. 11.4%, p<0.005) was observed. Our preliminary results therefore indicate that if TGF\u03b2-1 codon 10 polymorphism is associated with CBAVD penetrance, it does not represent the major modifier of disease phenotype. In order to evaluate this possibility further, we plan analysis of a larger (matched) control set of CBAVD and non-CBAVD individuals, studies of TGF\u03b2-1 activity in vas deferens epithelial cells with and without CFTR, and experiments to investigate the effects of TGF\u03b2 on CFTR biogenesis and function.

            "text": "Newborn screening (NBS) for CF has been successful in identifying CF infants, particularly those who have positive sweat tests immediately following the positive screening result. Tracking by personnel at the central NBS program facilitates resolution of diagnostic status because CF NBS presents a challenge to CF Center (CFC) systems and primary care providers when apparently asymptomatic infants have inadequate (quantity not sufficient (QNS)), borderline or indeterminate sweat tests. Short-term follow up is more problematic when the screening algorithm requests earlier sweat tests and defines a lower cutoff for indeterminate sweat test results than is used for older infants, children and adults. The Massachusetts (MA) CF NBS Workgroup chose a low cutoff for indeterminate results of 30 mEq/L up to 6 months of age, reverting to the accepted 40 mEq/L cutoff thereafter. Follow up by the central NBS program identified infants whose diagnostic status remained unresolved more than 6 weeks after a QNS or borderline sweat test and eliminated the need for individual CFCs to follow infants tested at more than one CFC. The Program sent informational letters and a reminder recommendation to finalize the diagnosis to primary care providers of infants with unresolved diagnoses. Of the 189 CF infants identified by MA CF NBS, 25 had an initial sweat result that was indeterminate and another 20 had an initial result that was QNS. The central screening program has the capacity to track infant and child outcomes across CFCs; for example, we have been tracking growth outcomes of all CF infants identified by MA CF NBS, despite 31 of the 189 CF infants having moved from one CFC to another during their first 5 years of life. Tracking and outcomes data will be presented. When more than one CFC operates within a screening program, centralized tracking ensures capture of quality data. Despite several educational campaigns CF is often not diagnosed in early infancy in Poland (the mean age of diagnosis 42 months, median is 12 months). After several years of discussions,in September 2006 a neonatal screening for CF supported by the Ministery of Health was started as the third obligatory neonatal screening in Poland. More than 124,000 neonates were screened in the first seven months using the existing screening infrastructure and spare blood spots after PKU and congenital hypothyreosis screening. The protocol was two stage IRT/DNA (covering the 47 most common mutations in the Polish population). The final diagnosis was based on sweat tests (conventional pilocarpine-iontophoresis and conductometric nanoduct) as well as clinical examination. Values of Chloride in sweat >40 mmol/l and NaCl >80 mmol/l were considered diagnostic for CF. 12 children were confirmed as CF. Although delta F508 is the most common mutation in the Polish population, only two infants were delta F508 homozygotes, six were delta F508 heterozygotes and the remaining 8 had different mutations (3 children had 3849+10kbC>). Half of the diagnosed group was still pancreatic sufficient. The children had confirmed CF diagnosis at the mean age of 6 weeks. Only 3 children were free from any radiological changes in lungs. The most common pathogen in this group was Staphylococcus aureus. At the first visit information for parents about CF was given along with physiotherapy and dietary education. Anthropometric measurements, airways bacteriology and elastase -1 in stool were performed. Psychologist consultations were available. Neonatal screening for CF enabled earlier diagnosis and the introduction of complex therapy in comparision with symptomatic screening. Objectives: The clinical course of cystic fibrosis (CF) varies widely among patients carrying the same CFTR gene mutations supporting that additional genetic modifiers could affect the CF phenotype. As inflammation is a central contributor to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, genes involved in the inflammatory response are potential modifier candidate genes.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This study suggest that IL-8 variants may influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in CF, however this need further confirmation. Moreover, we provide additional support to the results of other trials and strongly suggest an association between TGF-\u03b21 variants and lung disease phenotype in CF. If such a role of TGF-\u03b21 is confirmed by functional studies, it may have important clinical impact for the identification of patients at risk to develop more severe respiratory manifestations and for the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at adequately balancing TGF-\u03b21 production and action Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic disease in Caucasian population, its frequency is about one in 2500 live born. The estimated frequency in hispanic population is about one in 8500, with differences in mutation frequency especially for low frequent alleles. Heterogeneity in pulmonary manifestations cannot be explained by the CFTR mutation genotype. Recent studies are focused in the study of modifier genes. These are genes different from the primary CFTR gene that could influence the FQ phenotype, acting trough mechanisms like inflammation, repair and remodeling, protease-anti protease balance, innate immune response, etc. This work shows some advances in CF diagnosis and modifier genes analysis in Mexican population. Methods: We tested the effectiveness of INNOLiPA CFTR36 kit (Innogenetics) in 23 clinically diagnosed CF patients. Thirty six frequent mutations in CFTR gene were analyzed by PCR and reverse hybridization with Allele Specific Oligonucleotides probes in DNA samples extracted from blood or oral swabs. For frequency analysis of modifier genes we tested about seventy DNA samples from a DNA bank of patients previously tested positive for CFTR mutation. The polymorphism analysis of modifier genes was made by PCR-RFLP. For Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT), Z and S alleles were analyzed according Stanford and cols. (1999) . For Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF\u03b1) -308 polymorphism in the promoter region was analyzed according Chen and cols. (2006) . Results: Mutation was detected in in 20 of 23 patients (87% of effectiveness). DF508 allele frequency was 52% (Caucasian 60-70%) followed by 2789 +5G-A, S549N, G542X, G85E and 1078delT (20%). 28% of the mutant alleles remain undetected. Preliminary results in modifier genes show low frequency for AAT mutant alleles (1.4% for AAT S and Z alelle respectively) and 8.7% for TNF-308. Conclusions: DF508 alelle frequency was 52%, and we found the low fequency alleles S549N and 2789+5G-A. Frequency of modifier genes mutant alleles in CF patients are low. This work is in progress of selection and recruitment of patients and controls, as well as standardization of the other genes modifiers, along with some other biomarkers that will allow to understand the physiopathology of CF and to define a possible genetic risk profile of severe pulmonary disease. Over 1300 putative Cystic Fibrosis (CF)-causing mutations have been reported to the CF Mutation Database and almost half (~630) are rare missense mutations that are predicted to substitute a single amino acid. To determine if any of these rare missense mutations cause CF by altering localiza-tion of CFTR, we examined mutations in the cytosolic loops of CFTR since localization signals have been identified in cytosolic loops of other ion channels. Amino acids alignments comparing human CFTR sequence to that of 36 species revealed that cytosolic loop 4 (CL4) was the most conserved loop by identity. Furthermore, CL4 had the most naturally observed mutations: 33 of the 68 amino acids were found to be mutated in CF patients and 10 sites had multiple missense mutations at the same amino acid. In addition, different substitutions of the same CL4 amino acid have been associated with different disease consequences, such as the missense mutations in the arginine at codon 1070. Patients with the R1070P mutation have pancreatic insufficient (PI)-CF, those with R1070W mutation have pancreatic sufficient (PS)-CF or CBAVD, while patients with R1070Q primarily had PI-CF.",

Confocal microscopy studies of stable MDCK-FRT-GFP-CFTR-R1070 mutant cell lines revealed that CFTR-R1070P was cytoplasmic, CFTR-R1070W was apical and cytoplasmic, and CFTR-R1070Q was apical. To confirm these observations, quantitative biotinylation studies were performed. Biotinylation assays of MDCK cells stably expressing CFTR-R1070P confirmed that this mutant was absent from the apical surface, CFTR-R1070W had a low level of fully glycosylated protein at the apical membrane, while CFTR-R1070Q had fully glycosylated protein at the apical membrane comparable to wild-type CFTR. Thus, CFTR-R0170P and CFTR-R1070W displayed properties in polarized cells that were distinctly different from wild-type CFTR consistent with their associated CF phenotypes. However, the profile of CFTR-R1070Q (apical localization and Cl-channel function (Seibert et al. 1996 , Mickle et al. 2000 ) appears inconsistent with a PI-CF phenotype. Indeed, re-analysis of CFTR genes bearing R1070Q revealed that 11 of 12 carried a second mutation in cis (S466X). In nine of these patients in whom CFTR genotype and pancreatic status is known, presence of the nonsense mutation S466X is associated with the PI-CF phenotype. Since nonsense mutations are known to cause severe gene dysfunction by promoting decay of their RNA transcript, we concluded that the S466X mutation rather than R1070Q is responsible for the PI-CF phenotype.",

            "text": "The finding of S466X explained the otherwise enigmatic functional studies of R1070Q and clinical observations in patients bearing this mutation. This study also demonstrates that stable expression of CFTR mutants in polarized MDCK cells using the FLP-In system provides a useful screen for evaluating the disease potential of rare missense mutations. The clinical course of CF is characterized by recurrent pulmonary infections and chronic inflammation. In CF patients, up-regulation of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) gene in airway epithelial cells is believed to enhance proinflammatory responses towards bacterial TLR2 ligands. We have recently shown that decreased methylation (demethylation) of the TLR2 promoter is responsible for CF-related up-regulation of TLR2 in bronchial epithelial cells (Shuto. T. et al., FASEB J, 2006) . However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for DNA demethylation-dependent TLR2 gene upregulation in CF cells remain unknown. Here, we identified minimum region of the TLR2 promoter critical for its expression at -120/+110, which contains one putative binding site for Sp1. SP1 inhibitor mithramycin A treatment reduced TLR2 promoter activity and its expression in CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-), suggesting the importance of this SP1 site for the TLR2 gene regulation. Moreover, bisulfite sequence analysis revealed the hypomethylation of adjacent this SP1 binding motif within TLR2 promoter in CFBE41o-cells, implying the CF-specific demethylation of adjacent SP1 binding motif. Although mithramycin A rarely affected basal expression of TLR2 gene in 16HBE14o-cells (non-CF bronchial epithelial cells), mithramycin A inhibited TLR2 expression in 5-azacytidine (DNA-demethylating agent)-treated 16HBE14o-cells. Taken together, our results suggest that SP1 is crucial for DNA demethylation-induced gene upregulation of TLR2 in CF bronchial epithelial cells. Mucus hypersecretion due to goblet cell metaplasia is a critical feature of CF lung disease, affecting both mucociliary clearance and drug delivery. Various studies in CF lungs and CF primary cultures have shown increased expression of MUC5AC, the main gel-forming mucin produced by goblet cells; however, little is known about the role of MUC5AC in the progression of lung disease. To determine whether overexpression of MUC5AC alone is sufficient to induce lung pathology, we generated a mouse model overexpressing Muc5ac. The entire Muc5ac cDNA (minus 26% of the predicted VNTR sequence, final size ~9Kb) was cloned and tagged with an internal GFP epitope at a site close to the VNTR to preserve the integrity of mucin domains. GFP-Muc5ac was linked to the rat CCSP promoter to drive specific airway expression, primarily in Clara cells since these cells are capable of secreting mucins. Blastocyst injections were used to generate transgenic founder lines in C57Bl/6 background. Although Muc5ac-GFP mRNAs were expressed in transgenic mice, lung histology did not show significant increases in inflammation, AB/PAS-positive cells, or luminal secretion compared to wild-type littermates. GFP fluorescence from freshly excised lung was weak but immunohistochemistry showed that the distribution of GFP correlated with the expected expression pattern, with the majority of positive cells localized to the airways and few positive cells in the alveolar space. At higher magnification, GFP-positive granules were observed in dome-shaped cells that were also positive with CC10 antibody, suggesting proper Muc5ac-GFP packaging in Clara cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples separated by agarose gel Western blots and probed with GFP antibody confirmed that each line secreted Muc5ac-GFP, with a migration pattern comparable to a mucin. To further characterize the secreted transgenic mucin, a pool of lavage samples was separated into supernatant and pellet. The pellet was resolubilized in 4M Guanidine. Both elements were passed through a S1000 size-exclusion column. Analysis by light scattering and refractometry to determine molecular weight and concentration revealed that the solubilized pellet contained an enormous but compact complex (920 x 106 g/mol and 320nm radius of gyration). GFP-rich fractions were PAS-positive, indicating proper glycosylation of the transgenic Muc5ac-GFP. CsCl density gradient studies revealed that the GFP-rich fractions had a high molecular weight but did not appear to be a prominent part of the megacomplex retrieved in lavages, unlike other tested mucins. In conclusion, we showed that the overexpressed Muc5ac-GFP was a high-molecular-weight protein that was glycosylated, packaged in Clara cells and formed multimers. Lack of discernable phenotype in the transgenic lungs suggests that mucin overproduction alone is not sufficient to trigger goblet cell metaplasia and mucus accumulation, supporting the protective role of mucins. Currently we are crossing the Muc5ac-GFP with the Scnn1b mouse model to study Muc5ac-GFP under dehydrated conditions and we are conducting allergen-challenges in the transgenic mice. Results of such studies will provide novel insights into the role of secreted Muc5ac in development of lung disease in these models. Supported by grants from the CF Foundation. The major characteristic in cystic fibrosis (CF) is acquirement of chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa. Once established the chronic infection can only be suppressed, not eliminated. The CF patients harbour one single strain of P. aeruginosa which only rarely is replaced by other strains. During the chronic lung infection there is a year long mutual impact of the bactaria on the host, and of the host response and antibiotics on the bacteria, resulting in a continous adaptation of the bactaria in the lungs of the CF patients with selection for different clones. In contrast, mouse models of the lung infection in CF is limited to two weeks! Therefore, we introduced a new strategy infecting different groups of BALB/c mice with pulsed field gel electrophoresis-(PFGE) identical clones isolated from one CF patient during 23-years of P. aeruginosa lung infection.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have implemented a clinical important CF-time perspective (years) in experimental P. aeruginosa lung infection, useful for patho-physiological and treatment studies. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a complex disease that affects multiple organs and results in a wide range of phenotypes in humans. Mouse models of CF display many of the phenotypes observed in human patients and provide necessary tools to dissect this multifaceted disease. However, due to the involvement of Cftr in various organ systems, the ability to discern the contribution of each organ system to each phenotype of CF is unknown. For example, we have found that mouse growth is dramatically reduced compared to wildtype, and mechanisms ranging from neuroendocrine disruption, intestinal malabsorption and cacchexia have been proposed. We have found that CF mice consume more calories per gram body weight than non-CF mice and intestinal absorption of dietary lipids is similar between the two. CF animals absorb 94% and non-CF 97% (p > 0.5). To identify the source of the growth deficit, it would be advantageous to restrict expression of Cftr in specific tissues to determine each tissue's contribution to the phenotype. To accomplish this, we have created a conditional, null murine Cftr allele. A conditional null allele is one in which the gene of interest is induced to be non-functional in either a specific tissue or cell type, or at a specific developmental time. Examination of Cftr absence on a tissue-by-tissue basis will greatly facilitate our understanding of the disease. The conditional Cftr allele was created by \"floxing\" exon 10 of Cftr, known to be critical for function, with flanking LoxP sites that allow for the deletion of exon 10 when bacterial recombinase Cre is present. To date, mice stably transmitting the floxed allele have been created. These founder mice have been crossed with mice expressing Cre from the promoter of the villin gene, which restricts transcription of Cre to intestinal epithelium. First generation animals show appropriate recombination and deletion of exon 10 in the gut. However, these first generation animals are heterozygous for the floxed allele. We are currently backcrossing these animals with the founders to generate animals with homozygous deletion of Cftr in the intestinal epithelium. Similar crosses are planned to target other tissues. This new animal model of CF will be available to the CF research community to further our understanding of CF pathophysiology. This work was supported by a grant from the CF Foundation Increased ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. We demonstrated that mimicking Na+ hyperabsorption by overexpression of \u03b2ENaC in mouse airways results in airway surface liquid (ASL) depletion and reduced mucus clearance causing a spontaneous CFlike lung disease with high pulmonary mortality, and airway mucus obstruction, mucous cell metaplasia and chronic airway inflammation in adult survivors (Mall et al., Nature Med.10:487, 2004) . The aim of this study was to identify the initiating lesions and investigate the natural history of lung disease caused by ASL depletion in \u03b2ENaC overexpressing (\u03b2ENaC-Tg) mice. To achieve this goal, we performed longitudinal studies on lung morphology, airway mucus obstruction, bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cell counts, expression levels of mucins (Muc5ac, Muc5b, Muc4) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, KC, IFN\u03b3, IL-13, Eotaxin-1), lung volume, lung mechanics, and airway Na+ transport in neonatal to adult \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice and wild-type littermate controls. We show that airway mucus obstruction in \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice originated in the trachea in the absence of mucous cell metaplasia in the first days of life, and was associated with hypoxic degeneration and necrosis of airway epithelium, and death. In surviving \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice, mucus obstruction extended into the lungs and was accompanied by secondary mucous cell metaplasia, increased expression of Muc5ac, Muc5b and Muc4, and airway inflammation with transient increases in macrophages and TNF\u03b1, in eosinophils and IL-13, and persistent increases in neutrophils and KC in the lung. \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice also developed emphysema with increased lung volumes, distal airspace enlargement, and increased lung compliance. Several disease surrogate markers waned in parallel with \u03b2ENaC transcript levels and airway Na+ absorption in adult \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice indicating that the level of ENaC overexpression was critical in determining disease severity. In summary, our results provide several novel insights into the in vivo pathogenesis of lung disease caused by ASL depletion. We show that (i) ASL depletion is sufficient to initiate severe airway mucus obstruction in the absence of mucous cell metaplasia and/or mucus hypersecretion; and (ii) airway Na+ hyperabsorption and mucus plugging-induced hypoxia is associated with airway epithelial necrosis constituting a mechanism that initiates airway inflammation in the absence of infection. Further, our results point to a novel link between airway Na+ hyperabsorption, eosinophilic inflammation, and emphysema. The high frequency of allergic airway inflammation and emphysema in CF patients warrants further studies of the mechanisms that link ASL depletion with these associated pathologies. The balance of airway surface liquid (ASL) at a height compatible with efficient clearance of mucus is a process regulated by two main pathways: the secretion of Clvia CFTR, and absorption of Na + via the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC). To study this interplay, an immortal cell line capable of growing at an air liquid interface and having properties of human bronchiolar epithelium would be desirable for its simplicity in preparation and ease of molecular manipulation.",

In contrast, HBAC CFTR cells demonstrated a robust increase in I SC ; a rapid increase to a peak (\u2206~20 \u00b5A cm 2 ), followed by relaxation to a stable and sustained plateau. Genistein (50 \u00b5M) also stimulated I SC in HBAC CFTR (\u2206I SC 13 \u00b5A cm 2 ) but not HBAC MOCK cells. Amiloride resistant basal current was consistently higher, by 2-3 \u00b5A cm 2 , in HBAC CFTR versus HBAC MOCK cells, presumably reflecting low basal CFTR activity. We next examined the ability of endogenous receptors present in HBACs to regulate transfected CFTR. Stimulation of I SC in response to apical adenosine (100 \u00b5M) in HBAC CFTR was qualitatively and quantatively similar to the forskolin response. While the above experiments provided evidence to suggest that HBAC CFTR cells possess the bioelectric capability of sustaining anion transport via nucleoside-stimulated CFTR activity, it does not guarantee a resultant vectorial flow of fluid. In the final series of experiments, we examined whether adenosine was indeed able to stimulate secretion across the HBAC-CFTR monolayer by assaying ASL height. Monolayers were loaded apically with FITC-labeled dextran (20 \u00b5l), and the majority of dye was then aspirated. Monolayers were then allowed to equilibrate over a 2 hour period, and ASL measured by XZ scanning on a Leica confocal microscope. ~100 \u00b5M adenosine and ~10 \u00b5M benzamil was then added apically in PFC and ASL height measured after 10 and 30 minutes. In both HBAC MOCK and HBAC-CFTR cells, the basal ASL height was ~4 \u00b5m. Over 30 minutes ASL height of HBAC MOCK cells did not change in response to adenosine.

To test whether increased CFTR activity resulted from changes in CFTR protein levels or localization we raised antibodies against zebrafish CFTR. Western-blot and immunolocalization studies revealed that the channel was expressed and localized as in wild type in bao mutant embryos indicating that the increased CFTR function most likely resulted from the activation of the channel.

The trachea of the adult CF mouse (cftr tm1Unc or cftr tm1Kth ) expresses little CFTR and exhibits neither a defect in cAMP-mediated Clsecretion nor hyperabsorption of Na + , both signature abnormalities in human CF airways. We generated a mouse exhibiting hyperabsorption of Na + in the airways by over-expressing the \u03b2 subunit of the epithelial Na + channel (\u03b2ENaC, gene Scnn1b). \u03b2ENaC mice exhibit airway pathology (decreased mucociliary transport, mucus plugging, and airway inflammation) similar to human CF airways. To determine whether inactivation of CFTR in \u03b2ENaC mice results in a more severe phenotype, we generated a CF/\u03b2ENaC mouse by crossing the \u2206F508 (C57BL/6N) mouse (CF mouse) with the \u03b2ENaC mouse (C57BL/6N). Survival analysis showed a drastic reduction in survival for CF/\u03b2ENaC mice in comparison to CF mice or \u03b2ENaC mice. We studied the airway bioelectrics of 3 day-old pups of each genotype. The basal short circuit current (I sc ) was ~5 fold greater in wild-type (WT) (50 \u00b1 13 \u00b5A . cm -2 ; mean \u00b1 SEM, n=4) vs. CF (12.2 \u00b5A . cm -2 , n=2) neonatal tracheas. As previously reported, the basal I sc in \u03b2ENaC preps was significantly elevated (99.2 \u00b1 14 \u00b5A . cm -2 , n=7) vs. WT tracheas. However, the basal I sc in the CF/\u03b2ENaC tracheas (26.6 \u00b1 19 \u00b5A . cm -2 , n=4) was intermediate between the CF and the \u03b2ENaC tracheas. The amiloride-sensitive I sc was elevated similarly in the tracheas of the \u03b2ENaC and CF/\u03b2ENaC pups and was ~ 3X greater than that exhibited by the WT or CF tracheas. The post-amiloride I sc was strikingly reduced in both CF and CF/\u03b2ENaC tracheas compared to the WT and \u03b2ENaC tracheas. We suggest that the post-amiloride I sc reflects constitutive CFTR-mediated Clsecretion, which may help hydrate airways in the neonate. Unlike the tracheas of adult CF mice, neonatal CF tracheas exhibited the classic defect in cAMP-mediated Clsecretion, with the forskolin response in the CF and CF/\u03b2ENaC tracheas being reduced ~10fold compared to the response in the WT or \u03b2ENaC preps. The response to UTP (Ca ++ -mediated Clsecretion) was similar in the four genotypes. Absence of CFTR-mediated Clsecretion does not appear to cause airway pathology in neonatal CF mice, but when this defect is coupled with Na + hyperabsorption, it results in a significant increase in neonatal mortality. Due to lack of CFTR-mediated Clsecretion, CF/\u03b2ENaC mice appear to experience greater mucus adhesion, producing death due to asphyxiation. In addition, the tracheas of CF mice (especially congenic C57Bl/6N) often appear constricted or collapsed due to a cartilaginous defect resulting in increased compliance. This anatomical defect does not appear to be detrimental to the CF mouse. However, in CF/\u03b2ENaC pups, that accumulate thick, sticky mucus in their tracheas, this tracheal constriction may contribute to their asphyxiation. These results demonstrate the importance of both abnormal Na + absorption and decreased Clsecretion in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Supported by NIH SCOR P50 HL060280. Recently, we reported that species-specific differences in the airway biology of rAAV transduction exist between mice and human (Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 2006, 34:56-64) . These differences significantly interfere with the use of mice as surrogate models for human lung gene therapy with certain rAAV serotypes. To survey which species might be an optimal animal model for rAAV preclinical testing, we utilized differentiated airway epithelia grown at an air-liquid interface (ALI) from five species (human, non-human primate [NHP] , pig, ferret, and mouse) to test the efficiency of transduction with three serotypes of rAAV (type 1, 2, and 5). Our results demonstrated significant species-specific differences in rAAV transduction biology in airway epithelia. The serotype preferences of rAAV transduction from the apical membrane in human, ferret, and pig epithelia was rAAV1>rAAV2\u2248rAAV5, different from that seen in mouse epithelia (rAAV1>>rAAV5>>rAAV2). Surprisingly, the profile of rAAV transduction with these three serotypes in NHP rhesus monkey airway epithelia (rAAV2\u2248rAAV5>>rAAV1) was less similar to human than pig and ferret. Additionally, rAAV1 lacked a bias in polarity of transduction in human airway epithelia, however, in NHP epithelia, rAAV1 transduced the basolateral membrane 10-fold more effectively than the apical membrane. Furthermore, differences in the properties of rAAV1 receptors between these species was also seen. Using neuraminidase treatment of the apical surface of ALI cultures, we tested whether N-linked sialic acids were potential receptors for rAAV1 binding and/or transduction. These studies demonstrated removal of N-linked sialic acids inhibited rAAV1 transduction of human, NHP, and mouse airway epithelia, but not ferret and pig. However, rAAV1 binding in this setting did not correlate with changes in transduction; neuraminidase treatment dramatically reduced rAAV1 binding to NHP epithelia, but enhanced binding to human epithelia (~100 fold). These findings suggest viral binding to airway epithelial cells may not be a major barrier for rAAV1 transduction. Evidence that proteasome-modulating agents enhancing rAAV transduction 2-3 logs for all serotypes and species tested, suggest that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway represents a common intracellular block in rAAV transduction of airway epithelia. These findings support the notion that viral interactions at the surface of airway epithelial cells (with co-receptors and receptors) influence intracellular processing AAV virions that can alter the efficiency of productive transduction. ENaC surface density in cortical collecting duct (CCD) epithelial cells is established by cAMP/PKA regulated insertion and retrieval of the channel at the apical membrane, together with the recycling of internalized ENaC back to the apical surface (Butterworth et al. (2005) Journal of General Physiology 125: 81-101). Ubiquitination by the Nedd4-2 ligase elicits endocytosis of surface ENaC, which may lead to its degradation. However, ENaC recycling to the apical surface requires ubiquitin removal by a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB).",

Specific inhibition of UCH-L3 (10\u00b5M of 4,5,6,7-Tetrachloroindan-1,3-dione) in filter-cultured CCD cells resulted in a rapid decline in ENaC currents, which was accelerated by forskolin stimulation, suggesting that UCH is responsible for recycling ENaC to the apical surface.

            "text": "To determine whether the same DUB was responsible for the regulation of ENaC in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) airway cells, differentiated cultures derived from CF and non-CF lung tissue were treated with the UCH inhibitor. To address the possibility that protease cleaved ENaC may be regulated differently from unprocessed channels, differentiated HBE cultures were either maintained at air/liquid interface or were submerged under liquid/liquid conditions to alter the cleavage state of ENaC, as we have previously described (Myerburg et al. (2006) Journal of Biological Chemistry 281: 27942-49). In all cases, no significant difference in ENaC-mediated Na+ transport was observed between control and UCH-L3 inhibited conditions. These data are in sharp contrast with the mechanisms of ENaC regulation observed in the CCD model system, and they support our previous findings that ENaC turnover and mode of regulation in HBE are distinct from the recycling mechanisms defined in the CCD epithelia (Butterworth et al. Primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (hTBE) cells cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) regulate ion transport, mucin secretion, and cilia beating to recapitulate directional mucus clearance, a key innate defense mechanism that fails in cystic fibrosis (CF). Thus, ALI hTBE cell cultures are crucial for studying CF pathogenesis and for developing/validating novel therapies. Different research centers use alternative protocols that enable reproducible creation of ALI hTBE cell cultures. However, limited primary hTBE cell availability has driven the creation of cognate cell lines, accomplished mainly by the introduction of viral oncogenes. Viral oncogenes disrupt normal cell physiology causing cellular hyperplasia, abundant apoptosis, genomic instability and, sometimes, poor polarization/differentiation, rendering the cells less useful than primary cells for assessing CFTR function. Furthermore, genetically unstable cell lines will continuously acquire changes independent of CFTR genotype. Bmi-1 is a polycomb group protein that controls cell cycle and cell identity via epigenetic regulation of chromatin, maintaining stem cells by suppressing expression of p16, an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases. Bmi-1 expression has been used to create cell lines that recapitulate normal cell structure and function better than viral oncogene-immortalized cell lines. Using HIV lentiviral vectors, we introduced Bmi-1 and the catalytic subunit of telomerase to enhance the growth of 3 different \u2206F508 homozygous CF and 3 non-CF primary human airway epithelial cell preparations. All 6 new cell lines grew for at least 40 population doublings, while their normal counterparts senesced prior to a maximum of 20 doublings. At passage 14-15, the new cell lines had a diploid karyotype compared to grossly abnormal chromosomes in cells immortalized by viral oncogenes. Ussing chamber analysis of ALI cultures at passage (p) 14-15 revealed variable transepithelial resistances among the cell lines ranging from 125 ->1000 \u2126*cm2, but short circuit current (Isc) responses stimulated by forskolin and inhibited by CFTR172 were true to the cell's genotype and comparable to early passage primary cells, except for one non-CF cell line with relatively low CFTR Isc's at p15. Amiloride sensitive and UTP-stimulated Isc's were present but were more variable in magnitude in comparison to the currents observed in low passage primary cells. ALI cultures exhibited a pseudostratified morphology with prominent apical membrane polarization, few apoptotic bodies, numerous mucous secretory cells and occasional ciliated cells. All CF and non-CF cell lines in culture produced similar levels of IL-8 at baseline and CF and non-CF cells equally increased IL-8 secretion in response to IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and the Tolllike 2 receptor agonist, Pam3Cys. These novel cell lines will help fill gaps currently hindering CF research and therapeutic development.",

We recently considered that domestic dogs could represent a large natural reservoir to search for CFTR mutations and, ultimately, to identify and breed animals with CF traits. The canine genome has been completely sequenced, and the canine CFTR gene, found on chromosome 14, consists of 27 exons spread over 163 kb. An animal model that faithfully expresses human CF lung pathology is critical for the development of effective treatments for this most lethal aspect of CF disease. While transgenic mouse models of CF replicate numerous aspects of CF disease, they unfortunately do not develop the characteristic lung pathology including mucus plugging of airways, chronic bacterial infections, and bronchiectasis. The reason for this is not completely understood but it is likely related to significant differences in lung morphology between these species. To date, no non-murine genetic model of CF has been developed, and naturally-occurring, CF-causing mutations have not been identified in any non-human animal species. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE), developed as a screening tool to identify sequence variations and mutations in the human CFTR gene, was used to screen dogs for CFTR mutations. DNA was purified from whole blood received from veterinary clinics treating dogs for a variety of ailments. We have performed TTGE analysis on DNA from 179 dogs, which includes 24 dogs with pancreatitis and 4 dogs with bronchiec-tasis, and have found hundreds of potential mutations amongst the thousands of amplicons tested. TTGE can detect single base pair changes within a fragment of DNA. As the temperature increases, the migrating DNA becomes partially melted, creating single stranded regions (internal bubbles and branched ends) that decrease its mobility through the gel. The DNA fragments have distinct melting profiles that are sequence dependent; therefore, changes in sequence of even a point mutation can alter the profile and result in a change in the rate of migration through the gel that can distinguish wild type from even a homozygous mutant. Thus far 65 exonic mutations have been sequenced but none have caused changes to CFTR at the amino acid level (i.e., the mutations have all been silent). We conclude that TTGE is a sensitive and effective method for screening large canine populations for CFTR mutations. ( Introduction: The search for \"correctors\" of defective protein processing of \u2206F508 CFTR has led to the development of high throughput screening assays to find compounds that promote the surface activity of the mutant protein. By necessity, primary screening assays typically use cell lines expressing recombinant \u2206F508 CFTR. However, \"hits\" identified in primary screening require scrutiny for false positives whose activity is either dependent on the \u2206F508 CFTR expression system or insufficiently robust to correct processing in the complex physiological setting of a native epithelium. To this end, we have developed a secondary functional assay that measures the shortcircuit current (Isc) responses in organ cultures of gallbladder mucosa from \u2206F508 CFTR mice (cftr tm1Kth ). Previous studies have shown that murine \u2206F508 CFTR recapitulates the protein processing defect including the capability to increase processing when mucosa is incubated at reduced temperature (27\u00b0C) (J. Clin. Invest. 98:1304 Invest. 98: , 1996 . Gallbladder mucosa was chosen for this assay because the murine gallbladder can be removed aseptically for organ culture, the epithelium is essentially a monolayer, and the mucosal wall is transparent which facilitates morphological assessment.",

Although cystic fibrosis is a multi-system disease, airway infection and inflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality in patients. Several homozygote null and missense CFTR mutations have been developed in mice, but they do not exhibit the lung phenotype observed in humans. In contrast to mice, the structure and physiology of porcine lung and airways closely resemble those of humans. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a swine model for cystic fibrosis by combining gene targeting and nuclear transfer to produce a pig with a CFTR null genotype. We employed homologous recombination to disrupt exon 10 of pig CFTR with a neomycin resistance cassette. We generated primary male fetal fibroblasts that were positive for CFTR-targeting at one allele as detected by multiple PCR screens. Genomic Southern blot analysis confirmed proper gene targeting and revealed most clones were free of random integration events. These cells were used for somatic cell nuclear transfer that resulted in the birth of ten CFTR null heterozygote piglets. Subsequent breeding of these male pigs to wild-type females has yielded at least 9 female CFTR null heterozygotes. Breeding male and female heterozygotes will provide CFTRnull homozygotes. Our recent published and preliminary studies demonstrate that mouse Slc26a9, a newly discovered member of Slc26 family of anion exchangers, is expressed on the apical membrane of tracheal epithelial cells and gastric surface epithelial cells and in the tubulovesicle membranes of gastric parietal cells. The functional properties of mouse Slc26a9 were examined in Xenopus Oocytes and in stably transfected cultured cells. In Xenopus Oocytes injected with the Slc26a9 cRNA and studied with the voltage and/or pH sensitive microelectrodes, the rank order for anion selectivity at +80mV was Cl->I-> NO3->gluconate > sulfate, and that of the selectivity (Px/PCl) was I-> Cl-> NO3-= gluconate > sulfate. Inhibitor profile studies demonstrated that NPPB at 100 \u00b5M inhibited the current at 5 min by 40% (p<0.001 compared to control period, n=6). The effect of NPPB was partly reversible. DIDS at 500 \u00b5M had no significant effect on the Slc26a9-mediated current (p>0.05 compared to control period, n=6). Niflumic acid at 100 \u00b5M inhibited the current at 5 min by ~38% (p<0.001 compared to control period, n=5) which was partly reversible. CFTR inh 172 at 5\u00b5M inhibited the current at 5 min by ~23% (p<0.005 compared to control period, n=5) which was reversible. Clamping currents in a 85 mM K-gluconate medium and using 10 mM K-Cl or K-bicarbonate revealed very low bicarbonate conductance for Slc26a9 compared to that of Cl-. No significant pHi changes were observed in oocytes when favoring Cl-exit by substituting perfusate Cl-with gluconate in the presence of CO2/HCO3-. Conversely we observed significant alkalinization in AE1-expressing oocytes in the same experimental solutions. Interestingly, in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the mouse Slc26a9, a significant intracellular alkalinization was observed upon switching to a chloride-free perfusate. The alkalization in Slc26a9-expressing cells was inhibited by ~55% in the presence of 500 \u00b5M DIDS. Baseline intracellular pH was significantly increased in Slc26a9expressing HEK293 cells vs. non transfected cells. However, baseline pHi was comparable in control and Slc26a9-expressing cells in the presence of 100 \u00b5M EIPA, indicating the activation of endogenous NHE by Slc26a9. In conclusion, Slc26a9 displays characteristics of an anionic channel in xenopus oocytes, with low bicarbonate permeability. In mammalian expression systems, Slc26a9 can also function in Cl-/HCO3-exchange mode with moderate sensitivity to inhibition by DIDS. We propose that Slc26a9 plays an important role in anion (chloride) secretion and/or pH regulation in tracheal and gastric epithelial cells. No cell lines exist at present that robustly express endogenous wt and \u2206F508 CFTR on the same genetic background. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) allow the introduction of specific genetic changes at loci within the human genome (Nature 435: [646] [647] [648] [649] [650] [651] 2005) . We have been using this technology in an attempt to generate human cells carrying the major CF-causing genotype -\u2206F508 -at the endogenous CFTR locus. Such lines could be expected to provide better understanding of the \u2206F508 maturational processing defect, as well as new model systems for cell based assays of \u2206F508 repair. We performed a bioinformatic analysis of CFTR exon 10, and designed multiple distinct ZFNs against the \u2206F508 DNA sequence. All of these nucleases were assembled, cloned into mammalian expression vectors, and assayed for DNA binding affinity and specificity. The ZFNs were then assayed for endogenous CFTR locus editing in Calu-3 and HT-29 cells using a novel, massively parallel methodology applied for the detection of genome editing events. The effort demonstrated that specific ZFN pairs successfully bind to, and cleave, within exon 10 of the endogenous CFTR locus in both cell types. We will describe experiments that yielded optimized ZFNs for the CFTR locus, and a robust viral platform to transiently deliver genome editing reagents to the human pulmonary cell line, Calu-3. Supported by CFF. The localization of Slc26 anion transporters, as well as their function vary among members. Some (Slc26a2, Slc26a3, Slc26a6, Slc26a11) are widespread, implying specific physiological function in diverse tissues. Others are expressed only in a single epithelia, e.g., Slc26a5 (prestin) in the inner ear. We have previously found that Slc26a9 is a highly electrogenic Cl --HCO 3 exchanger with a large anion conductance. To determine the possible physiologic roles of Slc26a9, we developed a chicken antibody (designed against sulfate transporter and anti-sigma domain, STAS, of Slc26a9) to localize the protein. To test the antibody specificity for functional protein, we inject Xenopus oocytes with cRNA for Slc26a6, Slc26a7 or Slc26a9 and documented appropriate pH and membrane potential changes. Only oocytes functionally expressing Slc26a9 were stained using our primary Slc26a9 antibody. Further, specific staining was eliminated when either pre-immune serum or blocking peptide was used. Slc26a9 was only found in epithelia. In the respiratory system, Slc26a9 was in the apical membrane of nasal epithelial cells and tracheal submucosal glands. Membranes of CaLu-3 cells, derived from human tracheal submucosal glands, stained indicating that our antibody also recognizes the human SLC26A9 protein. Slc26a9 is found in the proximal parts of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach), with lesser amounts in the small intestine and colon. However, Slc26a9 is not present in liver. Slc26a9 is present in ducts of secretory epithelia such as salivary glands and pancreas. In the urinary tract, Slc26a9 is localized to the renal proximal tubule apical membrane but not in urinary bladder. In the reproductive system, we found Slc26a9 in epithelia of the uterus and seminal vesicles but not the vas deference or the prostate. Finally, Slc26a9 is found on the eye surface, i.e., corneal epithelial cells. Together, these results and the varied Slc26a9 physiology suggest that several epithelial function models will need to be re-evaluated to incorporate an electrogenic Cl --HCO 3 exchanger and/or another apical anion channel.

The mechanism(s) underlying this observation, and whether elevated or repressed TGF\u03b2 are responsible, are not known. In addition, the pathogenic role of TGF\u03b2 in other CF organs and in murine models of the disease has not been well studied. Because the TGF\u03b2 codon 10 CC genotype is associated with worsened CF pulmonary prognosis, and since high levels of TGF\u03b2 are also known to suppress CFTR mRNA expression and apical CFTR protein expression in colonic epithelia (Howe et al., Exp Cell Res, 2004) , we developed a mouse model to test TGF\u03b2/CFTR interactions that may directly influence CF phenotype. We bred \u2206F508 heterozygous mice (Cftr tm1Kth , \u2206F508 CFTR) against the TGF\u03b2 receptor-deficient murine strain (MTRII28). MTRII28 mice express a dominant-negative mutant form of the TGF\u03b2 type II receptor which lacks the intracellular (kinase) receptor domain. The receptor binds TGF\u03b2, but fails to transmit a TGF\u03b2 dependent signal. The TGF\u03b2 receptor transgene was inserted downstream of a metallothionein-derived promoter and expressed in numerous murine tissues following induction with 25 mM ZnSO 4 in drinking water. An antibody raised against active TGF\u03b2 (LC-1-30-1, gift of Dr. Kathy Flanders, National Cancer Institute) was used to establish TGF\u03b2 in murine tissues including lung and intestinal tract of the MTRII28 strain. RT-PCR confirmed high level transgene expression similar to gapdh internal control. Nasal potential difference measurements in CFTR +/+ mice expressing the TGF\u03b2 transgene indicated intact cAMP dependent Cltransport following induction of the dominant-negative receptor. Homozygous CF animals deficient for TGF\u03b2 signaling have recently been obtained and exhibit the expected litter sizes and distribution of the \u2206F508 allele. Studies of CF homozygous mice following induction with ZnSO 4 are in progress, and will be used to determine whether a failure to signal through TGF\u03b2 in vivo 1) influences the severity of CF intestinal disease, 2) alters airway or intestinal bioelectric findings characteristic of CF, or 3) changes survival, histopathology or other features of the disease. These experiments are intended to provide an in vivo means of investigating TGF\u03b2 signaling and resultant CF modifier effects in vivo. Supported by NIH and CFF. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the ABPA phenotype observed in CFTR mice was preventable by corrective gene replacement, we delivered AAV5 CFTR to the lung. In addition to further assess whether CFTR-/-lymphocytes alone where responsible for the phenotype, we performed adoptive transfers of CFTR-/-lymphocytes into CFTR+/+ mice and proceeded to expose the mice to the ABPA model.",

Epithelial cells lining the vas deferens express cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 when exposed to testosterone in vivo, although no functional link to ion transport has been established. We hypothesized that testosterone modulates CFTR-mediated anion secretion across vas deferens epithelia that is stimulated via COX-dependent pathways. Vas deferens epithelial cells were isolated from human and porcine tissues and cultured as monolayers on permeable supports until assayed in modified Ussing chambers. RNA was isolated concurrently for semi-quantitative gene expression analysis. Bradykinin (BK) caused an increase in anion secretion (measured as short circuit current) and this effect was inhibited by indomethacin, which indicates COX dependency. Testosterone treated monolayers exhibited a BKinduced response that is 58% greater than paired vehicle treated monolayers. qRT-PCR revealed that COX-2 mRNA is 19 times more abundant than COX-1 mRNA in cultured vas deferens epithelial cells. The effects of BK on ion transport are inhibited by the B2 receptor antagonist HOE140 while the B1 receptor agonist Des-Arg9-BK produced no effect. Prostaglandin E2 and selective agonists of the EP4 (1-OH-PGE1) and EP2 (butaprost) receptors produced concentration dependent increases in short circuit current whereas sulprostone, an agonist of EP1 and EP3 receptors, had no effect. Taken together, these results suggest that testosterone plays a key permissive role for BK-stimulated anion secretion by inducing COX-2 expression. Bradykinin acts at the B2 receptor to increase COX-2 activity and the synthesis of prostaglandins that ultimately bind to EP receptors to promote CFTR-dependent HCO3-and Cl-secretion that would be expected to modify the environment for sperm. The results further suggest that developmentally associated increases in testosterone levels during gestation and puberty will produce physiological changes in vas deferens luminal environment that are likely compromised in cystic fibrosis patients.",

            "text": "Discussion: Profound differences in cytokine production were measured in stimulated splenocyte responses of CF in comparison to B6 mice. The profiles did support the notion for a prominent T H 2 response, with the potential to interference of normal macrophage activation. In addition, differences in cytokine production profiles appear related to the nature of adaptive and innate stimuli provided (ConA vs. LPS). The absence of influence by glucose concentration in vitro suggests that local/immediate concentration of glucose is not relevant to prolonged expression of cytokine responses to stimuli. Further studies on the impact of chronic hyperglycemia and its relation to immune response are necessary. An improved understanding of these mechanisms holds hope for a better overall outcome in patients with CF and CFRD. Studies from different laboratories to characterize \u2206F508 CFTR Clchannel activity have yielded disparate results, likely due to variations in technique, cell type, or method of analysis. In the present study, we compared \u2206F508 CFTR activation in two well characterized polarizing cell models. Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells have been used in high-throughput drug screening to identify \u2206F508 CFTR active agents, whereas CFBE41ocells have been transduced to provide robust \u2206F508 CFTR expression in an airway epithelial background. \u2206F508 CFTR biogenesis following low temperature correction was compared, indicating qualitatively similar levels of CFTR transcripts and Band B and C CFTR. In paired studies in Ussing chambers, distinct differences in Isc were seen following exposure to CFTR activating stimuli. In FRT cell monolayers grown at 37\u00b0C, forskolin (20 \u00b5M) or genistein (50 \u00b5M) were strong stimuli of Isc, producing mean Isc of 13.0 +/-6.6 (forskolin) and 18.6 +/-7.2 (genistein) \u00b5A/cm 2 . Regardless of exposure sequence, both agents induced equivalent changes in maximal current (59% of 42.2 \u00b5A/cm 2 by forskolin when administered prior to genistein; 54% of 44.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 by forskolin in converse order). Growth at 27\u00b0C for 24 hours increased currents approximately 3.7 fold, but relative contributions of the two stimuli were similar to cells grown at 37\u00b0C (42% of total current stimulated by forskolin). In CFBE41o -\u2206F508 cells grown at 37\u00b0C, forskolin-dependant currents were minimal and genistein-stimulated currents small (4.2 +/-1.4 \u00b5A/cm 2 , compared to zero current in parental, nontransduced CFBE41ocells, p<0.05). In temperature-corrected \u2206F508 CFBE41ocells, forskolin was a poor stimulus of Cl-transport relative to genistein, contributing 15% to the total current produced by both agents (p<0.001). Genistein-stimulated currents did not require pre-treatment with forskolin to produce maximal effects (28.8 \u00b5A/cm 2 with genistein alone vs. 31.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 after forskolin and genistein), and forskolin did not cause further Isc when added after genistein (0 \u00b5A/cm 2 ). Levels of cAMP did not account for these differences, since forskolin markedly increased cAMP in both models. To determine whether excessive phosphodiesterase (PDE) or phosphatase (PP) activity limited \u2206F508 CFTR activation by forskolin in the CFBE41o -\u2206F508 cells, monolayers were pretreated with the nonspecific PDE inhibitor papaverine (100 \u00b5M) or the PP2 inhibitor endothall (400 \u00b5M), each sufficient to activate Isc in CFBE41oexpressing wtCFTR (papverine: 59.8 vs. 1.3 \u00b5A/cm 2 with vehicle, p<0.005; endothal: 40.1 vs. 8.8 uA/cm 2 , p=0.05). Neither agent restored Isc in \u2206F508 CFBE41oby forskolin (0.8 mV difference, p=NS). These results indicate that activity of \u2206F508 CFTR in polarizing monolayers is exquisitely dependant on the model chosen for study. Substantial differences in \u2206F508 CFTR behavior in two commonly used cell models, and suggest that the failure of cAMP to activate \u2206F508 CFTR in CFBE41ocells is due to cell-specific factors that may 1) influence \u2206F508 CFTR folding and tertiary structure, or 2) favor interactions of \u2206F508 CFTR with inhibitory binding partners that limit activation by cAMP. Adverse immune responses to viral vectors or vector-encoded proteins may hinder the practical application of gene therapy. To date, little effort has been devoted to determining the immunological consequences of topically delivered lentiviral vectors to respiratory epithelia. Previously, we demonstrated that an integrating feline immunodeficiency virus-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with a baculoviral envelope glycoprotein (GP64-FIV) readily transduced differentiated airway epithelia in vitro when applied to the apical surface. Furthermore, using a luciferase reporter gene and bioluminescence imaging, we observed in vivo gene transfer to murine nasal epithelia following a single application of GP64-FIV. Longitudinal bioluminescence analysis documented persistent expression in nasal epithelia for greater than 11 months without significant decline. By histological analysis, surface epithelial cells were transduced following a single nasal application of GP64-FIV expressing beta-galactosidase. Importantly, we observed that 7 consecutive doses of GP64-FIV delivered over 7 consecutive days greatly increased the number of beta-galactosidase positive epithelial cells. Using quantitative bioluminescent imaging, we observed that repeated doses given over consecutive days resulted in a linear additive increase in gene expression. In addition, we performed studies investigating gene transfer efficacy and immune responses following lentiviral vector readministration with greater intervening time periods. In control mice, we observed that giving 4 nasally instilled doses (2 weeks apart) of an E1/E3 deleted Ad5 vector resulted in significantly attenuated expression after the second dose. The attenuated expression correlated to the production of neutralizing antibodies. In contrast, using the same delivery protocol, 4 doses of GP64-FIV resulted in gene transfer without loss of expression of the forth dose. No significant production of neutralizing antibodies was observed following the lentiviral delivery protocol. We further report the additive increase in reporter gene expression following 7 doses of lentiviral vector delivered over 7 consecutive weeks (1 dose/week), as well as the lack of production of systemic and local neutralizing antibodies. GP64-FIV efficiently transduces and persistently expresses a transgene in respiratory epithelia and has the potential for repeat administration without eliciting adverse immune responses. These data have important implications for the application of lentiviral gene therapy to pulmonary diseases. Uniform delivery of gene therapy vectors to all lung lobes is important for CF gene therapy. However, this important objective has not been achieved in large animals. To address this obstacle, we have developed an approach to specifically deliver vector into all lung lobes. In this strategy, an intracorporeal nebulizing catheter (Aero-Probe) is inserted into a bronchoscope to permit visual targeted aerosolization of vector specifically into each lung lobe. Using this approach, 2 ml of 0.1% LPC (to transiently open tight junctions) containing 1x1012 vp of HDAd-K18LacZ was sequentially aerosolized into each of the six major lung lobes of a baboon. Aerosolization was triggered by the ventilator upon inspiration at 0.1 ml/pulse at a rate of 8 to 10 pulses/min. Halfway through the procedure a very slight, transient and fluctuating decrease in oxygen saturation of no more than 2% was noted that did not warrant supplemental oxygen. The entire procedure was otherwise uneventful and well tolerated with no clinical manifestations of toxicity. No changes in chest X-rays taken at 6 h, 24 h and at necropsy 72 h post-vector were observed compared to baseline. X-gal staining of the lungs at 72 h revealed extensive transduction of the epithelium in the large and small airways in all six major targeted lung lobes. X-gal histochemistry revealed substantial transduction that was exclusively restricted to the airway epithelial cells and submucosal glands, the target cells for CF gene therapy. Assessment of the proximal major bronchi from each lung lobe revealed that~20% of the airway epithelial cells were transduced in the Left Upper Lobe (LUL), \u2265 90% were transduced in the LML, LLL, RUL, RML and RLL, and~80% were transduced in the accessory lobe. Approximately 70% of the airway epithelial cells in the tracheal sections examined were transduced. We also investigated the duration of pulmonary transgene expression. In these studies, we aerosolized a HDAd expressing the baboon \u03b1-fetoprotein from the K18 promoter into the lungs of baboons. By measuring serum bAFP levels, we found that pulmonary transgene expression from transduced airway epithelial cells can be detected for at least 177 days post-vector. These results demonstrate for the first time that exceedingly high levels of transduction of the airway epithelial cells and submucosal glands throughout all lung lobes in a large animal can be achieved with negligible toxicity resulting in long term trangene expression and should pave the way towards successful clinical CF gene therapy. Inefficient gene transfer after repeat administration of most viral vectors has limited their suitability for CF gene therapy. However, lentiviral vectors are reported to be less immunogenic. This property combined with their capacity to integrate into the genome of transduced cells and, therefore, allowing gene expression for the life-time of the cell (approximately 3 months for airway epithelial cells and theoretically unlimited for stem cells) justify further investigation of these vectors for CF gene therapy. To ensure high transduction efficiency in the lung without the need for any pre-conditioning strategies we pseudotyped a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm)-based vector with the Sendai virus F and HN proteins (F/HN-SIV-GFP) and transduced mouse nasal epithelium (4x10e8 TU/mouse). At this titre transduction efficiency along the nasal septum was up to 5% when measured 10 and 30 days after transduction (n=4/time-point). The vast majority (approx. 80%) of GFP positive cells across all time-points were respiratory epithelial cells followed by neuronal and sustenticular cells (approx. 20%) in the olfactory epithelium. Interestingly, we observed two types of duration patterns of GFP expression in mouse nose. In some mice the number of GFP positive cells decreased over time (day 30: 218\u00b117 cells/section, n=4, day 360: 19\u00b117 cells/section, n=6). However, in other mice strong GFP expression persisted for up to 360 days (day 360: 159\u00b181 cells/section, n=4), significantly longer than the proposed life-span of airway epithelial cells. In order to support the idea of F/HN-SIV integration into nasal respiratory stem/progenitor cells we artificially induced cell division after SIV vector transduction by damaging the nasal tissue with the detergent (polidocanol), which strips of the epithelium within a few hours, while retaining the basal cell layer. The epithelium completely regenerates over the course of a few days. Seven and 28 days after the vector transduction (4x10e8 TU/mouse, n=3) the nasal tissue was perfused with 2% polidocanol (10 \u00b5l/mouse) and gene expression was analyzed 4 weeks after the last detergent treatment. GFP expression was detectable in various cell types of the regenerating epithelium including ciliated and basal cells. Importantly, GFP-expressing cells were more clustered after polidocanol treatment, possibly indicating origination from a common progenitor. These data suggest that, F/HN-SIV integration may have occurred into differentiated airway epithelial cells as well as into stem/progenitor cells involved in the regeneration of the airway epithelium. Introduction: Hypersecretion of mucus is a major cause of airway obstruction in cystic fibrosis, asthma and chronic bronchitis. Though mucus is a complex, non-homogeneous mixture of secretions, one group of its constituents, the mucous glycoproteins or mucins, contributes greatly to the obstruction associated with airway diseases. Currently, there are a limited number of therapeutic agents available for controlling mucin overproduction and hypersecretion. The objective of this study is to develop a sensitive, cost-effective technique for reliably quantifying total mucin concentration in a robust mucin-secreting cell line for use in high throughput screening of small molecule compounds with potential to inhibit mucin secretion.",

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease in North America, where it occurs with a frequency of one in ~2200 live births. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, the most common being the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (delF508). The delF508 mutation causes a folding defect that inhibits maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane, however the mutant still functions as a chloride ion channel when delivered to the plasma membrane, and partial rescue (15-20%) may be sufficient to alleviate disease symptoms. Thus CFTR is an attractive target for the development of pharmaceutical therapies.",

In this study we have extended the approach to natural products by studying 720 extracts derived from marine sponges that were collected from the coasts of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Sponges are a particularly rich source of novel bioactives and secondary metabolites. Iterative use of our high throughput assay and chemical deconvolution of active fractions yielded four alkaloids JMCG1102, JMCG1103, JMCG1104 and JMCG1105. These compounds caused a detectable increase in delF508 CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane within 6 h, and after exposure to 10 pM for 24 h all four increased surface delF508 CFTR expression 10-30% and enhanced cAMP-stimulated halide conductance. We tested a series of analogues of the alkaloids and found three others JMCG1106, JMCG1107 and JMCG1108 that also caused trafficking correction and functional ion channels in the plasma membrane. These results were confirmed in functional studies of the human bronchial epithelial cell-line CFBE stably overexpressing delF508 CFTR. These compounds increased surface delF508 CFTR by 15-80% within 6 h when treated with 1nM. These results identify a promising group of delF508 CFTR trafficking correctors that are now being actively pursued as potential pharmacotherapeutics for cystic fibrosis along with other hits from compound library screening campaigns.

Fluorophore-conjugated peptides appear to be concentrated in vesicular compartments, consistent with the current hypothesis that CPP-peptides enter cells into endosomal vesicles via macropinocytosis from which efflux into the cytosol occurs (Wadia et al. Nature Med, 2004) . We determined that treatment of cell cultures with CPP-CF-RXR peptide at a final concentration [1 \u00b5M] for 90 minutes is effective in inducing cell surface functional expression of human \u2206F508-CFTR in BHK cells as observed by a 2.3-fold increase in cyclic AMP-mediated iodide efflux over control \u2206F508-CFTR (n=6; p < 0.01). This rescue is specific to the CF-RXR peptide as controls (CPP alone or peptides bearing a KXK motif in place of RXR) show no functional rescue of \u2206F508-CFTR (n=6; p > 0.05). Preliminary cyclic AMPmediated iodide efflux results also indicate that \u2206F508-CFTR functional rescue by CPP-CF-RXR peptide is as effective as temperature (27 o C) rescue. Although we hypothesize that the peptide acts to facilitate trafficking of the major mutant to the cell surface, immunoblotting studies fail to show a clear conversion of the ER-form (Band B) to the fully processed, Band C form of the protein.

            "text": "Discussion: Future efforts include investigating the relative efficacy of peptides corresponding to the four different RXR motifs in rescuing \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking. The promising candidate described above is currently being evaluated with respect to functional rescue of the major mutant in primary human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from patients homozygous for \u2206F508-CFTR (Joseph Zabner and Phil Karp, University of Iowa) and in Cftr-\u2206F508 mice. These studies may provide the basis for future pre-clinical studies of peptide based therapies of Cystic Fibrosis (supported by CCFF (BREATHE Program Grant) and CIHR -(Strategic Training Program in the Structural Biology of Membrane Proteins Linked to Disease)). Several promising methods of promoting \u2206F508 CFTR escape from ER degradation increase CFTR chloride channel activity at the cell surface. However, increasing data from a number of laboratories indicate that in both epithelial and non-epithelial cell lines expressing \u2206F508 CFTR, the rescued chloride channel is unstable at the cell surface compared to wild-type CFTR. Small molecule correctors have therefore become a widely used approach to enhance \u2206F508 CFTR function at the cell surface. In most cases, the exact mechanism of these promising compounds has not been established. In the present study, we use stably transfected, polarized CFBE41o-cells to elucidate the effect of two of these compounds, CFcor-325 and Corr-4a, on the surface stability of wild type and low temperature rescued \u2206F508 CFTR. Specifically, we cultured cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR at 27C for 48 hours to establish a large pool of surface-expressed \u2206F508 CFTR; we then monitored CFTR internalization rates and half-life with and without small molecule treatment using surface biotinylation-based assays, performed as described previously (Jurkuvenaite et al. J. Biol. Chem. 281:3329, 2006) . As a control, internalization and half-life of transferrin receptor was also followed. Our results indicate that both CFcor-325 and Corr-4a slow \u2206F508 CFTR endocytosis from ~30%/2.5 min to ~5%/2.5 min, and this is similar to wild type CFTR internalization rates. Neither wild type CFTR nor transferrin receptor internalization rates were affected by corrector treatment, suggesting that the effects of the correctors were specific for \u2206F508 CFTR. In the surface half-life studies, both correctors doubled \u2206F508 CFTR halflife from 2 to 4 hours, but they did not correct the half-life to wild type levels (~8 h). Again, the correctors had no effect on either wild type CFTR or transferrin receptor surface half-lives. Our results suggest that small molecule correctors may not only rescue CFTR from ERAD during biogenesis, but can contribute to the stabilization of \u2206F508 CFTR at the cell surface, and this effect seems to be \u2206F508 CFTR-specific. The \u2206F508 mutation in CFTR causes defects in chloride channel gating and cellular processing. Cell cultures models suggest the need for both a potentiator and corrector to restore \u2206F508-CFTR channel function and processing, respectively. Previously, we identified several classes of potentiators, including 'phenylglycines', which probably bind to CFTR at the cell surface and restore normal channel gating (Pedemonte et al., Mol. Pharm. 2005; 67:1797 -1807 . We also identified several classes of correctors, including 'bisaminomethylbithiazoles', which may bind to \u2206F508-CFTR in the ER and partially restore its folding and plasma membrane targeting (Pedemonte, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115:2564 -2571 . These compounds were identified from screening a diverse collection of 150,000 small molecules; the most active potentiator was phenylglycine PG01 {2-[(2-1H-indol-3-ylacetyl)-methyl-amino]-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)-2-phenyl-acetamide} and the most potent corrector was the bisaminomethylbithiazole Corr-4a {N- (2-[5-chloro-2-methoxyphenylamino]-4'-methyl-4,5'-bithiazol-2'yl) benzamide}. Here we synthesized and characterized a hybrid molecule (Corr-4a-linker-PG01) containing both corrector and potentiator fragments. Based on SAR data of potentiators and correctors, a hybrid molecule was designed that incorporated an enzymatically hydrolysable linker to generate and deliver the potentiator and corrector-linker fragments. Using synthetic organic chemistry we synthesized a hybrid molecule containing a PG01-OH moiety and a Corr-4a-linker-COOH moiety, linked with an ethylene glycol spacer through an ester bond. The potentiator and corrector fragments (after cleavage) had low micromolar potency or better. However, the intact hybrid molecule was inactive, likely because of its large size (990 daltons) and hence poor cell penetration. As proof-of-principle evidence that the hybrid molecule can be hydrolyzed to the active fragments, treatment with carbonic anhydrase or rodent stool specimens gave the appropriate potentiator and corrector-linker fragments identified by LCMS. Smallmolecule corrector-potentiator hybrids have potential utility as single drug therapy for CF caused by the \u2206F508 mutation. Supported by CFF and NIH. CFTR is a chloride channel gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis at its two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). The two NBDs may dimerize in a head-to-tail configuration, as observed in other ABC transporters, forming two ATP binding pockets (ABP1 and ABP2), with the ATP molecules buried at the dimer interface. ABP2, formed by the Walker A and B motifs of NBD2 and the signature sequence of NBD1, was proposed as the site critical for the ATP-dependent opening of the CFTR channel, while ABP1 (consisting of the Walker A and B motifs of NBD1 and the signature sequence of NBD2) may contribute to the stabilization of the open channel conformation. G551D, the third most common CF-associated mutation, is characterized by a very low open probability, and patients carrying this mutation present a severe phenotype. This mutation is located in the signature sequence of NBD1 (and thus in ABP2). We have recently characterized this mutant channel and found that its low activity is ATP-independent. This behavior corroborates with the idea that the occupancy of ABP2 by ATP is crucial for catalyzing the opening of the channel. Interestingly, we now found that a high affinity ATP analog, N 6 -(2-phenylethyl)-ATP (P-ATP), increases G551D currents primarily by increasing the open time of the channel. This effect of P-ATP is reduced when P-ATP was applied together with ATP, suggesting a competition between ATP and P-ATP for a common binding site. Introducing the mutation Y1219G (located at ABP2), which reduces by more than 50-fold the ATP-binding affinity in wild-type channels, does not alter the effect of P-ATP in the G551D/Y1219G mutant. In contrast, when we introduce the mutation W401G (located at ABP1) in the G551D background, the effect of P-ATP is reduced remarkably, suggesting that ABP1 is the binding site where P-ATP binds to increase the activity of G551D channels. These new results further confirm the idea that nucleotide binding at ABP1 could stabilize the open channel conformation. Since the competition experiments show that ATP and P-ATP are readily exchanged in the binding site, we conclude that the ATP molecule is not occluded in ABP1, at least under the G551D background. Our observation that P-ATP enhances the G551D activity by binding at ABP1 implicates that ABP1 can potentially be a target for drugs to bind and increase the channel activity.",

            "text": "Van Goor, F.; Hadida, S.; Grootenhuis, P. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA Several CF-causing mutations, including \u2206F508, G551D, and R117H, cause gating defects in CFTR that decrease the open probability (Po) of the channel, resulting in decreased Cl-secretion across epithelia of multiple organs, including the lung. A therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CF is to develop pharmacological potentiators that increase Po leading to increased fluid transport in affected tissues. VX-770 was identified through cell-based screening and chemistry optimization as a potent potentiator of CFTR, including \u2206F508-, G551D-, and R117H-CFTR. In single-channel recordings of CFTR expressed in Fisher rat thyroid cells, VX-770 increased the Po of \u2206F508-CFTR from 0.11 \u00b1 0.05 to 0.45 \u00b1 0.06. The Po of G551D increased from 0.08 \u00b1 0.03 -0.52 \u00b1 0.19. These levels are similar to the Po of wild-type CFTR, indicating that VX-770 restores normal gating at the single channel level. To assess the potency and efficacy of VX-770 in native airway cells, Cl-secretion was monitored in Ussing chamber studies using human bronchial epithelia (HBE) cultured from the bronchi of CF and non-CF donors. In the absence of the potentiator VX-770, CFTR-mediated Clsecretion in \u2206F508/\u2206F508or G551D/\u2206F508-HBE reached a maximum amplitude of 2.6 \u00b1 0.5 and 2.7 \u00b1 0.2 uA/cm2, respectively. This is ~5% of that observed in wild-type-HBE (56 \u00b1 6 uA/cm2) and consistent with the low level of residual CFTR activity reported in some individuals with severe CF disease. In \u2206F508/\u2206F508-HBE, VX-770 caused a 2-fold increase (peak response; 5.5 \u00b1 0.5 uA/cm2) in CFTR mediated Cl-secretion with an EC50 of 33 \u00b1 8 nM, whereas in G551D/\u2206F508-HBE, Cl-secretion increased 14fold (peak response; 36 \u00b1 3 uA/cm2) with an EC50 of 600 \u00b1 200 nM. The improved efficacy observed in G551D/\u2206F508-HBE is consistent with a higher cell surface density of G551D-CFTR compared to \u2206F508-CFTR, which has defective trafficking to the cell membrane. VX-770 was found to be highly selective for CFTR and to have good oral bioavailability in multiple species with a half-life of 6 -14 hours. The biological and pharmacokinetic data support the clinical development of VX-770 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

As tabulated below, mean systemic exposure to tobramycin from the PARI eFlow rapid on day 15 was slightly lower, by 14%, whereas mean sputum exposure was higher, by 80%, compared with the PARI LC Plus. Consequently, the therapeutic ratio was nearly 2-fold higher for the PARI eFlow rapid due mainly to higher sputum concentrations. Adverse events occurred in 16 patients using the PARI LC Plus nebulizer (primarily headache and abdominal pain) and in 19 patients using the PARI eFlow rapid nebulizer (primarily headache, cough, dyspnea).

            "text": "Sponsored by Novartis Pharma AG which acknowledges support from PARI GmbH INTRODUCTION Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein protecting lung tissues by inhibition of neutrophil elastase. The function of neutrophil elastase is to digest bacteria and other foreign objects in the lungs. In a person deficient of AAT, the neutrophil elastase acts uncontrolled, destroying healthy tissue. The result of the damage is emphysema, which progresses if not treated. Patients show a specific impaired breathing pattern of short inhalation followed by prolonged exhalation. Current therapy consists of weekly i.v. infusion of AAT of about 60-90 mg/kg body weight. By this method only about 2% of the administered dose is estimated to reach the lungs. Since AAT can currently be derived only from human blood serum by an expensive purification process, the worldwide supplies are limited and do not allow to treat all patients. An improvement of the delivery efficiency is highly desirable. Inhaled treatment would offer a targeted therapy by delivering AAT directly to the lungs and allow for a better use of the limited drug. The eFlow \u00ae , a novel electronic nebulizer, is more efficient than conventional nebulizers. It operates by means of a perforated vibrating membrane, applying no or only little stress to the nebulized substances. Hence it is well suited for the pulmonary delivery of proteins. It has been shown previously, that a 2% AAT solution can be nebulized by eFlow \u00ae without a loss of biological activity. We investigated two eFlow \u00ae configurations comparing the in-vitro delivered dose for different breathing patterns.",

University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA Introduction: Percent change from baseline in a continuous outcome variable, such as lung function, is a useful descriptive measure in therapeutic clinical trials. While often favored by clinicians as the primary efficacy measure, the use of percent change as the basis for statistical comparisons raises a number of issues. Defined as 100*(Post-Pre)/Pre, where Pre and Post represent baseline and follow-up values, respectively, percent change is a ratio of random variables and as such, does not follow a normal distribution. Analyzing percent change with standard methods can result in inefficiences and may be inappropriate without a suitable transformation (e.g., logarithmic). Furthermore, the treatment effect estimated on the transformed scale is difficult to interpret. The purpose of this abstract is to describe an alternative method for analyzing percent change and illustrate its utility in CF clinical trials.",

We previously showed that rhodamine labeled DNA nanoparticles enter primary human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cells within 15 min, and accumulate in the nucleus in 1 hr, where the transgene can be expressed. DNA nanoparticles do not enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which leads to the degradation of internalized material in lysosomes. Further characterization of the kinetics and trafficking pathway may allow us to improve the formulation of the nanoparticles and facilitate its gene delivery. As they do in HTE cells, rhodamine labeled DNA nanoparticles enter HeLa and 16HBEo-, an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, within 15 min, and by 1-4 hr accumulate in the nucleus, especially the nucleolus, where they colocalize with nucleolin. Expression of the GFP reporter gene in the nanoparticles was observed at 18 hr, which confirms the functionality of the labeled DNA nanoparticles. Cellular entry is energy dependent, as little or no intracellular rhodamine was observed at 4\u00b0C by 4 hr. We also applied rhodamine labeled nanoparticles and biotin-conjugated transferrin, a marker for CME, simultaneously. Little colocalization was observed during a 15 min to 4 hr time course, so the nanoparticles do not follow this pathway.",

We therefore costained nucleolin in both HeLa and 16HBEo-cells treated with the rhodamine labeled DNA nanoparticle. The rhodamine fluorescence colocalizes with nucleolin both in the cytoplasm at early time points and in the nucleus/nucleolus at 1 hr and 4 hr, which further supports that nucleolin might be associated with the nanoparticles during their trafficking. To confirm this association, we performed uptake experiments with MS-3, a mouse monoclonal antibody against nucleolin, alone or with rhodamine labeled nanoparticles over a 15 min to 4 hr time course. The MS-3 antibody enters HeLa cells at similar kinetics to the nanoparticles. At 30 min, we observed substantial amount of cytoplasmic staining, while nuclear staining tends to increase by time until 4 hr. It has little or no colocalization with transferrin in the cytoplasm, which suggests that this antibody also enters the cell via a pathway other than CME. In contrast, it showed extensive colocalization with DNA nanoparticles in both cytoplasm and nucleus at all time points, which suggests that cell surface nucleolin and DNA nanoparticles are associated or at least in close vicinity during their trafficking inside the cell. Therefore, we suggest that DNA nanoparticles enter the cell by binding to cell surface nucleolin and enter the cell via the same pathway as nucleolin antibody.",

We previously discovered that cell surface nucleolin serves as a receptor for the DNA nanoparticles, and is important for their gene delivery efficiency. As nucleolin has no signal sequence or membrane-spanning domain, it is not clear how nucleolin are expressed on the outer surface of plasma membrane or what signals increase its surface delivery. We initially observed that the transfection efficiency of DNA nanoparticles in HeLa cell decreases by 72.2% following 24hr serum-free medium treatment, which reduces cell surface nucleolin by 35.7% as determined by cell surface biotinylation and streptavidin bead pulldown. Since serum depletion inhibits cell proliferation and affects cell cycle progression, we examined the level of cell surface nucleolin at different stages of cell cycle. HeLa cells were arrested at S phase by high concentration of thymidine, and allowed to progress synchronously through cell cycle after removing this block. Surprisingly, we observed substantial increase of cell surface nucleolin at the onset of M phase, about 8 hours after release of thymidine block. It has been reported that nucleolin is phosphorylated by a cell cycle dependent kinase (Cdk) cdc2, and has eight consecutive Cdk phosphorylation sites.

The N-terminal 123 aa of nucleolin is sufficient to target a GFP protein to the cell surface. In contrast, when we further delete the 8 Cdk phosphorylation sites from aa 69 to 123, cell surface expression of nucleolin is significantly diminished. Furthermore, nucleolin lacking the N-terminal 68 aa is not present on the cell surface.

FEV 1 was measured following each dose increase up to a maximum cumulative dose of 475mg. Oxygen saturation monitoring was carried out throughout. A positive challenge was defined by a drop in FEV 1 of >15% from baseline. These subjects received bronchodilator treatment and had spirometry repeated at 15 minute intervals until FEV 1 returned to within 5% of baseline. Those children with a negative challenge had spirometry repeated 15 minutes post-completion of the challenge Results Mean baseline FEV 1 was 68% predicted (45-94, SD 11.7). 9/39 subjects (23%) had a positive challenge. Mean PD 15 (dose of mannitol required to cause a 15% reduction in FEV 1 ) was 262mg (411-107, SD 104). The mean time to complete the challenge was 26 minutes (17-37, SD 5.0) for negative challenges and 27 minutes (15-40, SD 8.0) to PD 15 for those subjects with a positive challenge. We found no association between a positive challenge and age, sex, weight, height, baseline FEV 1 , Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, bronchodilator reversibility, previous Aspergillus fumigatus sen-sitization, atopy or corticosteroid use. There was a non-significant trend for lower FEF 25-75 (means 0.99 versus 1.40; p=0.099) and higher prevalence of Aspergillus fumigatus cultured in sputum at baseline (5/9 versus 7/30 children; p=0.066) amongst those children who went on to have a positive challenge. There was no significant drop in oxygen saturation in either group. Although cough was common during the challenge, other adverse events were infrequent.",

            "text": "We find that 23% of children with CF could not tolerate inhaled mannitol as compared with 12% of adult subjects as reported in the previous study [1] . We could not identify factors predictive of a positive mannitol challenge in these patients. The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (\u2206F508) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel [1] . A major problem with \u2206F508 CFTR is that the protein is defective in folding so that little mature protein is delivered to the cell surface [2] . Expression of \u2206F508 CFTR in the presence of small molecules known as correctors or pharmacological chaperones can increase the level of mature protein [3] [4] [5] [6] . Unfortunately, the efficiency of correctorinduced maturation of \u2206F508 CFTR is low and other approaches are needed to increase the therapeutic value of correctors. We postulated that expression of \u2206F508 CFTR in the presence of multiple correctors that bound to different sites in the protein may have an additive effect on maturation. In support of this mechanism, we found that expression of P-glycoprotein processing mutants (CFTR's sister protein) in the presence of two compounds that bind to different sites (rhodamine B and Hoechst 33342) had an additive effect on maturation. Therefore we tested whether expression of \u2206F508 CFTR in the presence of combinations of three different classes of corrector molecules would increase its maturation efficiency. It was found that the combination of the quinazoline VRT-325 together with the thiazole corr-2b or bisaminomethylbithiazole corr-4a doubled the steady-state maturation efficiency of \u2206F508 CFTR (about 40% of total CFTR was mature protein) compared to expression in the presence of a single compound. The additive effect of the correctors on \u2206F508 CFTR maturation suggests that they may directly interact at different sites of the protein. The use of multiple correctors has the potential to increase the therapeutic value of pharmacological chaperones. Pharmacol. 70, 297-302. The CFTR protein is expressed at the surface of the airway epithelium, where it plays a critical role in maintaining airway hydration by secretion of chloride. For gene therapy of CF lung disease to be successful, it is critical that the endogenous transgene be expressed in the correct cell type and at levels sufficient to restore normal function. The expression of high levels of CFTR has resulted in CFTR mediated chloride secretion in a wide range of experimental systems. However, the cell type or types that need to be corrected and the level of CFTR expression required to ameliorate the pulmonary manifestations of CF are not yet clear. Because CFTR has been localized to the ciliated cells of human airway epithelial cells, we have been investigating the use of ciliated cell-specific promoters to improve the efficiency and safety of gene therapy for CF and other airway diseases. In previous studies a fragment of the human FOXJ1 promoter was shown to target transgene expression specifically to ciliated cells. However, expression of CFTR from this promoter in transgenic CF mice did not significantly improve the CF phenotype, as measured by the nasal potential difference (PD) technique (Ostrowski et al, 2007) . This may be due to the inability of this promoter to correct the olfactory epithelium, which comprises approximately 50% of the mouse nasal cavity. In CF mice, the olfactory epithelium exhibits sodium hyperabsorption and an absence of CFTR mediated chloride secretion, similar to the respiratory epithelium (Grubb et al, 2007) . In this work, we used a fragment of the ciliated cell-specific promoter FOXJ1 to drive CFTR expression specifically in human ciliated cells. Replication deficient adenovirus expressing either EGFP or CFTR from the FOXJ1 promoter were used to transduce well-differentiated cultures of human CF cells following treatment with C10 to disrupt tight-junctions. Cultures were studied 48 hours after treatment, and those treated with Ad-FOXJ1/EGFP showed strong expression of EGFP that was dependant on ciliated cell differentiation. RNA analysis demonstrated strong expression of CFTR from the FOXJ1 promoter, and Western blotting demonstrated levels of protein that were much greater than the level in normal airway cells (>100-fold). Immuno-localization of CFTR with specific antibodies resulted in a strong signal at the apical membrane of ciliated cells. Cultures treated with Ad-FOXJ1/CFTR demonstrated a significant increase in forskolin-stimulated short circuit current (Isc; 5.0 +/-0.8 \u00b5A/cm2, mean +/-sem, n=9), that was approximately 8-fold greater than the response in Ad-FOXJ1/EGFP treated cultures (0.6 +/-0.2 \u00b5A/cm2, n=9). The increase in Isc was blocked by INH172, an inhibitor of CFTR mediated secretion. Under these conditions, Ad-FOXJ1/CFTR restored approximately 30% of the forskolin response of normal human airway cells (15.1 +/-0.3 \u00b5A/cm2, n=3). Because patients expressing low levels of normal CFTR mRNA (5-20%) have mild disease symptoms, these studies demonstrate that the incorporation of the ciliated cell-specific FOXJ1 promoter into gene therapy vectors may be useful for treatment of CF.",

Dampening the inflammatory response in CF reduces the progressive decline in lung function, so anti-inflammatory agents have become both a cornerstone of CF clinical care and a focus of therapeutics research development. Reactive oxygen species [ROS] can play a role in proinflammatory signaling, including the activation of nuclear factor \u03baB [NF\u03baB] . Research has demonstrated increased oxidative stress in CF epithelial cells, potentially highlighting one of the mechanisms responsible for the exuberant inflammation observed. We have previously shown that CDDO, a novel anti-inflammatory agent, significantly limits NF\u03baB activation in CFTR deficient cell culture models at nanomolar concentrations. Using CF mice, we have also shown that intra-tracheal CDDO limits neutrophil accumulation and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid in response to LPS. The synthetic triterpenoids have been shown to activate the nrf2 transcription factor, thereby inducing several genes involved in redox balance. We now present data demonstrating that CDDO may inhibit inflammation in models of CF pulmonary disease by reducing the oxidative stress within cells.",

Increased airway Na+ absorption is a characteristic abnormality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. We have previously demonstrated that mimicking Na+ hyperabsorption by overexpression of \u03b2ENaC in mouse airways results in airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion and reduced mucus clearance causing a spontaneous CF-like lung disease with high pulmonary mortality, and airway mucus plugging, mucous cell metaplasia and chronic airway inflammation in surviving \u03b2ENaC-transgenic (\u03b2ENaC-Tg) mice (Mall et al., Nature Med.10:487, 2004 ). In the present study, we used \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice to test if inhibition of increased airway Na+ absorption by the classic ENaC blocker amiloride has therapeutic effects on CF-like lung disease in vivo. Specifically, we determined the effects of 'early' and 'late' ENaC blocker intervention on mortality, airway mucus obstruction and inflammation by starting intrapulmonary amiloride therapy in \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice either at birth, i.e. prior to the onset of lung disease, or after mucus obstruction and inflammation had established. To achieve this goal, newborn, 5 day, or 4 week old \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice and wild-type littermate controls were treated by intranasal instillation of amiloride (10 mmol/l; 1\u00b5l/g body weight, tid) or vehicle (H2O) alone for a period of 14 days. Initial deposition studies showed that this treatment protocol resulted in pulmonary amiloride concentrations sufficient for inhibition of ENaC. During amiloride therapy, growth and survival were monitored, and any loss in body volume due to diuretic side effects was substituted by subcutaneous injection of isotonic saline (NaCl 0.9%). After the 14 day treatment period, mice were euthanized, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to determine inflammatory cell counts, and lungs were processed for histology and morphometry to quantitate airway mucus obstruction and mucous cell metaplasia. We show that amiloride significantly reduced pulmonary mortality by~70% (P < 0.001), when therapy was started in newborn \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice. Further, early amiloride treatment significantly reduced airway mucus content (P < 0.05), mucous cell numbers (P < 0.05), and BAL eosinophils (P < 0.001) compared to vehicle treated \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice. In contrast, amiloride therapy had no benefits on airway mucus obstruction, mucous cell metaplasia or inflammation, if treatment was started in 5 day, or 4 week old \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice with established lung disease. Taken together, our results are consistent with previous human studies where amiloride lacked therapeutic benefits in CF patients with established lung disease, and demonstrate for the first time that early inhibition of Na+ hyperabsorption is an effective therapy for CF-like lung disease in vivo. These results warrant an evaluation of more potent and longer acting amiloride derivatives in chronic lung disease in mice, and a clinical evaluation of preventive ENaC blocker therapy in human trials.

            "text": "Conclusions: Our study indicates that during the time of treatment nasal aerosol delivery of hypertonic saline up to 7% is well tolerated in healthy adults. There appears to be no issue of discomfort associated with hypertonic saline that would prevent nasal aerosol treatment compliance. Our overall research goal is to discover new drugs for clinical treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) that will correct the biochemical defect in the predominant CF mutation, the \u2206F508 form of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which accounts for over 67% of all CF cases. This mutation leads to a misfolded protein which is rapidly degraded as well as changes in its function and half-life at the cell surface. However, it has been proposed that only a fraction of the normal surface expression level is needed to provide a clinically significant impact on the disease. Thus, from a pharmacological standpoint, strategies that can partially but effectively correct these defects would be expected to have a clear clinical benefit to these CF patients, and these strategies may also be applicable to other CFTR mutations. We previously demonstrated that several members of a particular class of related drugs, the anthracyclines, anthraquinones, and anthracenediones, significantly increased CFTR cell surface expression and function in cell culture. In particular, we demonstrated that a non-cytotoxic concentration of doxorubicin (Dox), a model anthracycline drug, significantly increased total cellular and membrane-associated CFTR protein levels and CFTR-associated chloride currents in human colon cancer T84 cells, and also caused a two-fold increase in \u2206F508 CFTR-associated chloride current in a canine MDCK-C7-derived cell line that expresses a stably transfected copy of human \u2206F508 CFTR. Our previous studies also demonstrated that Dox is able to impart structural integrity to \u2206F508 CFTR, increasing its half-life and decreasing its proteolytic sensitivity, which is indicative of efficient folding. Additionally, two other structurally related drugs, i.e., the anthracycline, daunorubicin, and the anthraquinone, mitoxantrone, were shown to have similar effects on \u2206F508 CFTR expression. In the current work, we have extended these effects to two other related aza-anthracenedione molecules, BBR2778 (Pixantrone) which is a cancer chemotherapy drug with lower non-target toxicity than Dox and which is in Phase III clinical trials, and a structurally related analog, BBR2828, which is essentially non-cytotoxic with a 100-fold lower cytotoxic potency than BBR2778. Both compounds increased CFTR-associated chloride currents to a similar extent as Dox in CFBE human airway epithelial cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR, as measured by Ussing chamber experiments. The ability of the non-cytotoxic analog BBR2828 to do so is particularly important, since it indicates that correction of the \u2206F508 CFTR defect is not directly tied to the toxicity of this class of compounds per se but rather is a result of other structural features. Thus, it is likely that this and/or other non-toxic analogs in this chemical class can be developed that have potential as clinically useful agents for treatment of CF in patients. Supported by a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) grant to JWH and RM, and by the CFF-supported Dartmouth CF program. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is not only an epithelial chloride channel, but it also regulates other transporter and ion channels, including epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and aquaporin water channels. In patients with CF, absent or dysfunctional CFTR results in abnormal electrolyte and fluid content on the epithelial surface. Treatments intended to normalize ion transport in CF airways through non-CFTR dependent pathways represent attractive approaches to alleviate the underlying pathologic defect. Calcium (Ca2+)-activated Cl-channels have been proposed as rescue channel for the cyclic AMP-dependent CFTR Cl-channels, offering a target for CF pharmacotherapy. Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activate epithelial Cl-channels, but inhibit epithelial Na+ channels, which is also beneficial in correcting the hyperabsorption of Na+ in CF. Herein we developed a High Throughput Screening (HTS) assay for screening compound libraries with the intention of finding compounds which can increase intracellular Ca2+. In the pilot primary screening, we screened a MSSP library which contains 2000 known bioactive compounds and natural products. 7 compounds were classified as the real hits after the secondary screening validation with the hit percentage 0.35%. We have found that the EC50 of these 7 compounds are less than 100uM in dose-response studies and none of those compounds were toxic to the cells. We have further discovered that those compounds stimulate Cl-secretion through activating Ca2+ dependent Cl-channels in CF and non-CF human airway epithelial cells in short-circuit current experiments. In summary, our data suggest that modulation of intracellular Ca2+ is a target for CF therapy. The compounds identified by our study will provide possible therapeutic leads in the treatment of CF. Non-viral gene delivery particles with various synthetic polymer coatings have been developed for cystic fibrosis (CF). Intracellular trafficking and in vivo tissue distribution of these particles must be carefully monitored to guide rational design of efficient delivery system. Fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) allow sensitive, long-term and multi-target imaging in cellular environment, and so are a promising tool in tracing gene delivery materials in vitro and in vivo. However, application has been limited by the lack of efficient and reproducible techniques of QD bioconjugation.",

Highly fluorescent ZnS-coated CdSe QDs were first synthesized and encapsulated in amine-containing phospholipid micelles. The non-viral vector system we used is based on a polymer backbone consisting of 30 lysines with a cysteine on the N-terminus (CK 30 ) which is conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). This polymer vector condenses DNA plasmids into stable nanoparticles that efficiently transfect airway epithelial cells in vivo. To introduce the aminecontaining QDs, we utilized a hetero-bifunctional PEG with an NHS ester at one end, which was first reacted with the amine groups of the QDs and a maleimide group at the other end which was subsequently reacted with the thiol group in CK 30 . Excess reagents were removed from the final conjugates QD-PEG-CK 30 by filtration. Conjugation was first confirmed by 0.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Free QDs were positively charged and migrated toward the cathode. PEGylated QDs migrated significantly slower than free QDs, and QD-PEG-CK 30 conjugates migrated at still a different rate. To further demonstrate conjugation, we biotin-labeled the CK 30 and assessed the binding of QD-PEG-CK 30 -biotin to avidin coated agarose beads by monitoring the yield of fluorescent beads. QDs, PEGylated QDs, and physical mixture of QDs and CK 30 -biotin were also incubated with the agarose beads as controls. Fluorescent beads were detected only when QD-PEG-CK 30 -biotin was present.

There is a strong interest in developing small molecules able to correct the phenotypic effects of cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations. Many mutations (e.g. \u2206F508) impair the function of CFTR protein, by altering the protein targeting to the plasma membrane and/or by causing an abnormally low open channel probability. Drug-like organic compounds may restore the correct membrane localization (\"correctors\") or increase channel activity (\"potentiators\") of mutant CFTR. In the last years, various research teams have identified molecules with activity as correctors (corr-4a, VRT-325, miglustat, curcumin) or as potentiators (tetrahydrobenzothiophenes, phenylglycines, sulfonamides, VRT-532, 1,4-dihydropyridines).

We developed a 'pathway screen' in which CFTR-mediated iodide influx is used as a read-out of GPCR activation. The cell-based fluorescence assay utilizes multiply transfected epithelial cells expressing wildtype CFTR, YFP-H148Q/I152L and a specified GPCR. We recently used this assay to identify a new class of nanomolar-affinity, 5-aryl-4-benzoyl-3hydroxy-1-(2-arylethyl)-2H-pyrrol-2-one vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists (Yangthara et al., Mol. Pharm. 2007, in press ). Additional screening of 100,000 diverse small molecules yielded 4 novel chemical classes of inhibitors of CFTR activation. The potential molecular targets of pathway inhibitors include the GPCR, Gs or Gi proteins, adenylyl cyclase, phosphodiesterase, PKA and CFTR. A series of target identification studies was done to classify the new pathway inhibitors, which involved the use of agonists acting at different sites in the activation pathway, and specific site-of-action assays. The pathway screen yielded 3 new small-molecule CFTR inhibitors that are unrelated to thiazolidinone and glycine hydrazide inhibitors. One interesting class of pathway inhibitors, thiophenecarboxylates, represent the first small-molecule phosphodiesterase activators, which strongly reduce cAMP and cGMP concentration in many cell types. The best thiophenecarboxylate greatly reduced intestinal fluid secretion in closed loop mouse models of cholera and Travelers' diarrhea, and slowed cyst growth in a model of polycystic kidney disease. Other pathway inhibitors, which are potential effectors of G-proteins and PKA, are under evaluation. The GPCR-linked CFTR pathway screen developed here is useful for high-throughput parallel identification of small-molecule inhibitors of multiple targets in the CFTR activation pathway. Potential uses of the inhibitors identified here include therapy of secretory diarrheas, polycystic kidney disease, and cyclic nucleotide-dependent tumor growth, as well as pharmacological creation of CF-phenotype in ex vivo human tissues and animal models. Supported by CFF and NIH. Inhibitors of intestinal CaCCs are predicted to have anti-secretory effects in certain diarrheas, and activators of airway and intestinal CaCCs are of potential use in cystic fibrosis therapy (activation of 'alternative' chloride channels). The purpose of this study was to identify small-molecule CaCC inhibitors and activators that target CaCCs directly, rather than ubiquitous upstream processes such as calcium signaling. We screened a collection of 100,000 chemically diverse small molecules using a novel high-throughput screening assay involving lentiviral introduction of a YFP-based halide sensor in CaCC-natively expressing human epithelial cells. CaCC inhibitors were identified from iodide influx following CaCC simulation by carbachol/ATP. We identified five classes of CaCC inhibitors with micromolar potency, including tetrahydro-cyclopentaquinolines, and 3-aryl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-pyrazoles each of which was unrelated to known transport modulators. Two classes of compounds inhibited calcium-activated halide flux following stimulation by multiple types of agonists, including thapsigargin and calcium ionophores, and by patch-clamp analysis appear to target CaCC directly. Structure-activity analysis of 137 analogs of 'hits' yielded compounds with improved potency, which have been resynthesized and characterized for use in assays of antidiarrheal effiacy in rodent models of viral and drug-induced secretory diarrheas. Screening for CaCCselective activators that act in a sustained manner (non-transiently) was accomplished using a similar cell-based fluorescence assay, but instead testing for increased halide influx. Several classes of putative CaCC activators with micromolar-potency were identified in screening of 100,000 small molecules, whose mechanism-of-action and specificity are under investigation. Small-molecule modulators of CaCC function that target CaCCs directly have potential clinical applications, and may be useful in defining the physiological roles and molecular identity of CaCCs.

Initiating therapeutic interventions in the youngest patients, particularly those that target the underlying CF defect of airway surface liquid volume depletion, has potential to preserve lung function and improve prognosis. Subbarao et al performed baseline, post-albuterol and post-HS lung function testing in infants using the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique \u2329RVRTC\u232aand demonstrated no significant drop in lung function \u2329 Pediatric Pulmonology, 2007\u232a. However, performing three sets of RVRTC maneuvers under the same sedation could prove difficult. Before conducting a therapeutic trial of HS in this population, a simplified protocol must be possible at multiple centers. We sought to evaluate a simplified approach as well as to analyze changes in lung function and clinical findings after acute administration of HS.",

Methods and Results: We have characterized AAV serotypes 1-9 in addition to twenty novel vectors isolated from human or macaque tissues to transduce the murine airway epithelium in vivo. Vectors [1E+11 genome copies (GC)/mouse] expressing \u03b1-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and \u03b2galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) were co-instilled into the mouse lung or nose. Transgene expression levels were monitored by assaying AAT concentration in serum as well as the number and cell-types positive for (\u03b2-gal) expression in lung and nasal airways. Of all vectors tested AAV5 and AAV6 were the two most efficient vectors in conducting airways. When these AAV vectors (2E+11 GC) were subsequently evaluated on human ciliated airway epithelial cultures (HAEC), in contrast to our findings in mouse airways, AAV5 failed to transduce HAEC, whereas AAV6 resulted in~10% of the HAEC expressing transgene. Since AAV6 was the most efficient vector in mouse and human airway epithelium we performed structure-function analyses of the AAV6 vector capsid and found two atypical capsid residues that were unique in otherwise conserved positions (F129, K531). To generate a potentially fitter vector, residue F129 was mutated to its conserved state. Residue K531 was found to confer lung tropism and was left unchanged. The resulting vector, AAV6.2, transduced mouse lung and nasal airway with greater efficiency than all AAV vectors tested. The increased transduction efficiency of this vector was also observed (~20%) in HAEC derived from six different human subjects. To continue our preclinical studies in a more relevant model, AAV2/6.2 expressing EGFP was tested in ciliated cultures derived from macaque airways and showed 40-50% of cells expressing EGFP one week after inoculation with 2E+11 GC. Confocal microscopy revealed that AAV6.2 targeted a significant number of ciliated cells: the airway cell-types that likely require CFTR expression in CF patients. AAV6.2 expressing rhesus \u03b1-fetoprotein (rhAFP) was then inoculated in the nasal airways of a rhesus macaque and transduction evaluated by monitoring concentration of rhAFP in the nasal lavage fluid. We have found that RhAFP expression remained high (~300 ng/mg) and stable for at least 72 days.",

Pharmacological correction of \u2206F508 CFTR cellular processing is a potential therapeutic strategy for cystic fibrosis. Recent high-throughput screening has identified synthetic small molecules, such as bisaminomethylbithiazoles (corr-4), which partially restore chloride permeability in \u2206F508 mutant cells. The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of natural compounds (Chinese medicinal herbs) as \u2206F508 correctors. A herbal compound fraction library was constructed from 500 herbs most frequently used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that are believed to contain therapeutic compounds for a broad spectrum of human diseases including lung disease. For construction of the TCM fraction library, crude herbal extracts were first prepared by 95% ethanol extraction on Soxhlet reflux apparatus followed by automated fractionation by preparative HPLC. Eighty fractions were collected from each of the 500 herbs. Each fraction contained 1 to 17 (average 10.4) individual compounds as determined by analytical HPLC. Collected fractions were dried and 1 milligram of the material was dissolved in 200 \u00b5l DMSO to generate 5 mg/ml solutions in 96-well plates. Each 96-well plate contained 80 fractions from one herb. High-throughout screening was done using the FRT cell-based fluorescence assay developed previously (J. Clin. Invest. 115:2564 -71, 2005 . Of 16,000 fractions screened, 87 active fractions from 12 herbs were identified, with 26 positive fractions verified in secondary screening. The positive fraction did not increase halide transport in control non-transfected cells, and halide transport in \u2206F508-corrected cells was fully abolished by CFTRinh-172. We have fractionated some of the most active fractions by preparative HPLC to identify which compound(s) conferred activity. For example, in one fraction there were 14 single compounds, 2 of which conferred corrector activity with IC50s < 5 \u00b5M and efficacy comparable to that of low temperature rescue. These results demonstrate the feasibility of \u2206F508-CFTR corrector discovery from natural compounds. Further fractionation, characterization and structure determination are in progress. The unexpectedly high 'hit'rate for the natural compounds suggests their further exploration in CF therapy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disease affecting the Caucasian population, with an incidence of approximately one in three thousand births. CF transpires as a result from a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which regulates ion transport across epithelial membranes. Subsequently, patients afflicted with CF have an abnormally excessive incidence of chronic lung infection, with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because cystic fibrosis is characterized by chronic bacterial infections, excessive neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, and a coinciding increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation, we hypothesized that exogenous addition of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 might ameliorate this phenotype. We cloned the human I\u03baB\u03b1 gene as well as a mutated I\u03baB\u03b1 gene into plasmids with chicken-beta actin hybrid promoters. We then tested the new plasmids, pAAV2.CB-hI\u03baB\u03b1 and pAAV2.CB-hI\u03baB\u03b1M, in vitro in the presence and absence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the IB3-1 and S9 cell lines. Both plasmids produce I\u03baB\u03b1 at high levels as shown by enzyme linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs). We also show that pAAV2.CB-hI\u03baB\u03b1 transfected IB3-1 cells, after infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, express significantly reduced levels of Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 (2 fold, p<0.0001), IL-8 (13 fold, p<0.0001), and TNF (2 fold, p=0.0007) as well as NF-\u03baB activation (2 fold, p<0.0001) compared to P. aeruginosa-infected IB3-1 controls as determined by human cytokine and NF-\u03baB phosphoprotein Bio-Plex assays; cytokine expression and NF-\u03baB activation levels in infected pAAV2.CB-hI\u03baB\u03b1 transfected IB3-1 cells were between levels found in infected IB3-1 and S-9 cells, excluding IL-8 levels which were below S-9 levels of expression. Flavonoids are among the most potent CFTR modulators known. Equol [7hydroxy-3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-chroman] is a product of intestinal metabolism of dietary isoflavones such as daidzein, and has been of recent interest in studies of cancer, cardiovascular risk, and neurologic disease. Equol is metabolically stable, and 49% circulates in the free (non-protein bound) form, which is considerably greater than the proportion of free daidzein (19%). Structural differences such as modification of ring C (e.g. saturation at C-2/3, and absence of carbonyl group at C-4) and an absent hydroxyl at position C-5 distinguish equol from compounds previously reported to modulate CFTR activity. In prior work by our center, we showed that equol activates wt and \u2206F508 CFTR in membrane patches excised from BHK cells and in CFBE41o-monolayers studied in Ussing chambers. Activation by equol occurred only after R-domain phosphorylation in wt and \u2206F508 CFTR constructs, but was independent of Rdomain phosphorylation in \u2206R CFTR, indicating activity may be related to dimerization of the NBDs or other domain-domain interaction. Because a molecule that alters NBD interactions might have effects on the aberrant processing of \u2206F508 CFTR, we screened equol and other flavonoids by preincubating compounds with CFBE41o-cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR for 18 hours, and then tested for rescue of CFTR dependent Cl-channel activity after exchange of media solution. We found that preincubation with equol (50-100 \u00b5M) induced rescue of short-circuit current compared to vehicle treated cells (12 vs. 4 \u00b5A/cm2, p<0.001, n=8). We then evaluated 24 hour preincubation with equol (50uM) for biochemical evidence of CFTR processing correction in \u2206F508 CFBE41o-cells grown in polarizing conditions. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro phosphorylation demonstrated minimal formation of Band C compared to vehicle treated cells, but adaptation of a more sensitive avidin label/biotinylation assay specific for surface localized CFTR revealed clear evidence that equol preincubation led to CFTR at the plasma membrane. Next, we examined equol in HeLa cells stably transduced with \u2206F508 CFTR. Preincubation of equol led to dose-dependent increases in halide transport measured by fluorescence-based halide efflux (SPQ) after stimulation by genistein (0.50 and 0.95 fluorescence slope (\u2206%/sec) with equol 5 and 50 \u00b5M respectively, compared to 0.2 \u2206%/sec in cells pretreated with vehicle alone; p<0.005, n=120-180 cells/condition). Immunohistochemical staining of \u2206F508 HeLa cells for CFTR with 24-1 C-terminus antibody showed rescue of surface localized protein with equol (50 \u00b5M) preincubation for 16 hours, while vehicle treated cells showed only perinuclear staining. In summary, we show functional, biochemical, and immunohistochemical evidence that the naturally occurring flavonoid equol corrects the \u2206F508 processing defect in two model systems. A naturally occurring agent that both activates and corrects \u2206F508 CFTR deserves further exploration as a potential CF therapeutic, and may lead to new insights regarding domain-domain interactions that influence the activation and biogenesis of the mutant channel. Supported by NIH and CFF. mote \u2206F508 CFTR maturation has been identified. Although several small molecule agents have been described that overcome \u2206F508 CFTR processing defects in specific cellular models, few studies have directly compared the activity of temperature corrected and chemically corrected \u2206F508 CFTR in polarized cell systems. In the present study, we examined chemical and temperature corrected activity of \u2206F508 CFTR. Correctors included all members of the CFFT Modulator Library (C1, C2, C3, and C4; Rosalind Franklin University, Chicago, IL). In a screen using \u2206F508 CFBE41omonolayers, maximal corrector activity across the two model systems exhibited a rank order of C4 >> C3 > C2 = C1, using forskolin (20 \u00b5M) and genistein (50 \u00b5M) stimulated Isc as a sensitive test for \u2206F508 CFTR activity at the plasma membrane. No change in Isc was observed in matched control (parental) cells lacking \u2206F508 CFTR expression. Based on these results, we further defined the activity of C4 in \u2206F508 CFBE41oand FRT model systems, including dose/response and time dependence for peak Isc rescue. In CFBE41o-cells, exposure to 2 \u00b5M C4 for 8 hrs produced maximal reproducible correction of \u2206F508 CFTR processing, with loss of activity following prolonged or high concentration exposure; in FRT cells, peak effects were seen at 24 hours. \u2206F508 CFTR activity following small molecule treatment qualitatively mirrored temperature correction (27\u00b0C growth for 24-48 hrs) in both cell types. Maximal currents produced by stimulation with forskolin (20 uM) and genistein (50 \u00b5M) in \u2206F508 FRT monolayers following C4 pretreatment were 83% of that produced by temperature correction (p<0.001). Forskolin was responsible for 57% of maximal current in FRT \u2206F508 cells following chemical correction and 43% of maximal currents following temperature correction. In \u2206F508 CFBE41o-cells, maximal currents following chemical correction were 22% of that produced by temperature correction (p<0.001). Forskolin was responsible for 10.8% of maximal currents in CFBE41o -\u2206F508 cells following chemical correction and 15.6% of maximal currents following temperature correction. These results illustrate dose and time response with a small molecule corrector in two polarizing epithelial model systems, and provide reassurance that observations based upon \u2206F508 CFTR following low temperature incubation are relevant to functional analysis after chemical correction. Similarity in activation properties between chemical and low temperature correction suggest it is unlikely that the two maneuvers result in \u2206F508 CFTR with significantly different structural properties. The studies also indicate fundamental differences in \u2206F508 CFTR behavior in FRT compared to CFBE41ocells, and emphasize the importance of identifying an agent that can restore cAMP dependent regulation to bronchial epithelial cell types.

The MCID for CFQ-R was estimated using three methods: 1) change in CFQ-R (day 0 to 28) for the patient subset with minimal change in respiratory function, as determined by the GRCQ-RD at day 28; 2) CFQ-R standard error of measurement (SEM) from a validation sample), and 3) 1 \u20442 standard deviation (SD) of the CFQ-R Respiratory Scale scores.",

For calculation of intraindividual variability, 2-4 biopsies/patient were compared with respect to basal tissue resistance (Rt basal), basal open circuit potential difference (PD basal), basal short circuit current (Isc basal) and the Isc responses to stimulation with carbachol (10-4 mol/l, serosal), 8-bromocyclic monophosphate (cAMP) (10-3 mol/l, mucosal+serosal) + forskoline (10-5 mol/l, serosal) and histamine (5x10-4 mol/l, serosal).Results:We determined ICM reference values for the groups of PI-CF (Isc basal 23.4 \u00b1 18.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 , \u2206Isc carbachol 0.4 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b5A/cm 2 ,\u2206Isc cAMP/forskoline 2.0 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b5A/cm 2 ,\u2206Isc histamine -3.1 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b5A/cm 2 );PS-CF (Isc basal 45.6 \u00b1 31.5 \u00b5A/cm 2 ,\u2206Isc carbachol 3.4 \u00b1 6.8 \u00b5A/cm 2 ,\u2206Isc cAMP/forskoline 8.0 \u00b1 10.4 \u00b5A/cm 2 ,\u2206Isc histamine 6.3 \u00b1 10.8 \u00b5A/cm 2 ),and healthy control (Isc basal 39.0 \u00b1 26.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 , \u2206Isc carbachol 27.3 \u00b1 7.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 , \u2206Isc cAMP/forskoline 15.2 \u00b1 10.6 \u00b5A/cm 2 , \u2206Isc histamine 27.4 \u00b1 15.2 \u00b5A/cm 2 ).

Conclusion:This first comprehensive analysis of the intraindividual variability of ICM basal tissue and Cl-secretion parameters provides the basis for the method as an useful outcome measure for future clinical trials aiming to rescue the CFTR basic defect. Possible effects of pharmacological therapeutics in CF relevant human epithelia have to be adequately interpreted with respect to subject variability and laboratories reference data.

Patients included were \u226516 years of age in phase I and \u226512 years of age in phase II, with a FEV 1 >60% predicted and stable lung disease. Overall, 12 subjects received Moli1901 and 6 placebo. Exclusion criteria included ABPA, B. cepacia infection and severe liver disease. The study involved 7 clinic visits over a period of 8 weeks to assess adverse events, spirometry, pulse oximetry and quality of life. A total of 111 adverse events (AEs) were observed in 16 subjects (101 AE in 12 subjects receiving Moli1901), with only 1 (productive cough) in the Moli1901 group being of severe intensity. The most frequent AEs related to the study medication were (productive) cough (43x) and dry throat/throat irritation (14x), and most of these resolved within 1 hour after inhalation. In the Moli1901 group no significant AE, defined as a decline of FEV 1 \u226520% from baseline accompanied by symptoms, a decrease in oxygen saturation to <90% or a fall of 8% from baseline requiring therapeutic intervention, or a change in safety parameters judged to be clinically significant was observed. This trial was not primarily designed to show efficacy; however, the median change in FEV 1 from day 1 to day 56 was -3% in the placebo group, and +2% in the Moli1901 group, and this difference was significant (Wilcoxon test, p=0.0217). Similarly, there was a significant difference between the median change in FEF 25-75% from day 1 to day 56 in the placebo group as compared to the Moli1901 group (-10% vs. +1%, p=0.029). No significant changes were observed for the other study days or for FVC and pulse oximetry. Moli was well tolerated in this trial, with the observed AEs generally being mild and of short duration. These encouraging explorative results are currently being further evaluated in explorative and confirmatory trials. ",

            "text": "Conclusion: Aerosol administration of MP-376 produces a greater extent of bacterial killing than systemic dosing of LVX in mouse models of pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. The majority of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients is caused by chronic and persistent lung infections especially with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Since galactosyl ceramide had been previously shown to be involved in Pseudomonas internalization, ceramide levels in the plasma of CF patients were assessed and compared to healthy volunteers using HPLC followed by Mass Spectrometry. The results demonstrated that CF patients displayed significantly lower levels of several ceramide species. Also, Cftr-knockout mice displayed diminished ceramide levels in CF related organs (lung, pancreas, and ileum) and plasma compared to wildtype controls. Treatment with a semi-synthetic retinoid (fenretinide), which was previously reported to induce ceramide in neuroblastoma cell lines, was able to increase ceramide concentrations in CF related organs in Cftr-knockout mice to the levels of wildtype mice. Treatment also dramatically improved the ability of Cftr-knockout mice to control Pseudomonas infection. Following infection with Pseudomonas-impregnated agar beads, fenretinide treated Cftr-knockout mice were able to clear bacterial infection as efficiently as wildtype mice. Overall, these findings not only documented a novel deficiency of ceramide in CF patients but also demonstrated a pharmacological means to correct this defect in Cftr-knockout mice. Our data provides a strong rationale for clinical intervention that may benefit cystic fibrosis patients suffering from CF lung disease. ",

            "text": "Recent reports show that adult bone marrow-derived stem cells can localize to and acquire phenotypic and functional markers of lung epithelium. These findings raise the novel possibility of stem cell therapy for multitude of lung diseases. However, only small numbers of adult marrowderived stem cells localize to lung and it is not clear whether these cells will be clinically useful. We investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from human cord blood might have increased potential to participate in structural lung remodeling. Cord blood was obtained from normal deliveries at the University of Vermont. Mononuclear cells were isolated and plastic adherent cells were expanded and characterized as MSCs according to International Society for Stem Cells Research (ISSCR) criteria. Following systemic (2x106 cells/mouse by tail vein) administration to sublethally irradiated (1.4 Gy) immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice, lungs harvested 1 day, 2 weeks, 1 or 3 months later demonstrated small numbers of human b2-microglobulin positive cells in the airway epithelium at all time points. Small number of cells was found also stain positive for pancytokeratin (pan-CK) and rarely, we identified cells of b2-microglobulin+/pan-CK+ in the airway epithelium of these mice after 2 weeks. We are currently characterizing the phenotype of these cells with CCSP and CFTR but these data suggest that CB-MSCs may be a potential alternative source of stem cells for use in lung remodeling. High-throughput screening (HTS) and other drug development programs have identified CFTR activators and potentiators that require secondary evaluation and mechanistic confirmation. We recently evaluated the CFFT modulator library (Rosalind Franklin University, Chicago, IL) and found some, but not all, CFTR potentiators induced potent phosphorylation of the regulatory-domain (R-D), conventionally viewed as the first step in CFTR activation. To assess whether this observation has functional significance regarding ion channel activation by these agents, we evaluated CFTR potentiators in CFBE41o-and Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cells stabily transduced with \u2206F508 CFTR. Cells were studied in modified Ussing chambers under control conditions and after correction of \u2206F508 CFTR misprocessing using either low temperature (27\u03bfC x 48 hrs) or pre-incubation with the chemical corrector C4. Total currents were determined following potentiator (at reported EC 50 ), forskolin (2 \u00b5M), and genistein (50 \u00b5M) stimulation. In temperature corrected \u2206F508 CFBE41ocells, potentiator 1 (P1, CFpot-532), an agent that does not induce R-D phosphyorylation, caused modest activation when acutely administered (5 \u00b5M) (15.5 vs 1.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 in vehicle treated cells, P < 0.005). Importantly, this agent potentiated forskolin mediated short-circuit current (ISC: 9.8 vs 1.5 \u00b5A/cm 2 , P < .05). Forskolin accounted for 43% (vs. 4% with vehicle) of total current, demonstrating potent rescue of cAMP dependent CFTR activity, an effect not previously reported in this cell type (P<0.005). In contrast, two CFTR potentiators that induce R-D phosphorylation, P8 (UCcf-029, a benzoflavone intermediate, 2 \u00b5M) and P10 (UCcf-152, an isoxazole, 50 \u00b5M) induced modest direct activation of CFTR (5.3 and 6.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 respectively, P=0.10 and P<0.01), but no evidence of forskolin potentiation (P8: 2.3 \u00b5A/cm 2 , 10% of total stimulated current P=NS; P10: 0.4 \u00b5A/cm 2 , 1%, P=NS). In \u2206F508 FRT cells grown at low temperate, P1 elicited strong potentiation of forskolin mediated currents (121.7 vs. 46.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 with vehicle, P <0.01), and modest direct CFTR activation (8.7 vs. 0.51 \u00b5A/cm 2 , P < 0.05). P8 and P10 were limited to minimal (not significant) activation and no evidence of forskolin potentiation. In CFBE41oand FRT cells pretreated with C4 (to chemically correct \u2206F508 CFTR processing), P1 again potentiated forskolin mediated current (101.3 vs. 43.2 \u00b5A/cm 2 with vehicle, P<0.001 in the FRT model) but did not directly activate I SC . Findings with P8 and P10 were otherwise as seen with low temperature corrected cells. In summary, in \u2206F508 CFTR polarized epithelia, P1 both activates and potentiates CFTR activity (with potentiation being the predominant effect, a unique observation in CFBE41ocells), while P8 and P10 confer activation of CFTR without forskolin potentiation. Given that P8 and P10 induce R-D phosphorylation while P1 does not, our findings suggest that agents that do not confer phosphorylation of the R-D may be better suited to rescue the endogenous cAMP mediated component of I SC . Screening of potential therapeutic agents for effects on R-D phosphorylation may help predict utility at restoring \u2206F508 chloride channel activity.",

Activation of CFTR is conventionally viewed as a two step process: PKA-regulated phosphorylation of multiple sites within the regulatory domain (R-domain), followed by ATP dependent gating mediated by binding sites at the interface of the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). CFTR 'potentiators', small organic molecules that overcome mutant CFTR gating defects at the cell surface, have been proposed as therapies for CF. Although a number of these agents are advancing to the clinical testing phase, their mechanism(s) of action are not well understood. As a step towards better characterizing CFTR potentiators available through the CFFT modulator library or other resources, we are developing standardized biochemical and functional assays to evaluate the R-domain during CFTR activation in living cells. We have previously described a gel-shift method by which phosphorylation of isolated R-domain (residues 635-836) can be monitored. Using this method, we have confirmed that one potentiator, P1 (CFpot-532), does not induce phosphorylation of the R-domain (4% of forskolin response, n=7, P = NS). Unexpectedly, two potentiators, P8 (UCcf-029, a benzoflavone intermediate) and P10 (UCcf-152, an isoxazole), robustly confer phosphorylation of the R-domain (P8: 32% of forskolin response, n=8, P = 0.002, P10: 37% of forskolin response, n=8, P = 0.004). We found the phosphorylation conferred by either P8 or P10 could be inhibited with the PKA inhibitor H89 (10 \u00b5M). Maximal stimulation of phosphorylation occurs within 2 minutes, indicating time dependence similar to forskolin. Importantly, neither P8 nor P10 increased total cellular cAMP, a finding confirmed by a number of other laboratories. The results may therefore implicate compartmental inhibition of CFTR-associated phosphotases (eg. PP2A) or phosphodiestereases (eg. PDE4) as an underlying mechanism by which isoxazole or certain flavone-derivative compounds stimulate CFTR. To further test this hypothesis, P1, P8 and P10 are being examined for effects on \u2206R-CFTR chloride channel activity. These studies provide a means by which novel CFTR potentiators can be biochemically categorized based on R-domain phosphorylation, a measure of the first step of CFTR activation. Compounds working through distinct mechanisms may have particular relevance to certain CFTR mutations, and could provide synergy in the clinical setting. Supported by NIH and CFF. Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is an innate defense mechanism that protects the lungs from bacteria and viruses. MCC requires maintenance of a thin layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) to eliminate inhaled particles. The ASL volume is tightly regulated by a balance of ion and water transport across the airway epithelia. In CF, the loss of CFTR Clsecretion coupled with unregulated Na + absorption via ENaC results in ASL volume depletion and impaired MCC. Although significant progress has been made in the identification of the basic disease mechanism in CF, therapeutic approaches that address abnormal CFTR biogenesis are not currently available.",

P2Y 2 receptor agonists are good candidates to treat CF. However, the rapid hydrolysis of ATP and UTP on the airway surface of CF patients limits the effectiveness of this approach. Consequently, Inspire Pharmaceuticals has developed di-nucleotide molecules which retain the ability to activate P2Y 2 receptors, but are more resistant to hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases. Denufosol, Inspire's lead compound for CF treatment, potently activates P2Y 2 receptors to stimulate Cl -/water secretion, ciliary beating, and mucin release in epithelial tissues.

Taken together, these data suggest that denufosol is a promising candidate molecule for CF therapeutics. Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is the primary airway host defense against chronic exposure to infectious and noxious agents. MCC is dependent upon ciliary beating and the volume and composition of the airway surface liquid (ASL).

Surprisingly, amiloride blunted the response to HS, which resulted from a previously unrecognized property of amiloride to inhibit aquaporin-mediated water transport.

The defective regulation of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC is thought to be a major contributor to reduced Airway Surface Liquid (ASL) volume and impaired mucociliary clearance of the airways. Thus, strategies designed to inhibit ENaC function may result in clinical benefit. RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by short, double-stranded RNA molecules, can be used to target complementary RNA sequences for degradation via the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). We investigated the possibility of using RNAi to reduce expression of ENaC in the mouse lung, as proof of principle for a strategy to reduce sodium hyperabsorption in the CF lung. Potent siRNA molecules capable of efficient knockdown of ENaC alpha, beta and gamma subunits were identified in an optimised cell culture system utilising mouse kidney M1 cells (50,000 cells per 24-well; 20pmol siRNA complexed with Lipofectamine 2000; 48 hour harvest) in which ENaC expression was quantified using real-time RT-PCR.

Subsequently, siRNA molecules were delivered to the lungs of female BALB/c mice via hydrodynamic tail vein injection (40 \u00b5g naked siRNA, n=5-6). After 24 hours, lungs were harvested, RNA extracted and ENaC mRNA measured using real-time TaqMan PCR.

Interestingly, despite efficient knockdown in cell culture, in vivo treatment with the most potent ENaC gamma-specific siRNA molecule led to no reduction in ENaC gamma expression compared with untreated controls (p > 0.05). These data show proof of principle that ENaC expression can be reduced in the lung using siRNA. Further work is needed to assess the functional consequences of inhibiting ENaC in the lung. ",

Previously we have shown that the choice of enhancer/promoter elements has a strong influence on the duration of reporter gene expression following delivery of non-viral vectors to the mouse lung (Gill et al., 2001 , Gene Ther, 8, 1539 . However, it is also possible that other elements of plasmid vector design play an important role. Using a clinically relevant mouse lung aerosol model, we have studied the effect of varying the plasmid CpG-dinucleotide content on the duration of expression from plasmids that had an identical enhancer/promoter sequence. Firstly we constructed a CpG-free plasmid vector containing a synthetic CpG-free luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the human CMV enhancer/EF1\u03b1 promoter. Secondly, we constructed a similar vector containing an identical enhancer and promoter but with a small number of CpG motifs, in the luciferase gene (97 CpGs) and in the backbone sequence (52 CpGs). We then investigated the level and duration of transgene expression following aerosol delivery of these plasmids complexed with the Genzyme lipid GL67 to the lungs of BALB/c mice (2.5 mg/ml pDNA, 6mM GL67, 10ml, Pari LC+ Nebuliser). Total lung extracts were assayed for luciferase activity at days 1, 2, 7, 14 & 28 (n=6 per time-point). The CpGcontaining plasmid initially directed approximately 2-fold higher levels of reporter gene expression than the CpG-free plasmid (p<0.05 both days 1 and 2 post-delivery). However, while expression from the CpG-containing plasmid subsequently fell slowly to background levels, expression from the CpG-free plasmid increased 2-fold to day 7, and remained at the peak levels observed with the CpG-containing plasmid until the end of the experiment at day 28 (CpG-free plasmid 4-fold, 16-fold and 50-fold higher expression at days 7, 14 and 28 post-delivery respectively; p<0.05 for each). These data suggest that the ability of a promoter/enhancer sequence to direct long-term expression in the mouse lung is dependent by the sequence of the plasmid backbone. One explanation for this observation is that a specific, but as yet unidentified, sequence exists in the CpG containing backbone that triggers transcriptional silencing. Alternatively, the well-described host inflammatory response to CpG-containing DNA, may be involved and the CpG content of the vector could be responsible for these differences. We are currently evaluating the potency and duration of effect of CFTR expressing, CpGfree, plasmids in late-stage pre-clinical studies prior to the initiation of a further round of clinical studies of non-viral gene transfer in CF patients. Background: Novel approaches to CF therapy by improving/restoring CFTR chloride channel function using gene therapeutic tools or small molecules are currently undergoing phase I and phase II clinical trials. There remains a great need for accurate and practical methods of measuring CFTR function in vivo to act as primary outcome measures of efficacy. We propose that an in vivo assay measuring CFTR function in sweat glands offers several potential advantages over the nasal potential difference test.",

The mucosal surface of some tissues was rinsed three times with PBS to remove mucus for comparison with control cells which were not rinsed. ELISA for human airway mucins performed on the rinsings confirmed that three rinses sufficed to remove the mucosal mucous blanket. The development of long-term, safe and efficacious gene therapies for lung disease will require efficient gene delivery to stem cells which produce the differentiated progeny of affected epithelial tissues. Recombinant lentiviral vectors are being considered for gene therapy applications for the lung because they can efficiently transduce a wide variety of stem and progenitor cell types. However, it is of concern that strong constitutive viral promoters have produced oncogenesis in X-SCID patient recipients of retroviral vectors in part due to the disregulation of proto-oncogenes by the strong viral promoter/enhancer located near the integration site. We propose that regulation of transgene expression to the tissue or cell type of interest will enhance the safety of gene therapy for respiratory disease. In this study we have investigated the potential for respiratory specific transgene expression from integrated lentiproviruses in cell lines in vitro and in mice in vivo. The lentiviral vectors constructed for this study contained regulatory elements predicted to produce lung specific transgene expression: the surfactant protein C promoter (SPC) for alveolar epithelial type II cell (AECII) expression, the Clara cell 10kd protein (CC10) for Clara cell expression in the airway, and the Jaagskiete sheep retrovirus (JSRV) promoter for expression in both cell types. Transgene expression from the SPC and CC10 vectors was restricted to AECII and Clara cell lines respectively, while expression from the JSRV vector was observed in multiple respiratory and non-respiratory cell types. Following intra-tracheal delivery of lentivector supernatant to mice, transgene expression was observed in AECII from the SPC lentivector (N=8 mice), and in Clara cells from the CC10 promoted lentivector (N=6 mice). Transgene expression was not detected in non-respiratory tissues following intravenous delivery of CC10 and SPC lentiviral vectors to neonatal murine recipients (N=4 and N=7 respectively). In summary, incorporation of genomic regulatory elements from the SPC and CC10 genes resulted in respiratory specific transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. These vectors will provide a useful tool for the study of lung biology and the development of gene therapies for lung disorders such as CF. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive lung dysfunction, associated with the formation of oxidants derived from neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO). Indeed, respiratory tract levels of MPO are extensive, and have been found to correlate with decreases in respiratory parameters or disease severity in CF. MPO-derived oxidants thus may play a role in perpetuating the progressive lung dysfunction associated with CF. Based upon these premises, we reasoned that MPO could represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as CF. Herein we report that substituted urea and thiourea compounds are potent inhibitors of MPO. Utilizing tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a classical heme peroxidase substrate, we screened a large number of structurally varied urea and thiourea derivatives. Alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aromatic ureas and thioureas all proved to be effective MPO inhibitors, however, with a high degree of variability in potency. Of those compounds examined, substituted phenylthioureas proved to be the most potent MPO inhibitors. Various ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted phenylthioureas (PTUs) were then assessed for inhibitor potency. The most potent inhibitor of MPO was 2-chlorophenylthiourea (IC50 = 700 nM, Ki = 320 nM). The potency of ortho-PTUs as MPO inhibitors showed a linear relationship with ortho sigma substituent constants (reflecting resonance, steric and inductive effects). Moreover, cyclic voltametry experiments with ortho-substituted PTU compounds revealed a linear relationship between inhibitor potency and thiourea oxidation potential. This correlation is indicative of a substituent effect on the relative ease of sulfur oxidation within the thiourea moiety. This finding suggests that the redox-active sulfur plays a crucial role in MPO inhibition, perhaps via a direct interaction with the heme of MPO. Thioureas proved to also inhibit the chlorinating activity of MPO, whereas sustituted ureas were not effective in this regard. Both ureas and thioureas were also effective inhibitors of dityrosine formation by MPO. These findings will help facilitate the rational design and optimization of MPO inhibitors with even greater potency, which could serve as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CF. Gene therapy is the transfer of a normal copy of the CFTR gene and should, in theory, provide a long-term cure for CF. The development of prenatal screening programs for cystic fibrosis has provided an opportunity to identify CF patients in utero, and may provide an opportunity to treat the disease before birth, prior to the onset of disease symptoms. The long-term goal of our study is to investigate the therapeutic potential of delivering the normal CFTR gene to epithelial stem cells in fetal CF mice by in utero administration of recombinant lentiviral vectors carrying the normal CFTR gene. This would provide us with the unique opportunity to \"correct\" the chloride channel defect in the epithelial stem cells, which give rise to the epithelial cells in the tissues affected by CF at a very early stage. The aim of the current study is to optimize the in utero gene delivery of recombinant lentiviral vectors, carrying an EGFP reporter gene to epithelial stem cells in fetal mice. Mice have been used for these studies, as mouse strains with a variety of CF mutations are available. In all studies, the uterus was exteriorized following a mid-line laparotomy, and the injections were made directly into the amniotic fluid of individual fetuses. In the first studies, the survival of pregnant females and pups following saline injection at E16.5 (n=2) and E17.5 (n=3) was evaluated. All five females survived the procedure and an average of 54% (26/48) of the pups present at the time of injection were born alive. This experiment demonstrated that the surgical procedures were reasonably safe.",

            "text": "Introduction: Oral ciprofloxacin is often used for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PSA) infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) not requiring intravenous antibiotics. Oral chloramphenicol is commonly used at the Royal Brompton Hospital (RBH) as an alternative to ciprofloxacin, but less so in other CF centres due to concerns about aplastic anaemia and uncertainty regarding effectiveness. This study aimed to address three questions: 1) What proportion of PSA is sensitive to ciprofloxacin and/or chloramphenicol? 2) Were there any adverse haematological effects with the use of oral chloramphenicol at RBH? 3) How effective is chloramphenicol in comparison to ciprofloxacin? Study Design: We carried out a retrospective review from the RBH CF database (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) together with analysis of patients' notes.",

Clinical improvements with choramphenicol comparable to ciprofloxacin were also recorded. Our data shows chloramphenicol is safe and may be the oral antibiotic of choice in ciprofloxacin allergy or PSA resistance to ciprofloxacin. A randomised prospective study is needed to further evaluate the efficacy of chloramphenicol in comparison to ciprofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are one of the main factors causing disease in CF patients. At present the generally recommended treatment is repeated courses of antibiotics. This has resulted in fewer infections and a markedly improved prognosis for the patients. But it has also severe drawbacks such as antibiotic resistance, disturbed normal flora and allergenicity. Antibiotic resistance is an emerging problem world wide and alternatives are urgently needed. Specific chicken antibodies, Anti-pseudomonas IgY, have potential both as an alternative and a complement to antibiotics (Pediatr Pulmonol 2003; 35:433) . Anti-pseudomonas IgY prevents P. aeruginosa from adhesion to epithelial cells and has affinity for flagellin in vitro. Humans do not produce anti-IgY antibodies and oral administration of IgY is generally regarded as safe. The risk that bacteria should develop resistance to IgY is extremely low. In total, 21 CF patients have received Antipseudomonas IgY for up to 12 years. Since November, 2003 the drug is given to a group of CF patients (at present 14 patients) on individual permissions granted by the Swedish MPA and reimbursed by the Swedish government. In our first study about the effect of IgY there were 2.5 positive cultures/100 months, compared to 13.7/100 months in a control group. Up to December 31, 2006, nearly five years later, the effect is maintained with 2.4/100 months for the whole study period. We are at present compiling the data from the control group during the same period. Only two siblings in the IgY-treated group have been chronically colonized (with an identical P. aeruginosa strain), which still is non-mucoid after 4.5 and 1.5 years. During the whole treatment period there have been no cultures positive for mucoid P. aeruginosa or B. cepacia and other pathogens (S. maltophilia, A. xyloxidans, atypical mycobacteria and A. fumigatus) have only appeared sporadically -possibly due to the relatively low use of antibiotics. All patients have preserved pulmonary functions and nutritional status. There have been no adverse events. Thus treatment with Anti-pseudomonas IgY has diminished the number of positive cultures and delayed the onset of chronic infection. The need for antibiotics is reduced as well as their adverse side effects. In conclusion, IgY is an important complement to antibiotics for prevention of P. aeruginosa infections in CF. Introduction and aims: We have previously shown by culture that the lungs of clinically stable Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients are not only colonised by commonly recognised aerobic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also by a range of potentially pathogenic anaerobic species. The aim of this study was to determine whether anaerobes are also present in the sputum of CF patients with an acute exacerbation of pulmonary infection.",

            "text": "Conclusion: These results indicate that anaerobes are present in large numbers within the CF lung during an acute exacerbation of pulmonary infection. Their presence could be of important clinical relevance to CF patients as they may contribute significantly to the inflammatory process. Airway infection and inflammation cause the majority of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). The microbiology of CF is complex. Not only are the routinely identified pathogenic bacteria present, increasingly a number of other bacteria are associated with pulmonary disease. In addition, the normal microbiota likely contribute to airway disease in CF via intracellular signaling, but remains largely unstudied. The application of culture independent methods for bacterial identification in CF airway secretions provides for the first time the ability to characterize the bacterial communities in the CF airway comprehensively and efficiently. Here we present the results of a two-year study of CF airway samples to describe the bacterial communities present by ribosomal RNA sequences. We have examined 231 airway specimens from 117 subjects (82 CF, 35 controls). These results provide a unique perspective on CF airway microbiology. Bacterial communities identified in sputum were more complex than communities identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, pulmonary status determined the level of complexity, with higher complexity observed during stable pulmonary function. We identified a collection of anaerobic bacteria that were present at high levels during pulmonary exacerbation in a subset of CF subjects. Detection rates ranged from 8-50% of CF subjects examined depending on the specific organism (Table 1 ). These organisms of interest are suspected to be involved in pulmonary exacerbation especially when cultures for standard CF pathogens are negative (~20% in our center). Preliminary data will be presented from quantitative real-time PCR experiments to track these organisms. We also will present the application of new meth-ods for community comparisons. This analysis provides the ability to look at how clinical information from individuals with CF corresponds to the microbial communities that occur in the airway. Overall, the results point to a much richer bacterial community associated with the CF airway than previously thought. The results also point to new opportunities to understand the differences within the CF population, and thus potentially improve individual patient outcomes. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are characterized by persistent microbial colonization of the airways and recurrent pulmonary infection. However, due to the domination of bacterial communities present in CF sputum by a small number of species (typically Pseudomonas aeruginosa), culture-independent approaches to characterize the depth of bacterial diversity in CF sputum have yielded limited information. Here we describe application of a novel microarray, the 16S rRNA PhyloChip to comprehensively describe the bacterial diversity present in temporal sputum samples of 3 CF patients who experienced periods of exacerbation (defined as hospitalization) and remission. In addition, these samples permitted assessment of bacterial community dynamism during periods of antimicrobial administration in these patients. PhyloChip analysis identified 980 bacterial taxa present across these patient samples, including a large number of known human pathogens. Antimicrobial administration caused a profound decrease in bacterial diversity in all patients examined. Despite this, a sizeable fraction of each community remained stable or proliferated during the period of antimicrobial administration, suggesting many of the bacterial taxa present were resistant to the antimicrobials administered. Taxa exhibiting this behavior included P. aeruginosa, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, Streptococcus constellatus and Burkholderia mallei amongst other pathogens. These results suggest that complex polymicrobial communities exist in CF sputum that exhibit significant antimicrobial driven dynamism and consist of multiple antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Future studies will focus on whole community gene expression to determine which virulence systems are activated in response to bacterial community perturbations and contribute to pathogenic processes in CF airways. The lungs of chronically infected Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have been intensively studied. It is well documented that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant pathogen in CF (H\u00f8iby 1974 , Baurnfeind et al.1987 , Koch 2002 , and that P. aeruginosa accumulates in Heaps (aggregates), detected in CF sputum (H\u00f8iby 1977) and intraluminal in the lung (Baltimore et al. 1989) . The bacterial density is highest in the bronchi (Potts et al 1995) and these P. aeruginosa microcolonies are embedded in a matrix (Lam et al. 1980) . The morbidity of the infection is due to an extensive and ongoing PMN response which apparently does not eradicate the bacteria, instead leading to slow degradation of the lung. In addition, even highest deliverable doses of antibiotics fail to clear the bacteria completely, though survival has significantly increased the last 30 years due to aggressive anti P. aeruginosa therapy (Koch and H\u00f8iby 2000)",

Today antibiotics suppress but can not eradicate the bacteria from the conductive zone, whereas the remaining respiratory zone is protected from massive biofilm infection for prolonged time. The conductive zone serves as a reservoir; here the bacteria are organized in microcolonies embedded in puss, a trait which is independent on the time course of the infection and amounts of antibiotics. These microcolonies consisted solely of P. aeruginosa. In addition, we found no bacteria adhering to the epithelial tissue. The pus consisted mainly of leukocytes, surrounding the microcolonies. A smear of DNA and dead leukocytes were detected just around the microcolonies, possible due to the Quorum sensing dependent rhamnolipid killing recently described by us (Jensen et al. 2007) .",

            "text": "We conclude that P. aeruginosa persists in the CF lung due to its ability to create microcolonies i.e. biofilms. Within these biofilms the bacteria are protected against antibiotics and the host defence. Respiratory viral infections, including influenza (flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contribute to the morbidity of children with CF. Additional human respiratory viruses have been identified in children such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and coronavirus (cov), but these have not been examined in CF patients. In our laboratory, PCR assays have been developed to identify both traditional and newer respiratory viruses in healthy and immunocompromised children. These assays are usually performed on nasal swabs or nasal wash samples. However, oropharyngeal (OP) and sputum samples are routinely obtained in CF for bacterial culture. The goals of this trial are to determine whether these available samples can be used for viral PCR studies and to examine the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in CF. For this single center observational trial, 44 CF patients, ages 6.1 to 17.7 yrs (mean 12.8 yrs), have been recruited. Subjects provide OP and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples at quarterly clinic visits and with acute pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization; sputum is also collected if patients can expectorate. NP and OP samples are pooled when both are available. Viruses assayed are flu A and B, RSV, parainfluenza (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, hMPV, Cov, adenovirus (Adv), and rhinovirus (Rhv). Subjects are being followed for two respiratory viral seasons. We report here the methodology of viral PCR detection in CF sputum, as well as the results of viral detection during the first respiratory viral season in the Seattle community. The mean length of time subjects were followed was 0.84 yrs (median: 0.92 yrs, range: 0.18-1.18 yrs). Overall, 47 samples (20% of the 235 samples analyzed) were positive. Twenty-four subjects (69.1%) had at least one viral infection detected and 8 (18.2%) had two viruses at different visits. Both sputum and pooled OP/NP samples were available at 55 visits and were concordant in 80% of cases. Among the discordant cases, it was more common for sputum to be positive and OP/NP to be negative (9.1%) than the converse (3.6%). The most frequently identified viruses were Rhv (32 isolations); PIV3 and Cov were the next most prevalent with 4 and 3 isolations, respectively. In conclusion, sputum viral PCR shows promise for the diagnosis of both traditional and novel viral infections in CF. As part of ongoing clinical trials in CF, non-fermenting Gram negative bacilli (NFGNR) identified at site laboratories are often sent to the TDN Core Microbiology Laboratory for confirmation of identification. Among NFGNR from CF patients, P. aeruginosa are the most frequently isolated and also are acknowledged to be the easiest to identify. However, in a survey of 428 \"P. aeruginosa\" isolates sent to the laboratory in the past year, PCR identified 30 (7%) as alternate species. These included: non-aeruginosa pseudomonads, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Ralstonia spp., Alcaligenes spp., Brevidimonas spp., and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Identification of these NFGNR can be difficult; however, P. aeruginosa is an important isolate for the clinical microbiology laboratories in all CF centers to be able to identify. Many methods are available including conventional biochemical testing and rapid identification kits. In the TDN Core Laboratory we previously demonstrated the importance of combining phenotypic identification (morphology plus a short set of biochemical tests) and genotypic identification (16s rDNA sequencing of V3 and/or PCR using three primer sets) and developed an algorithm for testing. In this study, we examined all of the CF cultures performed in the clinical microbiology laboratory at CHRMC over the past two years to determine the number of isolates for which it was necessary to perform genotypic identification in NFGNR. Among this collection of 182 NFGNR from clinical cultures sent to the microbiology laboratory from the Seattle Children's Hospital CF Center, PCR identified 43 isolates as Burkholderia cepacia complex. Next most commonly identified were A. xylosoxidans (28), P. aeruginosa (23) and non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. (23). Three isolates remained unidentified, even with PCR sequencing of the V3 determinant. The clinical microbiology laboratory at CHRMC has served as the core microbiology laboratory for TDN clinical trials for 8 years and thousands of CF samples are processed annually. The result is that there is increased experience with CF isolates among the laboratory personnel. However, even with experienced technologists, a significant number of NFGNR required genotypic identification in the past two years. Thus, it is important for clinical microbiology laboratories with less experience in the identification of CF NFGNR to utilize additional molecular techniques or send problematic isolates to a reference laboratory. Based on these results we propose an algorithm for the most efficient means of identifying NFGNR from CF samples using a combination of tests including phenotypic (colony morphology, biochemical testing) and genotypic identification (PCR, sequencing).",

NTHi infection usually precedes Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in many chronic lung diseases, including CF, emphysema, diffuse panbronchiolitis, and immotile cilia syndrome. It is hypothesized that NTHi acts as a gateway organism paving the way for subsequent infection with P. aeruginosa, however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood.

Airway epithelial tolerance may contribute to a failure to clear subsequent bacterial infections. These phenomena would help to explain how early infections with NTHi may promote chronic bacterial infections and P. aeruginosa acquisition in CF and other NTHi related airway diseases. The colonization of CF airways by P. aeruginosa leads to intractable and persistent lung infections that resist permanent eradication by antibiotics. The lack of efficacy of current therapies is believed to be due to the formation of P. aeruginosa antibiotic resistant biofilms in the CF airways. However, little is known about biofilm formation on human airway epithelial cells. Thus, we designed a continuous flow, live cell imaging system to grow P. aeruginosa biofilms on glass or on the apical surface of polarized human cells. CFBE41ohuman airway epithelial cells homozygous for the \u2206F508 mutation (CFBE), and CFBE41o-cells complemented with wt-CFTR (CFBE+wt-CFTR) were grown as polarized monolayers at an air-liquid interface and GFP-labeled P. aeruginosa were applied to the apical surface of the cells. After 6 hours biofilms did not form on glass but large bacterial macrocolonies developed on CFBE cells. Surprisingly, biofilms also developed on CFBE+wt-CFTR cells: however, P. aeruginosa biomass on CFBE+wt-CFTR cells was significantly reduced compared to CFBE cells (0.60\u00b10.12 \u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 vs 1.58\u00b10.20 \u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 ). The minimal bactericidal concentration for Tobramycin was >10,000 \u00b5g/ml for P. aeruginosa grown on CFBE and CFBE+wt-CFTR cells. These results explain why Tobramycin given clinically, which is~1,000 \u00b5g/ml in bronchoalveolar fluid collected from CF patients, fails to eradicate the persistent infection by P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa also formed biofilms on human bronchial epithelial cells, which produce mucus. Indeed, biomass was similar on CFBE+wt-CFTR cells, which do not produce mucus, and human bronchial epithelial cells. To determine if human airway epithelial cells secrete factors that facilitate biofilm formation, conditioned medium was collected from CFBE and CFBE+wt-CFTR cells and applied to P. aeruginosa grown on glass. Under these conditions, biofilm formation was dramatically facilitated, with a biomass of 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 when P. aeruginosa was grown in conditioned medium collected from CFBE+wt-CFTR cells and 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 when grown in conditioned medium collected from CFBE cells. The secreted factor(s) were greater than 5 kDa, as assessed by size exclusion. Our results suggest that human airway epithelial cells secrete factor(s) that facilitate biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, in the presence and absence of mucus, and that secretions from CF cells are more effective in promoting biofilms than secretions from non-CF cells. The ability of non-CF cells to facilitate biofilm formation appears to contradict the observation that non-CF lungs do not harbor P. aeruginosa. We propose that the innate immune response in the non-CF lung effectively eliminates P. aeruginosa from the lung, thus, biofilms do not form even thought the airway epithelial cells secrete factors that have the potential to facilitate biofilm formation. However, in CF when mucociliary clearance is compromised, P. aeruginosa accumulates in the lung and secretions by CF airway epithelial cells greatly enhances the formation of drug resistant biofilms (supported by the NIH (RO1 AI51360, RO1-HL-074175, P20-RR018787, T32-DK-07301), and the CFF (STANTO97RO, ANDERS06FO).",

University of Washington, Seattle, NC, USA Bacteria in natural, industrial and clinical settings live in surface-associated communities termed biofilms, which are the source of persistent infection and resistance to antimicrobial treatment. Biofilm development is initiated by the attachment of planktonic cells to a surface, followed by formation of microcolnies, and finally disperses swimming cells from microcolnies to occupy a new surface. To maintain the community structure, bacteria in a biofilm are usually enmeshed in an extracellular polymeric matrix, which consists of nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) have been known as a component of the biofilm matrix for years. However, little is know about how the EPS matrix forms and develops and whether an EPS can form a matrix independently. In the present report, we use lectins that specifically detect the mannose or galactose structure in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Psl EPS. This technique allows us to visualize Psl EPS on the bacteria cell surface and in the biofilm matrix. Our results indicate that Psl EPS is likely anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern and clearly forms a matrix, which holds bacteria in the biofilm and on the surface. In a flat multiple-layer biofilm, Psl EPS is equally distributed in the entire biofilm. However, microcolonies reveal peripheral staining of Psl EPS with minimal staining of matrix in the center of the microcolonies. Instead, this region has swimming cells indicating a biofilm development stage prior to dispersion. More strikingly, this area also has concentrated dead cells and/or extracellular DNA, which fills up the viod spaces in the lower center of microcolonies at the stage prior to dispersion. These data provides a plausible mechanism for how P. aeruginosa sacrifices a portion of cells to make void spaces and free another portion of cells for future dispersion. In addition, our data also show that Psl EPS matrix and DNA matrix are not overlapping, which suggests that these two components of the matrix work coordinately to encase bacteria in the biofilm. Finally we show that the Psl EPS matrix is present in biofilms formed by mucoid P. aeruginosa, and formation of the Psl EPS matrix is independent of the production of alginate and Pel, two EPS that also contribute to P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Overall, our data indicates that Psl EPS functions as a primary scaffold, holding biofilm cells together in the matrix. Moreover, our data along with published literature suggest a possible model for how P. aeruginosa biofilms persist in cystic fibrosis patients. 1 1.

Department of Paediatrics, Copenhagen Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominates chronic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A hallmark of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF patients is the presence of mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilms surrounded by numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the lower airways. How P. aeruginosa escapes the bactericidal PMNs is not fully understood. Several virulence factors of P. aeruginosa is controlled by Quorum Sensing (QS); a density dependent mode of inter-bacterial communication based on signal transmitter molecules. Active QS is present during chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF patients and we have previously demonstrated a QS-regulated tolerance of biofilm bacteria to the antimicrobial properties of the PMNs. The precise QS-regulated effect on the PMNs is, however, unknown. In the present study, further elaboration using flow cytometry and microscopy revealed that QS-competent P. aeruginosa (PAO1 and \u2206rhlI lasI complemented with C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL) induces rapid necrosis of the PMNs. This mechanism was also observed in in vitro biofilms and in mouse lungs infected with P. aeruginosa embedded in alginate. By using HPLC fractionation the toxicity could be ascribed to a single substance. Using LC-MS and 2D NMR this substance was identified as rhamnolipid B. In accordance, concentrations of rhamnolipid exceeding 200 \u00b5g/ml were found in the toxic supernatants from wild-type P. aeruginosa (PAO1) whereas non-toxic supernatants from QS-deficient knock-out mutants (\u2206rhlR lasR and \u2206rhlI lasI) and from \u2206rhlA mutants contained low amounts of rhamnolipids approaching 0 \u00b5g/ml. Our results demonstrate the potential of the QS system to facilitate infections with P. aeruginosa by utilizing rhamnolipid to disable a major first line of defense of the host -the PMNs. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the inhibition of QS as a target for the treatment of infections with P. aeruginosa.",

Heart Lung Division, the Cystic Fibrosis Center, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden; 4. Wieslab Analys AB, Lund, Sweden The clinical consequence of chronic Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa colonization in cystic fibrosis (CF) varies between individuals for unknown reasons. Auto-antibodies against bactericidal/ permeability increasing protein (BPI-ANCA) are associated with poor prognosis in CF. We hypothesize that there is a correlation between the presence of BPI-ANCA, the biological properties of the colonizing bacteria and the clinical conditions of the hosts. We have compared isolates of P aeruginosa from two groups of CF patients: one with positive serum levels of BPI-ANCA and deteriorating lung disease, and one with negative BPI-ANCA levels and stable clinical conditions. Epithelial cells (A549) and isolated polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) were stimulated with the clinical isolates and cell death was analyzed with flow cytometry. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) released into the supernatant was measured by ELISA. We found that the ANCA associated strains in most cases showed a pyocyanin negative phenotype. These strains also induced less inflammatory response than the non-ANCA associated strains as shown by the number of necrotic cells and IL-8 release, yet elevated compared to control. We conclude that colonization with strains of P aeruginosa that induce a weak inflammatory response is associated with unfavourable outcome in CF. We speculate that inadequate control of pathogen proliferation through an insufficient inflammatory response results in a slowly increasing number of bacteria and accumulation of dying PMNs in the airways, contributing to the progressive lung disease seen in many CF patients. 2 1.

Pulmonary Medicine, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA; 4. Pediatrics, Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA Purpose: Most Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and have progressive loss of lung function. Among individual patients, however, there are marked differences in rates of lung function deterioration. Although the reasons for this variability are not completely understood, it is likely that microbiological factors play a role. Type III secretion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolates from non-CF patients have been associated with poorer outcome. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between type III secretion properties and deterioration in lung function in CF.",

These facultative anaerobic bacteria exhibit the capability to switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, which enables them to survive in the hypoxic environment in the CF lung [1] . Absence of oxygen would also favour the growth of fastidious anaerobes and, indeed, sequencing of 16S rRNA resulted in the detection of strict anaerobic species in CF sputum [2] . Thus, we identified and quantified strict anaerobes in CF sputum using conventional anaerobic microbiological methods, examined the recovery rate of identical species in sputum samples from the same patients, and determined the antibiotic susceptibilities. 92 sputum samples were collected from 8 CF children and 31 CF adults (mean age 25.6 \u00b1 8.5 yrs). Samples were incubated aerobically on Columbia agar, supplemented with 10% sheep blood, and anaerobically on Brain Heart Infusion agar and Schaedler agar supplemented with 5% mutton blood, for up to 7 days. Bacteria were identified (RapID ANA II identification system, Remel, Lenexa, KS) and cfu's were determined by dilution plate counting. Fastidious anaerobes (141 strains) were submitted to E-test \u00ae susceptibility testing (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) using the anaerobically active antibiotics ceftazidime, clindamycin, meropenem, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.",

University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Antibiotic resistance may severely limit therapeutic options in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchiectasis. Because of frequent antibiotic treatment courses, resistance continues to emerge, even to newer agents. Treatment with multiple antibiotics in a single aerosol formulation may be a promising approach to slow development of resistance. Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid antibiotic that is bactericidal against both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. Fosfomycin inhibits the first committed step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, suggesting cross resistance to other cell wall acting antibiotics will not occur. The aminoglycoside tobramycin is one of the most commonly used antimicrobials in CF, with potent activity against Gram negative bacteria and the majority of Staphylococcus aureus isolates. A 4:1 (wt/wt) fixed combination of fosfomycin:tobramycin (GS-9310/11) was used to determine the in vitro susceptibilities of a panel of respiratory pathogens: CF Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100), S. aureus (16), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (17) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (20), including minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and time-kill experiments in the absence and presence of 2% porcine mucin. Synergy was evaluated using the checkerboard method, and spontaneous resistance mutation frequencies were determined in antibiotic-containing agar (4X, 8X and 16X MIC). In vivo drug efficacy was examined using a rat agar bead pneumonia model of either P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. All experiments compared GS-9310/11 to fosfomycin and tobramycin as single agents. GS-9310/11 had a lower MIC 90 than tobramycin for the S. aureus strains, 75% of which were methicillin resistant (MRSA). For P. aeruginosa, GS-9310/11 had a lower MIC 50 and MIC 90 than fosfomycin alone, but tobramycin was more active than either. For H. influenzae and S. maltophilia, GS-9310/11, fosfomycin and tobramycin had similar MIC 50 and MIC 90 . B. cepacia complex were resistant to all three drugs. Results in the presence of mucin were similar. Time-kill studies showed a more rapid and prolonged killing of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa by GS-9310/11 compared with either agent alone at the same drug concentrations. GS-9310/11 was bactericidal and exhibited concentration-dependent killing. Synergy studies showed no antagonism between fosfomycin and tobramycin, and the majority of P. aeruginosa and all of the S. aureus tested demonstrated indifference for the combination. At 4X MIC concentrations the mutation frequency of GS-9310/11 was at least 2-3 logs lower than tobramycin and 2-6 logs lower than fosfomycin alone for S. aureus. For P. aeruginosa the mutation frequency of GS-9310/11 was 2-3 logs lower than fosfomycin and 1-2 logs lower than tobramycin. In the rat pneumonia model, GS-9310/11 and tobramycin alone demonstrated bactericidal killing of P. aeruginosa; both were more active than fosfomycin alone. In vivo killing of S. aureus by GS-9310/11 was also demonstrated. GS-9310/11 appears to have advantages over single agents for the treatment of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial lung infections in CF and bronchiectasis.",

Synergistic antibiotics did not show an improvement in the therapeutic outcomes of days to next admission or change in FEV1. Background: Expectorated sputum (ES) technique is currently the most frequently used method for routine assessment of lower airway infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Induced sputum (IS) using hypertonic saline (HS) has been successfully used in CF patients unable to produce sputum spontaneously, but only limited data are available comparing the diagnostic yield of expectorated versus induced sputum in CF patients. While ultrasonic nebuliser have been used in the majority of studies, new high output jet nebulisers may offer a suitable alternative technique to induce sputum expectoration.",

Microbiology Department, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, United Kingdom Susceptibility testing results are not predictive of clinical response to antibiotic therapy in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis. We assessed the impact of reducing the number of routine susceptibility tests performed on clinical outcome in these cases. In June 2006 we introduced a protocol of limiting susceptibility tests to P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from respiratory samples taken at the commencement of antibiotic therapy, when there was evidence of clinical failure, or routinely if not tested in the previous three months. At all other times, isolates were identified and reported as normal but P. aeruginosa isolates were not subjected to susceptibility tests. Between 1st June and 30th November 2006 P. aeruginosa, was isolated on at least one occasion from 193 patients attending our Adult CF Unit. In this six month period we reduced the number of susceptibility tests by 56% (from a projected 2,231 tests on 872 samples to an actual 972 tests on 427 samples). This resulted in projected savings of $4,777 in consumables and 170 hours (costed at $8,871) of laboratory staff time per annum, a total saving of $13,649 (\u00a36,500) per annum. We assessed the response to intravenous antibiotic treatment between the study period in 2006 and the same period in 2005. No significant differences in median change of FEV1, FVC, CRP, white cell count, weight, or duration of intravenous antibiotics were observed. For CF units sending regular, routine sputum samples, a reduction in the number of susceptibility tests performed in cases of chronic P. aeruginosa can be carried out without impacting on clinical outcomes. We report our preliminary results for a total of 233 strains obtained from 112 patients (85 patients harbored more than 2 strains). These patients were classified in 3 groups of respiratory insufficiency according to their FEV1: severe in 31 patients (FEV1<40%), moderate in 36 patients (FEV1: 40-60%) and mild in 45 patients (FEV1>60%).",

Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd., Basel, Switzerland With ever increasing frequency, we now observe several examples of bacteria being resistant to every clinically available drug. Therefore this urgently calls for the development of novel and improved antibiotics that may escape the extant mechanisms of bacterial resistance. One recent and promising development of the genome-wide search for target functions for antibiotics led to the identification of essential genes of pathogens by interfering antisense RNAs. The first step is the construction of shotgun antisense libraries (SALs) as follows. Genomic DNA is extracted from the bacterial strain of interest, fragmented by shearing into short pieces of DNA, blunt-ended and cloned in an expression vector under the control of a regulatable promoter. The library is then reintroduced into the cognate bacterial strain and screened by replica plating colonies both in the presence and the absence of an inducer of the vector promoter. By this method, insert sequencing of clones showing conditional growth phenotypes is expected to lead to the identification of essential genes that can be silenced via antisense RNA activity. We adopted this technology in order to generate a panel of essential functions of the cystic fibrosis-related opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. So far, we tuned the protocol for SAL generation in P. aeruginosa and identified a number of sequences conferring different levels of growth inhibition We are now characterizing these putative antisense RNAs in order to define the minimal sequence able to cause the toxic effect and, on the other hand, to understand the cellular role of their targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an extremely versatile microbe with a vast array of pathogenic and metabolic mechanisms that allow it to form persistent infections in select patient populations, especially patients with Cystic Fibrosis. An ineffective immune response is considered partially to blame for failure of PA eradication. We have discovered that some strains of PA express peptidylarginine deiminase (PADI) activity. PADI is an enzyme that post-translationally modifies peptidylarginine to peptidylcitrulline with ammonia as a byproduct. Our lab has shown that human PADI can modulate the immune system through downregulation of TLR4 and IKK-gamma signaling. Characterization of the PA PADI will offer insights into a completely novel method of immune modulation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using a widely published colorimetric assay for PADI activity we have found the specific activity of crude PA cell lysates is very low. However this is similar to the only other known prokaryotic PADI described in Porphyromonas gingivalis. A protein homology search with the Porphyromonas PADI has revealed the likely genetic locus of Pseudomonas PADI in a 4.5 kb operon that appears in the genome of the pathogenic Pseudomonas isolate PA14. This operon appears to contain two candidate genes for PADI activity based on conserved motif searches (PADI 1 and PADI 2). Both have been cloned into expression vectors, partially purified by affinity tag technology and tested in the colorimetric PADI assay. Curiously PADI 1 autocitrullinates itself while PADI 2 has not shown activity. Reaction conditions and substrate specificities for PA-PADI are not like either the human or Porphyromonas PADI. Furthermore analysis of up to 64 clinically diverse strains has demonstrated 15% carry the gene for PADI 1. This work is only the second description of PADI activity in any prokaryote. PA PADI could clearly have a dramatic impact on the local inflammatory milieu if it can access the same targets as human PADI. The description of this activity in Pseudomonas will advance our knowledge of the human-pathogen relationship and give insight into new therapies. which functions by translocating toxins into the cytoplasm of host cells. These toxins cause disease by damaging the surrounding host tissue, promoting dissemination of the organism and paralyzing the phagocytic mechanism of macrophages. PcrV is a factor required for the translocation of the toxins. The bases of these studies were to evaluate PcrV as a protective antigen in \"P. aeruginosa\" pneumonia and CLDC as a vaccine adjuvant.",

Background: There has been a recent increase in the number of reported cases of acute renal failure (ARF) in cystic fibrosis (CF). Our group have undertaken a national survey, which measured the incidence risk of ARF in CF patients at between 4.6 and 10.5 cases / 10,000 CF patients / year. We have now conducted a case control study to determine which factors which are associated with an increased risk of ARF.",

In the group of patients with ARF, 21/24 had received an aminoglycoside at the time of their episode of ARF or in the preceding week, compared with only 3 of the controls for the same time period (p<0.001). The median number of days of aminoglycoside in the year prior to the index case developing acute renal failure was 24 (7-99) for cases and 0 (0-47) for controls. Conditional logistic regression showed that the odds ratio for ARF per each day of aminoglycoside was 1.06 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.11, p=0.02 It is well-known that Pa senses the environment and changes its phenotype. For instance, it produces greater amounts of the extracellular polysaccharide alginate in the CF lung, characterized by a microaerobic environment. Little is known about the changes in protein secretion induced by oxygen limitation in PAO1, the proto-typical Pa laboratory strain. No data are available on this regard about Pa clinical strains. Our work was aimed to study the differential regulation of proteins secreted by Pa strains grown in microaerobic or aerobic conditions. A Pa clinical isolate and PAO1 were grown overnight in aerobiosis and in microaerophilic conditions. The supernatants were collected and proteomic analysis was carried over by two-dimensional capillary chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (Mauri et al., FASEB J 2005) to evaluate the differential protein expression. In the Pa clinical isolate, we identified 66 proteins down-regulated and 42 proteins upregulated in aerobic conditions in comparison with microaerophilic culture while in PAO1 16 proteins were down-regulated and 30 were up-regulated. 6 proteins were down-regulated and 12 up-regulated both in the clinical and in the laboratory strain. These proteins can mediate different biological functions since they are enzymes, heat shock proteins, chaperones, proteins involved in adaptation, motility and in the transport of small molecules. Among all these proteins, as the alkaline metalloproteinase is associated with tissue invasion not only by causing rupture of epithelial tight-junctions but also by degrading several chemokines, we decided to validate its up-regulation observed in aerobic conditions by zymography. We found that the proteolytic activity of the supernatants of Pa grown in aerobic conditions was higher than in microaerophilic culture both for the laboratory and clinical strain, indicating the functional relevance of data obtained by proteomic analysis.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers are subject to repeated lung infections most commonly with the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In spite of antibiotic treatment P. aeruginosa tends to become established giving rise to persistent chronic infection. In the lung environment, the bacterium grows as a highly structured biofilm consisting of a complex community of cells embedded within a self-secreted polysaccharide matrix. Investigations of P. aeruginosa biofilm growth using model strains have elucidated mechanisms which appear to govern the biofilm life-cycle. Our research aims to test whether observation of these mechanisms in planktonic culture can be related to the efficiency of biofilm formation.",

On testing a large, genetically diverse group of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates retrieved from the lungs of CF patients we found no definitive correlation between the degree of motility of an isolate in planktonic culture and its ability to form a biofilm in vitro. The development of biofilm architecture has been demonstrated in model systems to be coordinated by the production and secretion of N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing molecules. However among the clinical isolates tested we observed no obvious correlation between the amount of AHLs produced in planktonic culture and the extent of biofilm formation.

One displays both twitching and swimming motilities, is mucoid and expresses AHLs, while the other is non-motile, non-mucoid and no AHLs have been detected in planktonic culture. We have developed a simple flow-through bioreactor to provide sufficient quantities of biofilm for proteomic analysis. Gel-based and gel-free techniques were employed to study protein expression patterns for both biofilm and planktonic cultures of each isolate by mass spectrometry.

A mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA3064) was used to establish biofilms in rectangular optical grade glass flow cells. Biofilms were observed after four days of growth by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a focal plane set to view within the biofilm cluster or outside as a control. Time dependent accumulation of fluorescent liposomes within the biofilms was measured by the spatial distribution of fluorescence intensity in regions within or outside of the biofilm. Images indicated significant penetration of liposomes into the interior of biofilms under these conditions. The rate of penetration was considerably slower than typical rates for small molecules, consistent with the size of the liposomes. Liposome concentrations were higher near the periphery than the interior. However, even the interior concentration was at least as high as the concentration of liposomes in the fluid outside of the biofilm, suggesting some binding or trapping of the liposomes within the biofilm. Penetration of liposomes was observed under flow or static conditions. In a \"washout\" experiment, where medium is passed through the biofilms previously treated with liposomes, a significant portion of the liposomes remained associated with the biofilms for an extended period of time.",

Following pretreatment with albuterol, they inhaled both preparations on two occasions with 99m Tc-DTPA added to the tobramycin in the Nuclear Medicine facility. In vitro preliminary work demonstrated that the radiolabel tracked with both formulations of tobramycin. Deposition was measured by a gamma camera taking both tissue attenuation and mucociliary clearance during nebulization into account (Pediatric Pulmonol Suppl 29: A343; 2006) . In order to have a continuous rate of deposition, the PARI LC PLUS \u00ae was run for a timed 10 minutes and then both the total deposition and time of nebulization \"scaled up\" from in vitro testing when the nebulizer was run to dryness. This was done by multiplying the deposition by the total output when run to dryness divided by the total output in 10 minutes. (Blood samples were taken for quantification of tobramycin in the serum but not yet analysed). The rate of output per minute was calculated from the 10 minute run and the total time was total output from in vitro testing divided by the rate of output.

This time saving may improve adherence to recommended therapy. (Pediatrics 2006; 118:1260) . In order to properly interpret OP cultures from NBS infants, especially those with non-classic CF mutations, we need to know the OP flora of non-CF infants. We obtained OP cultures from 100 healthy infants under 1 yr of age. OP specimens were plated on standard CF culture media. Exclusion criteria included a first degree relative with CF, respiratory illness at the time of culture, or positive newborn screen for CF. Data on cigarette smoke exposure, animal exposure, and exposure to hot tubs/swimming pools was collected. 57 samples have been collected to date. In healthy, non-CF infants, the most common finding is non-specific mixed Gram negative and positive growth. However, 3 infants have grown PA (ages 3 months, 10 months, and 10 months). Many infants have grown multiple organisms. The following bacteria have been found in (n) number of infants: S. aureus (10), E. coli (8), E. cloacae (6) , H. flu (4), Klebsiella (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), H. parainflu (3), unidentified non-lactose fermenting (4), other (9). Data on 100 infants including correlation to environmental factors will be presented. Conclusion: Non-CF infants commonly have S. aureus and many Gram negative organisms including PA in their oropharynx. These results may have some bearing on interpetting colonization and clearance of PA in infants identified through NBS and in EPIC study participants. #300) ). Identification of SMG by sputum cultivation represents a significant challenge because the organisms are phenotypically diverse, grow poorly on routine culture media, and are very difficult to discriminate from other members of the oropharyngeal flora. We have developed a solid media for the selective isolation of SMG from sputum. The value of the media is highlighted by the identification of SMG as the quantitatively dominant organism in sputum samples of three CF patients admitted to hospital for an acute pulmonary exacerbation. In all three, the SMG species failed to be identified on routine or selective media currently described for the culture of CF-specific sputum pathogens. Antibiotic treatment directed against the SMG correlated with clinical resolution of acute symptoms as well the reduction of SMG on daily serial sputum cultures during hospitalization. This novel selective media makes use of antibiotics (colistin, sulfadiazine and oxolinic acid) inhibitory to the growth of principal CF pathogens and much of the usual oropharyngeal flora. SMG agar utilizes a colorimetric indicator to uniquely identify SMG colonies. The sensitivity and specificity of the selective media has been evaluated by molecular methods using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis. SMG organisms do not respond well to anti-pseudomonal therapy, therefore proper detection and culture-directed antibiotic therapy is paramount. We believe that SMG represent significant respiratory pathogens in CF, and because of the inability to effectively culture and identify SMG they have largely gone unrecognized. Pseudomonas aeruginosa releases substantial amounts of the blue antibiotic pigment pyocyanin. In presence of a reductant (such as NADPH), pyocyanin redox-cycles and generates superoxide and H 2 O 2 . In infected CF airways, pyocyanin concentrations can reach high micromolar levels and contribute to oxidative stress of the airways. The structural basis of the pyocyanin molecule that underlies the redox-cycling with reductants of the airways is not clear. We therefore investigated i) the ability of physiologically or pharmacologically relevant reductants of the airways to support the redox-cycle activity of pyocyanin, and ii) the molecular features of pyocyanin that support redox cycling. Dose-and time-dependent H 2 O 2 production by pyocyanin was measured by Amplex Red oxidation in presence of horseradish peroxidase. Rates of H 2 O 2 production by 100 \u00b5M pyocyanin in presence of 150 \u00b5M reductant were: NADPH (392 pmole/min) > L-ascorbate (108 pmole/min) > reduced glutathione (41 pmole/min) > \u03b1-tocopherol (12 pmole/min). In contrast, lipoic acid, genistein, or resveratrol did not significantly support pyocyanin-mediated H 2 O 2 production. In absence of a reductant, pyocyanin showed no measurable formation of H 2 O 2 . To identify the structural characteristics of the pyocyanin molecule that allow for its redox-cycling activity we synthesized a number of new pyocyanins containing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents. Functional assays were performed in presence of L-ascorbate as reductant. Molecular substituents that donated electrons to the positively charged core of pyocyanin, either by hyperconjugative or resonance effects, reduced the H 2 O 2 output of the corresponding pyocyanin. In contrast, a closely related analog (2-hydroxyphenazine-5,10dioxide) showed significantly increased activity (2.2x compared to pyocyanin) suggesting that the electron-withdrawing effect of the N-oxide functionality led to an increase in the redox-cycle activity. These data indicate that the functional characteristics of pyocyanin as a redox-cycling compound are governed by its positively charged core. In the airways, pyocyanin is predicted to utilize several reductants that are present in the airway surface liquid or intracellularly, thus contributing to CF airway disease. Because pyocyanin utilizes a variety of reductants, it appears prudent to test whether inhaled small-molecular CF therapeutics support pyocyanin function.",

When AU with 6mM Ca, 3mM Mg and 25mM PO4 was titrated there were two distinct nucleation points; a slow event starting at about pH6.7 and a much faster event at about pH 7.4. Omitting Ca or Mg confirmed that the first event was due to calcium phosphate precipitation and the second to struvite. Including ciprofloxacin at 400, 500 or 600mg/L did not alter these nucleation pH values, but the magnitude of the turbidity rise showed that the ciprofloxacin co-precipitated with the struvite. Ciprofloxacin at 1000mg/L and without Ca or Mg began to precipitate at pH 6.2 and could be held in solution until pH 7.2 when Ca and Mg were included.",

CF patients were thought to acquire P. aeruginosa from the environment; however genotyping over recent years has revealed clonal strains in sputa from CF patients in the UK, Australia, and Canada that are transmitted person to person or from a common source. One clonal strain, Australian Epidemic Strain-1 (AES-1), (formerly Melbourne epidemic strain, m16 or PI) currently infects up to 40% of patients in five CF clinics on the eastern seaboard of Australia. Most CF clonal strains have been associated with increased virulence not fully explained by greater antibiotic resistance. Both genotypic and phenotypic differences have been postulated as important in enabling transmission of clonal strains.",

Multiple genotypic analysis of sequential P. aeruginosa isolates which included PFGE, ATchip and multilocus SNPs showed intraclonal diversity with genome rearrangements, variations in pathogenic islands and acquisition of prothoadaptive mutations in the muc genes. The largest divergence was observed between the completely sequenced reference strains PAO1 and PA14, the latter represented in our panel by three CF isolates. P. aeruginosa virulence has been assessed by monitoring its capacity to induce bacteremia and to establish chronic infection in a murine model (Bragonzi et al, 2005) . Overall, P. aeruginosa environmental strains increased five times the risk of bacteremia when compared to clinical strains (Test of proportion: p<0.001). The high risk of mortality was also evidenced for P. aeruginosa CF strains isolated at the onset of the infection when compared with those isolated after years of colonization (p=0.002) indicating that environmental strains or newly acquired strains were similar in their virulence. P. aeruginosa clinical strains isolated after years of colonization increased chronic persistence and reduced the risk of bacteremia (p=0.002) when compared to strains isolated at the onset of the infection. The strain PA14 was found to be lethal in contrast to P. aeruginosa clonal strains of clinical origin that established chronic persistent infection in the murine lung. Furthermore, our data showed that adaptive traits commonly associated with the chronic P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients, such as transition to the mucoid phenotype, did not confer a selective advantage to bacterial cells in colonizing the murine lung (p=0.294).",

Since the introduction of the beta-lactam compounds there has been numerous reports citing altered pharmacokinetics of several compounds (but not all) within the beta-lactam class. Recently it has been suggested that substrate specificity for the renal transporter Pgp may explain the variability in renal drug clearance observed in patients with CF. Pgp is structurally related to CFTR and evidence suggests it serves a complementary role in modulating alternative chloride channel function. In a CFTR knockout model MDR1 expression was reported to be increased nearly four-fold. In an effort to elucidate the potential contribution of Pgp to the renal clearance of drugs in patients with CF, we conducted a controlled clinical trial comparing the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine (FX) in patients with CF and age matched healthy volunteers (HV). Fexofenadine is not significantly metabolized and is a relatively specific substrate for the membrane transporters Pgp and OATP. Probenecid (Pb) is a selective inhibitor of OATP and was used pharmacologically to block the activity of this transporter in-vivo. Our hypothesis is that if Pgp is upregulated within the renal tubules of patients with CF we would expect to see an enhanced renal clearance of fexofenadine in these patients when compared with control subjects.",

Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Shortly after birth CF patients are colonized by P. aeruginosa, which leads to a lifelong chronic infection. The mechanisms behind P. aeruginosa colonization of the CF lung are still poorly understood, however several secreted toxins have been associated with this phenomenon. CF is characterized by a loss of mucocilliary clearance, a key component of innate immunity in the lung, and an increase in sputum viscosity as a result of mutations in the gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). We have previously shown that the novel P. aeruginosa secreted protein Cif is capable of reducing apical membrane expression of CFTR. We have begun to characterize cif expression and have identified a key regulator of cif transcription. Mutations affecting the divergently transcribed putative TetR family repressor encoded by the PA2931 gene result in a significant increase in Cif expression. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the PA2931 gene product is capable of binding the promoter region located immediately upstream of the cif-containing operon.

We present here an interim analysis of an ongoing prospective study to evaluate the proposed dosing in paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. As part of this protocol pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy for a pulmonary exacerbation. Serum creatinine, audiometric testing, respiratory cultures and FEV 1 were assessed at baseline and after a 2 week treatment period. Serum tobramycin concentrations were interpreted by clinical pharmacists performing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to optimize dosing. Serum tobramycin levels were drawn after the first dose, repeated with each dose adjustment and weekly thereafter. The proposed sample size of this study is 60 patients; an interim analysis was performed to identify trends for pharmacokinetic and safety outcomes from 18 patients admitted from November 2006 through April 2007. Seven (38.9%) patients achieved the target C max of 25-35mg/L, 10 (55.6%) patients remained under the target range and 1 patient was above the target range with the 1st dose. With 2nd, 3rd, and 4th TDM performed for either routine weekly levels or dose adjustment levels, 6, 16, and 17 patients met the target C max respectively. The percentage of patients who achieved target C max increased to 88.9 % with the 3rd set of TDM levels and 94.44 % with the 4th set of TDM levels (p-value<0.0001). There were no significant changes in k e , t 1/2 and V d /kg for each patient from 1st to 2nd set of TDM levels over time. Compared to the previous retrospective study the mean V d /kg was significantly higher (0.327L/kg versus 0.267L/kg, p=0.0021) and the mean t 1/2 was significantly shorter ( 1.73 hrs versus 2.14 hrs; p<0.0015). None of the patients' serum creatinine increased \u2265 50 % from baseline. Baseline audiometric tests were within normal limits in 12 (70.6 %) patients. P. aeruginosa was isolated from respiratory specimens of 6 patients on initial culture. Of the 5 patients with follow-up cultures, 3 patients grew P. aeruginosa sensitive to tobramycin, demonstrating no decrease in sensitivity. Our preliminary results suggest the pharmacokinetic data differ from the expected profile suggested by the retrospective study. All study patients treated according to the guidelines were clinically well after their course of therapy and did not experience clinically significant toxicity from once-daily tobramycin dosing. The once-daily tobramycin dosing will continue to be evaluated until the proposed sample size is achieved for final analysis.",

Evidence suggests that this infection progresses through distinct phases, wherein initial colonizing strains undergo a switch to mucoidy that corresponds to formation of bacterial microcolonies in the airways and life-long persistence. Currently, the environmental signals and mechanisms regulating conversion from the acute, highly virulent form to a less virulent biofilm state remain obscure. To investigate these issues, we developed a tissue culture model system for growth of P. aeruginosa biofilms on CF-derived human airway epithelial cells in vitro. Biofilms grown on these cells appear similar to those found in CF airways as well as to abiotic biofilms. Eventually, epithelial cells were killed by the P. aeruginosa biofilms. However, we discovered that addition of the antibiotic tobramycin preserved the monolayer integrity for at least 24 hours. Bacteria were not completely eliminated by this treatment, suggesting that tobramycin influenced the virulence of the biofilm bacteria. Microarray analysis of CF cell grown biofilms treated with tobramycin revealed marked alterations in transcriptional profiles compared to untreated controls. Two tobramycin-induced genes were identified from this screen which, when deleted, exerted altered virulence phenotypes on airway epithelial cells in culture. Quantification of cytotoxicity of these mutants revealed either increased or decreased ability to kill the epithelial cells. Complementation with full-length copies of these genes restored wild-type function. These studies suggest a complex relationship between acute and chronic forms of P. aeruginosa, and that antibiotic treatment may influence transitions between these modes. It is this interplay that may determine the virulence status of the microorganism upon initial infection as well as during CF exacerbations.",

The primary difference was the amount of antibiotic retained in the lungs. Rats that inhaled soluble amikacin cleared approximately 84% of the amikacin from the lungs after 6 hr with concomitant 86% increase in drug levels in the urine. Rats that inhaled Arikace\u2122 cleared only 41% of the deposited amikacin from the lungs after 6hrs. This initial clearance of drug most likely reflected the amikacin released during nebulization. Extended clearance of Arikace\u2122 from the lungs was measured by recovery of amikacin in the urine at later time points. In a separate longer-term study comparing Arikace\u2122 and tobramycin, AUC (0-168 hr)for Arikace\u2122 in the lung was 56233 ug*hr/g while only 1150 ug*hr/ g for tobramycin which demonstrates a 4-fold increase in retention of antibiotic in the lung with Arikace\u2122. Eradication of P. aeruginosa from the lungs of rats with Arikace\u2122 was equal to tobramycin (given equivalent daily doses). However, Arikace\u2122 reduced the number of CFU in the lungs with a single daily exposure to the same degree as inhalation of tobramycin twice a day. Conclusions: Inhalation of Arikace\u2122 achieved higher concentrations and increased retention time of the antibiotic in the lungs of rats when compared to inhaled amikacin or tobramycin. It is expected that these properties of Arikace\u2122 will reduce dosing frequency and improve antimicrobial efficacy in patients.",

BACKGROUND: In childhood, the cystic fibrosis airway is characterized by persistent inflammation with high quantities of neutrophils. In this setting, recurrent exposure to low numbers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs routinely. Chronic infection by P. aeruginosa is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality in CF, and is believed to occur by formation of a biofilm in the CF airway. Previously, we have shown a significant neutrophil dependent enhancement of P. aeruginosa biofilm density that is greatest for low initial concentrations of P. aeruginosa. Biofilm enhancement is facilitated via neutrophil-derived DNA and F-actin, which form a framework that P. aeruginosa can exploit for growth. DNA and Factin polymerize via positively charged molecules such as histones. P. aeruginosa then associates with these polymers, which results in increased early biofilm density, displaying an increase of over 400 fold at 24 hours compared to P. aeruginosa in the absence of neutrophils.",

The biofilm assay is independent of cellular settling, as the reactor is vertically suspended in the culture. P. aeruginosa strains tested were PAO1, and two isogenic CF isolates recovered from an initial infection (Early), and following established infection ~4 years later (Late). Biofilms were formed by incubation of P. aeruginosa with human neutrophils for 24 to 48 hours in RPMI with 2% heat inactivated platelet poor plasma.",

In the presence of neutrophil products this action is sensitive to proteolytic degradation, but can be protected by the presence of protease inhibitors. DNase also disrupts a biofilm formed in the presence of human neutrophils. The combination of poly(Asp) + DNase resulted in an increase in biofilm disruption for a 24 hour biofilm. Biofilms allowed to form for 48 hours were more resistant to disruption by DNase and poly(Asp) as single agents, but the combination of both demonstrated a synergistic effect. Similar disruption of biofilms were observed when PAO1 was compared to Early and Late CF strains.",

Support: CFF, Max and Yetta Karasik Foundation Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may suffer increased morbidity and mortality through colonisation, allergy and invasive infection from fungi. The black yeast, Exophiala dermatitidis (synonym Wangiella dermatitidis) has been found with increasing frequency in sputum specimens of CF patients, with reported isolation rates ranging from between 1.1 and 15.7%. At present, no species-specific diagnostic PCR exists to aid with the clinical laboratory detection and identification of this organism. A novel species-specific PCR-based assay was developed for the detection of E. dermatitidis, based on employment of rDNA operons and interspacer (ITS) regions between these rDNA operons. Two novel primers, (designated ExdF & ExdR) were designed in silico with the aid of computer-aided alignment software and with the alignment of multiple species of Exophiala, as well as with other commonly described yeasts and filamentous fungi within CF sputum, including Candida, Aspergillus and Scedosporium. PCR employing ExdF (forward primer [16-,mer], 5'-CCG CCT ATT CAG GTC C-3') and ExdR (reverse primer [16-mer], 5'-TCT CTC CCA CTC CCG C-3'), was employed and optimized on extracted genomic DNA from a well characterized culture of E. dermatitidis, as well as with high quality genomic DNA template from a further 16 unrelated fungi, including Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, Scedosporium apiospermum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus versicolor, Pichia guilliermondii, Rhodotorula sp., Trichosporon sp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium sp., Mucor hiemalis, Bionectria ochroleuca, Gibberella pulicaris. Results demonstrated that only DNA from E. dermatitidis gave an amplification product of the expected size, whilst none of the other fungi were amplifiable. Subsequent direct employment of this primer pair detected this yeast in the sputum of 2/50 (4%) adult CF patients, employing a nested PCR approach with panfungal outer flanking primers of the ITS1-ITS2 region. These two patients were the only patients who were previously shown to have a cultural history of E. dermititidis from their sputum. E. dermatitidis is a slow-growing fungus, which usually takes up to two weeks to culture in the microbiology laboratory and therefore is slow to detect conventionally, with the risk of bacterial overgrowth from common co-habiting pan-and multiresistant bacterial pathogens from sputum, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex organisms, hence this species-specific PCR assay may help detect this organism from CF sputum more specifically and rapidly. Overall, employment of this novel assay may help in the understanding of the occurrence, aetiology and epidemiology of Exophiala dermatitidis, as an emerging fungal agent in patients with CF. Cystic fibrosis patients are particularly susceptible to infection by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex. Since 2001, the Pseudomonas Genome Database has been a resource for peer-reviewed, continually-updated annotations for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 reference strain's genome and, more recently, comparative analyses to several closely-related Pseudomonas species. In order to facilitate better cross-strain and cross-species genome comparisons, we have developed or are incorporating methods to improve the identification of orthologs (genes diverged due to speciation) and identify genes undergoing unusual selection. Our analysis of several completely sequenced Pseudomonas genomes has revealed that approximately 5% of ortholog predictions by the classic \"reciprocal best BLAST hit method\" are likely incorrect. We have also performed an analysis of unusually large intergenic regions in P. aeruginosa PAO1 that appear to be essential (according to saturation transposon mutagenesis) or involved in virulence (according to signature tagged mutagenesis). We identified at least 20 new putative protein-coding regions and non-coding RNAs that were not previously annotated and may play critical roles in microbial pathogenesis or viability. We are also focusing our attention on facilitating better cross-strain comparisons between recently sequenced Burkholderia cepacia complex genomes through development of a new online Burkholderia Genome Database. In addition to improved ortholog prediction, this new database will provide access to a very flexible Boolean search feature that allows researchers to search and compare annotations within or between the genomes of Burkholderia strains, returning annotations from multiple genomes suitable for simultaneous viewing and downstream analyses. We have also included new, very accurate protein subcellular localization predictions for the deduced proteome from each of these genomes -predictions that can aid the identification of new cell surface or secreted therapeutic targets or vaccine candidates. Further comparative analyses with other newly-sequenced, related strains should provide insight into strain-specific features that may be exploited to better understand virulence and antimicrobial resistance exhibited by CF-relevant pathogens.

Serum CRP may be a useful marker of pulmonary exacerbation in children. In the absence of pulmonary exacerbation, CF is not associated with elevated CRP values in children. The findings of this study could aid in identifying patients with pulmonary exacerbation earlier and initiate appropriate therapy sooner. Further studies are needed to determine whether CRP values are associated with the severity of the underlying disease, to what extent the PFT are affected, the age of the patient, the type of bacterial pathogen, and genetic factors. Background Pulmonary infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are commonly associated with structural lung diseases or airways clearance disorders such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We follow approximately 100 individuals with NTM pulmonary disease who share common clinical features but have no identifiable systemic immune defect or clearly defined predisposing conditions. The pulmonary disease and clinical presentation suggest these individuals may have disorders of ion transport or ciliary function. While some CFTR mutations and ciliary abnormalities are difficult to detect through standard genetic and ultrastructural analyses, in vivo physiologic tests of ion transport and measures of ciliary function may allow us to identify ion transport abnormalities in subjects with no identified CFTR abnormalities, determine the functional significance of novel CFTR mutations, and distinguish disorders of ciliary function from other airways clearance disorders.",

Department of Respiratory Medicine, Queen's University, Belfast, United Kingdom Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a clinically significant bacterial pathogen responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. Small non-coding micro(mi)RNA species (generally 80~100nts or less) in prokaryotes are involved in numerous cellular processes as is the case with eukaryotes. As in eukaryotes, these miRNAs act by base pairing with target mRNAs imposing translational and stability changes of mRNAs and thus culminating in the control and regulation of target mRNAs, crucial for bacterial stress responses and virulence to changing environments surrounding the infected zone or host cell (e.g. human airway epithelial cells). We recruited a commercial kit (Biodynamics DynaExpress miRNA Cloning Kit AV, Tokyo, Japan) and isolated miRNAs from a variety of Pseudomonas pathogens from plant, soil / agricultural environment (Pseudomonas syringae -PS), Type strain (Pseudomonas aeruginosa -PA) and a collection of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cfPA) from adult CF patients, who were chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. The results on the miRNA clones obtained exhibited a wide variation in the occurrence of miRNAs in this bacterium. The putative miRNAs obtained, cfPA in particular, yielded small non-coding RNAs of sizes from as little as 16nts to well over 45nts. An initial search using the bioinformatic tool sRNAPredict (www.waldorlab/tufts.edu) has not as yet, fully revealed the genomic annotations for these novel sRNA sequences in the inter-generic regions of the pathogenic pseudomonad group of bacteria. We present our data on these unknown cellular miRNAs cloned from cfPA isolates from CF patients and discuss their significance as novel regulators to bacterial stress responses and in the context of the bacterium's involvement as the predominant pulmonary pathogen, associated with cystic fibrosis.",

            "text": "Airway function is diminished in infants with CF diagnosed clinically but whether this is true for those identified by newborn screening remains unclear. We investigated whether lung function is diminished in infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening and if this occurs in association with pulmonary infection. Methods:Lung function was measured in asymptomatic infants with CF following sedation with chloral hydrate (60-100mg/kg) using the raised volume rapid thoracic compression technique at an inflation pressure of 30cmH 2 0. We measured forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume after 0.5 seconds (FEV 0.5 ) and forced expired flow at 75% expired FVC (FEF 75 ) which were then expressed as z scores. 1 Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed under general anesthesia within forty-eight hours following infant lung function testing. Three separate aliquots of 1mL/kg sterile saline were instilled into the right middle lobe and a further aliquot in the left lingula and the BAL fluid analyzed for bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens using routine culture techniques. Results: BAL was successful in all 24 infants studied aged 0.2 to 2.1 yrs (median 1.0 yrs) and lung function in 21 infants. Median (range) z scores for FVC, FEV 0.5 and FEF 75 were -1.3 (-2.7 to 1.6), -2.0 (-5.0 to 0.6) and -1.7 (-3.5 to 0.47) respectively. These decrements in lung function were all significant (p<0.01). BAL cultures were positive in 12 (50%) infants of whom 4 (17%) had evidence of infection with S. aureus and 1 (4%) with P. aeruginosa. In 12 infants there was no growth in BAL or growth only of mixed oral flora. Viruses were not identified in any infants. There was no association between any of the lung function parameters and pulmonary infection detected by BAL. Lung function was successful in a subgroup of 7 of 9 infants who were less than 0.5 yrs (median age 0.3 yrs) when tested. Diminished airway function was identified in this younger subgroup even though only one infant had evidence of pulmonary infection with respiratory organisms in BAL. In this younger subgroup median FEV 0.5 z score was -1.6 which was significantly below that predicted (95% CI: -2.3,-0.2 and p=0.03). Conclusions: Airway function is diminished in infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening and occurs irrespective of infection identified by BAL. Lung function is abnormal in very young infants before pulmonary symptoms develop and when no evidence of pulmonary infection can be detected in BAL. 1 Inhaled high-dose tobramycin appears to transiently clear P. aeruginosa (PA) from airway secretions in young children with CF, though inflammation may not be markedly reduced (Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2003; 167:841) . Because inhaled antibiotics may not reach some areas of infection, we hypothesized that intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics may be more effective than inhaled high-dose tobramycin for reducing lower airways inflammation in CF children with early PA infection. Study Design: We initiated a single-center, randomized, prospective study comparing the effects of two antibiotic treatment regimens on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory markers. Clinically stable CF children with a recent isolate of PA from surveillance cultures are randomized to receive 4 weeks of TOBI\u00ae (Group 1) or 2 weeks of i.v. ceftazidime and tobramycin (Group 2). BALF is obtained just before treatment, and repeated 4-6 weeks after completion of treatment. The primary study outcome is change in BALF % neutrophils (PMN). Multiple secondary outcomes are assessed including quantitative bacterial cultures and cytokines in BALF. This report summarizes interim analysis at the halfway point of the study.",

Methods: Our local CF database was searched for patients born 1985-2000. Patients were included in the analysis if they were followed in our CF center before the age of 5. Patients were separated into two birth cohorts, born 1985-1992 (cohort 1) and 1993-2000 (cohort 2). Yearly peak FEV1% predicted from ages 6-12 were obtained using Knudson reference equations. Yearly peak BMI% and weight-for-age% at each age were also obtained. Type 3 tests of fixed effects and repeated measures analyses were used to assess mean peak BMI%, mean peak weight-for-age%, mean peak FEV1% predicted at first PFT, mean peak FEV1% predicted from ages 6-12, and mean rate of change (slope analysis) in peak FEV1% predicted from ages 6-12. Chi-square test for association was used to analyze differences in demographic parameters. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess differences in age at diagnosis. Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used to analyze differences in mean clinic visits per year. Chi-square testing with a two sided alpha of p <0.05 was used to determine significance.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Improvements in lung function and nutritional outcomes in our CF center are associated with an increase in the mean number of clinical visits per year for CF patients ages 6-12. The frequency of clinical follow-up is a marker of CF care that may have positive impacts on CF outcomes. BACKGROUND: Current management of CF airway disease includes the use of key pharmacological therapies designed to combat the chronic cycle of obstruction, infection, and inflammation. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that maintenance therapy with azithromycin (AZM), dornase alfa (DNAse), and tobramycin for inhalation (TOB) each improves pulmonary function and reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with P. aeruginosa. The purpose of this study was to determine if CF patients in an uncontrolled environment (clinical setting), experience a reduced rate of pulmonary function decline when receiving AZM + DNAse + TOB compared to those not on all three therapies. METHODS: Adult CF patients were selected based on positive sputum cultures for P. aeruginosa, pulmonary function test results (FEV 1 % predicted) for the past year, and receiving one of the key pharmacological therapies. In addition data was collected on CFRD, depression, medication adherence, airway clearance, and nutritional status. Patients were stratified according to baseline pulmonary function: mild (FEV 1 ), moderate (FEV 1 of 40-70%), and severe (FEV 1 <40%). Patients were then sub-grouped as to whether they were receiving all 3 or \u2264 2 of the key therapies. The annual rate of decline in % predicted FEV 1 was determined using linear regression on non-exacerbation data and was categorized as stable (<2.3% decline), intermediate (2.3-4.1%) , or rapidly declining (> 4.1%). Time to intermediate or rapid decline in pulmonary function was determined using Cox proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS: 107 patients (54 males/53 females, median age 28 years) were included in this study; 28 with mild, 42 with moderate, and 35 with severe pulmonary disease. Overall, the mild and moderate groups experienced median declines of 2.12% and 1.50%, while the severe group experienced a 2.41% improvement in FEV 1 % predicted respectively. The use of regimens containing AZM therapy significantly delayed time to intermediate or rapid decline in lung function in the mild group (median 210 days vs. 49.5 days, HR=0.19, p=0.013). Similarly, regimens containing DNAse + AZM + TOB significantly delayed time to intermediate or rapid decline in lung function in the mild group (median 231 days vs. 105 days, HR=0.27, p=0.048). No significant differences were seen in the moderate or severe group for patients receiving all 3 or individual therapies. CON-CLUSION: Administration of pharmacological regimens containing DNAse + AZM + TOB, or AZM + TOB or AZM + DNAse significantly delay progression of pulmonary disease in CF patients with mild lung disease.",

Forced expiratory flows are reported as Z scores, while fractional lung volumes are reported as % predicted. Objective: Clinicians use PFTs to assess effectiveness of therapy in hospitalized CF patients. However, the variability of multiple PFT efforts has not been described in this group of patients. Previous study of within day variation of PFTs has been reported in healthy adults and children (Enright, 2004, and Nickerson, 1980) and clinically stable outpatients with CF (Nickerson, 1980, and Cooper, 1990) . Nickerson and Cooper found coefficient of variations (CV) for FVC of 1.9-6%, FEV 1 of 2.4-5.3%, and FEF 25-75 of 7.4-9.3% for adults and children with CF.

In 7 of 24 subjects (29.2%) there was at least one sustained change in FEV 1 that correlated with either stopping or starting a particular treatment. The figure shows two significant changes in FEV 1 in one patient related to medication changes. There is an increase in FEV 1 at the initiation of aerosolized 7% saline and a fall in FEV 1 that corresponded to inhaled tobramycin use. The improvement on hypertonic saline increased this patient's enthusiasm for this treatment. Conclusions: Home FEV 1 monitoring is feasible and appears to provide accurate measurement of pulmonary function. It can provide clinicians with objective data to tailor treatments without necessitating a clinic visit. Feedback from home monitoring may improve medication adherence and may allow treatments to be individually tailored based on patient responses to the medications. 1 1.

The regression line indicates that for each drop of two FEV 1 SDS, each child receives an extra 3mSv in radiation exposure from CXRs and chest CTs alone. Similarly, each child receives an extra 2mSv in radiation exposure from CXRs and chest CTs for every 100 days of hospital admission.

Background: Exhaled volatile compounds have attracted attention as potential non-invasive biomarkers of chronic lung disease. Early sustained airway inflammation and bacterial infection are characteristic features of pulmonary involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF). The cellular response is dominated by neutrophils, which have been shown to generate oxygen-and halogen-derived radicals as part of their host defense armamentarium.",

Inhaled tobramycin (actual or recommended dose of 300 mg/5ml) has been associated with reductions in health care costs; these cost savings offset between 37% and 57% of the cost of this therapy. Antibiotic therapy for pulmonary exacerbations generally resulted in lower health care costs when administered in a home setting rather than a hospital setting. Use of rhDNase led to reduction in health care costs, with higher reductions observed in patients with higher levels of use; the cost savings offset between 17% and 38% of the drug cost. Cost-of-illness studies have been conducted in 7 different countries; the economic estimates varied widely across studies due to differences in treatment patterns, health systems, methodologies, and patient populations. Most cost-of-illness studies were retrospective observational studies from the perspective of a hospital or third-party payer, and the cost of CF ranged from $9,000 to $64,000 per patient per year. The largest cost categories included hospitalizations, out-patient visits, rhDNase and antibiotics, while disease severity and presence of Pa infection were common determinants of cost. Cost-of-illness studies have underestimated societal costs because they have rarely considered patient time costs and none have considered indirect costs (e.g., burden on lost productivity or informal caregivers).",

Methods We reviewed the records of 10 CF women who chose to remain pregnant (12 babies [7 male] from 11 pregnancies), looking at changes in lung function, BMI, respiratory exacerbations during pregnancy, clinic attendance, and oral and IV antibiotic therapy (home and inpatient care) during pregnancy and also in the first year post delivery. We devised a questionnaire to examine how patients coped with pregnancy and the demands of motherhood, focussing on changes in compliance with therapy, worries regarding the effect of CF treatments on the baby, and support given by the CF team.",

            "text": "Geller, D.E.; Kesser, K.C. Research, Nemours Children's Clinic, Orlando, FL, USA Background: Alpha-1 antiprotease (\u03b1-1AP) is being developed as an inhaled drug in CF to inactivate excess elastase in the lungs. It is estimated that tens of milligrams of \u03b1-1AP need to be deposited in the lungs to be effective. Delivering a high dose with conventional jet nebulizers may be too time-consuming. We speculated that slowing and prolonging inspiration could optimize \u03b1-1AP delivery. The I-neb\u00ae Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD\u00ae system, Respironics) is a portable, electronic, battery-powered, mesh nebulizer that uses the AAD algorithms to deliver drug in the first portion of inspiration. Interchangeable mouthpieces allow the I-neb to be used in a conventional tidal breathing mode (TBM) or in the target inhalation mode (TIM) that guides the patient to inhale very slowly. The low residual volume after nebulization reduces drug waste and optimizes efficiency. We compared delivery efficiency of \u03b1-1AP in vitro with the I-neb in the TBM vs. 2 TIM modes. Methods: We studied 3 new I-neb devices using TBM (tidal volume [Vt] 0.5L, respiratory rate [RR]=15, I-time=2 seconds), TIM-6 (Vt 1.6L, RR=6, I-time=6 sec), and TIM-9 (Vt 1.6L, RR=4, I-time=9 sec) using a breath simulator. Nebulizers were filled with 0.5 mL \u03b1-1AP (50 mg/mL). Nebulized drug was captured on a filter and measured via spectrophotometer (inhaled dose), and particle size was measured with an Insitec laser system. Results: Median particle sizes for the 3 modes were similar (4.4-4.8 \u00b5m) . The dose emitted from the I-neb was very high, and similar between modes (82-90% of nominal dose). Predicted lung doses for these experiments were calculated from a previous scintigraphy study (Nikander 2006 ) that showed 63% of the emitted dose deposited with TBM and 73% with TIM. Predicted lung dose of \u03b1-1AP (as % of nominal) and delivery times were TBM: 56.6% in 7.5 min, TIM-6: 59.9% in 4.4 min, and TIM-9: 64.5% in 2.5 min. Discussion: The I-neb has a very high predicted lung dose with both TBM and TIM. However, TIM reduces the time of administration to as little as 1/3 that of tidal breathing. If larger predicted lung dose is necessary to see a clinical effect, either the initial drug volume or drug concentration may be increased. We conclude that slow, deep, controlled inspirations using I-neb is a very efficient method to deliver \u03b1-1AP, and is faster than tidal breathing. We also speculate that TIM has the additional potential advantage of better distribution of drug in the lungs because of slower flow rate and particle velocity. Objective: early inflammation was observed in infants with CF regardless the occurrence of bacterial infection. Lung function (LF) is a tool to assess bronchial inflammation consequences. Few data are available on the pronostic value of impaired LF in infancy.",

Omitting a loading dose and using a lower maintenance dose may help selected patients tolerate voriconazole. Nebulised liposomal amphotericin was tolerated by our children with CF and ABPA who did not tolerate or responded poorly to voriconazole. Recent studies have shown that high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a more accurate method of evaluating early lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) than pulmonary function tests (PFTs) or chest x-rays. Since young children can not perform the breathing maneuvers required for high quality HRCT, lung volume control is necessary. Positive pressure facemask ventilation using chloral hydrate allows full inspiration and end exhalation images, but requires special expertise. Controlled ventilation can also be produced with general anesthesia (GA). GA has not been reported in children undergoing HRCT for CF research. The advantages of GA over sedation include rapid onset, faster recovery and reliability of scan completion. The undesirable effects of sedation are unpredictability and the higher failure rates. Additionally, failed sedation contributed significantly to parental dissatisfaction. (Malviya, et al., 2000) . The primary outcome of our study was to examine the safety of using GA for HRCT scans and the quality of images obtained. A secondary outcome was parental satisfaction.",

Whey protein is rich in sulfhydryl (SH) groups and is recognized for its ability to increase glutathione and reduce oxidative stress. Hyperbaric pressure treatment of whey protein increases its digestibility, promotes the release of novel peptides for absorption, increases intracellular glutathione in healthy subjects (Zavorsky et al, Int J Vit Nutr Res, 2007) , and reduces in vitro production of IL-8 (Vilela et al, Inter Immnuopharmacol, 2006) . We present here the initial results of a pilot study of supplementation with pressurized whey in CF patients. Children and adults with CF were supplemented with hyperbaric whey protein for 1 month (20 gm/day in patients less than 18 years of age, 40 gm/day in older patients). Anthropometric measures, pulmonary function, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and plasma lipid peroxides were measured before and after supplementation. The results of the first 11 patients to have completed the study are reported, with further data to be presented. In 7/11 subjects weight increased and in 7/11 subjects lean body mass increased. There were no significant changes in FEV1 or FEV/FVC ratio. In 7/11 patients the CRP fell (4/7 by more than 50%) and in 2/11 the CRP increased. In the remaining two patients, the CRP was undetectable at baseline and did not change at follow-up. Plasma lipid peroxides decreased in the three patients in whom it could be measured (2/3 to undetectable levels). These preliminary results suggest that supplementation with pressurized whey protein can reduce systemic inflammation in CF patients and has the potential to beneficially modulate the inflammatory response in CF patients.",

            "text": "Supported by the BREATHE Initiative of the Canadian CF Foundation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Soon after its introduction, the mesh technology based Pari eFlow\u00ae nebulizer gained preference over jet nebulization in the CF community because of its short nebulization time, portability and noiseless operation. Concerns were raised about the durability of the device due to expected vulnerability of the mesh. The aim of this study was to compare the particle size distributions in the aerosol, delivered doses and output rates from the eFlow and the Pari LC Plus\u00ae(LC+)with PariTur-boBoy compressor before and after use in daily practice. LC+ nebulizers in use by the adult patients taking part in the study were taken in for testing and new eFlows, cleaning instructions and a disinfection device were provided. After 6 months use (3 cycles of 2x28 doses TSI: 300 mg/5 ml), the eFlows were collected by the local CF center. Particle size distributions were measured at a constant flow rate of 30 l/min with a laser diffraction apparatus. Because of uncertainty regarding the cleaning procedure after last use, 8 additional e-Flows were collected from the same patients after another period of 6 months use. Conclusions: New eFlows produce slightly larger droplets in a narrower size range than new LC+ nebulizers. After use in daily practice, droplet size distribution changes for both devices. Output rate (delivered dose per minute) decreases for both devices. For used eFlows delivered dose is lower than for used LC+ nebulizers, because the eFlow is programmed to switch off after 10 min, even when nebulization is still incomplete (9 out of 21 tested eFlows). This may result in a considerable reduction of delivered dose. However, when a mesh is replaced, performance is the same as that of a new device, suggesting that the changes in performance originate in the vibrating mesh. For daily practice these results indicate: (1) the performance of both nebulizers changes during use but the changes are smaller for eFlow than for LC+ (2) changes in droplet size distribution are relatively small for both devices;in contrast with output rate and delivered dose (3) proper functioning of eFlow can be improved by timely replacement of the mesh, ultimately when eFlow switches off after 10 minutes. Without replacement, the delivered dose is unpredictable.",

Each CF child received a mean (median) effective radiation dose of 1.47 (0.04) mSv/year with a range of 0.004 -25.76mSv/year. The reason for the skewed distribution was identified by analysing the proportions of the procedures to the total effective dose in this population: fluoroscopy 83.2%, chest CT 7.1%, sinus CT 6.3%, CXRs 2.5%, AXRs 0.7% and HRCT 0.2%. It was calculated that these patients undergo 3.4 CXRs per patient per year. We calculated that an average patient diagnosed by newborn screening could expect to receive 1.24mSv from ionizing radiation procedures between birth and age 16. Biannual CT chest scans in addition to median exposures for each age group from AXRs, sinus CTs and fluoroscopy would potentially result in 14.34 mSv by age 16, an 11 fold increase.",

Division of Pediatric Pulmonology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA Do Hispanic and Caucasian CF patients share the same frequency of pulmonary exacerbations? Increased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations is linked to increased risk for CF morbidity and mortality. We have previously reported that pediatric Hispanic CF patients have greater mortality than our Caucasian CF patients who attend the same accredited CF Center. We performed a retrospective review of CF pulmonary exacerbations (defined as physician prescription of intravenous or oral antibiotic therapy) in our CF patients who routinely attended the CF Clinic during the period of January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006. Data collected included demographics, number of intravenous antibiotic courses and number of oral antibiotic courses. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare age of the groups and Chi-square was used to compare use of intravenous and oral antibiotics between Hispanic and Caucasian CF patients as well as between males and females. During the study period, there was a total of 197 CF patients (106 Males:91 Females; mean age 10.8 \u00b1 5.7 years). Of the 197 patients, 82 (42%) were classified as Hispanic (46 Males:36 Females; mean age 11.0 \u00b1 5.3 years) and 99 (50%)were classified as Caucasian (49 Males:50 Females; mean age 10.8 \u00b1 6.2 years; p=0.42, ns). Hispanic CF patients (51 patients had 299 episodes; 26 Males:25 Females) had significantly greater number of pulmonary exacerbations (received treatment with intravenous and/or oral antibiotics) than Caucasian CF patients (35 patients had 182 episodes; p = 0.0006). Hispanic CF patients who required intravenous antibiotic therapy were significantly younger (12.3 \u00b1 5.1 years vs 15.0 \u00b1 5.9 years; p<0.00001) than the Caucasian CF patients who were treated with intravenous antibiotics. There was no significant difference in age between Hispanic and Caucasian CF patients who received oral antibiotic courses (11.2 \u00b1 5.3 years vs 13.1 \u00b1 6.4 years; p=0.08, ns). Gender did not have a significant impact on pulmonary exacerbation risk in our population (Hispanic IV use by gender p=0.82; Hispanic oral use by gender p=0.12; Caucasian IV use by gender p=0.38; Caucasian oral use by gender p=0.37). We conclude that Hispanic CF patients had increased incidence of pulmonary exacerbations than Caucasian CF patients who attend the same CF Clinic. Hispanic patients who were treated with intravenous antibiotics were younger than the Caucasian CF patients. We speculate that Hispanic ethnicity has a major impact on the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. Other factors, such as modifier genes, environmental exposures, or inflammatory responses, may play a role in the increased risk of pulmonary exacerbations in the Hispanic CF population.

The total number of infections detected in BAL was not related to bronchectasis. However, children with bronchiectasis had a higher incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within the first 3 years of life (50% vs. 25%). Conclusions: Bronchiectasis is evident within the first five years of life and appears to be associated with an exaggerated inflammatory response and the early acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

(1, 2) Strategies to address these allergies are essential to maintain effective antibiotic treatment in this population. Antibiotic desensitization is the process by which one induces immune tolerance by incremental exposure to the antibiotic, which may induce stabilization of mast cells. The mechanism remains undetermined but may be mediated via IgE or memory T-cells. Prior to the study period, 9 standardized antibiotic desensitization protocols were developed by an Allergist/Immunologist based on published reports and were approved through the hospital's Pharmacy and Therapeutics committee.",

Cumulative decline in lung function as measured by FEV 1 in cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbation is a major cause of CF-related morbidity and mortality. High-dose extended interval aminoglycoside (HDEI AG) use may be more effective in improving lung function than traditional multiple daily dosing in CF-related pulmonary exacerbation. Intermittent dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics are often used with HDEI AG in patients with CF pulmonary exacerbation, which does not optimize betalactam pharmacodynamics. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of HDEI AG plus continuous infusion beta-lactam (CIBL) on patients' return to best baseline FEV 1 from the previous 12 months.",

This evidence suggests that this might be an alternative to intermittent beta-lactam therapy. Follow up data on remaining patients may provide sufficient evidence to validate this hypothesis. Respiratory exacerbation in cystic fibrosis patients is characterized by increased sputum that may become more purulent. The detection of the exacerbation is based mainly on clinical subjective parameters. FEV1 measurements are accepted as gold standard to be used for the life-time of the patient but do not adapt fast enough after resolution of an exacerbation. We compared parameters that are affected by the uneven distribution of ventilation in the lung due to increase sputum. Methods: A Zen body plethysmograph was used to measure TLC, FEV1 and DLCO (CO/CH3 mixture). TLC was also calculated by the volume of CH3, the angle of the slope of phase III was calculated in 20 CF patients at the beginning of the respiratory exacerbation and after 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Patients were 17 -30 years old (12M/8F). Results: FEV1 changed by 9.8+7.41% at the end of the antibiotic treatment, the TLC(pleth) however was stable and changed by only 0.9+8.7%. The RV/TLC decreased by 23.8+ 23.4% and the TLC(gas) was increased by 5+36.6%. The difference between TLC (pleth) and TLC (gas) before and after the antibiotic treatment decreased from 24.7+13.6% to 10.2+7.1 %. Conclusion: the changes in the parameters affected by the unevenness of distribution of ventilation (m/p reflecting the increased sputum in the airway) are more pronounced than FEV1 and may be used as a more sensitive parameter for assessing the course of respiratory exacerbation.",

Pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) are episodes of worsening of respiratory symptoms that commonly occur in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In clinical trials of new therapies in CF, pulmonary exacerbation is widely used as a primary or secondary endpoint. Despite its importance, no single clearly agreed upon definition exists. Some are based on patient reported symptoms while others require hospitalization or antibiotic prescription. Use of different definitions makes it difficult to compare the results across studies and also to plan future studies. Moreover, the rate of PEs (proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation over a given time-period) is affected by baseline patient characteristics such as age, FEV 1 and medication use at the start of the clinical trial; factors which also contribute to the difficulty in comparing trials.",

For illustration, we assume a two group study with two-sided significance level 0.05 and 80% power. If the control group rate is 30%, then approximately 200 subjects per group are required to detect a relative rate reduction of 40% (corresponding to a treatment group rate of 18%). However, if the control group rate is 65%, then only approximately 70 subjects per group are required to detect the same relative rate reduction of 40% (corresponding to a treatment group rate of 39%). Thus, a PE definition that selects for a greater PE rate in the control group will require fewer study subjects to detect the same relative rate reduction given that all other variables remain equal. Sample size requirements can be further reduced by analyzing the number of events or the time to first event instead of the proportion of subjects who have at least one PE during a given time period.",

Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a vicious cycle of obstruction, infection and inflammation. The inflammatory response, which is profound and excessive relative to the burden of bacteria, is characterized by a massive neutrophil (PMN) influx. CF patients often experience intermittent declines in lung function associated with increases in both bacterial burden and PMN influx. These pulmonary exacerbations require treatment with antibiotics. There are substantive issues in the identification of pulmonary exacerbations and the assessment of therapies. A marker which indicates the inflammatory state of the lung would be useful to identify infective/inflammatory exacerbations, as opposed to worsening due to pulmonary vascular disease, or simply upper airway infection (cold), and might guide therapy for intensity and duration.",

Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, FL, USA Mucociliary transport is an important component of airway host defense against inhaled particles and microbial pathogens. Mucociliary clearance is hypothesized to be defective in cystic fibrosis allowing for airway colonization and infection. Current methods for measuring mucociliary transport and clearance lack the ability to measure mucociliary transport in specific proximal and distal airway segments. Using a 64-slice high resolution CT scanner (SOMATOM 64, Siemens), we are developing a method to track radiopaque particle movement in the swine airway. Swine were induced with ketamine/acepromazine, intubated, and then anesthesia maintained with propofol infusions. Animals spontaneously breathed humidified air with the endotracheal tube cuff deflated. Radiopaque Teflon/bismuth trioxide disks (1 mm diameter, 0.8 mm thick) were instilled via a catheter into the airways. Serial CT images (0.6 mm slice thickness and slice increment of 0.5 mm) were obtained every 2 minutes for a total of 20 minutes. Airway tree segmentation was performed using Pulmonary Workstation 1.1 (VIDA Diagnostics, Iowa City, IA). This program allows for fully automated airway tree segmentation. Baseline mucociliary transport rates (2-dimensional) were 15.6 \u00b1 2.6 mm/min. Following aerosol delivery of human sputum leukocyte elastase (150 mU), mucociliary transport was markedly diminished (5.0 \u00b1 1.1 mm/min) at 45 minutes. Thus far, we are able to measure mucociliary transport down to the 3rd generation airways. Future studies include more distal deposition and measurement of particle movement. In summary, this novel method measures mucociliary transport in defined airways and will allow us to examine the effect of altered airway epithelial function on mucociliary transport. lung transplant. Purpose: To design a CT scoring system to quantify structural abnormalities on CT scans from CF patients with Severe Advanced Lung Disease (SALD) and to investigate the correlation between CT scores and survival. Materials and methods: CT scans of 57 CF patients screened for lung transplant between 1990 and 2005 were collected from 3 transplant centres. All scans were scored with the Brody II scoring system. To design a new scoring system sensitive for the specific changes in SALD, a panel of 3 experts reviewed a random set of 10 CT scans on eligible items to be used in a pilot analysis. The resulting SALD scoring system consisted of four items: bulla/cysts; areas with consolidation/mucous; areas with hypo perfusion/air trapping and hyper/normal perfusion. In each CT slice (10 mm spacing) and for each of the items the surface area of corresponding lung tissue involved was estimated on a 0-100% scale. Total surface area for the 5 items and each slice added up to 100%. The final SALD score was a mean volume estimate of abnormal and normal lung tissue.",

            "text": "Results: Pilot analysis of a set of 25 CT scans showed a a spectrum of abnormalities, ranging from predominantly bronchiectasis to predominantly mosaic perfusion. A moderate correlation was found between the SALD components inflammation and hypo perfusion/ air trapping and Brody score (p=0.004, R=0.55 and p=0.006, R=0.536). The inter-observer variability of both scoring systems was comparable. (Ri ranging from 0.70 to 0.83) Analysis of the complete cohort with the Brody II score showed a significant correlation with survival with a hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% CI of 1.07 to 5.33) for dying on the waiting list for every ten point increase in Brody II score. (p=0.02). The Brody component scores for bronchiectasis, airway wall thickening and parenchyma showed a similar correlation with hazard ratios (95% CI's) of respectively 1.9 (0.98-3.73), 1.9 (1.03-3.35) and 5.3 (1.44-19.2) for every ten point increase in score. (p=0.044, 0.028 and 0.01). The preliminary results with the Brody score suggest that it is useful to include CT information in prediction models. It is likely that the predictive value of the CT can for survival can be further improved using the dedicated SALD-CT score. Scoring of the remaining scans according to the SALD system is ongoing and will be completed shortly. Snell, G. 2 1. Physiotherapy, The Alfred, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 2. Allergy, Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, The Alfred, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 3. Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 4. Radiology, The Alfred, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Background Despite the widespread use of airway clearance (AC) techniques to clear excessive secretions and improve lung function, little is known about their efficacy following lung transplant (LT). This study aimed to compare the effects of two AC strategies (proactive vs reactive) on a range of clinical outcomes following LT. Methods A prospective randomized trial design with stratification for suppurative pre-LT disease was used. Consecutive patients at 1 month post LT were eligible for inclusion. Subjects were excluded if medically unstable, ventilator dependent or had a contraindication to performing positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy. Patients performed AC using PEP either twice daily (proactive strategy) or only in the presence chest infection (reactive strategy). Lung function (FEV 1 and FVC), chest radiography (Brasfield score), exercise capacity (6 minute walk) and bronchoscopic airway characteristics (anastomotic healing, patency and secretions) were assessed at 1, 2 and 3 months post LT. Patient adherence and satisfaction were measured. Results Of 60 consecutive patients, 36 (18 in each group) were recruited and completed the study. Both groups improved lung function (FEV 1 72 \u00b1 4% to 81 \u00b1 4 % p<0.0001; FVC 69 \u00b1 3% to 81 \u00b1 3% p<0.0001), Brasfield scores (17.8 \u00b1 0.5 to 19.8 \u00b1 0.5 p<0.002) and 6 minute walk (451\u00b1 16m to 545 \u00b1 16m p<0.0001) over the study period. No significant differences between groups for any outcome were found. The vast majority had fully healed, 100% patent anastomoses without secretions at 3 months. There were no significant differences between airway characteristics and incidence of chest infection. Adherence to both strategies was high (84% proactive, 100% reactive). Conclusion In the absence of significant differences in outcomes, it is recommended that AC only be performed in the presence of chest infection based on greater treatment cost and treatment time required by a proactive strategy. Further studies in those with reduced anastomotic patency and in those with recurrent chest infections later post-transplant are warranted. Supported by an Alfred Trusts Grant.",

Allergy, Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, The Alfred, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 3. Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; 4. School of Physiotherapy, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Background The optimal duration and structure of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for lung transplant (LT) recipients is not known. This study aimed to describe changes in functional outcomes in LT recipients who participated in a post LT PR program at The Alfred, Melbourne, Australia. Methods Prospective, repeated measures design. Functional exercise capacity (six minute walk test-6MWT), lung function (FEV 1 , FVC) and quality of life (SF 36) were assessed at 1, 2 and 3 months following LT. Following discharge, all subjects attended a 1 hour supervised outpatient exercise training class 3 days per week until 12 weeks post LT and 6 education sessions. Patients with post-operative complications were excluded. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA with repeated measures. Results 60 consecutive LT recipients from Sept 2003 to Mar 2005 were assessed for inclusion. 36 (50% male) subjects, mean age 46 \u00b1 14 yrs were recruited and completed the study. 81% had undergone bilateral LT. 33% had cystic fibrosis, 31% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significant improvements were demonstrated in 6MWT (451 \u00b1 16m to 545 \u00b1 16m, p<0.001), FEV 1 (72 \u00b1 4 % to 81 \u00b1 4%, p<0.0001), FVC (74 \u00b1 4% to 78 \u00b1 4%, p<0.0001) and all quality of life domains, p<0.05. The greatest changes in 6MWT and lung function were seen between 1 and 2 months. Conclusion Functional exercise capacity, lung function and quality of life improved significantly over the first 3 months in LT recipients who participated in PR at our institution. These data will allow benchmarking with other centres and program structures. Supported by an Alfred Trusts Grant. Does gender play a role in perception of CF quality of life domains before and after lung transplantation? The CF quality of life (CFQ-R) for patients \u043c14 years of age is a disease-specific instrument. Previous studies using this instrument have reported that CF females have higher scores in weight and body perception than CF males. To determine the impact of lung transplantation on gender-based perception of quality of life, we reviewed the CFQ-R on all CF patients \u043c14 years of age and who underwent successful lung transplantation at our center. CFQ-R was administered 1-3 months prior to transplant surgery and then 3 months after lung transplantation while the patients were in the outpatient clinic setting. Domains measured: Physical, Role, Vitality, Emotion, Social, Body Image, Eating, Treatment Burden, Health Status, Weight, Respiratory Symptoms, and Digestion. The CFQ-R responses were computer-scored and Domain scores were then generated (score 0-100, 100=better). During the 2 1 \u20442 year study period, 14 CF patients underwent successful lung transplantation (5 Males:9 Females; mean age 16.1 \u00b1 2.5 years). Prior to lung transplantation, female CF patients had lower Physical Domain scores but higher scores in Health Status perceptions than the male CF lung transplant candidates (see graph). All patients had marked improvement in all domains 3 months after lung transplantation (see graph). After transplant surgery, CF males had higher scores than CF females in Emotion and in Eating Domains. Scores for Body Image Domain were similar for both genders before and 3-months after lung transplantation. We conclude that although there were differences in Physical and Health Domain perceptions prior to lung transplantation, both male and female pediatric CF patients had marked improvement in all domains after lung transplantation. However, female CF lung transplant recipients had lower Emotion and Eating Domain scores after transplantation. We speculate that lower scores in these domains may reflect increased post-traumatic stress and depression in female lung transplant recipients. Further study on CF Quality of Life in pediatric lung transplant recipients is on-going.",

            "text": "Discussion CFLD patients undergoing lung Tx did not have a worse prognosis than patients without CFLD. Transient elevation of LFTs were seen in the immediate post-Tx period but settled either spontaneously or after discontinuation of azathioprine. We conclude that selected patients with cirrhosis due to CFLD may be safely offered lung Tx without concomitant liver Tx. Infectious mononucleosis, commonly called mononucleosis, or \"mono,\" is an illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Mononucleosis has been nicknamed the \"kissing disease\" because the Epstein-Barr virus commonly is transmitted in saliva during kissing. However, sneezes and coughs also can transmit the virus occasionally. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) permanently infects more than 90% of the people on Earth, but it causes symptomatic mononucleosis only in a small number. In developed nations, such as the United States, mononucleosis most often occurs between the ages of 15 and 25. Unfortunately EBV can not only infect, but can also transform, B cells after transplant and may lead to lymphoma with a resulting ~50% mortality rate. The source of EBV is presumed to be passenger lymphocytes in the donor tissue and those at greatest risk are patients who are EBV naive before transplant. Since most CF patients with endstage lung disease in the developed world are now being referred for transplant given the success of this intervention, we reviewed our entire lung transplant database to determine the nature of EBV infection and the likelihood of developing lymphoma following lung transplantation. Of 272 first-time lung transplants, 178 (65%) had CF. EBV serology was not available in 27 (15 CF, 12 others) before transplant. 34 of 163 (21%) CF patients were EBV seronegative before transplant as compared to 4 of 82 (5%) patients with other end stage lung diseases (composed mostly of COPD and IPF) in the control population (Chi Square p < 0.001). The CF EBV seronegative cohort was 24 (SD 9) years old on average, an age when most seroconversion has already occurred in our society. Of the CF EBV seronegatives, 27 survived beyond 3 months and were thus at risk for post transplant lymphoma. Of these 27, 8 developed lymphoma (incidence = 30%) in comparison to 1 of the 4 EBV seronegative controls (incidence = 25%, p = NS). All lymphomas were stage IV at presentation and the majority (9 of 11) arose in the first post transplant year. The CF EBV seronegatives who developed lymphoma did not differ from those who did not with regard to levels of immunosuppression (cyclosporine, methylprednisolone or prednisone) or doses of antiviral therapy (i.e., ganciclovir which is active against both CMV and EBV). In addition, the cessation of anti-lymphocyte antibody induction therapy in the summer of 1995, somewhat surprisingly, had no impact on the development of lymphoma. Two cases of lymphoma developed in CF EBV seropositives (incidence = 1.2%) and no cases of lymphoma developed in the control EBV seropositives (p = NS). Thus EBV seronegativity raises the lymphoma risk 25 fold in CF patients (p < 0.001). Two of the 11 (18%) cases of lymphoma resulted in death (one CF and one other) and one CF patient probably died of complications related to chemotherapy even though he was tumor free at that time. Lymphoma outcome was not stage or clonality dependent. In conclusion, CF lung transplant recipients are at an increased risk for lymphoma largely due to their lack of exposure to EBV before transplant. Kissing more before transplant may lower the risk of lymphoma afterward. University Hospital UZB, Brussels, Belgium; 2. Chest Medicine, Erasme University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium; 3.

We retrospectively assessed the incidence/treatment of genital/anal HPV-associated lesions in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung tx recipients. The files of all 74 tx patients transplanted in the ULB center between 1988 and 01/2007 (38 men/36 women, median age 24\u00b17.5, range 8-45 yrs) were reviewed. Maintenance IS consisted in chronic triple therapy combining a calcineurin inhibitor, a cell cycle inhibitor and corticosteroids. Median survival was 46.5 \u00b1 44.4 months (range 0-186). Ten of 60 sexually active patients (17%) who survived \u226512 months post-tx developed HPV-associated genital/anal lesions: 3 men (35-41 yrs) and 7 women (25-41 yrs). Genital/anal HPV-PCR proven condylomata were diagnosed between 62-97 months in the men and between 14-90 months post-tx in the women. All 10 underwent local treatment (cryotherapy \u00b1 laser \u00b1 topical imiquimod), 3/10 patients underwent multiple treatments under general anesthesia. Recurrence of the condylomata was high. One male patient presented high-grade anal dysplasia and 3 women moderate to high-grade cervical dysplasia; 2 underwent conization and one complete hysterectomy after 2 conizations. One of the females presented both condylomata and a high grade cervical dysplasia.",

Pediatric nephrology and hepatology, Medical School, Hannover, Germany; 3. Visceral and transplant surgury, Medical School, Hannover, Germany Liver disease is an important comortality and comorbidity in CF patients even in the pediatric age group. Liver transplantation (LTX) is an accepted option in end stage liver disease. Nevertheless the clinical outcome in CF patients is still under discussion. Here we reported the clinical outcome 12 months after isolated liver Tx in pediatric CF-patients.Since 2000 n=9 LTX were performed in children (male n=7, female n=2; age (mean\u00b1SD) 14,1\u00b13 years) . Immunosuppressive therapy was done with ciclosporin \u00b1 basilixumab and steroid. We followed pulmonary function, CN-score, nutritional status (BMI Z-score) and body com-position, airway cultures and IgG.Results:All were still alive 12 months after LTX. Before LTX all patients had a mild to moderate pulmonary disease: FVC(%pred) 92,2\u00b116 (71,4%-119), FEV1(%pred) 88,7\u00b116,1 (68-103), MEF25(%pred) 61, 7\u00b1 28,5 (35-114) , CN-Score 8\u00b14,3 points. Nutritional status: BMI(mean) 17,2\u00b11,8% (range: 15,3%-20,3%, Z-score: 0,88\u00b10,86), upper arm circumference(cm)(mean\u00b1SD) 17,8\u00b10,9, triceps skin fat fold(cm) 5,2\u00b11,2. Body composition: 13,5\u00b17,2% of bodyweight were fat. One year after LTX all patients were still in a stable pulmonary situation: FVC(%pred) 93,9\u00b114 (range:75,5%-114%), FEV1(%pred) 88,6\u00b112,9 (range:68%-108%), MEF25(%pred) 61,6\u00b130,4 (range:24,7%-106%), CN-Score 7,5\u00b14,8 points. There weren't any significant changes in the airway microbiology under immunosuppressive therapy (steroid, Ciclosporin\u00b1Basiliximab), the serum IgG levels declined significant from 17,4\u00b13,9g/l to 9,8\u00b12,3/l(p<0.05). The growth over the year was 6,9\u00b15 cm and the increase of weight come to 5,1\u00b16,1kg, while the BMI didn't increase in this first year after transplantation. Certainly we found an increase of the body fat mass (to 18,2\u00b13,8% of body weight), of the upper arm circumference (to 20\u00b14,2cm) und of the triceps skin fat fold (to 11,4\u00b1 8,1cm) .Conclusion:Liver transplantation is an effective therapy even in children with CF related liver disease and stabilise pulmonary function and improves nutritional status in patients with CF and mild or moderate pulmonary involvement before LTX. (Neglia JP et al., N Engl J Med 1995; 332:494-499) , and colon cancer has been described in young adults with CF (Chaun H et al., Can J Gastroenterol 1996; 10:440-442) . Three of 62 lung transplant (LTX) recipients from our center developed colon cancer after successful bilateral lung transplant for end-stage lung disease. Data from these 3 individuals are given in Table below .",

To prioritize patients with a poor prognosis and to reduce waiting list mortality the High Urgency (HU) status was introduced in 2001. To be considered for HU status there has to be a limited life expectancy on clinical judgement and all three transplantation centers have to audit this decision.

This information is more reliable for compliance than study participation in days alone. For future studies it is recommended to define in the protocol not only a minimum of study participation in days but also a minimum in TDC and DSC. In addition the compliance thresholds may be defined with regard to the drug's pharmacokinetic profile. In general, the inhalation record of the AKITA smart card provides an unbiased view of the inhalations treatments during a study especially when the subjects perform the inhalations at home. Compliance calculations as shown above may be performed and linked to other outcomes of a study for validation. Compliance data like these may also be used routinely by the treating physician in order to guide and supervise his patients. Introduction: Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (the I-neb \u00ae AAD \u00ae System) has been developed to deliver precise, reproducible doses of aerosol into inhalation. I-neb utilizes a medication chamber, which incorporates a metering chamber to deliver a preset (metered) dose of aerosol. Inhalation of hypertonic (7%) saline has been shown to aid mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. [1] We performed an in vitro test to determine the emitted, delivered and residual doses of hypertonic saline from the I-neb AAD System with 0.5 mL metering chamber, and a conventional jet nebulizer (LC Plus \u00ae ) with a 4 mL fill. The results were then entered into a model to predict the likely lung dose from the in vitro tests, in order to determine the equivalent I-neb dose to the 4 mL conventional jet nebulizer fill.",

As I-neb has a delivered dose of 513 mg, and I-neb has been shown to deposit 62.8% of the dose in the lung, [2] this would result in a lung dose of 322 mg. The Pari LC Plus has a higher delivered dose, but the overall lung deposition is only 47% of the fill volume, i.e. 613 mg.

The tonicity of colistimethate sodium inhalation solution has been linked to the occurrence of bronchospasm in some patients. It has been suggested that this bronchospasm can be avoided by using an isotonic solution of colistimethate sodium. [1] This can be complicated when using conventional jet nebulizers, since evaporation during nebulization tends to change the tonicity of the solution remaining in the nebulizer. However, because very little evaporation occurs within the I-neb medication chamber during nebulization, the tonicity of the loaded solution at the beginning and end of nebulization remains almost constant.",

Activaero, GmbH, Gauting, Germany Arikace\u2122 is an inhalation formulation of a liposomal amikacin suspension that is designed to treat chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Liposome encapsulation of amikacin reduces nonspecific binding of this cationic aminoglycoside drug to the negatively charged mucus and biofilm surfaces and allows penetration and delivery of packets of highly concentrated drug to the otherwise protected bacteria. As nebulized and delivered to the lungs, Arikace\u2122 comprises 65% liposomal amikacin and 35% 'free' amikacin that is not entrapped by liposomes; free drug is produced by liposome leakage during nebulization. This profile provides an initial high peak concentration of amikacin followed by a sustained level as drug leaks from the liposomes. Nebulized Arikace\u2122 with this profile was evaluated previously in human clinical studies using the LC STAR\u00ae nebulizer. Although the 0.3 \u00b5m liposomes of Arikace\u2122 are efficiently loaded with drug, the expected effective dose in humans will require relatively large volumes of drug solution to be administered. To minimize treatment time and improve patient convenience we sought to find a nebulizer that would efficiently deposit drug and produce aerosol at a high output rate, while still producing the same level of free drug during nebulization.",

CEMALB, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Many inhaled, therapeutic drugs have their site of action in the conducting airways, but may deposit elsewhere in the respiratory tract, resulting in unwanted side effects and waste. The quantity and location of particle deposition in the respiratory tract depends on both the particles' aerodynamic size and breathing pattern. In 8 subjects with normal lung function, we evaluated three methodologies for their ability to deliver radiolabeled particles (99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid) to the conducting airways: 1. Inhalation of 5 \u00b5m MMAD particles (DeVilbiss 646 jet nebulizer) using a resting tidal volume and flow (mean 0.43 L and 0.39 Lps); 2. Inhalation from the same nebulizer using a very large inspiratory capacity volume and higher flow rate (mean 2.6 L and 0.52 Lps); and 3. Inhalation of larger 9.5 \u00b5m MMAD (HEART jet nebulizer) particles with a large tidal volume and very low flow rate (mean 0.89 L and 0.08 Lps). Gamma scintigraphy gave an estimate of % conducting airway deposition (%CAD) by multiplying the percent of activity in the lungs immediately post-deposition relative to the total deposition (i.e. lung+mouth +esophagus+stomach) times the percent of activity cleared from the lungs over 24 hours. %CAD was 17%, 14%, and 31% for the three methods, respectively, significantly greater for the large particle, very slow inhalation technique when compared to the other two methods. The amount deposited in the mouth and larynx was 52%, 34 and 33%.",

Positive effects of physical conditioning in cystic fibrosis (CF) have been reported for quality of life (QoL) in addition to effectis on fitness and lung functions. The objective of this study was to identify the effects of different modes of training on QoL in CF. 58 CF-patients (age 12-40 yr., FEV1 >35%pred.) were randomized into 5 groups: Germany: unsupervised homebased training, 3 hours per week, free choice of training mode and means (UT, n=18) and controls (CON1, n=10); Switzerland: aerobic training (AT, n=11) or weight training (WT, n=11) in a fitness center, 3 x 30 min per week, or controls (CON2, n=8). Subjects in the training groups were asked to train for 6 months. At study entry and after 3 and 6 months, QoL was assessed by questionnaire and maximal physical working capacity (PWC, %pred) was determined during cycle ergometry (Godfrey protocol). Changes from baseline values were calculated and ANOVA for repeated measures was used to test for differences among groups. Weight training resulted in a significant decrease in QoL (generic dimension) at 3 and 6 months compared with all other training modes including controls. There was no significant difference between AT or UT and controls in QoL during the program. However, there was a positive association between the change in PWC and the change in QoL (r=0.32, p<0.05) in the entire sample. In conclusion, physical training may not always result in an increase in QL in CF. Possibly, the decrease in QoL in the WT group may have resulted from tiredness induced by the training. Thus, a different outcome might have been found with less intense training. Positive effects may be achieved by improving aerobic fitness.",

Classification of motor performance of the tested children was normal (MQ =3.1\u00b10.8). This could be the reason that only some aspects of motor performance increased. Parents of the children were asked about habitual physical activity at home. All children were physically active and some of the children participated in organized sports. A recent study showed that with an increase in age lower motor performance in children and adolescent with CF was seen compared to healthy children.

The \"Motorik Test\" (MOT) was used to assess motor performance. The MOT consisted of 18 test-items which evaluated seven different components of motor performance (balance, agility and flexibility, strength, coordination, fine motor skills, reactivity, accuracy of movement). Lung function in patients with CF was measured by spirometric techniques Results: Results of the MOT showed no difference either for single testitems or for parameter \"Motorische Quotient (MQ)\" (p>0.05). This parameter classified motor performance of all aspects tested with the MOT. Classification of children with CF and of healthy children was normal. Mean value for parameter MQ (CF: 3.1\u00b10.8 vs. healthy 3.29\u00b10.7) was slight higher in patients with CF than in healthy children (p>0.05). Differences between healthy and CF for different components of motor performance were not significant (p<0.05) Discussion: The MOT is a reliable and valid test method in Germany to determine motor performance in younger children. To our knowledge this was the first study to examine motor performance in preschool-children with CF. Furthermore, we compared patients with CF and healthy children. We observed no differences between groups for motor performance. In older children with CF, lower motor performance has previously been found compared to healthy children of the same age. We do not have any information about the level of habitual activity in tested healthy children. We therefore speculate that time spent in physical activity in CF is similar to that of healthy children at this age. A recent study showed a decline in physical activity in CF when age and problems during physical activity increased. We think that motor performance is normal in children with CF up to an age of 6 yrs. When age increased, time spent in physical activity decreases (treatment, school) and therefore motor performance decreases.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Six year follow-up of this patient cohort has shown that higher activity levels are clearly associated with a slower rate of decline of FEV1. We are currently evaluating whether strategies aimed at increasing physical activity will have an impact on lung function decline in CF patients. Background: Knowledge of exercise principles, benefits, and techniques has not been assessed in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) or their parents. Regular exercise is a recommended CF treatment regimen that is often not followed, but one which might improve cardiovascular fitness, lung function, sputum clearance, and health-related quality of life. Further, aerobic fitness, measured as peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 ), is positively related to survival in CF. Construction of a reliable and valid measure of exercise knowledge is necessary to assess level of knowledge and study its relationship to exercise behavior. The aim of this study was to develop and test a measure of exercise knowledge for pediatric patients with CF and their parents. Methods: We constructed a 22-item exercise knowledge test (EKT) and then examined its psychometric properties. A comprehensive review of the exercise literature guided the formulation of objectives and development of items. To establish content validity, a panel of experts (CF physician, two exercise physiologists, and a clinical CF nurse) evaluated the objectives and test items for relevance, clarity, and accuracy. After feedback from the panel, we revised the EKT through an iterative process. In consultation with a reading level expert, we wrote the EKT items so that the test could be administered to children and adults. A measurement and evaluation expert also reviewed the test, and additional revisions were made. During routine clinic visits, the EKT was administered to 50 subjects with CF and 50 parents. The CF subjects included 31 boys and 19 girls, age 8 to 18 years, FEV 1 range: 26-123 % predicted. The parents had an average age of 41 years and most (n=44) were female. Results: The EKT includes 22 items, 12 true-false and 10 multiple choice. It is self-administered, yields a single summed score, and has a Flesch-Kincaid 3rd grade reading level. The means were 17.96 + 2.7 (82% correct) and 20.24 + 1.4 (92% correct) for the CF subjects and parents, respectively; 74% of the parents scored between 20 and 22. Internal consistency reliability estimates were .64 for the children and .26 for the parents, reflecting both the multidimensionality of the material and the lack of variability in the parent scores. Item difficulty ranged from 0.50 to 0.98 for the CF subjects and from 0.64 to 1.00 for the parents. In both groups, the discrimination values were positive for all items with difficulty values less than 1.00. Conclusions: We were able to develop a measure of exercise knowledge with an acceptable reading level for children with CF and their parents. This sample of CF subjects and parents showed substantial exercise knowledge. The EKT can be a useful tool to identify gaps in exercise knowledge in CF patients and their parents, develop educational programs to increase knowledge, and examine how knowledge relates to exercise behavior in children with CF.",

Subjects were questioned about their current and past physical activity as well as the benefits and barriers to participation. The adolescents with CF were also asked about their perceptions of physical activity on their own health and other adolescents with CF. Interviews were transcribed and coded by three investigator groups. Analysis was conducted using the grounded theory approach at two points in the study, following each interview and again at the completion of all interviews. At the first point, individual interviews were coded using line-by-line coding, and similar information was grouped into categories. In the second interview, categories were confirmed and subjects were also asked to elaborate or clarify points from the first interview. Interviews were continued until themes reached a saturation point. Upon completion of all interviews, data for each group were organized by question. Data categories appearing throughout the interviews became major themes describing facilitators and barriers to exercise. The major themes were identified by the three researcher groups and then through collaborative group analysis.",

In the non-CF group, facilitators included social factors in addition to general health-related and psychological benefits.

It was rare for a child to be setting up and cleaning equipment regularly at 7-8years, but this continued throughout the adolescent years. Overall 35% were 'below' for P and IT; this was highest after the age of 11years. Autonomy with physiotherapy appeared slow to develop. Some categories in CFMTP were different from our practice for e.g. patients are not invited to be seen alone in our clinics until 13 years v 9-10 years and this may account for the lower scores in communication below this age. This study has highlighted that some of our patients are not fully independent in the time up to transfer. We need to encourage independence from an early age with all aspects of care and integrate the process into our routine clinical practice. Refs 1 McDonagh and Viner BMJ 2006; 332:435-6, 2.

LaTrobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Musculoskeletal pain is prevalent in cystic fibrosis (CF). While the chest and back are frequently reported regions of acute or chronic pain, it is unclear if pain in these areas is related to disease severity or respiratory symptoms. Manual therapy and postural advice has been shown to alleviate pain, but the effects of a combined approach of musculoskeletal physiotherapy and massage has not been studied. The aim of this study was to identify the primary regions of musculoskeletal pain, the relationship between pain severity and respiratory symptoms and to examine the effect of musculoskeletal physiotherapy techniques and soft tissue therapy, including remedial massage on pain and ease of breathing (EOB) in adults with CF. One hundred and twenty-nine adults with CF (70 with acute exacerbation, 24 post lung transplant) aged 31 \u00b1 9 years (mean \u00b1SD) with FEV(sub)1(/sub) of 51\u00b1 21% participated in this study. Following assessment of primary pain regions, each subject underwent a single treatment session including spinal joint / intercostal mobilisation and soft tissue therapy. Pain and EOB on a visual analogue scale were measured before and after treatment. Changes were compared using paired-samples t-tests. Pain was frequently reported in the thoracic spine region (38% of subjects), followed by the shoulder region (31%), cervical spine region (16%) and chest wall region (9%). Equivalent ratings of pain and EOB prior to treatment were reported for all regions of pain. EOB rating prior to treatment were worse in those with low BMI (r=-0.21, p=0.02) and low FEV(sub)1(/sub) (r=-0.24, p=0.01). A single treatment session was associated with reduction in pain (95%CI 1.6 to 2.1, p<0.001) and improvement in EOB (95%CI 0.4 to 0.7, p<0.001), irrespective of clinical status. Improvement in pain was equivalent for all primary pain regions. However, greater improvement in EOB was evident in subjects with shoulder pain compared to other regions (95%CI -1.1 to -0.02, p=0.04). A combination of musculoskeletal physiotherapy techniques and soft tissue therapy reduces musculoskeletal pain and improves EOB in adults with stable CF, during an acute exacerbation and post lung transplantation.",

            "text": "Service Cystic fibrosis is characterized by an excessive production of airway secretions responsible for bronchial obstruction and recurrent infections of the respiratory tract. The transport by ciliary activity and cough may be dependent on the unsteady rheological properties of the respiratory mucus such as thixotropy and shear-thinning properties which correspond to a decrease of viscosity with time or flow rate, respectively. We have previously shown that respiratory mucus with high shear-thinning and thixotropic properties is better transported by the cough mechanism (Zahm et al, Eur. Respir. J., 1991) . To promote mucus clearance and to finally expectorate the mucus by a cough manoeuvre, an innovative device, the Airhelp, has been developed and aimed to improve chest physiotherapy effectiveness. During a prolonged expiratory manoeuvre, the Airhelp delivers negative pressure variations (maximal amplitude: -4 kPa) at an oscillatory frequency of 13 Hz. The aim of the present work was to test the effect of the Airhelp device on the in vitro clearance of mucus by airflow. A plexiglass tube of 9 mm in diameter and 210 mm in length has been connected by one part on the Airhelp and by the other part on a 30 l thank mimicking the lung compliance. A 100 \u00b5l drop of mucus simulant at different concentrations (viscogum at 0.25% or 0.5% with actigum at 0.5% to 1.75%) or of respiratory mucus, was deposited within the plastic tube and the distance travelled by the sample under a 5sec-airflow was measured. Twelve respiratory mucus samples collected from CF patients were analyzed and the viscosity of the samples was measured before and after the Airhelp experiment. We observed a significant (p < 0.03) and negative relationship (r = -0.77) between the viscosity of mucus simulants and oscillatory airflow transport: the lower the viscosity, the higher the mucus transport by oscillatory airflow. Using CF respiratory mucus samples, we observed that without the oscillatory airflow, no transport occurred, whereas when the samples were submitted to the oscillatory airflow, a significant increase in mucus transportability was measured. In addition, the viscosity of the CF respiratory mucus samples was significantly decreased after oscillatory airflow treatment (485 \u00b1 148 Pa.s to 85 \u00b1 55 Pa.s, p <0.02). These results demonstrate that the mucus transport efficiency by an oscillatory airflow is dependent on mucus viscosity and that the improvement in mucus transport is related to the thixotropic and shear thinning properties of the airway mucus. We conclude that the Airhelp device may improve chest physiotherapy effectiveness.",

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) is currently using median income estimated by zip code from the 2000 US Census of the Population for SES risk adjustment of data reported publicly from the CFF Patient Registry. Median income estimated by zip code is an \"ecologic\" variable that may misclassify patient and family income. In order to more fully assess the impact of SES on CF health outcomes, the CFF began to ask Centers to collect data on household income directly from patients and families. These data were captured for 6.5% of patients and families in 2005 and 16.1% in 2006 in the national registry. We report a method of collecting SES data from children and adults implemented at the Children's Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University Cystic Fibrosis Center, and compare directly collected income to income based on zip code.",

Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA; 3. Genetics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA In the Genetic Modifier Study (GMS) of lung disease of cystic fibrosis (CF), patients, homozygous for the \u2206F508 mutation, were classified as having either severe or mild lung disease, as defined by the lowest or highest quartile of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and a linear model was fit from these patients' longitudinal data (Drumm 2005 , Schluchter 2006 . While these models successfully dichotomized patients for the association study, we assessed whether a single slope model could be improved. Here we have begun to compare models with one, two and three slopes, each representing different age ranges, for their use in this type of association study. As an example, interleukin-8 (IL-8), a neutrophil chemoattractant, associates with the severe lung inflammation seen in CF patients. We have observed the TT genotype of the IL-8 SNP rs4073, correlated with severe pulmonary function in the GMS sample of 808 patients, relative to the AA and AT genotypes of this SNP. In a replicate study of 268 patients, with CFTR genotypes associated with exocrine insuffiency, longitudinal linear mixed models were used to further characterize the decline in lung function over time as associated with the IL-8 SNP, rs4073. Three linear regression models of FEV1% predicted of patients were fit over age and compared with likelihood ratio tests. The three models differed with respect to the number of nodes. The first model had a single slope while the second and the third were piecewise linear models, with nodes at age 15, and ages 15 and 25, respectively. Age 15 was chosen as the first node, as by this age most CF patients have reached puberty, an event believed to coincide with changes in pulmonary function. The second node, age 25, was arbitrarily chosen as a point in the third decade, as survivor effect becomes a significant issue during this period. When compared to the single slope and two slope models, the three slope model with nodes at age 15 and age 25 better explained the pulmonary function of this study (p<0.001, -2LogLikelihood Chi-Squared tests). When the explanatory variable, IL-8 rs4073 genotype, was added, the single slope model and the three slope model were again compared. The three slope with nodes at age 15 and age 25 again resulted in a better fit of FEV1% predicted over age as correlated with rs4073 genotype (p<0.001, -2Loglikelihood Chi-Squared test). Estimates of FEV1% predicted at ages 6, 15, 25, and 30 for each rs4073 genotype (AA, AT/TA, or TT) were determined using the three slope model (p<0.001 for all estimates). Other explanatory variables, like gender and survival (p<0.001), were added to further elucidate the relation between IL-8 genotype and lung disease phenotype. We propose to use this piecewise three slope model with nodes at age 15 and age 25 to look at the pulmonary function of patients in the CF Foundation registry data to better explain the decline in FEV1% predicted over time seen in CF patients.

The Canadian CF Foundation Patient Data Registry (CPDR), contains detailed clinical information on all CF patients receiving care at one of 38 accredited CF centres across Canada. The Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), holds linked administrative databases containing information on all publicly reimbursed health care services delivered in Ontario. Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstracts Database (DAD), Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), and Homecare databases were used for this study. The CPDR was probabilistically linked (Automatch software) to the ICES administrative database using name, gender and date of birth. All individuals were then linked to the CIHI DAD, OHIP, and Homecare databases using unique numeric identifiers. With these databases, longitudinal records for each individual were created. CIHI-DAD, OHIP, and Homecare claims data were used to calculate the number of hospitalizations per year for pulmonary infections. Males and females were analyzed separately to elucidate any gender disparities. Other predictor variables include age, geographical location, number of clinic visits, socioeconomic status (income quintile) as well as clinical variables such as pulmonary function tests, nutritional status, diabetes mellitus, sputum bacteriology and pancreatic status.",

However, calculation of adjusted height percentile is not recommended due to the complexity of method involved in such calculation. Instead, a simple method to estimate a target height based on mid parental height was recommended. However, this target height includes a 10-cm confidence interval, which spans most of the channels on the growth chart. Therefore, a child's unadjusted height may be considerably below the target height, yet remains above the lower bound of the target height range. In addition, there is a paucity of data on the associations between adjusted height to lung disease outcomes to justify whether adjustment for genetic potential is necessary.",

Proportionately more children were classified as short stature based on Himes method compared to unadjusted height (31% vs. 26%, p = 0.0003). In contrast, proportionately fewer children were below the lower bound of CFF's target height (23%) compared to unadjusted height < 10th percentile (26%), p < 0.001. Among children with average parents, unadjusted and adjusted height percentiles were similar.

Among children with tall parents (> 75th percentile), the percentage of short stature increased from 7% with unadjusted height to 32% with Himes method and 35% with CFF's target height method. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, without incorporating genetic height potential, 2-5 times more CF children who have short parents would be classified as short stature, while 5 times fewer CF children who have tall parents would be classified as short stature. Further analyses show that, compared to unadjusted height percentile, Himes adjusted height percentile is more sensitive to, and has stronger association with, percent predicted FEV-1.",

The CFF's target height method and Himes method differ significantly in identifying short stature in CF children with short parents. Cohort study of individuals in the CFF Patient Registry from 1995-2005. All individuals 6 years of age or older and diagnosed before age 45 were included. The new, persistent MRSA infection cohort was defined by having at least two cultures negative for MRSA over a two-year lead-in period followed by at least two MRSA positive cultures. Individuals with only one MRSA culture (transient infection) were excluded. We developed multiple linear regression models using generalized estimating equations to assess the effect of MRSA on FEV 1 %predicted (%FEV 1 ) and rate of change of %FEV 1 . Results: During the study period 5,955 individuals cultured MRSA. Of these, 2,025(34%) cultured MRSA only once (transient infection) and were excluded from subsequent analysis. 3,116 individuals met the criteria for new and persistent MRSA infection. 16,088 met the criteria for never having MRSA resulting in a total study cohort of 19,204. Participants were followed for a median of 10 years. The median time to first isolation of MRSA in the persistent MRSA cohort was 5.5 years and the mean number of positive MRSA cultures per patient was 7.5. A comparison of baseline characteristics between the persistent MRSA and never MRSA cohorts revealed the MRSA cohort to be younger (13.1 vs 15.0 years p<0.001), equivalent in lung function (%FEV 1 79.1% vs 78.3% p=NS), and with higher likelihood of methicillin sensitive Staph aureus colonization (45% vs. 39.3% p<0.001). 5.5 years into the study period (the median time of acquisition for new MRSA), the MRSA cohort had a lower %FEV 1 (68.1% vs 71.1% p<0.001), and averaged twice as many hospital admissions per year (0.88 vs 0.44 p<0.001) and home IV courses per year (0.40 vs 0.21 p<0.001). In an unadjusted analysis, the presence of MRSA was associated with a mean %FEV 1 that was 9.8% lower than the MRSA cohort (95%CI 9.6%-10.0%). However, after adjusting for sex, age, pancreatic status, P. aeruginosa, and B. cenocepacia, the presence of MRSA was associated with a mean %FEV 1 3.3% lower (95%CI 3.1%-3.5%). Most importantly, an analysis investigating the interaction between MRSA and time, after adjusting for confounders, indicated no statistically nor clinically meaningful difference in the mean rate of lung function decline between the two groups. Conclusions: Approximately one-third of patients who culture MRSA do so only once and do not subsequently develop persistent MRSA infection.",

Papworth Hospital, Papworth Everard, United Kingdom; 3. Oxford Centre for Diabetes and Endocrinology, Oxford, United Kingdom Background and Aims: Although the prevalence of diabetes in patients with CF (CFRD) is high, few prospective studies exist, and even for genet-ic factors, cross-sectional studies may bias the magnitude of associations. This study sought to identify risk factors for CFRD from a predominantly white cohort of individuals with CF in the United Kingdom. Methods: 8,029 individuals aged 0 -64 were identified from the UK CF Database, a registry of patients coordinated by the UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust with data from over 44 specialists centres from England, Scotland and Wales, countries which provide medical care free of charge. Of the patients, 5,196 had no diabetes at baseline (1996-2004) , and also had at least one follow-up annual visit. Diabetes was defined as either a physician diagnosis of diabetes, a blood glucose of >11.1 mmol/l two hours following an oral glucose tolerance test, or treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs. Follow-up was calculated as time from baseline to the first detection of new diabetes or censoring. Risk factors included clinical, genetic (functional classes I,II,III vs IV,V), and anthropometric characteristics measured at baseline. Survival analyses were limited to patients with complete data. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the magnitude of the association between potential risk factors and incident diabetes. One-way interactions with sex were tested. Results: The median age of entry into the cohort was 12 years and BMI was 17.9 kg/m2. 54% were male, and 96% were white. 526 patients developed diabetes during 15,718 person-years of follow-up (mean 3.0 years); the incidence was 3.4% per year. Patients who developed diabetes were more likely in univariate analyses to be older, have a high body mass index (BMI), bacterial pulmonary infections, liver and pulmonary function abnormalities, poor oxygen saturation, a history of organ transplantation, supplemental feeds, and take pancreatic enzymes or bile acids. In addition, patients with Class IV,V genotypes were less likely to develop diabetes relative to patients with other genotypes, as were patients screened for CF at birth. Not associated with incident diabetes was age at diagnosis of CF and ethnicity. In multivariate analyses (n= 4,004) age (hazard ratio 1.02 per year, 95% CI 1.01 -1.03), female sex (1.67 (95% CI 1.39-2.00), % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (1.019, 1.014 -1.024 per 1% decrement), dose of pancreatic enzyme replacement (1.33, 1.10 -1.62), above vs below median dosage, use of bile acid supplements (1.51, 1.20 -1.91) , and genotype class I,II, III (5.60, 2.08 -15.1) relative to class IV/V. These associations were not confounded by BMI or history of transplantation. There were no significant interactions between sex and other risk factors. Conclusions: The study confirms the high incidence of CFRD, and shows that patients with class IV/V genotypes are less likely to develop diabetes independent of other CF-related complications. Females are disproportionately at risk for diabetes which is not explained by a higher prevalence of known risk factors nor by effect modification. Cystic fibrosis children are at increased risk for hearing disorders due aminoglycoside exposure, mucopurulent upper respiratory tract infections, and increased inflammatory responses. Pure tone audiometry is the standard instrument used to determine hearing loss. However, it can be expensive and time-consuming to use audiometry for routine hearing screening. Hearing questionnaires have been used as a screening tool to assess possible hearing loss in otherwise healthy populations. What are the results of hearing questionnaires administered to pediatric CF patients? Does CF patient age or ethnicity increase the likelihood of hearing loss as determined by a hearing questionnaire? A hearing questionnaire (English and Spanish versions) was administered to pediatric CF patients over a 2 week period at our accredited CF Center. Data collected included demographic information. Inclusion criteria: age \u043c10 years and in baseline health status. Possible hearing loss was defined as at least 3 \"Yes\" responses (>3) to the 14 quesions administered to the patients. Fisher's exact test was used to perform the analyses. A total of 20 CF patients were seen in the CF clinic during the study period. 14 CF patients completed the Hearing Questionnaire. Mean age was 14.3 \u00b1 3.6 years (median 13.6 years). There were 9 males and 5 females; 10 were classified as Hispanic and 4 were classified as Caucasian. 7 patients were older than 13.6 years (the median age) and 7 patients were less than 13.6 years. 3 patients who were older than age 13.6 years had a score of >3 and 4 patients < age 13.6 years had scores >3 (p=1.0, ns). Thus, 7 of 14 CF patients (50%) were classified as having possible hearing loss as per their questionnaire scores. 6 of 10 Hispanic CF patients had hearing scores >3 and 1 of 4 Caucasian patients had hearing score >3 (p=0.56, ns) . We found that a significant proportion (50%) of our CF children may require formal hearing evaluation. We speculate that hearing questionnaires may be useful to screen for hearing loss in the CF patient population. Hispanic CF patients have increased morbidity and mortality risks compared to Caucasian CF patients who attend our accredited Cystic Fibrosis Center in Southern California. Is the increased morbidity/mortality risk due to decreased access to outpatient CF care? We performed a retrospective review of all patient visits to our CF Clinic between January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006 . Data collected included demographic information (age, ethnicity, gender) , and the number of clinic visits during the study period. Data was analyzed by unpaired Student's t-test as well as by Chi-square. During the study period, a total of 197 CF patients (106 males:91 females; mean age 10.8 \u00b1 5.7 years; range 3 months to 21 years) were routinely followed in our CF Clinic. These patients had a total of 1806 outpatient visits to the CF Clinic (9.2 clinic visits/patient over the 2 year study period). There were 82 Hispanic CF patients (46 males:36 females; mean age 11.0 \u00b1 5.3 years) and 99 Caucasian CF patients (49 males:50 females; mean age 10.8 \u00b1 6.2 years; p=0.42, ns). There was no difference in gender distribution between the 2 group (p=0.52, ns). Hispanic patients had a greater number of CF clinic visits (11.2 visits/patient) as compared to Caucasian patients (7.9 vists/patient; p=0.03) during the same period. We conclude that the increased morbidity and mortality of Hispanic CF patients in California cannot be attributed to barriers to outpatient care. In fact, Hispanic CF patients were seen more frequently in CF Clinic compared to Caucasian CF patients who attend the same clinic. We speculate that Hispanic CF patients are seen more frequently in CF Clinic due to increased severity of CF disease manifestations.",

Dep. of genetics, Nantes, France Aim: The aim of this study was to describe 15-year experience of prenatal diagnosis (PD) for CF in Brittany (western France) and to assess its impact on incidence. Method: We registered, by the genetic laboratories of our region, all the PDs performed in women living in Brittany over the period 1991-2005. We described the number of PDs made for each reason (way by which the one-in-four risk was identified: previous affected child, family testing, echogenic bowel, etc). We reported the proportion of CF-affected fetuses and of consecutive terminations, and assessed the incidence modification due to PD. Results: Over the 15-year period, a total of 253 PDs were performed in couples living in Brittany. Most of them were done in couples already having CF child(ren) (n=167, 66.0%). Extended testing in families -a practice largely proposed in Brittany -led to the identification of 18 new onein-four risk couples among the relatives of CF patients who opted for PD 38 times over the study period (15.0%). The 48 other PDs were made in couples without previous history of CF. The one-in-four risk was mainly identified following the detection of an echogenic bowel during pregnancy ultrasound examination (21 PDs were done directly following the positive ultrasound (8.3%), whereas 19 others were done for subsequent pregnancies (7.5%)). The other PDs were consecutive to the detection of an heterozygote through newborn screening (n=6, 2.4%) or for an other reasons (n=2, 0.8%). Over the study period, the number of PDs per couple varied between one and five, the mean being 1.6. Overall, a total of 88 CF fetuses were identified, among whom 77 were terminated (87.5%). The inclusion in the incidence calculation of these 77 pregnancy terminations led that to an incidence modification of 28.8% over the study period. Conclusion: This study shows that PD for CF is commonly used in Brittany and highlights the impact of family testing and of routine ultrasound examination of pregnancies in that region.",

Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA; 6. University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA; 7. University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA Background: Although life expectancy in CF has dramatically improved over the last 20 years, most of the improvement is due to improved survival during early childhood. Adolescence and young adulthood continue to be a time of worsening pulmonary disease and mortality. Study Objective: Data from a large longitudinal observational study, the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF), was examined to characterize lung function decline in subjects with CF during the periods preceding and after the age of 18. Design: ESCF data from 2136 individuals with CF collected during the period of 1994-2005 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria required individuals to have a minimum of 5 encounters in each of the 3.5 year time periods before and after the age of 18. The cohort was strati-fied by disease severity based on the best FEV 1 at the 18th year (+/-6 months). One hundred thirty seven subjects had severe lung disease (FEV 1 <40% predicted), 668 had moderate-severe lung disease (FEV 1 40-<70 % predicted), 1049 had mild lung disease (FEV 1 70-<100% predicted), and 282 had very mild disease (FEV 1 >100% predicted) The study compared the annualized rate of FEV 1 decline during the adolescent period, defined as ages 14-17.5 years, and in the young adult period defined as 18.5-22 years. Results: In the entire cohort, the annualized rate of decline was less in the young adult period than in the adolescent period (p<0.001). The most dramatic improvement in slope of decline was seen in the severe group, and significant improvements were also noted in the moderate group (p<0.001). The mild group demonstrated insignificant change; the very mild group was the only group that demonstrated a more negative annualized rate of the decline in young adulthood than in adolescence (p=0.027). Conclusions: These data suggest that, overall, young adults have a slower rate of decline in FEV 1 in the period after age 18. This \"stabilizing\" of lung function is most prominent in those individuals with moderate-to-severe lung disease. Only those with very mild lung disease have a slightly more rapid rate of decline between the ages of 18 and 22. Overall there is less variation in the rate of FEV 1 decline across disease strata after the 18th birthday. Further analysis is underway to better understand the factors leading to these findings. 1 1. Department of Paediatrics, University of Florence, Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Florence, Italy; 2. Italian Cystic Fibrosis Microbiology Group, Florence, Italy; 3. Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, T\u00fcbingen, Germany MRSA is now a worldwide public health problem, due to the increasing rate of infection in several settings as well as in CF patients. MRSA was first recognized as being acquired from hospitalized patients (HA-MRSA), but the onset of MRSA infection outside the hospital setting, in communityassociated strains (CA-MRSA), has recently been described with increasing frequency. HA-MRSA are known to be responsible for infections in hospitalized patients, although highly virulent CA-MRSA are increasingly reported worldwide as the cause of severe outbreaks, replacing HA-MRSA strains in nosocomial infections. Little evidence is available about the characterization (SCCmec type) and epidemiology of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) or hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA), transmissibility, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence in the CF population.",

The SCCmec type in order to identify hospital-and community-acquired MRSA strains (HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA respectively) was determined with molecular methods, and the presence of gene encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was tested. During the study period, 181 MRSA strains were isolated from 178 out of 2362 (7.5%) patients attending these CF centers. Of the SCCmec type representing HA-MRSA, our data showed an high prevalence of SCCmec I (49.4%) while the prevalence of SCCmec II, (reported as the most represented among HA-MRSA) was only 1.1%. Furthermore a high prevalence (31.4%) was found of SCCmec IV (suggestive of CA-MRSA strains).",

Oral azithromycin was recommended for CF patients ages six and older, with chronic Pseudomonas, and a weight of 25 kilograms or more. The CF database was screened to determine each patient's medication eligibilities. Eligibilities were reviewed weekly at our CF chart conference. Medication specific family and patient handouts were developed, reviewed by the parent advocate, and given to eligible families and patients on arrival to clinic. Data was collected to document the number of discussions facilitated at clinic visits, the decisions regarding medications, and the number of new treatment prescriptions that were facilitated.

We discovered a lack of a standardized process to follow-up (FU) patients who \"did not keep appointments\" (DNKA). A spreadsheet was created to monitor physician DNKA rates. A primary FU strategy was devised to identify patients who DNKA through daily auto-emails to the CF office assistant and utilization of a rescheduling decision tree for reappointment of these patients by our appointment center. Two secondary FU strategies were developed. The first involves the Clinical Coordinator printing a monthly report off Port CF entitled \"Patients Due a Visit\" then emailing this list to the CF team to contact and reappoint. The second involves the CF Social Worker tracking patients seen per quarter on a spreadsheet and emailing the spreadsheet quarterly to the CF team as well as posting on our datawall.

However, some of the early improvement in clinic attendance was partially due to an increased awareness of our QI efforts by our clinic staff, CF team and patients/families. We speculate that improvements in nutritional status and lung function are at least partially related to more frequent clinic attendance by our patients. Continued monitoring of the number of DNKA patients and patients who attend clinic quarterly is required to sustain these gains in improved patient outcomes. Data When we first measured patient/family satisfaction in 2003, 31 parents and 14 children were given questionnaires to measure their satisfaction with services provided at the clinic. At that time, responses in our survey were very positive. With regards to our new model we received very positive feedback, encouraging us to continue with the model.

            "text": "Results will be compiled early this summer and would be ready for the poster and/or presentation in the fall. The CFF clinical care guidelines recommend routine clinic visits for assessments, interventions, monitoring, education and counseling every 3 months or more often as indicated. Adherence to these guidelines is important in ensuring better clinical outcomes. In reviewing our CF Center data from the 2003 CFF Registry Report, 46.2% of pediatric patients (6-18 yrs.) and 47.8% of adults (18 yrs. and older) adhered to the guidelines. National goals were not provided then; instead data was given for the top ten CF Centers (80.9% and 78.5% for pediatric and adult patients respectively) as well as the national rates (55.5% and 44.8% for pediatric and adult patients respectively). Our CF Care Center acknowledged the need to improve adherence to these guidelines and at the beginning of the year 2005, embarked on a quality improvement project to address this issue. Following the PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) steps, we agreed on the objective of increasing the percentage of pediatric and adult patients adhering to the guidelines by at least 50% and at the same time, to exceed the national average in 1 year or by the end of the year 2005. The physicians and social worker obtained feedback from patients and/or families during a clinic visit regarding barriers in complying with scheduled clinic visits. Suggestions were elicited to overcome these barriers. The team members then identified barriers in meeting the guidelines and implemented measures to improve compliance with clinical care guidelines. Among these measures were sharing the information about clinical care guidelines and importance of adherence through our CF Newsletter and at every clinic visit, reminder calls to patients or caregivers at least 2 days prior to the visit, appointments for the next visit given prior to discharge from the clinic, and same day calls to patients who failed to keep their appointment for rescheduling. Our Social Worker identified patients with difficulties or problems in consistently keeping appointments and helped address these problems. Progress made in this endeavor was shared with parents and caregivers during the \"Parents' Night\" held in the fall of 2006. Indeed, with consistent implementation of these measures, we have seen improvement in the percentage of patients adhering to guidelines. In our 2005 CF Care Center data, 68.2% of pediatric patients and 89.5% of adult patients adhered to recommended clinical care guidelines, approximating and in fact for the adults, exceeding, our target of 50% increase in the percentage (48% and 87% increase respectively for pediatric and adult patients). These data were better than the national average for 2005 (63.9% and 48.3% for pediatric and adult patients respectively) but for pediatric patients, still 22% below the national goal of 90%. Adults approximated the national goal of 90%. We are committed to continually engage in the process of quality improvement in further improving adherence to clinical care guidelines and to hold on to the gains. Weight z-scores and height z-scores were monitored prospectively for all infants, children, and adolescents at a pediatric outpatient CF clinic during an ongoing, multidisciplinary quality improvement (QI) initiative. All CF team members participated in this QI project which emphasized the importance of good nutrition and adequate growth for optimal lung health. Specific strategies for improvement included education to families at each visit with a written Nutrition Action Plan, increased emphasis on liquid supplements and enteral feeds as needed, and a consist message from all CF clinic staff in encouraging attention to nutrition. The study objective was to determine if multidisciplinary QI interventions to improve nutritional status had any effect on weight z-scores and/or height z-scores over a 3-year period. The null hypothesis was that z-scores for weight and height would either not improve or worsen. Inclusion criterion for this study was attendance at CF oupatient clinic during the first 5 months of the QI initiative (time 1) with a subsequent clinic visit 3 years later (time 2). Patients not attending clinic at both time 1 and time 2 were excluded. A cohort of 119 patients (53 male, 66 female) met the inclusion criterion. The mean time 1 to time 2 interval was 3.05 \u00b1 .11 years (range 2.70 to 3.40 years) with mean patient age at time 1 of 6.75 \u00b1 4.55 years (range .10 to 15.80 years). Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was used for 112 (94.1%) of the cohort. Paired sample t-tests indicated significant improvements for weight z-score (p <.000, t (118) = 6.16) and height z-score (p <.000, t (118) = 4.49) after the 3-year intervention. At time 1, 89 children (74.9%) were underweight or less than 50th percentile while 30 children (25.2%) were normal-weight, at or more than 50th percentile for age. Mean differences in both weight and height z-scores in the initially underweight patients were greater than those for the normal-weight patients over the 3 year interval. No significant differences were found for the initially normal weight-for-age children between time 1 and time 2 for weight z-score ( p = .83) or height z-score (p =.37). Children who were not underweight at time 1 grew normally, without acceleration over the 3 yr intervention. Therefore, we conclude that a longterm multidisciplinary QI project to enhance nutritional status resulted in significantly improved weight z-scores and height z-scores for those individuals who were initially underweight for age. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is pulmonary exacerbations. These exacerbations lead to hospital admissions and treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. All CF patients at our facility are admitted to a teaching service which includes house officers and students. Standardized order forms are used to improve accuracy and timeliness of medications and therapies. The efficiency of this process was brought into question in 08/2006, when several parents complained about a delay in the receipt of first dose IV antibiotics after hospital admission. The objectives of this study were to determine what were the actual delivery times of the IV antibiotics to the patients (both retrospectively and prospectively), and areas where improvements could be made. Our predetermined target time was < 3 hours.",

            "text": "This project was initiated in response to parental concerns. From the results of the retrospective and prospective analyses, it was determined that a delay is occurring in the receipt of IV antibiotics, which translates to hours in the hospital without therapy. This is both inconvenient and uncomfortable to the family, and wasteful of medical resources. The findings of this project were presented to the Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee of the hospital, to the nursing directors, and to the parents of cystic fibrosis patients. The delay is greater than expected before this project was initiated. As a result of these findings a \"fast track\" medication order set was developed to expedite initiation of inpatient therapy. Four key areas included in this order set are sputum, IV access, diet, and IV antibiotics. We speculate that time to first drug delivery will decrease and patient satisfaction with improve. The pediatric Intermountain Cystic Fibrosis Center (IMCFC) provides multidisciplinary Cystic Fibrosis (CF) care to 220 pediatric patients from Utah and parts of Idaho, Wyoming, and Nevada. Historically the IMCFC has embraced early intervention. As new therapies have been added to the CF armamentarium it has become necessary to have a method of keeping track of which patients are candidates for various therapies and also which medications have been prescribed, utilized or even should be discontinued. In order to address this quality issue, the IMCFC decided to develop and implement the use of a Medication Tracker (MT). The IMCFC decided to focus on key therapies which were felt to be at risk for variability in prescriptive practice. The five therapies included were: Pulmozyme<\u00ae>, TOBI<\u2122>, Hypertonic Saline(HS), Azithromycin and asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists). Ibuprofen was intially included and later removed from the MT.",

Of the sample, 4 individuals have completely normal vestibular test results, and 2 of the 4 had no prior aminoglycoside exposure. Of the remaining patients, 10 have bilateral vestibular loss ranging from mild to severe, two have evidence of a unilateral vestibular loss, and each of the others has non-lateralizing evidence of vestibular involvement. We have also documented change in the three individuals we have seen for repeat testing. Specifically, repeat testing has shown incremental decline in vestibular function with repeated exposure to aminoglycosides. Interestingly, only 6 individuals in the group have documented hearing loss, and although most report that they do not and have never had any problems with dizziness or balance, many patients have evidence of oscillopsia or abnormal postural control test results. It is clear from our limited data that it is important to monitor vestibular system function whenever potentially toxic agents are used. While monitoring hearing is also warranted, our data suggest that a monitoring program that includes only hearing is insufficient. Background: The correlation between BMI, lung function, and longterm outcomes in cystic fibrosis patients has been well documented. Based on this data the CF Foundation (CFF) has established adult patient care guidelines for BMI of 22 or greater for women and 23 or greater for men. In our CF center implementation of nutrition therapies in CF adult patients has been difficult due to lack of acceptance of proposed interventions. Due to the importance of optimal nutrition to attain the CFF recommendation for BMI, University of Cincinnati Adult CF Center implemented a weight management quality improvement protocol to improve the nutritional status of patients below the CFF recommended BMI. Our aim is to improve to the nutritional outcomes in our center through patients' acceptance of our nutrition interventions.",

Each category required a specific action to address weight loss or inability to gain weight. Areas of focus for the action plan include; intake assessment through computerized dietary analysis, assessment of pancreatic function, Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) regimen assessment, 72 hour stool collection for malabsorption, assessment of glycemic control, assessment for GERD, and enteral/parental feeding. The dietitian completed a chart review and nutrition assessment with the patients and classified them into one of the three nutritional risk categories. Eleven patients with a BMI below 19 were initially identified. Nine (82%) of the eleven patients with a BMI of 19 or less have been approached with the protocol and algorithm. Patients completed a three day food journal and oral intake was assessed via computerized dietary analysis. Oral enteral supplements were recommended 2-3 times per day.

This systematic approach to weight management, which includes patient involvement and specific education, has improved the overall acceptance of nutrition interventions in our adult population. The inpatient care of adults with cystic fibrosis can be a challenging given complicated medical regimens, specialized respiratory care orders, and unique dietary requirements. A large proportion of these patients are admitted to academic centers with rotating house staff that may have never treated an adult with cystic fibrosis. To improve the quality of care of our adult patients we have implemented a standardized electronic order set, a recurring educational program, and a \"pocket card\" to help the house staff. The adult cystic fibrosis program at Vanderbilt cares for over 160 patients, with 7-12 inpatient admissions per month. Vanderbilt's inpatient order system is completely electronic. We have devised an order set based on our agreed standard of care for inpatients with pneumonia. The order set guides the house staff through most aspects of inpatient care including culturing, antibiotic choice and dosing, dietary consultation, nutritional recommendations, and respiratory care orders. This order set not only educates the house staff on our standard of care but also provides direct access to each order they may wish to enter. We have reiterated this educational process with a pocket sized handout that guides them through the typical issues in adults with CF as well as provide phone numbers to members of the CF team. These resources are presented in short talk given at the beginning of each month to incoming house staff. A preliminary data analysis suggests that over 90% of all adults with CF are admitted using some component of this order set. An informal survey of the house staff also concludes that the pocket card and lectures have been helpful. All three aspects of this quality improvement have been implemented since December of 2006. We plan to formally test the impact of this intervention when a meaningful number of house staff have been through the service.",

            "text": "* Background: Malnutrition is a common complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). The median BMI percentile in CF patients between the ages of 2 and 20 years is 44.8% but ranges between various centers from 23.6 to 65.9 percent.1 Previous research has shown a trend toward improvement of pulmonary disease and a significant improvement in weight, height, and BMI z-scores after nutritional supplementation via a gastrostomy tube2; furthermore, FEV1 is positively correlated with BMI percentile.1 Higher weight at three years of age predicts better pulmonary function at six years of age.3 The effect of gastrostomy tube feedings on pulmonary exacerbation frequency has not been well defined. Hypothesis: The incidence of pulmonary exacerbations in children will decrease after the initiation of supplemental gastrostomy feedings. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients seen at the CMH CF Center, and who received gastrostomy tubes between 1997 and 2007 was performed. Data was evaluated in six month time intervals for two years prior and two years after gastrostomy tube placement. We assessed weight, height and BMI percentiles, FEV1 percent predicted, number of courses of exacerbation therapy (intravenous and oral) and microbiologic data. Results: We identified 20 patients, 14 females and 6 males, with ages ranging from 11 months to 14 years of age (6.82 years mean) at time of gastrostomy tube insertion. All patients had increases in their weight-forage percentile (mean of all patients of 13.83 percentile pre to 31.23 percentile post, p<0.05), height-for-age percentile (16.78 percentile pre to 27.03 percentile post, p<0.05), and BMI percentiles (24.23 percentile pre to 45.98 percentile post, p<0.05). The mean FEV1 percent predicted declined overall from 85.5% to 78.1% (2.2 percent predicted per year) over four years in 10 patients. There was a trend of exacerbation reduction after gastrostomy tube placement from 153 to 121 total courses (p=0.06). This decline in exacerbations after gastrostomy tube placement was most dramatic in those patients growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa without other organisms, with a decline from 90 total courses to 60 total courses in 10 patients (p=0.05). Discussion: Weight, height and BMI percentile improved after initiation of gastrostomy tube feedings. Lung function (FEV1 % predicted) decreased at the rate predicted in spite of gastrostomy feedings. There is a trend toward decrease in exacerbation frequency after improved nutrition with gastrostomy tube feedings, especially in patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Limitations of this study include the small sample size, relatively short follow-up time, and the retrospective nature of the study which did not allow assessment of adherence. Conclusion: Improved nutrition through gastrostomy tube placement may decrease the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. Evidence of an association of improved pulmonary function with improved nutritional status has motivated aggressive nutritional intervention. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies (PEGs) are employed increasingly in Cystic Fibrosis to optimize nutritional status. We reviewed our center data over the past 15 years to assess changes in our PEG practice and effects on nutritional and pulmonary outcomes. We hypothesized that our change in practice to earlier PEG intervention improved patient's nutritional and pulmonary outcomes.",

Placement in younger patients with better pre-PEG nutritional and pulmonary status allowed more complete nutritional recovery. We speculate that improved height z-scores with apparently stable FEV1 is consistent with increased pulmonary growth. Demonstration of an attenuated rate of PFT decline to correlate with this earlier intervention will require a larger population and longer observation period.

Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; 2. Biochemistery, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands BACKGROUND: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment is frequently applied for cystic fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD). It has been hypothesized that UDCA is beneficial through its choleretic activity, i.e. its capacity to induce bile flow. The hepatic expression of the CFTR protein is restricted to the cholangiocytes lining the bile ducts. Cholangiocytic CFTR is involved in the generation of ductular bile flow. It is not known to what extent the choleretic activity of bile salt treatment depends on expression of competent CFTR protein, and whether or not UDCA differs in this respect from other bile salts. We evaluated the role of CFTR in the acute and chronic choleretic effect of bile salt treatment, through comparative studies in Cftr-null, homozygous F508del, and corresponding wild type control (WT) mice.",

The independence of functional CFTR is UDCA specific, since the choleretic activity of chronic CA treatment is diminished in Cftr-null and homozygous F508del mice. We speculate that this specific, Cftr-independent choleretic effect of chronic UDCA treatment could be therapeutically important for cystic fibrosis. Most cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have mild to moderate focal portal tract changes (ductal obstruction and cholangitis) and hepatosteatosis. Etiology of severe liver disease (LD)with cirrhosis and portal hypertension which occurs in 5-7% of CF patients is unknown. The C57Bl/6J congenic CF mice develop progressive CF-like LD. As a useful therapeutic model, we have shown that dietary addition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) significantly ameliorates inflammation but has little effect on ductal obstruction (Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 292: G839-G848, 2007) .

The increase in Pla2g5 and decrease in Cyp expression levels are expected to make more arachidonic acid available for eicosanoids except HETEs. Decreases in degradative genes (Hpgd, Ltb4dh) will prolong availability of prostaglandins. Altered levels of eicosanoids are expected to play important roles in the pathophysiology of the CF intestine. Elevated PGE 2 may contribute to increased mucus secretion which is characteristic of CF. PGF 2\u03b1 and PGE 2 regulate intestinal motility and small intestinal transit is slower in CF patients and in CF mice. The HETEs are mostly known for their effects on vascular tone and electrolyte transport in the kidney but are less-well characterized in the intestine. Their dramatic decrease in the CF intestine may affect blood flow, electrolyte transport, intestinal motility, or other GI functions.

Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in other chronic diseases, but little is known about anemia in CF. Recognition and correction of anemia in CF might lead to better outcomes. Chronic inflammation, iron deficiency and malabsorption may be important mechanisms contributing to the anemia in CF patients. We hypothesized that anemia might be correlated with poor lung function. METHODS: Clinical charts and portCF.org visit logs of 218 patients of all ages (1 m to 61 yrs) with CF were reviewed for as many years as charts permitted (range 1-7 yrs). The following data were extracted: CBC, iron studies, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), vitamins A, D, and E levels, creatinine, pertinent medical history, and current medications. Anemia was defined by age-and gender-specific World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Patients were considered anemic if low hemoglobin(Hb) was present on two separate occasions at least two months apart, or average annual Hb met WHO criteria. PFTs in 176 patients (all >6 yrs) included forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) as percent predicted of normal and were considered a reflection of patient performance. The most representative annual PFT from at least 4 annual tests was chosen for analysis since acute infection adversely influences daily performance. RESULTS: 61 of 218 patients were anemic (prevalence 28%). Prevalence of anemia increased with age from 11.5% in patients < age 18 to 58% in patients > age 40 and was significantly higher in patients with vitamin deficiencies. 90% vitamin-deficient patients vs. 59.5% non-vitamin deficient patients were anemic (p=0.02). Mean Hb was 10.1 mg/dl (range 6.6-12.9). Roughly two thirds of patients had moderate and severe anemia (Hb <11 mg/dl) with no gender difference in regard to prevalence or severity identified. Complete iron studies were available in 16/48 patients. 7 were identified as iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 4 as anemia of chronic illness(ACI), and 3 as combined; 2 others had renal failure. In 32 patients, iron studies were incomplete, but renal failure, hemoptysis, hematochezia and solid organ transplants were contributing factors in half. PFTs obtained in 176 patients \u2265 6 yrs were compared in anemic and non-anemic patients. Mean FEV1 and FVC at all ages were statistically significantly poorer in the anemic patients (p <0.005). Complete iron studies were also available in 9 non-anemic patients with impaired lung function. 8/9 patients had ferritins <35 ng/ml suggesting relative iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anemia in CF patients is high and increases with age. In patients for whom iron studies were available, IDA was the prominent underlying mechanism, followed by ACI or a combination of both. In addition, a group of non-anemic patients with poor lung function had relative iron deficiency. The strikingly significant association between anemia and poor pulmonary function as well as the higher prevalence of anemia in vitamin deficient patients uncover anemia as significant co-morbidity in CF. Identification of iron deficiency in anemic as well as in non-anemic patients with poor lung function could be important since iron supplementation might allow Hb levels to increase as an appropriate response to hypoxia. Oral administration of DHA to a CF mouse model corrected the lipid imbalance and reversed certain pathological manifestations in tissues affected by CF. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of LA through the n-6 pathway, and to determine the effect of DHA supplementation on LA metabolism in cultured cells with a CF phenotype.",

When supplemental DHA was added in combination with LA, DHA inhibited the LA-derived increase in AA levels in CF cells and normalized them to the WT values. The formation of [ 14 C] LA metabolites was inhibited after 24-hour supplementation with DHA. This inhibitory effect of DHA was greatest on AA production, and it was more prominent in CF than in WT cells (WT: 3.7 fold, CF: 12.4 fold decrease in AA production).",

The fact that DHA supplementation decreased the flux from LA to fatty acid metabolites in the n-6 pathway, especially to AA, may partially explain DHA's mechanism of therapeutic benefit. These data would also suggest that DHA combined with LA in the diet may normalize fatty acid metabolism in CF patients. Background: Decreased levels of linoleic acid (LA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been found in the blood and tissues of CF patients. Studies on cultured CF cells and cftr-/-mice have indicated that decreased LA levels in CF might be related to its increased metabolism through the n-6 pathway. Other potential mechanisms of the observed decreased LA and DHA levels in CF could be related to altered cellular uptake of these two essential fatty acids. The goal of this study was to investigate the uptake of LA and DHA into cultured CF cells, and their distribution among the major lipid classes.",

Malnutrition and fatty acid deficiency has been a hallmark of CF and its impact in long-term lung health has been established. Data obtained by us using Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 arrays from ileum and liver of pristine 8-week-old male mice bearing the Y122X CF mutation and their normal littermates, indicates that there is a profound disturbance in genes associated with lipid metabolism, many of which are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3), a ligand-regulated transcription factor that regulates lipid metabolism and possess anti-inflammatory properties.

Changes in PPAR\u03b3 protein were also seen in ileum and especially liver, between WT and CF, at basal and upon treatment, but changes were subtle and will require more sensitive methods to further examine them. We also examined mRNA and protein levels for several genes involved in fat processing that could be related directly or indirectly to PPAR\u03b3. mRNA and protein levels for AQP1 and cubilin, and protein levels for megalin, ApoA-1, and ApoB-48 were reduced in the ileum of CF mice compared to WT.",

Understanding the association between PPAR\u03b3, CFTR, and fat processing may help us to develop new therapies directed towards improving the nutritional status of CF patients that, in the long run, will influence their lung health. CF is characterized by low linoleic acid (LA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels. Although this could be due to a primary abnormality in fatty acid biosynthesis, this could also be explained by alterations in phosphatidylcholine (PC) formation. PC are formed by two pathways. The most utilized is the de novo conversion of choline to PC via the CDP-choline pathway, which preferentially forms PC containing saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. In the other pathway phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is converted to PC through three methylation steps utilizing the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). This pathway preferentially forms PC containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus decreased PEMT activity would be predicted to result in decreased DHA and LA levels. This is supported by results seen in PEMT knockout mice (Watkins et al, J Nutrition, 2003) showing decreased DHA and LA levels, and variable to increased levels of arachidonic acid (AA). Furthermore, Innis et al have shown that CF patients have decreased choline levels making them more dependent on the PEMT pathway. We hypothesized that alterations in fatty acid levels in CF may be due at least in part to decreased PEMT activity.",

We have now incorporated it into our Vivometrics LifeShirt, an ambulatory physiologic monitoring device which will allow us to examine supraesophageal pH and its relationship to sleep apnea, cough, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Aim: Monitoring and adjusting dose requirements of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) are an integral part of the dietetic assessment of patients with CF. We investigated characteristics of enzyme use in our adult clinic population and determine the extent to which inappropriate enzyme use contributed to poor nutritional and clinical state. Method: Information was collected using an annonymous self-administered questionnaire developed to measure patient practice, knowledge and beliefs on PERT. Exclusion criteria included pancreatic sufficiency, <1500 units lipase/kg/d, and FEV1 <30%. Results: 49 out of potential clinic population of 72 patients completed the questionnaire (16-54y, 55% male, FEV1 31-125%). 67% of participants reported to never miss enzymes with meals; this was considerably lower for snacks (35%). Those patients who omit enzymes with meals also missed enzymes with snacks (r2=30%, p<0.001). A more appropriate use of PERT was observed in patients with lower as opposed to higher BMI. Despite intensive dietetic input 29% of patients missed PERT with foods containing fat and 20% took PERT inappropriately with food and drink that did not contain fat. The results identified 5 potentially better practices for measuring PERT behaviour and knowledge: 1) taking PERT with all meals, 2) taking PERT with majority of snacks 3) swallowing capsules intact rather than splitting them open, 4) carrying enzymes around with them and 5) the ability to titrate PERT in accordance to the fat content of food. Patients were scored on the basis of the above criteria to differentiate between prudent enzyme users and those who are compromising therapy. In conjunction with their nutritional status score (BMI and gastrointestinal symptoms) risk for intervention can be assessed. Discussion:Underweight patients have more optimal enzyme use, suggesting greater dietetic involvement in these patients. Schall et al 2006 also found this to be the case in children. The findings emphasised the need for targeted and effective input in patients where problems are less obvious. The questionnaire has been a useful research tool, and has been adapted as a screening tool for dietitians to gain a subjective perspective of patient's enzyme management and identify patients who need support. The combination of patient's PERT usage and their nutritional status could help capture and identify risk objectively and quickly and allows resources to be allocated most effectively.

Recognition of the CT appearances will prevent erroneous diagnosis of acute colonic disease in this patient population, and stimulate investigation of a biologic basis for this finding as a recognizable feature of adult cystic fibrosis. Intro: Infants and children with cystic fibrosis, both pancreatic sufficient and insufficient, are at risk for developing hyponatremia due to an excess loss of salt though skin during sweating. These children should receive daily supplemental sodium. Children without CF require 2-4 mEq/kg of sodium daily; and one could argue children with CF need more. A historical recommendation is 1/8 tsp table salt daily for infants; this contains 11 to 13mEq of sodium based on the density of the table salt. Parents may measure the salt inaccurately, and it may be difficult logistically to distribute the salt throughout the day. If supplementation is given as sodium chloride solutions distributed through pharmacies, as suggested in a recent Consensus Conference, co-pays or full payments may be required. Our aim is to provide a simple, inexpensive, and more accessible method for accurately giving sodium supplementation.

Background: Ten to forty percent of people with CF have vitamin D deficiency secondary to pancreatic insufficiency. Obtaining optimal vitamin D levels (25-OHD) has been a challenge. For vitamin D deficient individuals, current supplementation strategies (50,000 IU weekly for 2 months) have been mostly unsuccessful.",

The consensus guidelines for measuring vitamin D concentrations and treatment of vitamin D insufficiency should be revisited based on recent studies and expert opinion. Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who suffer from sub-optimal growth are offered overnight enteral feeding via gastrostomy tube. This study aimed to assess the nutritional impact of overnight feeding over a 2 year period using a retrospective study design. Data, including height, weight, FEV1, pancreatic function were collated for all patients with CF who had a gastrostomy tube placed in the past 4 years. Data were collected at baseline and then every 6 months for 2 years post-gastrostomy insertion. Data for height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were converted into Z scores using Centre for Disease Control 2000 reference ranges and the LMS method (1, 2) . A total of 21 patients (7.7% of the clinic population) were identified as having a gastrostomy tube. Two were no longer receiving feeds and there were incomplete data for 6 subjects. On placement of the tubes, there were substantial deficits in nutritional status with mean Z scores for height -0.9 (SD 1.02), weight -1.43 (SD 0.71) and BMI -1.1 (SD 0.58), with compromised lung function (mean FEV1 69%, range 44-86). Using a repeated measures ANOVA with FEV1 as a co-variate, there were no significant differences in weight, height or BMI from baseline to 2 years (at 2 years post placement: mean Z scores for height -1.1 (SD 0.59), weight -1.36 (SD 0.56) and BMI -0.86 (SD 0.75). FEV1 remained stable over time. These results indicate that gastrostomy feeding can potentially halt the decline in nutritional status that is a feature of CF. However, patient expectations that over night enteral feeding will lead to an increase in nutritional status need to be sensitively managed. Background : Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life threatening autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians.Following a landmark paper by Corrie et al a high fat,high calorie diet has promoted a normal growth pattern.Improved nutritional status together with prevention and early treatment of respiratory infections has contributed to improved survival.",

Muscle mass (FFM), assessed by Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) correlates with lung function and with SK scores. The strongest correlation between markers of disease severity (SK scores and % predicted FEV 1 ) was with FFM. FFM may be expected to be associated with respiratory function tests.However,SK scores are a more general assessment of well being and less obviously directly related to muscle mass. FFM and growth may reflect long term nutrition and health in contrast to BMI and ln%TBF which may reflect acute deterioration or short term nutritional intervention. Therefore FFM may prove to be a useful tool to assess quality of nutrition and may be predictive of respiratory and general decline. Body composition assessment has an important role in chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis, in order to identify nutritional depletion and evaluate nutritional interventions. It is important that reliable and accurate methods are used. The usefulness of non-invasive methods, such as skinfold thickness measurements (SFT) to measure change in body composition has not been evaluated in CF.

            "text": "Conclusions: Serum levels of AGEs are elevated in adults with CF. Elevation is not restricted to those with CFRD. The levels of sRAGE reflect ability to respond to this pathway and are associated with poorer lung function. Modification of the diet in CF may reduce this mediator and may have the potential to modify lung and renal injury. Mouse models of CF generated by expression of improperly processed CFTR (\u2206F508) or lacking CFTR expression (KO) demonstrate selective induction of SULT1E1 in the liver (Falany et al., Biochem. J. 364:115, 2002) . SULT1E1 is responsible for the sulfation and inactivation of \u03b2-estradiol (E2) at physiological concentrations. The increase in SULT1E1 expression is specific to the hepatocyte, whereas CFTR is selectively expressed in cholangiocytes. The induction of SULT1E1 activity is associated with changes in levels of E2regulated proteins in CFTR (-/-) liver (Li and Falany, J Cystic Fibrosis 6:23, 2006) . Increased SULT1E1 activity is correlated with low body weight and decreased IGF-1 message levels in livers of CFTR(-/-). The mechanism for the induction of SULT1E1 in hepatocytes by cholanigiocytes lacking CFTR expression, and the mechanism for the inhibition of IGF-1 expression by increasing SULT1E1 expression was investigated in human cells. Human MMNK-1 cholangiocytes in which CFTR expression was inhibited by short interfering RNA (siRNA) induced SULT1E1 expression in human HepG2 hepatocytes when cocultured in a permeable membrane separated system. SULT1A1 expression was not altered in this model. The data suggests that loss of CFTR function in cholangiocytes is capable of selectively modulating SULT1E1 expression in hepatocytes. To investigate the ability of increased SULT1E1 activity to modulate expression of IGF-1, HepG2 cells were stably transformed with SULT1E1/pcDNA3 to activity levels intermediate to the levels observed in CFTR(-/-) mice. The increased SULT1E1 activity was associated with decreased IGF-1 message expression in the HepG2 cells. Since a major pathway for IGF-1 regulation involves growth hormone (GH) stimulation of STAT5b phosphorylation, the effects of E2 and increased SULT1E1 activity on GH stimulated STAT5b phosphorylation were examined. STAT5b activation was identified using immunoblot analysis with a rabbit anti-tyrosine phosphorylated-STAT5b antibody. Treatment of control HepG2 with 10 nM E2 prior to the addition of GH increases STAT5b phosphorylation. In HepG2 cells expressing increased SULT1E1 activity, the stimulation of STAT5b phosphorylation by 10 nM E2 was significantly decreased. E2 had an apparent rapid action on STAT5b phosphorylation that is not attenuated by the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780. E2 was effective at increasing STAT5b phosphorylation when applied to HepG2 cells 15-30 min before GH. Increased STAT5b phosphorylation was observed in control HepG2 cells at 1 nM E2 although 10-fold higher E2 concentrations were required in the SULT1E1-HepG2 cells consistent with the increased E2 sulfation. No differences were observed in total STAT5b in any of the studies. This study demonstrates that human cholangiocytes with low levels of functional CFTR are capable of inducing SULT1E1 expression in human hepatocytes and the increase in E2 sulfation inhibits the GH stimulation of IGF-1 expression via a decrease in STAT5b phosphorylation.

Our data also show that CFTR dysfunction leads to increased uptake of all tested fatty acids into the cells. Downregulation of this increased uptake may be one mechanism by which DHA exerts its therapeutic benefits. Low BMI in CF correlates directly with worsening lung function and is an independent risk factor for mortality. The causes for this decreased BMI are incompletely understood but could be related to levels of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin, and to levels of leptin, an anorexigen. Studies assessing plasma levels of leptin in CF have shown contradictory results, while the data on ghrelin in CF are scarce. We assessed both leptin and ghrelin plasma levels in mild (FEV1 > 75% predicted), moderate (FEV1 45% to 74% predicted), and severe (FEV1 < 45 % predicted) adult CF patients. We compared these levels in CF subjects to 20 age matched controls with normal BMI (range 19.5 to 24.5 kg/m2).",

Plasma levels of ghrelin and leptin did not differ from normals in those with mild and moderate disease. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in CF before and after lung transplant (LTx). Laparascopic fundoplication (LapF) is used when patients fail on conservative medical therapy. Aims: To review longer term clinical outcomes of LapF in patients with CF in terms of lung function, Body Mass Index (BMI), reflux symptoms, patient satisfaction with surgery and complications. Method: Retrospective review of patient records and patient questionnaire to gather relevant information. Results:Thirty-two patients with CF underwent Lap.F recently; 15 transplanted (LTxGroup), 8 female (mean age 40 [21-67]) years, and 17 not transplanted (CF Group), 14 female (35 ). The median time between LTx & LapF was 654 (414; 1133) days, range 145-1838. Endoscopy was undertaken in 27 patients prior to surgery and all underwent 24hr pH monitoring. Complete (Nissen) LapF was undertaken in 50% patients and a partial (Toupet) in the other 50%. Total median time in the operating theatre was 143(81-232) minutes. The average length of stay in hospital (in days) in the LTxGroup: pre-op. was 7.81; post-op. was 7.82 days; and in the CF Group was: 5.2 and 12.5 respectively. Lung function (FEV1 and FVC in percent predicted) and BMI were measured at minus(-)100, plus (+)100, +200 and +300 days from LapF. Patient satisfaction with LapF was a mean of 95% in the LTx Group and 85% in the CF Group and improvement in reflux symptoms of 90% in both groups. Nocturnal cough reduced markedly in the CF Group and there was an overall improvement in quality of life in both groups. Complications consisted of 2 port site hernias, 1 failed LapF with re-operation 20 months later; 2 esophageal dilatations and 1 patient with lower esophageal sphincter hypotonia. There were 3 deaths on Day 19, 253 and 382 post fundoplication. One was in a non-transplanted patient with recurrent episodes of hemoptysis. She succumbed to a catastrophic hemoptysis episode not related to LapF. The other 2 were in transplanted patients. Conclusions: In this relatively small series of patients there was a small but significant drop in FEV1 in the LTx Group 300 days after LapF, but not in the CF Group who remained stable throughout the review period. There was a significant drop in BMI in both groups after LapF, but the CF Group returned to pre LapF values at +300 days. Patient satisfaction with the procedure was high. Fundoplication is an expensibe complicated procedure not without risk. A long term prospective study is warranted. Historically this phenomenon has been attributed to intestinal malabsorption and cachexia as a consequence of chronic lung infection. However, CF mice exhibit similar growth and weight deficits but are not afflicted with malabsorption or lung infection, suggesting other mechanisms are participating as well. We hypothesize that small size is in part a result of increased \u03b2-oxidation in adipose stores. To test this we utilized a mouse model to study lipid metabolism. Our study includes female CF mice with a null mutation in the Cftr gene. These mice are congenic on the C57BL/6J background as well as age matched with their controls (WT) to 50-70 days. Liver, adipose and skeletal muscle (calf) were dissected from WT and CF mice in a fed state. Tissues were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA and protein lysate harvest. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using primers for the lipogenic isoform of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1\u03b1 (ACC1\u03b1) in the liver and adipocytes, whereas the non-lipogenic isoform ACC2\u03b2 was assessed in the skeletal muscle. Primers for acyl CoA oxidase (AOX), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and long acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) were used as gene markers for \u03b2-oxidation steps in the peroxisome, carnitine shuttle and mitochondrion, respectively. Western Blots were performed to detect ACC (active) and phospho-ACC (inactive) forms. The results show that there is a decrease in the total amount of ACC protein in the fat as well as the skeletal muscle of the CF mice and the ratio of ACC:phospho-ACC is substantially lower in the CF tissues. Phosphorylation and/or decreased expression of ACC results in decreased expression of malonyl CoA, leading to a cascade of events that increase \u03b2-oxidation. In addition, increased expression of AOX and LCAD, two downstream \u03b2-oxidation genes, is also observed. Hyperactivity of the \u03b2-oxidation pathway could account for the decreased adipose stores seen in CF mice compared to the WT. Such patterns of expression are reminiscent of starvation. Caloric intake and intestinal absorption of dietary lipid were measured and CF animals consumed approximately 110% the calories of WT animals (per gram body weight) and lipid absorption was not significantly different (94% for CF, 97% for WT), indicating the CF animals have sufficient access to nutrition. We will continue to investigate fatty acid synthesis and degradation pathways during both the fed and fasted states to delineate the mechanism.

Medicine, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA Extracellular ATP is an important signaling molecule contributing to bile formation by the liver through binding biliary epithelial cell (cholangiocyte) membrane P2 receptors and stimulating Cl-efflux. Importantly, ATP appears to work through Cl-channels unrelated to CFTR, suggesting it may be a potential way to modulate bile flow in CF liver disease. However, the signaling pathways linking receptor binding to channel activation in cholangiocytes are unknown. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to identify the pathways responsible for ATP-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i and membrane Clpermeability in a human biliary epithelial cell model. Studies were performed in Mz-cha-1 human biliary cells; [Ca2+]i was measured by Fura-2 and membrane Cl-currents by patch-clamp techniques. Results: Exposure of cells to ATP (100 \u00b5M) resulted in a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i to 1054.23 \u00b1 244.90 nM (n=6) which was abolished by prior depletion of intracellular Ca2+ by thapsigargin (37.94 \u00b1 14.50 nM; n= 7), but unaffected by removal of extracellular Ca2+ (EGTA, 819.00 \u00b1 211.94 nM; n= 7). In parallel studies, ATP (50 \u00b5M) increased current density from -1.99 \u00b1 05 pA/pF to -13.20 \u00b1 2.00 pA/pF (n= 19) . Currents reversed at 0 mV (ECl-), were outwardly rectifying, and were inhibited by the Cl-channel inhibitor NPPB (-1.81 \u00b1 1.71 pA/pF, n= 6), but not the CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh172. ATP failed to activate currents after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by BAPTA-AM (-0.70 \u00b1 0.72 pA/pF, n=3). The P2Y receptor antagonist suramin inhibited ATP-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i (50.04 \u00b1 8.17 nM; n= 7) and Cl-channel activity (-2.25 \u00b1 0.80 pA/pF; n= 6). However, the P2X receptor antagonist brilliant blue G did not affect the magnitude of ATP-stimulated Cl-currents (-14.63 \u00b1 1.81 pA/pF, n=4). Together these findings suggest that ATP activates Cl-currents primarily through P2Y, but not P2X, receptors in human biliary cells. Since P2Y are G-proteincoupled receptors and modulate [Ca2+]i by phospholipase C (PLC) generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a series of experiments were designed to directly assess the effects of IP3 receptor inhibition or stimulation on ATPstimulated Cl-currents. First, the PLC inhibitor, U73122 blocked ATP-stimulated Cl-currents (0.86 \u00b1 0.60 pA/pF; n= 3). Second, the specific IP3 receptor blocker 2-APB, inhibited both the ATP-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i (34.36 \u00b1 7.33 nM, n= 4) as well as membrane Cl-currents (-0.13 \u00b1 0.55 pA/pF, n= 6). Lastly, intracellular dialysis with purified IP3 during whole-cell patch clamp activated Cl-currents with identical properties to those activated by ATP (-9.40 \u00b1 1.23 pA/pF, n=4). Together these studies demonstrate that extracellular ATP stimulates Ca2+-activated Cl-channels in cholangiocytes primarily through P2Y receptor binding and PLC/IP3-dependent release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Thus, the P2Y-IP3 receptor signaling complex represents a potential target to increase cholangiocyte secretion, and hence augment bile flow, in the treatment of the cholestatic liver disease associated with CF.",

Methods: Eligible patients were < 7 years with CF and EPI, in acceptable nutritional status, needing PEPs and clinically stable. Patients consumed a standard CF recommended diet, could not take drugs affecting gastric pH or motility. The trial involved a 7-day dose stabilization period and a 7-day treatment period. Patients switched from their baseline enzyme treatment without washout. The optimal dose of EUR-1008, determined during dose stabilization, was used during treatment. Primary endpoint compared malabsorption of fat after EUR-1008 vs. previous treatment. Clinical symptoms were also evaluated, as was physicians' and parents' judgment on the control of malabsorption signs and symptoms. Safety measures included AEs, physical exams, vital signs and changes in clinical laboratory findings, including cholesterol levels and fat-soluble vitamins. Results: Nineteen patients (12 male) enrolled and completed all study phases. Mean age was 3.9 years (range 1-6). Percentage of responders (patients without steatorrhea (<30% fecal fat content) and without signs and symptoms of malabsorption after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment) was 52.6 at baseline, 68.4 (P=0.375 vs. base) after stabilization and 57.9 (P =0.999 vs. base) at study end. Frequency and oily stools showed a significant decrease vs. baseline at study end. The mean number of stools per day was 1.82 stools at screening and 1.45 stools during treatment (P<0.001). The mean proportion of stool samples with visible oil or grease at screening was 11.10% and 4.73% during treatment (P=0.001). A statistically significant improvement was seen in the incidence of moderate bloating. Physicians characterized 37% of patients as \"improved\" in the control of EPI signs and symptoms vs. previous therapies and 63% as \"unchanged\" at the end of the treatment phase, while parent assessments were 47% \"improved\" and 53% \"unchanged.\" Vitamin K absorption (measured through PIVKA) improved with EUR-1008 treatment over prior PEP treatment measured at baseline. EUR-1008 was safe and well tolerated, with minimal AEs. No AEs led to discontinuation of study drug interruption. No incidences of uric acid toxicity or fibrosing colonopathy following EUR-1008 treatment. No trends were seen in lab parameters, physical examination, or vital signs. Conclusion: EUR-1008 is effective, safe, well-tolerated in the treatment of EPI in young CF patients. Treatment controlled malabsorption and clinical symptoms of EPI in young patients with CF. Safety and efficacy of EUR-1008 in this trial is consistent with the pivotal phase III trial. There is an association between the presence of CF and alterations in fatty acid metabolism, consisting of a decrease in linoleate (18:2n-6). More recently, a deficiency of docosahexaenoate (22:6n-3, DHA) has arisen as a prominent fatty acid abnormality in CF.",

However, little is known whether there is a gender diff\u00e9rence in pubertal growth pattern in CF children. Delayed and attenuated pubertal growth are commonly observed in adolescents with CF. However, characterizing height velocity (HV) pattern is very challenging because of errors associated with calculating HV, e.g. interpolation and extrapolation between 2 heights measured in irregular intervals, as well as difficulties in determining the location and the magnitude of peak height velocity (PHV). In this study, we applied a new statistical method, namely, the semi-parametric shape-invariant model, to characterize the HV pattern of CF children. This method is based on the assumption that all individuals' growth curves have a common shape. Therefore, this method attempts to shift and stretch (squeeze) individual's growth data until they can be modeled by the common shape curve. The semi-parametric shape-invariant model has the advantage of fitting measured heights directly, thereby eliminating the errors associated with calculating HV.",

Our results showed that girls exhibited a typical growth deceleration during late preadolescence, followed by accelerated HV and a single PHV during adolescence (Figure) . Unexpectedly, CF boys exhibited a notable HV peak during late preadolescence in addition to the typical adolescent PHV (Figure) . Overall, the mean magnitude and age of PHV was 7.4 cm at 14.6 years for boys and 6.6 cm at 11.9 years for girls. When compared to PHV of non-CF children based on Tanner's reference (Pediatr. 1985, 107:317) , CF boys showed a greater delay in the age of PHV while CF girls showed a greater attenuation in the magnitude of PHV.

This overfill issue was first examined by Whitehead who reported overfills ranging from 14 to 39% after analyzing several commercially available PEPs (Whitehead AM. Pharm Weekbl Sci. 1988) . The USP presently allows for PEP overfills up to 65%. Thus, the actual active lipase content of a PEP capsule labelled at 10,000 IU might vary from 9,000 to 16,500 units according to its \"freshness.\" As a result, patients taking PEPs receive a product with variable potency, which can lead to efficacy issues, increased pill burden, unnecessary drug interactions, and product switching.

There were no notable changes in serum lipids, vitamin A and E values, mean weight or BMI in patients who received EUR-1008. EUR-1008 was safe and well-tolerated. There were no unexpected or significant differences in the frequency or type of AEs between EUR-1008 and placebo, and no trends were seen in lab parameters or vital signs.

The therapeutic benefit of EUR-1008 was seen even in patients with very high CFA values (>80%). The relative infrequency of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD), until recently, means little is known about hypoglycaemia ('hypos') associated with its treatment. Insulin is frequently taken by those who have CFRD, for whom the risk of hypoglycaemia may be high due to dramatic changes in insulin sensitivity that can occur with pulmonary exacerbations and a decreased ability to secrete glucagon. A number of studies involving people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have reported on their experiences of hypoglycaemia, but whether results from such investigations apply to CFRD is unclear. An exploratory investigation was conducted to compare the type, frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms experienced by patients who had CFRD with patients who had T1DM.",

Fewer neuroglycopenic symptoms in the former could be related to their shorter duration of diabetes or to how CFRD was managed; patients with CFRD were given shorter acting insulin, making them less prone to 'hypos' during the night, and had a high sugar diet to ensure weight maintenance. Differences between the groups could also be related to specific characteristics of these two forms of diabetes. Table 1 : Data from questionnaire insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between PEM and the risk of developing glucose intolerance and/or CFRD and the effect on lung function in children \u226421 years of age whose history suggests PEM. Patients whose diagnosis of CF was suggested by failure to thrive(FTT) and whose growth parameters remain <10% for weight and height for age were identified as having incurred PEM. A retrospective analysis of our CF Registry database was performed. 173 CF patients \u226421 years old were identified. 32 of 173 patients(18.5%) had CFRD. 103(59.5%) of these plotted <10% for weight and height (PEM)and 23(22.3%) were diagnosed with CFRD. Further review of the 103 patients showed 35 whose diagnosis of CF was suggested by FTT and 10 (28.6%) of those 35 had CFRD. Statistical analysis did not show a clinical significance, but a strong relationship is implied. Pulmonary function, FEV1%, was significantly lower in the PEM/CFRD patients (mean FEV1 63.5% \u00b1 24.36%) than the PEM only group, (mean FEV1 88.17% \u00b1 22.14%)(p=0.0001). This review provides further support that patients who have PEM are at increased risk of developing CFRD. A significant risk was not established; however a strong association is suggested. Assessment of a larger cohort of patients may show a stronger relationship. Findings from this study would suggest that further research into the physiological relationship between PEM and CFRD should be initiated. CFRD screening should be considered at a younger age than the current CFF recommended age of >14 years. Diagnosing CFRD/glucose intolerance early may contribute to improve growth parameters, preserve lung function, and improve survival. Based on this review, our center is initiating CFRD screening for all patients \u2265 10 years, and considers screening for all PEM patients \u22656 years. Background: Patients with CF are thought to have a rapid postprandial rise in plasma glucose which may be followed by a delayed and prolonged insulin response and hypoglycemia. We sought to estimate the prevalance, cumulative one year incidence, and factors associated with hypoglycemia during oral glucose tolerance testing in non-diabetic adults with CF. We also compared the prevalence of hypoglycemia to a geographically matched cohort of young adults without CF. Methods: We performed a prospective study of 161 individuals aged over 16 years with CF followed in clinic providing population-based, specialized care in Cambridgeshire, England. We excluded patients with previously-diagnosed diabetes or taking anti-diabetic medications. We evaluated 108 individuals who underwent 75 g 2 hour oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) in 2004. Of these, 65 individuals had neither new diabetes nor hypoglycemia in 2004 and were retested using OGTT in 2005. We testing the association between biochemical and anthropometric factors measured in 2004 with the prevalence of hypoglycemia in 2004, and incident hypoglycemia in 2005. Biochemical hypoglycemia was defined as a blood glucose between <4.0 mmol/l (72 mg/dl), but greater or equal to 2.5 mmol/l (45 mg/dl) and severe hypoglycemia as a value lower than 2.5 mmol/l on either the fasting or post glucose challenge value. For comparison, we used data from the Cambridgeshire-based Young Ely Study of 183 individuals age 30 -48 years who underwent 75 g OGTT testing in 1994 -1995 . Results: In 2004 , in patients with CF, the prevalence of fasting hypoglycemia was 5.5%. No patients had fasting severe hypoglycemia. Following glucose challenge, 20.2% and 2.8% of patients had glucose values consistent with hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia respectively. There were no diferrences in age, hepatic, pulmonary or renal function, but patients with hypoglycemia at two hours were five times more like to be male (odds ratio 5.1, 95% CI 1.7 -15.6) and more likely to have a higher BMI. The prevalence of a 2 hours value of < 4.0 mmol/l in patients with CF at 22.9% (25/109) was not different than in controls 20.7% (38/183). Of patients who did not have hypoglycemic readings in 2004, at one year, 1 patient developed fasting hypoglycemia and 14 individuals developed post-challenge hypoglycemic for a cumulative incidence 21.5%. Of these 6.2 % (4) had values in the range of severe hypoglycemia. There were no differences between age, sex, BMI, liver, renal, or pulmonary function in those who did and did not develop hypoglycemia. Conclusions: Hypoglycemia appears common in patients with CF but is also common in a healthy population. Male sex and BMI were associated with post load hypoglycemia in patients with CF in cross-sectional analyses only. Further research needs to assess whether these low blood glucose values are associated with symptoms.",

Z scores (BMD adjusted for age and gender) were used so that male and female data could be analyzed collectively. Patient perceived health (PPH) was rated by four questions and totaled for the PPH score, which ranged from 4-12 with the highest score indicating the best health. Functional status (FS) was rated by three questions that reflect the degree to which CF interferes with school, work or play. The total FS score ranged from 3-9, with the highest score representing the least interference with life. Questions on PPH and FS were derived from a validated clinical assessment tool, the CF questionnaire (CFQ) (1) . RESULTS: All CF adult patients (n=46, age 18 and older) were offered participation in the study. DXA of total hip and lumbar spine was performed on 39 patients (85%); 30 (65%) of these patients also completed the survey. 51% of patients had low bone density on DXA (Z score <-1). 62 % of male CF adults had low bone density vs 39 % of females. Fracture was reported by 57% of patients who completed the survey (64% female and 50% male). Lower PPH score was associated with lower Z score at the hip and spine. Lower FS score was associated with lower Z score at the hip and spine. Low body mass index was associated with low Z scores at both hip and spine.

Overall 75% thought that nearly all men with CF were infertile, 25% did not know how many were affected, and 66% could describe the exact nature of infertility. Only 50% knew that treatment for infertility was available: 33% of these thought it was rarely successful and 33% were unsure of success rates. Although 75% had thought of having children at some stage, only 15% had sought investigation of infertility. Two men had children, one by ICSI and one by donor insemination. Overall 67% feared that the child could have CF and 53% worried that their health would affect their ability to function as a parent. In terms of receiving advice 57% thought that this should be given by a fertility specialist, 27% by a CF physician and 16% by a primary care physician. With regard to fertility treatment 44% thought that decisions should be made by the patients and their partners, 26% by the patient alone, and 30% by a doctor. The reluctance of men with CF to seek fertility treatment appears to be due to many factors including lack of knowledge of available treatments, fears about the child inheriting CF, and concerns that their health would adversely affect their role as a parent.",

The combination of hypertrypsinogenemia and two CFTR gene defects is consistent with the presence of a CFTR-related disorder (CFTR-RD). Although these neonates are usually healthy at diagnosis, the long-term phenotypical consequences may be highly variable. Such variability makes impossible to predict the clinical outcome, and provide satisfactory genetic counselling for the family.

Healthcare providers are busy addressing the medical needs of patients and are often not well equipped to provide detailed information about the legal rights of their patients. The Hotline provides important information to both patients and healthcare providers that can optimize both patient care and outcomes. Access to legal information can result in individuals obtaining health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare or other state coverage that in turn results in better access to treatment. Legal information can also lead to important modifications in the educational or employment environment for the individual with CF. These modifications can be critical in allowing those individuals access to important care and treatments. Providing information that can help individuals obtain Social Security or Long Term Disability benefits can result in a monthly benefit and health insurance that then allows the individual to devote more time to their healthcare. Many people with CF and healthcare providers lack information about the legal rights of individuals with CF. Understanding the legal rights of people with CF can reduce obstacles to obtaining care, optimize education and employment, and increase access to retirement benefits. Further work needs to be done to identify ways to make individuals with CF and healthcare providers aware of the Hotline.",

Justifiably, with the potential for cross-infection, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has urged caution for the CF population in having face-to-face interactions. In 2004, our CF Care Center recognized this need and sponsoredwith guidance from staff facilitators-an on-going adult support group. Prior to the formation of the group pre-and on-site group IC protocols were developed. At the pre-group stage, the physician initially certifies that the patient is free from aggressive pathogens. Each time the patient RSVP's permission to attend a group session, the physician must 'recertify' this status. On-site protocols emphasize a number of IC precautions to minimize crossinfection. The Center recognized that by developing such a support group, 'patient and family centered care' could be enhanced. A goal in the group's formation was to create 'mutually beneficial partnerships among patients, families, and healthcare providers'.",

The purpose of ACP is to develop a treatment plan promoting a high quality of life for those near the end of life. Such planning is especially appropriate in persons with life limiting disease. Minimal research exists on the advance care planning process of adults with CF.<p>Methods: In the fifth survey wave of the Project on Adult Care in Cystic Fibrosis (PAC-CF), an ongoing longitudinal panel study of CF adults from 10 CF centers in the US, participants were asked to report on their opinions and experiences with advance care planning. The survey asked about opinions on advance care planning documents, communication about advance care planning with family and clinicians and whether a directive had been completed. Clinical data were obtained from the participating centers. Preliminary bivariate analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with completing an advance care directive.<p>Results: 233/303 (77%) surveys were completed. The mean age was 34 \u00b1 13 years, 63% were female, and the mean FEV1 (% predicted) was 69 \u00b1 28. 77% reported that they had spoken to someone about the care they would want if they became too ill to make their own decisions in the future, 65% had thought about whom they would want as their healthcare proxy, and 60% reported having specific wishes about the types of medical treatment they want or would not want if they became too ill to make decisions for themselves in the future. However, only 33% reported completing a healthcare proxy form, living will or any other type of written instructions concerning advance care directives. 80% of respondents reported feeling comfortable talking to their clinician about ACP. 28% of subjects said that their CF clinicians have asked them about ACP, and only 11% reported that they have discussed ACP with their CF clinician. The following characteristics were significantly related (p<.05) to completion of an advance care directive: female gender (38% vs. 25%), age (mean 37 years vs. 33 years), having a college degree (41% vs. 23%), being married currently or in the past (38% vs. 25%), having children (41% vs. 28%), having diabetes (48% vs. 31%), having specific wishes about treatment decisions (46% vs. 15%), and reporting that a clinician had discussed ACP with them (59% vs. 24%).<p>Discussion: Though the majority of CF adults report thinking about, communicating with family and deciding on their advance care wishes, only a minority report completing any legal documentation supporting their decision. Additionally, very few CF adults report being asked about ACP by their clinicians and even fewer report discussing ACP with them. Formulating specific wishes and discussing ACP with a clinician are strongly associated with completing an advance care directive, suggesting that if clinicians were more active in talking to their patients about ACP, patients are much more likely to complete advance care directives. Efforts to improve clinician communication with CF adults around the issues of advance care planning are needed. Objectives: Caregiver involvement in children's CF treatments fosters better adherence and improved health outcomes. Several studies have suggested that parents of children with CF report elevated symptoms of depression (Quittner et al., 1998) , however, there is no data on the effects of caregiver depression on adherence. Adherence to treatment is difficult to measure in patients with CF, and prior research has relied primarily on self-report, which is likely to be inflated. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of caregiver depression on adherence to enzymes using both parent-reported and electronically monitored enzyme adherence over a three-month period. In addition, we examined the relationship between depression, rates of enzyme adherence and short-term changes in weight.",

Adolescents completed these measures for each parent and both parents, if available, completed them with respect to their teen. The Problem-Solving, Communication, and Beliefs subscales from the PARQ were administered. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: BFST, FE or SC. Families in the BFST group received ten 90-minute sessions over a 6 month period, including family problem-solving, communication skills training, and cognitive restructuring. Families assigned to the FE group received ten 90minute psychoeducational sessions over 6 months aimed at increasing knowledge about CF and its management. Those in the SC group received their usual care at the CF Center. The CBQ and PARQ were completed pre, post and 6, 12 and 18 months following the intervention.",

In contrast, interviewees with T1DM had to re-evaluate their previous sense of self as 'healthy' and adjust to manag-ing a long-term complaint. These individuals were more likely to talk about diabetes in relation to a range of competing commitments (e.g. work or family related) and to describe feeling psychologically low due to diabetes compared to patients with CFRD, the latter depicting demands from their primary illness (CF) as a major obstacle to caring for diabetes. Participants with CFRD recalled feeling lucky when told they would not face strict dietary restraints, which they associated with other forms of diabetes, and seemed less concerned about diabetic complications than those with T1DM.

The purpose of this study is to examine rates of medication adherence across a wide age span using an objective measure of adherence and to compare adherence to health outcomes. METHODS: Patients with CF age 6 years or older who are prescribed azithromycin, colistin, hypertonic saline, pulmozyme, and/or TOBI for at least one year are eligible. Recruitment is ongoing. The previous year's medication refill records were requested from participant-identified pharmacies. A Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) was calculated for each drug and was defined as the sum of all days of medication supply received during the 12 months divided by the number of days the medication was prescribed. Values were truncated to 100% and averaged across all medications to obtain a Composite Score. Medical records were abstracted to identify the prescribed drug regimen and health outcomes (e.g., lung function, exacerbations, BMI) over the same time period. RESULTS: Thus far, 100 patients have joined the study (80% participation rate), resulting in 213 pharmacy records requested (86 unique pharmacies). Of the first 48 participants with complete pharmacy data, the mean age was 21.5 years (SD=11.9; Range= 7-69) and 56% were female. The table presents MPR data for each drug and Composite Score overall and stratified by child, adolescent, and adult participants. The complexity of the drug regimen and age were significantly correlated with the Composite Score (rho= -.39 and rho= -.29 respectively; p<.05). Future analyses will compare the Composite Score and each drug's MPR with health outcomes. CON-CLUSIONS: Participants had suboptimal medication adherence similar to that reported in the literature. As MPR provides the maximal possible level of adherence, actual adherence may be even lower. Poor adherence spanned the age groups and was associated with regimen complexity. Children had the highest adherence, but also the least complicated drug regimen. These results suggest that obtaining pharmacy records is a viable means to objectively assessing medication adherence. Moreover, results suggest that interventions targeting medication adherence may be a strategy for improving health outcomes, particularly for adolescents and adults.",

Lack of REM and Delta sleep have significant implications for the daytime functioning of pediatric patients with CF, potentially leading to impaired memory and attention which would reduce their ability to complete typical activities, such as school work and disease-specific tasks related to self care and adherence. Based on these clinic findings, the authors are beginning a prospective study on the effects of sleep on neuropsychological functioning, well-being and compliance in pediatric patients with CF. Future research should examine the relationship between decreased slow wave, REM sleep and psychosocial outcomes, including attention, memory, and health-related quality of life. There are diagnostic challenges related to non-classic CF (Knowles and Durie, 2002) particularly patients presenting in adolescence or adulthood with obstructive azoospermia, chronic sinopulmonary disease and chronic or acute, recurrent pancreatitis. Practitioners are often unable to provide clarity to patients about diagnosis, disease course, and prognosis. Potential harms and benefits of relaying a clear or unclear diagnosis may be psychological rather than physical and have long-term implications for mental and social well-being. The aim of the current study is to assess the psychological impact of diagnostic information for adults presenting with a CF phenotype, be it confirmatory (CF or most likely not CF) or unclear. Method: We administered self report measures pertaining to psychological state, cognitive appraisal and uncertainty in a welldefined cohort of adult patients. Presenting symptoms of patients include chronic sinopulmonary disease, obstructive azoospermia, pancreatitis, and those presenting with more than more CF phenotype. Patients completed the self-report measures on two occasions: at the time of diagnostic testing and 6 months after being counseled and notified of the diagnostic results. At the time of the initial assessment, the subjects were unaware of the test results and had not been seen by a CF physician. Results: We provide interim observations on 70 patients (sinopulmonary (n=34), obstructive azoospermia (n=20), pancreatitis (n=4), and multiple phenotypes (n=6) who completed the initial assessment. At the time of diagnostic testing, the level of depression, hostility, anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity were elevated in each group (T score > 65); male patients reported significantly greater depression, anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity than female patients. Compared to published normative data of patients with mixed chronic illnesses, patients presenting with sinopulmonary or pancreatic disorders reported significantly more uncertainty(p < .05). To date, 26 of these patients have completed the measures 6 months after receiving the diagnostic information. Preliminary review of results shows that the level of depression, hostility, anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity remained elevated while the degree of uncertainty decreased. Among the 26 patients who completed assessment at 6 months, 17 patients were told that it was unlikely that they had CF, 7 were told that they had mild CF, while 2 were given an unclear diagnosis. Those who were told that they did not have CF reported more uncertainty than those who were told they had CF (p < .05). Detailed analyses related to outcome diagnosis will be conducted at the time of study completion (October 2007) . When this study is complete, the information will assist in our understanding of the psychological impact of a genetic diagnosis at an older age, identify issues confronting those individuals and help to establish appropriate paradigms for delivering complex information about genetic diseases.",

The ultimate goal for each patient is reaching the green zone. The caregiver, patient and nutritionist review the current nutritional status and a mutually accepted weight gain goal is established. The goal is recorded on the NAP which is then signed by the nutritionist and patient. This contract establishes a commitment to achieve the goal by the next clinic visit. A reward system is implemented in conjunction with the NAP. For patients reaching their goal, a previously agreed upon prize is given. Patients achieving some weight gain but falling short of their goal receive a gift such as candy or small toys that serve as an incentive for continued weight gain.

This improvement was particularly pronounced among the part-time RNs who found it easier to obtain a more accurate history of patient's illnesses without asking for assistance from other CF team members. Since the algorithm and CF phone note are newly implemented, tracking for consistency with the CF phone note will continue, revisions will be made as needed, and phone notes for conditions other than pulmonary exacerbation may be developed. METHODS: In 2000, Helen DeVos Children's Hospital integrated Research Coordinators (RC) from the Spectrum Health Research Department into the CF Care team. This model incorporates two key aspects: 1. a shared resource of experienced, centrally educated and trained research coordinators (RC) with three RC's having a primary CF focus 2. Incorporation of RC's into Helen DeVos CF Care Centers' multidisciplinary team for weekly contact with patients. Using the CF Registry consent as a starting point of research discussion with the patients and families, the RC's present new and upcoming opportunities and answer questions about research. With attendance at local and national CF meetings, RC's have expanded their CF knowledge, networked with other RC's and explored new research trials. Our site also integrated education about various aspects of research into both the clinical staff and CF Family Education meetings.

A small number of clinics also cited \"intellectually challenged patient\" and \"reluctant patient\" as reasons to delay transfer.

In some cases the advice they had already been given may not have been appropriate for patients with CF. Furthermore, few patients appeared to have had effective counselling in the paediatric sector, despite the risk of pregnancy. We are working with patients and paediatric colleagues to improve the education in this important area for our women with CF. The state of Minnesota added cystic fibrosis to the newborn screening panel on March 1, 2006. One-year follow-up to date reveals 286 infants have screened positive, of the screen positive, 23 have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, 30 infants are pending sweat chloride tests and evaluation. Of this population 8 infants are being followed by the Minnesota CF Center. The University has a comprehensive, interdisciplinary team available to provide care to infants, children and adults with cystic fibrosis. In response to newborn screening for cystic fibrosis, the center has implemented a prophylactic care program to include clinical care through early intervention and education within the first two weeks of life. Benefits of collaborative care have been previously identified in the literature, showing improved quality of care with increased patient satisfaction, lower mortality, and improved outcomes. Infants who are identified by newborn screening and receive earlier treatment have the potential for improved physical health and development. The inclusion of comprehensive genetic consultation as an integral component of CF education, allows for informed reproductive decisions. The newborn screening intervention plan is supervised by a nurse practitioner and consists of initial evaluation, initial therapy implementation, and a teaching/consultation schedule, which covers a minimum of four appointments scheduled over 2 weeks. Follow-up visits are scheduled within 24 hours of referral and then at one week, 10 days and 2 weeks post referral. The schedule is adjusted based on infant acuity and family needs. Initial evaluation consists of the confirmatory sweat chloride testing and/or genetic mutation analysis, serum laboratories, chest x-ray, stool for fecal elastase, and nasopharyngeal culture. General, supportive teaching with evidence from the literature is provided. Preliminary results to date demonstrate that our infants have had no pulmonary exacerbations, no pulmonary hospitalizations with pulmonary functions obtained in over half of the infants. Nasopharyngeal cultures obtained at the time of ascertainment demonstrate newborn screening patients have positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter junii and Alcaligenes faecalis.",

PA is a free fatty acid, while HA requires hydrolysis of triheptadecanoic acid (THA) by pancreatic enzymes for absorption. Objective: To determine the MBT reproducibility in healthy subjects and subjects with CF. Methods: Subjects with CF ingested a liquid test meal including 2 fats (PA and THA) on 3 occasions at least 5 days apart. For each subject, a standard dose of PERT (80,000 lipase units) or the subject's usual dose (if higher) was given with each test meal. Serum was analyzed for PA and HA levels at baseline and then hourly for 8 hours. A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using PA and HA concentration-time data from subjects with CF. C max was directly observed from the individual subject profiles, and AUC was calculated using the linear trapezoid rule. Summary statistics (mean\u00b1s.d.) were calculated for all parameters. Reproducibility of the MBT was also assessed in healthy adult controls tested on 3 occasions. Between subject (BSV, %) and within subject variability (WSV, %) was calculated for PA, HA and the HA/PA ratio. Results: BSV (%) and WSV (%) of PA and HA absorption are presented in the Table for 9 subjects with CF (age 17.8\u00b13.9 y, 4 females) and 6 healthy adult subjects (age 25.8\u00b13.8 y, 4 females). As expected, the MBT had greater reproducibility in healthy controls than in subjects with CF. In healthy controls, the reproducibility for PA and HA absorption was comparable; there is less WSV than BSV, and the HA/PA ratio has the best reproducibility. In subjects with CF, PA and the HA/PA ratio show less WSV than HA.

Children who perceived themselves to be relatively healthy were less likely to have an information processing style characterized by high levels of monitoring (r = -.39, p < .05), and they reported fewer Trait Anxiety symptoms (r = -.50, p < .01). Monitoring, as hypothesized, was associated with increased Trait Anxiety (r = .52, p = .001). Low BMI, a potential indicator of poor nutritional status and physical health among youth with CF, also was related to higher monitoring (r = -.34, p = .05) and Trait Anxiety (r = -.29, p = .10). Tests of mediation indicate that monitoring partially mediated the relation between poor health and Trait Anxiety for both child report of physical health (Goodman test: z = 1.86, p = .06) and for BMI (Goodman test: z = 1.67, p = .09), but not when parental report or FEV1 were used to assess youth's physical health, or when parental report of youth's internalizing symptoms was used as the outcome. Conclusion: Youth who tend to generally scan for and are attentive to changes in their environment, which may include their internal physical environment, were found to report more anxiety. Moreover, this monitoring style appears to partially mediate the relation between physical health and anxiety among youth with CF.

Befrienders see their role as mentoring, broadening young people's horizons and providing a safe place physically and emotionally. Challenges include: Forming and ending relationships, having multiple befrienders, ongoing support and training for befrienders, maintaining boundaries, sibling rivalry, and cost. Conclusions: Befriending is a new innovation in CF, and has the potential to make a difference to young people's lives.

To determine the efficiency of LV transduction, H441 lung adenocarcinoma cells were incubated with the LV vector at the dose of 500, 1000 and 2000 M.O.I. (multeplicity of infection) for 24 hours and 72 hours post-infection the expression of the NGFR reporter gene was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of NGFR positive cells was high at all vector doses, corresponding to 64%, 79% and 91% with 500, 1000 and 2000 M.O.I., respectively. H441 cells were transduced with the \u03b1A2 siRNA-LV (2000 M.O.I.); 96 hours later ENaC genes were induced with dexamethasone (50 nM, 6 hours) and \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunit mRNA content was determined by quantitative real time PCR. \u03b1A2shRNA-LV transduction determined 40-50% inhibition of \u03b1 subunit ENaC mRNA both in un-induced and induced conditions. A reduction in the amount of \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunit mRNA was also observed. A2shRNA-LV efficiency was investigated in domes, fluid-filled hemicystis which are formed in the presence of dexamethasone and are marker of ENaC localization to the cell membrane. Membrane potential assay (Molecular Devices) performed in H441 domes indicated that ENaC channel is active in our cell model since the addition of amiloride decreased cell-associated fluorescence in a dose dependent manner. Domes were transduced with the LV vector at the dose of 2000 M.O.I. and NGFR expression determined by FACS, giving only 0.6% of transduced cells. When cells were infected the day before dome appearance, LV efficiency rised to 92% of NGFR expressing cells. Our study shows that 1) lentiviral vector mediated expression of shRNAi cassette for the \u03b1 subunit of human ENaC could downregulate the expression of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunit mRNA in H441 cells 2) LV vector efficiently transduces H441 cells organized domes, which are a relevant model for the evaluation of ENaC function.

With chasing, the counts in the [ 3 H]INO-4913 peak diminished exponentially with a half-life of 48 hrs in Hela cells and 70 hrs in T84 cells. The appearance and timing of peaks eluting with retention times corresponding to IP3, IP2 and IP1 indicates that INO-4913 is metabolized by progressive dephosphorylation in both cell lines. This is consistent with the fact that the primary mode of metabolism of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, phosphorylation to InsP5, is not available to INO-4913 due to the octyl group on the 1 position and therefore INO-4995 metabolism is unlikely to contribute to the intracellular Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, IP5 or IP6 pools. Importantly, the kinetics of [ 3 H]INO-4913 intracellular appearance and persistence corresponds with the time course of physiological efficacy of INO-4995.",

In order to meet this need, it is expected that patient enrollment in clinical trials must double by 2009. Given the small percentage of patients enrolled in CF clinical trials nationwide (5-7 %), a new paradigm for research programs is needed to increase enrollment.

Lung transplantation remains a valid therapeutic option. It is unknown if CF patients receiving healthy lungs have an equal susceptibility to infections as compared to non-CF lung transplanted patients. Here we offer the largest analyses to date of the postoperative infection profiles of 60 from which 307 pathogens were isolated. Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominantly occupied 60.3%, followed by Mycobacteria spp. 7.2%, Aspergillus spp. 5.9% and Staphylococcus spp. 5.5%. However, 60 non-CF transplant patients had 154 respiratory infections with 165 pathogens isolated.

A single IRT measurement is used to determine the top 5% of daily specimens, which are then tested for a panel of 32 mutations. In the first four years of screening in New York State, there have been over 1 million infants screened for CF.Methods: Data was collected from the 11 CF Care Centers and the Newborn Screening Laboratory in New York State.Rock et al. previously reported an overrepresentation of CF screen-positive African American(AA)infants. Our data confirm this finding and demonstrate a two-fold increase in frequency of IRT>95%.During the first 4 years of screening there were four infants with both parents of AA descent.",

Then after varying time intervals, the mucosal and serosal media were removed and retained, while the cell sheets were briefly rinsed in ice-cold PBS and lysed. In all cases the [ 3 H]INO-4995 space of the cells (in \u00b5l/cell sheet) exceeded the [ 14 C]mannitol space indicating intracellular uptake of [ 3 H]INO-4995. From the transepithelial fluxes of tracers, we estimated that the transepithelial permeabilities to [ 3 H]INO-4995 and [ 14 C]mannitol were similar at~10 -6 cm.sec-1 indicating that negligible quantities of [ 3 H]INO-4995 cross the epithelial sheets. The intracellular uptake was comparable in mucus-free and control cells indicating that mucus did not impede the uptake of [ 3 H]INO-4995. Taken together these data favor delivery of INO-4995 in an aerosol format to selectively target airway epithelia.

In contrast, the numbers receiving tobramycin were similar (5/24 cases & 8/28 controls) (p=0.0012). The median lifetime exposure to aminoglycosides amongst the cases was 11 courses (range 0-72) vs. a median of 2 courses (range 0-26) in the control group. The odds ratio for ARF was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00 to1.35)  per aminoglycoside course (p=0.04). Conclusions: Cumulative, lifetime aminoglycoside exposure increases the risk of CF patients developing ARF. Where patients develop this complication, it is commonly associated with recent or current aminoglycoside administration, particularly gentamicin.

Northeastern Ontario Cystic Fibrosis  Program, Sudbury Regional Hospital, Sudbury, ON, Canada    Introduction and Specific Objective In 2003, the Northeastern Ontario Cystic Fibrosis Clinic in Sudbury Ontario Canada began changing the way it provided care at their CF clinics. One paediatrician's clinic went from the traditional model of patients and families meeting team members individually on clinic day, to the child and family meeting with the team together on clinic day. CF team members included in the group model were: clinic nurse, paediatrician, social worker, physiotherapist and dietician. We describe our model of care as a round table format or arena format. Since 2004 both our paediatricians participate in the round table format. Given that our model is very unique for a CF Clinic, we want to measure our patients/families level of satisfaction with the current model and see if we have achieved our anticipated outcomes.Anticipated outcomes In changing the model, we hoped to achieve a number of outcomes: -Reducing the time spent at clinic, especially for the families who travel long distances -Reducing the duplication of questions for the child and the family by various team members -Team problem-solving around various issues like adherence, transitions, school -Improving team functioning (better communication, better understanding of roles) -Eliminating the need for rounds following clinic -Team members seeing all children/families at all clinics. Method We originally measured patient satisfaction with the new model in 2004, with the 2 groups: one group attending the round table format and the other group seeing the team members separately. The second paediatrician started with the round table model in late 2004.This year, we are again measuring patient and family satisfaction with the round table model, which is used in all of our paediatric clinics.",

Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA; 3. Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciences,Sahlgrenska Academy, G\u00f6teborg University, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden Background: Children with CF & pancreatic insufficiency (PI) are at risk for fatty acid (FA) abnormalities & essential FA deficiency. Improved EFA status has been associated with increased energy and linoleic acid (LA) intake. However, the association of fat intake type (saturated [SFA], monounsaturated [MUFA], polyunsaturated fat [PUFA]) and serum FA has not been well studied.Objective: To determine if the type of dietary fat intake (SFA, MUFA, PUFA), LA or \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) is associated with serum LA, docasahexaenoic acid (DHA), and triene:tetrane(T:T, eicosatrienoic acid:arachidonic acid) in children with CF & PI.Design and Methods: Serum FA was assessed at the 12 month visit in preadolescent children with CF & PI enrolled in a longitudinal study of growth, nutritional & pulmonary status. Serum FA status was assessed by capillary gas liquid chromatography (mol%), dietary intake by 7-day weighed food records, coefficient of fat absorption (%COA) from 3-day stool collection, total energy intake as percent estimated energy requirement (%EER) for active children, and fat intake types (SFA, MUFA, PUFA, LA and ALA) as %kcal, and LA & ALA intake as %Adequate Intake (%AI).Linear regression models with type of fat intake predicting serum LA, DHA, & T:T were performed.Results: 65 subjects with CF & PI (8.4 \u00b1 1.0 years, n= 32 females) were included: %COA was 85+10% and %EER was 112+21%. Total fat intake was 37\u00b15%, SFA 15\u00b13%, MUFA 14\u00b12% and PUFA 6\u00b12% of total energy intake. LA and ALA intake was 5.5\u00b11.5 and 0.5\u00b10.2 %kcals, and 125\u00b142 and 130\u00b144 %AI, respectively. R 2 values from multiple regression analyses with type of fat intake predicting serum FA status are presented. Adjusted for age, gender, %EER and %COA, intake of MUFA, PUFA, LA & ALA but not SFA positively predicts serum LA. LA intake negatively predicts T:T, and ALA intake positively predicts serum DHA.Conclusions: Increased dietary intake of MUFAs & PUFAs may improve serum FA status. In addition to CF recommendations for increasing energy & total fat intake, closer attention to type of dietary fat intake may be indicated for children with CF & PI to optimize FA status.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, MD, USA Significance: Significant improvements have been made in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CF patients in recent decades. We hypothesized that these changes could potentially impact CF respiratory microbiology. Thus, we examined longitudinal trends in the annual incidence and prevalence of CF respiratory pathogens from 1995 to 2005.Methods: CF Foundation Patient Registry data, estimated to include 90% of the CF population in the U.S., was utilized in this analysis. Patients were included if results from at least one respiratory culture were in the Registry from January 1995 to December 2005. Patients were excluded after organ transplantation. To avoid misclassification of incident cases, a retrospective review of Registry data from 1985 to 1994 was performed to establish the culture status of included patients prior to 1995. Thus, incident cases were subjects with first detection of a given pathogen in a given year. Prevalent cases were defined as subjects with at least one positive respiratory culture for a given pathogen in a given year. All submitted culture results were included.Results: The number of CF patients submitting Registry data increased from 19,735 in 1995 to 23,347 in 2005 . The proportion of subjects meeting inclusion criteria remained relatively constant (85% to 91% per year). The median age of the study cohort increased from 13.1 years in 1995 to 15.1 years in 2005. During the study period, the incidence of Hemophilus influenzae remained stable (10.3% to 10.6%) as did the prevalence (15.3% to 17.3%). The incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 20.8% in 1996 to a peak of 24.2% in 2004. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa declined from 60.4% in 1995 to 56.1% in 2005. There is a trend for both an increasing incidence and prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus; the incidence increased from 21.7% in 1995 to 33.2% in 2005 and the prevalence increased from 37.0% in 1995 to 52.4% in 2005. The age specific prevalence of S. aureus remained highest in children aged 6-17 years. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) increased from 0.1% in 1995 to 7.0% in 2005, with a parallel increase in prevalence from 0.1% to 17.2%. The highest prevalence of MRSA was noted in subjects 18 years of age and older. The incidence of Burkholderia cepacia complex decreased from 1.3% in 1995 to 0.9% in 2005, while the prevalence remained relatively stable (range 2.9% to 3.6%). Both the incidence and prevalence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia increased (incidence: 2.6% to 6.4%, prevalence: 3.5% to 12.4%).This retrospective study aims at assessing the respiratory function and the cystic fibrosis (CF) co-morbid conditions according to the patients' nutritional status.Method: data were collected from the French Observatory (ONM) 2004 (n=4533) (VLM, INED). The last year data for weight (W), height (H), FEV1, FVC were extracted from the database (exclusion criteria: transplan-tation); were also analysed the genotype, pancreatic enzymes consumption, pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization, cirrhosis, diabetes, pulmonary transplantation and mortality (SAS 9.1). We used international age-adjusted standards for BMI z-score for children (C) and BMI for adults (over 18 years) (A) (Cole TJ BMJ 2000) to define underW (UW), normal W (NW), overW (OW) and obesity (OB) .Results: data are available for 2647 patients in the C cohort and for 1498 patients in the A cohort (36 %). Nutritional status subgroups prevalence (%) is: 6.1, 87.1, 5.6 and 1.2 in C and 37.3, 57.7, 4. 3 and 0.7 in A for respectively UW, NW, OW and OB. Mean age in A is significantly increasing with BMI (p<.0001). Frequency of 508 del/508 del in C and A is lower in OW/OB (p<.02) as well as the use of pancreatic enzymes (p<.001). OW/OB patients have the best FEV1 and FVC values whatever the gender and the age, with significantly less PA colonization in A (p<.01). We could identify a positive correlation between the pulmonary function and BMI. The CF co-morbid conditions demonstrated a lower prevalence of diabetes (12/257) and cirrhosis (5/257) in OW/OB. None of the OW/OB C or A are on a transplant waiting list versus 1.7 % in UW/NW (n=69/4042) and none died versus 1 % in UW/NW (n=42/4042).Conclusion: The observed prevalence of OW and OB in CF is respectively 5.2 and 1 % whereas the French ObEpi 2006 study collected 29 and 12 %. Our results suggest that increased BMI is associated with better FEV1, FVC, lower prevalence of PA, cirrhosis and diabetes. The potential risks of chronically high BMI have not been studied in this population yet, but justify further investigations in this longer life expectancy cohort. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively identified abdominal CT scans of 38 consecutive patients (19 females, 19 males, mean age of 28 years) with cystic fibrosis and a control group of 38 consecutive patients (21 females, 17 males, mean age of 40 years) scanned as potential renal donors. Three readers reviewed all scans and recorded the presence and location of colonic wall redundancy, and the wall thickness of the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. Clinical information on cystic fibrosis patients, including CFTR gene mutations, was queried from our cystic fibrosis patient registry database. Additionally, medical records of all cystic fibrosis patients were reviewed to determine the indication for abdominal CT.",

            "text": "Results: Colonic wall redundancy was seen exclusively in patients with cystic fibrosis, and was noted in 11 of 38 patients each for reviewers 1, 2, and 3 (p<0.05). Colonic wall redundancy was seen in 11 of 28 adult patients with cystic fibrosis (39%), but was not seen in any children age 17 or younger (p<0.05). Excellent agreement was found for the CT identification of colonic wall redundancy among readers (kappa=0.91, p<0.001). Cystic fibrosis patients with colonic wall redundancy had significantly thicker ascending colonic walls (mean 4.0 mm) vs. those without wall redundancy (mean 1.8 mm) or controls (mean 1.2 mm), (p=0.03). Three patients with colonic wall redundancy had follow-up CT, and all showed temporal stability (mean of 50 months). Among adult cystic fibrosis patients, CFTR gene mutations were available for 10 of 11 patients with and 13 of 17 without colonic wall redundancy. While the common \u2206F508 mutation was the predominant mutant allele among patients with normal colons at CT (only 3 of 17 patients, or 23%, had an identified mutation other than \u2206F508 on either allele), a higher prevalence of less common non-\u2206F508 mutations was seen patients with colonic wall redundancy (7 of 10 patients, or 70%, p<0.05). The G542X mutation was seen exclusively in patients with colonic wall redundancy (3 of 10 patients, or 30%, p=0.06). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with abdominal pain (>0.7), pancreatic insufficiency (p>0.99), diabetes mellitus (p>0.1), history of meconium ileus Background: Airway inflammation in CF is associated with marked remodelling and bronchiectasis. Pro-inflammatory mediators such as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and the soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE) may perpetuate this response in the lung and in other organs such as the kidney 1 . The total body burden of AGEs reflects exogenous sources from the diet, endogenous production by the body, tissue degradation and renal clearance, which may be reduced in renal impairment. The accumulation of endogenous AGE is accelerated in conditions of high oxidative stress and inflammation, and AGEs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. The burden and significance of AGEs in CF has not been determined, but if elevated, dietary modification of AGEs may represent a novel anti-inflammatory approach for CF. The aim of this study was to determine serum levels of AGE and sRAGE, and identify clinical correlates of AGE and sRAGE levels.Methods: Adults with CF (n=58, 35 males, 86% pancreatic insufficient, mean age 33.9\u00b17.7 years (range 23 to 62 years), mean FEV 1 %predicted 58.7\u00b122.6%predicted (range 20-110)) and healthy adults (n=24, 13 male, mean age 32.7\u00b19.2 years (range 21-55 years)) were studied. CF participants provided 1-3 serum samples each over a six month period, while healthy controls provided a single sample. Serum was analysed for levels of advanced glycation end-product (AGE-CML) and soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE) (ELISA). For each CF participant, levels in the multiple samples were averaged, and the median for the study sample reported. Clinical data, including BMI, presence of CF-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD) and serum HbA1c level were collected from the medical record. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare CF and control levels, while Spearman rank correlations were used to identify clinical correlates of AGE and sRAGE.Results: Prevalence of CFRD was 27.6%. Mean BMI was 21.8\u00b12.7kg/m 2 and mean HbA1c level was 5.9\u00b11.1%. Median (IQR) levels for AGE-CML were 1650 (1158, 1986) BACKGROUND: Osteopenia is diagnosed in cystic fibrosis (CF) using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Areal BMD from DXA is subject to error when bones are smaller in volume than reference standards (T-scores). Normalization of bone size by use of Zscores in CF is controversial and not widely utilized, thus comparing to larger bone areas. Reports in CFTR-deficient mice (CF mice) reveal osteopenia when measured by DXA. We hypothesized that use of pQCT, which eliminates bias of size, would more accurately analyze BMD.METHODS: Femurs were collected at necropsy from 4 CF mice and 4 C57BL/6J (B6) mice at 6 wks, and 7 CF mice and 7 B6 mice at 14 wks (all female) for pQCT. Time points were chosen to coincide with pre-pubertal and adult ages for comparison to human disease. Total mineral, trabecular and cortical densities were measured. Student's t-test was used to detect significant differences (p<0.05).RESULTS: Femur measurements from both CF mice and B6 mice are listed as mean \u00b1 SD in the table (below). Length was greater in B6 mice compared to CF mice at 6 and 14 wks. Total area at the metaphysis and diaphysis were greater in B6 mice at 6 and 14 wks. Data are consistent with larger bones in B6 mice. Total mineral density 1 , trabecular density 2 and cortical density 3 , however, were greater in CF mice compared to B6 ( 1 6 & 14 wks, 2 14 wks, 3 6 wks).DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates greater BMD in CF mice when volumetric data are analyzed and size differences are accounted for by use of pQCT. These findings persisted at adult age, suggesting a normal deposition of bone. In clinical management, DXA imaging is readily available compared to pQCT, and can be used as a predictor of BMD and fracture risk. Correct reference ranges must be utilized to minimize erroneous values secondary to size. Z-scores allow correction for differences in bone area and size, even in adults. More studies into understanding bone mineral deficit and tools of measurement are needed in CF. Meanwhile, bone measurements by radiographic imaging must be taken in context of overall health, pubertal progression, and size of individuals. Gainesville, FL, USA; 2. Nemours Children's Clinic, Orlando, FL, USA; 3. SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA; 4. Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA; 5. Genentech, San Fancisco, CA, USA Background: Greater growth rates, BMI and fat-free mass are associated with improved lung function in individuals with CF (Pedreira, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2005) . Current treatments for weight gain have focused on nutritional supplements and appetite stimulation, and not underlying issues of catabolism or chronic disease. We hypothesized that anabolic effects of GH would not only improve weight and height, but LBM as well.Methods: Sixty-seven prepubertal children with CF and height less than or equal to the 10th percentile were randomized to daily GH (n=35) or observation (n=32) for a period of 1 year, followed by an off-treatment observation period of 6 months. Children randomized to GH received somatropin injections daily at 0.3 mg/kg/wk. Height and weight were measured every three months. Height was evaluated as height standard deviation score (SDS) to control for differences in age and sex. LBM was measured by DEXA scan at time zero, at 6 and 12 months, and at the end of the 6-month observation period. In addition, for LBM, change from baseline was calculated for subjects for whom the same DEXA equipment was used at both time points. The preliminary results of the first 12 months of the study are presented here.Results: Data for 27 subjects in the observation arm and 29 subjects in the GH arm, who completed 12 months, are available. As shown in the table below (listed as mean \u00b1 SD), gain in height, weight and LBM were significantly greater in the GH treated group than in the observation group over the 12 month period.Discussion: GH improves growth in prepubertal children with CF as measured by height SDS. In addition, GH significantly improves weight gain and this gain is, in part a result of the significantly greater increase in LBM in the GH-treated group than in the observation group. The relationship between the improvement in LBM and other outcomes in CF deserves further exploration. The National Cystic Fibrosis(CF) Registry Database notes Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Mellitus(CFRD) as a complication in 15.6% of CF patients at all ages. CFRD is associated with poorer nutrition and increased pulmonary morbidity. The cause of CFRD is not completely known but insulin resistance may be associated with fibrotic damage to pancreatic islet cells due to chronic inflammation. Other studies suggest protein energy malnutrition(PEM) in early life leads to impairment of insulin secretion and Cystic Fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) accounts for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CF and occurs in approximately 30% of patients by the age of 30 years. CFRD NET (Network for Epidemiology and Trials) is a consortium of four large UK CF centres caring for 1052 adult patients with CF. The aim of this group is to undertake research into the diagnosis, investigation and management of CFRD. In this abstract, we estimate the prevalence of diabetes in a screened population of adults with CF.",

            "text": "A total of 78 patients (male/female: 44/34) including 10 post transplant patients were screened. Mean age was 33.1 years (17-52), mean HbA1c 8.0% (5.6-16.2% ) and average duration of diabetes was 7.3 years (<1-38 years).As immunosuppressive therapy can also cause many of the complications associated with diabetes the results are presented separately for nontransplant and post transplant patients (table 1) . 9 patients in total had retinopathy: 7 background retinopathy,1 proliferative retinopathy undergoing laser therapy and 1 maculopathy. The average duration of diabetes in those with background retinopathy was 5.8 years with only 1 patient having diabetes for >10 years. The patient with proliferative retinopathy (non-transplant) had been diabetic for 15 years. A raised creatinine level was identified in all transplanted patients with microalbuminuria but none of the non-transplanted patients. 1 patient (nontransplant) had macroalbuminuria. 2 post transplant patients were on treatment for hypertension and a further 6 patients (2 post transplant and 4 nontransplant) had elevated blood pressure (>140/90) at screening requiring follow-up. None of the patients had evidence of cardiovascular disease or stroke.Conclusion: Macrovascular complications were not seen. Microvascular complications occurred but were less common than the reported incidence in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This may reflect the relatively short duration of diabetes (mean 7.8 years) of patients in this study. A further study comparing CFRD patients with a non-CF diabetic control group of similar duration of diabetes is warranted. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that leads to serious disturbances in nutritional status and bone calcification. Comparison of two methods for assessment of bone mineralization: DEXA and hand radiograms in diagnosing osteopenia or osteoporosis. Study was performed in a group of 26 CF patients (10F, 16M), aged 7-30 yrs. Nutritional status was assessed using BMI, Cole's Index and BMC. Radiograms of non-dominant hand were assessed according to normalized optical density comparing to aluminum standard. Bone density was also assessed using DEXA. For statistical analysis, backward stepwise binary logistic regression (Wald's test) was used. Analysis of data revealed that using BMC, Cole's index and hand radiograms markers we can diagnose bone mass disturbances (Z score <1SD) with precision up to 84.62% comparing to DEXA. Sensitivity and specificity of this method was respectively 86.67% and 81.82%. False negative results were obtained in 2 patients and false positive were also in 2 patients. Hand radiograms method could be an alternative for DEXA in screening of bone density disturbances in CF patients. The study was partly supported by grant of Ministry of Science and Higher Education no 2 P05E 041 28.In a very recent publication(1) a high rate of fasting (13%) and reactive hypoglycaemia (15%) was described in a group of n=129 CF patients older than 8 years who received an oral glucose tolerance test. Reactive hypoglycaemia was related to the 120minute glucose concentration in the OGT test. We were surprised by the high percentage of asymptomatic hypoglycaemic situations in CF patients. As a part of a prospective intervention study in CF patients with CFRD, we screened more than 1400 patients 10 years or older with CF for CFRD. In this multi-centres population OGT was performed in the morning after overnight fasting according to WHO standards. Using the same definition for fasting hypoglycaemia (glucose < 60mg/dl; 3.3mmol/l) and reactive hypoglycaemia (glucose < 50mg/dl; 2.8mmol/l at 120minute during OGT test)as in the other study we calculated the percentage of CF patients with fasting or reactive hypoglycaemia in our cohort. Results: OGT were done in 1495 patients with CF. Age(mean\u00b1SD)19,6\u00b18,6 years; BMI Z-score -0.73\u00b11,1;height Z-score -0,8\u00b11,1 and weight Z-score -1,0\u00b11,3. OGT was categorised according to ADA criteria. Normal OGT (n=782 all ; fasting hypoglycaemia (FH) n=21(2,7%), reactive hypoglycaemia (RH)n=18 (2,3%),IFG (n=329 all, FH n=0, RH n=5 (1,5%), IGT(n=131,FH n=2(1,5%), RH n=0),FGT (n=75 all, FH n=0,RH n=0) and Diabetes Mellitus (n=187 all, FH n=3(1,7%)). FH was observed in 26 (1,7%) and RH in 23(1,5%) out of 1495 OGT tests. There were no difference related to age, BMI Z-score, height Z-score and weight Z-score comparing those patients with FH or RH to those without FH or RH in all categories of OGT tests.In this large multi-centres cohort of CF patients we were neither able to confirm the high percentage of fasting nor of reactive asymptomatic hypoglycaemia which was reported recently on a small group of CF patients. Nutritional status measured by BMI Z-scores, height and weight Z-scores were unaffected by hypoglycaemia in our cohort as noticed also in the small group. As the OGT tests in the other study were done in a single centre it might by that a centre specific situation influenced the frequency of hypoglycaemia in that small group. We conclude that large numbers of investigations might be needed to come up with firm conclusions related to frequency of specific aspects of glucose disturbance in CF patients.FH does not exclude Diabetes Mellitus or IGT. As survival from CF improves, surveillance to identify and treat complications associated with longevity is an important component of management. Renal disease has been reported in adults with CF. Risk factors may include CF-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD) and use of nephrotoxic medications. Diabetic nephropathy has been observed in the absence of CFRD 1 , highlighting the need for screening for renal impairment. This study aimed to measure renal function in a sample of adults with CF, and to compare estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary creatinine clearance (UrCrCl) as markers of renal function.Methods: Adults with CF aged 25 years or over (n=29, 66% male, 83% pancreatic insufficient, mean age 36.7\u00b19.1 years) underwent screening for renal impairment. Of these patients, 15 (9 males) had CFRD, and 14 (10 males) had no history or clinical features of CFRD. 24 hour urine collections were analysed for UrCrCl, with renal impairment being defined as <90ml/min. Serum creatinine level was used to calculate eGFR (MDRD formula), which was classified renal function as normal or mildly impaired (>60ml/min); moderately impaired (30-59 ml/min) or severely impaired (<30ml/min). Sensitivity of eGFR for identification of renal function was calculated using urinary creatinine clearance as the reference method. Unpaired t-tests were used to compared CFRD with non-CFRD patients.Results: Mean UrCrCl was 105\u00b135ml/min, and 8 eight patients (27.6%) had renal impairment (<90ml/min). Of these, only 3 had eGFR suggestive of renal impairment. The sensitivity of eGFR for identifying renal impairment in this sample was 38%. A further 2 patients had moderately impaired eGFR, but normal UrCrCL. Five of the 8 patients with impaired UrCrCl had CFRD. Age, gender, CFRD, FEV 1 %predicted and HbA1c level did not correlate with UrCrCl. The table compares CFRD patients with non-CFRD patients. HbA1c level was higher in CFRD patients. There were no other significant differences in clinical or renal function parameters.Conclusion: Renal impairment, is common in the adult CF population and is not confined to patients with CFRD. Screening using eGFR is poorly predictive of impaired UrCrCl in this population. These results suggest that surveillance to monitor renal function is indicated in the adult CF population, including in patients without CFRD, and that determination of UrCrCl should be included in the screening process. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer from pancreatic insufficiency resulting in malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins including vitamin D. Many fac-tors contribute to low bone mass and fractures in patients with CF; however, chronic vitamin D deficiency plays a major role. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported as high as 81% in some specialized care centers. In addition, reports of occult vertebral fractures have been reported as high as 25%. We sought to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 30 ng/ml) and of vertebral fractures at our CF center. We obtained IRB approval to review the records of all patients seen at our CF center during [2004] [2005] . We collected information related to bone health including 25(OH)D, bone mineral density and lateral spine or chest x-rays to examine for the presence of a vertebral fracture. We reviewed the records of 185 subjects who were seen at our center during the study period. The mean age of the subjects was 29 \u00b1 9 years. Subjects had a mean BMI of 21.2 \u00b1 3 and an FEV1% Predicted of 64.4 \u00b1 25%. The percentage of subjects having an annual 25(OH)D level checked was only 57% and 62% in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The mean 25(OH)D was 22.7 \u00b1 10 and 24.9 \u00b1 10 ng/ml in 2004 and 2005. The prevalence of vitamin deficiency was 78% and 73% in 2004 and 2005. About one quarter of the subjects had bone mineral density testing with half of the tests showing osteopenia or osteoporosis. Twenty-seven percent of subjects had vertebral abnormalites detected on lateral chest x-ray. We sought to determine whether any factors were associated with vitamin D deficiency. We found that taking a multivitamin did not significantly protect against vitamin D deficiency. However, not taking a supplement containing vitamin D other than a multivitamin was associated with a 54% risk of vitamin D deficiency (p=0.04). Subjects having 25(OH)D levels determined in the winter or spring was associated with a 30% risk of vitamin D deficiency (p=0.05). In summary, we found annual testing for vitamin D status was inadequate in our CF center and that when 25(OH)D level was determined, over 70% of subjects were vitamin D deficient. Nearly one quarter of our adult patients already had evidence of vertebral compression fracture seen in lateral chest x-ray. We urge greater screening for vitamin D deficiency in the CF population. Effective protocols to prevent and/or treat vitamin D deficiency are urgently needed in the CF population. Improved vitamin D status in CF patients is one factor that may reduce the high prevalence of vetebral fractures.

As a result, the recommended daily treatment regimens for most CF adults are both complex and time consuming.

Forty-eight percent reported using 5 or more different inhaled therapies or using inhaled therapies 5 or more times during that one day. The most commonly reported inhaled therapies were a bronchodilator (61%), Pulmozyme (49%), an inhaled steroid (32%), hypertonic saline (30%), and Objective: Caring for a child with CF is stressful and often leads to adverse effects for both children and caregivers. Support from family and friends can help reduce the adverse effects of chronic stress, however, there is little research documenting types of support provision as well as sources of support. Moreover, social support may be related to important health outcomes. This study described the types of support provided to caregivers of children with CF and examined relationships between support and health outcomes.Method: As part of a larger intervention study to improve adherence to medical regimens, 89 children with CF ages 1 to 11 and their caregivers were enrolled across 3 CF Centers in Florida: University of Florida, Nemours Children's Clinic, and All Children's Hospital. Caregivers completed the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ; Norbeck, 1980) in addition to other measures at Baseline and Follow Up. This questionnaire provides information about the number and type of people providing support, as well as its type and quality.Results: Caregivers received the majority of support from their families, spouses and friends and characterized these relationships as longer in duration, with more frequent provision of support. Other individuals who provided support included the CF team, religious leaders, counselors or psychologists, and work associates. Overall, caregivers rated family members and spouses as providing the greatest amount (i.e., \"quite a bit\") of emotional support. Spouses received the highest ratings for tangible support; they were perceived as providing \"quite a bit\" of support in comparison to families (i.e., moderate) and friends (i.e., a little). In terms of size of the support network, caregivers in this study had similar networks to those of a normative sample of healthy adults. In addition, there was no difference in amount of emotional or tangible support received by these caregivers. Preliminary baseline results indicated that social support was positively related to both adherence, children's growth (i.e., height and weight percentile), and family income.Discussion: Caregivers of young children with CF reported similar support networks as other healthy adults. However, there was variability in the amount of support provided by source, with spouses providing the greatest amount. Social support appeared to be a protective factor, and lack of support was related to negative health consequences for their children. More attention should be focused on the potentially beneficial effects of social support.Funding was provided by NIH grant #69736",

Mathematics and Statistics, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, United Kingdom; 7. Psychiatry, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: Existing treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF) are time-consuming and labour intensive and biomedical advances are likely to lead to further novel interventions. There is concern amongst clinicians that a high care burden associated with these interventions may compromise the wellbeing of caregivers, reduce adherence to the treatment protocol and increase the likelihood of inadvertent errors in the delivery of interventions. At present, there is no measure of 'treatment burden' and therefore no way to assess the impact of new and increasingly more complex interventions conducted by lay caregivers at home. Furthermore, trials are hampered by the lack of measurable patient-reported outcomes beyond a broad quality of life assessment. To address this gap we have developed a measure of treatment burden for CF using qualitative methods (focus groups, action research, in-depth interviews) with participating parents and a working group of CF team professional staff. This measure addresses the time, effort, meaning and ease of management for caregivers of children with CF up to 13 years and post the first year following a diagnosis. Methods: We report here the pilot phase of the validation of this instrument, which involved (i) cognitive interviewing with n=16 caregivers; and, (ii) n=30 caregivers completing the CLCF instrument together with a quality of life measure at 2 time points. This yielded data for stability, reliability and coherence of the hypothesized constructs. Results: The CLCF takes 15 minutes to complete. Face validity and acceptability are established. For the first pilot sample the age of the child ranged from 1.5-11.5 years. Treatments took, on average 72 minutes per day to complete and an average of 16 minutes of this was devoted to administering enzymes particularly for carers of infants. A prominent concern amongst these parents was their child's height and weight and their efforts were directed at optimising growth. For the child however, management of nebulised medications and physiotherapy were more frequently flagged as a concern. These data suggest this is a reliable, coherent and useful, although complex tool. Conclusion: The caregiver challenge for CF cannot be understood simply in terms of time and effort involved in delivery of treatments. It also involves contextualising interventions for their meaning at multiple levels of explanation for the individual concerned. Structural equation modelling would be an appropriate way to proceed with the main validation when such complex relationships occur between latent variables and would serve as a confirmatory factor analysis for the hypothesised relationships.

            "text": "Funded by: National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit Programme.Introduction: The French CF practice recommendations, published at the end of 2002 in parallel with the creation of CF reference centres, advise that each patient should be seen at least every 3 months at a cystic fibrosis reference centre.Objective: To investigate the impact of these recommendations on the effectiveness of the follow-up of patients at the four reference centres in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region.Methods: All patients with cystic fibrosis attending one of the four CF centres between 1996 and 2005 were retrospectively included. The total number of visits was recorded for each patient and each year of the study period. To determine the evolution slope for each patient followed for at least 3 years, a negative binomial regression of number of visits versus time was carried out (confirmed with a repeated model). To estimate the impact of the recommendations, the analysis was restricted to patients with at least two visits before and after 2003 and a second model was adjusted with a new intercept in 2003 to estimate the change in slope as of this point.Results: A total of 650 patients were included in the cohort. The average number of visits per patient rose from 3.68 in 1996 to 4.96 in 2005 (p<0.0001). The proportion of patients with at least 4 visits per year increased from 38% to 70%. The negative binomial regression for the 537 patients having had at least 3 years follow-up confirmed this trend with an average slope of +0.07 (SD=0.18). A total of 352 patients were evaluable for the change in slope. No significant change in trend was observed in 2003: only 34% of patients had a higher rate of growth (this change was significant for only 7 subjects). At the last follow-up visit, patients with increasing rates of number of visits were older (21yrs vs. 17yrs, p<0.0001), had lower %FEV1 (68 vs. 75, p=0.02), had a similar average number of visits before 2003 (3.7 vs. 3.9, p=0.33), and a similar weight-for-age z-score (-0.58 vs. -0.46, p=0.50) .Conclusion: The number of visits per patient is regularly increasing. Since the publication of the practice recommendations in 2003, the growth has tended to slow down: clinicians were already convinced by the need for closer follow-up and had begun to increase the rate of visits. Methods: Patients > 13 years who presented for routine healthcare voluntarily completed four surveys: 1) the revised Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), validated for CF patients by Abbott and colleagues, where higher scores reflect worse attitudes towards eating; 2) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), where higher scores reflect better self-esteem; 3) the Body Image Scale (BIS), developed for CF patients by Wenninger and colleagues, where higher scores reflect better body image; 4) the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ), developed by Quittner and colleagues, where higher scores reflect better HRQOL. Also, FEV1%, body mass index (BMI), and pancreatic sufficiency or insufficiency (based on the need for pancreatic enzymes) was recorded. Regression analyses controlling for age, gender and BMI were used to examine the associations between the surveys.",

The EAT was negatively associated with the RSE (p=0.015, adjusted R 2 =0.127), BIS (p=0.001, adjusted R 2 =0.221) and CFQ (p=0.015, adjusted R 2 =0.122). The RSE was positively associated with the CFQ (p=0.001, adjusted R 2 =0.346). The BIS was positively associated with the RSE (p=0.001, adjusted R 2 =0.529) and CFQ (p=0.001, adjusted R 2 = 0.540). Neither BMI nor pancreatic function was associated with the surveys (p=NS). FEV1% was positively associated with the CFQ (p=0.028, adjusted R 2 =0.106) but was not associated with the other surveys.Conclusions: More negative attitudes towards eating predict worse selfesteem and body image, while more positive body image predicts better self-esteem. Also, attitudes towards eating, self-esteem and body image are significant predictors of HRQOL with body image being the most important predictor.Clinical Importance: HRQOL is an important clinical outcome measure in CF. Clinicians need to be sensitive to attitudes towards eating, self-esteem and body image in CF patients, because they are important predictors of HRQOL.",

Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA BACKGROUND: Existing research suggests that self-reported adherence to all aspects of the regimen is likely suboptimal and objective measures suggest even poorer adherence. There is little empirical data on how much adherence is necessary to achieve desired health outcomes. Moreover, there is limited data on how adherence changes dur-Objective: CF may be associated with pain attributed to several etiologies. This study evaluates the prevalence of pain symptoms in adult CF patients and the influence on patients` lives.Methods: 243 patients of 6 adult CF Centers in Germany completed a validated, self report questionnaire during a routine clinic visit assessing characteristics of chronic pain (prevalence, duration, location, quality and intensity of pain symptoms). Furthermore, the impact of pain on different aspects of life was explored using a numeric scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst. Every-day-life was divided into 8 categories: duties at home, recreation, social activities, occupation, sexual life, autonomy, vital activities and CF-therapy. The average intensity of pain within the last 4 weeks was correlated to FEV1, BMI and age.Results: 243 patients (119 male) completed the questionnaire. The age was 18-65 years (mean 28.13\u00b18.13). 182 patients (75%) aged 18-65 years (mean 28.51\u00b18.23)reported pain within the last 3 months. BMI was 14.7-38.3 kg/m2 (mean 20.4\u00b13.1), FEV1 12-142% (mean 54.7\u00b124.5). If asked for pain within the last 4 weeks 174 (72%) reported painful episodes lasting from 1-28 days with a mean of 9.8 days (\u00b17.8). Most patients described pain occurring at more than one site with the head being the most localized site, followed by chest and abdomen. Concerning the quality of pain 85.4% characterized their pain episodes as attacks whereas 8.8% reported them as continious, 5.8% had continious pain combined with pain attacks. 179 patients desribed the intensity of pain as 5.77 (\u00b12.35) on a scale from 0 to 10 with 10 being the most severe pain. The category of life negatively influenced most of all by pain episodes was recreation, followed by occupation and duties at home. Female patients were more limited in their acitivites by pain symptoms than male patients with the highest difference being reported in sexual life. There was no correlation of the average intensity of pain within the last 4 weeks to FEV1, BMI or age.Conclusion: The prelevance of pain in CF is often underestimated. Painful episodes can be the cause of worsening the quality of life for adult CF patients. Assessment of pain should be routinely performed as part of care in CF Centers. Objective. Sleep has been examined in a number of pediatric conditions, with impaired sleep resulting in worse neurobehavioral functioning (Beebe, 2005) . Recent research has shown that slow wave sleep is critical for memory (Marshall, Helgadottir, Molle, & Born, 2006) . To the authors' knowledge, no studies have examined slow wave and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. Methods. Retrospective medical record review revealed two patients who underwent clinically indicated polysomnography (PSG) who reported feeling tired and lacking energy. Patients were females with cystic fibrosis, ages 12 and 14 years. Results. PSG revealed an increase in stage 2 sleep for both patients, resulting in increased risk and observed hypopneic episodes. Patient -A experienced 16.3% in stage 1, 65.6% in stage 2, and 0% in stages 3 and 4 combined. This patient also had no REM sleep. Patient -B experienced 12% in stage 1, 67.8% in stage 2, and 10% in delta wave sleep, with no REM sleep. Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) for patients A and B were calculated at 3.6 and 3.5, respectively. Respiratory Effort Related Arousal (RERA) contributed to RDI by 1.9 and 1.1 points in patients A and B, respectively. In addition, endtidal CO2 for patient A and B were maxed at 50 mm Hg and 48 mmHg, respectively. Their Epworth sleepiness scales were scored at 8 and 10 for patients A and B, respectively. Conclusions. Structure of sleep was abnormal in both patients with decreased slow wave (Delta) sleep in patient B and lack of Delta sleep in patient A. Neither patient experienced REM sleep. Compensatory increased stage 2 (NREM) sleep could cause respiratory related abnormalities, such as hypopnea and apnea in patients with cystic fibrosis Background: Understanding and advancing the application of tools to measure patients' symptoms is critical to advancing our evaluation of potential new therapies used to treat CF. We performed initial evaluation of the measurement properties of a CF-specific respiratory symptom daily questionnaire.",

            "text": "Methods: We planned to enroll 60 CF subjects, stratified by age, at three CF programs, the University of Washington Medical Center and Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle and Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma in a prospective assessment of a novel CF specific respiratory questionnaire. CF subjects 2 years and older were eligible for enrollment. Patients (parents for children under the age of 12) completed a daily symptom questionnaire during two 7-day periods of clinical stability and one 7-day period when patients were ill for a total of 21 days. The ill state began when patients/parents sought medical attention for respiratory symptoms. The questionnaires were completed using a secure web-based application or via paper for those patients without access to the internet. Two health related quality of life measures (generic and CF specific) were completed by the subjects at the end of each 7-day period to assess the relationship between the novel questionnaire and health related quality of life. Patients also used pedometers during the well and ill states to assess relationship between symptoms and activity level.Results: 52 CF subjects have been enrolled to date. At the time of this interim analysis, 34 patients had completed 384 questionnaires. Of this total, only 2 individual questionnaire entries have been missed in 2 patients (<1% of possible questionnaires). Interim review of cross-sectional data suggests clear differences in symptom reporting between the ill and well periods. Examples include 46% (13/28) noted difficulty breathing and 32% (9/28) noted tightness in the chest in the preceding 24 hours during the initial well period compared to 70% (14/20) noting difficulty breathing and 70% (14/20) noting tightness in the chest during the ill period.Conclusions: Interim evaluation of this novel instrument demonstrates feasibility of deploying this instrument via the internet with an extremely high completion rate. Using a cross-sectional analysis, the instrument can discriminate between the ill and well state. Further data will be presented regarding within patient variability and discrimination of the instrument.Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Leroy Matthews Physician Scientist Award, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (HL72017-03), National Institute of Health (RR-00037-39), Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. Background: Improved communication in today's health care delivery system is a critically important aspect of patient care. Nurses are in an effective position to improve communication due to their close interaction with patients. As a result, they are able to identify potential problems, communicate them to the healthcare team and improve patient care and satisfaction.Hypothesis: Improving communication between the patient/family and the health care team will improve patient/family satisfaction.Method: As a member hospital partnering with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) initiative, Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB), The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) introduced the use of Daily Patient Goal Sheets (DPGS) as a vehicle to improve communication between members of the healthcare team, patients and families and the DPGS was refined to meet the needs of an inpatient medical unit to which CF patients are admitted. Using rapid Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, a multidisciplinary team engaged in small tests of change in different stages. Initially, patient goals and discharge criteria generated in daily rounds were posted in each room on easel paper. Then large \"whiteboards\" were placed in each patient room for documenting patient goals, discharge criteria, names of the care team members and questions from patients and families. As a final step in the process, we shifted the health care team rounds to the patient's bedside and implemented bedside shift to shift nurse report and safety checks. Patient satisfaction was continuously monitored over this process using the Press Ganey Survey.Results: Over an eight month period, the Press Ganey Survey results for the unit showed an average increase of 10%. We attribute this increase to better information sharing among patient, family and hospital staff regarding the plan of care for the patient's hospitalization. The health care team also had an improved dialog with the patients/families. Conclusion: Patient/family and healthcare team communication and satisfaction were improved using an organized and stepwise PDSA process to develop Daily Patient Goal Sheets on a medical unit. Background: The UAB/CHS pediatric CF center provides care for approximately 300 patients. The Pulmonary Division has 5 full-time RNs and 3 part-time RNs who rotate phone triage for all calls (including CF) of patients seen by the 9 faculty physicians. Historically, patient calls received during office hours are taken by the receptionist and put into the EMR, then returned by the RN on call. The RN contacts one of the staff MD's, gives report of the patient's condition,treatment orders are received, and the patient notified. There are several issues with this phone triage system, which include inconsistencies in RN and MD response as well as differences in documentation.",

            "text": "GLOBAL AIM: To improve the consistency among RNs in phone triage of sick CF patients.METHOD: An algorithm for pulmonary exacerbation phone triage was developed by the CF center director and lead RNs to improve consistency in symptom assessment and treatment plan. A specific list of systemic and pulmonary signs and symptoms was formed including length of illness. If three OBJECTIVE: Patients with CF often require intravenous antibiotics for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. Patients often receive peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines or totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) for venous access. Few studies have examined complications of TIVAD implantation and little published data exists concerning PICC line complications in CF patients. This study sought to assess the complication rates of both TIVAD and PICC lines as well as to identify possible risk factors for developing complications.METHODS: This retrospective study included patients from 3 CF centers in northern New England. Data was obtained from each patient's local medical record, Port CF, and patient interviews. Demographic data was recorded for all CF patients between 1/1/03-6/1/06. For each TIVAD or PICC line, the following information was recorded: type of line placed, history of prior line placement during the study period, patient age, history of use for blood draws, method of line flushing, and status of the line at the end of the study (if still in use). Complications were defined as catheter occlusion, vascular thrombosis/stenosis, infection, or other local inflammatory reactions.RESULTS: Data was collected for 237 pediatric and 155 adult CF patients during the defined study period. Seventy-three TIVADs and 356 PICC lines were placed during the study period in 205 patients. The TIVAD and PICC line complication rates were 33% (24/73) and 6.5% (23/356), respectively. In pediatric patients, 27% (6 of 22) TIVADs and 6.3% (13/205) PICC lines had a complication. Of the 6 TIVAD complications, three were systemic infections and three were catheter occlusions. Of the 13 PICC line complications, there were two venous thromboses, one line occlusion, two systemic infections, and nine minor incidents of localized phlebitis. In adults, complications were recorded in 35% (18/51) of TIVADs and 6.6% (10/151) of PICC lines. Of the 18 TIVAD complications, there were five systemic infections, seven catheter occlusions, and four venous thromboses. Of the 10 PICC line complications, there were three venous thromboses, three line occlusions, and four minor incidents of localized phlebitis. All adult patients who developed a deep venous thrombosis(DVT) associated with TIVAD implantation were homozygous for the deltaF508 mutation. The presence of diabetes or Burkholderia cepacia complex(BCC) lung infection was associated with DVT with odds ratios of 5.91 (95% CI 1.16-30.1) and 5.11 (95%CI 0.93-28.1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Complications of PICC lines were uncommon and usually minor. The rate of TIVAD complication observed was more common over the lifetime of the catheter and was similar to previously published reports. We identified potential risk factors for the development of DVT associated with TIVADs and PICC lines, specifically CF related diabetes, BCC infection, and homozygous deltaF508 genotype. The mechanism by which these factors are associated with catheter complications is unclear and warrants further investigation. ",
