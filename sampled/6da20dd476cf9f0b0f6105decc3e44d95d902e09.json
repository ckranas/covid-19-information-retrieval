It is well recognised that ward based early warning score systems can be used to predict outcome (1) . In 2007 the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended (2) that physiological scoring systems should include the following variables: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature (T), assessment of consciousness level (Alert, Verbal response, Pain response, Unresponsive -AVPU) and oxygen saturation (SpO2).

Rapid response systems (RRS) are developed as a tool to decrease the assistential gap between the acute critical patients in the wards and the advanced care avaliable just on critical care areas. Indeed, the RRS calls are usually made for all instable patients in the wards, independently of their resuscitation status. So, some calls are made for patients with do-not-attemp-reanimation (DNAR) orders, and others, have a DNAR order registred after the evaluation of the instability.

Changes in microcirculation and mitochondrial dysfunction appear to be key mechanisms in sepsis, since they can lead to regional mismatch of oxygen supply and demand. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) can be used to induce endotoxemia as a model of inflammation in humans, but the effects on microcirculatory perfusion have not been tested before.

Several authors have reported that there is no relation between systemic hemodynamics and microcirculation 1, 2 . These reports have focused on microvascular flow but not density.

Top 5 groups of drugs identified requiring intervention: Prophylactic Cardiac antibiotics, sedation and analgesia, Potassium chloride, dinoprostone and inotropes, and heparin. Interventions identified as effective: change in written guidelines for cardiac antibiotics, sedation and analgesia, dinoprostone and heparin. We have simplified guidelines (cardiac antibiotics, heparin and sedation/analgesia), and changed unit policy to use of standard concentrations of inotropes/prostin.

The influence of posture on regional perfusion was demonstrated, for our knowledge, for the first time in rodents. Qr was significantly decreased from dorsal to ventral regions in supine infused animals.

Patients were randomized within 48 hours after intubation to undergo CLRT in a specially designed bed allowing continuous rotation of the upper part of the body through an arc of 90\u00b0or to be treated in supine position. Rotation had to be performed for at least 18 hours per day. All patients were in a semirecumbent position of at least 30\u00b0. Suctioning and change of ventilator circuits were standardized. Sedation was allowed only if clinically indicated. All patients received enteral nutrition if possible. Endpoints of the study were spontaneous breathing, death, lack of tolerance, or development of pneumonia defined as newly acquired infiltrate in two consecutive chest x-rays plus signs of inflammation plus purulent bronchial secretions. CONCLUSION. CLRT is an effective prophylaxis for VAP. It exerts additive effects to other prophylactic measures like semirecumbent position and standardized ventilation and suctioning protocols. Lower VAP rate seems to result in shorter duration of ventilation and length of hospital stay. CLRT is not well tolerated in non-sedated patients during the weaning process.

Diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) maps the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) that characterises tissue water. Higher ADC values are associated with vasogenic edema, and lower ADC with cytotoxic oedema. DTI shows regional differences in contusions, with a central core and a surrounding region of vasogenic oedema. Many contusions also demonstrate a region of cytotoxic oedema, peripheral to the vasogenic oedema. We have used oxygen-15 positron emission tomography (15O PET) to characterise physiology in these brain regions in TBI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "Six patients (median GCS 5) who required sedation and mechanical ventilation for ICP control underwent DTI at 3Tesla, and 15O PET imaging studies within 24 hours post injury. Four regions of interest were manually drawn around the contusion in order to quantify cerebral physiology respectively in the core of the lesion (low ADC core) in the surrounding vasogenic oedema (high ADC region), in the adjacent rim of tissue with low ADC (cytotoxic edema) and on a control region (structurally normal appearing tissue). ADC maps were coregistered to PET images of cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in the four ROIs. CONCLUSION. These distinct patterns of physiology in contusions recapitulate a probable evolution of pathophysiology, with incorporation of the cytotoxic rim into the vasogenic oedema and, eventually into the contusion core. This mechanism may underlie the process of contusion expansion in TBI. The coexistence of low/normal OEF with cytotoxic oedema suggests that pericontusional ischemia may be microvascular in origin. INTRODUCTION. The optimal management of blood pressure in acute stroke remains poorly defined. Some studies note an association of poor outcome with patients with high BP on hospital admission. Others have noted a decreased risk of neurologic deterioration from stroke with higher BP and worse outcomes in patients who have a decrease in BP after admission. Therefore accurate measurement of blood pressure is crucial in the acute phase of stroke. Besides, the institution of suscessfuly treatments of blood pressure reduction or augmentation depends on it. Either non invasive or intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is commonly used in ICU. In different populations have been proved that non invasive method does not achieve right accuracy. In acute stroke population discrepancies between direct intraarterial blood pressure (IABP) and indirect blood pressure measurements (NIBP) can adversely affect therapeutic decisions and may have a negative impact on outcomes.

The reduction in mitochondrial enzyme activity described in critical illness [1] can be partly explained by decreased levels of expressed protein.

We previously demonstrated preserved ATP content and transcript levels for markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in patients who eventually survived, but depressed levels in eventual non-survivors [2] . A decreased ability to replace damaged mitochondrial proteins may contribute to ATP depletion and mortality. INTRODUCTION.

INTRODUCTION. The efferent vagus nerve can limit the inflammatory response via stimulation of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR). Nicotine, a nonselective alpha7nAChR agonist has been shown to inhibit cytokine release in human PBMCs and monocytes as well as in animal models of inflammation. Due to its lack of selectivity however, nicotine has many unwanted side effects. Therefore, selective targeting of the alpha7nAChR may be promising for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. We compared the effect of the selective alpha7nAChR agonist GTS-21 and nicotine on LPS-induced cytokine release in human blood cells. Furthermore, because pattern recognition of the diverse classes of microbial products causing infection involves various TLRs, we investigated whether the immunomodulating effect of alpha7nAChR stimulation is dependent on the TLR stimulated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 186, "text": "(Table)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 315, "end": 322, "text": "Figure)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 373, "end": 380, "text": "(Table)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "METHODS.

Production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was not inhibited but stimulated by GTS-21.

Selective stimulation of the alpha7nAChR by GTS-21 has a profound antiinflammatory effect by inhibiting pro-inflammatory and stimulating anti-inflammatory cytokine release.

The anti-inflammatory effect of alpha7nAChR stimulation was not restricted to a specific TLR. Therefore, this pathway appears to modulate the inflammatory response by a general mechanism. The lack of an effect of inhibition of the alpha7nAChR suggests that this receptor is not constitutively activated. Selective targeting of the alpha7nAChR using GTS-21 holds promise for future treatment options to modulate the innate immune response. INTRODUCTION. Aberrant regulation of innate immune responses and uncontrolled cytokine bursts are hallmarks of sepsis and endotoxemia. Activation of the liver X receptor (LXR) have been demonstrated to suppress inflammatory genes. Our group has recently proposed that LXR is a key regulator of cytokine release in LPS-challenged human monocytes, possibly by interfering with posttranscriptional events (Myhre, 2008).

The percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is a minimally invasive, safe, reliable and widely accepted procedure.

Immediate complications such as bleeding from the stoma, transient hypoxemia (SpO 2 \\ 95%) and hypercarbia ([ 5 mm increase in ETCO 2 from the baseline) were recorded. Bleeding was classified in four grades: I :\\5 mL, II : 6-10 mL, III : 11-20 mL and IV : [20 mL.

The procedure with Ultraperc \u00d2 single stage dilator technique took slightly longer time but had reduced amount of blood loss as compared to Griggs' dilating forceps technique. The incidence of hypoxemia and hypercarbia was higher with Ultraperc \u00d2 single stage dilator technique attributed to longer procedure time. PDT performed in selected patients by experienced and trained individuals is comparable in safety to that of surgical tracheostomy (ST)1. PDT is easier and quicker to perform with less periprocedural bleeding, is cost effective and is cosmetically more desirable than ST. However, it is associated with a 5-11% risk of complications, including catastrophic haemorrhage2, pneumothorax, surgical emphysema, misplacement, cartilage damage, and death2. Bleeding is the commonest complication associated with PDT. MRI assessment of cervical anatomy suggests considerable variation in the relation of blood vessels to the anterior aspect of the trachea3.

Ward patients can experience unexpected physiological deterioration that can lead to critical outcomes and death.

In many cases these physiological signs have been missed, neglected or poorly managed (1 2).

Proving effectiveness of these systems has been problematical, partly due to the reliance on a timely and robust system of observation monitoring, plus compliance by the ward teams in the referral process to response teams.

Extracorporeal CO2 removal is an effective technique to limit minute ventilation, thus allowing a protective ventilatory strategy even in the most severe ARDS patients. However, since CO2 is driven through the membrane lung only by the partial pressure of the dissolved CO2, which is less than 10% of the total CO2 content, extracorporeal blood flow as high as 2 liters/min are required to remove the total CO2 production of an adult patient. We hypothesized that acidification of the blood entering the ML could convert the CO2 contained in blood as bicarbonate ions to dissolved CO2, hence increasing the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). The consequent increase in CO2 transfer though the ML should allow for a reduction of extracorporeal blood flow.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "Six pigs (37\u00b12 Kg) were sedated, intubated, mechanically ventilated and connected to a veno-venous extracorporeal circuit comprising a ML (Quadrox D).

A continuous infusion of 0.5 N lactic acid was added to the extracorporeal blood flow before the ML at a rate of 1, 2 and 5 mEq/min for 15 minutes each. After each infusion we waited at least 30 minutes to allow the acid to be metabolized. Each infusion was repeated two times.

Blood free hemoglobin, a marker of hemolysis, was constantly within normal values. CONCLUSION. Blood acidification at the inlet of a ML, with infusion of 1, 2 and 5 mEq/ min of a lactic acid, can increase up to 70%, the CO2 removal capacity of the ML, allowing to remove the equivalent of 80% (173\u00b123 ml/min) of the total CO2 production of an adult man from as low as 500 ml of blood.

Several biological markers of lung injury are predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute lung injury (ALI). The low tidal volume lung-protective ventilation strategy is associated with a significant decrease in plasma biomarker levels compared to the high tidal volume ventilation strategy.

METHODS. 6 Patients were studied in the standard treated group and 6 in the group treated with the Vest\u00d2 System. Standard therapy consisted of manual hyperinflation with 100% oxygen 3 times a day with suctioning of the airways and exprimation. Patients received an external vest around the thorax. The external vest contained an air chamber which could be inflated with pulsatile oscillative flow. In this way external compressions were done during 20 minutes.

Pumpless arterio-venous interventional lung assist (iLA, Novalung, Hechingen, Germany) is used for extracorporeal gas exchange in severe ARDS. iLA is a single-used ultracompact gas exchange system perfused by the heart after arterial and venous cannulation. We report on a reduced complication and mortality rate using a new indication and implementation algorithm in comparison with a published cohort(1). RESULTS. Using a modified algorithm with prior stabilisation, smaller cannulae and improved technique, the incidence of complications and the mortality rate were significantly reduced, although the severity of disease (SOFA-score) was similar between the cohorts. iLA induced a marked CO2-removal allowing a lung protective ventilation (tidal volume \\ 6 ml/ kg). CO2 elimination with TGI is dependent on flow rate as fresh gas flushes higher proportion of proximal dead space. High flow rate causes tubulence at tip and increases distal gas mixing. The aim of present study is to confirm effect of TGI throughout the respiratory cycle on alveolar ventilation at various catheter flows and as an adjunct to protective lung ventilation for various pulmonary diseases. We measured effect of TGI on pH and PCO2 in cases of severe respiratory acidosis. METHODS. 20 patients (13 males and 7 females) with varied etiologies were studied. ALI/ ARDS(n= 9), Pneumonia with / without sepsis and MODS (n = 8), Post LVRS (n = 1), Post lobectomy (n=1), Disseminated CMV with MODS (n=1). All the patients were on protective lung ventilation strategies and had respiratory acidosis. The ventilatory parameters were Tidal volume 4-10 ml/Kg, FiO2: 0.4-1, PEEP : 5-15, RR: 12 -30/ min), Inspiration: Expiration (I:E) : 1:2 -1:4. c-TGI was given with a tool using infant feeding tube through a catheter mount and with a flow rate 4 -10 litres / min. Data collected were arterial blood gas (ABG) at 0, 1, 4 hour and at every 24 hours after establishing TGI. The following parameters in ABG were noted: pH, PaCO2, PaO2, HCO3 and compared. RESULTS.

We tested the German translation of the ,,Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU)'' [4] in a 20 bed surgical intensive care unit (ICU) for applicability, time-consumption, and compared clinical judgment of nurses to detect delirium with CAM-ICU assessment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 112, "end": 115, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 116, "end": 118, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 568, "end": 571, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION."}, {"text": "METHODS. Every patient admitted to our ICU in June 2007 was monitored for delirium with the CAM-ICU on a daily basis. (1) Nurses were interviewed for their delirium criteria, and they assessed their patients for delirium based on their clinical judgment. Patients with severe neurological impairment (stroke or dementia) and inability to understand German language were excluded. (2) To assess applicability of the CAM-ICU, nurses familiar with the CAM-ICU were stop watched when examining patients and interviewed for ease of use of each of the four CAM-ICU features. The reported incidence of delirium in non-comatose intensive care patients ranges from 19% to 80% 1,2 and has been associated with GABA agonist (propofol and benzodiezepine) use 3 . Delirious patients may not be agitated, so signs of delirium must be actively sought. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is a validated screening tool 4 . The aim of this study was to use the CAM-ICU in a 13 bed mixed surgical and medical ICU to determine the incidence of delirium and whether there was any correlation with sedative agent use. METHODS. JS and RT (trainee ICU doctors who had had a brief tutorial on CAM-ICU) reviewed each ICU patient daily and performed a CAM-ICU if assessable (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score more than minus 4 = rousable enough to assess). Sedative agents given in the preceding 24 hours were recorded. Statistical significance was determined with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS. 186 reviews of 45 patients were made over 6 weeks; in 117 of these (63%) the patients were rousable enough to perform a CAM-ICU. On 16 of the 117 CAM-ICU assessments (14%) the patients were delirious, and on 12 of these (75%) the delirium was of the hypoactive type (patient calm or drowsy). 11 of the 45 patients (24%) were delirious at least once. 7 out of 24 assessments (29%) on patients who had received a GABA agonist in the previous 24 hours were positive for delirium, compared to 7 out of 66 assessments (11%) on patients who had received no drug in the previous 24 hours (p=0.047), and 2 out of 27 assessments (7.4%) on patients who had received any sedation that did not include GABA agonists (p=0.066) in the previous 24 hours. RESULTS. 92 members responded, of whom 80% were senior medical staff, 50% of the respondents were Anaesthesiologists and 35% with ICU as their primary speciality. Around 90% of the respondents worked in the ICUs which admitted both medical and surgical patients. Only 50% of the respondents had a written protocol for sedation in their units and assessed sedation level every 4-6 hours. A sedation scoring system was used by 90% of the respondents, with Ramsay scoring being the most frequently used system (60%). 21% of the respondents use Bispectral monitor to assess the sedation level, of which 50% were Neurocritical care units. There were only 13% of the respondents who preferred to use propofol for sedation in children, and the youngest age they would use ranged from 6 months to 16 years in children. Only 50% of the respondents admitted that they would adjust the calorie requirement when patients are on propofol infusion. 22% of the respondents have encountered propofol infusion syndrome in their clinical practice. 53% used rise in lactate and 3% used Acyl or malonyl carnitine levels as a marker, if they suspected propofol infusion syndrome. 96% of the respondents used continuous infusion for sedation, with propofol being the preferred drug used by 83% of them for short term sedation (less than 48 hours). Midazolam was the second common drug used for short term sedation (around 58%) but it was the preferred drug (85%) for long term sedation (more than 48 hours). The respondents felt that haemodynamic status (90% of them) and cost (63% of them) did influence their choice of sedation. Only 60% of the respondents were practising sedation hold regularly and around 30% hardly practised sedation hold. Haloperidol was the preferred drug (70%) for treating agitation in the intensive care unit, with clonidine being the second choice (30%). Atracurium was the neuromuscular blocker preferred by the respondents, with approximately 80% of them used it only intermittently.

The rate of severe pertussis infections has increased in recent decades.

Severe pertussis infections can cause respiratory and cardiovascular failure with an extremely high mortality rate (above 70%). The primary cause of death in severe pertussis is severe refractory pulmonary hypertension (PHT).

Xigris R has been shown to improve cardiovascular and respiratory failure in severe sepsis. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse cerebral dysfunction induced by the inflammatory response to infection. SAE has an unknown incidence but its occurrence is related to an increased mortality rate. We have previously described high levels of the brain-specific S-100\\beta protein in 42% of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock(1. Distinct cerebral lesions were found with S-100\\beta [ 4 lg/L. S-100\\beta levels between 0.06 and 2 lg/L, however, were typically associated with white matter lesions which are thought to represent the pathological substrate of SAE. We studied whether Xigris R influenced S-100\\beta in patients with acute septic shock who presented with increased baseline levels of this biomarker. METHODS. Patients with septic shock who required mechanical ventilation were recruited. All received standard and goal-directed resuscitation. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was calculated before start of sedation.

Xigris R was given as a continuous infusion of 24 lg/kg/h for 96 h. Patients who did not receive Xigris R had a known contra-indication for the drug. S-100\\beta was measured before sedation and start of Xigris R (d1) and then daily during Xigris R infusion. The lower limit of normal was \\ 0.5 lg/L. RESULTS. Sixty-six patients were consecutively enrolled.Twelve patients were excluded from follow-up due to death within 4 days after admission (n=5) baseline S-100\\beta values[ 4 lg/L (n=2), and a pathological brain CTT (n=5).24 patients had S-100\\beta levels\\0.5 lg/ L upfront that did not increase thereafter. Of the remaining 30 patients, 16 received Xigris R . In this group, S-100\\beta values -though higher on d1 than in untreated subjects (1.3 +/-0.8 lg/L vs. 0.9 +/-0.4 lg/L; p = 0.16) -progressively and significantly decreased (1.0 +/-0.8 lg/ L at d2, 0.9 +/-0.6 lg/L at d3, and 0.8 +/-0.7 lg/L at d4; all p \\ 0.05 vs. d1). S-100\\beta tended to increase in the untreated group.In both treatment groups, no correlation was found between GCS and S-100\\beta at baseline. CONCLUSION. PMX-hemofiltration significantly reduces plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alfa (Table 1) , especially in patients with a better outcome at 28 days (Table 2 ). These data suggest a possible correlation between the post-treatment IL-6 levels and a more favourable outcome, whereas pre-treatment IL-6 levels do not seem to be predictive. In contrast, high pretreatment levels of IL-10 and TNF-alfa appears to be related with a poor outcome (Table 2) .

In our institution the mortality rate of this kind of patients was about 65%. An optimal timing about the use of the HP-PMX depends on the pathology. In septic patients, with peritonitis due to perforation and/or anastomotic leakage after abdominal surgery, the presence of Gram-bacteria is actually a common condition.

INTRODUCTION. Severe sepsis remains the main cause of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) (1). During sepsis elevated levels of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines circulate in blood (2) . CPFA is a new resin-based blood purification technique in clinical practice (3) . After purification of plasma in a first resin filter, a second blood filter could be used for the removal of excessive fluid and small molecular weight substances. The resin cartridge nonselectively removes circulating inflammatory mediators. This reduction in cytokine load could possibly attenuate their negative effects on organ function and restore leukocytes function (3). CPFA could be therefore used in the treatment of severe sepsis or septic shock to reduce the levels of circulating cytokines and preserve organ function.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2144, "end": 2147, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2229, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1498, "end": 1507, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "REFERENCE(S"}, {"text": "METHODS.

METHODS. Between July and December 2007, the treating physiotherapist completed a comprehensive checklist of rehabilitation interventions and adverse incidents that occurred during physiotherapy sessions. Data was collected at the end of each weekday for all patients who were mechanically ventilated. Patients who were ventilated for less than five days were excluded at the time of data entry. The end point for data collection was when the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours, was transferred to another hospital or died. INTRODUCTION. There are many controversies and the evidence is limited on the efficacy of shares used in physiotherapy in the respiratory intensive care unit and little information with regard to physical therapy in patients undergoing mechanical ventilatory support. More recently, we suggest that the fan is action beyond the ventilation, which means to extend the discussion about the use of the ventilator focusing specifically for the physiotherapist action, developing three possibilities: a) as a tool of evaluation, b) as a tool for the therapy c) in monitoring.

The results suggest that there are changes in ventricular stress following the introduction and removal of CPAP which are reflected in changes in the levels of brain natriuretic peptides measurable in blood.

Thus, we analyzed the lung weights of MV multiple trauma patients with normal lungs, which offered a unique opportunity to provide normal values for comparison with other MV patients. INTRODUCTION. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential to become a promising new tool for bedside monitoring of regional lung ventilation and lung volume changes. EIT calibrated with tidal volume changes at one end expiratory lung volume (EELV) level has been used in different studies to predict dynamic change in EELV during various procedures. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between lung volume changes measured with a multibreath nitrogen washout technique and lung volume changes calculated from end expiratory lung impedance changes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "METHODS. We evaluated 25 mechanically ventilated patients. Lung volume was measured at different PEEP levels with a nitrogen washout/in technique (Engstrom Carestation, GE Healthcare).

EELV change derived from EELI changes, was calculated assuming a linear relation between tidal impedance change divided by tidal volume and zero impedance / volume change. EELI change was divided by the resulting tidal impedance change / tidal volume ratio to calculate the EELV (ml) change. INTRODUCTION.

Traber Anesthesiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, United StatesINTRODUCTION. Thermal injury leads to the loss of the natural cutaneous barrier to infection, which leads to microbial colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA can induce apoptosis/necrosis in various cell types, but the specific molecular and cellular basis of MRSA-induced lung cell death is poorly understood. We have recently shown that MRSA induces a significant increase in endothelial microvascular permeability and lung NOS activity in our novel ovine model of MRSA-induced pneumonia and sepsis.METHODS.Human microvascular endothelial cells from the lung (HMVEC-L) were challenged with 105 cfu MRSA AW6 in the presence and absence of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, then visualized for ROS/RNS generation via DCHF fluorescence. Real-time changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were tracked via JC-1 fluorescence. MRSA-challenged HMVECs were further analyzed via western blot and confocal microscopy, for 8-oxoguanine or poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer formation. Translocation of AIF from the mitochondrial compartment to the nucleus, activation of caspase-3, and consequent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, all indicators of apoptosis, were also assessed.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF28": {"text": "KINASE GAMMA KINASAE ACTIVITY CONTRIBUTES TO AN INCREASED COAGULATION PHENOTYPES DURING SEPSIS E.

Ranieri 1 1 Anesthesia and Intensive Care, 2 Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Turin, Turin, ItalyINTRODUCTION. Sepsis is a systemic response to infection, which often leads to organ failure and death. An important aspect of the pathophysiology of sepsis is the systemic activation of coagulation and concurrent attenuation of fibrinolysis. Phosphoinositide-3 kinase gamma (PI3Kg), an isoform of the PI3K cell signalling family, has been shown to be involved in the development of sepsis. However, the role of this molecule in the dysregulation of the coagulation cascade during sepsis remains unknown. It is hypothesized that mice lacking PI3Kg or possessing a kinase dead form of this enzyme will be protected from septic-induced activation of coagulation and attenuation of fibrinolysis.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF29": {"text": "0466 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF DROTRECOGIN ALFA (ACTIVATED) ON SOLID ORGAN TISSUE IN MURINE SEPSIS T.

Sickle cell disease includes a group of diseases where the red blood cells produce a mutant form of b hemoglobin called sickle hemoglobin. Sickle cell anemia is the best known example of sickle cell disease. We report our experience with SCD patients admitted to ICU either with Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS)/Vaso-oclusive crisis (VOC) or pulmonary infections and outcome. Individuals with sickle cell disease generally fare well, but suffer from periodic sickle cell crises. These crises occur when red blood cells become stuck in blood vessels, and cause ischemia or infarction. Such crises can cause pain and organ damage. Patients with sickle cell disease are also prone to infections and have an average life expectancy of 40 years.METHODS. Data was collected from patients file on day-to-day manner from October 2002 to December 2006. This is 11-bed adult medical/surgical ICU with admission rate 45-50 patients per month.

DeStefano* Critical Care Services, Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, Laguna Hills, United States INTRODUCTION.Nursing practice based on evidence improves patient outcomes. Members of an American Association of Critical Care Nursing (AACN) local California chapter in the United States reported significant barriers that prevent them from incorporating research findings into their practice. Subsequently, a masters-prepared advance practice nurse developed a unique ''Journal Club'' to reduce these barriers and increase awareness of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP).METHODS.In 2002, a monthly Journal Club was initiated to engage acute and critical care nurses from local regional hospitals in discussion of current, recently published research findings. The monthly topics were selected based on clinical relevance, educational needs assessment, and requests by members. The monthly Journal Club meetings take place at the same time and place in a local restaurant, usually with vendor sponsored dinners. Methods to decrease the inherent barriers related to critiquing academic research included a chapter led critique and review of research findings. This method decreased anxiety related to lack of skills to critique or synthesize the literature and difficulties interpreting the findings by many nurses. Chapter facilitated discussion of complex research by placing less emphasis on interpretation of statistics and research methodologies and focused on adaptation of findings into real clinical practice. The confidential, non-threatening, supportive environment promoted open, frank discussion and diminished intimidation.RESULTS.Over the past five year period, the monthly Journal Club attendance increased from 4-6 members in 2002 to 40-50 members currently and continues to grow. Several members travel over 100km to attend. Community subgroups of interest have also been established to review sedation protocols and other hot topics prompted by an initial Journal Club discussion. Many hospitals are willing to ''share'' policies, guidelines, and tools that they have created with other nurses/institutions in the community to avoid having to ''reinvent the wheel'' to get things rolling in their hospital of practice.CONCLUSION. The regional Journal Club has grown to be a huge success. The creator of the Journal Club and the Board of Directors of the AACN chapter have received numerous member anecdotal accounts of the influence meetings have played in their professional lives by sharpening their professional interest and increasing awareness. The use of research in everyday practice is promoted by simplification of complex research topics and promotes replacing practice based on tradition with practice based on evidence and results in positive patient outcomes.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF39": {"text": "Yee Kwok WW, et al.

Fourcade Intensive Care Unit, Universitary hospital of Purpan, Toulouse, France INTRODUCTION. Alterations of tissue oxygenation and perfusion during septic shock (SS)is a crucial issue. Monitoring peripheral perfusion could be an early and sensitive way to detect vital organ hypoperfusion (1). Transcutaneous oxymetry (TO) allows a non invasive measurement of oxygen trancutaneous pressure (PtcO2) which is related to arterial oxygenation pressure (PaO2) and circulatory status(2). A recent study emphasizes the pronostic value of parameters from TO in patients in SS (3). We hypothesized that variations of PtcO2 (DeltaPtcO2) induced by variations of oxygen arterial content estimated by PaO2 (DeltaP-aO2) during an oxygen challenge test could be related to outcome in SS.METHODS.We conducted a prospective, observational study, in a universitary hospital. From January to August 2007, all consecutive patients admitted for severe SS requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy after early hemodynamic optimisation were included. PtcO2 was measured (Tina 4, Radiometer\u00d2, Copenhagen, Denmark) in basal condition and at the end of an oxygen challenge test (OCT: FiO2 1.0 during 15 min.). Arterial blood gaz were performed before and after OCT. DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2 (%) during OCT was calculated 3 times during the first 2 days of hospitalization(H0, H24, H48). The time course of DeltaPtcO2/DeltaPaO2 was analysed and compared between survivors (S) and non survivors (NS) at day 28th (D28), as well as usual hemodynamics and metabolic parameters: mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), norepinephrine infusion amount and lactatemia.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF73": {"text": "The results are shown in the figure (* = p \\ 0.005).

Despite of antibiotic therapy, fluid therapy and vasopressive/inotropic therapy, the mortality rate of septic shock remains high. In the pathogenesis of septic shock, endotoxin plays an important role. Recently, endotoxin adsorption therapy, polymyxin Bimmobilized fiber column (PMX) hemoperfusion, has been widely used in patients with septic shock in Japan.

In pediatric intensive care units, energy needs are complex to determine. Extracorporeal circulation (EC) that induces an inflammatory state could influences energy expenditure.

Children with expected mechanical ventilation C72 hours and a FiO2 B60% were prospectively studied and separated into 2 groups according to EC or not. REEm was measured daily by indirect calorimetry until extubation; results were compared to predicted REE by the equation from Schofield WH(1985). EI were recorded daily and energy balance was calculated. Comparisons were tested by the t-test and the Bland-Altman method.CONCLUSION. Extracorporeal circulation increases slightly REE in critically ill children, but this rise does not meet the criteria of hypermetabolism (REEm[10% predicted REE). The Schofield equation predicts very accurately REE in both groups. The energy balance remains negative longer in patients with EC compared to patients without EC.

Neutrophils (NE) and bands counting are auxiliary test in detection of bacterial infections, even if the band count is a low-specificity test with high inaccuracy (1). In neonates absolute NE count is one of the Rochester criteria ad is also used to obtain Immature/mature NE ratio (ITR), a useful index in neonatal sepsis diagnosis. ITR has been considered to have an high variability in terms of sensibility (SE) and specificity (SP)(2). Coulter LH700 series hematology analyser provides CBC/diff data, including 24 research population data (RPD) referred to mean and standard deviation of Volume, Conductivity ans Scatter (VCS) measures of WBC subpopulations. Several experiences have been reported about the clinical usefulness of NE RPD in detecting sepsis in adults(3,4). We daily analyze samples of the neonatal intensive therapy providing CBC/Diff and ITR to those with sepsis suspect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of NE RPD in detecting neonates' sepsis in order to find a time-saving test with high SE and SP.METHODS.We collected Coulter LH750 data of 62 neonatal samples with suspect of sepsis and 36 age-matched normal samples. ITR was calculated with 200-cell count and sepsis was assessed with blood culture.RESULTS. Results are reported inTable 1. NE RPD values of septic patients, except SDS, are statistically different from normal. On the basis of sepsis diagnosis we analysed the performances of ITR and NE RPD.CONCLUSION.A fast and correct diagnosis of sepsis is essential in the Intensive Care treatment of neonates and our data clearly show that NE RPD of Coulter LH700 series improve the process of detecting sepsis in neonates. RPD have better performance than the current tests in signalling the suspect of sepsis. Moreover they represent a time-saving and faster test than ITR determination.

All patients received an open suctioning procedure (20 sec, 14 F catheter, 200 mmHg negative pressure). Prospectively patients were stratified into two groups by the post suctioning FRC value (A: FRC [94% of baseline; B: FRC \\94% of baseline). Both groups were randomized into either a recruitment manoeuvre (RM) group (PEEP 15 mbar, PIP 35-40 mbar for 30 sec, group RM) or a non RM group, in which venitilation was resumed without a RM (group NRM), resulting in four groups. FRC and paO2/FiO2 (PF-ratio) were recorded at baseline (T1), after suctioning (T2), after RM or NRM (T3), and 30 min after T3 (T4). RESULTS. B_RM and B_NRM showed lower FRC values at T2 compared to A_RM or A_NRM, which remained lower at T3 and T4 only in B_NRM. At T3 B_NRM showed lower FRC values compared to B_RM. A_RM and A_NRM showed no differences in FRC valuesINTRODUCTION. The use of high PEEP levels has been the main approach advocated to avoid R/D. Nevertheless, a recent clinical trial failed to show any protective effect derived from the use of high compared to moderate PEEP levels. R/D is difficult to assess in patients and the use of static CT may not adequately predict dynamic changes taking place during ongoing mechanical ventilation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of PEEP and tidal volume on R/D using cine-CT during uninterrupted MV.RESULTS. We have already analyzed 5 patients (52\u00b120y.o, 4 male) who were on their 2nd to 6th day of MV (PaFi 169\u00b125, compliance 24\u00b19 ml/cmH2O). R/D was maximal at HTV (7.8\u00b15.8%) and decreased significantly at lower TVs (LTV/LRR:4.9\u00b14.9%,p=0.02 vs HTV; LTV/HRR:5.0\u00b14.4%, p=0.02 vs HTV). Increasing PEEP while using low TV did not further decrease R/D (HP:4.7\u00b14.6%, p=0.5 vs LTV/HRR). Respiratory rate did not influence R/D at low TV. There was a non significant trend to decreased end-expiratory NAT with HP and HTV compared to both LTV/HRR and LTV/LRR.CONCLUSION.Our preliminary data suggest that decreasing tidal volume is the most effective intervention to decrease R/D. At low TV, increasing PEEP adds no further protection against R/D despite a trend to decreased end-expiratory NAT. These data are consistent with results observed in large clinical trials on protective strategies. Cine-CT is a suitable and interesting method to assess R/D during uninterrupted MV.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Fondecyt 11060350.

As a result it decreases Intensive Care stay and subsequently has longterm financial implications.RISK FACTORS LEADING TO MIDAZOLAM THERAPEUTIC FAILURE DURING CONTINUOUS SEDATION IN CRITICALLY ILL VENTILATED PATIENTS Chamorro*, M. Romera, B. Baland\u00edn, M. Valdivia, S. Alcantara Intensive Care, Hospital Puerta Hierro, Madrid, SpainINTRODUCTION. Nearly 17% of critically ill ventilated patients treated with continuous intravenous midazolam experience therapeutic failure (taquifilaxia or tolerance). These phenomena greatly hinder patient management. The aim of this study is to analyse and describe the factors that could influence its onset METHODS. Prospective and descriptive study carried out in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a University hospital. We included 1015 ventilated patients that received midazolam to achieve the proposed sedation aims: 3 to 5 level on the Ramsay scale and ventilator synchrony. We defined therapeutic failure as the need to administer more than 0.23 mg/Kg/h to reach these aims. All patients were treated with intravenous opiates. We analyzed demographical, clinical, and outcome data. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate significant risk factors and logistic regression was used to fit the model.INTRODUCTION.There is great variability in the sedo-analgesic strategies used in critically ill ventilated patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the current sedation, analgesia and neuromuscular blockade practises in adult ICUs in Spain.METHODS.Descriptive study based on an in-person survey of sixty physicians, representative of 60 ICUs. All were critical care specialists or anaesthesia specialists with direct responsibility in critical care management. A questionnaire was developed for this study and consisted of 19 questions on different aspects of usual practises. Each specialist surveyed, anonymously, chose one of five options for each answer. Each answer represents the usual practises in their ICUs, not their personal thought.CONCLUSION. There is considerable variation in clinical practises. Some of the employed strategies could produce morbidity. It is recommended that a standardised approach to analgesic, sedation and neuromuscular blockade use and assessment be developed and tested.RISK FACTORS LEADING TO PROPOFOL THERAPEUTIC FAILURE DURING CONTINUOUS SEDATION IN CRITICALLY ILL VENTILATED PATIENTS C.

Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-related pneumonia and/or sepsis are a frequent serious menace. We have previously shown that excessive nitric oxide mediates MRSA-induced cardiovascular collapse. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that resultant reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play a major role in the MRSArelated cardiovascular morbidity.METHODS.Sheep were operatively prepared for chronic study. After 5 days recovery, tracheostomy was performed under anesthesia and pneumonia was induced by instillation of live MRSA (AW6) (5X1011 CFU) into the airway by a bronchoscope. After the injury, animals were awakened and maintained on mechanical ventilation by 100% O2 for first 3h and thereafter O2 concentration was adjusted according to blood gases. The sheep were resuscitated by Lactated Ringer's solution with initial rate 2ml/kg/h that was further adjusted according to hematocrit. Study groups: sham (non-injured, non-treated, n=6); Control (injured, not treated, n=4); and treated (injured, treated with peroxynitrite catalyst, INO-4885 [0.1mg/kg bolus followed by 0.02mg/kg/h continuous infusion], n=3). Experiment lasted 24 h.RESULTS.Injured animals showed the signs of severe sepsis-related multiple organ failure 3h after insult. Cardiovascular morbidity was evidenced by severe hypotension (MAP), with increased heart rate, cardiac output, left atrial pressure and severely decreased systemic vascular resistance index. Microvascular hyper permeability was evidenced by severe hemoconcentration, decreased plasma protein with decreased plasma oncotic pressure, and increased fluid retention. All these changes were attenuated by intravenous administration of peroxynitrite catalyst. MAP was 94\u00b13 at baseline and 66\u00b13 at 24 h in control vs. 93\u00b11 at baseline and 82\u00b110 at 24 h in treated groups. Fluid retention was 163\u00b163 and 134\u00b154 in control and treated groups at 24 h respectively.CONCLUSION. RNS play a profound role in cardiovascular collapse due to MRSA sepsis. RNS inhibitors should be considered for the future therapy for septic patients.DEEP STERNAL INFECTION IN CARDIAC SURGERY PATIENTS M. D. Carrasco Gonz\u00e1lez*, F.

Hong, Y. Koh, C. Lim respiratory and critical care medicine, Asan medical center, Seoul, South Korea INTRODUCTION. Tracheostomy is one of the most commonly performed procedure in the ICU. But there're no established recommendations about deciding the appropriate point of time. In addition to the effect of early and late timed tracheostomy on patient's outcome. We also tried to investigate whether the proper timing of tracheostomy would be different according to the patients' different type of underlying lung disease.METHODS. From August 2006 to February 2008, This study has been conducted prospectively in medical ICU of one tertiary teaching hospital. Patients on their third to fifth day after translaryngeal intubation have been screened daily. 74 patients who were expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation and satisfied our inclusion criteria were randomized. tracheostomy was performed surgically within 7 intubation days in early group and 14*21 intubation days in late group.RESULTS. 38 and 36 patients were separately randomized as early group and late group. Each 19 and 18 patients were excluded Because of final refusal to tracheostomy and inappropriate timing of procedure. Mean translaryngeal intubation days of each group were 6.6\u00b11.5  and 16.2\u00b13.4 days. Early group showed significant short mechanical ventilation duration(18.6\u00b113.6 vs. 36.1\u00b127.0 days, p=0.017). and short length of ICU stay(22.7\u00b114.3 vs. 38.3\u00b126.5 days, p=0.032). There are no significant differences in ICU mortality(26.3% vs. 38.9%, p=0.479) and hospital mortality(42.1% vs. 44.4%, p=0.615).CONCLUSION. Our study showed that early tracheostomy can shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in patient requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. But possible differences according to the baseline lung characteristics need to study much more patients.ENDOSCOPIC INJURIES AND LARYNGEAL DYSPNEA AFTER EXTUBATION. INCIDENCE, RISK FACTORS J. M.

Endotracheal intubation may generate laryngeal or tracheal complications responsible for respiratory distress resulting in extubation failure. This respiratory distress, with symptoms of upper airway obstruction, is commonly called laryngeal edema. Further studies have shown that different types of laryngeal or tracheal injuries and not only edema could be responsible for upper airway obstruction", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF66": {"text": ".

We found 45 patients with ulceration, 74 with edema, 15 with granulation and 26 patients had vocal cord mobility altered.18 patients (13.2%) presented PES. Five patients did not have laryngeal injury. Two of them had postextubation tracheal injuries : sub-glottic stenosis and obstructive fibrinous tracheal pseudomembrane. Three patients had saliva over the larynx making obstruction associated with poor cough reflex. 13 patients developed LD (9.6%). Endoscopic findings were: 12 patients with grade 2 vocal cord edema and altered mobility. One patient had a grade 2 vocal cord granulation with obstruction of the laryngeal lumen. In unvaried analysis, risk factors of LD were: gender female, duration of translaryngeal intubation, number of intubation and a smaller height/ETT diameter ratio. Height/ETT diameter ratio was the only clinical independent risk factor of LD (OR 0.90 [0.85-0.96]; p\\0.001). 17 patients (12.5%) needed to be reintubated in the 48 hours following extubation.

Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is an established technique used to facilitate ventilatory weaning and avoid the complications of long term translaryngeal intubation. Post-procedure chest radiography is common however its value after a routine PDT has been questioned[1,2].METHODS. Our institution's practice is a bronchoscopically directed PDT technique using a Ciaglia 'Blue Rhino' dilator for tube insertion in adults. A retrospective audit of case records and radiological images was undertaken from 1996 to 2001. This was followed by a prospective cohort study from 2002 to 2005 where every PDT was followed by a chest radiograph (CXR) and compared to the most recent CXR taken as part of routine clinical practice. The responsible physician commented as to whether the PDT was routine and if the CXR changed post-procedure management. A review in January 2006 changed practice and a post-procedure CXR was required only if there were technical difficulties or concerns with ventilation.RESULTS.A total of 221 patients were identified in the retrospective study from 1996-2001. 45%). All cases with radiographic abnormalities had been technically difficult with a high index of clinical suspicion for injury. The prospective cohort studies from 2002-7 identified a total of 478 cases -218 cases had a mandatory post-procedure CXR (before the change in practice in 2006) and 260 with CXR only if clinically indicated. Of the mandatory post-procedure CXRs following routine PDT, there was no evidence of barotrauma or tube misposition. Following routine PDT the CXR altered management in only one case where a higher level of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) was used to treat radiographic atelectasis.

Charcoal adsorption disturbs the functioning of ICU ventilators. For anaesthesia gas scavenging in ICU, an active suctioning system should be preferred. Recent studies have proved that higher PEEP levels are better than lower PEEP levels to treat patients with ALI/ARDS(2). Transmission of IAP to the thorax has an impact on the respiratory system, and changes in intra-thoracic pressure may affect IAP, but the effects of PEEP on IAP and APP measurement are not clear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of increased PEEP levels on IAP measurement.CONCLUSION. Increases in PEEP levels were associated with significative increases in IAP without changes in APP measurements. These changes had no clinical relevance when IAP was within the normal or mild higher range.

D. Spapen* 1 , K. Janssen van Doorn 2 , C. Geers3  1  Intensive Care, University Hospital VUB, Brussels, 2 Intensive Care, St Vincentius Hospital, Antwerp,3  Pathology, University Hospital VUB, Brussels, Belgium INTRODUCTION. Treatment with Xigris R improves mortality in patients with severe sepsis, mainly by faster resolution of cardiorespiratory failure. AKI complicating septic shock is associated with a 70% mortality. Any beneficial effect of Xigris R on sepsis-induced AKI remains speculative.We investigated the effect of Xigris R on outcome and evolution of AKI complicating severe cardiorespiratory failure in a group of patients with septic shock.METHODS.Patients with bilateral pneumonia who developed septic shock were divided in two groups according to the presence (group A; n = 17) or absence (group B; n = 15) of AKI. All patients were fluid-resuscitated, mechanically ventilated and received norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Xigris R was given as a continuous infusion of 24 lg/kg/h for 4 days. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration at a rate of 35 ml/kg/h was started upfront in all patients of group A. Immediate autopsy with kidney prelevation was performed in group A patients who died within 7 days after start of Xigris R infusion. Microscopic findings were compared with those of a matched group of patients with pneumonia-induced septic shock who were not treated with Xigris R .RESULTS. Mean APACHE II score was 30.9 +/-9.9 in group A and 29.7 +/-7.8 in group B. Mean daily NE dose decreased significantly in group A (from 0.28 +/-0.28 at d0 to 0.05 +/-0.10 lg/kg/min at d4; p\\0.001) and in group B (from 0.38 +/-0.42 at d0 to 0.09 +/-0.17 lg/ kg/min at d4; p = 0.002). The AKI group had a more rapid and pronounced decrease in NE need. PaO2/FiO2 index increased markedly in both groups (from 119.2 +/-36.6 to 225 +/-65.5 mmHg in group A and from 128.5 +/-45.4 to 231.8 +/-75.9 mmHg in group B; both p\\ 0.001). ICU mortality was high and similar between groups (70.6% vs. 73.3%). Six patients in group A were autopsied. Microscopy showed a preserved global renal architecture. Glomerular, tubulo-interstitial and blood vessel alterations were all grossly similar between Xigris R -treated and untreated patients.CONCLUSION. We confirmed previously described beneficial effects of Xigris R on respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunction in septic shock. ICU mortality was high and unaffected by concomitant occurrence of AKI. No histological differences at the kidney level were observed between Xigris R -treated and -untreated patients. Whether Xigris R beneficially influences sepsis-induced AKI remains to be proven.HIGH DOSIS OF SELENIUM IN SEVERE SEPSIS C. Montoya*, J. Villalobos, E. Monares, C. Sanchez, M. Poblano, J. Aguirre, C.

Selenium in high doses has demonstrated a better survival in septic patients.METHODS. Prospective, longitudinal, experimental study from October 2007 to March 2008where 68 consecutive septic patients were included and randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Treatment group received high doses of Selenium (1000 mcg of selenium on the first day, 500 the second day and 200 daily up to day 14); control group received 100 mcg on daily bases for 14 days. Inflammatory markers (Sedimentation rate: SR, C-reactive protein: CRP, and lymphocytes) were measured on day 0, 5 and 10. Results are expressed in median (25-75th interquartile interval) and groups were compared with U Mann-Whitney.RESULTS.

Statins have anti-inflammatory, immune modulator, antioxidant, anti thrombotic effects and endothelium stabilizer. Statins have been suggested as a therapeutic tool for septic patients. Our objective was to determine their usefulness in the inflammatory process induced by sepsis.METHODS. Prospective, longitudinal, experimental study from November 2007 to March 2008 of 40 consecutive septic patients who were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: treatment group (received 80 mg of daily simvastatin for 14 days) or control group who did not receive it. Inflammatory markers (Sedimentation rate: SR, C-reactive protein: CRP, and antitrombin III) were measured on day 0, 5, 10 and 14. Results are expressed in median (25-75th interquartile interval) and groups were compared with U Mann-Whitney.RESULTS. SR diminished from 34 (21-45) to 19 (14-23) in treatment group vs. control group where it increased: 28 (21-40) to 36 (27-50) with p \\ 0.01 when both groups were compared; CRP behaved in a similar way, diminishing in the treatment group and increasing in the control. On day 14, SR and CRP reached normal values in control group (p \\ 0.01). Length of stay was longer in control group: 22 (18-26) days vs. 15 (14-16) in treatment group (p\\0.01). Treatment group survival was 80% and control group 75% with multivariate analysis to be done.CONCLUSION. Statins diminish inflammatory systemic response and length of stay. Mortality was not different. EFFECT OF MAGNESIUM ON SEPSIS ASSOCIATED DELIRIUM F. Esen, E. Senturk*, D. Akpir, B. Do\u00f0ruel, P. E. \u00d6 zcan, N. Cakar, L.

Mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) is frequently performed to protect patients from ischemia-reperfusion lesions. Several experimental data exists to suggest its use during sepsis", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF152": {"text": "). Medical treatments and ventilatory settings were standardized according to both the Survival Sepsis Campaign and the ARDSnetwork guidelines. Mean arterial blood, right heart pressures, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, mixed oxygen venous saturation (SVO 2 ), co-oxymetry were collected at H 4 , H 12 , H 24 , H 36 , and each day until day 28. Biological parameters (hemostasis, platelets count, renal function, kali-emia\u2026), nosocomial infections, bleedings, and outcome were specifically monitored. Mean inotropic and vasopressive agents doses, cumulative fluid infusions were also collected.RESULTS. Twenty patients were included (9 MTH/11 control). Hypothermia was easily obtained (33\u00b11\u00b0C) for all patients between H 4 and H 8 , except for two patients who died within 3hours following inclusion. MTH was easily maintained for the 36-hrs period. Once passive rewarming was initiated, normothermia was achieved within 12-hrs. Post-rewarming rebound hyperthermia was observed in 2 patients. No severe complication attributable to MTH was observed, and no difference concerning neither hemostasis, bleedings, nosocomial infections, nor mortality was observed between groups. MTH resulted in decreased cardiac index and heart rate, and increased systemic vascular resistance index. No difference was observed between MTH and controls for MAP, inotropic and vasopressive agents doses, or cumulative fluids infusion. A significant rewarming increased dose was observed for vasopressive agents. No difference in terms of oxygenation parameters was observed between groups.CONCLUSION. MTH is easily feasible in septic shock patients. Several important hemodynamic variations are observed, but without oxygenation parameters variations. Clinical significance of such variations remains unclear. REFERENCE(S). 1-L'Her E et al. Effects of mild induced hypothermia during experimental sepsis. Crit Care Med 2006;34:2621-3. 2-Adrie C et al.

Kwong Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Sinagpore, Singapore INTRODUCTION. To examine the effects of low dose corticosteroids on mortality and reversal of shock in patients with septic shock. METHODS. A computerized search of MEDLINE (February 2008), EMBASE (February 2008), CINAHL (February 2008) and the Cochrane Central Review of Controlled Trials (February 2008) was conducted. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also searched.Randomized controlled trials of low dose corticosteroids versus in patients with septic shock were selected. Two reviewers agreed on the eligibility of the trials. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus. Data and validity of trial methodology were extracted independently by two reviewers utilizing a standardized data abstraction form.RESULTS. Seven relevant trials evaluating 999 patients were identified. There was a trend towards a lower 28-day mortality (RR 0.85, (95% CI 0.70 to 1.04) in patients given low dose corticosteroids but not ICU mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.21). Low dose corticosteroids also did not reduce the proportion of patients with persistent shock at 7 days. (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.21).CONCLUSION. Low dose corticosteroids did not change 28-day mortality or ICU mortality in septic shock.DISCHARGE FROM PHYSICAL THERAPY IN THE POSTOPERATIVE PERIODA. C. M. Duarte* 1 , F. R. Souza 1 , C. M.

Chen* 1 , M. Chou 1 , C. Ou 2 1 Medical ICU, Department of Internal Medicine, 2 Section of Chest Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan INTRODUCTION. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a frequently used procedure for quantitative bacteriological diagnosis in mechanically ventilated patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection. BAL may lead to changes in respiratory mechanics (including increased respiratory resistance and elastance) 1 . However, risk factors leading to these changes remain unknown. The current study tried to identify risk factors contributing to changes in respiratory mechanics following BAL.METHODS.Changes of respiratory mechanics were measured before and after BAL in fiftysix mechanically ventilated patients by using interrupter method under constant flow. Measurement of minimal resistance (Rmin), delta resistance (delta R), maximal resistance (Rmax) and elastance were done before, immediately after and 10 minutes, 30 minutes after BAL. Several parameters including peak airway pressure, airway pressure at zero flow, plateau pressure, intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi), tidal volume, flow rate before BAL were used to correlate with the changes in respiratory mechanics after BAL.RESULTS.PEEPi level before BAL was found to be significantly correlated with changes in Rmax (p = 0.0093), delta R (p = 0.005) and elastance (p = 0.0221). In patients with significant PEEPi ([1 cmH 2 O, n=14), Rmax before BAL was 22.0 \u00b1 6.8 cmH 2 O/L/S. Rmax increased to 31.6 \u00b1 8.5 cmH 2 O/L/S immediately after BAL and by the end of 30 minutes, Rmax remained high (28.4 \u00b1 7.5 cmH 2 O/L/S). The changes in Rmin, delta R and elastance followed the trend of Rmax. In patients without significant PEEPi (\\1 cmH 2 O), Rmax before BAL was 15.5 \u00b1 3.5 cmH 2 O/L/S. It increased to 17.6 \u00b1 4.6 cmH 2 O/L/S immediately after BAL and by the end of 30 minutes, Rmax approached the level before BAL (16.6 \u00b1 4.3 cmH 2 O/L/S). The changes of Rmin, delta R and elastance followed the trend of Rmax, too. The tidal volume and flow rate were similar between patients with significant PEEPi and patients without significant PEEPi.CONCLUSION. Patients with significant PEEPi experienced greater changes in respiratory mechanics than those without significant PEEPi. Physicians should be more cautious when performing BAL in mechanically ventilated patients with significant PEEPi.REFERENCE(S). 1. Klein U, Karzai W, Zimmermann P et al.

R. Souza 1 , C. A. Melo Silva 2 1 physical Therapy, Hospital Salvador, Salvador, 2 physical Therapy, Hub, Brasilia, Brazil INTRODUCTION. Introduction: Disorders in cognitive functions, memory, emotional state and overall performance, are common and can occur in 60-80% of patients in the postoperative period immediately, and in most cases they disappear over time. Changes of sleep can enhance these disturbances and also affect the quality of life of patients. Changes of sleep problems are common during the first week in post-operative cardiac surgery. In the period that immediately follows the surgery, there is reduction in the duration of sleep nightly offset by the increase in the daytime sleep. Given that, he was shown the importance of careful evaluation of sleep and its disorders, to establish individualized attention to improve the quality of sleep of patients in the postoperative period. Objective: to evaluate the impact of the massage on physiological variables, pain intensity and sleep quality of patients in the postoperative one of cardiac surgery. METHODS. Method: a randomized and controlled study with adult individuals of both sexs that had carried through cardiac surgery. Massage was carried in the intervention group in the dorsal region of trunk for 15 minutes each day during the permanence in the Cardiovascular Postoperative Unit. Sleep quality of the patients was evaluated before and after surgery through PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and subjective questions, and daily the physiological variables and visual analogical scale of pain were measured.RESULTS. In the post-operative cardiac surgery there is a worsening of the quality of sleep, but the massage group showed better quality of sleep (9,66 \u00b1 4,36) that the control group (11,87 \u00b1 3,22) (p \\0.05). The mean pain on the first post-operative day of the group intervention has reduced from (45.0 \u00b1 27.74mm) to (7.16 \u00b1 6.58mm) (p\\0.05) after the massage. Of the patients who received back massage, 66% reported feeling of comfort during the day, whereas in the control group, 63% felt it is tired. No significant change was found between the physiological variables. The SpO2 tends to increase with the time in the group massage.CONCLUSION. The gotten findings suggest that the massage minimized the worsening of sleep quality in the postoperative of cardiac surgery, reduced the intensity of pain and promoted comfort sensation. THE ROLE OF THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST IN THE DECANNULATION OF TRACHEOSTOMY PATIENTS C. I. Brown* 1 , A. Brice 2 , C. J. Taylor 3 , J. Burtenshaw 4 , K. Roberts 5 1 Physiotherapy, NWLH NHS Trust, Harrow, 2 Physiotherapy, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, 3 Physiotherapy, Hammersmith and Charing Cross NHS Trust, 4 Physiotherapy, St Mary's NHS Trust, 5 Physiotherapy, Ealing NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom INTRODUCTION. Tracheostomies are becoming one of the more common surgical procedures performed in the Intensive Care (Needham et al 2005). The ongoing management of these patients requires professionals competent to identify when the tracheostomy can be removed safely. Respiratory Physiotherapists feel well placed as professionals to be able to make these decisions and then subsequently perform the decannulations safely.METHODS.Prospective data was obtained from 5 centers and collected via a standardized audit tool. All tracheostomy patients were included irrespective of location or anticipated Physiotherapy input.RESULTS. Data was collected on 104 patients over a 13 week period (19/3/07-15/6/07), 65 patients were successfully decannulated over this time, however data from 4 subjects was incomplete (n=61).Time taken between tracheostomy insertion and decannulation, as well as time between tracheostomy capping and decannulation was compared across three separate groups, ENT/Max Fac patients (n=13), Physiotherapists requesting decannulation (n=22) and Non-Physiotherapists requesting decannulation (n=26). The data was analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis test. There was no significant difference between the three groups for capping to decannulation -p = 0.6449. However using Mann Whitney test there was significant difference between the 3 groups in total time between tracheostomy insertion and decannulation, ENT v physio p \\ 0.0001, ENT v non-physio p = 0.0370, physio v non-physio p = 0.0174. Data was obtained regarding the professional involved with the actual procedure of decannulation. Physiotherapists successfully performed 58%(28/48) of decannulations with the Non-ENT/Max Fac patients irrespective of whether they had requested them. Physiotherapists also requested the majority of their decannulations when the patient had reached a ward environment with 86% (19/22) of patients, compared to 38% (10/26) in the Non-Physiotherapy requesting group (p=0.001).CONCLUSION. There does not appear to be a significant difference between the professionals requesting the decannulation once capping has begun. However, physiotherapists do appear to be performing the majority of decannulations in the Non-ENT/Max Fac patients, with the majority of these requests happening when the patient reaches the ward environment. This has implications for advancing Physiotherapy competencies in line with workforce planning, and possible implications for length of stay.REFERENCE(S).

AUDIT OF PHYSIOTHERAPY REHABILITATION IN A LARGE GENERAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT J. Dowds* Physiotherapy Department, St James Hospital, Dublin, IrelandINTRODUCTION. Many patients develop signs of muscle weakness following a prolonged ICU admission and present rehabilitation challenges. A previous audit of early rehabilitation in the ICU setting found that early activity is feasible and safe in patients with respiratory failure(Bailey et al, 2007). The objectives of this study was to detail the early rehabilitation programme in a large acute ICU, quantify the occurrence of adverse incidents and establish which techniques pose the greatest risk.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF157": {"text": ". Eighty patients met the inclusion criteria during the study period (mean age 62.1 years[SD 16.7]; male n=49, female n=31); 75% had tracheostomies. In total, 814 physiotherapy interventions were carried out during 498 treatment sessions(Table 1). Twenty-four adverse incidents occurred during rehabilitation interventions (2.9%). The most common adverse incidents were patient anxiety (n=16[67%]) and increases in systolic blood pressure (n=5 [21%]). Out of bed techniques, such as sit to stand practice (436 in total) incurred the highest number of adverse incidents (n= 12 [2.8%]), however 11 of these 12 adverse incidents were anxiety related. The 24 adverse incidents occurred in 11 patients (range of adverse incidents per patient 1-6). Of these 11 patients, 10 were successfully weaned and 1 died while ventilated in the ICU.TABLE 1 INTERVENTIONS PERFORMED DURING REHAB IN ICUCONCLUSION. From this data it appears that physiotherapists in this large acute general ICU are safely performing a variety of interventions when rehabilitating the ventilated patient. Many of these interventions involve functional tasks such as sitting and standing. While the percentage of adverse incidents was higher in this study (2.9%) than in previous studies this is due to the inclusion of patient anxiety. There were no episodes of physical injury to patients during ICU rehabilitation.REFERENCE(S).

The results provide a new option of decision making to the physiotherapeutic intervention in artificially ventilated patients. In this new focus, the functional impact of the disease, defined by biomechanical markers and gas exchange, in our usual way, is tools that respond to important issues of respiratory physiotherapy on what deal, when and how to perform the intervention. The artificial ventilator is able to meet these demands. The effectiveness of the intervention to change the impedance of the respiratory system has been established.THE REPERCUSSION OF THE MOTOR PHYSICAL THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INTRA-ABDOMINAL PRESSURE MEASUREMENT SUBMITTED TO MECHANICAL VENTILATIONA. T. Guiera*, E. E. Aquim, \u00c1 . R\u00e9a-Neto, M. C. Oliveira, J. Librelato, S. Damin, V. Zwtsch UTI, CEPETI, Curitiba, Brazil INTRODUCTION. High intra-abdominal pressure in patients submitted to abdominal surgeries or trauma can cause a lot of systemic damages, with temporary or lasting side-effects on different organs. Motor physical therapy acts on patients 0 rehabilitation at the intensive care units benefiting muscular and cardiorespiratory systems, but it can change PIA values. The aim of this study was to evaluate the repercussion of the motor physical therapy in the intra-abdominal pressure and in the mechanical ventilation.METHODS. This research was developed at some ICU 0 s from Curitiba-PR, Brazil, done in patients with IAP monitoring and submitted to mechanical ventilation. Four protocols were elaborated by the authors to valuate the IAP and MV values before and after their applications, and the protocols were the Hip Flexion Protocol, Bedside Elevation, Triple Hip Flexion and the Deep Venous Thrombosis Prevention. The collected data were the vital signs, IAP values, the pulmonary static compliance and air way resistance. The statistic used was ANOVA to IAP variables and Student ''t'' Test to the MV ones.RESULTS. Forty-six protocols were done, the first had an n=13, the second an n=11, the third an n=12 and the fourth an n=10. About 74% were male and the mean age was 32,75. APACHE mean was 7,4. Of all the protocols used, just two of them showed expressive alteration on the IAP values: the Hip Flexion Protocol (p=0,01) and the Bedside Elevation (p=0,02). About the MV variables, only one protocol caused an expressive increase of the air way resistance, the Hip Flexion Protocol (p=0,03).CONCLUSION. We could conclude that we have to be careful about the motor physical therapy on the inferior member of the patients with IAP monitoring, because the positioning can increase its value, such as the hip flexion. We could also check that about the MV variables, we only had alteration of the air way resistance on the hip flexion.REDUCED RIGHT VENTRICULAR PERFORMANCE IN SEVERE RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS BRONCHIOLITISA. Narayanan* 1 , K. Thorburn 1 , M. Eisenhut 1 , A. Shauq 2 1 Paediatric Intensive Care, 2 Paediatric Cardiology, Royal Liverpool Children Hospital Alderhey, Liverpool, United KingdomINTRODUCTION.Previous studies demonstrated myocardial damage and hepatitis in infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We hypothesized that myocardial damage and ischaemic hepatitis were related to right ventricular failure. Objectives: To assess right ventricular performance in infants with severe RSV disease and an association with disease severity, myocardial damage, and hepatitis.METHODS.Prospective observational study of consecutive infants ventilated with severe RSV infection without congenital heart disease. Pulse wave Doppler echocardiographic assessment with calculation of the right ventricular function (Tei index), left ventricular ejection fraction and diameters; cardiac troponin T levels; transaminase levels and C-reactive protein levels were performed on admission. Additional data were collected on age, oxygenation and ventilation indices and duration of ventilation.RESULTS.Thirty four ventilated infants with confirmed RSV bronchiolitis were enrolledmedian age [range] 1.4 months [0.4 -11.7], median length of ventilation 5 days[2 -10]. Seven (20%) infants had an elevated right ventricular Tei index indicating significantly reduced right ventricular function. Left ventricular function including ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic and systolic volume, left atrial diameter, as well as C-reactive protein and transaminase levels were not different between patients with and without right ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac troponin T was raised in 14 (41%) -3/7 with elevated and 11/27 with normal Tei index (p = 1.0).

TISSUE DOPPLER IMAGING IN PREDICTION OF REVERSE REMODELING AFTER CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY S. H. zaky*, S. S. Ataa, M. M.. Alrefaee Ccardiology, Babtain Cardiac Center, Dammam, Saudi ArabiaINTRODUCTION. The selection criteria for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) for heart failure patients has been debated as non responders to this novel therapeutic modality are 20-30%.Different Echocardiographic techniques have been used for both selection & prediction of effectiveness of CRT. We studied the feasibility of Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) to assess and predict reverse remodeling (RR),defined as decrease in end systolic volume (LVESVd by [ 15% and /or increase in ejection fractions (EFd) by[ 10% in HF pts.METHODS.Twenty eight HF patients were enrolled (20 males, mean age= 46.4+ 14 Ys. range 18-65ys.) for whom CRT was implanted (2 pts with ICD function, 1 epicardial). Mmode, 2 D & TDI were performed at baseline and at 3-months follow-up. Seven parameters of interventricular (Rt. to Lt.delay measured by Doppler at pulmonic & aortic valves respectively) and intraventricular (M-mode delay) asynchrony based on the time to peak myocardial contraction were compared. TDI Quantitative analysis of peak systolic velocities at 4 LV segments(basal & mid cavity of both Septal & post.lateral walls) Q-basal, Q-mid,respectively, were compared.RESULTS. Twenty one pts,75% (responders or group 1) showed significant clinical improvement & RR compared to non responders (group 2,7 pts).Group 1 showed significant improvement of all ECHO parameters over group 2. At baseline, responders had a significant M-mode Delay, Rt. to lt. delay than nonresponders (234.5 + 67.8 vs. 188.6+30 msec., P\\0.05 and 67.4 +34 vs. 27.9 +26.6 msec.,P\\0.01 respectively). Also Q-basal & Q-mid were significantly higher in gp.1 than gp.2 (113.8+42.891vs. 91.4.4+26.1 msec, P\\0.05and 183.3+98 msec. vs 118.6+49.8 msec,P\\0.01 respectively) at baseline. LVESVd correlated significantly with Rt.-Lt delay (r=0.5, P\\0.005), Q-basal (r=0.4, P\\0.05),and Q-mid (r=0.45, P\\0.01). Using multivariate regression analysis, the independent parameters included Rt.-Lt.delay and Q-mid (r=0.5, P\\ 0.01) in both groups. CONCLUSION. Rt.-Lt.delay and Q-analysis of peak systolic velocity at mid LV cavity measured by TDI are the most powerful predictors of LV reverse remodeling and can be useful for pts selection for CRT. ACCURACY OF NON-INVASIVE ESTIMATES OF CARDIAC OUTPUT USING BIOREACTANCE AND PULSE CONTOUR ANALYSIS IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS B. Lamia*, H. Kim, A. Hefner, D. Severyn, H. Gomez, J. Puyana, M. Pinsky Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, United States INTRODUCTION. We analyzed the correlation between estimates of cardiac output (CO) amongst minimally invasive devices using pulse contour analysis. (LiDCO\u00d2plus, FloTrac\u00d2 and PiCCO\u00d2) and bioreactance (NICOM\u00d2).METHODS. Continuous or bolus thermodilution CO measures from a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) were simultaneously compared to estimates of arterial pulse contour-derived CO using the LiDCOplus\u00d2, FloTrac\u00d2, and PiCCOplus\u00d2 and to CO measured by the NI-COM\u00d2 in 20 cardiac surgery patients during the first 2 post-operative hours. Mean and absolute values for CO across all devices were compared by ANOVA, Bland-Altman and linear regression analysis.RESULTS. Mean PAC CO (5.6\u00b11.8 L/min) was similar to LiDCO, FloTrac and PiCCO (5.9\u00b11.7, 5.9\u00b11.4, 5.4\u00b11.7 L/min, respectively), but higher than NICOM (5.1\u00b11.3 L/min, p \\ 0.05) values. Bias \u00b1 SD between PAC-CO and LiDCO (n=18), FloTrac (n=41), PiCCO (n=23) and NICOM (n=50) CO values were 0.32\u00b10.56, -0.33\u00b11.25, 0.02\u00b10.52 and -0.50\u00b11.37 L/min, respectively, with limits of agreement of -0.78 to 1.42, -2.80 to 2.10, -1.01 to 1.05 and -3.20 to 2.20 L/min, respectively, and LiDCO, FloTrac, PiCCO and NICOM CO values correlated with PAC-CO values (r2=0.88,0.46, 0.89 and 0.41, respectively). The Bias \u00b1 SD of dynamic changes (D) between DPAC-CO and DFloTrac (n=17) and DNICOM (n=19) were 3\u00b112% and 2\u00b123% respectively. LiDCO and FloTrac stroke volume variation (SVV) correlated (r2=0.58, bias -0.40\u00b16.50%, precision -13 to 7%).CONCLUSION. Arterial pulse contour analysis and bioreactance devices estimated CO with different bias and precision relative to PAC derived CO values. Thus, the results of prior studies using LiDCO\u00d2, FloTrac\u00d2, PiCCO\u00d2 and NICOM\u00d2 -derived estimates of CO cannot be compared to each other, nor can absolute values be used to drive similar resuscitation protocols.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

Mean age was 59yrs (range 15-88). Only 1 patient had their weight measured accurately, 25 had estimated weights. None had their height recorded. 2649 ventilator hours of data were collected, 1044 hours Pressure Control (PC), 1565 hours Pressure Support (PS) and 33 hours Volume Control (VC) modes. The mean(Range) TV delivered with each mode of ventilation was: VC 7.8(6.5-14.7)ml/kg IBW, PC 8.2(3.2-16.3)ml/kg IBW, PS 8.9(2.6-22.5)ml/kg IBW.

Patients in ICU were ventilated with TV in excess of current recommendations. Patients ventilated with PS received highest tidal volumes and had the widest variability. Over-ventilation was significantly increased in female patients, suggesting that the lower IBW of female patients was not taken into account when setting ventilator parameters.

Cardoso, A. Wolmeister, A. Milani, S. Vieira, G. Friedman, M. Bozzetti Critical Care Division, Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil INTRODUCTION. Patients that need mechanical ventilation (MV) have high mortality rates. In Latin America, there is limited knowledge about mortality risk factors in patients on MV. Identifying such factors may contribute to improve the survival of these patients. The objective of this study was to determine mortality risk factors in patients that required MV in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a general university hospital in southern Brazil. METHODS. Prospective cohort study of 1115 adult patients conducted between March 2004 and April 2007.Patients were included if they needed MV for at least 24 hours. Data were collected on each patient at the inclusion in the study and daily during the MV for up to 28 days. Several variables were studied, including age, gender, APACHE II score, medical or surgical patients, causes for the requirement of MV, organ dysfunction/failure developed prior to MV or/and during MV, ventilatory parameters, modes of MV, and duration of MV. A multivariate analysis using conditional logistic regression model was performed.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF174": {"text": "Retrospective analysis of data retrieved from a large teaching hospital ITU admission database and hospital records from Jan 2006 -Aug 2007.Statistical significance was determined by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS. 822 patients were ventilated in this period.63/822 (13%) had a primary diagnosis of COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation. Mortality was similar regardless of whether the admission was due to COPD exacerbation 22.2% (14/63) or any other pathology 22.9% (169/759) (NS*). 20% (13) of the COPD patients received mechanical ventilation after failed trial of NIV. In the failed NIV group 70% (9) patients survived and 30% (4) died (NS) The patients who survived tended to be younger (mean age 61.5 vs. 67.2 years NS), had less severe acidosis (pH 7.21 vs. 7.14; NS), lower APACHE score (18.4 vs. 23.4, NS) and a shorter stay (9.4 vs. 10.5 days, NS) than the failed NIV patients who died. Preadmission spirometric estimation of COPD severity was available in a minority 46% (29) of patients. Mean FEV1 was 1.4 L -60% of predicted (Range 0.56 -2.5 L). CONCLUSION. Our study shows that patients with COPD exacerbations selected for mechanical ventilation had no worse mortality than patients ventilated for any other pathology. Mortality is not worse after a failed trial of NIV. Spirometric results are usually not available at the time of admission and patients with variable disease severities are ventilated. Criteria to select individuals suitable for ventilation may be beneficial and could be addressed in larger studies. *NS -Non-Significant.

Large pulmonary shunt or reduce tidal ventilation may minimized the accuracy of the technique (1, 2) . The aim of this prospective controlled study was to investigate the agreement between partial CO2 rebreathing and thermodilution for the determination of cardiac output in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and to test the effect of shunt on the accuracy of the method.METHODS. Twenty patients meeting the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC)criteria for ARDS and receiving low tidal ventilation (VT = 6 ml.kg-1 predicted body weight) with PEEP [ 7 cmH2O were enrolled. All patients had a pulmonary artery catheter (Edwards Vigilance Monitor, Irvine, USA) and a NICO2 monitor (Novametrix Medical System, Wallingford, CT). Seven measurements were performed every 20 min over a 2-h period of haemodynamic stability. A total of 140 pairs of cardiac output values were available. Pulmonary shunt was determined at FIO2 1 at the end of the protocol. We used Bland-Altman method's to calculate bias, precision, limit and percentage error of agreement in the whole population and according to the shunt fraction (higher or lower than 30%). Data are mean\u00b1SD.RESULTS. Overall cardiac output was 6.6\u00b10.9 L.min-1 with thermodilution and 5.8\u00b11.7 L.min-1 with partial CO2 rebreathing (r=0.68). Bias was 0.8\u00b11.5 L.min-1 and limit of agreement -2.1 to 3.7 L.min-1. In the 11 patients with shunt \\30%, values were 0.4\u00b11 L.min-1 (r=0.86) and -1.6 to 2.5 L.min-1, respectively. In the nine patients with shunt[30%, values were 1.4\u00b11.7 L.min-1 (r=0.41) and -2.2 to 4.8 L.min-1, respectively. The percentage error of agreement was 48% in the whole population, 32% in the low shunt group and 55% in the high shunt group.CONCLUSION. In ARDS patients receiving lung protective ventilation, determination of cardiac output by the partial CO2 rebreathing technique provides relevant information only in less severely hypoxemic patients. In all other patients, the percentage error of agreement largely exceeds 30%, indicating that partial rebreathing cannot substitute for thermodilution. INTRODUCTION. Left ventricular (LV) function alterations in atrial fibrillation (AF) are due to lack of atrial kick, reduced diastolic filling, irregular cycle lengths, but may also reflect an intrinsic form of tachy cardiomyopathy. Whether impairment of LV systolic function is global or regional is an attractive hypothetical question that needs to be answered and the present study is an attempt to address this issue. We studied 20 patients (13 males, mean age 41\u00b1 16 years) all had persistent (preceeded by paroxysmal) AF that was resistant to pharmaceutical therapy. One patient (pt) had rheumatic heart disease, five had dilated cardiomyopathy, two had old myocardial infarction and one had Ebstein anomaly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 227, "end": 229, "text": "2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Following clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic evaluation, all pts were subjected to radiofrequency (RF) ablation of pulmonary vein potentials, followed by 3 weeks of oral anticoagulant therapy, Fourteen pts had successful ablation, 3 had failed ablation, 2 pts returned to AF, and one pt died. Nuclear multigated radionuclide angiography (MUGA) using in vivo method was performed for all pts before and 3 months following ablation.Besides scintigraphic assessment of global LV ejection fraction (%EF), regional %EF was assessed by 6 segment scoring system of standard MUGA.RESULTS. Comparing the baseline readings (i.e. before RF-ablation) to readings after 3 months: (1) global %EF showed significantly greater percentage increase (37%) than the baseline readings (from 48%\u00b17.2 to 65.9%\u00b15.9, pB.001). (2) Significant increases in regional %EF in the high lateral segment (36%, pB0.01), the lower septal segment (53%, pB0.001) and high septal segment (64%, pB0.001). The mid-lateral, inferolateral and inferoapical segments showed significantly lesser increases in regional %EF (20%, PB0.5), (18% PB0.5) and (15%, PB0.5) respectively. (3) Failed cases with persistent AF showed insignificant increases in both global %EF and regional %EF 3 months after RF-ablation.CONCLUSION. Termination of AF restores global %EF (37%), as well as regional contractile LV function thus restoring synchronization of previously asynchronous LV during AF. Greatest improvements in regional EF (64%, 53% and 36%) were exhibited by the high septal, lower septal and upper lateral segments respectively compared to the inferoapial, mid and lower lateral segments which exhibited less than 30% improvement. Improvement of LV hemdoynamics after restoration of sinus rhythm and increases in both global and regional LV contractile functions could therefore be partly ascribed to the LV resynchronization achieved by AF termination. 4 1 Anaesthesia and ICM, Gartnavel General Hospital, 2 Anaesthesia and ICM, Southern General Hospital, 3 Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, 4 Anaesthesia and ICM, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, United Kingdom INTRODUCTION. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its precursor NT-proBNP are biochemical markers of ventricular stress. Raised levels of these makers contribute to diagnosis and prognosis in a number of pathological states 1,2 commonly encountered in critical care medicine. However, the effects of introducing or removing positive airway pressure on BNP or NT-pro-BNP levels are largely unknown. We investigated the effects of introducing and removing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the plasma BNP and NT-proBNP levels of healthy male volunteers.METHODS. Following ethics committee approval 15 healthy male volunteers were recruited. After resting semi-recumbent for 1 hour a blood sample for BNP/NT-proBNP assay was taken (T1). Thereafter CPAP of 15cm H 2 0 (Fi0 2 =0.21) was applied via facemask for 1 hour after which time a futher sample was drawn. (T2). A further hour was spent resting semirecumbent before a final BNP/NT-pro-BNP sample (T3) was taken.

University of Bari. INTRODUCTION. Atelectasis related alveolar collapse is a common finding in acute lung injury (ALI), leading to increased shunt and hypoxemia. Current treatment strategies aim to recruit alveoli. Collapsed alveoli opened by a recruitment manoeuver (RM) tend to recollapse without adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). RMs followed by inadequate PEEP permits unstable alveoli. The resulting cyclic recruitment/derecruitment during mechanical ventilation may contribute to ventilator associated lung injury (VALI) despite improved oxygenation. Results from a previous animal study suggest that total input reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) at 5 Hz can be used to assess at the bedside the development of atelectasis and to monitor the efficacy of RM. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a strategy of RMs followed by ''optimal'' PEEP titrated according to optimal reactance measured by FOT could reduce VALI compared to a standardized strategy.METHODS. In 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs, ALI was induced by saline lavage, and the degree of damage was assessed by whole-lung computed tomography. The animals were then studied for 12 hours by continuous monitoring of lung mechanics, gas exchange, FOT and hemodynamics. The animals were randomized into two groups: group A was treated with RMs and PEEP titrated according to optimal reactance measured by FOT every two hours. Titration of PEEP was performed by continuously monitoring reactance during RMs with stepwise reduction of PEEP from 20 cm H20 by steps of 2 cm H2O. PEEP was considered optimal at the step before which the reactance started to decrease. Group B was treated with RMs every two hours and PEEP was adjusted according to the ARDSnet protocol. Plasma TNF-alfa, IL6 and IL8 were measured at baseline and at the end of the experiment. We looked for a relationship between change in lung volume, oxygenation and compliance during this manoeuvre. We used an automated measurement of end expiratory lung volume (EELV) using nitrogen (N2) washout/washin, available in an ICU ventilator (Engstrom, GE).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "METHODS. 35 patients with ARDS (PaO2/FiO2= 151 \u00b153 mmHg) were ventilated in volume controlled (Vt 6mL/kg PBW and flow=60L/min).

Patients increasing their PaO2/FiO2 ratio higher than 10% (median, responders) had significant variations of EELV when seated (p\\0.001) by contrast with non responders. Non responding patients had little or no variations of EELV induced by position. Static compliance significantly decreased during semi-recumbent and seated positioning (p=0.001 and 0.0001) but this decrease was lower for responding patients. Origin of ARDS, duration before inclusion and shock were not associated with variations of lung volume or oxygenation.CONCLUSION. Sitting position (''verticalization'') increases PaO2/FiO2 ratio and EELV in approximately half of patients with ARDS. An association between lung volume and oxygenation increase seemed to explain the difference between responders and non responders. Seated position was more efficient than semi-recumbent.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. We thank General Electric and Hill Rom which provided ventilator and beds. [1] . The optimal duration of RM is a risk/benefice ratio between effectiveness and cardiovascular compromise. This prospective study was designed to measure the kinetic of recruitment and the hemodynamic tolerance in order to determine the optimal duration for the RM in ARDS. CONCLUSION.

Admission characteristics associated with hospital mortality in patients admitted with a primary or secondary diagnosis of haematological malignancy (2980 patients) were age, previous bone marrow transplant, Hodgkin's lymphoma, length of hospital stay prior to admission, tachycardia, tachypnoea, GCS\\13, sedation, P/F ratio\\200 mmHg, acidaemia, oliguria, hyponatraemia, and uraemia. Factors associated with acute hospital mortality in patients with a haematological malignancy in their past medical history (4361 patients) were age, severe sepsis, length of hospital stay prior to admission, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnoea, P/F ratio \\ 100 mmHg, low GCS, oliguria, sedation, mechanical ventilation, uraemia, serum creatinine below 0.6 lmol l-1, hypo-or hypernatraemia, acidaemia, alkalaemia and anaemia.CONCLUSION. Acute hospital mortality of admissions to ICUs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with haematological malignancy is nearly double that of other ICU admissions. Mortality increases with the number of failing organs on admission to ICU, and as the hospital length of stay before ICU admission increases. INTRODUCTION. Acute renal failure (ARF) is a serious complication of pregnancy. It is considered as an independent mortality risk factor in the intensive care unit (ICU) and associated with an increased mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologies and to identify risk factors and outcome of peripartum ARF.METHODS. An open prospective observational cohort study in a multidisciplinary ICU. Demographic and obstetric management (transfusion, cesarean section, hysterectomy, anesthetic complications, etc.) data were collected and analyzed.ARF was defined as serum creatinine C 100 lmol/l and/or oliguria\\150 ml/8 hours or\\500 ml/day and/or doubling of baseline serum creatinine levels. Generalistic scoring systems (SAPS II, APACHE II, APACHE III) and organ dysfunction scoring systems were calculated at admission and on a daily basis. Data were computed on SPSS 11.5 XP-Windows compatible. Results were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical analysis was based on the chi-squared test and Student t test corrected by the Fisher exact test.RESULTS. Between January 1996 and December 2003, 541 obstetrics patients were admited to our ICU. The mean age was 31.2 \u00b1 5.9 years; mean term was 34.7 \u00b1 4.5 weeks. Preeclampsia, eclampsia and peripartum haemorrage were the leading causes associated with ARF. Univariate analysis found that uterine atonia, transfusion, multiple pregnancy and vaginal delivery were significantly associated with ARF, whereas cesarean section showed an odds ratio (OR) = 0.455. Multiple regression analysis retained only transfusion prior to ICU hospitalization as significantly associated with ARF. Oliguria and the level of renal failure are predicting factors of mortality.Overall mortality was 10.4% (n = 57). ARF was noticed in 68 patients, with a mortality of 33.8% (n = 23). The relative risk (RR) of mortality when patients developed ARF was 4.7 with an OR of 6.6. Mean scores for patients with and without ARF were respectively: 41.1 \u00b1 20.9 and 21.6 \u00b1 13.7 for SAPS II; 16 \u00b1 8 and 7.5 \u00b1 6 for APACHE II and 63.3 \u00b1 31.6 and 24.4 \u00b1 23.8 for APACHE III (P \\ 0.01 for all scores). Renal failure was usually associated with at least another organ dysfunction as demonstrated by mean SOFA at day 1 (9.3 \u00b1 4.5) whereas without ARF it was 3.7 \u00b1 3 (P \\ 0.001).CONCLUSION. ARF is associated with high mortality ([ 30%). Aggressive treatment and prevention of renal failure is necessary to improve prognosis. ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "We conducted a retrospective case-note study of obstetric patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit from January 1994 to December 2005.RESULTS. There were 47952 deliveries over the 12-year period of study. There were 175 obstetric admissions to the Intensive Care Unit. (0.36% of deliveries). Seventy percent of admissions were following operative delivery. Unlike our previous case-note study there was an increased proportion of admissions due to haemorrhage and a decreased rate of admissions associated with pre-eclampsia or hypertensive disease of pregnancy. There was one ICU admission as a consequence of pulmonary thromboembolism.There was one maternal death in this 12-year period compared to 3 maternal deaths in our earlier report. This maternal death was associated with life-threatening coagulopathy.CONCLUSION. The national triennial Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) identify thrombosis and thromboembolism, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism or haemorrhage as the commonest causes of direct maternal death in the United Kingdom. These do not represent the commonest causes for obstetric admission to our Intensive Care Unit. Despite comprehensive guidelines as many as half of all transfusions in the critically ill may be inappropriate (1) . FFP transfusion in critcal care is associated with significant morbidity, including an increased risk of infection (2) and Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (3). Conventional coagulation assays including International Normalized Ratio (INR) are often used to guide FFP transfusion, however a moderately deranged INR (\\1.9) is not an accurate predictor of bleeding. Furthermore the use of FFP prophylaxis prior to invasive procedures in critically ill patients has been called into question (4).METHODS. This was a retrospective audit of all FFP transfusions administered to patients in a UK District General Hospital ICU over a period of one year. Indications for transfusion and the volume of FFP administered in each transfusion were documented. In order to gauge thresholds for transfusion INR pre-transfusion was recorded.RESULTS. Approximately 10% of all ICU admissions received a FFP transfusion. A total of 337 units were administered in 104 separate transfusions. Indications were varied, including correction of coagulopathy in actively bleeding patients, prophylaxis for invasive procedures (including epidurals and central venous catheters) and to correct coagulopathy in patients without any apparent bleeding. In 39% of transfusions the pre-transfusion INR was less than 1.9. At least 23% of transfusions were sub-therapeutic, using 2 units (approximately 400ml) or less.CONCLUSION. A significant proportion of FFP administration is inappropriate. Administration to patients with mildly deranged coagulation assays is common. Transfusion is unlikely to be beneficial in these patients in the absence of active bleeding. In addition a large number of FFP transfusions use sub-therapeutic doses -prominent guidelines suggest volumes of 12-15 ml/kg (4). It is important to carefully assess the indications for FFP administration as transfusion is associated with significant adverse effects. Further education is needed.CONCLUSION. Liver dysfunction at ICU admission in septic patients was associated with a higher mortality rate and more organ failures according univariate analysis. Nonetheless, liver dysfunction evaluated by SOFA score was not independently associated with ICU mortality by multivariate regression analysis.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. This study was supported by institutional funds. INTRODUCTION. The use of mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) has been shown to improve survival and neurological outcome of comatose survivors who recovered spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. Although the evidence supporting the method is strong and it has entered the guidelines for resuscitation, implementation of this method is still low: according to recently published data, 87% of physicians and 76% of German ICUs did not use the method. In this survey we investigated current implementation of MTH in Croatia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1303, "end": 1306, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1427, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "A questionnaire was created and served as basis for a structured interview.

There are 24 general hospitals and 8 university hospitals in an we conducted the interview in all but two. In those 30 hospitals, there are 33 ICUs admitting patients after cardiac arrest: 15 mixed surgical/medical, 11 coronary care units and 7 general medical ICUs. Only 9% ICUs used MTH as standard method, all in university hospitals. Ice cold infusions and ice packs in combination are methods of cooling in all three. Of those that do not use the method 10% are planning to start using it soon, 7% are not aware of the method, 20% claim it is technically too difficult, 7% claim it is too costly and 7% need more proof of efficiency. Most ICUs (48%) gave no reason for not using the method.CONCLUSION. Even with the ICUs planning to start using MTH after cardiac arrest, it's implementation in is unacceptably low. The reasons given for not using it suggest lack of knowledge and a nationwide program promoting the method and its benefits could be the best way for improving the implementation in near future.INTRODUCTION. The complication rate of intubation under elective conditions is low. On the other hand airway management of the critically ill patient often requires emergent intubation (EI) in the setting of hemodynamic failure.We study the incidence of hemodynamic, airway complications and mortality associated with EI.METHODS. Prosprective clinical trial over a period of 12 months. Patients in cardiopulmonary arrest were excluded. We assesed: indication, hemodynamic and gasometric changes, complications, difficulty and mortality. Definitions: difficult EI when a intensive care last year resident or a staff intensivist couldn 0 t intubate at the first attempt. Intubation associated mortality: as death that ocurred during or within 30 minutes of the procedure. Chi-square was used for statistical analysis.RESULTS. n= 288 patients. Gender (m = 190, f=98), mean age = 56 (15-87). Location of intubation: emergency room: 28%, Intensive Care Unit 60%, other units 12%. Indications for EI: work of breathing 45%, low level of conciousness 39%, bad management of secretions 12,2%, self-extubation 2,1%, airway obstrucion 1,7%. Medications administered: Benzodiazepines and Opioids 75%; propofol 8%; Muscle relaxants: 70%. Attempts: First attempt 81%; Second 8,4%; third or successive 9%; 3 patients (1%) underwent emergency cricothyrotomy. Difficult intubation = 31 (10,88%). 220 patients were normotensive before EI (TAS[=90 mmHg)and 68 patients hypotensive. In the first group 73 patients developed hypotension and two died (0,9%). In the hypotensive group one patient died (1,4%). No significant differences in mortality between both group (p00,5). Hypoxemia postEI: 10% (28); esophageal intubation: 1,7% (5); selective bronchial intubation: 1,3% (4); bronchoaspiration: 1,3% (4): global mortality 1% (3).CONCLUSION. Securing the airway is a vital procedure in the critically ill patient that in many ocassions has to be applied in an emergency situation. Hemodynamic failure arised as the most important cause of death associated to an EI. The previous hemodynamic profile is not a predictor of mortality.

Intracerebral hematoma and major cerebral edema are the most feared complications after brain tumor surgery. Arterial hypertension is a wellknown risk factor for postoperative intracerebral hemorrhaghe, while hypoxia and arterial hypotension might exacerbate neuronal injury. Therefore, emergence from anesthesia for brain tumor surgery should guarantee stable systemic (cardiovascular as well as respiratory) parameters. This prospective study was performed to compare early postoperative systemic complications after emergence of anesthesia in pts awakened in the operating room at the end of surgery or on the ICU (within a max of 4 hours of ICU admission).METHODS. Over a 2-years period, 142 pts scheduled for elective brain tumor surgery were randomised into early awakening (71pts) or postoperative short-term sedation with propofol (71pts). We analysed and compared the incidence of respiratory events (hypoxia defined as PaO2\\90mmHg, hypercapnea defined as PaCO2 [46mmHg) and cardiovascular events (arterial pressure increase above 30% of baseline, systolic arterial pressure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 294, "end": 295, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "0668"}, {"text": "Patients who were awakened in the operating room revealed a 5.3% incidence of arterial hypoxia, while in 27.3% of them hypercapnea was observed.

In the late awakening group, 4.3% of pt revealed hypotensive values (2.9% necessitating the use of vasopressors). In the early awakening group, incidence of arterial hypertension (necessitating antihypertensive medication) was 14.3%, while for the postoperative short-term sedated pts, incidence of arterial hypertension (with antihypertensive medication) was 21.5%. We observed no difference in duration of postoperative ICU stay between both groups and no difference in incidence of major neurological complications (postoperative hemorrhaghe or cerebral edema).CONCLUSION. Pts allowed to early awakening after brain tumor surgery revealed an increased incidence of hypercapnea, while pts submitted to postoperative short-term sedation with propofol appeared to be more vulnerable to arterial hypoxemia and especially to arterial hypertension.

Experimental hemorrhagic shock induces increased production of S100B protein, a marker of brain injury, associated with the severity of shock (1) . Whether this increase is exclusively due to cerebral hypoperfusion or other factors also contribute to this increase, remains unclear. Inflammatory response also follows acute hemorrhage (2), and might have a role in the release of S100B. Thus, we investigated the relationship between serum S100B protein and IL-6, and their possible prognostic value in patients with hemorrhagic shock.METHODS. Eighteen (12 men) patients with a mean age of 62\u00b122 yr, undergoing emergency surgery to control hemorrhagic shock of various etiologies were included. None suffered previously from cerebral damage or neurological disease. Blood samples were taken for blood gas, lactate, IL-6, and S100B measurements on admission and over the next three days. Vital signs were recorded and severity of illness was assessed by the APACHE II score.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 151, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ELEVATED SERUM LEVELS OF S100B PROTEIN CORRELATE WITH INTER-LEUKIN-6 IN PATIENTS WITH HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK"}, {"text": ". Initial values of serum S100B protein were increased (median 0.46 lg/l; interquartile range 0.16 \u00b1 3.5) and were positively correlated with IL-6 (r=0.8, p \\ 0.01), lactate (r=0.63, p\\0.01), and hospital outcome (r=0.5, p\\0.05).

These findings indicate that, except of a possible cerebral hypoperfusion, the release of S100B may be stimulated by other factors involving the inflammatory response and/or impaired tissue perfusion. INTRODUCTION. The primary aim of this survey was to assess current practice on the use of EVD for monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) and CSF drainage to treat raised ICP in TBI amongst all neurosciences centres in the United Kingdom.METHODS. Electronic questionnaires were sent to the lead clinicians in 35 adult and paediatric neuro-intensive care and neurosurgical units. A copy of the questionairre was sent by post to all non-responders. The aim was to collect data regarding the type of ICP monitor used, frequency of use of EVD and CSF drainage including indications, contraindications and complications associated with their use.RESULTS. Forty-eight completed questionaires were returned representing 31 neurosurgical and intensive care units. The response rates from the neurosurgeons and neuro-intensivists were 63% and 74% respectively. The number of severe head injuries managed per annum varied between units ranging from 50-150 cases. Sixteen percent of the units used EVD's routinely to monitor ICP, 17% reported never using this technique and the remaining 67% used it occasionally. Of the 16% who used EVD's to monitor ICP routinely only 60% used CSF drainage to treat raised ICP.Eighty percent of the units agreed that CSF drainage had an important role in the management of raised ICP compared to 20% who thought that CSF drainage was of no value. Of those that considered CSF drainage beneficial 47% would consider it to treat raised ICP in the presence of hydrocephalus, accessible or patent ventricles compared to 53% who considered when maximal medical therapy failed to control ICP or if EVD was already in situ. Seventy four percent of the units drained CSF continuously compared to 17% who drained CSF intermittently. There was considerable variability in the use of CSF drainage in relation to second tier therapies such as barbiturate coma, craniectomy and therapeutic hypothermia. Forty-eight percent of the units used it before craniectomy, 41% before barbiturate coma and 11% before therapeutic hypothermia. The reported contraindications to the placement of ventricular drains in patients with head injury inlude:slit ventricles,coagulopathy,infection, midline shift, compound or penetrating injuries and mass lesions. The complications of CSF drainage that were reported include: blockage, infection, misplacement, displacement, bleeding and administration of drugs into EVD.CONCLUSION. Though majority of the units agree that CSF drainage has got an important role in the management of ICP, there was lack of consensus on timing, indication and frequency of CSF drainage in relation to other second tier therapies. INTRODUCTION. External ventricular drainage placement is a common practice in our ICU as a diagnostic and therapeutical technique.

The studied group includes 168 patients, 56% men, of 57 \u00b1 17 year old in average. The most frequent cause of admission was subarachnoid hemorrhage (48.2%), with an APACHE II 20.69 \u00b1 8.77 and APACHE III 66.48 \u00b1 29.87. The main indication for EVD was hydrocephalia (92%). EVD were placed for 7 [4, 12] days in average. Reasons for withdrawal were cessation of the cause of indication (41%) and exitus (38%). Infection was observed in 11%, being the most frequent complication, followed by hemorrhage. Despite of being infection more frequent in EVD placed in ICU than those placed in the operating room, no significative difference was observed. On the other hand, we could find that there were significative difference in the length of EVD placement between patients without infection and patients with infection (8.13 \u00b1 6.56 vs 17.68 \u00b1 16.88 days, p \\ 0.05).

Hyperglycemia associated with pancreatogenic diabetes after pancreatic resection often causes dysregulation of liver metabolism and immune function resulting in impaired postoperative recovery. This study evaluated a closed-loop system providing continuous monitoring and strict control of perioperative blood glucose following pancreatic resection.METHODS. Thirty patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic neoplasm were prospectively randomized. Perioperative blood glucose levels were continuously monitored using an artificial endocrine pancreas (STG-22). Glucose levels were controlled using either the sliding scale method (sliding scale group, n = 13) or the artificial pancreas (artificial pancreas group, n = 17).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 169, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "In the sliding scale group, postoperative blood glucose levels rose initially before reaching a plateau of approximately 200 mg/dl between 4 and 6 hours after pancreatectomy. The levels remained high for 18 hours postoperatively. In the artificial pancreas group, blood glucose levels reduced steadily, reaching the target zone (80 -110 mg/dl) by 6 hours postsurgery. Total insulin administered per patient during the first postoperative 18 hours was significantly higher in the artificial pancreas group (107 \u00b1 109 IU) compared to the sliding scale group (8 \u00b1 6 IU; P \\ 0.01). Neither group showed hypoglycemia.CONCLUSION. Perioperative use of an artificial endocrine pancreas to control pancreatogenic diabetes after pancreatic resection is an easy and effective way to maintain near-normal blood glucose levels. The artificial pancreas promises to revolutionize insulin treatment for patients with pancreatogenic diabetes after pancreatic resection. METHODS. Fifty-two patients undergoing operation of abdomen were allocated, after randomization, to two groups to receive isonitrogenous and isoenergetic TPN over 5 days.

However there are suggestions that insulin infusions can enhance glucose conversion to lactate via stimulation of glycolytic enzyme activities 2. At our institution 50% dextrose 50ml + 50u insulin (DI) and 50ml N. saline+50 u insulin sliding scale (ISS) are used to maintain intra-operative TGC during cardiac operations, depending on anaesthetist preference. Higher blood lactate levels were observed among patients who needed treatment for TGC than in patients who did not need treatment (No treatment). Aim of this audit is to identify the effects of our current management of blood sugar control on hyperlactatemia.METHODS. We audited demographic data, co-morbid conditions, type of operation, type of treatment were recorded in 246 unselected consecutive patients who underwent on pump and off pump cardiac operations (intra-op procedure) during 3 months period. Arterial blood gas (ABG) samples were retrieved from the ABG machine database to analyse the lactate levels and blood sugar control.RESULTS. 246 patients (male 80.9% & female 19.1%, mean age 67.47yrs, SD \u00b19.785yrs) underwent cardiac operations out of which 12 patients were excluded due to no regular ABG results. Intra-operative procedures, blood sugar & lactate levels are presented in Table 1 .Average blood sugar and lactate levels of each patient during 1st 3 hours considered as the outcome variable for assessing the statistical significance. Intra operative procedure has no significant effect on the intra operative blood sugar levels. Significant blood sugar differences were seen between no treatment vs DI (P=0.003), ISS vs DI (P=0.001). Both intra-operative procedure and treatment is significantly associated with intra-operative lactate levels (P=0.001, P=0.002). There were no significant differences in the mean lactate levels of ISS and DI groups. However the ''No treatment group'' has shown the least average intra-operative lactate levels and it was significantly different form the other 2 methods of treatment. METHODS.

We decided to stop gelafundin infusion, and treat those clinical signs and symptoms with hydrocorthisone 100 mg, ranitidine 50 mg, and dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg, and all the symptomatology partially disappeared. After 24 h. the patient was discharged from ICU without any complications. Prick test was performed after 4 weeks with positive result.RESULTS. The incidence of anaphylactic reactions with colloids varies between 0033% -0219% (2). In most cases (90%) clinical reactions are at least grade II and mortality is 3 6%. There are some risk factors associated with allergic reactions to colloids: male sex, previous drug allergy, and gelatine or dextrane infusion. It has even been recommended that gelatins be avoided in patients with a known history of drug allergy (2) . In those cases the safest alternative would be hydroxyethyl starch with a slower frequency of allergic reactions (0058% -00085%). This patient had drug allergy as a unique risk factor to colloids allergy. Clinical signs and symptoms following so closely after gelatine infusion, strongly indicates an anaphylactic reaction. Cause-effect relation was confirmed after 4 weeks with a positive result for skin tests.CONCLUSION. Although the incidence of severe reaction to colloids is low, it must not be ignored, because colloids infusions are an extremely frequent practice in medicine. Gelatin and dextrane infusion must be avoided in patients with a previous history of drug allergy. METHODS. Tertiary referral centre.

Patients with unfavourable outcome (7 in period 1 and 12 in period 2) were presently left out of this analysis. Data were analysed using Pearson's Chi-square test.RESULTS. 252 patients were admitted after cardiac arrest, of whom 203 could at this time be evaluated. Hospital survival with concomitant good outcome after cardiac arrest had improved in period 2 (p=0.04). This was caused by a strong significant increase in survival with good neurological outcome after IHCA (p=0.01). We found however no improvement of good outcome after OHCA. There were no important baseline differences between the two year-groups, except for an (expected) increase in frequency of acute coronary interventions. INTRODUCTION. Septic shock is the main cause of mortality in our ICU units. In these type of patiens multiorgan dysfunction and ARF are common and worsens prognosis. Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) have become an important cornerstone in septic support measures. Renal dose above 35 ml/kg/h has been stablished as the goal standard in critically ill patients with ARF. Sepsis dose has not been still defined as many studies propose higher doses in septic shock patients.

Presentation of this data allows evaluation of the incidences and outcomes from cardiac arrest. In an age of early warning systems, Outreach and Medical Emergency teams there is ever increasing interest around inhospital cardiac arrests. It is well recognised that many cardiac arrests, particularly those presenting with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole are predictable and potentially preventable consequences of suboptimal medical care. Southend hospital is a large district hospital serving an aged population of approximately 300,000. The aim of this audit was to establish the incidence, type and outcome from cardiac arrest occurring amongst in patients on the acute wards at our hospital. The secondary aims were to highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses of our acute care services, and to guide future developments.METHODS. Data collected daily by the Resuscitation Officer was retrospectively analysed for all ward cardiac arrests occurring between 1 June 2005 and 31 May 2007. The hospital PAS system was used to determine long term outcome for patients surviving to and beyond hospital discharge. Cardiac arrest was defined as loss of spontaneous circulation. Data from the Accident Centre, Critical Care Unit, Theatres and out patient areas was excluded. RESULTS. 17 patients did not survive whereas 14 patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the surviving patients four were classified GOS 2, one GOS 3, two GOS 4 and seven GOS 5. PCT obtained within 24 hours of admission was significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. A statistically significant difference between those two groups could not be established for NSE, CRP or lactate. In addition we found a highly significant correlation between GOS at hospital discharge and PCT-levels during the first 24 hours after ICUadmission (Pearson r=-0.56, p=0.0018). CONCLUSION.

Induced therapeutic hypothermia improves neurological outcome after cardiac arrest, but there is strong evidence in animal models that delays in introduction of cooling negates its beneficial effects. The effectiveness of a new device in rapid induction of cooling using nasopharyngeal approach was shown in this preliminary investigation of post resuscitation cardiac arrest patients.METHODS. Seven patients after succesful resuscitation from cardiac arrest were included into the study. Following standard diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, therapeutic hypothermia (TH) was induced by evaporisation of aerosolized perfluorchemical (PFC) into the nasopharyngeal cavity using a nasal tubing set (RhinoChill device, BeneChill Inc. San Diego, USA) to achieve cerebral and systemic hypothermia. Temperature measurements were continously taken throughout induction and maintanance of hypothermia via tympanic (Ttymp) and arterial catheter (Tcore). After achieving a target temperature (Ttarget) of 33\u00b0C in one of the measurement sites, the cooling method was switched to standard sytemic cooling and maintained for 24 hrs. The therapeutic range was defined as 32-34\u00b0C with a Ttarget of 33\u00b0C.RESULTS. The mean age of the patients was 78 years, the mean time from cardiac arrest to succesful ROSC was 22 min. Core temperature on admission was 35,8\u00b0C (mean). Application time of the RhinoChill device was 80,3 min (mean) from start of the nasal cooling; the therapeutic range (34\u00b0C) could be reached in 42 min (mean-Ttymp) and in 84 min (mean-Tcore). Ttarget was achieved within 67 min (mean-Ttymp) and 115 min (mean-Tcore) representing a cooling rate of 2,52\u00b0C/hr (Ttymp) and 1,6\u00b0C/hr (Tcore). Good recovery was achieved in 2 patients, 1 was neurologically impaired, 4 patients died.CONCLUSION. Evaporative nasopharyngeal cooling using a PFC rapidly decreases Ttymp and Tcore and provides rapid establishment of therapeutic hypothermia immediately after admission in the ICU. The added benefit of rapid early cooling on outcome remains to be demonstrated. 1.

The patient complained numbness, dizziness and ascending paresthesia. Important features of ECG consisted of ventricular bigeminism, then severe bradycardia (20 bpm), long QTc (524 msec) and polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles. Activated charcoal was administered but no gastric lavage was performed seeing severe arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise. Saline infusion, atropine (3 mg loading dose, and 0.5 mg/6 hours during 48 hours) and magnesium sulfate (6 g loading dose, and 3 g/24 hours for 48 hours) were administered to treat hypotension, muscarinic signs and arrhythmias, respectively. Plasma magnesium levels remained below 4 mmol/L. Symptoms rapidly disappeared and return to regular sinus rhythm (86 bpm) was observed. Further evolution was uneventful.RESULTS. Aconitine is the main toxic alkaloid in monkshood. LD50 is about 5 mg which represents 2 to 4 grams of crushed roots. Cardiac and neurological toxicities, as well as increased vagal tone, are due to activation of voltage-dependent sodium channels. Cardiotoxicity consists in early and delayed afterdepolarisation. Indeed, during late repolarisation (phase 4 of the action potential) of the Purkinje cells, aconitine-attached Na channels open, allowing sodium influx and depolarization (''delayed afterdepolarization''). This results in increased automaticity (premature ventricular beats). During late phase 2 or early phase 3 (repolarisation), aconitine-induced Na accumulation induces depolarization (''early afterdepolarisation''). This results in long QT interval with a risk of torsades de pointes. Antiarrhythmic agents have inconstant results in aconite intoxication. Especially amiodarone could promote torsades de pointes. The effects of magnesium sulfate on aconitine-induced ventricular arrhythmias have been studied in animal models (1) . In contrast to other antiarrhythmic agents, it abolishes early afterdepolarisation and shortens the prolonged duration of the Purkinje cell action potential.CONCLUSION. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of aconitine-induced polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias successfully treated with magnesium sulfate.

Emergency medicine trainees have wide exposure in managing acute medical and surgical emergencies. Furthermore, as shown in the curricula the basic training for both anaesthetic and emergency medicicne are the same. This give emergency medicine trainees a good platform for further training in ICM. Emergency medicine trainees lack the experience of managing patients on ventilators in comparison to anaesthetic trainees. However, the increase use of non-invasive ventilators in emergency medicine department helps them in understanding the principles of ventilators and respiratory physiology. Emergency medicine is a rapidly changing speciality in United Kingdom with more onus on emergency physicians to diagnose and stabilise patients in emergency department prior to transfer. Therefore emergency medicine trainees should be encouraged and treated equally with their anaesthetic colleagues in the pursuit of a career in ICM. INTRODUCTION. Emergencies in cardiology are among the key demands of therapy in emergency and critically ill patients. Medical simulation used in combination with traditional training methods can provide a comprehensive learning opportunity that allows the clinician to safely learn, practice, and repeat the procedures until proficiency is achieved. Our objective was to address the use of medical simulation as a way for medical learners to acquire and maintain skills needed to manage emergencies in cardiology; to evaluate the students satisfaction with the course.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Differences"}, {"text": "The study was performed at Berkeley Training Center -Brazil, between March 2002 and December 2006, with a total number of 497 trainees. Trainees received a baseline evaluation (n=283) followed by an 8 hour-training sessions that involved an introdutory lecture, skills management with mannequin simulator, clinical scenarios for training ACLS algorithm, and instructor-facilitated debriefings. After finishing the course, the trainees were retested and completed a numerical scale survey (n=497) of their perceptions about the course (1= poor, 2= fair, 3= good, and 4 =excellent).RESULTS. The study was performed at Berkeley Training Center -Brazil, between March 2002 and December 2006, with a total number of 497 trainees.

The extremely positive response to simulation-based training on emergencies in cardiology found in this study suggests that this training modality may be valuable in the training of medical students and physicians. Most students considered the course excellent. Simulation-based training is expected to become routine in many health care settings in the coming decade. (1) . Skilled assistance must be available to assist the anaesthetist as Gwinnutt suggests an increased incidence of failed intubations in A&E (2) . The AAGBI state that standards of anaesthesia must be the same as those in theatre(3). Transfer of critically ill patients poses a significant risk. Transporting within hospital is often poorly managed & Andrews et al (5) state that patients deteriorate significantly during such transfers. Our objective was to identify & aim to minimise risks when undertaking anaesthesia in the non-theatre environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1550, "end": 1553, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1696, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1920, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "METHODS. The audit was undertaken in 2006 and reaudited in 2008. Trainees in a department covering 2 large district general hospitals, each with separate A&E, radiology and critical care facilities, received a questionnaire. The questions concentrated on training & orientation of A&E, radiology and equipment. Anaesthesia standards for intra-hospital patient transfer & anaesthesia in A&E were audited according to the RCoA (6).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "REFERENCE(S"}, {"text": "The results demonstrated deficits in training & knowledge of the equipment & assistance. 71.4% of trainees responded & only 5% had received training in anaesthesia in non-theatre environments within the last year; 13% had received a orientation session. During transfers 65% patients had minimal monitoring, 28% patients had no physiological parameters recorded despite transfer up to 135 min. 67% trainees believed their assistant was suitably trained for induction of anaesthesia & 14.7% described poor assistance with RSI; 21% found minimal monitoring unavailable.CONCLUSION. Changes implemented included the creation of transfer training for trainees. A 24 hr outreach service has now been created in one hospital & a vital part of the role is to support anaesthetists; this data was a major part of the business case to justify its establishment. Reaudit of trainees demonstrated a substantial improvement, but training in emergency situations has now been set up. We recommend that all ICU review their training for the nontheatre environment. New staff should undergo an orientation that is regularly up-dated. We believe that trainees should undergo specific training & demonstrate proficiency in anaesthesia in the non-theatre environment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS."}]}
