BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis, hepatobiliary disease, and proximal gastrointestinal tract disorders are well recognized clinical situations where delivery of nutrients via jejunostomy tube is preferable to a feeding gastrostomy. Presently, placement of jejunostomy feeding catheters requires laparotomy. A thorough description of the percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) technique and practical guidelines for its use in dogs have not been described. AIM: To adapt a simple technique of PEJ tube placement in humans for use in healthy dogs, and to evaluate the practicality and potential complications associated with short-term PEJ tube use.",

This technique requires passage of the endoscope deeply into the small intestine where a guide wire is then passed through the accessory channel. A 12 F jejunostomy feeding catheter is next advanced over the guide wire as the endoscope is removed from the dog. Using a unique intermediary maneuver, the proximal (orad) end of the guide wire is identified, pulled through the gastrostomy tube, and the PEJ tube is advanced over the guide wire into the jejunum. The following parameters were evaluated in all dogs for 14 days following PEJ placement: attitude/activity, temperature, infection at tube site, tube migration/clogging, and nutritional status. Seven dogs were bolus-fed enteral diets via PEJ tube.",

Delayed gastric emptying is involved in the pathogenesis of many conditions in the horse and may be difficult to diagnose clinically. The 13 C-octanoic acid breath test ( 13 C-OABT), a non-invasive stable isotope technique, has been shown to correlate closely to radioscintigraphy for the measurement of gastric emptying indices in healthy horses.

Probiotic therapy is becoming popular in veterinary medicine, however probiotics have not been shown to be effective for the treatment or prevention of any condition in horses. This may be due, in part, to a lack of proper in vitro testing of potential probiotic isolates. Further, probiotic organisms of equineorigin may be preferable for use in horses, as equine-origin organisms may be better adapted to survival in the equine gastrointestinal tract than organisms isolated from other species.

Hyperekplexia in humans responds dramatically although not completely to the benzodiazepine drug clonazepam, which enhances gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Low levels of CSF GABA have been reported in human patients.

Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for head trauma patients. It provides rapid acquisition of images, superior bone detail, and better visualization of acute hemorrhage than magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. It is also less expensive and more readily available. Computed tomography images are used to determine if the patient would benefit from decompressive surgery. In some cases, surgery may be postponed pending decline in neurological status.

Further studies are underway to identify other affected Staffordshire Bull Terriers and to culture cell lines for chemical and metabolic analysis. Future research efforts are proposed to focus on genetic studies and potential treatments. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare myelography and computed tomographic myelography (CTM) findings in dogs with spinal cord compression. We hypothesized that CTM would most closely match neurological abnormalities and would most accurately predict the degree of spinal cord compression observed at surgery. The study population included 101 dogs who were presented to VMRCVM between January 1992 and October 1997 for clinical signs related to spinal cord dysfunction. Films for each modality were independently reviewed by two board-certified veterinary radiologists. Readers were unaware of the signalment or clinical history. For each dog and each modality, the location of compression relative to the spinal cord was recorded and the severity of spinal cord compression was graded (0 \u03ed none, 3 \u03ed severe). Diameters of the dural sac were measured at 3 vertebral locations by a third observer who was unaware of radiographic grades. Severity of neurological abnormalities was recorded using a grading scale (0 \u03ed normal, 5 \u03ed no deep pain). The degree of compression described in surgery reports was also graded (0 \u03ed none, 3 \u03ed severe). Relationships between severity of clinical signs and the degree of compression noted on myelogram, CTM and surgery were determined using Spearman's correlation. Agreement between the two modalities for compression severity rating and compression measurements was evaluated using scatterplots and agreement plots. There was a significant correlation between the two modalities for estimated severity of spinal cord compression (p\u03fd0.0001), although the degree of compression recorded with CTM was consistently higher compared to myelogram results. There was no correlation between the severity of neurological abnormalities or the severity of compression observed at surgery and the severity of spinal cord compression with neither imaging modality. A significant correlation was found between severity of neurological abnormalities and degree of spinal cord compression observed at surgery (p\u03fd0.0005). We conclude that the severity of clinical signs is still the best predictor of the degree of spinal cord compression in dogs. Both myelography and CTM are helpful for identifying the anatomical location of compression, but neither should be used to predict the degree of spinal cord damage. Our choice to use transverse CT images only may have limited our ability to appreciate changes in spinal cord diameter. In the clinical setting, sagittal and dorsal planar reformatted images are recommended. Fort Dodge Animal Health has released a conditionally approved vaccine against S. neurona.

Fourteen of the 20 were also CSF positive initially, with 6 showing borderline immunoreactivity. All 14 demonstrated IgG increases postvaccination. Of the 6 originally CSF WB negative, 4 were retapped postvaccination with 2 testing borderline positive and 2 testing positive. Persistence of the vaccine induced response was not evaluated in the current study, but it would be of interest. Although the study size was small, no immunoreactive bands or banding patterns were noted that could distinguish the IgG response of naturally infected from that of vaccinated horses. This has the potential to confound diagnostic testing for EPM on vaccinated horses, at least on a temporary basis, and should be taken into consideration when electing to vaccinate. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) induces a lifelong persistent infection of horses. Infected horses may undergo acute and chronic stages of disease characterized by recurrent episodes of viremia, fever, and thrombocytopenia, followed by an inapparent carrier stage with no clinical signs. Genetic and antigenic variation are well-recognized as mechanisms of persistence of EIAV and are thought to account for the recurrent nature of the disease. The persistence of antigenic variant virus has significantly hampered development of an effective vaccine for EIAV. Genetic variation within the surface envelope glycoprotein (SU) of EIAV occurs predominantly within 8 defined variable regions (V1 to V8); the third variable region, V3, contains the principal neutralizing domain (PND). The goal of this study was to use infectious molecular clones to better understand the specificity and development of neutralizing antibody during infection.",

Clostridial myositis or clostridial myonecrosis is a rapidly progressive, often fatal condition with liquefactive necrosis of muscle, gas formation, and associated clinical signs and toxemia. A majority of equine cases are a result of intramuscular injection; however, it is not clear whether clostridial organisms are inoculated or are preexisting in the skeletal muscle. This study was designed to determine the presence of dormant clostridial spores in skeletal muscle. Muscle samples were obtained from 28 horses that were euthanatized for reason unrelated to infectious disease, shock or trauma. Aseptic surgical technique was used to obtain 1.5 cm 3 muscle samples from the cervical region. Immediately after the muscle samples were obtained, they were plunged into 70% isopropyl alcohol for 1 minute, placed into a sterile container, and frozen at \u03ea80\u040aC until further analyzed. For analysis, muscle samples were anaerobically cultured at 37\u040aC in a brain-heart-infusion broth for 4 days. After 4 days, 1 ml of broth/muscle homogenate was mixed in a sterile screw-cap tube with 1 ml of 95% ethanol. The specimen was gently mixed at room temperature for 60 min. The ethanol treated homogenate was inoculated onto blood agar and incubated anaerobically at 37\u040aC for up to 5 days. Morphology and growth of colonies was assessed.

Records of 700 biopsies submitted to the Neuromuscular Diagnostic Laboratory were searched to identify QHs or QH crosses diagnosed with PSSM for at least 1 yr. Seventy six QHs were selected from \u03fe200 PSSM cases. Owners had received written recommendations to gradually increase daily exercise, maximize turnout, feed grass hay and replace grain in the diet with a fat supplement such as 1-4 lbs/day of rice bran. 39/76 PSSM horseowners were available for a telephone interview and 21/76 also provided responses about another healthy horse to form a case control. Gender ratio, temperament and muscle build were similar between PSSM and controls. More PSSM horses (21% vs controls 14%) had a history of respiratory disease and 63% of these PSSM horses developed Rh at that time with muscle wasting, pyrexia and no muscle cramping. Rh began between 3 mo. and 14 yrs of age (mean 4.8 \u03ee 3.6yrs) in PSSM horses and was not present in controls. Clinical signs, in order of frequency, included muscle stiffness and pain (primarily hind limb, back and abdominal muscles), muscle fasiculations, sweating, exercise intolerance, muscle wasting, and colic. Prior to PSSM diagnosis, 87% of PSSM and 95% of controls were fed grain, and 14% of controls (0% PSSM) were fed a fat supplement. Prior to diagnosis, 44% of PSSM horses were getting little to no exercise (14% for controls). After PSSM diagnosis, 82% of owners decreased the amount of grain, added a fat supplement and/or provided more regular and more frequent exercise. Half of the owners complied with all diet and training recommendations resulting in 94% of these horses improving and 83% never having another episode of Rh. Noncompliance of the other 50% of owners, was due to 28% not adjusting the diet, 50% not adjusting training and 22% not adjusting diet and training. In this group, 50% of horses had further episodes of Rh. In all of the cases that did not decrease in severity or frequency either one or both of exercise/diet recommendation were not followed. This study indicates that PSSM can be managed successfully by increasing the fat and decreasing the starch content of the diet combined with a gradual increase in the amount of daily exercise. Diet or exercise regimes alone are not the cause of PSSM since PSSM horses were managed similarly to healthy control horses prior to the time of diagnosis. Thus, there is likely a genetic predisposition to Rh with PSSM that can be influenced by factors such as respiratory disease, dietary starch and carbohydrate content as well as amount of daily exercise.

Fifty percent reduction of the dorsal myelographic column (DMC) at a given intervertebral site compared to the corresponding maximum intravertebral DMC is commonly stated as the diagnostic criterion for cervical spinal cord compression. However, this has been reported to be inadequate. A reduction of the dorsal myelographic column to a width of 2 mm has also been suggested.

Screening tests are commonly utilized by equine practitioners for identifying foals with failure of passive transfer (FPT). However, there is limited knowledge of the reliability of the test results. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of five FPT screening tests were critically evaluated using serum from 203 foals that were between 24-72 hours of age. Two commercial ELISA tests (Cite and SNAP, Idexx Inc) and a latex agglutination test (Foalcheck, Haver Moby Corp) were run according to the manufacturers instructions. Non-commercial tests (glutaraldehyde coagulation test and modified zinc sulfate turbidity test) were also performed. Radial immunodiffusion (RID) for equine IgG (VMRD Inc.) was used as the gold standard for determining each foal's serum IgG concentration. The results of the screening tests were compared to the results of the equine RID IgG test. The sensitivity and specificity for each screening test were determined for serum IgG concentration at both breakpoints, \u03fd800 mg/dl and \u03fd400 mg/dl. All screening tests were not performed on each foal.",

The purpose of this effort is to characterize it in 5 neonatal foals from diverse geographical origins. History and physical examination findings, CBC, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, skin and bone marrow biopsy results, treatments and outcomes of foals were gathered from 3 referral hospitals (1998) (1999) (2000) . Three thoroughbred (TB) and 2 warmblood/paint foals from multiparous mares presented at \u03fd 4 days of age with ulceration of the tongue and oral mucous membranes and generalized multiple small crusts. Four of the 5 foals had petechiae and 2 had bleeding tendencies. Two mares had affected foals on 2 successive years but were bred to different sires. Similar drugs were not administered, either topically or systemically, to the mares during pregnancy or to the foals. All foals had IgG \u03fe1200 mg/dL. All foals were thrombocytopenic (0-30,000/uL), leukopenic (2900-3200/uL), neutropenic (500-1768/uL) and 4/5 had a left shift (90-780/uL). The PTT (55 and 118 s) was prolonged in 2/4. A normal bone marrow biopsy was obtained (1/1). Corticosteroids were given to 3 foals before the skin biopsy was taken. Histopathology of the skin in all foals showed subepidermal clefting with subjacent vascular dilation, dermal hemorrhage and superficial papillary necrosis. All foals were given gastric ulcer prophylaxis, 4/5 broad-spectrum antibiotics, and 3/5 corticosteroids. Whole blood (1L) was administered to 2 foals and platelet rich plasma (2 \u03eb 4 units) was given to another. The mucosal and skin lesions improved in 7 days (5/5). Platelet counts gradually increased to \u03fe50,000 after 12 days (3/5) whereas 2 foals had persistent thrombocytopenia and were given corticosteroids for 19 days. Foals were hospitalized for 4-33 days and were healthy 5-24 months later.

Multivariate models were developed predicting both selenium status and actual blood selenium concentration. Factors significantly associated with selenium deficiency included geographic area, pasture application of either manure or lime, specific pasture plants and provision of trace meneralized salt. Factors significantly associated with blood selenium concentration included geographic area, cow body condition, creep feeding, pasture application of commercial fertilizer, manure or lime and specific pature plants. Lactoferrin is a non-heme associated iron-binding apoprotein, present in many body secretions, colostrum, and neutrophil (PMN) granules. Biological effects ascribed to LF include iron binding, LPS binding, and alteration in PMN and lymphocyte function. LF prevents LPS binding to leukocytes and limits PMN priming or cytokine release. Recent work in our lab indicates LF increases PMN superoxide production ex vivo. Studies of mammary leukocytes indicate a distinct role of LF in phenotype, tissue persistence and proliferative ability of leukocytes depending upon concentrations of LF. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of LF to alter proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PI) exposed to LPS. We also examined the role of exogenous iron (FE) on proliferative responses of mononuclear cells in the presence or absence of LF.",

Mononuclear cells were then centrifuged over Ficoll-sodium diatrazoate. Cells were enumerated, and viability determined and approximately 4 \u03eb 10 6 cells were placed into individual tissue culture plate wells. Cells were treated with LF (200 ng/ml) or medium alone followed by LPS stimulation (1 g/ml) and allowed to incubate for 72 hours after which time 3 [H]-thymidine was added. Cell labeling was allowed for 24 hours. The cells were then harvested unto a filter mat and 3 [H]-thymidine incorporation was determined in a gamma counter. In several additional experiments, the effects of LF on lymphocyte proliferation were further studied by examining the role of exogenous iron in lymphocyte proliferation. LF in vitro, reduced LPS-induced cell proliferation index (PI) significantly (LF \u03e9 LPS \u03ed 1.38 \u03e9 0.9; LPS \u03ed 14 \u03e9 13; p\u03fd0.001). LF by itself reduced incorporation of label in vitro (PI \u03ed 0.73 \u03e9 0.42). To determine if the effects of LF were due to iron sequestration in the medium, we added Fe at two concentrations (1mM and 10 nM) and repeated the above experiments. Iron at the higher concentration significantly increased the PI of all treatments suggesting that Fe becomes limiting in vitro, or induces some oxidative stress leading to DNA repair, which increased incorporation. The lower concentration produced mild increases in PI compared to no additional Fe treatments. Our study suggests that LF reduces mononuclear cell proliferation associated with LPS exposure. This reduction in PI suggests LF prevents LPS interaction with the cell and may also sequester Fe, a necessary factor for cell proliferation. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of clinical and laboratory covariates (age, infection site and dehydration) on the relationship between failure of passive transfer (FPT) assays (serum protein, plasma protein, percentage of optical density measured from the zinc sulphate (ZnS) turbidity test, semiquantitative interpretation of the ZnS turbidity test and the serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity (GGT)) and RID.",

The results presented suggest that it would be hazardous to use the different FPT assays without considering identified significant covariates. In cattle with Bovine Pneumonic Pasteurellosis (BPP), the host immune response has been implicated to play a significant role in causing much of the pulmonary injury that occurs. Traditionally, antibiotics are used to treat BPP, although some producers also administer corticosteroids in an attempt to reduce pulmonary inflammation by limiting the host immune response.

Scintigraphic evaluation of abomasal emptying was carried out in six healthy male Holstein calves. The calves were fed 10% of their body weight daily as whole cow's milk that was divided equally and consumed as two feedings via a nipple bottle. One day before the nuclear scintigraphic procedure, the calves were randomly fed whole cows milk or an oral rehydration solution containing bicarbonate and high levels of soluble fiber was fed for three consecutive feedings an hour before the portion of milk. For each calf, both feeding programs were repeated twice at a one-week interval. Immediately following administration of the 99mTC-sulfur colloid containing milk, the calves were imaged with the gamma camera positioned lateral and ventral to the abomasum. Additional right lateral and ventral views of the abomasum were collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 minutes after administration of the radionuclide. Blood glucose determination were performed at one-hour intervals for seven hours after feeding milk to evaluate milk digestibility in both feeding programs. Baseline glucose values during the first three hours of the experiment were not significantly different between both feeding programs. Baseline number of radionuclide counts from the lateral and the ventral view of the abomasum were not significantly different between both feeding programs. In addition, there were no significant treatment effects on the number of radionuclide counts from both views during scintigraphic evaluations. We successfully developed an in vivo method of measuring abomasal emptying and showed that an oral electrolyte containing a small amount of bicarbonate did not interfere with milk clotting. This is the first time nuclear scintigraphy has been used to study milk clotting and abomasal emptying in calves. The increasing value of replacement dairy heifers has placed greater emphasis on colostrum feeding, a key element for neonatal calf health. While colostrum immune factors are essential for health, bacterial contamination may negate some benefits. From our calf health problem investigations, 82% of colostrum samples exceeded the industry standard of 100,000 cfu/ml. Many of these colostrum samples grew more than 1,000,000 cfu/ml but there is limited data on the impact of these excessive colostrum bacterial counts on calf health. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bacterial contamination (total, fecal coliform, other gram-negative bacteria, mastitis and environmental Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species) on neonatal calf health.",

Systemic hypertension is a common problem in cats. While previous studies suggest the classic renin-angiotensin system is not activated in all cats with elevated blood pressure, the intrarenal or other local renin-angiotensin systems may be involved in the genesis of this hypertension. As converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be only modestly effective antihypertensive agents in this species, it may be that another approach to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system will prove efficacious as antihypertensive therapy. We evaluated the usefulness of the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, losartan (Cozaar), as an oral antihypertensive agent in cats.

Cats dosed with 5mg of Cozaar and injected with 1 g of A1 4 hours after the dosing of Cozaar averaged a 39mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure. The cats demonstrated a similar increment in systolic blood pressure following dosing with 10 and 50mg Cozaar. The latter dosage is similar to the usual recommended daily dosage for human beings. Further dosing of losartan at 150mg for 3 consecutive days yielded no significant decrease in baseline blood pressure or in the pressor response to angiotensin I injection. The results indicate that losartan did not have a significant or consistent effect on feline blood pressure or pressor response to AI administration. Our study failed to provide evidence of potential for antihypertensive efficacy of losartan in cats. Valvular pulmonic stenosis (PS) reportedly is the third most common congenital heart defect in the dog. The severity of PS can be graded as mild (16-49 mmHg), moderate (50-79 mmHg), or severe (\u03fe 80 mmHg) based on Doppler derived estimates of transpulmonic pressure gradients (DEG). Additionally, PS may be considered severe with a DEG \u03fd 80 mmHg if marked right ventricular hypertrophy or significant clinical signs such as collapse, exercise intolerance or ascites are present. Mild and moderate PS is not thought to cause a reduction in either quality or quantity of life. Dogs with severe PS are more likely to present and/or develop clinical signs including sudden death. Current recommended therapy for severe PS includes balloon valvuloplasty (BV) or surgical vavulotomy. There are few reports of the benefits of BV in the dog and current recommendations are based on the positive results of BV in human patients with PS.",

Additionally, BV may decrease symptoms and thus improve quality of life in dogs with severe PS. Artificial cardiac pacing is a well-recognized treatment for symptomatic bradycardia in dogs. Ventricular demand pacemakers (VVI) that serve to pace the ventricle during periods of ventricular asystole are most commonly employed. This pacemaker system is unable to maintain atrioventricular (AV) synchrony and is therefore considered non-physiologic. A newer physiologic, single lead pacemaker system (VDD) utilizes two floating atrial electrodes (FAE) to sense native atrial activity. After detection of atrial depolarization and pausing for a programmable AV delay, the VDD system delivers a pacing stimulus to the ventricle thereby simulating the normal sequence of cardiac depolarization. The purposes of this study were 1) to determine the feasibility of physiologic single lead pacing in dogs with third degree AV block and 2) to determine if VDD pacing, in comparison to VVI pacing, displays improvements in acute hemodynamic variables.",

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in boxer dogs is an inherited disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, sudden death, and, less frequently, congestive heart failure (CHF). The objective of this study was to perform HRV analysis in boxer dogs, and study the hypothesis that a reduction in HRV indices could be identified in dogs with cardiomyopathy.",

No differences were identified between unaffected boxers in Group 1 and affected boxers in Group 2 for any of the tested parameters.

For SDNN, a significant reduction was identified between controls and unaffected boxers, but not between controls and affected boxers. Although ASDNN was reduced in Group 1 and 2 dogs compared to nonboxer controls, the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that (1) HRV is significantly decreased in boxer dogs with CHF compared to non-CHF dogs; (2) HRV does not appear to distinguish unaffected boxer dogs from boxers dogs with ventricular arrhythmias; and (3) boxers have evidence of reduced HRV relative to normal controls, however, these differences are inconsistent and of uncertain clinical significance. Additional studies of larger populations are needed to address these issues more completely. Doppler echocardiography may be used to noninvasively evaluate left ventricular diastolic function.

MVG is proving to be a promising tool in the investigation of diastolic dysfunction in feline cardiac diseases. Ticlopidine (Ticlid) is a thienopyridine derivative with potent antithrombotic properties and is commonly used for the prevention of cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction and stenosis of coronary arterial stents in human medicine. Ticlopidine prevents primary and secondary platelet aggregation via irreversible antagonism of ADP-sensitive receptors on the platelet membrane. The ADPinduced conformational change of the platelet membrane GPIIb/IIIa complex is also antagonized preventing binding of vWF and fibrinogen. Ticlopidine does not appear to have any direct effect on platelets but undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to form one or more active metabolites. Therefore, ex vivo and in vivo methods are used to determine the pharmacodynamics and effective dosing protocol in the species of interest. Ticlopidine has never been evaluated in the cat. Feline systemic arterial thromboembolization (FATE) is commonly associated with myocardial disease and platelets have been suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis.

The prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was highest (41.5%), followed by restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) (15%), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (7.5%) and unclassified cardiomyopathy (UCM) (7.5%). One cat showed echocardiographic changes compatible with a moderator band cardiomyopathy (MBCM). Thirteen different breeds were represented, the most common being domestic shorthaired (57.5%). The mean (\u03eeSD, range) age of cats with cardiomyopathy at presentation was 6.8 (4.3, 0.5 to 16) years, with an equal distribution between males and females. Clinical findings, electrocardiographic changes and radiographic abnormalities were also reviewed. Dyspnoea was a major presenting complaint in all forms of cardiomyopathy but was most prevalent in DCM cases (82%). Cats with HCM were least likely to be dyspnoeic but most likely to have a heart murmur. ECG abnormalities were present in 30% of cases. All cats with DCM showed generalised cardiomegaly on radiography compared to 59% of cats with HCM. 90% of DCM cats had a pleural effusion compared to 7% of HCM cases. The median survival time for 73 cats was 300 days. Significantly greater survival time was observed for cats with UCM when compared with those with RCM (P\u03fd0.05) or DCM (P\u03fd0.05). Cats with HCM that survived longer than 30 days after diagnosis showed a significantly greater survival time when compared to cats with DCM (P\u03fd0.001). Evaluation of the success of various treatment regimes used was not possible due to variations with time and the number of clinicians involved. Chronic rhinitis in cats is often refractory to conventional therapy and can pose a significant threat to cats with refractory disease due to anorexia and lethargy. There is circumstantial evidence that the chronic rhinitis syndrome may represent an ineffective immune response to persistent viral infection in cats. Studies in mice and dogs have shown that systemic administration of lipid-DNA complexes (CLDC) is a potent stimulus for activation of innate immune responses and release of Th1 cytokines. The Th1 type cytokines released (including IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IFN-alpha) have all been shown to have antiviral activity and thus might be expected to improve the clinical signs in cats if a viral etiology underlies the chronic rhinitis syndrome. We hypothesized therefore that administration of CLDC encoding the feline IL-2 gene to cats with chronic rhinitis would induce a Th1-type immune response that would in turn decrease clinical signs of disease.",

The absolute limit of detection of the PCR was determined by serially diluting plasmids containing B. gibsoni and B. canis 18S rDNA gene inserts into Tris-EDTA buffer, and using these dilutions as template for the outer primer pair. The practical limit of detection was determined by serially diluting B. gibsoni or B. canis infected blood of known parasitemia into non-infected canine blood, and using these dilutions as template for the PCR. Specificity was determined by using canine, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium and Neospora DNA as template, and testing the specific primers against the other Babesia species and subspecies. 149 dogs from kennels where B. gibsoni had been diagnosed and 359 dogs from animal shelters were tested for anti-Babesia antibodies by IFA.

Giardia spp. infection of cats is thought to be common; prevalence in cats with diarrhea residing in north central Colorado is 3.9%. Fecal flotation is indicated for the evaluation of all cats with diarrhea to look for parasite eggs, oocysts, and cysts; microscopic examination of feces after use of the zinc sulfate centrifugation technique (ZNSO 4 ) is considered optimal by many for detection of Giardia spp. cysts. ZNSO 4 is thought to occasionally result in false-negative results when Giardia spp. cysts are overlooked due to their small size and falsepositive results when other material like yeast bodies and plant material are confused with Giardia cysts. To aid in the diagnosis of giardiasis, assays that utilize antibodies to detect either free antigen or Giardia cysts in feces have been developed.. The purpose of this study was to compare results of ZNSO 4 flotation, a Giardia-antigen assay, and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the detection of Giardia infection using feces from experimentally inoculated cats.",

Mast cell tumors (MCTs) are one of the most common malignant tumors of the dog, representing between 7-20% of all cancers in this species. The presence of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain of Kit leading to autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand binding was previously reported in a small number of MCTs. The purpose of the following study was to determine the true prevalence of Kit ITDs in canine MCTs, and to correlate the presence of these mutations with prognosis. We evaluated 157 MCTs and identified ITDs in 1/12 (8%) Grade I, 42/119 (35%) Grade II, and 9/26 (35%) Grade III tumors, for an overall prevalence of 33%. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the odds of Grade II and III tumors possessing ITDs were approximately 5 times greater than Grade I tumors (P \u03ed 0.10 and P \u03ed 0.18, respectively). Moreover, the presence of an ITD was associated with a higher likelihood of local recurrence post surgical excision (odds ratio \u03ed 2.19, P \u03ed 0.22) and the development of metastatic disease (odds ratio \u03ed 2.04, P \u03ed 0.13). These studies underscore the role of Kit activation in MCT pathogenesis and provide the first evidence that Kit ITDs are associated with those MCTs that behave in a biologically aggressive fashion. Moreover, the high prevalence of Kit ITDs in canine MCTs combined with the relative abundance of mast cell disease in the dog provide an ideal spontaneous tumor model in which to test the safety and efficacy of novel small molecule kinase inhibitors. Harmonic ultrasound has been used to image bubble contrast agents in human medicine for many years. Recently the principles of filtering the received signal to detect harmonic frequencies has been applied to noncontrast tissue ultrasound. Tissue harmonic ultrasound (THU) has been shown to improve conspicuity of certain lesions and of normal organs in many human patients.

Human and experimental animal studies have shown that sepsis results in activation of the coagulation cascade with concomitant reduction in the natural anticoagulant proteins, antithrombin (AT) and protein C (PC). These alterations are believed to play a role in the high morbidity and mortality of sepsis, however, such changes have not been documented in naturally occurring sepsis in dogs. The objective of this study was to measure hemostatic parameters in septic dogs, with specific comparisons of the concentrations of anticoagulant proteins in dogs with sepsis and healthy controls. In this study, sepsis was defined as histologic or microbiological confirmation of infection and the presence of two or more of the following criteria: hypo-or hyperthermia; tachycardia; tachypnea; or neutropenia, neutrophilia, or greater than 3% bands. Control dogs were enrolled based on a normal physical examination, CBC, biochemistry profile, and coagulation profile. Plasma samples were collected and analyzed for prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrin(ogen) degradation product (FDP) and D-dimer (DD) concentrations, and AT and PC activities. Data were compared between groups using chi-square or independent t-tests. Twenty dogs with sepsis and 28 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Mean age was 7.5\u03ee3.7 yrs for septic dogs and 6.0\u03ee3.9 yrs for controls (P \u03ed 0.206). Hemostatic results are shown below: PC and AT concentrations were significantly correlated (r \u03ed 0.75; P\u03fd0.001). FDP (P\u03fd0.001) and DD (P \u03ed 0.005) were significantly higher in dogs with sepsis than in controls. Ten of the 20 septic dogs (50%) died but there was no association between any of the measured variables and outcome. In conclusion, this population of dogs with sepsis had decreased AT and PC activities, and increased PT, PTT, DD, and FDP when compared to healthy controls. These findings are consistent with prior studies in experimental animals and human clinical studies. Based on these results, further investigation of the role of PC in canine sepsis is warranted. Dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) have multiple hemostatic abnormalities and a high incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism. Plasma transfusion has been proposed for the treatment of IMHA to restore hemostatic balance and correct the thrombotic tendency. A prospective study was therefore undertaken to determine whether administration of fresh-frozen plasma, a source of both coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants, decreases the incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in canine patients with IMHA.",

Further research will be needed to define the role of these autoantibodies in the development of chronic renal failure in cats. Cats with spontaneous renal insufficiency frequently develop severe hypertension. The most frequently studied model of renal insufficiency in cats, the remnant kidney model, is characterized by moderate systemic hypertension but blood pressure often declines over time (Brown et al, Am J Vet Res 62:375, 2001) . It has recently been reported by Finco et al. that renal wrapping can increase the magnitude of systemic hypertension in the remnant kidney model in dogs. We hypothesized that a combination of renal wrap plus ablation would lead to sustained systemic hypertension in cats. Twenty-two cats had either two intact kidneys (Group C; n \u03ed 7), left partial renal infarction with right renal wrap/ablation (Group W; n \u03ed 7) or left partial renal infarction with right nephrectomy (Group RK; n \u03ed 8). Arterial blood pressure (BP), was measured by implanted radiotelemetric device continuously for 91 days. Compared with values for group C, SBP was elevated (P\u03fd0.05) in group RK although SBP declined in this group over time. In contrast, SBP was markedly and persistently elevated (P\u03fd0.05) in group W cats.",

This new model has utility for studies to evaluate the effects of feline hypertension on target organs and to characterize beneficial effects of anti-hypertensive therapy. Hemodialysis (HD) is a standard procedure for the treatment of severe acute renal failure (SRF) in humans. Its use in dogs with ARF has received only limited review, thus we reviewed the case records of all dogs that received HD treatments for the management of ARF from January 1990 to February 2001. The diagnosis of ARF was based on conventional criteria including clinical, laboratory, imaging and histopathology. All HD treatments were performed using transcutaneous vascular access, bicarbonate-based dialysate, and Cobe Centrysystem 3 dialysis delivery system.

These data support the efficacy of HD for the management of azotemia in severe ARF. Survival was consistent with human data and was notable considering that these patients had exhausted all possibilities of conventional therapy. Glucocorticoid excess can cause glomerular lesions and proteinuria in dogs, but effects of glucocorticoid therapy on proteinuria in dogs with preexisting glomerular diseases of other causes are not well characterized.

The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown, but a direct effect on the primary defect (i.e., abnormal type IV collagen content of the GBM) is an unlikely explanation. If the effect of glucocorticoid therapy on glomerular proteinuria in these dogs is nonspecific, a similar phenomenon should be expected during prednisone administration to dogs with other types of glomerular disease causing proteinuria. The presence of microalbuminuria (MA) has been shown to be an accurate predictor of subsequent renal disease in human beings with both systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. MA has also been observed in human beings with systemic diseases that are associated with glomerulopathy. Previous studies in dogs have shown the prevalence of MA in apparently healthy dogs and soft coated wheaten terriers genetically predisposed to developing glomerular disease to be 19% and 76%, respectively. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MA in dogs with experimentally infected heartworm disease. Twelve six-month male beagles were randomly divided into two groups of six. Group A was fed a diet with a 50:1 n-6: n-3 fatty acid ratio and group B was fed a diet with a 5:1 n-6: n-3 fatty acid ratio. All of the dogs were infected subcutaneously with 75 Dirofilaria immitis infective larvae. Urine collections via urethral catheterization were performed monthly for 14 to 23 months post infection. Urine albumin concentrations were measured using an antigen capture ELISA. To account for varying urine concentrations, results were normalized to a specific gravity of 1.010. MA was defined as urinary excretion of albumin greater than 1.0 mg/dl but less than 30.0 mg/dl. All dogs developed MA; the initial month of detection of MA was different between groups as measured by ANOVA (Group A 7.5\u03ee1.9 vs Group B 9.7\u03ee1.0, P \u03ed 0.032). After the initial episode of MA, 67/82 (82%) of samples from Group A dogs had MA and 4/82 (5%) samples had overt proteinuria (\u03fe 30 mg/dl). The average concentration of urine protein in these 82 samples was 7.7\u03ee11 mg/dl. In comparison, after the initial episode of MA, Group B dogs had 45/68 (66%) samples with MA and 7/68 (10%) samples with overt proteinuria. The average concentration of urine protein in these 68 samples was 8.3\u03ee14 mg/dl. In both groups MA increased over time and MA preceded overt proteinuria when it occurred. The overall number of proteinuric urine samples (\u03fe 1.0 mg/dl) in both groups after the initial onset was 123/150 (82%) with 75% of the samples having MA and 7% having overt proteinuria. Eleven of these 12 dogs had histologic evidence of glomerular lesions on light microscopic and/or immunocytochemical evaluation.",

Ten cats in this study had a reduced GFR but one laboratory reported all of their serum creatinine values as ''normal''. This is consistent with previous suggestions about the lack of sensitivity of this test as currently employed. However, using the ''normal'' ranges and accompanying results from several laboratories resulted in ''elevated'' serum creatinine concentrations being reported for some, or all, of the 5 cats with a normal GFR from Group N.",

It has been hypothesised that acute laminitis may be triggered by the release of factor(s) from the gut resulting in digital vasoconstriction. This phenomenon commonly follows the fermentation of carbohydrate in the cecum and colon. Although the factors causing this condition have not yet been elucidated, we have recently shown that a number of amines are formed in the equine cecum and the rate of formation increases with fermentation. Many monoamines, such as tryptamine and phenylethylamine, have been shown to be potent vasoconstrictors of isloated digital blood vessels in vitro, due to their structural similarities with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and catecholamines. The aim of the present study was to to examine the effects of infusions of low doses of tryptamine and phenylethylamine on digital blood flow in the normal horse.",

It is routinely administered as intravenous (IV) bolus doses of 0.25-1 mg/kg q8-24 h. This intermittent administration (IA) regimen causes fluctuations in electrolyte concentrations, plasma volume and activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

Meropenem (Merrem) is a member of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics, carbapenems. These drugs are advantageous due to their bactericidal and post antibiotic effects as well as being resistant to most beta-lactamases. Their broad spectrum of activity includes drug-resistant bacteria responsible for some small animal infections. To determine a dosage regimen for dogs, pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from a single intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration at 20 mg/kg to 6 healthy dogs. To characterize the distribution of meropenem in dogs and demonstrate a unique tissue concentration sampling method, an in-vivo ultrafiltration device was used to collect extracellular fluid (ECF). To measure meropenem's potential for treating urinary infections, urine concentrations were measured. Plasma, urine and tissue fluid samples were analyzed via HPLC with UV detection. Plasma data was analyzed by compartmental and non-compartmental pharmacokinetic methods. An ultrafiltration device determined plasma protein binding of meropenem. Mixed effects models with different correlation structures were used to analyze the data statistically. Plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of meropenem include: short half-life, high clearance (CL), excellent absorption from SC, and a small volume of distribution (VD). Half-life, VD, and CL after IV meropenem for plasma were 0.67 \u03ee 0.07hr, 371.51 \u03ee 52.77 ml/kg, and 391.99 \u03ee 90.72 ml/hr/kg, respectively.

The half-life of meropenem after SC administration was 1.0 \u03ee 0.21 hr and 1.07 \u03ee 0.54 hr for plasma and tissue fluid, respectively. Protein binding was 11.87% and the bioavailability after the SC dose was 84%. Analysis of our data show that tissue fluid concentrations are almost identical to protein unbound plasma concentrations. Urine concentrations were at least 50 \u03eb plasma concentrations during the collection periods. Owing to the kinetic similarity of meropenem in the extravascular and vascular space, tissue fluid concentrations can be predicted from plasma. We concluded that a dosage of 30 mg/kg SC every 12 hrs, or 13 mg/ kg every 8 hours would achieve adequate tissue fluid and urine levels for sensitive bacteria with a MIC up to 1 mcg/mL.

Both assays were validated for canine whole blood at concentrations from 33.5 to 1404.9 ng/mL. Coefficient of variation for each assay was less than 15% for all except the lowest concentration (20%). Using WinNonLin, noncompartmental analysis (NCA) was performed for both HPLC and RIA and compartmental analysis (CA) for HPLC. Comparisons were made between the RIA and HPLC values using a paired t-test.",

Maximum concentration (Cmax) was 1024 \u03ee 488 ng/ml. The disappearance half-life (t1/2d), based on that portion of the curve that represented the greatest portion of the area under the curve (AUC) and therapeutic concentrations was 47 minutes. Cmax and AUC of CsA when administered as microemulsion were approximately 2 fold or more higher than the same parameters (when adjusted for dose differences) previously reported for the original formulation. The results of this study suggest that the bioavialability of the microemulsion product is improved in dogs compared to the original product. Enrofloxacin (ENR) is a fluoroquinolone (FQ) antimicrobial approved for use in veterinary medicine. As with other FQs, it can accumulate in phagocytic white blood cells (WBC). Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated up to 84 fold accumulation of ENR in circulating canine WBC compared to plasma. Presumably, accumulation in circulating WBC may result in higher concentrations of ENR at the site of inflammation such as occurs with infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of accumulation of ENR in circulating WBC on the concentration of ENR at an inflammatory site. Dogs (n \u03ed 5) were surgically implanted with bilateral subcutaneous tissue chambers. Localized inflammation was induced in one chamber with a sterile irritant (carrageenan 1%); the other chamber served as a control. Peripheral leukocytes were collected from each dog, exposed in vitro to radiolabeled enrofloxacin to allow accumulation, and injected back into the donor 10 hours after the inflammatory insult. Mean dose of ENR administered in WBC was 1085 \u03ee 178 ng/kg. Samples were collected from blood (circulating WBC and serum) and each the inflamed and non-inflamed chambers prior to and at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours after administration of WBC loaded with ENR. Chamber fluid was separated into WBC and extracellular fluid (ECF) and, along with plasma and WBC isolated from peripheral blood, were subjected to ENR analysis using liquid scintillation counting. The lower and upper limits of the assay were, respectively, 0.22 and 6.6 ng/ml; controls that spanned these concentrations predicted within 15%. ENR was not detected in any plasma, circulating leukocytes or in non-inflamed chambers. ENR was detected in both ECF and WBC collected from the inflamed tissue chamber of each dog. Maximum ENR concentration 2.00 \u03ee 0.50 ng/ml in the ECF occurred at 6.4 \u03ee 3.2 hours after administration and in chamber WBC 0.55 \u03ee 0.27 ng/ml at 4.8 \u03ee 4.1 hours. Disappearance half-life of ENR in ECF and WBC collected from the inflamed chamber were 17.8 \u03ee 7.8 hours and 23.1 \u03ee 9.2 hours respectively. This study demonstrated the ability of circulating WBC containing ENR to increase the concentration of ENR at the site of inflammation. The North American Llama and Alpaca population is approximately 275,000 animals respectively. In spite of this, few studies have been done to determine pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs in SAC. Consequently, most health decisions regarding antimicrobial use are based upon extrapolation from other species. TMPS combinations are widely used to treat bacterial infections in Llamas and Alpacas. Information regarding appropriate drug doses and dosage intervals specific to Llamas and Alpacas are not available. The purpose of this study was to determine the fate of orally administered TMPS combinations in Llamas and Alpacas. Six healthy male-castrate alpacas were used in this study. The animals were housed in stalls and fed hay and water ad libitum. After intravenous administration of 15mg/kg IV (2.5mg/kg trimethoprim, 12.5 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole) concentration-vs.-time profile suggest that drug disposition is modeled most appropriately using a 2 compartment equation. Maximum concentration (Cmax) of trimethoprim (T) and sulfamethoxazole (S) in plasma was 6.5\u03ee2.1g/ ml and 111\u03ee96g/ml respectively. Elimination half-life was 1\u03ee.7 hr (T) and 2.2\u03ee0.6 h (S) respectively. The mean residence times were T \u03ed 1.0\u03ee0.5 and S \u03ed 2.8\u03ee.6 hours. The areas under the respective concentration versus time curves (AUC) were 17\u03ee1.3 g*hr/ml (T) and 124\u03ee60 g*hr/ml (S). After intragastric administration of 15 mg/kg, 30mg/kg and 60 mg/kg the respective Cmax and Tmax for sulfamethoxazole were 1.9\u03ee0.8, 2.6\u03ee0.4 and 2.8\u03ee0.7 at 1.2, 1.5 and 2 h respectively. The AUC for S at oral doses 15mg/kg, 30mg/kg and 60mg/kg was 9.1\u03ee5 g*hr/ml, 25.9\u03ee3.3 g*hr/ml and 39.1\u03ee4.1 g*hr/ml respectively. Based upon these AUC values and correcting for dose, the bioavailability of sulfamethoxazole was F \u03ed 7.7% at 15mg/kg, F \u03ed 10.5% at 30mg/kg and 7.94% at 60mg/kg. T was not detected in plasma after intragastric administration (15 mg/kg) except in one animal where T was detected at 4 hours (Cmax \u03ed 0.49g/ ml). T was not detectable after oral doses of 30mg/kg or 60mg/kg. These data demonstrate that therapeutic concentrations of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are not achieved after oral administration to Alpacas. Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) is a harmless phyllosilicate clay commonly used as an anticaking agent in animal feeds. Preliminary research has shown that HSCAS is capable of tightly and selectively adsorbing aflatoxin in vitro and in vivo (Phillips, 1995; Mayura et al., 1998; Grant and Phillips, 1998) . When included in the diet at levels between 0.5-2.0% (w/w), HSCAS clay significantly protected animals including chickens, turkeys, and swine from levels of aflatoxin as high as 7,500 ppb. As recently as 1998, about 250 dogs died in Texas from exposure to aflatoxin in a variety of dog food products. Dogs ingested aflatoxin amounts in the range of 150 ppb over a threemonth period. The corn used in the specific pet foods fed was found to be contaminated with aflatoxin. Studies were conducted to investigate the efficacy of HSCAS dietary clay in offering protection for dogs consuming aflatoxin in the diet.",

After the 7-day feeding period, the dogs were given a predetermined low level non-toxic single dose of aflatoxin B1. Urine samples were collected from the dogs at specified intervals during the next 48 hours. The urine was analyzed for aflatoxin metabolites M1, P1 and Q1 using HPLC. Following a 5-day washout period, the dogs were switched to the other diet and the process repeated. Normal aflatoxin clearance curves for clayunprotected dogs were determined. Results showed that the urinary metabolite aflatoxin M1 regularly clears the dog's system in 48 hours. On average, 71.5% of this metabolite is cleared in the first 6 hours after dosing, increasing to 90.4% after 12 hours. These findings concurred with work by Emafo (1976) indicating that dogs do not demethylate aflatoxin B1 to the urinary metabolite aflatoxin Q1. In this study, no aflatoxin Q1 was found in the urine in contrast to large amounts of M1. Urinary metabolites were measured and compared between the control diet fed period and clay-supplemented diet fed period to determine the effects of HSCAS clay in the diet. The dietary HSCAS clay diet provided an average decrease in urinary aflatoxin metabolites of 58.1% as compared to the control diet. It is concluded that the HSCAS dietary clay is efficacious in protecting dogs fed pet foods even at minimal aflatoxin contamination. The significance of this finding is that despite regular and careful screening of ingredients for aflatoxin, low levels may reach the final product undetected. HSCAS clay may therefore provide the pet food industry further assurance of canine diet safety for pet foods. The signalment, medical history, laboratory findings, histopathology, and hepatic copper concentrations were characterized in 10 cases of Dalmatian dogs with hepatic copper toxicosis. All hepatic copper concentrations were determined at Colorado State University Diagnostic Laboratory using atomic absorption analysis and concentrations were expressed as mg/g dry weight liver (dwl). In 9 of 10 cases, hepatic tissue was available for histopathologic evaluation by a single pathologist (DJM).",

Growth-hormone (GH) release by the pituitary gland is controlled by two antagonistic hypothalamic peptides: somatostatin inhibits GH release and GH releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates GH release. GH release can also be stimulated by synthetic GH-secretagogues (GHSs), such as growth hormone releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6). These GHSs elicit their effect on GH release via a specific GHS receptor that is not activated by GHRH or somatostatin. Recently, the endogenous ligand for the GHS receptor has been identified, it is called ghrelin. In rats, ghrelin is a selective GH releaser. Cushing's syndrome, a state of chronic hypercortisolism, is associated with impaired GH secretion. In humans both, GHRH and GHRP-6 are unable to induce significant GH release, neither in patients with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) nor in patients with hyperadrenocorticism due to an adrenal tumour.",

These results are in discordance with the apparent efficacy of transdermal methimazole with chronic dosing in hyperthyroid cats. We hypothesize that chronic dosing may enhance absorption due to changes in the stratum corneum with chronic PLO administration. Controlled studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of transdermal methimazole compared to oral methimazole, with chronic dosing, in the treatment of hyperthyroidism in cats. Reverse iontophoresis is a process by which small amounts of interstitial fluid are extracted transdermally without tissue disruption or pain.

The parathyroid gland is designed to respond to changes in extracellular ionized calcium (Ca 2\u03e9 ) concentrations by controlling parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Abnormalities in Ca 2\u03e9 homeostasis are reported in horses with several pathological conditions; however, there is little information on the regulation of calcium in horses. The objectives of the present study were to determine the Ca 2\u03e9 set-point (the calcium concentration corresponding to 50% of maximal PTH secretion) in healthy horses, to determine whether the Ca 2\u03e9 /PTH response curves during hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia were characterized by hysteresis (different PTH concentrations for the same serum Ca 2\u03e9 concentration depending on the direction of changes in Ca 2\u03e9 concentrations), and to determine if the order of experimentally-induced hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia had an effect on PTH secretion (area under the time concentration curve, AUC). The Ca 2\u03e9 set-point and hysteresis were determined in 12 healthy horses in a cross-over design by infusing EDTA (30-90 mg/kg/h) and calcium gluconate (4-16 mg/kg/h).

We have shown that the Ca 2\u03e9 / PTH relationship in horses is sigmoidal and displays hysteresis during both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia, and that extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 concentrations may affect the response of the parathyroid gland to hypocalcemia. Defining the Ca 2\u03e9 set-point in horses may help to explain the pathophysiology of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia in this species. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland in response to changes in extracellular ionized calcium (Ca 2\u03e9 ) concentrations. In vitro studies on parathyroid cells from different species have improved our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the parathyroid gland. Several conditions in the horses are associated with abnormal parathyroid gland function. In a previous study we found that hypocalcemia and abnormal parathyroid gland function were present in some horses with sepsis. In the present study we evaluated equine parathyroid cell PTH secretion, and PTH mRNA and calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) mRNA expression. We also evaluated the effects of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, cytokines known to be increased during sepsis in humans and animals, on PTH secretion, and PTH and CaR mRNA expression.",

Mean values for reactive oxidant production were similar for both cell populations (17,853 \u03ee 9,695 vs 19,138 \u03ee 14,569 for the PMBC and PMN fractions, respectively). However, the PMN fraction exhibited a biphasic response incorporating a slower increase to maximal reactive oxidant release (10.7 vs 5.1 min for PMNs and PMBCs, respectively). The intracellular concentrations of beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase were higher in the PBMC fraction. Both cell fractions released less than 20% of their intracellular concentrations following stimulation with opsinized zymosan. LTB4 production in the PMBC fraction was higher than that for the PMN fraction (4.45 and 0.96 ng/106 cells, respectively). A mean value of 57.3% of complement C3 was found to have converted to C3b. The results generated provide a reference range of values for the above parameters in healthy dogs, which can subsequently be used for comparative purposes with canine patients suffering from a variety of inflammatory disorders. Sulfonamide hypersensitivity in humans is characterized by fever, rash, blood dyscrasias, or hepatotoxicity, observed 5 or more days after sulfonamide initiation. A similar syndrome is observed in dogs, and may also include arthropathy, uveitis, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca. In humans, anti-drug antibodies and antibodies to liver microsomal proteins have been documented in patients with sulfonamide hypersensitivity, suggesting haptenization of liver proteins by a reactive drug metabolite generated in the liver. The purpose of this study was to summarize the clinical findings in dogs with sulfonamide-associated hypersensitivity identified at the authors' institutions from 1993-2001, and to determine whether IgG or IgM anti-drug antibodies, or antibodies to liver microsomal proteins, were detectable in the serum of these patients.",

Negative controls included preimmune rabbit serum, and serum from 10 healthy dogs, 3 sulfonamide-tolerant dogs, and 4 systemically ill dogs without sulfonamide exposure. ELISA results indicated that no dog was positive for either IgG or IgM antibodies to specific sulfonamides. This indicates that sulfonamide hypersensitivity in dogs is not associated with a humoral response to the drug itself, and may instead be due to nonhumoral mechanisms (cell-mediated or direct cytotoxicity), or a humoral response to drug-modified proteins. Western blotting studies are underway to determine whether dogs with sulfonamide-associated hypersensitivity have antibodies to native or metabolite-modified tissue proteins. Recently, Giardia vaccines for use with dogs and cats have been shown to lessen clinical signs of giardiasis and greatly lessen cyst shedding on challenge when used as a preventative. Treatment of giardiasis with currently available drugs may be ineffective and some drugs have significant side-effects. Use of Giardia vaccination as an immunotherapy led to cessation of diarrhea and cyst shedding in seven naturally-infected dogs. This study was undertaken in order to assess the efficacy of Giardia vaccination as a treatment of giardiasis in experimentally-infected cats.",

Serologic tests continue to vary in sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic performance. A negative Ab test does not preclude adult HW infection. The Ag tests used in this study were more sensitive for adult HW infection in cats compared to Ab assays. The overall measure of test performance (AUC:ROC) was higher for the Ag tests compared to the Ab tests. Combining results from serum Ab and Ag tests achieved higher sensitivities than using serum Ab and Ag test results alone. There are many infectious agents of cats associated with fever and so infectious disease tests are commonly applied to samples from cats with fever in an attempt to determine causation. New diagnostic tests have been developed for ehrlichial infections, Bartonella spp. infections, and both Haemobartenella felis strains (Mycoplasma haemofelis [Hflg] and M. haemominutum [Hfsm] ). The purpose of this study was to apply a battery of infectious disease tests to blood and serum samples from cats with fever (n \u03ed 121) and geographically matched cats without fever (n \u03ed 99). Assays performed included: FeLV p27 antigen ELISA; Overall, serologic evidence of exposure or PCR evidence of infection by one or more of the infectious agents was detected in 54.5% and 50.1% of the cats with and without fever, respectively. All 3 Ehrlichia spp. PCR positive results were identified as E. equi (Anaplasma phagocytophila) by DNA sequence evaluation. With the exception of Ehrlichia PCR, positive test results were detected in cats with and without fever and there were no statistically significant differences between groups. These results emphasize that since each of the assays used can be positive in cats with and without fever, causation of fever cannot be proven based on the test result alone. Multidrug resistance is a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy in canine lymphoma and leukemia. Drug efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is considered to be a common mechanism of multidrug resistance. In dogs, several reports have shown the expression of P-gp in drug-resistant lymphoma cells, however, there are discrepancies observed between the P-gp expression and the drug resistance. In this study, we carried out a study on the functional detection of multidrug resistance in 20 canine lymphoma and leukemia cases as well as 2 canine lymphoid tumor cell lines.",

A reference array composed of six infrared light emitting diodes (IRLED) is rigidly fixed to the bite plate for both imaging and treatment.

A ceiling mounted infra-red detecting camera localizes each of the IRLED's in space, defining the bite plate position in reference to the isocenter of the linear accelerator to which the camera is calibrated.

Further investigations, also based on molecular genetic studies, are necessary to determine the pathogenesis and whether a major gene effect is responsible for the axonopathy. Medical record, seizure survey, and phone interview information was obtained for 29 Vizslas with idiopathic epilepsy (IE), 72 unaffected siblings, and 41 parents from 13 families to determine the common clinical characteristics, feasibility of a genome scan, and most likely mode of inheritance of IE in this breed. IE was diagnosed based on age of onset of seizures, seizure history, blood work results, and neurological examinations. CT or MRI scan with CSF analysis was required for inclusion of individuals with an age of onset of seizures of less than 6 months or greater than 5 years.

Mean bid dose and drug concentrations were dose 4.1 \u03ee 1.1 mg/kg and 27 \u03ee 6 mg/ml, respectively for PB and 31 \u03ee 11 mg/kg and 1.9 \u03ee 0.6 mg/ml for BR.

Changes in clinical pathology were limited to increased (but within normal) serum alkaline phosphatase and decreased (but within normal) serum albumin at 6 months for PB compared to baseline and compared to BR at 6 months. Side effects at one and six months, respectively for each drug were: ataxia (PB: 55 vs 5%; BR: 22 vs 9%), obtundation (PB: 50 vs 5%; BR: 35 vs 13%), polydypsia (PB: 40 vs 0%; BR: 39 vs 4%), polyuria (PB: 35 vs 0%; BR: 13 vs 0%), hyperactivity (PB: 35 vs 10%; BR 43 vs 4% [one failure]), polyphagia (PB: 30 vs 0%; BR: 43 vs 4%) and vomiting (PB: 20 vs 0%; BR: 57 vs 21% [one failure]). One PB dog failed due to neutropenia. The incidence of obtundation and vomiting were greater in BR compared to PB at 6 months. This study suggests that both PB and BR are reasonable first choices for control of epilepsy in dogs, although PB may provide better control. Side effects can be expected to be greater in BR following chronic dosing. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are useful for diagnosing animals with suspected intracranial disease. However, even with the advanced neurodiagnostic tools currently available, it is challenging to differentiate between the different types of encephalitis and round cell tumors without obtaining a surgical biopsy. While establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential in treating the patient and counseling clients, it is often difficult to persuade clients to pursue aggressive diagnostic efforts such as CT-guided brain biopsy.

In general, lesions that were isointense on T1-weighted images were only found in GME or LSA, whereas lesions that were hypointense were only associated with NE, cryptococcus, or other, non-specific encephalitides. For lesions that were hypointense on T1, those that were located both infraand supra-tentorially were only found with fungal disease or non-specific encephalitis and not with NE. For LSA or GME, the differentials could be narrowed down further since many of the LSA cases also had an extra-axial mass. While MRI was helpful in eliminating some of the differentials, there were exceptions that made definitive diagnosis impossible. However, CSF results were a valuable adjunct in further eliminating many of the differentials and complementing the MRI findings. Significant differences in TP and NCC were found among GME, NE, LSA, and fungal encephalitis. The combination of MRI and CSF findings in animals with intra-cranial disease can be used to help distinguish the various inflammatory diseases and round cell tumors and contribute to establishing an accurate diagnosis in the absence of a surgical biopsy. Spinal epidural empyema (SEE) is a rarely reported suppurative, septic process in the epidural space that develops secondary to hematogenous spread or direct extension of local infection.

The increased AQ seen in these samples is consistent with transudation of protein rather than intrathecal immunoglobulin production. Lumbar CSF analysis is a clinically useful diagnostic test in dogs suspected of having ACP. The systemic immune system is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Acute Canine Polyradiculoneuritis (ACP). Although many dogs that develop this polyradiculoneuropathy have a history of exposure to a raccoon 7-14 days prior to the onset of clinical signs, a significant number of dogs have no history of exposure and develop identical clinical signs and pathology. ACP is considered to be an animal model of the acute axonal form of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in humans. Various antecedent events have been shown to occur 7-14 days prior to onset of neurological signs in GBS, and are thought to trigger an immune response resulting in peripheral nerve pathology via a bystander effect. These factors include bacterial and viral infections, vaccination, and surgical procedures. In this study, the relationship between ACP and prior infection or exposure to various infectious agents was examined.",

Dogs with ACP were more commonly positive for T. gondii IgG than control dogs (P\u03fd0.001). Presence of T. gondii IgG in serum generally denotes current tissue infection. Based on the results of this study, a positive association exists between dogs with ACP and T. gondii infection. A causal relationship, however, has not been determined. Blood contamination of samples may adversely affect results of cytologic, serologic, biochemical, and molecular tests performed on CSF. A clear consensus of these effects does not exist in the veterinary literature.

Computerized ECG recordings have been used lately for ECG acquisition, and the values are compared to published reference values obtained in strip recordings. To evaluate possible differences in measurement accuracy among different recording displays, ECG tracings were obtained from 20 healthy cats in right lateral recumbency using a computerized (method I) and a conventional, onechannel strip ECG machine (method II), without changing electrode positioning. Measurements were made on lead II by three observers and included P wave and QRS duration and amplitude, PR and QT interval duration, T wave amplitude, heart rate/ R-R interval and the main electrical axis was determined. For method I measurements were obtained on screen and on ECG printed on paper (at 50mm/s) and for method II, on the actual ECG strip. A caliper was used for measurements made on paper and the values considered to the fourth of a millimeter. Comparisons were made among methods and observers. Differences in measurements among method displays were significant for PR and QT intervals, P and QRS duration. There was also inter-observer difference for on-screen measurements. These differences demonstrate that standards for computerized electrocardiograms are needed.

The 30mg dose produced supratherapeutic serum levels at 6 or 12hrs in 4/5 cats and subtherapeutic levels at 24hrs in 4/5 cats. Although we saw adverse effects (decreased appetite) in only 1 cat, lethargy, anorexia and GI disturbances are reported and may be due to high serum concentrations. Supratherapeutic levels may be a problem at either dosage, while subtherapeutic levels suggest that once daily administration of 30mg is inadequate. Also, breaking/cutting the tablets is difficult.",

Irreversible left ventricular dysfunction is common, however it does not seem to affect the clinical course. Late closure does not appear to carry a higher risk in the hands of experienced surgeons and it relieves clinical signs. Outcome without intervention was less favorable. The accuracy of Doppler-derived blood flow velocity depends on the angle of incidence between the ultrasound beam and the direction of flow. Failure to align the ultrasound beam with blood flow results in under estimation of velocity. In dogs with subaortic stenosis, it is known that the subcostal transducer site provides higher left ventricular ejection velocities (LVEV) than does the apical site. LVEV obtained from the subcostal site in healthy dogs have not been reported; accordingly, we examined 42 healthy, random-source dogs to test the hypothesis that aortic velocities obtained from the subcostal (S) and apical transducer (A) sites differ.",

We speculate that these changes in hematocrit may parallel the quantity of renal tissue available for production of erythropoietin (EPO). Immediately postoperatively EPO production may be markedly diminished, followed by a relative increase with hypertrophy of residual nephrons.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is an endocrine cause of PU/PD that is termed central or neurogenic when due to a lack of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) production and secretion or nephrogenic when due to a lack of response of collecting ducts to vasopressin. Water deprivation and exogenous vasopressin administration are two diagnostic tests that can be used to differentiate neurogenic from nephrogenic DI. Recently, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP\u00d2 ), a synthetic vasopressin analog, has been used for diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic DI in human and animal patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin acetate in six normal horses in both the euhydrated (Experiment 1) and hyperhydrated state (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 was performed to assess potential hemodynamic effects of desmopressin acetate (20 ug IV) and no changes in heart rate or indirect blood pressure or other adverse effects were observed. In experiment 2, hyperhydration was induced by nasogastric administration of 40 ml/kg of water q 12 hours for 3 days. One hour after the last intubation of water, either desmopressin acetate (20 ug, equivalent in antidiuretic activity to 80 IU of vasopressin) or saline (control) was administered IV and urine and blood samples were collected for 8 hours. Total urine production over the 8 hour study period was 14.2 \u03ee 1.7 L with the control treatment compared to 2.8 \u03ee 0.5 L after administration of desmopressin acetate (p\u03fd0.01). Further, both urine specific gravity and urine osmolality increased after administration of desmopressin acetate and values were greater (p\u03fd0.01) than for the control treatment. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that intravenous administration of 20 ug of desmopressin acetate is both a safe and useful diagnostic tool for evaluation of horses with DI.",

Prediction of a urolith's mineral composition can be made using several variables; however, none of these variables allows accurate in vivo determination of urolith mineral composition. Uroliths are distinguishable from surrounding tissues using noncontrast computed tomography. Tissue density can be quantified using peak beam attenuation measurements (Hounsfield units; HU). HUs have been used to predict composition of uroliths retrieved from people in vitro, and to differentiate calcium oxalate and urate uroliths in vivo in people. This study was designed to establish in vitro reference ranges for three types of uroliths retrieved from dogs. 66 uroliths (22 urate, U; 21 calcium oxalate, O; 14 struvite, S; 9 mixed, M) retrieved from dogs were placed in a phantom array. Uroliths were scanned at 120 kVp/400 mAs and 80 kVp/400 mAs. The region-of-interest (ROI) for HU calculation was determined using two techniques. In ROI 1, an area was hand-drawn just within the urolith border, using the largest cross-sectional image obtained. In ROI 2, an oval encompassing 2/3 to 3/4 of the urolith area was manually centered over the largest urolith image.

Other target organs, such as the eye and brain, may be adversely impacted by systemic hypertension.

There was no correlation (r \u03ed \u03ea0.0133, p \u03ed 0.946) between tCO 2 and 13 C enrichment. Changes in 13 C enrichment of individual horses were variable. We conclude that, under the conditions of this study, administration of NaHCO 3 cannot be detected by measurement of 13 C enrichment of serum-derived CO 2 . Studies in human medicine have shown a high incidence of hypomagnesemia in patients admitted to intensive care units, and hypomagnesemia has been associated with increased death rates. Supplementation with magnesium (Mg) is used routinely, and in some disorders has been shown to improve survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in horses admitted to the large animal clinic at NCSU, CVM; to determine whether or not there is an association between hypomagnesemia and organ system affected; to determine if hypomagnesemia affects clinical outcome; and to determine which other serum chemistries correlate with Mg.",

Serum feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI) has been shown to be clinically useful for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and pancreatitis in cats. Currently, an in-house ELISA is used for the measurement of serum fTLI concentrations. This assay detects trypsinogen, the main form of trypsin in serum of healthy individuals, trypsin, and also a portion of trypsin bound to trypsin inhibitors. Feline trypsinogen and trypsin are small cationic proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 24 kDa. Therefore, both proteins are filtered in the kidney and renal function may affect renal excretion of these proteins and in turn may influence serum fTLI concentrations.

Although obesity has been associated with increased risk for some health problems in dogs, reduction of these risks subsequent to obesity therapy has yet to be demonstrated. One reason for this circumstance is the difficulty commonly encountered in sustaining weight loss after it has been achieved. To begin to investigate alternative approaches to weight loss maintenance, we compared the effects of a conventional (C) approach to weight loss used at The Ohio State University Veterinary Hospital with a weight management program (I) that incorporated interventions intended to effect behavioral changes in clients with obese dogs.

Asthma in humans as well as in cats is characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction and chronic airway inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of the disease. In the present case control study the antioxidant/oxidant balance in plasma from cats with spontaneous feline asthma was determined. In 7 cats diagnosis of asthma was established by history, clinical signs, X-rays, a dominance of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage, and detection of bronchoconstriction during an asthmatic attack by use of conscious unrestrained barometric whole body plethysmography. 10 healthy cats served as controls. Plasma lipid-soluble and water-soluble antioxidants were determined independently by photochemiluminescence. Plasma ceruloplasmin, an acute phase protein and indicator of inflammation was evaluated by electron spin resonance. To elucidate the role of ROS, malondialdehyde, a determinant of lipid peroxidation due to oxidative stress was measured in plasma as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Plasma lipid-soluble antioxidants were significantly lower in asthmatics compared to controls (7.76\u03ee5.05 vs 13.52 \u03ee 2.3 arbitrary units (AU), mean \u03eeSD; p \u03ed 0.012), whereas watersoluble antioxidant content was slightly, but not significantly higher in the asthmatic group (64.82\u03ee36 vs 37.89\u03ee18 AU, p \u03ed 0.055). Patients had a significantly higher plasma ceruloplasmin (10304.25\u03ee4002.49 vs 4538.77\u03ee1813.49 AU, p \u03ed 0.0002). TBARS (697.42 \u03ee156 vs 527.50\u03ee192.53 fluorescence units; p \u03ed 0.001) were significantly increased in asthma cats vs controls. The more severely affected patients showed a tendency for higher TBARS and ceruloplasmin levels. Our data suggest that similar to humans, cats with asthma have a significant plasma oxidant/antioxidant imbalance reflecting increased oxidative stress. Low lipid-soluble antioxidant levels may be explained by an increased utilization, whereas elevations in acute phase proteins and water-soluble antioxidants may be the consequence of upregulation in response to continuing oxidative stress. Longitudinal studies evaluating the influence of antiinflammatory therapy on the oxidant-antioxidant balance in feline asthma are underway. In the future, measurement of the antioxidant-oxidant status may contribute to objective monitoring of therapeutic effects beyond resolution of clinical signs. It might serve as a surrogate marker for the control of the inflammatory process in the airways.

Monitoring serum concentration of acute phase proteins (APPs) provides valuable information on the host's innate immune response. Haptoglobin (Hp) is a moderate APP present in low concentrations in normal canine serum which reaches peak concentrations five days after surgery or trauma.

Preliminary data suggests that monitoring Hp concentrations will prove to be a valuable aid in identifying and quantifying the inflammatory response in canine patients. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the use of Hp in monitoring progression of disease and response to therapy. The purpose of the study reported here was to characterize the immunologic responses of elk to brucellosis and tuberculosis vaccines. Previous studies have suggested that, unlike bison, cattle, and swine, vaccination of elk with Brucella abortus strain RB51 (SRB51) does not induce protection against challenge with virulent strains of B. abortus during gestation. Elk (n \u03ed 7/trt) were subcutaneously vaccinated at 7 to 8 months of age with single inoculations of saline, 10 10 CFU of SRB51, or B. abortus strain 19 (S19), or twice with 5 \u03eb 10 6 CFU of bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG). Elk vaccinated with S19, SRB51, or BCG had greater (P\u03fd 0.05) antibody responses to Brucella or M. bovis antigens, respectively, when compared to responses of nonvaccinated elk. Antibody responses of elk to SRB51 were greater than responses of bison and cattle in comparable studies. Proliferative responses of PBMC from S19-or SRB51-vaccinated elk to Brucella antigens were greater at 22 and 26 weeks after vaccination when compared to nonvaccinated elk. Proliferative responses of S19-and SRB51-vaccinated elk to Brucella antigens were delayed when compared to responses of SRB51-vaccinated cattle and bison. Flow cytometry data suggest that proliferative responses to Brucella antigens were primarily confined to B cell subsets. At 2 weeks after the first BCG vaccination, PBMC from vaccinated elk had greater proliferative responses to M. bovis antigens as compared to nonvaccinated elk. Proliferating cells at this time included B cells, CD4 and T cells. However, at all other sampling times, which included samples out to 22 weeks after the second BCG vaccination, no significant differences in proliferative responses were detected between vaccinated and nonvaccinated elk. As compared to cattle, elk immune responses to BCG are less robust and of much shorter duration, with greater proliferative responses to M. bovis antigens within B cells subsets, and reduced proliferative responses within CD4 and T cell subsets. All BCG-vaccinated elk had positive responses to skin testing to M. bovis, but not M. avium antigens. Only 1 of 7 elk were skin test positive to brucellin. The results of these studies suggest that elk primarily respond to brucellosis and tuberculosis vaccines with a humoral response that is unlikely to be associated with long-term protection. Our data also suggests that the immunologic responses of elk may substantially differ from other ruminants. As in most other species, kittens acquire nearly all of their passive immunity from colostrum during the first day of life. Immunoglobulin supplementation protocols exist for correction of failure of passive transfer in kittens, but it is not known if these treatments result in improvement of innate immune function. The purpose of this study was to determine if correction of IgG deficiency in neonatal kittens results in improvement of opsonizing capacity and neutrophil function.",

Infectious diseases are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in kittens. Kitten susceptibility to infections may be dependent upon the intrinsic ability of their neutrophils for phagocytosis of bacteria, or to their plasma opsonic capacity for promoting phagocytosis of bacteria.

Experiments with a known killed control cell population have shown a high loss of evaluated cells, most probably by adherence at tubes or wells. It was possible to avoid this loss by layering all ingredients on cushions of Histopaque. However, the cushion had a negative influence on the phagocytic activity of canine PMN.

Mutations in the proto-oncogene c-kit, including point mutations, deletions, or duplications in the negative regulatory juxtamembrane (JM) domain or point mutations in the catalytic domain, have been observed in human and canine cancers and often result in constitutive activation of Kit in the absence of ligand binding. To identify a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor capable of blocking the function of mutant Kit, we evaluated three indolinones (SU11652, SU11654 and SU11655) that act as competitive inhibitors of ATP binding to several members of the split kinase family of RTKs including VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and Kit. Mast cell lines expressing either WT Kit, a point mutation in the JM domain, a tandem duplication in the JM domain, and a point mutation in the catalytic domain were utilized for these studies. All three indolinones inhibited phosphorylation of WT Kit in the presence of SCF at concentrations as low as 0.01 M. Autophosphorylation of both JM mutants was inhibited at 0.01-0.1 M, resulting in cell cycle arrest within 24 hrs, while autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain mutant was inhibited at 0.25-0.5 M, resulting in cell death within 24 hours. PARP cleavage was noted in all Kit mutant lines after indolinone treatment. In summary, SU11652, SU11654, and SU11655 are effective RTK inhibitors capable of disrupting the function of all forms of mutant Kit. As the concentrations of drug necessary for receptor inhibition are readily achievable and non-toxic in vivo, these compounds may have utility in the treatment of spontaneous cancers expressing Kit mutations. 84 EFFICACY OF CARBOPLATIN IN FELINE MAMMARY CAR-CINOMA.

            "text": "There appears to be a high incidence of pancreatitis in the Miniature Schnauzer. In human beings, two major mutations (R117H and N21I) of the cationic trypsinogen gene have been linked with hereditary pancreatitis. These mutations are thought to cause structural changes in the protein. The major mutation, R117H, leads to a decreased ability of prematurely activated trypsin to digest itself, thus allowing for activation of other zymogens and leading to pancreatic autodigestion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cationic trypsinogen gene in Miniature Schnauzers for possible mutations.Four Miniature Schnauzers were selected on the basis of their clinical record including either: 1) presence of a pancreatic biopsy showing pancreatic inflammation, or 2) the presence of clinical signs compatible with pancreatitis (such as vomiting or abdominal pain) and a 5-fold elevation of serum lipase activity, or 3) the presence of clinical signs compatible with pancreatitis and ultrasonographic evidence of pancreatitis (pancreatic edema, ascites in the area of the pancreas, and changes in echogenicity of the pancreas). In addition, a clinically healthy Miniature Schnauzer and a mixed breed dog were selected for comparison. Whole blood samples were obtained from all dogs and DNA was extracted from white blood cells using a commercially available kit (Gentra Systems, PURE-GENE). Primers were designed and optimized to amplify the entire canine cationic trypsinogen cDNA sequence. PCR was performed and each product was purified. (Promega Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System). These PCR products were then sequenced on an automated sequencer. The sequence of the cationic trypsinogen gene of the healthy and the diseased Miniature Schnauzers was compared with that of the healthy control dog and the published sequence for canine cationic trypsinogen.The clinically healthy control dog showed an identical sequence of the cationic trypsinogen gene to the published sequence. The clinically healthy Miniature Schnauzer as well as all 4 Miniature Schnauzers with pancreatitis also showed the same sequence of the cationic trypsinogen gene.We conclude that, in contrast to human beings with hereditary pancreatitis, pancreatitis in the Miniature Schnauzer is not due to mutations of the cationic trypsinogen gene. Recently, serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) concentration has been shown to be highly specific for exocrine pancreatic function and also highly sensitive for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs. Given these encouraging results in the dog and the current limitations in diagnosing feline pancreatitis we established a project in order to develop an immunoassay for measurement of feline PLI in serum. The objective of this project was to purify fPL from pancreatic tissue and partially characterize this protein as a prelude to the development of an assay for measurement of feline PLI in serum.Pancreata were collected from cats, sacrificed for unrelated research projects. After removal of grossly visible fat, pancreatic tissue was crushed in acetone and filtered through a Buchner funnel. In order to completely remove all fat this procedure was repeated a total of 8 times, using acetone and a chloroform butanol mixture. The final extract was resuspended in ethyl ether, and filtered in the Buchner funnel to dryness. Two grams of the delipidated pancreatic extract were further purified by extracting the enzymes in a tris-buffer containing two different protease inhibitors, benzamidine and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by anion-exchange, size-exclusion, and cation-exchange chromatography. The purified protein was partially characterized by molecular mass determination, estimation of specific absorbance, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the first 25 amino acid residues.Feline pancreatic lipase was successfully purified from feline pancreatic tissue. The purified product showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular mass of approximately 52.5 kDa. Exact molecular mass was determined by mass spectrometry to be 52.4 kDa. Approximate specific absorbance at 280 nm of fPL was 1.18 for a 1 mg/ml solution. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 25 amino acid residues showed the sequence Lys-Glu-Ile-X-Phe-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-X-Phe-Ser-Asp-Asp-Ala-Pro-Trp-Ala-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gln-Arg-Pro-Leu. Of 23 identified amino acid residues 19, 16, and 20 matched corresponding residues of canine, human, and porcine classical pancreatic lipase, respectively.We conclude that fPL was successfully purified from feline pancreatic tissue. We recently developed and validated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI). This assay has been shown to be highly specific for exocrine pancreatic function and highly sensitive for a diagnosis of pancreatitis. Based on previous findings that feeding leads to significant increases of serum activities of several digestive enzymes, we currently recommend that serum samples are collected after withholding food for 12 hours. The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of feeding on serum cPLI concentrations.",

None of the dogs showed any abnormalities on physical examination, complete blood count, or serum chemistry profile.

A baseline serum sample (0 min) was collected and dogs were fed a commercial dry canine maintenance diet (Canine Maintenance; Hill's Pet Nutrition). Further serum samples were collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 minutes after feeding. Serum cPLI was measured using an in-house sandwich ELISA. Serum cPLI concentrations at different times after feeding were compared to baseline concentrations using a one-way, repeated measures ANOVA, followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism 3.0). Statistical significance was assigned for values of p\u03fd0.05.Serum cPLI concentrations at baseline ranged from 1.8 to 73.7 g/L (mean \u03eeSD; 28.9 \u03ee28.6 g/L). There was no significant difference in serum cPLI concentrations at any time after feeding when compared to baseline concentrations (p \u03ed 0.131). However, there were fluctuations in serum cPLI concentrations over time. Three of the dogs had baseline serum cPLI concentrations in the lower range of the reference range. Serum cPLI concentrations decreased below the lower limit of the reference range for several of the time points for these 3 dogs. None of the serum cPLI concentrations measured at any time point was increased over the upper limit of the reference range for serum cPLI.We conclude that, in clinically healthy dogs, feeding has no significant influence on serum cPLI concentrations.",

            "text": "We have derived predictive equations to estimate plasma triglyceride (TG) and phospholipid (PL) and neutrophil PL enrichment from dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition data. Using the TG predictive equation and our recently determined Michaelis-Menton kinetic constants (Km) for delta-6 desaturase, concentrations of the dietary competitors (linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic (ALA) acids) needed to assure essential fatty acid status and adequate n-3 fatty acid tissue enrichment were calculated. In our earlier kinetic study, concentrations of total LA and ALA of canine liver microsomes were determined (373 uM and 11 uM respectively). These dogs had been fed a commercial extruded-type diet (32 energy % (en%) total fat with 0.94 en% ALA and 8.75 en% LA). From this diet information, plasma TG-fatty acid concentrations were calculated as 420 uM and 20 uM for LA and ALA respectively which are similar to those seen in the canine microsomes. Thus plasma TG LA and ALA concentrations estimate microsomal total LA and ALA concentrations. These latter fatty acids serve as a substrates for hepatic delta-6 desaturase. A diet with known LA and ALA concentration was then formulated so that the resultant hepatic microsomal LA and ALA content would exceed the delta-6 desaturase Km values for these acids. A 34.6 en% as fat diet was formulated blending beef tallow/safflower oil/linseed oil as fat sources and contained poultry meal and rice. This theoretical diet contained 6.5 en% ALA and 7.4 en% LA. Substituting these values into the derived 2nd order polynomials resulted in estimated concentrations for microsomal ALA (121 M) and LA (377 M). These values both exceed the Km values of 12 and 42 M respectively by a similar factor. Calculated amounts of n-6 LCPUFA and n-3 PUFA using the PL equations for plasma and neutrophils were also consistent with anticipated functional modifications due to PUFA composition alterations from our earlier feeding studies. Diets such as these will need to be produced and tested for safety and measures of efficacy. However, they serve as a point of embarkation to define the amount of more stable sources of n-3 fatty acids needed to achieve desired LCPUFA effects and the utility of our predictive equations in canine nutrition. Exercise is associated with an increased rate of production of reactive oxygen species and a presumed increased requirement for antioxidants. We hypothesized that plasma disappearance of deuterated vitamin E would be more rapid in dogs performing 3 days of strenuous exercise than in sedentary dogs.",

            "text": "Twelve moderately trained Alaskan sled dogs (5 females, 7 males, 2-7 years, 16-25 kg) were randomly divided into 2 groups (exercise, 48 km in a team pulling a sled over snow, 16 km/h for 3 d, or no exercise). Dogs in both groups were administered orally 200: L of D6-RRR-alpha tocopherol (97.8%) with 10 grams of fat 20 hours before start of exercise. Blood samples for measurement of plasma total ''-tocopherol ([vit E]) and D6-'' tocopherol (D6) concentrations were collected before administration of D6, and at regular intervals thereafter (see figure) . Plasma [vit. E] concentrations were affected by exercise (2 way, repeated measures ANOVA, group x time interaction p \u03ed 0.002, see figure) with the exercise group having higher concentrations. Serum [D6] were not different between groups. Results were not different when tocopherol concentrations were adjusted for plasma cholesterol concentration. These results demonstrate that prolonged, repetitive exercise by dogs does not alter the kinetics of plasma concentrations of D6-'' tocopherol after oral administration suggesting that exercise either does not alter the elimination or utilization of vitamin E or affect its apparent volume of distribution. Desaturation of essential fatty acids by delta-6 desaturase is considered the rate-limiting step in their conversion to long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. This enzyme can utilize either linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic acids (ALA). When both acids are present, competition between them for conversion exists. Consequently, methods to characterize enzyme activity against ALA in unpurified or partially purified preparations are fraught with error due to the presence of high endogenous amounts of the competitive substrate, LA, in such preparations. A radioisotopic technique was thus developed to enable the kinetic characterization of the enzyme using radiolabeled ALA. It employed a graphical correction for the presence of varying and competitive amounts of LA in canine hepatic microsomal enzyme preparations. Microsomes were prepared using fresh canine liver which were incubated with 14 C labeled ALA under defined conditions. Lipids were extracted, saponified and phenacylated. Fatty acid phenacyl esters were separated by HPLC and counted. Radioactive product formation (i.e. 18:4n-3) was converted to activity (pmol/min/mg protein). Before correction, delta-6 desaturase activity (V max ) was 50.9 pmol/min mg protein with an apparent K m of 20.8 uM. The V max was lower than that reported in dogs and other species probably the result of the presence of high amounts of the competitive endogenous LA inherent in the microsomal preparations. To correct for this competition, the amounts of LA in each enzyme preparation was first determined by extraction and gas chromatography with internal standardization. Next, all individual microsomal activities measured using 14 C-ALA at known LA concentration were plotted against their respective LA concentration. This technique yielded a series of 12 linear graphs in which LA concentration varied from approximately 15 to 75 uM and which spanned an ALA concentration of from 4 to 200 uM. Extrapolation of each line to its respective y-intercept yielded activity values at LA concentation of zero (i.e. no competitive substrate present). The y-intercept activty values were then plotted against ALA substrate concentration and kinetic analyses performed. The resultant V max increased to 62.4 uM and Km decreased to 12.4 uM. This graphical technique provides a more accurate characterization of canine delta-6 desaturase activity with ALA substrates when unpurified enzymes preparations are studied.",
