            "text": "Bladder cancer has served as one of the most important sources of information about the events that underlie the development of human solid malignancies. Although \"field effects\" that alter the entire bladder mucosa appear to initiate disease, tumors develop along two distinct biological \"tracks\" referred to as papillary and non-papillary that present different challenges for clinical management. More recently, whole organ mapping combined with genomic platforms have identified a novel class of candidate tumor suppressors (forerunner genes) that localize near more familiar tumor suppressors but are disrupted at an earlier stage of cancer development. These studies suggested three steps for the involvement of the model tumor suppressor locus, RB1, in tumor development. In the first step, one allele of forerunner (FR) gene and RB1 is inactivated by deletions. In the second step, homozygous inactivation of the FR genes is accomplished by hypermethylation or mutations. The inactivation of FR genes is associated with the initial clonal expansion of preneoplastic urothelial cells. In the third step, the contiguous tumor suppressor, RB1, is inactivated by a mutation, which is associated with clonal evolution into carcinoma in situ progressing to invasive cancer. Furthermore, we have discovered that aggressive muscle-invasive tumors express molecular markers characteristic of a developmental process known as \"epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.\" Emerging evidence indicates that urothelial cancers contain subpopulations of tumor-initiating cells (cancer stem cells), but the phenotypes of these cells in different tumors may be heterogeneous, raising questions about whether or not the two major subtypes of cancer share a common precursor. Pathology as a medical specialty has been around for about a century and a half, even though the interest in understanding disease, the focus of pathology as an academic discipline, has inspired physicians since the dawn of mankind. Understanding disease remains the primary focus of pathology. In the practice of diagnostic pathology, this knowledge, notably through its morphological expression, is applied to the diagnosis of disease through the examination of cells and tissues. Relatively new in this field is the notion of pathology as 'the science behind the cure'. This phrase, coined by the Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, refers to a widening of the scope of pathology: 'Understanding disease' continues to be applied to diagnosis and classification, but now also to conceiving of new ways to treat and of new diagnostic tools assisting the physician in choosing the appropriate treatment. Targeted therapy, the target being a molecular pathway involved in the pathogenesis of the lesion, along with biomarkers that are predictive for response to treatment, are in the forefront of pathology. Targeted drugs that require 'companion' diagnostics, a combination also called 'theranostics', are reshaping the practice of pathology. It is this paradigm shift in pathology that makes it one of the most exciting medical specialties of today. I would love to be a resident in Pathology again. The prospects for this mother of disciplines in modern medicine have never been as bright. Is this entirely new? Certainly, the molecular revolution with 'high-throughput' technologies, array diagnostics such as 'MammaprintR' and 'deep sequencing' to name just a few technologies we have had to become familiar with, have had and will continue to have in the years to come a profound impact on the way we practice pathology. But guiding the surgeon's hand or the pen of the oncologist in prescribing drugs has been a primary responsibility for pathologists ever since examination of cells and tissues was being applied to the practice of medicine. Prognostic factors have interested pathologists long before the onset of the molecular revolution. Grading and staging of neoplastic disease based upon morphological characteristics remains the mainstay of stratification of patient groups for treatment optimization. And predictive value is not limited to molecular markers: Small cell carcinoma of the lung, to name just one example, will not be treated surgically, but chemotherapy is effective, even though as a rule not to the extent that the patient can be cured. We dispose of numerous morphological parameters that are prognostic and predictive. That pathological parameters have predictive value is therefore nothing new. This has become more so with the discovery that steroid hormone receptor expression predicts the response to anti-hormonal treatment and that HER2/neu amplification predicts the response to HER2/neu antibodies in breast cancer. It has become clear that the type of c-Kit mutation in a GIST predicts whether or not the patient will respond to a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (imatinib), which dose of the drug would be appropriate or which second-generation inhibitor might be used. K-RAS mutations will tell the oncologist that the patient will not respond to EGFR inhibitors in the form of small molecules (gefatinib) or monoclonal antibodies (cituximab). The latter is also a striking example of the limitations of many of the tools that we dispose of: The K-RAS mutation status will tell us who will not respond to the therapy, but not who will. Based upon detailed knowledge of the molecular characteristics of many types of cancer, pharmaceutical companies are now developing a host of new drugs and more often than not are teaming up with pathologists to develop diagnostic tests that might predict which patient groups might profit from the new drug. This should not become a hype, the type of buzz that went around the H1N1 pandemic which in hindsight was not justified by what happened in the field. Let us remain modest. First of all, the number of diseases for which the combination of new drug and predictive molecular test exists remains limited. Secondly, the impact of this new and promising approach to final outcome should keep us modest. For colorectal cancer, new therapies have pro-longed survival, but not cured more patients. Thirdly, expectations that we will be able to predict at the level of the individual patient what the best therapy would be and how the disease will respond or progress is an illusion. 'Individualized' medicine is still based upon studies on large patient groups with as outcome parameters that with a certain level of probability will indicate what might happen. A lot remains to be studied and developed. This implies also a new role for pathology. We should team up with clinical trials, using this context to conduct biomarker studies that can be implemented in daily practice. We should collaborate with drug developers to get to the desired 'companion' diagnostic tools. For pathology, exciting times indeed.",

            "text": "Breast lesions mimicking malignancy Z. Varga* *Switzerland Cell types arising normally in the breast can occasionally exhibit peculiar overgrowth or nuclear features mimicking malignant cells and thus representing potential diagnostic pitfalls. Myoepithelial cell hyperplasia can reach an extensive mass and imitate lobular neoplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ with pagetoid spread. Ductal epithelial cells with apocrine phenotype can appear, with highly worrisome nuclear features making the distinction between a high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ and a banal apocrine change at times quite challenging. The evidence of a preserved myoepithelial layer is a commonly accepted morphological criterion for noninvasive processes in the breast. The distinction between adenosis, highly differentiated ductal carcinomas and cancerisation of the lobules through in situ ductal carcinoma can be easily done by decorating myoepithelial cells in immunohistochemical reactions. An important exception to this rule is, however, the benign microglandular adenosis, which completely lacks the outer myoepithelial layer. Intraductal epithelial proliferations can be quite florid in their extension. The question whether they represent atypical hyperplasia resp. ductal carcinoma in situ or appear simply within the scope of a florid intraductal hyperplasia occurs often in daily diagnostic service. The use of a distinct and technically reliable diagnostic panel (E-cadherin, basal cytokeratins, hormone receptors, Her2 immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation, collagen IV reaction, Ki-67, S-100 and myoepithelial markers) can clear the situation in most of these difficult cases and thus can lead to the correct diagnosis.",

            "text": "Objective: Immunopathological methods, particularly immunohistochemistry (IHC), are now routinely used in all invasive breast carcinoma cases as part of the evaluation of predictive factors (ER, PgR, and HER2). Other IHCdetected antigens are used for the determination of invasiveness (e.g. p63 and SMA), searching of primary (e.g. GCDFP15 and mammaglobin) or in scientific field as surrogates of genetic subtyping (ER, PgR, HER2, EGFR, LMWCK, HMWCK). Increasing breast cancer screening on one hand and advanced surgical methods of biopsy (e.g. core biopsy, vacuum-assisted core biopsy) on the other produce a growing number of pathology material in which pathologists must diagnose on the basis of scarce tissue. Most of these cases are noninvasive. However, the spectrum of possible therapies for noninvasive lesions includes observation on one side and mastectomy with radiotherapy on the other. Method: Therefore, determination of the exact nature of intraductal breast lesions has to be precise and sure. It generates the use of IHC antibodies in intraductal breast lesions. Results: In some cases, results of such approaches create new entities. An example of such situation is differential diagnosis between CLIS and DCIS. In a small number of cases, the interpretation of obtained stains (E-cadherin and CK34BE12) adds entities like positive hybrid lesion and negative hybrid lesion. Conclusion: The aim of the lecture was the presentation of increasingly used IHC antibodies in intraductal breast lesions and its correlation with histological features of usual ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular neoplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and columnar lesions (CCC, CCC+Atypia, CCH, CCH+Atypia) . The other topic is IHC expression of surrogates of genetic subtyping in carcinoma in situ.",

Cserni* *Hungary Background: The TNM, i.e. the tumour node metastasis classification of malignant tumours, is about 70 years old and was last updated in 2009. Although the oncology and pathology communities are expected to use this modified version from 2010, the Breast Working Group and the Organizing Committee has considered including a brief review of the topic in keeping with the educational aspects of the Intercongress Meetings of the European Society of Pathology. Method: The lecture will briefly summarize the basic concepts of the TNM classification in general and will focus on the new aspects which are of interest to pathologists dealing with breast cancer specimens. Some former proposals to modify the TNM will also be discussed, including the European Institute of Oncology proposal to abolish the present categories and replace them with coded prognostic data reporting and the replacement of the nodal categories based on the number of involved lymph nodes by categories based on the lymph node ratio (proportion of involved and examined nodes). Results: NA. Conclusion: The TNM has been criticized for not providing enough prognostic information to guide treatment. However, it must be kept in mind that the TNM was not devised for making treatment decisions solely on the basis of the information it provides but for reporting the anatomic extent of disease in a categorical format. TNM7 still fulfils this aim. No system is perfect, and TNM7 is not an exception to this. Should we use it, let us use it as correctly and uniformly as possible.",

DOG1/Ano1 is a helpful additional marker for the positive identification of GIST. Current prognostication is based on mitotic activity, expressed as mitotic figures per 50 high-power fields in an area of 5 mm 2 and on tumor size. Different criteria are applied for gastric and intestinal GISTs because the latter, even with the same parameters, have a more malignant behavior. In the differential diagnosis of GIST, one has to consider the following facts: wide histologic variation (especially in gastric GISTs), the fact that GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumor in the GI tract and whole abdomen, and occurrence of GISTs virtually anywhere in the abdomen and rarely in distant peripheral metastatic sites. Tumors that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis especially include true smooth muscle tumors, glomus tumor, gastrointestinal schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, desmoid, inflammatory fibroid polyp, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and the newly described plexiform fibromyxoma and gastroblastoma. Conclusion: Detailed histologic examination supported by immunohistochemistry and KIT/PDGFRA mutation analysis will yield optimal diagnostic accuracy.",

Lasota* *USA GISTs are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract and represent a morphological and biological continuum from small, microscopically detected benign tumors to large sarcomas. KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFRA) oncogenic mutations are a typical molecular feature of GIST. KIT and PDGFRA genes map to chromosome 4q12 and encode highly homologous transmembrane glycoproteins. Activation of KIT regulates important cell functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis and adhesion. Imatinib mesylate that specifically inhibits ABL, KIT, and PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases has been successfully used in the treatment of clinically advanced, unresectable, and metastatic GISTs. Majority of KIT exon 11 mutants respond well to imatinib, while KIT exon 9 mutants are less sensitive to imatinib and require more aggressive treatment. Also, tumors with the PDGFRA Asp842Val substitution, which corresponds to imatinib-resistant KIT Asp816Val mutation reported in human mastocytosis, are resistant to imatinib. Although many patients benefit from imatinib treatment, resistance often develops due to secondary KIT or PDGFRA mutations or KIT locus amplification. Sunitinib mesylate, a multi-targeted inhibitor of KIT, PDGFRs, VEGFRs, FLT3, and RET receptor tyrosine kinases and other kinase inhibitors have been used for the treatment of imatinib-resistant GISTs. The type of secondary KIT mutation can indicate response to sunitinib treatment. KIT mutations were identified in mucosal MMs and PDGFRA mutations in gastric and intestinal IFPs. Although the presence of KIT mutation does not necessarily correlate with KIT expression in MM, an inhibition of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase might still be beneficial in the treatment of selected cases. The histopathology of primary non-scarring and scarring alopecias may be complex. The reason for this is that often, the scalp biopsy provided is inadequate, and the clinical history and pattern of the alopecia are not provided to the dermatopathologist. Increased diagnostic yield may be achieved by the combined use of transverse and vertical sections. This requires good communication between the dermatologist performing the biopsies, the dermatopathology laboratory and the dermatopathologist. Common forms of scarring alopecias include the lymphocytic, (discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade of Brocq), the neutrophilic, (folliculitis decalvans, dissecting folliculitis), and the mixed, (acne keloidalis) entities. Among the non-scarring alopecias are androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, trichotillomania and traction alopecia. In all cases of primary alopecia, a multi-team approach involving the dermatologist for adequate tissue sampling, the laboratory for appropriate laboratory processing and the dermatopathologist, together with pertinent clinical information affords the best opportunity of arriving at the correct diagnosis.",

Acute GVHD in the skin has been generally described as an interface dermatitis, with vacuolar basal alteration, dyskeratotic (apoptotic) keratinocytes in the epidermis and/or adnexal structures, scant dermal lymphoid infiltrate, and lymphocytic satellitosis. In contrast, chronic GvHD has commonly been reported as either lichenoid or sclerodermoid GVHD, characterized by homogenization of dermal collagen bundles, with little or no epidermal involvement. At variance with this dichotomic picture, histology of cutaneous GvHD following reduced intensity conditioning regimens is protean, displaying a variable constellation of histopathological alterations. These changes frequently blur the distinction between clear-cut clinical GvHD categories, as known in the classical ablative HSCT setting. Sampling errors and other technical issues may occur and may significantly affect the number of false negative cases. The utility of skin biopsies varies according to the pathologist's experience and to the prevalence of GvHD. Clinicians' overall perception is that undertreatment of GvHD is much worse than overtreatment of patients without GvHD. Therefore, early immunosuppressive therapy in patients with a skin eruption often precedes the results of the histopathological analysis. The pathogenesis and pathology of GVHD will be illustrated by elucidating the selective epithelial targets in the afferent stage and cellular response in the efferent stages. Method: Our practice in a large cancer center sees drug eruptions in the context of cancer treatment and must often be evaluated within a differential diagnosis with graft versus host disease on our bone marrow transplant service.",

It is believed that the glomerular injury in many instances is due to the deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular capillaries. On the other hand, the course of illness in many cancer patients is complicated by infections, which may also be involved in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury. The malignancy is usually found simultaneously with, shortly before, or within a short time after the diagnosis of glomerulopathy. The glomerular lesion of paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome usually presents as membranous nephropathy in patients with solid tumors, particularly adenocarcinomas of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Minimal change disease is strongly associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the most common lesions observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and membranous nephropathy. Extracapillary crescentic glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are rarely associated with neoplasia. Method: We present six cases of nephropathies associated with malignancies: lung, gastric and colon cancer, as well as Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All patients were over the age of 55 and were presenting nephrotic syndrome. Results: Membranous glomerulopathy, minimal change disease and membranoproliferative glomerulopathy were established on the basis of light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The renal lesions in paraneoplastic nephropathies did not differ from idiopathic forms of glomerulopathies. The clinical and morphologic spectrum of plasma cell dyscrasia continues to expand. While in the most advanced stage of this disease patients are diagnosed with overt multiple myeloma, at the opposite end of the spectrum, MGUS is more typical. Not infrequently, the underlying disease is clinically silent or can be associated with renal symptoms that prompt further investigation and thus underscore the role of renal pathologists in the early detection of the underlying process. While light chain cast nephropathy affecting distal tubules and light chain amyloid or non-amyloidotic LCDD are well recognized, in recent years, attention has focussed on the pathology affecting the proximal tubules and interstitium. Proximal tubulopathy associated with an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia may be very subtle and associated with the formation of crystals or only with light chain restriction detectable in the lysomes within proximal tubules. Interstitial nephritis may be associated with a rather nonspecific morphology, and only an enhanced index of suspicion may lead to the discovery of an associated light chain restriction. Thus, renal pathologists are in an advantageous position to diagnose the underlying process at an early stage. Therefore, it is critical to perform a full investigation of the kidney biopsy, including immunofluorescence studies that employ testing for immunoglobulin light chains, as well as electron microscopy. Renal pathologists should be alerted particularly by biopsies that yield seemingly nonspecific or non-diagnostic results. Investigations with Congo red stain, careful evaluation of immunofluorescence studies, and electron microscopic analysis of organized and related deposits are necessary.",

In addition to a direct impact of the tumor or its derivatives like light chains in the case of multiple myeloma, renal injury might also be a consequence of therapeutic interventions. Certain cytostatic drugs (especially platin-based compounds), but also irradiation, are long known to cause renal tissue injury. The damage might affect both the tubulointerstitial space and the vasculature. In addition, it was shown that recently introduced biological agents might lead to additional patterns of drug-induced injury. Blocking the action of VEGF in order to interfere with tumor-induced neoangiogenesis might for example cause renal thrombotic microangiopathy. In my talk, I will discuss the histological patterns of injury caused by the different treatment modalities and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. The knowledge of these mechanisms might help prevent renal damage.

The main adult patterns of interstitial disease can also be observed in children, although UIP, DIP and NSIP are rather rare and not always with similar aetiology (e.g. desquamative interstitial pneumonia, associated with smoking in adults). The distribution of the interstitial changes is in those cases similar to adults, but morphological presentation may be different because of a different lung structure. Some interstitial patterns are specific for childhood: for example, chronic pneumonitis of infancy, pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (formerly cellular interstitial pneumonitis) and neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, but even so, these are not always easy to discern form the other patterns. If a (wedge) lung biopsy is taken at late stage or only from the most severe abnormalities, a characteristic pattern may be obscured by nonspecific common final pathway changes like fibrosis. Conclusion: All diffuse lung diseases in infancy can be caused by many etiologic factors. This means that although there are several hallmarks that can aid in making a proper pathological diagnosis, similar as in adults, proper clinical and radiological information is essential. Objective: Tobacco and cigarettes are implicated in multisystemic carcinogenesis due to carcinogenic components that induce maintained inflammation, endocrine deregulation and genetic alterations in continuum.

Usual interstitial pneumonia is histologically characterized by the presence of fibroblastic foci, cystic changes called honeycombing, areas of fibrosis and scars, and a temporal heterogeneity, which results in areas of early inflammatory changes, late changes, and also areas of uninvolved lung parenchyma. The disease usually starts from the lung periphery in a patchy distribution pattern. The lower lobes are usually more affected than the upper lobes. The disease starts with tiny lesions where the surface epithelium is destroyed. Underneath myofibroblasts are proliferating and the stroma is changed into a myxoid stroma composed of acidic mucopolysaccharides. These lesions are called fibroblastic focus. This repair process is accompanied by a regeneration of pneumocytes, which usually undergo metaplastic changes (bronchiolization, cuboidal metaplasia, stem cell proliferation). Finally, this process results in fibrosis. Several fibrotic areas might finally confluent into a scar tissue. Fibroblastic foci are not only seen in alveolar septa but also in bronchioles and small bronchi. Scarring in these airways results in the obstruction of the airways, and the periphery of these airways undergoes a cystic dilation, accompanied by metaplasia of the epithelium; again, bronchiolization and metaplasia, even squamous metaplasia, can occur. Mucus produced by the epithelium cannot escape, and therefore, the cystic spaces increase in size, being finally visible at CT magnification. These cystic air spaces form the honeycomb lesions. In UIP, fibroblastic foci can be seen in the different stages of development: early stages with lots of myxoid matrix, immature collagen, and many proliferating myofibroblasts and old stages with lots of mature collagen and fibrocytes. Honeycomb lesions may present in a florid stage where some fibroblastic foci can be seen within the cysts, or older lesions with lots of mucus, or old lesions with secondary bacterial pneumonia overlying UIP. Also, the scars can be old, devoid of inflammatory infiltrates, or younger with scattered fibrocytes and lymphocytes. This together forms the temporal heterogeneity of UIP. Fibroblastic foci are often used as the dominant and even sole diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of UIP. This can result in an incorrect diagnosis since other interstitial diseases can also present with fibroblastic foci.",

The general aim of a tumour bank is to acquire neoplastic and control non-neoplastic samples in standardized conditions for research (basic, clinical or translational) . A tumour bank is a vital new resource for cancer research providing high-quality, wellcharacterized tissue. It is possible for pathologists to collect fresh tissue prospectively during their routine dissection procedures. In this way, the specimens can be optimally sampled and stored for both diagnosis and research purposes. Ideally, specimens are sampled immediately after surgery, prior to fixation, to ensure optimal preservation of proteins and nucleic acids. Retrospective collection of tumour tissue for study and banking purposes is feasible also because in most countries, pathology laboratories have been legally obliged to file, for at least some years, the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples that were analyzed. Over the last decade, tumour banks acquired a pivotal role in translational research in the field of oncology, providing tools for the evaluation of new predictive factors; evaluation of the value of a known target in a new entity; search for new therapeutic targets; validation of new diagnostic markers; and implementation of new diagnostic procedures, namely development of tissue-based diagnostic tests for guidance of therapy with new drugs introduced in clinical practice.

There is the necessity to transform our pathology biorepositories into a biobanking network. This can be done through a European organization that could be developed within the ESP and starting from the \"IMPACTS\" groups, which gained a large experience in molecular analysis validation and standardization of this kind of tissues. A European archive tissue biobank network depends on the willingness of the pathologists to participate, considering that this can significantly improve the diffusion of molecular methods, translational research and consequently acceleration of clinical application of molecular methods among pathologists. This can be done by a voluntary and collaborative participation of pathologists in specific projects, as scientific collaborators. The pathology archives will always be clinical biorepositories, and their function is going to change into a biobank function after accepting participation in a specific project, with the anonymization of the personal data of the patients. The networking system is based on low-cost activities with an easy governance and management of the biobanking system and with guarantees of protection of human material and data.

Inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer can be divided into essentially two groups: those that present with a premalignant phenotype (such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and the hamartomatous polyposis syndromes) and those like hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, Lynch syndrome and Muir-Torre syndrome. For predispositions where the underlying genetic basis of the disease is known, much has been learned about disease penetrance and the expected spectrum of disease as increasing numbers of mutation carriers are characterized. This has lead to the reclassification of some defined syndromes as a result of the inherited predisposition being identical. Improved knowledge about disease penetrance has also resulted in a number of questions being raised with respect to what factors influence disease expression in patients known to harbour a mutation in a colorectal cancer susceptibility gene. Of particular interest are additional genetic factors (termed modifier genes) that have been correlated with disease manifestation. More recently, the focus of attention has shifted from familial aggregations of disease where there is a well-defined inherited component to population studies aimed at identifying common low-penetrance disease alleles that are associated with small affect sizes. These studies are significant not only because they are identifying genetic factors associated with colorectal cancer risk but also potential modifier genes that are important in modulating disease expression in persons who harbour a genetic predisposition. Eosinophil functions have been associated for a long time with effector activity in adaptive immune responses during parasitic infections and inflammatory processes in allergic manifestations as well as in mucosal responses. The production by eosinophils of a vast array of cytokines as well as their expression of innate receptors and mediators confer to eosinophils a unique contribution both in inflammatory and adaptive responses but also in immunoregulation and innate immunity. Eosinophils are customary inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, except for the oesophagus. Beneficial function of intestinal eosinophils was their ability to defend host against helminths. However, eosinophil accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract is a common feature of numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases, intestinal vasculitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and food allergy. Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, defined as disorders that selectively affect the gastrointestinal tract with eosinophil-rich inflammation of unknown etiology, include eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis and eosinophilic colitis and are occurring with increasing frequency. Decrease in the rate of parasitic infections in the developed world is associated with a rise in atopic/ allergic disorders and increased hypersensitivity responses to allergens and may represent a driving factor towards the recruitment and activation of gut eosinophils in those disorders. Although the pathogenesis of those disorders is still poorly understood, new findings on gastrointestinal eosinophil proliferation and migration mechanisms involving IL-5 and eotaxins provide a rationale for specific disease therapy. The present review will summarize knowledge on the physiology of gut eosinophils and will illustrate some aspects of eosinophilic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EE) are the two main non-tumoral diseases involving the oesophagus and can develop in both children and adults. The former, the more frequent, is present in up to 20% of the Western population. It is the consequence of a massive flow of gastric contents back into the oesophagus, leading to symptoms or organ damage. Eosinophilic oesophagitis, first reported in 1978 and defined as a specific clinicopathological entity in 1993, is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the oesophagus. Its cause or causes are unknown despite its frequent association with an allergic setting. In 2007, a consensus meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association Institute and the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommended diagnostic criteria for EE. Despite this increased knowledge of both pathologies, GERD and EE present considerable clinical and pathological overlap. Their distinction remains, however, crucial as their clinical outcome and treatment modalities are quite different. The pathologist has to be aware that the diagnosis cannot be based solely on pathological features. The aim of this presentation was to provide pathologist both clinical and histological diagnostic clues in order to propose the most accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

Parasite infections are well known to present with eosinophilia of the gastrointestinal mucosa. A drug-induced aetiology should also always be considered. Gastrointestinal eosinophils may be a feature of connective tissue disease, especially scleroderma, and can accompany vasculitis in polyarteritis nodosa and Churg-Strauss syndrome. With very pronounced peripheral eosinophilia, hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with gastrointestinal involvement, clonal eosinophilia and lymphocytic variant hypereosinophilia should be considered. HES is defined as eosinophilia (\u22651.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L) for at least 6 months, no known cause of eosinophilia, and evidence of organ involvement. The gastrointestinal tract is affected in 25%. When only the digestive tract is involved, it may prove difficult to distinguish HES and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Involvement of the intestinal tract in HES has been associated with limited prognosis and, in some, a fatal outcome. Eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract in HES should be distinguished from eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract in lymphocytic variant hypereosinophilia where eosinophilia is associated with phenotypically abnormal and/or clonal T lymphocytes. Clonal eosinophilia is characterized by neo-plastic proliferation of eosinophils as part of an underlying myeloid malignancy and can accompany any one of the myeloid malignancies. Two distinct subcategories of clonal eosinophilia are recognized: chronic eosinophilic leukaemia, NOS and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with abnormalities involving PDGFRA/PDGFRB or FGFR1.

Normal numbers at different GIT sites are defined in children. However, if in excess, eosinophils may play a key role in the pathogenesis of disease of the GIT, including primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGIDs). Data from the World Wide Web-based registry of EGIDs show that these have a strong genetic and allergic component, 80% having coexistent atopic disease, 62% food sensitisation and 16% with a family member with similar disorders. The most studied EGID in children is eosinophilic oesophagitis; symptoms include feeding intolerance and GERD symptoms. Endoscopy shows a characteristic linear furrowing, and histological features include \u226515 eosinophils/1 HPF (peak count). There is a male preponderance and an allergic and genetic component. Around 7-8% of children are affected by food allergy, most commonly cow's milk allergy and egg and peanut allergies which may manifest as eosinophil-induced GI disorders. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is manifest as allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, allergic proctocolitis and food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) . Eosinophilia is also seen in helminth infection, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and graft vs. host disease where eosinophil density can correlate with disease severity. Recent work has implicated duodenal eosinophilia in functional conditions, particularly paediatric dyspepsia, with success in treatment aimed at the eosinophilmast cell axis.",

Eosinophils can be increased in blood and tissues, notably with Isospora belli. Dientamoeba fragilis infection may even masquerade as allergic colitis. Invasive amoebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica) on the contrary has been associated with a decreased number of tissue eosinophils. Worms may be observed in the egg, larval or adult stage buried in or attached to the bowel wall. Helminthic infections are classically associated with blood and tissue eosinophilia, which can be limited to the place of attachment of the organisms. The number of eosinophils in biopsies can be very high and even suggestive of primary eosinophilic enteritis, e.g. in trichuriasis, anisakiasis and enterobiasis, and with Ancylostoma caninum and Angiostrongylus infections. Alternatively, chronic inflammation with eosinophilia may be confused with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, the latter especially if granulomas are present (as with Schistosoma mansoni infection and more rarely in strongyloidiasis, anisakiasis and enterobiasis). Conclusion: Eosinophils are involved in the defense against many protozoan and helminthic GI parasites. The resulting histological picture may at times be confused with other disorders such as primary eosinophilic enteritis and the idiopathic chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The diagnosis of invasive melanoma is straightforward in most cases. It is based on the recognition of a malignant junctional, in situ component in addition to an invasive dermal component. Classical diagnostic criteria are established mainly for superficial spreading melanoma, being the most common melanoma subtype. The morphological spectrum of melanoma is, however, wide, and distinction from both melanocytic naevi as well as non-melanocytic tumours may be challenging in individual cases. In particular, some benign melanocytic naevi may show concerning histological features overlapping with those of melanoma, resulting in significant potential for overdiagnosis. Melanocytic lesions notoriously difficult to separate from melanoma include dysplastic naevi, naevi of special sites, halo naevi, recurrent naevi, mitotically active naevi and deep penetrating as well as blue naevi. Nonmelanocytic tumours may mimic melanoma by recapitulating a junctional in situ as well as a dermal invasive component showing similar cytological and architectural features, including epithelioid, spindle cell, small cell or desmoplastic differentiation, in addition to immunohistochemical expression of the so-called melanoma markers such as S100, HMB-45 and Melan A. These tumours may be of epithelial, haematolymphoid as well as mesenchymal lineage ranging from benign to outright malignant. Awareness of the critical entities in the differential diagnosis of melanoma and their differentiating features and diagnostic clues is important to avoid misdiagnosis, especially as the treatment modalities and clinical behaviours may differ significantly.",

Batistatou* *Greece Molecular studies of melanocytic lesions are necessary in order to identify additional prognostic and predictive biomarkers and establish the pathways of relevance for targeted therapy. The advent of biotechnology has also enabled the utilization of molecular testing as a diagnostic adjunct in the microscopic evaluation of difficult melanocytic lesions. \u03a4he molecular multistep process of melano-magenesis has been correlated to the Clark model for melanoma development. The first step of melanocytic hyperplasia and nevus formation has been linked to constitutive activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway as a result of somatic mutations of BRAF or N-RAS (or H-RAS or GNAQ). The development of cytologic atypia (dysplastic nevi) is related to alterations in cell growth, apoptosis and DNA repair; inactivation of CDKN2A; and PTEN pathways and TP53. Radial growth phase has been associated with decreased differentiation and deregulated expression of MITF, as well as deficiency in the p16INK4a-Rb pathway. Alterations in cell adhesion, such as reduction/loss of E-cadherin, increase of N-cadherin, \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, MMP-2 and increased expression of osteopontin are associated with the development of radial growth phase and metastatic melanoma. Alternatively, some melanomas (including acral and mucosal) arise de novo and harbor mutations/ amplifications of KIT and amplifications of cyclin D1 or CDK4 genes. Other less frequent, pathogenetic pathways have also been proposed. In the near future, distinct molecular signatures of gene expression may be useful in identifying melanocytic lesions as melanomas or nevi. For melanomas, refined classification systems based on molecular analysis could provide more accurate prognostic markers and enable targeted therapy.",

In the very near future, such testing will be employed for treatment in virtually all cases of metastatic melanoma. Nephron number as determined during nephrogenesis may be one determinant of renal disease and hypertension in later life. Various genetic and epigenetic factors, but also maternal or environmental causes, are known to influence nephron number. An involvement of the kidney in the development of hypertension has been postulated for a long time and supported by experimental studies in rats and sheep. Brenner and colleagues supposed a direct association between nephron number and blood pressure in humans. Their so-called Brenner hypothesis postulated that any reduction in nephron endowment leads to hyperfiltration of the remaining glomeruli, followed by glomerular enlargement with glomerular and then systemic hypertension, resulting in glomerulosclerosis, thereby establishing a vitious circle. In line with this theory, an association of low nephron number and development of hypertension was shown in different animal models as well as in two autopsy studies in humans. Keller et al. found in Caucasian patients with essential hypertension a significantly lower number of glomeruli per kidney than in matched controls. In parallel, mean glomerular volume was more than twice as high in hypertensive patients as in normotensive control patients, indicating compensatory glomerular enlargement. These results were confirmed in a Caucasian American population, whereas in African Americans, there was no association between glomerular number and blood pressure. The pathomechanisms linking low nephron number and hypertension are only partly understood. Among others, inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system, impaired tubular salt handling leading to salt and volume retention, or post-glomerular structural changes have been discussed.",

LN manifests as diverse patterns of immune complexmediated renal disease involving all tissue compartments: glomerular, vascular and tubulointerstitial. IgA nephropathy is a disease of a diverse course and outcome. There were several attempts to create a morphological classification that would serve as a tool efficiently defining the potential responsiveness to the immunosuppressive treatment as well as prognosis in individual cases. The last of these proposals, The Oxford classification of IgA nephropathy, was published in July 2009. The aim of our study was to compare the utility of few functioning classification systems, including Oxford and Hass classifications and Japanese histological grading, as well as our own morphological index of biopsies with IgA nephropathy. On the basis of data collected in Polish Renal Biopsy Registry, we selected 135 IgA nephropathy cases that were characterized by at least 2 years of post-biopsy follow-up, as well as satisfactory tissue material for light microscopy evaluation.

This cell was shown to share features of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, hence its name. In due course, it was found to be the principal cell to effect wound contraction, i.e., wound healing. This unique cell was later defined at the histologic, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, biochemical and pharmacological levels. For the surgical pathologist, the MF is best defined by its ultrastructure. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate a heterogeneous pattern of cytokeletal phenotypes regarding actin isoforms and intermediate filaments. Five immunophenotypes were identified. Ultrastructural features that define the MF include: (a) stress fibers, i.e., bundles of microfilaments with interspersed dense bodies; (b) well-developed cell-to-stroma attachment sites, i.e. fibronexi, intercellular intermediate and gap junctions; and (d) abundant production of extracellular matrix. MFs have been observed in normal tissues, in granulation tissue and in several pathologic settings which will be discussed in detail. Numerous cells can modulate into a MF phenotype: foremost, the local resident fibroblasts, followed by pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, liver perisinusoidal stellate cells, kidney mesangial and tubular epithelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells and mesothelial cells. For the development of the MF phenotype, a two-stage model was proposed. Following tissue injury, complex changes in the microenvironment occur with the release of cytokines and the concerted action of a permanent feedback between intra-and extracellular tension, transforming progenitor cells into proto-MFs and then into differentiated MFs. Three types of pulmonary preneoplastic changes (PPC) are accepted: squamous dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (SD/ CIS), atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), and diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH). SD/CIS are associated with the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). AAH is a pre-invasive lesion for adenocarcinoma (ADC), and DIPNECH may progress to carcinoid. Recently, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS, formerly bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC)) was included among PPC. Pathogenesis of SCC and ADC is a multistep and multicentric process involving the transformation of the normal bronchial mucosa and alveolar lining cells through a continuous spectrum of lesions. The sequence of PPC for SCC includes: hyperplasia > metaplasia (SM) > SD > CIS > SCC; for ADC, it is hyperplasia > AAH/ BAC > ADC; and for carcinoid, it is DIPNECH > tumorlet. Numerous genetic and molecular abnormalities occur in the very early stages of lung carcinogenesis, including hyperplasia and metaplasia and even in normal-appearing bronchial epithelium. It is not known which genetic changes are the most important or at what stage the process is irreversible. SM and hyperplasia can be either a repair or a reactive and reversible process of injured bronchial epithelium. It is found in purely inflammatory settings. These reactive processes usually do not progress to dysplasia and carcinoma. That is, morphology is a gold standard in the diagnosis of both reactive and PPC, and no ancillary studies can be used as a diagnostic aid. The strict histologic criteria are used to assist in the recognition and grading of mucosal lesions.",

            "text": "The most challenging diagnostic problems in pleural biopsies include distinguishing between benign mesothelial hyperplasia and epithelioid malignant mesothelioma and between reactive pleural fibrosis and sarcomatoid or desmoplastic mesothelioma. In addition, sometimes rare tumor types, such as lymphohistiocytoid malignant mesothelioma or epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, may mimic reactive processes. The first question to be considered when handling a problematic pleural biopsy is: Is the biopsy material adequate and representative as can be judged from clinical, imaging and thoracoscopic findings? If in doubt, a new biopsy should be recommended. The distinction between benign and malignant mesothelial proliferation can be made on morphological grounds only, although immunostains, e.g., for EMA and desmin, may favor either a benign or malignant lesion. The most reliable criterion of malignancy is invasion. Immunostains for broad-spectrum cytokeratins may aid in recognizing invasion both in epithelioid and spindle cell lesions. In spindle cell lesions, cytokeratins also help recognize the growth patterns of spindle cells. In reactive pleural fibrosis, a layer of cytokeratin-positive cells may be seen parallel to the pleural surface, whereas in sarcomatoid or desmoplastic mesothelioma, the pattern of spindle cells is haphazard or storiform. Negativity of immunostaining for cytokeratins in a spindle cell lesion should not automatically lead to a conclusion of a benign process as, e.g., sarcomas and about a quarter of sarcomatoid or desmoplastic mesotheliomas are cytokeratinnegative. Correlation of histological and immunochemical findings with clinical and imaging findings is of utmost importance for a correct diagnosis without unnecessary delay. These rare tumours stem from mononuclear phagocytes or antigen-presenting dendritic cells. The latter belong to different cell lineages (either haematopoietic or mesenchymal). Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) affects adults and is characterised by an aggressive clinical course in most instances. HS more often occurs at extranodal sides and consists of pleomorphic, atypical, large cells that are CD68 + , CD163 + , lysozyme + , CD45 + , CD45R0 + , and HLA-DR + . Partial expression of S-100 is recorded. Tumours derived from Langerhans cells (LC). They maintain the phenotypic profile (S100 + , CD1a + , Langerin + ) and ultrastructural features (Birbeck granules + ) of LC. They include LC histiocytosis and LC sarcoma. The former represents a well-known entity, more commonly observed in children: Its behaviour varies according to the stage. The latter is a very aggressive disease of adulthood with overt cytological atypia and dismal prognosis. Interdigitating cell sarcoma (IDCS) is a very rare neoplasm of adulthood that cannot be differentiated from follicular dendritic cell sarcoma morphologically, both being composed of oval fusiform cells growing in fascicles, storiform pattern or 360\u00b0whorls. The diagnosis is based on S-100 and vimentin positivity in the absence of other lineage markers. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) occurs in adults and more often presents in the lymph node, at times within the context of Castleman disease. In 90% of cases, it has an indolent behaviour. Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) consist of two main categories, classical HL (CHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). The latter occasionally shows large diffuse areas. In particular in small biopsies, this generates a difficult differential diagnosis of T cell/ histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL). Immunohistochemistry with a large panel of antibodies may be of help, but cannot solve all problems, and clinical aspects should always be taken into account as well. In view of the important clinical (therapeutic and prognostic) consequences, such cases should also be evaluated by an expert hematopathologist. The second problem is the distinction between CHL and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL) or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) NOS. There may be various situations: a mediastinal mass with a synchronous composite CHL and PMBL with divergent morphology and immunophenotype. This situation may be more frequent than thought since usually, only a small sample from the mediastinal mass is taken. Both lymphomas may also develop metachronously. The coincidence of both lymphoma types is explained by the fact that both lymphomas likely have a common (thymic) origin. Indeed, they share many genetic and molecular features as well. More difficult to understand and diagnose are the cases that arise outside the mediastinum with mixed features of cHL and DLBCL-NOS and cases of otherwise CHL that strongly express CD20 and/ or other B cell markers. In such cases, other diagnoses should be considered as well, such as EBV + DLBCL of the elderly. Several cases will be discussed during the session.",

Almost half of them show such a morphologic and molecular variability as to hamper any further classification and to justify their inclusion in a wastebasket category termed \"not otherwise specified (NOS)\". The latter corresponds to neoplasms with aggressive presentation, poor response to therapy and dismal prognosis. Conversely to B cell lymphomas, PTCLs have so far been the object of a limited number of studies aiming to elucidate their pathobiology and identify novel pharmacologic approaches. Herewith, the authors revise the most recent contributions on the subject based on the experience they gained in the extensive application of microarray technologies. PTCLs/NOS are characterised by the erratic expression of T-cell-associated antigens, including CD4 and CD52, recently proposed as targets for ad hoc immunotherapies. They also show variable Ki-67 marking, rates >80% heralding a worse prognosis. Gene expression profiling (GEP) studies reveal that PTCLs/NOS derive from activated T lymphocytes, more often of the CD4 + type, and bear a signature composed of 155 genes and related products that play a pivotal role for cell signalling transduction, proliferation, apoptosis and matrix remodelling. This observation seems to pave the way to the usage of innovative drugs, such as tyrosine kinase and histone deacetylase inhibitors whose efficacy has been proven in PTCL primary cell cultures. GEP does also allow better distinction of PTCL/ NOS from angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, the latter being characterised by follicular T-helper lymphocyte derivation and CXCL13, PD1 and VEGF expression. The South Saharan African countries are low-resource settings where the histological diagnosis of diseases and consequently the correct managing of the patient are difficult to obtain. Telepathology allows doctors working in remote locations to obtain a definite diagnosis through the transmission of tissue specimen via remote telecommunication. In particular, the \"virtual slide\" system allows capturing a visual image of an entire slide of a specimen which is then forwarded to another location for diagnosis. Association Pathology Beyond Borders (APOF) in 2005, in a small rural hospital in Zambia, to supply to the lack of pathology skilled personnel, started a project to train local staff to become technicians, able to prepare histological and cytological slides and to screen conventional Pap smears. The two Zambian technicians signed out negative Pap smears, and in the presence of abnormal findings, they took pictures of significant diagnostic fields. Then the images were sent through Internet to experts in Italy who, on a rotating roster, were responsible of the final diagnosis.",

Similar guidelines were used to update and adjust the diagnostic parameters according to international consensuses. The allocated funds were mainly used for the purchase of equipment and consumables and for the organization of updating courses dedicated to the technical and medical staff. In places where no skilled personnel were available, longer and more in-depth classes were organized for local staff, both in the place or in Italy.

In particular, there are striking differences in the turnaround time for histopathological diagnosis, in the accuracy of diagnosis that has a profound impact on patients' management and ultimate outcome. The current problems in practice of lymphoid/lymphoma diagnosis include-basing treatment decisions on fine needle aspiration cytology in a large proportion of cases, poor quality histology in a minority of cases where biopsies are performed, complete lack of immunohistochemistry and other supportive investigations, and lack of an update on the current criteria for the diagnosis of various lymphoid pathologies. In Africa, a majority of the laboratories still use the Working Formulation for Clinical Usage, a lymphoma classification from the early 1980s which is based on morphology alone and does not include many entities recognized in the last 20 years. Without accurate diagnosis, any research project and effective patient management cannot be instituted. Though there are no magic answers for an issue of this magnitude, on which other aspects are critically dependent, twinning between institutions in the developed countries and developing countries seems to be the most likely longterm approach. Examples of twinning approach to childhood cancer diagnosis and treatment have been Africa.

            "text": "Once considered a disease of the rich, the pendulum has swung dramatically, and some 70% of new cancer cases in the next decade will be in the developing world. Many poor countries are unable to cope with the accelerating burden of cancer. The essential purpose of the breast cancer pathology report is to communicate pathologic findings that aid in prognostication and guide the selection of appropriate local and systemic treatment for patients with breast cancer. To be clinically useful, the content of the report must change as new prognostic and predictive factors are validated and others become obsolete. In 2010, the list of useful featuresthose which are grounds for specific therapeutic actions-is relatively short: the anatomic extent of disease in the breast and axilla (AJCC/UICC stage), the specimen margin status, and measures of certain cancer cell proteins (hormone receptors, HER-2/neu) that predict the likelihood of response to specific adjuvant therapies. Histological subtype, carcinoma grade, the presence of lymphatic tumor emboli, the finding of Paget disease in a mastectomy specimen are also often reported, but do not inform specific treatments the way that stage, margin status and predictive markers do. In patients with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, the pathologist selects a paraffin-embedded tumor sample for the Oncotype DX assay, which is used to predict the risk of recurrence in patients treated with tamoxifen and may addend the recurrence score to the surgical pathology report. The breast cancer pathology report in 2010 is vital to appropriate breast cancer treatment, but can be expected to evolve. In order to assure the quality of pathology in all of Sweden, the Swedish Society of Pathology has instituted organspecific quality assurance and standardization groups. These groups consist of dedicated pathologists from many subspecialty areas and are called KVAST groups. They meet regularly and their principal work is to formulate and maintain a document with guidelines which has a common framework for all the organ-specific groups. Our group prepares the guidelines for breast pathology. The mandatory sections in all the guidelines include clinical background information, instructions to clinicians as how to handle the specimens, what information is needed on the requisition form, gross description, analyses, what information must be reported by the pathologist (gross and microscopic), recommended classification system, administration and miscellaneous. Sweden has a national cancer strategy programme emphasizing a patient perspective by focusing the patient process instead of piecing the treatment process together through independent specialities, as has been done previously. In 2008, a group of breast cancer clinicians established a national quality register for breast cancer patients called INCA which also include a pathology section. In collaboration with the Swedish Breast Cancer Group and the breast KVAST group, another group called SweQA works with quality assurance programmes of the biomarkers used in routine pathology; estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2 status, and histologic grade. The guidelines for breast pathology will require the breast pathologists to participate in the breast cancer patient process by focusing on the standardisation of requisition and pathology reports and quality assurance of biomarkers.",

Writing national guidelines is useful in order to achieve better consistency in reporting at the level of a geographic area, Hungary. As not all countries have their national guidelines on breast reporting, it was thought useful to provide some examples of how guidelines can be constructed and/or adopted. Method: The text of the Hungarian guidelines on breast pathology reporting was written by a committee of pathologists with expertise in breast pathology. The basis of the new text was a consensus document from 10 years ago. This was rewritten, circulated, and modified several times, and the updated text, ready for wider discussion, was put on the web (Internet) along with four other texts (diagnostic radiology/imaging including nuclear medicine; surgery including reconstructive surgery; radiotherapy; and systemic therapy). The URL allowing access to the texts was widely circulated on discipline-specific web sites. A Consensus Conference was organized for live discussion, and written comments were also welcome both from the writing committee members of the other texts and from the wider medical community (the other texts were discussed similarly to allow better congruence). All relevant comments were incorporated and the pre-final text was discussed at the Consensus Conference. The writing committee finalized the text on the basis of the relevant comments discussed at the conference. The pathology Guidelines were scheduled for publication with the other texts in the national oncology journal, Magyar Onkologia (Hungarian Oncology). Results: NA. Conclusion: NA.",

On the basis of both the answers to those questions and medicine-based evidence, Polish guidelines are going to be compiled. The transplant nephrologist decides to biopsy a given patient on the basis of clinical symptoms and laboratory data. The renal pathologist then makes a histological diagnosis which allows an evidence-based approach to specific therapy, which again will be decided on by the clinician. Renal transplant diagnoses generally fall into one of five categories: preexisting donor-related diseases, rejection, drug toxicity, infection, recurrent or de novo renal diseases. Although many diagnoses are typically encountered during a certain phase after transplantation, clinical information alone will often not suffice to differentiate between diagnoses, which require a totally opposite treatment regimen. The timing of the biopsy is most important to achieve a successful treatment and to avoid irreversible damage to the transplant. The rule of thumb at our center is to biopsy early in delayed graft function if there is a change in serum creatinine of more than 0.5 mg/dl or there is a newly diagnosed or increased proteinuria. Sufficient biopsy material, adequate workup including C4d and SV40 immunohistochemistry, and an experienced pathologist are the other prerequisites. A close collaboration between nephrologist and pathologist with regular case discussions not only helps understand the viewpoint of the clinical/pathological partner but will also aid in patient management.",

We examined in 94 zero-hour biopsies the frequency and severity of nonspecific morphological lesions semiquantitatively. The wall thickness/lumen (W/L) ratio of each artery present in the biopsy was determined by morphometry. Among the arterial changes studied, only the intimal fibroelastosis (IFE) of moderate degree (frequency, 26.6%) revealed a significant correlation with serum creatinine at 48 months (p<0.01). In IFE, there was also a significant correlation with the frequency and severity of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (p<0.001). By morphometry, a significant association was found between the mean W/L ratios of arteries and the degree of IFE (p<0.01). According to Hungarian experience, donor kidneys with a moderate degree of IFE do indeed have a higher risk of late graft dysfunction. The analogically defined Polish retrospective study revealed that the presence of arteriolar hyalinisation in the implantation biopsy was associated with more profound reduction of GFR at 3rd, 6th and 12th months after transplantation in those patients who experienced episodes of an acute rejection (p=0.018) within first 12 post-transplant months. This suggests that donor-derived arteriolar hyalinisation predisposes to more severe acute rejection-associated graft damage.",

            "text": "Background: It has become evident that antibody-mediated immunity plays a critical role in acute and chronic allograft rejection. According to the Banff scheme, serological alloantibody detection represents one of the major diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). The design of sophisticated diagnostic tests for prediction and monitoring of AMR has become a major goal in transplant medicine. Method: An important innovation has been the establishment of solid phase HLA antibody detection using flow cytometry, ELISA or Luminex technology. In this context, Luminex-based bead array technology represents an attractive strategy for a detailed analysis of anti-HLA reactivity patterns. Salivary and mammary glands share an identical ductuloacinar architecture, and thus, it is not surprising that lesions and tumours arising in both organs share considerable histologic similarities. Salivary-type tumours are well known in breast; in contrast, breast-like lesions are rarely described in salivary glands. One of the commonest breast conditions, benign fibrocystic disease, was not thought to have a salivary counterpart, but recently, sclerosing polycystic adenosis (SPA) was described as a distinctive neoplastic lesion of the major salivary glands. Although SPA has many histologic similarities to its mammary counterpart, it represents a true neoplastic condition characterized by clonality, focal dysplasia, and a tendency to recur. Up till now, secretory carcinoma (SC) has been considered to occur only in the breast. Recently, we published a series of 16 salivary gland tumors with histomorphological and immunohistochemical features reminiscent of SC of the breast. This is an unusual, hitherto undescribed, distinctive salivary gland tumor, with some morphological features of both salivary acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) and mammary SC, characterized immunohistochemically by strong vimentin and S-100 protein positivity. Microscopically, the tumours exhibit a lobulated growth pattern, and they are composed of microcystic and glandular spaces with abundant eosinophilic homogenous or bubbly secretory material, which is positive for PAS, mucicarmine, MUC1, MUC4, and mammaglobin. The decision to undertake the sequencing of the entire human genome stemmed from many sources, in particular Rrenato Dulbecco's 1986 seminal article in Science (1986; 231:1055 -1056 . Extraordinary technical advances were required to facilitate this, but few could have predicted the attendant conceptual revolutions. Since the publication in 2001 of the first draft of the human genome (and the parallel reports of the sequences of many other genomes), our view of the complexity of the organisation and regulation of genomes has increased. The EnCode project (Genome Res 2007; 17:669-681) further highlighted the extraordinary diversity of transcription and demonstrated that the protein coding regions are but a fraction of the transcriptome. The importance of non-coding regions in genome regulation has become manifest, and the diversity of splicing events was previously unsuspected. The previous drip of new information has become a torrent, and 'next-generation' sequencing technologies promise to increase this driving cost of sequencing entire genomes to sub-$1,000 levels. The timescale of generating data similarly collapses to a mere fraction of that required even 2 years ago. The information load will be immense and new approaches will be needed to deal with the impact of this on clinical decision making. The consequences for these developments are perhaps unfathomable at present, but we are challenged to find ways to take advantage of these developments lest pathology be bypassed by other disciplines. Central to this will be educational programmes at the undergraduate and postgraduate level to 'future proof' tomorrows clinicians, including pathologists.",

However, IHC is an assay influenced by multiple parameters and the final result is highly dependent on the choice and performance of these variables. In the protocol setup for IHC, both the preanalytical, analytical and post-analytical parameters will affect IHC staining, and it is of utmost importance to be familiar with these technical aspects in order to use IHC as a diagnostic tool. In the pre-analytical phase, fixation still is the key element for a reliable result, and it is essential that fixation is standardized with respect to the choice of fixative, time to and time in fixative in order to get consistent results and to avoid false negative or false positive reactions. The implementation of new tissue processing techniques based on, e.g. modified reagents, can also affect the staining result. Regarding the analytical phase, the three key elements are: (1) appropriate epitope retrieval, (2) a sensitive and specific primary antibody, and (3) a robust detection system. In external quality programs for IHC, it has been shown that most errors in IHC are related to epitope retrieval and/or the primary antibody. To validate the performance and consistency of IHC, it is necessary to use internal and external controls. Especially the use of multi-tissue blocks containing tissues with different levels of the antigen is superior to single control blocks.",

A-Antibody clone: The spectrum of reactivity and cross-reactivity should be known. According to the Banff Classification, antibody-mediated renal allograft rejection (ABMR) is defined by circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA), C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries (PTC), and histologically detectable graft injury. These diagnostic criteria had primarily been developed and validated in biopsies from patients with early post-transplant dysfunction. Results from studies in patients without clinically detectable graft dysfunction, however, cast doubt on the universal applicability of these criteria. In my talk, I will address the following issues: (1) C4d deposits but no ABMR? Findings in protocol biopsies from patients with stable renal function indicate that C4d deposition is not necessarily always associated with renal dysfunction. The low predictive value of C4d in these patients might be due to the accommodation of grafts and highlights the fact that the diagnostic impact of C4d strongly depends on the clinical context. (2) ABMR but no C4d? Complement activation likely is not only of diagnostic importance but also part of the pathogenesis of ABMR. Results from gene expression profiling studies in human graft biopsies and from animal models, however, suggest that there also might be complement-independent mechanism of ABMR. Especially the lesions of chronic rejection might at least in part result from antibodymediated complement-independent endothelial injury. (3) Are \"atypical\" staining patterns of diagnostic relevance? C4d can, in addition to the diagnostically relevant linear deposition in PTC, also be found in other locations and different staining patterns. It, however, appears that these other/additional staining patterns are of limited diagnostic value, at least for the detection of AMBR. During gestation, several microorganisms can infect the foetus and damage the developing nervous system, leading to severe neurodevelopmental sequelae. The acronym TORCH was introduced to refer to these organisms including toxoplasmosis, other microorganisms, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. TORCH infections share similar clinical features: The maternal infection is regularly asymptomatic, the clinical presentation of infected fetuses and neonates is quite identical, and, sometimes, a clinically silent infection in the neonatal period will be responsible for permanent neurological deficits occurring later in infancy. Extensive immunization programs, in developed countries, have led to an impressive decrease of congenital rubella syndrome, and the development of strategies of prenatal diagnosis and antimicrobial therapies has improved the management of congenital infections. Despite these significant advances, TORCH infections remain a worrying cause of vision loss, hearing loss, and neurological disabilities in both developed and developing countries, and new syndromes have emerged such as congenital infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human parvovirus B19. In addition, in the two last decades, growing evidence has supported the hypothesis of a significant association between choriamnionitis and cerebral palsy: brain lesions would result from a production of cytokines through a mechanism of toxicity. A wealth of literature has summarized current knowledge concerning epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosis and the management of congenital infections. In this presentation, we will focus on the neuropathological features of the most frequent intrauterine infections and underscore the invaluable contribution of neuropathological studies in understanding the pathogenesis of developing brain lesions.",

Dural development is not complete at birth; it undergoes considerable remodelling in early life. The meninges develop from primitive mesenchyme derived from the neural crest. The dura has two leaflets, the outer periosteal and the inner meningeal which forms the falx and tentorium. Between them are the venous sinuses, which drain the entire venous outflow of the brain. Bridging veins are few and carry high blood flow. A muscular sphincter at their junction with the dura regulates blood flow when intracranial pressure increases. A venous plexus, most extensive at birth, is found in the posterior falx, tentorium and the parasagittal regions. Arachnoid granulations develop at 7 months of postnatal life. Originally thought to be responsible for drainage of CSF, they more likely monitor CSF homeostasis and pressure. Fluid channels in the dura may represent a system for the uptake of CSF. In early life, blood may reflux into these channels from the venous sinuses, causing intradural bleeding which is common in immature infants. Dural bleeding causes symptoms such as seizures and vomiting difficulties and is associated with age-related imaging changes in the underlying brain parenchyma. We do not yet understand the pathophysiology of these observations. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (ME) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases, secondary to respiratory chain dysfunction, impaired ATP production and energy crisis in the affected cells. ME could be associated with defective nuclear (nDNA) or mitochondrial (mDNA) genome, resulting in autosomal or maternal inheritance, respectively. Although multiple organ involvement is very common, the most affected are tissues with high oxidative metabolism such as CNS, myocardium and striated muscle. Myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres (MERRF), mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Leber's hereditary optic atrophy (LHOA), Kearns-Sayre syndrome and Leigh's disease represent the classical examples of ME. Precise phenotype/genotype correlations are very difficult due to the presence of overlap syndromes and atypical cases. The topography of lesions in the CNS determines symptomatology and varies in these conditions. Morphologically, ME are characterized by variably expressed mitochondrial abnormalities such as intra-mitochondrial crystalloid inclusions and ragged red fibres (RRF) in muscle biopsies, as well as selective neuronal loss in different CNS structures, laminar cortical necroses, microinfarctions and spongy degeneration in the grey or white matter. However, the common and diagnostically useful feature is the presence of COX-negative fibres, abnormal ultrastructure of muscle mitochondria and variably expressed vascular abnormalities. Although clinicopathological correlations are often problematic, the involvement of small caliber vessels may explain many focal CNS manifestations, while multisystem disease is very likely secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction in the neuronal component. Results: Kuru in the fore language means to shiver or to shake from fever and cold. Ritualistic endocannibalism (eating of the relatives as a part of a mourning ritual, but not as an alimentary habit) was practiced not only in the kuru area but in many surrounding Eastern Highland groups which never developed kuru. The most striking neuropathologic feature of kuru was the presence of numerous amyloid plaques. Conclusion: We may also speculate what would happen if kuru had not been discovered or did not exist. The infectious nature of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease would probably not have been suspected until the beginning of the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) outbreak in the UK. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker disease would have remained for decades as obscure neurodegenerations of merely academic interest. The familial forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease would not have benefited from PRNP gene analysis, but only later would have been studied by linkage analysis and reverse genetics probably. The whole field would have probably remained of only arcane interest to veterinarians until the BSE epidemic began to exert its devastating effect. The discovery of vCJD would have been delayed as no surveillance would have been initiated for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. And, perhaps most importantly, the sea change in mentality that has led to the conception of 'protein misfolding diseases', including not only the neurodegenerative but also an increasing number of nonneurological disorders, would have been delayed by decades.",

In macroautophagy, proteins and organelles are sequestrated into a double membrane-bound vacuole called autophagosome, formed by the ER membranes, under the direction of various proteins including MAP-LC3 (a microtubule-associated protein, light chain 3). In addition to maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy may also contribute to cell damage. Recently, autophagy was reported to be involved in many pathological processes including neurodegeneration, inflammatory processes and cancer. The role of autophagy in neurodegeneration is not only in removing protein aggregates but also in inducing the neuronal death.

The role of autophagy in cancer seems to be dual: On one hand, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that autophagy may represent a tumor suppressor mechanism by reducing intratumoral necrosis, restricting oxidative stress and limiting chromosomal instability; on the other hand, autophagy may be an important process used by tumor cells to escape various types of stress and even therapeutic agents.",

The common occurrence of benign thyroid nodules mandates an effective method for preoperative screening. The diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, by far the most common thyroid malignancy, is based on the identification of specific cytologic features. Therefore, fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has easily emerged in the past 30 years as the most accurate and cost-effective tool, indeed a true cornerstone, for the preoperative management of thyroid nodules. Standardized terminology to report diagnoses is highly recommended and is being implemented worldwide. The type of genetic alterations in thyroid cancer and the very nature of FNAB samples make them ideally suited for molecular analysis. On the other end, the importance of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis has been constantly decreasing over the years as a direct consequence of the widespread application of FNAB. It is now usually performed with cases that are suspicious after FNAB and may be useful in some cases with indeterminate cytologic diagnosis.",

            "text": "Malignant thyroid tumors are generally divided into welldifferentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas, the former usually having a low malignant clinical behavior and good prognosis, and the latter being almost all very aggressive and rapidly fatal. Diagnostic criteria rely on the recognition of cytological characteristics (i.e. nuclear alterations specific for papillary carcinoma), architectural patterns (i.e. papillary, follicular, solid, trabecular, insular or diffuse), high-grade features (i.e. increased mitotic index, necrosis) and invasive properties (i.e. vascular and/or capsular invasion). All of the aforementioned features are alternatively used as diagnostic hallmarks of specific histotypes, as peculiarities of specific variants, or as markers of aggressiveness, and their recognition is therefore essential to classify and stratify prognostically each individual tumor. The presence of vascular invasion is essential to recognize the malignant nature of a follicular tumor, but its extent is the major prognostic parameter in follicular carcinoma and draws a line between minimally invasive and widely invasive forms that are characterized by distinctive clinical outcomes. Necrosis and high mitotic index usually occur in aggressive cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but together with the presence of solid/insular/ trabecular growth patterns represent the diagnostic features of poorly differentiated carcinoma, a specific tumor entity that shows a clinical behavior intermediate between welldifferentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas. At variance, the presence of a solid growth pattern in an otherwise typical papillary carcinoma depicts its solid variant, which is more often encountered in children and radiation-exposed individuals but has a clinical behavior usually similar to its conventional counterpart. As indicated by the World Health Organisation (WHO), histological grading is a way of predicting the biological behaviour of neoplasms. Especially in neuropathological settings, tumour grade is often the key factor determining therapeutic decisions. Clinical, radiological, macroscopic, histological and ultrastructural factors may already be summarized in a diagnosis that very well reflects the biology of the respective tumour entity, at least to a certain degree, but usually not in a personalized manner. This is exactly the stage where molecular biology comes into play. In recent years, much effort has been made on molecular characterization of brain tumours as there is an urgent need for specific and sensitive, highly reproducible tumour markers with a prognostic as well as predictive value. State of the art in modern neuropathology therefore ranges from basic immunohistochemical profiling, evaluation of genetic susceptibility, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) approaches, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), screening for genetic hallmark mutations, evaluation of mRNA expression of specific growth factor receptors, assessment of promoter methylation status and gene expression profiling to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses. The challenge now for pathologists confronted with brain tumours is to integrate knowledge derived from the latest molecular biological methods into the established panel of pure morphology-based investigations. Objective: Skeinoid fibres are globular brightly eosinophilic PAS-positive extracellular collagen deposits seen commonly in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) of the small bowel. Ultrastructurally, they display similarity to \"skeins of yearn\", hence the name. However, hyaline globules are occasionally encountered in leiomyomatous GI neoplasms and may be mistaken for true skeinoid fibres leading, to an erroneous diagnosis of GIST. Method: We analyzed 93 histologically and immunohistochemically well-characterized true smooth muscle neoplasms of the GI tract for the presence of hyaline globules and examined representative examples of them from formalin-fixed and deparaffinized tissue by electron microscopy.",

Similar to surrounding tumour cells, hyaline globules expressed desmin, alpha-SMA and h-caldesmon, but were negative for CD117 and CD34. The mostly ovoid-shaped structures displayed at ultrastructural examination variably oriented bundles of filaments with a diameter of approximately 6-8 nm. At the periphery of these inclusions, altered filamentous material was recognized in different stages of degeneration with variable condensed matrix and occasional peripheral condensation suggestive of calcification. True skeinoid fibres were not detected. Conclusion: The above findings are consistent with a multistep degenerative phenomenon affecting individual smooth muscle cells in paucicellular GI leiomyomas.

In the kidney and the urinary tract, the diseases most often presenting as a pseudotumour are malakoplakia and xantogranulomatous pyelonephritis. In fact, both of them can be considered inflammatory pseudotumours, i.e. inflammatory processes producing a mass effect. A more restrictive use of the term inflammatory pseudotumour applies to a subset of lesions that was initially known as myofibroblastic inflammatory pseudotumour and is currently referred to as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. Ultrastructural examination reveals the pathogenesis of malakoplakia as a defect in the mechanisms of lysosomal extrusion from histiocytes. Thus, the profusion of secondary lysosomes constitutes an optimal milieu for the deposition of calcium salts in typical Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. On the other hand, the foamy histiocytes of xantogranulomatous pyelonephritis are characterised by a profusion of myelin bodies due to the predominant phospholipid composition of the lysosomes, resulting from chronic destruction of renal tissue and bacterial degradation. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is a true neoplastic lesion with myofibroblastic differentiation and a prominent inflammatory background. This is an important differential diagnosis for both malakoplakia and xantogranulomatous pyelonephritis that may have an extensive myofibroblastic component. Similar to its crucial role in kidney tumours, electron microscopy is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of renal pseudotumours and has been essential in the elucidation of their pathogenesis.",

An infectious process has to be considered as a differential diagnosis in all cases, especially in the setting of immunosuppression (HIV infection, transplantation, chemotherapy, inborn defects). FNA allows a rapid distinction between neoplastic and inflammatory/infectious lesions. A wide range of pathogens including various viruses (CMV, EBV), bacteria (Grampositive cocci, actinomyces, spirochetes, mycobacteria), fungi (Aspergillus, Cryptococcus) and parasites (toxoplasma, echinococcus) may be identified cytologically. Infectious agents may be visualised either direct in standard stainings (CMV, fungi), in special stainings (mycobacteria) or immunohistochemically (spirochetes), either on direct smears or in cell blocks. Molecular methods (in situ hybridization, PCR with sequencing) applied to FNA specimen help identify and often subtype the pathogen if required (EBV, mycobacterium tuberculosis vs. atypical mycobacteriosis). FNA is a particularly convenient method for fresh, sterile sample collection for microbiological examination with culture and drug resistance studies, playing an important role in treatment decision, e.g. in therapy of multiresistant tuberculosis. In some infectious diseases, the final diagnosis may be made by serology following indirect cytological hints in a FNA specimen (e.g. toxoplasmosis, HIV). Interestingly, infectious agents have been identified as aetiologically relevant factors in several tumor types (EBV in Burkitt lymphoma or lymphoepithelial carcinoma, HHV8 in Kaposi sarcoma, HPV in oropharyngeal carcinoma), so that the identification of the pathogens in FNAs may play an important role in the precise diagnosis of some neoplasias.",

Pathologists' interpretations of tissue lesions become data, guiding decisions for patient management. Cognition, the sum of processes by which the visual input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered and used, is very important in pathology. Looking through the microscope at the stained tissue section (global impression and focal search) leads to perception of forms and colours. Various regions are examined under low and high magnifications. Then the pathologist puts the observed pieces of the colourful puzzle in place. An experienced pathologist proceeds promptly to pattern recognition and probably to diagnosis, while a novice takes more time, usually by not focusing on the significant areas but rather via an exhaustive search of the whole slide. Non-verbalized pattern recognition consists of short sequences which result from conversion of longer series of specific features. Alternative cognitive methods are diagnostic algorithms and the hypothetico-deductive strategy. Experienced pathologists perceive each case as a whole, constituted by parts varying in importance and relevance. And while novices prefer to use analytic reasoning strategies, which are conscious and controlled, experts often use implicit reasoning, which is unconscious and automatic and relies largely on tacit knowledge. Pathologists have faith in the analysis of morphology whose power has been appreciated even in the current molecular era. The use of virtual microscopy has a great advantage over the exchange of static images for diagnosis and training since it also allows for the initial steps to diagnosis, i.e. search, detection and perception. pathology diagnoses were asked for in the context of quality control of cervical cytology and dermatopathology. Conclusion: In patient care, the 423 Dutch pathologists profit from the historical pathology diagnoses dating back to 1971. For quality control of the LCPL, the diagnoses of other pathology laboratories of the hospitals where the patients of the general practitioners were operated provided by the PALGA are of paramount importance. In 2010, the PALGA system will also be employed for the nationwide evaluation of the early detection of cervix, breast, and colon carcinoma.",

In contrast to the increasing application in educations, the virtual microscopy is far from routine use in surgical pathology. This goes back to several reasons concerning technical and personal requirements: costs (scanning devices and storage), scanning time (between 1 and 5 min for a biopsy and between 5 and 20 min for a surgical specimen) and speed of virtual microscopes in comparison to conventional microscopy.",

In this course, an overview is presented of the precursors of squamous cell carcinoma, its mimics, microinvasive carcinoma and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. The CIN terminology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grades 1-3) of Richart is most widely used for cervical cancer precursors. Nowadays, it is evident that CIN is not a continuum, but reflects merely a low-grade entity (koilocytosis, flat condyloma and CIN1) and conversely a true intraepithelial neoplastic process (CIN2-3 and carcinoma in situ). In diagnosing CIN, HPV testing is not recommended. On the contrary, post-treatment HPV testing can predict treatment failure and thus residual CIN. In grading CIN and to differentiate CIN from its mimics as atrophy, immature metaplasia or reserve cell hyperplasia immunohistochemistry (Mib1 and P16) can be applied. Due to preceding biopsies, microinvasive carcinoma is frequently overdiagnosed. Colposcopy, cytology and immunohistochemistry are not very helpful in diagnosing microinvasive growth.

The obtained results can be scaled and associated with the underlying disease. In reverse, knowing the applied algorithms and the object (and structure) features, CBIR can be applied. Without predefined knowledge, basic image information is mapped on spatial image units (pixels), called texture.

The accuracy of the methods in field of view selection was computed to >98%, that of prospective disease classification >95%. Hyperplastic lesions of the appendiceal mucosa are classically divided into two groups: diffuse hyperplasia and localized polyps. Localized lesions were usually diagnosed as hyperplastic polyps, but some of these lesions are now better classified as sessile serrated adenomas. Both diffuse hyperplasia and polyps are in most cases incidental findings on appendectomy specimens (performed for appendicitis or systematically sampled in a colectomy specimen). However, these lesions are significantly associated with colon adeno-carcinoma, and therefore, their discovery in an appendectomy specimen is an indication of further examination to exclude colorectal neoplasia. Diffuse mucosal hyperplasia extends to more than one half of the circumference of the appendiceal mucosa. It exhibits elongated crypts with serrated architecture. The epithelium is composed of columnar cells alternating with large goblet cells in various proportions. The crypt bases are not serrated and are lined by regular cells with no atypia. Hyperplastic polyps are supposed to be rare in the vermiform appendix. They are localized lesions, with a histological aspect similar to the corresponding colorectal lesions. Similarly to diffuse mucosal hyperplasia, they are characterized by a serrated architecture restricted to the upper part of the crypts and by the lack of any dysplastic features. When lesions associate hyperplastic serrated features in one area and adenomatous (tubular and/or villous) features in another, they are designated as mixed adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps, as tumours of the colon and rectum. However, it is probable that at least part of these mixed lesions represent hyperplastic serrated polyps that have progressed to dysplasia. Sessile serrated adenoma (or sessile serrated polyp or serrated polyp with abnormal proliferation) is a more recently described type of colorectal polyp with a serrated architecture. They occur frequently in the right colon, and although they resemble to hyperplastic polyps, they are characterized by subtle architectural and cytological features, especially dilation and serration of the basal part of the crypts. They can be dysplastic or not. The relative frequency of sessile serrated adenomas and other serrated lesions of the appendix is not well established, but it is highly probable that many appendiceal lesions previously designated as diffuse hyperplasia or hyperplastic polyp represent cases of sessile serrated adenomas. Both types of lesions have been proven to show decreased expression of MLH1 and MGMT in a majority of cases and also BRAF mutation in a significant proportion of cases. These genetic and epigenetic alterations are similar to those observed in sessile serrated adenoma of the colon, which is now considered as a precursor lesion for a subgroup of colorectal cancer. The differential diagnosis of serrated lesions of the appendix also includes adenomas of colorectal type (more often showing villous architecture when compared to colorectal lesions) and low-grade mucinous neoplasms, often referred to as cystadenomas.",

Jouret-Mourin* *Cliniques Universitaires ST LUC, Brussels, Belgium Primary adenocarcinoma of the appendix is unusual. Some resemble typical colonic adenocarcinoma in their appear-ance and behaviour, but others are well-differentiated neoplasms or adenoma-like that may be associated with the pseudomyxoma peritonei syndrome without distant metastases. This pathological spectrum is confused because of terminological inconsistencies and the large variety of diagnostic criteria. Therefore, there remains a \"grey area\" between benign and malignant lesions. Some authors have recently proposed a new terminology based on the biological potential of the different lesions. Lowgrade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is defined as a subset of lesions that have low-grade cytological atypia and minimal architectural complexity. These lesions penetrate into or through the appendiceal wall often on a broad front, without overt invasion and may be associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei. Consequently, such LAMN category includes the old terms of \"tumours of uncertain malignant potential, \"pseudomyxoma with adenoma-like histology\" and the \"low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma\" which can also produce pseudomyxoma. Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (MACA) includes a destructive invasion of the appendiceal wall with high-grade atypia, complex proliferation (i.e. cribriform pattern), desmoplastic stroma, signet ring cells differentiation or undifferentiated tumours. Lymph node metastases occur lately, but peritoneal spreading is more frequent. Some recent publications have demonstrated that protein immunoexpression profiles offer predictive factors of adverse clinical outcomes, which should further facilitate the classification of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. Appendiceal mucinous tumours can occur in patients who have suffered long-standing ulcerative colitis, familial polyposis and HNPCC syndrome. Most of them show microsatellite instability probably given the high frequency of serrated precursor. Pseudomyxoma peritonei syndrome is defined as the presence of abundant mucinous material on the peritoneal surface. This entity should be retained as a clinical term. Besides exceptional cases of pseudomyxoma reported in association with mucinous carcinomas at other sites, all cases of pseudomyxoma peritonei are related to appendiceal rupture with subsequent transcelomic spread of tumoral cells. Some authors have proposed that the same terminology should be used for the appendiceal primaries and the peritoneal lesions since LAMN lesions confined to the appendix have the same appearance as those that have spread to the peritoneum. In addition, any tumour capable of producing pseudomyxoma peritonei should be considered as adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the classification of pseudomyxoma perotonei includes low-grade and high-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma. The acellularity of the extra-appendicular mucin, based on extensive sampling, must be described in the pathological report because of its prognostic implications.",

            "text": "Mixed mucus-secreting and endocrine tumours of the appendix J.-Y. Scoazec* *Hospices Civils de Lyon, H\u00f4pital Edouard Herriot, France Vermiform appendix is one of the most frequent sites of mixed endocrine-exocrine tumours in the gastrointestinal tract. One histologic type of mixed mucus-secreting and endocrine tumor is specific for the appendix: This distinctive tumour is known as goblet cell carcinoid. The others are mixed endocrine-exocrine carcinomas raising the same problems of diagnosis and management than in the other digestive locations. Goblet cell carcinoid is a highly distinctive clinical and histological entity. In contrast to the much more common pure neuroendocrine tumours of the appendix, which are usually discovered incidentally in young patients, goblet cell carcinoids present a peak of incidence in the fifth decade and are usually symptomatic. At macroscopic examination, goblet cell carcinoids present a very particular pattern of growth, resulting in the thickening of the whole appendicular wall and in a marked reduction in the calibre of the lumen, in the absence of visible tumour mass. This aspect is due to the predominant infiltration of the deepest part of the mucosa and the submucosa by tumour cells, which result in their fibrosis and thickening. At a higher magnification, tumor cells are grouped in small nests formed by large cells, with an abundant, pale, mucus-laden cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus. These cells are strongly reactive with Alcian blue and PAS stainings. Small endocrine cells are closely intermingled with mucus-laden cells; they are usually difficult to identify by conventional stainings; they are much more easily demonstrated through the immunodetection of endocrine and neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Finally, some amphicrine cells, with a combination of exocrine and endocrine markers, may be present. The number of endocrine cells admixed with mucus-laden cells is highly variable from one case to another and even from one region to another in the same tumour. There is no minimal amount of endocrine cells required for the diagnosis of goblet cell carcinoid, which is achieved by the combination of a typical macroscopic aspect, the presence of characteristic mucus-laden cells and the demonstration of even a few endocrine cells intermingled with the predominant mucus-producing population. From the molecular point of view, goblet cell carcinoids frequently harbour loss of heterozygosity in 11q, 16q and 18q. Goblet cell carcinoids carry a high risk of peritoneal dissemination, but a low risk of distant metastasis. Their prognosis is therefore much poorer than that of typical neuroendocrine tumours of the appendix: The 5-year survival is only 18% instead of 83%, all stages included; even for patients with localized disease, it is 55% instead of 94%. Importantly, the TNM classification of goblet cell carcinoid must follow the criteria used for the staging of appendicular carcinomas, not those recently proposed for appendicular \"carcinoids\". Mixed endocrine-exocrine carcinomas of the appendix combine an exocrine component, usually corresponding to a mucus-secreting adenocarcinoma of variable differentiation and an endocrine component, which may be well or poorly differentiated. The diagnosis of mixed tumour must be made with caution, only if the endocrine component is clearly neoplastic and represents at least 30% of the whole tumour. The prognosis and treatment are those of the most aggressive component. Electron microscopy has been relatively surpassed by immunohistochemistry in pathology, especially for the diagnosis of neoplastic processes. However, its use is mandatory in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders of non-neoplasic origin. Ultrastructural examination has been proven to be useful in the following issues: (1) to understand the physiopathology of muscle disorders. Muscular dystrophies are produced by mutations in genes codifying proteins located at different subcellular levels. Ultrastructural alterations have been observed at the level where the defective protein is expressed, i.e. plasma membrane alterations in dysferlinopathies, caveolinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies, or nuclear envelope membrane defects in Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and laminopathies.",

Diagnosis of such disorders usually demands the collaboration of different specialists, methods, and skills. This is particularly important in order to avoid unnecessary probes and superfluous additional suffering related with inappropriate complementary examinations and visits. In recent years, molecular and genetic studies have facilitated a correct diagnosis during life, and improvements in therapy have permitted the application of new therapeutic tools in some cases. Morphological visualization of determinate lesions in skin, conjunctival, appendicular and, rarely, rectal mucosa, is extremely useful to support a clinical diagnosis. Lipidosis, mucopolysccharidosis, mucolipidosis, polyglucosan storage diseases and glycogenosis affect several cell types outside the central nervous system, including axons and Schwann cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle fibres, sebaceous and eccrine glands and ducts, and striate muscle. Deposits are usually too small to be visible with an optical microscope. Yet electron microscopy permits the observation of lysosomal inclusions filled with specific inclusions and deposition of abnormal material in different cells. In addition to metabolic diseases, other degenerative diseases affecting the nervous system in which the diagnosis is mainly based on key pathological markers are also subject to electron microscopy analysis during life. Nuclear neuronal inclusion body disease and infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, among others, can be diagnosed by means of appendicular (or rectal) biopsies and by examining the nerve terminals and skin and conjunctiva, respectively. This presentation will cover a range of sinonasal inflammatory diseases, focussing on those where an improved understanding of pathogenesis illuminates diagnostic histopathology. The categorisation of sinonasal fungus-related diseases is important for prognosis and treatment. Fungi are common airborne allergens and can be cultured from the nasal secretions of most healthy individuals. The diagnosis of fungal sinusitis relies on the histological recognition of fungi in sinus tissue, although the morphology of fungal hyphae is of limited value in distinguishing between fungal species. Invasive fungal sinusitis is almost always encountered in patients whose immune system is compromised and is associated with necrosis and vascular invasion by fungi. Noninvasive fungal sinusitis includes sinus fungal balls and allergic fungal sinusitis, a disease characterised by socalled allergic mucin and scanty fungal hyphae. The pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis involves a complex interplay between environmental factors and genetically influenced immune responses; eosinophils may be seen in both allergic rhinosinusitis and in patients with no evidence of allergy. The differential diagnosis of inflammatory polyps will be discussed. Pathologists should be aware of the many sinonasal diseases that may include a component of granulomatous inflammation including mycobacterial infection, cocaine-induced midline destructive disease and Wegener's granulomatosis, and of the value of ancillary investigations such as autoantibodies in their differential diagnosis. Autoimmunity to type II collagen is involved in relapsing polychondritis, a multisystem disorder in which destruction of the cartilages of the nose, ears and upper airway is prominent.",

In the woodworking industry, these tumours can be 1,000 times more common than in the general population. The average exposure time is 40 years. Histologically, the most common appearances resemble colonic adenocarcinomas. If the resemblance is striking, the rare possibility of a metastasis from the gastrointestinal tract should be considered. Similar to colonic adenocarcinomas, intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinomas stain for CK20, CDX-2, and MUC2, but they also stain for CK7. Thus, the differential diagnosis between a primary intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinoma and a metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma cannot be based on histomorphology or immunophenotype alone. Then, the recommended approach is colonoscopy. The intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinoma is a high-grade malignancy. However, the prognosis of patients with hardwood dust exposure is better than in sporadic tumours. In addition, papillary growth patterns relate to a more favourable outcome. Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinomas have not shown occupational or environmental associations. Histologically, they are papillary or glandular, with a single layer of uniform epithelial cells. Cytologically, they are bland, but malignancy is revealed by the complexity of architecture and invasive growth. Lowgrade sinonasal adenocarcinomas do not express intestinal immunophenotypic markers. Background: Computer-assisted microscopy (CAM) offers proven solutions in immunohistochemical assessments, sharing digital slides with collaborators in different places, storing and organize pathological and clinical data and research. Method: We initially developed an in-house system for the creation of digital slides and for remote diagnoses on frozen sections, suggesting that digital pathology would become the new standard in surgical pathology. In our institution, we adopt CAM using the Aperio Scanscope Xs for several applications: Results: (1) Detection and semiquantitative measurement of equivocal Her2 immunoreactivity and of Ki67 in breast cancer-our data on over 350 cases with comparison between CAM and human evaluation and with FISH analysis strongly support its feasibility and reliability in routine practice;",

In these surveys, students rate the software, the quality of the images, handling of the images, and effective use of virtual slides during the time of the practical. Satisfaction surveys demonstrate a steady improvement over the past 5 years as various student suggestions were implemented. An overwhelming majority of our students considered using digitized slides at their convenience as highly desirable. Overall, the quality of the images was rated as very good.

This examination system uses advanced HTML features, and the Web browser that can handle frames, JavaScript and cookies is required.

In the last 5 years, an overall 92% concordance rate has been achieved on practical examination based on 50 virtual slides connected with 50 multiple-choice questions per student. The online practical examination system was evaluated by the students using a questionnaire. Students were asked to reply to a survey to evaluate the usefulness of digitized slides for practical examination. All students preferred the online examination to a traditional microscope and paper-and-pencil examination and all felt that the quality of digitized slides was superior to that of classical glass slide and allowed to make a more accurate diagnosis (rating 9.5 out of 10).",

Pathologists who examine digital images captured by different scanners may subjectively assess their quality. In this work, an algorithm which may objectively compare the quality of virtual slides is proposed and implemented. In the first step, the algorithm selects some fragments of the slide captured by one scanner. Then, it finds these fragments in virtual slides acquired by scanning the same glass slide using other devices. This is done by creating overviews of the whole slides (by zooming them out) and calculating gray level cooccurrence matrices (GLCM) for each selected fragment and for the overviews of other slides using windows of adequate size. Comparing some of the Haralick features of the matrices (especially measures related to orderliness) allows estimating the positions of the fragments in other virtual slides. Detected areas, in original resolution, are used to calculate GLCM and its Haralick features again. This time, measures for evaluating the quality (like contrast) are used. Aggregation of the calculated values allows comparing the relative quality of the virtual slides. This method is tested on two sets of ten virtual slides. They were created by capturing the same set of glass slides using two different devices: robotic microscope Axioscope2 (Zeiss) equipped with AxioCam Hrc CCD camera and DeskScan (Zeiss) with standard equipment.

Immunoreactivity in other subtypes, considering our as well as published data, greatly varies. C-kit expression harbours no significant prognostic information. Results: Aspirates were cellular showing groups with stroma and single cells. Groups had a variable configuration with two major forms. Some were large, three-dimensional and puzzle-like, with little ramifications. Cells were densely packed and intimately related to metachromatic stroma. Others were of medium size with prominent prolongations consisting of an inner core of hyaline stroma surrounded by tumoral cells. Ten cases showed cylindromatous stromal structures. Seven aspirations were cystic. Stroma was homogeneous with non-fibrillary morphology. Neoplastic cells showed a variable morphology from small, basaloid to larger ones with epithelioid morphology. Moderate pleomorphism was seen in five cases. There were two misdiagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma, and two cases were considered as suspicious of malignancy. After a revision of these cases, two showed features of BCA, while in the remaining two, the suspicious of malignancy persisted because of minimal amount of stroma, predominant epithelioid cell morphology and cellular density. Conclusion: BCA shows characteristic features that allow in many cases a precise diagnosis. It may be difficult to differentiate from epithelial-rich pleomorphic adenoma, and in these cases, a diagnosis including both possibilities seems preferable. In our series, the absence of stroma was responsible for the misdiagnosis with acinic cell carcinoma in two cases.

Objective: Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity by sitagliptin has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by prolonging the actions of incretin hormones, but the real impact of low-dose sitagliptin treatment on pancreatic lesions is almost unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on the biochemical and histological (pancreatic) parameters of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, fa/fa) rats, an animal model of T2DM. Method: Diabetic (fa/fa) ZDF male rats were treated with vehicle or sitagliptin (10 mg/kg body weight per day) during 6 weeks (n=8 each). The following parameters were assessed: serum glycaemia, HbA1c, insulin and lipid profile; serum and pancreas oxidative stress (MDA) and endocrine and exocrine pancreas histology, estimating and rating inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis, vacuolization and congestion in a semiquantitative score ranging from 0 (minimal) to 3 (severe and extensive damage). Results: Sitagliptin in diabetic ZDF rats promoted beneficial effects on dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, inflammatory profile and pancreatic oxidative stress. Endocrine and exocrine pancreas presented a reduction/amelioration of fibrosis severity, inflammatory infiltrate, intra-islet vacuolation, and congestion vs the vehicle-treated diabetic rats.",

Pre-tumour progression can be made visible by studying methylation patterns, or tags, in stem cells of the crypt. Shibata et al. (2004) showed higher crypt methylation heterogeneity in normal-appearing colonic crypts of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients compared to normal crypt mucosa of non-FAP colons. This indicates enhanced stem cell survival, which may be a predictive marker of increased neoplastic outgrowth since longer lived stem cells have the potential to gain more mutations. The objective of this study was to investigate stem cell survival in juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a biomarker predictive of pre-tumour progression. Method: DNA was isolated from laser-microdissected crypts of normal colonic JPS and PJS tissue and agematched controls. DNA was bisulphite-converted and methylation tags were created by amplifying the CpG islands in the CSX gene. Sequence analysis of this pool of methylation tags allows characterisation of the heterogeneity among the different tags recovered from multiple stem cell pools. Objective: Lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor in esophageal cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) are considered to induce both lymph node metastasis and lymphatic involvement in various cancers related to lymphangiogenesis. In many types of cancer, podoplanin (D2-40) immunostaining has recently been used to detect lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), but invasion detected using D2-40 immunostaining for a predictor of nodal metastasis was controversial. We examined the relationship between VEGF-C, VEGF-D and LVI and clinicopathological features in 53 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy. Method: VEGF-C, VEGF-D and podoplanin expression was examined using immunohistochemical staining in surgically resected tissues.

Objective: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Recently, major advances in the molecular characterization of DLBCL have been made through gene expression profiling studies that provided more insight into the biological heterogeneity within DLBCL. One of the identified molecular subgroups has been termed the \"B-cell receptor (BCR)/proliferation cluster\" due to the increased expression of BCR signaling cascade components including the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which has emerged as an important therapeutic target within tumors of this subgroup. In fact, a recent clinical trial with a SYK inhibitor on uncharacterized DLBCLs has shown promising results, but only in a subset of patients. Method: We employ a novel quantitative tissue-based immunohistochemical (IHC) methodology using markers of activated BCR signaling to assess the activity of the BCR pathway in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded primary DLBCLs.",

Glomerular deposits were classified as hilar (pattern I), mesangial nodular (pattern II) and mesangiocapillary (pattern III). Chronic tubulointerstitial damage was graded from 0 to 3 (0%, 0-<25%, 25-<50% and \u226550%). Amyloid typing was performed by immunohistochemistry. Clinical information was gathered from hospital records and computer-based patient data system. Results: All patients were male. Their age ranged from 27 to 56. Full-blown nephrotic syndrome was present in six cases. Duration of BD before diagnosis of amyloidosis differed from 24 to 192 months (mean 108), and mean follow-up period was 59.5 months. Immunohistochemical typing revealed AA amyloid in all ten. Four cases showed glomerular-dominant and two cases vascular-dominant amyloid deposition; the rest were co-dominant glomerular and vascular. The frequencies of glomerular amyloid patterns were 40% for hilar, 20% for mesangial nodular and 40% for mesangiocapillary. Hilar pattern was associated with vascular-dominant amyloid deposits. Severe proteinuria correlated with the presence of mesangiocapillary pattern. Grade III chronic tubulointerstitial injury was detected in three cases. Patients were treated with steroids and/or different immunosuppressives. Among them, two progressed to endstage kidney failure, one showed remission, two were lost to follow-up, and rest had persistent proteinuria. Conclusion: Renal amyloidosis in BD has a diverse pathology in terms of preferential location of amyloid deposition and its intensity. Patients follow variable clinical courses accordingly. Objective: KRAS is an oncogene that is commonly mutated in various malignancies. Mutations in KRAS are associated with lack of response to anti-EGFR treatment in colon and lung carcinomas, and patients must undergo genetic testing to be eligible for treatment. Several genetic tests for KRAS mutation analysis exist, but most are either too expensive or lack the sensitivity to identify a mutation if the percentage of tumor cells in the sample is small. The purpose of the present study was to develop a novel KRAS mutation detection method that is both cost-effective and sensitive. Method: We designed a locked nucleic acid (LNA)containing probe that inhibits the amplification of wildtype KRAS, thereby giving an advantage to mutated KRAS in PCR reaction (PCR clamping). The sensitivity of this method was evaluated using serial dilutions of plasmids containing wild-type and mutated KRAS fragments. The method was further evaluated on 40 archived tissue samples of colon carcinoma and compared to direct sequencing and high resolution melting (HRM) methods.",

In order to determine specific prognostics factors, we established histopathologic, immunohistochemical and morphometric profiles of these types of carcinoma. Method: In our study, we investigate 120 cases diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma in which we established microscopic characterization, immunohistochemical profiles (expression of proliferation markers, steroid receptors and Her2) and computer-assisted morphometric profiles by determining the mean values for nuclear area, cellular area and N/C ratio with Lucia Net Software. The distribution of markers and histological grade among types of carcinoma was statistically analyzed using the \u03c7 2 test. Results: The histological type of invasive carcinoma was: 83.5% ductal carcinoma, 9% mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma, and 7.5% lobular carcinoma. According to histological differentiation, 15% was G1, 54% was G2 and 31% was G3. Immunohistochemical expression of ER was positive in 93% and negative in 15%, for PR was positive in 85% and negative in 15% and the expression of Her2 was positive in 68% and negative in 32%. Ki67 was intensely positive in 47%, moderately positive in 43% and intensely positive in 16%. P53 was positive in 95% cases and negative in 5% of cases. Morphometric analysis revealed that mean nuclear area and N/C ratio increase are concordant with grading, but mean cytoplasmatic area has no characteristic variation. Conclusion: The expressions of proliferation markers correlate with carcinoma grading. Poorly differentiated and triple-negative carcinoma (ER, PR and HER2) with intense expression of proliferation markers and increase mean nuclear area have negative prognosis. Objective: Mapping tumour cell protein networks in routinely processed clinical samples, like formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, will be critical for realizing the promise of personalized molecular therapy as only a subset of patients will respond. Therefore, techniques being able to detect the entire spectrum of deregulated pathways in tumors before, during, and after treatment are required to assess success or failure of targeted therapies. The aim of our study was to monitor protein networks in FFPE breast cancer tissues with special emphasis on epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)mediated signaling pathways to identify and validate new disease markers in order to predict response to current treatments.",

Results: We found HER3 (r's=0.581), the EGFR (r's= 0.556) and the receptor of uPA (r's=0.585) correlating with HER2. However, we could not demonstrate any significant correlation between HER2 expression and clinicopathological parameters. Conclusion: Our results uncover molecules linked to HER2 signaling and cancer progression. Thus, these finings provide possible new targets for cancer treatment and may assist in optimal patient selection. Objective: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has a fundamental role in signal transduction, and its alterations are of pathogenetic role in human cancer, including breast carcinomas (BC). Several drugs may interfere with the altered activation of this pathway, including the recently developed mTOR inhibitors.

The microanatomical distribution of each antibody in the lymph node, different cell type expression, adjacent mesenchymal structure positivity and neoplastic cell positivity were validated and reported as negative and positive (with the cutoff +, ++, +++ for the neoplastic cells). Results: No markedly or obvious staining was obtained for lymphatic vessels. Positive staining of metastatic neoplastic cells, lymphoid cells of germinal centres and node pericapsular fatty tissue has been observed. Immunostained neoplastic cells revealed a predominant subcapsular and perihilar location. Conclusion: The applied primary antibodies were unsuccessfully used as lymphatic markers. The spread of neoplastic cells expressing these markers may have acquired particular characteristics to develop lymphatic dissemination until reaching lymph nodes. Lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer continues without demonstration in lymph nodes, while the fatty tissue can be implicated in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). This thesis turned up by the proximity of the positive neoplastic cells to the mesenchymal components of surrounding lymph node tissue as adipocytes were immunoreactive. Objective: There is a significant percentage of patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 receptor overexpression that do not respond to therapy directed with trastuzumab. In these patients, overall survival and diseasefree time are significantly shorter. Several mechanisms that explain the resistance to therapy with trastuzumab have been reported. This paper aims to address the study of alterations in one of the signalling pathways of HER2related trastuzumab in response to breast cancer in order to incorporate into the clinical routine of other predictive biomarkers of response to therapy.

Method: Between January 2003 and March 2010, 850 fine needle aspirates in breast lesions were performed in our Institution. The aspiration was done using a 21-gauge needle. Conventional and ThinPrep smears were prepared. Estrogen and progesterone receptor studies were part of the routine workup of a breast cancer as well as other markers (c-erb-B2, p53, E-cadherin, GCDFP-15). Results: One hundred and fifty-eight of the cases were carcinomas. Ten of these patients were under 40 years old (mean age 38.2). In eight of these patients, cytology correctly diagnosed seven ductal and a tubular carcinoma. In two cases, the cytologic diagnosis was suggestive of carcinoma, and the excisional biopsy revealed a lobular and a mixed carcinoma.",

Detailed structured questionnaire-based enquiries to lead breast pathologists were made. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analysed in relation to the standards. All aspects of the pathology service were examined, including macroscopic data (number of SNs/case, dimensions, sampling and slicing details) and microscopic data (performance of levels and immunohistochemistry, TNM staging and SNOMED coding). Results: One site was unaware of radioactivity guidelines while another was unaware of national guidelines. Twenty-eight percent to 84% of SNs were bisected longitudinally and levels were sparingly used, except at 1 site. TNM staging and SNOMED coding in the reports were variable. Conclusion: This audit demonstrates a substantial variation in SN handling and reporting practice across Kent. Since the quality of the pathology service in breast cancer is of paramount importance, it is imperative that a standardised approach is achieved in the handling and reporting of SNs. To achieve this, recommendations have been made and agreed upon, the success of which will be measured in a reaudit next year. Objective: Background: The study analyzes the positivism of the p53 protein and the oncoprotein c-erbB2 and their implication in the appreciation of prognostic invasive mammary carcinomas. Method: In 60 invasive mammary carcinomas, we have realized the immunohistochemical determination of the p53 protein with the avidine-biotine complex method (ABC) using the DAKO p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:500). In 60 invasive mammary carcinomas, we have determined immunohistochemically the c-erbB2 oncoprotein with the DAKO rabbit polyclonal antibody, human anti-protein c-erbB2 (dilution 1:200).

Conclusion: The presently best-known mutant gene in invasive mammary cancer seems to be the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We did not remark any connection between the p53 protein expression and the tumors' sizes, patients' ages, the clinical stage of the disease and the overexpression of c-erbB2.

Objective: There are only a few entities in the breast which show a chondroid differentiation. The differential diagnosis varies from the harmless choristoma to the also benign pleomorphic adenoma, to the syringioma and phylloides tumour with uncertain dignity to the high malignant metaplastic carcinoma. The differentiation between these different neoplasias is essential for the patient because of the following therapeutical procedures and the prognostic outcome. The final diagnosis in a mammary punch biopsy may be difficult or impossible because of the small specimen and the heterogeneity of the tumour.

Objective: Melanoma is a malignant tumor of the neural crest-derived cells named melanocytes. It is an aggressive neoplasm due to its high rate of proliferation and invasion. Disruptions in the cellular signaling pathways promote melanoma development and progression. Aberrant Notch activation has been related to a variety of human neoplasms. We investigate the potential involvement of Notch signaling in melanoma development and progression. For this purpose, we analyzed the expression of three essential components of the Notch pathway: Notch1, ADAM10 and ADAM17/TACE. Method: Melanoma samples from seven patients were tested and compared with normal skin samples. Immunofluorescent staining was performed on 5-\u03bcm-thick cryosections. Primary antibodies were applied and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. To detect the primary immune reaction, we used FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. The samples were examined using light and UV microscopy. For the Western blot technique, the Western-Breeze kit was used.",

Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of these proteins in cytoplasmatic and nuclear lysates. Conclusion: We observed that the Notch signaling pathway is activated in melanoma cells. Critical members of the Notch pathway are potential therapy targets.

Conclusion: Our frequency detection is not related with the size of the tumor, depth, ulceration or mitotic activity. Most lesions present expression of bcl-2 in 90% of the cases and were associated with good prognosis; p-53 expression is between 3% and 62% and was associated with poor survival. Although ki-67 expression is between 6% and 71%, it is not related with the prognosis. It was suggested that p-53 and bcl-2 expression could be useful in predicting the biological behaviour. Neoplastic embolisations were identified in two cases of the study group. Objective: Desmoplastic melanomas represent an extreme degree of fibroblastic or myofibroblastic metaplasia accompanied by abundant collagen synthesis. Those tumors are in general associated with high incidence of recurrence and metastasis and a poor prognosis. Method: A patient P.C., male, 74 years old, presents at the clinical exam a right calcaneo-plantar ulcero-proliferative and multinodular lesion (2/1, 5/0, 5 cm), with a few months' course; there is local discomfort and functional impairment. Clinical diagnostic was that of Kaposi sarcoma and for the histopathology was sent a cutaneous specimen of 12/5/3 cm that contains the lesion. The specimens were examined using basic histological techniques and immunohistochemistry with antibodies anti-S100 protein, anti-CD34, anti-desmin, Melan A, HMB-45 and pan CK. Results: Microscopically, it was identified as tumoral proliferation with spindle cells, uniform nucleus, some of them hyperchromatic, prominent nucleoli, some tumoral cells with brown melanic pigment and a rich mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical expression was intensely positive for S100 protein and Melan A and negative for HMB 45, desmin, CD34, pan CK, associated with focal lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate. Tumoral proliferation includes adnexal structures of the skin and is ulcerated. The histopathological aspects lead to a desmoplastic melanoma. In spite of the large excision margins sidewise and in the depth, the tumor has reappeared locally after 4 months from excision and treatment, with inguinal ipsilateral metastasis. Conclusion: The presented facts suggest a more close attention to the clinical and histopathological differential diagnosis of the tumoral cutaneous lesions in the lower limb extremities. This could influence the surgical therapeutic act. was 42/nmc. Histological exam of skin biopsies revealed in dermis a significant proliferation of irregular, small vascular channels, covered by a single layer of atypical endothelial cells. These channels were predominately arranged around preexistent mature vessels and adnexal structures. They were placed parallel to the epidermis and were marked by CD34 antibody. With this antibody, we observed that majority of these vessels were intermediary vessels whose proliferation could be suppressed by anti-angiogenic therapy. Based on clinical, histological and immunohistochemical aspects, diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma in early stage was made. Chemotherapy was initiated (HAART scheme) for 6 months. After this treatment, skin plaques have disappeared and serum level of CD4 increased at 146/nmc. Conclusion: It is very important to recognize early phase of Kaposi's sarcoma and to initiate the treatment in order to improve prognosis of this lesion in HIV-infected and also immusdepressed patients.",

            "text": "The Objective: Skin cancers are one of the most common human malignancies. Although the prognosis of these patients has improved in the last decades, there is still a need for novel treatment modalities and prevention from recurrence after the treatment of skin tumors. P53 is a tumor-inhibiting gene which is believed to be defective in many malignant situations. Ki67 is a non-histonic protein which mainly interferes with the proliferation and has many controlling effects during the cell cycle. This study aimed at evaluating P53 and Ki-67 expression in skin epithelial tumors by immunohistochemical method. Method: In a descriptive setting, 50 biopsy samples-30 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), ten squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), eight keratoacanthomas (KAs) and two tricoepitheliomas (TEs)-were immunohistochemically evaluated for P53 and Ki67 expression during a 14-month period. The incidence and expression rate of these two variables were separately reported in each group of samples. Objective: The coexistence of anti-neutrophil crescentic glomerulonephritis with membranous glomerulopathy is very rare. Little is known about the clinical course, treatment and outcome of patients with concurrent coexistence of these nephropathies. Method: We present the case of a 58-year-old man with rapidly progressive renal failure, anti-neutrophil perinuclear antibodies positivity, pulmonary infiltrates and vasculitis. Results: The patient was admitted to the pulmonary department due to febrile state, weakness and weight loss. Physical examination revealed fine crackles over the left lung, leg edema, and vascular skin lesions on inferior extremities. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and hematuria with many RBC casts, and in a 24-h urine collection, the proteinuria of 2 g was observed. Serologic workup was positive for p-ANCA, negative for c-ANCA, ANA, and anti-GBM antibodies and showed normal levels of C3 and C4. HCV, HBV and HIV infection were excluded. In lab tests, the rapid increase of serum creatinine from 1.3 to 5.17 mg/dl over 2 weeks was observed. Chest CT revealed pulmonary infiltrates of left lung upper lobe. The patient underwent a kidney biopsy which showed necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and membranous glomerulopathy. In light microscopy examination, glomeruli with necrotic lesions and cellular crescents were seen. Electron microscopy revealed epimembranous and intramembranous deposits. The patient was treated with steroids; cyclophosphamide and seven plasmapheresis were performed with improvement in renal function. On 1-year follow-up, his proteinuria had decreased to 300 mg/day and his creatinine had stabilized at 1.6 with eGFR of 56 ml/min. Objective: In the last years, the study of predictive and prognostic markers of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) has been a continuous challenge. It is well known that the imbalance between AKT and PTEN expressions plays an important role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor cell invasiveness in various solid malignancies. The aim of our study was to analyze the AKT and PTEN expressions in primitive non-small cell lung carcinomas and, also, in their metastases. Method: We have examined AKT and PTEN immunohistochemical expressions in 64 primitive non-small cell lung carcinomas with different stages and in ten metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinomas: brain, adrenal glands and lungs. Results: AKT expression was higher in metastatic than in primitive non-small cell lung carcinomas, while PTEN was over-expressed in 98% of all tumors. There were no obvious associations between tumor stage and AKT/PTEN expression. There were no correlations between PTEN over-expression and AKT expression. Conclusion: AKT activation may play an important role in tumor cell invasiveness in non-small cell lung carcinomas, but PTEN suppressor gene may not be involved in AKT activation. Objective: The role of miRNAs in cancer is a rapidly emerging area of investigation. Expression profiling has identified miRNA signatures in cancers that associate with the diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis, and response to treatment. MiRNAs are ideal biomarkers in FFPE tissue because unlike mRNA, miRNA integrity is affected very little by formalin fixation. Previous studies have shown that miR-21 overexpression correlated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. In this study, we investigated the expression of mir-21 in primary carcinoma and metastasis and near non-tumor parenchyma. Method: FFPE samples from surgical specimens and biopsies of seven pulmonary adenocarcinomas and five squamous cell carcinomas and respective metastasis together with normal lung tissue (alveolar and bronchial) from the same case; it was imperative to separate these well-characterized areas by lasercapture microdissection (LCM) prior to RNA analysis. Results: The expression level of miR-21 by qRT-PCR was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (p=0.005). The overexpression in the metastasis samples compared to adjacent normal tissue was almost statistically significant (p=0.051). Conclusion: miR-21 was overexpressed in tumor tissues relative to adjacent non-tumor tissues. We found an increase in miR-21 expression in primary carcinoma and metastasis in pulmonary adenocarcinomas when compared with miR-21 lower expression in squamous cell carcinoma. Despite the small sample studied, further investigation may indicate the therapeutic and prognostic relevance of this determination as previous studies suggest that miR-21 acts as an oncogene and has a role in tumorigenesis through the regulation of tumour suppressor genes. Objective: Routine diagnosis and prognostic methods may also be useful to add data to clinical information in advanced primary carcinomas if conveniently explored. The evaluation of the potential of 1 H NMR spectroscopy for providing biochemical information of the different histological types and for discriminating between tumour and pulmonary parenchyma as well as biochemical information about different histological types was tried as a preliminary approach. Method: Small frozen samples of 24 pulmonary tumours were collected together with macroscopically normal parenchyma from surgical specimens before histological classification and mirror tissue was FFPE. Paired cases were directly analysed by high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) 1 H NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz). The spectral profiles obtained were subjected to multivariate analysis: principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with the predictive ability of the statistical models. Results: Tumor and control tissues were clearly discriminated in the PLS-DA model with high level of sensitivity (95% of tumor samples correctly classified) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The metabolites giving rise to this separation were mainly lactate, GPC, PC, taurine, glutathione and UDP/UTP (elevated in tumors), and glucose, phosphoethanolamine (PE), acetate, lysine, methionine, glycine, myo-and scyllo-inositol (reduced in tumors compared to control tissues). Furthermore, PLS-DA allowed carcinoids to be discriminated from adenocarcinomas and epidermoid carcinomas.",

Objective: The RNA binding protein HuR can stabilize and/or regulate the translation of target mRNAs affecting cellular responses. The expression of HuR is increased in several cancers, and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was found to be closely related to poor outcomes. Method: We analyzed, by quantitative immunohistochemistry, the expression of HuR in 54 lung adenocarcinoma of mixed histologic type from stage I and II patients. Moreover, we evaluated the level of HuR expressed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of tumor cells (t-HuR) and evaluated the impact of nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (N/C) on clinical outcome. Results: Both t-HuR and N/C were not associated with age, tumor diameter and histopathological grading, whereas high t-HuR and low N/C were associated with lymph node involvement at presentation. Cox's regression analysis, using either t-HuR or N/C as continuous covariates, showed that high t-HuR and low N/C were associated with the risk of death and metastasis. The plots of the estimates, at 5-year follow-up, of metastasis-free and overall surviving as a function of t-HuR and N/C levels, showed that the increase of t-HuR and the decrease of N/C were associated with an increase of risk. In the multivariate analysis, both t-HuR and N/C retained an independent prognostic significance relative to metastasis-free and overall survival. Conclusion: In conclusion, these data indicate that the over-expression of HuR in lung adenocarcinoma cells is an independent prognostic marker of a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, the cytoplasmic localization of HuR expression is more relevant than the nuclear one for the tumor cell behavior. Objective: The EML4-ALK fusion gene has been detected in 5-7% of non-small cell lung cancers. We evaluated the incidence, prognosis and the characteristics of ALKrearranged non-small cell lung cancers and the optimal diagnostic modality to detect ALK rearrangements in routine clinical practice. Method: Seven hundred seventy-nine surgical specimens of non-small cell lung cancer from two institutions were analyzed. To identify ALK rearrangements, immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) examination were performed and compared. The clinicopathologic characteristics of tumors with and without ALK rearrangements were analyzed. EGFR and KRAS mutations were determined by DNA sequencing.",

Patients in the EML4-ALK fusion gene in adenocarcinoma had no effect on progression-free survival and overall survival. Immunohistochemical results were correlated with FISH results. Conclusion: The patients most likely to harbor EML4-ALK are never smokers with adenocarcinoma. But EML4-ALK was not an independent prognostic factor.

Results: LFs, almost absent in normal lungs from donors, were frequent in subjects with severe emphysema both with and without AATD. LF total number was increased in AATD patients as compared to AATN, and this was mainly due to a higher number of parenchymal LFs (median, range: 6, 2-12 vs 2, 0-6 LFs/cm 2 , p=0.0002). Perivascular and bronchiolar LFs were numerically increased in patients with AATD (5, 0-24 vs 3, 0-8 LFs/cm 2 ; 33, 20-100 vs 20, 0-60%), but did not reach the levels of statistical significance.",

These results extend our knowledge of disease pathogenesis, suggesting that lymphocyte activation is a crucial event even in AATD-related emphysema, and the excessive lung damage observed in these patients may trigger the persistence of the immune response, possibly with autoimmune mechanisms. Objective: (LYG) is a rare angiocentric lymphoproliferative process predominantly affecting the lung. The diagnosis of this condition is often difficult as the physical signs, history, chest X-ray, and routine laboratory investigations are usually nonspecific. Nevertheless, it is important to establish a tissue diagnosis as this lymphoproliferative disorder can be refractory to treatment and even progress to overt lymphoma. Method: One case of pulmonary LYG in a 52-year-old Nigerian man of Ibo extraction treated in our centre in 2001 and followed up for a year is presented. The difficulty in making diagnosis is highlighted and treatment modality discussed. Results: Our patient received two courses of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone before defaulting. There was evidence of some remission, even though incomplete, following the first course of chemotherapy (Fig. 4) .

VEGR1 marked the preserved alveolar cells and VEGFR2 marked alveolar macrophages. HM were negative for both receptors. In late ARDS, down-regulation was more prominent for all antibodies.

Within the frame of the project, which is mainly concerned with cytokine expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we optimized the flow cytometric (FC) examination of TNF\u03b1 expression in AMs. The aim was to determine spontaneous TNF\u03b1 production, the production during the culture and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, we focused on antibody selection since AMs displayed high level of autofluorescence. Method: We examined BALF obtained from control patients. TNF\u03b1 production was assessed immediately after BALF delivery, after 5-h stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (monensin, protein transport inhibitor was added after 2 h of incubation) and also after incubation with monensin only. Simultaneously, various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide were tested (0.5, 1 and 2 \u03bcg/ml). FC detection of AMs was simplified using multiparametric analysis, a combination of optical parameters along with the expression of surface markers CD14 and CD45. Results: Concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml of LPS was found to be optimal for AMs activation, although all tested concentrations are suitable. The high background autofluorescence of AMs can be efficiently reduced by the use of antibody conjugated with long-wave emitting fluorochrome, e.g. APC. Objective: The aim of the present study was to contribute to the understanding of the importance of evaluating bone marrow biopsy (BMB) by computer-assisted digital image analysis (CIA). Moreover, the intention was to investigate the frequency of marrow fibrosis in multiple myeloma (MM) and to correlate it with plasma cell infiltration during the follow-up of patients. Method: Bone marrow biopsy from 31 patients diagnosed with MM were analyzed at the time of diagnosis and reevaluated after the completion of the therapy. The percentage of plasma cells was estimated on immunohistochemically stained paraffin sections with anti-CD138 and Ig light chains by Alphelys Spot Browser 2 integrated system.

Objective: Lymphoma is the commonest haematological malignancy in the developed world. We undertook an audit of all laboratory reports from the Pathology Department of Beaumont Hospital that confirmed or suspected a diagnosis of lymphoma over an 11-year period, assessing the following: incidence of lymphoma by age at presentation and gender, site of presentation, type of lymphoma diagnosed, number of cases utilising immunohistochemistry, number of cases where bone marrow staging was performed and the results. Method: Six hundred forty-seven cases were retrieved from the laboratory database where the histology report provided a definitive diagnosis of lymphoma or strongly suspicious for lymphoma. Seventy-seven were diagnosed as Hodgkin's lymphoma and 519 diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with 51 cases strongly suspicious for lymphoma. Results: The study showed an average age of 58.08 years at presentation, with incidence of lymphoma increasing with age and peaking at an age range of 61-70 years, reducing thereafter. The highest incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in the age ranges 16-20 and 31-35 years. Incidence of lymphoma was similar in both genders. B cell lymphoma had the highest incidence, followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma. Three hundred thirty-one cases had a nodal site of presentation, 240 were extranodal, with the remaining from uncertain site (site labelled, for example, mediastinal mass). Brain was the most common extranodal site with 65 cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 92% of cases. Six percent of cases had bone marrow involvement. Conclusion: The incidence of lymphoma for 11 years in Beaumont hospital is mostly consistent with the epidemiology established by the WHO. Objective: MPNs consist of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Though a number of clinical and diagnostic factors have been determined, the current classification in MPNs is still not satisfactory. All MPNs are characterized by JAK2 tyrosine kinase (V617F) mutation related to the deregulation of intracellular signalling pathways, e.g. RAS-ERK and PI3K-AKT, while BCL2 negatively regulates the PI3K-AKT pathway. The aim of our study was to attempt to indentify the presence and distribution of ERK2 and BCL2 expression as factors which might distinguish each MPN. Method: Expressions of ERK2 and BCL2 were investigated (immunohistochemistry with EnVision and DAB) on trephine samples in PV, ET and PMF patients. Anti-ERK2 antibodies were directed to the epitope corresponding to a site near the C-terminal of these molecules. BCL2 antibodies bind an epitope located between amino acids 1-205 of human BCL2. Finally, sections were studied under light microscope and evaluated using a semiquantitative method.",

There was a widespread occurrence of anti-ERK2 in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. Observed differences concern the levels of expression of this antigen in the nucleus. Objective: There is a wide overlap of symptoms and signs among gastrointestinal (GI) graft versus host disease (GVHD) and other GI diseases (infections, drug toxicity, etc.). The diagnosis is based upon histologic and endoscopic findings. Accurate diagnosis is important as it determines a specific treatment and contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patients. Persistence of GI symptoms despite initial treatment is frequent, and ulterior histologic evaluation may be helpful to address therapy. Method: We performed a retrospective study of 29 patients with persistent diarrhea despite treatment based on the first biopsy diagnosis in order to determine the diagnostic value of serial GI biopsy evaluation in SCT patients. Simultaneous microbiologic analyses of stools and CMV antigenemia monitoring were performed. Results: Of the 29 first rectosigmoid biopsies, 18 (62%) were diagnosed as GVHD, two (7%) as GVHD with CMV infection, four (14%) as non-CMV infection, and five (17%) as normal or unspecific. Second GI biopsies were diagnostic of active GVHD in six (17%) cases, GVHD with CMV infection in four (14%), regenerative changes post-GVHD in eight (28%), CMV infection in three (10%), and normal or unspecific in eight (28%). In 21 out of 29 (72%) patients, the histologic findings of the second biopsy were different compared to the first biopsy, leading to a therapy change in 20 (69%) patients. Conclusion: Our results showed a reliable diagnostic value for serial GI histologic evaluation that could impact on the therapeutic decision in patients with persistent diarrhea after allo-SCT.",

As controls, 44 type B2 and B3 thymomas and 23 thymic carcinomas arranged on a multi-tissue histoarray were analyzed. Results: With regard to cytokeratin expression, three B2 thymomas were completely negative for panCK, CK19, CK5/ 6 and Cam5.2. With regard to the other epithelial markers, seven of seven cases showed a strong nuclear expression of p63 and strong membranous staining for E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Analysis of control cases on a multi-tissue array showed the expression of panCK, CK19, CK5/6, Cam5.2 and CK5/14 in 100%, 88%, 80%, 60% and 91%, respectively.

With use of a receptorspecific monoclonal blocking antibody against the Notch1 receptor (N1-AB), we determined the exact effects of Notch1 receptor inhibition on different PDAC cell lines. Method: After confirming active Notch1 signaling, N1-AB activity and specificity were tested with immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR.

No effect on growth rate was observed upon treatment with N1-AB, which conflicts with the general statement that Notch1 receptor inhibition results in a decline in growth rate. Notch1 should still be looked upon as a potential treatment target, but further determination of the different components of the Notch pathway and their role in tumorigenesis seems advisable. Objective: Due to adverse side effects, efforts are made to reduce the time of daily lateral electrical surface stimulation (LESS) therapy in the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents. Method: Studies were carried out on ten male rabbits, New Zealand purebred, aged 3.5 months, with b.m. of 2,000-2,200 g. Animals were divided into two groups (n=5): (1) short-term LESS was applied for 2 h daily during 3 months and (2) control group without LESS, but with other experimental parameters as in group 1. Stimulation was performed with SCOL-2 (ELMECH). Clinical, macroscopic and microscopic observations were performed. Results: Similar growth of b.m. was observed in the rabbits from both groups during the first 2 months of the experiment.

Recurrent basal cell carcinomas were larger, with longer duration of lesion. Basosquamous basal cell carcinomas were more likely to have prior recurrences, larger lesion size, and the highest rate of orbital invasion. Perineural invasion was most frequent in morpheaform and basosquamous subtypes. Peritumorous inflammation differed between subtypes and was highest in the superficial subtype. The recurrence rate was 6.2%. Conclusion: The outcomes were worse than previously reported due to the delay in treatment. The prognostic factors associated with secondary orbital invasion are previous recurrences, aggressive histologic subtypes, longer duration of lesion and larger lesion size.",

Conclusion: Quantitative morphological assessment may be useful in quantifying the degree of mucosal lost in small intestine stained with hematoxylin and eosin from pigs submitted to acute severe bleeding. Results: Case1: The tumor in the thoracic aorta was found at autopsy. Histologically, the tumor consisted of isolated atypical cells, suggesting sarcoma. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for CD31. The same atypical cells were seen in the intrarenal arteries as emboli accompanied with vasculitides. Case2: Autopsy revealed lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) involving kidneys. And more, amyloid deposition in the lungs and MPO-ANCAassociated crescentic glomerulonephritis, i.e. MPA, were noted. Conclusion: Aortic angiosarcoma is an extremely rare lesion, and it is known that the tumor often causes distal emboli and presents vascilitis syndrome. The second case was diagnosed as LPL, MPA and amyloidosis. MPA is known to occur in some patients with malignancy. It has been reported that some malignancies produce vasculitidesinducing factors. In our cases, such factors produced by malignant cells might induce vasculitides.",

Compared to BME, PBFE were significantly more common in patients with osteomyelitis [2 of 8 (25%) versus 0 of 29, p<0.05). In contrast, BME was more common in patients with costal fractures (16 of 29 versus 1 of 8, p<0.05), but no patient showed both types of embolism. In addition, PBEF and BME were observed in patients with bone metastasis and orthopaedic devices. The highest density (30.5 particles per square centimeter) was observed in a patient who died immediately following femoral medullary nailing, presenting with the clinical picture of pulmonary thromboembolism. Conclusion: In the autopsy cohort analyzed, an incidence of 5\u2030 for PBFE was considerably higher as previously reported and PBEF showed a strong correlation with osteomyelitis, and the application of orthopaedic devices and extensive PBFE may lead to death. BME are correlated with rib fracture, but no association between PBFE and BME was observed, suggesting a different pathogenetic mechanism. (7)). Results: We performed correct oncological excision in 84% of the cases; ten patients with BCC needed re-excision. In the same surgical stage, we reconstructed the defect using local flaps for 50 patients (79.3%), local flaps and skin grafts for six patients and skin grafts only in the seven cases with MM. The main techniques used were: frontal or temporal flaps for the orbital /nasal regions, naso-genian or fan flaps for the lips and cervico-facial flaps for the cheek. When necessary, full-thickness skin grafts taken from preor retroauricular donor zones were performed (13 cases). After surgery, all the patients were examined by the oncologist; only 15 patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma accepted the excision of the local regional lymph nodes. Conclusion: Correct tumoural excision in the face is difficult to perform. The skin graft is the best reconstruction technique from the oncological point of view, but to respect the aesthetic and functional rules, we have to perform flaps.",

Results: The prototypes were \"curiosities of nature\" collections with one of the first founded by Aldrovandi in Bologna (sixteenth century). The next famous and focused on the human body were the collections of F. Ruysch in the Netherlands (seventeenth century). He was performing autopsies in public and after that presented preserved parts or whole bodies and osteological preparation sets as artistic dioramas in a special exhibition house. His collection, sold to Peter the Great, created the foundations for Kunstkamera in Sankt Petersburg. In the eighteenth century, teachers in surgical and anatomical schools (beginning of anatomopathology) realized the educational power of such collections. Museums like the one by H. Fragonard in Paris, France and Hunterian in Glasgow were established. The next big collection-Narrenturm in Vienna-had many exhibits obtained from Algemeine Krankenhaus. The first typical anatomopathological museum was created by R. Virchow in Berlin (nineteenth century). Virchow's motto was \"no day without a preparation\". In Polish universities, L. Bierkowski (Cracow) and A. Bielkiewicz (Vilnius) founded such museums. That time in all Europe, anatomopathological collections became popular, gathering preparations: osteological, wet (alcohol, formaldehyde, other preservatives), dry and mummified. The fall of phenomenon started in the second half of the twentieth century. Nowadays, we face the era of digitalisation of images but, on the other hand, collections of \"plastinated bodies\". The ethical and legal aspects become more important. Results: Macroscopic examination revealed the absence of traumatic lesions and the presence of cardiomegaly, threeelectrode pacemaker inserted in the right ventricle, anomalously coloured myocardium, lung oedema and congestion, chronic stasis liver and cerebral oedema. Microscopic examination showed lesions of severe cellular acute cardiac rejection (grade 3R) in a heart with graft vascular disease. Conclusion: The medico-legal autopsy allowed the confirmation of a death of natural cause (1); the exclusion of infection and neoplasia-frequent and severe causes of morbidity in the heart-transplanted population (2); the documentation of graft vascular disease, which is related to the time span after transplantation (3); and the diagnosis and characterization of the acute rejection (4) as adequate cause of unexpected death, without prodromic signs and symptoms. Finally, it allowed the correlation of acute rejection and the suspension of immunosuppressive therapy by the patient-data obtained through the family (5). All these conclusions may provide information about death causes of the heart-transplanted population dying outside the hospital, which will complement that of transplanted inpatient deaths. Objective: Sudden death is a possible major complication of congenital cardiac malformations. Method: The authors report the case of a 44-year-old male that unexpectedly died at work while performing a minor effort task.

Objective: The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by dose-related cardiotoxicity. One-electron redox cycling of the quinone moiety has long been known to form reactive oxygen species. Tirapazamine is a relatively new cytostatic compound most efficient in areas of hypoxia, however under aerobic conditions causing significant oxidative stress. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess morphological changes in the myocardium of rats treated with doxorubicin and tirapazamine and evaluate changes in plasma level of a cardiac damage marker, cTnI. Method: Rats were weakly treated i.p. with 1.8 mg/kg b.w. of doxorubicin and 5 or 10 mg/kg b. w. of tirapazamine for 6 weeks. Control group was given saline. Samples of myocardium and plasma were taken a week after last dose. Tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, van Gieson method and Selye method and examined under light microscope. Results: Myocardium of rats receiving a combination of doxorubicin and lower dose of tirapazamine exhibited similar changes as rats administered with doxorubicin solely. Animals treated with doxorubicin and higher dose of tirapazamine displayed vacuolization of sarcoplasm, wavy cardiomyocytes and fuxin-positive areas in Selye method as well as signs of minor interstitial fibrosis. All described alterations in this group were accompanied by significantly higher levels of plasma cTnI. Conclusion: Both drugs caused cardiac changes in rats, including necrosis, mononuclear infiltrations and minor fibrosis. Combination of doxorubicin and higher dose (10 mg/kg) of tirapazamine seems to have a synergic effect on changes in myocardium. Objective: Disturbed glucose metabolism, particularly in diabetes, is an important factor leading to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). The amount of AGE and its distribution in the cardiocytes of a diabetic myocardium and in cardiopathies is not yet well understood. Studies were performed to assess AGE deposits in cardiocytes in chronic heart failure. Method: The diabetic groups consisted of 14 autopsy cases with diagnosed diabetes, 14 hearts explanted during transplantation with ischemic cardiopathy and diabetes, and eight hearts from dilated cardiopathy with diabetes. The two non-diabetic groups comprised hearts explanted from non-diabetic subjects: 67 with ischemic cardiopathy and 47 with dilated cardiopathy. The control group consisted of samples from 20 healthy heart donors. Immunohistochemical localization of AGE was applied, and a semiquantitative scale was used.",

Negative staining seemed to be characteristic of control group and nondiabetics, whereas granular and diffuse staining pattern (mixed pattern) was most frequent in diabetic groups. The semiquantitative results supported an increased AGE accumulation in cases with cardiomyopathy and in diabetes. AGE staining showed no significant correlation with patient age, BMI or diabetes duration. Objective: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare malignant serosa-related tumor involving mostly the pelvic and abdominal cavities, but very uncommon in the paratesticular region. DSRCT affects young adults, mainly men, and is classically associated with a bad prognosis. Method: We report the case of a 25-year-old man admitted to the hospital for a progressive enlargement of the right hemiscrotum with a 5-month history. A preoperative diagnosis of testicular tuberculosis was set and consecutively a right high orchiectomy was performed. At macroscopy, the testicular parenchyma showed no abnormal areas, but the tunica vaginalis was irregular and diffusely enlarged by a whitish to gray firm tumoral mass. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of nests of small, round to spindle cells, with scant cytoplasm, surrounded by a mild desmoplastic stroma. An immunohistochemical study was performed for the differential diagnosis. Results: Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE3 and NSE and negative for LCA, chromogranin, synaptophysin and CD56 antibodies. Positivity and a very peculiar staining aspect were noticed with Desmin antibody: perinuclear and dot-like, suggesting a DSRCT. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was accomplished, demonstrating EWSR1 rearrangement, which in this immunophenotypical context pleads a diagnosis of DSRCT. Conclusion: The awareness and the knowledge of DSRCT in the paratesticular area are needed for a correct diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of this tumor with other malignancies involving this region is mandatory as it has a different clinical management.",

In G-GIST, the most common detected mutations were exon 11 KIT (57%) and exon 18 PDGFRA, but in NG-GIST exon 11 and 9 KIT. Prognosis of G-GISTs was significantly better as compared to NG-GIST: 5-year DFS rate, 69% vs. 43%. In NG-GISTs, the following factors showed negative impact on DFS based on analysis: mitotic index >5/50 HPF, primary tumor size >5 cm, pathological subtype: spindle. The high prognostic significance of AJCC staging system classification in G-and NG-GISTs was confirmed also in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Reliability of AJCC risk classification after resection of primary GIST was confirmed. Patients with primary GIST, originating from the stomach, have better prognosis as compared with GISTs located in other places. In both groups, primary tumor size and mitotic activity are still the most important prognostic factors. Objective: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly aggressive sarcomas which may be encountered either sporadically or in the context of the inherited tumor syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression has been reported in MPNST, which has been implicated in their pathogenesis. We present three cases that have different pathogenetic origins. Method: The first patient was a 67-year-old woman who received radiotherapy to the axillary region following radical mastectomy for breast cancer 20 years ago. She presented with a mass in the axillary region that has been growing during the last 1.5 years. Second case was a 25-year-old man who was admitted with a 6.5-cm mass in the right anterior femoral region. The tumor was low-grade and consisted of cartilaginous heterologous component. Third case was a 39-year-old man with congenital caf\u00e9-aulait spots and soft tissue swellings all over his body. He was admitted for soft tissue swellings in the left axilla and in the neck region 4 and 3 years ago, respectively. Both of the lesions were diagnosed as plexiform neurofibroma. Currently, the patient attended with 10-cm mass in the gluteal region. Pathologic diagnosis was consistent with MPNST.",

            "text": "Results: The first and the third cases showed a higher EGFR expression than the second case. Conclusion: We aimed to describe the morphological features and discuss the clinical background and different pathogenetic origins of these three cases with MPNST. The role of EGFR overexpression was also evaluated in this case series. Results: The cases reviewed belonged to 28 different subtypes of sarcoma, with leiomyosarcoma of greatest incidence (16%). The most affected age at presentation was 15-64. Gender distribution was almost equal (M/F 53:47). The majority (51%) of cases were located in the trunk. Ten commonly used immunohistochemical markers were identified, with vimentin being the most common (34%). Over 50 surgeons were responsible for the care of these sarcomas. Less than half the cases were graded at diagnosis. Of those graded, 61% were high grade, 13% intermediate grade and 25% low grade. The size at presentation ranged from 1 to 32 cm (mean 5.6 cm). Conclusion: Soft tissue sarcomas are a widely diverse group of uncommon tumours. We confirmed that our incidence rates are comparable with those published in the USA, with leiomyosarcoma being the most common subtype. Of note is that over 50 surgeons were involved in the management of these cases over 10 years. This would suggest a need for a nationalized specialist centre with surgeons experienced in the treatment of these rare tumours. Objective: Calcifying aponeurotic fibroma is a rare soft tissue tumor of children and adolescents. These lesions are presented as slow-growing painless masses that usually affect the distal part of the extremities. They are locally aggressive tumors that infiltrate the surrounding muscle and fascia. Recurrence rate is over 50%, but malign transformation is very rare. We report a 14-year-old boy with calcifying aponeurotic fibroma. Method: We present a 14-year-old boy with non-movable firm mass on his leg. It was represented as a 2 \u00d7 1.5-cm diameter mass which surrounded the peroneal tendon with an infiltrating contour on X-ray and MRI. Fibroblastic proliferation areas, dense collagenous stroma, calcification and osteoid matrix were observed histopathologically. The tumor infiltrated peripheral muscle tissues and surrounding vessels and nerves. There were no mitotic figures and evidence of atypia. Overall, histopathologic and radiologic features exhibited the same characteristics of calcifying aponeurotic fibroma. Conclusion: Calcifying aponeurotic fibroma is a locally aggressive tumor with a high rate of recurrence. Especially in young patients, those under 5 years of age had higher risk of recurrences. Very few cases of malignant transformation have been reported. Surgical total excision is suggested if ever possible and is the mainstay of the treatment approach. However, it is not possible in most of the cases because of its locally infiltrative behaviour. Differential diagnoses include aggressive fibromatosis, nodular fasciit, fibrosarcomas, monophasic synovial sarcoma and some other malignant spindle cell tumors. Surgical management should be conservative; excision and re-excision, if necessary, are preferable to radical or mutilating surgical procedures to maintain the function of the extremity.",

            "text": "Objective: Elastofibroma is a tumor-like lesion of soft tissue characterized by a large number of coarse, enlarged elastic fibers and fatty tissue. Its usual location, in the scapular area, deep in the latissimus dorsi and rhromboid muscles, led to the name \"elastofibroma dorsi\". Most of the elastofibromas are usually asymptomatic, unilateral and occur mainly in middle-aged and elderly women. Clinically, these lesions may simulate an aggressive soft tissue tumor. Method: Design: A 56-year-old woman presented with a slow-growing subcutaneous mass in the right lateral chest wall. CT scan revealed an ill-defined solid mass, lying deep within the latissimus dorsi. The diagnosis of elastofibroma was suspected and the patient underwent a simple excision of the mass. The surgical specimen consisted of a poorly circumscribed mass, measuring 6\u00d74\u00d73 cm, with gray-white cut surface and elastic consistence. The sections were examined with H+E and elastic stains and followed by immunohistochemical study for a-SMA, CD34, and H-Caldesmon. Results: The lesion was composed of a mixture of collagenous stroma, few spindle cells, mature adipose cells and large coarse eosinophilic elastic fibers, which stain with Verhoeff-elastica and Masson-Trichrome. The spindle cells were positive for CD34 and negative for a-SMA and H-Caldesmon. The microscope findings confirmed the preoperative diagnosis. Conclusion: Elastofibroma is an unusual benign lesion cured by simple excision. The irregular elastic fibers may be the result of abnormal elastogenesis. The familial occurrence supports a genetic predisposition to this lesion. The most important differential diagnosis consideration is desmoid fibromatosis. Objective: Soft part sarcoma (SPS) represents a difficult working area, either for the pathologist and the oncologist. Prognostic factors are limited in these tumors, and the search for clinically relevant molecular markers is relatively incipient. We have proposed the present study based on previous results by our group on differential gene expression of soft tissue tumors, which showed significant overexpression of the TOP2a gene in sarcomas. As TOP2a is coded by a gene sited in chromosome 17, we have also included HER-2-neu. Survivine was also included as previous studies have shown a significant correlation with survival in SPS. Our aim was to evaluate immunohistochemical protein expression of the three genes and also assess the gene copy numbers of TOP2a and HER-2-neu by FISH analysis in SPS in order to verify the existence of prognostic value on these parameters. Method: Paraffin-embedded tissues from 274patients with SPS were included in the study.",

Recovery of the CD8 + T cells was associated with a new increase of the arthritis score after 20 days. Thymectomized and antiCD8 mAb-treated mice improved arthritis score permanently.

These results document that CD8 + T cells should be regarded as major players in the K/BxN model of experimental arthritis alongside CD4 + T cells and B cells. Method: A 71-year-old woman presented with postmenopausal bleeding. The diagnosis was mixed Mullerian tumoral proliferation in the probe c\u00fcretage material. Later on, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy was performed. Macroscopically, the specimen had a 6.5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1-cm polypoid mass in the uterine cavity. Microscopically, there was a tumoral proliferation of swollen epithelioid cells that formed sex cord-like tubular formations and showed trabecular and insular patterns. One-layered columnar cells laid the endometrial glands peripherally of this proliferation. The neoplastic cells had mild hyperchromatism and pleomorphism and mitosis. There was no necrosis. Ki-67 proliferation index was 2-3%; the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, smooth muscle actin and Bcl-2, but negative for pancytokeratin, CD34, HMB-45 and alpha-inhibin immunohistochemically.",

In the macroscopical sections of the ovary, there were multiple cysts which had 3.5 cm of greatest diameter. There were sebum-like material and hair in some of these cysts. Microscopically, there was a malignant proliferation of epithelial type that formed tubular, cribriform and polyadenoid formations. The cells of this proliferation were large and pleomorphic and had a high mitotic index. There was necrosis widely. Columnar epithelium was lying in the cystic spaces. There were lipid-laden macrophages and histiocytic multinuclear cells, lymphoplasmositer inflamatuar cell infiltration around them. There were hair follicles focally. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and CDX-2 diffusely and negative for cytokeratin 20. Results: The diagnosis was intestinal-type adenocarcinoma in a background of cystic teratoma. Endoscopically and colonoscopically, there was no tumor in intestines. Conclusion: Although gastrointestinal epithelium is found in mature cystic teratoma, intestinal adenocarcinoma is uncommon in the ovary. Because of its rareness, we present the case here. Objective: Cervical carcinoma metastasises mainly via the lymphatics. Attempts to correlate the expression of various lymphatic markers with lymph node metastasis have provided contradictory results. We investigated the expression of lymphangiogenesis-associated molecules in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Method: The expression of VEGF-D, Prox-1 and D2-40 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in paraffinembedded tissue samples from 72 cases of invasive cervical SCC. Correlations with tumour grade, FIGO stage, lymph node metastases, lymphatic emboli and inflammation were also examined. Results: Cytoplasmic and/or nuclear VEGF-D expression in the tumor cells was found in 63 of 72 (87%) cases and correlated significantly with LN metastasis (p=0.003), lymphatic emboli (p=0.017) and FIGO stage (p=0.023). D2-40 and Prox-1 were expressed in the lymphatic endothelium, while in 35 of 72 (%) cases, nuclear staining for Prox-1 in the tumor cells was also observed. There was a significant correlation between D2-40 peritumoral lymph vessel density (LVD) and the presence of lymphatic emboli (p=0.009) as well as between both intratumoral and peritumoral Prox-1 LVD and the degree of inflammation (p<0.001).

These tumors show frequent PTEN (30-50% of cases) and \u03b2-catenin mutations (15-20% of cases). Method: The study group consisted of 79 cases of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) and 19 cases of endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH). As a control group, 43 cases of anovulatory cycle endometria (ACE) were selected. The immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the endometrial curettings by means of tissue microarray. For the objective evaluation of analysed proteins, expression H scores (percentage of positive cells) have been used. Conclusion: Expression of analysed proteins significantly distinguishes endometrial hyperplasia from disordered endometrial proliferation. The most extreme level of abnormal expression of the studied proteins was seen in atypical hyperplasia, confirming its close relationship to endometrial carcinoma. Analysis of PTEN and \u03b2-catenin expression may be a useful adjunct in small endometrial biopsies from patients with suspected precursor states for endometrial carcinoma. Objective: Cotyledonoid-dissecting leiomyoma of the uterus (CDLU, also known as Sternberg tumor) is an extremely rare variant of smooth muscle neoplasm. Less than 30 cases of CDLU have been reported so far. CDLU is characterized by alarming distinctive gross appearance suggestive of a malignant neoplasm, but paradoxically universally benign clinical behavior. Although the histopathological picture of CDLU was well described, there are few if any data which may explain extrauterine overgrowth of the tumor. Method: Four previously not described cases of CDLU were submitted to histopathologic examination and selected immunohistochemical assays (p16, Ki67, bcl-2, WT-1, p53). Results of immunohistochemical stainings were compared to those previously reported in benign and malignant uterine smooth muscle neoplasms. Results: The age of patients with CDLU ranged from 33 to 52 years (median 50 years). Grossly, all the tumors were exophytic and composed of irregular nodular protrusions. Median diameter of tumors was 8 cm (range 3-11 cm). Microscopically, the cases were composed of smooth muscle fascicles dissecting the extratumoral myometrium and forming swirled nodules, similarly to previous CDLU reports. Nuclear p16 expression was seen in <1% of tumor cells. Ki-67 proliferative index in all CDLU cases was below 1%. Bcl-2 was expressed focally in a single case and diffusely in three other cases. WT-1 diffuse nuclear expression was seen in all cases. All cases were p53-negative. Conclusion: p16/Ki-67/bcl2-/WT-1/p53 immunohistochemical expression patterns in CDLU resembled those previously reported in uterine usual type leiomyomas and did not explain the distinctive gross appearance of these tumors. Objective: Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is subdivided into five histological subtypes: serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and transitional. The differential diagnosis between these subtypes is mostly unproblematic, but is getting difficult in poorly differentiated tumors. The aim of the present study was to establish an immunohistochemical marker panel in a series of unequivocal highly differentiated EOCs that simplify the differentiation in difficult EOCs. Method: We performed an immunostaining study in a small series of highly differentiated EOCs (47 cases). After examining the cases with 23 markers, we identified 13 antibodies as useful markers (CA19-9, CD15, CA125 CD99, CD44v6, CD44H, Claudin1, EGFR, FAK, OPN, p63, p53, and PR). The percentage of the antibody-marked tumor cells per tumor was observed counted. The F test was used to determine differences between the means of percent expressions of the antibodies.

Histologically, most lymphangiomas are of cavernous type and do not exceed 4-5 cm in diameter. We report two unusually large lymphangiomas measuring 7 and 9 cm in diameter, respectively, both of them presenting with ultrasonographical images of malignancy due to the large size and multicystic appearance. Method: Patients were 50 and 51 years old, respectively, the latter with a clinical history of 20 pregnancies and associated leiomyoma and endometrial polyp.

However, a large for gestational age and dysmature fetus without anomalies and characteristic gross and microscopic placental findings were diagnostic of PMD. The distinction between PHM and PMD is clinically valid as PHM can be complicated by persistent gestational trophoblastic disease or trophoblastic tumors. The presence of diandric triploidy is not automatically equivalent to PHM. Objective: The biological role of phosphorylation of the p53 protein in tumour cells is still investigated. The study evaluated p53 protein overexpression, p53 phosphorylated at serine 20 (Ser20), serine 392 (Ser392), and expression of Bax, CAS proteins in ovarian neoplasms and their association with clinicopathological parameters. Method: The expression of analyzed proteins was examined on 145 malignant and 50 benign ovarian neoplasms using immunohistochemistry. Results: Differences between the expression of studied proteins in benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms were significant (P<0.001). p53-Ser20 phosphorylation was associated with advanced stage (P=0.03). p53 protein overexpression was associated with poor differentiated tumour (P=0.001), while the differences between CAS expression were observed in moderate and poor tumour grade (P=0.03). The correlations between Bax/p53-Ser392, CAS/p53-Ser20 and p53-Ser392 expression were found in ovarian carcinomas (P<0.01). p53/CAS-positive cancers were associated with poor differentiated (P=0.005) and advanced tumours (P=0.001). p53/Bax-positive cases were found in poorly differentiated cancers (P=0.001). These immunophenotypes revealed phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20 and 392 in 60.0% of cases. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the expression of p53 protein phosphorylated at Ser20 might depend on the morphological maturity of tumour cells. The revealed associations between Bax, CAS and p53 protein phosphorylated at serine 20 and 392 expression indicate that phosphorylation of p53 protein at Ser20 and 392 might play a role in the regulation of apoptosis-related protein expression in ovarian carcinomas.",

Absence of normal follicles of any degree of maturing and yellow bodies, presence of cystically variated follicles, a considerable quantity of atretic follicles, and presence of white bodies are microscopically observed. It is possible to assume that constant illumination of animals causes stimulation of the production of serotonin and inhibition of the production of a melatonin by a cone-shaped gland. In the beginning, there is a stimulation of a hypothalamus-hypophysial-ovarian axis and then exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms and development of hormonal sterility. Objective: The expression of P16 protein is associated with a high risk of HPV infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if overexpression of P16INK4A protein can be a useful biomarker to detect dysplastic cells in cervical smears of women with normal colposcopic findings but HGSIL cytology. Method: Cases were retrospectively searched in cytology data of the past 5 years. One hundred thirty-nine cervical smears from patients with HGSIL were reviewed by two cytologists. The colposcopic results concerning those cases were also obtained from the records. Forty-three of 139 (30.9%) women had no pathologic colposcopic findings. Immunocytochemistry for P16 was performed on all cases with normal colposcopy and HGSIL cytology. The immunocytochemical staining results were estimated and classified into four grades: 0, 1 (1-5% positive cells), 2 (5-25% and patchy), 3 (>25% and diffuse). Results: The P16 protein expression was not observed in two cases (4.6%), whereas it was strong and diffuse in nine patients (20.9%). Strong and patsy P16 expression was detected in 13 patients with HGSIL cytology and normal colposcopy (30.2%). Rare positive cells (1-3% cells with nucleus stained with anti-P16 antibody) were present in 19 cervical smears (44.2%). Conclusion: Colposcopy with guided biopsy detects approximately two thirds of CIN 3 cases (Gage et al., National Cancer Institute, USA, 2006) . Increased expression of P16INK4A reflects the increasing expression of viral oncogenes in dysplastic cervical cells. P16INK4A is a specific biomarker to identify HGSILs, so it could be a useful adjunct for the reevaluation women with HGSIL cytology and normal colposcopy in order to correct the underdiagnosed HGSILs and prevent delay in therapeutic managements. Objective: Prior to the introduction of computer-assisted screening in the Netherlands, it was agreed upon to first validate this method with an a priori agreed upon uniform protocol for validation. Aim was a kappa value of 0.6 or higher.",

Embolic material was seen cytologically in four cases. Of the 22 embolized meningiomas, nine of them showed no significant cytological abnormalities. Conclusion: Embolization of meningiomas induces cytolomorphological changes that may be relevant in some cases. Greater cellular dissociation and ischemic changes, as well as inflammation, may result in a worrisome cytological image. When faced with such changes, the pathologist should always consider the possibility of embolization, avoiding overgrading or misdiagnosis. The statistical comparison of different parameters was made using Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman rank order correlation, with the aim of establishing statistically relevant differences and Spearman correlation coefficients (r) between glucose in blood and periodontal disease, ageand sex-related, the length of the diabetes disease, the cytological periodontal stage and the length of the periodontal disease, age-related.",

Objective: Treatment of malignant peritoneal effusions is generally palliative; therefore, quality of life issues, as well as the risks and benefits of the therapeutic options, become more critical. Cytomorphologic examination alone provides only limited sensitivity for the detection of metastatic carcinoma cells in many cases of serous effusions. Early diagnosis and management of peritoneal metastases from cancer patients represent new directions of researches. Method: The current study was aimed at differentiating peritoneal liquids encountered in 81 available cases, chosen to show both biochemical patterns (benign and malignant) and in this way to achieve a diagnostic value of the biochemical method. A panel of 17 biochemical markers (TP, ALB, LDH, TC, GL, TL, TG, AA, ALP, U, TB, DB, AST, ALT, Mg, Fe, K) were determined from the resulted supernatant after centrifugation in blood and peritoneal fluid using automatic and semi-automatic biochemistry analyzer.",

Objective: Hyalinizing trabecular tumor (HTT) is an unusual type of thyroid follicular neoplasm that may represent a major diagnostic problem in routine thyroid practice. Method: We present the case of a 31-year-old woman in which a fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed for a 2.2-cm unique nodule, incidentally discovered in the left thyroid lobe. A hemi-thyroidectomy was performed as the aspiration specimen was reported suspicious for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Macroscopically, the nodule was light tan and well circumscribed. In microscopy, it had prominent trabecular architecture and cytological features strongly suggesting a PTC: nuclear enlargement with particularly abundant nuclear grooves and cytoplasmic invaginations. An intratrabecular abundant, homogenous and eosinophilic hyaline material was also noticed. Immunohistochemistry, including anti-thyroglobulin, anti-TTF1, anti-HBEM1, anti-CK19 and anti-MIB1 antibodies, was performed.",

The differential diagnosis is essential because unlike PTC, HTT is considered a benign tumor and has a different behavior and therapeutic approach. Objective: Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem and the fine needle aspiration (FNA) has become a standard procedure for their clinical triage. Its widespread use allows a better selection of patients in need of surgical treatment. Method: Four thousand three hundred fifty-nine FNA were performed between 1998 and 2008, always by the same pathologist using a 27-gauge needle and a Cameco suction device. At least three aspirations were carried out, and three to five slides were obtained for each nodule. They were immediately fixed in alcohol and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or with Papanicolaou. The cytological diagnosis was classified in four categories: inadequate, benign, suspicious and malignant. Six hundred thirty-eight cases had a histological follow-up.

Results: In the right lobe, there were two, tan brown, nodular lesions measuring 1.5 and 0.7 cm, respectively, consisting of PTC oncocytic type with follicular and focal papillary pattern and a classic variant of PTC. In the lower pole of the left lobe, a grayish nodule of 0.6 cm, with trabecular, follicular and focal papillar architecture was detected, presenting small tumor cells, pleomorphic nuclei and occasional cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions. Tumor cells showed intense positive expression for TG, CK7 and moderate reactivity for CgA and CT. HBME1 was focally positive with membrane staining along lateral and abluminal surfaces. Conclusion: Our case report emphasizes the role of detailed histopathological analysis, especially when thyroid nodules harbor various aspects, and the use of immunohistochemistry in the identification of rare types of thyroidian neoplasm.

Purpose: We describe a case of primary, poorly differentiated angiosarcoma in a 57-year-old male who presented with a rapidly enlarging thyroid mass and mild dysphagia during the preceding month. Method: A CT scan of the neck revealed a large tumor mass in the upper pole of the left lobe of the thyroid measuring 6.5\u00d75.5\u00d77 cm extending into the surrounding adipose tissue and infiltrating the left internal jugular vein. Lymphadenopathy was identified in the left submandibular region and lower neck. Cytomorphologically, the aspirate was cellular, with variably cohesive clusters of atypical spindle cells and necrotic masses. Thyreoidectomy procedure was performed. Histologically, the tumor was composed of spindle, polygonal and epithelioid cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli growing in solid sheets and occasionally forming cleft-like vascular spaces filled with erythrocytes. Extensive necrosis was present. Mitotic activity was 28 mitoses/10 HPF. Immunohistochemical stains showed tumor positivity for CD31, vimentin, factor VIII, WT-1, M-ACT and CD99. Conclusion: The prognosis in primary angiosarcoma of thyroid is generally poor especially if the tumor penetrates the capsule of the thyroid or if there are metastases present. The patient developed further metastases in the cervical lymph nodes within few weeks after thyroidectomy despite radio-and chemotherapy. Due to the rapid progression of the disease, the patient was scheduled for palliative radiotherapy. The patient succumbed to the disease 14 months after diagnosis. Objective: Pheochromocytoma can be defined as a paraganglioma of the adrenal medulla and has been called the \"10% tumor\" because approximately 10% are bilateral, 10% are extra-adrenal, 10% occur in children, and 10% are malignant. Aim: In this report, we described the histopathological aspects of pheochromocytoma in correlation with immunohistochemical reaction.

Objective: Accurate identification of KRAS mutations has great importance for target therapy. Reproducibility and cheapness of different methods are crucial to be safely applied in colorectal routine diagnostic setting. Method: One hundred twelve FFEP specimens, previously studied by ARMS/Scorpions real-time PCR (Therascreen, Roche, Italy) designed as reference method, were in parallel analysed by other two methods: restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR (Ampli-set-K-Ras, Bird, Italy) and PCR/reverse hybridization tests (K-Ras StripAssay, ViennaLab, Austria), respectively, called methods A and B. The methods were compared considering the results, costs, and working times. Regarding KRAS genotype, 112 selected samples were: 40 wild type (wt), 40 mutated in codon 12, and 32 in codon 13. Results: Six of 40 wt samples showed mutation on codon 12: Three were false positives of method A and three of method B. Two of 40 samples mutated in codon 12 resulted also positive on codon 13 by method B. Since method A is based on cleavage action of the restriction enzyme, we have increased both restriction enzyme concentration and digestion time, abolishing the false positives. On the contrary, there was no way of acting on method B. Conclusion: Although method A does not define the codon 12 mutation type and is time-consuming, it leads to the same results of the reference method operating our slight methodological modifications. Method A resulted cheap (45% of the reference kit price), useful and reproducible for routinely KRAS testing in colorectal target therapy. Work was supported by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Puglia, Italy. Objective: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a worldwide common malignancy; young patients represent a third of all cases, with a rise over the last years. Fifteen percent of CRC have microsatellite instability (MSI) due to alterations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Familiar MSI cases (5%) have germline mutations. Sporadic MSI CRC (15%) have hypermetilated MLH-1 promoter. BRAF V600E mutation exclusively occurs in sporadic MSI CRC. Immunohistochemistry detects MSI cases with high concordance with microsatellite analysis. The objective was to compare histopathology and patterns of expression of MMR proteins and BRAF V600E mutation in patients below and over 50 years old and determine if age is a risk factor for defective MMR protein expression and BRAF mutations. Method: One hundred six patients <50 years were retrieved. Age, sex, location, histologic type, TNM, infiltration and metastatic lymph nodes data were collected. MLH1 and MSH2 immunohistochemistry and BRAF RT-PCR mutation was performed in 48 <50 years and 48 patients >50 years as control group. Student's t, \u03c7 2 and logistic regression analysis were carried out. Results: Medullary and mucinous types were more frequent among young patients and intestinal type in older patients (p=0.0008). No differences were noticed regarding clinicopathological stages between groups. MMRP expression was absent more frequently in <50 and MSH2 was negative in 13.8% of these patients. No BRAF mutations were detected in any group. Conclusion: We found an association between young age and defective MMR expression (OR 4.28). MSH2 lack of expression is more frequently due to a germline mutation. The fact that none of our patients had BRAF mutation could be partly due to the small sample size or alternate V600E or K-ras mutations. Objective: Angiogenesis plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) is the predominant angiogenic factor in CRC. VEGFA is expressed in approximately 50% of CRCs, with minimal to no expression in normal colonic mucosa. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic impact of VEGFA amplification in CRC. Method: VEGFA gene amplification was evaluated in a large series of sporadic CRC resections (n=1,280) by FISH analysis using the tissue microarray technique. Spectrum Green-labeled probes originated from the FISH Clone RP1-261G23 were used together with Spectrum Orange-labeled probes for the respective centromere 6 as a reference. The VEGFA amplification status was compared to relevant clinicopathological features. Results: VEGFA amplification was detected in 39 patients (3%) and was significantly associated with higher T stage and higher tumor grade, presence of vascular invasion, right-sided location (p <0.001) and B-RAF mutation (p=0.015). Additionally, VEGF amplification was associated with worse survival in univariate (p <0.001) and multivariable analysis (p<0.001; HR (95% CI), 2.06 (1.4-3.0)). Conclusion: VEGFA amplification seems to highlight a small subset of CRCs with aggressive phenotype. Therefore, FISH analysis of VEGFA could represent an alternative evaluation system for identifying patients with poorer clinical outcome who could be candidates for anti-VEGFA therapies. Objective: K-Ras oncogene is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer and is currently established as a predictive biomarker for anti-EGFR targeted therapy. B-Raf is a serine/threonine kinase of the RAS/RAF/MEK /ERK signal transduction pathway which is mutated in a subset of K-Ras wild-type patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the mutational status of K-Ras and B-Raf genes in correlation with tumor clinicopathological characteristics.",

Three hundred forty-four cases were screened for K-Ras and B-Raf mutations at codons 12 and 13 and exon 15 respectively using high-resolution melting analysis, sequencing and/or pyrosequencing. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA for Windows. Results: K-Ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 were present in 133 out of 344 cases. The most frequent types of mutation were pG12D and pG12V at codon 12 and pG13D at codon 13. B-Raf mutations in exon 15 (pV600E) were present in 4.6% of analyzed samples. B-Raf mutations were observed in a marginally higher frequency in women, whereas K-Ras mutations were positively correlated with patients' age. Moreover, there was a higher prevalence of B-Raf mutations in low-grade carcinomas (p=0.005). Conclusion: The detected mutation frequency as well as the prevalence of specific mutation types is in accordance with previous studies. The observed correlation of B-Raf mutation with tumor grade implies its importance as a marker of tumor aggressiveness. The applied methods (HRM and pyrosequencing) were proven to be sensitive, fast and accurate for mutation detection in a clinical setting. Objective: Aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase)-AKT pathway is frequently observed in a wide range of cancers such as breast, colorectal, ovarian and lung. Several components of this pathway such as PI3K and AKT can constitute potential therapeutic targets, and many small molecule inhibitors are in development on early clinical trials. The aim of this study was to examine the possible significance of somatic point mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1 genes as biological markers or therapeutic targets in primary urothelial bladder carcinoma. Method: One hundred twenty-two urinary bladder cancer specimens were screened for activating mutations in exons 9, 20 of the PIK3CA gene as well as in exon 4 of AKT1 gene by PCR-SSCP and high-resolution melting analysis.

Tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histological examination and their antigenicity was determined by immunohistochemistry. The integrity of DNA extracted from the samples with formalin fixation or formalin-free fixation was compared with that of cryosections with gel electrophoresis and the Bioanalyzer. Furthermore, PCR-PFLPs and real-time PCR (high-resolution melting analysis) were performed in order to assess the suitability of the extracted DNA for downstream molecular pathological applications. Results: Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against bamyloid and tau did not reveal any significant differences in reactivity for both fixatives. On the other hand, DNA extracted from frozen samples was of comparable integrity with that from formalin-free fixation. Amplification efficiency for short DNA fragments (140-240 bp) was similar between all preservation methods; however, long fragments (854 bp) could not be amplified from formalin-fixed tissues.",

Objective: The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of esophageal cancer remain elusive. The aim of this study was to examine the simultaneous presence of alterations in two main signal transduction pathways, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT, which are implicated in carcinogenesis. The prognostic significance of pERK expression was also investigated. Method: Genomic DNA was extracted from 32 paraffinembedded tissue blocks (9 squamous-cell, 2 adenosquamous cell and 21 adenocarcinomas). Additionally, in 15 cases, tumor cells were collected using laser microdissection in order to minimize contamination with stromal and normal cells. We searched for somatic mutations in Kras, B-raf, EGFR, AKT-1 and PIK3CA genes by performing high-resolution analysis and pyrosequencing.

Furthermore, pERK cytoplasmic immunopositivity was correlated with tumor grade. Conclusion: Mutations in K-ras gene are not frequently detected in esophageal cancer, but do exist. The lack of mutations in B-raf, EGFR, AKT-1 genes implies that these may not play an important role in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. The correlation of pERK nuclear expression with stage and grade implicates pERK as a marker of local tumor aggressiveness. Objective: Mutation analysis in RAS/RAF signaling pathway plays a key role in treatment decision in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). At this time, several methods are available for KRAS mutation detection; there are also commercially available kits, but validated methods and standardized testing procedures are still lacking. Method: Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues after the evaluation of material by pathologists. For mutation analysis of KRAS gene, we used three methods: direct sequencing, allelic discrimination and high-resolution melting (HRM). Results: We tested 21 tumor samples (primary tumors and metastasis) from 15 patients with mCRC. We identified KRAS mutation in 5 of 15 (33%) patients using allelic discrimination, while HRM detected mutations in 6 of 15 (40%) patients. Due to low burden of tumor cells in two cases and limited sensitivity of sequencing, only 13 patients were evaluated by this method. Out of them, four (31%) patients showed positivity. We performed sensitivity testing: allelic discrimination (5% of mutant DNA), HRM (10%) and sequencing (25%). Conclusion: Allelic discrimination is a convenient, fast and sensitive method designed for the detection of specific mutations. Test costs are proportional to the number of tested mutations since a specific assay has to be used for each mutation. Sequencing has a limited application due to low sensitivity, while HRM represents a sensitive, rapid and cost-limited methodology, but displays higher rate of false positive results if DNA is in poor quality. This technique is suitable for routine screening; however, precise identification of mutations is not possible. Therefore, a combination of at least two methods is highly recommended. Objective: MGMT repairs DNA damages and act as a tumor suppressor gene in normal cells, preventing DNA mutation. Several different approaches for MGMT immunohistochemical (IHC) testing have been used, resulting in a not universally accepted standard. We evaluated the IHC expression of MGMT using five different primary antibodies in 59 invasive breast carcinomas in order to establish the most reliable marker for this protein. The results of immunostaining were compared to qRT-PCR, used as a parameter of reliability of gene expression. Method: Cases were randomly selected to build a tissue microarray. The five primary antibodies to MGMT were provided by: MT3.1 (NeoMarkers, GeneTex and Santa Cruz), SPM287 (Santa Cruz) and MT23.2 (Zymed). Heatinduced antigen retrieval in citrate and the Advance\u2122 (Dako) detection system were used. IHC was visually analyzed by microscope and automated analyzed by software applied to digital slides. qRT-PCR was performed in all tumors for transcript expression quantification. Results: Antibody SPM287 (Santa Cruz) showed the highest sensitivity (p<0.001), and antibody MT3.1 (Santa Cruz) showed the least sensitivity (p<0.001). Antibody MT23.2 (Zymed) showed higher levels of cytoplasm staining, which was not observed in the other antibodies tested (p<0.001). qRT-PCR results showed that 94.9% of the samples showed hypoexpression of MGMT when compared to normal breast (p<0.001).

For proving antibody specificity, in situ hybridization with a cRNA probe of LGR5 is carried out on the same tissue samples used for immunohistochemistry. As positive control, we generate a LGR5 expressing human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by retroviral transduction. Results: The LGR5 antibody from Epitomics\u00ae stains the outer root sheath of human hair follicle in anagen, whereas Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae's anti-LGR5 antibody recognizes LGR5 in the inner root sheath. Nerve tissue is completely negative using the Epitomics\u00ae antibody, but contrarily, the anti-LGR5 antibody from MBL\u00ae shows strong staining of Purkinje cells as well as of other nerve cells in the cortex and spinal cord.

Metabolic phenotyping may provide new information for a better management of this disease. Method: We collected molecular profiles based on HRMAS spectra for 31 high-grade glioma biopsies (25 GBM and 6 AAs). The amount of human tumor tissue analyzed for each subject ranged from 20 to 40 mg. All samples were analyzed by post-HRMAS histopathology to assess the tissue integrity and double validate histological diagnosis. Results: Two major metabolic groups were detected, which included 16 and 11 samples, respectively. Most AAs were located in the same group. The phospholipid patterns and the glutamine/glutamate metabolic relatives seem to be the most relevant contribution to this grouping pattern.",

In vitro data indicate that NM pigment is formed from the excess cytosolic catecholamine that is not accumulated into synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter2 (VMAT2). Method: Using semiquantitative immunohistochemical methods in human postmortem brain, we sought to examine the relationship between the contents of VMAT2 and NM pigment. The immunostaining intensity (ISI) was measured for VMAT2 in two regions of the midbrain dopaminergic cell complex. The ISI of the cells was related to the density of NM pigment within the cells. We also measured the ISI for tyrosine hydoxylase (TH) and examined the noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in brain 22--65 years of age. Objective: Human mitochondrial diseases have a relatively high incidence, multiple genetic causes and quite diverse clinical, biochemical and morphological phenotypes requiring a multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis.

In the original biopsy group, all biopsies reported as atypical (but not meeting criteria for carcinoma) were further analysed for changes on follow-up biopsy. In the repeat biopsy group, repeat biopsies performed for increased PSA and for previous atypical diagnosis were analysed separately and compared. Conclusion: Repeat prostate biopsy is often performed for persistently elevated or rising PSA and previous diagnosis of atypical changes. Our study assessed the likelihood of finding carcinoma in a follow-up biopsy performed for these two reasons. Our study also compared the biopsy adequacy and extent and grade of carcinoma found in both initial and repeat biopsies.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) take important roles in these processes acting in a coordinated manner to form an integrated system. The aim of the study was the evaluation of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression and the correlation with clinicopathological parameters and survival in GC. Method: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 82 gastric cancers were studied for the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein by immunohistochemistry. Objective: AMACR plays role in beta oxidation of branched fatty acids. It is expressed in several neoplasms like prostatic, hepatic and thyroid cancers. It is also believed to be expressed in gastric carcinoma (GC), particularly in better differentiated and less advanced lesions. The aim of the study was to assess AMACR expression in GC and its correlation with clinical and histological prognostic factors. Objective: Brunner's gland hyperplasia is a rare lesion, with fewer than 240 cases having been reported in the literature. It is considered to be a hamartoma, developing from the submucosal glands, usually in the first or second part of the duodenum. Most of the lesions described were polypoid and <2 cm in greatest diameter. Often, there is an association with peptic ulcer disease. Method: We report the case of a 31-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The anamnestic data showed chronic ulcer disease. He also was anaemic, with a slight raise in blood eosinophilia. Results: The radiological examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed pyloric stenosis due to a polypoid mass measuring 1 cm. Preoperative diagnosis of the mass could not be established. The mass was excised and at the same time a vagotomy with pyloroplasty (Finney) was performed. Brushing cytology of the surgical specimen revealed a great number of aggregated Brunner's glands without any atypia, as well as many lymphocytes. A frozen section was negative for malignancy. The histologic diagnosis was that of diffuse nodular Brunner's gland hyperplasia (hamartoma) accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration. The rate of cellular proliferation was low. During the postoperative period, there were no complications. A subsequent gastroscopy showed no pathologic findings, and the patient is well at present. Conclusion: Our case is reported because of its rarity and the difficulties in preoperative diagnosis. The literature is also reviewed. Objective: In the differential diagnosis of GIST, associated mesenchymal lesion represents an additional challenge. Method: A 51-year-old woman with intestinal occlusion at surgery showed an ileal invagination on polypoid mass of 4 cm and an ileal suberosal nodule of 1 cm. Results: The polypoid lesion, ulcerating the mucosa and growing in the muscular wall with subserosal hourglass-like expansion, showed a monotonous hypocellular mesenchy-mal proliferation (CD34 + , CD117 \u2212 ) with prominent vascular network in myxoid inflammatory stroma. Considering the peculiar degenerative, inflammatory pattern of the polyp due to ischemia and the existence of a subset of GIST c-Kit negative, differential diagnosis was GIST (c-Kit \u2212 ) or inflammatory fibroid polyp (CD34 + ). After a careful review of the clinical and immunohistochemical and pathological findings, final diagnosis was inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP). The minor nodule showing a spindle cell proliferation (CD117 + ) was diagnosed as GIST. To our knowledge, no other studies report IFP and GIST occurring synchronous in the ileum. Conclusion: The correct definition of these lesions is crucial: Defining both tumors as GISTs, prognostic and therapeutic assessment becomes poor (multiple familial or advanced metastatic GIST). The recent discovery of PDGFR mutation (the mutually exclusive mutation of wild-type cKIT GISTs) in the IFP questions his reactive nature and raises the possibility of a neoplastic process. Then, the questions arising are whether the two tumors represent a fortuitous coexistence or involve the same carcinogenic agents on the same gene (located in the chromosome 4q) and if the proliferation can be inhibited by STI571. Objective: Melanoma is a rare tumor of the anorectal area and accounts 0.1% to 1.7% of all anal tumours and approximately 1% of all primary melanomas. Besides the positivity with conventional melanocytary immunohistochemical markers S100, HMB45, Melan A are primary anorectal melanomas positive also with marker CD117 and negative with monoclonal antibody CEA. The primary anorectal melanoma is a typical BRAF mutation (exon 15+11) and the allelic loss NF1 associated with neurofibromatosis.",

We hypothesized that the evaluation of tumor budding could complement K-RAS analysis to improve the individualized prediction of response to anti-EGFR-based therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Method: Forty-three patients with mCRC treated with cetuximab or panitumumab were entered into this study. According to the RECIST criteria, 30 patients had stable or progressive disease (non-responsive, NR), while 13 patients had a partial response (PR). Tumor buds were evaluated from whole tissue sections stained for pan-cytokeratin, evaluated in the densest region using a \u00d740 objective, and \"high-grade\" tumor budding was defined as 15 buds/highpower field. Results: Tumor buds and K-RAS mutation both correctly classified 68% of patients. All patients with K-RAS mutation (n = 7) or high-grade tumor budding (n =11) were NR, of which four patients had both features. All 13 PR were K-RAS wild type with low-grade tumor budding. Combined, the predictive value of K-RAS and tumor budding was 80%. Additionally, high-grade tumor budding was significantly related to worse progression-free survival (HR (95%CI), 2.8 (1.3-6.0, p =0.008)). Method: Inter-institutional and interdisciplinary cooperation (of pathologists, geneticians, molecular biologists and oncologists of all three centers) during the last 15 months based on mutual exchange of ideas, materials and laboratory protocols and common meetings and seminars. In the centres, the following three methodical options were tested-sequencing, RT-PCR (TheraScreen\u00ae) and SNaPshot multiplex analysis-and the results of the examinations were retested using another method to verify specificity and sensitivity of the testing. Results: K-ras mutations were present in 23.52% of the cases, seven adenocarcinomas and one liver metastasis. EGFR was positive in ten cases in tumor cells and in seven cases in the vessels. Immunohistochemical overexpression of ras protein was detected in 15 samples.

Conclusion: Thyroxin supplementation causes redox equilibrium disorders and oxidative stress in liver of rats receiving DOX. The study revealed the normalizing influence of thyroxin on glycogen deposits that were observed after doxorubicin treatment. Objective: Dysadherin is a cancer-associated cell membrane glycoprotein that inhibits cell-cell adhesion. In many types of cancer, dysadherin is related to decreased E-cadherin expression, promotes metastasis and is an independent predictor of poor patient survival. Dysadherin expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been studied to date. Method: We studied by immunohistochemistry 70 HCC (grade I, 11; II, 28; III, 24; and IV, 7) from 70 patients (M/F 3.5, mean age 65.7 range 45-85 years) with monoclonal antibodies specific for dysadherin (clone NCC-M53) and \u0395cadherin (clone 36/E-cadherin).

In the gallbladder, cholecystitis chronica is diagnosed often with a disregard of the features of hyperplasia and metaplasia. Generally accepted markers of precancerous changes of the gallbladder and biliary ducts are still to be found. Aim: The aim was to define the accumulation of TP53 protein and MIB1 activity in hyperplasia, metaplasia and dysplasia of the mucous membrane of the gallbladder. Method: The material comprises 325 gallbladders operated by laparoscopy and fixed in formalin. Specimens were embedded in paraffin. In the microscopic sections with hyperplasia, metaplasia and dysplasia immunohistochemical stainings for TP53 and MIB1 were done along with mucycarmin and PAS with Alcian blue stainings (mucous presence). Results: The histopathologic diagnosis revealed 295 cases (91%) of chronic calculous cholecystitis, 23 cases of acute inflammation and secen cases of cancer. Hyperplasia, metaplasia or dysplasia were found in 44 cases (13.5%) with chronic inflammation and accounted for hyperplasia without metaplasia-26 cases, pseudopyloric or intestinal metaplasia-16 cases, dysplasia-2 cases. Mucous stain-ings confirmed the presence of pseudopyloric and intestinal metaplasia, which helped distinguish them from adenomyosis focuses. IHC confirmed the accumulation of TP 53 protein and proliferative activity in metaplasia and dysplasia of the mucous membrane. Conclusion: Mucous stainings and positive TP53 and MIB1 reactions suggest that metaplasia and dysplasia of the mucous membrane of the gallbladder can be classified as intraepithelial neoplasia changes. More research should be done. Objective: We aimed to investigate the relationship between the findings in total or partial hepatectomy specimens. Method: One hundred six cases were collected who had total transplantation or partial hepatectomies because of liver cirrhosis (LC), HCC or other hepatic disorders from the archives. Then, clinical, histopathologic features and serologic findings of the cases were reviewed. The relationship between the histopathologic features and endoscopic, clinical and serologic results were investigated statistically using comparison tests. Results: For the last 2-year period, data from 106 patients who underwent transplantation or hepatectomy were collected. Ninety-five had total, ten had partial hepatectomies, and one had metastasectomy. After the gross and microscopic examination, 86 cases were diagnosed as LC, 32 had HCC, three had parasitic cystic disease and ten had other unusual diseases. Among LC cases, 34 had hepatitis B virus (HBV), seven had hepatitis C virus (HCV), three had mixed virus etiology, six were alcoholic and 14 were due to other causes. Among LC patients, 32 had HCC. Fourteen cases were found to have one, seven had two and 11 had more than two tumors.

Four were located in the tail and one in the pancreatic head. All patients underwent surgery with negative margins. One patient had hepatic and nodal metastases as well as lymphatic and perineural invasion. All tumors were positive for CD56 and CD10, three for progesterone receptors. None of the patients presented tumor recurrence (2 months to 14 years). Conclusion: Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses. Surgery is usually curative and should also be attempted in rare cases with an aggressive behaviour. Despite the characterization of the morphologic and molecular features of this enigmatic neoplasm, more work is needed to uncover its cell of origin and true histogenesis. Objective: Serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) are rare pancreatic tumors. The aim of the study was to describe histopathological characteristics of 31 SCN diagnosed in a single center during a 20-year-long period. Method: Pathological reports including macro-and microscopic descriptions of SCN cases as well as routine slides were retrieved from institutional databases and retrospectively reevaluated. Only cases with available original slides were included in the study. Results: Several clinicopathologic SCN subtypes were distinguished: 25 serous microcystic adenomas (80.6%), five serous oligocystic and ill-demarcated adenomas (16.1%) and a single case of microcystic adenoma coexisting with multiple serous cysts in von Hippel-Lindau patient (3.2%). There were 25 females (80.6%) and six males (19.4%). Median patients' age was 63 years (range 31-93 years). Fifteen cases (48.4%) were localized in the head of the pancreas, 11 (35.5%) in the pancreatic body, and five (16.1%) in the tail. Median tumor diameter was 4.0 cm (range 1-12 cm, the diameter of three tumors was not known). Eleven cases (35.5%) were diagnosed in pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens, six (19.4%) in middle segment pancreatectomy specimens, and four (12.9%) in distal pancreatectomy specimens. Six cases (19.4%) were enucleated, two cases (6.4%) were diagnosed in open biopsy and two (6.4%) cases were found during autopsy. Conclusion: SCN is found in middle-aged or older patients, mainly women. SCN may be localized in each pancreatic segment and grow to large masses. The reasons for preferential existence of SCN in females remain unknown.",

Histologic examination of pancreatic tissue discovered multiple small non-caseating epithelioid cell and giant cell granulomas replacing the islets of Langerhans. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our case represents the first description of non-infectious granulomatous pancreatitis associated with diabetes mellitus of LADA type. Objective: Evaluation of Crohn's disease (CD) activity is crucial to optimize therapeutic strategies. Differentiation between inflammatory and fibrostenotic lesions is decisive since the former are treated with drugs, while the latter require surgery. CD activity is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and radiologic findings, which cannot reliably distinguish between both entities. In patients with refractory symptoms, therapy decisions rely heavily on histologic diagnosis. Method: Preoperative MR imaging was performed in 27 CD patients undergoing elective bowel resection. MR evaluated wall thickness, pre-and post-contrast wall signal intensity, relative contrast enhancement, presence of edema, and luminal stenosis. Matched histological sections of the MR images were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Evaluation of wall and submucosa thickness, percentage of inflammatory and fibrous components in the mucosa and submucosa (Masson's trichromic and reticulin stains), submucosal edema, and vascularity (CD31 stains). Results: Cases assessed as inflammatory by HE had higher early post-contrast signal intensity by RM than fibrostenotic cases (p=0.009). Submucosal thickness correlated with early fibrosis (reticulin, p=0.007), but only a trend with high vascularity (CD31). Fibrostenotic cases had submucosal thickness inversely correlated with early signal capture and with relative contrast enhancement. Mucosal inflammation was inversely correlated with submucosal fibrosis and thickness (p=0.007). Established fibrosis (trichromic) had no delayed signal capture (p=0.038).",

Cysts were thin-walled, translucent, with a smooth outer surface, and mostly filled with clear and some with hemorrhagic fluid. Histologically, they were lined by a single layer of cuboidal polygonal and focally hobnailshaped cells with small uniform nuclei without mitotic activity. Cells stained positive for cytokeratin, calretinin and WT-1, but were negative for endothelial markers, CEA and estrogen and progesterone receptors.

A tumor size varied from 1.5 to 17 cm (mean = 8.9 cm). Tumors were localized in the esophagus (5/45.5%), stomach (1/9.1%), colon (1/9.1%), retroperitoneum (1/9.1%) and in the pelvis (3/27.3%). Histologically, tumors are composed of elongated or ovoid cells with pale nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm which is distinctly fibrillar. Immunohistochemically, cells of SMT were positive for SMA (100%), desmin (100%), vimentin (100%) and NSE (72.7%), but they were negative for CD117, CD34 and S100. I found that the scattered cells of the tumors were characterized by the expression of CD117 (11/100%), CD34 (7/63.6%) and S100 (5/45.5%). These cells were located diffusely or focally in the SMT. The immunophenotype of these cells was similar to immunohistochemical features of the interstitial cells of Cajal or the gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Conclusion: Although the scattered tumor cells revealed CD117 positivity, the histological finding was similar to SMT and was different from GIST. SMT colonized by CD117/CD34-positive cells should not be confused with GISTs.",

The tumour was located in the right colon in 11 cases (13.3%) and 72 cases in the left colon (86.7%). There were three grade 1 (3.6%), 58 grade 2 (69.9%), and 22 grade 3 tumours (26.5%). The number of metastatic lymph nodes was significantly higher in grade 3 tumours compared to grade 2 tumours in TNM5, TNM6 and TNM7. According to TNM5, significantly more metastatic lymph nodes were determined than TNM6 and TNM7 (p<0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), whereas TNM6 revealed significantly more metastatic lymph nodes in comparison to TNM7 (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our results show that there is significant variation between updates of TNM in terms of metastatic lymph node yield which will inevitably cause variation in the TNM classification. Objective: Metastatic lesions to the mandible are rare, comprising <1% of all malignancies. An 82-year-old woman presented with a painful swelling in the right mandible growing progressively for 3 months. Method: Computed tomography (CT) showed intraosseous expansile and destructive lesion in the corpus of the right mandible 23 \u00d7 21 mm in size expanding to the soft tissue laterally. After administration of contrast material, moderate enhancement was seen throughout the mass. The biopsy showed stromal tumor immunopositivity for CD117. The patient had a medical history of ileal tumor resection 5 years ago at another institute which was diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and classified as intermediate risk group for potential of malignancy. Results: The mandibular tumor was considered as a metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor. No tumor was seen on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT other than the mass in the right mandible. The histopathology of the ileal tumor was seen and the diagnosis was confirmed. Imatinib treatment was started at a dose of 400 mg daily. Resection of the mandibular mass was planned by plastic and reconstructive surgeons. Conclusion: Liver and peritoneum are usual metastatic sites for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. To the best of our knowledge, metastasis of ileal gastrointestinal stromal tumor to the mandible has not been previously reported in the English literature. Objective: Warthin's tumor is the second most common neoplasm of the parotid gland accounting for 6-30% of parotid neoplasms. However, parotid gland is an extremely rare site for extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

Method: A study has been carried out for 7 years on 184 cases of salivary gland tumors, and only one case of salivary metastatic lesion was diagnosed. A 79-year-old female with a history of a right temporal malignant melanoma was admitted at the Plastic Surgery Department of County Hospital of Timisoara. Sixmonths after the surgery, the patient returned to this clinic with a rapidly growing mass in the right temporal region and right preauricular region. A 2 \u00d7 2-cm diameter tumor was excised with adjacent lymph nodes. A superficial parotidectomy was performed also, preserving the facial nerve and its branches. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were cut at 4 \u03bcm and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Results: On HE stain, the periparotid and temporal region lymph nodes were infiltrated by malignant melanoma cells. The parotid tissue also had metastatic lesions. The metastatic malignant melanoma lesion consisted of epithelioid neoplastic cells with cytologic and nuclear atypia, large nucleoli, atypic mitotic figures and abundant melanin pigmentation. Necrosis and hemorrhage were also seen. Conclusion: The parotid gland and its lymph nodes are possible sites of metastasis from head and neck tumors, especially squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The rarity of salivary secondary tumors prompted us to report this case. Objective: Primary intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the jaws is a rare lesion accounting for <5% of all mucoepidermoid carcinomas reported in the literature. It is a neoplasm of adult life and affects females twice more frequently than males. Histologically, it is a low-grade carcinoma usually affecting the mandible. The radiologic presentation is that of uni-or multilocular lesions. Their origin still remains controversial. Method: We report the case of a 66-year-old female who presented with a painful swelling in the left maxilla of 2 month's duration. There was no history of previous surgical intervention.

The study aimed to evaluate and compare MMP-2, MMP-9 and KAI1 expression in primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) and adjacent marginal normal squamous cell epithelium and to estimate their association with each other in relation to clinical variables. Method: MMP-2, MMP-9, and KAI1 expression was evaluated on primary OSCC (n=54) and adjacent marginal normal tissues (n=32) using immunohistochemistry. Results: Significant differences between MMP-9 and KAI1 expression was found in OSCC and marginal normal tissue (P=0.01, P=0.001, respectively). In normal tissue, MMP-2, MMP-9 expression was found in basal cell layers and also frequently was observed in stromal tissues with inflammatory component. KAI1 protein was not observed in stromal tissues. No significant differences were observed between MMP-2, MMP-9, KAI1 expression and tumour grade and stage. Inverse correlation between MMP-2 and KAI1 expression was found in OSCC (P=0.006). KAI1-negatve/ MMP-2-positive cases were observed mainly in high tumour grade and in advanced stage of tumours. Conclusion: Inverse correlation revealed between KAI1 protein and MMP-2 expression in OSCC could affect the function of KAI1 suppressor protein and influence the metastatic potential of the tumour cells. Our results suggest that accumulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the surrounding tissue may enhance local invasion in OSCC.",

The aim of this study was to investigate two newly discovered factors (MMP-2 and PTEN) in LSCC patients with correlation to the stage of the disease. Method: We used 41 specimens from surgical resections selected from 25 patients and divided into controls (12 samples) and LSCC (29 samples). We used standard immunohistochemistry for MMP-2 and PTEN expression studies with EnVision system and DAB as a chromogen. Antigen expression was classified as followed: 0-no positive cells, 1-<10%, 2-10-50%, 3-above 80% positive cells. All results were statistically evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test and ANOVA, with statistical significance at p<0.05. Results: In patients with LSCC, the expression PTEN was detected in the cytoplasm of 20% tumor cells and 30% stromal area (p<0.05) while in controls only in 5% of stromal area (p<0.05 vs LSCC). PTEN expression was decreased in tumor cells in N+ vs N0 cases (10% vs 30%). In LSCC, MMP-2 was found in 3.5% of the tumor cells, but in 45% of stromal area (p<0.05). There was no MMP-2 expression in controls, while expression level (0-3 scale) was higher in tumor cells versus stromal compartment. MMP-2 stromal expression in N0 and N+ cases was 50% versus 38% of the area, respectively. Conclusion: We might conclude that decreased PTEN expression in tumor cells predicts lymph node involvement, which then is accompanied by decreased expression of MMP-2 in stromal area in the main lesion.",

Our objective was to establish mucosal LCNEC (mLCNEC) as a new entity in the head and neck regions. Method: We reestimated 814 surgically resected specimens of the primary mucosal carcinoma in the head and neck regions, including 24 basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, during 2002-2009. The immunostainings for neuroendocrine (NE) markers such as CD56, chromogranin-A and synaptophysin were performed. In the cases which were positive for two or three NE markers, we re-diagnosed as \"mLCNEC\". Results: Only eight cases (0.98%) were re-diagnosed as mLCNEC. All cases were male and their mean age was 64.6 years. Three cases occurred in the tongue base, four cases in the larynx and one case in hypopharynx. Although seven cases showed numerous regional lymph node metastases, only one case showed death of disease. Histologically, mLCNEC showed the sheet-like, trabecular, organoid pattern growth of relatively large basaloid cells in which the central necrosis, rosette formation, peripheral palisading, and high mitotic figures were sometimes seen. Immunohistochemically, mLCNEC indicated to be positive for two or three NE markers. Only three cases of mLCNEC were immunopositive for TTF-1, whereas all cases except one case were only focally immunopositive for p63. All cases showed high proliferating activity. Conclusion: We propose that mLCNEC can occur in the head and neck regions and is a new clinicopathological entity. The prognosis of mLCNEC remains unclear. Objective: Massive ovarian edema is an unusual cause of ovarian enlargement in young women. It is due to the accumulation of edema fluid and in some cases is associated with mature cystic teratoma. The patients are young (average 21 age), with present abdominal pain, menstrual abnormalities or evidence of hypergonadism. The ovarian enlargement is unilateral in 90% of cases. Method: We report a case of a 12-year-old girl with tumor of the left ovary. Grossly, the enlarged ovary's greatest dimension was 18 \u00d7 20 cm (1,900 g), composed of solid mass with large gelatinous and hemorrhagic foci. Paraffin sections from 20 samples were stained with HeEo and immunostained for vimentin, S100 protein, SMA, desmin and CD34. Results: Histological findings were identical in all slides. Ovarian stroma cells were scattered within abundant edematous fluid, and in some foci, hypocellular stroma surrounded follicles. In the cortex, follicles were dilated in fibromatous stroma with rare luteinized cells. CD34 confirmed the presence of many vessels with thrombi composed of fibrin-causing hemorrhagic necrosis. In some areas of necrosis, we found foci of dystrophic calcification suggesting an older process. Conclusion: Massive ovarian edema is a lesion which can be misdiagnosed as a neoplasm. The cause is unclear. It has been attributed to intermittent torsion of the ovarian pedicle and interference with its lymphatic drainage. The fibromatosis and massive edema represent two ends of the same disorder. Objective: Intimal fibroplasia is a variant of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a non-inflammatory and nonatherosclerotic arterial segmental disease, resulting in narrowing of the lumen. FMD of coronary arteries is a rare pathology associated with cardiac and sudden death occurring during infancy, childhood and young adulthood. Method: We describe the case of a female infant born prematurely (gestational age 33+4/7) presenting a mild supravalvular aortic stenosis associated with an atrial septal defect and cardiac valvular dysplasia. During the first weeks of life, she developed a progressive obstructive cardiomegaly and she died at day 55 of a cardiogenic shock.",

Results: Because of fetal hydrops and congenital anomalies found on prenatal ultrasound, a 23-week pregnancy was terminated to reveal a fetus with multiple rib gaps, dysmorphic facial features, prominent micrognathia, higharched palate, club feet, dysplastic organ of Corti, incomplete visceral rotation, pseudoglandular transformation of the pituitary gland, mucosal eosinophilia of the stomach and intestines, microcalcifications of liver, and extensive, diffuse, predominantly perivascular and not only periventricular brain calcifications. There was no laboratory evidence of intrauterine infection either clinically or by in situ hybridization. Conclusion: This case illustrates a not yet described pseudo-TORCH, congenital infection-like, presentation of the ccms with extensive brain calcifications and mucosal eosinophilia of the gastrointestinal tract. Extensive brain calcifications were described in other genetic syndromes such as Baraitser-Reardon syndrome, Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, and mitochondrial encephalopathies, but not the ccmc. Calcium metabolism can have genetic background in the ccms and explain cerebral dysfunction in at least a subset of the syndrome. Objective: Alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD) with or without misalignment of pulmonary veins (MPV) is an uncommon congenital cause of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn characterized by a lack of alveolar and vascular development. Most are sporadic, but familial ACD/MPV has been reported, linked to the gene FOXF1 on chromosome 16 q24.1-q24.2. It is universally fatal and diagnosis is entirely dependent on the pathological examination of surgical lung biopsy specimen. Four cases of ACD, three with MPV, are reported. Method: The four neonates were full term, without associated congenital anomalies. They were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit for hypoxia and severe pulmonary hypertension unresponsive to maximal cardiorespiratory support, including high-frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Results: Surgical lung biopsies performed in three cases and postmortem lung examination in one case showed pathological findings of ACD, characterized by poor capillary apposition and density and medial arterial hypertrophy. These lesions were associated with misalignment of pulmonary veins in three cases. The four infants died of refractory hypoxemia during the first 2 months of life. Conclusion: These observations emphasize the importance of considering ACD with or without MPV in all newborn infants who present a persisting severe pulmonary hypertension without anatomical cause. Histological diagnosis based on early surgical lung biopsy may prevent from using costly, invasive and ineffective treatments and procedures such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",

We found a complex cardiac malformation, unilobular lungs, dysmorphic liver and spleen, malrotated and doubled right kidneys, and an aplasia of the left kidney. The parenchymatous organs showed inconspicuous histomorphological architecture. In the cerebrum, no corpus callosum was found and immature neuronal rosettes in both optical nerves were detected. Xray showed vertebral clefts, a slight hypertelorism, skeletal dysplasias of both hands, and confluent frontal and occipital fontanelles. Cytogenetics turned out a complete trisomy 9 (GTG-Banding). Conclusion: We present radiological, autoptic and cytogentic findings in a case of a very rare chromosomal aberration which mostly occurs as a mosaic or partial trisomy 9. This chromosomal abnormality usually induces early abortion. Therefore, a fetus with trisomy 9 and a gestational age of 22+2 weeks is very uncommon. We found multiple malformations of the skeleton and organs, mostly located in the midline.",

Objective: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), a rare tumor arising during fetal lung development, can be part of an inherited cancer syndrome. About 20% of children with PPB have a family history of cystic nephroma and rhabdomyosarcoma. It is related to DICER 1 mutations on 14q32 and consists in malignant mesenchymal cells and cysts lined by benign epithelium. Method: We report our experience in a paediatric pathology center. Two girls of 1 and 39 months presented pulmonary lesions, the first purely cystic and the second purely solid, corresponding histologically to early type I and type III PPBs. Results: The first patient underwent an upper lobectomy with an unremarkable postoperative outcome. The second patient presented a thoracic relapse 3 years after initial treatment consisting in upper lobectomy, pre-and postoperative chemotherapy. Tumoral karyotype revealed complex clonal chromosomal aberrations, dominated by interstitial 14q32, 7q22 deletion and trisomy 8. No familial history of neoplasia. She is disease-free 14 years after presentation. Conclusion: PPB must be taken into account in the evaluation of cystic and even solid pulmonary lesions in children under 6 years. A correct histologic diagnosis is needed to identify early PPB, which may be difficult to differentiate from congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), to appropriately manage patients and to identify an inherited predisposition to PPB. Recent data showed that DICER1 on 14q32, a gene implicated in miRNA synthesis, plays a crucial role in lung development.",

Results: PI Ki67 ranging 0-72% (median 18%) and TOPO2a ranging 0-58% (median 20%) were lower in children older than 18 months (>18 m, p=0.0002 and p=0.01, respectively). The two markers were strongly interrelated (r=0.83). Higher Ki-67 and TOPO2a correlated with higher MKI and adrenal location and inversely with increasing tumor differentiation. The cutoff values of PI Ki67 \u2265 30% and TOPO2a \u2265 25% correlated with fatal outcome of the disease. In the subgroup of patients, >18 m significant correlations between higher values of both PI markers and metastatic stage, unfavorable histology, high MKI, MYCN amplification, and adrenal localization were observed. At cutoffs Ki67 \u2265 10% and TOPO2a \u2265 25%, the markers predicted long-term unfavorable outcome by Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Cox regression analysis indentified PI (assessed jointly as Ki67 \u2265 10% + TOPO2a \u2265 25%) as the independent prognostic factor. Conclusion: Ki67 and TOPO2a PI markers have prognostic significance and clinicopathological correlations in NB. We propose to include PI to the standard histological assessment protocol of NB tumors.

In respect to symptomatic improvement, persistence of the bacterium was demonstrated in the following performed gastric and duodenal biopsies. Immunohistochemistry in previous ileal and bowel specimens was positive in the ileum. Conclusion: In WD, the macrophages seem to be of central importance in the development of the disease. This infection shares with CD the pathogenetic hypothesis that a defect in cellular immune response contributes to the development of the disorder. Evidences also suggest that bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of CD. This case strengthens the immunological hypothesis in the pathogenesis of the disorders. The functional defect of the macrophages caused by WD can explain the amazing number of granulomas in Crohn's-affected specimens. The double immunological defect due to CD and CD may contribute to the lack of eradication of the bacteria.

In 2002, an international group of pathologist, nephrologists and rheumatologists formulated a new classification of LN in order to standardize definitions and improve diagnostic procedures. This review will focus on the most recent, widely practiced classification, the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 Classification of Lupus Nephritis, which includes various changes from predecessors. Results: Histological prognostic factors proposed in LN including ISN/RPS 2003 Classification, Activity (AI) and Chronicity (CI) indices may not be sufficient to predict renal failure progression and response to therapy. New markers of glomerular and interstitial response to injury and renal scaring progression, such as \u03b1-SMA, PGM1 (CD68), E-cadherin, collagen IV, caspase-3, Bcl-2 and p53, can become new prognostic factors for LN. Conclusion: The lecture will be devoted to the revision and reappraisal of a new classification of LN and the potential role and predictive ability of new markers. 003 The Oxford classification of IgA nephropathy: a review based on the Polish renal biopsy registry A.

Secara *UMF Carol Davila, Dept. of Pathological Anatomy, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: It is generally believed that hyperoestrogenic status is one of the most important etiopathogenic factors of premalignant and malignant lesions of endometrium. This study characterises the association between the presence of premalignant and malignant lesions and other benign clinicopathological manifestations of hyperoestrogenism in the genital area. Method: The study comprised 83 resection specimens that were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The sections were marked with standard and special stainings (ER, PGR, Ki-67, PTEN). Results: The study group included women with ages between 39 and 67 years. From a total of 83 hysterectomies, 25 presented both histological evidence of premalignant or malignant endometrial lesions and other associated lesions: endometrial (4), endocervical (2) polyps, leiomyoma (16), adenomyosis (4), ovarian cysts (10). Conclusion: In conclusion, the altered expression of oestrogenic status reflects the pathogenic mechanisms of endometrial neoplasia. Assessment of these histopathological patterns may be a useful clinical and prognostic tool for the follow-up of women with predisposition for neoplastic lesions of the endometrium.0185Uterine (subendometrial) schwannoma M.

Giardiello, J. Offerhaus *UMCU Utrecht, Dept. of Pathology, The NetherlandsObjective: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, mucocutaneous melanin pigmentation and an increased risk of cancer at a relatively young age. Inactivation of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 is the underlying germline defect in PJS patients. Cases of sporadic PJ polyps have been reported. It has been stated that these polyps are extremely rare and that the fact that no molecular data were found to support the PJS diagnosis is only due to failing techniques. Method: We aimed to identify the molecular defect in six sporadic PJ patients. These patients are characterized by the presence of a distinct PJS polyp and most importantly the presence of arborizing smooth muscle. On these six, patients we performed LKB1 germline analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect exon deletions and amplifications. Results: One-point mutation and two high-level amplifications of the LKB1 promoter were identified. Interestingly, this amplification was identified in an additional four PJS patients. To study the effect of this amplification on gene and protein expression, we performed a RT-PCR and WB in two patients. A significant reduction of LKB1 expression was found when PJS polyp, and normal tissue was compared to a panel of normal colon samples. Conclusion: These results show that polyps that were based on histology sporadic PJ polyps are indeed PJS polyps, and these patients should be monitored accordingly. Interestingly, amplification of the LKB1 promoter resulted in decreased protein expression. The exact mechanism leading to this reduction remains to be determined.007Epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor expression predicts poor survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma A. Witkiewicz*, C. Solomides, B. Freydin, C. Martin, S. Singh, C. Yeo, S. Peiper *Thomas Jefferson University, Dept. of Pathology, Philadelphia, USA Objective: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by poor prognosis without effective treat-ment strategies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine are approved for the treatment of PDA, and there is an urgent need to identify patients who are likely to respond to targeted therapies. In this study, we evaluated the expression of EGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) in PDA and correlated it with survival and clinicopathologic variables. Method: Ninety-eight cases of PDA were included in the study. Representative sections were stained with anti-EGFR and anti IGF-1R antibodies (Ventana, Tucson, 1R gene copy number was evaluated by automated dual chromogen in situ hybridization (ISH, Ventana, USA). For ISH, chromosome 15 (red signal) and IGF-1R (black signal) were counted in 50 cells. Association between EGFR and IGF-1R expression and pathologic variables was analyzed using Fisher's, Wilcoxon and log-rank tests. Results: Expression of IGF-1R protein correlated with gene amplification by ISH. Significant association was observed between the presence of lymph node metastasis and high EGFR expression (p = 0.038). Univariately significant predictors of the overall survival included EGFR, IGF-1R, lymph node status and tumor size. In multivariate model, high EGFR expression was the strongest predictor of poor survival. Conclusion: EGFR and IGF-1R expression are important for PDA aggressiveness. The relationship between two receptors may have therapeutic implications.008 Expression of podoplanin, vascular endothelial growth factor C and D in esophageal cancer M. Kozlowski*, L. Chyczewski, M.

Method: Twenty-one EATL patients were reevaluated for tumor type, stage, general performance, nutritional status, and survival. Immunophenotyping included CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD30, CD43, CD56, CD11c, CD123, MUM1/ IRF4, TCRalfa/beta, TCRgamma/delta, Ki-67, TIA-1, granzyme-B and perforin. The statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and Cochrane-Cox model. Results: A partial or complete loss of CD3 antigen was observed in 7 of 21 cases. Three lymphomas were of the alpha/beta and three of the gamma/delta TCR type, while 14 lacked TCR chains. TIA-1 was detected in 21 of 21, perforin in 16 of 21 and granzyme B in 13 of 21. MUM1/ IRF4 (9/21) was significantly associated with an anaplastic or immunoblastic morphology (p=0.023). Dendritic cells were abundant in all specimens. A significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) was observed in patients with lower stage (I+II vs. IV, p=0.02) and type I EATL (p=0.02), with a trend for longer OS in patients in good general performance (p=0.096) and nutritional status (p=0.12). Conclusion: Tumor stage and histological type were prognostically relevant for our EATL patients. An aberrant T cell phenotype with loss of CD 3 and TCR chains was frequent in the consistently TIA-1 + tumors. MUM-1/IRF4 may be a promising therapeutical target for a subset of EATL.004Fatal case of Epstein-Barr virus primo-infection, haemophagocytic syndrome in a 26-year-old patient treated with azathioprine for Crohn's disease: an autopsy case S. Smolders*, S. Rotman, L. de Leval *Universitary Hospital Lausanne, Dept. of Pathology, SwitzerlandObjective: A 26-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease, treated with azathioprine since 2 years, presented an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primo-infection and exacerbation of digestive symptoms. Method: An ileo-colectomy was performed, which showed a fatal EBV lymphoproliferation disorder along with a haemophagocytic syndrome. EBV DNA load in the peripheral blood persisted to be high loaded during hospitalisation (479,000 copies per milliliter) despite triple antiviral treatment. Results: Autopsy revealed a systemic lymphoproliferation involving lymph nodes, gastrointestinal mucosa and solid viscera (heart, kidney, lungs, prostate, brain). This was compounded of a population of large polymorphic B cell, hypertrophic macrophages and T lymphocytes, associated to haemophagocytosis. These massive infiltrations mimicked macroscopically as ulcers in the intestinal mucosa and ranged from polymorphic with plasmocytic differentiation to monomorphic large cells. Autopsy results confirmed the absence of Crohn's disease reactivation. The EBV infection was observed in all organs within the large images of the B cell lymphoproliferations. Further postmortem investigations revealed a deficit of the azathioprine's metabolisation enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Conclusion: We report and discuss herein the observations of a complete autopsy case along with the postmortem identification of the EBV infection type and TPMT mutation in a patient treated by azathioprine for Crohn's disease. Autopsy findings and further investigations helped explain the complicate clinical evolution and the fatal issue of the patient.005 Autophagy and its regulation in neuroblastoma H. Sartelet*, T. Inbriglio, C. Nyalendo, C. Barelli, S. Cournoyer, P. Teira, M. Duval, G. Vassal *CHU Sainte Justine, Dept. of Pathology, Montreal, CanadaObjective: Neuroblastoma (NB) is a frequent paediatric tumour. Despite high dose of chemotherapy, metastatic tumours have poor outcome. Autophagy is a cellular selfdegradative process adapting to stress. By suppressing altered organelles by the intermediate of autophagosomes, autophagy maintains cell survival, but can play a role in programmed non-apoptotic cell death. In cancer, autophagy has an important function, but still controversial. The aim of this study was to determine if autophagy is present and could be regulated in NB. Method: Five tissue microarrays containing 184 NBs were studied. An immunohistochemistry method was used to identify the expression of LC3, a specific autophagosome marker, and beclin 1, a positive regulator of autophagy. In addition, four NB cell lines were treated in vitro with six drugs (temozolomide, LY294002, rapamycin, vincristin, doxorubicin and cisplatin). Cell survival was measured by MTT cell proliferation assay. The autophagic vacuoles were labelled with monodansylcadaverine, and the result was measured by the intensity of fluorescence. Autophagosome formation was monitored by immunodetection of LC3 cleavage and beclin 1. Results: Low levels of autophagy are present in a majority of NB, but the autophagy level (expression of LC3) does not represent a prognostic factor. In contrast, higher levels of beclin 1 were detected in NB with poor prognostic. In vitro, autophagy is inversely proportional to cell survival when neuroblasts are in contact with NB's classic chemotherapeutic agents and AKT path inhibitors. However, temozolomide induces autophagy without increasing cell death.Conclusion: Autophagy is present and could be modulated by chemotherapy in NB. Popper*, K. Kerr, M. Filipits, F. Herth, D. Grunenwald, R. Stahel, M. Dietel, E. Smit, R. Pirker *Medical University of Graz, Institute of Pathology, AustriaObjective: Gefitinib has received European approval for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. In Europe, EGFR mutation testing is not well established, preventing access to new targeted therapies for NSCLC.Method: An IASLC-ETOP European multidisciplinary workshop developed recommendations to facilitate the implementation of standardized EGFR mutation testing in routine practice. Results: The treating physician requests EGFR mutation testing. The results should be available within seven working days. All patients with NSCLC may be tested, but exceptions can be made for carcinoids, squamous, large cell neuroendocrine, and mucinous adenocarcinomasthere is a low likelihood of mutations. No consensus agreement was achieved for prescreening algorithms, although non-mucinous adenocarcinomas most likely harbor an increased percentage of mutations. For diagnosis, the most accessible tissue is sampled; re-biopsy at recurrence or disease progression should be considered. More data on the potential heterogeneity between different biopsy sites are required. The use of cytology samples needs to be evaluated. Tumor cell enrichment of samples is often required, depending on the test used. The tumorto-normal cell ratio is important, although the minimum tumor cell number is ill defined. No standard method exists to detect EGFR mutations. Some evaluate the known activating mutations; others detect all mutations. New mutations might be difficult to interpret since activation status of the receptor has been defined for the most common ones.Conclusion: The pathologic report should contain tumor histology, sample size/quality, tumor cell percentage, methodology used for EGFR mutations, exons tested and mutations present/absent.",

Number of TANs correlated with shorter OS (P=0.05), DSS (P=0.002) and DFS (P=0.05) of patients, independently of other prognostic factors. Conclusion: The presence of TANs is a new independent prognostic factor for short disease-free, overall and cancerspecific survival in early stage NSCLC. small cell lung carcinoma patients using both the CellSearch method and the blood neutrophil count V. Hofman*, M. Ilie, C. Butori, C. Marquette, N. V\u00e9nissac, J. Mouroux, P. Hofman *CHU de Nice, LPCE, FranceObjective: Neutrophils within the tumor microenvironment, so-called tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), facilitate angiogenesis, extracellular matrix breakdown and remodeling, and promote tumor cell motility. Recent studies reveal that direct communication between neutrophils and tumor cells leads to invasion and egress of tumor cells into the blood vessels. Moreover, cytokines present in blood circulation might physically link cancer cells to TANs, allowing them to travel together throughout the circulation. This study was conducted in order to correlate the presence and number of circulating tumor cells detected in resectable non-small cell lung carcinoma patients and the neutrophil blood counts evaluated at the same time. Method: One hundred eighty consecutive patients who underwent surgery for NSCLC were included. CTCs have been detected and quantified using the CellSearch assay and the CellSearch Epithelial Cell Kit (Veridex). Results of CTC enumeration were expressed as the number of positive cells per 7.5 ml of blood. At the same time, blood neutrophils were counted and values were compared to the CTCs counts for each patient. Results: Among NSCLC patients, 52% have CTCs preoperatively detected (range between 1 and 25 CTCs). Sixty-five of 180 patients have more than 10.000 neutrophils/mm 3 . Among these patients, CTCs were found correlated with high levels of blood neutrophils in 75% of cases (p=0.05).Conclusion: This preliminary study shows that CTCs (presence and number) are strongly associated with higher levels of blood neutrophils in NSCLC patients undergoing surgery. These results open new avenues in our understanding of CTC migration, outcome, and survival.004Mutations and copy number of EGFR in mixed type of pulmonary adenocarcinoma L. Carvalho*, M. Silva, P. Couceiro, A. Alarc\u00e3o, M. J. Aguiar, L. Teixeira, V. Sousa *Faculdade de Medicina Coimbra, Dept. de Anatomia Patologica, PortugalObjective: The EGFR genes act in the MAPK signaling pathway. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations are more sensitive to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The different patterns recognized in adenocarcinomas were microdissected to identify mutations in EGFR and gene copy number in order to clarify their significance when selecting patients either to TKIs to be translated to small biopsies. Method: Histological sections of 40 mixed-type adenocarcinomas from surgical specimens of the lung FFPE and were submitted to FISH by application of the probe LSI EGFR/CEP 7. Thirty-one samples were studied for EGFR exons 19 and 21 mutations by fragment analysis and by direct sequencing, respectively. Results: FISH-positive was found in nine cases, two with amplification and one with high polysomy, by Cappuzzo's score; in one case, there were different results in the present patterns. In the 31 samples, 10 of 31 showed in-frame deletions and 4 of 20 L858R substitution in the EGFR. Only one mixed adenocarcinoma showed EGFR in-frame deletions in bronchioloalveolar pattern and Wt in acinar pattern. Conclusion: In this set of mixed-type adenocarcinomas, the different histological patterns revealed to be inconsequent for EGFR determination of mutations and gene copy number, reinforcing the technical feasibility and reliability of small biopsies of lung cancer to determine personalized therapy. Carvalho*, A. Alarc\u00e3o, M. J. Aguiar, S. Ventura, A. P\u00eago *Faculdade de Medicina Coimbra, Dept. de Anatomia Patologica, PortugalObjective: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for up to 13% of all newly diagnosed lung cancers. Chromo A isolated expression by neoplastic cells should be considered a prognostic factor of survival. Cases that express either Chromo A or CD56 have to be separated from cases expressing CD56 and Ki67 to delineate prognostic groups among SCLC patients, and therapy might be defined according to this profile.006 Combined inhibition of mTOR and EGFR yields synergistic cytotoxic and biochemical effects in atypical lung carcinoid and large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma cells Z. Bag\u00f3-Horv\u00e1th*, W. Sieghart, H. Hayden, D. Cejka, J. Werzowa, W. Berger, A. Lackner, M. Grusch, M. Filipits, K. Schmid *Medical University of Vienna, Clinical Institute, AustriaObjective: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are crucial targets in cancer therapy that control cell survival and proliferation. Combined inhibition of both pathways yielded synergistic effects in several human cancer cell lines. However, the impact of EGFR and mTOR expression and inhibition in neuroendocrine lung tumors (excluding SCLC) is unclear. Method: Cytotoxic effects of mTOR inhibitor everolimus and EGFR inhibitor erlotinib alone and in combination were tested using growth inhibition assays in NCI-H720 atypical lung carcinoid and SHP-77 large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma cells. Activation of EGFR and mTOR pathway members was analyzed by Western blotting. Cell cycle phase distribution was determined by FACS. To investigate the role of these pathways in neuroendocrine lung tumors, expression of the pathway constituents was assessed by immunohisto-chemistry in 110 tumor samples and correlated with survival of the patients. Results: Combination of erlotinib and everolimus yielded highly synergistic combination effects in both cell lines. Downregulation of phosphorylated mTOR, p70-S6 kinase and Akt expression by everolimus was potentiated by the addition of erlotinib, although erlotinib alone did not affect the expression of these proteins substantially. Additionally, combined treatment showed effects on cell cycle regulation and phase distribution. Activation of both pathways could be demonstrated in all tumor entities investigated; however, no correlation with disease-free or overall survival of the patients was observed. Conclusion: Due to these promising results, the effects of combined inhibition of mTOR by RAD001 and EGFR by erlotinib warrant further in vivo investigation in neuroendocrine lung tumors.007The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in malignant mesothelioma A.

Fassan *University of Padova, Dept. of Pathology, ItalyObjective: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is the tumor arising from the lining cells of the serosal cavities, microscopically characterized by epithelioid and/or sarcomatoid features. This supports the hypothesis that MM could be a suitable model to study in vivo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal shapes and properties but also invasive and metastatic abilities during tumor progression. Method: One hundred nine formalin-fixed paraffin-Results were evaluated by Student's t test and Kruskal-Wallis test.Results: IHC showed that vimentin (p=0.007) and \u03b1SMA (p=0.009) expressions were higher in sarcomatoid than in epithelioid MM, and S100A4 (p=0.046) was higher in biphasic than in epithelioid MM. At qRT-PCR, E-cadherin (p=0.001 and p=0.014) was expressed at lower levels, while N-cadherin (p=0.002 and p=0.002) was at higher levels in sarcomatoid than in epithelioid/biphasic MM. SNAI2 (p =0.001 and p = 0.001) was higher in both sarcomatoid and biphasic compared to epithelioid MM. TWIST1 (p=0.044 and p=0.011) expression was higher only in biphasic cases. Conclusion: MM can be considered a suitable model to study the EMT process in vivo. Indeed, EMT is involved in MM morphological spectrum of subtypes, but also plays a fundamental role in prognosis.Objective: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive lung disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by progressive fibrosis and inflammation. Pulmonary hypertension represents an important complication significantly influencing patient outcome. The contribution of viral infections in the development/progression of the disease is largely debated. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of different viral genomes in native lungs with IPF and to correlate these findings with different clinical, functional hemodynamic and morphological parameters. Method: Tissue samples from 52 native lungs of IPF patients requiring lung transplantation and from 20 controls were analysed by polymerase chain reaction to detect different viral genomes (Epstein-Barr virus; cytomegalovirus; human herpesviruses 6, 7, 8; adenovirus; rhinovirus; influenza viruses; parainfluenza viruses; parvovirus B19; metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus). Morphological parameters (fibrosis extension, muscular artery wall thickness and inflammation) were quantified using morphometry. Results: Higher frequency of virus-positive cases was detected in IPF patients than the control group (17/52 vs 1/20, p=0.01), and herpesviruses were the only detected genomes. Viral IPF cases showed increased values of mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mPAP (p=0.05), worse performance at the 6-m walking test (p=0.008), and were characterized by a higher thickening of muscular arteries (p=0.03). No significant correlations were found with other clinical and morphological data. Conclusion: Higher values of mPAP in viral cases may prospect a role of herpesviruses in the development of pulmonary hypertension. A more extensive vessel remodelling may be related to a well-known vessel tropism of herpesviruses.Wagrowska-Danilewicz*, A. Halon, K. Okon, A. Andrzejewska, A. Marszalek, W. Salwa-Zurawska, A. Korolczuk, H. Karkoszka, A. Mroz, M. Danilewicz, A. Perkowska-Ptasinska *Medical University of Lodz, Dept. of Nephropathology, Poland Objective: This is a report on the epidemiology of kidney diseases in Poland based on kidney biopsy databases from nine nephropathological centers. Method: All adult native kidney biopsy recognitions collected in the years 2002-2009 in Warsaw, Lodz, Cracow, Wroclaw, Bialystok, Bydgoszcz, Lublin, Poznan and Katowice were retrospectively analyzed for histological type of renal disease and demographic data. Biopsies were processed for light and immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy in some cases. Collection of data relating to renal biopsies in a national registry is a useful tool for nephrologists in that it meets one of the current challenges facing the clinical research enterprise. In Poland, the most common disease recognition upon kidney biopsy in adults is chronic glomerulonephritis with a domination of FSGS. Lupus nephritis predominates among secondary types of glomerulonephritis. This report constitutes the basis for the future Polish Registry of Renal Biopsies.

Fabre *The Copse, 4 College View, Dublin, IrelandObjective: Acute and chronic rejection is the main cause of graft dysfunction post-cardiac transplantation. Assessment of chronic rejection (cardiac allograft vasculopathy) may prove difficult on biopsies. 7%) was recorded. These changes were observed as early as on the first biopsy, with marked variability in the time from transplant to their first appearance (from 7 to 834 days). Eight of these developed post-transplant circulation anti-donor HLA antibodies. The rejection grade on biopsies with vascular changes was 0R-1R in 81%. Conclusion: Detection of donor-specific HLA antibodies as well as abnormal epimural vessel on biopsies might identify cardiac allograft vasculopathy and offer an opportunity for early clinical intervention and modification of immunosuppression.005 Expression of K + channel subunits in different human blood vessels J. Markovic-Lipkovski*, S. Cirovic, D. Mitrovic, S. Tatic, M. Peric, L. Gojkovic-Bukarica *University Medical School, Belgrade, Serbia and MontenegroObjective: We investigate some agents (glibenclamide and resveratrol) that can prevent spasm of human blood vessels used as a graft by anti-vasoconstrictor effect of the K + channel opener. Therefore, it is very interesting to know the distribution and localisation of different K + channel subunits. Method: In the present study, the cryostat sections of the human a. renalis, a. radialis, a. mammaria interna and v. saphena were used. Immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescent techniques were performed. For the analysis of expression of different K + channels, a panel of antibodies to intracellular epitopes of the C-terminal part produced in rabbits (Alomone Labs, Israel) was employed: anti-Kv1.2, anti-Kv1.3, anti-Kv1.6, anti-Kv2.1, anti-Kir6.1, anti-Kir6.2 and anti-Kca1.1. In some cases, double immunofluorescent technique with alpha-SMA antibody was applied. Results: V. saphena expressed only Kir6.2 subunits on the smooth muscle cells of the wall. Internal a. mammaria showed expression of Kir6.1 and Kir6.2. A. radialis showed variable positivity with Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kir6.1 and Kca1.1. Double immunofluorescent labeling with antibodies against Kv1.2 subunit and alpha-SMA revealed that Kv1.2 channel subunit is predominantly expressed in the perinuclear region of the myointimal cells and of the smooth muscle cells of the media of a. radialis. A. renalis predominantly expressed Kv1.3 channel in the endothelium. Interestingly, in few artery specimens with focal calcification or atherosclerotic plaque, we observed decreased expression of Kv1.2 channel subunit. Conclusion: Expression of K + channel subunits is different in various human blood vessels. 003 Locked nucleic acid-based PCR clamping method for the detection of KRAS mutations D. Hershkovitz*, H.

Sulewska*, W. Pankiewicz, W. Naumnik, J. Niklinski, M. Kozlowski, J. Kowalewska, L. Chyczewski *Medical University Bialystok, Dept. of Clinical Molecular Biology, PolandObjective: Bronchiolar columnar cell dysplasia (BCCD) has been proposed as a novel peripheral precancerous lesion of the lung adenocarcinoma. Hypermethylation of p16 gene occurs early during the development of squamous cell lung cancer. However, the role of gene hypermethylation during the development of adenocarcinoma remains unclear. The aim of our study was to estimate the expression of protein p16 and cellular marker for proliferation Ki-67 and to detect hypermethylation of p16 gene in BCCD. Method: The study material consisted of specimens obtained from 145 patients surgically treated for non-small cell lung cancer in the Clinic of Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Bialystok. BCCD was searched for in sections taken from uninvolved lung parenchyma. P16 and Ki-67 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of epigenetic changes was performed in 18 patients. Hypermethylation of p16 was examined by methylation-specific PCR. Results: BCCD was identified in 27 (18.6%) patients. BCCD was observed in patients surgically treated for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and large cell lung cancer (23.7%, 17.6%, and 10.2%, respectively). Loss of p16 was found in 78.9% of BCCD; cytoplasmatic expression of p16 was identified in 21.1% of cases. Expression of Ki-67 indicated moderate mitotic activity of epithelium in BCCD. Hypermethylation of the p16 gene was found in 12.5% of BCCD. Methylation of p16 gene was absent in normal epithelial lung tissues. Conclusion: Our study indicates that BCCD was seen in only 18.6% of patients with lung cancer. Loss of p16 protein and hypermethylation of p16 gene seen in BCCD points to the precancerous stage of this lesion.005 Ewing's sarcoma cells promote osteoclast formation R. Taylor*, F. Hemingway, H. Knowles, N. Athanasou *Merton College, Oxford, United KingdomObjective: Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a primary bone tumour associated with extensive bone destruction. To investigate the osteolysis in ES, we examined whether ES tumour cells directly resorb bone or whether they act to promote osteoclast formation and resorptive activity. Method: Several ES cell lines + macrophage colonystimulating factor (MCSF)-primed CD14 + monocytes were cultured on coverslips and dentine with MCSF + receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). Cultures were examined for the osteoclast formation markers tartrateresistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), CD51 and lacunar resorption. Release of organic matrix collagen fragments (CTX-1) was assayed by ELISA. Protein and RNA expression of osteoclastogenic factors in ES cells was investigated by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Results: Cultures of ES cell lines on dentine did not result in lacunar resorption or the release of CTX-1, but the formation of large TRAP + and CD51 + osteoclast-like multinucleated cells capable of lacunar resorption was seen in ES monocyte co-cultures. Expression of the osteoclastogenic factors, MCSF and RANKL, was identified in ES tissue sections and ES cell lines. Conclusion: Our results indicate that ES tumour cells do not directly resorb bone. ES cells express MCSF and RANKL, osteoclastogenic factors that are essential for osteoclast formation from mononuclear phagocytes. This RANKL-dependent mechanism is likely to contribute to the rapid, aggressive osteolysis of ES.",

Sz\u00e1sz *Semmelweis University, 2nd Dept. of Pathology, Budapest, HungaryBackground: To subtype estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinomas by retrospectively analysing the results of the routinely used immunohistochemical (IH) reactions and compare the findings to the recorded conventional prognostic factors. Method: Between 2000 and 2007, 1,415 invasive breast carcinomas were diagnosed histologically in the 2nd Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University Budapest. ER/PR, Ki67, Her2 status were recorded. Her2 score 2 cases were reevaluated by FISH. We evaluated the results in comparison with tumor type, grade, pTNM stage, vascular invasion. In 765 of 1,036 ER-positive breast cancer cases, we had complete set of data. Three groups were set: cases with Her2 \u2212 and low Ki67 index (<20%) status (A, 504 samples), Her2 \u2212 and high Ki67 index (\u226520%) status (B, 165 samples), and Her2 + status (C, 96 samples). We suggest that the latter two represent the genomic luminal B group of breast carcinomas. R 2.7.1 statistical programme was used. Value of p\u22640.05 was taken as significant. Results: Of the cases in group A, 68.7% were invasive ductal (IDC), whereas 18.8% were invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC). In groups B and C, IDC were diagnosed in 84% and 88% while ILC in 9.8% and 9.3%, respectively (p=0.0002). Forty-three percent of group A cases were grade 1, whereas in groups B and C, close to 40% of the tumors were grade 3; grade 1 tumors were found in 8% and 11.7%, respectively. In group A, 7.8% of tumors were grade 3 (p<0.0001). Vascular invasion was recorded in 28.3% of the cases in group A, while this was seen in 50.7% and 48.7% in the B and C groups, respectively (p= 0.0002). Least pT1 tumors were present in group B (44.5%). pT1 stage was recorded in 62.3% and 63.8% of groups A and C, respectively (p=0.0149). pN0 was found in 61.6% of the cases in group A, while only 39.5% and 45.4% of the cases in groups B and C were pN0, respectively (p=0.0360). Conclusion: According to the conventionally used prognostic factors, cases belonging to our group A of ERpositive breast carcinomas possess a favourable profile. Our groups B and C show similar prognostic features. We believe that routinely used protein profiling using a simple IH panel provides important information and may subdivide the group of ER-positive carcinomas, probably reflecting the genomic luminal subtypes (analysis of the follow-up data is in progress).

Sir, W. Domagala *Pomeranian Medical University, Dept. of Pathology, Gryfice, PolandObjective: The origin of vimentin expression in breast cancer tumor cells and its prognostic significance have been controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation between the expression of vimentin and immunophenotypic molecular classification of breast cancers. Method: Tissue microarrays containing 305 invasive ductal breast carcinomas from axillary node-negative patients were tested by means of immunohistochemistry for the expression of vimentin, ER, PR, HER2, EGFR, CK 5/6, CK14, CK17, p 63, P-cadherin. Results: A significant association was found between vimentin expression and immunophenotypic molecular classification (p<0.00001). Vimentin was expressed in 67% of basal-like, 17% of basal-like HER2 + , 14% of luminal B, 9% of luminal A, and 38% of unclassified carcinomas. Of 50 vimentin-positive tumors, 56% constituted basal-like, 24% luminal A, 8% basal-like HER2 + , 6% luminal B and 6% unclassified cancers. Sixty-four percent of triple-negative cancers expressed vimentin. Expression of vimentin was negatively associated with ER andConclusion: The results partially explain controversy in the literature concerning vimentin's prognostic significance and suggest three pathways of vimentin origin in cancer cells.

Surgical Pathology, ItalyObjective: Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67LI) has an important clinical relevance in breast cancer. It is extremely important to standardize its evaluation. Method: Three hundred fifteen consecutive breast cancer immunostained for Ki-67 (223 with SP6 (Labvision) and 92 with MM1 (Novocastra) antibodies) previously examined by an experienced pathologist have been reevaluated using Aperio Scanscope Xs. Results: Mean human Ki-67LI values were 35.91\u00b114.35% and 28.37\u00b118.29%, respectively, for SP6 and MM1 antibodies; mean CAM Ki-67LI values were 30.97\u00b119.19% and 22.12\u00b1 18.36%, respectively, for SP6 and MM1. Human and CAM evaluation are statistically highly correlated (Pearson, 0.859, p<0.0001), although human LI are systematically higher. Cases have been subdivided into three groups based on tertile distribution; cutoffs varied depending on the antibody used and on the evaluation methods: For human evaluation using SP6 and MM1, they were \u226430, 31-42, \u226543, and \u226420, 21-40, \u226541 respectively; for CAM evaluation, they were \u226419, 20-37, \u226538 and \u226412, 13-24, \u226525. Conclusion: Our study shows that (a) CAM can be easily adopted in routine; (b) human and CAM Ki-67LI are highly correlated; and (c) Ki-67LI grouping on the basis of tertiles obtained using different evaluation methods and different antibodies shows important differences in cutoff values, underscoring that it is not correct to adopt general cutoff values to subgroup cases without taking into consideration the evaluation methods and antibody used.0007 The antigen Ki-67: marker of the tumoral proliferation in the invasive mammary cancer and the connection with the classical prognostic factors A. Muresan*, E. Lazar, A. Dema, M. Cornianu, A. C. Faur, M. Grigoras, R. Cornea, C. Lazureanu, R. Cioroboreanu, I. Sargan *University of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Timisoara, RomaniaObjective: The Ki-67 antigen is a marker of the cell cycle and of the tumoral proliferation. Due to the immunohistochemical techniques, it can be easily emphasized. The Ki-67 antigen is largely used for the estimation of the proliferation coefficient of a mammary carcinoma. The Ki-67-positive cells percent is correlated with the aggressiveness parameters or with those of tumoral progression. Method: The studied tissue fragments from the studied carcinomas were fixed in formaldehyde 10%, included in paraffin and immunohistochemically colored using the monoclonal antibody MIB1. The positivism for Ki-67 was shown by the red coloring of the proliferating cells' nucleuses using DAB as chromogen. Results: Out of 72 studied mammary carcinomas, 52 (72.2%) overexpressed the Ki-67 antigen. We have observed a significant connection between the Ki-67 expression and the histopathologic degree of the mammary carcinomas; we did not see any connection between the Ki-67 and the patients' age, tumor size, histological type and the clinic stage of the disease. Conclusion: In mammary tumors, the presence of the Ki-67 antigen is considered as an unfavorable prognosis factor by rapid tumor increment, invasion and metastasis marker.",

Enache, F. Cionca, G. Butur, C. Ardeleanu *V. Babes National Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Stromal components are attributed an important role in modulating tumor progression from noninvasive to invasive stages. The interrelations between stroma and tumoral cells are not elucidated and currently elicit a special interest among researchers. The aim of our study was to identify possible markers that could characterize the ways in which stromal components relate to tumor cells in breast cancer in young women (age < 35 years). Method: Our study was performed on 30 ductal invasive breast carcinomas (age range = 23-35 years, M=33 years, SE=0.53) from the \"Victor Babes\" National Institute of Pathology. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were analyzed immunohistochemically using an indirect bistadial technique performed with a polymer-based detection system with antibodies for MMP9, COX2, CerbB2, estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors and for NF-kB. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test from the Analysis Tool Pak of Microsoft-Excel 2003. Results: We found significant statistical correlations between the immunohistochemical expressions of CerbB2, NF-kB and MMP9 in tumoral cells. CerbB2 strongly correlated with NF-kB and MMP9 in stromal cells (lymphocytes, fibroblasts), vascular structures and extracellular matrix, which varied proportionally with the histological grade. MMP9 was more expressed in stromal components, while NF-kB was more expressed in tumoral cells. COX2 expression in tumoral cells increased with histological grade and correlated with PR and with COX2 positivity in lymphocytes and mast cells. Conclusion: Our results indicate that MMP9, NF-kB and COX2 constitute reliable markers for stromal-tumoral cell intercommunication with possible implications in tumor progression, invasiveness and metastases.Objective: Proliferation factors have dominant prognostic value, but their independent value and reproducibility are largely unknown. The reproducibility of Ki67 was evaluated and its prognostic value compared with mitotic activity index (MAI), phosphohistone-3 (PPH3) and other variables. Method: In 240 node-negative breast cancers, standardized immunohistochemistry was used for Ki-67 and PPH3 and a strictly formalized protocol for MAI assessment.

The patient underwent radical right orchiectomy. Standard and immunohistochemical stains were performed. Results: Gross examination revealed a 2-cm intraparenchymatous, well-circumscribed, pale yellow, solid and homogeneous tumor. Microscopic examination showed a nested or trabecular architecture associated with tubular and papillary structures within a scarce stroma without necrosis. Tumor cells had an abundant cytoplasm, with regular, round or oval nuclei, moderate anisokaryosis and rare mitoses. Surrounding parenchyma was only slightly modified. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for cytokeratin (AE1\\\\AE3), chromogranin, synaptophysin and serotonin and negativity for inhibin, calretinin, PLAP and alpha-fetoprotein. Proliferation index (MIB1) was under 2% and p53 staining was negative. Conclusion: Primary testicular carcinoid is an extremely rare neoplasm whose histogenesis remains disputed. For a correct diagnosis, a metastatic carcinoid tumor from other site should be excluded in the first place. Evaluation of the prognostic value of peritumoral inflammatory response in patients with penile carcinoma A. F. Freitas-Rodrigues*, I. W. Cunha, G. C. Guimaraes, S. C. Zequi, A. Lopes, R. M. Rocha, F. A. Soares, J. Vassallo *Hospital do Cancer, Campinas-Sp, BrazilObjective: In spite of the low incidence in industrialized countries, penile carcinoma (PC) represents 2.1% of all malignancies among Brazilian men. Peritumoral immune response has been described to have influence in prognosis in some tumor types, but its role in PC has not yet been addressed. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate inflammatory infiltrate cell components and to evaluate its relationship with clinicopathological features in order to establish the prognostic value of immune response in patients with PC. Method: One hundred fifty-five patients diagnosed at our hospital, with a minimum 5-year follow-up were included in the study. Representative paraffin-embedded tissue was submitted to immunohistochemical evaluation using antibodies to CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD56, CD68, CD138, granzyme B, S100 protein, HLA-DR and FOX-P3. Results: Elevated plasma cell infiltrate detected by conventional morphology and CD138 correlated with more favorable event-free survival (p=0.04), indicating a protective mechanism of elevated plasma cell counts. However, when the presence of lymph node neoplastic infiltration was evaluated in a multivariate analysis, only this parameter remained as having prognostic value. Conclusion: It is concluded that the role of inflammatory response on prognosis is relevant, especially for CD138, but this importance does not prevail over the value of lymph node status.(Supported by FAPESP and CNPq). Unusual morphologies in adult epithelial kidney tumors C. M. Ardeleanu*, M. Mihai, B. Serbanescu, A. Iordache, R. Stoica, M. Lesaru, A. G. Mihaela Georgescu, S. Enache, V. Enache, F. Cionca, I. Sinescu *V. Babes National Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Light microscopic diagnosis of renal tumors using the World Health Organization (WHO) is often difficult due to variable histology. Six separate epithelial renal tumors with distinct morphologies are described in the present study. Method: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from patients diagnosed with renal tumors described on computed tomography and surgically treated in Fundeni Clinical Institute in the last 2 years were sectioned at 4 \u03bcm. The slides were stained with the usual hematoxylin&eosin staining for histological diagnosis. We selected cases with unusual morphologies for conventional epithelial parenchymal renal tumors on light microscopy; clear cell renal cell carcinomas with variable nuclear grading and pure non-epithelial kidney tumors were excluded. Immunohistochemical studies were performed in the Department of Pathology and Immunohistochemistry at \"Victor Babes\" National Institute. This work was supported by the Grant PNII no. 62089/2008. Results: The selected cases were classified as renal oncocytosis, collision renal tumor, metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma in clear cell renal carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma with partly sarcomatoid morphology and two unclassified renal cell carcinoma. Conclusion: The importance of recognizing renal tumors with unusual morphologic features lies in the potential diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic implications that accompany these particular types of renal tumors. Clinical and imaging data, tumor sampling and ancillary studies can be helpful in rendering the correct diagnosis. Mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney C. Comingle*, E. Demiralay, A. Y\u00fcksel, Y. Akman, H. \u00d6zdemir *Baskent University, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, TurkeyObjective: Mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney (MESTK) is a recently described rare neoplasm. Malignant transformation, recurrence and metastasis are rare; therefore, histopathological distinction from other renal neoplasms, especially from renal cell carcinoma, is important. Histologically, the tumor is composed of biphasic components, including cysts and tubules embedded in the spindle cell stroma. Method: We report a case of a MESTK in a 60-year-old woman who presented with an incidental renal mass but without any urinary complaints. Results: Clinical course is uneventful after 5 months. Conclusion: This is a unique case resulting in differential diagnosis which should be distinguished from malignant tumors of kidney.Primitive neuroectodermal tumor-a very unusual and highly aggressive tumor of the kidney A. Dema*, S. Taban, C. Lazureanu, E. Lazar, A. Muresan, M. Cornianu, V. Bucuras, R. Bardan, R. Herbeck, A. Vaduva *University of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Timisoara, Romania Objective: Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) occur predominantly in childhood in the central nervous system and soft tissue. PNET of the kidney are rare and highly aggressive tumors that can be mistaken for a variety of other small blue cells tumors. We present a rare case of kidney PNET in an adult with rapidly fatal outcome. Method: This case was of a 55-year-old patient who was hospitalized for a left renal tumor discovered during an ultrasound examination. On CT scan, a solid nonhomogeneous tumor with 15-cm maximum diameter was detected in the left kidney; there were also visualized enlarged hilar and paracaval lymph node masses which included the left renal vein. A left perifascial nephrectomy with adrenalectomy was performed. Results: On gross examination, the tumor presented as a large, lobulated, friable, grey-white mass with hemorrhagic foci which replaced most of the kidney. The tumor exhibited primitive undifferentiated round cell morphology on H&E-stained slides. Immunohistochemical study revealed positive reaction for vimentin, NSE and CD99, while CK (MNF116), EMA, LCA, CD20, CgA, CD34, desmin, actin were negative. Soon after surgery, bilateral pleurisy with secondary lung involvement images precipitates the fatal outcome of the patient. Conclusion: The occurrence of PNET in the kidney of an adult is very unusual, this case being the first diagnosed in our department in a period of 10 years. It confirms the advanced stage at presentation and the aggressive behavior of the renal PNET. For an accurate diagnosis, immunohistochemical reactions play an extremely important role. Synchronous appearance of carcinoma, adenoma and leiomyoma in kidney: a case report M.-M. Koumpanaki*, A. Baliaka, G.-C. Balis, A. Dimasis, F. Patakiouta *Theageneion Cancer Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Thessaloniki, Greece Objective: Papillary carcinomas comprise 10% of the renal cell carcinomas. The patients are usually middle-aged men. Papillary adenomas are often found in patients undergoing haemodialysis. Leiomyomas are benign mesenchymal neoplasms that are considered to arise from the renal capsule. Method: Sixmonths ago the patient, a 71-year-old woman, suffered from pneumonia and was hospitalised. After a few months, in a follow-up CT scan, a tumour was found on her right kidney and a nephrectomy was scheduled. Results: On cut sections, we found a well-circumscribed yellowish tumour, 4.5 cm in maximal diameter, a capsular, whitish, elastic nodule sized 0.5 cm, as well as a small, cystic-like formation. Microscopically, they corresponded with a papillary carcinoma type 1 with numerous foamy macrophages and calcifications, a papillary adenoma and a benign mesenchymal neoplasm, immunohistochemically identified as a leiomyoma. Conclusion: Papillary carcinomas can be bilateral or multifocal, usually in hereditary cases. Predictive factors are identical to the ones of clear cell carcinomas. Type 1 tumours with extensive necrosis, abundant macrophages and absence of a sarcomatoid dedifferentiation are associated with a better prognosis. The presence of adenomas or leiomyomas does not to seem to have an affect on the outcome. A year after the nephrectomy, the patient is alive and well. 0305 Renal angiomyolipoma associated with endometriosis A. Wittersheim*, S. Casnedi, S. Croce, C. Renard, L. Obringer, A.

Brunschvicg *Centre Hospitalier de Troyes, FranceObjective: A renal masse was found incidentally on imaging in a 30-year-old woman. It was classed as a Bosniak type III cyst. Method: Gross findings showed a 3.5 partially cystic, wellcircumscribed and tan-yellow renal tumor. Histologically, it contained cells having voluminous cytoplasm (ranging from eosinophilic granular to clear) arranged in sheets, nests, trabeculae, pseudoalveolar structures and papillae. There were no psammoma bodies. Diagnostic hypothesis: variant of multilocular RCC, papillary or chromophobe carcinoma? Results: Immunohistochemistry: CK7 \u2212 , VIM \u2212 , p504S + , HMB45/ MelanA focally + , CD10 focally + . Complementary study: TFB + . Our final diagnostic was: RCC with translocation, known as tumor associated with MiTF/ TFE family translocations, found mainly in young patients and children. In contrast to TFE3 (Xpll.2) translocation tumors, TFB-RCCs are extremely rare (12 cases published). They are characterized by a translocation between the \u03b1 gene at 11q12 and the first intron of the TFEB gene at 6p21. Translocation-associated RCCs are likely to be present at higher TNM stage. Our patient (pT1N0) presented no evidence of disease 1 year after resection. Conclusion: Literature analysis confirmed an increase in advanced stage presentation and a worse outcome in pediatric translocation (TFE3 + ) RCC compared with classic (TFE3 \u2212 ) RCC. Little is known about TFB RCC's behaviour. Taking into consideration a morphologic heterogeneity of these tumors and their supposed worse prognosis, a screening for translocations with consistent use of antibodies against TFE3 and TFB in all unusual cases of RCCs, regardless of patient age, however, especially in young patients, seems necessary to determine the true incidence of these tumors.PS-15 Poster Session Digestive Disease Pathology 0307Acute onset alendronate-induced esophageal ulcers: a case report C. Comingle*, H. \u00dc. \u00dcnal, E. Demiralay, G. T\u00fckenmez Demirci *Baskent University, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, TurkeyObjective: Alendronate sodium is used primarily in the treatment of osteoporosis. Severe esophageal injury has been reported as a rare adverse effect of alendronate. Method: We present a case of widespread longitudinal esophageal ulcers between 26 and 34 cms appearing within 8 h of oral alendronate treatment. A 46-year-old woman who had hypothyroidism began alendronate treatment for osteoporosis prevention. She presented with severe dysphagia and abdominal pain 8 h after taking the first pill. Upper endoscopy has been performed and biopsy samples from the esophageal ulcers have been taken. Histologically, epithelial infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils was seen and within leukocytic exudate fragments neutrophils and eosinophils were detected, suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction. No sign of organisms or a neoplasm was present. Results: Alendronate treatment was discontinued. After 2 weeks, repeat endoscopy showed marked improvement of esophageal ulcers.Conclusion: This is a unique case reporting acute onset alendronate-induced esophageal ulcers. CagA, CagA EPIYA motifs and histopathological features in gastric Helicobacter pylori infection S. Sarioglu*, M. Guvenir, O. Yilmaz, A. Olivares, C. G\u00f6nen, M. Soyturk, H. Ellidokuz, G. I. Perez Perez *Dokuz Eylul University, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, TurkeyObjective: The aim of the study was to identify carboxyl terminal regions of the CagA (EPIYA motifs) in Turkish Helicobacter pylori strains and compare cagA positivity and EPIYA motifs with demographic characteristics and histopathological findings in patients with dyspepsia. Method: Antrum and corpus biopsies from 124 patients with dyspepsia were evaluated by histopathology, rapid urease test (RUT) and culture. H. pylori cagA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products ranging from 370 to 570 bp were amplified and products purified by QIAquick PCR kit (Qiagen) and sent to Macrogen for sequencing.Results: Eighty-nine (71.8%) patients were H. pylori positive by at least two of the tests, including RUT, histopathology and culture. Thirty (48.4%) patients were colonized with cagA-positive strains from the 62 H. pylori culture-positive patients. We found significantly higher scores of inflammation of pits in antrum and corpus and atrophy in corpus in CagA-positive patients; there were no differences in relation with intestinal metaplasia and with inflammation of the lamina propria. Of the 30 CagA H. pylori strains, 21 (70%) had three EPIYA motifs (EPIYA-ABC) and seven (23.3%) had more than three EPIYA motifs (EPIYA-ABCC). However, no association was found between inflammation scores, intestinal metaplasia or atrophy with differences in the EPIYA motifs. We found two patients (6.7%) colonized with more than one strain (EPIYA ABC and ABCC) based on phylogenetic analysis and variation in cagA genotype. Conclusion: CagA positivity strongly correlated with gastric histopathological inflammation patterns, but there was no association with the number or type of EPIYA motifs.0310 Do gastric lymphoid infiltrates remain a challenge for pathologists?

Results: From these biopsies, 124 samples (0.9%) from 77 patients were ambiguous or lymphomatous. Thirty-four patients (44%) suffered from lymphoma with a predominance of MALT lymphoma (50%), as well as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (29%), mantle cell lymphoma (15%), Burkitt-like lymphoma (3%) and follicular lymphoma (3%). The remaining 43 patients were affected by Wotherspoon grade 2 to 4 gastritis, with a complete follow-up available for 17 (40%). Lymphoma was present in further biopsies in ). Hp was only observed in two of six lymphoma cases in the first biopsy. Conclusion: Wotherspoon grades 3 and 4 remain a challenge for pathologists. Clinical follow-up combined with histology and immunohistochemistry should be still considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis. Moreover, pathologists must keep in mind that aggressive lymphomas can also involve the stomach. Correa's model-comprehensive or partial explanation for carcinogenic process triggered by the Helicobacter pylori infection?S. Zurac*, G. Micu, F. Staniceanu, A. Bastian, E. Gramada, C. Popp, L. Nichita, D. Simeanu, M. Olariu, R. Mateescu, R. Voiosu *Colentina Universitary Hosp., Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: As a group 1 carcinogen for gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori (HP) was involved in many studies and researches focused on physiopathology and morphopathologic changes induced by this bacterium. We proposed to study the precancerous epithelial alteration in patients with HP chronic gastritis, their regression or progression after anti-infectious treatment. Method: The study included 3,069 gastric endoscopy biopsies performed between 2005 and 2009 in our hospital. Histopathologic diagnosis of these biopsies was made using Sydney criteria. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of HP: Group A included 1,414 HP-positive patients and group B included 1,653 HPnegative patients. We evaluated several histopathological parameters, correlating the degree of inflammation, atrophy, metaplasia, regenerative hyperplasia and dysplasia with the presence of HP. Results: Our study identifies an overall tendency towards regression of premalignant lesions of gastric epithelium after HP eradication, as well as an increasing number of patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer, thus consolidating the results of studies who foretell the significant decrease of gastric cancer mortality. These lesions are present years before becoming clinically manifest and consequently treatable. Conclusion: In respect to carcinogenic mechanisms, some of our results confirm the carcinogenic cascade triggered by the HP infection, as was proposed byCorrea et al. in 1975.   However, we obtained data leading to the idea that the \"precursor lesions\" could appear (and histopathologically evaluated) independent from one to the other, which seemed to be through other possible steps.Note: Zurac and Micu should be regarded as first authors with equal contribution. Intestinal metaplasia and cytokeratin 7/20 pattern of cardiac mucosa in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection M. Micev*, M. Cosic Micev, V. Todorovic, N. Drndarevic, I. Jovanovic, S. Djuranovic *Clinical Centre of Serbia, Dept. of Histopathology, Belgrade, Serbia and MontenegroObjective: Specialized Barrett-type intestinal metaplasia (SIM) seems to be a stronger risk factor for malignancy than non-Barrett cardiac intestinal metaplasia (CIM). The pathogenesis of SIM and that of CIM are thought to be associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and H. pylori infection, respectively, but are still controversial. Recent studies regarding the expression of cytokeratin CK7 and CK20 in intestinal metaplasia (IM) found at the gastroesophageal junction are conflicting, especially in regard to associated H. pylori infection. Method: We studied the expression of CK7 and CK20 on 45 biopsy specimens of gastric cardia from patients with H. pylori infection and histological evidence of IM (group 1) and 36 biopsy specimens from patients with H. pylori infection but without evidence of IM (group 2). The distinction between SIM (18/45 cases) and CIM (27/45 cases) was defined morphologically rather than by biopsy site. Results: On the intestinalized cardiac mucosa, most often we observed the so-called Barrett-type CK7/20 staining pattern consisting of band-like CK20 staining of the surface epithelium and superficial glands and moderate to strong CK7 staining of both superficial and deep glands, i.e. it was found in 12 of 18 cases of SIM, in 19 of 27 cases of CIM and in 23 of 36 cases of non-intestinalized cardiac mucosa or in 14.8%, 23.5% and 28.4% of patients, respectively. Conclusion: We have found no statistically significant differences in Barrett-type CK7/20 staining pattern between SIM and CIM as well as between intestinalized and nonintestinalized cardiac mucosa in patients with H. pylori infection.

There was no significant difference in survival between HER-2-positive and -negative tumors (p=0.454). Conclusion: HER-2 positivity rate observed in GC in patients from Lower Silesia is as high as in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical detection of HER-2 expression is neither a predictor of survival of patients with GC nor does it identify subgroups of patients at higher risk for recurrence of disease.

Results: MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was positive in 78 of 82 cases (95.1%). Seventy-two of 82 (87.8%) and 40 of 82 (48.8%) GC expressed TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, respectively. High expression of MMP-2 (p=0.047) and TIMP-2 (p=0.011) was associated with Lauren intestinal tumor type. High epithelial TIMP-2 expression was associated with distant metastases (p=0.036). High epithelial TIMP-2 expression was associated with shorter OS (p=0.025) and high epithelial MMP-2 with better survival (p=0.017). Conclusion: High epithelial TIMP-2 immunoreactivity is significantly associated with shorter survival and distant metastases. Epithelial MMP-2 overexpression identifies GC patients with better clinical outcome. Increased TIMP-2 expression reflects its crucial role in predicting the aggressive GC behavior.0318Expression of chemokine SDF-1a and its receptor CXCR4 is a marker for an unfavorable prognosis in gastric cancer J.-M. Kim*, D. Y. Jo, H. J. Lee *Chungnam National University, Dept. of Pathology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea Objective: To investigate the effects of the expression of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1\u03b1 and its receptor CXCR4 on the prognosis of human gastric cancer, the clinicopathological features and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. Method: The expression of SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 proteins were studied by immunohistochemistry in 221 specimens of primary gastric cancer. Results: The patients were categorized into three groups according to the expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1; high CXCR4/high SDF-1\u03b1, low CXCR4/low SDF-1\u03b1, and high CXCR4/low SDF-1\u03b1-low CXCR4/high SDF-1\u03b1. There were no significant differences in age, gender, histology, tumor location, lymphovascular invasion, or proportion of tumor size >5 cm between three groups. However, high CXCR4/high SDF-1\u03b1 tumors were significantly associated with invasion depth of the tumor (T status, P=0.001), lymph node involvement (N status, P=0.029), and higher stage III/IV (P=0.001) compared with low CXCR4/low SDF-1\u03b1 tumors and high CXCR4/low SDF-1\u03b1-low CXCR4/high SDF-1\u03b1 tumors. Furthermore, the patients with high CXCR4/high SDF-1\u03b1 expressions had worst prognosis (5-year survival rate, 26.7%; median, 2.2 years; range, 0.8-3.6 years), whereas patients who had low CXCR4/low SDF-1\u03b1 expressions showed the most favorable prognosis (5-year survival rate, 57%; median, not reached; log-rank test, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Thus, CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1 are considered to be useful prognostic factors in gastric cancer, and the combination of high CXCR4 protein expression with high SDF-1\u03b1 expression indicates a dismal prognosis.0321 HER2 amplification and overexpression in gastric cancer: analysis of subtype specificity and optimal detection methods C. Moelans*, A. N. Milne, F. H. Morsink, R. Sitarz, W. P. Polkowski, R. Maciejewski, P. J. van Diest, G. J. Offerhaus *UMC Utrecht, Dept. of Pathology, The NetherlandsObjective: The recent ToGA trial indicates that Herceptin is a new, effective, and well-tolerated treatment for HER2positive gastric cancer (GC). Current diagnostic methods to detect HER2 amplification and overexpression should be carefully evaluated. Furthermore, potential subpopulations of GC (intestinal vs diffuse, cardia vs distal, early-onset GC) should be evaluated for their frequency of amplification and overexpression. Method: Tissue microarray (TMA) blocks of 108 earlyonset GCs and 91 conventional GCs were stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC, Hercep test, DAKO) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH, SPoT-Light, Invitrogen). Results: Overall, there was 3% HER2 overexpression (5/ 199) and 5% (9/199) amplification. Furthermore, 1.5% of the patients showed a 2+ IHC score and 3.5% showed a low level CISH amplification. Early-onset GC showed a lower frequency of amplification/overexpression than conventional GC: no overexpression and 2% amplification versus 6% overexpression and 8% amplification. IHC and CISH showed 94% concordance. In 5 of 199 cases (2.5%), IHC showed clinically relevant heterogeneity not seen by CISH. Cardia tumors had more amplification and overexpression than distal tumors: 9% versus 3% and 7% versus 2%, respectively (NS). HER2 CISH showed more amplification in the intestinal type (7%) compared to the mixed (5%) and diffuse type (3%) GCs (p =0.03). A similar trend was seen for HER2 IHC and histology type (p =0.067). Conclusion: This study reports lower amplification and overexpression frequencies than previously described but confirms previous studies showing different frequencies depending on the type and localisation of the GC. There was a lower amplification and overexpression frequency in early-onset GC and a lower heterogeneity rate by CISH compared to IHC.

For statistical analysis, Fisher's exact test was used. Results: There were 33:39:10 cases with glandular, diffused and mixed histology, respectively, according to Lauren classification. Thirty-three localized in antral part and 49 in corpus or fundus. AMACR expression was present in 49 GC (59%). According to our results, the correlation of AMACR expression with the aforementioned parameters cannot be confirmed. Negative results might have been caused by low statistical power due to the limited number of patients. Therefore, its utility as prognostic factor needs further validation.0326 Concordance of HER2 dual-color, dual-hapten in situ hybridization (DDISH) with fluorescence in situ hybridization on gastric carcinoma I. Loftin*, R. Miller, A. McElhinny, P. Roche, M. Padilla, J. Ranger-Moore, P. Wu *Ventana Medial Systems, Molecular Probes, Tucson, AZ, USAObjective: It is well established that the HER2 gene, located on chromosome 17, is amplified in~30% of breast cancer patients. Determination of HER2 gene amplification and/or protein overexpression dictates the eligibility of patients for Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab) therapy, a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 and can significantly improve prognosis. Recent studies indicate that HER2 is overexpressed in a percentage of gastric cancers, and Herceptin also is a promising therapy for these patients. Thus, accurate diagnosis of HER2 status is required for breast and gastric patients. Here, a new fully automated, HER2/CHR17 dual-color, dual-hapten brightfield in situ hybridization method (DDISH) was compared with Dako HER2 FISH PharmDx Kit on gastric samples. Method: Two hundred five invasive gastric carcinoma cases were evaluated with DDISH and FISH. A HER2 repeatdepleted, dinitrophenyl (DNP)-labeled probe targeted the gene and was detected with silver in situ hybridization. A digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled chromosome 17 probe was detected by an alkaline phosphatase-driven Red ISH detection. All assay steps, from deparaffinization through counterstaining, were fully automated and required~12 h. HER2 SISH and CHR17 Red signals were enumerated using conventional light microscopy, the HER2/CHR17 ratio calculated, and the gene status compared to FISH. Results: Overall concordance between the HER2/chromosome 17 DDISH assay and FISH was 94.5%. Conclusion: The automated HER2 (DDISH) assay yielded excellent correlation with FISH. These data indicate that DDISH is a valuable diagnostic test for the determination of HER2 gene status in gastric carcinoma.0328 A rare case of pyloric obstruction due to Brunner's gland hyperplasia A.-M.

Rostami *UMF Gr T Popa Iasi, Dept. of Pathology, Romania Objective: Although the autoimmune process targets mainly the intestinal mucosa, coeliac disease (CD) present with a variety signs and symptoms affecting any organ or tissue. Aim: The aim was to assess the clinical behavior of coeliac disease in a secondary care setting in Iasi Romania. Method: From April 2002 to December 2009, 175 adults were screened for CD. Patients were referred because of malabsorption and classical gastrointestinal symptoms (chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss and iron deficiency anemia). The diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, serology including IgA EMA or IgA-tTGA and duodenal biopsy. Results of intestinal biopsy were classified according to the revised Marsh criteria 1999. Results: Of the 175 subjects suspected cases, 91 underwent small bowel biopsy and 55 of 91 serology. The most common clinical presentation was weight loss in 60 of 91 and chronic diarrhoea and anemia in 78 of 91. Histology revealed microscopic enteritis (Marsh 0-II) in 43 of 91 and macroscopic lesions (Marsh IIIa-IIIc) in 48 of 91, respectively. Conclusion: There are not many studies on the epidemiology, investigation or clinical behavior of CD in East European countries. Most of the cases in this study were diagnosed from 2005 onward, indicating increasing awareness on CD. Classical presentations were predominant and more prevalent compared to atypical forms of disease. This still may indicate a high threshold for performing serology and small bowel biopsies in cases with atypical presentations. Synchronous small intestinal inflammatory fibroid polyp and GIST M. L.

Sahakian *VA Healthcare System, West Haven, USA Objective: Colonic mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents 1-4% of malignant tumors of the GI tract. They are extremely difficult to diagnose due to the small sampling size, immune hyperplastic responses which may mimic lymphoma, and very early phase of neoplasia. Method: H&E-stained slides from 2007 were reevaluated. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stain for BCL1 (cyclin D1) was performed. H&E-stained slides and IHC stain for CD20, BCL1, CD5, kappa, lambda, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10, and CD23 were evaluated. Flow cytometry was done on bone marrow and lymph node biopsy. FISH study for t(11;14) (q13,q32) was done. Results: A 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in 2007 for a bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR). Colonoscopy showed rectal erythema thought to be preprelated. Random biopsies taken were signed out as colonic mucosal lymphoid aggregates and revised to MCL in situ upon reevaluation. In 2009, he was readmitted for BRBPR and a 10-lb weight loss, lower abdominal discomfort, fatigue and soaking night sweats. Colonoscopy displayed mucosal edema in cobblestone pattern with erythema, ulcerations and a mass-like appearance of folds which were biopsied and signed out as MCL. Conclusion: In situ MCL lymphoma is not a so wellrecognized entity, much less in the GI tract where it has never been described before. We emphasize the need to be aware of GI lymphomas in general, specifically a rare entity such as in situ MCL, knowing that this may represent a disease in progress. Undifferentiated carcinoma versus acromic melanoma of rectum-case reportA.-A. Nicolau*, M. Aschie, I. Poinareanu, A.-F. Mitroi, A. Chisoi, A. Iliesiu, G. Resul, J. Stanisici, M. Enciu, I. Aschie, A.-M. Cretu *Constanta, RomaniaObjective: Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement by malignant melanoma is predominantly metastatic. The concept of primary malignant melanoma of the GI tract has been validated for lesions involving the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and anorectum, (the most common site). The existence of primary melanoma of the large bowel is a controversial topic. Six cases of apparent primary colonic melanoma have been reported to date, two of which in the rectum. Method: A 65-year-old Caucasian man presented in emergency following a massive rectal bleeding. Rectal examination revealed an anterior fleshy mass situated 4 cm from the anal verge. The patient said he had been bleeding intermittently for 4 months but without any pain or change in bowel habit. Rigid sigmoidoscopy demonstrated a polypoid lesion at the anorectal angle. The surgical specimen was analyzed macroscopically and microscopically using routine and immunohistochemical staining. Dermatological and ophthalmological examinations revealed no evidence of a cutaneous or an ocular primary lesion. Results: Histopathologic examination on routine staining demonstrated undifferentiated malignant cells with pleomorphic nuclei and atypical mitosis, suggesting the possibility of an acromic melanoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. Immunostains for pancytokeratin, CEA and EMA were positive and showed negative reaction for HMB 45, S-100 and Melan-A, establishing the diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma. Conclusion: Malignant melanoma of the anorectum is an uncommon condition. An expeditious diagnosis and care within a multidisciplinary team can have an important bearing on prognosis. Morphologically, the differential diagnosis of melanoma includes undifferentiated carcinoma, GIST, clear cell sarcoma, and epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.",

Pre-tumour progression can be made visible by studying methylation patterns, or tags, in stem cells of the crypt where heterogeneity among these tags is a representation of a genetic drift and stem cell survival. Increased stem cell survival may be a predictive marker of an increased risk of neoplastic outgrowth. The objective of this study was to investigate potential biomarkers predictive of adenoma development; the focus lies on alterations in stem cell survival. Method: DNA was isolated from laser-microdissected crypts of normal colonic FAP tissue and age-matched controls. DNA was bisulphite converted and methylation tags were created by amplifying the CpG islands in the CSX gene. Sequence analysis of this pool of methylation tags allows characterisation of the heterogeneity among the different tags recovered from multiple stem cell pools. Results: The bisulphite treatment, with subsequent sequencing, showed a significantly (p=0.030) greater number of unique methylation tags for FAP patients (2.8 unique methylation tags) compared to control patients (2.1 unique methylation tags), which indicates enhanced stem cell survival.Conclusion: This increased stem cell survival supports the idea of pre-tumour progression since longer lived stem cells have the potential to gain more mutations with higher risk to develop into a carcinoma. Colonic carcinogenesis induced by 1NC and PCNA and p53 expression L. Carvalho*, A. Alarc\u00e3o, L. Teixeira, P. S\u00e1, N. Coelho, P. Barreto, K. Cavalcanti, A. Cabrita *Faculdade de Medicina Coimbra, Dept. de Anatomia Patologica, PortugalObjective: 1-Naphtyl N-methylcarbamate (1NC) is considered of low toxicity when applied according with the good practice rules. The evaluation of morphology and proliferation rates of experimentally induced adenocarcinomas by 1NC and DMH was tempted. Method: Thirty Wistar 8-week male rats were distributed into three groups (ten rats each) submitted to dimethylhydrazine (DMH) 15 mg/week during 8 weeks (group II), 1NC 60 mg/l in drinking water for 8 weeks (group III), and without manipulation (group I). Killed at the end of the 28\u00aa week, lesions were collected and FFPE, PCNA and p53 antibodies were applied to sections of all tumours by the streptavidin-biotin/HRP method. Results: In groups II and III, lesions were exophytic (2-4 cm), well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, except for one case 1NC-induced a moderately differentiated adenocarci-noma. Proliferation rate-PCNA was higher in group III (1NC-induced): six negative cases in group II against three negative cases in group III; the cutoff: + (<25% positive nuclei), ++ (25-75%) and +++ (>75%), demonstrating five cases ++ and +++ in group III and one case +++ in group II (as the other three cases were +). For p53 nuclear immunostaining, six were positive in 1NC-induced cases against four by DMH. Conclusion: Despite the small sample of this preliminary study, 1NC revealed to induce more aggressive adenocarcinomas with a higher proliferation rate when compared with the DMH, probably by apoptosis blockage. In general, macroscopic tumors were pediculated and developed from deep crypts where the functional stem cells pool is supposed to be.

Possible correlations of the K-ras gene mutational status in colorectal carcinoma C. M. Ardeleanu*, F. L. Cionca, G. Cardos, M. Mihai, A. G. Mihaela Georgescu, M. Stoicea, S. Enache, V. Enache, G. Butur *V. Babes National Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Gain-of-function K-ras point mutations, present in 20-40% of the colorectal carcinomas, maintain the active form of the ras p21 protein and lead to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-independent activation of intracellular signaling pathways, making the anti-EGFR tumor therapy ineffective. The aim of the present study was to identify possible correlations between the mutational status of the K-ras gene and the histopathological findings in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Method: We studied 34 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma (30) or liver metastases of colorectal adenocarcinoma (4; male/female, 19:15; age range, 34-87; average age 61). The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were analyzed using an indirect bistadial immunohistochemical (IHC) technique, performed with a Dako EnVision+ Dual Link System-HRP, with antibodies for the EGFR and the ras protein.

Kobayashi, H. Sugihara *Saiseikai Shiga Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Ritto, JapanObjective: We reported a case of the colonic choriocarcinoma, of which the accompanying intramucosal adenocarcinomatous area consisted of two components: One revealed normal supranuclear expression of MUC2, and the other revealed abnormal cytoplasmic expression of MUC2 and overexpression of p53 due to a point mutation in exon 5 of TP53. It is thus possible that overexpression of p53 is related to abnormal expression of MUC2 during progression of colonic choriocarcinoma. To investigate whether this relation is seen generally, we examined expressions of p53 and MUC2 in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Method: This study was based on the analysis of 31 surgically and endoscopically resected colorectal carcinomas. H&E and immunohistochemical stainings with the monoclonal antibodies p53, MUC2 and CDX2 were carried out. Results: All areas of 12 lesions and a part of two lesions revealed overexpression of p53 (45.2%). For CDX2, the nuclei of cancer cells were positive diffusely in 29 lesions and partially in one lesion. The remaining one lesion showed an abnormal, dot-like cytoplasmic staining pattern. For MUC2, cancer cells were negative or weakly positive in 28 lesions and abnormally positive in five lesions (16.1%). Three out of 31 lesions revealed not only overexpression of p53 but also abnormal expression of MUC2 (9.7%). Conclusion: In this study, colorectal adenocarcinomas with overexpression of p53 and abnormal expression of MUC2 were relatively rare. Therefore, such a pattern of p53 and MUC2 expressions may be specific to colonic choriocarcinoma, possibly related to the occurrence of a choriocarcinomatous component from the background adenocarcinoma. Mismatch repair proteins expression and BRAF V600E mutation analysis in a subset of CCR patients under 50 years A. Luevano* *Hospital Universitario, Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Monterrey, Mexico Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a worldwide common malignancy, with a rise over the last years. Fifteen percent of all CRC have microsatellite instability (MSI) due to alterations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Germline mutations occur in 5%. Sporadic MSI CRC (15%) have hypermethylated MLH-1 promoter. BRAF V600E mutation exclusively occurs in sporadic MSI CRC. Immunohistochemistry detects MSI cases with high concordance with microsatellite analysis.Objectives: The objective was to compare histopathology and patterns of expression of MMR proteins and BRAF V600E mutation in patients below and over 50 years old and determine if age is a risk factor for defective MMR protein expression and BRAF mutations. Methods: One hundred six patients <50 years were retrieved. Clinocopathological data were collected. MLH1 and MSH2 immunohistochemistry and BRAF RT-PCR mutation were performed in 48 <50 years and 48 patients >50 years as control group. Student's t test, \u03c7 2 and logistic regression analysis were carried out Results: Medullary and mucinous types were more frequent among young patients, intestinal type in older patients. No differences were noticed regarding clinicopathological stages between groups. MMRP expression was absent more frequently in <50 and MSH2 was negative in 13.8% of these patients. No BRAF mutations were detected on any group. Discussion: We found an association between young age and defective MMR expression (OR 4.28). MSH2 lack of expression is more frequently due to a germline mutation. The fact that none of our patients had BRAF mutation could be partly due to the small sample size or alternate V600E or K-ras mutations.0347Expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in primary and metastatic foci of colorectal carcinoma. Correlation with selected clinical and morphological parameters and the assessment of its prognostic value R. Peksa*, R. Rzepko, A. Nalecz, A. Zawrocki, W. Biernat *Medical University of Gdansk, Dept. of Patomorphology, PolandObjective: Colorectal carcinoma is the second most often diagnosed malignant neoplasm in Poland, being the second most common malignancy causing death among men and the third among women. Staging is one of the most important prognostic factors. Patients with tumor invading the whole thickness of bowel wall without lymph node metastases have 5-year survival rates between 70% and 80%. With additional lymph node metastases, the 5-year survival rate is much shorter, between 25% and 50%. Currently, the new prognostic factors such as adhesion molecule expression are extensively studied, which potentially may influence further treatment. Aims: (1) Comparative assessment of E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression in primary and metastatic foci of colorectal carcinoma and (2) correlation with selected clinical and morphological parameters, study of survival time and the assessment of its prognostic value.Method: One hundred twenty-nine patients after surgery with stage III (106) and IV (23) colorectal carcinoma were qualified to this investigation. The expression of the Ecadherin and beta-catenin was studied by immunohistochemistry in primary and metastatic foci.Results: E-cadherin was expressed in 60.5% while membranous staining of beta-catenin was reduced in 38.7% of primary tumors. In lymph nodes, 72.8% and 70.5% of metastatic tumors were positive for E-cadherin and membranous beta-catenin staining, respectively. Conclusion: E-cadherin expression was correlated with membranous beta-catenin expression in the primary tumor and in the lymph node metastases. Expression of E-cadherin correlates with the larger amount of neoplastic stroma. No correlation was found between survival time and the expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in primary and metastatic foci of colorectal carcinoma.0348 Comparison of transforming growth factor Beta 1 with GLUT-1 and bak in human colorectal cancers A. Wincewicz*, S. Sulkowski, M. Koda, M. Baltaziak, L. Kanczuga-Koda *Medical University Bialystok, Dept. of Pathology, PolandObjective: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a crucial agent in colorectal carcinogenesis which interferes in growth signaling pathways of intestinal cells and adjacent immune cells. We aimed to evaluate relations among TGF-beta1, a cytoprotective and hypoxia-induced protein-glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and proapoptotic protein Bak in human colorectal cancer. Method: Expressions of TGF-beta1, GLUT-1 and Bak were detected by immunohistochemistry in 108 primary tumors of colorectal cancers. Results: Immunoexpression of TGF-beta1 was observed both in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and adjacent inflammatory cells. GLUT-1 was visualized in membranous fashion and Bak was detected in the cytoplasm of malignant cells. Cancer immunoreactivities to TGF-beta1 correlated with GLUT-1 (p>0.001, r=0.355) and Bak (p= 0.001, r=0.320) in all patients and subgroups of different clinical and pathological traits. TGF-beta1 of immune cells failed to associate significantly with GLUT-1 and Bak expressions in cancer cells. Conclusion: The accumulation of TGF-beta1 cancer expression is associated with augmentation of apoptosis highlighted by Bak immunostaining and with increase of glucose uptake marked by higher index of GLUT-1-positive cancer cells. Diversity of Bak and GLUT-1 association with TGF-beta1 depends on the origin of TGF-beta1 expression and probably reflects different impacts of TGF-beta1 on malignant cells and immune cells. Expression of E2F1 and prognosis of patients with Astler-Coller stage B2 and C colorectal cancer treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy V. Sulzyc-Bielicka*, P. Domagala, D. Bielicki, K. Safranow, W. Domagala *Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland Objective: E2F1 affects the genes coding thymidylate synthase, which is the main molecular target for 5fluorouracil. The aim of the study was to assess the association of E2F1 expression in Astler-Coller stage B2 and C colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with survival. Method: Nuclear E2F1 was detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 259 CRCs. One hundred ninety-two patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: High expression of E2F1 was found in 37.5% of CRCs. It was more commonly found in B2 group as compared with group C (p=0.01). High expression of E2F1 was associated with worse overall survival (OS, p=0.028) in stage B2+C group of patients. Low expression of E2F1 was associated with better OS in the whole B2 group (p= 0.039) and in B2 subgroup not treated with chemotherapy (p=0.035).Conclusion: The expression of E2F1 may have prognostic significance in stage B2 group of patients, but not in the group of patients treated with chemotherapy.

Castro-Sousa *Coimbra Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Surgery, PortugalObjective: To our knowledge, this study is the first concerning human liver regeneration (HLR) evaluated by the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) calculation using radioisotopic methods. We studied the HEF as an indicator of HLR of patients who underwent hepatectomy (HR). Method: Ninety-five patients with colorectal metastases (n = 69), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 16) and other tumors (n = 10) were included. Thirty-five underwent major hepatectomy (MAHR) and 63% minor hepatectomy (miHR). HLR was assessed after intravenous bolus injection of 99m Tc-Mebrofenin. In this study, we evaluated the preoperative HEF (T0) and in the fifth day (T5) and 1 month after HR (T30). HEF values of 98.8\u00b1 0.4% were normal. Results: In the overall patient population, the mean HEF values in our series were 97.3\u00b19.6% for T0, 97.5\u00b18.3% for T5 and 98.7\u00b14.1% for T30 (ns). Related to the subgroup of 35 patients treated by MAHR, the HEF values were 97.2\u00b1 5.3% (T0), 95.6\u00b112.6% (T5) and 98.9\u00b11.8% (T30) (ns). For the 60 patients who underwent miHR, the HEF values were 97.4\u00b111% (T0), 98.8\u00b12.4% (T5) and 98.6\u00b14.7% (T30) (ns). Conclusion: Our results strongly support the concept that the HLR is early enough to normalize the HEF at day 5 after HR. We have demonstrated that HLR is early, fast, non-anatomical and functionally complete 5 days after liver resection. This fast functional liver recovery has high clinical importance because considering this quick functional recovery, adjuvant chemotherapy can begin much earlier after surgical resection than the 3 week's dogma.0351Clinical and histopathological study of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis M. Comanescu*, V. Comanescu, C. Popescu, M. Popescu *University Emergency Hospital, Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Craiova, RomaniaObjective: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver injury characterized by a spectrum of histological alterations which closely resemble alcoholic hepatitis steatosis, but occur with no significant alcohol consumption. The aim of the study was to examine the relationships between the degree of hepatic steatosis and various histological features of the accompanying hepatitis. Method: In our study, we included 75 liver biopsies of patients aged between 38 and 64 years. Because clinicopathological correlation is essential in the diagnosis of NASH, we included in our study only patients with a complete report: clinical data (gender, age, BMI and associated diseases) and results of laboratory tests. Results: Out of 463 consecutive liver biopsies, 75 showed steatosis, hepatocyte injury (ballooning degeneration, necrosis), lobular inflammation, with or without pericellular fibrosis and Mallory bodies, all consisting with the diagnosis of NASH. Mild, moderate and severe steatosis was present in 21, 46 and 8 cases, respectively. Cirrhosis was present in five cases, and 11 cases showed severe necro-inflammatory activity. The cases with moderate and severe steatosis were more often associated with higher degrees of necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis. Lesions were zone 3 predominant (centrilobular region). A Perls' Prussian blue stain for iron was positive in six cases. We performed multifactorial analysis of the cases establishing correlations between histological (activity, fibrosis and steatosis) and clinical data. Conclusion: The increasing prevalence of NASH and the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria confirm the need of more studies to define a strategy of approach of this important liver disease.0353 GFAP, SMA and CK7 expression in liver biopsies with chronic B and C viral hepatitis E.-Z. Emeric*, I. Egyed-Zsigmond, I. Jung, G. Lorincz-Marton, D. Georgescu, S. Gurzu, T. Mezei *UMF, Dept. of Pathology, Targu-Mures, RomaniaObjective: Hyperplasia of quiescent or activated stellate cells and also oval cells reflects the reactive changes leading to fibrosis in liver tissue. Method: A retrospective comparative study between chronic B and C viral hepatitis using GFAP, SMA and CK7 antibodies was performed. We have analyzed portal and/or lobular localization and quantified the intensity of those cells which were marked by these antibodies. Results: Our study included 100 cases, 50 with chronic B and 50 with chronic C viral hepatitis. In chronic B viral hepatitis, we observed a high lobular and portal reactivity which was marked only by SMA. In chronic C viral hepatitis, high expression of CK7, GFAP and SMA was revealed by portal areas. Conclusion: The reactive changes observed in biopsy specimens provided by patients selected for biopsy examination seem to have greater importance in C than B viral chronic hepatitis regarding a successful antifibrotic treatment.0355 Impact of hepatic artery selective clamping in hepatocellular function J.

            "text": "Objective: We analysed a series of 589 upper gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinomas treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) between 1989 and 2009, which all were consistently worked up and evaluated by a standardized tumor regression grading system (TRG) in our institution. Method: One hundred eight esophageal adenocarcinomas (EA), 175 adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (AEJ) and 306 gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by a cisplatin/5-FU-based CTX were included. TRG was determined using a four-tiered system based on the estimation of the percentage of residual tumor in relation to the previous tumor bed. Results: In total, 25 patients (4%) had a complete tumor regression (TRG1a) and 111 patients (19%) had a subtotal regression (TRG1b, 1-10% residual tumor). Partial tumor regression (TRG2, 11-50%) was observed in 151 cases (26%); 302 patients (51%) had minimal or no regression (TRG3, >50%). Tumor regression was significantly associated with post-treatment ypT, ypN, ypL category, R status and survival (p<0.001) and was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for survival (p=0.02). Some characteristics relating to the tumor site were, in particular, the higher frequency of total or subtotal tumor regression in EA and AEG (p<0.001) and the association of pretherapeutic tumor grading and Lauren's classification with tumor regression (p=0.001) in GC. Conclusion: We present our 20 year's experience of a highly standardized evaluation of upper GI adenocarcinomas after neoadjuvant CTX demonstrating highly objective and prognostic relevant information from a very large collective. We recommend the implementation of a standardised TRG system in every pathological report of these tumours. Objective: Fibroelastotic changes (FEC) of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are rare lesions. Only 35 cases have been reported in the literature. Their role as an own entity is unclear and is not generally accepted. Method: After initial recognition of an elastotic lesion in a hemicolectomy specimen, special attention was paid to amorphic accumulations in H&E-stained slides of GIT specimens. Elastica-van-Giesson staining was performed to verify the elastotic origin. Results: Within 3 years, a total number of 21 polypoid lesions were collected. One lesion was found in the ileum and six lesions occurred in the stomach. The 14 remaining cases were colon specimens. In five cases, FEC were associated with neoplastic lesions. In 16 cases, however, the accumulation of elastotic fibres was the only histomorphological finding. One patient received intensive short intervals surveillance because of a highly suspicious endoscopic finding in the stomach. In two cases, a clinical relevant stenosis was caused by a submucosal thickening of the bowl wall with massive accumulation of elastotic fibres. Right hemicolectomy was performed in both cases. Conclusion: Fibroelastotic changes are not as exceedingly rare as thought before. They are the only histological finding in a certain number of polypoid lesions in the GIT.",

            "text": "Expression of p53, VEGF and collagen IV in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters S. Rjabceva*, Y. Rogov, I. Dulinez, M. Vozmitel, A. Krilov *Belarusian Medical Academy, Dept. of Pathology, Minsk, BelarusObjective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have a spectrum from minimal indolent tumors to sarcomas. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of p53, VEGF and collagen IV in GISTs and to establish immunohistochemical correlations with clinicopathological parameters. Method: Twenty-four cases diagnosed as GIST were examined by both light microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We used IHC markers such as p53, VEGF and collagen IV. All tumors were classified by the risk grade system by Miettinen et al. Results: Of the tumors, 8/33.3% were classified into low risk grade (LR), 6/25% in the intermediate risk (IR) and 10/ 41.7% in the high risk group (HR). Focal necroses (50%, 50% and 50%, respectively) and microhemorrhages (37.5%, 50% and 90%, respectively) were present in GISTs of all groups. A p53 expression was correlated with a high risk grade (r=0.48, p=0.0335). GISTs of all groups showed VEGF expression (62.5%, 66.7% and 60%, respectively).Objective: Novel influenza is an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract caused by type A influenza virus, affecting by now the entire world. Although the illness is mild and self-limited in a great majority of cases, few patients may have a severe clinical course eventually leading to death. Method: We studied necroptic tissue samples from 97 patients submitted over a 4-month period from a total of 7,008 positive cases identified in Romania since the outbreak of this type of influenza. Data collected included demographic and clinical information. Results: Most of the patients (65.97%) were adults between 21 and 50 years (median age, 42.01 years), male/female ration 1.7:1. The vast majority of the cases revealed diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, all of them associating severe cytopathic effect in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells; 17 cases presented pulmonary ischemic lesions. More than half of the cases (59.79%) presented myocardial interstitial inflammatory infiltrate with full-blown picture of myocarditis in 11 patients. Of the patients, 80.41% had lymphocytic depletion in lymphoid organs. Lymphocytic meningitis, meningothelial hyperplasia, acute tubular necrosis, and liver steatosis were identified in some cases. Objective: HPV DNA has been identified in almost all cervical cancers, and women with active HPV infection (HPVI) express E6/E7 oncogenes. As only a small proportion of infections progress towards cancer, it is important to distinguish transient HPVIs from persistent or progressive ones. Method: One hundred ninety-six samples were tested by conventional Pap smear, HPV-DNA test and typing, E6/E7-mRNA expression from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45. Kstatistic value was used in order to identify possible significant associations. Results: Pap-smear: negative (NEG), 248 (68.5%); atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 50 (12.4%); low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 36 (9.9%); high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 28 (7.7%). One hundred ninety-two of 362 samples (53.04%) were positive to the HPV-DNA test and 80 of 362 ( Objective: Etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) includes the virus infection which plays probably an important cofactor role in the pathogenesis of disease. Clinical and morphological analysis of the cases of chronic herpetic meningoencephalitis (CHME) and MS permitted to discover two cases of a combination of diseases: man, age 58 years (onset of MS since 18 years), and woman, age 65 years (onset of MS since 27 years). Results: Autopsy revealed the small plaques in white matter of brain and cord and some foyers of necrosis in frontal lobe and brain stem. The histological signs of chronic inflammation were established in both cases. Leptomeninges and brain were infiltrated by lymphocytes and macrophages (perivascular cuffs). The progressive lesions of cortical neurons and proliferation of macroglial cells were constant histological findings. Etiological diagnosis of CHME was established on the base of typical intranuclear viral inclusion types I and II in the cells of brain as well as on the revealing of HSV antigens in histological slice. Laminar nonischemic necrosis was found in the cortex of frontal and parietal lobes. In the brain stem, necrosis appeared as the small foci of destruction of nervous tissue. In one case, laminar necrosis were detected in white matter of hippocampe. Conclusion: Thus, the morphological investigation on the light microscopic level permits correctly to recognize the combination of MS and CHME.",
