Subjects: NAGEN 1000 is recruiting 1000 patients, and their relatives, affected with one condition from a list of nearly 200 rare diseases (RD). Albeit rare, joint RD's prevalence is high (2-7%), with a very high social impact, wide multidisciplinary medical coverage, and a high rate of identifiable genetic causes. These features make it possible to involve the medical community, raise population awareness and offer good support to evidence-based medicine practice. The rate of 1 genome per 500 inhabitants facilitates a wide participation from patients and health professionals. 2 . Results and incidental findings: Pertinent findings explaining the referral condition, secondary findings on personal and reproductive risks of severe inherited diseases, and pharmacogenomic variants determining drugs dose and toxicity are reported, based on patient's choice, providing the necessary evidence of the effectiveness of medical interventions based on genomic medicine. New genetic counselling interventions, variant validation and reporting pathways have been put in place for the best provision of services. 3 . Electronic health record (EHR) adaptation: The existing EHR has been modified to host a newly designed recruitment tool which enables and guides the identification and immediate referral of patients from any point in the Navarre health system network. An additional development also makes it possible that clinically actionable genomic results are available for participants' doctors with all other clinical information across the system. 4 . Clinical research: A number of new exciting genomic results, potentially providing new insights into the genetic basis of RDs, and additional information on population genomics, are being produced by NAGEN 1000, offering exceptional material to support new research. It is a main goal of the Project to ensure an adequate data harmonization, which enables data sharing for research under an appropriate regulatory and legal framework. 5 . Optimized use of pre-existing public infrastructures: In order to overcome the lack of local facilities, NAGEN 1000 externalizes WGS sequencing services to CNAG-CRG, the Spanish world leader public centre for genomic analysis. Bioinformatic analysis also relies primarily on CNAG-CRG through the RD-Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform which was deployed for the project to store, analyse and interpret the genomic, data making use of the phenotypes encoded with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and the experts from the Bioinformatics Platform of the Rare Diseases Spanish network (CIBERer) through the Interactive Variant Analysis (IVA) tool based on the genome browser Genome Maps, but expertise in this field has gradually been transferred to the newly created local Translational Bioinformatics Unit during the course of the Project. 6 . ICT: New ICT solutions have been adopted for NAGEN 1000 allowing the storage and high performance managing of massive genomic data, through an innovative partnership with NASERTIC, a local company providing data analysis infrastructures such as the new IBM POWER 9 processor, which build on cross-disciplinary collaboration in research and development with the local industry. 7 . ELSI: While genetic data protection is widely regulated for clinical and research purposes, within the NAGEN 1000 project, the local Health Research Authority has specifically resolved that the massive genomic information resulting from WGS will also be part of the patient's medical record, and it will accordingly be protected and stored. In order to enable the use of genomic data for research, the constitution of a \"Genomic Library\" has been proposed, which would accept specific research enquiries on anonymized genomic sequences upon pertinent EC approval. This scenario requires a new regulatory legal framework, which has also been explored through a specific partnership with Avantia 400+ from the Pyramide group, a local consulting company with wide experience in data protection. 1 . Clinical and pre-clinical results: Around 700 patients have to date followed through the above-outlined pathway, and 33% of the families have now found the long-awaited genetic cause for their previously unexplained condition and now have hope of an improvement of their clinical care based on these findings. Remarkably, 10% of these diagnoses were attributed to genes previously unknown to cause a human disease, or causing different phenotypes than those previously described (Fig. 2) . Additionally, 2% of participants carried genetic predispositions to severe diseases, 4% had reproductive risks and 100% had pharmacogenomic actionable variants influencing prescription (Table 1) . Further, candidate genomic variants potentially explaining patients' diseases have been identified in an additional 24% of participating families, which provides an extended base for new collaborative research projects. Interestingly, about 20 different medical specialities have referred patients to NAGEN 1000, indicating a desirable multidisciplinary involvement in this implementation initiative. 2 . Healthcare workforce education and public empowerment: Monographic NAGEN 1000 symposiums, hospital briefings, clinical sessions and face to face meetings have been organized, opening the participation to all medical professionals in the region. Moreover, the 18 designated specialities \"physician champions\", especially commissioned to facilitate recruitment, help with the clinical interpretation of genomic variants, and to spread the word, received 50 category 1 and 2 CME credits from a NAGEN 1000 tailored genomics education programme.

The Republic of North Macedonia is estimated to have one of the highest age-adjusted comparative diabetes prevalences in Europe, mainly due to the estimated high prevalence of type 2 diabetes [2] [3] [4] . Several factors have been implicated in such a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the country, and its steep rise in the past three decades, including: (1) dietary and lifestyle habits similar to Turkey, the country with the highest age-adjusted comparative diabetes prevalence in Europe; (2) transition from planned to market economy in the last decade of the past century, with sharp rise of unemployment in middle-age populations, and associated psycho-social effects; (3) very high smoking prevalence [3] . The fact that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major cause for morbidity and mortality in the country, and that the majority of diabetes patients would be diagnosed or die from CVD, as well as the fact that the Republic of North Macedonia is categorized as a European country with a very high risk for cardiovascular mortality, further aggravate the situation regarding the very high national diabetes prevalence [3, 5, 6] . The National eHealth System (NeHS) was introduced in the country on 1 July 2013, covering all citizens across primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare levels [3] . Implementation of the National eHealth System has been praised internationally as a key platform for improving the performance of the national healthcare system [7] . In order to manage the national diabetes burden, several initiatives have been undertaken, such as integration of diabetes care module in NeHS since 1 Jan 2015, and formation of National Diabetes Committee according to the Law on Healthcare since February 2015. In addition, international guidelines have been adopted as national guidelines for diabetes care and treatment, and were published in the Official Journal of Republic of North Macedonia, where laws and bylaws are published, further emphasizing the importance attributed to diabetes as a nationwide condition. The National eHealth System module for diabetes care was upgraded with possibility to record metabolic parameters, such as glycemic control, weight, lipid profile, blood pressure and diabetes complications, thus strengthening the role of NeHS as a critical resource for monitoring of diabetes care in the country. Furthermore, NeHS has become essential platform for preventive, predictive and personalized metabolic control in diabetes patients, covering the total population of Republic of North Macedonia. Taking into consideration that diabetes has been a huge healthcare and socio-economic burden for the country, the analysis of data on metabolic control parameters in diabetes patients derived from NeHS would be of utmost importance. Since there are no different targets for metabolic control in adult type 1 and insulin treated type 2 diabetes patients, data on metabolic parameters in insulin treated diabetes patients derived from NeHS would be cumulatively analyzed and reported. The concept of preventive, predictive and personalized medicine (PPPM) has emerged as the focal point of efforts in healthcare aimed at controlling the prevalence and management of non-communicable chronic diseases, including diabetes [8] [9] [10] [11] . The management of diabetes and the critical role of PPPM in modernization of healthcare have been acknowledged as priorities by global and regional organizations and health-related institutions such as the Organization of the United Nations, the European Union and the National Institutes of Health [8] [9] [10] [11] . The possible predictive role of novel biomarkers in diabetic complications, particularly nephropathy, has been reported, with the possibility for predictive diagnosis and targeted preventive measures [12] . In addition, a nomogram for prediction of 3-year personalized risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on age, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides was developed; and suboptimal health status was identified as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus in a community-based cohort [13, 14] .

The national prevalence of diagnosed diabetes cases in the total population was 4.0%, whereas it was 5.0% 20-79 years ago [4] . The recent International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas estimated total diabetes cases, including both diagnosed and undiagnosed, for the country to be 175,100 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 131,200-218,200), and 20-79 years ago it was 11.2% (95% CI 8.4-13.9% ) and diabetes age-adjusted comparative prevalence in population 20-79 years of 9.3% (95% CI 6.8-11.5%) [2] .

The National eHealth System has also been established as a platform for preventive diabetes care, since it enables monitoring of development of micro-vascular complications in diabetes patients, and through monitoring of glycemic control and risk factors, it provides directions for focusing preventive activities to avoid or delay diabetic complications. Finally, the National eHealth System has served as a platform for personalized diabetes care, since it enables personalized diabetes care that is based on the glycemic control and concomitant conditions and treatments; NeHS data are available to care-givers across the spectrum of healthcare levels (primary, secondary, tertiary), and there is a potential to add new scientifically sound and approved biomarkers to NeHS nationwide at a patient level in the future, to further personalize diabetes care.

Therefore, we would like to demonstrated that response to physical stimuli is an individual feature, even for consensual reaction. The aim of the study was to assess the contralateral response in healthy volunteers exposed to various physiotherapeutic treatments such as local cryotherapy, ultrasonotherapy, electrostimulation with diadynamic currents and visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) light irradiation. Treatments were performed on the quadriceps muscle of the right leg, whilst corresponding place on the left leg was the reference limb. Thermographic images were taken before and after the procedure at set intervals. Altogether, 712 thermograms were analyzed. The temperature differences between the treated limb and the reference limb, were observed, confirming the presence of consensual reaction after the four monotherapies were analyzed.

Our paper intends to address this drawback. The application of infrared imaging for monitoring the physiotherapeutic procedures seems to have many advantages. Thermography may be a valuable tool for preventing possible tissue damage during physiotherapy procedures, e.g., as a result of incorrect selection of physical stimulus parameters. It may also help to stratify the patients based on factors such as gender, age, thermal response of the treated region as well as the contralateral one and further lead to more patientoriented therapy. If known, the patient' thermal profile may be used for personalization of physioterapeutic procedures and help to increase the treatment' efficiency. Also, if needed, the thermal profile of the entire stratified group may be used, this however requires extended research, which will indicate the statistical relationships between the stimuli parameters and the group response.

Traditionally, the energy supply of cancer cells is mainly derived from aerobic glycolysis, but not from the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is called the Warburg effect [8] . However, the Warburg effect cannot explain the energy supply of all cancer cells. Thus, a novel reverse Warburg effect was put forward in 2009 [9] , which emphasizes the interactions between cancer cells and tumor-microenvironment (TME), and cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) become metabolically coupled. Cancer cells secrete many reactive oxygen species (ROS) into TME to enhance oxidative stress in CAFs. When the inflammation, autophagy, loss of stromal caveoloin-1 (Cav-1), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are increased in CAFs, the aerobic glycolysis is prone to occur. As a result, CAFs secrete lots of energy-rich fuels to TME, such as lactate and pyruvate [10] . These nourishment fuels feed mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP supplement. In this process, mono-carboxylate transporter (MCT1 and MCT4) is highly expressed in cell membrane in cancer cells and CAFs. MCT1 is upregulated specifically in cancer cells to participate in lactate uptake, whereas MCT4 is distributed specifically in CAFs to participate in lactate efflux progress [11] .

Huge progress has been made; in radiation oncology. We have completely moved from simple 3D conformal techniques to 4D radiation in the past two decades owing to better equipment (enabling special techniques such as IMRT, arc therapy up to IGRT with daily positioning and verification), more sophisticated treatment planning systems (avoiding radiation of surrounding healthy tissues, using data from modern mpMRI or even PET/CT for contouring) and/or immobilisation devices [3] .

In some cases they can be supplemented by an endocrine approach in the form of androgen deprivation (ADT) and, most importantly, they can be applied to advanced/recurrent disease, or metastatic setting in patients with distant (mainly bone) metastases chemotherapy. As far as newer androgen receptor targeted agents (ARTA) are concerned, we have specific methods of cancer vaccination or brachytherapy-based treatments by Radium 223 isotope. Furthermore, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) guided therapy is used today. Simply put, prostate cancer treatment modalities and possibilities have at least doubled within the past few years. It has a clear impact on the need for regular PSA testing to determine treatment response and progression time because PSA levels in some cases are not in correlation with the achieved response [4] . After radical prostatectomy (RP), a PSA decline to 0 ng/ml (maximal detection level < 0,2 ng/ml) should be reached within hours, or a few days. Higher levels are associated with the presence of residual disease in the prostate bed or distant metastases. A similar PSA course can be seen after radical radiation (RT); however, it is much slower (weeks or months because of tumour cell radiobiology). It could be faster after some types of brachytherapy, or maybe extreme hypo fractionated regimens, but this concept requires further investigation. In clinical practice we do not always reach an undetectable PSA level, but the nadir's long-term stabilisation is also considered a positive treatment result. Unfortunately, where PSA levels are low, a minimal residual disease after RP or RT is not detectable by any other method. When androgen deprivation (incl. new androgen receptor blockade by ARTA) or chemotherapy is used, we expect PSA to decrease more slowly (weeks or months) again. The flare phenomenon of LH-RH analogues is also known to occur in the treatment of all stages of prostate cancer. A similar bounce phenomenon with a temporary PSA rise can be seen 1-2 years after brachytherapy.

The extent of solid tumour component can be used as a predictor of invasiveness [7] . The gradual transition between solid and ground glass opacities where the boundary between the two components is very difficult to determine reduces CT sensitivity. Solid tumourous tissue may also be indistinguishable from collapsed lung, fibrous tissue or mucin accumulation. A possible solution could be to evaluate a solid component in the mediastinal window, which filters out lower densities [8] . The predictive potential of texture analysis using mathematical and statistical methods seems promising [9] . Finding a subsolid pulmonary nodule does not always mean that it is an adenocarcinoma. The literature indicates that up to 40% of these nodules may be of benign, primarily inflammatory, origin. For this reason, subsolid (but also solid) pulmonary nodules smaller than 8 mm are usually monitored preventively. Malignancy is suspected in nodules that tend to grow. This is expressed in terms of volume doubling time. It is generally accepted that malignancy suspects are nodules with a doubling time between 30 and 400 days. However, for subsolid nodule these times may be longer, which is also evident from our analysis. For this reason, subsolid nodules should be subject to targeted prevention in the form of longer monitoring intervals [10, 11] . Another evaluation method of subsolid pulmonary nodes is PET/CT with fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). In contrast to the non-invasive component, 18F-FDG has been shown to accumulate in the invasive component. The problem however is the mucinous tumour variants which, despite the presence of the invasive component, may not show increased 18F-FDG uptake. It should also be noted that nodes smaller than 5-8 mm may be falsely negative due to their small size. In such cases the CT finding should be taken into account [12, 13] . Inflammatory consolidations, such as FDG tumours, may accumulate and be a source of false positives.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 535, "end": 538, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 938, "end": 941, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1051, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1796, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1797, "end": 1800, "text": "11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2341, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2345, "text": "13]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data Interpretation and PPPM-based Expert Recommendations"}, {"text": "In conclusion, personalised medicine enables a whole new approach to the treatment of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Toothache is a strong, unpleasant sensation in a tooth, in a certain area of the gum or in the entire jaw. It refers to those pains that do not allow you to sleep, eat food, speak and perform normal actions. In its strength and intensity, toothache can only be compared with the pain from the exit of stones from the kidneys. It will not be a mistake to say that the prevalence of dental diseases in the human population exceeds all other types of diseases. A large number of dental clinics and surgeries in any, even a small, city evidences this fact [1, 3] . \"Teeth ache! Why?\"-any person has faced a similar problem at least once in his life. Pain is never without a reason-this is a signal that some kind of malfunction has occurred in the organ. If the pain did not occur, it would be impossible to recognize the onset of the disease, and patients would seek help only in a very severe condition. Toothache can be classified based on a number of signs. 1 . According to the pain dynamics. 2 . According to the pain intensity. In the acute form, the pain is so strong that a person hurries to the dentist without hesitation. 3 . According to the pain localization. Additionally, the causes of toothache are diverse: tooth decay, pulpitis, periodontitis, periodontitis, etc. In our research, we sought to understand why intact, \"Hollywood white\", teeth ache after professional whitening.

The Locator helps locate samples and datasets hosted by biobanks that are of interest to the requesters and will allow for detailed, privacy-preserving, multi-criteria search of samples and datasets, while also respecting the degree of control required by the biobank infrastructure operators [8] .

ISBER fosters collaboration; creates education and training opportunities; provides a forum for the dissemination of state-ofthe-art policies, processes, and research findings; and provides an international showcase for innovative technologies, products, and services. Together, these activities promote the best practices that cut across the broad range of repositories that ISBER serves [9] . ISBER was initially planned in 1999, and the first regular annual meeting took place in 2001. ISBER provides services around the world and has four domains: Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Indo-Pacific, and China. In comparison to BBMRI-ERIC, ISBER is global; reflecting a wider range of repository types and trying to formulate future trends and challenges in biobanking. Notwithstanding, human biobanks are the core of ISBER activities. The newly published Best Practices in 2018, 4th edition [10] pays special attention to the ELSI, thus bringing medicine closer to a patient-focused approach and promoting a personalized approach.

The objective of our study was to determine in a limited randomized clinical trial the patient-and nosology-specific efficacy of immunobiotics, developed from different original strains of lactobacillus (and their combinations), demonstrating both antimicrobial and immune-modulating functions preliminary examined on animal and cellular models [2] . Patients with infectious-inflammatory diseases of the genitourinary system were recruited from a regional hospital. Eligibility requirements and enrolment procedures were performed in accordance with the EU Regulation No 536/2014. The inclusion criteria for women were age over 18 years, urogenital pathologies of different nosology, and exclusion criteria were detected antibodies to hepatitis B or C; alcohol or drug abuse; HIV infection or antiretroviral therapy; diagnosed diseases of the cervix (dysplasia); menstrual disorders; cancer; pregnancy. Collected specimens were plated on chromogenic media for detection of cultured urinary tract microbiota representatives and were additionally genetically defined by qRT-PCR (Femoflor\u00ae-16, Androflor\u00ae REAL-TIME PCR Detection Kit, DNA technologies, Russia). Isolated microorganisms were identified by using the Lachema biochemical tests. Local immune response (IL-10, 17, 1b; TNF-a, SIgA) before and after applied LAB treatment was measured by ELISA. Lactobacilli strains in this study were sequenced and identified as Lactobacillus casei (2 strains) and Lactobacillus acidophilus.Individual gender and nosology specific microbiome changes of infectious-inflammatory diseases of the genitourinary system by application of different lactobacilli strains composition The typical agents (nosologies) of infectious-inflammatory diseases of the genitourinary system were identified. The female bacterial vaginitis was characterized mostly by the predominance of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans with or without the presence of Gardnerella, Atopobium, Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma. Different nosologies of the male urogenital tract diseases were characterized mostly by the prevalence of such opportunistic microorganisms as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus with or without Ureaplasma, Haemophilus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Candida. Thus, new effective probiotics and their compositions were designed taking into account individual features of the commensal microbiota of the patients and the dominating agents of opportunistic infections of male and female urogenital systems.It has been proved that the use of the L. casei IMV B-7412 probiotic strain was the most effective in mixed infections classified as a significant anaerobic/aerobic microbial ratio of microbiome, a combination of strains L. casei IMV-B 7280 / L. casei IMV B-7412 enhances the antifungal effect, while the composition of strains L. casei IMV B-7280 and L. acidophilus IMV B-7279 promotes the restoration of healthy microbiome, providing complete elimination of coliform bacteria and microscopic fungi, and reducing the number of pathogenic staphylococci. All LAB strains and their compositions were characterized by strain and compositionally specific ability to restore the local and systemic immune response by decreasing the level of IL-17 and SIgA, and increasing the IL-10 level.Proper combination of LAB strains pragmatically designed is crucial to get prognostic healthy microbiome changes Efficacy of the application of different pharmabiotics is the subject of great concern since the immunomodulatory properties of its LAB components are mainly strain-dependent and connected to cell walls structure, as was recently demonstrated [3] . There is also an open discussion about oral vs. intraurogenital administration of various LAB based biopreparation. Their efficacy is dependent on the proper combination of LAB strains, correspondingly pragmatically designed content of pharmabiotics is crucial. The combination of commensal strains that are defining the efficacy by producing specific metabolites or preventing adhesion or even physiological competition with strains should also be considered. Previously, we were able to demonstrate that following the oral administration of synbiotic Bifiten\u2122, the vagina mucosal sites were settled by both commensal and transit microbiota, which in turns led to a reduction of the perinatal complications for the mother and newborn [4] . At the same time, we were able to observe side effects after application of such complex synbiotics to healthy mothers, who did not require any treatment and were initially characterized by a significant number of their own lactobacilli strains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1452, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4739, "end": 4742, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5480, "end": 5483, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Addressed nosologies of dominant noncommunicable diseases and used methodology"}, {"text": "Prevention of infection-inflammatory diseases needs to be based on monitoring of individual urogenital system microbiome ratio, since this ratio determines the resistance of the local immune system and initiation of low-grade inflammation.
