In 6=524 patients (1.1%) the positioning of the patch was difficult mainly due to very small or fatty anatomy. Longterm results (1 year postoperative): 5.1% had some pain or heavy pain, 21.6% had occasional pain and 10.3% had little or some movement problems. There was 1 recurrent femoral hernia (5 mm hole with fat; 8 months post op), only one patch has been removed because of strong pain in riding or sitting in low seats.",

The diameter of abdominal wall defects was 2-12 cm. In 30 patients a Parietex Composite-Mesh has been used, in 22 a Proceed-Mesh, in 3 a Bard Composix-Mesh and in one patient two 15 \u00c2 15 cm 2 TiMeshes. Mesh-size was 10 \u00c2 15 cm 2 to 20 \u00c2 30 cm 2 . Hernia sacs were left in place, hernia contents, mostly omentum, were replaced into the abdominal cavity. Meshes were fixed using endo-clips in 4 patients, tacks in 22 and the Salute Fixation-System in 30 patients. Postoperative follow-up includes a control at 1 week, 1 month and 1 year postoperatively. There were no problems during operation. Patients were discharged on the second postoperative day. After a mean follow-up of 18.1 months (1-43 months) two patients have a hernia recurrence, three patients had local pain for one month and one patient had an umbilical infection, which could be managed without the removal of the mesh.",

Calculation of creatinine clearance with the Cockcroft-Gault formula is more suitable for preoperative risk stratifica-tion as compared to calculation of creatinine clearance with the MDRD formula. Background. The matricellular protein Tenascin-C (TN-C) induces production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inhibits cellular adhesion and mediates cellular deadhesion. These effects are crucial in the dynamic process of cardiac remodeling. It has been reported that TN-C expression is up-regulated in ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI) in the border zone between scar tissue and non-infarcted area. We analysed the expression of TN-C in the post MI infarcted and non-infarcted area after the treatment with the selective endothelin A (ET A )-receptor antagonist TBC3214-Na. Blockade of the ET A -receptor decreases cell proliferation, LV hypertrophy, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators.",

Both genetic and epigenetic changes in shed cells from gastrointestinal tumours into stool could be detected. Epigenetic hypermethylation can result in transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes and is considered to be a key event of sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis. sFRP1 is a tumour suppressor protein that contains a domain similar to one of WNT-receptor proteins and inhibits WNT-receptor binding to its signal transduction molecules. Detection of hypermethylation of sFRP1 gene in human DNA isolated from stools might provide a novel strategy for the detection of sporadic CRC.

A special feature of esophageal cancer is its early lymphatic spread in comparison with other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to the discovery of specific markers for lymphatic endothelium, selective staining of lymphatic vessels has become possible. In recent studies the prognostic value of peritumoral lymphangiogenesis and lymphovascular invasion in various human malignancies has been shown. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), expressing the lymphoangiogenic growth factor VEGF-C, were shown to be related to tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis, lymphovascular invasion and lymph-node metastasis. Aim of this study was to assess tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis as well as the role of TAMs in a cohort of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.",

These extended techniques should lead to a more direct and less invasive method for approaching orbital lesions or posttraumatic deformities giving the surgeon a high degree of security in sparing vital anatomic structures. Background. Surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME) has become a widely used and acceptable technique to expand the maxilla in adolescents and adult patients. SARME takes the advantage of bone formation at the maxillary edges of the midline, while they are separated by an external force. SARME is indicated in patients with isolated, considerable (more than 5 mm) transverse maxillary deficiency. While surgically assisted palatal expansion is performed in patients after closure of the sagittal palatal suture, conservative rapid maxillary expansion can be used in younger patients. Studies concerning such cases show, that just 30% of the expanded width is located in the area of the palatal suture, while the rest of the extention (70%) are reached by dentoalveolar movements like tipping. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of expansion caused by expansion of the maxillary suture and by the dentoalveolar complex. Furthermore changes of the nasal cavity should be discussed.",

In the treatment of patients with bile duct carcinoma, surgery (liver resections for Klatskin tumors stage Bismuth I-III, Whipple's procedure for more distally localized tumors), if feasible, plays a key role as well.",

Carcinomas of the colon and rectum are two separate entities as far as biology, probability of local recurrences, metastasis patterns, surgical strategy and multimodal treatment regimes are concerned. Operative treatment of colon carcinoma is generally standardized, but the concept of sentinal node biopsy is a new aspect. A metaanalysis of stage II colon carcinoma showed a survival advantage of up to 5% for adjuvant therapies including 5-FU. The mortality rate for stage III colon cancer could be reduced by 10-15% with adjuvant chemotherapy. The operative standard for rectal carcinoma is Heald's technique of total mesorectal excision. For proximal rectal carcinomas, a partial mesorectal excision with a greater distance (at least 5 cm) to the edge of the tumor is adequate. With rectal carcinoma, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is more effective at reducing local recurrences and involves fewer complications than does postoperative treatment. Accordingly, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is indicated at least for T-3 tumors of the lower and middle thirds of the rectum. In all, total survival and fewer local recurrences are seen with combined radiochemotherapy for rectal carcinoma. A number of randomized prospective studies published since 2005 showed comparable long-term results for laparoscopic and open colon surgery. The results of such studies on rectal carcinoma are not yet available.",

However, this procedure has once again raised the insufficient structures in surgical education, the lack of valid training program and standardized approaches for a defined rotation and the obligation for both, senior surgeons and trainees to perform a certain number of teaching operations. A structured reform of rules and regulations for training is necessary. Background. The purpose of this study was to review our hospital's experience in a retrospective single-center analysis of all patients undergoing surgery for posttraumatic thoracic pathologies between 1972 and 2006.",

A low voltage current is applied to surface ring electrodes on a nonconductive catheter. Impedance is determined by the conductivity of the medium bridging these electrodes. Entry of liquid into the esophageal lumen produces a drop of impedance. Gas entry results in a sudden rise of impedance. Monitoring impedance in several channels detects direction, velocity and extent of the movement of liquid or gas through the esophagus. Stationary equipment combining manometry and impedance is used for simultaneous esophageal motility and transit studies. Transport studies using impedance only can also be done with probes intended for reflux testing. Saline and a viscous gel are used to assess transport through the esophagus. In a recent study with combined impedance and manometry a significantly higher proportion of patients with incomplete transport of both liquid and viscous boluses (32=56, 57%) presented with dysphagia than patients with complete transport of both (50=216, 23%) or incomplete transport of only one (21=69, 30%) of the test substances. Equipment joining impedance with high-resolution manometry is currently being developed. A higher sensitivity and specificity for regional motility and transport abnormalities is to be expected from this technical advancement. Portable recorders are available for 24-hour MII-and pH-monitoring. Refluxes are detected by retrograde impedance changes: Liquid refluxes are characterised by retrograde drops, gas refluxes by rapid increases and mixed liquid=gas refluxes by a sequence of both deviations from the baseline. The main advantage of impedance technology over conventional pH-monitoring is the detection of refluxes independent of pH. Off antisecretory medication refluxes with pH > 4 are mainly encountered postprandially, at a time when regurgitation is commonly experienced by reflux patients. The diagnostic yield of symptom to reflux association analysis is significantly increased by the inclusion of refluxes with pH > 4. Distribution of impedance channels along the catheter facilitates the calculation of reflux exposure at different levels above the lower esophageal sphincter.",

The amount satisfying results of the Elektra group excel the good results in the Martini group. The biggest problem concerning the Elektra Prosthesis is the high frequency of cup loosening, that is unacceptable high. The treasons for that matter could be complex: 1. biomechanical problem, because of the converting of a saddle joint to a universal joint, 2. metallurgic problem that could be solved by the use of different surface material, 3. vitality problem of the os trapezium because of an unfavourable quotient of metal and bone. Unsettled remains, if revision or cementing of the cup could be a possibility to salvage of the implant. A conversion of the procedure to resection methods is possible anytime. So the use of the Elektra prosthesis still is a good alternative under the condition of a clear indication and information of the patient about the possibilities of loosing. Background. Posttraumatic arthrosis as well as loss of function in the PIP joint due to rheumatoid disease mean for the patient to be afflicted with pain. In many cases this leads to serious diminution of quality of life and in some cases the patient looses his occupation. It is the goal of implantation of total endoprosthesis to sustain movement and improve the range of motion, but most importantly to exterminate the pain. Certainly removement of pain can be obtained by a simple arthrodesis but this of course is less satisfying in comparsion with mobility in the PIP joint provided by the prosthesis. Since PIP joint endoprosthesis is a relativley young and new procedure there are only view experiences found in literature.",

Background. Treatment of unstable distal metaphyseal tibial fractures with intramedullary nailing remains challenging even in fractures without intra-articular involvement. Proximity to the ankle and biomechanical aspects makes the surgical treatment more complicated compared to fractures of the midshaft. Intramedullary nailing (IMN) is the ''golden standard'' for midshaft fractures but can be challenging in distal metaphyseal fractures. Therefore, optimal surgical treatment of these fractures remains controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate 4 different tibial nails of the newest generation in a biomechanical approach.",

Background. Leakage and fistulization of the gastrojejunostomy have been the major drawback of gastric bypass surgery since its first description. Most authors agree that operative treatment is the mainstay of therapy in all patients with signs of sepsis. However, intestinal contents causing localized infection may impede healing of sutured leaks in some patients and fistulas develop. As the anastomosis cannot be disconnected or exteriorized for anatomical reasons other forms of treatment have to be applied.",

Our results are comparable with international data. Although very tantalizing there are no large prospective randomized multicenter studies that show clear superiority of one or another strategy. Epidemiologic data show an increasing incidence of gastroschisis which shows the importance of standardized successful procedures for the future. Background. Colorectal Cancer is one of the most common cancers in western countries with incidence rates that are quite stable through the last 10 years. While surgical therapy with high central vessel ligation and adequate lymph node dissection seems well standardised -in laparoscopy as well as conventional surgery -great efforts have been made in new adjuvant treatment strategies and in treatment of colorectal liver metastases.",

Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is an one access technique for local excision of rectal tumours using gas dilatation of the bowel and a stereoscope for unrestricted vision on the operation field. The TEM-technique was invented by Buess, Theiss and Hutterer and has been performed at our department since 1993. Sessile benign adenomas of the rectum inappropriate for colonoscopic resection represent the vast majority of cases indicated for TEM-procedure, using the advantages of sphincter preserving resection in all thirds of the rectum without considerable access trauma. Furthermore, TEM can be applied to a highly selected group of rectal carcinoma patients in curative objective, including T1G1 or G2L0V0 lesions, classified as low risk carcinomas after Hermanek's criteria for malignant potential, with recurrence and 5-yearsurvival-rates equal to radical surgery. Under palliative purposes TEM can be considered in more advanced carcinomas such as high risk carcinomas (T1G3) or in T2-3 carcinomas without stenosis in patients with high risk for general anaesthesia, rejection of stomal construction or present distant metastases.",

Girsch Orthop\u00e4disches Spital Speising, Kinderabteilung, Wien, Austria Background. Patients with untreated upper brachial plexus lesions frequently develop an internal rotation contracture of the shoulder, deficient active shoulder abduction and especially external rotation. The humeral derotation osteotomy combined with muscle transfers is one of the most common secondary reconstructive procedures to correct this deformity and improve the upper limbs function. The aim of this study was to investigate the patients' benefit of the surgical intervention. In order to objectively assess the functional outcome an optoelectronic motion analysis system was used to capture and analyze the kinematics of the involved limbs pre-and postoperatively.",

There are lot different indications for the use of Versajet in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. This system is appropriate for a variety of burn and traumatic wounds. Because of the precise handling the use of this device is also in cosmetic surgery possible.",

Because of a physical effect, a localised vacuum is created across the operating window. This holds and cuts targeted tissue while aspirating tissue from the site. Therefore it enables to precisely target damaged tissue and spare viable tissue. Surgical techniques can be enhanced, for instance the device holds targeted tissue during irrigation and excision. In addition, Versajet cleans and cools at the same time as debriding, so additional cleaning techniques are not required. The depth of the skin -debridement is absolute predictable. In about 100 cases the Versajet has been used. The range of indications included burns, infected wounds (decubitus ulcers, traumatic wounds, Fournier gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis). The advantage of this hydrosurgery system compared to sharp debridement using scalpels, dermatome, etc. is a more rapid and precise debridement, therefore the preservation of viable tissue, the precise and easy treatment of concavities and convexities and a reduction of blood loss could be achieved. Histological findings proved the feasibility of an exact abrasion into different layers of the dermis.",

Troshkov Medical University, Lviv, Ukraine Splenectomy in children often leads to various complications. Retrospectively, results of the management of 45 children (range from 3 to 14 years), which underwent surgery due to the liens' injury, were examined. The immunological and hormonal investigations were performed. Out of 45 operations in 33 the splenectomy, in 6 cases the splenectomy with the tissue autotransplantation of the lien in the greater omentum and in 6 cases the organ-preservation operations were performed. Purulentseptic postoperative complications were noted in 7 (15.6%) patients, which connected with the inadequate of the immune answer. The obvious T-cellular immunodeficit, low concentration of IgM, decrease of phagocytosis were observed in this category of patients. By that, on the background of activation of the renin-aldosteron system and changes of the eicosanoids synthesis, the danger of the sepsis and septic shock development were arisen. The autotransplantation of the lien tissue did not protect the organism from the purulent-septic complications in the nearest postoperative period. As the answer to the transplanted tissue and necrobiotic processes, which had been occurred in it, the autoimmune processes and reactions of the hypersensitivity of the immediate type (the increase of IgE and DNA antibodies levels) were intensified. With the goal to prevent complications in the postoperative period the thymic hormones, interferon a, aspirin and dipyridamol were applied. In the remote terms, the postsplenectomy syndrome manifested itself in patients, which underwent the splenectomy in childhood. Predisposition to the infections and thrombohemorrhagic processes prevailed. The disturbances of hemostasis are linked with the significant increase of the T-helpers that connected with the intensifying of the IL-1 action, which also evokes the proliferation of the preactivated B-lymphocytes, and, as the result, the obvious synthesis of IgG. IgG in the composition of the immune complexes can stimulate the function of the neutrophyles. All this promotes to transfering the Hageman factor in the active condition, activation of the coagulative and kininogen-kinin blood system, intensification of the fibrinolysis, the deposit of fibrin and the development of the hemorrhages. The autotransplantation of the lien tissue could not enhance defence of the organism in full value. Thus, at the traumatic injury of the spleen the prevalence must be given to the organpreserving operations. Background. MRI of the breasts has been described the most sensitive imaging modality for detection of multicentric or multifocal malignant tumor manifestations. In 1995 we began with routine preoperative MRI-staging in breast cancer patients.

In selected cases of persistent postoperative parenchymal fistulas, peripheral intrapulmonary injection of fibrin glue offers a low-risk and efficient surgical option. Background. Recent case-matched studies demonstrate that stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in functionally inoperable patients can be treated by limited resection approaches without compromising the oncological result. The recently introduced 1318-nm Nd-YAG laser enables the highly selective and parenchyma-saving excision of pulmonary lesions, and was thus originally designed for the removal of multiple lung metastases and more central lesions. In this prospective study, we are evaluating for the first time the mid-term results after local resection of stage I primary NSCLC by laser knife in functionally inoperable patients as defined by predicted postoperative FEV1 (ppoFEV1) less than 40%.",

Regardless of tumor stage, patients treated in a hospital that saw less than 10 cases per year had a 60% higher mortality risk than those treated in hospitals with more than 150 operated cases per year. An operation performed by a breast cancer specialist reduces the mortality risk by 16% in comparison to operations performed by non-specialists (Gillis Cr, Hole DJ 1996 BMJ 312, 145) . The results of DuBois et al.

The minimum number of 150 cases of primary new breast cancer cases per year and center recommended by EUSOMA (but with an evidence level of 3 and so not scientifically verified) would reduce the number of breast centers in Austria to about 30.

Background. Today infections with Clostridium perfringens are rare, but still most of the cases turn out lethal, although receiving timely medical treatment. This report deals with three different patients, who were transferred to our surgical department since June 2006.

Besides all efforts this patient died the same day because of an acute circulatory failure. Second patient: Because of an acute abdomen the second patient received a CT and in suspicion of appendicitis an explorative laparotomy was indicated. Furthermore a known haematoma at the right shoulder began to extend in sizeand shortly after the typical crepitation was palpable as well. Even though the arm was exarticulated during an immediate operation the patient died because of the massive progressing infection. Third patient: This patient was sent to our hospital because of the suspicion of gas-gangrene. During physical examination the typical crepitation was palpable at the right femoral and lower leg with associated emphysema. During operation the wound seemed unsuspicious. Immediate examination of the tissue (Department of Hygienic and Microbiology) showed a negative result concerning an infection with clostridum perfringens, so it could be refrained from an amputation of the femoral. Entirely some incisions of the skin and the fascia were done. Postoperative we kept watch on the wound in short intervals -showing consistent results the patient was transferred to our general ward to be treated because of his chronic ulcer on the right leg.",

The first two cases demonstrate that (besides the low incidence of 1.5 events per 100 Mio. persons and year) infections of clostridum perfringens should always be kept in mind, especially in high-riskpatients. In contrast to this the third patient shows, that severe consequences because of a precipitate indication can be avoided by experience and careful evaluation. Results. Altogether 16 patients were treated for RSH at our institution during the study period. Seven patients were on oral anticoagulation, 3 patients were taking acetylsalicylic, 1 was on clopidogrel and 1 patient was on anticoagulation with low dose heparin, whereas 4 patients had no anticoagulation. A previous trauma event was apparent in six of the cases, one of this patient was on oral anticoagulation, one on acetylsalicylic, one was taking clopidogrel and three had no anticoagulation. RSH was correctly identified by means of ultrasound in 7 of 12 cases, in which this investigation was performed. A CT scan investigation demonstrated the haematoma in all (12 of 12 cases) cases. Thirteen patients were managed conservatively, 3 patients underwent surgical treatment. Eight patients needed blood transfusion and four patients received vitamin K medication.

The surgical treatment is the most effective method for weight reduction in morbid obesity Laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LSGB) for morbid obesity has been reported to provide long term weight loss with a low risk of operative complications. Nevertheless, esophageal dilation leading to achalasia-like and reflux symptoms is a feared complication of LASGB.

Laparoscopic implantation of an adjustable gastric band (AGB) still represents the most frequently performed bariatric operation in Austria. However, in recent years a general tendency to gastric bypass procedures can be observed. A mayor cause for this development may be long term problems such as the development of an esophageal dilatation.",

Of these 206 patients, 36 patients (35 female, 1 male, median age: 40 years, range: 22-67 years), an equivalent of 17%, developed an esophageal dilatation during follow up. The median time from the operation to the occurrence of esophageal dilatation was 35 months (range: 4-68 months). At the time of esophageal dilatation the median excess weight loss was 52% (range: 2-111%), the median filling volume was 7 ml (range: 5.5-9.5 ml). Twelve patients had to be reoperated in a median of 5 months (range: 1 month-17 months) after the dilatation occurred. Eleven patients had a gastric bypass operation after band explantation and one was converted into a sleeve gastrectomy. In the other 24 patients a conservative approach has been persued so far, consisting of a deflation of the band and careful refillings after approximately 1 month. Eleven patients were already available for follow up a median of 7 months (range: 1 month-24 months) after the dilatation. Ten patients significantly gained weight again. The median excess weight loss was reduced from 56% (range: 6-111%) at the time of the dilatation to 35% (range: \u00c024-87%) at follow up. Only one patient managed to lose further weight without radiologic signs of esophageal dilatation after refilling of the band.",

As it is shown, excision of a choledochal cyst is not protection by itself against the development of cancer in the future. After resection patients should have long term follow up. Any patient, especially any adult, with recurrent symptoms following cyst related surgery must be evaluated for malignancies in the biliary tract. A surgical treatment after diagnosis of a choledochal cyst is necessary to avoid bile duct carcinoma. Background. Sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a nonmalignant proliferation of immature smooth muscle cells, usually in the lung but occasionally in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes as well. There is perilymphatic, perivascular and, with pulmonary manisfestation, peribrochiolar proliferation and invasion. It is an extremely rare disease (prevalence 1:1 000 000) that exclusively afflicts women of childbearing age. The most common presenting symptoms are dyspnea, cough, recurring pneumothorax or chylous ascites. The definitive diagnosis is obtained by biopsy. LAM has a typical histological picture featuring diffuse, sometimes nodular proliferations of immature smooth muscle that stain specifically with the marker HMB-45. Unlike tuberous sclerosis (TS), sporadic LAM is triggered by a mosaic mutation of the TSC-2 gene in the involved tissue. TS in contrast is caused by a somatic mutation of the TSC-2 gene. This somatic mutation leads above all to neurological symptoms (a trias of epilepsy, cognitive impairment, dermatological manifestations) but, in some cases, to a pulmonary manifestation of LAM. At present, there is no curative treatment for LAM, though a trial with gestagens is an option. Terminal pulmonary failure is an indication for lung transplant.",

In inflammation, activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis lead to microvascular thrombosis. Thus, clot stability might be a critical issue in the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Activated FXIII (FXIIIa) forms stable fibrin clots by covalently cross-linking fibrin monomers. In recent studies, multiple polymorphisms have been described in the FXIII-A subunit gene. The Val34Leu polymorphism affects the function of FXIII by increasing the rate of FXIII activation by thrombin, which results in an increased and faster rate of fibrin stabilization. In the present study, we analysed the influence of the common FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism on inflammatory and coagulation parameters in human experimental endotoxemia.",

Helicobacter infection of the hepatobiliary system has been proposed as a novel risk factor in the pathogenesis of gallstone disease (GSD) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Because there seem to be differences in the incidences of Helicobacter infection in various populations, we investigated whether Helicobacter infection of the biliary tract is present in Germany, a region with a high incidence of GSD, but with a low incidence of GBC.",

The male risk population (65\u00fe) should undergo duplex screening of the popliteal artery. While asymptomatic aneurysms >2 cm should be treated surgically, smaller ones should be observed, since aneurysms <2 cm in diameter have a distinctly lower occlusion and amputation rate. In symptomatic cases a revascularisation with venous bypass should be attempted, if there are open outflow vessels to connect the venous graft to. If a vascular bypass reconstruction is not promising a conservativ treatment may prevent amputation. Background. Three dimensional motion analysis is a new evaluation method of upper extremity function. This video based system provides accurate and reproducible 3D kinematic data by tracking movements. The method is derived from clinical gait analysis which has already reached global acceptance within this field. It should overcome the deficiencies of subjective investigations. In order to demonstrate the use of the system the analysis of patients with brachial plexus lesions before and after surgical treatment is presented.",

Osteitis fibrosa cystica sowie extrem erh\u00f6hte Serumkalzium -und Parathormonwerte sind Leitmerkmale, die histopathologische Diagnose ist schwierig, Kapselinvasion und Gef\u00e4\u00dfinvasion gelten aber als zus\u00e4tzliche Hinweise. Erkrankungsgipfel sind in der f\u00fcnften Dekade, jedenfalls generell fr\u00fcher wie beim pHPT. Lokale Rezidive sind h\u00e4ufig, ebenso vor allem Lungenmetastasen (40%). Bislang gibt es keine Literaturberichte \u00fcber ein multiglandul\u00e4res, meta-Diagnostik mit Halssonographie, MRT und MIBI-Scinthigraphie sowie ein Venensampling ausw\u00e4rts ergaben ebenfalls keinen Lokalisationshinweis. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wurde bei einem erstmalig angefertigten Routiner\u00f6 ntgen ein 17 mm gro\u00dfer Lungenrundherd im Bereich der linken Lingula erstbeschrieben und als dringlich beobachtenswert eingestuft. Bei neuerlicher MIBI-Scintigraphie und Hals-MRT 2006 ergab sich \u00fc bereinstimmend eine L\u00e4sion am links caudalen Schilddr\u00fcsenpol, intraoperativ fand sich narbiges Gewebe sowie ein nach cervikal reichender Thymusrest, histologisch fanden sich darin maligne Zellen eines neuroendokrinen Tumors. Eine pathohistologische Zweitmeinung aus dem Referenzzentrum ergab \u00fcberraschender Weise sowohl bei den beiden bereits 2000 und 2001 entfernten Epithelk\u00f6rperchen, wie auch im jetzigen OP-Resektat ein Parathyreoideakarzinom mit Kapsel-und Angioinvasion. Eine postoperative Abkl\u00e4rung mit Somatostatin-Rezeptorszintigraphie mit 855 MBq In-111 Octreotide sowie F-18-DOPA-PET ergab keinen Hinweis auf ein neuerliches Geschehen im Hals, jedoch eine diskrete Mehrspeicherung im Lungenrundherd. Somit wurde bei der Patientin im Dezember 2006 mittels Thorakoskopie sowohl der Lungenrundherd wie auch der Thymus entfernt. Es fand sich in der Lunge eine 17 mm gro\u00dfe Metastase des Parathyreoideakarzinoms, keine weiteren Tumorherde im Thymus. Eine Biopsie des Tibiatumors ergab keinen Malignomhinweis. Das postoperative iPTH ist 5 pg=ml, so dass wir von einer derzeitigen Tumorfreiheit ausgehen. Entsprechend der Literatur k\u00f6nnen die Zeitspannen bis zu einem neuerlichen Rezidiv zwischen wenigen Monaten und bis zu 20 Jahren reichen. Jedenfalls soll das niedrige Parathormon f\u00fcr einen weiteren positiven Verlauf sprechen.

Ostermann Klinik f\u00fcr Unfall-, Wiederherstellungs-und Orthop\u00e4dische Chirurgie, Bocholt, Germany Grundlagen. Die Schenkelhalsfraktur ist eine h\u00e4ufige Fraktur des \u00e4lteren Menschen. H\u00e4ufig handelt es sich hierbei um multimorbide Patienten. Ziel der Studie ist die Evaluation von Einflussfaktoren auf die peri-und postoperative Morbidit\u00e4t und Mortalit\u00e4t nach osteosynthetisch und endoprothetisch versorger Schenkelhalsfraktur. Methodik. Zwischen 01=2001 und 12=2005 wurden 311 Patienten (230 w, 81 m) mit 311 Schenkelhalsfrakturen operativ versorgt. Das Durchschnittsalter betrug 77,25 Jahren (9-97Jahre). Es erfolgte die retrospektive Evaluation der pr\u00e4operativ vorhandenen internistischen Begleiterkrankungen. Diese wurden mit den postoperativen Komplikationen korreliert. Der postoperative Beobachtungszeitraum betrug 90 Tage. Eine Multimorbidit\u00e4t im Sinne drei relevanter Vorerkrankungen bestand bei 189 Patienten, eine solit\u00e4re Vorerkrankung lag in 56 F\u00e4llen vor. Lediglich 45 Patienten waren ohne Risikofaktoren. Es dominierten kardiovaskul\u00e4re Erkrankungen gefolgt von Diabetes mellitus und pulmonalen Erkrankungen. 58%) hatten !3 und 62 Patienten (19,94%) nur eine internistische Grunderkrankung. Thirty four Patienten (10,93%) hatten keine Grunderkrankung. Multimorbide Patienten erlitten gegen\u00fcber dem Restkollektiv signifikant h\u00e4ufiger postoperative Komplikationen. Schlussfolgerungen. Schon pr\u00e4operativ ben\u00f6tigen die oft multimorbiden Patienten eine erh\u00f6hte Aufmerksamkeit und die Idendifikation von Risikofaktoren ist notwendig, um den Patienten eine ad\u00e4quate perioperative Vorbereitung und \u00dc berwachung zukommen zu lassen. Wichtig ist eine m\u00f6glichst fr\u00fche operative Versorgung (<24 h bei Endoprothese, <6 h bei Osteosynthese) nach dem Trauma und eine suffizienten Analgetikatherapie, sowohl pr\u00e4operativ als auch postoperativ.

W\u00fc rsching 2 1 Krankenhaus Bietigheim, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany; 2 Porsche Consulting, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany Grundlagen. Zur Pr\u00fcfung der optimalen Nutzung von Ressourcen wurde der Ablauf in unserer Chir. Klinik Bietigheim von einer externen Unternehmensberatung (Porsche Consulting) untersucht. Methodik. Nach einw\u00f6chiger Analysephase mit detaillierter Dokumentation von Patientenwegen, OP-Ablauf, \u00e4rztlicher und pflegerischer T\u00e4tigkeit, wurde dann in einer 2-w\u00f6chigen Workshop-Phase mit Mitarbeitern der Abteilung L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die festgestellten Probleme gesucht. Ergebnisse. Wesentliches Ergebnis war, dass unser ,,Patientendurchlauf'' fast l\u00fcckenlos und ohne Warte-bzw Leerlauftzeiten f\u00fcr Patient und=oder Arzt war. Aber es wurde ein enormer Aufwand an Verschwendung (im Sinne von Lean-Management) ersichtlich, der in Form von Mehrfach-, Dokumentations-, Schreib-und Codierarbeit geleistet wird -sowohl \u00e4rztlich als auch pflegerisch. Optimiert wurden bereits bestehende Standards f\u00fcr den Visitenablauf und unsere Patientenpfade, eingerichtet wurden neu feste Sprechzeiten f\u00fcr Angeh\u00f6rige. Wesentlich vereinfacht wurde auch unsere Bettenplanung, die Stationsverteilung und -belegung (Reduktion von 11 auf 3 Arbeitsschritte!). Insgesamt konnten -neben nicht messbaren deutlichen Verbesserungen und Vereinfachungen in Organisation und Kommunikation -vor allem durch Vermeidung von Doppelarbeit und Umwidmen von nicht \u00e4rztlicher T\u00e4tigkeit sofort etwa 500 h=a freigesetzt werden, die in der Versorgung unserer Patienten fehlen. Bei Umsetzung aller Verbesserungen werden im \u00e4rztlichen und pflegerischen Bereich etwa 2000 h=a frei; dh aber nicht Abbau von Stellen, sondern wieder Schaffung von ,,wertsch\u00f6pfender Arbeit'' -bei uns: mehr Zeit f\u00fcr Aufkl\u00e4rung, Patientenzuwendung und -versorgung, mehr Zeit f\u00fcr Angeh\u00f6rigengespr\u00e4che. Ergebnisse. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Untersuchung durch eine externe, berufsfremde Beratungsfirma sehr sinnvoll und effektiv ist. Wir konnten durch Vereinfachungen in manchen Abl\u00e4ufen erheblich Zeit einsparen, die jetzt zur Patientenversorgung eingesetzt wird und damit sowohl zu einer Qualit\u00e4tssteigerung unserer Arbeit, als auch zu einer besseren Au\u00dfenwirkung und Darstellung unserer Klinik in der Bev\u00f6lkerung f\u00fchrt. Mit der bei uns angewandten Methode des ,,kontinuierlichen Verbesserungsprozesses'' wurden nicht mitgebrachte L\u00f6sungen der Firma Porsche angeboten, sondern durch die berufsfremde Sicht Probleme dargestellt und Fragen aufgeworfen. Passgenaue L\u00f6sungen konnten=mu\u00dften danngecoachet -durch uns selber erarbeitet werden. Schlussfolgerungen. Diese Art von ,,Einsparung'' ist neben K\u00fcrzung von Leistungen oder Erh\u00f6hung der Kassenbeitr\u00e4ge ein bislang zu wenig beschrittener ,,dritter'' Weg und kommt der Forderung einer ,,Leistungsverbesserung statt M\u00e4ngelverwaltung'' nahe. 180 Development of specialisation in a general surgical department 1985-2005 W.

H\u00f6llwarth Universit\u00e4t Klinik f\u00fcr Kinder-und Jugendchirurgie, Graz, Austria Grundlagen. Seit der Erstbeschreibung von \u00d6 sophagusatresie (\u00d6 A) in der Literatur und der ersten erfolgreichen direkten \u00d6 sophagusanastomose konnten wesentliche Ver\u00e4nderungen in Zugang und Methodik beobachtet werden. F\u00fcr die Kinderchirurgie ist eine Behandlung von Kindern mit dieser Fehlbildung noch immer eine Herausforderung. Ziele dieser Studie waren die Evaluierung der Ergebnisse und die Analyse von fr\u00fchen Komplikationen und Folgeerkrankungen nach Wiederherstellung des Speiseweges. Methodik. Von J\u00e4nner 1975 bis Dezember 2005 wurden 99 Patienten mit \u00d6 A mit=ohne tracheo-\u00f6sophagealer Fistel erstbehandelt. Diesbez\u00fcgliche Daten wurden erhoben und ausgewertet. Um Ver\u00e4nderungen anschaulicher zu machen, wurden die Patienten in 2 Gruppen unterteilt: GROUP I (n \u00bc 55) 1975-1989, GROUP II (n \u00bc 44) 1990-2005. Klassifizierungen nach Waterston und Spitz wurden vorgenommen. Informationen bez\u00fcglich Geburt, Typ der \u00d6 A, assoziierter Fehlbildungen, operativer Behandlung, Komplikationen, Folgeerkrankungen, Sterblichkeit und Todesursache wurden verglichen. Ergebnisse. Von 99 Patienten hatten 81 (81,8%) \u00d6 A mit distaler Fistel, 6 (6,1%) reine \u00d6 A, 6 (6,1%) \u00d6 A mit proximaler und distaler Fistel, 4 (4,0%) \u00d6 A mit proximaler Fistel und 2 (2,0%) Fistel ohne \u00d6 A. Die \u00dc berlebensrate in den beiden Perioden stieg von 76,4% auf 90,9% (p \u00bc 0,06). Insgesamt war die \u00dc berlebensarte 82,8%. Im Zeitraum der Studie stieg die \u00dc berlebensrate von Fr\u00fchgeborenen (<37 GA) (60 vs. 81%), von Patienten mit assoziierten Fehlbildungen (66,6 vs. 86,7%) und Patienten mir pr\u00e4operativer Pneumonie (75 vs. 77,8%). Dagegen sank die mittlere Dauer des ersten Krankenhausaufenthaltes (103 vs. 58 d) bzw. des Aufenthaltes auf der Intensivstation (80 vs. 40 d). Die durchschnittliche Dauer der notwendigen k\u00fcnstliche Beatmung konnte reduziert werden (494 vs. 175 h). In GROUP II gab es weniger Patienten mit fr\u00fchen postoperativen Komplikationen: Stenose (88,9 vs. 58,5%; p < 0,05), Leck (13,3 vs. 7,3%), wiederkehrende Fistel (13,3 vs. 7,3%). Bei mehr Patienten in GROUP II wurden gastro\u00f6sophagealer Reflux (74,1 vs. 90,0%) und=oder Tracheomalazie (35,7 vs. 40,0%) diagnostiziert. Schlussfolgerungen. Heute ist die erfolgreiche Behandlung von \u00d6 A in den meisten F\u00e4llen m\u00f6glich. Unvermeidbare Todes-f\u00e4lle werden durch schwere assoziierte Fehlbildungen, speziell durch schwere Herzfehler und andere t\u00f6dliche Fehlbildungen verursacht. \u00dc berlebende leiden vor allem an \u00f6sophagealer Dysmotilit\u00e4t und gastro-\u00f6sophagealem Reflux. 193 Extended modified NUSS procedure following pectus excavatum recurrence R.

Das durchschnittliche Alter war 36.8 Jahre (von 23 bis 73 Jahre) der durchschnittliche Nachuntersuchungszeitraum 73,1 Monate (von 12 bis 133 Monate) Als Ursache konnten vier Motorrad-, drei Auto-und zwei Schiunf\u00e4lle identifiziert werden. Bei f\u00fcnf Patienten resultierte ein oberer, bzw. erweiterter oberer Plexus mit C7 Beteiligung. Bei drei Patienten war eine isolierte untere Plexusl\u00e4sion festzustellen, bei einem Patienten eine globale Plexusl\u00e4sion. Sechs Patienten pr\u00e4sentierten eine unilevel L\u00e4sion, drei Patienten eine multilevel L\u00e4sion. Die Erstversorgung erfolgte durchwegs an einer ausw\u00e4rtigen unfallchirurgischen Abteilung. Der Revisionseingriff erfolgte im Durchschnitt 6,6 Monate nach dem Unfall. Chirurgische Techniken: In Summe wurden bei sechs Patienten \u00c4 ste der Pektoralisnerven als Spendernerven verwendet. Bei zwei Patienten wurde ein selektiver Ulnaristransfer, bei einem anderem ein selektiver Medianustransfer durchgef\u00fchrt. Bei f\u00fcnf Patienten musste ein Nerveninterponat (N. suralis) verwendet werden. Bei einem Patienten musste der M. bizeps brachii mittels eines freien Muskeltransfers ersetzt werden. Analyse: Die retrospektive Analyse inkludierte eine Durchsicht der Operationsberichte, Beurteilung der elektroneurographischen Befunde und schliesslich eine detaillierte Bestandaufnahme des klinischen Istzustandes mittels des British Medical Research Scales (M0-M5), bzw. Beurteilung des aktiven und passiven Bewegungsumfanges mittels der Neutral-Null Methode. Ergebnisse. Bei allen Patienten konnte eine erfolgreiche Reinnervation des Zielorgans festgestellt werden. Bei sechs Patienten war eine suffiziente Kraftentwicklung durch den alleinigen Nerventransfer m\u00f6glich. (M3\u00fe=M4) Bei zwei weiteren war ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Sehnentransfer notwendig. (Trizep-stransfer=Steindler Plastik) Bei einem Patienten musste der Verlust der Muskulatur durch einen freien Muskeltransfer ersetzt werden. Schlussfolgerungen. Selektive Nerventransfers stellen eine exzellente Erweiterung des chirurgischen Armamentariums in der Behandlung traumatischer Plexus brachialis L\u00e4sionen dar. O. C. Aszmann 1 , H. Dietl 2 , M. Frey 1 1 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Vienna, Austria; 2 Department of Research and Development, Otto Bock Healthcare Products, Vienna, AustriaDie Bewegung myoelektrischer Armprothesen erfolgt bis dato \u00fcber 2 transkutane Elektroden welche \u00fcber zwei getrennt innervierte Muskelgruppen angesteuert werden. Die verschiedenen Steuerungsebenen werden durch Kokontraktionen dieser Muskeln angew\u00e4hlt und in der jeweiligen Ebene mit denselben Muskeln gesteuert. Ein harmonischer, dem nat\u00fcrlichen Bewegungsmuster entsprechender Bewegungsablauf ist mit diesem Steuerungsmechanismus nicht m\u00f6glich. Eine wesentliche Verbesserung w\u00e4re eine Ansteuerung der einzelnen Bewegungsebenen mit Signalen welche neuronal mit dem nat\u00fcrlichen Bewegungsablauf \u00fcbereinstimmen. Technisch sind Prothesen mit 6 Steuerungsebenen seit Kurzem realisiert. Ziel ist es einzelne Stammnerven wie N. musculocutaneus, N. radialis, N. axillaris, N. medianus und N. ulnaris aus dem proximalen Armnervengeflecht herauszul\u00f6sen und an verbliebene Nerven\u00e4ste von stammnahen Muskeln zu transferieren. Als Zielmuskeln w\u00fcrden sich alle Muskeln der Rotatorenmanschette und Pectoralis major=minor anbieten. Diese Muskeln w\u00fcrden schlie\u00dflich entsprechend der Aktivit\u00e4t der Spendernerven kontrahieren und \u00fcber transkutane Elektroden die Prothese steuern. Auf diese Weise ist eine harmonische, intuitive dem nat\u00fcrlichen Bewegungsmuster entsprechende Steuerung gew\u00e4hrleistet, ohne dass der Patient st\u00e4ndig zwischen den verschieden Steuerungsebenen wechseln muss.Voraussetzung sind intakte proximale Muskelgruppen und weitgehend intaktes proximales Armnervengeflecht mit der M\u00f6glichkeit Spendernerven entsprechend topographisch anatomisch isolieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Diesbez\u00fcglich ist eine MRI Untersuchung, hochaufl\u00f6sender Ultraschall und bilanzierende NLG und EMG sinnvoll. In der pr\u00e4operativen Planungsphase als auch in der postoperativen Verlaufskontrolle ist gemeinsam mit der Innovationsabteilung der Fa. Otto Bock ein detailliertes Procedere ausgearbeitet worden um m\u00f6glichst sinnvolle Schaltebenen zu schaffen, die Elektrodenpositionierung zu optimieren und auch die Prothesenanbindung zu kl\u00e4ren. Schliesslich ist ein komplexes Rehabilitationsprogramm notwendig um dem Patienten ein optimales Ergebnis zu erm\u00f6glichen.",

Federmann 1 , W.Hermes 2   Background. Inguinal hernia operation is the most common operation in western countries. Very often, it can be performed under non-hospital conditions without any disadvantage to patient or surgeon. But several factors can influence the operation course as well as its economical impact. The knowledge of such factors may improve the preoperative planning and influence the choice of method and hospital or non-hospital treatment.Methods. Between 15.12.2004 an 31.12 2006 we operated 410 hernias (Bassum & Sulingen) in 373 patients with transinguinal preperitoneal hernioplasty (TIPP) using a memory ring armed polypropylene patch (391 Polysoft Hernia Patch TM , 19 individual designed ring-armed patches).",

            "text": "Background. Survival of patients with lung cancer is strongly affected by lymph node metastases. Identification of N2 disease is thus crucial. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of image fusion of positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) with that of CT only and that of PET only for mediastinal lymph node staging in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods. In 35 patients with proven NSCLC a preoperative FDG-PET and CT examination of the body trunk were performed. PET, CT and PET-CT image fusion were evaluated separately; nodal stations were identified according to the mapping system of the American Thoracic Society. A lymph node was considered to be infiltrated by tumor if the minimal diameter was 1cm or more in CT, or the standard uptake value (SUV) was larger than 2.5 in PET. All patients underwent mediastinoscopy, biopsies from 87 lymph node regions were taken (ATS 2 5.7%, ATS 4 65.6%, and ATS 7 28.7%). If primary pulmonary resection was achieved, ipsilateral lymph nodes were dissected and the histological findings were considered for statistical analysis. Histological findings were compared with results of CT, PET and PET-CT image fusion. Sensitivity and specificity were obtained using the confusion matrix.Results. Histopathological assessment revealed 12 positive mediastinal lymph nodes out of 87, sensitivity was 83.3% for CT, 66.6% for PET and 91.7% for image fusion, specificity was 62.6% for CT, 77.3% for PET and 78.6% for PET-CT fusion.Conclusions. PET-CT image fusion improves sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in mediastinal staging of NSCLC patients. The high negative predictive value of PET-CT image fusion (0.983) may abandon mediastinoscopy in NSCLC patients with negative mediastinal PET-CT image fusion. However, larger series are mandatory in order to gain statistical significant power.328 Local resection of stage I primary lung cancer by 1318-nm Nd-YAG laser in functionally inoperable candidates: a prospective study S. B. Watzka 1 , W. Grossmann 2 , P. N. Wurnig 1 , F. Lax 1 , M. R. M\u00fc ller 1 , P. H. Hollaus 1 Background. Hydatid disease is a parasitic infestation by a tapeworm of the genus Echinococcus. It is not endemic Background. In 2000 a pathway regarding the management of liver trauma was established in our hospital. The aim of the study was to assess the outcome after implementation of the guidelines.Methods. Data on all patients with liver injuries managed in our institution in the past 6 years was evaluated. Liver trauma was classified using Moore's trauma score. Additionally, coexisting injuries were assessed.Results. From 2001 to 2006 a total of 57 patients with liver trauma (motor vehicle accidents 44, falls 6, horse riding accidents 3) were admitted to our trauma unit (median age of 37.5 years). Grade III traumas (36.8%) were the most common injuries, followed by Grade IV (28.1%), Grade I (12.3%), Grade II (10.5%), Grade V (8.8%) and Grade VI (1.8%). The laparotomy rate varied from 28.6% in Grade I injuries to 60% in Grade V injuries, resulting in an overall laparotomy rate of 38.6%. Two patients required second look laparotomy for removal of liver packing and one patient required puncture of a posttraumatic bilioma. The most common associated concomitant injuries were right or bilateral rib fractures (27), pelvic fractures (22), long bone fractures (22), laceration of the spleen, spine injuries (19), and head injuries (18). The mortality rate of patients with liver trauma ranged from 25% in Grade IV injuries to 14% in Grade I injuries with an overall mortality rate of 12% (7). All patients with Grade V or Grade VI traumas survived (6). If laparotomy was required because of hemodynamic instability or concomitant abdominal injury the mortality rate increased to 27%.Conclusions. The clinical pathway of management of hepatic trauma in our patients showed favourable results. Apart from the grade of liver injury the overall laparatomy rates and mortality rates largely depend on concomitant injuries. Colitis cystica profunda is a rare benign disorder of the large intestine characterized by submucosal cyst formation. The clinical appearance of the disease can be highly variable; it can be associated with rectal prolapse and chronic inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.We describe a case of colitis cystica profunda associated with rectal prolapse. The female patient had a one-year history of constipation and rectal pain. An Altemeier procedure was performed to correct the rectal prolapse. Histology confirmed the presence of colitis cystica profunda. The operative and postoperative course was uneventful.It should be borne in mind that Colitis cystica profunda can be associated with rectal prolapse. Conservative management is usually satisfactory, but a mucosal resection (Delorme's procedure) or perineal protectomy (Altemeier procedure) is recommended when there is rectal prolapse.P02 Peritonitis ossificans -a rare situation after acute major abdominal surgery M. Ruzicka 1 , S. Thalhammer 2 , S. St\u00e4ttner 2 , M. Mostegel 3 , B. Sobhian 2 , J. Karner 2 Background. Treatment of the congenital intestinal obstruction of newborns is one of the main problems of the pediatric surgery.Methods. Patient P. had been hospitalized to the intensive care unit 2 days after birth with symptoms of absence of stool from birth, frequent vomiting, full-blown abdominal distension. The signs of endotoxicosis, the intestinal loops posterized image through the anterior peritoneal wall, dilatation of the venae anterior peritoneal wall, abdomen lower sections and scrotum edema were noted at the time of admission. X-ray of the abdominal cavity reveals the signs of the low intestinal obstruction, bowel perforation -presence of liquid and free air at the abdominal cavity. Diagnosed -the intestinal obstruction, peritonitis and after a short-term of the preoperative preparation patient underwent surgery. Atresia of the sigmoid colon, necrotic enterocolitis with the affection of the 2=3 of the large bowel, perforation of rising section of the large intestine, the meconium peritonitis were established during surgery. The right side hemicolectome, terminal ileostomy and transverse colostomy. The reoperation at the 11 month was done: ileotransversostomy, descendosigmostomy with the preserving of transverse colostomy were performed. The diameter of the descending large bowel exceeded the diameter of the sigmoid colon by 3-3.5 times, that's why the anastomosis had been raised by the type ''side to side''.Results. Within the course of 2 weeks after the radical surgery the child started to have stool passage through the rectum. Presently the child's condition is satisfactory, the physical development corresponds to the age norms, stool passage takes place only through the rectum. The final stage of the treatment will be the closure of the transverse colostomy with the complete restoring of the passage of the chyme through the bowels.Conclusions. The bringing of the intestinal stomas out with the delayed radical surgery in some case of newborns may significantly improve the prognosis of the results of treatment. Background. Different inguinal hernia operationtechniques must be compared to their recurrency rate, acute and long term complication rate, patients comfort and duration before returning to daily life, return to work and to sports etc. Under economical aspects they should be safe, quick, and require limited resources (personal, equipment, implantate). With increasing economical pressure the latter features gain increasing importance. We therefore made a comparative time analysis between TIPP and Lichtenstein.Methods. Between 1.9.2005 and 30.9.2006 195 Hernias were operated in TIPP technique and 73 hernias in Lichtenstein (LICH) technique. Patients were from an identical district and comparable in epidemiological data, comorbidity, hernia distribution and in-resp outdoor treatment. Each series was performed by 1 surgeon in the same operation unit. Implantates used were Polysoft Hernia Patch TM (TIPP) and Ultrapro Mesh TM (LICH). Total operation time was recorded (min). Additionally, 4 operation phases were defined:Opening phase: from skin split to Preparation phase: from opening of the external aponeurosis to introduction of the mesh Repair phase: from introduction of the mesh to the end of the suture of the external aponeurosis Closing phase: end of repair phase to skin closure.Assuming individual differences between the surgeons and management-associated differences as well as intermethodical differences relative phase intervals were deduced from the original recordings and compared. Statistical comparison was done by t-Test and Pearson correlation coefficient.Results. Average operation time of LICH was 61 AE 14.6 min (range 41-127 min, median 59 min), average operation time of TIPP 29.29 AE 9.83 min (range 16-73 min, median 27 min). Up to now there was 1=163 recurrent hernia in TIPP and 0=73 in LICH (n.s.). The correlation of preparation phase time and operation time was high (Pearson coefficient: TIPP 0.890; LICH 0.906) and lower for repair phase (TIPP 0.655; LICH 0.529). There was no difference in the correlation of the preparation phases in TIPP and LICH (p < 0.05). On this basis we estimated the expected time of the compared method to each series, i.e. presumable time for LICH in TIPP series and vice versa. Comparison of LICH vs. TIPP (expected) and LICH (expected) vs. TIPP revealed that TIPP was faster and required 92.2% time of LICH (p < 0.05).Conclusions. TIPP and LICH show a comparable time effort towards preparation, TIPP is significant faster in repair phase enabling a quicker total operation time.P23 Transinguinal preperitoneal hernioplasty (TIPP) using a memory ring armed polypropylene patch: which factors influence the operation?Quality of life improved significantly in all patients with clip displacement.Conclusions.

Peptic ulcer in the excluded segment of a gastric bypass has been reported in the literature in only 17 cases. We report a 54-year-old woman with a perforated duodenal ulcer, who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity 15 months ago.Methods. On physical examination, the patient's abdomen was marginally tender to palpation. Laboratory findings were unremarkable except for an elevated leucocyte count of 11.200=ml (normal 4.000-10.000=ml). Abdominal radiography and sonography showed no pathology. Because of the persistent abdominal pain we performed an abdominal computed tomography scan, which demonstrated free air.Results. She was successfully treated by a laparoscopic repair of the perforated duodenal ulcer. After surgery, a standardized analgesic regimen was administered for pain relief. Intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam was continued for at least 4 days, then a Helicobacter eradication therapy was performed. Feeding was resumed on the first postoperative day and the patient was discharched on day six without any complications.Conclusions. Peptic ulcer in the excluded segment of a gastric bypass has been reported in the literature in 17 cases. The pathogenesis of ulcer perforations in the excluded sto-mach=duodenum is unclear. Of the 18 total cases, free air in the abdominal radiography was only noted in one case. Recognizing that free air under the diaphragm will be absent is one of the most important diagnostic considerations when gastric or duodenal ulcer perforation is suspected in the postgastric bypass patient. Abdominal CT scan and early surgical exploration remain the treatment of choice.Chirurgische Forschung P32 Blood interleukin 12 as preoperative predictor of fatal postoperative sepsis after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy Background. A serious impediment in transplantation medicine especially after liver-transplantation is the damage by ischemia and reperfusion. We compared different types of reperfusion within a rat model and investigated the different consecutive ischemia=reperfusion injuries.Methods. Arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was performed in syngenic male Lewis rats. The animals were divided into 3 experimental groups: I-and II-control groups with antegrade reperfusion and group III with retrograde reperfusion. Laboratory parameters as well as histopathological changes of the liver-graft-tissue were evaluated 1, 24 and 48 hours after OLT.Results. The GOT-values showed 24 hours after OLT significant differences between group I=II (antegrade reperfusion) and group III (retrograde reperfusion) (2613.3 AE 343.9 U=l vs. 1186.4 AE 252.9 U=l; p < 0.001). GPT-as well as GOT-values were significantly lower in group III (retrograde reperfusion) 48 hours after OLT. Evaluation by histopathology revealed significant less areas of necrotic liver tissue within group III compared to group I=II (p < 0.002).Conclusions. These results show that the retrograde reperfusion (by order of: infrahepatic inferior vena cava -opening suprahepatic inferior vena cava -hepatic veins -retrograde reperfusion of the liver) has a protective effect on the graft in regard to the ischemia=reperfusion injury. Background. Clamping of internal carotid artery during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) leads to cerebral ischemia in 8-15% of patients. Routine carotid shunting has a high morbidity as described in literature. Selective carotid shunting under general anaesthesia requires an intraoperative monitoring. The registration of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) is a well accepted technique.Methods. From 2002 to 2006 we assessed prospectively 477 consecutive CEA under general anaesthesia and SEP monitoring, without primary shunting. Routinely preoperative neurological assessment, duplex sonography and MR-angiography were performed. The onset of a clinical neurological deficit after carotid artery clamping was related to changes in the N20=P25 waveforms in SEP-recording. SEP was evoked by stimulating median nerve. Criteria for shunting was reduction in SEP-amplitude >50%. Routinely postoperative neurological examination and duplex sonography were performed.Results. 477 patients underwent CEA between 2002 and 2006. Intraoperativ SEP-monitoring was available in 390 patients. In 14 patients (3.6%) SEP-monitoring was inadequate (primary shunting). In 330 procedures (87.8%) SEP-monitoring didn't show deviations. Significant SEP-alterations appeared in 46 of 376 cases (12.2%). In 42 cases SEP-alterations normalised after shunting without neurological deficits. In 4 cases SEP-alterations were reversible after shunting, but were associated with postoperative neurological deficits (2 permanent, 2 transient). 10 cases (2.6%) had normal SEP-findings (false negative), but postoperative neurological deficit occurred (7 permanent, 3 transient).Conclusions. The selective use of carotid shunting during CEA requires an intraoperative monitoring technique. Based on our data and literature findings, SEP-monitoring is a reliable method to prevent neurological vascular deficits and effectively minimizes shunting frequency.P42 Perioperative changes in internal carotid endarterectomy P.

Poland syndrome is seen in 1=30 000 of the newborns. It can declare itself by its different components and joining of the additional defects in every concrete patient.Methods. A girl, born by the Cesarean section, with the weight of 2930 g and 39 week gestational age was brought to the pediatric surgery clinic on the 25.10.02 in a couple of hours after birth. When examined the skewness and chest distortion attracted attention, especially on the right side. The oval form defect of the chest wall 5\u00c2 6 cm 2 was seen in the anterior of the chest parasternal on the right in the II rib level from the costal margin, an also thinning of body of sternum. A part of liver with the size of 5\u00c2 1.5 cm 2 covered with peritoneum was projecting form the lower part of the latter. A gastric part of the heart, covered with pericardium and non-epithelized membrane with the upper part directed to the right was projecting over it from the defect. There were no signs of heart and respiratory failure. During the echocardiography the following was discovered: heart rotation in the chest, right ventricular and atrial hypertrophy, good running of the great vessels, not violated valve function and good myocardial contractility. Ejection fraction from the left ventricle 68%. During the intraoperative inspection the diaphragm defect in the right place parasternal triangle with the size of 4\u00c2 5 cm 2 through which the part of liver prolapses. The hepatic lobectomy was done as well as diaphragma defect repair.Results. In eight months the plastic operation was done on the defect through the replacement of the front edge of the costal arch and musculocutaneous flap, formed from the greater pectoral muscle. The child was discharged from the hospital in a good shape.Plastische, \u00c4 sthetische und Rekonstruktive Chirurgie Background. Traditional abdominoplasty aims at elimination of redundant fat tissue and skin as well as tightening of muscular aponeurosis on the abdomen. In the massive weight loss (MWL) patient this procedure often yields only mediocre results. Specific areas such as hips, buttocks and the lateral thigh are addressed inadequately.Methods. Patients after MWL are treated with a central or lower body lifting according to the specific needs at our institu-tion. The central body lift includes a circumvertical dermolipectomy concentrated on the central torso without significant mobilisation of caudal tissues. In the lower body lift, the circumvertical dermolipectomy is located more inferior on the torso with an additional extensive mobilisation of the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the knee.Results. These new innovative techniques led to a much improved contour and results compared to the traditional abdominoplasty procedure. Although there is an increase in operative time, postoperative recovery and complications appear comparable according to our initial limited experience. We present in detail representative cases with step-by-step explanation of operative techniques.Conclusions. Especially after MWL, such as after bariatric surgery, the surgeon has to deal with a tremendous amount of redundant tissue on the lower part of the torso and thighs. Traditionally this problem was solved in a staged manner with multiple surgeries, such as abdominoplasty, buttock lift or medial thigh lift. However, in many cases this approach led to unsatisfying results. New innovative techniques allow for an optimal repositioning of the descended tissues und most often to a much improved postoperative result compared to the traditional techniques.",

Thirty one adults with a mean age of 24 (18-39.2) suffering from pectus excavatum have been corrected using by the extended modified minimally invasive repair method. The Ravitch= Welsh=Rehbein Technique, performed elsewhere, has corrected 2 patients insufficiently. Reduced physical capacity, mild cardiac valve dysfunctions (prolapse, pulmonary valve insufficiency), chest pain in the area of the funnel and reduced ventilatory function were detected. Two thirds of the patients emphasized the wish of a better cosmetic result. Preoperative investigations include blood samples, ECG, heart sonography, chest X-ray, chest MRI=CT with 3-D reconstruction and spirometry.Methods. Retrosternal mobilization and intraoperative stretching of the anterior thorax by long lasting sternal elevation modified the original NUSS technique. Additionally an oblique wedge shaped partial sternal osteotomy and=or osteotomies of the ossificated ribs were performed. In adults usually 2 Pectus pars (PS -Implant + Fa. Hofer Austria) should be used.Results. Due to preparation we observed 1 intraoperative bleeding episode from the internal mammaric vessels, 1 superficial lesion of the right visceral pleura (adhesions). Postoperatively we saw 5 pleural effusions, 1 subcutaneous hematoma and two prolonged wound-healing episodes (superficial infections with no necessity of bar removal). Vertebral Index changed from 33.3 preoperatively to a normal range of 23.7 postoperatively. Postoperative cosmetic results were perfect in 90%. In summary adults with Pectus excavatum are manageable with extremely satisfactory results using the described extended modified correction technique. Osteotomies do not destabilize the chest and can be sufficiently combined with the NUSS technique. Background. Minimal invasive AV-valve surgery is an increasingly popular procedure in cardiac surgery, but -due to the complexity -still reserved to few selected centers.

            "text": "Methods. A total of 76 minimal invasive AV-valve procedures were performed by a single surgeon and were successful in 75 (98.7%). Seventy one patients (94.7%) underwent AV-valve repair, 4 (5.3%) received mitral valve replacement. In 10 patients (13.3%), concomitant ASD closure and=or tricuspid valve repair had to be performed. One intraoperative conversion to valve replacement had to be performed due to residual mitral regurgitation. For calculation of learning curves, regression models with logarithmic curve fit for operating time (OT), aortic cross-clamp (AXT) and cardio-pulmonary bypass time (CPBT) for all patients and for patients with posterior mitral leaflet prolapse were applied.Results. Within approximately 30 consecutive minimal invasive procedures, a steady decline of either OT, AXT and CPBT could be observed for the overall surgical population even despite the increasing number of concomitant procedures and was similar in patients with posterior mitral leaflet prolapse. After overcoming this steep learning curve, a mean AXT of 116 AE 45 min, a CBP time of 165 AE 46 min and a total OT of 285 AE 45 min is required to treat isolated posterior leaflet prolapse.Conclusions. Minimal invasive AV-valve surgery can be safely introduced into a heart surgery program. However, sufficient number of cases per year are required per surgeon to come over this learning curve. Case report. A 43-year-old male patient without clinical symptoms presented an enlarged heart shadow in a routine radiological examination. The following CT revealed a structure in the pericardial sac that was initially classified as a pericardial cyst. In order to confirm the diagnosis, an ECG-triggered multi-slice CT was performed resulting in the diagnosis of a gigantic coronary fistula originating from the left main coronary artery leading to the right atrium. The shunt volume of the coronary fistula was estimated to be 50%. Echocardiography demonstrated dilatation of the right chambers due to volume overload. Since operative mortality was deemed extremely low in this patient surgical correction was advised. After median thoracotomy, initiation of heart lung machine and extensive cardioplegia, the coronary fistula was identified to originate from the left main coronary artery meandering around the posterior side of the left heart with a mean diameter of 2 cm and entering the right atrium at the level of the vena cava superior. The fistula was ligated in the right atrium and at its origin at the branching site of the circumflex artery. To secure optimal surgical outcome bypass grafting was performed to LAD (left anterior descending) and its diagonal branch as well as the circumflex artery. Postoperatively performed ECG-triggered multislice-CT evidenced successful repair of this anatomical malformation. The postoperative course was uneventful. Background. To document severity of illness and to evaluate the predictive value of clinical scoring systems in infants and children after cardiac surgery. Prospective study with follow up to hospital discharge. A 12 bed multidisciplinary paediatric ICU in a University Hospital. Between 1=1990 and 12=2006 1463 infants and children were admitted after open heart surgery.Methods. Data relevant to the Acute Physiologic Score for Children (APSC), Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM III), Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS 28) and Organ System Failure (OSF) score were collected in all patients during the first 4 days of postoperative intensive care. Eighty one percentages of the patient underwent a total repair, 19% had a palliative correction.Results. The mean age of the patients was 4.0 AE 5.5 years. There were 1416 survivors (s) and 49 non survivors (ns). The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 4.8 AE 16.8 days for survivors and 8.9 AE 8.8 days for non survivors. On the first postoperative day the mean APSC and PRISM III scores of survivors and non survivors were 7.04 AE 4.9 vs. 19.9 AE 9.2 (p < 0.0001) and 1.61 AE 3.3 vs. 11.5 AE 10.7 (p< 0.0001), respectively. The mean TISS 28 and OSF scores of survivors and non survivors were 31.7 AE 12.0 vs. 42.2 AE 15.7 (p< 0.0001), and 1.12 AE 0.89 vs. 2.5 AE 1.91 (p< 0.0001), respectively. The overall hospital mortality rate was 3.3%. Patients with an APSC score <10 and a PRISM score <4 had a survival rate of 99%, whereas patients with an APSC score >26 and a PRISM score >20 had a mortality rate of 81%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for APSC, PRISM, OSF and TISS was 0.889, 0.893, 0.898 and 0.729, respectively.Conclusions. APSC, PRISM and TISS describe accurately the severity of illness in infants and children after cardiac surgery, and all physiologic scores identify those patients at increased risk for mortality.P62 Non-bacterial pyopericardium leading to lethal sepsis in a patient with severe humoral immunodeficiency K. M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1 , I. Knez 1 , B. Rigler 1 , G. P. Tilz 2 1 Klinische Abteilung f\u00fcr Herzchirurgie, Graz, Austria; 2 Abteilung f\u00fcr klinische Immunologie, Graz, AustriaBackground. Pyopericardium is the accumulation of pus in the pericardium mainly caused by bacterial infection. Purulent pericarditis most commonly occurs as a direct extension of an infection from an adjacent pneumonia or empyema. Alternatively, a distant infection can haematogenously seed the pericardium. Primary pericardial infection is rather rare. Pyopericardium is an illness requiring acute intervention by the heart surgeon (pericardial drainage) and adequate medication.Methods. A 55-year-old man was admitted with diffuse chest pain, dyspnoea, tachycardia and nausea. Laboratory examination revealed massive leukocytosis and elevation of Creactive protein. Echocardiogram showed circumferential pericardial effusion without valvular vegetations. After a subsequent clinical impairment to a highly septic state, he underwent surgical pericardial drainage. The pericardium was full of pus of creamy aspect. After continuous pericardial lavage and operative revision in several steps, final sternal closure took place ten days later. No infectious agent could be identified to be responsible for the purulent pericarditis.At the term of next surgery, 1.5 litres of serous ascites and 0.5 litres of serous pericardial effusion were drained. The patient developed a gangrenous cholecystitis, op-site findings revealed a non-purulent ascites, intra-operative cholangiography was without pathological findings.Results. Detailed immunological analysis showed a severe decompensated immunodeficiency with adentritocytaemia. The therapy with polyvalent immunoglobulin and imutin was ineffective, the patient died one day later from a therapy-refractory septic shock.Conclusions. In cases with unclear non infectious purulent pericarditis, it is of high importance to carry out the correct diagnosis as soon as possible to provide an adequate therapy. Background. Early results of MI treatment of proximal humeral fractures using the NCB + -PH plate showed promising results reaching 62 points (86% of age related normal value) in the Constant Score 6 months postoperatively and an acceptable complication rate (23.5%). The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results focusing on functional outcome and complications.Methods. So far out of a total number of 90 cases we have gained the data of 35 patients (24 women, 11 men; age 68 in the mean) who sustained fractures of the proximal humerus treated MI with the NCB-PH + plate (Zimmer Company, Winterthur, Switzerland). In 16 cases (46%) osteoporosis had been diagnosed preoperatively. Radiological follow-up in two planes and functional outcome is assessed clinically (ROM) and using visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and function, Constant Score and a modified adl score (activities of daily living).Results. Average ROM (in degree) for anteversion was 101, glenohumeral abduction 87, external rotation 31 and internal rotation 81. Average VAS for pain was 1, 9 points (10 \u00bc worst) and for function 6, 4 points (10 \u00bc best). Average Constant Score was 65 points, average adl score was 16 points (30 \u00bc best). Between 6 and 12 months postoperatively one case (2, 9%) of sintering of the humeral head and one case (2, 9%) of avascular necrosis was detected. In 3 cases (9%) of reversed impingement we performed total removal of hardware. Four younger patients (11%; age 60 in the average) underwent the same procedure demanding it though not suffering of limited ROM or pain.Conclusions. In the early results NCB-PH + proved to be an effective MI method of treatment of fractures of the humeral head. The 1 year follow up data show further functional improvement (approx. 5% of Constant Score). The complication rate remains low (5=35 \u00bc 14%). Especially, no cases of lesions of the axillary nerve or frozen shoulder were seen. The latter we believe is due to the MI procedure and the early functional treatment which is possible since the NCB-PH + plate creates high primary stability. The long-term results prove the NCB-PH + plate to be a safe and effective method of treatment reaching a functional outcome that enables the mostly old patients to regain an acceptable level of activity. Removal of hardware is easy to perform and offers especially in the younger patient a possibility to at least improve patients' subjective outcome. ",
