Results First case: Mr V is a 78-year-old man who was prescribed a 3-week course of ertapenem for management of a prostatitis caused by multidrug-resistant extended-spectrum-\u00df-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. At day 6, he came to the emergency department with delusions, hallucinations and blurred vision. The therapy by ertapenem was interrupted at day 9 and the disorders resolved in 48-72 h. Second case: Mr M is a 89-year-old man treated with ertapenem for management of a cellulitis. At day 4, he presented an alteration of consciousness with confusion and hallucinations. No symptomatic improvement was observed despite treatment with levomepromazine. Ertapenem was stopped at day 6 and, within three days, the hallucinations resolved and he returned to his baseline mental status. Discussion & Conclusion A review of the literature on the subject showed that three similar cases were published: each time, patients were treated with neuroleptics (haloperidol or risperidone) without efficacy, and mental status returned to its base in 72 h after stopping ertapenem. In all cases, patients had no psychiatric history. Hallucination is a rare adverse event estimated at a frequency less than 1/10,000, therefore, classified as very rare. However, ertapenem is a recent antibiotic and pharmacovigilance data are scanty. In the same family of antibiotics, cases of hallucinations are mentioned in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) of imipenem-cilastatin, primarily through overdoses, less often at therapeutic doses. In our two cases, patients had normal renal clearances.",

Our aim was to determine the potential utility of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in overweight patients in the Cockroft-Gault equation (CG), abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula (aMDRD) and 24-h creatinine clearance (24CrCl). Materials & Methods A 60-years old man with a body mass index of 32.5 kg/m 2 , arterial hypertension, type II diabetes and dyslipidemia, was admitted in our hospital because of right cruralgia and left sciatica. He was a heavy smoker (60-pack-year). The lung tumour was diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer cT 2 N 2 M 1 with bone and brain metastasis. He benefited a right hip prosthesis associated with curettage, vertebroplasty and radiotherapy. The patient underwent chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 and carboplatin at AUC of 6 mg.min/ml (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) day 1 every 3 weeks. Results The first course, serum creatinine (Scr) was 55lmol/l and GFR calculated by CG and aMDRD were respectively 184.3 ml/min and 140.3 ml/min. Carboplatin dose (CD) were 1300 mg and 990 mg, it's a high doses unusually prescribed. The oncologist in charge of the patient decided to reduce the dose by 50% (600 mg). To maximize the safety and efficacy of CD, the pharmacist advised to carry out 24CrCl. The second course, SCr was 48 lmol/l. Using CG, aMDRD and 24CrCl, the GFR and CD were 204.5; 164.2 and 151.5 ml/min and 1,380, 1,140 and 1,060 mg, respectively. The third course, Scr was 54 lmol/l, GFR and CD were 174.9; 143.3 and 87.5 lmol/l and 1200; 1000 and 680 mg respectively. Because of performance status that was not good, the patient received only 650 and 570 mg at the second and third course.

In comparison to 24CrCl, the influence of body weight in CG tended to overpredict GFR. An excess of fat mass provokes a reduction in daily creatinine urine excretion per body kilo weight and is responsible for overestimated renal function. Consequently, CD calculated by Calvert is overestimated. On the other hand, aMDRD does not include weight and is more accurate than CG in patient with obesity. However, the accuracy of 24CrCl should be used in hospitalized patients with obesity. The prescription of CD in obese patient should be approved by oncologist, nephrologist and pharmacist together.",

It is also usefull for patients with severe side effects with others antipsychotics drugs. Its use is however limited by the high risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis and requires regular and strict white blood count (WBC). Lithium carbonate, used in first line treatment in bipolar disorder, has an opposite side effect: leukocytosis. Several studies show encouraging results about the use of the combination of clozapine and lithium carbonate to prevent the risk of agranulocytosis. However, could premature discontinuation of lithium increase this risk? Materials & Methods Our presence in a psychiatry unit has resulted in the retrospective study of a case of agranulocytosis with clozapine following the discontinuation of lithium. Results Mrs. R., 35, suffered from bipolar disorder. After the inefficiency of various neuroleptic drugs (loxapine, olanzapine, amisulpride) and mood stabilizers including lithium, clozapine treatment was initiated.

Discussion & Conclusion Despite having good tolerance, the Sm153lexidronam treatment showed no efficacy for our patient. This can be explained by the very advanced stage of the cancer. Usually, metabolic radiotherapy is used as the last solution for the treatment of painful bone metastases.

Unfortunately, there is no published data available about the tolerance of metabolic radiotherapy after multiple myelotoxic treatments such as external radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Keywords Antalgic treatment, Bone metastases, Metabolic radiotherapy Introduction The first series of jaw osteonecrosis (ON) with intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates (BP) was published in 2003. Jaw ON is the first long-term complication of BP treatment, it is the growth of the necrotic bone outside the oral cavity of patients who are receiving or have received BP treatment. Since then, multiple cases were published for IV BP treatment but very little with oral BP treatment for osteoporosis patients or patients with Paget's disease. Materials & Methods During the last three months, in our Hospital, 3 cases of ON with BP have been reported to the National Adverse Event Reporting System. A retrospective study of these three cases and a literature review were conducted in order to compare patients' data with the data presented in the different published studies. Results Among these 3 patients, 2 have received oral BP treatment (ibandronate and alendronate) for osteoporosis, and 1 has received oral BP treatment (zoledronate) for malignant hypercalcemia due to thyroid cancer. This patient's case matches the literature data, she had two major risk factors: an IV BP treatment and a pathology with cancer. On the other hand, only one risk factor was found for one of the two patients treated with oral BP: taking steroids for polyarthritis treatment. Maxillary ON appeared after dental surgery in the 3 cases and were followed by persistent bacterial infections which required antibiotics treatment. The 3 patients underwent a surgical treatment with sequestrectomy in order to control ON. However, oral BP treatment was not immediately suspected and re-evaluated, for the 2 patients concerned, BP treatments were stopped during their hospitalization within the internal medicine department in order to manage infectious complications.",

This low prevalence could be due to underestimated cases, explained by a low rate of reports by physicians who are still unaware of the risk of ON with oral BP. Regarding these 3 patients, the suspicion of BP responsibility and thus the re-evaluation of the relevance to continue the treatment was slow in coming. The presence of clinical pharmacists within medical care units could enable physicians to be alerted on this risk of adverse effect and thus to be encouraged to report them. The occurrence of ON of the jaw with BP is uncommon, but it is a potentially serious complication which involves multidisciplinary care and which could be avoided with precautionary measures especially during dental surgery in patients with oral or IV BP.",

Like most \u00df-lactams, flucloxacillin is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Flucloxacillin is a highly water soluble molecule, with low molecular size (453 kDa), which implies high permeability through renal tubular walls. Furthermore, flucloxacillin is a rather strong organic acid with a pKa value of 2.7, thus is ionized at physiological pH. Once flucloxacillin has reached the tubular fluid by filtration, it will act as a nonreabsorbable anion and result in more sodium reabsorption in exchange for potassium.",

The electrocardiogram normalized 14 h later. Voriconazole (300 mg twice a day) and methadone at a lower dose (10 mg twice a day) were restarted. No other episode of cardiac arrhythmia occurred and 8 days after the reintroduction of both drugs, methadone plasma concentration was 0.57 mg/L while voriconazole serum concentration was 5.5 mg/L. Discussion & Conclusion Voriconazole is extensively metabolized mainly by the polymorphically expressed CYP2C19 isoenzyme and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Voriconazole is also an inhibitor of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Esomeprazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C19 and substrate of 3A4 and 2C9. Co-administration of voriconazole and esomeprazole leads to a twoway interaction which results in an increase of levels of both drugs. Metabolism and clearance of racemic methadone are stereoselective, highly variable and has been attributed to CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and more recently also to CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Therefore, co-administration of methadone and voriconazole may result in a considerable increase of methadone plasma concentrations and related toxicity. Physicians should be aware of the interaction between voriconazole, esomeprazole and methadone leading potentially to severe arrhythmia. Careful drug monitoring should be performed when co-administration of these drugs cannot be avoided. Keywords antifungal medication, arrhythmia, bigeminism, invasive aspergillosis",

Drug-induced agranulocytosis is characterized by a neutrophil number decrease under 0.5 9 10 9 /l, and in serious forms under 0.1 9 10 9 /l, which mostly occurs in patients treated with antibiotics, antithyroid and antiplatelet agents. Here we report a case of drug-induced agranulocytosis caused by venlafaxin and/or clindamycin. Materials & Methods An 88-year-old woman was hospitalized in an orthopedic surgery unit for a streptococcal acute arthritis on her total knee prosthesis, associated with bacteraemia. Oral clindamycin was started on January, 3rd 2010, in replacement of the intravenous antibiotics treatment with cefepime and teicoplanin. She presented an episode of major depression and on January, 13th 2010, venlafaxin was introduced at 37.5 mg/day, then increased to 75 mg/day sixteen days later. On February 7th 2010, eight days later, the patient presented fever and shiver. A blood study was conducted in which neutrophil disappearance and positive bacteraemia, identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected. Clindamycin and venlafaxin were stopped immediately (hematological adverse events are known for both these drugs). Other treatments that were taken since a long time ago were continued. Results Bone marrow examination confirmed the hypothesis of toxic agranulocytosis because of a ''myeloid blocking'' at the stage of promyelocyte. Treatment with hematopoietic growth factor (lenograstim), one injection/day, associated with a new antibiotic therapy (linezolide, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin), was started. The patient's granulocytes number increased quickly after the hematopoietic growth factor treatment during 3 days, and the removal of both above-mentioned drugs. Blood cell counts were completely normal on February, 12th 2010.",

Drug-induced agranulocytosis is mediated either by a direct toxicity with destruction of myeloid cells (dose dependent of the drug or the metabolite) which appears during treatment (low doses are sometimes tolerated), or by an immune/allergic reaction (dose independent) requiring a first contact. To explain this toxicity, we deeply suspect a direct toxicity of venlafaxin, whose dose was increased few days before agranulocytosis occurrence. Literature review showed a similar case reported in 2000 [1] . We can although suspect toxicity of clindamycin because several cases are found in the literature. Clinical evolution of agranulocytosis was favorable with treatment. Lenograstim was found to be useful to shorten the duration to standard blood count recovery without major toxicity.

            "text": "Introduction Eculizumab (E) was approved to reduce haemolysis and improve quality of life in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). E is a new, biological and expensive drug with a high budget impact. The experience in clinical practice with E is limited. We describe the efficacy and adverse events of eculizumab in a case of PNH after 1 year of treatment. Materials & Methods Medical chart review focused on laboratory findings, pharmaco-therapeutic profile and clinical evolution was in a University Hospital. Clinical data included: blood counts lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) level, transfusions requirements as well as symptoms of nocturnal haemoglobinuria, asthenia, fatigue, dysphagia, abdominal pain and erectile dysfunction. Pharmaceutical data included: number of doses and direct costs. Data record included patient's demographics characteristics and adverse events. Results A 41 years old white man was diagnosed with PNH on 2003 without transfusions requirements He started treatment with corticoids, iron and folinic acid.He refused treatment with oral anticoagulant. On 2006 he suffered an ictus stroke and then he initiated treatment with acenocumarol. The patient continued with active haemolysis and other symptoms as: fatigue, asthenia and severe haemoglobinuria. For this reason, the haematologist applied for Therapeutic and Pharmacy Committee and Medical Direction consent to apply E treatment on December 2008. Finally patient initiated treatment with eculizumab in March 2009 and received meningococcal vaccine previously. Their clinical and analytical parameters were at baseline: LDH 5430 UI/L, Haemoglobin 10 g/ dL, platelet count 132x109/L, total bilirrubine 2, 3 mg/dl, direct bilirrubine0, 25 mg/dL, and severe haemoglobinuria. This chronic treatment was administrated 900 mg weekly for two weeks and 600 mg weekly thereafter. After one week of treatment, LDH decreased to 500 UI/L (normal range) and others parameters remained on similar range. Actually, patient maintains his transfusions independence, his LDH is in range and he doesn't have fatigue or haemoglobinuria. However haemolysis parameters continue without changes. The patient has suffered only mild adverse events: headache (after two administrations) and lumbar pain. Direct cost of treatment with E has been 409.400 \u20ac during this year. Discussion & Conclusion In our patient, E has been well tolerated and has controlled symptoms of PNH for first year of treatment. Due to high cost of E, it is very important that pharmacist and haematologist evaluate together the cost-efficacy of this type of drugs. Pharmacists should get involved in the individualised monitoring of these new expensive biological therapies Introduction Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital (Paris, France), specializing in disease infections, was one of the adult reference centers during 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). Antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhalated zanamivir was recommended for patients who were at risk of complications. Some critically ill patients were not responding to conventional treatment because they required another route of administration or a resistance to treatment was suspected. With the help of clinical pharmacist these patients were eligible for enrollment in a French compassionate program to receive intravenous (IV) zanamivir provided on French temporary authorization of use. Materials & Methods Retrospective data analysis of patients treated with IV zanamivir (medical record) and description of the pharmaceutical care and monitoring: demographic data, risk factors, severity of illness, oseltamivir and IV zanamivir doses, treatment duration, clinical and viral responses assessment, antiviral therapy safety. Results Between April and December 2009, 52 patients were hospitalized in intensive care unit with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A virus, 5 patients (9.6%) were included in the compassionate program for 10 days of treatment. One patient presented no risk factor for severe influenza A virus, 2 patients (40%) had one and 2 others patients 2 risk factors (chronic pulmonary disease, immunocompromised status, obesity, diabetes mellitus). All patients required mechanical ventilation. Patients were all first treated with oseltamivir within 24 h after the beginning of symptoms according recommendations. When the IV zanamivir was initiate, the median of oseltamivir treatment duration was 6 days [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and a persistent virological failure was observed for all patients. They received 600 mg of IV zanamivir twice a day except 1 pt who beneficiate of a dose adaptation on pharmaceutical advice because of severe renal failure. Two more critically patients (40%) received simultaneously oseltamivir and IV zanamivir. At the end of the antiviral treatment, 4 patients (80%) had a virological cure. The median treatment duration to obtain viral reversion was 8 days [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "Introduction Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder. It is due to a glucocerebrosidase deficiency that leads to an accumulation of its substrate, glucocerebroside in macrophages. This accumulation produces systemic disorders such as hepatomegalia, splenomegalia, bone complications, neurological problems, anemia and thrombopenia. Two drugs are used to treat patients. Miglustat that decreases glucocerebroside rates and mainly imiglucerase that constitutes an enzyme replacement therapy. Imiglucerase is given by infusion every two weeks in advanced forms of the disease. Its efficacy is objectivised by a decrease in chitotriosidase blood rates. From July 2009 to January 2010 an imiglucerase shortage in supply occurred because of a viral contamination in the production plant. The aim of this study is to assess consequences of treatment withdrawal in our patients during this period. Materials & Methods Biological and clinical datas (haemoglobin rate, platelet count, ferritin and chitotriosidase rates) of five patients with Gaucher disease type I (most frequent) were collected. Results Four men and one female, with a median age of 52 years [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] were followed. There was no significant change in platelet count, haemoglobin and ferritin rates in our patients. Chitotriosidase rate increased in three patients (30% to 80% according patient). Clinical signs worsening was not observed except for one patient who presented asthenia. During the imiglucerase supplying failure, none of our patients have been treated by miglustat as rescue medication.",

The patient was admitted with a 30-days history of tibia rash, slight increase in serum transaminase and mild fever. He had received allopurinol 200 mg daily for 5 months for asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. Results His laboratory data showed mild leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, marked increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and serum creatinine concentration. Hepatitis B and C, and autoimmune hepatitis were ruled out. Abdominal ultrasound and scans were normal. Bone marrow aspiration showed hypocellular pancytopenia without any finding compatible with malignancy. Allopurinol was stopped and he was started on prednisolone and hemodialysis due to the progression of renal dysfunction. The consultant dermatologist suspected Varicella Zoster Virose and the patient was treated with acyclovir 200 mg twice daily. The skin rash, serum transaminases, and bone marrow suppression improved gradually and the patient became afebrile. At this time, allopurinol was restarted with a dose of 50 mg every other day by another physician and 2 days the same clinical and laboratory changes occured again. All these findings improved again upon allopurinol discontinuation by clinical pharmacist. Discussion & Conclusion Renal impairment, diuretic use, male sex, and some opportunistic viral infections such as herpes viruses have been proposed as risk factors to induce AHS. Our patient had at least three risk factors including male sex, taking high dose allopurinol in the presence of renal impairment and concomitantly HSV-infection. To date, there are some cases of AHS characterized by raise of transeaminase with leukocytosis and eosinophilia. Leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia were infrequently attributed to allopurinol therapy. Our patient showed bone marrow depression without the presence of any other justifiable cause and his bicytopenia improved upon allopurinol discontinuation. Allopurinol withdrawal play major role in controlling AHS. Management consists of supportive care. Corticosteroids have been used controversially.

Our study shows that nearly one fifth of urine samples positive for cocaine also contain lidocaine which is consistent with previous studies. By its action on the GABAergic system, lidocaine in excessive quantity leads to cardiovascular disorders and central nervous system overstimulation with the appearance of tremors, agitation, or seizures. Regarding cardiac side effects and the severity of lidocaine overdosage, a rapid screening of lidocaine associated with cocaine need to be done. The urine test concomitant with cocaine detection is difficult to construe given the lack of pharmacokinetics information (intranasal bioavailability) and strong inter-individual variability.

Introduction Due to the occurrence of fractures, the development of appropriate care for osteoporosis patients is necessary. Antiresorptive treatments have demonstrated their efficacy by reducing the incidence of fractures. However, this efficacy is greatly hindered by the lack of compliance and only about 50% of osteoporosis patients have been reported to consistently taking their prescribed medications. In the department of rheumatology (CHU Amiens), osteoporosis patients have been proposed to participate to a study comparing the efficacy of an interview with a pharmacist with no intervention, at the time of the initiation of an antiosteoporotic treatment, in term of adherence to treatment, i.e. both compliance and persistence.",

Trials on geriatric patients should be promoted, and should take into account the specific limiting factors: possible cognitive impairment, co morbidities and life expectancy.

Introduction Chemotherapy doses are most commonly calculated using body surface area (BSA). This approach does not take into account either the tallest and fattest population. Hence, patients with the same BSA will receive the same dose, regardless body parameters and obesity. Therefore, as this method may cause toxicity, many oncologists tend to empirically reduce the dose for these patients, ''capping'' it at a BSA of 2 m 2 .

However, there is a lack of coherence in the prescriptions for this population. Indeed, as BMI is not evaluated, obese population is not differentiated from healthy or overweight group. BMI is calculated Introduction Since July 2009, therapeutic patient education (TPE) has been written down in the French law [1] . In particular, it is mentioned that TPE forms a part of health care process and that health care professionals must receive TPE training. Moreover, the 38th article specifies the pharmacists' role formalizing their implication: ''pharmacist can take part in patient education''. Therefore, in the Faculty of Pharmacy of Paris Descartes, it has been decided to gradually incorporate TPE training in pharmacy studies. For the moment this training is only proposed to students in 3rd year who have chosen community pharmacy course of study. The goal of this presentation is to share our experience about such training. Materials & Methods This ten hours TPE introduction training was conducted by pharmacists graduated and experienced in TPE. The aims of this class were to define TPE and to introduce the students to TPE practice. This non compulsory training had been fractionated in 4 sessions. We used active pedagogy methods although the training set in a lecture hall. Each session included different sequences alternating brief summarizations and pedagogical workshops. To make the workshops possible, we shared out the students into 4 groups. Every session was conducted by 5 moderators: one in each group and a supervising one. Results At the beginning of the first session, students were asked their expectations relating the training. Many of them expected that the class would provide them a TPE definition (12/48) and give them keys to practice TPE in a community pharmacy (10/48). During the last session students were asked to assess the training in aid of a questionnaire using the ''target technique''. Most students found the training promoted participants' involvement (46/57). Many of them pretended the training met their needs (38/57) and met its objectives (35/57). On the other hand, only several of them found the training suitable for their future job of pharmacist (25/57). Discussion & Conclusion In a first time, students had been puzzled by the class. Finally it appears that they really appreciated the sessions and the use of active pedagogy methods. This kind of training makes the students actors of their own learning process and provides good results in terms of acquisition. Moreover, all methods we employed can be reused to practice TPE so that students can appropriate them. Concerning next year training, we will have to readjust the training in order to redefine the pharmacists' role in a health care process including TPE. Nevertheless, these results are promising. This training will be continued in 4th, 5th and 6th years totalling 40 h as requested by the law. In a second time, this programme will progressively be extended to hospital pharmacy curriculum.

Introduction In neurological rehabilitation, educational therapeutic programs are often focused on medical and paramedical care, without considering specifically the pharmacological treatment (PT). The profile of patients (cardiovascular risk factors, long-term and complexity of medications, cognitive or memory problems) motivated the implementation of a pilot study concerning PT.

The pharmacy counseling was proposed to patient after medical consultation. 2 Questionnaires were used: one evaluating the level of knowledge (15 items) and the other the adherence (10 items). Information and practice advices on PT were also given by pharmacist. The conclusion of counseling was discussed with patient and physician, and then recorded in the patient medical file. Results 31 patients (18 men and 13 women) were interviewed by pharmacist. The average age was 57 years (?/-15 years). 21 patients were accompanied by a family member. The mean duration of the interview was 30 min. Level of knowledge: 71% of patients/family member explain clearly the medications indication, 92% the surveillance to be realized when one is necessary. Only 50% know the difference between their chronic and crisis treatment. 91% know the risk of double dose, when they have forgotten the previous one. Adherence: 65% describe exactly the name and the dosage schedule of medications taken the day before. 46% use a pill box and 40% don't manage themselves their treatment. 39% mention adverse effects that may affect their adherence. Discussion & Conclusion These primary results show a relatively good PT level of knowledge. They are probably biased for PT adherence evaluation due to the lack of adapted tools used during interview. Nevertheless, the time of the intervention seems to be appropriate: it takes place after discharge, when the patient is confronted with the ''real life''. The study underlines the importance of family (for 60% of patients) in the management of medications. The impact of this pharmaceutical intervention on patient behavior is not yet evaluated; however patient's satisfaction score is good. This first approach is relevant because it permits to better understand patient's representations of their illness and long term PT. The next step will be to implement this approach in a multidisciplinary educational program focused on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease for post-stroke patients. Keywords adherence, neurological rehabilitation medicine, pharmacy counseling Improving drug adaptation to kidney: example of a hospital and community pharmacist network Introduction The prevalence of renal insufficiency has been reported to be up to 25% in our hospital; about 3% to 15% of drugs need to be adapted to Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).

This foresees improved Introduction The cardiovascular and metabolic pharmaceutical team of the Hospital of Toulouse has integrated the anticoagulant clinic, a structure dedicated to educating patients on vitamin K antagonist treatment (VKA) during days of therapeutic education (TED). After finding that the TED's workshop had been unsuccessful for a few patients, the team has decided to renew its educational teaching tools. The first objective has been to define patients' expectations regarding their medication. Following this inventory, the team chose to create a new educational tool to promote self-medication.",

            "text": "Materials & Methods Upstream of this project, we conducted a telephone survey of a sample of patients participating in TED (25%). This helped prove that 97% of them want to have pharmaceutical advises and that 51% specifically on the over the counter (OTC) drugs. We decided to use the list of OTC drugs published by AFSSAPS (French Agency for Sanitary Safety of Health Products). We first reviewed literature for drug-drug interactions between oral anticoagulants and the 274 specialties of this list. The information gathered was then used to provide authorization or to forbid each of the 74 DCI. We then developed a simple visual message to sort interactions. We used the principle of traffic lights: green when administration is allowed, orange when allowed under certain conditions (INR control, medical assistance required), and red when banned. We then developed an educational workshop. The exercise begins with a simulation of a mild disease chosen in the AFFSAPS's list. The educator asks patients to list all self medication drugs that they usually take. Then they rank these drugs according to the rule of traffic lights. He helps patients find a solution by giving them hints using his expertise, interpersonal skills, assessing the patients' knowledge. To supervise self-medication at home patients should be given responsibilities while avoiding excessive autonomy. Therefore we decided to give patients the complete list of interactions. The support we chose is an educational booklet containing the principle of traffic lights. Results After six months of bibliography and conceptualization, a workshop test will take place in July. This test will be conducted by the EVACET structure (Evaluation and accompaniment of TE). It will make a first assessment of the implementation of new teaching tools. The workshop ''Self-medication under AVK'' will begin in September 2010 led by a pharmacist. The booklet will be given to each patient participating to the workshop (150/ year). Discussion & Conclusion One challenge will be periodically updating data. In addition, it is necessary to verify regularly that this workshop answers patients' needs, and moreover to ensure that the patient empowerment is well controlled. This will involve regular reevaluation of the educational effectiveness of the workshop and assessment of patient knowledge.

A training program has been applied to the health-care professionals in order to learn communication and teaching skills, but also to contribute to redefine health care professionals' roles and improve their patient relationship and psychosocial abilities. The therapeutic education program includes an individual assessment of patient's educational needs followed by 7 h of educational group sessions on one day with a common lunch. At the end of the day, patients have to evaluate the therapeutic education program on this organization, the interest of sessions, quality of speakers, and their global satisfaction and suggestions. Results The pharmacist is charged to conduct an educational group session about treatments. It relies on giving explanations on usual and crisis treatments, adverse effects, terms of use, etc and helping patients to acquire self-care and coping skills by a new guidance approach with cards games, puzzles, and clinical cases. 6 months after to have begun, 15 patients have been included in the program. Results of the patient questionnaire indicate they acquired the basic knowledge at the end of the session, with 77% of correct answers. Furthermore, the patients' satisfaction rate toward the therapeutic education program is evaluated to 88%. Discussion & Conclusion Therapeutic patient education is a new humanistic medical approach based on the patient's own perception of sickness. It allows them to be active participants in their treatment with the aim of improving their quality of life and therapeutic compliance, as well as reducing potential complications. Thus, participation of a pharmacist is justified by the need for patients to acquire abilities in managing themselves the treatment and to choose their own strategies for pain reduction, which bring them the maximum benefit.

Aldeguer 1 and Audrey Deccotignies, Isabelle Ferry, Laurence Dumas 1 Pharmacy, H\u00f4pital Rene Huguenin, Boulogne-Billancourt, France Introduction Many oral chemotherapy drugs against cancer have been released. Besides advantages, difficulties with adherence, safety, patient teaching and access to oral agents can hinder treatment. In France, since 2005, in order to facilitate access to outpatient treatment, many of these drugs are only dispensed in community pharmacies. After discussion with oncologists in our cancer center, a pharmaceutical consultation has been introduced at the hospital to improve compliance. This meeting is intended for all patients with a first oral chemotherapy hospital prescription, with pharmacy community drug delivery. An unsigned questionnaire survey was conducted for community pharmacists to improve our hospital pharmaceutical role. Materials & Methods During the pharmaceutical meeting, we propose to contact the patient community pharmacist and to fax him the prescription. Information exchange is then performed on the monitoring of the patient. On any given day, a telephone investigation was conducted among community pharmacists by pharmacists of our cancer center. 12 questions were inquired. The aim of this study is evaluation of this measure and the community pharmacist expectations. Results 55 patients who received pharmaceutical hospital meeting during the last six months (11/2009 to 04/2010) were included. Among these patients, 21 did not want their pharmacist to be contacted. 34 community pharmacists were enrolled and 27 agreed to answer. About regular contact with hospital pharmacists, only two pharmacists have already been contacted by a hospital pharmacist for a hospital-city relay. But 93% of them consider that it is necessary to be contacted for support of oral chemotherapy. In terms of practicality, pharmacists are very pleased to receive by fax the prescription in advance (logistics, patient comfort, information about the drug) and find it useful to an hospital contact (93%). According to 81% of community pharmacists, the management of patient care is facilitated by the hospital pharmaceutical meeting. A second meeting should be provided (according to the patient profile) and could be conducted in the community pharmacy during the second cure. Our community colleagues are well interested in oncology drug data for themselves (87%) and for patients (67%). They are also interested in formation sessions between pharmacists.",

Furthermore, a questionnaire on the pharmaceutical intervention was completed by the patients and/or the family. Results Among 101 patients, we note 12 deaths, 53 excluded patients (MMSE too low, refusal, lack of caregiver) and 36 educated (patients and/or family). The average age is 86 years [73-100] with a majority of women (sex-ratio 1.5). At the first session, 58% of the participants were unaware of drug names, nor their indication. The last session showed a 20% improvement on the knowledge and the use of treatments. An active participation of the patients was underlined. Also, we observe 61% of autonomy in the manipulation of the dosage forms (patches, pens, sprays). 85% of the patients and the families were satisfied with the progress and the knowledge acquired during these workshops. At the discharge of hospitalization, a clear and detailed treatment plan offering to the patient an individualized document has been given to all patients, whether returning home or going in an establishment for dependent elderly. Discussion & Conclusion To improve patient adherence to his treatment, it is essential that he really understands his disease and the interest of his treatment. He has to become an actor in everyday life. The involvement of the pharmacist, in the hospital centers ETP, remains poorly described in the literature.

The FPI used in December and January was the one by the SFPC. However, some points are not adapted to the organization of our pharmacy which is why we worked out and evaluated a new PIF from February to April. So, we quantified the number of interventions and the pertinence of the PIF of the SFPC versus the new FPI Results The medium number of prescription validated monthly is 4,041 (1,347 by chemist/intern). The pharmaceutical activity monthly amounts 429948 points (143316 point by chemist/intern). These results do not include the activity of on-call duty. The number of PI realized is 272.

Results A program was developed in 9 months by a group of 4 leading pharmacists (2 in France, 2 in Quebec) . A six-day-long internship was offered in May 2010 at CHU Sainte-Justine, Montr\u00e9al QC, a 500-bed mother-child institution. Seven clinical pharmacists offering full-time pharmaceutical care in specialized patient care wards were paired with French pharmacists on 1:1 ratio. Each intraining pharmacist was exposed to the daily routine and pharmacy clinical activities including an active participation in the writing care plans. In-training pharmacists had the opportunity to observe, to question and to understand how the pharmaceutical care practice model is applied in a real environment. Survey results indicated a high level of satisfaction post internship. The detailed program and the pre/post survey results will be presented. Post-internship followup were identified for further online meetings and potential collaboration (SFPC pediatric group) between all participants. Introduction The role of pharmacy technicians has undergone substantial change over the years with increased use of electronics prescriptions, practice innovation and new technologies. Their responsibilities are expanding based on their qualifications, experience and training. In France, pharmacy technicians attend a specific training to work in various activities in a hospital. Clinical pharmacy is commonly activity to develop and promote the rational and appropriate use of drugs. Pharmacy technicians and pharmacists in collaboration can perform in clinical pharmacy and pharmaceutical analysis. So, we developed a specific form, with different essential points to validate a prescription, to facilitate the first analysis by pharmacy technicians. The aim of this study was to test the process enabling pharmacy technicians to identify drug-related problems (DRPs) and interventions. Materials & Methods A pharmacist, a resident pharmacist and 3 pharmacy technicians analysed 10 prescriptions. One pharmacy technician received a specific training to become a hospital pharmacy technician; another one did not receive specific training but used the form and the last one was free of training and form. They had access to all databases. Results Pharmacist and resident identified 19 interventions associated with DRPs. Pharmacy technician who used the form identified 17 interventions and other pharmacy technicians 15 interventions. The agreement concerned 15 of interventions by resident, 8 of interventions by training pharmacy technician, 7 of interventions by other pharmacy technicians. The most commonly identified DRPs were drug interaction (between 42% by pharmacist and 70% by pharmacy technician free of training and form). The most commonly identified interventions were optimization of administration (between 42% by pharmacist and 53% by pharmacy technician free of training and form). The average analysis time was different between users: 18 \u00b1 6 min for pharmacy technician without the form, 10 \u00b1 4 min for resident and other pharmacy technicians, and 10 \u00b1 3 min a prescription for pharmacist. Discussion & Conclusion These results showed that pharmacy technician can participate to clinical pharmacy.",

These drugs cause severe haematological toxicity in up to 10% of treated patients. Conversely around one over ten patients is resistant to thiopurines. Pharmacological activity of thiopurines is related to the production, by a multistep enzymatic pathway, of cytotoxic active metabolites, the thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). Besides that, a detoxifying enzyme, the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes the biotransformation of 6-MP into 6-methylmercaptopurine, of which ribonucleotide derivates (6-MMPR) take also part in the thiopurine efficacy. TPMT activity variations, originated by a known genetic polymorphism, modulate 6-TGN concentrations. To date, approximately 90% of the non wild TPMT alleles in the Caucasian population are represented by 3 mutant alleles, leading to TPMT deficiency. Patients, with a TPMT deficiency, are at high risk to develop haematological adverse events. Thereby, pharmacogenetics is useful to identity these patients and to prevent severe toxicities. At the opposite, a high TPMT activity may predict a resistance to thiopurine therapy. We report two cases (one haematological toxicity and one resistance), illustrating the use of pharmacogenetic testing of TPMT Int J Clin Pharm (2011) 33:285-467 317 in order to optimize thiopurine therapy in an ALL patient and in an IBD patient.",

It is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral therapy agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced or na\u00efve adult patients with viral resistance. Very few data are available on the pharmacokinetics of this drug. We determined plasma and intracellular concentrations of raltegravir in antiretroviral therapy na\u00efve or multi-drug resistant HIV patients. Materials & Methods A total of 13 HIV infected patients (9 men and 4 women, mean age, 49 years) were included in an observational cohort study. All patients receiving raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) in association with other antiretrovirals. Intracellular and plasma concentrations were measured 3h post-dose (C max ) and 12 h post-dose (C min ) using a validated high performance liquid chromatography assay coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Intracellular concentrations were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Quantitative variables were expressed as medians and inter-quartile ranges [Q1;Q3]. Correlation between intracellular and plasma raltegravir concentrations was evaluated with the non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficient. Inter-patient coefficient of variation (CV %) was determined for plasma and PBMCs using the formula [standard deviation/mean of concentrations 9100]. 49;60] in PBMC, respectively. The median intracellular concentration/plasma concentration ratio was approximately 17%. Correlation was observed between intracellular and plasma concentrations (r = 0.66, P \\ 0.05) suggesting that intracellular concentrations could be predicted by plasma concentrations. High inter-patient variability of intracellular and plasma raltegravir concentrations were noted (inter-patient CV% was [40% for both matrices). Discussion & Conclusion Variability in concentrations that we observed probably reflected variabilities in expression of cellular mechanisms (drug efflux, binding) and metabolizing enzymes. The correlation between intracellular and plasma concentrations allows to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring using plasma concentrations. Finally, this pharmacokinetic study will be applied to further pharmacodynamic investigation which would assess the influence of drug concentration on the kinetics of binding of HIV-1 integrase. Introduction High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is used for treatment of some cancers (non Hodgkin's lymphoma, children's acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma). This therapy can induce a severe nephrotoxicity. Precautionary measures are associated with HDMTX: alkalinization, hydration, preventive treatment of toxicity by leucovorin and pharmacokinetic methotrexate follow-up. Despite these measures, in cases of severe acute intoxication, an antidote is available in France with nominative Autorization for Temporary Use (ATU): carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2), a bacterial enzyme that cleaves methotrexate into non-cytotoxic metabolite 4*deoxy-4amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA).CPDG2 is a very expensive drug (\u20ac 7.000 per vial 1000 IU) used at a dose of 50 UI / kg in one intravenously infusion. CPDG2 administration must be done in maximum 96 h after the date of administration of high-dose methotrexate.",

Introduction T cell non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL T) are a rare and heterogeneous group of malignancies characterized by poor prognosis. Treatment management is very difficult because of subtype's heterogeneity. Currently, no reference practice guidelines exist for treatment of newly diagnosed or relapsed NHL T. Bortezomib, used in treatment of multiple myeloma, has shown promising anticancer activity against several subtypes of NHL T in preclinical studies and some case reports. Based on these data, haematologists of our hospital prescribed bortezomib in this pathology. The aim of this study is two-fold: first to evaluate bortezomib efficacy in this off-label use indication and second to follow up bortezomib prescriptions in NHL T patients after presentation of this efficacy study of bortezomib to our clinicians. Materials & Methods A retrospective study from January 2007 to June 2008 was realized in Pharmacy and Haematology departments to evaluate bortezomib efficacy in NHL T patients.

The results of this study were presented in Clinical Hematology department and since, no bortezomib prescriptions were observed. Discussion & Conclusion Patients achieved CR and PR when bortezomib was prescribed at first or second-line chemotherapy. But all of them relapsed very quickly. Beyond third-line therapy, the results didn't show benefit when bortezomib was combined to NHL T current regimens. These results made our clinicians more sensitive to bortezomib prescriptions in NHL T and since this period, no bortezomib prescription in this pathology was observed. This study allowed an optimization of bortezomib prescriptions in haematology department by close collaboration between pharmacists and clinicians. Currently, bortezomib in combination with new therapies as everolimus or vorinostat in NHL T is evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials and our clinicians expect that results from these studies will be promising.

This AIMD has recently received its CE-mark (European Certification) for the treatment of liver tumours. The microspheres have a dual action: they embolise the blood vessels that irrigate the tumour and emit a beta-ray that allows the destruction of the cells and tissues over a few millimetres. This device's preparation consists in adsorbing extemporaneously the Yttrium-90 to the microspheres whilst respecting the sterility and radioprotection rules. This preparation must be realised in the controlled atmosphere zone of the radiopharmacy. The level of activity of the dose is then checked, and then placed in a three-way syringe. After having purged the embolisation system, the whole device is then placed in a 1 cm wide Plexiglass \u00d2 protection.

Results All four interviewees were strongly positive to the pharmacist follow-up. Their positive attitude was mainly based on: that knowledge of their drugs and disease had been increased, drug related problems had been identified and solved (e.g. wrong dose, side effects, interactions), a ''second opinion'' on their drug regime had been achieved, time with the pharmacist was appreciated (in contrast to short time at the GP), they felt safe and they had the opportunity to meet the pharmacist face-to-face in contrast to phone contact. The interviewees emphasized that the procedure should absolutely be part of the normal follow-up procedure from the hospital, pharmacists and physicians should work more closely together and pharmacists should be more visible in the pharmacy.

This synthesis permits us to place rituximab as a third line treatment for neuropathy associated to MGUS and as a second line treatment for neuropathy associated to lymphopathy. Moreover, it gives to clinicians arguments to justify the use of rituximab.

The lack of long term efficacy evaluation of AD drugs and the lack of data to argue for or against prolonged therapy could be considered as part of an explanation for this situation. Furthermore, these medications are involved into a social lobbying from part of the caregivers and families that makes difficult the decision of stopping or continuing treatment (1) . Even if these drugs are generally well tolerated, it seems important to remind that they can expose to adverse effects like pharmacological antagonism with atropinics, elevated risk of cardiac adverse effect and elevated risk of seizure. Further studies evaluating cost-benefit and appreciating long-term effects are required, especially for biotherapy, to develop a revision of current guidelines. Introduction Prescriptions of antiplatelet (AP) drugs are essential in ischemic stroke care. This pharmacologic class is mainly representing by 2 drugs: aspirin and clopidogrel. No recommandation exists to help medical staff to choose between both of them. This choice becomes even more difficult when ischemic stroke happens whereas patients are already treated by an AP drug. No guideline exists about the concern whether it is better to change AP or not. The aim of our study is to describe which AP treatment strategy is applied to patients suffering from ischemic stroke and already treated by this pharmacologic class.",

Partial response to IRI after several lines of treatment in 12,5% of patients is a quite good result for this poor prognosis cancer. IRI compared to topotecan presents advantages for patient quality of life. It was well tolerated in comparison with topotecan that has an important hematological toxicity in late lines and may be too aggressive in these relapsed patients after several lines of treatment. FOLFIRI therapy is realized in a day-care unit at day1 in contrast to topotecan that requires either a hospitalization or 5 consecutives days of day care. Combination between IRI and 5-FU is not mentioned in the referential. 5FU has an acceptable toxicity in relapse aOC in contrast to docetaxel or doxorubicin that are mentioned in the referential as unacceptable situation in combination with IRI for aOC. Although IRI in combination with 5-FU in aOC is off-referential use, our study showed acceptable results in tolerance and efficacy of IRI in treatment for relapse aOC. However, the follow up of further prescriptions of IRI in aOC must be continued in collaboration with our oncologists. Introduction In order to promote rational pharmacotherapy, it is important to develop, implement, and evaluate hospital drug formularies (HDFs). A report from Denmark recommended standardizing activities of the Drug and Therapeutics committees (DTCs) among the 5 regions of Denmark, but little is known about, how their activities are today. The aim of the study was to describe the organization of the DTCs, how the HDFs were developed and implemented, and to what extent policies that support the use of HDFs existed. Materials & Methods A survey was designed with inspiration from guidelines and surveys of DTCs. The survey included twenty closed and open-ended questions.

If the scar formation, leading to its repair, is not successful, an epithelization network may persist by collapsing several organs together creating adhesions. They may deeply impact morbidity: intestinal obstructions, secondary infertilities in women, chronic pelvic pain. The only remedy to adhesions is the removal in situ. Preventing adhesions creation is therefore decisive. Many clinical trials have been testing different pharmacological treatments (Fibrinolytics, Corticosteroids, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) in order to reduce post-surgical adhesions. But they didn't lead to significant results. Few Medical Devices (MD) have been developed to prevent contact between organs and the peritonea, so as to limit the formation of adhesions. The aim of our study is to evaluate and to compare different Antiadhesion Medical Devices (AMD) after the commercialization of new antiadhesion agents.",

Although there are no international guidelines to manage drug incompatibilities, different decision-support tools such as handbooks, cross-tables and databases are available. In a previous study, two decision-support tools have been pre-selected by pharmacists as fitting nurses' needs on the wards 1 . The objective of this study was to have these both tools evaluated by nurses to determine which would be the most suitable for their daily practice. Tools were assessed by 48 nurses in 5 units (PICU, adult and geriatric intensive care, surgery, onco-hematology) using a standardized form 1 . The scientific accuracy of the tools was evaluated by determining the compatibility of five drugs pairs (rate of correct answers according to the Trissel's Handbook on Injectable Drugs, chi-square test). Their ergonomics, design, reliability and applicability were estimated using visual analogue scales (VAS 0-10; 0 = null, 10 = excellent). Results are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR) for 25% and 75% (Wilcoxon rank sum test).

After preparing 140-170 syringes of 1 mL in each production campaign, the unit-doses are packaged in a black packaging unit, and frozen for maximum 3 months. After defreezing, cefuroxime has to be injected into the 6 h. Thus, a specific packaging label was studied in order to note the defreezing day and hour, and the deadline for use. Furthermore, a syringe label indicates name and dosage, expiry date, dose to inject, and legal endorsements such as cefuroxime registration on poisonous substances list. We are using a globalized dispensing system to provide the unit-doses to the operating room after a pharmaceutical analysis of computerized prescriptions. Finally, we defined a middle-cost for the single dose, charged to ophthalmic operating room at each dispensing, considering operating time, raw material, the cost of workforce, etc. Results 5 months after implementation, we have prepared 305 unitdoses for 280 patients, representing 100% of patients operated for cataract without cefuroxime administration restrictions.

The efficacy may be in part from bactericidal action, in addition to its less understood antiinflammatory action 14. In this prospective examination of postoperative painafter open hemorrhoidectomy, patients receiving metronidazole 10 percent topical ointment reported less pain at 6 and 12 h post surgery, which may be attributed to theanti-inflammatory properties of metronidazole. Also, patients experienced less pain during days 1 to 14 after surgery, which may be because of metronidazole's antibacterial properties. Compared with the placebo group, lower narcotic and oral analgesic consumption in the metronidazole group confirms the improved pain management following an open hemorrhoidectomy. Pressure to the surgery site may be a major factor for pain on defecation. In the present study, metronidazole, 10 percent topical ointment was efficacious in reducing pain on defecation at 48 h after surgery. These findings suggest that inflammation may be interfering with defecation in the primary days post surgery. In our study, more women were recruited than men (76.5 percent). The reason for this recruitment bias is uncertain. In both groups, a large number of patients lived in cities (68.08 percent). The cause of this finding may be related to treatment expense, availability of physician, and cultural differences. Overall, these results suggest that addition of topical metronidazole, 10 percent to conventional pain medications may be efficacious to reduce pain in patients after a hemorrhoidectomy.",

Most nurses reported satisfaction with computerized prescribing probably due to more complete and legible prescriptions. These results are comparable with published data. Computerized prescribing system well accepted by physician and nurses, however, the implementation is not straight forward and is a constant ''work in progress'' Introduction Nearly 500 cases of patient harm from anticoagulants have been described in the UK recently. Out of 120 deaths reported, 77% were related to warfarin. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) issued a patient safety alert in 2007, to minimise the risks associated with anticoagulants, to which all Trusts needed to demonstrate compliance. Poor documentation, unsafe arrangements at discharge, poor communication between patients and clinicians, were identified as a possible sources of errors in the last NPSA document. By auditing one aspect of warfarin management, documentation on admission and discharge, from University College Hospital (UCH) in June 2009, an insight into the quality of documentation has been presented for this high risk area.",

Mottier 4,* Introduction Impact measurement in clinical pharmacy mostly uses indirect indicators (e.g. acceptance rate of pharmacist opinion) because of the difficulty to retrieve direct criteria (e.g. lengthening in hospitalization duration). We conducted a pilot study to assess the quality of prescriptions in our hospital. This project included the development of a new method for the identification of SPADE: situations with a potential adverse drug event (ADE). The objective of this work was to present our results on this specific issue. Materials & Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in a French general hospital. Adult inpatients were included on June 2009 in medical, surgical and obstetrical wards. Data were collected from all available medical charts and reviewed using the SPADE method which consists in the systematic research for specific events known to be hardly associated with ADEs: 1) sentinel events (SE, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, 2005); 2) signs and symptoms suggesting an adverse drug event (SSSADE, Laroche et al, Br J Clin Pharmacol 2006) . A SPADE is defined by the occurrence of 1 SE and/or 1 SSSADE or more. Results Among the 115 included patients (mean age: 68.4 years; mean number of prescribed medications: 7.4), 92 (80.0%) experienced a SPADE: 86 patients (74.8%) experienced at least 1 SE and 92 (80.0%) at least 1 SSSADE. 130 (58.3%) of the 223 detected SE were biological abnormalities. 195 SSSADE were identified: main events were hematologic disorders (32.8%) and renal or water-electrolyte imbalance disorders (20.6%).",

These findings were expected when considering age and polymedication in our study population. SPADE method has some limitations: SE deal with iatrogenic events in a large sense and not only with ADEs; SSSADE specifically focus on ADEs but with too much sensibility, which decreases its interest for daily analysis; neither of the two takes into account drud-drug interactions. Nevertheless, SPADE method is a first step towards a formal identification of ADEs. This work should be continued by the adaptation and the matching of SE and SSSADE in a single fitted tool. Introduction Safety of paediatric pharmacotherapy is of major concern. Although advances have been made, systematic observations of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are essential to further improve the safety of medicines used in children. Objective: To investigate the incidence and characteristics of adverse drug reactions in hospitalised children in different European and non-European countries. Materials & Methods A prospective multicentre cohort study (ADVISE) was conducted in paediatric hospitals in Germany, UK and Australia to investigate the occurrence of ADR in hospitalized children. Data were collected over a three month period using a webbased data entry tool. ADRs were identified by intensive chart review and evaluated by a team of experts using standardised algorithms. Results A total of 835 patients relating to 877 admissions were included [Australia n = 146 (149), Germany n = 376 (407), UK n = 313 (321)]. The mean age was 4.9 years (SD \u00b1 5.1, range 0-18 years) and 55.7% of the children were male. Patients received a total of 4101 drugs (mean 4.8\u00b1 4.7, p \\ 0.01) and stayed in hospital on average 5.8 days (SD \u00b1 8.0, p = 0.16). The main classes of prescriptions in all three countries were antibacterials for systemic use (21.3%), analgesics (16.9%) and drugs for obstructive airway diseases (6.8%). A total of 297 ADRs were identified in 144 patients. Using WHO ADR classification, gastrointestinal-system disorders (35.5%) were most common, followed by metabolic and nutritional disorders (11.1%) and heart rate and rhythm disorders (9.8%). The overall ADR incidence was 17.2%, 95% CI 14.6-19.8, varying significantly between the three countries (p\\0.01).",

Ducastelle-Lepretre 2 , C. Pivot 1 , M. Michallet 2 Introduction The use of alum, potassium aluminium sulphate dodecahydrate, to control severe urinary haemorrhage was reported in the last two decades. Although, the efficacy and safety of intravesical instillation of 1% alum solution were reported in cases of hematuria of vesical origin, several studies detailed alum toxicity, encephalopathy and death following intravesical alum irrigation in patient with renal impairment. In the present study, aluminium transport was investigated ex vivo through porcine bladder in order to characterize penetration and permeation parameters derived from well-known Fickian diffusion model. Materials & Methods Three samples of porcine bladder provided by slaughterhouse were mounted between both the donor and the receptor compartments of three vertical static diffusion cells. The bladder membrane was hydrated for 12 h by filling distilled water in the receptor compartment. Therefore, the internal face of the bladder membrane was exposed to 1% alum sterile solution prepared by the hospital pharmacy. An aliquot of receptor fluid was withdrawn from the receptor compartments at regular intervals of time for 3 h, and replaced by fresh distilled water. Assays of aluminium and potassium contents were achieved by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Sulphate dosage was carried out by turbidimetry. Results Time-course profiles of cumulative aluminium, potassium and sulphate dose absorbed though bladder specimens were fitted to a non-steady-state solution to Fick's second law. Therefore, steadystate permeability coefficient P and steady-state flux of electrolytes through the bladder were calculated from the fitted permeation curve.",

An algorithm for the prediction of aluminium blood concentration as a function of volume and time of alum irrigation and renal status was developed. Predicted and clinical data were successfully correlated. Discussion & Conclusion Predicted and clinical values were found in the range of harmful aluminium blood concentration confirming the relevance of mathematical predicting approach.

However, many adverse effects may limit its administration as an outpatient. The aim of this study was to define the criteria of good tolerance of treatment to better define which patients could safely receive treatment at home. Materials & Methods A retrospective cohort study was carried-out involving all consecutive digital ischemias using Iloprost (January 2005 to January 2008). The administration of Iloprost followed professional recommendations, major and minor adverse effects were consistent with the published reference summaries and product features. Results A total of 30 patients were included, 18 men (60%) and 12 women (40%), median age 49 years ([22-82] ), who received a total of 48 treatments. Etiologies of ischemia were: Buerger's disease (40%), systemic scleroderma (27%), severe Raynaud's disease (10%), hypothenar hammer syndrome (10%), cryoglobulinema (10%), and Werner's syndrome (3%). Among the 48 Iloprost courses studied, 30 were first courses (62.5%). The average duration of treatment was 13.6 days for Buerger's disease, 4.6 days for Raynaud's disease, and 7.3 days for scleroderma. A prior hemodilution was performed for 28 courses. Forty courses (83.3%) were concerned by the appearance of one or more adverse events. Headache (54.2%), flushing (31.3%), and nausea (29.2%) were the most frequent minor adverse effects. The major side effect most frequent was tachycardia (62%), defined by a heart rate greater than 100/min, followed by hypotension (20%), chest pain (18%) and vomiting (15%). Major adverse effects occurred more frequently in women (62.5% versus 20.6%; p \\ 0.008), in Raynaud's disease (1.2 versus 1.6; p = 0.04), and in patients treated with a calcium channel blocker (0.71 versus 0.21; p = 0.042). In contrast, during the dose-finding period, all patients who went beyond the dose limit (i.e. 3 mL/h) had less major adverse effects (14% versus 54%; p = 0.004). Prior hemodilution did not reduce the number of major or minor adverse effects (0.61 versus 0.50; p = 0.54). Similarly, the existence of a cure in the three months preceding the new treatment did not alter the frequency of occurrence of major adverse effects (55.6% versus 33.3%; p = 0.14). Discussion & Conclusion Three criteria of good tolerance of treatments (male, no treatment by calcium antagonists, high doses the dose-finding) and one of lower tolerance (Raynaud's disease) were identified. The identification of these criteria is important because it defines a group of patients eligible for safe home infusions. Keywords Digital ischemia, Iloprost, Safety home treatment, Tolerance",

Main outcome measures The usage of ASM in justified and nonjustified indications upon and during admission, at discharge and at the next follow up visit. Results A total of 414 patients were admitted during the study period and 208 patients (50%) were receiving ASM compared to 53% in 2007 (206 patients out of 389). Seventy four patients (36%) were using ASM upon admission compared to 48 patients (23%) in the 2007 clinical audit. Inappropriate ASM use decreased with 55% during admission (66% to 30%, p \\0.0001), 65% at discharge (34% to 12%, p \\ 0.0001) and 67% at the next follow up visit (15% to 5%, p = 0.0008).",

The campaign was inspired by the American ''100,000 Lives Campaign'' and the concept was to apply the newest evidence based knowledge into everyday procedures. The goal was to prevent deaths through the implementation of six interventions, each of which describes the best practice in six selected clinical areas. One of the campaigns six interventions was medication reconciliation. Medication reconciliation is an important mean to prevent many of the most common medication errors.

Olesen Introduction In September 2008 the Orthopedic Department of Horsens and Braedstrup Hospital, Denmark inquired the possibility of pharmacist prescription of patients' usual medicine when these patients are hospitalized for planned surgery. The department's goal was to release doctor resources and improve medication safety. The latter regarding the fact that the medicine often not was prescribed by the physician on time. A pilot project conducted by the hospital pharmacy concluded that a pharmacist was able to prescribe the medicine correctly in the electronic patient record but not always on time. Furthermore it was assessed that the task was suitable as daily work for pharmaconomists from the hospital pharmacy. The pharmacist's experience from the pilot project enabled a detailed contract to be drawn up with the department. The contract included a precise task description as well as the description of the physicians 0 overall responsibility for the prescriptions. Before engaging in the task the pharmaconomists were trained in the electronic patient record system and in October 2009 the pharmaconomists began the task. This study was conducted in order to control prescription correctness after the task has been implemented as daily work for pharmaconomists Materials & Methods For two weeks in June 2010 all prescriptions made by the pharmaconomists were controlled by a pharmacist for prescription correctness. Prescription correctness included prescribing the medicine correctly in the electronic patient record (correct drug, correct dosage and correct administration time) and prescribing the medicine on time (before anesthesia). Furthermore following was registrated: number of patients, number of drugs prescribed and number of contacts to patients/caregivers Results 19 of 27 medication lists were prescribed on time. The 6 lists not prescribed on time were due to the phamaconomists not beginning the task on time. 93 of the 94 individual drugs prescriptions were prescribed correctly in the electronic patient record. The one drug not prescribed correctly was characterized as a minor fault as it concerned administration time and not incorrect drug or incorrect dosage.",

Materials & Methods From 02/01/2010 to 02/06/2010, all prescriptions of drugs in the geriatric unit (14 beds) have been validated by a pharmacist. Pharmaceutical interventions were carried out either through the prescription software (McKesson Pharma) displaying a comment for the prescriber, or directly at the weekly medical staff where a pharmacist is invited. The collection of interventions was implemented on the model sheets of the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Pharmacie Clinique''.

Before ordering from the local wholesaler, all non-formulary drug requests are analyzed by a pharmacist in order to determine if the request is justified. According to each situation, the pharmacist can order the drug, offer an alternative drug, or refuse to deliver the drug if he considers that the prescription is not justified or if the status of the drug doesn't allow him to order it. For all requests, the decision is notified on the prescription sheet to inform the physician and the nurse of the situation. In order to help the pharmacist evaluate the prescription, a guideline summarising frequent non-formulary drug requests and associate decisions was elaborated. This particular process for non-formulary drugs is time-consuming, both for healthcare professionals and pharmacy practitioners. So it is necessary to ensure that all requests are justified.

We have investigated the risk of medication errors on admission to discharge treatment in a teaching hospital. The aim of the study is to compare the patient medication before, during hospital stay and at discharge in a French internal medicine ward. Materials & Methods All French speaking patients hospitalized in the 31 beds ward with home medications orders are included during the study period (February to March 2010). Medication history is obtained through interview and home medications orders by clinical pharmacist and compared to admissions orders and to discharge prescriptions. We have observed all changes in drugs therapy and classified them in two groups: appropriate (intentional change related to the disease) or not appropriate (medication history error, therapeutic or generic substitution without reintroducing initial ambulatory treatment at discharge, and omission at discharge). Results Of the 40 patients included, 39 (98%) had at least one appropriate modification and 31 (78%) at least one inappropriate modification medication. Of 39 appropriate modifications, 35 concerned a new treatment, 19 discontinuation drugs, and 17 substitutions for pharmacologic reasons.

Based on population studies, this adverse effect was more common in children (44% between the ages of 3 and 15 years; median age: 6 years). It was also more frequently reported with the use of oral suspensions (87%) or other formulations such as dispersible tablets which remain longer in the mouth. These findings led to an analysis of the excipients used in the formulation of oral suspensions. The low concentration and the presence of the excipients in other formulations raised doubt as to their involvement. Another hypothesis was then put forward, suggesting that the active substances might be responsible for an imbalance in oral flora if they remain longer in the mouth. According to the activity spectra of these two related molecules, most commensal bacteria in the oral cavity are destroyed. Only Actinomyces are likely to grow in the presence of these antibiotics. Actinomyces, which are sometimes resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, are involved in the formation of dental plaque. This may explain the occurrence of dental discoloration in children using this antibiotic. A modification to the oral pH, caused by changes to the commensal population in the oral cavity, may also be a factor that influences the development of stains induced by decalcification.",

Keywords Introduction Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) is a priority process of the new French accreditation procedure. Organizing and securing the medication process (prescribing, dispensing and administration) is a major public health issue in the prevention of medication error. Elderly patients are the population most concerned. Because of the rapid development of CPOE and because of the iatrogenic risk, we need to be more efficient in PI. The aim of this study is to optimise PI in geriatric care unit. Materials & Methods Geriatric care unit of 54 beds (Short-Stay) use the CPOE system IMAGE PHARMA \u00d3 . PI were recorded in a national database (SFPC (French Society of Clinical Pharmacy): patient characteristics, medication, intervention type, type of problems and PI's issue.). The SFPC guidelines were used to classify PI (Noncompliance with medical guidelines and contraindication, overdoses, inappropriate administrations, monitoring follow up, etc.). The ''before -after'' study was carried out during 16 weeks with 6 weeks for each data collection period. After the ''before period'', the PI analysis led to five improvement actions (education, software settings, clinical information, shift Intravenous/Oral and organisation of a weekly meeting with the medical team). Chi square test was used for statistical analysis. Results The Intervention rate was reduced from 2.9% to 1.6% (p \\ 10 -3 ). 63 and 46 PI were identified respectively in the ''before'' and ''after'' periods over 5.000 orders analysed. The interventions of noncompliance decreased during the period defined as the ''after period'' (1.3% vs. 0.4%; p \\ 10 -3 ), while overdoses increased (0.3% vs. 0.5%; p \\ 0.5). Interventions defined as ''inappropriate administrations'' go from 0.8% to 0.6% (p \\ 0.3). Finally, interventions defined as ''monitoring follow up'' were not identified in the ''after period'' (0.2% in first period; p \\ 0.025).

Materials & Methods Based on the list of inappropriate medications in the elderly proposed by Laroche et al in 2008 (adapted to French practice), consumption data of these drugs were retrieved(excluding those non available in the hospital) over a four-year period. A categorization by ATC class was applied. A linear regression over time of the consumption of these drugs was done, then a statistical analysis of observed variations was performed by comparing the slopes of the trend lines, through a Chi2 test.

Potential drug interactions were identified and scored by potential severity to 5 grades (1-mild to 5-most severe). Mann-Whitney, Shapiro-Wilk and Spearman tests were used for statistical analyses performed by SPSS software. Results Age of patients of the cohort ranged from 65 to 100 years, with the average of 81.76 years; 77% were females and 23% males. The mean number of drugs used in one patient was 8.82 (range 4 to 18). The number of used drugs was not significantly dependent on the age or gender of the users. The most common indication groups were anticoagulants (11.3%), antihypertensives (10.3%), vasodilators (8.4%), diuretics (7.8%), analgesics (6.9%) and antacids (6.2%). In 64 (64.0%) patients no potential drug interaction was found. Only one potential drug interaction was detected in 20 (20.0%) hospitalized patients; 2 simultaneously occurring interactions were identified in 4 (4.0%) patients, 3 in 6 of the patients (6.0%). In 3 (3.0%) patients four drug interactions were recorded, and 6 potential drug interactions were found in 2 (2.0%) patients. Seven co-occurring potential drug interactions were found in 1 patient (1.0%). The majority of interactions was classified by grade 2 or 3 (42 and 35%), no interaction of grade 5 (most severe) was found. The number of drug interactions in individuals was significantly dependent on the number of used drugs (Shapiro-Wilk, p\\0.001), as well as their severity (Spearman, p\\0.001). The most common potential drug interaction in the cohort was caused by the combination of furosemide and digoxin (incidence 12.9%). Warfarin was found to be a drug with the highest interaction potential: it produced nine types (9.2%) of revealed potential drug interactions. Discussion & Conclusion Drug interactions are important causes of serious adverse drug reactions in the elderly. Although the risk of interaction does not mean an occurrence of adverse reaction, there is a strong need of screening risks in medication records. Our results show the high incidence of potential risk in hospitalized older patients, with both the frequency and potential severity significantly dependent on the number of administered drugs.",

Using these two tools, the MARS as a shorter screening tool would not have identified low RAT scorers reliably. Introduction In July 2009, the opening of the new centralized chemotherapy unit of the hospital was accompanied by an approach of securing the cytotoxic drugs circuit. Our objectives were to reduce exposure to cytotoxic for the staff handling antineoplastic drugs, to ease and reduce time of purge for the pharmacy technicians, to enable the patient to receive the entire cytotoxic dose by removing the dead volume of the infusion set. New SMD, specifically designed to allow the oncology security, are available on the market. The objective was to evaluate and compare two systems of protective SMD and to measure the economic impact.",

A questionnaire assessing the labelling, ergonomic and ease of use of different SMD was developed. A cost study was conducted to measure the economic impact of the deployment of the new SMD. Results 55 opinions requiring pharmacist's expertise after physician's questions were issued. For the most part, they concerned advice about side effects and drug use recommendations or special data, not mentioned in monographies. We recorded 38 interventions due to prescribing errors, including: modifying the dose: 9, discontinuing drug: 7, adding a new drug to patient therapy: 7, appropriate monitoring: 3, changing treatment: 9, other: 3. 82% of interventions were accepted by physicians. Only 32% of interventions were related to analysis of prescription alone (i.e wrong dosage or drug-drug interaction). 68% of interventions were then due to the presence of the pharmacists in the department. 52% of the pharmacists interventions were considered significant (i.e significant improvement of therapeutical care or avoidance of a significant medication error) Discussion & Conclusion ''Standard'' analysis of prescriptions, even on a computerized physician order entry, is not sufficient to detect medication errors and risks of adverse drug events. In this unit, implementation of clinical pharmacy made it possible to enhance the role of the pharmacy resident, as shown by the substantial acceptance of interventions by physicians.",

In our regional hospital, with a multidisciplinary staff we developed local consensus for every kind of surgery according to the guidelines published by the French society of anesthesia (SFAR). Since 2006, for every surgery, we designed a specific form which includes the order, the reminding of antibiotic regimen for each situation, patient informations and an area for administration record. Medicines (vials or tablets) are set in a small box, each box containing only the amount of antibiotics required for a single prophylaxis. The pharmacy department prepares as many kits as a number of antibiotics regimens listed in the 16 orders forms. Thanks to an audit we try to assess the adherence to local guidelines and to evaluate practice of surgical prophylaxis and this specific organization. Materials & Methods Audit has been performed, according to the French National Authority for Health (HAS in French) method, in 4 times (October 2006 , September 2007 , October 2008 , March 2010 by reviewing retrospectively medical and anesthetic records of specific kind of surgery. The prescription of antibiotics was compared with the local hospital guidelines on the HAS criteria. All data were analyzed by using the software SPHYNX \u00d2 . Results 9 kind of interventions has been specifically chosen in 5 types of surgery. During the 4 times, 922 records has been evaluated (30 records studied per kind of surgery). Prophylaxis has been prescribed on specific document in 82%. Duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was longer than recommended in 20 cases (2.2%). 72% of patients received an appropriate dose. Essential criteria is the administration of prophylaxis in the hour before incision. In 83% of cases this timing is applied. Overall adherence to all aspects of the guidelines was 53.7% (n = 337) at the first audit time and 71.8% (n = 145) at the 4 th time. At the 4 th time, a new problem appeared; 11.3% of the administrations were not recorded on the specific document. Materials & Methods Study setting: The study was conducted on adult medical wards at Charing Cross hospital (CXH). Study design: A retrospective approach was chosen to evaluate patients' medical notes (MNs), drug charts (DCs), and electronic To Take Away (eTTAs) prescriptions. All eTTAs from study wards were identified during the study periods. Results A total of 89 patients' medical records were reviewed, of which 70 patients had 407 changes in their medical records. Patients' mean age (SD) is 68.14 (\u00b119.65) years (range 16-97 years). The mean (SD) number of medications per patient in TTAs is 6.71 (\u00b14.54). Actual changes 93.9% were communicated in MRs and 76.4% were communicated in eTTAs. The mean number (SD) of changes per patient was 4.8 (\u00b13.8), range . Moreover, reasons for changes found to be communicated in MRs for 55.5% cases and for 28.5% cases in eTTAs. Introduction Oral chemotherapy represents an increasing proportion of cancer therapies. However, they are causing many side-effects not properly identified and managed by patients and/or local health professionals (general practitioners (GPs), community pharmacists, community nurses). Regional information on the proper use of these therapies, their iatrogenic effects, and their adverse events' prevention has started in September 2009 to improve patient adherence to treatment and experience at home. Materials & Methods Supported by the Regional Health Observatory and the Regional Oncologists Group network, a multidisciplinary committee has been established, comprised of hospital pharmacists, oncologists, the Regional Health Agency. This working group also includes community pharmacists, GPs and community nurses, all members of the Order of different Regional Councils.Documents were written in order to improve the information given to patients. Results Two types of drug leaflets (i.e. for professionals and patients) were created for each oral chemotherapy and are available at a free access website. This contains standard posology as well as advice on the occurrence of any side-effects, and basic instructions to patients. The list of various oral treatments for cancer is also available for health professionals. Training on different classes of oral anticancer drugs (pharmacodynamic properties, adverse effects), health professional awareness of non-adherence risks and practical use of drug leaflets was carried out. Therefore, 260 primary care professionals in the geographical region (GPs, community pharmacists and nurses) were able to complete the training. A complementary program of patient education has started, initially with 250 patients. A patient diary for treatment follow-up was developed to record, on a weekly basis, the administration, the adverse effects and the patient's comments, as well as pharmacist, GP and community nurse remarks. The diary is presented by the patient to the oncologist at each consultation. This should permit adherence evaluation of treatment (i.e. date of delivery recorded by the pharmacist). The community nurse is responsible for the patient education at home and receives a symbolic annual compensation for their patient follow-up.",

The reassessment of the treatment after 48-72 h was observed in oncology and haematology units respectively in 73% and 71% of prescriptions. In the ICU, the threat in these immunodepressed patients prompted prescribers to perform this reassessment several times a day but this revaluation was not constantly recorded in patients' medical files. Estimated duration of antibiotherapy was only specified for half of haematology unit's patients and for no patients in the other units. In the Haematology Unit and ICU, accumulation of risk factors requires the introduction of a broad spectrum antibiotherapy. Therefore, the duration of this treatment is difficult to predict, particularly when confronting neutropenic fever where the duration depends on the end of aplasia.",

Introduction Renal function assessment is mandatory for cancer patients treated by anticancer drugs. Carboplatin is an alkylating agent that is indicated in several cancer localisations. There is a close relation between its renal clearance and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Best estimate of GFR is provided by direct methods ( 51 Cr-EDTA or inulin measurement) which are difficult to manage in daily practice. In this context, serum creatinine (SCr)-based formulas are used to estimate GFR when calculating a dosage for carboplatin using the Calvert equation. We wanted to evaluate the impact of three different formulas (Cockcroft and Gault (CG), aMDRD [1] (Modification of Diet Renal Disease) and CKD-EPI [2] (chronical Kidney Disease-Epidemiology)) on carboplatin dosage and the influence of patients' age, sex and body mass index (BMI), knowing that CG is used in our center.",

We gathered the age, the height and the weight. Carboplatin dosage was calculated using Calvert equation. We performed variance equality tests, variance analysis and means comparison on our population at a risk of 5%. We established two line models for two dose ratios (carboplatin dose calculated with aMDRD/dose based on CG and CKD-EPI/CG) depending on patients'age. Results Depending on the formula, carboplatin doses are statistically different for patients older than 65 years (p = 0,004) and patients with BMI \\ 18,5 (p = 0,035). The comparison of the matched means for these two population subtypes shows that carboplatin doses calculated with CG were inferior to those calculated with aMDRD (respectively p = 0,002 and p = 0,020) or CKD-EPI (respectively p = 0,008 and p = 0,033). However, no statistical difference was found between aMDRD and CKD-EPI (p = 0,547 et p = 0,548). Our line models confirm that among our population CG seems to underestimate carboplatin dose beginning from 50 years with aMDRD and 52 years with CKD-EPI. Discussion & Conclusion Regarding patients older than 65 years, the difference noticed confirms the relevance of the aMDRD and CKD-EPI which use can permit to avoid a dose minimization normally expected. For cachectic patients with BMI \\ 18,5 CG should be used in order to reduce carboplatin toxicities. No statistical difference between the three formulas has been found for obese patients probably because of a too small number of patients among our population. According to our result, CG seems to be a convenient formula to estimate carboplatin dose with Calvert equation in our daily practice, for patients under 65 years. For none cachectic patients older than 65 years, aMDRD or CKD-EPI formulas should be preferred.

All received steroids as pre-treatment and 4 also received other treatments such as rituximab, azathioprine, cyclosporine, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, genoxal, vincristine, without success. Only two patients were splenectomisedbefore starting treatment with romiplostim. The initial dose was 1 mcg/kg once weekly in all patients. Dose adjustments were realized in all the patients less in 2. In three patients, 6 who required dose adjustments, only had to be increased to 2 mcg / kg and reaching optimum levels of platelets. Other two patients received doses of 3 mcg / kg and a patient is titrated up to 5 mcg / kg to over 50 000 platelets/L. The median dose was 37.5 romiplostim . The median platelet count before starting treatment was 20500 (7000-37000) platelets/L.

Administrated by i.v. route, it binds to these receptors and allows neuroendocrine tumour's (NET) imaging and diagnosis. However, SSR scans require beforehand a Strict Low esidues diet (SLR). If this diet is not respected, SSR scans often show abnormal radioactivity distribution, especially in bone marrow.

Agesranged from 15-42 years, with 13 being over 35.There were pregnant with several associated conditions: 25 with 2 diseases, 3 with 3 and 2 with 4.CNS diseases occurred more frequently: depression (21/70), anxiety (9/70) and epilepsy (4/ 70) .Women with CNS disease were exposed to 33 CNS drugs, with higher exposure to diazepam (8), paroxetine (7), alprazolam (7), valproic acid (4) and trazodone (4) , and to 22 other drug groups to treat associated diseases. Fifteen women were exposed to 1 drug and 24 to 5 or more, with a maximum of 19. Depression and anxiety was treated with monotherapy or with 2, 3, 4 or 6 CNS drugs combinations. To treat associated diseases 1 or 2 more drugs were added. There is the possibility of establishing a causal relationship in 5 cases where babies had abstinence syndrome and floppy child syndrome.

The most frequent brands of intravenous medications used in the intensive care unit of gerontology and metabolism department in a university hospital were identified. Based on the data, SOP were made and the training of physicians was initiated. Results From 14074 drug pairs potentially given to the patients on ICU through one intravenous line, 2,62% of drug pairs were incompatible. Into the most frequent incompatible drugs pertain ciprofloxacin, midazolam, amino-acid infusion, insulin and furosemide. The newly developed SOP class these and other incompatible drugs with the group of drugs that should be separated from all other administered drugs. The use of an idle intravenous line was recommended for this group. Discussion & Conclusion This project was intended to identify the most frequent drug incompatibilities and to develop the new SOP. In comparison to other studies made in this field, a lesser number of potential incompatibilities were observed in this study. The next prospective studies will be necessary to determine the real number of incompatibilities and the improvement after the developing new SOP Some criteria were added in relation to the contribution of pharmaceutical act.",

This practice should be validated and cannot be recommended at this time. On the other hand, boric acid for external use is essential as a treatment for skin injuries caused by P. aeruginosa in order to limit the use of antibiotics (externally colimycin as well as intravenously) considering the risk of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, the use of boric acid must be controlled because of its severe toxicity in case of systemic penetration: vomiting, neurological disorders (delirium, myoclonic epilepsy, sleepiness), acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis were reported. The toxicity increases when chronic application on deep injuries and in elderly people lasts a long time on a large skin area: the risk is also higher and must be underlined. As a result, we decided to keep on manufacturing this hospital compounding with a new label including special cautions. According to the dermatologists, this drug should be reserved for P. aeruginosa contaminated wounds. Our better knowledge of this antiseptic solution leads us to warn hospital pharmacists about the toxicity of this widely used external drug. Some recommendations about its use have been diffused in order to promote a safety prescription. Introduction Vascular complications commonly develop in patients with diabetes mellitus. Foot problems can become serious because of impairment of the immune and vascular systems. Wound and ulcer treatment are usually difficult to treat and include debridement of the wound and special dressing. Moreover, this kind of wound can be so painful that topical antalgic treatment such as 5% lidoca\u00efne appears inefficient. Thus, the need for a powerful local antalgic is relevant. The aim of this work was to evaluate a 25% lidoca\u00efne ointment for diabetic foot pain relieve. Chemical, stability and systemic absorption of lidoca\u00efne were evaluated. Materials & Methods Starch glycerite was used to prepare the 25% lidoca\u00efne chlorhydrate ointment. Stability studies were realized by an HPLC-UV method on a RP C8 column (Mobile phase was composed of potassium dihydrogenophosphate buffer and acetonitrile (75/25 v/v) and detection was performed at 205nm). For stability studies, three batches were prepared and samples were assayed each day between D0 and D14. The safety of treatment was assessed on 7 patients one hour after ointment application: blood samples were collected and analysed using an HPLC method with a liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Blood concentrations were compared to that described in literature. Results The analytical method was validated according to ICH validation of analytical procedures. CV intraday and interday were less than 10%. In the ointment, lidoca\u00efne concentrations remained stable over 14 days at room temperature when stored in tubes. Lidoca\u00efne plasma concentrations in patients were low or undetectable when compared to plasma concentrations reported in literature (1) .",

The complete medication orders become available to the pharmacist who carries out a centralized pharmaco-therapeutic analysis. The aim of this study is to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively our pharmaco-therapeutic analysis activity. Materials & Methods Pharmaceutical prescriptions were analysed by 3 pharmacists every day by looking at biology tests results and clinical data. This study covers four months in early 2010. All clinical pharmacy interventions made in four care units (cardiology, neurology, nephrology and geriatric; totalising 108 beds) are counted, and compared to the total number of medical prescriptions. Drugs and situations most frequently associated with drug-related problems are identified. Clinical pharmacy interventions are then ranked according to the criteria established by the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy (SFPC): addition, discontinuation, switch, choice of administration route, drug monitoring, optimization of administration modality, and dose adjustments [1] . Acceptance rate is evaluated based on changes in prescriptions following the interventions. Results The proportion of prescriptions analyzed generating a clinical pharmacy intervention is 2,1% (191/ 9180). Of the 191 clinical pharmacy interventions, 26,7% related to antithrombotic drugs, 16,7% related to digestive and metabolic drugs, 14,1% related to antibiotics, and 12,6% related to cardiovascular drugs. The most commonly identified drug-related problems were supratherapeutic dose (27,7%), followed by nonconformity to guidelines or contraindication (21,5%) and infratherapeutic dose (15,2%). Clinical pharmacy interventions concerned primarily dose adjustments (38,2%). Thirty-five interventions (18,3%) were drug switch. Thirty interventions (15,7%) corresponded to proposals for drug discontinuation. Twenty-three interventions (12,0%) suggested the addition of a new drug, nineteen (9,9%) improved drug monitoring, and eleven (5,8%) an optimization of the administration modality. Acceptance rate is 85,3%.",

This analysis of prescriptions relies on knowledge of the prescribility habits and of the individual exercise of the pharmaceutical profession. The chi 2 test (calculated chi 2 \\ theoritical chi 2 ) lets us forebode that the division of PI is independent of pharmacist. P1 and P2 are not different in their pharmaceutical analysis despite the ambiguity of the final pharmaceutical judgement. This conflict in analysis of prescriptions having not been significant statistically, it seems necessary to measure its clinical impact on the service provided to the patients. Then, we will compare this data to hospitals activity similar in order to share the experience and to find a common methodological tool for the analysis of prescriptions.

Introduction Intravenous infusion takes an important place in the current therapy in hospitals and pharmaceutical firms keep improving their infusion medical devices. B.Braun Medical has recently developed an iv administration set with an automatic infusion stop. It avoids nurses regularly check the end of the infusion and changing the medical device at each new drug infusion. But it's important to study the stability of the infused drugs, which stay in stasis for several hours in the dropper chamber and in the tube. We focus our study on two frequently used drugs in hospital pratices: paracetamol and ketoprofen Materials & Methods Paracetamol 10 mg/mL (Perfalgan) and ketoprofen 1 mg/mL (Profenid) are infused prepared and perfused individually and successively with the iv administration set Intrafix Safeset under ambient light and temperature. During individual infusions, samples were collected at the beginning of the infusion, at the end and after 24 h stasis of the drug in the medical device. During successive infusions, samples of the second infused solution were collected at the beginning of the infusion, every 5 min during the infusion and after 24 h of stasis. Controls solutions of each drugs were prepared. Each sample was monitored by a visual inspection, pH and osmolality assessment and chromatographic analysis of each drug with a validated stability-indicating method.",

No variation of pH and osmolality was reported throughout the study for each drug. Variations of paracetamol concentrations remained under a 10% threshold when infused individually or after ketoprofen. Ketoprofen concentrations remained stable during the time of each infusion but not after 24 h of stasis in the iv administration set. At 24 h we showed a loss of 11.5% of ketoprofen without apparition of degradation products. However, there was no variation of ketoprofen concentration in control solutions and the pH, osmolality and visual inspection were stable. So we assume that there is an interaction between ketoprofen and the PVC of the infusion tube. But in this case, this interaction has no consequence in clinical practice: the patients received the total prescribed dose and there is no apparition of degradation products so no toxic risk for patients during the stasis of the drug in the infusion tube Discussion & Conclusion Repeated individual perfusions of paracetamol (Perfalgan) 10 mg/mL or ketoprofen (Profenid) 1 mg/mL are possible with the iv administration set Intrafix Safeset, leaving them in position until 24 h, because of the stability of these drugs. There is also no problem to infuse successively paracetamol and ketoprofen through this medical device: no drug instability or incompatibility appears during the 24 h of stasis and patients can be safely cared",

Introduction Postoperative nutritional support can be provided by parenteral nutrition (PN). The main consideration is not to overfeed the patient (1,2) as hyperalimentation is known to increase energy expenditure, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production; to induce fatty liver disease and can lead to hypertriglyceridaemia (1, 3) . In severe malnourished patients, refeeding syndrome can occur (3).",

Results During 56 days, 38 (9.43%) out of 403 admitted patients were solely fed with TPN, accounting for a total of 352 TPN days. Patient demographics will be presented on the poster. Results are expressed as absolute number of TPN administered. The energy supply, according to the first formula (30 kcal/kg/d), the HB equation and the IJ equation, was only concordant in 15.91% (56/ 352), 9.38% and 0.30% respectively, too low in 7.95% (28/352), 6.25% (22/352) and 6.36% (21/352) respectively and too high in 76.14% (268/352), 84.38% (297/352) and 93.75% (330/352) respectively. Discussion & Conclusion Compared to the commonly used formulas, most patients receiving PN are overfed. Since overfeeding can be related to complications, defining the amount of PN must happen on a more case-by-case basis. To guide the prescriber, we are working on a device in the electronic prescribing system which calculates the total energy requirement and proposes a PN plan.

Therefore, it has been recommended that each woman capable of becoming pregnant should use folic acid supplements at a daily dose of 400 ug starting one month before conception and continuing until the end of the first trimester. The aims of the study were to investigate the possible differences in folic acid use among a multi-ethnic population of pregnant women, and to identify the determinants of antenatal folic acid use in this population. Introduction Administration of parenteral drugs to inpatient represents an important side of pharmacotherapy. Clinical pharmacists are frequently faced with compatibility problems related to the administration of concomitant drugs via Y-site. Some data regarding this topic have been published in the literature. However, when data published are poor or missing, it might be useful to be able to conduct tests in your hospital to assess visual compatibility of different parenteral drugs administered via Y-site. The aim of this study is to present a simple method developed by our group for assessing visual compatibility of a target drug administered via a Y-site and present a clinical example by using naloxone.",

Moreover, the conditions in which this study was conducted (ex. non-diluted drugs) should be taken into account if its results were to be used for the administration of drugs to an actual patient. The method that was developed allows us to perform the assessment of visual compatibility only whereas supplemental chemical compatibility tests would be optimal.

Introduction After abdominal surgery, a patients' oral nutritional intake may be postponed for several days. Sometimes, nutritional support is provided by parenteral nutrition (PN). However, this expensive and hazardous (1) way of feeding may not always be justified. Literature states that PN is indicated in patients whose nutritional status is at risk, in whom enteral feeding is contra-indicated and who cannot meet their caloric requirements by mouth or via nasogastric tube within 7 days (1, 2) .

For each patient were analyzed several biochemical parameters for nutritional assessment recommended by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN). Nitrogen balance was calculated after three days of the onset of parenteral nutrition (PN), using the values of urea in urine (g/L), 24-hour diuresis and grams of nitrogen supplied with parenteral nutrition. Results During the study period there were 24 patients with renal protection parenteral nutrition. At the beginning of the PN, patients had the following blood-values average of creatinine, urea and total protein: 3.18 mg/dL, 160 mg/dL and 5.2 g/dL (respectively). In relation to the nutritional assessment of these patients, only in 46% of them albumin data were requested. However, in all of them data of total cholesterol and lymphocytes were measured. Analyzing and comparing the values with the standards published by the Spanish Society for Hospitalary Pharmacy, it was found that 75% of patients had moderate malnutrition at the time of prescription of PN. With regard to nitrogen balance, 37% of patients needed more nitrogen input to meet their daily needs as the balance took values less than -2 g/day. From the Pharmacy Service these results were notified, but only one patient received additional enteral nutrition. Discussion & Conclusion Nutritional support of patients with renal disease was not consistent with the recommendations, malnutrition and inadequate inputs. More communication between the Pharmacy Service and the medical team would improve the nutritional assessment of these patients. Introduction The sterile preparation unit of the Hospital Pellegrin produces in an automated way 8000 total parenteral nutrition a year for 1 pediatric intensive care unit and 2 services of neonatology. These preparations are ternary mixtures with electrolytes. To optimize the parenteral contributions, the medical and pharmaceutical multidisciplinary team chose to replace the lipid emulsion of these mixtures by a new generation emulsion. This emulsion contains triglycerides medium chains, triglycerides long chains and its content in omega 3 is favorable to the production of eicosapenta\u00e9noique acid and docosahexa\u00e9noique acid in whose synaptic and retinal development role is demonstrated.Because of the instability known for lipid emulsions in mixtures and considering the potential toxicity to the administration of too voluminous lipid globules, the sterile preparation unit wished to study the stability of ternary mixtures with electrolytes containing this new emulsion.",

For other services, the parenteral nutrition will be assured by an ready to use shape, Pediaven \u00d2 . Pediaven is an industrial parenteral nutrition perfusion. The aim of the study was to assess whether the prescriptions of Pediaven \u00d2 were in accordance with the recommendations of the suppliers and to estimate the cost of this treatment. Materials & Methods Design: Retrospective Study. All children who received Pediaven \u00d2 from August 2009 till April 2010 were included. Setting: Departement of Paediatric in Reims University Hospital Main Outcome Measures: An standardized data collection form was elaborated. Data collected were pathology at the origin of the PN, posology, age and weight of the children, nature of addition in PN, duration of the treatment, type of nutrition (exclusive or additional) Results 20 patients (13 male, 7 female) were included. The average age of the patients is 7, years. 4 groups of diseases were observed: oncology (n = 10; Average of age: m = 9,4 years [1,9-19]) , digestive diseases (n = 6; m = 2,71 years [0.021-11]), infectious diseases (n = 1; m = 16 years) and other (n = 3; m = 8, 3 years [0,83-14] ). 566 units of PEDIAVEN were used during this period.

Introduction Maple Syrup Urinary Disease (MSUD) is an hereditary disease of branched chains amino acids (BAA) metabolism. Its prevalence is 1-5/10000. Leucine accumulation is responsible for mostly neurological symptoms that may lead to death. Acute failures must be treated by eliminating BAA in toxic blood rate and restarting protein anabolism with carbohydrates, lipids and essential amino acids (AA) intakes. Estimated 30 to 50 French patients a year suffer from acute MSUD. On request from a reference center for hereditary metabolic diseases, an AA solution for acute MSUD is available since January 2010. It is the first AA mixture specific to MSUD treatment to be administered through peripheral vein. An observational study was then launched. The primary endpoint is to identify acute MSUD patients characteristics and therapeutic options. Secondary endpoints are to assess the new parenteral AA solution and to show new therapeutics needs. Materials & Methods Study involves all French hospitals that treat MSUD (19 hospitals) and will be run for 2 years. After each order of the new solution, a survey was sent to the hospital physician referent for MSUD. Information about the patient and his disease was requested: gender, age, MSUD diagnostic circumstances and acute failure etiology. Clinical assessment was done on admission (weight, temperature, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory and intestinal symptoms), BAA blood rates and metabolic acidosis were monitored for the entire course of the treatment. The treatment was detailed: dialysis, AA solution infusion (time, path and dose), others intravenous (IV), oral or enteral intakes (carbohydrates, lipids, essential AA), insulin and hydration solution. Data were registered and analyzed by the AGEPS Regulatory Affairs Unit and reviewed by the above reference center. Results In 6 months, 4 hospitals were included and 5 answers have been received. Patients were 8 to 27 years old and are all men. All of them had neonatal MSUD and the failure was due to a non compliance with the diet. Every patient received the new parenteral AA solution, 4 received IV dextrose and lipids and 1 patient was supplemented enterally. Valine and isoleucine were systematically given orally, since those AA are not available IV. The treatment was maintained until BAA blood rate normalized (media 4.2 days).",

Introduction Aluminium is a ubiquitous metal, well known as a contaminant of parenteral nutrition admixtures with a toxic potential. The assessment of aluminium in dialysis solutions is a regulatory requirement because the accumulation of this element may leads to bone disease, and central nervous system toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate aluminium concentration in parenteral nutrition compounds and in parenteral nutrition admixtures, manufactured in our hospital, in order to assess the daily rate of aluminium which each patient received. The specific objectives were (i) to compare aluminium concentration in parenteral compound solutions to the allowed maximal concentration (i.e. 25 lg.L -1 ), (ii) to assess the daily rate received per kilogramme of weight for 15 patients with home parenteral nutrition and (iii) to evaluate the impact of our manufacturing process in aluminium contamination. Materials & Methods Fifty-eight samples from fifteen patients were selected for sampling and aluminium determination. Each patient was in a steady state and received long term parenteral nutrition seven days a week, twenty four hours a day. All the parenteral nutrition admixtures and twenty six parenteral nutrition compound solutions were sampled for aluminium determination. The samples were stored into EDTA Di-potassic BD Vacutainer \u00d2 and aluminium content was assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 2500\u00b0C. Results Twelve parenteral nutrition compound solutions in twenty six (all packaged in glass container) and all the parenteral nutrition admixtures contained more than the Food and Drug Administration recommended concentration (i.e. 25 lg.L -1 ). In addition, the manufacturing process used in this study was responsible for 30 percent at most. Ten patients on fifteen received daily rates of aluminium per kilogramme of weigh significantly upper than the proposed safe maximum rate recommended by the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and American Society of Clinical Nutrition (i.e. 2 lg.kg -1 .day -1 ).",

Analytical separation of the components of the drinking solution was performed via HPLC (column RP-18e, 250x4.6) using a gradient program changing from mobile phase A (NH 4 Ac buffer 20mM, pH 2.70/ methanol 99:1) to mobile phase B (NH 4 Ac buffer 20mM, pH 2.70/ methanol, 70:30) after 3.5 min. Structure elucidation was carried out by LC-MS-MS (TriQuad, positive mode) and 3 H-NMR (600 MHz). Results Through stability studies we clarified that the decomposition product formation depends on the presence of both KG and HMF under equimolar loss. According to results obtained with LC-MS-MS, we hypothesized an ester or an aldol condensation product as the only two possible products. Since esterification does not occur in acidic aqueous solutions, we concluded that the only possible structure should be the result of an aldol condensation between the aldehyde carbon of HMF and the alpha carbon of KG carbonyl group. The mass of the product is 255 m/z (positive mode). 3 H-NMR analysis confirmed this structure. Discussion & Conclusion Patient safety is one of the main goals in drug development process and therefore structure elucidation of possible degradation products in new pharmaceutical formulations is of great importance. The current work presents the clarified structure of the main degradation product occurring in the drinking solution under investigation by this providing the option to block or reduce the formation of it.

Michaud 2 and EA4481 GRIIOT 1 pharmacie clinique, UFR PHARMACIE, 2 gastroenterology, CHRU, LILLE, France Introduction Plasticizers such as di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are added to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to confer flexibility. However, DEHP is associated with reproductive disorders in human population. Due to its non covalent bond to the PVC matrix, this plasticizer tends to leach easily. Infants and children undergoing a cyclic long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) could be particularly at risk of potential toxicity from DEHP due to regular exposure. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of the most commonly used markers of free radical activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate how chronic exposure to phthalate affects the plasmatic rate of MDA.

The same phenomenon observed with the rate of MDA showed that the two events are closely dependent. Therefore, a chronic exposure to DEHP during a cyclic TPN raises the plasmatic MDA level, indicating increased oxidative stress. Discussion & Conclusion MDA is a product of lipid peroxydation considered as a presumptive marker for the development of oxidative stress in tissues and plasma. Chronic exposure to phthalates during TPN increased the potential risk of free radical activity in vivo.

An experimental patient had used oral hypoglycaemic drugs during 2006. Experimental and control patients were matched in terms of age, gender and quarter of index date. A repeated measures analysis calculated the mean number of packages and costs of drugs in experimental patients during the two years prior to diagnosis and the first year following diagnosis and in control patients during three years. Results Our dataset covered 2,697 patients (899 experimental and 1,798 control patients). The mean annual number of packages and costs of drugs increased over time for experimental and control patients (p\\0.001). In patients with a future diagnosis of diabetes, the growth in drug use and costs over time was more pronounced than in control patients (p\\0.001). Higher drug use and costs were mainly observed for cardiovascular drugs, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, and drugs related to gastric acid disorders. Discussion & Conclusion Patients with a future diagnosis of diabetes have higher drug use and costs prior to diagnosis than control patients.

It is important, in particular, to assess intensive treatment so as to confirm this underestimation or rebalance financing for AML patient management. Introduction Prescriptions of SMD (sterile medical device) for inpatients are rare or uncommon. The lack of prescriptions requires other methods to coordinate the healthcare delivery and to insure the quality of care and the correct use of SMD. In absence of explicit legislation hospitals organized themselves under specific constraints which are both local and institutional. In an environment where economical constraints put an increased pressure on resource allocation, our hypothesis is that hospitals organize themselves in order to reduce organization induced costs (transaction costs) and reach economic efficiency in the healthcare delivery. In order to assess hospital organization we analyzed pharmaceutical organization in a representative sample of hospitals. We aimed to identify the specificities of transactions taking place inside hospitals.",

The model is based on only direct medical costs (in Euros) related to net cost (monetary value of the timeinvestment by the pharmacy staff to prevent PME) and net benefit (medical cost, derived from the monetary value of the potential clinical consequence of avoided PME: expensive antineoplastic drugs, hospitalisation). Results are expressed according to the benefit-to-cost ratio (net benefit divided by net cost), and total benefit (net benefit of consequences minus net cost of time-investment). The robustness of the results was assessed through a series of one-way sensitivity analyses. Results Over one year, PME incidence was estimated at 1.5% [1.3-1.7] , i.e. 218 avoided PME.

Introduction Aminoglycoside antibiotics are used to treat serious gram-negative infections. However, their use has been limited by the risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity and their pharmacokinetic variability. Efficacy and toxicity are related to blood concentrations, thus requiring therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

Paubel 1,* 1 Pharmacy, Sainte Anne Hospital, Paris, France Introduction French public hospital use for drug purchases the rules of public contracts. Sainte-Anne hospital has launched a consultation in 2010 for the supply of all medications (697 lots) with a tender procedure (TP) (no negotiation possible) followed by negotiated contracts (NC) after unsuccessful tender (negotiation possible). Some lots of the TP are declared unsuccessful, either because there was no offer, either because the price offered is deemed too expensive. The pharmacist with its drug expertise has a role in the choice of drugs because he is at the crossroads of discussions in medical, technical and economic. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of the hospital pharmacist (HP) in the negotiation of drug prices which is to get an offer where there was none at the TP, or to try to lower drug prices at the NC compared to those proposed in the TP. Materials & Methods An analysis of the economic balance is done on all of the consultations. The number and the total amount of unsuccessful lots are determined. The evolution between 2009 and 2010 of the turnover is evaluated. The number of lots for which the negotiation was successful or not is determined. The success criteria for negotiation are: an offer for a drug to which no laboratory had made offers at the TP and a downward price after negotiation by the HP for drugs whose prices offered at the AO is considered too expensive ([5% / 2009). Furthermore a prospective survey of the working time concerning the HP and the resident has been achieved. Results Following the TP, 503 lots are awarded. 9 lots are declared without continuation (that no longer needed). 185 lots (no offer for 64 lots and 121 lots with a cost deemed too high) are declared unsuccessful and treated in the NC. Following NC, 23 lots are declared without continuation, there is no offer for 37 lots which will be supplied from the wholesaler, and 125 lots are awarded. Among the 125 lots, 70 lots prices have not advanced. The negotiation was successful for 51 lots (27 lots with an offer in NC, so there were none in TD, 24 lots with an evolution of lower prices compared to the TD). 4 lots can not be analyzed. The consultation represents an amount of approximately \u20ac 2 million per year. Compared to 2009, the projected savings are estimated at \u20ac 33,123. The lower prices obtained through negotiation represents a saving of \u20ac 15,114. The HP (\u20ac 61.33/h) and the resident (\u20ac17.34/h) worked, respectively 30h and 8h, with an investment of \u20ac 1,980 and a return on investment of 13 134 \u20ac.",

Introduction Implantable drug-delivery systems (IDDSs) to administer morphine intrathecally are innovating in management of no cancerous chronic pain. Few publications evaluate the interest of the IDDSs. The Pharmacy of Sainte-Anne hospital has evaluated the cost and the effectiveness of the morphine pumps (PM) used in the pain unit of the hospital. Materials & Methods This is a retrospective study conducted in patients with chronic low back pain implanted by a PM. The effectiveness of the MP is evaluated by comparing the results obtained before implantation and 3, 6 and 12 months after implantation by two ways: VAS score of 0-10 (assessment of overall pain, sciatica, low back pain) and Oswestry index (assessment of functional disability related to pain). The pump efficiency is assessed by comparing the average number and type of painkillers (strong opioid, weak opiod, nonopioid analgesic according to the WHO analgesic ladder, and other drug as antidepressants, anticonvulsants or muscle relaxants) used before and after implantation. The economic analysis of the PM takes into account costs of pharmaceuticals (drugs ''pain'' and IDDSs) and the number of visits and days of hospitalization of patients in the pain unit are also collected. Results Data are collected in 5 patients implanted in 2006/2007 from their medical records over the period 2002 to February 2010, with a period of 3 years after implantation.",

Competition from Indian generic medicine manufacturers, European variation in generic medicine prices and competition between generic medicine manufacturers by discount suggest that the potential savings to health care payers and patients from generic medicines are not fully realized in Europe. One way of attaining these savings may be to move away from competition by discount to competition by price. Free-pricing systems may drive medicine prices downwards under specific conditions. In price-regulated systems, regulation may lower prices of originator and generic medicines, but may also remove incentives for additional price reductions beyond those imposed by regulation.

Six monoclonal antibodies were revoked for commercial reasons. The proportion of the hospital drug budget spent on monoclonal antibodies has more than doubled from 8% in 2004 to 17% in 2008. The monoclonal antibody budget was made up of infliximab (41% of budget), trastuzumab (20%), rituximab (10%), cetuximab (9%), ranibizumab (9%) and others (11%) in 2008. Although monoclonal antibodies tend to be used in their registered indications in University Hospitals Leuven, a number of cases of offlabel use were documented. Introduction In the prescribing-dispensing process, community pharmacists are the last point of contact in the healthcare chain and uniquely poised to deliver targeted counselling, to screen for compliance problems and to improve medication compliance. We defined compliance as the extent to which the patient's behaviour matches agreed recommendations from the prescriber [1] , and counselling as an approach that focuses on enhancing individual problem-solving skills for the purpose of improving or maintaining quality of health and quality of life [2] .",

According to the information in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), pregabalin is licensed in adults for the therapeutic treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain and generalised anxiety disorder. The main objectives of this study were to determine the appropriateness of the prescribing of pregabalin as well as its pattern of use. Materials & Methods Design: Descriptive, transversal, and multicenter study. Setting: All-area centres from Costa de Ponent Primary Care, of Catalan Institute of Health (coverage for 1.3 million inhabitants). Subjects: 6,247 patients with medical record and an active pregabalin prescription in March 2010. A simple random sample of 256 individuals was selected (\u00b16% accuracy). Study period: January 2006 to March 2010. Variables: age, sex, pregabalin dose and schedule, diagnosis for which it is prescribed, duration of treatment, concomitant medication and premedication both for the same diagnosis for which pregabalin is prescribed. Results 27% (n = 71) of patients took pregabalin for a therapeutic indication as per the SPC. The diagnoses of all patients taking pregabalin were: bone and joint pain (41%), neuropathic pain (20.3%), herniated disc or disc disease (13.7%), fibromyalgia (9.8%), anxiety (6.6%), epilepsy (0.8%) and 7.8% not stated. The average age of the sample was 60 years (SD = 14.4) and 64% (n = 164) were women. The average daily dose used was 154.7 mg (minimum 25 mg/ day, maximum 600 mg/day). Patients over 65 years took lower daily doses than patients younger than 50 years (p = 0.029) and those between 50 and 65 years (p\\0.003). Of the 256 patients, 48% took pregabalin for less than a year, 27% between one and two years, 19.9% between two and four years and 5.1% for over 4 years. For pain treatment (n = 217), 39.2% took a drug associated with pregabalin, 19.8% two drugs, 11.1% three drugs, 0.9% four drugs and 29% did not take any drug associated with pregabalin. In addition, 14.7% of patients had taken gabapentin or amitriptyline before starting treatment with pregabalin. Discussion & Conclusion Pregabalin is used mostly in unlicensed indications even when the evidence of its efficacy is limited to peripheral neuropathy. Only a quarter of treatments with pregabalin are administered for an adequate indication according to the SPC of the EMA, although the FDA has approved the use of pregabalin in fibromyalgia. Other indications such as a herniated disc or disc disease may also be considered a type of neuropathic pain. The average daily dose did not vary by gender, but decreased with age. Three quarters of patients are taking other drugs for the same health problem, therefore increasing the problem of polypharmacy. It should consider first-line treatments based on current evidence/guidelines and product license restrictions. Introduction Type 2 diabetes is a global epidemic. The development of the disease can be foreseen and prevented for some of the patients at risk. As easily-available health-care providers, community pharmacists can identify people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and counsel/refer them appropriately. International Diabetes Federation recommends the use of brief patient questionnaires to help healthcare professionals to quickly identify people who may be at a higher risk. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of a program testing diabetes risk of the clients, performed at the community pharmacy setting.",

The clients who were seemingly over-weight and older than 45 years of age were invited to the study and the study was carried on those accepting to participate. Results A total of 109 clients participated in the study. Fifty-nine percent of the participants were female and the mean (SEM) age was 54. 3 (1.3) . The mean (SEM) body mass index was 29.3 (0.3) kg/m2. Of the participants, 43% were hypertensive and 16.5% were found to have higher than normal blood glucose levels. Majority (94%) of the participants had abdominal obesity.

Those at the moderate risk group were advised to consider their physical activity and eating habits. Those in the high and very-high risk group were advised to have their blood glucose levels measured to determine if they have diabetes without symptoms. All these three risk groups were referred to a physician for further guidance. Introduction Swallowing difficulties, or dysphagia, can occur in any age group, although it is most common among elderly people. It can affect patients' ability to take solid oral dosage forms, thus compromising medication adherence. Although literature is poor, available data show that prevalence in the general population ranges from 25 to 60%. Prevalence in community pharmacies needs to be explored.",

Since the beginning of the years 2000, the association between risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and AP use was emphasized through clinical studies. However, the results are variable according to the study. As the consequences of VTE are often severe, this has led us to conduct an analysis on the relationship between each type of AP, their dose and pulmonary embolism (PE): one of the major complication of VTE Materials & Methods Our study was a retrospective epidemiological analysis assessing the prevalence of PE in AP users versus non AP users. It was based on the data collected from the year 2006 in Premier database. Patients were over 18 year-old and had at least one prescription of AP. A log regression was performed to analyse the association between PE events and AP use. A dose-effect relationship was assessed according to quantities administered and administration routes. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders: age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity Index, diagnoses of infection-sepsis, inflammatory bowel, psychotic disorders and in or outpatients. Results Among 28,723,771 included patients, 450,951 (1.6%) presented an AP prescription. Haloperidol was the most commonly prescribed drug (157,667 patients or 35.0%) but atypical APs represented more than 78% of the prescriptions.",

We have looked specifically at each type of AP and found differences in terms of PE risk (except for quetiapine and aripiprazole). An innovative relationship between the risk of PE and the AP dose used is described. All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. Further studies are required to confirm the relationship and especially to explain the mechanism but this study suggests an increased risk of PE with AP treatment, changing with the type of AP and dependent on administered dose. Introduction Drug induced adverse effects are frequently encountered in the elderly. In order to improve the quality of prescription in this population various medication assessment tools were developed to evaluate the appropriateness of treatment. The most quoted and used tool is the Beers criteria (last update in 2002). French criteria have been adapted from the Beers Criteria.The purpose of this study is to evaluate, over a 2-month period, the extent of inappropriate drug prescribing for the elderly from hospitalisation to discharge according to the French criteria. There was no significant difference between the number of inappropriate drugs prescribed at the point of admission and the number of inappropriate drugs prescribed at the point of discharge (83 versus 76). The most common drug groups prescribed were psychotropic drugs (83.13%).",

We compared the prevalence of migraine and the exposure to triptans prior to the index date between patients with rosacea and rosacea-free controls. Results A history of migraine was slightly more prevalent in cases with rosacea as compared to rosacea-free patients (odds ratio, OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18-1.29), after adjusting for smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and use of calcium channel blockers. The highest OR associated with migraine was found in women above the age of 50 years (adj. OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.30-1.53). Additional adjusting for use of hormone replacement therapy did not substantially influence the OR (adj. OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25-1.47). The ORs were similar for patients with migraine who used triptans (adj. OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.20-1.41) and for patients not using triptans (adj. OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.27), as compared to patients without migraine. Stratification by the total number of prescriptions, as an indicator for severity of migraine, did not reveal a difference in ORs.",

Introduction Sugammadex is a new agent with a cyclodextrin based chemical structure that is active to only reverse the action of Rocuronium and Vecuronium, two nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). At the time of its admission on our formulary, little was known concerning its positioning in routine practice and its use was expected to increase the costs of reversal. The aim of this study was: to describe the first uses of Sugammadex in our hospital and to evaluate the cost associated and its potential impact on the use of NMBA.",

            "text": "Materials & Methods Because of its substantial cost, the Drug Committee validated consensual guidelines regarding its use in agreement with anesthetists. Two indications were then selected: reversal of deep neuromuscular blockade induced by Rocuronium or Vecuronium at the end of the surgery; reversal of deep neuromuscular blockade induced by Rocuronium in case of impossible intubation. A dotation of the drug was established in four anesthesiology departments in order to follow up patients treated with Sugammadex. An observational prospective study has then started as from November 2009 on patients being treated. A form was validated to collect data regarding patients' characteristics (age, sex, ASA score), or the use of sugammadex and NMBA. Furthermore, an assessment of costs of reversal by Sugammadex was performed. Since rocuronium and vecuromium are not frequently prescribed, we also assessed the impact of the introduction of Sugammedex on the use of NMBA. A basic description analysis was carried out with mean (minimum-maximal data). Results 14 patients were treated with over the period November 2009-June 2010. Mean age was 65 (30-89) and 78% were women. Patients were cared for visceral or gynaecological surgery. The NMBA used in all cases was Rocuronium and its first indication was the crash induction when Succinylcholine was contra indicated. One patient received Sugammadex in the case of an impossible intubation. In the other cases, it was administered to reversal deep neuromuscular blockade at the end of the surgery. The mean dose was 5 mg/kg (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . For 3 patients, dose was different than recommended by health authorities. No side effects related to NMBA or reversal drug have been reported during this study. Average costs of reversal by Sugammadex were estimated at 209\u20ac per patient (74-740). No significant trend towards a change in the use of NMBA has been observed.",

These practices are specific to the Surgery area, which may explain the lack of proportionality in other sectors. This suggests that the norfloxacin DDD increase leads to a lower incidence of BSI-UTI. On the other hand, regression analysis allowed us to see that there was a proportional relationship between the norfloxacin DDD and the number of IUC on the overall level of CHLS but also at the Surgery and Medicine sectors. So it would seem that the increased IUC causes an increased risk of UTI represented here by the increase of norfloxacin DDD.

Goutelle 1 and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Groupement Hospitalier de G\u00e9riatrie, H\u00f4pital Pierre Garraud, Service Pharmaceutique, Lyon, France 1 Pharmacy, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Lyon, France Introduction Various antibiotics may prolong the cardiac QT interval and increase the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), which is a rare but potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia. However, the risk profile of each agent is variable (1) . Previous studies have shown various trends in the use of QT-prolonging antibiotics among European countries (2) . The objective of this work was to assess the evolution of the qualitative and quantitative patients' exposure to antibacterials with QT liability in our clinical setting, over a four-year period. Materials & Methods Fifteen QT-prolonging antibacterial agents available in our institution (Hospices Civils de Lyon, HCL) were studied. Those agents were classified in 4 groups according to their QT-prolonging potential, from B (any evidence of QT prolongation) to E (strongest clinical evidence of long-QT and TdP), using the classification proposed by Raschi et al. (2) . The consumption data from 2006 to 2009 of those 15 antibiotics, used by both oral and parenteral routes, were retrieved using the information system of 3 geriatric hospitals (903 beds) of HCL. This system also provided the number of days of hospitalization over the same period. For each antibiotic, the annual data were expressed as Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), using the method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/). For antibiotics for which no DDD was available, we considered the DDDs to be equal to the recommended daily doses. Finally, data were expressed as DDD per 1000 days of hospitalization, which is a measure of patients' exposure. The uses of the four groups of antibiotics were compared over the four-year period. Results From 2006 to 2009, the total consumption of the 15 agents decreased from 63.41 to 59.56 DDDs per 1000 days of hospitalization (-6%). In 2009, the patients were mainly exposed to group D drugs (70%, n = 6 drugs), followed by group E (18%, n = 6), B (12%, n = 2) and C (n = 1). Over the four-year period, exposure to group E agents (highest QT-prolongation risk) increased from 7.92 to 10.89 (+38%). In this group, consumption of clarithromycin and erythromycin increased twofold, from 0.7 to 1.43 and from 0.87 to 1.70, respectively. By contrast, the use of antibacterials with a lower risk profile decreased from 10.49 to 6.95 (-34%) for group B and from 44.86 to 41.54 (-7%) for group D. Exposure to group C drugs (telithromycin only) was quite stable (0.14 in 2006 and 0.18 in 2009).",

The relationship between potential risk factors and the PME was analysed using the logistic-regression model. Results A total of 14,854 prescriptions were analysed. The PME incidence was estimated at 1.5% [1.3-1.7], with a significant or very significant clinical impact in 62.9% of cases. Potentially deaththreatening events were avoided in 3.7% of cases. Overall, PME incidence related to significant, very significant or vital clinical impact was estimated to be 1.0% [0.8-1.2]. The most common type of error was related to the dose of antineoplastic drug (61.0%): wrong adaptation (43.1%), not taking alarms into account (16.1%), incorrect weight (0.9%), incorrect unit (0.9%). More than 20% of PME are medication errors directly linked to the prescribing medication order (choice of regimen, duplication, forgotten or not validated by physician).

Side-effects were reported from a patient perspective, with a rating scale. Adherence and side-effect questionnaires were mailed to patients. Adherence was also estimated by determination of the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) from dispensation data by community pharmacists over a retrospective 6 month-period. Demographic and clinical data, including haematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses, were obtained from patients' medical files. Results Sixty-eight CML patients under TKI treatment were identified. From those, 64 patients (94%) returned their questionnaires, and were enrolled in the study. Mean patient age was 60 years [range 27-90], with a 0.82 sex ratio. 72%, 20% and 8% of patients were treated by imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib respectively.

Introduction Clinical pharmacy is developing positively in Belgium since few years. At the CHU of Li\u00e8ge, a pilot project of the Federal Public Service for Health began in July 2007 and the department of clinical pharmacy was created in February 2008. Currently, the presence of a clinical pharmacist is provided in various departments (geriatrics, oncology, hematology, intensive care). Echoes of pilot projects showed that besides the common characteristics of some patients (heavy conditions, heavy treatments), the success of a project also depends heavily on the context in which it develops (openness and desire of collaboration of other health professionals). After 2 years of activity, we wanted to compile an inventory on the perceptions, needs and expectations for clinical pharmacy in 2010 in our institution.",

This study was carried out to evaluate the extent and quality of the patients' education about warfarin and its possible impact on the international normalized ratio (INR). Materials & Methods This was a cross-sectional study using a 20-item, self administered questionnaire, offered to patients who were taking warfarin for at least 2 months and attending the medical or cardiology anticoagulation clinics between August and November 2008. Setting: Anticoagulation clinics in Hamad General Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, State of Qatar. Main outcome measures Patients' knowledge score, relation of knowledge about warfarin with their INR values and their reported bleeding or re-clot episodes during warfarin therapy. Results A total of 140 patients completed the questionnaire, 116 patients (83%) reported that they received warfarin education and overall 61 patients (44%) had a controlled INR. Of the 79 patients with a satisfactory knowledge score about warfarin (i.e. overall score of at least 75%), 49 (62%) had a therapeutic INR compared with 12 (20%) having an unsatisfactory knowledge score (p\\0.0001). The number of clinic visits within 2 months was less in the satisfactory knowledge group (SKG) compared with the unsatisfactory knowledge group (UKG) (mean 3.7 vs. 4.7, p = 0.0029). The time spent within a therapeutic INR range in the last 6 clinic visits, was 73% in the SKG and 53% in the UKG. There was no difference between the two groups regarding their bleeding/re-clot episodes. The lowest scores were for participants' knowledge about the interactions between warfarin and other drugs (76% incorrect), followed by the effect of a missing dose and its management (58% incorrect) and which healthcare provider to inform about their warfarin therapy (49% incorrect).",

The opinion of the expert committee was aimed at the value, the form and the interest of the quiz. The analysis of responses and spontaneous suggestions enables to identify the most relevant issues. Many multiprofessional meetings allowed to choose precisely the semantics better suited to avoid confusion and misinterpretation, taking into account socio-cultural representations and beliefs of patients. The quizzes are finally validated by infectious disease specialists and psychologists. Results The four currently proposed quizzes approach the areas of prevention, pathophysiology, daily management of treatment and side effects, while assessing the validity of responses using a degree of certainty. They are accompanied by argued and documented answers to ensure the scientific validity of responses and consistency of care by different caring staff members. Discussion & Conclusion These quizzes will have to evolve according to changing behaviours and medical responses.

The created pharmaceutical tools used, allow to combine essential data for the continuity of the patient treatments. The originality of this work is based on the pharmaceutical monitoring of the patient throughout his hospitalization, in narrow link with the city professionals. The appraisal is very positive and confirms the results of similar experiments described in the literature. Introduction Cidofovir (CDF) is a nucleotide analogue with a wide antiviral spectrum, prescribed in infusions for the treatment of CMV induced retinitis to HIV infected patients, in case of aciclovir (ACV)resistance. According to the literature, CDF has a potent antiviral activity against other DNA viruses. The pharmacy of the Georges Pompidou Hospital compounds topic form containing CDF, prescribed for HIV infected patients with herpes genital warts resisting to the classic treatments 1 . The aim of this work was to study the stability of this preparation to bring a safety of use and to improve compounding quality and care efficiency for these patients.",

Introduction Health care professionals' perception of risk may impact on therapeutic management of women during pregnancy. Since the thalidomide tragedy, the use of drugs during pregnancy generates fear. This concern might affect the estimation of the risk associated with drug intake during pregnancy, leading to premature discontinuation of a required treatment, superfluous anxiety or pointless termination of a desired pregnancy. Although data regarding the security of drugs during pregnancy are still scarce, a few specialized information sources exist providing reliable recommendations for daily practice. This study aimed at characterizing the risk perception associated with drugs during pregnancy in a sample of Swiss health care professionals.",

In Spain, people older than 65 years are responsible for 70% of the pharmaceutical cost, due to their prevalence of chronic diseases. 85% of the chronic patients use a daily average between 4-8 drugs per person. The chronic patients with polypharmacy have high probability of developing negative outcomes associated with drugs which can be identified, be avoided or be solved by pharmacotherapeutical followup. The aim of our work was to investigate the outcomes associated with medication of chronic and polymedicated patients. Also, we measured the change on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) and the evolution of community pharmacy sales to these patients.",

The confidentiality of the interviews required that two pharmacists had to be simultaneously available, one for interviewing the included patient in a private room and one for the routine work. Patient adherence is perceived to be important, but it is not a priority for pharmacists given the amount of routine work that needs to be done.

Introduction Efficacy of orally administered chemotherapy depends on a high level of patient adherence. In this prospective multi-centre observational cohort study, we investigated the effect of an intensified multidisciplinary pharmaceutical care programme on the adherence of cancer patients treated with capecitabine, a prodrug of fluorouracil, available as film tablets and routinely used in the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer patients. Materials & Methods Twenty-four colorectal and twenty-four breast cancer patients participated in this study. Patients of the control group (n = 24) received standard care, patients of the intervention group (n = 24) received intensified pharmaceutical care consisting of written and spoken information. Adherence to capecitabine chemotherapy which is taken twice daily for 14 days with a seven days break between the cycleswas measured using an electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS TM ). Results Patients in the intervention group exhibited an enhanced but not significantly different mean overall adherence compared to the control group (97.9% vs 90.5%, p = 0.069). Mean daily adherence was significantly higher in the intervention group (96.8% vs 87.2%, p = 0.029). Variability of both adherence parameters was considerably reduced when pharmaceutical care was provided. At the end of the observation period of 126 days, the probability of still being treated with capecitabine was found to be 48% in the control group and 83% in the intervention group (p = 0.019, log-rank test). The relative risk for a deviating drug intake interval, i.e. \\10 or [14 instead of 12 h, in the intervention group was found to be 0.51 (95% CI, 0.46-0.56) compared with the control group (p\\0.05, Chi-square test).",

However, not every patient is in need of an adherenceenhancing intervention. Based on these conclusions, we designed a follow-up study which is currently ongoing. After completion of the first cycle of capecitabine chemotherapy (run-in phase) patients are divided into two groups based on measured adherence. Initially nonadherent patients (adherence \\ 90%) receive an intensified adherence enhancement intervention. Initially adherent patients (adherence C 90%) will only be monitored to reveal whether they remain adherent during the entire course of their chemotherapy. Results Validation of ATB prescriptions generated 132 PI for all services among patients of average 73 years old (14-96 years old): 48 women and 84 men. The most frequently involved services were geriatric (30%), internal medicine services (23%) and surgery (11%). PI concerned mainly cephalosporins (33 PI -25%), aminosides (27 PI -20%) and fluoroquinolones (20 PI -15%) antibiotics. The main type of pharmaceutical problem was non-compliance to recommendations, it represented 51% of PI (68/132) and included the mismatch between ATB and sensitivity or long prescription of aminosides. In 35% of cases, proposed PI was a therapeutic substitution; stopping the treatment was recommended in 19% of cases; 15% of PI were for adding a treatment and other interventions were dosage adaptation, choice of way of administration, therapeutic monitoring and optimization of administration. In total, 40% of PI was accepted, 14% not informed (get-out patients) and 46% not accepted. Among ''non accepted'' PI, 11 were motivated by a specialized advice, 9 PI for only aminoside prescriptions were actually associated with another ATB (unspecified on prescription) and 5 patients showed clinical improvement despite the mismatch between ATB and sensitivity. Discussion & Conclusion This experience has allowed us to share our difficulties about routine quotation and to standardize it. A quarterly and annual report will be provided to each pharmacist, and a booklet is being written to guide pharmacists during validation of ATB prescriptions. Finally, analysis of IP can highlight recurrent drug problems in order to propose and implement corrective measures and working base for Committee of Antibiotics within a goal of improving quality of medical care. Introduction Fluoroquinolones (FQ), widely prescribed in hospitals, are affected by the increasing emergence of resistances. The use of FQ in our hospital is greater than the median consumption of comparable institutions. In order to monitor consumption and evaluate good practices, the Committee of Antibiotics (CAI) and the pharmacy established, as part of an evaluation of professional practices, a review of relevant prescriptions of FQ.",

Introduction Outpatient subcutaneous (s.c.) therapies are becoming more and more common in the treatment of different diseases. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are frequently used for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. A literature search failed to find studies on application problems concerning selfinjection of LMWH in a heterogeneous outpatient population under daily life conditions.

Data were collected through structured questionnaire-based telephone interviews both at the beginning and at the end of the LMWH treatment. Drug use problems comprised handling difficulties with the injection-device, discomfort, confidence, degree of effort required to inject and experience of side effects. Compliance was assessed based on patient's self-report. The returned sharps collectors allowed investigation of illegitimate recapping, residual drug volume and use of needle guards. Results Median age of the 213 patients was 54 years (range: 18-88); 50.7% were male and 41.8% had previous outpatient s.c. injection therapies. A total of 15.5% had their injections administered by another person. The rate of self-reported non-compliance was 17.1%. At least one relevant problem with self-injecting was recorded in 85.0% (e.g. lack of knowledge concerning injection site or technique, recapping). At the end of treatment, 38.9% of patients stated the injections required them some effort. The preferred injection site was the thigh with 68.5%. We found no differences between those injecting into the abdomen and those into the thigh. The needle caps of Fragmin \u00d2 were rated as significantly easier to remove than those of Clexane \u00d2 and Fraxiparine \u00d2 . Of patients using Fraxiparine \u00d2 or Fraxiforte \u00d2 , 31.3% did not use the post-use needle guards. A total of 46.1% of patients had no residual drug in any of their syringes. The overall mean residual drug volume was negligible. However, in 59.8% of the cases where some residual drug was present, an average of C10% (median: 6.7%; range: 3.7-79.6%) of the total drug volume had not been injected. Patients injecting into the thigh showed a higher risk of leaving residual medication. Discussion & Conclusion Problems encountered in patients with LMWH applications may affect the injection itself or handling of the injection-deviceand have to be evaluated on an individual basis. From the patient's point of view, injections required some effort. Patient support was appreciated, but there is still a need for improvement. Injection-free solutions for patients on chronic LMWH use would be appreciated.",

Then, we identified the sources of information required to conduct medication reconciliation at admission (patient interview, community pharmacies, medical charts, primary care physicians). Afterwards, we explained our project to the medical staff of the pilot unit. Results We chose to apply medication reconciliation to patients over 65 years old. This process is totally pharmacist-conducted: in the first 48 h after admission, a pharmacy intern collects the list of all medications the patient is taking including name, dosage, frequency and route. The medication history is then compared with the physician's medication orders. All medication variances are brought to the prescriber's attention and are classified as intended or unintended variances. Moreover, we assess the level of compliance of the patients during the interview with a standardized questionnaire and report the results to the physician. The patients' discharge medications are also compared with preadmission and hospitalization medications and all discrepancies are clarified with the prescriber. At discharge, the pharmacy intern provides explanations to the patients concerning medication changes made during the hospitalization. Our project began three weeks ago and currently involves 21 patients. The mean number of unintended variances was 0,6 per patient. 7 patients had one or more unintended variances at admission. 70% of the unintended variances resulted in order changes by the physician. The average duration to conduct medication reconciliation at admission was 45 min. This project was received favourably by the physicians, community pharmacists and patients. Discussion & Conclusion These first results are consistent with previous studies showing that medication errors at transitions in care are frequent and can be prevented by medication reconciliation. The evaluation of patient compliance included in the reconciliation medication process should give us the opportunity to develop a project of therapeutic education. Medication reconciliation improves patient safety but is also a time consuming process. To ensure the sustainability and expansion of this project, new personnel arrangements should be explored, such as pharmacy technicians and nurses partnering with pharmacists to facilitate medication reconciliation.

After obtaining the high risk patients, clinical pharmacists may provide recommendations about life style changes and medications and early refer to physicians for further assessment. Introduction Systemic cancer therapy is complex and associated with a high incidence of treatment-associated risks. Patient education and counseling regarding supportive therapy may help minimize these treatment-associated risks. Projects conducted at the University of Bonn have shown positive effects of patient counseling on outcomes such as quality of life or medication adherence. [1] The aim of the current project is to define the role of physicians, pharmacists and nurses in a multiprofessional tumor therapy management model including shared education and counseling. Materials & Methods Focus group meetings were held to identify different tasks as part of the multiprofessional tumor therapy management model. The modified Delphi technique was used to allocate these tasks to physicians, nurses and pharmacists by local cancer care teams. Additionally the professions' perceptions on benefits and problems of multiprofessional teamwork were explored. Afterwards physicians, nurses and pharmacists have been approached nationwide by the German Cancer Society and the German Society of Oncology Pharmacy via an online-questionnaire to assess the acceptance of the presented multiprofessional tumor therapy management model. Results Two focus group meetings of six clinical pharmacists and one moderator identified 38 multiprofessional tumor therapy management tasks. The Delphi questionnaire was pre-tested by all three professions and found to be feasible. Two Delphi rounds with 12 participants (five nurses, four physicians, three pharmacists working together in three different cancer care teams) allocated these tasks to the different professions: while 27 of the tasks should be shared, 11 should be carried out by one profession alone. The exploration of perceptions showed that from the professions' viewpoint problems of teamwork occur if the professions have e.g. lacking assignment or acceptance of each other's competencies leading to overlapping task completion. On the other hand, it was recognized that a better organisation of teamwork might considerably improve patient education and treatment outcomes. The online survey is currently ongoing.",

Based on our model, more specialized models concerning e. g. medication adherence and supportive therapy strategies such as fatigue and nutrition can be developed and implemented according to the patient's needs. Introduction A significant proportion of patients with prescribed medicines for antihypertensive (AHT) and lipid modifying therapy (LMT) do not reach their biomarker targets as defined by the respective guidelines. Patients not on target are at increased risk of therapy failure. Community pharmacists are in an excellent position to address factors that are associated with a lack of target achievement, such as non compliance, unfavourable lifestyle and nutrition, drug drug interactions, incorrect dosing, and inheritance of drug response. Pharmacological biomarkers could help to identify patients who can profit from pharmaceutical care interventions. Our aim is to describe the prevalence of patients not on target with AHT and LMT.",

This abstract reflects only the authors' views. The European Community is not liable for any use that may be made of the information contained therein. Materials & Methods A structured interview involving 270 patients visiting 1 of 4 Dutch community pharmacies, in the city of Groningen, where two studies using a 2x3 design were conducted. In the first study, the respondents (patients with a driving license visiting a community pharmacy) were exposed to a condition in which the pictogram (DRUID* or homologue French pictogram) and the risk category (category I, II or III) were manipulated. In this study, both pictograms were accompanied by the same side-text. In the second study, the added value of the side-text was examined. Here, the respondents were exposed to a DRUID pictogram with or without side-text and again one of the three risk categories. Results 50.7% of the respondents were male with a mean age of 48.4 years-old and with a high education level (45.6%). After observing either the DRUID and the French pictograms, respondents recognized the risk of driving while taking driving impairing medicines. 78.8% of the respondents stated being likely to change their behaviour in the presence of a medicine with such pictograms. 36.3% of the respondents said they would drive less frequently and 40.7% wouldn't drive anymore. 81.5% of the respondents stated it would be unlikely to change the intake of their medicines. Patients showed preference for the 3 categories presented in the DRUID pictogram and 73.3% of the respondents felt that the side-text of the DRUID pictogram was helpful. Discussion & Conclusion Both the DRUID and the French pictograms appeared to be effective in communicating risk. The majority of the respondents recognized the risk of driving while taking driving impairing medicines and were willing to change their driving behaviour by driving less frequently. The pictogram didn't influence respondents' way of taking their medicines. When comparing the DRUID and the French pictograms, respondents preferred the DRUID one. It was also clear that the side-text in the DRUID pictogram was perceived as added value when compared to the other DRUID pictogram, without any side-text. Introduction The primary objective of the study was to determine the level of support of North Carolina pharmacists for opportunities of providing additional vaccine-related services. Secondary objective was to measure whether there were any differences to obtain information to establish pharmacists' opinions regarding expansion of pharmacist provided immunization services. Materials & Methods Quantitative, prospective study. Data collection tool: electronic questionnaire consisting of 13 questions titled 'The NCAP immunization survey of NC Pharmacists'. Pilot study was conducted among several registered pharmacists within the NCAP immunization taskforce. An electronic link to the on-line study questionnaire was distributed to all active, registered pharmacists on the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy (NCBOP) database on February 16th to be returned by February 27th 2010. No reminders were sent due to time constraints and the legislative timeline. Results 952 questionnaires were completed, a response rate of 10.03%. 496 (52.1%) respondents are currently certified to provide vaccines. 54.5% of respondents' practice sites offer pharmacistprovided immunization services. 802 (89.5%) pharmacists were supportive of an increase in the scope of vaccines. The majority of the respondents chose the category '14 and above' for the age of patients which they would be comfortable immunizing. 661(73.8%) pharmacists were willing to undertake additional training in the area of travel vaccines. 701 (78.2%) pharmacists were supportive of a rule change to allow pharmacists to administer non-vaccine injectables. 599 (67.2%) participants stated they 'had no concerns' with practicing under an open protocol. 523 (58.6%) participants had no real concerns with providing vaccines to patients aged under 18. Discussion & Conclusion Understandably, active immunizers showed greater support for role expansion than non immunizers. Significant concerns and barriers across all groups still remain. These include administrative support, physical space, reimbursement and physician support. Opportunities to provide travel vaccines and nonvaccine injectables were also popular among respondents.",

At discharge, PPI therapy was continued in 34.2% of patients with a de novo PPI prescription. Discussion & Conclusion This study highlights the over-utilization of PPIs in non-ICU patients and the inappropriate continuation of PPI prescriptions at discharge. The PPI dosage prescribed for prophylaxis was probably too high compared with the data of the literature.Treatment recommendations for SUP are needed to restrict PPI use for justified indications. intravenous to oral administration in patients whose gastro-intestinal absorption is intact. A lot of advantages are associated with this switch like a more easy administration, a lower risk of catheter related infections, more comfort for the patient, a shorter length of stay. The impact of an early switch in terms of cost is also important, especially in countries, like Belgium, where drug expenditure in hospitalised patients is financed by a fixed budget.

The poster was communicated via the hospital's intranet and handed over to every hospital ward. During a study period of three weeks, all prescriptions for intravenous levofloxacin, clindamycin and paracetamol were evaluated, using the electronic patient file. The treating physician was contacted by phone, if switch to oral administration was possible. Patient's demographics and treatment information were collected. The study was carried out at a 2000-bed tertiary care hospital, the evaluation of the treatment and the phone calls were performed by a clinical pharmacist. Results In total, physicians were contacted in 378 cases. In 53,17% of cases (201 patients) the route of administration was immediately switched after the call. More in detail, a switch was carried out in 55,96% (183 of 327 patients) for paracetamol, 45,45% (5 of 11 patients) for clindamycin and 32,50% (13 of 40 patients) for levofloxacin. Patients' demographics, detailed information about the switch and data about reduction in cost will be shown on the poster. Compared with utilisation of the drugs in the same period in 2009, a decrease of 8,61% in absolute number of intravenous vials was seen. More in detail, the decrease was 9,73% for paracetamol, 10,83% for clindamycin and 5,59% for levofloxacin, as compared to the data of 2009. The same comparison was performed in ''adjusted'' defined daily doses (DDD); adjusted DDD of 0.5 g, 1.8 g and 4 g were used for levofloxacin, clindamycin and paracetamol respectively. This comparison resulted in an overall decrease of 7,3% compared to utilisation data expressed in DDD during the same period of last year, corresponding to a decrease of 9,37%, 13,59% and 5,59%, for paracetamol, clindamycin and levofloxacin, respectively. Discussion & Conclusion A poster campaign followed by direct contact with the prescribing physicians is definitely useful to promote an early IV to oral switch. The advantages and the economic impact of sequential therapy are of great importance and should be regularly brought under attention. Pro-active projects, like ours, are especially suited to repeat several times a year. Keywords sequential therapy",

Introduction Epidemiologic studies hypothesized that vitamin C administration may have beneficial effects in patients with end stage renal failure (ESRD). Its prescription was associated with improvement in hemoglobin levels and a decrease in erythropoietin requirements which may lead to lessen the potential adverse outcome associated with anemia and the use of recombinant erythropoietin. From the other hand, the results of previous studies were some encouraging but not overwhelming for vitamin C as a protector against cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, increasing evidences support a role of oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defense in pathogenesis of accelerated atherogenesis in these patients.

            "text": "Linezolid prescriptions in university hospital Lapeyronie -Arnaud de Villeneuve of Montpellier are mainly in accordance with the recommended indications. However some treatments were off-label. In some cases, the prescription could be justified by the patient history. Our anti-infective committee must establish guidelines for prophylaxis with this profile of patients (MRSA carrier and kidney failure). Also, a faster treatment revaluation could be considered. Introduction Since January 2010, our pharmacy department has referenced a new oral anticoagulant, dabigatran etexilate. It is a direct thrombin inhibitor without specific monitoring. The drug is used to prevent venous thromboembolism events after orthopeadic surgery such as total hip or knee replacement. The objective is to investigate the good prescription and adverse effects of this new anticoagulant in our orthopeadic surgery department. The pharmacist works in a decentralized pharmaceutical unit within the department. The prescription is computerized. Materials & Methods A local protocol PRADAXA is established in collaboration with the anaesthetists. Indications and contraindications are specified. It consists in an injection of enoxaparin 6 h after surgery closure instead of the recommended one capsule 1 to 4 h after surgery, continuing with two capsules of dabigatran at set time (6 pm) orally the days after. Two protocols exist (PRA110 and PRA75) because dosage adaptation can be necessary. A data entry form is established to gather all the details. The study was realized over three months. Results Good prescription: of 119 patients allowed for total hip or knee replacement, 41 had a prescription of dabigatran i.e. 34,5%. On 41 patients, 24 received dabigatran at 110 mg and 15 at 75 mg. All the patients having received the dosage 75 mg were patients of more than 75 years. Parts of the other patients were excluded because of contraindications or risk of non observance. Others because some prescribers did not want or know how to use the protocol. Among the 41 prescritpions, there were 1 cancellation and 3 stops.",

            "text": "Discussion & Conclusion There were 7 pharmaceutical interventions i.e. 17,1% of prescriptions. The pharmacist intervened for the modification of 3 prescriptions for wrong dosage. Prescriptions were modified before first grip. On two occasions, there was a redundant prescription of enoxaparin with no consideration of the dabigatran prescription. But no double administration of enoxaparin occured. Two patients were under dabigatran 75 mg without any explication despite our questioning. Dabigatran avoids an injection to the patient and seems to have a good profile of tolerance that still needs to be investigated. That is why dabigatran stays in controlled prescription in our establishment. A particular attention will be taken for new indications and the future diagnosis test that could reassure prescribers. Introduction For patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), airways colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is deleterious and requires numerous and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. However, high doses of antibiotics may destroy a patient's venous capital. For this reason, the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) is gaining popularity in this population. PICCs are introduced from an upper extremity vein to the superior vena cava and remains there during the entire course of therapy. In this study, we evaluated 1/ the efficiency and 2/ the patients' and nurses' satisfaction with these catheters. Materials & Methods For the first objective, we retrospectively studied success rate of PICCs introduction and incidence of adverse events in patients who had at least one PICC inserted between October 2006 and December 2009 in 2 CF centers, one pediatric and one adult, at the University hospital of Grenoble. Satisfaction was evaluated by addressing questionnaires prospectively to 12 CF adult patients for whom one PICC was inserted over a 3-months period (January to March 2010) and to their nurses (2 hospital, 7 liberal) . This study was performed in the pneumology ward with the presence of a clinical pharmacist. Results During the retrospective 38-months period, 47 CF patients (mean age = 23 yrs-old, range = 4-56) received a PICC. For these patients, we considered 125 procedures (average of 2.6 PICCs per patient; range = 1-9). The success rate of PICCs insertion was 93.6% (117/125). Regarding adverse events, one patient suffered from a Candida albicans septicemia and 4 thromboses were diagnosed, 2 in the same patient. The removal of 4 PICCs (3,2%) occurred for various other reasons. Overall, the success rate was 85,6% (107/125).",

So, posology of these medicines must be adapted to kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Reevaluation was considered null in 9 (11%), partial in 47 (56%) and complete in 27 (33%). In case of complete reevaluation, antibiotherapy modifications were present in 75% and treatment was maintained in 60% in case of partial or null reevaluation. Out of 40 changes, 1/3 involved antibiotic substitution, in 28% addition or withdrawal of an antibiotic and in 24% a change in the mode of administration. Dosage was modified in 14%, dose in 10%, interval of administration in 4%. Reevaluation was explained and recorded in the patient file in 80% of cases. Discussion & Conclusion In antibiotherapy, the concept of reevaluation is important as it gives to the clinician a ''second chance'' to improve his prescription and the global medical management of the patient. After completion of this audit, several actions are planned: forwarding the results back to the units (prescribers and nurses), explanation of the concept of reevaluation and guidelines to stimulate and improve systematic reevaluation of antibiotic prescription, creating a formulary named ''therapeutic reevaluation and traceability'' to include it in the computerized patient file. This audit will be renewed in the next year to assess the impact of these corrective actions. The institutional traceability support for the daily clinical monitoring of peripheral venous catheters was present in 71.4% of the nursing records and was filled in in 64.6% of cases. The insertion date of the catheter was found for 89% of patients but was written on the dressing of the catheter in only 7.3% of cases. Discussion & Conclusion In 2007, decisions and training actions permitted to replace infusion bottles by infusion bags (in order to avoid air embolism) and to withdraw flow control devices (according to the 2007 AP-HP guidelines) without generating an overuse of infusion pumps. The good use of bidirectional valves, in particular for the lock of peripheral KVO without infusion, was part of the training plan set up for the nursing staff. At present, the remaining irrelevant indication of KVO infusion, the underuse of bidirectional valves and the necessary improvement of the clinical monitoring traceability of catheters raise the fact that the training plan must be reactivated to provide practice guidelines for infusion therapy to the nursing staff. Introduction The main risk factor for occurrence of side effect (SE) is the number of drugs taken. Assess regularly drugs indication and dosage is one way to prevent these SE.

Average patients' age was 66.92 + 10.23 years. The youngest patient had 41 years, and the oldest 87 years. There were 73 males and 82 females. One-third of participants were found to have mild depression (58/155; 34%), and 25% have moderate to severe depression. Only 13% patients were under antidepressant treatment, althought 63% take benzodiazepines. Gender did not influence the severity of depression in patients with stroke(pv 2 = 0.087). Anxiety was statistically more frequent among stroke patients (pv 2 = 0.003). Stroke patients had worse results in daily living domain of life quality. Discussion & Conclusion Post-stroke depression is the most frequent psychiatric complication of stroke.

However, there is no consensus about the best chemotherapeutic agent or optimal treatment regimen.The phase II Lipiothep trial was designed to compare the efficacy and the toxicity of TACE with or without amiodarone, a multidrug resistance inhibitor, in the palliative treatment of HCC. Materials & Methods The protocol was approved by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sanitaire des Produits de Sant\u00e9 and by the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Est I. From 2006 to 2008, 27 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive four courses of TACE every six weeks. The treatment consisted in an injection of pirarubicin 50 mg and lipiodol 20 ml with amiodarone 150 mg (arm 1) or without amiodarone (arm 2). The treatment response was evaluated two months after the last course according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and then every four months. Patients were monitored for adverse events by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 2.0. Analyses were done by intention to treat. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.

Grange 2 1 Service pharmacie, H\u00f4pital Charcot, Caudan, 2 Service g\u00e9riatrie, H\u00f4pital de Riantec, Riantec, France Introduction The midazolam is frequently prescribed in palliative care. Its use for sedation remains controversial and requires due caution and good clinical practice. Guidelines concerning sedation have been issued by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise d'Accompagnement et de soins Palliatifs and the European Association for Palliative Care. The overall aim of this study is to describe the current practices concerning the midazolam in the palliative care unit of the hospital of Port Louis-Riantec and to analyse them in relation to guidelines. Materials & Methods A systematic retrospective analysis of the medical records of all patients who received midazolam in the palliative care unit between January 2008 and April 2010 was performed. Data regarding indication, administration route, dosage, adverse events and drugs mixed with midazolam in the syringe were collected. For the patients whose clinical status required sedation, additional data were gathered: indication of the sedation, dosage, continuous or discontinuous nature of the infusion, sedation duration, and informations about the decision-making process (patient consent). Results 172 patients were hospitalized during this period and midazolam was prescribed to 70 of these patients. The indications for the use of midazolam were mainly anxiety (60%), restlessness (20%), insomnia (7%) and convulsions (7%). The midazolam was well tolerated but a decreased respiratory rate was reported for 8 patients who had a co-prescription of morphinics. Sedation was required for 13 patients. The indications for sedation were terminal restlessness, (39%), existential distress (31%), refractory pain (10%), convulsions (10%) and severe terminal dyspnoea (10%). In all cases, the indications complied with guidelines. The wide dose range of midazolam emphasizes the need for careful titration of dose for each patient. The dose required for the titration was reported in 7 medical records. The level of alertness was regularly assessed and recorded in the medical charts but the Rudkin score recommended in french guidelines was rarely used. Consent was obtained from 6 patients and reported in their medical records. In all cases, general measures as ensuring a peaceful environment, pursuing mouth care or discontinuing non essential treatments were done, as recommended in guidelines.",

Herbrecht 2 , L. Beretz 1 1 Pharmacy, 2 Oncology-Hematology, Hopitaux Universitaires De Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France Introduction Background and Objective: Most patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are curable by chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease may be offered high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation or various salvage treatments that still need to be optimized. Gemcitabine alone or in combination has been tested in pretreated patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. The major aim of our work was to evaluate the off-label use of gemcitabine combined with oxaliplatin in patients pretreated for a Hodgkin lymphoma. Results Over the study period, ten patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (mean age at the time of diagnosis: 31 years; range: 16-57) were treated by gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Most of the patients (n = 6) had nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma. At the time of initial diagnosis, five patients had stage II disease, two patients had stage III disease and three patients has stage IV disease. The combination was used in highly pretreated (median number of prior chemotherapies: 5; range 2-7). Seven patients had received high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. Gemcitabine (1g/m 2 ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m 2 ) were given every other week. Two patients also received rituximab with the association. All patients were evaluable for response. One patient achieved a complete response and one achieved a partial response after 2 and 3 cycles, respectively. Patients with progressive disease (n = 8) were treated by other agents and 3 of them achieved a complete response. Currently, six patients are alive. The patient with complete response died a month later of infectious complication. The patient with partial response died of tumour evolution. Among evaluable patients for tolerance (n = 7), five patients developed grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity. One patient experienced neurologic disorders and one patient had a bronchitis. Discussion & Conclusion Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin were used off-label in patients highly pretreated for a Hodgkin lymphoma. In line with the literature, the association showed limited activity in heavily pretreated patients.",

Bohand * Introduction Patients' quality of life during and after chemotherapy emerged as an important outcome parameter alongside the tumor response. Supportive therapy became an integral part of anticancer therapy to limit therapy-associated toxicity. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is often regarded as the most distressing adverse effect experienced by patient receiving cytotoxic drugs. However, significant developments have been made in supportive care for the management of chemotherapy-induced CINV. In this study, pharmacists play an important role in counselling physician on appropriate antiemetic therapy, selecting suitable antiemetics together with convenient dosing regimens. Materials & Methods A six month preliminary survey was conducted in patients with single day chemotherapy (minimum of 6 days between two administrations). 50 patients were included in the survey. On the day of chemotherapy, patients' demographics, risk factors and history of nausea and vomiting were assessed via patient interview by pharmacists. Patients were also asked whether they were anxious by character. A standard diary was used to collate clinical events, including number of nausea and vomiting agents after chemotherapy. Use of breakthrough antimetics and unscheduled visits to the physician, clinics, or hospitals due to nausea and vomiting were documented.",

A two-drug combination (5-HT3/corticosteroids) was used before chemotherapy of moderate emetic risk. For delayed emesis corticosteroids were used with or without aprepitant. Results No patient was lost to follow up and no patient was excluded from data analysis due to incomplete information. Neither acute nor delayed vomiting was reported by a majority of patients, acute vomiting was experienced by 12% of patients and delayed vomiting by only 6%. Acute and delayed nausea was reported by 34% of patients. The highest incidence of nausea was generally reported on day 2 of chemotherapy and gradually reduced over the next days. 12% of patients received benzodiazepines before administration of the chemotherapy to reduce anxiety. Discussion & Conclusion Specific variables such as risk factors for CINV, together with patients' ability to adhere to medication regimens, must be considered in the selection of antiemetics to optimize the goal of eliminating CINV and improving treatment outcome. The implementation of pharmaceutical care might also improve communication between health care professionals and support the idea of a multidisciplinary team approach. Introduction The pharmacokinetics of carbapenem antibiotics, imipenem, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem, is characterized by a large inter-and intra-individual variability depending on the site of infection, the bacteria and many drug interactions. Individualized dose adjustment is therefore crucial in order to optimize treatment efficiency and to prevent adverse reactions, especially in critical care patients. Currently there is no method for the simultaneous determination of these four antibiotics.",

The major advantage of this assay was sample preparation by a 20 min centrifugation with Amicon \u00d2 Ultra (Millipore) for the free form extraction of each antibiotic. Separation was achieved on a C18 column 4.6 mm x 150 mm with a mobile phase composed of phosphate buffer 10 mM (pH 7) with concentrated orthophosphoric acid and acetonitrile in gradient elution mode. Detection was performed at 300 nm for carbapenems and 230 nm for flucloxacilline.The analytical validation was conducted according to recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration [1] . Results The analysis time was less than 15 min. Retention times were as follows: 2.7, 6.6, 7.5, 8.5 and 13 min respectively for imipenem, doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem and flucloxacilline. The assay was specific and linear for each compound over the concentration range of 1 to 50 lg/mL, with correlation coefficients over 0.991. Intra-and interday validation studies showed accuracy between 84.88-113.76% and 89.56-105.88% respectively, precision below 10.58% and 8.02% respectively.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the pro-drug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), is an immunosuppressant being used increasingly for remission maintenance after induction therapy in SLE patients. In kidney transplantees, MPA plasma concentrations monitoring after MMF administration improved patient outcomes over currently recommended fixed-dose strategy. Conversely, no recommendations for MMF therapeutic optimization are available in a non-transplant setting, and very few data on its pharmacokinetics (PK) have been published in SLE. Our objective was to determine whether MPA PK under combined MMF and prednisone maintenance therapy can predict SLE clinical flares.",

To improve the cytotoxic medicine preparation process, hospital preparation units' chemical contamination is assessed using platin as a tracer of contamination. This work evaluates flasks' chemical contamination and the impact of the plastic film on carboplatin flasks. Materials & Methods First, different flasks are evaluated during hospital investigations: glass surface of oxaliplatin and cisplatin flasks and plastic film surface of carboplatin flasks. Then, other carboplatin flasks are studied because of a special packaging including a thermo welded plastic film around the flask glass surface. Surfaces are sampled with a moistened swab desorbed in water. Samples are dosed by graphic furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after preconcentration. The limit of detection and quantification are 2 ng and 6 ng of platin per sample respectively. Results Investigations show a chemical contamination in 48% oxaliplatin flasks (n = 25, average 5 ng, maximum 50 ng), in 27% cisplatin (n = 27, average 4 ng, maximum 66 ng) and in 25% carboplatin flasks (n = 20, average 1 ng, maximum 4 ng). 8 glass surfaces out of 10 carboplatin flasks directly out from the firm, are contaminated (average 11 ng, median 4 ng, maximum 62,2 ng). The film surface directly on contact with the flask is less contaminated (4 flasks, average 3 ng, maximum 14,2 ng).",

Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS programme. Results In this cohort, 58.6% used folic acid supplements during pregnancy. The use of folic acid was markedly lower in women of Arab/Turkish and other non-Western ethnicities (p = 0.003). Factors like early booking for antenatal visits (p = 0.001), understanding of physicians' spoken language (p = 0.004), and following education in Western countries (p = 0.006) were positively associated with folic acid intake. The most important risk factors of low folic acid use included low educational attainment [OR: 0.46 (95% CI: 0.27-0.79)] and low socio-economic status [OR: 0.40 (95% CI: 0.23-0.69)]. Discussion & Conclusion The antenatal use of folic acid was significantly lower in Arab/Turkish and other non-Western immigrant women. This can likely be attributed to lower education and lower socio-economic status (the most important risk factors), as well as poor understanding of the physicians' spoken language.

The purpose of our study was to determine the explanatory factors of cost, and to evaluate the induction-related cost of patients with diagnosed AML and included in the AML 2001 trial.Materials & MethodsThis study was performed from the French Public Health Insurance perspective. Only direct medical costs were included: hospitalisation data, chemotherapy regimens, colony stimulating factor consumption. Hospital resources were calculated using different methods based on the: 1/ local per diem hospitalisation (analytical accounting system); 2/ French public Diagnosis-Related Group database. Multiple linear regression was used to search for explanatory factors and to evaluate the induction-related cost.

Before supplentation, the mean estimated creatinine clearance (MDRD) was 82.5 ml per minute[40;185].Before supplementation, all patients were found to be vitamin D-deficient: 27/43 had vitamin D levels below 10 nmol per liter and 16/43 a level between 10 and 42 nmol per liter. The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin level was 10.4 nmol per liter.After supplementation, 13/26 patients were over the clinically meaningful threshold of 60 nmol per liter. The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 57.8 nmol per liter [19; 98]. Discussion & Conclusion Our study goes on. We can now record the impact of the adjusted vitamin D level on the number of falls in the unit.The oral administration of 2 three-monthly vials of 200 000 UI vitamin D allows us to improve the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin level. Because of the vitamin D properties, physicians should be encouraged to check and monitor patients' serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Data concerning patients, drugs, intervention, documentation, approval (if needed), and estimated impact were compiled. The four pharmacists participating were from Belgium (B), France (F), Quebec (Q) and Switzerland (S). Results A total of 996 interventions were collected: 129 (13%) in B, 238 (24%) in F, 278 (28%) in Q and 351 (35%) in S. These interventions targeted 269 patients (median 22 month-old, 52% male): 69 (26%) in B, 88 (33%) in F, 56 (21%) in Q and in S. These data were collected during 28 non consecutive days in the clinical unit in B, 59 days in F, 42 days in Q and 63 days in S. The main drug-related problems were inappropriate administration technique (293, 29%), untreated indication (254, 25%) and supra therapeutic dosage (106, 11%). The pharmacist's interventions concerned mainly administration mode optimization (223, 22%), dose adjustment (200, 20%) and therapeutic monitoring (164, 16%). The three major drug classes leading to interventions were anti-infectives for systemic use (233, 23%) and alimentary tract and metabolism drugs (218, 22%). Interventions concerned mainly residents and all clinical staff (209, 21%). Among the 879 (88%) interventions requiring a physician's approval, 731 (83%) were accepted. Interventions were considered as having a moderate (51%) or major (17%) clinical impact. Among the interventions provided, 10% were considered to have an economical positive impact. Differences and similarities between countries will be presented at the poster session. Discussion & Conclusion Decentralized pharmacist at patient bedside is a pre-requisite for pharmaceutical care. There are limited studies comparing the activity of clinical pharmacists between countries.

Results 422 Hospital pharmacists (218 respondents from France and 204 from Quebec) were recruited. Results showed that pharmacists from France published more than those from Quebec, even when considering factors such as time worked and gender. We noted a significant difference between the respondents who had published and not published for 18 of the 28 predictive factors and an absolute variance of at least 20% for five professional factors and five factors related to team dynamics and motivation. The ratio of respondents working in a University Health Center was lower in France than in Quebec (46 vs. 70%, p = 0.001) as was the ratio of respondents who had indicated a mastery of English in France than in Quebec (43 vs. 88%, p = 0.001). This study highlighted seven predictive factors: practicing hospital pharmacy in France, being male, having academic duties or a PhD, having participated in a clinical trial, having secured funding in one's own name for a research project and the number of hours of work put in during a week.

Introduction Antibiotic therapy (AT) for urinary tract infections and colonisations have been analysed to evaluate their conformity with guidelines. Materials & Methods A 2 month prospective study was conducted in 8 neurological rehabilitation clinical units by pharmacist and physician. Data collection included information about patient (age, weight, creatinine clearance, urinary catheterization use), infection (symptoms, bacteriological data) and AT (drugs, dosage, duration). Clinical practices were compared to local guidelines: (a) antibiotic choice matched recommendations and antibiogram results, (b) dosage schedule was conform, (c) for empiric treatment, initial AT was revaluated after 48 h, (d) written on patient medical file; (e) if it was possible a de-escalation was realized. (f) The AT duration was adequate: cystitis: 7-10 days, pyelonephritis: 10-21 days, prostatitis: 3-6 weeks, urinary colonization treatment previous an invasive act: 7-10 days or previous indwelling catheter: 48-72 h. Results 31 AT were reported corresponding to 28 patients (44 \u00b119 years old). 71% of patients were urinary catheterized. 52% were treated for bacterial colonization mostly before catheter removal or urodynamic testing. 26% had prostatitis and 22% cystitis. Antibiotics combinations were used for 32% cases. (a) 45% AT presented devi-Discussion & Conclusion Antibiotics were often prescribed to asymptomatic bacteriuria before an invasive act. Even if most of prescriptions match guidelines, deviations were notified. Three main points have to be improved: treatment duration, de-escalation and overuse of fluoroquinolone. Adequate AT duration and de-escalation minimized the risk of emerging resistance. Prescribing a fluoroquinolone as an empiric AT is not recommended due to the resistance rate. Gap in current local guidelines have been identified especially for AT before indwelling catheter removal and urodynamic testing. This study has lead to create a multidisciplinary group to manage correction actions and redefine local guidelines to improve antibiotics use and quality of care.

So, the treatment is prepared in front of the door of each room, and then dispensed at once to the patient, three times a day. A test of simultaneous preparation/distribution was set up in the unit to minimize errors and optimize time. After a short time of use of this new system of dispensation, the carriage was definitively adopted.

This may conduct the clinicians to reduce the dose of the drug administered. Dose reductions causes are mentioned by the prescriber through our Computerized Prescribing Order Entry System (CPOE). Materials & Methods In this context, we led a retrospective evaluation of dose reductions for chemo-induced neuropathies (all NCI-CTC (National Cancer Institute, Common Toxicity Criteria) grade included). This study set up at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital during five months (from September 2009 to January 2010).Using the statistics tool of our CPOE system (Chimio, Computer Engineering), we extracted the number of patients for whom a dose reduction related to neuropathy was performed, the drugs involved and the total amount of patients treated by these drugs. We used the Theriaque on-line drugs database in order to establish the list of the drugs that induce neuropathy with their respective frequency (multicriteria search: anticancer drugs and neuropathy adverse event). Discussion & Conclusion These results are in line with those mentioned by Theriaque (1 to 10%) except for Oxaliplatin, for which we noticed a higher rate in our study. The withdrawal of Calcium and Magnesium supplementation in the chemotherapy protocols, following the results of the Hochster et al study(ASCO 2008), that suggested a negative impact of these ions on the overall survival, might explain this result for Oxaliplatin. Hochster's results were not confirmed by other studies. The results of our retrospective study led us to reintroduce Calcium and Magnesium before and after the administration of Oxaliplatin in our protocols. Monitoring the dose reduction operated by the clinicians allows us to follow the occurrence of adverse events and be proactive in the amendment of the protocols consecutively.Effect of intravenous (IV) calcium and magnesium (Ca/Mg) versus placebo on response to FOLFOX+bevacizumab (BEV) in the CONcePT trial.

These medications have a heightened risk of causing harm when they are used in error. Nevertheless, delivering continuous infusion is a complex process including dose calculation, evaluation of drugs or diluents compatibility, and simultaneous infusion through a single line. Since 2009, we have been putting in place preventive strategies to reduce the risk of error with continuous infusions of high-alert medications in a medical-surgical ICU.Materials & Methods Information about current practices was collected via an independent double-check. Risk assessment was performed by a multidisciplinary team (clinical pharmacist, physicians, and nurses). In accordance with the recommendations of the Institute of Safe Medication Practices (2008), organisational and clinical changes were implemented. The ordering, storage, preparation and administration of the drugs were standardized. Data regarding solvents, drug compatibility and drug stability were collected from the drug monograph and from literature. The drugs were grouped according to their medical indication, pH, chemical structure and similar compatibility (V Kahman 2003). All data were summarized in reference documents, and pre-printed labels. Results A daily independent double-check was conducted. Drug concentrations were adapted to the treatment needs, to the standardized expression of the dose and for the facilitation of the calculation of flow rate. Abbreviations were excluded. A drug manipulation chart of 34 drugs was created with the following topics: route of administration, drug concentration, modalities of dilution, conservation, stability, protection from light, a flow rate chart and the range of usual dosage. Drugs were separated into four groups: cardiovascular drugs, opiates and sedatives, miscellaneous drugs, and incompatible drugs. Intragroup incompatibility were excluded and drugs that belonged to the same group were infused simultaneously through the same line. A complete table of drug compatibility was established. Drug delivery devices were identified by pre-printed labels including drug name, drug concentration, modalities of dilution, drug compatibility group, date and hour of preparation. Discussion & Conclusion A multidisciplinary team partook in the process improvement. Interventions were implemented to prevent harm from hight-alert medications. Clinical pharmacist provided drug and compatibility information. To facilitate the procedure for nurses, the drug manipulation chart and pre-printed labels were adapted in observance of their suggestions. The clinical team approved all policies. After education and training, the ICU team easily adopted the new practices.Keywords High-alert medications, ICU, Risk management Medication order validation: reproducibility inter-pharmacists C.

Boateng 2 Pharmacy, Clinical Centre Banjaluka, Banjaluka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2 Clinical pharmacy, Barts and The London NHS Trust, London, United KingdomIntroduction Acute meningitis is a potentially life-threatening neurological emergency which requires rapid diagnosis and early administration of appropriate empirical therapy. Around 1.2 million cases of acute meningitis occur every year in the world, resulting in 135,000 deaths. Mortality rates range from 2% to 30% while risk for developing neurologic sequelae (seizures, sensorineural hearing loss, hydrocephalus, etc) is as high as 30% to 50% for meningitis patients. The Barts and the London Trust (BLT) guidelines give recommendations for the clinical and pharmacological management of patients with suspected meningitis/encephalitis. The compliance to these guidelines was assessed along with the use of corticosteroids by prescribers.Materials & Methods A retrospective audit for the time period of 1 st Jan 2008 to 21 st May 2009 was carried out in order to determine the level of compliance to the Trust guidelines in empirical treatment and the use of corticosteroids in acute meningitis which was the primary outcome of the study. Clinical assessment, presence of meningitis signs and symptoms and timing of empirical therapy were also examined. Patients were identified from CSF specimens sent to the Microbiology department from five wards in the BLT. Results 29 patients with suspected meningitis were identified. Two had confirmed diagnosis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was initiated in line with the BLT guidelines in only 38% of patients. While the choice of antimicrobials was mostly appropriate (88.9% with antibiotics and 76% with antivirals), dose of drugs where often smaller than recommended (in 45% patients on antibiotics and in 35% patients on antivirals). The ward pharmacist intervened for the change of antimicrobial dose to an appropriate one in two patients which was accepted 1 or 2 days after the treatment start. Empirical treatment was delayed more than 6 h from admission in 30% of patients receiving antibiotics and 47% of patients receiving antivirals. Corticosteroids were not used in empirical treatment any of the 29 patients.Discussion & Conclusion After identifying fairly low level of compliance in empirical antimicrobial treatment as well as significant delays in start of therapy, a suitable strategy for the improvement has to be developed. BLT guidelines need to be more specific about treatment start as well as the recommendation for the use of corticosteroids in line with the newest evidence. After guidelines review, education of junior physicians is needed with implementation of better liaison with Microbiology department including the Microbiology pharmacist for obtaining information on proper choice, dosing and timing of antimicrobial and antiinflamatory management of suspected acute meningitis/encephalitis.Proulx, N., Frechette, D., Toye, B. et al (2005) Delays in the administration of antibiotics are associated with mortality from acute bacterial meningitis.

Favier 1 Pharmacy, 2 Biostatistics, 3 Surgery, 4 Medical Oncology, Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard, Lyon Cedex 08, France Introduction Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) is one of the leading causes of death by cancer in Europe. In the 90's, Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin treatments represent the traditional chemotherapeutic treatment for stage IV colorectal cancer while, in the last decade, molecular targeting drugs such as Bevacizumab (BEVA) or anti-EGFR antibodies (Cetuximab and Panitumumab) were introduced in the therapeutic strategy. Since 2004, published phase III trials of combinative treatment regimens of mCRC using these new therapies have demonstrated substantial improvements of the median overall survival (OS). The aim of the study was thus to evaluate overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed with mCRC before and after the approval of BEVA and cetuximab (CETUX) in France, in current medical practice. Materials & Methods A sample of patients, diagnosed with a mCRC and receiving at least one intraveinous anticancer chemotherapy was selected from the Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard (French National Cancer Institute) cohort. Group A consists of consecutive patients diagnosed between January 1992 and December 1999; group B were diagnosed between January 2004 and December 2007. Tumor type and histological grading, type of drug therapy, number of lines of chemotherapy and patient outcome were compared using the chisquared test or the log-rank test. A Cox regression analysis was then performed to highlight independent prognostic factors. Results 321 patients were enrolled over the two periods, 142 in the group A and 179 in the group B. 62% of the patients of the group B received at least one molecular targeting drug. The two groups were comparable (general characteristics of the patients, tumour type and metastasis characteristics) except for the histological grade of the initial tumour. The overall rate of metastasis resection was 43% and no significant difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.31). The median number of lines of chemotherapy was similar in the two groups (=3). The median survival time was 28 months for both groups group A and group B (p = 0.38). Univariant analysis showed that the factors associated with a significant impact on OS were: Performance Status (PS), age, grade and metastasis resection. A multivariate Cox model showed that metastasis resection was associated with a five fold reduced risk of death (HR: 0.2 [0.14;0.28]). Discussion & Conclusion Despite the implementation of numerous novel chemotherapeutic agents, the overall survival of patients with mCRC has not improved over the last decade on the scale of our institution.

So it seemed important to take stock of its use in our hospital since its marketing in 2007. Materials & Methods A retrospective study of medical records of patients. A questionnaire was developed to collect indication, dosage, previous disease-modifying drugs, combination with methotrexate (MTX), adjunct treatments, efficiency and tolerance. Results Over the study period (12/2007-05/2010), 31 patients received this drug. The sex ratio was 0.2 and the average age, 59.7\u00b116. -Indication. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 97% of cases and ankylosing spondylitis in 3% (1 patient). -Dosage. Amid the 31 patients, 1 (3%) did not receive the recommended dose: 750 vs 500 mg. -Previous disease-modifying drugs. All patients received them before starting Orencia\u00d2. The average number was 4. The nonbiological DMARDs accounted for 52% with, in order of decreasing frequency: MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, ciclosporine, hydroxychloroquine and golden salts. The biotherapy represented 48% with etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, rituximab and anakinra. Only 1 patient (3%) did not receive a TNFblocker. -Combination with MTX. 32% received it. Among the 21 patients without MTX, the cause of arrest was intolerance for 86%, ineffectiveness for 5% and unknown for 9%. -Adjunct treatments. They concerned 18 patients (58%): corticoids for 78%, NSAIDs, 22%, and analgesics, 28%. -Efficiency. The average duration of treatment was 14.7\u00b18.2 months. Orencia\u00d2 was found effective in 23 patients (74%) among whom 35% received MTX. It was considered as ineffective in 4 patients (13%). In these cases the inefficiency resulted in discontinuation of treatment, after 7 months on average. For the 4 last ones we missed elements to judge the efficiency. -Tolerance. It was globally good for 42% (13 patients). 71%",

Therefore, their reimbursement to hospitals is possible if their use is based on official labelling (OL) and published scientific data. The aim of this audit is to describe the use of BMS or Drug Eluting Stents (DES) between 2006 and 2009 and to compare BMS medical practices for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) to OL. Materials & Methods This audit is a retrospective study performed in collaboration with the cardiology unit. Every patients treated by coronary stent implantation from 2006 to 2009 in our institution were included. For the audit, we selected only patients treated by BMS. The analysis of use was performed by angioplasty as conformity to the OL: Short lesion length (L\\20mm), Severe stenosis ([70% by visual assessment), Coronary dissection or occlusion. The reimbursement terms include the number of BMS used (1 BMS by lesion or 2 per artery, and 3 BMS in cases of dissection). Data were collected through the base of the Cardiology Unit. We studied patient's characteristics: age, sex, CAD risk factors and characteristics of angioplasty (type of lesion, indication). Results Between 2006 and 2009, 3 372 patients underwent coronary angioplasty with 4 798 stents implanted. The mean age was 65 \u00b1 13 years",

Papo 2 Clinical Pharmacy, 2 Internal Medicine, Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital AP-HP, Paris Cedex 18, FranceIntroduction The adult Still disease is a rare inflammatory arthritis. It's characterized by fever above 39\u00b0C, skin rash, pharynx or muscle pain, leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes level. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, many proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1, 6 and 8. The evolution of the disease is unpredictable. A 52-years-old woman with Still disease was admitted in January 2010 with fever associated with chills and arthritis. Symptoms disappeared with prednisone 50 mg/d and recurred with dose decrease (30 mg/d).Materials & Methods Bibliographic research: Pubmed, Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 and regional center of pharmacovigilance Results Corticosteroids were decreased and anakinra, a recombinant form of IL-1 receptor antagonist, was introduced in March 2010, leading to a dramatic clinical improvement. Two weeks later, marked inflammatory lesions at the injection sites led to discontinuation of anakinra therapy. Biopsies were concordant with anakinra toxicity as described elsewhere and HHV6 and 7 PCR remains negative. Lesions spontaneously improve within a few days. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6, was proposed as 3rd line treatment. The first infusion of tocilizumab at a dose of 480 mg after premedication by dexchlorpheniramine shows no immediate adverse event. After 4 weeks, blood counts and inflammatory parameters were within normal range. Tolerance of tolicizumab was excellent without flu-like symptoms, fever, cough, nor infection. The patient is currently under 20 mg of steroids with a decrease of 10 mg every 15 days and her physical status completely improves.Discussion & Conclusion this case report shows the difficulty of the management of steroid-dependant Still disease and the lack of EMEA-approved label alternative despite convincing evidence of targeted therapy efficiency. Clinical pharmacists act in concert with physicians for the best patient management and safety.Introduction Systemic autoimmune disease management could be different between two medicals departments and sometimes in the same department. The CYP IV's fabrication is made at the centralized unit for cytotoxic drug preparations of the pharmacy. The pharmaceutic validation is difficult because of a lack of uniform prescription between the clinical units. The aim of this study is to assess the CYP IV use in autoimmune disease in nephrology department at the first time.Materials & Methods A litterature review and a 3 years retrospective study were made in medicals and pharmacy departments. Datas from prescription and patients files were collected. Then, population characteristics, indications, and prescriptions adherence to recommanded therapeutic strategies were evaluated. Results Thirty one patients (23 females / 8 males) received intermittent CYP IV: 19 patients (62%) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 6 patients (19%) with Wegener's granuloma (WG) and 6 patients (19%) with other vascularitis .",

The recent DRIVE study, designed to evaluate the efficacy of IV ferric gluconate in such patients, showed an increase of haemoglobin levels (Hb) when patients received IV iron therapy. In our haemodialysis centre, two different protocols were examined. First, from July 2008 to January 2009, iron dose was adjusted according to the ferritin level. Then, from February 2009 to December 2009, iron dose was adapted to reach a target value for transferrin saturation (TSAT C 20%), whatever the ferritin level was. Impacts of this protocol modification on the iron test and hepatic functions were then analysed. Materials & Methods 182 eligible patients were involved in our monocentric study: entry criteria were haemodialysis for at least one year and no more than 3 months of absence after inclusion in the study. Median age was 67 (range, 30-95). Biologic parameters included a monthly iron test (TSAT, ferritin level, C reactive protein, Hb) and a hepatic function test every six months (Alanine Amino Transferase ALT, total bilirubin, Gamma Glutamyl Transferase GGT, Alkaline Phosphatase ALP).ResultsPatients received an average dose of 284 mg of IV iron in July 2008. It reached 710 mg in March 2009 and then decreased to 412 mg in December 2009. On the first period, the average TSAT level reached 27.3% [25.2 to 29.4%], ferritin 602 lmol/L [555 to 681lmol/L] and Hb 114g/L [113 to 116g/L]. Then, for the second period, we respectively obtained 33.2% [23.9 to 38.1%], 961lmol/ L [683 to 1154 lmol/L] and 117g/l [113 to 119 g/L]. Regarding hepatic functions, the average ALT level increased from 19.9 (July 2008) to 20.3 UI/L (December 2009), with a maximum of 23.1 UI/L in January 2009.

Patients are frequently treated with VKA (vitamin-K antagonist). Due to high inter-patient and intra-patient variability, the therapeutic dose of VKA must be individually monitored using international normalized ratio (INR) values. Many studies have evaluated the influence of influenza vaccination on INR variations, however with controversial results. The aims of this study were: 1) evaluate INR variation after vaccination 2) assess hemorrhagic linked events. Materials & Methods Patients monitored at the ''Follow-up anticoagulant treatment advice center'' (CSCTA) were contacted by telephone to know their vaccination status against seasonal or H1N1 influenza. The study enrolled 308 patients with 239 vaccinated. Type of treatment and INR values were recorded in CSCTA database. Results At follow-up patients, 76.3% were vaccinated (25% for H1N1 influenza alone). Average vaccination age was 74.5 years (54% male and 46% female), 84.4% of patients were treated with fluidione (most common type of VKA in France) and only 10.6% with warfarin. After vaccination, 60% of patients had stable INR values, 26% increased and 14% decreased (outside target).",

In recent years, use of acid suppression therapy (AST) for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in inpatient settings other than intensive care has become increasingly common, leading to increased drug cost and an avoidable increased risk of adverse events such as hospital acquired pneumonia. Materials & Methods This was an exploratory, prospective pre-and post-intervention study of all patients admitted to the infectious disease ward of Imam Hospital, the major referral one for infectious disease patients in Iran. The study intervention consisted of the use of an internal guideline for SUP that was prepared by clinical pharmacists in accordance with ASHP guidelines, followed by education provided to the physicians who monitored and visited the hospitalized patients. For the 4-month pre-intervention and post-intervention periods, the following data were collected: admitting diagnoses, number and type of SUP risk factors for AST, and type of AST medication used (omeprazole or ranitidine). Exclusions included (a) patients using AST for appropriate gastrointestinal diagnoses at admission, and (b) patients who died during the hospital stay because of a cause other than a gastrointestinal disorder. Rates of AST use were measured for the sample overall, and for patients with and without an indication for SUP. Appropriate use was defined as 1 primary (''absolute'') risk factor (i.e., coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation, or history of gastrointestinal bleed in the last 12 months) or 2 or more secondary (''relative'') risk factors (e.g., use of heparin). Pre-and post-intervention results were compared using the Pearson chi-square test.Results AST use declined from 80.9% (212 of 262) infectious disease ward patients in the pre-intervention period to 47.1% (113 of 240) patients in the post-intervention period (P \\ 0.001). Of 23 patients in the preintervention period with an indication for SUP according to our ASHP-based guideline, 78.3% (n = 18) received AST versus 85.7% (n = 12 of 14) in the post-intervention period (P = 0.575). Of the patients without an indication for SUP, 194 of 239 (81.2%) received AST in the pre-intervention period versus 101 of 226 (44.7%) in the postintervention period (P \\ 0.001). Of the patients who received AST, 194 of 212 (91.5%) did not have an indication for SUP in the preintervention period versus 101 of 113 (89.4%) in the post-intervention period (P = 0.528).",

The k* was used to decide whether an item should be retained, eliminated or revised (fair: k* of 0.40 to 0.59, good: k* of 0.60 to 0.74, excellent: k* of [0.74). The average I-CVI (=scale-CVI/Ave = S-CVI/Ave) was calculated to decide whether the different raters found the global construct of the list to be valid.An inter-rater variability analysis using Cohen's kappa statistic was performed to determine consistency between hospital pharmacists. Ten pharmacists were given 20 detailed patient profiles. Each pharmacist applied the RASP-list to each patient record. The results from each pharmacist were compared with those of 3 academic pharmacists who were highly familiar with the application of the RASP-instrument.

Data were extracted from the 2006-2007 dataset of the Belgian Agency of Health Insurance Funds. The study database contained information about demographic characteristics, drug claims and hospitalizations. Drug substitution was identified as a switch from a generic drug to an originator drug or vice versa during the three months before and after hospitalization. The study was limited to all compounds in drug classes that answered to all of the following criteria: with the highest public expenditure in 2008; that may lead to transition-related problems between ambulatory care and hospital; that are administered for chronic indications; and that included generic drugs.Results The database related to 17,764 patients: the mean age of patients was 65.9 years and 60% of patients were female. In 71% of cases, an originator drug was purchased prior to and following hospitalisation. Similarly, a generic drug was purchased prior to and following hospitalisation in 25% of cases. Some form of drug substitution occurred in 3.9% of cases: a generic drug was replaced by an originator drug in 2.4% of cases and an originator drug was replaced by a generic drug in 1.5% of cases. Drug substitution was most likely to occur for anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products; opioids; potassium-sparing agents; low-ceiling diuretics; high-ceiling diuretics; selective calcium channel blockers with mainly vascular effects; and antidepressants.",

The purpose of this study is to identify specific issues in which pharmacists should be engaged to solve problems by closely investigating the actual situation of the prescribing practice and compliance to identify the factors affecting compliance.Materials & Methods 122 pharmacies in 21 regions were randomly selected, to whom self-recording questionnaires were distributed, requesting information on medication records ('YAKUREKI' in Japanese). Major survey items were 1. patients' attribution, 2. type of facility (hospital or clinic), 3. prescription details, 4.number of coadministered drugs, 5. number of days on prescription, 6. visiting cycle to the pharmacy, 7. dispensing method, 8. key person(s), 9. who visiting the pharmacy to receive prescribed medicine, 10. patient's status of physician visit, 11. compliance, 12. 4 questions related to key person's adherence (efficacy of Donepezil, administration and dosage, side effects, and understanding of AD), 13. perception of efficacy, and 14. positivity of attitude toward the medication. In this analysis, the distribution of responses to the above questions 1 through 14 was compared between the complying and non-complying groups.Results Data of 432 patients were collected. Drugs prescribed were as follows: 88.8% took the drug once a day (after breakfast). A majority, 57.4%, Donepezil tablet was dispensed separately without one-dosepackaging. In 22.0% of the cases, the key person was the patient himself/herself. In 21.8% of the cases, it was their spouses, and in 12.7%, it was their daughters. For compliance, 80% responded that the patients took the drug as instructed. 10.9% said they forgot to take it once or twice a week. 1.0% said they took the drug only once or twice a week, with 0.2% not taking it at all. 7.9% was unknown.In the complying group, more patients visited hospitals themselves. This group understood the 4 items related to adherence to a greater degree. They also perceived a higher degree of efficacy, as well as having a higher degree of positivity of attitude toward treatment, showing significant differences between the two groups. However, no significant differences were found in regards to prescription details, number of coadministered drugs, or dispensing method.Discussion & Conclusion It was found that the key persons' understanding of Donepezil, perception of efficacy, understanding of the AD symptoms, and positivity of the attitude toward the treatment affected compliance or noncompliance, rather than prescription details and dispensing method. Therefore, it is important that pharmacists assist the patients and key persons in feeling the efficacy and improving their positive attitude toward treatment by accurately identifying the key persons and being engaged in such a way that improves adherence.Keywords adherence, Alzheimer's disease, Community pharmacy, compliance",

Treatment regimen was 10 mg/Kg BVZ q2w or BVZ 15 mg/Kg q3w in monotherapy or combined with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide or oral capecitabine or paclitaxel. Response was assessed by measurable disease (RECIST criteria) in both cancers and by serum levels of cancer antigen (CA) 125 and 15.3 in ovarian and breast cancer patients, respectively. Assessments are presented as a function of: type of previous chemotherapy, treatment line, stage, BVZ combination, and baseline tumour marker (CA 125 or 15.3) level. Effectiveness parameters were: response rate (RR), response duration (RD), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Results The study included: 9 ovarian cancer patients previously treated with platinum and taxane; and 10 breast cancer patients, 80% previously treated with anthracycline and taxane. Median number of previous regimens was 6 for ovarian and 5.5 for breast cancer patients. All were in stages III or IV. BVZ was combined with metronomic cyclophosphamide in 88.8% of ovary patients and with paclitaxel in 50% of breast patients. Pre-treatment, ovarian patients had median CA 125 of 569.75 U/mL (range, 48.8-2034 U/mL) and breast patients median CA 15.3 of 264.05 U/mL (range, 29.1-2396 U/mL).

Using the patient's medical folder, the followed items were then evaluated: indication, dosage, combination with DXM and its dose. Results The prescriptions of 54 ambulatory patients were analyzed. They were all signed by hematologists. The notebook was duly completed and presented for each dispensation according to reglementation.The indication for lenalidomide treatment concerned the RMM for 39 patients (72%). Seven (13%) had a myelodysplastic syndrome with 5q deletion (5q-MS).

The acceptance rate was high (80%). Among all prescriptions, 47% were non conformant according to the hospital formulary, 21% had high posology, 8% were not completed with correct medical wording, 4.6% were non conformant according to the consensus conference and 3.5% had light posology. The main pharmaceutical interventions proposal were drug substitutions from the hospital formulary (46%), dosage adaptations (33.5%), treatment stop (8%), added drug (4.6%) and 2.5% concerned administration conditions changes. Discussion & Conclusion Main therapeutic class concerned by pharmaceutical interventions were cardiovascular drug (mainly antihypertensive drugs) and digestive system drugs (mainly proton pump inhibitors). Consolidation and analysis of interventions, with the help of the tools of SFPC, achieved a first assessment of this activity and enhanced pharmacists' role in the therapeutic management of patients.

Introduction Since the beginning of the year 2009, the consumption of the antibacterial agent linezolid has greatly (x 2) increased in the intensive care unit of our hospital. Given its high cost, linezolid is given according to local guidelines that include contraindication to other active agents (ie, glycopeptides). The major aim of our work was to review the clinical use of linezolid in this unit and to compare to the official labelling and to the local guidelines.Materials & Methods A retrospective study of linezolid prescriptions was made between june 1 st and august 31 th 2009. Patient characteristics, infection localisation, isolated pathogens, duration of therapy and drug-drug interactions according to the french drug agency were analyzed. Results Over the study period, thirty patients (13 women, 17 men; mean age: 67 years; range: 34-88) were treated by linezolid. Only 10 (33,4%) prescriptions were in accordance with the French official labelling in terms of indications (pneumonia, n = 5; skin and soft tissue infections, n = 5). The other indications included septic and febrile syndrome (26,7%), catheter infections (13,3%), intra-abdominal infections (6,7%), fever in neutropenic patients (10%), bone and joint infections (3,3%) , urinary infection (3,3%) , food and community toxi-infection (3,3%) . Regarding local recommendations, only 10 (33,3%) patients had received glycopeptides before linezolid. The main justification for using linezolid instead of glycopeptides was the alteration of renal function. Twenty three (76,7%) patients had documented gram-positive infection. Isolated pathogens primarily include Staphylococcus. Seven patients received linezolid as empiric treatment. The mean duration of linezolid treatment was 8 days (range: 1-24). Four patients (13,3%) were treated more than the recommended 14 days. Three potential drug-drug interactions without apparent clinical consequence were recorded: two associations with paroxetin (risk of serotonin syndrome) and one association with rifampicin (risk of decreased activity of linezolid). Co-administration with adrenergic agents was frequently encountered but was clinically judged irrelevant because patients are closely monitored (risk of enhancement of pressor response due to the monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity of linezolid). Discussion & Conclusion Appropriate use of linezolid was found in a minority of patients of intensive care unit. Adherence to both official labelling and local guidelines were poorly followed in our hospital. The use linezolid instead glycopeptides in patients with altered renal function is debatable and could necessitate the reevaluation of local guidelines.

The secondary objective is a more detailed study of neuroleptics by the rules of proper use. Materials & Methods This is a retrospective study in Unit Long-Term Care (ULTC) and a Geriatric Care and Rehabilitation Unit (CRU), performed during three months for patients with dementia. Data were collected from patient records in a table which includes Mini Mental State Examen (MMSE) and the indication of psychotropic concerned (informed or not in the medical record). Results Among the 209 patients ULTC and CRU, 106 patients with Alzheimer's or related parties are included in the study (82 in ULTC and 24 in CRU). The psychotic patients aged (8 in ULTC) for which antipsychotics have a former psychiatric indications are excluded. The average age is 83 years [66-101] with a majority of women (sex ratio 2.5). In ULTC, 17% of demented patients are receiving neuroleptics (93% of indications in the medical record), 52% other psychotropics and 25% co-prescription. In CRU, 42% of patients with a diagnosis of dementia are receiving antipsychotics (indicated in 73% of cases in the patient record), 65% other psychotics and 25% co-prescription of these.The difference in prescription of neuroleptics between two services can be explained by the fact that patients are coming in CRU advantage of behavioral problems by their long-term hospital and often neuroleptics upon arrival in CRU. These results are consistent with data from the literature that the prescription of antipsychotics is an average of 32% in this population (ranging from 17-42% according to studies). [1] Discussion & Conclusion The fact that 77.4% of demented patients in this study may not have limitation of neuroleptic, shows that the management of disruptive behavior disorders in this population is possible in most cases without neuroleptics, while preserving the use of other classes of psychotropic acting on mood disorders, insomnia and the anxiety and the non-pharmacological management (workshops, events, individual psychotherapy \u2026) as recommended by the HAS.No conflict of interest.

Hence, drugs can be used either to reduce the anti-HLA (human leukocyte antigen) antibodies before transplantation (desensitisation), or to manage transplant rejection. In our institution, the spendings of the last innovative therapeutic drugs in those indications, which are particularly expensive, noticeably increased last year.

            "text": "The therapeutic use of IVIG, R, B and E, alone or in association, for the management of RT, is made off label and has fallen into the practice although the published data have not reach a sufficient level of evidence: questions about efficient dose, duration of Tx, sequence of administration of drugs, adverse events and, mainly, survival of the transplanted patients, remained with partial answers. There is a huge need to promote well designed clinical trials and to include the patients whenever possible. This study reveals the need of a register and of an internal evaluation: a working group will be created in our institution in order to analyse further the practices and to protocolise the treatments. Cost-effectiveness of these therapeutics used in RT must be estimated. Introduction In addition to secondary prevention, the available therapies for the management of coronary artery disease consist of drugs and surgical techniques for myocardial revascularisation or interventional techniques (angioplasty). In France, drug-eluting stents (DES) are reimbursable over and above the cost of a hospital stay for the treatment of coronary insufficiency. This may be attributed to de novo lesions of native coronary arteries in patients with high risk of restenosis (lesions [15 mm, diameter of affected vessel \\3 mm or in diabetic patients); restenosis within bare-metal-stent (BMS), and chronic total coronary occlusion.In accordance with the provisions of the decree 2005 August 24th, the objective of this study is to assess the compliance of professional practice in the implantation of DES in the Grenoble University Hospital, France with the recommendations of the French Society of Cardiology and approval of the French medical devices assessment commission (CEPP) for reimbursement Materials & Methods This is a retrospective, descriptive study of coronary angioplasty procedures using DES implanted in September 2009. This assessment covers DES used at Grenoble University Hospital: the CYPHER\u00d2 sirolimus-eluting stent, the TAXUS\u00d2 Keywords gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, Protocols, refractory hodgkin lymphoma, relapse hodgkin lymphoma",

            "text": "Compliance of biliary stenting indications with the national guidelines in a French University Hospital Introduction In France, expensive medical devices, such as biliary metal stents, are reimbursed apart by national health insurance in addition to the price per pathology. This specific reimbursement imposes to follow the dedicated guidelines concerning the respective place of plastic prostheses and metal prostheses for biliary drainage. In this context, we evaluated the conformity of biliary stenting usage to the French Digestive Endoscopy Society (SFED) guideline (version of march 2000) in our hospital. Materials & Methods Design: prospective observational study led during 2 months. Setting: All consecutive patients who were referred to the endoscopy unit for the treatment of a biliary stenosis by an endoprosthesis, plastic or metal. Main outcome measure: percentage of indications in accordance with the SFED guideline for each type of medical device. Results 51 patients (19 females/32 males) were included in our study (mean age = 64 years [25; 89 years] ). Endoprostheses were inserted by one of the 8 different operators of the medical team. Operators filled indication on a case report form immediately following drainage (tick boxes). Nineteen patients (37%) had 1 metal biliary stent (coated or not coated) and 32 patients (63%) had 1 or 2 plastic prostheses. Metal stents were inserted because of malignant stenosis in 18 cases (95%) and for a benign stenosis in one case (5%). Whereas plastic prostheses were used for malignant stenosis in 19 cases (59%) and for benign stenosis in 11 patients (34%).All indications of metal stenting and 94% (30/32) of the indications of plastic stenting complied with the SFED guideline. Two patients had a plastic stent implantation for an indication not mentioned in the SFED guideline: one case of autoimmune cholangitis, a rare and recently described pathology, and one case of fistula, a rare circumstance.Discussion & Conclusion SFED guideline for biliary stenting is adequately applied in our hospital, despite its relative complexity and despite it has been published 10 years ago. The only 2 cases of non compliance with the guideline cannot be considered strictly as a misuse of the prostheses as they were related to rare or recently individualized pathologies. Scientific data have to be collected to slightly update the guideline. Materials & Methods Retrospective study on 54 patients (24 women and 30 men) with a median age of 46 receiving RAL as part of their ARV regimen. RAL Ctrough was determined using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method (limit of quantification of 5 ng/ml), at steady-state, at least one month after initiation of the regimen. Results Data were collected during 14 months. RAL dose was 400 mg bid (n = 53) and 800 mg bid (n = 1). During the follow-up, 2 patients were switched to 800 mg bid following the introduction of rifampicine. Patients received RAL in association with an optimized background therapy (OBT) as follows: 2NRTIs (A, reference group, n = 35), DRV/r\u00b1NRTIs (group B, n = 8), ETR\u00b1NRTIs (group C, n = 5), ATV/r\u00b1NRTIs (group D, n = 4) and TPV/r\u00b1NRTIs (group E, n = 2). Overall 100 RAL Ctrough were determined at 12 \u00b1 3 h after the last drug intake. Materials & Methods PBMC are isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Vacutainer TM CPT tubes. Raltegravir was extracted from plasma and PBMCs by solid phase extraction with OASIS MAX cartridges. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column (150mm 9 4.6mm, particle size 5 lm) with a quick stepwise gradient using 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile, at flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The analytical run time was 27 min. The simple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion-mode and single ion monitoring was used for drug quantification.Results The method was validated over a range of 50-5000 ng/mL in plasma and a range of 2.5-500 ng/mL in PBMCs lysate following FDA guidance for bioanalytical validation [1] . Quinoxaline was used as the internal standard. The SPE method was optimized to be selective and highly efficient. The lower limit of quantification was 2.5 ng/mL in plasma and PBMCs. The method was proven to be specific, precise, with mean inter-day CV% within 4. Introduction Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside widely used for the treatment of Congestive heart Failure. It has a very narrow therapeutic index (0.5-2.0 ng/ml) and displays large inter-and intra-patient pharmacokinetics variability. Several population methods (Paulson, Williams, Bauer, Hori and hyperbolic) have been developed for determining the digoxin dose. The aim of this study was to: (a) compare different methods for predicting digoxin level; (b) examine the effect of creatinine clearance (Clcr) and spironolacton on the disposition of digoxin.Materials & Methods 169 inpatients were identified for whom a measured concentration (MC) was available. Clcr was calculated using Jellif, Cockcroft, Hull, Mawer, and Salazar equations. Based on Clcr, each method was used to predict digoxin Concentration (PC), which was compared with MC. Degree of agreement between PC and MC was assessed by the mean of difference between the PC and MC (mean prediction error, ME) and the mean of absolute deviation between the PC and MC (mean absolute prediction error, MAE). The MC/daily dose (D) ratio was determined, and the effect of Clcr and spironolacton on MC/D was examined.Results The MC/D ratios of the patients with Clcr\\50 ml/min were significantly higher than those of the patients with Clcr [ 50 ml/min. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the MC/D ratios between the spironolacton-treated patients and the non-treated patients. The ME (measures of bias) and the MAE (measures of precision) for the methods ranged from -0.923 to 0.002 and 0.187 to 1.486 ng/ml respectively. Using Jelliffe Clcr, the hyperbolic method gave the smallest values of ME and MAE which were 0.002 and 0.228 ng/ml respectively. Discussion & Conclusion Hyperbolic equation was the most reliable of those evaluated and could be applied initially in Kuwaiti hospital. However, a large number of patients PC were well above the MC, therefore, individualization of digoxin dose based on MC is of great need.Keywords Digoxin, Pharmacokinetics, Prediction error",
