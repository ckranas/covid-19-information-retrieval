Progress has derived from information gained by new investigative methods such as the study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells, using immunohistochemical and molecular biology techniques, and widespread use of more precise fiberoptic bronchoscopy, especially in children [501] . Asthma is a disorder involving all bronchial structures and depends on a complex interaction between the respiratory tract and inflammatory cells, mediators and adhesion molecules. Release of mediators by metachromatic cells primes both activation and migration of inflammatory cells that cause various degrees of airway obstruction over relatively short periods of time, alterations in the mucociliary system and hyperreactivity of the bronchial smooth muscles. It follows that both inflammatory cells and their products play a key role in provoking an airway inflammation, capable of triggering severe symptoms in predisposed children when specific and aspecific stimuli are present. Pediatric asthma differs from adult asthma by its etiopathogenesis, treatment and prognosis. Studies reporting that the future prospects for treating asthmatic babies and children are optimistic [604] have not taken into account the severity of childhood symptoms [264] .

The confusion still existing in terminology (Chap. 5), the reluctance of doctors to use the term \"asthma\" and of parents to accept it, serve only to delay the diagnosis and treatment.

Asthma begins early in life [305] within the 1st year of life (Table 5 .5) with the developing immune system interacting with environmental influence [305] . Moreover, cases of pediatric asthma are increasing, as can be seen from epidemiological figures (Tables 5.10, 5.12), even though cases may be differently labeled, especially when symptoms are mild or moderate, and subsequently often underdiagnosed [446] . A large body of epidemiological evidence shows that allergic disorders in the pediatric population represent a current major therapeutic and preventive challenge for pediatricians. The surprising upsurge of severe asthma is occurring mainly in infants and children (Figs. 5.1, 5.3, 5.8) .

The key factor in the maintenance of airway immunological homeostasis is the immune system's ability to discriminate between intrinsically inoffensive antigens and/or those associated with pathogenic microorganisms, and the exclusion of the latter from the respiratory apparatus by the mucociliary system censoring mechanism, before they reach the underlying immune system.

It has been hypothesized that in newborn babies and healthy children BALT is absent, or at least reduced [54] and that it could be an inducible system that develops in the airways of infants and children, especially in concomitance with exposure to antigens and pathogenic agents [193] . Several studies on humans [40] have, however, confirmed the existence of BALT. Anatomically, it consists of a well-developed lymphatic system originating from the NALT (nasal-associated lymphoid tissue) at the airway entrance, and continues with follicles and submucosal lymphoid aggregations distributed along the whole respiratory tract up to the bronchoalveolar junction [40] (Fig. 11.1 ). The tissue is covered by a layer of flat epithelial cells, with few B lymphocytes, but essentially with T lymphocytes (CD3 + , CD4 + or CD8 + ), grouped in clumps of lymphoid and follicles distributed in a seemingly homogeneous manner over the entire epithelial layer in the main bronchi of the pulmonary lobes, principally at the bifurcation with the bronchioles [193] . The most common lymphocytes are intraepithelial (IEL), situated close to the basement membrane (BM), generally not affected by pathological changes typical of epithelial structures and, as with GALT, CD4 T cells dominate over CD8 T cells [193] . Even in the lymphocytes distributed under the BM of the epithelial layer, T subsets are more numerous than B cells [193] . Specific to IEL is CD103, widely expressed on T cells, of which up to 80% are CD45RO. As in the intestine CD7 expression is frequent; expression of CD25 is lower [520] . The TcR with g/d chains plays a prominent 727 Defense Mechanisms in the Airways cells of the lamina propria pass into the lumen across the BM and epithelium. In the upper airways, IgA antibodies predominate, with the capacity of neutralizing the RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) Rhinovirus and influenza virus and of agglutinating microorganisms, increasing the mucociliary clearance. In the trachea and bronchial tree secretory IgA (sIgA) are 10% of the total proteins; progressing to the alveoli, IgA decrease as low as 5%, while IgG increase up to 10%-15% [533] . Under normal conditions, the respiratory immune system is able to suppress immune responses triggered by allergens circumventing the barrier, in that a successful sIgA defensive system is ready [54] . As seen in Fig. 11 .2 [54] , sIgA are generated from locally produced polymeric IgA (pIgA), armed with J chain, which is transported by the pIgR (polymeric Ig receptor) to the lumen along with the SC (secretory component) [54] . Consequently, immune tolerance is established after the first contact with non-self agents with a two-phase mechanism related to genetic factors, but, mainly because of environmental factors capable of negatively affecting the immune system, a sensitization with the same mechanisms that we have seen play a part in food allergy (FA) can occur [54] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 166, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 449, "end": 454, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 831, "end": 835, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1219, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1465, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1588, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1758, "text": "[520]", "ref_id": "BIBREF541"}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2326, "text": "[533]", "ref_id": "BIBREF515"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2527, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2552, "end": 2556, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2752, "end": 2756, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3107, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 836, "end": 846, "text": "(Fig. 11.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2548, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "BALT (Bronchus-associated lymphoid issue) and Specific Defenses"}, {"text": "Nonspecific defenses are essentially represented by bronchial secretions that block and neutralize soluble toxic substances and by the activity of the mucociliary system that propels them upward. Bronchial secretion emitted by the submucosal glands and/or by the goblet cells, and enriched by transudation fluids or exudation of blood origin, is made up of glycoproteins originating in the mucosa, arranged in a type of fibrillar network and of a component, more precisely a fluid, containing anti-infective substances (Ig, lysozyme, lactoferrin) and C3 [648] . Additionally, the bronchial secretion performs a major role by hydrating the inhaled air and maintaining the ionic balance. The mucociliary system, already in place in the first days of life, is made up of ciliated cells, each possessing, on average, 200 cilia, 5-7 mm long and 0.25 mm wide. Each cilium is formed structurally of nine pairs of contractile longitudinal microtubules [648] , connected two by two by means of nexin links, and arranged in circles around a central pair. All the tubules converge toward the tip of the cilium, forming a hood connected to the ciliary membrane. Two dynein bridges catalyze hydrolysis of ATPase and transduce the energy into a mechanical force in the form of ciliary bending. The cilia act on the mucus blanket shed from the mucosal glands and especially that from goblet cells. At the moment of the active phase of the beat (15/s), the mucus is driven by the ciliary tip toward the oropharynx at increasing speed from the periphery toward the trachea, accelerating from 2-4 mm/min. At the alveolar level, the alveolocapillary membrane is covered with surfactant, produced by type II epithelial cells and nonciliated Clara cells, situated on the branching border between bronchial ducts and bronchioles, which synthesize the surfactant A-C proteins. This substance, having surface-active properties, changes the surface-charge properties, making foreign particles less viscid and therefore more easily cleared [648] ; in addition, it promotes the intervention of the phagocytes.

Antigens circumventing this barrier meet mucosal IgG antibodies. The resulting immune complexes activate complement, and inflammatory mediators most likely formed locally. However, the adverse inflammatory development is usually inhibited by serum IgA and by locally produced polymeric and monomeric IgA. Antigens may be returned in a noninflammatory way to the vasal lumen by pIgRmediated transport mechanisms.

Most children with persistent asthma (70%), frequent asthma (69%), and infrequent asthma (69%) had severe asthma into adult life and reduced PFTs [264] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 488, "text": "[554]", "ref_id": "BIBREF556"}, {"start": 659, "end": 664, "text": "[218]", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 908, "end": 913, "text": "[501]", "ref_id": "BIBREF503"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1212, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Alterations of the Defense Mechanisms"}, {"text": "Stimulating findings have opened up an unexpected facet of asthma pathogenesis.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF), also implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammation in asthma, is degraded and inactivated by PAF acetylhydrolase: its deficiency is found more frequently in children with atopic asthma [275] . Polymorphism in the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene might be associated with the pathogenesis of atopic asthma and the regulation of total serum IgE levels in children aged <3. The related deficiency leads to a complete defect in class-switching, resulting in a hyper-IgM phenotype and lack of IgG, IgA, and IgE. An area requiring further study is on the role of CC16 (Clara cells), which is secreted in the airway epithelium and plays a key role in inhibiting airway inflammation, but CC16 levels are reduced in patients with current asthma due to increased levels of its A38G allele [325] . This allele was associated with increased BHR at age 1 month and increased risk of asthma at age 6 [324] .

IgE levels were higher when the infants were 6 months of age [305] .Within the same family group, some members can have BHR and elevated IgE, others only high levels of IgE [229] . As mentioned in Chap. 5, the risk factor is significant in relation to positive FH (FH+): the prevalence of asthma has increased from four-to tenfold compared to subjects with negative FH [174] ; if it is specifically related to asthma, children have an increased risk of becoming asthmatic within the 2nd year of life [746] , with a BHR-atopy association correlated to age and to FH [122] .

However, none of these factors has been formally identified as the cause of airway inflammation [499] .

Agreement on a positive correspondence between BHR and atopy is not unanimous [574] : this was confirmed in two longitudinal studies [4, 107] .

The correlation is absent in other children [108] and in adults followed up from age 7 [289] ; infants at risk aged 6.5 months have reacted to the histamine test with BHR independently of wheezing [106] .

No doubts remain regarding the pathogenic role of airway inflammation (Fig. 11 .3) [194] , either in severe, prolonged attacks of asthma or in children with chronic disease. Since 1906 [173] , anatomopathological studies of patients who died after an asthmatic attack have highlighted the presence of numerous changes in the bronchial mucosa [255, 516, 600] (Figs. 11.4, 11.5): \u2211 Clear inflammatory response with subepithelial infiltration of inflammatory cells, eosinophils and activated lymphocytes, with class II antigens, mast cells and macrophages more numerous than in controls. \u2211 Desquamation of the bronchial epithelium with shedding of epithelial cells from basal cells and swollen ciliated cells. \u2211 Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle. \u2211 Edema of the mucosa and the submucosa as a consequence of increased permeability of the microvasculature and plasma leakage. 732 CHAPTER 11 Asthma ceased subjects suffering from asthma during life are found to have relatively normal bronchi [287] , the damage found in specimens from lung biopsies in children with asthma in remission were similar to pathological specimens of others of the same age who died from status asthmaticus and even of patients who died of causes unrelated to asthma [255] . Figures 11.6 and 11.7 [50] show the differences between the bronchial state of a healthy subject and that of an asthmatic one during the pollen season. It should be emphasized that consistent damage of a chronic airway inflammatory process caused by more than one cell type is observed in subjects with newly diagnosed asthma, having asthma for <1 year (Fig. 11 .8) [327] , even after 2-3 months of asthma duration, showing a greatly decreased number of ciliated cells in the airway epithelium as compared with those in the control subjects [328] . If anatomopathologists underline the inflammatory aspects, clinicians favor that of spontaneously reversible bronchoconstriction, or reversible following specific treatment, whereas physiologists consider the increased BHR as the dominant factor. Even if the concepts of reversibility and of hyperactivity have long attracted a great deal of attention, the idea that asthma should be regarded as a pulmonary inflammation has only recently been given its due attention. Based on recent research, BHR is related to the degree of airway inflammation: as such, both tissue damage and BHR can find a unifying pathogenetic mechanism in the interaction of the different mediators discharged by different cells [255] . It does not, however, seem to be caused by the basic inflammation, since it does not regress with corticosteroid (CS) therapy [94] .

If adults with mild forms of asthma show a severe pathological picture, and delate asthmatic reactions (LAR), whose characteristics are summarized in Fig. 1.9 . The immediate phase is summed up in IgE production in response to allergenic stimulus ( Fig. 1.40 ). On the next encounter, in the atopic child, the interaction between allergens and sIgE linked to receptors on effector cell surface initiates a complex chain of biochemical events leading to cellular activation, culminating in mediator release within a few minutes of the allergenic stimulation, and, at the same time, to the appearance of clinical manifestations [207] ( Fig. 11.11 ). Parallel with this, in the airways, 3-12 h after allergenic exposure, recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils and PBMCs, which constitute the primary histopathological infiltrate in status asthmaticus, starts the delayed reaction ultimately resolving in chronicization. A close relationship between basophil number and histamine serum level, and between eosinophil number and MBP concentration [283] is evident. Eosinophil number, 30 min at most after antigen challenge, reaches its peak after 4-6 h and, in individuals without LAR, after 24 h [538] , so it is assumed that their transition occurs from the mucosa to the secretions.

This role is a prerogative of specific Th2 lymphocytes, ILs, and factors they secrete, that is LTB 4 , PAF, IL 3 -IL 6 and the chemotactic factor of CD8 T cells [258] . On the other hand, a relative absence of IL 10 characterizes the airways of asthmatic fector cells such as basophils, neutrophils, and, above all, eosinophils, as is demonstrated by cationic protein concentrations [442] , ECA (eosinophil chemotactic activity) and NCA (neutrophil chemotactic activity) [240] during a BPT (bronchial provocation test) with aller-Pathogenesis sufferers, potentially increasing the severity of allergic inflammation [384] . The role of platelets still remains to be elucidated. On the basis of the latest information available, this reaction appears to be suited for further studies of the physiopathology of asthma and to assess the therapeutic potential of new drugs [162] . Both in asthmatic adults [435] and in children [255] , inflammation is usually present. Moreover, a pediatric study has revealed an intimate correlation between activation of both eosinophils and mast cells and BHR [187] . A single pathogenic mechanism does not exist at the basis of the inflammation and consequential BHR; rather, it is likely that the orchestrated action of mediators, their products and cells attracted in this process can play a salient role in provoking BHR [340] . From a histopathological point of view, interesting progress has been made possible by the study of BALF cells via fiberoptic bronchoscopy, which can be performed even in nurslings, using models as small as 1.8-2.3 mm in diameter [737] , and which can also be achieved, in severe cases, using a noninvasive method such as a neonatal catheter [182] . Using these techniques, immune cytochemical research has demonstrated that, in asthmatic children, neither the discriminatory presence of cell types nor their quantitative increase as compared to nonasthmatic atopic controls (Tables 1.40, 1.41) have been found. Studies of BALF cells and lung biopsies have revealed that a great number of CD4 + [15, 236] are activated by the expression of CD25 and of class II HLA molecules [691] . In atopic asthma sufferers, these T cells have a Th2 phenotype, which is notably relevant in the pathogenesis of allergic disease, especially of the airways, so a great deal of asthma is associated with the activation in the bronchi of IL 3 -IL 6 and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), a pattern compatible with Th2 activation [524] [525] [526] . IL 13 hyperproduction [321] could also bias the differentiation of T cells toward a Th2 phenotype through its ability to modulate IL 12 production from APCs. Whether as a result of exaggerated Th2 cytokine production or as a primary defect, lack of IL 12 can clearly influence immune responses toward a skewed Th2 response [676] . Furthermore, alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelium, eosinophils and mast cells express these and other ILs, whose secretions lead to the pathological findings observed in asthma [15, 236, 691] . Some CXCL and CCL chemokines (Tables 1.54-1.57) act on both basophils and eosinophils; the former could represent the key mediators of immune inflammation. In immune inflammation, it is not easy to draw a balance of the importance of the different cell types or of the mediators involved. It seems more evident that they act together, each armed either with its own weapons or those shared with others, releasing a complex cascade of harmful events [73] . Of no minor importance are the notable alterations experienced by the postcapillary microvasculature: it is known that, in addition to the explicit damaging action carried out by powerful mediators, even vagal nerve stimulation, through neuropeptide release, secreted by neuroendocrine tissues of the airways, including substance the mucociliary clearance must cross the mucosal layer and penetrate via the junctions to encounter immunocompetent cells [533] . DCs send the start signal to T cells during the sensitization phase and can also act as synergistic agents of their activation process in the airway walls during IAR. They are equipped with FceRI-a that can facilitate allergen uptake and internalization, enhancing their potential role in the induction and amplification of chronic airway inflammation [660] .

The predominant clones of allergen-specific T lymphocytes of atopic asthmatics, which are Th2-like, are able to produce elevated levels of IL 4 [535] . Recently, GATA-3 overexpression was found to be implicated in Th2 development in human T cells and IL 5 promoter activity in CD4 + T cells of asthmatic patients was enhanced by GATA-3 [286] . In asthmatic patients, more cells from BALF contain mRNA for IL 3 -IL 5 and GM-CSF (whose genes are associated in a gene cluster of chromosome 5), and reduced IFN-g levels compared to controls [530] .

In this context, the presence of mast cells and basophils assumes great relevance, given that their precursors are able to produce IL 4 for Fce receptor cross-linking. IL 4 synthesis modulates that of IgE antibodies, by acting directly on B lymphocytes, or by activating Th2-like CD4 + cells. The latter produce on the one hand IL 4 (and therefore IgE) and on the other IL 5 , finally closing the inflammatory cycle [535] . Since 24 h after BPT with allergens the majority of ILs originate from T cells [531] , we may conclude that expanding allergen-specific Th2 lymphocytes directly orchestrates both the development of bronchial inflammation by producing specific IL and the continuous synthesis of IgE, able to elicit decisive influxes on inflammatory cells [525] .

The marker CD25 (receptor of IL 2 , IL 2 R) [15, 119] and of HLA-DR and CD49a/CD29 (VLA-1) in greater numbers than in normal controls denotes that such activated cells are able to contribute to the pathogenesis [119] . Soluble IL 2 R (sIL 2 R) is a marker of their activation, with particularly elevated levels in asthmatic children compared to healthy controls and adults [408] . Even in the pediatric age group, high percentages of both CD4 and CD8 peripheral blood T cells express activation markers: thus T-cell activation as compared to controls is found [153, 207, 252, 590] , with significantly higher differences regarding the increase in absolute numbers of CD4/ CD25 + , CD4/HLA-DR + and CD8/CD25 + [207] , of T-cell specific markers CD23 and CD25 [252] , HLA-DR antigen [590] and PEF-correlated CD25 [153] . Associations between eosinophil activation, CD4 + cell numbers, and a high correlation between CD4-Th2 and eosinophils and severity of asthma [691] , are totally confirmed by the evidence in children of CD4-Th2 and CD8 displaying Fig. 11 .14. HLA-DR (immunoperoxidase demonstration) in the bronchial epithelium of normal (left) and asthmatic subjects (right) the bundles of smooth muscle, and in patients with asthma this number was correlated with the hallmark of asthma, BHR [55] . In asthmatics there is no instability of mast cell membrane, which could facilitate degranulation, an event that can be mediated not only by encountering sIgE, but also by sIgG (specific) and anaphylotoxins. Similarly, there is no functional heterogeneity, since mast cells of the human airways belong mainly to the T type, even if both phenotypes can coexist in the same site with different levels (Table 1. 27) . Mast cells participate in the immediate phase of allergic reactions: they are found in the BALF of atopic asthmatics taken 15 min after allergen challenge in the degranulation stage [258] , often in proximity to the small vessels and nerve endings and intimately correlated with smooth muscles, with spontaneous release of histamine and eicosanoids [73] . Once the degranulation has started, it is possible that allergen encounter with superficial mast cells provokes an initial mediator release that increases tissue permeability, with consequent enlargement of the intraepithelial tight junction network, thus allowing a greater number of allergens to reach the layers below, where a strong group of mast cells are to be found [283] . The array of primary and secondary mediators further increase the permeability of the epithelial barrier, permitting the entrance of plasma proteins and blood platelets [283] . This is how the true asthma allergy explosion is set off. Consequently histamine, PG, thromboxanes (type A 2 ), LTs (leukotrienes), PAF, bradykinins (BKs), granule derivatives and chemotactic factors are crucial for developing an inflammatory stage of immediate reaction [287] . As well as inducing adhesion, diapedesis, directional migration and activation of eosinophils and neutrophils, they also recruit other cells that are fundamental for the establishment and self-maintenance of inflammation, such as monocyte-macrophages, blood platelets, more eosinophils, and neutrophils to the injured site [283] . Mediators participating in the triggering of asthma affect the infiltration of leukocytes, probably aided by afferent vagal stimulations, affecting the bronchospasm as well as mucosal gland secretions, which are unrelated to symptom severity [283] . ILs, whose secretion is associated with histamine release and mast cell proliferation (probably associated with IL 3 and IL 4 generation), are in turn able to amplify the vasoactive phase of immune inflammation [73] . Mast cells, as well as sharing with basophils the CD154 production with a direct effect on IgE synthesis, express mRNA for IL 4 and for IL 5 , whose release, together with IL 3 and IL 6 , is triggered by an IgE-mediated mechanism [287] . Mast cells, however, appear to be the only cells producing IL 4 in the airways of asthmatics: this could indicate their possible intervention in LARs, which, however, has not been fully confirmed. On the other hand, the mediators seem to be correlated to IARs, as demonstrated by the increase in histamine levels in circulation and the increase in histamine and tryptase in BALF of atopic subjects a few minutes after allergen CD25 and HLA-DR positively correlated with disease severity (p=0.03) and with a significant increase in total eosinophilia (p=0.01) as compared with the controls [207] . Remarkably, the proportion of CD4 T cells expressing the memory cell marker CD45RO was significantly elevated in both atopic and nonatopic asthmatics compared with controls, whereas the naive marker CD45RA was expressed by a high proportion of CD8 T cells only in the nonatopic asthmatics compared with controls. Moreover, high rates of these CD4 and CD8 T cells express mRNA encoding IL 5 , but only CD4 expressed mRNA encoding IL 4 in asthmatic children compared with the controls [208] . The relationship between cells displaying IL 5 and activated eosinophils in bronchial biopsies in asthmatics [236, 340] (Fig. 11 .10) indicates that high levels of IL 5 distinguish between severe asthma [119] and moderate asthma, where they cannot be measured [153] , considering that CSs reduce their transcription, together with several others, being capable of inhibiting in atopic asthmatics T-cell activation markers in BALF and in peripheral sites [723] and DC as well [412] . For these reasons, T lymphocytes, with all the cells and factors they stimulate, above all eosinophils, can be considered as the key cells that bring into effect, sustain and perpetuate the immune inflammation, the catalyst element that induces BHR in relation with endogenous and exogenous factors, and triggers the series of events that lead almost inexorably to asthma [287] . This is especially evident when the impossibility of establishing a state of tolerance through Th1 T cells results in the sensitization to environmental allergens [262] , guided by the Th2 in the critical phase of developing the immune system in infants.

Moreover, as a result of the change in volume and composition of the secretions of the airways that follows, the mucociliary clearance is compromised (by the parallel effects of LTC 4 ). In particular, MBP has a cytotoxic effect on airway epithelium, up to the point of dys-epithelialization [217] . The protein in concentrations of 100 mg/ml provokes in vitro ciliostasis and cell exfoliation within 12-48 h, and, if the dose is increased fivefold, the denudation of the superficial epithelium and of the nerve endings appears, whereas with a level of 700 mg/ml, within 30 min, the ciliary beat frequency is inhibited by 20% and the zone of activity reduced by 40% (Fig. 11 .17) [217] . Experimental research has proven that EPO, in the presence of H 2 O 2 and halide, tangibly damages the tracheal epithelium [51] , while MBP stimulates the tracheal smooth muscles into producing PGE 2 and in secreting chlorides [217] ; additionally it increases its reactivity to acetylcholine and to histamine, if the epithelium above is normal. If this is not the case, its action is negated [57] . MBP can neutralize the heparin anticoagulant activity [217] . Other highly toxic products derived from the granules play a significant role in determining the epithelial lesions during inflammation, such as ECP, ten times more cytotoxic than MBP, EDN (eosinophil-derived neurotoxin), free O 2 radicals, eosinophil-activating factor (EAF) and eosinophil cytotoxicity enhancing factor (ECEF), two factors empowering the eosinophils and their cytotoxicity [679] . An aggravating role is played by complement components, first C5a, which, like PAF, stimulates ECP and EPO release and the production de novo of toxic O 2 radicals. Given that components and deposits of the complement components are present in the bronchial secretions and in airway mucosa, it is likely that C5a not only stimulates eosinophils, but also contributes to their activation in tissues close to the inflammatory foci [749] . inflammatory sites in vivo [561] . Let us remember that on a cutaneous level the CD62E selectin facilitates eosinophil and/or neutrophil adhesion, allowing them to migrate through epithelial layers, suggesting that endothelial activation, in the late stage, and due to ILs, covers a primary role in the directional migration of inflammatory cells [258] (Fig. 11 .20).

In this regard, data is controversial in atopic children [240, 442, 627, 639, 756] , making asthma monitoring problematic given that the rates decrease with treatment [756] , but not when asthma is stable [756] , or in asymptomatic children [240] .

Like eotaxin-1 and -2, RANTES and MIP-1a induce eosinophil chemotaxis during transendothelial transmigration [563] . The adhesion of only eosinophils and basophils to small-vessel endothelium is mediated by the interaction of CD106/CD49d/29, which therefore plays a primary role by recruiting cells to be sent toward membrane of the eosinophils interacts with CD62E; thereafter eosinophils are linked via b1 and b2 integrins to endothelial cell membrane and activated under the influence of IL 3 , IL 5 and GM-CSF produced by lymphocytes and mast cells [561] .

IL 5 is also able to prolong their survival for 24-48 h, with a lesser role compared to other ILs, and to activate them in successive phases, along with elaboration of lipid mediators and PAF activation [460] .

Epithelial BM collagen deposition and thickening is already apparent in asthmatic children before the age of 3 years, compared to symptom-free children [501] . Normally, healthy epithelium is in contact with cylindrical cells, contact which is characterized by tight junctions in such a way that the adjacent cells oppose an impermeable barrier to the intercellular passage of macromolecules, inhaled pollutants, infectious agents, and other particulate matter. The mucosa generally absorbs small molecules as well as proteins by paracellular means, but when exposed to foreign agents it responds with plasma protein leakage. However, persistent allergic airway inflammation in asthma is accompanied by airway remodeling changes, including hyperplasia of airway mucus glands, myofibroblasts, smooth muscle and vasculature, and the thickening of the airway wall with subepithelial fibrosis [261] . The prospect of developing irreversible airway obstruction should prompt early treatment decisions [189] . IL 11 induces an airway remodeling response in the asthmatic airways characterized by tissue fibrosis, deposition of types I and III collagen, and myocyte and myofibroblast hyperplasia [752] . It follows therefore that the remodeling process can also involve other cells such as leukocytes and ECM [491] . devoid of cilia [51] .

Epithelial damage could depend not only on the cytotoxic effects of eosinophil-derived basic proteins and oxidants, but also on neutrophil intervention which, in vitro [413] and in vivo [677] , have the ability of producing similar effects, as well as the exfoliation and detachment of the epithelium from the BM [413, 677] . In addition, epithelial injury is mediated by exogenous factors such as air pollutants, viruses and allergens as well as by endogenous factors including the release of proteolytic enzymes from mast cells [260] . It has been suggested that such changes could also originate from an abnormal response of epithelial cells, stimulated by leukocytes [413] . Moreover, IL 13 hyperproduction promotes subepithelial fibrosis and thickening of smooth muscle layer [321] .

The speed and rapidity with which restitution to a former state begins and continues is surprising. Vascular endothelial cells proliferate, forming granulation tissue, the newly formed vessels have open junctions that permit the release of proteins and erythrocytes, the microvasculature also responds by recruiting neutrophils [490] . It is likely that bronchial epithelial cells originally involved with the lesion are able to initiate these reparatory activities, producing chemotactic factors for intact epithelial cells and for PMNs [600] . Facilitated by an adequate hydraulic pressure, the plasma proteins enter the lumen of the tight junctions of the intact cylindrical cells that circumscribe the denuded area [491] . These cells respond immediately, leading to a supposed intervention of specific factors in vivo: substitute secretory cells, both ciliated and basal cells, undifferentiate, become flattened and migrate beyond the membrane -a process which takes place rapidly in the 1st min following denudation (about 3 mm/min) [490] . A fibrin and fibronectin gel, also rich in neutrophils, contributes in covering up the stripped areas where it is continually enriched with plasma until the epithelium has been regenerated with the tight junctions [491] (Fig. 11 .32).

ECM allows some mobility to 754 CHAPTER 11 Asthma ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Extracellular Matrix"}, {"text": "The BM of surface epithelium is composed of two layers: the basal lamina (referred to as the true BM) and the lamina reticularis. The basal lamina is of normal thickness in asthma. However, thickening of the lamina reticularis is a characteristic feature of the asthmatic bronchus, occurring early in the disease process [681] . Studies of postmortem reports initially led to the conclusion that in asthmatics the BM becomes thicker as a result of edematous collagen deposits, with fibrils of a plexiform appearance. Electron microscopy (EM) and immunohistochemical investigations subsequently made it clear that BM is normal. Airway thickening be-regulate airway and vascular diameter and acts as an essential stabilizer for preventing airway collapse during expiration. In the respiratory and transitional zones, the ECM is more dynamic to accommodate the constant fluctuations in alveolar volume that accompany inspiration and expiration. Macromolecules constituting ECM are secreted locally and consist of fibrous proteins (fibronectin and laminin) embedded in a hydrated polysaccharide gel containing several glycosaminoglycans including hyaluronic acid. ECM is a dynamic structure, and an equilibrium between ECM synthesis and degradation components is required to maintain its homeostasis [681] . Fig. 11 .32. Plasma exuded through barriers in the airway microvasculature and mucosa. Plasma leakage from subepithelial microcirculation multiplies its solutes and expands in volume. It surrounds the basolateral aspects of the epithelial cells; by increasing the hydrostatic pressure the exudate may compress the sides of these cells. At a certain pressure, the tight junctions at the apical pole of epithelial cells would separate due to the increased pressure load. Plasma leakage through the ensuing holes in the venular wall. Tight junctions are reestablished as soon as the interstitial pressure returns to normal levels neath the BM occurs with collagen deposition and other ECM proteins, including fibronectin and tenascin in the connective tissue layer surrounding the blood vessels, and alveolar interstitium [261] . The degree of collagen deposition into the BM lamina reticularis in children who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy is such that airway fibrosis evolves in parallel with eosinophilic inflammation before a clear clinical diagnosis of bronchial asthma could be made [501] . Instead, reticular BM thickness or inflammatory cell number determined in ultrathin sections of endobronchial biopsies were not present in 53 infants aged 3.4-26 months with severe wheeze and/or cough, with reversible airflow obstruction [548] . In healthy subjects, BM, independent of asthma etiology, gravity and duration, shows a pseudothickening [51] caused by a deposit of collagen III, V and I (to a lesser extent) and of fibronectin in the lamina reticularis situated below the BM [534] , confirming that at the basis of this process, is the activation of contractile myofibroblasts in the subepithelial site, rather than an epithelial dysfunction [53] .

Nevertheless, in children a noticeable variation in clinical symptoms is found, which is why, in practice, the usefulness of measuring BHR is somewhat reduced. Furthermore, the uncertainty of a certain correlation of this parameter with the clinical state and its diversity over time renders BHR not very reliable as a diagnostic test for selecting an adequate treatment and for determining a prognosis [108] .

These systems are usually in balance: the cholinergic system promotes bronchoconstriction; the adrenergic system, in contrast, modulates bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. At the present time, the ANS airway innervation is considered to be far more complex. Given that sympathetic fibers do not directly innervate smooth muscles, in addition to the usual adrenergic and cholinergic fibers, fibers belonging to a third system called NANC (nonadrenergic and noncholinergic) have been reported, which include both e-NANC (excitatory noncholinergic/nonparasympathomimetic structures) and i-NANC (nonadrenergic/nonsympathomimetic inhibitory structures) [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 202, "end": 207, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": "BIBREF310"}, {"start": 329, "end": 334, "text": "[238]", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1399, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of Bronchial Hyperreactivity"}, {"text": "The fibers of cholinergic nerves travel along the tenth pair with synapse in the airway parasympathetic ganglia, spreading to smooth muscles and submucosal glands.

Cholinergic innervation of upper airways is most dense, thinning out in the periphery. Animal studies have shown that stimulation produces little effect in the lower airways [21] . Given that in humans the muscarinic (M) receptors are equal to parasympathomimetic, which are diffused even in the lower airways, investigations to ascertain whether in asthma there was an increase in their activity [719] were made. This view point is supported by a study showing that many stimuli having a bronchospastic action, such as S dioxide (SO 2 ), histamine, PG and BK, also affect afferent receptors, therefore inducing reflex bronchoconstriction inhibited by anticholinergics. There could also be an increase in neurotransmitter activity in cholinergic ganglia, either as a result of other neurotransmitter or mediator release, or because postganglion nerve terminals carry out an action favoring acetylcholine release [18] . Given that adrenergic nerves are able to inhibit this production via receptors b or a 2 , it is likely that a deficiency in adrenergic responses is reflected in cholinergic tone increase by an increase in muscarinic receptors or others related to them.

Also G proteins have been cloned for these receptors, a 1 to Gaq, a 2 to Gai and b to Gas (which, together with G i2 form the four subfamilies of the a subunit) [318] . Under normal conditions, the sympathetic tone (specifically the b receptors), represents the main balance unit by antagonizing the vagal tone and diminishing vagus-induced bronchoconstriction. The b-receptor antagonists have no effect on the cholinergic tone of a healthy subject; on the contrary, they cause bronchospasm in asthmatics with a greater efficacy the more the vagal tone is raised, a stimulation produces mucus secretion and, above all, mast cell mediators are discharged. b2 receptors are widely distributed over the bronchial area: they can be found on smooth muscule fibers and in epithelial and glandular cells. In asthmatics, due to a poor reactivity of the adrenergic system, it is likely that the main role in regulating the bronchomotor tone is played by circulating catecholamines. Epinephrine inhibits the bronchoconstriction action of histamine, acting as a true circulating hormone, and could play a protective role with regard to bronchoconstriction agents. In asthmatics and other atopic subjects, a deficit of b-adrenergic receptors and a parallel a-receptor hyperresponsiveness, which could be expressed into blocking the balance of vagal action, has been demonstrated. A supposed genetic deficit of b-receptors in asthma has remained an enigma since the beginning [636] , even if this anomaly can be hypothesized in a few patients [502] . The postulated interconversion between b and a receptors has been negated by studies with monoclonal antibodies on receptor structures [90] . Generally, potential deficits of the adrenergic system can be summarized as follows: \u2211 An increase in a receptors in the airways \u2211 A decrease in a-receptor antagonists \u2211 A quantitative and/or qualitative decrease in b receptors \u2211 Anomalies in receptor splitting, with a, M 1 and M 3 increase causing a reduction in the number of b and M 2 receptors in all organs and can be produced by cells other than CNS cells [21] .

In this manner, stimulation of epithelial nerve fibers can provoke bronchoconstriction and extravasation of plasma proteins with an axon reflex by SP release near airway smooth muscles and postcapillary bronchial veins [333] . In particular, SP bronchoconstriction activity, at least in vitro, is fulfilled antidromically when reflex cholinergic bronchoconstriction is present, as a result of exposed afferent nerve endings situated under desquamated epithelium, especially those of C-fibers [426] . As well as affecting the muscle, SP also affects bronchial mucus production, stimulating both the submucosal glands to an increased secretion, as well as the myofibrils surrounding glandular ducts to increase their secretion. Furthermore, SP increases mucociliary clearance in the airways [362] . Other evidence suggests that SP induces aspecific degranulation of cutaneous and peritoneal mast cells, but not those of the airways, and causes T-lymphocyte proliferation, neutrophil and alveolar macrophage phagocytosis [90] , and enhances neutrophil [88] and eosinophil chemotaxis [90] . Thus, we understand how BHR to SP in asthmatic children is correlated with asthma severity [429] . NKA-induced bronchoconstriction, which in the airways travels in the same fibers containing SP, is dosedependent [126] and stronger than that provoked by SP, which, in turn, is more powerful as a vasodilator and vasopermeabilizer. Therefore, in the present state of our knowledge, NKA and SP exercise a bronchoconstriction 4 and NKA, an effect not inhibited by adrenergic or cholinergic receptor activation nor by cyclooxygenase blocking activity [90] . Also characteristic of VIP is an abundant distribution in both upper airways and nasal mucosa, but not in bronchioles, which is why its bronchodilator action is greater in regulating the caliber of large airways, and is practically wholly ineffective in small airways. In consequence, the therapeutic effect in the asthmatic patient is deceptive, either because specific VIP receptors are scarce in this location, as has been said, or because of the effect of peptidases (for example tryptase) capable of degrading VIP which are released by inflammatory cells present in asthmatic airways [333] . It is characteristic that tryptase degrades VIP with bronchodilator effect, but not so SP, thus promoting bronchial reactivity, causing in prospective BHR and bronchospasm [96] . The prevalent conclusion is therefore that i-NANC exercises a modulator activity of cholinergic effect rather than a direct bronchodilator action [96] . Potential alterations of the i-NANC system foresee the following mechanisms: \u2211 Shortage of nonadrenergic neurons with inhibitor activity \u2211 Increased degradation of VIP/PHM \u2211 Reversible blockage of nerve ganglia or nerve endings with nonadrenergic inhibitor activity \u2211 Numerical reduction of VIP/PHM receptors [96] What, then, is the role of neuropeptides? In a healthy individual at rest, the adrenergic, cholinergic and NANC effects are balanced for a perfect bronchopulmonary homeostasis and there is a balance between the bronchodilator mechanisms (b-adrenergic system + VIP/ PHM) and bronchoconstrictors (a-adrenergic/cholinergic + SP/NK/CGRP) [90] . As shown in Table 11 .7, NANC displays opposing functions: broncho-and vasoconstriction, and broncho-and vasodilation. Confronting the neuropeptide multiform actions, the host generates numerous defense mechanisms. If, on the one hand, VIP reduction/inactivation could contribute to asthma pathogenesis, on the other, the neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP, CD10) is capable of inactivating neuropeptides in bronchial epithelial cells. The contrasting effects of NKA and SP on the one hand and PHM and VIP on the other have already been mentioned. There could be present anomalies of the intrinsic microganglia, the efferent parasympathetic fibers containing VIP, and the VIP receptor system [18] . On the other hand, the effects of bronchoconstriction NANC hyperactivity could, in some patients, play a negative role, such as a hypersensitivity of sensitive nerves and of axon reflexes, amplifying inflammatory responses by releasing factors stimulating such sensitive endings, or an increased smooth muscle sensitivity to bronchoconstriction tachykinins [426] . Its sensitivity to O 3 or to action (e-NANC) that can clash with i-NANC, which has a bronchodilator effect, as well as with EDRF, with an effect on bronchial smooth muscle equal to NO [10] . Epithelial denudation can involve the loss of these factors, thereby increasing reflex bronchoconstriction -an effect also mediated by tachykinins contained in microganglia [90] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 125, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1130, "text": "[333]", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1403, "text": "[426]", "ref_id": "BIBREF429"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1700, "text": "[362]", "ref_id": "BIBREF385"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1928, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1959, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1990, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2089, "text": "[429]", "ref_id": "BIBREF432"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2210, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2543, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 3135, "end": 3140, "text": "[333]", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 3315, "end": 3319, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 3468, "end": 3472, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 3784, "end": 3788, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 4123, "end": 4127, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 4820, "end": 4824, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 5184, "end": 5189, "text": "[426]", "ref_id": "BIBREF429"}, {"start": 5376, "end": 5380, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 5556, "end": 5560, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 117, "text": "Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 4142, "end": 4150, "text": "Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "NANC and Neuropeptides"}, {"text": "CPS stimulates SP release from sensory terminals and, to the same degree as SP, provokes bronchoconstriction and an increase in vascular permeability.

The final result therefore is that in the asthmatic, unlike in a healthy individual, the balance tends toward bronchoconstriction effects [90] . Neuropeptide action can be linked to that of ILs, with a point of unification represented by the joint action of autacoids, substances physiologically active such as histamine, serotonin, PG, etc. Thus, on the one hand ILs contribute to asymptomatic epithelial damage, while, on the other, neurotransmitters contribute to bronchoconstriction ( Fig. 11 .34) [418] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 180, "text": "[315,", "ref_id": "BIBREF318"}, {"start": 181, "end": 185, "text": "337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF340"}, {"start": 437, "end": 442, "text": "[426]", "ref_id": "BIBREF429"}, {"start": 583, "end": 587, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 947, "end": 952, "text": "[418]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 934, "end": 941, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Bronchodilators (i-NANC System)"}, {"text": "Another factor can be represented by dysfunctions in the stimuli-response relationship.

However, there is an interesting paradox worth mentioning: b-adrenergic receptors are quantitatively normal, but cell response to b-adrenergic stimulation is reduced, as can be noted in atopic patients who have not received treatment. Further, administering b-adrenergic drugs causes a rapid receptor desensitization [318] : what conclusion can finally be deduced from this? b-adrenergic receptors are made up of peptides from the cellular membrane which bind either to epinephrine or to norepinephrine. The link to one of these hormones activates Gs -a G-protein -which in turn stimulates adenylyl cyclase to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), while the Gi inhibit this process. A chain of Gs is deactivated by pertussis toxin. This activity was studied in the murine model in which it reproduces both the immunological anomalies of atopy and hyperreactivity in diverse organs [516] .

Among those last named, superoxide anion has a particularly harmful effect on the airways with its highly destructive radicals [726] . The epithelial damage exposes intraepithelial mast cells, afferent nerve endings and, in particular, irritating vagal receptors to the combined action of various stimuli. These lie in the upper and lower tract mucosa immediately below the epithelial tight junctions [722] , which, though physiologically impermeable, allow a greater absorption of allergenic and irritating substances to take place if altered. In addition, the mucociliary clearance reduces its filtering action of inflammatory substances and airway secretions. \u2211 Experimental studies have highlighted the role played by epithelial denudation, which could lead to NEP loss, usually found not only on smooth muscle, but also on target cell membranes such as epithelial, endothelial and alveolar type II cells, submucosal glands, postcapillary venules and nerves, all of which are sites of tachykinin activity [126] . NEP selectivity makes it possible to degrade SP and NKA, blocking their bronchoconstriction activity while the inhibition, especially if associated with O 3 -induced BHR [406] , potentiates NKA [126] and SP effects [421] . Exfoliation of epithelial cells and other serious cytopathic effects -caused by viruses harmful to cells [20, 72, 130] , chemical substances, pollutants, etc. -points first to a NEP deficiency, thereby preventing both the destruction of bronchoconstriction neuropeptides as well as the synthesis of those with bronchodilator action, also amplifying the inflammatory action of tachykinins and reflex bronchoconstriction [18] . If, as a result of epithelial damage, the sensitive nerve endings of bronchial mucosa remain exposed to the bronchial lumen, having a much lower threshold of stimulation, they are stimulated continually by inflammatory metabolic products [21] . In this way, as a result of antidromic stimulation of these nerve endings, an exaggerated neuropeptide release with a highly rapid and diffuse action on bronchial airway occurs [21] . BK could play a part in allergic asthma since, administered either inhaled or IV, it provokes bronchospasm in asthmatics, but not in healthy subjects. It works indirectly, probably via the stimulation of sensitive nerve terminals, with consequent retrograde release of SP no longer degraded by NEP, NKs and CGRP by an axon reflex [421, 429] . BK antagonist therapy is based on these premises [18] . Following these phenomena of mucosal edema, smooth muscle constriction and intraluminal secretion increase, cannot, in itself, constitute the primum movens of the pathology under examination [722] . Mast cells and eosinophils are both able to contribute in a more significant manner -by means of tryptase action on smooth muscle tone [154] . In the asthmatic, smooth muscles could evolve under the effect of certain stimuli from a multiple-unit to a single-unit system. These changes in the contractile properties of smooth muscle in human lungs may be associated with changes in myosin H chain isoforms, thus contributing to BHR [138] . It has also been suggested that in asthmatics there is a reduction of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor (EDIF) of the muscle contractility, or of NEP, a factor with a relaxing effect on smooth muscle [675] , where it is located. In any event, the result is the loss of the barrier mechanism and therefore of bronchoconstrictor control. A noteworthy impulse has also been given to cAMP study, which that is entrusted with muscle relaxant effects and inhibits mast cell degranulation and consequently histamine discharge, unlike cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate). Normally there is a balance between cAMP and cGMP, which can be broken in either one direction or the other. Maintaining the cAMP level within normal limits is useful to bring adrenergic receptors back to a functional stage in which they can again be activated. Recent research shows that cAMP production induced by adrenergic b receptors is not deficient in the PBMCs of asthmatics compared to healthy subjects [155] , as was suggested previously. However, PBMCs of patients even with stable asthma do not have the ability to make adenylyl cyclase more powerful [155] , so the lack in increase of cAMP concentrations is correlated with a transduction defect. There are two possible pathogenic mechanisms: the existence of a generalized deficit involving bronchial smooth muscles, no longer relaxed under the effect of cAMP metabolism, and therefore the impossibility of potentiating cAMP when facing a bronchoconstriction stimulus, which could result in an equilibrium upset between cAMP and cGMP; or, alternatively, the adenylyl cyclase deficit could reflect negatively on IL production by PBMCs, the tissue inflammation being at the basis of an increased BHR [155] . In vitro, in biopsy specimens of airway smooth muscle of asthmat sufferers, there is a correlation between muscle functions and BHR level, indicating that BHR, which is observed in the presence of a great variety of stimuli, is a demonstration of the noteworthy contribution given to bronchoconstriction by the bronchial smooth muscle spasm. The differences between asthmatics and nonasthmatics have not yet been fully elucidated, nor have the variations induced by different types of stimuli. It is believed that there are other exogenous factors at the basis of this anomaly. Probably, the airway infiltration of inflammatory cells contributes to smooth muscle tone by the action, on a local level, of various mediators such as histamine, PAF and eicosanoids [138] . neurogenic inflammation affecting target cells, cholinergic reflex bronchoconstriction, hyperemia, edema and mucus hypersecretion, with an increase in vasal permeability will follow. This axon reflex, amplifying the immune inflammation, could therefore represent an important pathogenic element in provoking asthma and BHR [21] . \u2211 Moreover, there is a receptor loss: if they belong to the b type, there are no disturbances of note; if they are H 2 , production of PGE 2 , which acts by inhibiting, at least in part, the smooth muscle responses to histamine and NKA ceases. The receptor loss by numerous epithelial ILs involves mainly IL 1 , with a possible amplification of the inflammatory response and consequential jeopardizing of lesion repair [22] . \u2211 Other studies have shown the loss of NO production, catalyzed by iNOS (inducible NO synthase) and induced into the epithelium by TNF-a, IL 1b and IFN-g, also compromising both vascular muscle regulation and harmful chemical substance clearance [10] . \u2211 Another pathogenic hypothesis cites the inhalation of endotoxins present in Gram-negative germs, identified with the somatic antigen, which are located in the cell walls as LPS as a possible culprit. Such toxins, brought into homes by environmental germs, could provoke bronchoconstriction in asthmatics in doses of 20-40 mg, and in healthy subjects as well in doses of 200 mg [433] . \u2211 BHR persistence, also produced by MBP-induced discharge of factors of epithelial origin stimulating muscarinic reactivity [57] , could be explained by the thickening of the lamina reticularis below the BM [600] . A crucial point is played by myofibroblasts, capable of producing subepithelial fibrosis, whereas in asthmatics an excess in their numbers below the bronchial epithelium, with a close correlation between the number of myofibroblasts and the collagen layer thickness, has been reported. It is therefore evident that fibrosis jeopardizes the respiratory function and that a network of contractile myofibroblasts underneath the BM markedly contributes to BHR persistence. Moreover, activated eosinophils present in these locations, as well as deposits of ECP, stimulate the synthesis of hyaluronate and proteoglycans in human fibroblasts [600] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 652, "end": 657, "text": "[726]", "ref_id": "BIBREF728"}, {"start": 926, "end": 931, "text": "[722]", "ref_id": "BIBREF724"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1539, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1717, "text": "[406]", "ref_id": "BIBREF409"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1741, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1762, "text": "[421]", "ref_id": "BIBREF424"}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1874, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1878, "text": "72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1883, "text": "130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 2184, "end": 2188, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2429, "end": 2433, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2617, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2950, "end": 2955, "text": "[421,", "ref_id": "BIBREF424"}, {"start": 2956, "end": 2960, "text": "429]", "ref_id": "BIBREF432"}, {"start": 3012, "end": 3016, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3210, "end": 3215, "text": "[722]", "ref_id": "BIBREF724"}, {"start": 3353, "end": 3358, "text": "[154]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 3649, "end": 3654, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 3863, "end": 3868, "text": "[675]", "ref_id": "BIBREF696"}, {"start": 4641, "end": 4646, "text": "[155]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 4792, "end": 4797, "text": "[155]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 5391, "end": 5396, "text": "[155]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 6160, "end": 6165, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 6491, "end": 6495, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 6917, "end": 6921, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 7170, "end": 7174, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 7556, "end": 7561, "text": "[433]", "ref_id": "BIBREF455"}, {"start": 7688, "end": 7692, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 7771, "end": 7776, "text": "[600]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}, {"start": 8414, "end": 8419, "text": "[600]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anomalies in Airway Epithelium"}, {"text": "The main cause of asthma inflammation, which, apart from smooth muscls spasms, also depends on mucosal edema and on secretion changes, with formation of mucus plugs in the smaller bronchi.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Alterations of Biochemical Homeostasis"}, {"text": "Bronchial edema is attributable to the increase in capillary permeability with exocytosis of serum proteins in interstitial areas with an array of mediators among which are histamine, BKs, PAF, PGE and LTs, potentiating each other in turn.

Recently NO equal to EDRF has been localized at the airway epithelium, where it could act as a mediator of bronchodilation under the nervous control to counterbalance the bronchoconstriction caused by mast cell degranulation (or by ET). Moreover, NO, produced in large quantities, provokes an increase in vascular permeability and cytotoxic effects, contributing to epithelial denudation [10] . In this cytotoxic activity, it also mediates O 3 effects -a significant fact given the increased incidence/prevalence of asthma [759] . From a pathogenetic point of view, NO deriving from airway epithelium (as well as from macrophages, mast cells and Th1 cells) could play an important role in amplifying and perpetuating the Th2-mediated inflammation (Chap. 4). iNOS can be induced in the epithelium by pro-inflammatory ILs such as TNF-a and IL 1b , secreted by macrophages, and IFN-g derived from Th1 cells [759] . It is also feasible that even viral infections induce iNOS production by the epithelium, thus increasing NO secretion during asthmatic attacks [443] . Elevated concentrations of NO thus generated in the airways carry out a suppressive action on Th1 cells and a reductive action on IFN-g, resulting in a net proliferation of Th2 cells. CSs inhibit iNOS both directly and by blocking pertinent IL synthesis by macrophages [443] : in fact, in asthmatics treated with oral or inhaled CS (ICS), NO levels are reduced, in contrast to untreated patients [293] .

Running provokes EIA more easily than jogging and this, in turn, more frequently than walking. In evaluating the triggering factors, a variety of issues come into play including cold, dry air, environmental pollutants, a recent allergic exposure or inflammatory mediators. The pathophysiology and cause of EIA remain controversial, but two theories have been offered: 1) the hyperosmolar theory and 2) the airway rewarming theory. Warm air and humidity can accelerate bronchospasm, exacerbated by cold air inhaled during exercise, especially if open-mouth breathing results from increased need for O 2 [606] . Hyperpnea induced by physical exertion causes water release via evaporation of mucosal periciliary fluid with consequent local hyperosmolarity [606] , which could provoke bronchospasm via direct vagal action, or by induction of mast and other cells to produce mediators, thus activating the successive cascade of immunological events [464] . Other authors, however, place emphasis on heat loss caused by hyperpnea, which could have consequences on subsequent rebreathing, with vasodilation of peribronchial vascular plexus, hyperemia, edema and, finally, bronchoconstriction [66] . Therefore, thermal shock could occur [394] . Since asthmatics have a hyperplastic vascular bed possessing greater permeability, the initial cooling down and subsequent warming up could cause bronchospasm via a true vascular blockage, with the onset of reactive hyperemia and edema involving the bronchial walls [394] . At the moment, however, there is insufficient data to clarify which of the two theories (warming up and hyperosmolarity) is pre-eminent. In studying BALF before and after exercise, no significant differences were found in histamine and tryptase levels. This could make doubtful a possible intervention by the airway mast cells accompanied by liberation of histamine and other mediators [278] . However, Kikawa et al have shown that in children with severe asthma, following physical exercise, LTE 4 urinary levels were clearly higher than those of controls, thus concluding that airway reactivity seems to be a salient factor in EIA development [294, 295] .

The action of respiratory viruses on the airways is modulated by several factors, including atopy, male sex, age, type of virus, possible BHR and development of correlated symptoms [545] . Infection by respiratory viruses can induce in children (even nonatopic children) [72] airway obstruction even though limited to the upper tract, BHR, functional changes in the airways, and PFT changes, which can persist for weeks after recovery (Table 11 .9) [20, 72, 130] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 805, "end": 810, "text": "[545]", "ref_id": "BIBREF527"}, {"start": 895, "end": 899, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1081, "text": "72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1086, "text": "130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1059, "end": 1068, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "Infections, especially if contracted in the early stages of life, can damage the mechanisms underlying the mucosal barrier, thereby allowing a massive allergen penetration.

In ten patients with AR and BHR, their responses to BPT to both histamine and allergen (ragweed) were evaluated during an experimental infection from Rhinovirus. Four weeks later, BHR had increased in both tests; specifically, only one patient reacted prior to infection with a late response to the allergen, while 8/10 manifested it during observation, 5/7 persistently (Fisher, 0.0027) [341] . Rhinoviruses are able to increase BHR and promote the appearance of late reactions to the specific allergen. Even if the virus does not usually have a direct effect on the airways, the infection heightens the eosinophil response to challenge [341] . The major risk of causing asthma in children aged >2 years was that of the association of Rhinovirus infection with the sensitization to domestic allergens and exposure to passive smoke [161] . In asthmatic children the triggering element of the exacerbations was represented in 66% of cases by Rhinovirus, compared to 13% in controls. Furthermore, the relapses and PEF reductions were numerically equal to hospital admission [281] . It is hypothesized that even a subliminal inflammation induces in endothelial cells CD54 expression, CD11a/ CD18 receptor, which plays the role of the linking site for the virus. Linking to CD54, the virus can interfere with CD11a/CD18 and the host's natural defenses, thus inflammatory reactions to viral infection can stimulate Rhinovirus receptors to induce new ones, thereby spreading viral infection [280] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 494, "text": "[280,", "ref_id": "BIBREF303"}, {"start": 495, "end": 499, "text": "547]", "ref_id": "BIBREF549"}, {"start": 515, "end": 519, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 646, "end": 651, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": "BIBREF344"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1047, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": "BIBREF344"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1297, "text": "[341]", "ref_id": "BIBREF344"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1491, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1731, "text": "[281]", "ref_id": "BIBREF304"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2144, "text": "[280]", "ref_id": "BIBREF303"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 192, "text": "Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 500, "end": 509, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "To summarize these reports, a unifying mechanism has been proposed [72] , suggesting that virus action has a major implication in triggering asthma.

Above all, respiratory viruses, in addition to provoking airway inflammation and prolonging its effects -either directly or through cellular products infected by them (such as IFN-g) -promote the formation of virus-specific IgE and the release of mediators. epithelium with subsequent airway exposure of vagal receptors [298] . Studies [201, 298] indicate that RSV triggers eosinophil degranulation by directly activating them [299] , a plausible and stimulating link between VRI and asthma exacerbations. Attention has been drawn to the role of alveolar macrophages in RSV infections: once infected, they acquire the ability to replicate RSV, also expressing HLA-DR and immunoregulatory ILs such as IL 1b and TNF-a, capable of stimulating phagocyte cytotoxic responses. Consequently macrophages, by regulating local immune responses, perform an antiviral activity conditioning both viral replication and disease severity [401] . Lymphocyte studies have shown that the CD4/CD8 ratio in the lower tract is 22.5:1, and in the upper tract 15:1: thus diminishing the CTL importance, residing, however, in intraparenchymal locations, not intraluminal or bronchiolar [182] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 67, "end": 71, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 671, "end": 676, "text": "[298]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 687, "end": 692, "text": "[201,", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 693, "end": 697, "text": "298]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 778, "end": 783, "text": "[299]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1278, "text": "[401]", "ref_id": "BIBREF404"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1517, "text": "[182]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 163, "text": "Table  11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "Even influenza and parainfluenza viruses, Rhinovirus, Mycoplasma and Adenovirus often trigger respiratory infections, which can be found in very young babies as copathogenic factors [514] , becoming recurrent in older children (Chap. 22).

GER is a pathology more commonly found in younger infants who have not yet learned to sit up and is determined by functional immaturity of the lower esophageal sphincter. GER is caused by the retro-grade movement of gastric contents across this sphincter into the esophagus [702] . The estimated incidence of GER in asthmatic children reaches 50%-60% and can be an aggravating factor of the disease, higher than in the general population [702] . The reflux of acid material provokes bronchospasm, very probably through a vagal reflex. Exposed receptors could be activated with stimulation of the X afferent fibers situated in the esophageal mucosa. This could provoke a vagus-mediated increase of BHR with amplification of the bronchoconstriction effects of other exogenous stimuli [221] . The activation of this reflex between the esophagus and the airways is also related to the fact that embryologically both derive from the anterior archenteron and that they have a common autonomous innervation (Chap. 9).

Taking into consideration that the reduction in caliber of the lower airway tracts reduces the penetration drug in the peripheral areas [584] , and that newborn infants tend to breathe through their nose, in the best hypothe-sis the amount of the drug that is deposited in the airways is only 33%-50% of that inhaled per os [344] . Also, the correlation between the drug concentration in the aerosolized or nebulized solution (Cs) and that per inhaled volume unit of gas (Ci) appears to be inconstant, since for a given Cs the Ci can be five times greater in a young infant compared to an older child, in whom the inhaled dosage is independent of weight [112] . Therefore, doses for children aged 6 months to 5 years have to be regulated according to weight in kg, to balance the discrepancies that arise from a dosage based on a single measure for all [112] .

In case of a severe attack, epinephrine remains the preferred drug [352] . b 2 -Adrenergics for predosed MDIs or nebulizers ( Fig. 11 .40) offer the best results because of rapidity of action, good efficacy and limited adverse effects on the cardiovascular apparatus. Given the recognized benefits of short-acting b 2 -adrenergics, attention was directed to extending the duration of effect of b 2 -adrenergic agonists. As a result, long-acting b 2 -adrenergics with a 12-h duration of action were introduced: salmeterol and formoterol. For an immediate effect, lasting 4-6 h, albuterol is recommended: to limit the adverse effects of short-acting b-agonists, the stereoisomer of albuterol, levalbuterol, compared to racemic albuterol significantly reduced the number of hospitalizations in the ED management of acute asthma in children aged 1-18, but the hospitalization length of stay was not significantly shorter between the two groups [84] . For an effect with 5 min of latency, but with long-term effect (12 h), salmeterol 25 mg is recommended. A dose of 50 mg has induced a significant HR increase in the first 5 min [19] in children of 13.4\u00b12.5 years. Formoterol has the same latency and lasts 12 h [441] , while systemic administration of formoterol (via the oral route) displays a short duration of action (4 h). Salmeterol is a long-acting b 2 -agonist with a long side chain, diffuses quickly from 3. According to Spitzer et al [608] , these drugs aggravate asthma, rendering the airways more susceptible to stimuli. In effect, though reducing the acute episode, they promote delayed bronchial inflammation, which is at the basis of chronic asthma. 4. Burrows and Lebowitz [62] agree with these findings and advise against regular, high dosages of b 2 -adrenergics. 5. Prospective studies in children have shown that prolonged usage of b 2 -adrenergics does not reduce BHR [571] . 6 . In patients treated with terbutaline, a rebound type of BHR can occur when treatment is stopped: conversely, in children 1.5-11 years admitted to an ICU, the same drug was shown to be safe and effective [288] . 7. It should be noted that for b 2 -adrenergics, dosages that double the usual ones, even if only for 7 days, amplify airway reactivity even in the late reaction [110] . Chronic use of high doses results in hypokalemia, because ATP stimulation causes K + passage within the skeletal muscles, an effect that is strengthened by hypercapnia, hypoxia and hypokalemia, characteristics of acute asthma-status asthmaticus [310, 697] ; even theophylline can provoke hypokalemia, and together with CSs, hyperkaluria [310] . 8. Few and contradictory results have been obtained with these drugs in bronchiolitis: epinephrine was more efficacious than salbutamol [401] . Probably, the negative results depend on having measured the Raw index of seriously ill infants with widespread edema and mucous secretions, thereby reducing the dose of the aerosolized drug [112] . Moreover, the total resistance of upper airways can be reduced by 50% at this age, making measurements unreliable [206] . This can also be related to a reduced response to b-adrenergic stimuli effected by respiratory viruses and therefore to that of b-adrenergic drugs [73] . 9.

Control of the disease is reduced in patients who treat asthma with bronchodilators continually, for a long time and regularly, patients becoming dependent, and thus inhaling ever higher doses: in this way desensitization of b-adrenergic receptors occurs, that is repeated administration reduces the bronchodilator effect. 2. According to Page [467] , this is probably caused by a disrupted equilibrium between inflammatory and antiinflammatory factors, as a result of reduced anti-inflammatory release, caused by the powerful antidegranulation accomplished by b 2 -adrenergics on mast cells. In time, this leads to the deactivation of natural defense mechanisms, allowing the inhaled allergens to penetrate in the bronchial tree more deeply [467] , with loss of the action inhibiting BM thickening and smooth muscle hypertrophy, deleterious aspects for asthmatics [516] likely leading to an irreversible chronicity [467] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 158, "text": "[697]", "ref_id": "BIBREF680"}, {"start": 176, "end": 181, "text": "[571]", "ref_id": "BIBREF573"}, {"start": 601, "end": 606, "text": "[467]", "ref_id": "BIBREF452"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1004, "text": "[467]", "ref_id": "BIBREF452"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1127, "text": "[516]", "ref_id": "BIBREF537"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1178, "text": "[467]", "ref_id": "BIBREF452"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An Assessment of b 2 -Adrenergics"}, {"text": "IB has an anticholinergic activity that is similar to that of atropine, but also a reduced systemic absorption.

In particular, three recent studies [89, 148, 622] excluded its use in hospital treatments of children aged 2-18 years with moderate to severe asthma and, specifically, in association with MDIdelivered albuterol and IV-administered methylprednisolone, even though no undesired side effects were found to justify the exclusion [622] .

In particular, cAMP level maintenance within a normal range is useful for bringing the adrenergic receptors back to a functional state in which they can again become activated [703] . CSs inhibit the metachromatic cell mediators and basophil releasability, and reduce circulating eosinophil number and presumably also those in the tissues, but not of macrophages [212] . These effects are due to IL inhibition that activates these cells and stimulates them into reaching inflammatory sites [570] . In asthmatic children (80% atopic), serum concentrations of IL 5 , CD25, and ECP remained significantly higher than controls, even after treatment with oral CSs. Thus, T cell-mediated inflammation may persist in childhood asthma despite apparent clinical remission associated with conventional treatment [172] . The most powerful action of endogenous CSs is directed against inflammation, markedly exacerbated if the adrenal gland is removed [570] . In this process, the main activity is aimed at suppressing the transcription of genes involved in inflammation, and, to this end, their re-properly evaluated since children had already reached maximum bronchodilation with \"liberal and elevated\" doses of nebulized albuterol [89] . Even in children or teenagers with nonsevere asthma treated with albuterol and IV-administered methylprednisolone, DiGiulio et al [148] did not find clinical differences between theophylline and placebo, although at the cost of possible type II errors. Although concern was expressed about the dangers of improper use of theophylline [89] , no related adverse effects were reported in either study: nausea was the most toxic symptom encountered [622] . On the other hand, several studies have shown theophylline effectiveness (ref in 615) . In patients admitted to ED and treated with theophylline, discharges were more frequent than admittance to hospital (6%), which differs from patients treated with metaproterenol and cortisone (21%), and with an overall cost fivefold lower [740] . Mechanical reasons, especially in life-threatening forms of infantile asthma, can impede b 2 -adrenergic passage. This is theophylline's strong point: administered IV in these forms it produces an almost immediate clinically detectable, objective bronchodilation [664] .

Re-examined by various researchers in ten studies, they were unable to definitively verify this correlation, partly due to methodological errors [123] , or because the former were completely absent, whereas the rest normalized, or improved, within 2 weeks [613] . No school-related differences were found between asthmatics (whether theophylline-treated or not) and controls [353] . Parents were unable to decide to which treatment (theophylline or ceptors interact with AP-1 (activator protein-1) and NF-kB (nuclear factor of chain k of Bs) (Fig. 11 .43) [568] or, diversely, render more potent the inhibitor of the chain k of B, type a (kB-a), inhibitor of NF-kB ( Fig. 11.44 ) [568] . However, the bronchial smooth cells lack the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa) required to form a complex with the CS receptor, therefore CSs cannot contrast the ADAM33 accelerated proliferation of bronchial smooth-muscle cells and the resulting BHR [539] . From a clinical point of view, the latency time is lengthened (6-12 h) compared to other drugs [683] , and a maximum bronchoprotecting effect can be attained after many months of continuous treatment [570] . Consequently, although CSs are an effective treatment on ameliorating asthma symptoms and represent the most effective anti-inflammatory therapy of asthma, this therapy is symptomatic since the disease flares when treatment is stopped [517, 645, 671, 680] .

Pharmacokinetics studies suggest that the fraction deposited in the airways is absorbed in an active form in variable concentrations, and passes, in turn, into the circulation. In fact 80% of the amount deposited in the oropharynx is absorbed by the intestine, passing through the liver where most of it is metabolized. Part of it reaches the systemic circulation where it joins with the amount originated in the airways. These two rates are aggregated, but are continually reduced as a result of recirculation and hepatic deactivation, as is evident from Fig. 11 .45 [703] . Nonetheless, there is a different bioavailability (the drug rate bypassing the hepatic filter) and a rapid CS metabolic clearance CS reaching the circulation [22, 359] . Substandial differences can their baseline PFT and indices of airway inflammation after 2 weeks [593] . CSs do not relieve symptoms promptly and children may not improve within a few days [517] . So CS efficacy is significant in late asthmatic responses, chronic asthma and, more generally, in suppression of chronic inflammation [570] . This effective anti-inflammatory action on mast cells and eosinophils occurs in the epithelium (each 2.5-fold) and in submucosa (from 2-to 10-fold, respectively) and, on clinical grounds, in BHR improvement [258] (Table 11 .14). Basically, there are no definitive effects, since the underlying inflammation is still active in childhood asthma despite apparent clinical remission even after years on ICSs [476] . Thus, any beneficial CS effect on BHR is not due to the prevention or resolution of remodeling of the airway wall [645] . The reason is that CSs have marked effects in inhibiting T-cell activation, but these effects are not reflected in changes of overall cell numbers in the circulation. So there is neither a discernible effect on the underlying mechanisms of inflammation [208] , nor on methacholine responsiveness [645] . In addition, during the period of alveolar development, CS administration may result in decreased lung-cell mass and in the presence of too few abnormally large alveoli [727] . Also, for this reason it may be prudent to avoid CS use in the very young, because they appear not to be very effective, as is also demonstrated by their lack of impact on PFT [620] . FP, mometasone furoate (MF) and, to a lesser extent, BDP are thought to be second-generation ICSs in that they display both increased anti-inflammatory potency and systemic bioavailability [434] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 119, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 141, "end": 145, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "120,", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "203,", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 156, "end": 160, "text": "249,", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 161, "end": 165, "text": "284,", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "633]", "ref_id": "BIBREF635"}, {"start": 741, "end": 746, "text": "[703]", "ref_id": "BIBREF705"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "359]", "ref_id": "BIBREF382"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1020, "text": "[593]", "ref_id": "BIBREF617"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1112, "text": "[517]", "ref_id": "BIBREF538"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1254, "text": "[570]", "ref_id": "BIBREF572"}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1469, "text": "[258]", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1666, "text": "[476]", "ref_id": "BIBREF477"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1788, "text": "[645]", "ref_id": "BIBREF647"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2049, "text": "[208]", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2092, "text": "[645]", "ref_id": "BIBREF647"}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2269, "text": "[727]", "ref_id": "BIBREF729"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2453, "text": "[620]", "ref_id": "BIBREF604"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2650, "text": "[434]", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 729, "end": 736, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1479, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Corticosteroids"}, {"text": "In addition to dysphonia and oral candidiasis, several undesirable effects of inhaled CS (including osteoporosis) occurred in 163 children aged 14.4\u00b12.1 years with 787 Drugs to Be Used Osteopenia was strongly associated with growth suppression (odds ratio, 5.6).

Severe growth retardation and adrenal suppression were described in children taking FP doses >1,000 mg/day [715] , and acute adrenal crisis associated with inhaled FP in three children presenting with hypoglycemic coma and convulsions [651] .A probable explanation for these findings is that FP taken twice a day accumulates in the blood, which has a half-life of 7-8 h and a distribution 4 to 5-fold greater than other drugs, leading to an increased risk of systemic side effects such as growth retardation and adrenal insufficiency [61] .

Using the equivalent of 8 mg/kg of BDP [649] , a child should be considered at risk of HPA-axis suppression or of delayed growth [198] . The effects on the skeletal system have been evaluated by dosing two markers correlated with osteosynthesis and growth rate, osteocalcin and the carboxy terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PCIP), showing a growth decrease after 1 and 5 months of deactivated by the liver, and only a limited amount, equal to 1% and 10% [23] , reaches the circulation. Side effects are few with preparations active by inhalation and with reduced systemic absorption, which, undoubtedly, have resulted in therapeutic progress -among these preparations are BDP, BUD, deflazacort, flunisolide [26] , even if giving rise to controversy [668] . FP, because of its more favorable risk-benefit ratio, is preferable to BDP for the long-term treatment of children with asthma, especially if moderate doses are required [135] . It should, however, be clarified that with inhaled doses of 400 mg/day and using a valve spacer, the systemic absorption is reduced to zero, given that all of the drug ingested remains in the spacer, thereby eliminating any difference in the bioavailability of different medications [359] . Both BPD used with the Volumatic or the Jet as well as BUD taken with Nebuhaler have a lesser systemic activity compared to the same dose inhaled with an MDI or a DPI, even if rinsing the mouth after use reduces or abates ingestion, as previously mentioned [26] . Additionally, drop formulations (deflazacort is prescribed in doses of 1-2 mg = 1-2 drops/kg) favor personalized prescriptions and ensure compliance in younger children.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 255, "text": "[517]", "ref_id": "BIBREF538"}, {"start": 297, "end": 302, "text": "[649]", "ref_id": "BIBREF651"}, {"start": 387, "end": 392, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 974, "end": 978, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1021, "text": "[668]", "ref_id": "BIBREF689"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1199, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1490, "text": "[359]", "ref_id": "BIBREF382"}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1754, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bone Density"}, {"text": "Other adverse phenomena, such as HPA axis suppression, growth retardation [120, 285] , and are, in our opinion, provoked by prolonged treatment and by administering high dosages, chiefley orally [120] , which can lead to a potential axis inhibition, with reduced ACTH secretion due to negative feedback mechanisms and the adrenal gland inability to respond to adrenocorticotropic stimulation, giving way to severe risks in patients prone to respiratory arrest during severe acute attacks [517] . A complete functional restoration may require up to 1 year, whereas treatment limited to 1 week is usually devoid of negative consequences: 8-10 days after stopping treatment, HPA function returns to normal [560] . In adults, a possible axis deficiency can be revealed only through metapyrone or insulin tolerance tests, or through a CRH test [560] . Recent data suggest that CRH and its CS regulation may be essential for the control of airway inflammation and the maintenance of lung homeostasis in asthma [588] . Several studies have not found such anomalies [487, 684] , or a small but significant degree of growth impairment in children receiving only 400 mg/day of BDP [157] . Regarding the dosage factor, important undesired systemic effects of chronically and systemically administered medications (Tables 11.20-11.22) are found in children 7-10 years old with severe asthma, treated with doses of FP increased from 800-1500 mg up to 2,250 mg/day, leading to an increased risk of systemic side effects such as undetectable cortisol levels [650] . Acute adrenal crises have been reported by several studies, all in children treated with inhaled FP [630, 650-652, 736, 757] (see \"Linear treatment with BUD, both in full doses of 800 mg/m 2 /day and half doses, with no variations in growth measured by conventional parameters [603] . The combined examination of PCIP and amino terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PCIIINP) has shown the suppression of both bone turnover and collagen after twice-weekly treatment with DPI BUD and BDP(800 mg/day), more evident in the latter case [42] . The effects on PCIIINP [734] and on osteocalcin were subsequently confirmed by other studies [655, 733] . Bone density was also measured using a densitometer and an absorptiometer, without noting any significant differences between asthmatic children and controls. Vice-versa, osteocalcin was shown to be reduced in the densitometer compared to the absorptiometer, a result that can be ascribed to the disease and not to BDP, according to the authors [312] . Some maintain that osteocalcin is not a marker sensitive to bone turnover, in that asthma per se can decrease it tangibly, making it of little use in evaluating the effects [312] . Others have measured bone density without finding any significant difference [17, 300] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 79, "text": "[120,", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 80, "end": 84, "text": "285]", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 195, "end": 200, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 488, "end": 493, "text": "[517]", "ref_id": "BIBREF538"}, {"start": 703, "end": 708, "text": "[560]", "ref_id": "BIBREF562"}, {"start": 839, "end": 844, "text": "[560]", "ref_id": "BIBREF562"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1009, "text": "[588]", "ref_id": "BIBREF612"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1063, "text": "[487,", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "684]", "ref_id": "BIBREF667"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1176, "text": "[157]", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1548, "text": "[650]", "ref_id": "BIBREF652"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1833, "text": "[603]", "ref_id": "BIBREF587"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2093, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2124, "text": "[734]", "ref_id": "BIBREF736"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "text": "[655,", "ref_id": "BIBREF657"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2199, "text": "733]", "ref_id": "BIBREF735"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2552, "text": "[312]", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2733, "text": "[312]", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2817, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2818, "end": 2822, "text": "300]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Suppression of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis"}, {"text": "Concern has been raised that the use of ICSs in children may be associated with growth suppression. Recent evidence presents conflicting results regarding reduced [157, 593, 649, 690] and normal growth [444, 684, 718] , including a wide and well-documented study [8] that meta-analyzed 21 pediatric studies, based on statistical analysis and excluding the studies employing different methods of evaluation [729] . A recent meta-analysis [583] has concluded that moderate doses of the inhaled steroid BDP in children with mild to moderate asthma has been shown to significantly affect linear growth. Also, for the effect of moderate doses of inhaled fluticasone, a statistically significant difference was revealed. However, two recent long-term studies have been reassuring [6, 645] . The growth of a cohort of 142 children with mild to moderate asthma was followed until they reached adult height; the subjects received a mean dose of BUD of 412 mg/day for a mean of 9.2 years. The adult height of this cohort on long-term inhaled BUD therapy was 0.3 cm greater than expected. Its sole weakness was a high rate (72%) of drop-outs in the control group [6] , as in other conventionally treated children [568] . In the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) study, a randomized trial for more than 5 years in >1,000 children with mild to moderate asthma, neither inhaled BUD nor nedocromil was better than placebo in terms of PFT, but BUD provided substantial clinical improvement as compared with nedocromil or placebo [645] . Significantly, both studies reported a transient reduction in growth velocity only in the 1st year of treatment [6, 645] . In longer clinical trials, despite a strict selection process, compliance problems can be noted. Problems increase with duration of participation, increasing child age, and the presence of less family cohesion or attention problems in children [625] . Height may diminish with an increase in dose and return to normal when treatment is reduced or stopped [646] . The attitude of inhaled CS overdosing in children was recently clearly documented. In 8,913 children, the CS inhaled at daily dose ranges equivalent to BDP were 350-2400 mg, 265-3400 mg, and 300-4800 mg for the 0-4, 5-11, and 12to 16-year-olds [171] . We believe that many results not associated with HPA-axis suppression may depend on the use of safe doses of 100-200 mg/day, which should proportionally be reduced as compared to adult doses, better in mg/kg, as has previously been pointed out. Although inhaled FP was found to reduce morning serum cortisol concentrations by 17%-43%, even at low doses of 176 mg/day [169] or of 200 mg/day; prepubescent children treated with FP 100 mg and 200 mg daily for 1 year showed no statistically significant differences in growth rates, similarly to placebo-treated control subjects [7] . FP DPI 100-200 mg administered daily to 437 children (4-11 years old) with persistent asthma for 12 weeks in a randomized, DB, parallel-group, multicenter trial did not affect 24-h urinary free-cortisol excretion, and improved PFT in children even as young as 4 and 5 years old [484] . Often, good results are obtained in children with low doses [205, 438, 487, 684, 729] , and even in adults, doses can be reduced with the same results [231, 285] . A 12-month 100-mg daily treatment of FP in 625 children aged 1-3 years with mild to moderate recurrent wheeze resulted in improved symptom control with no effect on growth rate, and a serum and urinary cortisol concentration suppression of 10% and 14%, respectively [45] . A recent study has set up a milestone in the treatment of pediatric asthma, having demonstrated that repeated bursts of oral CS at 1-2 mg/kg/day (maximum=50 mg) for a 5-day period are not only effective, but above all are safe in children, since they are not associated with any lasting perturbation in bone metabolism, bone mineralization or adrenal function [160] . In addition, low cortisol levels normalized after discontinuing inhaled FP [757] . Others have noted that growth decline is reduced after the first 6 weeks or at most within 18 weeks [159] . A 6-month treatment with inhaled BUD and FP did not induce body fat accumulation in 21 of 26 asthmatic children; however, in five children aged from 4.3 to 5.3 years, the treatment was associated with growth velocity below the third percentile [550] . The magnitude of these changes in linear growth has varied between other studies using different ICS preparations, indicating on the one hand that either study design or specific steroid preparation/dose may be important considerations [434] , and on the other the lack of reliable data on compliance may seriously confound the study of long-term growth effects of ICSs [732] . DB, randomized placebo-controlled tests have also been carried out [729] [730] [731] 733] , employing knemometry (from knhmh, leg), which ensures reproducible findings (Figs. 11.46-11.48) [365] , to evaluate ICS effects on lower limb linear growth, which always proved to be re-duced, though not with FP [731] . The results on PCIIINP of the same group [734] , completed by measuring cortisol and insulin-like growth factor levels [735] , and additional data have confirmed these studies [365] . In children aged 0-3 years, within a 3-week period the increases in the lower-leg length during placebo, BUD 400, and FP 400 treatments (200 mg inhaled twice daily) were 85, 45, and 34 mm/d, respectively [11] . Nevertheless, some aspects of the assessment of safety are unique to younger children, including the rapid growth velocity and their different metabolism. The rapid growth in the first 2-3 years of life may make the child more vulnerable to the adverse effects of drugs and/or disease. More seriously, the safety findings in adults and schoolchildren cannot be extrapolated uncritically to younger children [11] .We deem that the concern about potential dysfunc-791 Drugs to Be Used Fig. 11.46 . A knemometer.The child is positioned so that the knee is positioned at a right angle and the feet are comfortably placed. At the first visit a template is made by drawing around the child's feet, so that at the subsequent visit positioning is identical. Fig. 11 .47. Diagram showing knemometer and manipulation of the lower leg. The lower leg is moved around in order to gain maximum reading of the digital ruler. Alternatively, knemometry may be measured by a hand-held knemometer, provided with an electronic caliber, which measures the length of the lower leg from above the knee to below the heel. Measurements are taken with the child in a supine position with a 90\u00b0flexion in hip, knee, and ankle joints. A fixed cap is held against the knee and the other, adjustable cap is placed under the heel. Both caps are parallel, and the distance is ongoing measured electronically with a resolution of 10 mm. An investigator stabilizes the knee cap with one hand,while slowly compressing the heel cap up to a predefined pressure of 80 g with the other hand, as determined by an interposed spring. At this pressure, a microswitch is activated and the reading is recorded on a computer tions is valid in cases of oral and/or high doses as an intercurrent necessity [347] . A meta-analysis suggests that moderate doses of inhaled BDP in four studies and 450 children and FP in one study and 183 children with mild to moderate asthma cause a decrease in linear growth velocity of 1.51 cm/year and 0.43 cm/year, respectively [583] . However, the increase in height of 277 children aged 4-11 years with chronic asthma was greater with FP than with BDP, 5.01 vs 4.10 cm/year, respectively [151] . These findings should not limit ICS administration in children with moderate/severe asthma [28, 282] . A possible choice is flunisolide, which is freer of adverse effects [215, 228, 494] , provides better penetration and a more homogeneous distribution in the distal airways, also parenterally administered if asthma is more severe [706] . In moderate to severe asthma, the benefits may outweigh the risks associated with continuous use [703] .Various immune parameters are normal in long-term ICS-treated children [347] , but eosinophils are reduced only in patients taking monodoses [497] . In conclusion, short-term and/or alternate-day treatments are safer [438] , with a return to normal basal parameters in a short time, as already detailed [285, 757] . To further reduce potential damage, preparations should be chosen with a longer duration of action and to begin treatment between 3:00 and 5:00 PM (monodose), as there are no differences with qid therapy, nor does it influence 24-h plasma or urinary cortisol levels [497] . It will be sufficient to monitor the effects of treatment in individual patients, while in other cases the risk-benefit analysis is strongly in favor of preventive drugs and of theophylline [285] . However, refer to the comparison of SIT/steroids in Chap. 13.We deem, however, that periodically measuring the growth of asthmatic children on long-term treatment with ICS is a useful practice [728] . An FDA mandate (November 9, 1998) requires labels on inhaled and intranasal CS warning of a potential reduction in linear growth in children demonstrates this concern (accessed from: http://www.fda.gov/cder/news/ cs-label.htm). Table 11 .21 enumerates CS side effects and the consequent measures required, and indicates a few possible causes of treatment failure with these drugs. No posterior subcapsular cataracts have been observed in children treated with ICS [592] , which were seen, however, in 11.3% of 274 children [718] , and in 15%-21% of 163 children [120] , most probably related to chronic oral treatment. Synthetic CS prime IgE synthesis in vitro [304, 452] and the increase in serum IgE levels after 7 days of steroid treatment -viewed as being caused by steroid immunomodulator effects on T lymphocyteswhich is also associated with an FEV 1 reduction [754] . Such effects were not seen ex vivo even after 1 week of steroid treatment [304] . It is not excluded, however, that with larger doses and/or long-term treatments, significant increases in IgE can be seen [318] ; such reports require further evaluations; however, in this respect ICS may not be suitable in children. An in vitro study has demonstrated that hydrocortisone enhances total and allergen-specific IgE production by PBMCs from atopic subjects in vitro. The induction of Der p-specific IgE synthesis in subjects with high serum allergen-specific IgE levels was even greater than that of IL 4 . This is the first report to show that hydrocortisone enhances Der p-specific IgE production from circulating B cells in atopic asthma [101] . The immediate in vivo interpretation of these findings would be that CSs promote allergy, which in theory would mean that the most efficacious treatment for allergic diseases is detrimental regarding disease progress. However, the underlying mechanism by which CSs enhance IgE production in vivo is unknown [101] . High dosage can cause an increase in anxiety, depression, memory reduction, and psychological vulnerability, with a potentially negative impact on asthma severity and on the child's own ability to cope with the disease and its treatment. If, on the other hand, CSs are used in brief cycles, school performance, memory and behavior remain unchanged [432] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 168, "text": "[157,", "ref_id":

Regarding the frequency of reinfections, it has been reported that a second infection recurs in 75% of cases and a third in 65% of cases, thus being the major cause of lower airway disease in infancy.

It is important to emphasize that one atopic or asthmatic parent is a highly predictive factor relating to the insurgence of asthma in the child [271] (Tables 11.24, 11.25). In a prospective study of 47 infants, it is interesting that among children with RSV, 6/11 (54.5%) children with FHA developed asthma compared with 5/36 (13.8%) matched controls without FHA. In these children at age 7 1 /2 asthma was found in process of macrophage-induced lymphocyte activation [503] , as previously seen (Table 11 .9). It can be assumed that in a selected number of children, either affected previously, or at the time of primary RSV infection, there is an alteration of T-cell regulatory mechanisms [523] . Therefore, bronchiolitis can be regarded as an immune system disorganization related to host immaturity, in which T-cell hyperactivity is unraveled, in parallel with persistent and elevated IgE-mediated responses, which, via increased histamine and other mediator release, can, in future, predispose to asthma and BHR [611] . Infants affected by bronchiolitis have a markedly lower number of CD8 + lymphocytes (inversely proportional to IgE maximum titers) than infants suffering from other types of RSV infection [715] during convalescence. Similarly, CD8 T cells are reduced during bronchiolitis [523] and in infants manifesting >3 episodes of wheezing during their 1st year of life [546] . From the fundamental studies of Welliver et al [714] [715] [716] , the presence of anti-RSV sIgE in the nasopharyngeal secretions of children after an episode of bronchiolitis or of pneumonia with wheezing provoked by RSV has been noted, but not in controls also affected by RSV-induced respiratory infections and without bronchoconstriction.Also known is the longer persistence of anti-RSV sIgE in the study babies compared to controls (Table 11 .26) [714] . At the same time, an elevated histaminemia and a clear correlation of anti-RSV sIgE titers with hypoxia as the objective measure of disease severity has been displayed, results that are totally overlapping those following infection by parainfluenza viruses [716] . Furthermore, the higher the levels of anti-RSV IgE in children suffering from bronchiolitis, the more easily the wheezing relapses (70% compared to 20% of those whose levels are not measurable) [715] . IgE produced by RSV therefore has immediate implications on atopic asthma, resulting in the IgE-mast cells linking and mediator and IL release. A subsequent direct mast cell intervention could be inferred from tryptase levels present in BALF of 91.8% of infants, but not so elevated as compared to the levels found in controls, to imply a confirmation [184] .

Such RSV-induced effects on inflammatory cells in bronchiolitis may be much more pathogenic than was formerly believed, as demonstrated by their relationship, which has come to light in recent years, with eosinophils, whose activation appears pathogenically to be more important than that of neutrophils/ macrophages and is characteristic of bronchiolitis but not of other respiratory disease [298] . Significantly higher ECP levels have been reported in infants with RSV-induced bronchiolitis than in controls suffering from URTIs and LRTIs that were also RSV-induced. High ECP levels in the nasopharyngeal secretions are predictive of the development of bronchiolitis at the time of RSV infection, and in parallel of clinical severity [201] .

PaO 2 titers were lower in children with detectable LTB 4 than in those with undetectable LTB 4 , and LTB 4 titers were inversely correlated with initial PaO 2 ,values which suggests a connection with disease severity [203] . Therefore, the damage produced by RSV at the bronchial epithelium, associated with toxic effects of basic proteins, and edema and bronchospasm triggered by LTs, could induce an airway obstruction, followed by a postinfection persistent BHR [323] . Other than BHR, bronchiolitis is dominated by activation of cellular immunity with production of Th2-like T cell ILs, clearly indicating an immune response to RSV and predictive of the development of asthma. An increased rate of CD4 + , CD25 + , and CD23 + lymphocytes was found in infants at 5 months compared with the time of bronchiolitis and with healthy subjects of the same age.

In 83 children followed-up to the age of 8 [313, 314, 320] , the risk of atopic children developing asthma or BHR during their school age was significantly related to recurring wheezing that appeared in the 1st year of life and to a premature IgE increase [314] compared to controls.At age 19 wheezing in early childhood was a significant predictor of asthma, and also seemed to predict PFT abnormalities in early adulthood. Thus, although the outcome of children with early wheezing is good at school age they may become symptomatic again as adults [495] .

Persis-tent wheezing is more commonly seen in children with asthmatic parents who have significant LRTIs with RSV [616] . The three groups can be further reduced to two: one with a viral infection and one with an atopic disease, probably aggravated by the infection [547] . Measuring specific Raw (sRaw), 200 children who wheezed at least once during first 3 years of life had significantly higher sRaw than the 303 who had never wheezed in the first 3 years of life, who had significantly higher sRaw if they were atopic or were at high genetic risk of atopy.

The first begins 20-30 min after allergen exposure and essentially consists of a bronchospasm, a clinical consequence of metachromatic cell degranulation; the airway caliber generally returns to normal within 2 h. The second stage reaches its maximum intensity about 6 h after the provoking event, coincident with the eosinophil inflammatory response in the airways. The third stage, which can last up to 3 weeks, is sustained by the intense inflammatory response induced by mediator release and progressive recruiting of [383, 723] . and often the diagnosis is not clear. The early recognition of premonitory signs (Table 11 .31) [25] before wheezing is perceptible can be finalized by an often resolutive immediate therapy. The hallmark is wheezing during expiration provoked by air rushing through larger but narrowed airways in sufficient force to generate air vibration, heard as a whistling sound associated with breathing. Additional symptoms are a feeling of a tight chest and a hacking, recurrent cough, especially at night, which can also be the only symptom. After the age of 1 year, the bronchospastic component predominates in acute attacks, which are rapidly reversible. The hypersecretion component dominates in chronic asthma and in more prolonged, severe attacks that are less responsive to therapy with bronchodilators (status asthmaticus). In addition to respiratory dyspnea, children often complain of abdominal pain, or headache, or a general sense of feeling unwell as the first subjective signs. Abdominal pain, particularly in younger children, is secondary to the use of abdominal muscles and of diaphragm. The dry, irritable, nonproductive cough of the first stages is often accompanied by a feeling of anxiety and is found together with tachypnea and tachycardia. The child is almost recumbent in bed, has difficulty in walking and talking, generally adopts particular postures to facilitate breathing, for example, sitting in a rigid position or leaning forward, to better use the auxiliary respiratory muscles. Wheezing may be a late symptom. It results from air being exchanged through partially obstructed airways and occurs in the larger airways where airflow is turbulent. The small airways do not produce wheezing since the airflow is laminar rather than turbulent. Consequently, marked small airway obstruction may be unrecognized on auscultation [481] .

As a consequence, >70% of asthma hospitalizations could be cared for in alternative settings with supplemental O 2 , nebulized medication treatments, and close nursing observation [392] . Depending on symptom relevance (mild, moderate or severe), various drugs or combinations of drugs in sequence can be used. Diagnostic tests, if convenient, with the aid of a respiratory score, can evaluate the necessity for recovery: a score of 0-4 is reassuring, in that an immediate danger of respiratory failure can be excluded; it must, however, be monitored at regular intervals. With scores >5, admittance to hospital could be unavoidable [174] . Because of RR variability, it is recommended that it be measured as described below, as well as pulsus paradoxus: if the score is >20%, a serious airway obstruction is present. If the child is old enough or can collaborate, the reduction in pulmonary volumes and flows can be measured (spirometry, PEFR) [437] . These findings, if possible, should be obtained at once, then at 30-to 60-min intervals, which must be reduced to 15-30 min if the child does not respond to treatment [268] . If spirometry cannot be carried out, even because of the severity of the child's conditions, ascertain PaO 2 (Table 6 .25) and PaCO 2 by measuring arterial blood gas level.

A note to explain the rational behind the use of theophylline in severe, life-threatening cases, above all in children [615] who, for anatomical reasons, experience bronchoconstriction more than bronchial obstruction. Inhaled b 2 -adrenergics may not reach the inflamed bronchus because of severe bronchospasm, not because of bronchus failure to dilate. On the contrary, the theophylline reaches it systemically, performing anti-inflammatory effects (Tables 11.17, 11.18) and producing a diffuse bronchodilation that reaches the bronchi obstructed by edema and mucus [393] . At this point, b 2 -adrenergics, inhaled or nebulized, can take advantage of the opening and reach the terminal airways to the point of inducing a therapeutic effect. Table 11 .48 [332, 536] compares the use made in 1988 of various drugs in 118 pediatric EDs in the US, compared to data 6 years later [332] , to evaluate the effect of 1991 guidelines [435] . It should be noted that the great use made in the US of epinephrine and the marked increase in albuterol (first choice in 95% of cases) and CS use, whose route of administration is not specified. In a survey of 376 directors of ED settings, 80% reported the use of inhaled b-agonists as the initial treatment. Only 44.7% \u00b12.9% reported the use of steroids if there was a poor response to the initial treatment [121] . Also, in 125 children nebulized b 2 -adrenergics in ICU and at home were used in 100% of the cases (Table 11 .49) [615] . A subsequent survey of 348 ED directors confirmed the high preference for inhaled b 2 -adrenergics (96.5%), significantly more public (24.6%) and community hospitals (17.1%) than pediatric EDs (3.5%) reported the use of SC epinephrine as the first medication, compared to steroids (18.1%) as a routine part of the treatment [121] . However, North American authors have shown that epinephrine is comparable to inhaled b 2 -adrenergics for its rapidity of action, effectiveness and duration of effect [537] . Also notable is how much easier and more practical it is to use epinephrine in the doctor's office, at the child's home or in a busy ED [536, 750] , especially if auto-injectable (Chap. 20). It has been noted that if a visit to the ED is followed by treatment with albuterol every 30 min for 4 h, and by giving prescriptions to continue treatment at home, after 4 h 43% of children are released, rising to 61% if a dose of oral prednisolone is added [116] . Also in asthmatics with acute forms and admitted to ED and hospitalized, relapses are reduced by 50% and nocturnal disturbance by 75%, if referral to an asthma specialist is facilitated and treatment continued thereafter, compared to patients treated by a family doctor [750] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 140, "text": "[607]", "ref_id": "BIBREF591"}, {"start": 363, "end": 368, "text": "[683]", "ref_id": "BIBREF666"}, {"start": 490, "end": 495, "text": "[615]", "ref_id": "BIBREF599"}, {"start": 938, "end": 943, "text": "[393]", "ref_id": "BIBREF396"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1131, "text": "[332,", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1136, "text": "536]", "ref_id": "BIBREF518"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1252, "text": "[332]", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1302, "text": "[435]", "ref_id": "BIBREF457"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1720, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1842, "text": "[615]", "ref_id": "BIBREF599"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2174, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2349, "text": "[537]", "ref_id": "BIBREF519"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2493, "text": "[536,", "ref_id": "BIBREF518"}, {"start": 2494, "end": 2498, "text": "750]", "ref_id": "BIBREF762"}, {"start": 2802, "end": 2807, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3085, "text": "[750]", "ref_id": "BIBREF762"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1113, "end": 1121, "text": "Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1831, "text": "(Table 11", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Assess severity"}, {"text": "The effectiveness of treatment in subjects with status asthmaticus is such that on the 3rd day of hospital treat-however, with progressive respiratory failure.

Kelly et al administered terbutaline to children 4.5-14 years old, nebulized continuously in doses of 0.4 mg/kg for an average of 9.4 h, for up to 24 h [288] . Current guidelines [434] [435] [436] suggest starting with an albuterol dose of 0.15 mg/kg (minimum of 2.5 mg, maximum of 5 mg) per nebulizer treatment for all age groups. For infants <6 months, half the dose (1.25) can be used if 2.5 mg provoke unacceptable tachycardia. During the first hour of wheezing, 3-4 albuterol nebulizer treatments are given every 15-20 min. If there is an inadequate response to treatment, the child is placed on continuous nebulization. Others have shown that doses of 0.15 mg/kg of albuterol repeated every 20-30 min are better than doses of 0.05 mg/kg and both have no side effects, and that children (under careful surveillance) respond more promptly to higher doses [564] . High doses of albuterol, especially in very young infants, are devoid of side effects and can be justified by above-mentioned studies [488] .

Drugs prescribed at discharge were bronchodilators (95.3%), CSs increasing with age group, and theophylline (21%-34%) [121] . Having achieved remission, the therapeutic strategy continues the drug regimen for at least 3-4 weeks, during which the family pediatrician will check the clinical progress by means of twice daily measurements of PEFR and sending the child to a center for infantile respiratory physiopathology for necessary PFT follow-up [164] . The month-long interval can be usefully spent establishing how the problems related to environmental and pharmaceutical prophylaxis will be managed, and in informing both the child and family how to handle the situation [434] , also to work on a plan of action for frequent asthma, which is dealt with in the next section.

The problems most frequently met with are represented by asthmatic attacks, by severe forms and by the day-by-day or maintenance treatment.

Usually, chronic asthma is related to children affected with asthma in the first few years of life, but the disease assumes its maximal severity after the age of 5 years. At recruitment the children with severe asthma totaled 8 (11%), but at age 42 the people with severe asthma totaled 33 (47%) with reduced lung function [264] . Generally, the symptoms appear early without an allergic nature being promptly identified, nor proper treatment started. Often, a careful study leads to the discovery of a variety of allergic diseases, for example AR, frequently complicated by sinusitis. It is therefore necessary to ascertain its presence, especially in children affected with chronic asthma. Usually frequent symptoms without perceptible periods of well-being are observed, given that bronchoconstriction and effort-induced dyspnea are constantly present, in practice children learn to live with asthma. This form, whose prevalence is 4%-5%, often induces invalidating symptoms, which can be summarized as follows: persistent bronchoconstriction, almost daily symptoms, frequent night-time coughing and limited physical activity [476] . In 37 randomly recruited children with chronic asthma compared to 37 controls with episodic asthma, we noted significant early onset of symptoms, delayed diagnosis, and poorer spirometry results, in addition to a positive personal or FHA, as always a potent determinant of atopy. Especially significant was the greater number of children sensitized to multiple aeroallergens. A strong influence of environmental factors on the development of severe asthma is demonstrated by the significant prevalence of maternal smoke during pregnancy, parental smoke, damp houses, and viral infections. Among the drugs available, we have four possible options: cromones, b 2 -adrenergics (even with a long halflife), ICSs, and theophylline in drops or the long-acting type from 2-3 years of age onwards. Chronic asthma is subdivided into three types, according to whether symptoms are mildly persistent, moderately persistent or severely persistent, each subclass being present in 60, 30 and <10% of cases, respectively [476] . The intermittent form [436] , which could be defined as the transitory form between acute and chronic asthma, is considered to belong to the mild forms, to be treated only as needed [437] , with four stages: mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent and severe [437] . It should be noted that NIH guidelines (Expert Panel Report 2) tabulate treatment as follows: firstline therapy may begin first with ICSs (low dose), then with cromolyn, or nedocromil as preferred therapy, or alternatively with sustained-release theophylline, or an anti-LT [437], or GINA (global initiative for asthma) guidelines introduce a daily base treatment with CSs, adding cromones only for mild forms and using b 2 -adrenergics as symptomatic (rescue) drugs [436] . The Expert Panel Report 2002 believes that a diagnostic trial of inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory medications may be helpful; however, infants consistently requiring symptomatic treatment more than twice a week should be given daily long-term-control therapy, and ICSs should be the preferred treatment [434] . These guidelines have not been confirmed by three longitudinal studies [210, 465, 575] , and the Melbourne 37-year longitudinal study in asthmatic children followed up to adulthood show no differences between those who did and those who did not take steroids [210] , nor has the proposal to introduce CS use from the onset of the infantile asthma been validated, not even in the mild forms [465] . The PFT impairment in the group with persistent asthma was greater in those with persistent BHR and in those treated with ICSs [575] . Cromones and/or theophylline are important for reducing CS doses [437, 566] . Nor are GINA guidelines productive, since a retrospective study of 175 children followed on average for 8.4 years concluded that, contrary to what the guidelines suggested, starting treatment with cromones and not with CSs improves the outcome, while in the mild-moderate forms positive effects are obtained with bronchodilators [311] . Without doubt, further prospective studies are needed. For our part, we have seen the positive results of early treatment with cromones, in agreement with the 3rd Consensus for infantile asthma [700] . One of the tasks of a pediatrician is to strive for a better compliance and quality of life for asthmatic children. There are often reasons for noncompliance to long-term medications when these are numerous, including in adolescence the fear of CS side-effects, a poor understanding of treatment, and a wish to be like one's peers [158] . To our knowledge, one proposition consists of simplifying the treatment program by reducing the frequency of drug administration from twice daily, as usually recommended, to once daily. However, if efficacy is preserved, can prophylactic asthma treatment be prescribed once daily for each drug and for each child, whatever the age, the device and the asthma severity [158] ?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 501, "end": 506, "text": "[264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1312, "text": "[476]", "ref_id": "BIBREF477"}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2326, "text": "[476]", "ref_id": "BIBREF477"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2356, "text": "[436]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2516, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2609, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3079, "end": 3084, "text": "[436]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3403, "end": 3408, "text": "[434]", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}, {"start": 3482, "end": 3487, "text": "[210,", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 3488, "end": 3492, "text": "465,", "ref_id": "BIBREF450"}, {"start": 3493, "end": 3497, "text": "575]", "ref_id": "BIBREF577"}, {"start": 3670, "end": 3675, "text": "[210]", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 3801, "end": 3806, "text": "[465]", "ref_id": "BIBREF450"}, {"start": 3936, "end": 3941, "text": "[575]", "ref_id": "BIBREF577"}, {"start": 4009, "end": 4014, "text": "[437,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4015, "end": 4019, "text": "566]", "ref_id": "BIBREF568"}, {"start": 4351, "end": 4356, "text": "[311]", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 4553, "end": 4558, "text": "[700]", "ref_id": "BIBREF702"}, {"start": 4892, "end": 4897, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 5267, "end": 5272, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Chronic Asthma"}, {"text": "Normally, PFT basic anomalies are absent in mild persistent asthma (Fig. 11.56 ) [435-437, 699, 700] .

If cromones have no effect within 4-8 weeks, the use of ICSs, which have a good anti-inflammatory action, can be started. We have treated with inhaled BUD (200 mg/day) 74 children aged 3.5-5.9 years (mean 4.2 years) and affected by moderate to severe asthma, despite conventional therapy, compared to 71 controls of similar age range and treated with antihistamines. The primary outcome measure was the change in asthma severity, as measured by the mean asthma score during the last 2 weeks of a baseline period and the last 2 weeks of each treatment. The mean difference in asthma score between BUD and antihistamines was: -7.5; 95% CI, -11.70 to -3.29 (p<0.0001). Spirometric data demonstrated a significant improvement. ICSs are suitable for it decreases by 10%-20% [273] . During symptomatic periods, children should be treated with nebulized b 2 -adrenergics (Table 11 .16), every 4-6 h prn for the duration of the episode, until PEF is stabilized or there is a clear and constant improvement [566] . In children <5 years of age, PEF measurements can be substituted by clinical parameters, such as coughing and dyspnea, while in children >5 years of age, starting a continuous PEF monitoring period at home to evaluate the severity of asthma is suggested [699] . The choice of drugs is less difficult, since response to b 2 -agonists is often variable in young infants, provided they are used correctly [26] . Inhaled b 2 -adrenergics can be used prn if control of symptoms can be coupled with a normal level of activity, absence of nocturnal coughing and PEF stabilization, [697] . If, on the other hand, the condition progressively worsens and b 2 -agonists are taken more than twice a week, reaching the point of daily intake dosages or 3-4 times/day, long-acting theophylline or cromones can be introduced.

The pharmacological choices summarized in Table 11 .50 [335, 698, 699] can be recommended, according to age and symptoms. Table 11 .51 focuses on the difficulties that can be encountered in the treatment of the very young [472] . preferred, such as flunisolide = h 1.6\u00b10.35 and BUD = h 2.8\u00b11.1, compared to the 15 h of BDP [633] , tapered to the lowest effective single regimen (which provides the same results as that of dividing the administration into four doses) [497] taken on alternate days in the early afternoon (3:00-5:30 PM) [378, 497] to wean to the least undesirable effects, chief among which is that of inhibiting the HPA axis [198, 633] . The ICS dose should be gradually stepped down to the lowest possible doses of medication required to maintain asthma control and perhaps discontinued if a child remains asymptomatic for more than 1-2 months [198, 290, 418, 566, 634] . By following this guide, danger of the baby or child encountering any sort of problem can be avoided; most of the symptomatic benefit obtainable from ICSs occurs by reducing doses of BUD to 100-200 mg/day, with little effect from dose increments [487] . Such lines have been confirmed in a 4-month pediatric trial, which evaluated many varied parameters: BDP achieved the best clinical results, but associated with albuterol and theophylline proved to be most effective in reducing asthma attacks, and in 10 out of 16 parameters that evaluated the most frequent adverse reactions, it registered the smallest rate (albuterol + theophylline the greatest), including the [485, 566, [698] [699] [700] \u2211 In babies and infants up to 1 year of age ( Fig. 11.59) , it is unnecessary to treat mild and infrequent symptoms, especially if there is no interference with daily life, night-time sleep and behavior. Often the infant whistles as a result of the greater elasticity of the bronchial tree or for intercurrent VRIs, thus rendering CS use difficult [620] . If the child is well and growing normally, only follow-ups are necessary. If symptoms intensify, even if infants show little therapeutic response to b 2 -adrenergics, treatment with spacers/nebulizer and face mask is called for, with recourse to cromones or to theophylline if the desired effect is not achieved. If the condition de-teriorates, intervention with IB and/or CS by nebulizers and/or with epinephrine, and O 2 therapy in emergencies is suggested. \u2211 In children 1-3 years of age ( Fig. 11 .60), inhaled drugs must be administered by nebulizer and face mask. If symptoms are mild, satisfactory results can be obtained with b 2 -adrenergic and/or theophylline. If attacks should become of moderate intensity, with persistent wheezing and coughing, the use of associated cromolyn/nedocromil sodium is advised, making use of CSs in the case of a further deterioration of the symptoms, always by nebulizer and face mask and orally in the minimum effective dose, on alternating days in single-doses. \u2211 In children 3-5 years of age (Fig. 11 .61) and with mild asthma, b 2 -adrenergics may be useful. If coughing and wheezing persist and inhaled bronchodilators fail to elicit a significant improvement, prophylactic treatment with cromolyn/nedocromil sodium or, alternatively, theophylline is called for. The combined use of b 2adrenergics and MDI + spacer CSs should be reserved for when symptoms become acute again. A further worsening will require a CS treatment in the forms indicated, such as inhaled BUD at a total dose of 800 mg daily, which significantly improved symptom scores, asthma exacerbation rates, PFTs, and BHR in asthmatic children aged 2-5 years [440] . Anti-LT medications should be introduced as symptoms step up. \u2211 In the age range from 5 to 18 years (Fig. 11.62) , the differences separating cases of mild and medium/moderate asthma should be observed, alternating or combining the drugs and modifying the routes of administration. As can be seen in the figure, if asthma is severe and persistent, recourse to CS use is necessary. Asthma improves only in 41.3%-47.5% of cases (Table 5 .15) (the earlier the age of onset, the greater the risk of relapses) [575] , so in most adolescents who are not SIT-treated, delivery of medical care may also be challenging [476] .

Children depend on taking part in sporting activities for correct mental, social and physical development. Parents, often easily troubled by the parallel between exercise and the onset of an attack, often constrain their children to limit, or even stop, these activities, forcing them to adopt a sedentary and solitary life, with negative repercussions. It is therefore indispensable that parents be instructed on the significance of and how EIA can occur, since EIA worsens the prognosis of asthma [214] . The cornerstone on which diagnosis relies is history. Typical EIA appears in asthmatic children, but it may also become clinically manifest with exercise in children experiencing a subclinical degree of obstruction [214] . EIA diagnosis was possible in 88 children of 12.4\u00b13.2 years by employing a treadmill test in which the speed was gradually increased, with positive results in 73%; 35 of 36 boys complained of pain and dyspnea, but not of wheezing, entirely reduced after albuterol inhalation [720] . Significantly, without these tests, 64% of those affected [542] and, often, also 40% of children complaining of thoracic pains [720] remain undiagnosed. Correct identification therefore is essential. Sporting activity must represent in an asthmatic infant or child -as it does in a healthy one -an appreciable part of life, and the child should be made aware of his or her virtual competitiveness even with healthy subjects [214] . EIA can be effectively pre- action lasting 6.5 h in reducing 50% of symptoms, while albuterol in doses of 200 mg lasts for 1.5 h. Using halved doses, albuterol was shown to be equal to formoterol [247] ; therefore effectiveness is linked to a dose of 100 mg/puff. Salmeterol has a lasting action of 12 h [343] and bambuterol even more [159] . Long-acting theophylline administered to 12-year-old asthmatics 2 h before the challenge prevented both IAR and LAR (8 h), thereby covering an ample time period [270] . Among CSs, BUD is indicated in modest doses; 53% of the maximal effect is reported in children with doses of 200 mg/day, and 83% with doses of 400 mg/day, registering significant differences with 100 mg/day [487] , and parallel results with doses of 400 mg/day [216] . Often, children forget preventative medical measures or are reluctant to be seen while they are taking the medication. In such cases, oral bambuterol [158] , salmeterol [343] , formoterol [441] and theophylline [270] , anti-LTs [482] , vented both by warming up, as well as by inhalations of b 2 -adrenergics about 5 min, or cromones about 15-20 min before beginning the activity [476] . This has proved effective in 70% of cases [39] . Studies in children have yielded significant results: after administration of cromolyn/nedocromil sodium, 10 or 4 mg, respectively, with MDI [113, 134, 451] , there was a significant lowering of FEV 1 compared to basic tests [134, 451] . Cromolyn remained effective for up to 4 h and procaterol up to 8 h after the test, though with reduced effect [419, 450] . b 2 -adrenergics are preferred due to the better clinical results obtained as well as to their duration of action. Despite recognized shortcomings in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma, cromones are preferred for limited or zero incidence of adverse effects [603] . In more resistant cases, b 2 -adrenergics can be associated with cromones: both offer equal protection to children after only 30 min. Formoterol in doses of 9-12 mg has an 831 Treatment Fig. 11.61 .

As an alternative, the following measures are suggested: \u2211 Before beginning whatever form of activity, choose a warm, humid environment: free running in cold and dry ambient air causes much greater bronchoconstriction than swimming [214] . \u2211 Nasal respiration is preferred because, as noted, it humidifies the inhaled air and reduces the cooling effect on the airways. \u2211 Do a gradual warming up exercise almost to the point of provoking a bronchospasm, thus delaying an asthmatic attack about 2-3 h. \u2211 Alternatively, wear a mask with a filter that retains heat and humidity and that has proved to be effective [618] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 296, "text": "[446]", "ref_id": "BIBREF466"}, {"start": 935, "end": 940, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1163, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1446, "text": "[720]", "ref_id": "BIBREF722"}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1512, "text": "[542]", "ref_id": "BIBREF524"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1581, "text": "[720]", "ref_id": "BIBREF722"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1878, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2082, "text": "[247]", "ref_id": "BIBREF250"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2190, "text": "[343]", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 2216, "end": 2221, "text": "[159]", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2390, "text": "[270]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 2600, "end": 2605, "text": "[487]", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 2654, "end": 2659, "text": "[216]", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 2812, "end": 2817, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2836, "text": "[343]", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 2850, "end": 2855, "text": "[441]", "ref_id": "BIBREF461"}, {"start": 2873, "end": 2878, "text": "[270]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 2890, "end": 2895, "text": "[482]", "ref_id": "BIBREF484"}, {"start": 3042, "end": 3047, "text": "[476]", "ref_id": "BIBREF477"}, {"start": 3092, "end": 3096, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3240, "end": 3245, "text": "[113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 3246, "end": 3250, "text": "134,", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 3251, "end": 3255, "text": "451]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 3324, "end": 3329, "text": "[134,", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 3330, "end": 3334, "text": "451]", "ref_id": "BIBREF436"}, {"start": 3447, "end": 3452, "text": "[419,", "ref_id": "BIBREF422"}, {"start": 3453, "end": 3457, "text": "450]", "ref_id": "BIBREF470"}, {"start": 3726, "end": 3731, "text": "[603]", "ref_id": "BIBREF587"}, {"start": 4349, "end": 4364, "text": "[566, 698-700])", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4402, "end": 4407, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 4652, "end": 4657, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 5030, "end": 5035, "text": "[618]", "ref_id": "BIBREF602"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3920, "end": 3930, "text": "Fig. 11.61", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Exercise-Induced Asthma"}, {"text": "Usually, the pharmacological pretreatment is followed by a warm-up period of 10 min requiring light effort.

Commonly, asthmatic children seem to be unwilling to take part in sports, but this presumed inaction toward sports in general is often caused by the limitations imposed by the EIA of which they suffer [617] . As for athletes in all branches from sport, including those taking part in athletic competitions, EIA is not a contraindication for children. Not all children are natural sportsmen, but all children should have a chance to share sporting with companions. Usually limitations imposed by asthma on daily childhood activities are not recognized until the child begins to participate, and then gains interest in physical activity [617] . In addition to pretreatment, children should avoid activities in asthma and circadian reductions in histamine concentrations is cited as evidence of a so-called permissive effect on mast cell histamine release, a mechanism that could explain the asthmatic attacks recurring over several consecutive nights following a single exposure to provoking allergens [32] . The relationship between nocturnal asthma severity and PFT during the daytime is still the subject of study, in that as yet no conclusive results are available. A controlled study in children has confirmed that nocturnal asthma is not dependent on an increase in bronchoconstriction [665] . Concerning treatment, the drugs used for daytime treatments, especially inhaled bronchodilators, do not last long enough to cover the night-time as well [364] . In these patients, a dose of long-acting theophylline at the time of sleeping is generally effective [83, 760] . On the basis of previous analysis on theophylline and circadian rhythms, a treatment with equal doses at regular intervals will be able to increase theophylline serum levels at night compared to daytime levels [760] . The persistence of nocturnal symptoms may indicate the necessity of including an anti-inflammatory treatment [379] . This option generally seems to be unnecessary since at precisely 4:00 AM the drug blocks the flow of inflammatory cells in BALF, an effect mediated by LTB 4 [316] . If theophylline, and inhaled b 2 -adrenergics and steroids taken as late as possible do not control night-time symptoms, it will be necessary to resort to the usual therapy for day-time asthma. In children, slow-release terbutoline is more effective than inhaled b 2 -agonists in preventing nocturnal asthma [398] , while ICSs are more effective and less harmful if taken between 3:00 and 5:30 PM, as noted above. A pre-eminent position might be held by formoterol [183] , salmeterol, bambuterol [159] , and long-acting antihistamines may ensure overall night-time symptom reduction, which of course do not offer the anti-inflammatory potency of theophylline [760] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 272, "text": "[617]", "ref_id": "BIBREF601"}, {"start": 701, "end": 706, "text": "[617]", "ref_id": "BIBREF601"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1070, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1361, "text": "[665]", "ref_id": "BIBREF686"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1522, "text": "[364]", "ref_id": "BIBREF387"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1630, "text": "[83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1635, "text": "760]", "ref_id": "BIBREF752"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1853, "text": "[760]", "ref_id": "BIBREF752"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1970, "text": "[379]", "ref_id": "BIBREF363"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2135, "text": "[316]", "ref_id": "BIBREF319"}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2451, "text": "[398]", "ref_id": "BIBREF401"}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2608, "text": "[183]", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 2634, "end": 2639, "text": "[159]", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 2797, "end": 2802, "text": "[760]", "ref_id": "BIBREF752"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Exercise-Induced Asthma"}, {"text": "Differential Diagnosis.

The influence of environmental factors also relies on the threshold of bronchial reactivity in hyperreactive subjects that is further reduced at night, not related to airway obstructions, but to fluctuations of circadian rhythms [380] . In some cases, the possible association with GER, often occurring during night-time because of the lack of opposition places with excessive air pollution and/or high concentrations of allergens; if all conditions are optimal, warmup exercises can begin [419] . Swimming, ball games, relay races and dancing are examples of useful activities in the training and rehabilitation of children and adolescents with EIA. We suggest that asthmatic children and adolescents be helped to participate with others in the most suitable sports (in asthmogenic ascending order): swimming, water polo, canoeing, long-distance skiing, volleyball, free dance, speed walking, baseball, basketball, etc. When treatment does not control the problem, then further diagnostic evaluation should be done to rule out conditions other than EIA, and all children with cough, shortness of breath, or history of recurrent bronchitis should be followed to make sure that the correct diagnosis is made and to make sure that treatment is effective [482] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 241, "text": "[626]", "ref_id": "BIBREF628"}, {"start": 646, "end": 651, "text": "[380]", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 907, "end": 912, "text": "[419]", "ref_id": "BIBREF422"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1674, "text": "[482]", "ref_id": "BIBREF484"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Exercise-Induced Asthma"}, {"text": "Cough is the distinctive characteristic of asthma and nocturnal symptoms may be so dominant and bothersome as to disrupt the sleep of both the child and family. Much has been written on the condition, but a significant trend was found with more nights awakened in the past 4 weeks and with reduction in the quantity and quality of sleep and daytime sequelae of nocturnal asthma, including missing school, educational problems, and parents missing work or other usual activities [147] . Nocturnal cough generally reflects PEFR diurnal variations. Usually, examining at what time the episodes occurred, it can be seen that they do not always coincide with PEFR minimum level. Cough is more frequent about 2 h after the child goes to bed, and then again before awakening in the morning, and not between 3:00 and 5:00 AM when PEFR is lowest, reaching its nadir around 4:00 AM [32] . BALF studies in adults with nocturnal asthma have shown an extraordinary correlation: at 4:00 AM, BALF was found to contain a significantly greater number of lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and epithelial cell than at 4:00 PM [379] . This data shows that BHR is greatest at 4:00 AM compared to the corresponding afternoon hour, in correlation with FEV 1 and PC 20 equivalent variations [380] . Such are the effects of circadian rhythms, linked to the hypothalamic clock, which is linked in turn to the solar clock, with night and day alternation, which is why night-shift workers register the best test scores during nocturnal hours [32] . Another potential factor is the nocturnal body cooling independent of ambient T, correlated with clinical evidence that small reductions of body T provoke cold-induced bronchoconstriction [378] . Relative to allergen influx on circadian rhythms, it has been noted that exposing mild asthmatics without nocturnal asthma to an allergenic burden, they all responded with IAR both in the daytime and night-time, but also showed LAR after the evening test [364] . The connection existing between nocturnal by gravitational forces and, by means of a reflexive obstructive mechanism stimulated by gastric juices, could also be critical [221] . Furthermore, GER could increase bronchoconstriction by activating a vagal reflex (see \"Collateral Pathologies\"), but the links with nocturnal asthma are not yet clear [398] , also because of a lack of precise correlation between esophagus acidity and altered respiratory function [170] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 478, "end": 483, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1116, "text": "[379]", "ref_id": "BIBREF363"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1276, "text": "[380]", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1522, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1718, "text": "[378]", "ref_id": "BIBREF362"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1981, "text": "[364]", "ref_id": "BIBREF387"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2159, "text": "[221]", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2334, "text": "[398]", "ref_id": "BIBREF401"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2447, "text": "[170]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nocturnal Asthma"}, {"text": "A general summary of the many causes of persistent coughing is given in Table 11 .36.

Symptomatic or functional GER therapy also appears to be necessary for the possible complications related to nocturnal asthma. The basic principles are: 1.

The only exception is an 18-month-old girl who also had subcutaneous emphysema [211] . Paroxysmal cough and bronchospasm superimposed on hyperinflation, or related to atelectasis, pneumonia, structural weakness, intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB), cause air to rupture alveolar bases and spread along vascular sheaths, consequently causing pulmonary interstitial emphysema. This may lead to severe cardiovascular insufficiency with reduced venous return, cardiac output and blood pressure [41] . If the air makes its way to the mediastinum and reaches the pericardium, one has auscultatory findings of a crackling sound synchronized with heart beats (Hamman's sign), pathognomonic of pneumopericardium. In other cases, air, through the fascial planes, may escape into the subcutaneous tissue of neck, shoulders and axillae, releasing the mediastinal pressure [41] .

Another possible complication is vasopressin excessive production (inappropriate ADH secretion): such levels are high in patients with severe asthma, independent of natremia, probably as a result of the effect of severe asthma on pulmonary circulation. Vasopressin levels fall parallel to patient improvement.

Starting in the 1960s, a few English authors noted a sudden increase in the mortality rate among asthmatics, attributing the cause to the b-adrenergic isoproterenol, the use of which was discontinued though the doubts had not been clearly proved [479] . The pharmaceutical industry introduced new b 2 -adrenergics on the market, but in the 1970s, other scientists from New Zealand spoke out against the most widely diffused of these: fenoterol. These authors said that the problem was not due to the drug's direct toxic effect, but rather to its abuse because it provided immediate relief [326] . Both isoproterenol and fenoterol are relatively nonselective potent full agonists with both greater long-term and immediate adverse effects than other b-agonists. Likely the regular use of these agonists led to worsening asthma control and their overuse to treat life-threatening asthma attacks caused an increased risk of death resulting from adverse cardiac effects in the presence of severe hypoxia [569] . In the US, high-dose fenoterol and isoproterenol were not approved for use. In effect, after the ban on the drug, the mortality rate among 5-to 34-year-olds fell from four to <1 case/10 6 [480] . Consequently, albuterol was given preference as it was less dangerous according to New Zealand scientists [738] since fenoterol prescription was associated with an increased risk of death compared to albuterol [608] . We have prescribed albuterol without noting adverse effects and a case-control study recognizes that such alarm was unjustified [738] . Recent studies have instead documented that mortality rates decreased, while sales of ICSs increased [628, 630] , as well as of b 2 -adrenergics [331] . Some ecological studies conducted in various countries state that the introduction and sharp increases in the use of ICSs correlate to important reductions in the asthma death rates, whereas other cohort or case-control studies indicate that ICSs might not prevent asthma death [628] .

After a gradual decline in asthma mortality rates in the 1960s and 1970s, rates have increased progressively in the US during the past 2 decades.

This assumption is based on the fact that asthma is a very common disease, implies a substantial impairment in children's quality of life and requires challenging medical interventions and treatments often accepted by children reluctantly [375] . Moreover, the deeper understanding of asthma by patients, along with the undeniable positive aspects can, in some cases, give way to a loss of the doctor-patient relationship, which on the contrary is indispensable [67] . Among other frequent disadvantages of self-management is the improper use of some drugs, particularly b 2 -adrenergics [569] . Continuous drug dependency occurs, which is reflected negatively on the quality of life and involves a condition of undertreatment, since the patient does not use, or misuses, those drugs that are needed in his or her case [478] . Chronic underuse is also attributable to a false feeling of safety occasioned by masking the effects that systematic use of medications has on symptoms [109] . Thus, on the one hand a masking or an underestimation of the underlying inflammatory process can occur, so that when a sudden emergency materializes, the use of ICSs and/or cromones is delayed [67, 375] ; on the other hand, the rapid beneficial effects on clinical features prevents the patient from realizing that hypoxia worsens [296] , dangerously postponing a doctor's visit. Undertreatment increases death cases, since the moderate reduction in mortality is related to the progressive increase of ICS sales [596, 628, 630] . It is recommended to closely follow subjects who have experienced fatal crises or near-fatal attacks [326] . [192] . [377], to the point that the prescribed drug serum levels are between 0 and subtherapeutic levels [43] . This is especially alarming when these drugs are ICSs: their regular, uninterrupted use significantly reduces the risk of death from asthma by at least 50%. Instead, treatment interruption is associated with an almost fivefold increase in asthma deaths [630] , likely because the CS effect disappears after 2 weeks [593] . \u2211 Young patients under proper observation, who are faced with sudden attacks, progressively becoming worse to the point of respiratory insufficiency and death within 20 min to 3 h [190] , probably because of the effect of a heavy allergenic load or the intervention of other highly negative factors, but who did not avail of help quickly enough [409] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 13, "end": 17, "text": "[80,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 18, "end": 22, "text": "145]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 33, "end": 37, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 38, "end": 42, "text": "403,", "ref_id": "BIBREF406"}, {"start": 43, "end": 47, "text": "579,", "ref_id": "BIBREF581"}, {"start": 48, "end": 52, "text": "623]", "ref_id": "BIBREF607"}, {"start": 179, "end": 184, "text": "[623]", "ref_id": "BIBREF607"}, {"start": 426, "end": 431, "text": "[375]", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}, {"start": 649, "end": 653, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 775, "end": 780, "text": "[569]", "ref_id": "BIBREF571"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1011, "text": "[478]", "ref_id": "BIBREF479"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1171, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1371, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1376, "text": "375]", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1510, "text": "[296]", "ref_id": "BIBREF278"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1691, "text": "[596,", "ref_id": "BIBREF620"}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1696, "text": "628,", "ref_id": "BIBREF630"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1701, "text": "630]", "ref_id": "BIBREF632"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1810, "text": "[326]", "ref_id": "BIBREF329"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1818, "text": "[192]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1923, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2184, "text": "[630]", "ref_id": "BIBREF632"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2246, "text": "[593]", "ref_id": "BIBREF617"}, {"start": 2429, "end": 2434, "text": "[190]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 2594, "end": 2599, "text": "[409]", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Examination of Possible Causes"}, {"text": "It happens, however, that children and/or adolescents do not fall into this classification and die as a result of insufficient management of asthma [623] , or for excessive delays in the final moments [190] ; 80% of the cases studied were preventable.

Death by asthma can be sudden or progressive: in the first instance, the preponderant role of an intense bronchospasm is suspected, as it has been ascertained that recovery from a near-fatal attack occurs more quickly in these forms than in those that evolve more slowly, characterized by respiratory insufficiency following generalized bronchoconstriction and long-term inflammatory phenomena [578] similar to that found in status asthmaticus. Two potentially contributing causes should not be underestimated: drug cardiotoxicity, especially if hypoxemia is present, and the onset of respiratory insufficiency, rapidly aggravated by severe hypoxia [409] .

At the end of a retrospective study on 12,301 Canadian asthmatic adults, Spitzer et al [608] declared there was a danger related to the use of bronchodilators in MDI spray cans, maintaining that all b-adrenergics, including albuterol, but also theophylline and oral steroids, worsen asthma and can be related to fatal cases, without in effect providing clear evidence related to a cause-effect relationship [109] . Cromones as well as ICSs are totally excluded from a careful analysis in this data, as is albuterol if not taken in combination with fenoterol, which was the most common drug used among the deceased [608] . Following the publication of the preliminary results, the North American press underlined the serious dangers deriving from the abuse of b 2 -adrenergics and the American College of Allergy and Immunology sent photocopies of the articles to all its associates as well as its Position Statement on the matter [185] . The dissertation by Spitzer et al [608] brought in a large number of controversial letters. The New Zealand authors exclude that in their country the use of albuterol had increased the cases of death between 1969 and 1976 [738] , which occurred when the less selective fenoterol was commercialized [571] , and therefore it is the prolonged use at high doses that is correlated with the risk of death by asthma or near-fatal asthmatic attacks [331] . The same group [629] subsequently quantified the risk in 10 5 asthmatics/year. The statistics are 42.8% for nebulized b 2 -adrenergics and 19.2% for oral b 2 -adrenergics, 44.6% for oral CSs; in direct comparison, fenoterol alone vs albuterol alone was 60.2% vs 7.4%, so the conclusion is that albuterol is safe if inhaled alone \u2211 A long period of undertreatment, or of scant medical care (64%) \u2211 Inadequate care in the final stage (45%) or delays in asking for help, or insufficient physician knowledge of emergency treatments Some families hesitate to call a doctor during weekends or at night [190] ; In fact 75% of deaths occur between 7:00 PM and 6:00 AM [375] and life-threatening attacks and deaths show a pattern of occurring on Sunday [527] . Two studies showed that 68% of Swedish children and 35% of English children died within 3 h of the onset of the attack [190, 192] . Therefore, there is an impact of unpredictability that could also be due to overlooked nonsevere cases [192] , whereas in dispatching an ambulance with a doctor on board (the person making the request had indicated asthma to the hospital operator), the arrival of help was shortened by 64% and the mortality rate decreased sixfold [595] . Survival in the period after the attack is made difficult by mistakes, for example, inadequate monitoring [377] or inadequate actions on the part of patients, especially those at high risk.

Some patients, who died suddenly of a heart attack preceded by tachycardia and extrasystoles, had in all likelihood taken drugs in excessive doses. To this end an abnormal pharmacological mechanism could be regarded as being the cause (possibly prostaglandins), triggered by an exogenous agent [578] ; such cases habitually occur at home [190] . However, postmortem examinations carried out on some children have shown equal amounts of specific cardiac lesions among those who had abused b 2 -adrenergic drugs and those treated with other drugs [595] , although probably the severity of the complications in these patients was due more to hypoxia than to cardiac factors [409] . 2. Often the abuse of inhaled drugs, such as b 2 -adrenergics [375, 569, 578] has been stressed, both because they are very handy to use as they are supplied with dispensers, and because some have a longer and more intense action and an MDI dosed at 200 mg/puff [479] , whereas, for example, the dosage of albuterol is reduced by half. 3 . The theory that the abuse of b 2 -adrenergics can lead to a masking of worsened underlying disease, whereas CS treatment could be needed [571] , is, however, contradicted by the increase in sales for both classes of these drugs [480] . 4 . Another probability is that in status asthmaticus the lack of use or underuse of CSs, if taken in a timely manner, prevents the formation of obstructive plugs [76] . In with MDI, as are inhaled cromones and CSs [629] . Abuse is dangerous because b 2 -adrenergics exacerbate BHR. Studies [110, 456] have reconfirmed that b 2 -adrenergics show tolerance with continued exposure with a loss of clinical effect that can worsen asthma. Abuse and high doses during acute attacks lead to hypoxemia and/or hypokalemia as well as a delay in seeking medical assistance [409, 410, 479] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 58, "text": "[76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 59, "end": 63, "text": "578]", "ref_id": "BIBREF580"}, {"start": 363, "end": 368, "text": "[578]", "ref_id": "BIBREF580"}, {"start": 407, "end": 412, "text": "[190]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 614, "end": 619, "text": "[595]", "ref_id": "BIBREF619"}, {"start": 740, "end": 745, "text": "[409]", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}, {"start": 810, "end": 815, "text": "[375,", "ref_id": "BIBREF359"}, {"start": 816, "end": 820, "text": "569,", "ref_id": "BIBREF571"}, {"start": 821, "end": 825, "text": "578]", "ref_id": "BIBREF580"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1015, "text": "[479]", "ref_id": "BIBREF480"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1230, "text": "[571]", "ref_id": "BIBREF573"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1321, "text": "[480]", "ref_id": "BIBREF481"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1491, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1544, "text": "[629]", "ref_id": "BIBREF631"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1620, "text": "[110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1625, "text": "456]", "ref_id": "BIBREF441"}, {"start": 1887, "end": 1892, "text": "[409,", "ref_id": "BIBREF412"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1897, "text": "410,", "ref_id": "BIBREF413"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1902, "text": "479]", "ref_id": "BIBREF480"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "How Patients Die of Asthma"}, {"text": "Therefore the use of bronchodilators is not intrinsically dangerous, but the substantial irrationality of treatment based only or mainly on b 2 -adrenergics should be pointed out; its use should be associated with regular anti-inflammatory and preventive therapy [62, 68] . The main risk in the use of fenoterol is a dose-effect ratio between mortality and prescription [30] , potentially caused by excessive basic dosages, as mentioned above. In line with such reports, on the one hand there is a recourse, as urged by some authors, to halve the dosages [612] ; on the other hand the drug has been shown to be effective in moderate forms even in dosages between 10 and 50 mg, even reduced up to 1/20 of the recommended dosage [196] . However, the adverse effects of fenoterol became known when it was compared to placebo for 6 months [571] . What criteria is used to freely commercialize b-adrenergics controlled by studies lasting barely 4 weeks [133] ? In a large sample of 16,787 patients treated for 16 weeks with salmeterol, the number of cases of death by asthma were 12 [91] , among which only one boy 14 years of age (0.006%) [197] . There were only two deaths in the group treated with albuterol, one of whom was 20 years old [197] . Therefore we do not agree with the concerns raised by the potential danger of salmeterol in young people, provided that -as with formoterol -it is not used to treat acute asthmatic attacks since it has no effect in a short time, a specification included in illustrated leaflets only in 1994. Therefore it should not be taken too often because of the risk of accumulation causing adverse effects. As a consequence, it is necessary to start preventive maintenance therapy [76] with cromolyn, nedocromil sodium, ICS or long-acting theophylline, resorting to inhaled b 2 -adrenergics prn [467] , while taking care to eliminate the environmental allergenic load [76] .

As will be seen in Chap. 24, numerous factors have contributed to the increased prevalence of allergic disease. Proof of the negative influences of these factors in children with FH+ is provided by the double reactivity in 74% of children to Der p 1 and to pets and in 84% to pollens and molds [483] . Given the severity of infantile asthma, it can be understood how important it is that interventions for allergen avoidance are scrupulously carried out, which, we note incidentally, are overlooked in several guidelines where emphasis is placed above all on drug therapy [272, 435, 504, 545, [698] [699] [700] .

However, cromolyn had a statistically significant effect on cough and wheeze compared to placebo (95% CI) and an additional decrease in cough score compared to placebo (0.13 to 0.27) and in wheeze score (0.11 to 0.26) [166, 642] .

Mold growth is accompanied by an intense type I, III and IV immune response: antigen release with production of IgE and IgG antibodies. Activation of Th2 T cells orchestrating pulmonary inflammation has also been shown in ABA together with the expression of genes for several ILs present on the 5q chromosome [95] . They are restricted by HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR5 and produce high concentrations of IL 4 but few of IFN-g [99] . ABA is characterized by five stages: I acute, II remission, III recurrent exacerbation, IV progressively ingravescent and steroid-dependent, which, if not treated, evolves into stage V, with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis [75, 95] .

The presence of precipitant antibodies, findings of fungal hyphae in the sputum and fungal isolation in cultures [95] may have diagnostic value. SPTs reveal immediate and/or delayed reactions to the molds. For the diagnosis of the condition, high levels of total IgE (>1,000 ng/ml) [369] and IgE antibodies are relevant such as the significant association with sIgE and IgGs to AF [75] (Table 11 .64) [95] .

From our examination of doctor-patient relationships the importance of the pediatrician's role emerges. This doctor must not appear to be simply one who prescribes drugs or tests, but must also fulfill the role of being a friend full of enthusiasm, encouragement and understanding, both to young patients and their families. He must also instill a responsible attitude toward the disease and bring them to an understanding that asthma that is not treated effectively can, more often than not, result in the child or adolescent growing into an invalid adult. Especially in cases such as these, pediatricians should be particularly close to children and their family. Following an asthmatic child for a long time provides an opportunity for acquiring important information on the course of disease and the physical and mental repercussions asthma can have on those involved.

On the other hand, self-treatment programs have yielded disappointing results, or are based on cycles of hospitalization and do not always achieve positive results. In other cases that we have regularly noted, treatment of children may involve their families in a better understanding of the clinical effects after giving an informative overall picture.
