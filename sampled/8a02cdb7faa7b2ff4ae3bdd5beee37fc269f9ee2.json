            "text": "Daunomycin is widely used in the treatment of leukemia as chemotherapy agent. Daunomycin is a DNA intercalator, which induce genetic damage leading to cell death. DNA is compacted into a complex structure built from the interaction of histones with DNA named nucleosomes. The structure consists of 145 base pair of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histones. There are 5 main histones: the linker histones of the H1 family and core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) which are arranged in an octamer form. Bone marrow cells are the first site for cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs. In this study, we investigated the effect of daunomycin on cytotoxicity and histone proteins of mouse bone marrow pluripotent cells. At first pluripotent bone marrow cells were separated from mature cells according to their adherence. The cells were incubated in the absence and presence of various concentrations of daunomycin for certain incubation time. The cytotoxicity was detected by MTT and the histone proteins were extracted by acid and analyzed using SDS-PAGE, western blot and flow cytometry techniques. The results revealed that upon increasing the concentration of drug, viability and extractability of the histones H1, H3 and H4 were decreased. There are differences in the quality and quantity of histones H2A and H2B in bone marrow stem cells compared to thymus histones as revealed by flow cytometry. The results suggest that the binding of daunomycin to chromatin proceeds the chromatin of bone marrow pluripotent stem cells into aggregation and beside DNA; histone proteins also play an important role in this process.",

Several evidences suggest that PXE is a metabolic disorder that may permanently modify the biosynthetic expression profile of fibroblasts. Since TNAP is the enzyme that releases phosphate from PPi, its over-expression could favour the precipitation of calcium phosphate and therefore, the ectopic calcification process. In the present study we have investigated, by real time-PCR, if epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes which could contribute to the ectopic mineralization and that are differently expressed in the healthy and PXE fibroblasts. In particular the effect of 5-Aza-2\u00a2-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, and of Tricostatine A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, has been considered. The results of these experiments show that TNAP expression is controlled by these epigenetic modifications. P01.7 (S1.1.5) Repetitive elements transcription and mobilization contribute to human skeletal muscle differentiation and Duchenne muscular dystrophy progression about 20% of overall transcripts in a cell. This study revealed that repetitive element expression is regulated in a tissue specific manner and that their expression is positively correlated with expression of neighboring genes. Notably, LINE signal dependent expression appears to be linked to their genomic redistribution, as recent reports showed de novo LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition events in somatic as well as cancer cells ( It has also been shown that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissuespecific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of L1 retrotransposition (Muotri et al. Nat 2010). These findings suggest a potential role of mobile elements as mediators of somatic variations, which in turn can influence the genome and the epigenome plasticity in order to accomplish developmental programs. The role of noncoding transcriptome in skeletal muscle cell differentiation is unexplored and it may represent an opportunity to unravel and characterize its contribution to dystrophic muscle degeneration. To this we generated deepseq transcriptome CAGE libraries from three Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and three controls' primary myoblasts. Cytosolic and nuclear RNA fractions were collected and deepsequenced at different time points: proliferating myoblasts, myotubes upon differentiation induction (day 1 of differentiation) and differentiated myotubes (day 8 of differentiation). This analysis highlighted that LINEs constitute the bulk of repetitive element transcription and that the resulting RNAs are selectively localized in the nucleus. Notably the largest difference between DMD and control samples appears to be in nuclear transcriptome of all repetitive elements including LINE-1. Further, by using a Taqman-based approach, we analysed L1 copy number variation in proliferating and differentiating myoblasts derived from the same DMD patients and healthy donors; surprisingly, new retrotrasposition events occured during control's differentiation and not during DMD's differentiation. In general, the CNVs of LINEs appear to be alterated in patients compared to control. Current efforts are aimed at establishing a direct link between L1 transcription, myogenic program and its alteration in DMD progression.",

The latter group codes for small nucleolar (sno) RNAs, untranslated RNAs mostly required for ribosomal RNA maturation. In the yeast genome they are among the most intensively transcribed loci and in spite of their common involvement in ribosome biogenesis they display a unique promoter architecture, remarkably different from that of RP and ribi genes. As we found, the stereotypical promoter of independent snoRNA genes is a nuclesome free region with a canonical TATA box and a poly(dA : dT) tract sometimes associated with a Reb1 binding site. The upstream border of the promoter is marked by a precisely positioned binding site for telomere binding factor1 (Tbf1) that we found associated to the promoters of other genes some of which are involved in ribosome biogenesis. Among such ubiquitous cis-acting elements, some might play different role at snoRNA and non-snoRNA promoter. For example we found that Tbf1 activates transcription without affecting nucleosome positioning at snoRNAs target, while it influences chromatin structure at non-snoRNA targets. Interestingly, the specific snoRNA promoter signature is also maintained in some ribi genes (EFB1, IMD4 and TEF4) containing an intron-embedded snoRNA, as if the presence of the snoRNA gene could impose a specific promoter architecture to the host gene.",

Genomic actions of ERa in response to ligands have been widely described. However, recent studies suggest that unliganded ERa is necessary and sufficient to maintain basal expression of epithelial genes (Cardamone et al., 2009). Therefore, we set out to examine the binding of unliganded ERa to chromatin and possible epigenetic and transcriptional effects, in human breast cancer cells. First, we have analyzed available ERa ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass-sequencing) datasets from experiments of MCF7 and T47D cells cultured in absence of estrogen (Cicatiello et al. 2010; Carroll, JS unpublished). Data obtained from MCF7 and T47D experiments were crossed: common peaks were mapped on genome and validated on individual ERa ChIP experiments, by comparing MCF7 cells transfected with control and ERa siRNA in hormone-deprived medium. These preliminary experiments demonstrated that a number of bonafide ERa binding sites are indeed present in absence of ligand. Next, we have performed ERa-ChIP-sequencing using MCF7 cells transfected with control and ERa siRNA, as above. 10,778 ER-binding peaks (p-value \u00a30.005) were found, confirming the constitutive presence of ERa in intronic and intergenic regions (45.90% and 43.93%, respectively) as well as in gene promoters and exonic regions (4.62% and 2.51%, respectively). The search for transcription factor binding sites showed significant enrichment for EREs motifs (identified in 47% of ER-binding peaks), as well as a number of other putative binding motifs (SP1, AP1, AP2, RXR). Furthermore, we have studied gene expression by microarray experiments in the same conditions, obtaining a list of genes that are regulated by ERa siRNA, suggesting that unliganded ERa may indeed regulate basal expression of a number of genes.",

ZNF224-mediated gene silencing requires the interaction of the KRAB domain with the co-repressor protein KAP1 (KRABassociated protein 1) that, in turn, coordinates the activities of large macromolecular complexes that modify chromatin structure to silence gene expression. Moreover, the transcriptional repression activity of ZNF224 required the methylation of H4R3 by PRMT5, a type II protein arginine methyltransferase, implicated in process from signalling and transcription regulation to protein sorting. Recently, we identified new ZNF224 target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay shows the binding of ZNF224 to FKBP12 promoter, and RNA interference and over-expression experiments suggest a negative regulation of FKBP12 by ZNF224, according to its role of transcriptional repressor. FKP12 is an immunophilinis with peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase activity that binds to different proteins. FKBP12 binding to TbR-I inhibits TGF-b signaling and prevents the spontaneous, ligand-indipendent activation of TbR-I by TbR-II. Moreover, we demonstrated that ZNF224 binds the region upstream of the transcription start site of TP53 gene and this interaction results in a positive transcriptional regulation, lead to suppose a role for ZNF224 protein in transcriptional activation. p53 acts as an essential growth checkpoint that protects the cells against cellular transformation. Interestingly, p53 is also required for correct TGF-b responsiveness. These findings prompt us to investigate the role of ZNF224 in TGF-b signaling and p53 regulation. Developmental and tissue-specific expression of higher eukaryotic genes involves activation of transcription at the appropriate time and place and keeping it silent otherwise. Enhancers are positive regulatory DNA-elements activating gene transcription. Enhancers can act over large distances (communicative activity) and their ability to communicate with promoters is a key in establishing a high-level expression profile. Currently mechanisms controlling enhancer action are poorly understood. Here we report that transcription through enhancers of the white and yellow genes interfere with their activity. Moreover, we show that transcription neutralizes communicative activity of enhancers, but does not affect the ability of enhancers to activate gene transcription at the close distance. Our data provide evidence that transcription can play important role in regulation of enhancer action in higher eukaryotes.",

Lim Division of Pharmacology, School of Medicine , Sungkyunkwan University and SBRI, 300 Cheoncheon-dong, Jangan-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-d, Republic of Korea DNA lesions are inevitable obstacles to the faithful genome replication in all living cells. B-family DNA polymerases (pols) are supposed to mainly replicate chromosomal DNA with high fidelity, while error-prone Y-family DNA pols bypass pol-blocking DNA lesions. In this study, two archaeal DNA pols, a B-family pol Vent from Thermococcus litoralis and a Y-family pol Dpo4 from Sulfolobus solfataricus P2, were studied with three series of DNA lesions, N2-G, O6-G adducts and AP site, to better understand the effects of specifically modified DNA on binding, bypass efficiency and fidelity of pols. Vent readily copied past only methyl(Me)G adducts (N2-MeG and O6-MeG), but Dpo4 bypassed not only MeG adducts but also N2-BzG adducts. Interestingly, Dpo4 and Vent bypassed AP sites with similar efficiency but with different processivity, indicating that DNA synthesis across AP sites can be processed by both B-and Y-family pols. Dpo4 showed about 300-fold decrease in kcat/Km for dCTP insertion opposite O6-G adducts but no decrease opposite N2-G adducts compared to G, whereas Vent showed about 500-fold decrease in that opposite both O6-MeG and N2-MeG adducts. Dpo4 showed a strong preference for correct dCTP opposite all DNA lesions, while Vent preferred dGTP opposite N2-MeG, dTTP opposite O6-MeG, and dATP opposite AP site. However, in most cases Dpo4 and Vent bound the adducted DNA with only slightly increased (up to 1.6-fold) or similar affinity, compared to undamaged DNA. Our results suggest that a Y-family pol Dpo4 is more catalytically efficient and accurate in nucleotide insertion opposite both N2-G and O6-G adducts than a B-family pol Vent, although having similar binding affinities to normal and adducted DNA substrates. Our data also reveal that Dpo4 catalytically prefers N2-G adducts to O6-G adducts for substrate but Vent does not. Implications of our data with respect to the cognate substrates of B-and Y-family DNA pols are also discussed.",

Although the microorganism is widely distributed in environment, dried-infant milk formula has been implicated as a mode of transmission. The results indicate that Cronobacter is much more resistant than other Enterobacteriaceae to environmental stresses, including heating or drying. Therefore strains represent increased risk of contamination during infant formula reconstitution. The aim of our work was to study Cronobacter strains differing in thermal tolerance and to characterize DNA region, which is present in some strains. Test of survival at 58\u00b0C separated strains into thermosensitive and thermotolerant (D58 = 17-50s., 100-300s, respectivelly). Thermotolerant strains were also positive for PCR thermotolerance marker homologous to a hypothetical protein Mfla_1165 from Methylobacillus flagellatus. The 19 kbp island surrounding marker of thermotolerance was sequenced in C. sakazakii LMG 5740. The greatest part of the region contained a cluster of conservative genes, most of them have significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation, acid stress and several genes with unknown function. The same thermoresistance DNA island was detected in several strains belonging to Cronobacter, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia genus. By rt-PCR approach we detected high expression throughout all thermotolerance gene cluster in both stationary and exponentially grown bacteria. The Cronobacter strain lacking the whole thermotolerance island was constructed and confirmed to possess decreased survival rate at 58\u00b0C. On the other hand, the orfHIJK genes from the DNA region encoded on plasmid vector increased twice D58 value of E. coli host strain. Our results have shown that the new genetic region is important in response of Cronobacter strains to several stress conditions. Rapid detection of single-base changes is fundamental to molecular medicine. A simple and cost-effective method for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping would improve the accessibility to SNPs for all minimally equipped laboratories. This work present the allelic inhibition of displacement activity (AIDA) system, a simple PCR method for zygosity detection of known mutation in a single reaction. AIDA-PCR is built on the notion that an oligonucleotide which can be extended by Taq DNA polymerase is able to block the amplification of a PCR product when situated between two flanking PCR primers. An oligonucleotide mismatched at its 3' terminus, however, does not demonstrated this ability. Thus, unlike Tetra-primers Amplification Refractory Mutation System (T-ARMS) PCR, in AIDA-PCR only three unlabeled primers are necessary, two outer common primers and one inner primer with allele-specific 3' terminus mismatch. Following AIDA reaction the outer primers amplifies a fragment which is also a PCR positive control, in inverse proportion to primerextension efficiency of inner allele-specific primer. Therefore while AIDA reaction on DNA derived from heterozygote genotype shows two bands pattern in agarose gel, presence of only one band corresponding to inner-derived fragment represents relative homozygote genotype. However lack of inner-specific PCR product in the presence of outer-derived fragment represents alternative homozygote genotype. The parameters for optimizing AIDA system were investigated in detail for rs1127354 and rs7270101, two common SNPs present in ITPA gene and validated by the analysis of DNA samples of 190 patients with chronic HCV infection. In conclusion, AIDA-PCR is an efficient and inexpensive method for detecting known single-base changes in a one-tube reaction. Moreover the method is also suitable for evaluation of a low number of samples on a routine basis allowing the implementation of genotyping in clinical practice.",

However, there is still one aspect that needs to be improved: the sequence assembly and the subsequent data analysis.

The present work aims to obtain the genome sequence of an Italian genotype of Populus nigra, a native European poplar species that is very important for wood and paper industry, exploiting the Illumina technology and a de novo assembly approach. We sequenced the individual at high coverage (86\u00b7) using different kinds of libraries in order to solve repetitions and allow the contig scaffolding: technical and critical aspects will be provided. Then, we focused on two different softwares performing de novo assembly to compare the results. On the selected assembly (length 318 Mb and N50 4487 bp), we developed an analysis pipeline to characterize the contig content in terms of repetitive elements, coding potential and sequence novelty compared to P. trichocarpa, the American poplar species sequenced using the Sanger method. We think our pipeline can be applied to different organisms closely related. The P. nigra de novo sequence will be exploited to introduce the concept of the pangenome, which includes core genomic features common to both species and a dispensable genome composed of non-shared DNA elements that can be individual-or population-specific and important for explaining phenotypic variation.",

HLA DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes confer the highest estimated heritability (~35%) reported so far, and the exposure to gliadin triggers an inappropriate immune response in HLA-susceptible individuals. However, the presence of HLA-risk alleles is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of the disease. In fact, about 30-40% of healthy subjects carry HLA-risk alleles. Increased intestinal permeability is also implicated in gluten sensitivity. MiRNAs play a relevant role in regulating gene expression in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions including autoimmune disorders. Our aims were to look for miRNA-based alterations of gene expression in celiac small intestine, and for metabolic pathways that could be modulated by this epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation. A cohort of 40 children [20 with active CD, 9 on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and 11 controls], were consecutively recruited at the Paediatrics Department (University of Naples 'Federico II'). We tested the expression of 365 human miRNAs by TaqMan low-density arrays; we found that the expression of about 20% of the miRNAs tested differed between CD children and control children. We used bioinformatic techniques to predict putative target genes of these CD specific miRNAs and to select involved biological pathways.

(Regione Campania DGRC 1901 The ribosomal RNA (rDNA) gene repeats are essential elements of all organisms' genome. In most eukaryotes, the rRNA genes (18S, 5.8S&28S) exist as a cluster(s) of genes interspersed with internal transcribed spacers (ITS1&ITS2) and intergenic spacers (IGS). rDNA transcription and its level play a key role in metabolic rate of whole organism. The rDNA transcriptional rate can be affected by both the structure of rDNA spacer sequences and copy number of rRNA genes. A strong positive correlation is observed between genome size and rDNA copy number. Each species has a specific number of rDNA copies which are maintained by gene amplification system. The vast majority of living organisms are known to have a constant genome size during whole ontogenesis. At the same time, a somatic genome of a number of eukaryotes, in particular Cyclops kolensis undergoes a chromatin diminution (CD) that results in elimination of considerable amount (94%) of nuclear DNA. The main goals of our study were to carry out the comparative analysis of rDNA structural organization of two closely related species (C. kolensis & C. insignis) inhabited in similar environmental conditions and to investigate the influence of CD on the structure of C.kolensis rDNA. The rDNA repeat units (~10kbp) of studied species were amplified by PCR, cloned in plasmid vector and sequenced. Because of the sequence complexity the IGSs of both species were preliminarily subcloned using exonucleaseIII digestion. The comparative analysis of rDNA repeat units revealed considerable differences between copy numbers and types of repeated internal elements of IGSs as well as between foldings of ITS1 & ITS2. We believe that the revealed differences may have reflection in ecological plasticity of these two species. Using quantitative PCR we have detected a dramatic decrease of rDNA copy number in C.kolensis somatic genome after CD in comparison with C.kolensis germ-line genome and with genome of C.insignis.",

The predicted products of these genes showed high identity to JHEs of other lepidopterans, but our data suggest the characterization of this cluster as JHE related. We have cloned and characterized four JHER cDNAs, suggesting the presence of at least three alternatively spliced isoforms, (SnJ-HER1, SnJHER2 and SnJHER3), which are processed from a parental mRNA encoded by the paralog gene SnJHEgR.

Despite the considerable amount of information about PcG mechanisms controlling gene silencing, how PcG proteins maintain repressive chromatin during epigenome duplication is still obscure. Here we identify the specific time window, the early S phase, in which PcG proteins are recruited at their PRE target sites and, concomitantly, the repressive mark H3K27m3 becomes highly enriched. Notably, these events precede PRE replication in late S phase, when instead, most of epigenetic signatures are reduced, suggesting a model in which PcG signature is regulated before replication. Further, we found that cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) governs the early S-phase dependent deposition of histone H3K27m3 repressive mark. These findings define CDK2-PcG as a cell cycle regulated signalling pathway that may represent one of the key mechanisms for PcG mediated epigenetic inheritance during Sphase.",

This process is called 'foetal or intrauterine programming'. Experimental data support that the epigenetic regulation of foetal genes could be an important mechanism of the foetal programming of obesity. The aim of this study was to characterize the miRNA expression profile of amnion from obese and non-obese pregnant women at delivery in order to define a miRNA signature associated with obesity and to evidentiate metabolic pathways potentially deregulated by this regulatory mechanism. We recruited 5 non-obese (BMI< 25 kg/m 2 ) and 10 obese (BMI> 30 kg/m 2 ) pregnant women at delivery. Total RNA was purified from amnion. A total of 365 human miRNAs was evaluated by the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA Panel v1.0 (Applied Biosystems) system. By the Tar-getScan program we selected the target genes of the miRNAs differently expressed in obese versus non-obese pregnant women, further using the KEGG database we selected the biological pathways that contained at least two of these predicted genes miRNA-altered in obese samples at a significant level (p < 0.001). The results show that 78% of the 365 miRNAs studied are expressed in the amnion, particularly 32% of these miRNAs is up-expressed (Relative Quantification, RQ> 2) and 16% is down-expressed (RQ< 0.5). Bioinformatics analysis show that most of the miRNA regulated genes could be associated with the foetal programming of obesity and belongs to: cancer (n = 115), metabolic (n = 54) and MAPK signalling (n = 45) pathways. Grant: CEINGE -Regione Campania (DGRC 1901 (DGRC -2009 The high and rising incidence of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy in the Western world is a cause of increasing public health concern. Dihydrotestosterone, the main androgen in the prostate, is produced from testosterone by the enzyme steroid 5a-Reductase (5a-R), which occurs as two isozymes, type-1 (5a-R1) and type-2 (5a-R2), both implicated in the pathogenesis of the prostatic gland. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, 5a-R1 and 5a-R2 mRNA and protein levels were detected in prostate of adult rats after they had undergone environmental stresses, i.e., excessive heat, artificial light, and the sensation of immobility in a small space, similar to those found in common workplace situations. These environmental stress situations increased the mRNA and protein levels of both 5a-R isozymes. The present study contributes the first evidence that environmental stress not only induces an increase in mRNA levels of the 5a-R2 isozyme (isozyme implicated in benign prostatic hypertrophy) but also produces a much greater increase in mRNA levels of the 5a-R1 isozyme. A much higher activity of 5a-R1 than of 5a-R2 has been observed in PCa. Although our biochemical and molecular studies were performed in rats, the results obtained are consistent with epidemiological findings in humans and deserve consideration in the development of appropriate environmental and occupational health policies. Vertebrate olfactory receptors (OR) are part of a multigene gene family with more than 1500 genes in mice. The polymorphism of this gene family reflects the diversity of odorous chemicals that are detected and this gene family evolves by 'birth-and-death evolution'. Bathyergidae or African mole-rats (AMR) are subterranean rodents that display varying levels of sociality; a unique trait among mammals. Life underground has imposed unusual constraints on social interactions, resulting in a suite of adaptations and different levels of sociality. We predict that enhanced olfaction is fundamental to these adaptations in AMR and correlate with degree of sociality. We identified 178 unique OR sequences, corresponding to 119 unique OR genes from 14 AMR species after amplification with AMR specific primers. We observed differing proportions of OR genes to pseudogenes across the 14 species. We tested for signals of selection using a combination of dN/dS ratio and other tests (e.g. Tajima's D test, Fu & Li's D, & F* tests) across the AMR gene tree and recovered four strongly supported clades with differential signals of selection. The percentage (or ratio of genes to pseudogenes) of putative functional OR gene ranges from 14% (clade B) to 63% (clade D). This is suggestive of no signal of selection (clade A), balancing selection (clade C), positive selection (clade A) and purifying selection (clade D) across the gene tree. Clade D had high levels of functional OR genes suggesting that these genes are indeed important in AMR, whilst our data from testing for selection in clade C is consistent with balancing selection that can be explained if these genes acted in synergy. Although we found differential signals of selection across the 14 species of AMR in a socially-partitioned tree, the main branches leading to the three social groups had a signal of adaptive evolution. However there was no evidence that any social lineage may have better adapted olfaction than another.",

Bozkurt, T. Ozkan, E. Kansu and A. Sunguroglu Hacettepe University, Ankara University Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease.In patients with blastic phase, CML is irreversible despite the use of Imatinib. EZH2 mediated H3K27 trimethylation can cause DNA methylation and inhibits gene expression. This project aims to investigate epigenetic mechanisms that could be deregulated in imatinib resistant cell line K-562/IMA-3. For this purpose promoter methylation status of the Bim and Bid proapoptotic genes and the effects of the PRC4 protein complex on it were examined. In this study expression levels of the EZH2, EED2, SIRT1, SUZ12, which belong to PRC4 protein family and Bim, Bid genes were quantified in _ Imatinib resistant cell line K-562/IMA-3 and non-resistant cell line K-562. H3K27 trimethylation on Bim and Bid genes were searched by ChIP experiments.The promoter methylation status of Bim and Bid genes were analysed by methylation specific PCR. The expression of the PRC4 group genes were detected at lower level and the expression of the Bim and Bid genes were detected at higher level in the imatinib resistant K-562/IMA-3 cells than imatinib nonresistant K-562 cells. According to CHIP experiments E2H2 and DNMT1 enzymes were bounded and H3K27me3 modification have been detected in the promoter region of the Bim gene in the both cell lines. The EZH2 and DNMT1 enzymes were not found bounded to the promoter region of the Bid gene in the imatinib resistant K-562/IMA-3 cell lines. But they were found bounded to the promoter region of the Bid gene in the K-562 cell lines. H3K27me3 modification have been detected in the promoter region of the Bid gene in the both cell lines. As a result of these experiments the promoter region of the Bid and Bim genes were found as homozygous unmethylated in the both cell lines and it can be postulated that the promoter methylations of Bid and Bim genes don't take a role in the resistance of apoptosis which leads to drug resistance in the imatinib resistant K-562/IMA-3 cell lines. Recent studies show that DNA structural variation (SV) comprises a major portion of genetic diversity in several genomes. Traditionally, the detection of large SVs have used whole-genome array comparative genome hybridization (CGH) or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies promises to revolutionize structural variation studies. However, the data generated by NGS technologies require an extensive computational analysis in order to identify genomic variants present in the sequenced individuals. In the present work we describe a workflow developed for the identification of SVs from Illumina paired-end sequencing data. The studied sample was composed of 16 poplar trees obtained from a factorial design: two Populus nigra males, two Populus deltoides females and 12 hybrids offspring (P. nigra \u00b7 P. deltoides), three for each of the possible crosses. The use of an interspecific family as the studied sample ensured the presence of a great rate of variability between the studied individuals and, in addition, gave us the possibility to check the segregation of the identified variants. Our workflow took advantage of depth of coverage (DOC) and paired-end mapping (PEM) signatures to identify thousands of genomic regions with a significant copy number variation between the two species. In addition, we developed a custom algorithm for the identification of novel large insertions. We identified thousands of putative insertions in P. nigra or P. deltoides with respect to the P. trichocarpa reference sequence. A subset of the identified SVs was experimentally validated while annotation and characterization is ongoing. The described method is of general application and can be employed for the genome-wide identification of small and large SVs in any organism of interest. We previously isolated two centromeric satellite DNA sequences, 37cen and 2PI. The 37cen sequence is 93% identical to the horse major satellite family, while the 2PI sequence belongs to the e4/1 satellite family and shares 83% identity with it. We investigated the chromosomal distribution of these satellite tandem repeats in different species of the genus Equus and observed that several chromosomes, while lacking satellite DNA at their centromeres, as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), contain such sequences at one non-centromeric terminus, probably corresponding to the relic of an ancestral now inactive centromere (Piras et al., Cytogenet Genome Res 2009; 126: 165-172; Piras et al., PLoS Genet 2010; 6: e1000845). In addition, our data demonstrated that several horse and donkey chromosomes share sequences from both satellite DNA repeats; however, the physical relations among satellite DNA families at each locus cannot be investigated with conventional approaches. Here we present data concerning the elucidation of some aspects of the architectural organization of horse satellite DNA. To this purpose we set up molecular cytogenetic procedures based on FISH on combed DNA ?bres and comet FISH. Our results demonstrate that horse centromeric DNA repeats are organized in a variable fashion. The two satellite DNA families are arranged in sequence blocks whose size can change widely; moreover, the distance among different clusters is extremely diversified as well as their order of alternation, finally intervening sequences are present. The origin of the intervening sequences is at present unknown. Our data suggest that horse centromere domain general architecture resembles that already described for some human centromeres.",

The principle ways in which epigenetic information is stored and propagated is via DNA methylation and chromatin modifications. Specific patterns of epigenetic marks form the molecular basis for developmental stage-and cell type-specific patterns of gene expression that are hallmarks of distinct cellular phenotypes. Importantly, epigenetic marks can be stably transmitted through mitosis and cell division. Thus, a unique opportunity arising from the application of epigenomic profiling technologies in drug safety sciences is the potential to gain novel insight into the molecular basis of long-lasting druginduced cellular perturbations. We have evaluated the utility of integrated genome-wide epigenomic & transcriptomic profiling in tissues from preclinical animal models with particular emphasis on the identification of early mechanism-based markers for NGC, a key issue for the safety profiling and assessment of new drugs. A well characterized mouse model for phenobarbital-mediated promotion of NGC, in which extensive perturbations of the epigenome have been previously described, has been used to evaluate the utility of combining genome-wide and locus-specific DNA methylation, chromatin modification, mRNA and microR-NA profiling assays in target (liver) and non-target (kidney) tissues. The application of this integrated molecular profiling approach for identifying early mechanism-based markers of NGC may ultimately increase the quality of cancer risk assessments for candidate drugs and ensure a lower attrition rate during late-phase development. Epigenomic profiling has great potential for enhancing toxicogenomics-based mechanistic investigations within drug safety sciences.",

One family of these proteins, often referred as adaptors, mediators or co-activators facilitate transcription possibly by promoting the interactions between transcriptional activators and general transcriptional machinery through binding to specific DNA sequences upstream of core promoters. Adaptor proteins are usually required for this activation, possibly to acetylate and destabilize nucleosomes, thereby relieving chromatin constraints at the basal promoter. Alteration/ deficiency in activation (ADA3), a transcriptional adapter protein of~50 kDa, is one of the essential component of this machinery, which is known to effect transcription by association with DNAbinding factors and by modifying local chromatin structure. A number of important interacting partners of ADA3 have already been reported. To fully understand the mechanism and involvement of ADA3 in transcriptional regulation, we screened a pretransformed human fetal brain cDNA library using a ADA3expressing plasmid as a bait by yeast-2-hybrid methodology and identified new potential interactors with ADA3. Our results are partially verified with biological assays and outcomes are discussed in relation to the significance of ADA3 in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.

Russev Institute of Molecular Biology ''Roumen Tsanev'', Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Anticancer treatments aim to damage DNA of the proliferating cancer cells in order to start the process of apoptosis and cause cell death. However, efficiency of anticancer treatments is reduced by checkpoint activation and cell cycle arrest that facilitate repair. One way to abrogate cell cycle arrest would be to assist expression of genes responsible for cell cycle progression by maintaining open chromatin structure. Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce accumulation of hyperacetylated histones and open chromatin structure and have been considered as potential enhancers of the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and other anticancer drugs. Theoretically, combined use of DNA damaging agents and modulators of histone modifications could allow the use of lower therapeutic doses and reduction of the adverse side effects of the cytostatic drugs. However, the molecular mechanisms by which they sensitize the cells towards anticancer drugs are not known in detail. The subject of our work was to study the molecular mechanisms by which sodium butyrate sensitizes cancer cells towards cisplatin. HeLa cells were treated with 5 mM butyrate, with 8 lM cis-diaminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin), or with both. Cells treated with both agents showed approximately twofold increase of the mortality rate in comparison with cells treated with cisplatin only. Accordingly, the life span of albino mice transfected with Ehrlich ascites tumor was prolonged almost twofold by treatment with cisplatin and butyrate in comparison with cisplatin alone. This showed that the observed synergism of cisplatin and butyrate was not limited to specific cell lines or in vitro protocols, but was also expressed in vivo during the process of tumor development. DNA labeling and fluorescence activated cell sorting experiments showed that cisplatin treatment inhibited DNA synthesis and arrested HeLa cells at the G1/S transition and early S phase of the cell cycle. Western blotting and chroma-tin immunoprecipitation revealed that this effect was accompanied with a decrease of histone H4 acetylation levels. Butyrate treatment initially reversed the effect of cisplatin by increasing the levels of histone H4 acetylation in euchromatin regions responsible for the G1/S phase transition and initiation of DNA synthesis. This abrogated the cisplatin imposed cell cycle arrest and the cells traversed S phase with damaged DNA. However, this effect was transient and continued only a few hours. The long-term effect of butyrate was a massive histone acetylation in both eu-and heterochromatin, inhibition of DNA replication and apoptosis.",

Recent evidence shows that part of this regulatory action is at transcriptional level. A key component of the UPS is the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a protein complex conserved in all eukaryotes which removes the small peptide NEDD8 (an ubiquitin like modifier) from the cullin-RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The reaction catalyzed by CSN is necessary for the regulation of the assembly/disassembly cycles of these ligases and is essential in all higher eukaryotes. At the cellular level, CSN mutants from different organisms display de-repression and, more in general, miss-regulation of several sets of genes. The CSN from budding yeast S.cerevisiae has been recently characterized. In contrast to other eukaryotes, all the CSN subunits from S.cerevisiae are non-essential. The non essentiality of CSN components and the availability of powerful genetic tools make S.cerevisiae a very promising model system to elucidate some aspects of the regulatory role of this complex. We performed a transcriptomic analysis of a S.cerevisiae strain deleted in CSN5 (the de-neddylating subunit of the yeast Cop9 complex), as compared with its isogenic wild type strain. Data suggest that Csn5 is involved in the modulation of several genes controlling lipid metabolism and ergosterol biosynthesis. In order to support a real involvement of Cop9 signalosome in the regulation of lipid metabolism and ergosterol biosynthesis, we performed real time RT-PCR on 11 genes to test their modulation in all deletion mutants of the Cop9 components. All the modulations were confirmed for delta csn5 and most of them were observed in most of the other mutants. We also tested the various deletion strains for phenotypic features related to defects in ergosterol biosynthesis.",

Rejuvenation Res 2010 Apr-Jun;13(2-3):365-72.) gives possible explanations to several biological phenomena via trans-acting ncRNAs (memRNAs) able to orchestrate chromatin remodelling and in turn enhance transcription. memRNAs assert their functions especially during the postmitotic chromatin remodelling. memRNAs can mark the genes transcribed in the mother cell that must be re-activated after the cell division. During the M phase of the cell cycle the chromatin is almost totally collapsed and the transcription is turned off. RNA memory model explains easily how the epigenetic state can be re-established after mitosis. RNA memory, e. g., can easily explain why the interference machinery is needed for the establishment of the silenced state of a gene but it is not needed for its maintenance: the interference machinery drives the degradation of specific memRNAs in the mother cell; so in the next cell generation the gene is maintained silenced, and so on through generations, if no external stimuli perturb the state. RNA memory model fits perfectly with other models on the epigenetic inheritance (epigenetic histone code readers/writers, histone variants, PcG/trxG interaction, structural epigenetic memory, etc). The relationship of RNA memory with other models will be discussed specifically. An RNA-Memory model explanation of controversial biological phenomena will be suggested.

In the current work, differentiation of a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NTERA2/NT2) was induced by retinoic acid (RA), and histone variations were compared throughout this process. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed by Western blot technique showed a significant decrease in expression level of the histone variant H2A.Z, after RA-induced differentiation of EC cells. Total expression of the variant was further checked by immunocytochemistry using an anti-H1x antibody, and also quantified by real-time PCR. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique coupled with real-time PCR analysis, it was also shown that incorporation of this epigenetic mark through the genome changes quantitatively after RA-induced differentiation of EC cells. Our finding implies the dynamic interplay of H2A.Z histone variant in molecular mechanisms of normal/carcinoma switch, and maybe suggests a diagnostic/prognostic value for this epigenetic variation in cancer. Alternative splicing (AS) is one of the main regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. It has also been demonstrated that some evolutionarily conserved AS events give rise to aberrant transcripts, that are targeted for decay by nonsense-mediated mRNA (NMD). NMD is an mRNA surveillance pathway that recognizes and selectively degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTC), thus preventing the synthesis of truncated proteins that could be deleterious to the cell. NMD is also involved, in association with AS, in the post-transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes. We previously demonstrated that ASinduced retention of part of intron 3 of rpL3 pre-mRNA produces an mRNA isoform containing a PTC that is substrate of NMD (1) . We also demonstrated that overexpression of rpL3 upregulates the AS of its pre-mRNA. Next, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying rpL3 autoregulation. Specifically we investigated the role played by hnRNP H1 in the regulation of splicing of rpL3 pre-mRNA by manipulating its expression level (2) . We also identified and characterized the cisacting regulatory elements involved in hnRNP H1-mediated regulation of rpL3 splicing. RNA electromobility shift assay demonstrated that hnRNP H1 specifically recognizes and binds directly to the intron 3 region that contains seven copies of G-rich elements. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis and in vivo studies showed that the G3 and G6 elements are required for hnRNP H1-mediated regulation of rpL3 pre-mRNA splicing. We propose a working model in which rpL3 recruits hnRNP H1 and, through cooperation with other splicing factors, promotes selection of the alternative splice site. Human intersectin 1 gene (ITSN1) encodes two isoforms (ITSN1-S and ITSN1-L) of multidomain adapter protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, cell signaling and cytoskeleton reorganization. It is known that many genes are regulated posttranscriptionally by different factors that have targets in 3'UTRs of their mRNAs. The aim of our work was to identify full-length 3'UTR of ITSN1-L and define target sites for microR-NAs that could regulate ITSN1 on posttranscriptional level. To define full-length 3'UTR of ITSN1-L we performed computational analysis of GenBank EST database and identified 11 ESTs which showed that the most probable end of 3'UTR of ITSN1-L mRNA could be located approximately 11600 downstream from the characterized 3' end of exon 41. Then we performed 3'RACE, RT-PCR, cloning of RT-PCR products in pGEM-T-easy vector, and sequencing and confirmed this prediction. To identify target sites of microRNAs in 3'UTR of ITSN1-S mRNA we used Tar-getScan.org, microRNA.org and other web-servers and identified putative target sites for several microRNAs. To confirm these results we performed luciferase assay using the construct based on pTKluc vector with insertion of full-length ITSN1-S mRNA 3'UTR on HEK 293 cells. We found the 5-fold inhibiting of pTKluc-3'UTR ITSN1-S construct luciferase activity in HEK 293 compared to the intact pTKluc vector. To investigate effect of potential target sites for microRNAs six deletion mutants based on pTKluc vector with 3'UTR of ITSN1-S mRNA insertion were created. Each of them lacked different regions of 3'UTR with predicted microRNA targets and transfections into HEK 293 and luciferase assays were performed. The results showed different levels of expression inhibition compared to the intact pTKluc vector and construct with full-length 3'UTR. Endometriosis is a chronic benign gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity (ectopic endometrium), often resulting in chronic pelvic pain and infertility. MicroRNAs are members of a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that have a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by repressing target mRNAs translation. Several studies have shown the involvement of microRNAs in several biological processes and diseases, including tumorigenesis. Recently it has been shown a differential expression of miRNAs between endometrial tissue inside the uterine cavity (eutopic) and ectopic tissue in women with endometriosis. We have demonstrated that, among the miRNAs differentially expressed, the expression of miR-200c significantly decreases in ectopic tissue. Thus we are investigating the role of miR-200c deregulation in the pathology. We are analyzing the effects of its upregulation or downregulation in human endometrial stromal cell line, on several biological functions, such as apoptosis, decidualization, migration, invasion, proliferation, known to be altered in endometriosis.",

Flt-1 (VEGF receptor-1) is expressed in vascular endothelial cells as both cell surface membrane-bound form (mFlt-1) and secreted soluble form (sFlt-1). sFlt-1 is produced by the gene encoding mFlt-1 through mRNA alternative 3\u00a2-end processing and potently inhibits angiogenesis by binding extracellularly to VEGF. Here we report that hypoxia down-regulates sFlt-1 expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), a constituent of microvessels wherein angiogenesis occurs*. Hypoxia (5-1% O2) increased VEGF expression in HMVECs. In contrast, the levels of sFlt-1 mRNA and protein in HMVECs significantly decreased as the O 2 concentration dropped, while those of mFlt-1 mRNA and protein remained unchanged. When HMVECs were treated with a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, DMOG, to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), sFlt-1 and mFlt-1 mRNA levels increased and sFlt-1/ mFlt-1 mRNA ratio remained unchanged, indicating that HIF-1 was not directly involved in the hypoxia-induced decrease of sFlt-1 mRNA levels. We next identified cis-elements involved in sFlt-1 mRNA processing in HMVECs using a human Flt-1 minigene, and found that two non-contiguous AUUAAA sequences function as the poly(A) signal and that a U-rich region in intron 13 regulates sFlt-1 mRNA processing. Mutagenesis of these elements in intron 13 caused a significant decrease in the soluble/ membrane RNA ratio in the minigene-transfected HMVECs. We also demonstrated that sFlt-1 overexpression in lentiviral construct-infected HMVECs counteracts VEGF-induced endothelial cell growth. These results suggest that decreased sFlt-1 expression due to hypoxia contributes to hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and reveals a novel mechanism regulating angiogenesis by alternative mRNA 3\u00a2-end processing. *Biochem J in press (2011) [2011 Mar 7, Epub ahead of print] P02.7 Gene silencing through the alteration of pre-mRNA splicing in cancer effects. FGFR3 has been demonstrated to either stimulate or prohibit cell proliferation, depending on the tissue type. A nested reverse transcription-PCR analysis of FGFR3 from human colorectal carcinomas revealed novel mutant transcripts caused by aberrant splicing and activation of cryptic splice sequences. Two aberrantly spliced transcripts were detected with high frequency in 50% of 36 primary tumors and in 60% of 10 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, we found a novel splice variant of FGFR2 (FGFR2DIII) arising from skipping exons 7-10, resulting in the deletion of Ig-like-III domain in human chondrosarcoma cell. Sf9 cells expressing FGFR2DIII were able to bind FGF1, FGF2, and FGF7, leading to loss of ligand-binding specificity. Taken together, we propose that mRNA splicing plays an important role in the regulation of FGFRs gene. A novel small G-protein GTPBP1 protein is expressed in various tissues, particularly brain, thymus, lung, and kidney. GTPBP1 is also conserved protein in several species. In our group, we confirmed that GTPBP1 binds to the hnRNP proteins which bind to the 3'-untranslated region of target mRNAs. GTPBP1 also interacts with exosome component in cytoplasm. Therefore GTPBP1 binds to the hnRNP proteins bound to target mRNA, and recruits exosome, this interaction to mediate target mRNA decay.",

HCV infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The HCV genome encodes a polyprotein precursor which is processed by viral and cellular proteases and yields atleast 10 structural and non-structural proteins. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) residing in the 5' nontranslated region controls translation initiation. Previous studies from our laboratory and others have shown that HCV possesses a second functional open reading frame within the core gene encoding an additional HCV protein, known as core+1/ARFP, by internal translation initiation. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism that controls core+1/ARF protein synthesis, we searched for putative IRES-like elements within the core coding sequences using a dual luciferase reporter construct. Nucleotides 345-591 of the core-coding sequence were cloned between the Renilla and the Firefly luciferase genes, where Renilla luciferase translation is cap-dependent while the Firefly luciferase translation depends on the presence of IRES-like sequences within the cloned core-coding region. Huh7 cells were transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA derived from the plasmid. Luciferase expression was assessed at 4, 8 and 24 hour p.t. The results showed about 10-fold higher expression as compared to the negative control, suggesting the presence of a functional regulatory element within the corecoding sequence that could direct internal translation initiation of the core+1/ARF. To further support these findings, bicistronic reporter JFH1-based replicons with Firefly luciferase cloned in frame with core or core+1/ARF sequence were constructed and used to transfect Huh7-Lunet and HepG2 cell lines. Expression of core+1/ARF luciferase was observed and further mutational analyses confirmed the translation of core+1 open reading frame.",

Five of these isoforms have deletions in resulting protein domains or aminoacids which may affect binding properties and functions of ITSN1. Here we present results of cloning and characterization of fifteen full-length human ITSN1 transcripts comprising different combinations of alternatively spliced exons. Majority eukaryotic genes contain multiple promoters. We have found alternative promoter in intron 5 of human ITSN1 gene that generates transcripts which encode proteins without first EH-domain. Expression of these transcripts were observed in fetal kidney, liver, lung and brain, as well as in adult kidney and ovary. We have cloned two full-length transcripts and found critical promoter region in LINE1-repeat using deletion mutants. Thus, tissue and development specific splicing may influence the interaction of ITSN1 with their partners and contribute to the regulation of ITSN1 protein function in endocytosis and signal transduction. 4 International Olympic Committee (IOC) Research Centre COL5A1 encodes the a1 chain of type V collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen that regulates fibrillogenesis. A variant within the 3'-UTR of COL5A1 is associated with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT) and other exercise-related phenotypes but its functional significance is unknown. The aim of this study was therefore to identify functional differences between the COL5A1 3'-UTR from patients with AT and asymptomatic controls. To this end we have used a reporter assay in which the COL5A1 3'-UTR from AT patients and controls were cloned downstream of the Firefly luciferase gene and the activity measured as an indication of mRNA stability. When the cloned COL5A1 3'-UTRs were sequenced, two major forms named C-and T-alleles were predominantly identified in the controls and the AT subjects respectively. The luciferase activity of the C-alleles was significantly lower than the T-alleles (69.0 \u00b1 22.0%(n = 24) versus 90.6 \u00b1 13.7%(n = 30), p < 0.001) which suggests an overall increase in mRNA stability for the T-allele. Furthermore, we identified a functional miRNA binding site for Hsa-miR-608 and using deletion constructs we have found additional elements which regulate COL5A1 mRNA stability. These results have important implications for our understanding of the molecular basis of musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries and other exerciserelated phenotypes. The ability of tumor cells to adapt to stress is crucial for their survival. Selective translation of specific genes needed for the adaptation to stress offers such a mechanism. The 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) of many oncogenes or regulators of proliferation and apoptosis are long and highly structured, associated with complex mechanisms of translational control such as upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). Protein kinase C (PKC) represents a family of serin/threonine kinases, playing a central role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and transformation. Post-translational control of the PKC isoforms and their activation has been extensively studied, however, not much is known on their translational regulation. Our studies show that the expression of one of the PKC isoforms, PKCeta, is regulated at the translational level by two uORFs, suppressing its expression under normal growth conditions but markedly enhancing its expression upon stress of amino acids starvation. This upregulation is dependent on the eIF2 kinase general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2). We further show that PKCeta plays a role in autophagy and suggest that its upregulation during stress of amino acids starvation is required for its function during autophagy. Moreover, we point for the transcription factor, nuclear factor jB (NF-jB), as a potential mediator between PKCeta and autophagy. Hence, our studies are the first demonstrating regulation of PKC via uORFs and propose that regulation via uORFs is more common for PKC family members than currently recognized.",

Here, we report that a number of lncRNAs are differentially expressed in melanoma cell lines in comparison to melanocytes and keratinocyte controls. One of these lncRNAs, SPRY4-IN1 (Genbank accession ID AK024556), is derived from an intron of the SPRY4 gene and is predicted to contain several long hairpins in its secondary structure. RNA-FISH analysis showed that SPRY4-IN1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of melanoma cells, and SPRY4-IN1 RNAi knockdown results in defects in cell growth, differentiation and higher rates of apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. Differential expression of both SPRY4 and SPRY4-IN1 was also detected in vivo, in 30 distinct patient samples, classified as primary in situ, regional metastatic, distant metastatic, and nodal metastatic melanoma. The elevated expression of SPRY4-IN1 in melanoma cells compared to melanocytes, its accumulation in cell cytoplasm, and effects on cell dynamics suggest that the higher expression of SPRY4-IN1 may have an important role in the molecular etiology of human melanoma.",

            "text": "Regulation of mitochondrial gene expression requires the involvement of several protein factors (1), some of which still remain to be identified. Many studies indicate that transcription termination plays a key role in controlling mitochondrial gene expression. Three mitochondrial transcription termination factors have been well characterized in animal systems: human mTERF, sea urchin mtDBP and Drosophila melanogaster DmTTF. All these factors belong to a wide protein family named MTERF family (2) . Bioinformatics approaches revealed the existence in Drosophila of three proteins that, in addition to DmTTF, exhibit similarity with human mTERF. In FlyBase database these polypeptides are annotated as CG5047, CG7175 and CG15390, respectively. CG5047 is the orthologue of the human mitochondrial transcription repressor MTERF3; CG15390 is the orthologue of human still uncharacterized MTERF4; CG7175 polypeptide (560 amino acids), similarly to DmTTF, shows orthologues only in insect species. We focused our attention on CG7175 that was named D-MTERFX. Bioinformatic analyses allowed to predict that D-MTERFX localizes into mitochondria and consists, in the mature form, of 531 residues. To in vivo characterize its role, knockdown of the protein was obtained in D.mel-2 cultured cells by means of RNAi. Interestingly, depletion of D-MTERFX affects mitochondrial RNA levels in an opposite way with respect to depletion of the termination factor DmTTF. Moreover bacterial recombinant D-MTERFX was used in band-shift and footprinting experiments, showing interactions of the protein with the same mtDNA regions contacted by the mitochondrial transcription termination factor. The obtained results, allow to suggest for D-MTERFX a role in mitochondrial transcription antithetical to that of the transcription termination factor DmTTF. . We analyzed the transcription of 8 ITSs located far away from genes and found that 6 of them are transcribed into Telomeric Repeat-containing RNAs. These findings demonstrate that ITS transcription contributes to the production of TERRA molecules thus contributing to the maintenance of telomere integrity. Recent results suggest that telomeric proteins may be involved in gene regulation through binding at non-telomeric sites, and that a fraction of these loci is composed by ITSs (Simonet et al. Cell Res 2011). To investigate the involvement of ITSs in gene regulation we carried out an insilico analysis of 83 human ITSs demonstrating that a relevant fraction of these loci (49 ITSs, 59%) is inserted within introns of validated or putative genes. The in-silico analysis of 29 informative ITS-containing genes revealed a high occurrence of alternative splicing at the exons flanking the ITS-containing intron (24 genes, 83%). Using a splicing assay in cultured human cells we showed that telomeric repeats inserted in a minigene alter its splicing. These results suggest that ITSs may be involved in the regulation of gene expression and in particular of alternative splicing. In conclusion, our results suggest that interstitial telomeric sequences can play a role in gene expression regulation and in the maintenance of genome integrity.",

Telomere length correlates with the cell proliferative potential. The necessity to preserve telomere length through unlimited proliferation leads to telomerase upregulation in stem cells as well as in most types of cancers. This makes telomerase a good target for anticancer therapies; therefore, mechanisms governing telomerase regulation and structural information are of great interest.

We have recently reported the isolation and characterization of a CpG island promoter responsible for TERRA transcription, localized at several subtelomeres (Nergadze et al. RNA 2009).

We aimed to investigate the possibility to import recombinant RNA into mitochondria of living cells using a natural import system for mammalian 5S rRNA. We synthesized ssRNA probe composed of mt address, antisense sequence against 5\u00a2end of mt ND5 mRNA and fluorescent label at the 3\u00a2end. Constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells. Colocalization of the probe fluorescence with mitochondria-addressed GFP was revealed by confocal microscopy of living cells. In addition, RT-PCR analysis of the probe in isolated mitochondria confirmed its presence in the mt interior. Further use of such probes for mt fluorescent in vivo hybridization, mt gene silencing or even gene therapy of mt disorders will be discussed.

The first events occur in the osteoblastic niche and include commitment of the hemopoietic progenitor cell to megakaryopoiesis. The second step is megakaryocyte (MK) maturation and is associated with rapid cytoplasm expansion and intense synthesis of proteins. Finally MKs, which migrate to the vascular niche, convert the bulk of their cytoplasm into multiple long processes called proplatelets that protrude through the vascular endothelium into the sinusoid lumen, where the platelets are released. Growing evidence indicates that a complex regulatory mechanism, involving MK-matrix interactions, may contribute to the quiescent or permissive microenvironment related to platelet release within bone marrow. To address this hypothesis, in this work we have investigated the role of type I, IV and VI collagens in regulating MK function. Fibrillar type I collagen is the most abundant extracellular protein of the osteoblastic niche, while microfibrillar type IV and VI collagens are primary subendothelial extracellular matrix components. Human MKS (hMKs) were differentiated from cord blood derived CD34 + cells for 12 days. Mature hMKs were plated onto glass coverslips coated with type I, IV or VI collagen. Proplatelet formation (PPF) was evaluated by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy upon cell staining with anti-tubulin and CD41 antibodies. Type I, but not type IV or type VI collagen suppressed PPF. This process was triggered by the engagement of integrin alpha2beta1 through activation of Rho/ROCK pathway and myosin-IIA. Moreover, after a short incubation hMKs were spread on all collagens, while, prolonging incubation, hMKs on type IV and VI collagens returned round and started to extend proplatelets, while MKs on type I collagen remained spread and did not proceed on maturation. Overall our data represent the first evidence that hMK function on different collagens may depend on peculiar structural properties of the collagens, as well as on differences in receptor engagement.",

Evidence of in vivo palmitoylation of RBC proteins was obtained after metabolic labeling of RBCs with tritiated palmitic acid, electrophoretic separation of RBC proteins followed by weeks-long exposure times for revealing the labeled proteins by fluorography. Considerable efforts are being made to pursue alternate routes for the study of protein fatty-acylation. One such alternative is the use of bioorthogonal chemical probe analogues of fatty acids, such as omega alkynyl analogues, for metabolically labeling the cells, followed by cell lysis and chemoselective ligation of the alkynyl group to azide-tagged biotin via a Cu + catalyzed alkyne-azide (3+2) cycloaddition reaction. Subsequently, proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to PVDF membranes and visualized with streptavidin-HRP and chemiluminescence. Results obtained in this study show that the omega alkynyl analog of palmitic acid is indeed metabolically incorporated into a number of protein bands, the main of which is, as expected, p55. The method is sensitive (less than 20 microg total proteins loaded per lane) and rapid: in less than 4 days a complete result, including the hydroxylamine treatment, can be obtained, as opposed to the much longer time required by fluorography. White RBC ghosts, i.e. ghost membranes that have been carefully washed free of hemoglobin, must be used to carry out the alkyne-azide reaction: even the slightest contamination by hemoglobin interferes with the reaction. In the preparation of ghost membranes, chelating agents such as EDTA must be avoided, because they strongly interfere with the Cu + -catalyzed alkyne-azide reaction. Studies are in progress to investigate the state of palmitoylated proteins in RBCs of different age and their partition into different membrane subdomains.",

Exosite-1 [HV1hirudin(54-65), hirudin HM2(48-64), haemadin(45-57), PAR1 (50-60), and HD1 aptamer] and exosite-2 [fibrinogen c'(408-427), GpIb-a(268-282), HD22 aptamer, and heparin] binders were produced by solid-phase synthesis and their effect on thrombin recognition by active-site binders [p-aminobenzamidine (PABA) and HM2-hirudin N-terminal domain(1-47)] were evaluated by spectroscopic methods. Finally, the effect of exosite binders on thrombin catalysis was evaluated using the chromogenic substrates S-2238 (D-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA) and S-2366 (D-PyrGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA), which are taken as representative of physiological procoagulant (fibrinogen and PAR1) and anticoagulant (e.g., protein C) substrates, respectively. Our results indicate that exosite-1 binders increase the affinity of thrombin for PABA by 30-40% and for HM2(1-47) by up 70%. Conversely, exosite-2 binders do not affect affinity for PABA, but reduce affinity for HM2(1-47) by 20-30%. Notably, thrombin catalytic efficiency for S-2238 is increased by exosite-1 binders by 15-48%, whereas that for S-2366 was decreased by 4-50%. Finally, exosite-2 binders decreased catalytic efficiency either for S-2238 (2-18%) and S-2366 (1-22%). These results can be rationalized considering the different binding mode that exosite-1 and -2 binders exploit in thrombin binding and provide a model for predicting thrombin binding topology of yet uncharacterized ligands, starting from their effect on thrombin recognition and function.",

In mammals it performs essential functions as a constituent of many molecules, in fact, processes such as cell proliferation, DNA repair and energy metabolism are severely compromised in situations of shortage of this metal. Similarly, however, also excess iron has negative consequences, due to the production of highly reactive radical species, leading to a series of degenerative events affecting the major constituents of protoplasm. Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with iron accumulation in the central nervous system. Among them is aceruloplasminemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for ceruloplasmin (CP), which causes retinal degeneration, diabetes, impaired motor coordination, involuntary movements and dementia. CP is an a2-globulin of plasma, carries 95% of the serum copper and has ferroxidase activity. It is part of a system involved in the export of iron from the cells through the coordinated activity with the permease ferroportin (FPN), a transmembrane protein which is, as today, the sole exporter of the metal characterized in mammalian cells. Previous studies have shown that genetic mutations in CP lead to degradation of FPN and iron accumulation in the cells. The close relationship between the two components of the system responsible for exporting iron from cells is con-firmed by numerous experimental evidences. In light of these considerations, we present a phage display-based study aimed at identifying human proteins interacting with CP, with the aim of elucidating its structure-function relationships at molecular level.",

DnaK is an Echerichia coli Hsp70 homolog comprising a 44 kDa ATPase domain (NBD) and a 25 kDa substrate-binding domain (SBD). DnaK has two nucleotide substrate-affinity states: In the ATP-bound, low substrate-affinity, state, substrate binding and release occur rapidly, whereas in the ADP-bound high substrate-affinity state, slower substrate binding and release kinetics are observed. Communication between the two domains is essential for chaperone function and is mediated via a conserved hydrophobic linker region (384GDVKDVLLL392). Previous studies showed that truncated DnaK , containing the ATPase domain and the entire linker region, mimics the substrate-stimulated form of full-length DnaK, and also similar pH dependent ATPase profiles are observed for both proteins. Using this knowledge we aimed to understand the allosteric mechanism underlying the substrate binding effects to the ATPase domain by pinpointing the putative residues that are present in this path using DnaK . To this end, particular DnaK (1-392) mutants are created and then purified in order to see alterations in the activity and stability at different pH values. We found that replacement mutations of histidine at position 226 to either alanine or phenylalanine are critical for the activity and allostery of the ATPase domain of DnaK. Both mutations done to this site caused 3-fold enhancement in the ATPase rates for pH values of 6 to 8.5. In addition, it is seen that mutations altered the stability of the ATPase domain by lowering the first melting transition from 50oC to 48oC. In conclusion, our results suggest that either an Ala or Phe mutation to His226 site may have a role in the regulation of the ATPase domain dynamics.",

Following cleavage, split CFTR is internalized in cytoplasm in endocytic vesicles. The calpain split CFTR is constitutively accumulated in growing cells as a result of a protective effect exerted by its interaction with the chaperone HSP90. In addition to CFTR, calpain degrades other components of the ion channel-generated cluster. Among these we have demonstrated that, in both reconstructed systems and in cell models, the scaffolding protein NHERF-1 is a calpain substrate. Calpain digestion cleaves this protein in two fragments separating the PDZ-binding domains from the ezrin binding region. The disorganization in the CFTR-generated cluster, produced by this proteolysis, is followed by degradation of other substrates such as ezrin and HSP90. Following proteolysis both CFTR and NHERF-1 are recovered in internal vesicles. Although this process constitutively occurs in cell lines as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the alteration in [Ca2 + ]i of CF patients cells increases the rate of such proteolysis causing the removal of the CFTR functional cluster from plasma membranes. Preliminary results indicate that in PBMC of CF patients native CFTR is almost undetectable in plasma membranes and NHERF-1 is profoundly reduced, confirming that calpain digestion is highly enhanced in these cells. These results open a new field of studies on the role of calpain in the function of ion channel generated clusters. Digestion of these complexes by calpain could provide new insights in the understanding of the pathological role of calpain in many human diseases.",

Cytotoxicity studies involving structures formed during apomyoglobin fibrillogenesis were undertaken using cultured mouse PC12 cell line. The MTT assay revealed toxicity of prefibrillar oligomeric species (obtained upon 20 hours of incubation) and not of other intermediate structures or mature fibrils, tested after 4, 7 and 14 days of incubation.

Additionally, it has been proposed the presence of a conserved site for monovalent cations whose binding indirectly perturbs the conformation of active site residues. In ribokinase and adenosine kinase, K + activates the enzymes by increasing the affinity for the phosphate acceptor and the value of their catalytic constants. Phosphofructokinase-2 (Pfk-2), unlike other ribokinase family members, presents an additional site for MgATP that negatively regulates its enzymatic activity, but it is not known how monovalent cations affect its function. This work shows the effect of monovalent cations on the kinetic parameters of Pfk-2 together with its three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray diffraction in presence of K + or Cs + . Kinetic characterization of the enzyme shows that K + , Na + or NH4 + do not alter the kcat neither the KM values for fructose-6-P or MgATP. However, the presence of K + or NH4 + (but not Na + ) enhances the allosteric inhibition induced by MgATP. Moreover, binding experiments show that K + or NH4 + (but not Na + ) increases the affinity of MgATP in a saturable fashion. In agreement with the biochemical data, the crystallographic structure of Pfk-2 obtained in presence of MgATP shows a cation binding site on a conserved position predicted for the ribokinase family of proteins. This site is adjacent to the MgATP allosteric binding site and is only observed in presence of Cs + or K + . These results indicate that binding of the monovalent metal ions indirectly influences the allosteric site of Pfk-2 by increasing its affinity for MgATP without alteration of the catalytic active site residue's conformation.

Tanfani Dipartimento di Biochimica, Biologia e Genetica -UniversitaP olitecnica delle Marche a 1-Acid glycoprotein (AGP) is a heavily glycosilated acute phase protein belonging to the lipocalin superfamily and is the second most abundant protein in the human plasma. Its physiological levels, however, rise several folds as a consequence of stressful stimuli, such as physical trauma or bacterial infections. Although a wide number of diverse biological roles has been associated with AGP, such as drug transportation and modulation of the immune system, information on the structural mechanisms that the protein uses to exert its functions is often scarce and fragmented. In our work, we take advantage of FT-IR spectroscopy to investigate the structural features of the folded-unfolded states of AGP in terms of residual secondary/tertiary structures and structural transitions occurring upon heat-induced denaturation. Our data revealed that in neutral (pH 7.4) and mildly acidic (pH 5.5) environments, a molten globule (MG)-like state appears around 55\u00b0C, followed by complete loss of secondary structure at 80-85\u00b0C. Under acidic conditions (pH 4.5), the MG-like state is reached at lower temperatures (40-45\u00b0C) and the thermal stability is markedly compromised. Interestingly, renaturation occurred at pH 7.4 and 10.0 only, whilst irreversible aggregation upon loss of the secondary structure was observed at pH 4.5 and 5.5. Under reducing conditions, no MG-like state was observed at any of the above pH values, whilst the aggregation propensity increased with acidity, suggesting that hydrophobic regions are more easily exposed following reduction of the two disulfide bridges. In addition, fluorescence measurements revealed that formation of MG-like states in AGP is accompanied by a decrease in the binding affinity for a set of representative drugs. These results stress the importance of the disulfide bridges in maintaining the native structure and suggest a possible mechanism of ligand-release through the formation of MG-like states.",

Fatty acid oxidation deficiencies are an important group of metabolic disorders that arise from genetic defects in components of this pathway, and for many of these proteins, different polymorphic variants have been described, apart from disease causing mutations. In particular, a variation at position 171 on the alpha-subunit of ETF has been identified, as a result of a single nucleotide polymorphism which leads to the incorporation of either a threonine or a isoleucine. Interestingly, patients suffering from very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) have an overrepresentation of the ETFa-T171 variant, suggesting that this polymorphism may influence the phenotype, by an as yet unknown molecular mechanism [1] . Here we report a study which investigates the effect of the variation of the ETFa-T/I171 polymorphism on the ETF folding and kinetic stability. Both variants have comparable thermodynamic stabilities, but ETFa-T171 displays increased susceptibility to cofactor (FAD) loss and enhanced kinetics of inactivation during thermal stress [2] . Also this variant exhibits an increased conformational dynamics during thermal stress mimicking a fever episode in vitro: upon 2 hours at 39\u00b0C, ETFa-T171 looses half of its activity, whereas that of ETFa-I171 remains at~85%. This can be rescued by GroEL, which captures and refolds thermally destabilised ETFa-T171 [2] . This polymorphic position thus determines the conformational landscape and protein function under thermal stress, a common metabolic stressor in mitochondrial beta oxidation defects. ",

Here we report on electrophoretic, spectroscopic, and computational studies aimed at clarifying at atomic level the electrostatics of folded and unfolded BLG with a detailed characterization of the specific amino acids involved. Discrepancy between electrophoretic and spectroscopic evidence suggests that changes in mobility in DGGE is not just the result of changes in gyration radius upon unfolding. ETC runs across the 3.5-9 pH range in the presence of urea concentrations between 0 and 8 M suggest that more than one residue in the protein may have anomalous pKa values in native BLG. Detailed computational studies indicate a shift in pKa of Glu44, Glu89, and Glu114 due mainly to changes in global and local desolvation. For His161 the formation of hydrogen bond(s) could add up to desolvation contributions. However, since His161 is at the C-terminus, the end-effect associated to the solvated form can also influence its pKa value. DGGE evidence also indicates a shift of the isoelectric point of BLG-B from 4.8 (no urea) to 5.2 (8 M urea) . Interestingly, at 4 M urea -that is, below the Cm required for macroscopic structural changes (5.5-6 M urea) -the value of pI is already increased to 5, suggesting that relevant structural transitions occur prior to the denaturation process. This may offer a further clue to explaining the apparently contradictory features of BLG, which shows remarkable stability to pH extremes and denaturants as a whole but also shows remarkable flexibility in the interactions between secondary structure elements upon physical and chemical denaturation.",

Renalase has been proposed to be a catecholamine-degrading enzyme, either through an oxidative or a NADH-dependent mechanism. We have previously shown that renalase is a flavoprotein containing non-covalently bound FAD as prosthetic group (4) . With the aim to shed light on the mechanism of its action, here we report on the interaction of the human protein with NAD and NADP, both in oxidized and reduced form, as potential cosubstrates of its enzymatic activity. Human renalase displays very low but significant NADH-and NADPH-diaphorase activities, with a marked preference for tetrazolium salts in comparison to other conventional dehydrogenase substrates as electron acceptors. The catalysis of these reactions involve the enzyme-bound FAD, as shown by presteady state studies in which we observed hydride-transfer from NAD(P)H to the prosthetic group. Renalase displays a higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) but a lower kcat in the oxidation of NADH with respect to that of NADPH. By spectroscopy techniques we found that the binding of either NAD+ or NADP+ to renalase significantly alters the polarity of the environment of the FAD isoalloxazine, and that the nicotinamide moiety of the ligand is essential to elicit such effect. The possible localization of the NAD(P)-binding site in the renalase molecule will be discussed in the framework of the enzyme crystal structure (our data to be published). In a majority of living organisms FoF1 ATP synthase performs the fundamental process of ATP synthesis. Despite exhaustive chemical and crystal structure studies, the details of the step-bystep mechanism of the reaction yet remains to be resolved owing to the complexity of this multisubunit enzyme. On the basis of quantum mechanical calculations we investigated the reaction mechanism how ATP could be produced from ADP in the active site. We conclude that formation of the P-O bond may be achieved through a transition state (TS) with a planar PO3-ion [1] . Results also indicate that during ATP synthesis the enzyme first prepares the inorganic phosphate for the c P-O(ADP) bond-forming step via a double proton transfer. At this step the highly conserved a S344 side chain plays a catalytic role. The reaction thereafter progresses through the transition state (TS) with planar PO3-ion configuration to finally form ATP [2] . These two TSs are concluded crucial for ATP synthesis. Using stepwise scans and several models of the nucleotide-bound active site, some of the most important conformational changes were traced towards direction of synthesis. Interestingly, as the active site geometry progresses towards the ATP-favoring tight binding site, at both of these TSs a dramatic increase in barrier heights is observed for the reverse direction, i.e. hydrolysis of ATP. This could indicate a 'ratchet' mechanism for the enzyme to ensure efficacy of ATP synthesis by shifting residue conformation and thus locking access to the crucial Tss. Although endosomal compartments have been suggested to play a role in unconventional protein secretion, there is scarce experimental evidence for such involvement. Here we report that recycling endosomes are essential for externalization of cytoplasmic secretory protein tissue transglutaminase (tTG). The de novo synthesized cytoplasmic tTG does not follow the classical ER/Golgidependent secretion pathway, but is targeted to perinuclear recycling endosomes, and is delivered inside these vesicles prior to externalization. On its route to the cell surface tTG interacts with internalized beta1 integrins inside the recycling endosomes and is externalized as a complex with recycled beta1 integrins. Inactivation of recycling endosomes, blocking endosome fusion with the plasma membrane, or downregulation of Rab11 GTPase that controls outbound trafficking of perinuclear recycling endosomes, all abrogate tTG secretion. The initial recruitment of cytoplasmic tTG to recycling endosomes and subsequent externalization depend on its binding to phosphoinositides on endosomal membranes. These findings begin to unravel the unconventional mechanism of tTG secretion which utilizes the long loop of endosomal recycling pathway and indicate involvement of endosomal trafficking in non-classical protein secretion.",

            "text": "Advances in the molecular recognition mechanism of p63 by itch-e3 ligase are mediated by these domains, have been implicated in human diseases (Muscular Dystrophy, Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington Disease etc.). Itch contains four WW domains, which are essential for the target recognition process. These domains are highly compact protein-protein binding modules that interact with short proline-rich sequences and are considered belonging to the Group I of the domains binding polypeptides with a PY motif. It is likely that the Itch-p63 interaction results from a direct binding of Itch-WW2 domain with the PY motif of p63. Previously, we have evaluated the effects of a site specific mutation of p63, that has reported in both Hay-Wells syndrome and Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome, both on the conformation of pep63 and on the Itch-WW2-pep63 interaction and an extended PPxY motif for the Itch recognition was proposed. Here, we present a structural characterization of the interaction by fluorescence, CD and NMR spectroscopy of the Itch-WW2 domain. 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments with uniformly 13C, 15N-labelled Itch-WW2 were recorded to assign the backbone and side chains. Interaction studies between Itch-WW2 domain and pep63, an 18-mer peptide encompassing a fragment of the p63 protein including the PY motif, were performed in vitro, and the residues of Itch-WW2 involved in the interaction with pep63 were identified. Moreover, a cyclization of pep63 was performed and the binding with Itch-WW2 was analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The cyclization of the peptide leads an increase of both the resistance to proteases cleavage and to the ability of the peptide to bind the WW2 domain. Thus, the data here presented suggest the possibility to use the cyclic form of pep63 for an in vivo inhibition of the recognition mechanism of Itch E3-ligase. In spite of the repair process, lesions appear in DNA throughout the cell cycle, including the S phase. The main strategy used by eukaryotic cells for replication of damaged DNA is translesion synthesis (TLS). In this study we investigated TLS activity of the human X-family DNA polymerases (pols) beta and lambda. Using kinetic approaches, we investigated DNA synthesis on DNA duplexes containing different lesions resulted from the oxidative stress -abasic site, oxoguanine and thymine glycol. Since translesion synthesis is taking place directly in the replication complex, we investigated the influence of replication factors hPCNA and hRPA on TLS catalyzed by DNA pols beta and lambda. Further, to discriminate the surrounding proteins that could potentially act during TLS in the cell we applied the photoaffinity labelling approach for modification of Bovine Testis (BT) and HeLa (RC) extract proteins. We found a limited number of modification products among the general pool of proteins. It was confirmed: (i) by Western blotting that the RC 75-80 kDa crosslinking product is the covalent adduct of DNA to pol lambda; (ii) by immunoprecipitation with human antibodies that the BT 105 kDa crosslinking product is PARP1. Therefore, based on experimental data, DNA pols beta and lambda can be proposed as a specialized DNA polymerase in TLS across oxidative lesions during genome DNA replication on the leading of lagging strands of genomic DNA. Both enzymes can be a components of TLS machine not only during the first stage of the process (i.e. incorporation of dNMP opposite damage) but on the stage of processing of uncomplementary 3'-end of the primer. Transcription is governed by a variety of sequence-specific transcription factors, binding to DNA sequences in promoters and enhancers, acting in the context of chromatin. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, built by 146 DNA bp wrapped around histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4, organized as heterodimers in an octameric structure. NF-Y is a conserved heterotrimer binding with high specificity to the common CCAAT sequence, located at -80 with respect to the transcription start site2. Two subunits, NF-YB and NF-YC, are histone-like. We solved the crystal structure of the NF-Y trimer in complex with a 25 bp oligonucleotide containing the target sequence (Space Group orthorhombic P212121, one complex molecule per asymmetric unit, 3.2 \u00c5 resolution, R-free 30.5%, R-gen 24.5%; data collected at the ESRF beam line ID29) using a composite molecular replacement approach. NF-YB and NF-YC subunits interact with the DNA phosphates similarly to H2A-H2B in the nucleosome, with conserved residues in the a1 and L2 loops of the histone fold domains. NF-YA contacts the histone-like heterodimer along the NF-YC aC and NF-YB a2 helices, through a nestled N-terminal a-helix. An extended polypeptide stretch links such helix to a C-terminal NF-YA helix that makes sequence-specific contacts to the CCAAT box. This (specific) contact widens the DNA minor groove and heavily distorts the double helix, with local scrambling of Watson-Crick base pairing. Overall, 35 residues, distributed through the three protein subunits, contact DNA and bend it in a way reminiscent of the histone octamer in the nucleosome. The NF-Y/DNA complex structure is perfectly consistent with the extensive mutagenesis and biochemical characterization data currently available on NF-Y assembly and DNA recognition. Our results detail the unusual features of a sequence-specific histone-like complex that plays a central role in transcription, thus interfacing the transcriptional apparatus with the nucleosome.",

Peroxiredoxin I (PrxI) is under investigation. In the detoxification pathway of Schistosoma mansoni, Thioredoxin (SmTrx) plays a central role being reduced by TGR and oxidised by PrxI and other detoxifying enzymes. Hereby we present the 3D structure of SmTrx in three states: the wild type oxidised adult enzyme, and the oxidised and reduced forms of a juvenile isoform carrying a N-terminal extension (3) . SmTrx shows a typical Trx fold, highly similar to the other members of the superfamily. It can reduce oxidised glutathione (kcat = 0.085 sec -1 , Km = 253.5 lM) and is one of the few defence proteins expressed in mature eggs and in the hatch fluid. Although in itself unlikely to be a reasonable drug target, being highly homologous to the human counterpart, SmTrx completes the characterization of the whole set of thiol-mediated detoxification pathway proteins. We believe that availability of its 3D structure may provide a clue for the formation of granulomas in the chronic phase of the disease and may help to design more specific antibodies for new diagnostic tests. The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi when transmitted from ticks to mammals can change the overall outer surface protein expression pattern in response to temperature difference or mammalian host-specific signals. The expression of outer surface protein Bb0689 has been shown to be temperature and host-specific signal dependent and is up-regulated during tick feeding, indicating on its potential role in the pathogenesis of B.burgdorferi. A gene coding for B.burgdorferi outer surface protein Bb0689 was amplified from B.burgdorferi strain B31 and expressed in E.coli C2566(DE3) using pET expression systems vector with integrated six histidine tag and TEV protease cleavage site (EMBL). Cells were lysed by sonication and the recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose and ion-exchange chromatography. Conditions for protein crystallization were searched by using sparse-matrix screening and vapor-diffusion method in sitting drops. At least 200 initial conditions were screened and protein crystals were obtained in several cases which were further optimized by trying different condition variants. Successful expression and crystallization of B.burgdorferi outer surface protein Bb0689 will likely provide the opportunity to find out more about the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. X-ray data collection and three-dimensional structure determination for Bb0689 is under way. Influenza is one of the viral infection which is a significant global public health concern because of the morbidity and mortality associated with the acute respiratory disease. In recent years, influenza vaccines have been designed based on the fact that the extracellular domain of M2 protein is nearly invariant in all influenza A strains [1] [2] [3] . The use of proteins and synthetic antigens as vaccines has several potential advantages over whole viral or bacterial preparations but in order to elicit the maximum immunogenic response from synthetic peptide antigens, it is generally necessary to bind the peptide to a carrier molecule as protein, hapten or polymer [4, 5] . Biodegradable water-soluble polyelectrolytes have been widely used to modify proteins via covalent attachment [6] , increasing (or reducing) the immunoreactivity and/or immunogenicity of originally antigenic proteins, and improving their in vivo stability with prolonged clearance times. Besides, the conjugates of PE with individual microbe antigens develop strong protective properties and they can be considered as a new generation of vaccinating compounds [5] . Aim of our study is to develop a synthetic polyelectrolyte-peptide based system against Influenza A Virus. For this purpose, an antigenic peptide epitope of the exact region of M2 protein is used to producing peptide/polyelectrolyte bioconjugates. These bioconjugates were synthesized by using various carbodiimide activation methods as well as different initial molar ratios (npeptide/npolymer) of the peptide molecule. For the conjugation reactions, a water soluble carbodiimide which is widely used in the synthesis of peptides and hapten-protein and protein-protein conjugates, were chosen as a crosslinker molecule. After the conjugation reactions, physicochemical properties of the bioconjugates and the interaction between antigenic peptide of M2 protein and polyelectrolyte were investigated by spectroscopic and chromatographic methods.",

The plasticity of chromatin is governed by multi-subunit protein complexes that enzymatically regulate chromosomal structure and activity. Such complexes include ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling factors that are involved in many fundamental processes such as transcription, DNA repair, replication, and chromosome structure maintenance. Enzymes that control chromatin dynamics can be broadly divided into two groups: enzymes that covalently modify histones and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes. (i) Chromatin-remodeling enzymes use the energy of ATP to alter the structure or positioning of nucleosomes, thus modulating the access of regulatory proteins to DNA. The activity of chromatin remodeling enzymes, can be regulated by other proteins and they typically function as subunits of multiprotein complexes. One of the most highly conserved ATPases involved in chromatin remodeling is imitation SWI (ISWI). The variety of functions associated with ISWI activity are probably connected to the ability of other cellular factors to regulate its ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling activity. (ii) Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase PARP-1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme that, when activated by DNA damage, consumes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ to form poly(ADP-ribose) on specific acceptor proteins; Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of chromatin protein causes major changes in nucleosomal architecture by the covalent modification of histone.",

These enzymes are generally synthesized as precursor proteins, which undergo an intra-molecular autocatalytic cleavage yielding a large and a small subunit [1] . Although c-GTs have been studied in terms of molecular structures and biochemical properties [1] [2] [3] , very little is known about their folding/unfolding mechanisms and pathways. This characterization is, in part, hampered by the fact that the purified c-GTs are often a mixture of the unprocessed and mature protein. As a first step toward the study of the folding/unfolding mechanism of c-GTs, we have investigated the conformational stability of the T353A mutant of the c-GT from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans (GthGT) by means of circular dichroism. This mutant represents a mimic of the precursor form, as Thr353 is conserved in all c-GTs and is responsible for enzyme autoprocessing. The T fi A substitution results in an unprocessed homotetrameric enzyme that has a folded conformation (a -helix content: 30-32%, b-strands content: 18-20%). The mutant is poor of transpeptidase activity, while keeping a significant hydrolase activity. Its thermal unfolding is an irreversible three-states process: the melting curves present two inflection points indicative of two temperature-induced transitions. The values of the apparent melting temperature for the two transitions are 66.5 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C and 88 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, respectively. These data support the hypothesis that the precursor form of GthGT assumes a compact and stable conformation to resist to the extreme environments where G. thermodenitrificans lives. Moreover, the thermostability of the protein could be useful to exploit this enzyme as a glutaminase in food industry. P03.30 C-terminal truncation of human flavin containing monooxygenase 3: combining molecular modelling with protein engineering mized and refined model is used for docking experiments to show how known substrates bind the catalytic site of the enzyme. Based on the hydrophobic nature of the carboxyl terminus, it was hypothesized that this region could function as a membrane anchor. Therefore, a C-terminal truncated form of hFMO3 (tr-hFMO3) was engineered at DNA level and subsequently cloned, expressed in E. coli and purified in order to compare its solubility and activity with that of the full-length wild type enzyme. The tr-hFMO3 was purified from the cytosolic fraction whereas the wild type protein was purified from the membrane fraction. Furthermore, catalysis experiments with the tr-hFMO3 showed that this enzyme is fully active and carries out the monooxygenation of substrates such as sulindac sulfide, benzydamine, tozasertib and danusertib. The results from docking experiments together with the success in rational design of the soluble and active tr-hFMO3 support the validity of the presented hFMO3 model.",

            "text": "Hyperphenylalaninemias (HPAs) are genetic diseases prevalently caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The wild-type PAH protein is about 52 kDa, and in the mature form, it is assembled as a homotetramer. The tetrameric and dimeric forms are in equilibrium and have different catalytic properties. We previously conducted a molecular analysis of the PAH gene in HPA patients from Southern Italy and characterized several novel mutations 1,2. In the present study, we reproduced, by in vitro mutagenesis, the wild-type PAH protein and p.Q301P, a severe mutant found in a compound heterozygous patient affected by the HPAI phenotype. We characterized the purified proteins after expressing them in E. coli and after removal of all maltose-binding protein (MBP). We analyzed the proteins' biochemical and biophysical behaviour by enzyme activity assay, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), light scattering and circular dichroism. We performed our analysis on the full-length cleaved PAH and, for comparison purposes, on the wild-type protein fused to MBP. We identified a hitherto unknown feature of the wildtype enzyme, namely, it contains the monomer in equilibrium with the dimer and tetramer, the latter being the most predominant species. The p.Q301P mutant exhibited a much lower enzymatic activity (8%) than the wild-type enzyme (100%). Moreover, biophysical characterization showed loss of secondary structure and thermal destabilization. The SEC profile of p.Q301P revealed a preponderance of high molecular weight oligomers, no tetramer and a small percentage of dimers in the equilibrium mixture. These results demonstrate that the oligomerization process and thermal stability are altered by the p.Q301P mutation, thereby endorsing the hypothesis that oligomerization and folding defects are among the most common causes of HPAs P03.32 Investigation of heat-and chemical-induced change of bovine serum albumin by ft-raman spectroscopy W. Chen and C.-H. Wang Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiayi University BSA consists of 582 amino acids residues with an average molecular mass of 66 kDa sequenced into a single polypeptide chain. It is characterized by an overall oblate shape and organized into three domains with 17 intrachain disulfide bonds and one free thiol group at residue 34. The secondary structure of BSA was reported approximately 54% in a-helix and 40% in b-form. The conformation of BSA is susceptible to thermal and chemical denaturation. Whether those features correlate to the extraordinarily high content of disulfide bond in BSA draws much interest. In this report, FT-Raman was employed to elucidate the effect of heat-and chemical-induced denaturation on the conformational change of BSA and in turn to clarify the critical role of disulfide bonds on protein stability. Raman results indicated that the proportion of a-helical structure decreased concomitantly with the increment of b-structure when BSA was heated at 100 oC. In addition, Raman spectra of BSA treated with different protein denaturants including urea, dithiothreitol (DTT), and iodoacetoamide were demonstrated. Raman spectra explicitly illustrated the critical role of disulfide bond in protein aggregation. Apparently, BSA was unfolded in urea solution which resulted in those disulfide bonds exposed and more accessible to reducing agents of DTT. In consequence, all disulfide bonds were reduced and changed into sulfhydryl groups. Under such conditions, the a-helical structure is disrupted and the b-structure is formed. Besides, such conformational change of BSA is irreversible.",

However, little is known about ultrasound effects on proteins of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Investigations in this field are important for corresponding pharmacotherapy and determination of safe modes of US treatment. We investigate the effects of ultrasound on the fibrinogen, fibrin and their proteolysis. It was shown, that US did not cause the cleavage of peptide and interchain disulfide bonds or formation of interchain and intermolecular cross-links in the case of fibrin and fibrinogen. As well, the results suggested that the US does not induce the conformational changes, which lead to the exposure of a new plasmin-sensitive site. It has been shown that under ultrasound treatment of plasminogen and/or t-PA in the presence of fibrinogen from the one hand the stabilizing effect fibrinogen on given proteins was shown, on the other hand an increase in the lysis rate due to both the change in the substrate structure and promoting of the protein-protein complexes formation. In turn, with the use of urokinase or streptokinase US did note have significant influence on the plasminolysis rate. As in the case of fibrinogen, US-treatment lead to the increase rate of proteolysis, both in the case of processing the clot itself and clot in the presence of plasminogen and/or plasminogen activators. It has been established that US contributes to deep penetration t-PA inside the clot. In this case the proteolysis took place in entire volume of clot and, respectively, the larger fragments were released into solution than in the control experiment, where the step-by-step hydrolysis of fibrin was occurred.",

Tyrosinase and other ER-synthesized proteins follow the proteasome associated degradation as a disposal tool to overcome the accumulation of misfolded or incompletely folded proteins in the ER. Prior studies have shown that tyrosinase mutants ST-474 and ST-405 are ERAD (Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation) substrates, retained in the ER, representing good candidates for proteasomal degradation and antigen presentation in the context of MHC I. In our studies we focus on the processing of tyrosinase mutants that enables the antigen presentation and T cell recognition and explore the possibility of using these mutants to obtain a melanoma treatment. For this purpose we used several C-terminal truncated tyrosinase mutants and single N-glycosylation mutants in order to determine cellular processing and antigen production. For all these mutants we determined cellular processing and ER-retention by different techniques, subsequently testing their potential as ERAD substrates. Proteins degraded through ERAD increase the expression of MHC I at the cell surface due to high production of antigenic peptides that recruit T cells. Variations in the expression of MHC molecule (HLA A2) at the cell surface and total MHC (HLA ABC), for cells transiently expressing tyrosinase mutants, were assessed by FACS experiments. In conclusion, some tyrosinase mutants are retained in the ER, whilst others achieve complex glycans and exit the ER, displaying different antigenicities with nearly all antigenic peptides presented at the cell surface in complex with HLA A2. Further these mutants will be used for various experiments to determine the efficiency of MHC I and T cell presentation using different modulators to increase the antigenic potential and respectively the immune response.",

Bacteria can detoxify chalcogens by methylation or reduction. In Escherichia coli one of the mechanisms requires two gene products, TehA and TehB. The TehA protein is an inner membrane protein that has been proposed to participate in the detoxification mechanism. The Haemophilus influenzae TehA structure has been determined and has been shown to form a trimeric channel. The clear role of TehA in E.coli is unclear; we have obtained initial x-ray diffraction at~6\u00c5 for E.coli TehA and channel measurements are under way. The enzyme TehB can detoxify chalcolgens by methylation. We have determined the structure of the TehB from Escherichia coli in the presence of the co-factor analogues S-adenosylhomocysteine and sinefungin at 1.48 \u00c5 and 1.9 \u00c5 respectively. The Kinetic data show that TehB does not discriminate between chalcolgen oxyanions, making it a very powerful detoxifying protein. Based on the structure and kinetic data we propose an SN2 nucleophilic attack reaction mechanism for detoxification of chalcolgens. This data provides the first molecular understanding on the detoxification of chalcogens by bacteria. Chagas' disease is one of the most important neglected diseases of Latin America, caused by the kinetoplastid protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. Calpains are cysteine peptidases, described in a broad range of organisms, which are believed to be crucial in several basic cellular functions. In this sense, calpain-like molecules present in T. cruzi may participate in metacyclogenesis and interaction with the invertebrate host. Herein, we described the effects of the calpain inhibitor (MDL28170) on the adhesion of T. cruzi epimastigotes in the luminal midgut surface of the insect vector Rhodnius prolixus; on the differentiation process of epimastigotes into metacyclic trypomastigotes; on the viability of bloodstream trypomastigotes; and on the ultrastructure of epimastigotes. Additionally, we demonstrated that anti-calpain antibodies were also capable of reducing the attachment of the epimastigotes to the insect gut, but had no effect on metacyclogenesis. These data may contribute for the study of the functions of T. cruzi calpains and add new insights into the possibility of using calpain inhibitors in treating parasitic infections, since they interfere in key parts of the parasite life cycle. Cytochrome P450 enzymes form a family of b-type haem-thiolate proteins that carry out the monooxygenation of a large number of endogenous and exogenous compounds using NADPH as the electron donor. The electron equivalents that are not utilized to oxidize the substrate in the P450 reaction cycle lead to the uncoupling process and production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, understanding the uncoupling at the haem active site and/or at the level of multi-domain electron transfer is an important element in cytochrome P450 chemistry. In this work, a chimeric model system consisting of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and the soluble reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium (BMR) is used to study the relationship between electron transfer and the coupling efficiency in substrate monooxygenation. Several regulatory features were considered including pH, ionic strength, concentration of exogenous cofactors (FAD and FMN) together with the length of the linker joining the two domains of the 3A4-BMR chimeric enzyme. This linker has been proposed to function as a flexible hinge between the two domains and could provide the chimeric enzyme with the degree of freedom required to fold correctly. The relevance of the linker and the importance of the flexibility of this region are considered as a critical and crucial parameter to affect the uncoupling of the electron flow. The ability of the reductase and haem domains of the 3A4-BMR chimera to form an active complex was evaluated by altering the length of the linker region through introduction of a chain of 3 or alternatively 5 glycine residues. ClpB is a hexameric molecular chaperone that, together with the DnaK system, has the ability to disaggregate stress-denatured proteins. The hexamer is a highly dynamic complex, able to reshuffle subunits. To further characterize the biological implications of the ClpB oligomerization state, the association equilibrium of the wild-type (wt) protein and of two deletion mutants, which lack part or the whole M domain, was quantitatively analyzed under different experimental conditions, using several biophysical [analytical ultracentrifugation, composition-gradient (CG) static light scattering, and circular dichroism] and biochemical (ATPase and chaperone activity) methods. We have found that (i) ClpB self-associates from monomers to form hexamers and higher-order oligomers that have been tentatively assigned to dodecamers, (ii) oligomer dissociation is not accompanied by modifications of the protein secondary structure, (iii) the M domain is engaged in intersubunit interactions that stabilize the protein hexamer, and (iv) the nucleotide-induced rearrangement of ClpB affects the protein oligomeric core, in addition to the proposed radial extension of the M domain. The difference in the stability of the ATP-and ADP-bound states [DDG(ATP-ADP) = 10 kJ/mol] might explain how nucleotide exchange promotes the conformational change of the protein particle that drives its functional cycle.",

In rat brain, ThTP is synthesized in mitochondria by a chemiosmotic mechanism and it is though that its cytosolic concentration is controlled by a specific soluble 25 kDa thiamine triphosphatase (ThTPase) an enzyme that belongs to the CYTH protein superfamily. CYTH proteins are present in all superkingdoms of life though, in many instances, their substrate and physiological roles remain undefined. All of them bind triphosphorylated substrates and divalent cations. The crystal structure of several CYTH proteins has been determined. In most cases, the active site is located in an eight-stranded beta-barrel forming a closed tunnel. We use multiple sequence alignments of known ThTPases from different organisms to identify strictly conserved residues and perform site directed mutagenesis. The K65A mutation results in a drastic decrease in the activity of the enzyme without affecting the Km, suggesting that this residue is important for catalysis. We obtained the crystal structure of human ThTPase as a co-crystal with inorganic triphosphate. This allowed us to identify R57 R65, R143 and R125 as those residues important for phosphate binding. By docking of the thiamine diphosphate molecule in the active site, it appeared that W53 interacts with the pyrimidine part of thiamine. Indeed, the Km of the W53A mutated enzyme was increased by two to three orders of magnitude compared with the non-mutated enzyme, suggesting that this residue is important for substrate recognition and binding. Finally, we identified D147 and K193 as important for maintaining a closed beta-barrel structure. These data allow us to propose a coherent model of the structure function relationship of 25 kDa ThTPase.",

Increased cadmium resistance was also conferred to other stress-related yeast mutants and to wild-type cells.

By yeast two hybrid screening, using OmFCR as bait against a genomic S. cerevisiae library as prey, two proteins were identified as OmFCR interactors: Mlh3p and Mas1p. Mlh3p is part of the mismatch repair system, a cellular target for cadmium, while Mas1p is the minor subunit of an important mitochondrial metalloprotease.

            "text": "Tyrosine phosphorylation turns alkaline transition into a biologically relevant process and makes human cytochrome c behave as an anti-apoptotic switch Cytochrome c is a key protein in cell life (respiration) and cell death (apoptosis). On one hand, it serves as a mitochondrial redox carrier, so transferring electrons between the membraneembedded complexes III and IV. On the other hand, it acts as a cytoplasmic apoptosis-triggering agent, so forming the apoptosome with Apaf-1 and activating the caspase cascade. The two functions of cytochrome c are finely tuned by phosphorylation of tyrosines and, in particular, of those located at positions 48 and 97. However, the specific cytochrome c-phosphorylating kinase is still unkown. To study the structural and functional changes induced by tyrosine phosphorylation in cytochrome c, we study here the two phosphomimetic mutants Y48E and Y97E, in which each tyrosine residue is replaced by glutamate. Such substitutions alter both the physicochemical features and function of the mutants as compared with the native protein. Y97E is significantly less stable than the WT species, whereas Y48E does not only exhibit lower values for alkaline transition pKa and midpoint redox potential but also impairs Apaf-1-mediated caspase activation. Altogether, these findings suggest that the specific phosphorylation of Tyr48 makes cytochrome c act as an antiapoptotic switch. Cellular DNA is affected by ionizing irradiation, oxidizing, and alkylating agents, with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites being more frequently damages. It is known that Saccharomyces cerevisiae AP endonuclease 1 (Apn1) is the major apurinic/apyrimidinic activity incising phosphodiester backbone 5\u00a2 to the AP site. There are not any structural data concerning Apn1 and its complex with DNA up to date. In the present study dynamic properties of Apn1 and DNA substrates were investigated by stopped-flow method. Conformational rearrangements in protein were observed by measurements of changes in fluorescence of tryptophan residues; 2-aminopurine (2-aPu) and pyrrolocytosine (pyrC) residues were integrated in different strands of DNA, for detection of conformational dynamics of both strands. The 12bp DNA duplexes containing dG residue either natural AP site or its tetrahydrofuran analogue were employed as non-specific and specific substrates for the Apn1. In view of the fact that Apn1 structural data are unavailable, our results give the evidence that three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is rigid and preformed to bind the substrate. However, spatial structure of DNA substrate is changed with time upon the interaction with Apn1. Pre-steady state kinetics of repair process catalyzed with Apn1 was studied and rate constants of each elementary step were fitted by global non-linear fitting. It was shown that both DNA strands are involved into the enzyme -substrate interaction. The work is supported by RFBR Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE) is a multifunctional enzyme. It's main endonuclease activity incises DNA near AP site during the base excision repair (BER). One of APE's addition functions is 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which is most effective for DNA duplexes containing modified or mismatched nucleotides at the 3' end of the primer. There is a presumption that APE can correct the DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase b (pol b) during BER. The interaction of APE and pol b with different DNA structures was investigated by gel retardation assay and photoaffinity labeling. Photoaffinity labeling of APE and pol b was accomplished by DNA containing photoreactive group at the 3\u00a2-end in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell extract or for purified proteins. Modification efficiency was the same for MEF-extract proteins as for purified APE and pol b depending on the nature of the 5\u00a2-group of a nick/gap in the DNA substrate. Some of DNA duplexes used in this work can be considered as short-patch (DNA with the 5\u00a2-phosphate group in the nick/gap) or long-patch (DNA containing 5\u00a2-sugar phosphate or 5\u00a2-flap) BER intermediates. Other DNA duplexes (3\u00a2-recessed DNA and DNA with the 5\u00a2-hydroxyl group in the nick/gap) have no relation to intermediates forming in the course of BER. As shown by both methods, APE binds with the highest efficiency to DNA substrate containing 5\u00a2-sugar phosphate group in the nick/ gap, whereas pol b binds to DNA duplex with a 1 nucleotide gap flanked by the 5\u00a2-p group. When APE and pol b are both present, a ternary complex APE-pol b-DNA is formed with the highest efficiency with DNA product of APE endonuclease activity and with DNA containing 5\u00a2-flap or 5\u00a2-p flanking 1 nucleotide gap. It was found that APE stimulates DNA synthesis catalyzed by pol b. Effects of other proteins on APE were also investigated. It was determined that RPA inhibits APE 3\u00a2-5\u00a2 exonuclease activity and XRCC1 stimulates this activity on 3\u00a2-recessed DNA duplex. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that occurs in genetically predisposed people. It is caused by an inflammatory response to certain peptides of prolamines from wheat, rye and barley grains, which are resistant to human digestive peptidases. The only effective treatment currently available to a patient is lifelong strict dietary exclusion of prolamine-containing products. The prolamines of wheat grains, gliadins, also serve as the main natural dietary proteins of Tenebrio molitor, a stored-product pest. So a specific digestive system of this insect includes peptidases capable of splitting prolamines, and can serve as a source of enzymes hydrolyzing resistant gliadin peptides. Prolamines contain up to 50% of glutamine residues. So our search for a specific gliadin-hydrolyzing enzyme was concentrated on post-glutamine hydrolyzing peptidases (PGP) of T. molitor larvae. The major PGP activity with the substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Gln-pNA in the midgut of T. molitor belonged to the major cysteine peptidase TmCP1. This peptidase was isolated and identi-fied by MS/MS analysis as cathepsin B. The substrate specificity of TmCP1 was presented by the following series: Z-Phe-Arg-pNA > Z-Arg-Arg-pNA > Glp-Phe-Ala-pNA > Z-Ala-Ala-Gln-pNA > Glp-Val-Ala-pNA > Bz-Arg-pNA. The minor PGP activity belonged to TmCP2 identified as cathepsin L. The series of hydrolysis efficiency for cathepsin L was presented by Z-Phe-Arg-pNA > Glp-Phe-Ala-pNA = Glp-Val-Ala-pNA > Z-Ala-Ala-Gln-pNA = Z-Arg-Arg-pNA = Bz-Arg-pNA. Hydrolysis of autoimmune peptides from a-and x-gliadins by both T. molitor cathepsins was studied in comparison with mammalian cathepsins B and L using their fluorogenic analogues. Gliadin peptides were cleaved only by cathepsins L, and both peptides were hydrolyzed with comparable efficiency only by T. molitor cathepsin L. So this enzyme has a potential for oral administration to treat celiac disease. This work was supported by the RFBR. The main component of mammalian translation apparatus eEF1A is also involved in other cellular processes and interacts with a number of non-translational ligands including signaling proteins. eEF1A is considered to be a very important link connecting different cellular processes in cytoplasm. Two 97% homologous isoforms, eEF1A1 (A1) and eEF1A2 (A2), are found in higher vertebrates, their expression being tissue and development specific. Putative oncogenic properties of eEF1A2 were described, however, no mechanism for cancer-related discrimination of the two isoforms was proposed. We have compared the functional and structural properties of A1 and A2 using several biochemical and biophysical approaches. Testing the isoforms in translation and tRNA channeling has not revealed an obvious difference though A2 has higher affinity to GDP than GTP, to uncharged tRNA and is less active in translation system as compared with A1. As for non canonical functions, A2 was found to possess higher ability than A1 to interact with SH2 and SH3 domains of various signalling molecules. A striking difference is that eEF1A1 has considerable affinity to Ca2+/calmodulin while no in vitro complex with Ca2+/calmodulin was found for eEF1A2. The most important difference has been found for spatial structures of the isoforms using sedimentation analysis, multiple molecular dynamics simulation, differential scanning microcalorimetry, circular dihroizm and small angle X-ray scattering. A1 has been shown to possess significantly more extended structure than A2. Besides, A1 showed about 10-fold higher hydrophobicity coefficient than A2. The difference in the molecule conformation and surface hydrophobicity could influence the ability of A2 to interact with certain signaling proteins that may be related to its oncogenesity upon appearance in the tissues where only A1 is expressed normally.",

The availability of a fast method able to measure substrate binding to these enzymes is an important target for rapid screening of various classes of compounds. The heme domain of cytochrome P450 BM3 (BMP) and two site directed mutants (C62S and C156S) were used as a model system for sitespecific labeling with the fluorescent probe IANBD amide. Ligand binding studies were carried out using known substrates such as arachidonic acid (AA) and propranolol (PRP). AA is one of the physiological substrates of P450 BM3 and binding can be optically detected by the low-to-high spin shift from 419 to 397 nm of the Soret peak. On the other hand PRP is a non-physiological substrate of P450 BM3 and its binding does not give rise to the spin shift. Here we investigate as to whether in the absence of an absorbance shift due a spin change the IANBD probe can reveal the binding of a substrate by fluorescence emission. Titrations with AA and PRP of IANBD-labeled wt and mutants show significant changes in the fluorescence emission of the probe. The fluorescence emission increased by 55-140% upon titration with AA and decreased by 21-38% (all values corrected for the background buffer) with PRP. Titrations with lauric acid and chlorzoxazone, two substrates known to behave like AA and PRP respectively, confirmed the same pattern in fluorescence changes. In all cases the dissociation constants (KD) were calculated and the results, spanning from the lM to the mM range, were found to be in good agreement with the literature. Control experiments carried out with with diclofenac and ibuprofen, known not to be ligands of the enzyme, and imidazole, known to be an inhibitor, gave a negligible variations of fluorescence in the same range of the control titrations with the buffer (<20%). E-cadherin plays a powerful tumor suppressor role. Germline Ecadherin mutations justify 30% of Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) and missense mutations are found in 30% of these families. We found possible to restore mutant E-cadherin associated to HDGC syndrome in vitro by using Chemical Chaperones (CCs). Our aim was to disclose the molecular mechanisms underlying the CCs effects in E-cadherin regulation. Using cells stably expressing WT E-cadherin or different HDGC-associated missense mutations, we show that upon DMSO treatment, not only mutant E-cadherin is restored and stabilized at the plasma membrane (PM), but also Arf6 and PIPKIc expressions are altered, both crucial components of E-cadherin trafficking machinery. We show that modulation of Arf6 expression partially mimics the effect of CCs, suggesting that the cellular effects observed upon CCs treatment are dependent of Arf6. Further, we show that E-cadherin expression recovery is specifically linked to Arf6 inhibition and not reliant on dynamin-dependent endocytosis blockage. Finally, we demonstrated that, as DMSO, several others CCs are able to modulate the trafficking machinery through an ARF6 dependent mechanism. Interestingly, the more effective compounds in E-cadherin recovery to PM are those that simultaneously inhibit Arf6 and stimulate PIPKIy expression and binding to E-cadherin. Here, we present the first evidence of a direct influence of CCs in the cellular trafficking machinery and we show that this effect is of crucial importance in the context of juxtamembrane E-cadherin missense mutations associated to HDGC. We propose that this influence should be taken into account when exploring the therapeutic potential of these type of chemicals in genetic diseases associated to protein-misfolding.",

Tozzi 1 1 Unita' di Biochimica, Biologia, Universita' degli Studi di Pisa, Pisa, Italy, 2 Unita' di Biochimica, Scienze del Farmaco, Universita' degli Studi di Sassari, Sassari, Italy cN-II has been the subject of intensive investigation over the last decades, as its mRNA levels seem to be a prognostic factor in adult AML and fluctuations of enzyme activity are associated with severe pathological conditions. CN-II is a 6-hydroxypurinespecific nucleotidase, most active with (d)IMP; besides, it is able to catalyze the phosphotransfer from a purine nucleoside donor to inosine/guanosine. Therefore, it is likely to play an important role in the regulation of purine nucleotide pools within the cell. Moreover it might be involved in prodrug metabolism. CN-II, which is a homotetramer, is allosterically regulated by several effectors in a complex manner: it has been proposed that the effectors induce a change in the subunit oligomerization of the protein. Recently, Wallde\u00b4n et al. described the crystal structure of a truncated form of human cN-II: the homotetrameric structure results from interaction through interface B of two identical dimers arisen from interaction of two identical subunits through interface A. Recently, investigating the chromatographic behaviour and the activity profile both of the recombinant wild-type cN-II and of point mutants designed in order to interfere with cN-II oligomerization, we, for the first time, showed that the dimer is the smallest active aggregation state and that the tetramer is the major quaternary structure of cN-II, irrespectively of the presence of effectors. These data were confirmed by lightscattering experiments. Here, we describe a very useful, fast and cheap method we set up, which, combining discontinuos native gradient gel electrophoresis, western blotting and detection of 5'nucleotidase activity, let us to correlate enzyme activity with protein aggregation extent, definitively solving the controversial point about the relationship between cN-II oligomerization state and presence of effectors.",

            "text": "In insect, trehalose is the main blood sugar and is present in high concentration in the hemolymph of larvae, pupae and adults. It is the main reserve sugar in the hemolymph of flying insects and is also indispensable for thermotolerance in the larvae. Trehalose may serve as an agent for protecting proteins and cellular membranes from a variety of environmental stress conditions, including dessication, dehydration, heat, freezing and oxidation. In order to utilize blood trehalose, insect tissues possess an enzyme, a,a-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28), that catalyses 1 mol of trehalose into 2 mol of glucose. In insects trehalase is a very important enzyme for survival. The exposure of C. riparius larvae to subletal concentrations of some insecticides has effects on the catabolism of trehalose. Trehalase can be considered as a target for the identifi-cation of newer and more specific insecticides. The cDNA, synthesized through reverse transcriptase by C. riparius larvae mRNA, was used as template for PCR. As trehalase are generally highly conserved proteins, we designed specific oligonucleotides starting from D. melanogaster trehalase encoding cDNA, matching homology sequences in Diptera: a fragment of 1500 bp was obtained by PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high similarity to insect trehalase sequences. We then performed 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using specific primers based on the sequence of the fragment and universal primers. We used the sequence information obtained from 5' and 3' RACE to design primers for end-to-end amplification of full-length sequence encoding C. riparius soluble trehalase. The full-length cDNA was subcloned in pCR-BLUNT plasmid for sequencing and then inserted into the BamHI and SmaI sites of the pQE30 expression vector to allow the expression of His-tagged protein in E. coli SG13009 strain. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone involved in fundamental physiological processes in higher plants, such as response to abiotic stress. Recently, ABA was shown to be produced and released by human granulocytes, by insulin-producing insulinoma cells and by pancreatic b cells. ABA autocrinally stimulates cellspecific functional activities through a receptor-mediated pathway, that sequentially involves a G protein/receptor complex, increase in cAMP, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) generation, leading to an increase of the [Ca2+]i. Many ABA-binding proteins have been identified in plants: one of the proposed ABA-receptors, GCR2, shares a high homology with the mammalian lanthionine synthetase C-like protein (LANCL) family. Based on i) the sequence homology between the ABA-receptor protein GCR2 and the human LANCL protein family, and ii) the reported association of LANCL2 with the plasmamembrane, we investigated whether LANCL might be the human ABA receptor. Results: LANCL2 is required for ABA binding and signaling in mammalian cells. LANCL2 silencing abrogates the ABA-induced increase of the [Ca 2+ ]i and of the [cAMP]i in human granulocytes and in two rat insulinoma cell lines, as well as it prevents specific cell-type activation. LANCL2 overexpression conversely potentiates the ABA-induced [Ca 2+ ]i increase and confers ABA responsiveness to CD38+ HeLa cells. Studies of ABA binding to cells and to the recombinant protein showed saturable and specific 3H-ABA binding, qualitatively confirmed by dot blot experiments performed with biotinylated-ABA. Results obtained with granulocytes and HeLa transfected with a chimeric G protein (Gaq/i) suggest that the PTX-sensitive G protein coupled to LANCL2 is a Gi. Identification of the mammalian ABA receptor with LANCL2 will enable the screening of ABA antagonists as prospective new anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic agents.",

            "text": "Haemophilus influenzae has an absolute requirement of NAD to grow as it lacks many of the biosynthetic enzymes for de novo synthesis of the cofactor. Therefore, growth in vitro requires the presence of NAD itself, Nicotinamide Mono Nucleotide (NMN) or Nicotinamide Riboside (NR). By relying on extracellular NAD, H. influenzae shows a unique strategy to provide NAD(P) for cell viability. Indeed, the bacterium carries out a periplasmic degradation of NAD to adenosine and NR, which then diffuse across the cell membrane and are transformed back to NAD in the cytoplasm. The nucleotidase responsible for periplasmic NAD degradation is a zinc dependent enzyme termed NAD 5'nucleotidase (HiNadN) . In this work we present a biochemical investigation and the crystal structure determination at 1.3\u00c5 resolution of HiNadN. The structure reveals a monomer consisting of two domains connected by a flexible a-helix. In an open conformation structure, one molecule of adenosine is tightly bound in a small pocket located in the C-terminal domain, about 21 \u00c5 away from the bimetal zinc center, where catalysis takes place. Otherwise, in a closed conformation structure of enzyme, the ligand a/b-methyl-ATP is directly coordinated to the zinc ions. The structural superimposition analysis reveals a striking conformational change, quantifiable like 87\u00b0domain rotation, that cause a closure of 64% of C-terminal domain with respect to each other, that is likely to accompany hydrolysis of NAD. By an HPLC-MS coupled enzymatic assay, we confirm that the enzyme process NAD by first producing AMP and NMN, followed by AMP hydrolysis to Adenosine and finally NMN transformation to NR. A BLAST search highlighted human CD73, an ecto-enzyme endowed with 5'-AMP nucleotidase activity, as a potential HiNadN human ortholog. Our structural data revealed that all residues involved in ligand binding in HiNadN are strictly conserved in human CD73. By in vitro biochemical assay we confirmed that human enzyme is actually endowed with NAD pyrophosphatase and NMN 5'-nucleotidase activities. Current knowledge on the protein folding reaction has been achieved by extensively characterizing the mechanisms of simple protein systems (1) . However, given the diversity of protein structures and aminoacidic compositions, it is extremely difficult to draw general rules by comparing folding pathways of different proteins. In fact, when considering the folding of different proteins at least three key variables may jeopardize a comparison: (1) sequence composition, (2) native and (3) denatured states structure variability. Thanks to the development of protein engineering, we can now address very complex questions, such as the relationship between sequence information and the three-dimen-sional structure of a protein, using relatively simple systems. By keeping the same 3D structure, but introducing topological mutations (such as circular permutation), we can potentially infer the role of topology in dictating folding pathways in a direct manner. Furthermore, the design of proteins with different topologies but nearly identical sequences allows investigating the importance of amino acids in specifying the final structure (2) . I will discuss new insights on protein folding mechanisms in the context of folding experiments on the PDZ domain family (3) (4) (5) , and their circularly permuted variants, and the GA88/GB88 proteins (6) , two proteins displaying very high sequence identities but different structure and function. It is well known that the native structure of proteins is encoded by their amino acid sequence. To understand the role of these critical amino acids in the folding process we are working on a heteromorphic pair of proteins (called Ga and Gb) having 56 amino acids each and characterized by different folds and different functions, i.e. the specific binding of Albumin for Ga and of IgG for Gb respectively. After extensive mutagenesis and purification of several variants of these proteins having sequence identities of 30, 77 and 88%, we carried out circular dichroism and stopped flow kinetic experiments using urea and GdnCl. Quantitative analysis of the kinetics allowed us to track the role of several amino acids in the folding mechanism. Data obtained for Gb1 and its variants have a shape demanding the presence of an intermediate state in the folding pathway. Analysis will address the importance of the folding nucleus as well as the critical amino acids involved in dictating the structure leading to differential functions. Our observations suggest that Ga follows a two state folding mechanism while Gb behaves as a three state folder with an intermediate state that was unexpected. Given that these proteins have been a paradigm for folding studies and had attracted a lot of attention, our finding will demand a revision of previous conclusions. Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) stands for the major virulence factor of the anthrax disease [1] as well as an under investigation potential engineered agent against nascent tumours [2] . It comprises a 90 kDa highly specific metalloprotease, the anthrax lethal factor (LF) of the gluzincins family. LF possesses a catalytic Zn2 + binding site and is highly specific against MAPK kinases, thus representing the most potent native biomolecule to alter and inactivate MKK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinases] signalling pathways. Given the importance of the interaction between LF and substrate, it could be said that shedding light into the interaction in solution in atomic level is of high interest. Therefore, an experimental platform, to monitor the properties, dynamics and interactions in solution of the catalytic domain of LF in vitro is necessary. Here, we report the development of a recombinant polypeptide, consisting of the 105 C-terminus residues (LF672-776) that harbours the enzyme's core protease domain [3] [4] . The biophysical, biochemical and conformational studies of the 12 kDa polypeptide resulted to the solution NMR structure of its apo form [5] , as well as the characterization of its metal binding properties, and dynamical properties in solution. The polypeptide adopts a compact structure even in the absence of the Zn2 + cofactor, while it exhibits remarkable reversibility upon denaturation. Over and above, a series of single amino acid mutants of the WT LF catalytic core was further characterized to gain additional insights of the conformational and catalytic properties of LF's catalytic core through solution NMR spectroscopy. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a key role in biological processes occurring within the living cell. However detailed mechanism of their functioning has not been completely understood yet. We chose a set of RTKs from three families: epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1-ErbB4), Eph receptors (EphA1, EphA2) and fibroblast growth factor receptor in norma (FGFR3) and pathology (with G380R and A391E point mutations). Malfunctions of these proteins, including transmembrane (TM) region, lead to a wide variety of severe human diseases (oncogenesis, hypertension, diabetes and other). Relatively small size of complexes of transmembrane peptides of selected RTKs (TMPs) with detergents or lipids allows one to study their detailed spatial structure using three-dimensional heteronuclear high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. An effective expression system and purification procedure for preparative-scale production of TMPs (including 15N-and 15N-/13C-labeled) for structural and functional studies were developed. The recombinant TMPs were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS as C-terminal extensions of thioredoxin A. Several milligrams of purified isotope-labeled TMPs were isolated with the use of a simple and convenient procedure, which consists of consecutive steps of immobilized metal affinity chromatography and cation-exchange chromatography. The fusion protein cleavage was accomplished with the light subunit of human enterokinase. The purified peptides were reconstituted in lipid/detergent environment (micelles or bicelles) and characterized using dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR spectroscopy. Bovine seminal RNase (BS RNase) is the only naturally dimeric member of the pancreatic-type RNase superfamily. The enzyme is a mixture of two isoforms: (1) M = M, dimeric through two antiparallel disulfides occurring between the two subunits; (2) M \u00b7 M (70% of the total), characterized by the swapping of the N-termini besides the mentioned disulfides (1) . When dissolved in 40% acetic acid and subjected to lyophilisation, BS RNase forms a mixture of oligomeric aggregates (2), as does RNase A (3), the proto-type of the super-family. However, while the oligomers of the pancreatic variant have been extensively characterized (3) (4) (5) , the multimers of BS RNase (6) are presently less known. To deepen their characterization we induced BS RNase self-association by using the same conditions used with RNase A, i.e. lyophilisation of enzyme solutions at low pH, or thermally-induced aggregation of concentrated protein solutions in various media. The multimers obtained were analyzed by SEC, cation-exchange chromatography, cross-linking, electrophoresis, proteolysis, and enzymatic assays. The main results obtained are: (1) BS-RNase forms several 3D domain-swapped conformers, in particular at least two tetramers; one is probably a totally Nterminal-swapped isoform (4), while the other contains a Cterminal swapping. (2) The C-swapped tetramer is less stable than the N-swapped one. (3) BS RNase multimers larger than tetramers appear to be a mixture of various isoforms, similarly to what occurs with RNase A (3). These multimers seem to contain, again, a Cterminus swapping. (4) The validity of the results reported have been strengthened by the studies performed with a K113N-BS RNase mutant.",

            "text": "The deposition of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) amyloid is commonly associated with atherosclerosis, where amyloid derived from wild-type apoA-I is deposited in the arterial intima. In addition, rare hereditary apoA-I amyloidoses are caused by mutations in the protein. Pathological apoA-I amyloid fibrils are generally composed of the N-terminal portion of the protein; however, very little is known about the mechanism of apoA-I amyloid formation in disease. Significant levels of methionine oxidised apoA-I (MetO-apoA-I) are present in normal human serum. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of methionine oxidation on fulllength, lipid-free apoA-I. Biophysical analysis showed that methionine oxidation caused partial unfolding of apoA-I, decreased its thermal stability, and reduced its capacity to form its native dimeric and tetrameric oligomers. Incubation of MetO-apoA-I resulted in aggregation of the protein into fibrillar structures that exhibited all the hallmarks of amyloid, including binding of the dyes thioflavin T and Congo Red, as well as cross-b amyloid structure. Mature MetO-apoA-I fibrils exhibited a proteolysisresistant core that corresponds closely to the N-terminal apoA-I fragments identified in disease associated apoA-I amyloid deposits. Further analysis identified the sequence driving aggregation within the N-terminal region (46-59), and synthesised peptides from this sequence retained the ability to form fibrils. This study demonstrates that methionine oxidation can induce amyloid fibril formation by apoA-I and suggests a possible pathway for formation of pathological apoA-I amyloid from wild-type protein: Fibril formation from full length apoA-I, followed by partial proteolysis of the constituent protein, may account for the N-terminal fragments identified in pathological apoA-I amyloid deposits. Thus, methionine oxidation may play a crucial role in deposition of apoA-I amyloid in both atherosclerosis and inherited apoA-I amyloidoses.",

            "text": "The structure of extracellular matrices influences proplatelet formation by human megakaryocytes (1) . The role of VDAC as a gate between mitochondria and the rest of cell suggests its primary involvement in the mitochondrial energetic metabolism. In mammalian organisms three VDAC genes encoding isoforms have been iden-tified, but no specific biological role has been assigned to each isoform (2) . We quantified expression level of human VDAC isoforms in HeLa cells. VDAC1 mRNA is the most abundantly expressed compared to VDAC2 and VDAC3 transcripts. Interestingly over-expression of each VDAC isoforms affected the expression of the other two genes. In particular VDAC2 and VDAC3 mRNA levels raised, while VDAC1 mRNA showed a steady level of expression. To clarify the biological role of the three VDACs, we have also characterized the tissue distribution of VDAC isoforms in rat. From a preliminary analysis we found that all three isoforms are differentially distributed in various tissues. In particular they are prevalently expressed in brain, spleen, muscle, lung, while scarcely represented in heart, liver, pancreas. However expression pattern of the three isoforms clearly indicated a predominant expression of VDAC1 over the other two isoforms in all tissues tested. The profile emerging from our studies suggest that all VDAC isoforms are expressed in mammalian cells and tissues but with different extent. VDAC1 is the most abundant among them suggesting a pivotal role in mitochondrial function, while VDAC2 and VDAC3 expression may be controlled in order to guarantee a correct balance of isoforms inside the cells or may bear an alternative function to VDAC1 still unknown. In some archaea, glucose degradation proceeds through a modified version of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway where glucose and fructose-6-P phosphorylation is carried out by kinases that use ADP as the phosphoryl donor. Unlike their ATP-dependent counterparts these enzymes have been reported as non-regulated with simple hyperbolic kinetics for both of their substrates. Based on the three-dimensional structure determination of several ADP-dependent kinases they can be classified as members of the ribokinase superfamily. In this work we studied the role of divalent metal cations on the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes by means of initial velocity assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that a divalent cation is strictly necessary for the activity of these kinases. In terms of catalysis the three enzymes are quite promiscuous regarding the chemical nature of the cation employed, however not all of them have equivalent effects on the regulation of the enzyme activity. Although free ADP cannot act as a phosphoryl donor it still can bind to these enzymes with a reduced affinity, stressing the importance of the metal in the proper binding of the nucleotide to the active site. Also, the binding of a second metal to these enzymes produces a complex with a reduced catalytic constant. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the catalytic metal is bound to the highly conserved NXXE motif. Considering the evolutionary information for the ribokinase superfamily, we propose that the regulatory metal acts by directly modulating the energy difference between the protein-substrates complex and the reaction transition state, which could constitute a general mechanism of metal regulation in enzymes of this superfamily.

We have previously shown that cardiac translocation of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase to the mitochondria may constitute a final end-effector of IPC. In this study we suggest that cellular hexokinase trafficking in diabetic heart in response to IR and IPC is dysfunctional as compared to control hearts. Isolated control and diabetic rat hearts (65 mg/kg streptozotocin) were perfused in Langendorff-mode and subjected to 30 minutes ischemia and 30 minutes reperfusion plus or minus IPC (3 times 5 minutes I). Left ventricular pressure and coroner perfusion pressure were determined. Hearts were homogenised, cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction obtained. HK activity was determined by spectrophotometric techniques, and apoptosis by TUNEL method. IPC increased recovery of rate-pressure-product (RPP; 38.6 \u00b1 10.9 (IPC) versus 8.7 \u00b1 0.9 (non-IPC) and decreased contracture [end-diastolic pressure: 52.4 \u00b1 11.9 (IPC) versus 77.3 \u00b1 3.9 (non-IPC)] at 30 minutes reperfusion for control hearts. IPC was without effect on RPP and EDP in diabetic hearts [EDP: 11.8 \u00b1 5.3 (IPC) versus 23.6 \u00b1 8.1 (non-IPC); RPP: 69.3 \u00b1 16.6 (IPC) versus 71.3 \u00b1 9.6 (non-IPC)]. IPC reduced cytosolic HK activity at the end of ischemia and at 5 minutes and 30 minutes reperfusion, and increased mitochondrial HK activity at start ischemia and at 5 minutes reperfusion in control heart. In contrast, IPC increased cytosolic HK activity at end ischemia and at 5 minutes and 30 minutes reperfusion, without increasing mitochondrial HK activity at start ischemia and actually decreasing mitochondrial HK activity at 5 minutes reperfusion in diabetic hearts. The lost of IPC protective effects in diabetic hearts was associated with altered HK cellular redistribution, suggesting that the altered IPC response in the diabetic heart may be associated with changes in cellular HK trafficking. Nowadays increasing of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) strength could overbalance the adaptation potential of biologic systems. Increasing of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the influence of EMF have been reported and opens new questions about further fate of these highly reactive agents. Damage of high-molecular compounds by ROS undoubtedly should be considered. And as a consequence the role of ROS now is included in pathogene-sis of many diseases. Today ROS effect on proteins oxidative modification is broadly investigated. Carbonilation of proline, arginine, lysine, and threonine is one of the hallmarks of protein oxidation. ROS generation phenomenon does not exclude the possibility of EMF direct action on macromolecules structure. Blood as the tissue circulating throughout the body is suitable subject for investigation of metabolic and pathologic processes. Hence, it is supposed that the effect of EMF would be manifested on blood plasma proteins. Above it oxidative consequences of EMF depend on protein structure, that is surface area, and amino acids contend. Our interests are focused on the carbonylation of plasma proteins under the influence of Static Electric Field (SEF). Because of unique linear conformation and arginine rich E domain, it was presumed that fibrinogen should be the main target of SEF action. Our experiments gave evidence concerning high oxidative potential of fibrinogen realized by SEF. Accelerated recalcification time along with increased carbonylation of fibrinogen after SEF exposure was demonstrated. Data presented in literature speaks in favor of fibrin clotting retardation by oxidized fibrinogen. Hence, oxidative modification of fibrinogen may have serious and probably undesirable consequences on blood coagulation system and investigations of EMF action on the blood coagulation system would be applicable in the modern world full of electric devices. Stabilization of enzymes against extreme conditions etc. high temperature is one of the most complicated challenges in protein science. Amino acids substitution, chemical modification and protein immobilization on various support materials are the main classical strategies for enzyme stabilization. Carbon nanotube (CNT) as a nano-scale material with dedicated attributes, like enormous rigidity, stability and resistance to bio-and chemical degradation, could be used as a good candidate for enzyme immobilization. In the current study, catalase and proteinase K were covalently immobilized onto single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). Enzyme functionalization of carboxylated SWCNTs was performed using carbodiimide chemistry according to Jiang method. Briefly, N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) was used for coupling of N-hydroxysuccinamide (NHS) to the carboxylic groups on the oxidized nanotubes. The resulting stable active esters on CNTs were reacted with the amine groups on the catalase and proteinase K. Secondary structures of CNT-conjugated forms of enzymes were assessed by CD spectrophotometry. Catalase activity was measured using H2O2 as substrate and proteinase K activity was determined via the hydrolysis of casein. Thermal stabilization was followed by fluorescence spectrophotometry at different temperatures. Catalase and proteinase K in conjugation with SWCNT remain kinetically active. Conjugation to SWCNTs could induce extensive changes in the secondary structure of catalase. In contrast, the secondary structure of proteinase k in the conjugated form remains unchanged in comparison to unconjugated form. Immobilization of proteinase K on SWCNTs could stable its structure against high temperature but conjugation of catalase to SWCNTs had no obvious effect on its thermostability. It seems that immobilization of proteins on CNTs to obtain thermostable biocatalysts could not be used as a general route for any enzyme.",

Parvulins are also involved in protein folding disorders such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases in human. The overall fold of CsPin comprises a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet and four a-helices typically for other PPIases from various organisms [3] . Detailed analysis of high-resolution structure of Pin protein from archaea C. symbiosum in comparison to other PPIases shows that catalytic center is of bigger volume (with R~8.4 \u00c5 in comparison to the range of 4.5 .. 5.8 \u00c5 , which was observed for other parvulins, which 3D structures were determined so far) [3] . Additionally the analysis of relaxation data shows that residues responsible for Ser/Thr/AA-Pro biding substrate demonstrate strong molecular dynamic in micro-millisecond timescale [3] . Model proline-containing peptides were examined to study the binding and enzymatic specificity of the CsPin. The presented data provides new ideas about understanding the adaptation of cis/trans isomerisation at lower temperatures. Ubiquitin is well studied protein by different techniques [1, 2] . Ub exhibits many different biological activities e. g. protein degrada-tion, modulation of immune system [3] . Activator proteins (E1s) of Ub and the ubiquitin-like modifiers are similar overall, but their First Catalytic Cysteine Half-domains are different. We report a 3D NMR structure of FCCH [4] of Ub-E1 together with the 15N relaxation studies. The model-free analysis reveals the FCCH backbone complex dynamics, indicating residues experiencing chemical exchange. The corresponding FCCH residues in the co-crystal structure of Uba1 and Ub make some contacts with the polar face of Ub [5] . Mouse Ub-E1 with a deletion of the FCCH (Ub-E1DFCCH) can be expressed in Escherichia coli. In vitro, the purified protein takes part in Ub activation, conjugation and transfer to the model substrate luciferase. The Ub-E1DFCCH in contrast to full length Ub-E1 appears to be prone to overubiquitination. ",

Conformational changes of Pd molecule induced both by the phosphorylation itself and by the 14-3-3 protein binding were studied using the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Acriflavine is an antiseptic agent causing both apoptosis and necrosis in yeast cells. Incubation of horseradish peroxidase C (HRPC) with various acriflavine concentrations resulted in changes in the enzyme absorption spectrum, including decreases in the intensities of the Soret (403 nm), b (500 nm) and charge transfer (CT1) (642 nm) bands absorption, blue shift (up to 6 nm) in Soret band maximum, and red shift (up to 3 nm) in CT1 band maximum. Two values for the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) were found, depending on acriflavine concentration range. Enzymatic activity alterations by acriflavine were studied by following the H2O2-mediated oxidation of o-dianisidine by HRPC. While incubation of 45 nM enzyme with up to 0.6 mM acriflavine slightly enhanced the enzymatic activity, incubation with 0.6 -6 mM acriflavine inhibited it. With o-dianisidine as the varied substrate, acriflavine was either a noncompetitive or a mixed inhibitor of HRPC depending both on the duration of preincubation with the enzyme and on acriflavine concentration; in addition, for the same inhibition type, Ki values dropped as incubation time increased. With H2O2 as the varied enzyme, acriflavine was a noncompetitive inhibitor of HRPC regardless of the duration of preincubation with the enzyme and acriflavine concentration; Ki values dropped as incubation time increased. Enzymatic activity was restored to variable extends upon dialysis, reaching up to 92% recovery depending on duration of dialysis, length of preincubation of HRPC with acriflavine and concentration of the latter. Results suggested that acriflavine would, to a large extend reversibly, bind to HRPC, inducing conformational changes and, as a consequence, altering the enzymatic activity; they also revealed the presence of binding sites with relatively higher and lower affinity for acriflavine. Kinetics results indicated that acriflavine differentially altered the reducing substrate and the peroxide binding sites.",

Several activating enzymes for pro-MMP-2 have been proposed, including metalloproteases and serine proteases. The mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation by thrombin is well established, and the activation mechanism involves specific cleavages of the propeptide. Moreover, it has been shown that thrombin also degrades MMP-2, but this degradation is reduced greatly under cell-associated conditions with a concomitant increase in activation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that heparan sulfate is essential for thrombin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2. Binding of heparan sulfate to thrombin is primarily responsible for this activation process presumably through the conformational changes at the active site. Furthermore, interaction of MMP-2 with exosite 1 and 2 of thrombin is crucial for thrombin-mediated MMP-2 degradation. Thus, inhibition of their interaction by heparan sulfate or hirudin fragment results in a decrease in MMP-2 degradation. Finally, we showed the interaction between exosite 1 and hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2, suggesting the regulatory role of hemopexin-like domain in MMP-2 degradation. Taken together, our experimental data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for thrombin-dependent MMP-2 enzymatic activity by heparan sulfate proteoglycans.",

Ethanol is used in food processing to regulate properties and stability of milk products but molecular origins of these processes are still poorly understood. In this study we provide structural data on model b-casein micelles in water-ethanol solutions by fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism. Our results revealed that effect of ethanol on beta-casein colloidal stability strictly depends on alcohol concentration and temperature, displaying non-monotonic behavior. A small addition of ethanol actually stabilizes b-casein micelles, while increasing ethanol concentration destabilizes them. It is shown that secondary structure of b-casein in alcohol-stabilized micelles possess large portion of b-sheet, reflecting formation of more compact and less solvent accessible core. In contrast, dissociating concentrations of ethanol induce increasing a-helical content implying that direct interaction between alcohol and protein chains takes place. The cardiovascular diseases and brain strokes in human concern with abnormal activation of blood coagulation system leading to thrombus formation in blood vessel. The ways of the struggle with thrombosis is inhibition of the different steps of the blood coagulation cascade. Fibrinogen is transformed by thrombin into fibrin desAA, which is able to polymerize spontaneously due to intermolecular binding of the complementary sites ''A'' and ''a'' giving rise to protofibrils, fibrils and finally three-dimensional fibrin network -the framework of thrombus. There are no medicinal preparations now which can prevent thrombus formation by the inhibition of the last step of the cascade -fibrin network formation. Calix [4] arene methylenebisphosphonic acid (C-192) and its octasodium salt (C-145) have been studied with regard to their inhibitory effects on fibrin polymerization, blood coagulation processes and influence on activity of factor Xa and thrombin and on platelets aggregation. The maximum rate of fibrin polymerization decreased by 50% at C-192 concentration of 0.5 lM (IC 50 ) at molar ratio to fibrin 1.7-1. IC 50 for C-145 is 2.5 lM. It was shown by an HPLC assay and confirmed by electron microscopy that C-192 blocks fibrin polymerization by complex formation with polymerization site ''A'', which initiates protofibril formation. We showed that C-192 and C-145 haven't influence on activity of factor Xa and thrombin and on platelets aggregation. C-192 also doubled both the prothrombin time and the activated partial thromboplastin time in normal human blood plasma at concentrations of 0.71 and 0.11 lM, respectively. These experiments demonstrate that calixarenes C-192 and C-145 are specific inhibitors of fibrin polymerization and blood plasma coagulation and haven't influence on activity of the different steps of the blood coagulation cascade.

To date there have been 20 chemokine receptors identified. There are still chemokines for which the functional receptors remain unknown. One of these chemokines is CCL18/PARC, which was discovered in 1997. It has been postulated to act both as a homeostatic and an inflammatory chemokine and is constitutively detected in human plasma at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. However increased levels of CCL18 have been demonstrated in several inflammatory diseases, where the recruitment of leukocytes is excessive. We have found that intact mature CCL18 is a chemotactic factor for T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and NK cells in vitro although the response is weak. Many chemokines can be enzymatically processed after their secretion, which can alter their function by converting them from low to high affinity ligands. The isolation of natural CCL18 from the conditioned medium of PBMC demonstrated that in addition to the full length CCL18 containing 69 residues, two NH2-terminal processed forms lacking two or three NH2-terminal residues were identified. However as the biological activity of these truncated forms was not determined, we constructed and characterized these truncated forms. Furthermore we have used SELDI technology to identify new truncated forms of CCL18 and to examine the relative amounts of the truncated forms in the synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients. The presence of CCL18-binding proteins in tick saliva indicates an important role for this chemokine during immune responses. Binding of CCL18 to Evasin-1 and Evasin-4 has been obtained using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method.

EF-Tu is a multifunctional GTPase that in the active GTP-bound form delivers aa-tRNA to ribosome. The effect of T and P on the archaeal elongation factor 1a from S. solfataricus (SsEF-1a), the functional analog of eubacterial EF-Tu, was investigated, either in terms of the effect produced by the antibiotics on the biochemical properties or by fluorescence spectroscopy. Concerning the effects on the functional properties of SsEF-1a, T and P inhibited the in vitro poly(U)-directed poly([3H]Phe) synthesis. In the partial reactions catalysed by SsEF-1a, P but not T was able to decrease the affinity of the elongation factor toward aa-tRNA only in the presence of GTP. Furthermore, T produced an increase of the GDP/GTP exchange rate and a slight inhibition of the intrinsic GTPase; vice versa in presence of P, the exchange rate was 1.5-fold faster for both GDP and GTP, and an increase of the intrinsic GTPase was observed. Moreover, while T exerted a destabilization toward thermal inactivation, P protected SsEF-1a toward chemical denaturation. Finally, both antibiotics induced a variation in fluorescence spectrum of the aromatic region of the protein. All these results will be discussed also for the effects produced on some engineered forms of SsEF-1a. The results, besides being useful for the assessment of potential side effects on the eukaryal functional analogues, could provide a basis for the development of new drugs whose mechanism of action is based on the interaction between specific amino acid residues of target proteins and these families of antibiotics.

Three transmembrane proteins, sharing homology with the large family of ADAM metalloproteases, have been recently identified as LGI1 interactors. In order to investigate the role of LGI1 in epilepsy, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the LGI1 protein and its interactors. We show how the two LGI1 domains cooperate to exert its function by building a 3D model. Furthermore, analysis of the model surface using different computational tools identifies a protein binding site in the leucine-rich repeat domain and a possible ADAM protein binding site in the b-propeller domain. Interestingly, mapping of disease-causing mutations on the LGI model shows that many of these co-localize at these functional regions. Using the crystal structure of ADAM22, we built the models of ADAM23 and ADAM11 and searched for conserved regions that could mediate interactions with LGI1. One of the detected binding sites is a structural motif known to mediate interactions among ADAMs and integrins. The structural superimposition of LGI1 model and integrin aVb3 reveals that the two proteins share a common b-propeller domain. The details of LGI1-ADAM interaction provide the basis for a novel functional model which describes the role of LGI1 as a signal modulator across the synaptic cleft. Further analysis of the LGI1 network relates it with ion channel proteins known to be involved in synaptic signal transmission. We found a possible mechanism of potassium channel modulation mediated by the interplay between LGI1 and ADAM22 proteins, which is in agreement with recent experimental evidence. N.meningitidis is an encapsulated gram-negative bacterium, and a major cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide.Although polysaccharide-protein conjugated vaccines are available for the prevention of diseases caused by strains with group A,C,W-135 or Y capsules, no broadly protective vaccine is available against groupB strains. Meningococcal fHbp is a promising vaccine candidate that elicits serum bactericidal antibodies in humans.This protein is a down-regulator of the complement cascade and binding of this molecule to the bacterial surface contributes to the ability of the organism to avoid complement-mediated killing. Based on sequence variability of the entire protein, fHbp has been divided into 3 variant groups or 2 sub-families and its architecture is modular,consisting of 5 variable segments,and amino acid residues in position between 100 and 255 have been identified as important targets of variant-specific bactericidal antibodies.A panel of anti-fHbp mAbs has been produced from mice immunized with the 3 variants of fHbp.The locations of residues involved in the epitopes recognized by all the mAbs,except those of JAR4 and JAR36,were previously mapped by using a combination of sequence alignments of the variants and site-directed mutagenesis experiments.The JAR4 epitope has been then mapped through phage displayed random peptide libraries screening and site-directed mutagenesis.We now report mapping of JAR36,an IgG2b anti-fHbp mAb isolated from a mouse immunized with fHbp v.3, which reacts with fHbp v.2 and 3 and elicits complement-mediated cooperative bactericidal activity with JAR13.We have screened phage displayed random peptide libraries,and lambda displayed fragment libraries of N.meningitidis fHbp gene,to identify amino acid residues composing the JAR36epitope,putative mapping hypotheses have been then validated by constructing recombinant fHbps single-point variants through site-specific mutagenesis,and analyzing their reactivity with the mAb.",

Su Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiayi University, 300 University Road, Chiayi, Taiwan Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) catalyzes the conversion of aldehydes to the corresponding acids by means of an NAD(P) +dependent virtually irreversible reaction. In current investigation, the biophysical properties of a recombinant Bacillus licheniformis ALDH (BlALDH) were characterized in detail by analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC) and various spectroscopic techniques. The oligomeric state of BlALDH in solution was determined to be tetrameric by AUC. Far-UV circular dichroism analysis revealed that the secondary structures of BlALDH did not altered in the presence of acetone and ethanol, whereas SDS had a detrimental effect on the folding of the enzyme. Thermal unfolding of this enzyme was found to be highly irreversible. The native enzyme started to unfold beyond 0.2 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and reached an unfoled intermediate, [GdnHCl] Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) is a known family of cytokine that regulates cell junction restructuring required for germ cell development and movement in the testis. Previous studies have shown that it is important to regulate the restructuring of the blood-testis barrier constituted by an array of tight and adherens junctions between adjacent sertoli cells. In this study, we extend our investigation to examine if TGF-b1 regulates the restructuring of cell junctions between sertoli and germ cells. Nectin-like molecule-2 (necl-2) is found in spermatogenic cells and is involved in Sertoli-germ cell interaction, we therefore examine if TGF-b1 exert its effect on Sertoli-germ cell junction restructuring by modulating the expression of necl-2 in spermatogenic cells. In this study, we have found that TGF-b1 (5 ng/ml) significantly downregulates both mRNA and protein levels of necl-2 in mouse germ cell cell line, GC-1 spg cells. The reduction of necl-2 mRNA mediated by TGF-b1 is at transcriptional level, but not post-transcriptional level. Luciferase reporter assays have confirmed that TGF-b1 downregulates necl-2 promoter activity and siRNA analyses have shown that knockdown of Smad3 and Smad4 abolish TGF-b1-mediated necl-2 gene repression. Electromobility shift assays have shown that TGF-b1 activates and promotes the binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to the cis-acting motifs including two CCAAT and MyoD motifs that lie within nt-159 and -1 of the promoter region. Apart from transcriptional regulation, TGF-b1 exerts its negative effect on necl-2 expression via post-translational regulation. Cycloheximide treatment coupled with immunoblotting has shown that TGF-b1 speed-ups the turnover of necl-2 protein. By inhibitor and shRNA approaches tar-geting clathrin, we have confirmed that TGF-b1 promotes necl-2 degradation by activating clathrin-dependent endocytosis. DNA damage constantly occurs in living cells as result of environmental factors and metabolic processes The predominant mechanism for repair of damaged DNA is base excision repair pathway. The key enzymes in BER are DNA glycosylases. Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase is one of the main DNA repair enzymes, it acts both as N-glycosylase and AP-lyase. To reveal the mechanism of damage recognizing and removal conformational transitions occurring both in an enzyme molecule and in sites of DNA interacting with it were studied. Using protein mutants that have amino acid substitutions in the enzyme active site can help to observe new stages in DNA binding and cleavage processes and also to ascertain a role of these amino acid residues in hOgg1 catalysis. In the present work the mutant form hOgg1 C253I is studied. The amino acid Cys253 participates in coordination 8-oxoguanine after its extrusion from DNA helix. The conformational dynamics of hOgg1 and its mutant was investigated by stopped-flow technique. Conformational transitions in the protein molecule were followed by changes in the fluorescence intensity of its Trp residues, as well as FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) method was applied using FRET labels in DNA substrates contained the damaged bases. Multiple transient changes in fluorescence intensities of enzymes and DNA substrates were observed. They indicate sequential conformational changes in both macromolecules (protein and DNA) during the catalytic cycle. The quantitative analysis of fluorescent data obtained in single-turnover conditions has shown that the rate of reaction catalyzed by C252I hOgg1 is decreased significantly in comparison with WT hOgg1.Kinetic analysis of FRET traces provides new insight into the mechanisms for DNA lesion recognition and conversion.

Despite its widespread use, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms surrounding its regulation. We unexpectedly identified acetylation of three lysine residues located on the first extracellular loop of CD133 by mass spectrometry analyses. We investigated the role of these acetylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, the loss of lysine acetylation resulted in the complete loss of CD133 from the cell-surface and an overall decrease in CD133 levels in the cell, whereas mimicking constitutive acetylation of CD133 resulted in increased cell-surface and overall CD133 levels compared to wild-type. We suggest that CD133 lysine acetylation is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins ATase1 and ATase2, as we demonstrate that CD133 can physically interact with both proteins by membrane yeast-two hybrid (MYTH) and loss of either ATase1 or ATase2 proteins results in the molecular destabilization of CD133. Our findings are parallel to the recent studies describing that the transient lysine acetylation of the b-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in the ER lumen regulates its stability. Taken together, this suggests that acetylation of lysines exposed to the ER lumen may be a form of regulation for many membrane proteins. Given that CD133 is a marker for cancer stem cells, targeting CD133 acetylation may be a viable means of treating cancer.",

            "text": "Chaperones suppress protein oligomer toxicity: Insight into the molecular mechanism of action Maintaining the homeostasis of the proteome is fundamental for cell life. Indeed, deficiencies in proteostasis lead to many diseases including a wide range of human pathologies, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, that are characterized by the aggregation of proteins in the form of amyloid fibrils. Increasing evidence indicates that the precursor aggregates forming before the fibrils are the pathogenic species in these protein deposition diseases. As a key mechanism of control and regulation of proteostasis, cells have evolved the molecular chaperone machinery. The effect of five human chaperones, namely aB-crystallin, Hsp70, clusterin, a2-macroglobulin and haptoglobin, was tested on the toxicity of amyloid-like oligomers formed by the N-terminal domain of HypF from E. coli (HypF-N). Measures of the cell viability showed all five chaperones are effective in suppressing protein oligomer toxicity. In this work the mechanism of such inhibition was investigated at a molecular level. ThT-binding of the HypF-N oligomers was not affected by chaperones, indicating that they do not dissolve the oligomers. In addition, the chaperones do not change the N-(1-pyrene)maleimide fluorescence spectra of the oligomers labelled with the dye, suggesting that they do not remodel the structure of the oligomers. Experiments carried out using intrinsic fluorescence, SDS-PAGE and immuno-dot blot show that the chaperones bind to the oligomers. Atomic force microscopy images obtained with aB-crystallin and a2-macroglobulin reveal that, following binding, the chaperones induce the clustering of the oligomers. These clusters are harmless because they cannot diffuse due to their large size and because their hydrophobic surface is buried. For these reasons, they are unable to interact with cell membranes, which are protected from damage. Overall, the data elucidate new mechanisms of action through which molecular chaperones maintain protein homeostasis. Lysozymes from family GH22 are involved in the digestion of bacteria in saprophagous insects. Digestive lysozymes have particular properties like an acidic pH optimum. In order to investigate the basis for this property, we have determined the crystallographic structures of digestive lysozymes 1 and 2 from housefly (MdL1 and MdL2; 2FBD and 3CB7, respectively) and compared them with the non-digestive lysozyme from hen egg white (HewL; 1HEW). Some particular characteristics were detected: Polar residues Ser106 and Thr107 are present in the active site of MdL1 and MdL2 replacing apolar residues Val and Ala found in HewL. Thr107 Oc forms a hydrogen bond with Glu32 carboxylic group (catalytic acid) in MdL1 and MdL2. Asn46 replaces an Asp near MdL1 and MdL2 active site preventing an electrostatic repulsion with Asp50 (catalytic nucleophile). Finally HewL surface is more positively charged than MdL1 and MdL2 surfaces. Additionally we have determined that pKas of the catalytic residues of a mutant MdL2, in which the exchanges Asn46Asp, Ser106Val and Thr107Ala were introduced by sitedirected mutagenesis, are similar to HewL, but they are higher than those for wild-type MdL2 and MdL1. In addition to that, the introduction via site-directed mutagenesis of six basic residues on MdL1 surface increased by 1 unit its pH optimum upon bacterial walls. Finally, removal of three negative residues from MdL1 surface through replacements Glu11Gln, Asp79Asn and Asp84Asn increased the affinity of this mutant for bacterial walls. Therefore, the acidic pH optimum of MdL2 and MdL1 is determined by a combination of the presence of Asn46, Ser106 and Thr107 near their catalytic residues, which produces a polar environment that favors the reduction of their pKas, and by a low concentration of positive charges on the MdL2 and MdL1 surfaces, which reduces substrate binding at high pH. This study was supported by Fapesp and CNPq. Factor VIII, an essential blood coagulation protein, is a key component of the blood coagulation system. Factor VIII is encoded by the FVIII gene. Defects in this gene results in hemophilia A, a well known recessive X-linked coagulation disorder. The aim of our work was to obtain cDNA of factor VIII without B domain. The expression of B-domain-deleted FVIII in mammalian cell cultures is higher than that of full-length FVIII molecules. The FVIII factor was made of synthetic oligonucleotides. We perfomed gene assembly from the long synthetic oligonucleotides (35-50 bp) that were ligated. PCR was used to amplify 4374 bp DNA fragment. After digestion the DNA fragment was inserted into pCG/dhfr eukaryotic expression vector. The pCG/dhfr plasmid contained CMV promoter, dhfr gene, MTX resistant variant, with promoter SV40 and the human FVIII factor without domain B sequence. The CHO cells were transfected by lipofec-tion method with PEI/DNA complexes. Positively transfected cells were selected in selective medium (without thymidine and hypoxanthine) using dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) selection system. The gene copy number in this cell line was increased by a stepwise increase in the methotrexate concentration. To determine whether FVIII was produced by the transfected cells, cell medium was collected and tested by Western blot using site-specific anti-Factor VIII monoclonal antibody. We obtained an expression of FVIII factor.",

            "text": "The cannabinoid receptors belong to the membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and are predominantly coupled via Gi/o proteins. The CB1 receptor subtype is known to play an essential role in analgesia, memory-impairment, spasmolysis and regulation of appetite. Selective agonists for CB2 receptors show antiinflammatory and analgesic properties in animal models [1] . Cannabinoid receptors are activated by three major groups of ligands, mammalian endocannabinoids, plant and synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. THC from the plant Cannabis sativa). Here we investigated the interactions between the cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB1/CB2) with a novel set of coumarin derivatives. Rational drug design for many GPCRs is complicated by the lack of receptor crystal structures. To aid interpretation of the experiments we have therefore constructed a model for the CB1 and CB2 receptors based on homology to bovine rhodopsin (pdb-code 1U19) and performed ligand binding simulations for a family of 39 coumarin derivatives applying an allatom docking protocol using Flexscreen [2] . We rationally designed, synthesized and tested a novel set of ligands to exploit a hydrophobic cavity in the vicinity of the docking pose of known ligands. All novel ligands showed improved, affinities with respect to their reference compounds, in good quantitative agreement between experiment and simulation, some of them reaching nanomolar affinities. Studying a series of site-specific mutations, we could computationally rationalize the receptor selectivity of specific compounds to either preferentially bind CB1 or CB2, respectively. Helical membrane proteins comprise the majority on the eukaryotic cell membrane. Their membrane domains consist of several hydrophobic a -helices, spanning the membrane and interacting with each other and thus forming the tertiary structure and fulfilling the function of the domain. That is why understanding principles, lying in the basis of helix-helix interactions in membrane proteins, is the key step towards the rational design of drugs targeting directly the membrane domain of a protein. In present work we made an attempt to find out which factors may affect the interaction of two TM a-helices in membrane-mimick-ing environment on the example of TM domain of ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase from the HER or ErbB family. First, the dimeric spatial structure of isolated TM segments of ErbB3 (residues 639-670) embedded in dodecylphosphocholine micelles was determined by means of solution NMR spectroscopy. It appeared to be a parallel symmetric dimer in left-handed orientation. The interaction between TM spans is accomplished via the non-standard heptad-repeat-like motif and is supported by apolar contacts of bulky sidechains and by stacking of aromatic rings together with p-cation interactions of Phe and Arg side chains. In addition NMR data has revealed the presence of dimer-monomer equilibrium. The dimer-monomer transition was analyzed quantitatively and the dependence of apparent dimer dissociation constant on the detergent concentration was build. The observation was made that the detergent behaves not as a solvent but as reactant. Such behavior may account for the problems occurring with refolding of multispan helical membrane proteins in detergents as well as for their misfolding and loss of activity. Adsorption of protein molecules on interfaces occurs in natural and man-made systems, and plays a central role in many events related to human health, to food science, and to environmental issues. Structural rearrangements upon contact with the sorbent phase may affect the protein's biological activities (allergenicity, bioavailability, ability to bind micro-and macromolecular ligands). The surface characteristics of the sorbent material play a key role in the form and extent of these rearrangements. Knowledge of these phenomena may allow to predict or modulate the protein functional behavior after adsorption. In this work structural and functional changes undergone by bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) -a relevant food allergen -upon adsorption on different materials and size hydrophobic surfaces (46 nm and 200 nm polystyrene nanoparticles or oil-in-water microemulsions) were evaluated by means of intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, binding of fluorescent probes, accessibility of cysteine thiols, and limited proteolysis followed by MALDI-TOF and LC-MS identification of released peptides. Changes in immunoreactivity were evaluated by competitive ELISA using epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The results indicate that BLG undergoes an extended stretch of the native structure after adsorption on hydrophobic surfaces, exposing regions buried from the aqueous media in the native structure. Hydrolysis of BLG stuck on different surfaces results into different peptide patterns, but for a single peptide -that may be a common region interacting with the sorbent phase. Immunoreactivity of BLG is markedly altered upon absorption. The amplitude of the observed differences is also depending on the nature of the sorbent material. All these results corroborate the central role of the nature and of the size of the sorbent material, as determinants of the type and extent of BLG structural rearrangements. The transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are membrane proteins conducting cations non selectively in general. The TRP super family contains more than 50 cation permeable channels from yeast to man (1) . The large super family can be divided into seven subfamilies based on their structural homology. All TRP ion channels share a common topology of six transmembrane helical regions where the two last helices and the intervening loop from four monomers form a pore for the cation permeation in the center of a tetrameric structure (2) . In this work we have focused on the TRPA1 subfamily, which differs from the other subfamilies by having a large number of ankyrin repeats in the N-terminal domain. TRPA1 is expressed in nociceptive neurons, and it has been suggested acts as a chemical nocisensor for the natural pungent products mustard oil, allicin, cinnamaldehyde and environmental irritants and noxious cold. The aim of this work is to clone and heterologously overexpress humanTRPA1 in the yeast Pichia pastoris using a similar procedure that has been successfully applied to aquaporins, another superfamily of integral membrane proteins, of plant and human origin (3, 4) . The full length human TRPA1 gene and two different truncated hTRPA1 constructs were amplified and cloned into a modified pPICZB-vector encoding a N-terminal deca-histidine tag and transformed into E.coli XL-1 Blue cells. After confirming the sequence, the constructs were transformed into the Pichia X-33 strain. The results of a zeocin selection for high-expression clones will be presented and discussed. The presence and the role of partially folded intermediates on the folding pathway of small single-domain proteins have been a matter of intense discussion over the past years. GB1, the small a/b IgG-binding domain of streptococcal protein G, has been employed as a model system in the protein folding field. Studies on the folding of GB1 have been carried out using a wide variety of experimental and theoretical approaches; most of them indicated that the protein folds following a simple two-state model.",

            "text": "We present a detailed reinvestigation of the folding pathway of GB1 by experiments and simulations showing the presence of an on-pathway intermediate. This conclusion is based on analysis of an extensive kinetic characterization of GB1 obtained by measuring its folding and unfolding rate constants at 25\u00b0C over a wide pH range (from 2.0 to 9.6) using guanidine as a denaturant agent. Interestingly, semi-logarithmic plots of the observed folding/unfolding rate constant of GB1, as a function of guanidine concentration (chevron plots) obtained at pH values higher than 6.0, do not conform to a linear behaviour which is generally expected for a two-state protein; on the contrary, a deviation from linearity of the unfolding arm is clearly detected ('roll over' effect). The detection of a roll-over effect only under some solvent conditions is consistent with the presence of an intermediate along the folding pathway, suggesting that GB1 does not follow a two state mechanism but it is a three-state folder. The deposition of protein aggregates in the form of amyloid in the extracellular space is the hallmark of a number of human diseases. The GAG heparan sulfate (HS) is an extracellular matrix component found to be universally associated with amyloid deposits, to promote amyloid fibril formation in a number of protein systems and to associate with early oligomeric protein assemblies. We previously showed that HS induces the rapid formation of ThT-binding and b-sheet containing oligomers of human muscle acylphosphatase (mAcP). The rapid formation of such species and the complexity of the reaction poses important limits for the study of protein aggregation in the presence of HS. We established a new strategy using a stopped-flow device coupled to optical absorption that enabled us to monitor rapid aggregation kinetics repeatedly and in a remarkably reproducible manner. Consequently, we could acquire reproducible time courses of HS-induced mAcP aggregation as a function of a number of parameters, such as mAcP concentration, HS concentration and amino acid substitutions. We first monitored the aggregation kinetics of wt mAcP at varying concentrations of mAcP or HS. Our results show that HS provides the nuclei of aggregation and is incorporated into and remains an integral part of oligomers that form in its presence. Next, we created 21 mAcP mutants that vary in their distribution of positive charges and monitored their aggregation kinetics at various HS concentrations. Our results indicate that HS-induced aggregation is primarily defined by positive residues in the flexible, unstructured regions of mAcP. For appropriate therapy of Alzheimer's disease which affects people all over the world regardless of nation and social status it is essential to determine the molecular basis of the pathogenesis. Amyloid b-peptide which forms amyloid plaques in brain during Alzheimer's disease is the product of sequential cleavage of a single-span membrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). More than half of mutations of APP found to be associated with familial forms of Alzheimer's disease are located in its transmembrane domain. The pathogenic mutations presumably affect structuraldynamic properties of the APP transmembrane domain, changing its conformational stability and/or lateral dimerization. In the present study the structure and dynamics of recombinant peptide, corresponding to APP fragment Gln686-Lys726 including the APP transmembrane domain with adjacent N-terminal juxtamembrane sequence, were determined in membrane-emulating milieu composed of detergent micelles using NMR spectroscopy methods. The structure obtained in DPC micelles consists of two a-helices: a short surface-associated juxtamembrane one (Lys687-Asp694) and a long transmembrane one (Gly70 0-Leu723); the helices are connected via a mobile loop region. A minor bending of the transmembrane a-helix takes place near tandem residues Gly708-Gly709. Cholesterol-binding hydrophobic cavity is apparently formed under the loop region where the juxtamembrane ahelix contacts with the membrane surface near N-terminus of the transmembrane a-helix. Protein conformational stability is governed by a plethora of chemical and physical parameters in vivo and in vitro. We are particularly interested in the interaction of proteins with material surfaces and use human insulin (HI) as a model protein. It is established that HI adsorbs preferentially on hydrophobic surfaces, which triggers conformational changes that lead to amyloid fiber formation on the material surface (Sluzky 1991 and 1992, Ballet et al., 2011 submitted). To get insight into early molecular events in the nucleation of HI aggregation on the material surface, we use Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) and hexadecan-thiol functionalized gold surfaces. Our data show that adsorption of HI on hydrophobic surfaces has two components: a reversible one, and an irreversible one which increases with increasing contact time between HI and the surface. Interestingly FITC-labelled HI, which does not aggregate upon contact with hydrophobic surfaces, lacks the irreversible adsorption component. We conclude that the irreversibly adsorbed part of HI is at the origin of the formation of HI amyloid fibers upon contact with hydrophobic surfaces. SPRi analysis allows thus to trace the build-up of irreversibly adsorbed protein on hydrophobic surfaces and to analyse early events in protein-material interactions that are premonitory to stability issues. These are particularly important in the development of protein-based drugs that are continuously in contact with composite material surfaces from their production throughout their medical administration. The main component of mammalian translation apparatus eEF1A is also involved in other cellular processes and interacts with a number of non-translational ligands including signaling proteins. eEF1A is considered to be a very important link connecting different cellular processes in cytoplasm. Two 97% homologous isoforms, eEF1A1 (A1) and eEF1A2 (A2), are found in higher vertebrates, their expression being tissue and development specific. Putative oncogenic properties of eEF1A2 were described, however, no mechanism for cancer-related discrimination of the two isoforms was proposed. We have compared the functional and structural properties of A1 and A2 using several biochemical and biophysical approaches. Testing the isoforms in translation and tRNA channeling has not revealed an obvious difference though A2 has higher affinity to GDP than GTP, to uncharged tRNA and is less active in translation system as compared with A1. As for non canonical functions, A2 was found to possess higher ability than A1 to interact with SH2 and SH3 domains of various signalling molecules. A striking difference is that eEF1A1 has considerable affinity to Ca2 + /calmodulin while no in vitro complex with Ca2 + /calmodulin was found for eEF1A2. The most important difference has been found for spatial structures of the isoforms using sedimentation analysis, multiple molecular dynamics simulation, differential scanning microcalorimetry, circular dihroizm and small angle Xray scattering. A1 has been shown to possess significantly more extended structure than A2. Besides, A1 showed about 10-fold higher hydrophobicity coefficient than A2. The difference in the molecule conformation and surface hydrophobicity could influence the ability of A2 to interact with certain signaling proteins that may be related to its oncogenesity upon appearance in the tissues where only A1 is expressed normally.",

Melino Department of Sciences and Chemical Technologies, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, 1 Department of Biology University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy RTN1-C is a neuronal protein localised in the ER membrane and, although, at the moment its mechanism is not completely understood, it seem to be involved in several important biological functions, such as membrane vesicle trafficking and apoptosis induction. A proposed topology model of this protein presents a horse-shoe-like topology with two transmembrane helices which are connected by a chain of residues, and the N-and C-terminal regions are supposed in the cytosolic side of ER [Fazi et al 2009]. Our previously studies showed that the C-terminal region is characterized by the presence of a H4 histone consensus sequence that make it able to interact with nucleic acids and HDAC/HAT enzymes both in vivo and in vitro. Here we have investigated on the presence of a natural metal binding site in the C-terminal region of the RTN1-C. The decapeptide corresponding to the last 10 amino acid of the C-terminal of RTN1-C protein was synthesized and its interaction with Ni2 + , Cu2 + , Zn2 + ions was probed by EPR, NMR, CD and UV spectroscopy. The characterisation of this metal binding site allows to hypothesize a func-tional role of metal ions in the protein-protein interaction of RTN1-C. An oligomerisation of the peptide was induced by Znbinding, suggesting the possibility that the Zinc ions can lead to an in vivo oligomerisation of RTN1-C in the ER. These data represent an important enhancement towards the structural and functional characterization of this neuronal membrane protein.",

To achieve a better understanding of membrane protein function, significant amounts of purified protein are required for functional and structural analyses. In the last 15 years, 80% of all recombinant proteins reported in the literature were produced in the bacterium, E. coli, or the yeast, Pichia pastoris. Developing effective strategies for producing recombinant eukaryotic membrane proteins in these organisms remains a particular challenge. Moreover, production is still the main bottleneck for functional and structural characterization of membrane proteins. Using a validated screening procedure together with accurate yield quantitation, we report production levels of each homologue and our results show that the protein production levels vary substantially, even between highly homologous aquaporins. We found that the nucleic acid sequence around the start codon plays an important role in overproduction, where using a eukaryote consensus sequence was beneficial. In addition, a major increase in production level could be obtained when codon optimization was performed. By mutational analysis we show that the yield of hAQP4 can be heavily improved by directing the protein folding pathway as well as stabilizing the aquaporin tetramer. Work on human aquaporin1 has resulted in a 'jackpot clone' giving exceptional yields of functional protein which could also be crystallized. Another target with high production, human aquaporin 10, has also successfully been produced in fermentor and subsequently been purified and characterized. Knowledge of production levels is important; to judge if a target has insufficient production and needs optimization or if further downstream characterization is possible. Taken together, high production levels must be achieved to overcome the first bottleneck for functional and structural characterization of membrane proteins.",

Despite the large number of 14-3-3 binding partners, only limited structural data on 14-3-3 protein complexes are available, thus hindering our mechanistic understanding of 14-3-3 protein function. In this work, we show that the 14-3-3 dimer binds the regulator of G protein signaling 3 (RGS3) in an as-yet-unrecognized manner that involves less-conserved regions outside the central channel. RGS proteins function as GTPase-activating proteins for the a-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. We present the low resolution solution structure of the 14-3-3:RGS3 complex using small angle X-ray scattering. This structure together with data obtained from hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics, timeresolved fluorescence and FRET measurements show that while the phosphorylated recognition motif at the N-terminal part of RGS3 binds within the ligand binding groove, the C-terminal RGS domain of RGS3 interacts with regions on the outer surface of the 14-3-3 dimer molecule including helices H6, H8 and H9. Suggested structure of the 14-3-3:RGS3 complex supports the hypothesis that 14-3-3 inhibits RGS3 function by blocking RGS3 interactions with G-alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins.",

It is found in most animals, plants and yeast. Three trehalase gene have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae so far: neutral trehalase 1 (NTH1), neutral trehalase 2 (NTH2) and acidic trehalase 1 (ATH1). NTH1 is responsible for trehalose degradation, which is accumulated after stress. The activity of the NTH1 enzyme was just recently found to be mediated by BMH1 and BMH2 binding in yeast. Yeast BMH1 and BMH2 proteins (yeast 14-3-3 isoforms) form a complex with neutral trehalase after its phosphorylation by PKA. Either one of the two 14-3-3 yeast isoforms are required for complete activation of neutral trehalase (NTH1). However details concerning the mechanism of BMH-dependent activation of NTH1 remain still unknown. We showed that PKA phosphorylates NTH1 in vitro on four Serine residues: 20, 21, 60 and 83. To find out which site or sites are essential for the BMH binding we produced NTH1 WT (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated), four NTH1 mutants containing single phosphorylation site, one double phosphorylated NTH1 mutant (at Ser20 and 21) and a mutant containing none of these studied phosphorylation sites as well. The interaction between BMH1 and BMH2 protein with enzyme NTH1 was monitored using native electrophoresis and sedimentation velocity measurements. The sedimentation equilibrium analysis was used to define the stoichiometry of NTH1/BMH complexes. Finally, we used enzyme kinetic measurements to monitor the BMH-dependent activation of NTH1. This study was supported by Grant P207/11/0455 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic and by Research Project AV0Z50110509 of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Aldose reductase is cytosolic enzyme which functions in polyol pathway. It converts glucose to sorbitol by means of NADPH. As a result of this, sorbitol acumulates in eyes and can not pass through membrane. This event causes oxidative stres and results in diabetis-dependent cataract formation. In current study, bovine lens aldose reductase was purified and the effect of glyceraldehyde concentration on bovine lens aldose reductase enzyme activity was examined, Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots were plotted. V max value for glyceraldehyde was calculated as 1.372 nmol/min/mg. In addition to this, K m value was gotten as 16.39 lM. Lentiviruses are host-specific viruses which cause slowly progressive diseases in their hosts; they constitute a genus of retroviridae family, which includes several viruses. All lentiviruses encode a gag gene that is processed by viral protease to generate different proteins; one of these is nucleocapsid protein (NC), the major structural protein of the ribonucleoprotein complex, bound to genomic RNA in mature virions. NC proteins of all lentiviruses and most retroviruses share a high percentage of basic residues and 1 or 2 zinc-binding CCHC motifs. Due to its essential role in virus life cycle, NC is viewed as an attractive target for development of antiretroviral drugs. HIV/ AIDS is the result of at least eleven cross-species transmission events of SIV from non-human African primates to humans; 3 trasmissions from chimpanzee subspecies gave rise to HIV-1 groups M,N,O and the other 8 trasmissions from sooty mangabeys to HIV-2 groups from A to H. All three HIV-1 groups and the HIV-2 groups A and B have established human to human-to-human transmission chains (1). Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 contain NC proteins, NCp7 and NCp8, respectively, 67% identical with two zinc fingers connected by a basic linker. Many genetic and structural studies have been carried out on NCp7 but not so many structural studies on NCp8. Recently the structure of HIV-2 NCp8 together with its RNA interaction have been published (2) . Here we present the structural characterization by CD and NMR spectroscopy of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the region 23-49 of the HIV-2 NCp8. Preliminarly, bioinformatic analyses have been performed on the whole Gag protein to select a sequence of NCp8 different from that already studied (type A, isolate Ghana-1). We have chosen a sequence, always belonging to the HIV-2 group A, which is the most different from the structural point of view.",

In aqueous solution the peptide adopts the significantly twisted b-hairpin conformation without pronounced amphipathicity. In order to assess a mechanism of membrane-mediated arenicin action, the spatial structure and backbone dynamics of the peptide in membrane-mimicking media and its pore-forming activity in planar lipid bilayers were studied. The spatial structure of asymmetric arenicin dimer stabilized by parallel association of N-terminal strands of two b-hairpins was determined using triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy in DPC micelles. Interaction of arenicin with micelles and its oligomerization significantly decrease the right-handed twist of the b-hairpin, increase its amphipathicity, and lead to stabilization of the peptide backbone in ps-ns timescale. Relaxation enhancement induced by water-soluble (Mn2 + ) and lipid-soluble (16-doxylstearate) paramagnetic probes points to the transmembrane arrangement of the dimer. Qualitative NMR and CD study of arenicin-2 in mixed DPC/DOPG bicelles, SDS micelles and lipid vesicles confirms that similar dimeric assembly of the peptide is retained in membrane-mimicking systems containing negatively charged lipids and detergents. Arenicin-induced conductance is also dependent on lipid composition of the membrane. The low-conductivity arenicin pores are detected in the phosphatidylethanolamine-containing lipid mixtures whereas the pores of high conductivity are observed in exclusively anionic lipid system. The obtained results agree with the model where antimicrobial activity of arenicins is mediated by formation of toroidal pores consisting of b-structural peptide dimers and lipid molecules. The measured conductivity levels are quantitatively consistent with mechanistically modeled toroidal pores assembled from two, three and four arenicin dimers.",

They show different structural complexity and a wide range of lethal potency and enzymatic activity, but share similar mechanism of action. Structurally, they can exist as monomeric PLA2 of 14 kDa or as multimeric complexes of homologous PLA2-like subunits. Snake toxins elevated neurotoxicity is the sum of two factors: their ability to hydrolyze phospholipids into lysophospholipids and fatty acids and the high specificity for the presynaptic membrane of the neuro-muscular junction. Direct consequences of these two properties are (1) the disruption of the presynaptic plasma membrane, (2) membrane permeabilization to calcium ions, (3) massive SV fusion with unbalanced SV retrieval, (4) neuro-muscular transmission blockade. Unexpectedly, no correlation has been found between neurotoxicity and phospholipase A2 activity. In fact, the most toxic SPANs show little enzymatic activity with respect to the less neurotoxic ones. Moreover, neurotoxicity increases with toxin's structural complexity and trimeric or hexameric neurotoxins show 10-fold lower LD50 values with respect to the monomeric ones. Up to date, no structural study has been presented on multimeric SPANs to shed light on the connection between structural complexity and neurotoxicity. By mean of x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering we investigated the structure of taipoxin, a trimeric neurotoxin phospholipase A2, and of its subunits. Here we present for the first time the structure of a trimeric PLA2 neurotoxin. Moreover, we also report the high-resolution structures of the two isoforms of one of its subunits (taipoxin beta), which entirely lost its neurotoxic properties but is endowed with elevated mitogenic potential. Noroviruses (NV) are the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks worldwide that can cause significant morbidity and mortality among children. No vaccine is known and effective treatments are not available, largely because studies on human norovirus suffer from the lack of a permissive cell-culture system. The virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the central enzyme required for replication, and a key target for development of antiviral agents. The 3D structures of RdRps of several Caliciviruses have been recently reported, allowing us to locate a protein site to be exploited for enzyme inhibition. We used an in silico docking procedure to identify small synthetic compounds predicted to bind with high affinity to the selected site. The best sorted candidates were then tested in enzymatic assays for inhibition of Murine (M) and Human (h) Norovirus RdRps. As a result of such combined approach we identified two effective compounds (EM01 and EM04) strongly inhibiting both MNV and hNV RdRp activity, with IC50 values in the nM range. While inhibitory effects of EM04 on the activities of various DNA/RNA polymerases from mammalian cells, bacteria and retrovirus were already known, to date EM01 is an unknown polymerase inhibitor. hNV RdRp inhibition by EM01 shows a mixed mechanism relative to both GTP and the nucleic acid substrates, implying that the inhibitor is able to bind to the free enzyme as well as to the enzyme-substrate complex. The crystal structures of MNV RdRp in the absence/presence of EM01, here reported, provide entirely new information for the development of novel anti-norovirus agents. Cell-based assays are ongoing in order to assess EM01 cell penetration parameters and its activity in the cellular environment.",

            "text": "Identification of a mechanism for enzymatic regulation in NarE NarE (Neisseria ADP-ribosylating enzyme), identified in the virulent strain MC58 of Nesseria meningitidis, belongs to the family of bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases [1] . These enzymes catalyze the transfer of the ADP-ribose unit from b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) to specific amino-acids (R, C, N, T, Q) with simultaneous release of nicotinamide (nam). In vitro assays showed that NarE is an arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase and also possesses NAD-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity. Recently we showed that NarE contains an iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) [2] in which a single iron atom is coordinated with two C (C67 and C128) and two H (H46 and H57) [3] . The presence of a structured cluster is important for transferase activity, which is lost when the cluster is destroyed, while the NADase activity is only slightly decreased. Here we reported that NarE ADP-ribosylates itself in vitro in a dose and concentration dependent manner. Incubation with NH2OH and NaOH hydrolyzed the link between ADP-ribose and NarE suggesting arginine the ADP-ribose acceptor. Four arginine residues (R7, R33, R97, R124) are present in NarE, we mutated each single R to K to identify the modified residue. The mutant R7K does not bind ADP-ribose suggesting that R7 is likely the target of auto-modification. The ADP-ribose unit carries two negative charges and alters considerably the chemical property of the R-residue, which is involved in the binding of NAD and the protein substrate. So the auto-modification influences the NarE enzymatic activities, the ADP-ribosylated NarE decreases transferase activity while NADase proportionally enhances. These data provided evidence that the auto-modification is an intramolecular mechanism adopted by NarE to regulate the priority between the two enzymatic activities. ApoA-I is associated to systemic amyloidoses when specific mutations occur in the 243-residue protein sequence. The extracellular fibrillar aggregates, localized in peripheral organs, are mainly constituted by N-terminal fragments of the protein. The fragment corresponding to region 1-93 is the main constituent of heart amyloid deposits. We produced a recombinant form of the fibrillogenic polypeptide, named ApoA-I, which generates typical amyloid aggregates similarly to its natural counterpart (1). We investigated the effects of a lipid environment on the conformational state and aggregation propensity of ApoA-I. Cholesterol, a natural ApoA-I ligand, was found to induce and stabilize the polypeptide a-helical state, inhibiting aggregation. Similar results were obtained with liposomes, positive, negative or zwitterionic (2) . Thus, an inverse correlation exists between a-helical content and aggregation rate of the polypeptide. Since the fibrillogenic polypeptide accumulates in the extracellular space, its interaction with target cells has to be taken into account. We found that ApoA-I recognizes specific binding sites on rat cardiomyoblasts cell membrane and is internalized mostly through chlatrin-coated vesicles and lipid rafts, while ApoA-I is internalized mostly through chlatrin-coated vesicles and macropinocytosis. Furthermore, unlike ApoA-I, the polypeptide is degraded by lysosomes and proteasome. On the contrary, fibrils of ApoA-I generated in vitro were found to be unable to enter the cells (3) . Thus, the intracellular degradation pathway is precluded to fibrillar aggregate, whereas the interaction of the polypeptide with target cells and its intracellular route may be relevant in the comprehension of the molecular bases of the pathology. The possible use of ribonucleases in the treatment of diseases, including cancer, has received a considerable interest in the last years. The necessary requirements that convert a ribonuclease into a cytotoxin for malignant tumour cells include binding to cell membrane, translocation into the cytosol and RNA degradation. Among the mammalian ribonucleases, only bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) fulfils all these requirements (1). We have designed a BS_RNase variant with an enforced cluster of positive charges at the N-termini surface to improve its cytotoxic potential according to literature data indicating that the protein approaches the membrane with a preferred orientation (2) . We found that the G38K-BS-RNase variant displays an increased citotoxicity for tumour cells and we hypothesized the higher cytotoxicity to be connected to its enhanced interaction with membranes. A detailed investigation of the membrane interaction mechanism of BS-RNase and G38K-BS-RNase, using a combination of biophysical techniques, including Surface Plasmon Resonance and Electron Spin Resonance, supports this idea, and indicates for both of them a common two-step mechanism, based on an initial binding to the bilayer surface followed by a shallow penetration in the lipid core. Protein binding, driven by electrostatic interactions, effectively perturbs lipid packing and dynamics. Our results, while ruling out the hypothesis that the protein crosses the membrane interior, support the hypothesis of a BS-RNase entry mediated by an endocytosis mechanism. Overall, these studies shed light on the mechanism of ribonuclease membrane binding and perturbation, and provide a rational basis to design proteins with higher antitumor potential. The major photosynthetic complexes (e.g. PSI, PSII, the cytochrome b6f complex) are located in the thylakoid membrane. Each of them consists of several subunits, which are encoded in either the chloroplast or in the nuclear genome. During formation of these functional complexes, numerous regulatory factors are required for the coordinated transport and assembly of the subunits. To date, four different pathways for the post-translational transport of nuclear-encoded thylakoid proteins have been described. They are called the cpTat, the cpSec, the cpSRP and the spontaneous integration pathway. The cpSRP pathway that specifically mediates the transport of members of the nuclearencoded LHCPs family requires the integral membrane protein Alb3 for insertion into the membrane. Several thylakoid membrane proteins (e.g. PSI-A, PSI-B, D1) are encoded by the chloroplast genome and are co-translationally inserted into the thylakoid membrane. However, it has been shown that Alb3 is at least partially associated with the cpSecY translocase, where it is possibly involved in the insertion/assembly of D1 protein. In this study, we analyzed the interplay between the cpSecY and the chloroplast encoded cytochrome b6 protein by isolation of RNC (ribosome nascent protein chain) complexes from chloroplasts and using crosslinking factors and antibodies together with mass spectroscopy (MS), SDS-PAGE and Western Blot analyses. From the whole pool of RNC using immunoprecipitation method and appropriate antibody we will isolate the RNC complex containing nascent cytochrome b6. Isolated complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blotting. Furthermore, cytochrome b6 or cpSecY protein found in stained band, was excised from a polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by MS. cpSecY were remarkably absent from the cross-linked complex contained cytochrome b6 suggesting that cpSecY is either not cross-link to other components and isn't involved in cytochrom b6 integration.",

            "text": "Non specific membrane interaction induces a b-rich structure in Septin 2, which may be related to amyloid formation Septins are members of a conserved group of GTP-binding and filament-forming proteins. They are involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as microtubule regulation, vesicle trafficking, the formation of scaffolding platforms and actin dynamics. Human Septin 2 (SEPT2) has an N-terminal polybasic region responsible for lipid binding, a GTPase domain, and a C-terminal domain. SEPT2 is essential for cytokinesis and it is found in many tissues, mainly in the brain. Together with SEPT1 and SEPT4, it is accumulated in deposits known as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, which is evidence that SEPT2 may be involved in this process. This study reports on biophysical properties of human SEPT2 using Circular Dichroism, Right-angle light scattering, extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, and PM-IRRAS. Our results show that SEPT2 forms homodimers in vitro and its thermal unfolding implies a conformational change involving an increase in b-sheet content. We have also observed the formation of aggregates under physiological conditions, which have the ability to bind an amyloid specific dye, Thioflavin-T. Interestingly, phospholipid interaction experiments have shown that SEPT2 has a stronger interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) than with phosphatidylinositol (DPPC). Results from in situ PM-IRRAS experiments indicated that the secondary structure of SEPT2 is preserved upon interacting with PtdIns(4,5)P2, but not when interacting with DPPC -which is not specific for SEPT2 -at the air/water interface. These results allow us to presume that SEPT2 may assemble into amyloid like fiber structures and that the non specific lipid interaction may be one of the driving forces for this process. Understanding the ability of SEPT2 to recognize PtdIns (4, 5) Serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are members of the Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which exhibit important physiological functions. 5-HT3 receptors structure investigation is necessary for better understanding of their role in different neurophysiological processes. The modifications of 5-HT3 receptors may lead to various pathologies (psychiatric disorders). Here we present models of 5-HT3 receptors constructed from a homology structure of nACh, and discuss the amino acid sequence responsible for their different activities. The molecular models of 5-HT3 receptors were created using MODELLER program. Some amino acid residues responsible for the different activities were investigated by the method of molecular dynamics. We used GROMACS software for characterization of amino acid substitutions occurring in 5-HT3 receptor molecule. Our models of 5-HT3 receptors have demonstrated that extracellular domains are rich of negative charge that may be responsible for cation migration into the cell. It was shown that the steric factor of THR289 hampers the cation transmission. The energy profile analysis has demonstrated the energy minimum presence in the region that is 2 nm apart from the mouth of the channel. Apparently, it is the region of negative-charged amino acids GLU272, ASP293 that takes part in the cation hydrate coat reorganization. We observed that ligand binding for the native form of the 5-HT3 receptor is energetically more favorable than those for modified forms. Our results reveal the relationship between the structure and the different activities of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptors and may be useful in neurophysiological and pharmacological studies.",

Interestingly, the interaction of S100A6 with Sgt1 attenuates the Sgt1-Hsp90 complex (4) . It was revealed that the Sgt1 protein has co-chaperone properties and is up-regulated by heat shock (5) . Apart from, Sgt1 translocates to the nucleus after heat shock (6) similarly as the heat shock proteins (7; 8). Thus, in present studies we focused on the influence of posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation on Sgt1 translocation. Since it is known that Sgt1 is phosphorylated at Cterminus by CKII (2) and phosphorylation of Sgt1 at serine 361 (homolog of serine 299 in human) is important for nuclear accumulation of Sgt1 in yeast (9) we prepared mutants of hSgt1 S249A, S299A and S249/299A, which are theoretically nonphosphorylated, and then we checked whether these mutants translocate to the nucleus after stress. We have found that nonphosphorylated mutants of Sgt1 translocate more efficiently than Sgt1wt after heat shock. Moreover this translocation occurs only in cells with unchanged level of S100A6 in the contrary to cells with diminished level of S100A6 where the level of Sgt1 in nucleus does not increase. We also found that inhibition of CKII is not sufficient to force nuclear presence of Sgt1, but in conjunction with heat shock triggers elevated nuclear accumulation of Sgt1. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a human pathogen associated with gastroenteritis caused by the ingestion of contaminated raw seafood. V. parahaemolyticus is able to survive exposure to low temperatures typical of those used for refrigeration of foods, by entering a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. The VBNC cells can regain culturability and renewed ability to cause infection upon temperature upshift. The resuscitation promoting factor protein (Rpf, YeaZ) is essential for reactivation of growth. Analysis of the crystal structures of YeaZ from E. coli, T. maritima, S. typhimurium and V. parahaemoliticus reveals that these proteins share a common actin-like nucleotide-binding fold. Yeaz is thought to function as a dimer. Two different forms of dimers have been identified in the crystal structures. In one form, prevalent in the absence of nucleotide, a putative nucleotide binding site is incomplete, lacking a binding pocket for a nucleotide base. In the second form, an interface between the two subunits completes a nucleotide binding site. This suggests that the two dimer architectures observed in the crystal structures correspond to a free and a nucleotide-bound forms of YeaZ. A multiple sequence alignment of YeaZ proteins from different bacteria allowed us to identify a large conserved hydrophobic patch on the protein surface which becomes exposed upon nucleotide-driven dimer rearrangement. We hypothesize that the transition between two dimer architectures represents the transition between the 'on' and 'off' states of YeaZ, the effect of which is to alternately expose and bury a docking site for a partner protein YgjD, as part of the role of YeaZ in resuscitation.",

Its carboxyl-terminal region is responsible for the translation-termination activity, whereas the amino-terminal region accounts for alternate folding depending on the conformation. Sup35 forms oligomers and amyloid like fibrils under specific experimental conditions. TEM assays revealed that fulllength Sup35p and its isolated N-terminal domain assemble into fibrillar structures with different structural and morphological features: full-length protein fibrils are wide and tend to bundle, Sup35p N-domain fibrils are thin and do not bundle. MTT assay showed that fibrils grown 48 hours are more cytotoxic than their precursor oligomeric forms. Immunolocalization experiments on H-END cells that were treated with Sup35 fibrils and oligomer indicated that fibrils bind the cell membrane without penetrating the cell; the interaction with the cell membrane involves ganglioside GM1 leading to raft structural reorganization, aggregation and GM1 clustering. To assess the importance of fibrils binding to membrane rafts on subsequent toxicity the lipid fraction of the cell membrane was modified by reducing cholesterol (treatment with methyl-b-cyclodextrin) and ganglioside GM1 (treatement with neuraminidase) content. Each treatment resulted in lipid raft disassembly and reduced fibril interaction with the plasma membrane and cytotoxicity. GM1 lateral mobility was investigated by single-molecule studies using quantum dots and was found to be heavily affected by fibrillar Sup35-mediated GM1 clustering in the plasma membrane. These data underline the importance of GM1 not only in protein/peptide recruiting, misfolding and aggregation at the cell membrane, but also establish GM1 as key player for the interaction of preformed amyloid like structures with cell membranes and hence, a key factor for fibril toxicity.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of pre-organized structure in the denatured state accelerates the folding process, therefore implying that the residual structure is native-like. In this context, we report the molecular details for both the transition state for folding and the denatured state. The structure of the transition state was defined by standard F-value analysis, whereas residual structure in the denatured state was mapped by evaluating the effect of mutations as modulated by conditions promoting denatured state compaction. Our data show that folding of Cter-NPM1 proceeds via an extended nucleus and that the denatured state retains significant structure at the interface between the second and third helices of the overall three-helix bundle organization. Our observations constitute the essential pre-requisite for structure-based drugdesign studies. In fact, since a major feature of Cter-NPM1 mutants responsible for AML is a reduced stability of the protein and thus prevalence of a denatured state under physiological conditions, the design of pharmaceuticals capable of interacting with the 'pathological' mutants, stabilizing the native conformation, is potentially a potent tool to counteract the leukemic alterations.",

The recombinant form of the enzyme (rFerB) purified from an expression strain of E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS had a bell shaped pH activity profile during chromate reduction with a maximum at 5.0. Although rFerB and FerB shares a similar specific activity, secondary structure and dimeric composition, the recombinant protein is dramatically more sensitive to aggregation. The stoichiometry ratio of NADH to chromate differed in the presence or absence of oxygen. The interaction of chromate with reduced rFerB generated a flavin radical detected by a fast diode-array spectrophotometer. Along with increasing electron eflux to oxygen, redox cycling observed before with 1,4-naphthoquinone [1] , was proposed with Cr(V) as the main intermediate generated by one-electron reduction mechanism. Rate of chromate depletion from a mineral medium was nearly same for the wild strain of P. denitrificans and its mutant with the knock-out ferB gene. On the contrary, the growth of the ferB mutant was more sensitive to chromate inhibition than its parental type. It appears, therefore, that rather than a direct chromate reducer, FerB is a protective enzyme against redox stress. Discovery of proteins expressed in the central nervous system sharing the three-finger structure with snake a-neurotoxins provoked much interest to their role in brain functions. Prototoxin lynx1, having homology both to Ly6 proteins and three-finger neurotoxins, is the first identified member of this family membrane-tethered by a GPI anchor, which considerably complicates in vitro studies. We were able to develop an effective system for bacterial expression of water-soluble domain of human lynx1 lacking a GPI anchor (ws-lynx1). We report for the first time the NMR spatial structure for ws-lynx1 and its concentration-depen-dent activity on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Performed binding experiments demonstrate that at 5-30 lM ws-lynx1 competed with 125I-a-bungarotoxin for binding to the acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) and to Torpedo nAChR. Exposure of Xenopus oocytes expressing a7 nAChRs to 1 lM ws-lynx1 enhanced the response to acetylcholine but no effect was detected on a4b2 and a3b2 nAChRs. Increasing ws-lynx1 concentration to 10 lM caused a modest inhibition of these three nAChR subtypes. NMR and functional analysis both demonstrate that ws-lynx1 is an appropriate model to shed light on the mechanism of lynx1 action. Computer modeling, based on ws-lynx1 NMR structure and AChBP X-ray structure, revealed a possible mode of ws-lynx1 binding.",

The research of structural-function relationship of proteins, in particular, detection their functional ligand-binding sites, is one of the key stage of structure-based rational drug design. It is known that the biological function of protein is determined by their spatial organization. In cases, when protein 3D structure is known a prediction of binding sites is based on its analysis and research. In this paper we present the developed by us new approaches to analysis and research the spatial structures of proteins for recognition their binding sites and creation functional oligopeptide analogues. For detection of potential binding sites of proteins we consider it is expedient to detect cavities on protein surface and to investigate the hydrophobic properties and charge distribution in cavities and on protein surfaces. We was developed the program composed of three modules which allow us to build the molecular protein surfaces (Connolly algorithm of presentation of the surface by points); to detect the cavities on protein surfaces and to carry out the analysis of hydrophobic areas and charge distribution on the cavities and protein surfaces. For detection of cavities on protein surfaces we have chosen the SurfNet algorithm as a basis and modified it. Modifications designed by us decrease the number of false-positive and falsenegative cavities detection; it rejects pseudo-cavities and defines cavities with the non-conical shape of a surface. Using this program a new binding sites of human thyroperoxidase, caspase 7 and 9, human G-CSF and some others proteins have been successfully forecasted. The low molecular weight analogs of these sites were synthesized and their availability to bind with corresponding receptors has been showed in vitro. Some of designed peptides already are used as ligands in absorbents for elimination of pathogenic metabolites from patient's serum. Bacterial cells use two-component signal transduction and chemotaxis systems to sense and respond to environmental changes conditions (1) . Geobacter sulfurreducens (Gs) is an anaerobic bacterium with a considerable respiratory versatility whose genome encodes for an unusual family of ten heme sensor proteins, each containing at least one heme c-binding motif. These sensors are formed by a N-terminal tail in the cytoplasm, followed by a transmembrane helix, a periplasmic sensor domain, another transmembrane helix and cytoplasmic transducer domains (3). These proteins constitute a new class of bacterial heme-based sensors, since the others described in the literature are located in the cytoplasm and contain b-type hemes. The expression trials of Gs sensor domains showed that those encoded by genes gsu0582 and gsu0935 expressed the best. The functional and structural characterization of these domains showed that both form swappeddimers and display similar spectroscopic properties, as revealed by UV-visible, NMR, EPR and Raman studies (3, 4) . In addition, they also bind the same effector molecules, though with different affinity (4) . The functional differences are beyond the affinity for small molecules, such CO and NO, extending also to heme reduction potentials and kinetics properties. The differences in their reduction potentials may have physiological relevance, since it could allow the bacteria to adapt to environment redox potential changes by triggering adequate metabolic responses. Isotopic labeled (13C and 15N) samples of the sensor domains GSU0582 and GSU0935 have been produced and NMR structural studies are in progress toward the elucidation of their functional mechanisms. Phospholamban (PLN) is a major regulator of the sarco-and endoplasmic Ca2 + -ATPase (SERCA) and in this context is involved in the contractility of cardiac muscle by regulating the intracellular calcium concentration (Ca2 + cyt) of cardiac myocytes. PLN is an integral membrane protein, which exists in equilibrium between monomer and pentamer. Monomeric, unphosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA, whereas PLN phosphorylation releases the inhibition and allows calcium translocation into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Various details on the structure of PLN in relation to its activity are still a matter of debate [1, 2] . Understanding its mode of action remains a major challenge having implications that range from basic protein structure-function studies to clarify heart function and drug development. We combined conductivity measurements on microBLMs and single channel recordings on traditional BLM in order to figure out if the PLN pentamer can have ion channel activity. Both techniques reveal that PLN can act as an ion channel, which is permeable to small ions, e.g. Na + and K + , but not to bigger choline (Cho + ) ion (radius 3,3 \u00c5 ). Single channel fluctuations are characterized by two conductance levels, and long open/ closed dwell times in the order of 100 ms. Moreover we provided experimental evidence that the PLN antibody (abPLN) can inhibit the PLN generated channel activity. Dengue fever and its variations (dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome) afflict annually more than 100 million people worldwide and is characterized as an ever emerging problem. Efforts to combat the virus have been made for decades now, and still no vaccines are available, mostly because of the difficulty to comprise means to inhibit all four dengue virus serotypes. Advancements with the use of monoclonal antibodies have shown a good level of viral inhibition in the host entry process for most of the serotypes. The epitope for dengue virus (DENV) is the domain III (EDIII -from residues 296-394 for DENV-2) of the envelope glycoprotein (E) and it is shown that its structure has a great affinity with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) Fab-1A1D-2. The surface of interaction between the Fab-1A1D-2 and the EDIII is characterized by a typical antibody-antigen area of contact, about 940 \u00c5 2 . The region of EDIII which interacts with the antibody is constituted by the residues (for DENV-2) 305-312, 325, 364, 388 and 390. This is our region of interest, and we assess by molecular dynamics assays how are the effects on the interactions in this area of contact when the virus is submitted to thermodynamic variations during its entry in the extra and intracellular host environment. Our focus here is to check the domain III for topological and structural deviations, along with the variations of electrostatic surface and hydrophobic interactions. We found significantly differences on the binding site on the EDIII surface; the temperature is a determinant factor for a higher affinity between the parts, and its physiological value, the binding of the antibody is suggested to increase. Also, the pH fluctuation causes the binding site to undergo electrostatic changes and is allegedly another important factor to adjust the molecular adherence forces on the local of interaction.",

            "text": "To this aim, we are currently studying the CcmI protein, whose function is largely unknown. It has been suggested that it may act as a specific chaperone handling the unfolded apo-cyt to be presented to the hypothetical Cytc-heme synthase, CcmF. There is no structural information available on CcmI homologues; sequence alignments and secondary structure prediction methods suggest that CcmI from P. aeruginosa is composed of a N-terminal anchoring helix and a periplasmically oriented domain containing TPR motifs (probably involved in the recognition of apocyt) followed by an a/b domain at the C-terminus. CcmI has been cloned and purified in a soluble state; we are involved in an extensive screening of the crystallization conditions in order to obtain direct 3D information on this elusive protein. A non-heme iron dioxygenase, (namely catechol 1,2 dioxygenase -1,2 CTD-) was studied as a test-case to validate computational tools that would predict active site recognition properties. A 3D model of 1,2-CTD was generated by homology modeling and compared to crystallographic coordinates [1] . In addition, 15 active site variants were modeled introducing the alternative approach of rotamer library explorer. GRID and BIOCUBE4mf [2] were applied on the final models to extract some typical features from each mutant. Some of pre-existing experimental data on 1,2-CTD and active site mutants [3] were used to validate the reliability of the predictions. To confirm the applicability of this new strategy to identify novel mutations, two mutants were produced (I101A and I101V) that were predicted to have improved recognition on polychlorinated substrates. Steady-state kinetic studies confirmed that Ile101is crucial for substrate recognition and that alternative residues differently affect KM and kcat. In addition, two novel mutants, L69G and A72C, were also analyzed experimentally, confirming a good agreement with the in silico predicted behaviour. Marked differences were detected by GRID/ BIOCUBE4mf in terms of chlorine interactions (CL-) among different mutants and these are in line with the trend of the experimental KM values. Also modulation of hydrogen bonding pattern was correctly predicted by the computational method. The approach is particularly suitable in focusing the effect of amino acid substitution, highlighting subtle differences that might greatly affect enzymological properties, and it is a good predicting tool for protein engineering as well as for selection of improved biocatalyst and study of mutational variants in medicinal chemistry. The significance of the non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs, siR-NAs and piRNAs in post-transcriptional gene regulation has been well established for a wide range of eukaryotic organisms including humans. The family of RNA 2'-O-methyltransferases which is largely involved in the biogenesis of miRNAs and siR-NAs in plants as well as piRNAs in animals is also found in metazoa, fungi, and bacteria. The HEN1 RNA methyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes the methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to miRNAs and siRNAs. We demonstrate that unlike animal homologs, which methylate single-stranded RNA substrates in vitro, HEN1 displays a strong preference towards the duplex RNAs and can efficiently modify both strands of miRNA/miRNA* to completion. Pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic studies provided profound mechanistic details of the substrate interactions and contribution of the particular steps during the HEN1-directed catalysis. A series of the HEN1 deletion variants were employed for the in-depth analysis of the functional importance and the interplay of the methyltransferase domains.",

P\u0142ucienniczak Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, Department of Bioengineering Plasmids are the most abundant extrachromosal elements in bacteria. Over the years they become the potent tool in molecular biology. That is why our group from Department of Bioengineering IBA searches for new plasmids of applicable potential such as pIGMS31-a cryptic plasmid from Klebsiella pneumoniae (GenBank Accession No. AY543072). In order to identify its potential applications it was necessary to determine its molecular biology and mechanism of replication. The analysis of the pIGMS31 nucleotide sequence of repM gene and the analysis of amino acid sequence of RepM protein coded by this gene suggest that the plasmid belongs to a rolling circle replication (RCR) group. Here we present the data showing the role of RepM protein in replication of plasmid pIGMS31 DNA. We performed the mutagenesis experiments showing that pIG-MS31 plasmid replication is RepM dependent. The RepM deficient mutant named pIGMS31M0 was created by site directed mutagenesis changing the ATG start codon to TAG (stop codon). repM expression was blocked in translation step due to the point mutation. pIGMS31 and its RepM deficient derivative pIGMS31M0 poses kan gene conditioning resistance to kanamycin. E. coli transformants growth on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin was used as the indicator of replication and maintenance ability of pIGMS31M0 alone and in presence of expression vector providing replication protein RepM in trans. Analysis of in silico predicted amino acids sequence of repM gene product revealed existence of conserved motif characteristic for nicking domains of RCR initiators. This seven amino acids motif uxxYuxK contains the active site tyrosine. We examined the role of this tyrosine residue in RepM activity by site directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis to change tyrosine residue into phenylalanine was performed with plasmid pT7repM resulting pT7repMY78F. Next using two plasmids based system we measured ability of pT7rep-MY78F to restore mutation in RepM deficient pIGMS31M0.",

The intricate and yet highly stereo-and regio-specific cationic cyclization/rearrangement mechanism is of considerable interest both in considerations on the origin of sterol biosynthesis and protein engineering for pharmaceutical applications. To further substantiate the functional role of the Cys703 in ERG7 catalysis and its interaction with Phe699, we performed the site-saturated mutations of Cys703 and the Phe699/Cys703 double mutations, and characterized the product profiles. The ERG7C703I mutation generates an unusual truncated bicyclic rearranged intermediate related to iridal-skeleton triterpenoid, (8R, 9R, 10R)-polypoda-5, 13E, 17E, 21-tetraen-3 b-ol, in conjunction with tricyclic, unrearranged tetracyclic with 17 a/b exocyclic hydrocarbon side chain, truncated rearranged, and chairchair-chair truncated tricyclic intermediates. These results indicated the functional role of Cys703 in stabilizing the bicyclic C-8 cation and the rearranged intermediate, via interaction with Phe699, and opened a new avenue of engineering ERG7 for pharmaceutical applications. The structure-function-mechanism relationships of Cys703 on the catalytic activity of ERG7 will be discussed. pounds such as antiviral and anticancer drugs.

As one of rare sugar producible enzymes, Acinetobacter sp. Lribose isomerase (L-RI) which is able to catalyze a reversible isomerization between L-ribose and L-ribulose has been cloned and was reported as a homo tetrameric enzyme before. The amino acid sequence of L-RI does not show any similarity based on homology analysis with known amino acid sequences of PDB. To elucidate the unique substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism, which is expected to differ from the well-known isomerases, X-ray structural analysis is essential. In our previous study, we have succeeded in overexpression, purification and crystallization of recombinant His-tagged L-RI. We report here the crystal structure of Acinetobacter sp. L-RI. The structure of L-RI was solved by using selenomethionine-substituted L-RI. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and it looks forming a dimer in the crystal. The overall structure of subunit showed a cupin-type beta-barrel and has a metal ion coordinated with three His and one Glu and two water molecules in active site, which is similar to that of currently reported D-lyxose isomerase from the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 (PDB ID: 3MPB), however the sequence identity, the r.m.s.d., and Z score between them is 18, 2.8, and 15.9%, respectively in Dali search.

These proteins have a great value in the conversion of ketones into the corresponding esters and lactones, bioremediation purposes and green chemistry applications such as the synthesis of chiral intermediates without the use of strong chemical oxidants as peracids. A novel BVMO gene from Acinetobacter radioresistens S13 was cloned in the expression vector pT7, successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified in high yields (20 mg/l culture) using anion exchange and Nickel affinity chromatography. The characterization showed a 57 kDa soluble protein with a tightly but non-covalently bound FAD that can be reversibly reduced by NADPH in anaerobiosis. Due to the large substrate specificity of BVMOs, a 3D homology model of this enzyme was generated in order to select its putative substrates. For this purpose, docking experiments were carried out using the HIC UP and Drug Bank databases (more than 10000 proteins' co-crystallized ligands). According to the energy output of the docking experiments, a selection of putative substrates of biotechnological interest (drugs and environmental pollutants) was screened by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The purified BVMO enzyme was observed to catalyze S-and N-oxidation of human flavin containing monooxygenase 3 substrates including ethionamide (antituberculosis drug), danusertib and tozasertib (anticancer drugs), with Km values in the micromolar range. This work reports on the various catalytic activities of this novel enzyme. The exosome is a major eukaryotic nuclease that contributes to the processing, quality control, and turnover of a large number of cellular RNAs. Previously this assembly has been described as a 3'-5' exonuclease with ring structure contained nine proteins [1] which are catalytically inactive in the human and yeast. As was established later, in yeast core exosome the exonuleolytic activity is regulated by the RNB domain and additional endoribonuclease activity which regulated by N-terminal PIN domain of Rrp44 protein [2] . Sequence-specific assignment of 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone resonances were done on PIN domain presented as 39-242 part of Rrp44 protein (204 residues long, molecular mass 23.7 kDa) synthesized and purified in 2H, 13C, 15N triple labeled form. NMR experiments were performed on sample contained 0.5 mM protein dissolved in 90%/10% H2O/D2O, 10 mM TRIS-d11, and 150 mM NaCl using Varian VNMRS 800 NMR spectrometer equipped with cryogenic probehead. First inspection of recorded 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum yielded 151 out of 190 expected signals from amide 1H-15N groups. 1H, 13C, and 15N assignments of backbone resonances were done by jointed analysis of 3D HN (CO) CA/ HNCA and HN (COCA) CB/HNCB NMR datasets. As result, 1H, 15N, 13C', 13Ca, and 13Cb chemical shifts for 151 residues were successfully defined and used for prediction of / and w torsion angles by TALOS+ software. Position of a-helises and b-strands, deduced from TALOS data, described overall 3D fold of PIN domain as baba2bab2a2, similarly to known X-ray structure [3] . Further details of structural studies will be presented on the poster. is activated and it synthesizes ADP-ribose (PAR) able to target several proteins, including human DNA topoisomerase I (topoI). TopoI is an enzyme involved in the control of DNA torsional stress. The catalytic cycle of topoI consists of DNA cleavage with formation of a covalent DNA-enzyme intermediate, relaxation of the DNA stress, and religation of the break. If along the DNA molecule there are lesions, topoI may get trapped causing secondary DNA damage, that, if unrepaired, may lead to genomic instability or cell death. A class of anticancer drugs, beloging to the camptothecins family, acts stabilizing the topoI cleavage complexes, and inhibiting the religation. Three regions have been suggested to be involved in a non-covalent PAR interactions, two in the 'core' domain (topoI 261-280 e topoI 532-551) and one in the 'linker' domain (topoI 669-688). The non-covalent binding has a dual effect, inhibiting the cleavage, and stimulating the religation. The inhibition of cleavage prevents the further formation of cleaved topoI-mediated complexes along the DNA, while the stimulation of the religation allows the trapped-topoI to religate the strand, avoiding further DNA damage. The increase in the religation rate is also observed in presence of camptothecin, inducing the drug resistance. In order to identify the specific PAR topoI binding site, a set of site specific mutants have been prepared and their properties have been characterized in terms of PAR binding and of relaxation function. The results indicate a complex behavior diagnostic of the presence of a multiple interaction between PAR and topoI.",

They have a key role in skin aging homeostasis as evidenced by the accelerated decline in skin appearance seen in the premenopausal years. They increase collagen content and skin thickness and improve skin moisture. However, despite the knowledge that estrogens have such important effects on skin, the cellular and sub cellular sites and mechanisms of estrogen action are still poorly understood. Phytoestrogens, non-steroidal plant compounds with estrogenlike biological activity, in particular isoflavones are promising alternative for skin aging treatment. Our studies are focused on Trifolium pratense extract effects on fibroblasts proliferative status: cell cycle and successive generation progression, correlated with intracellular calcium mobilization. In order to simulate estrogen depletion, fibroblasts cell line HS 27 were harvested in estrogen-free medium and compared with those grown in normal conditions 'in vitro'. The positive control was 17-b-estradiol, known for its action on skin physiology. We proved the hormone-like action for the phytocompounds from Trifolium pratense extract, in accordance with those of 17b-estradiol and the commercial standards available: acceleration of proliferative status, accompanied by the intracellular calcium mobilization in estrogen depletion condition. The phyto-estrogen role of Trifolium pratense extract may provide important clinical applications for the prevention and treatment of skin disorders. Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is one of the causes of the 'common cold' in human during seasons of cold weather. The N-terminal domain of coronaviral N proteins (N-NTDs) provides a scaffold for RNA binding. Here, we determined the structure of N-NTD (residues 58 to 195) from HCoV-OC43 in Hexagonal form at 1.7 \u00c5 . HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (residues 58-195) containing single-domain beta-sheet core and flexible loops is similar to SARS-CoV N-NTD structure in overall topology. Several residues including R106, R122, Y124, and R164 located in the five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet core are probably involved in RNA binding. We were undertaking a series of sitedirected mutagenesis to mutate these residues to Ala and characterized their RNA-binding activity by surface plasmon resonance. We found R106A, R122A, Y124A, and R164A have lower RNA-binding affinity in comparison with wild-type and suggested their crucial roles in RNA-binding. The pocket near Y124 located in the center of N-NTDs was predicted as nucleotidebinding site and drug target by docking experiments. We have identified several compounds that could binds to the pocket site Aggregation of insulin molecules into highly structured amyloid fibrils with an extensive content of beta-sheet is induced under solution conditions that promote partially unfolding, such as low pH, temperature and agitation. In present study, kinetic of amyloid fibril formation is followed by ThT fluorescence, circular dircroism, congo red and atomic force microscope (AFM). Toxicity of amyloid fibrils for cells is associated with hydrophobic side chains that expose to solvent and their interactions with cellular compounds or cell membrane. Surface tension changes of solution are attributed to hydrophobicity changes of insulin structure and are detected by Du Nou\u00a8y Ring method. There are some intermediates such as oligomers and protofibrils during formation of fibrils. Surface tension of these intermediates is detected and corresponding results show that hydrophobicity of solution is enhanced by forming of oligomeric and protofibrillar structure in comparison with fibrillar one that indicates oligomers and protofibrils may be more toxic than mature fibrils for cells.",

To investigate the effect of antibiotics, assay mixtures contained 14 mg/ml ampicillin or coamoxiclav which corresponded to their maximum concentrations in the plasma after injection. The results have shown that peroxidase activity of Hp(1-1)-Hb complex is modulated via homotropic effect of hydrogen peroxide as an allostric substrate at higher concentrations of H 2 O 2 . On the other hand antioxidant property of Hp(1-1)-Hb complex decreased via heterotropic effect of both antibiotics on the peroxidase activity of the complex. Both antibiotics have also mild effect on quality of homotropic property of the peroxidase activity in Hp(1-1)-Hb complex. Therefore our in vitro studies show that the two antibiotics may increase oxidative stress via heterotropic effect in those individuals with Hp(1-1) phenotype by decreasing the Hp-Hb complex efficiency on removing hydrogen peroxide from serum. BTB domain of Drosophila GAGA-factor (GAF) is a rare example of isolated protein domain able to support long-distance interactions in the genome, and the only BTB domain found to form multimers, whereas others are dimers.

Crosslinking experiments revealed presence of major multimer corresponding to the 8mer much likely composed with canonical BTB-dimers.

Using yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that BTB domains inside the GAF's group can specifically interact with GAF. Multimerization mutant of GAF BTB has almost the same binding specificity but failed to self-interact suggesting heterodimerization mechanism of heterologous interactions. At the same time, BTB domain of CP190, not belonging to GAGAgroup can form only dimers and fails to interact with BTB domains from the GAF's group. Unexpectedly, GAGA factor fails to support long-distance interaction between GAL4 activator and the white promoter in adult flies but can increase white expression in embryos suggesting that this activity of GAF is not universal and is precisely regulated. Angiotensin type II (AT2) receptor displays agonist-dependent and -independent activities, coupling to a spectrum of signalling molecules that include phosphatases, kinases, G proteins and Na + , K + -ATPase. Despite the large volume of work on AT2 receptor, consent cannot be reached on the cellular distribution, signalling cascade and receptor function. In the present study, rat AT2 receptors tagged with GFP, myc, HA or FLAG were transiently or stably expressed in HEK293, CHO-K1, and PC12 cells, evaluating the effects of species and tissue specificity on AT2 receptor expression. AT2 receptor was mainly detected on cell membrane and perinuclear region, and existed as monomer (40 kDa) as well as oligomers (70 -250 kDa). However, levels of expression, cellular distribution and receptor oligomerization depended on cell type and tagging. Stably transfected HEK293 cells gave the highest expression of N-terminal myc-tagged AT2 on the cell surface. Intriguingly, AT2 receptor oligomers were enriched in cell membrane, and glycosylation promoted membrane localization of myc-AT2 but had no effect on AT2-GFP. Functionally, AT2 receptor mediated different cellular responses in different cell types. Serum starvation induced apoptosis in stably AT2-expressing CHO cells but exerted no effect on HEK293 and PC12 cells. However, AT2-expressing HEK293 and PC12 cells exhibited a partial cell cycle blockage with cells accumulating at G1 and S phases, respectively. Although showing similar cellular distribution, transiently expressed myc-AT2 receptor existed predominantly as monomer with ladder of high molecular weight forms in HEK293 cells, suggesting a posttranslational modification. Co-expression analysis indicated transiently expressed AT2 receptor was ubiquitinated. Unexpectedly, western analysis of day 19 mouse embryo suggested the embryonic AT2 receptor expression pattern was similar to that of transiently expressed AT2 receptor and putatively ubiquitinated. Sertoli cells (SC) serve as nursing cells for developing germ cells (GC) and are under hormonal and paracrine regulation. The provision by SC of adequate levels of energy substrates for GC development is essential. It is known that SC produce ketone bodies (KB) and that GC express a specific isoform of succinil-CoA transferase (SCOT-t), which metabolizes KB in order to obtain energy. Two essential enzymes in KB production are carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT I) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase (mHMG-CoA-s). The presence of these enzymes in the testis has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was: (i) to analyze the presence of CPT I and of mHMG-CoA-s in SC and (ii) to evaluate the regulation of KB production and of CPT I and mHMG-CoA-s expression by GC and bFGF -one of the growth factors secreted by GC. SC cultures obtained from 31-day-old rats were maintained under basal conditions (B), co-cultured with GC -obtained from the same animals -, or incubated with bFGF (30 ng/ml). KB production was estimated by the determination of 3-b-hydroxybutirate levels in conditioned media; CPT I and mHMG-CoA-s mRNA levels were determined by Northern Blot. Incubation of SC with GC (GC/SC) for 48 hours increased KB production (B: 8.1 \u00b1 1.4, GC/SC: 19.1 \u00b1 3.2 lM/lgDNA*; X \u00b1 DS, n = 3, *p < 0.01). Presence of CPT I and mHMG-CoA-s in SC and up-regulation by GC were demonstrated. Stimulation of SC with bFGF for 72 hours increased KB production (B: 15.1 \u00b1 3.5, bFGF: 22.3 \u00b1 1.8 lM/lg DNA*; X \u00b1 DS, n = 3, *p < 0.05) and this increase was preceded by an increase of CPT I expression. Altogether, these results suggest that GC might regulate KB production in SC by modulating CPT I and mHMG-CoA-s expression. Since bFGF exerted similar effects on KB production and gene expression, it is tempting to speculate that this growth factor may be involved in paracrine regulation of energy status in the seminiferous tubules.",

            "text": "Functional role of the specific neuro-cardiac interaction on cardiomyocyte beta-AR activation Background:Beta adrenergic stimulation is the most important physiologic mechanism regulating cardiac function in stress or exercise, and it is involved in the several cardiovascular diseases including heart failure and arrhythmias. Based on both in vivo and in vitro evidence, a direct, regulated, cell-to-cell interaction between sympathetic neurons and cardiomyocytes (CM), has been proposed. To date, the functional role of a neuro-cardiac junction on intracellular CM signalling has never been assessed directly. To determine the mechanism of signalling at the neurocardiac junction, we have used co-cultures of mouse sympathetic ganglia neurons (SGN) and neonatal CM. Methods:We transfected neonatal CM with the cAMP FRETbased sensor Epac1-cAMPs, allowing detection of intracellular cAMP changes in real time. The following day SGN were isolated from the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of 1-or 2-day neonatal wt mice and plated onto CMs at a 1 : 10 ratio. At day 4, co-cultures were assayed with FRET imaging. Results:Stimulation of neuronal release of norepinephrine by the sympathetic terminal, as obtained with bradykinin (5 lM), caused cAMP levels to increase (DR/R0 = 5.8%, n = 10) specifically in the CMs coupled with the SGN. The cAMP increase was not affected by rapid perfusion of the cells with the bathing solution (n = 8), indicating that the 'synaptic' cleft determines a diffusion-restricted domain. In addition, we recorded a temporal delay in the cAMP rise of distal CM regions in comparison to CM regions in contact with the innervating SNs (time to peak = 25 seconds, proximal region versus 40 seconds, remote region). In contrast, direct application of NE to the cell bath resulted in uniform increase of cAMP in the whole cell, without localization restrictions or intracellular gradients. These results suggest for the first time a functional role of a non-random neuro-cardiac junction in intercellular signalling physiologically activating b-AR axis. Oral loads of either glucose or fructose to healthy rats induced specific changes in the serine phosphorylation levels of a wide array of liver and skeletal muscle proteins. Thus, oral glucose loads (125 mg/100 g body weight) increased the phosphorylation of protein kinases and phosphatases like PI3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), ERK-2, PTP1B and also clathrin. In contrast, oral fructose loads (280 mg/100 g body weight), which resulted in similar glycemia and insulinemia levels as that produced by oral glucose loads, induced serine phosphorylation increases in PI3K, PKC, ERK-2, PTP1B and PTP2, as well as several cell cycle-regulating proteins, such as cyclin D3 and Cdk6, and cell-to-cell contact regulating proteins, like clathrin and clusterin. The alterations in liver were accompanied by specific variations of protein serine phosphorylation in peripheral muscle. These differed to those observed in liver. In this case, oral loads of glucose increased the phosphorylation of PTP1B, cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin H and Cdk2, and c-raf 1. In contrast, fructose at a dose in which glycemia and insulinemia were similar to that the obtained after glucose loading, increased only the muscle serine phosphorylation of PI3K. These results indicate that, in addition to the energy-fueling role of glucose and fructose, these sugars have specific roles as modulators of liver and skeletal muscle in vivo. Introduction: The sympathetic nervous system is the main physiological regulator of cardiac function. It has been proposed that specialized sympathetic neuron (SN)-cardiomyocyte (CM) interaction sites exist (neuro-cardiac junction, NCJ), but their structure and functional role are undetermined. Here, we sought to investigate the ultrastructure of NCJ and whether regulated cell-cell interaction has a role in CM-SN survival signaling. Results: Co-cultures between rat SN and CM were established to characterize the molecular and functional aspects of the NCJ. By using confocal immunofluorescence, we detected enrichment in b-catenin and cadherins in the post-synaptic membrane close to the SN active release sites. Interference with the main cell-tocell adhesion molecules, as achieved by incubating co-cultures with neutralizing anti-VCAM1 or anti-cadherins antibodies (8 ng/ll), ablated the SN-CM contact and resulted in SN degen-eration, and caused alterations of the NGF distribution, which was absent from the SN terminals displaced from the target CM. These data support the concept that cadherins and VCAM-1 regulate the cell-cell interaction, and have a role in regulating survival signaling from CM to the SN. Electron microscopy (EM) analyses of mouse heart slices suggested that a specialized NCJ exists. In fact, polarized sympathetic neuron terminals, with active catecholamine release sites in close interaction with the cardiomyocyte membrane, were found in the ventricle. Morphometry on the EM images demonstrated that the intermembrane space between SN and CM was in the order of 50-60 nm (similar to that of NMJ). Furthermore, increased protein density was observed in the CM membrane at the interaction site, further supporting the concept of specialized and locally organized signaling domains. Conclusion: Our results suggest that specific interaction sites between cardiac SN and CM (NCJ) exist and that the establishment and maintenance of NCJ is crucial for SN viability.",

Our previous 'Taq-Man Low Density Array' measurements predicted important role of many genes in phagocytosis, because their expression level heavily elevated during the early stage of the phagocytosis process. The four genes (ADORA2A, FPRL1, ICAM3, THBS1) with the most enhanced expression in human macrophages were knocked-down by RNA interference which was controlled by Western-blot and surface immunostaining at translational level. Significant decrease in phagocytic capacity was observed only after silencing ICAM3. Our goal was to investigate the role and interacting partners of ICAM3 transmembrane protein from both sides. Human monocytes were isolated from 'buffy coats' of healthy blood by magnetic separation using CD14 human microbeads. To examine the phagocytic capacity of 5 day differentiated macrophages, apoptotic neutrophil granulocytes were isolated from human blood by Histopaque density-gradient centrifugation. The phagocytosis assay was performed using fluorescent labeled cells and the incorporated cell-rate was measured by flow cytometry, immediately after pre-incubation of macrophages or apoptotic cells with blocking antibodies. Significant reduction of phagocytosis was noticed after blocking ICAM3 from both sides while that of DC-SIGN, which is a cited receptor for ICAM3, did not influence the engulfment of apoptotic cells. ICAM-3 participates in the recognition of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages from both sides not only as an adhesion molecule but also as an initiator of signaling pathways mediated by intracellular thyrosin kinases. To examine its interacting partners in this process further investigations have to be performed in the future. Cell-to-cell interactions of human mesenchymal multipotent stromal cells (MMSC) and rat renal tubular cells (RTC) were explored under conditions of co-cultivation. We observed formation of different types of intercellular contacts, including so called tunneling nanotubes. These contacts were shown to be able to provide transfer of cell's contents, including organelles. We documented intercellular exchange with fluorescent probes specific to cytosol, plasmalemma and mitochondria. Initial transport of cellular components was revealed after 3 hours of co-culturing, and occurred in two directions -both direct and retrograde as referred to RTC. However, transport of probes toward MMSC was more efficient. One significant result of such transport was appearance of renal-specific Tamm-Horsfall protein in MMSC, indicating induction of their differentiation into kidney tubular cells. We conclude that transfer of cellular compartments between renal and stem cells could provide differentiation of MMSC when transplanted into kidney and result in therapeutic benefits in renal failure.",

In this study, we investigated whether autocrine ABA regulates the response of the human key cells (i.e. granulocytes and keratinocytes) responsible for UV-B-triggered skin inflammation. Intracellular ABA concentration was increased in granulocytes and in the keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2544 exposed to UV-B (by approximately 4-fold over control, un-irradiated cells); moreover, ABA was also released into the supernatant by irradiated granulocytes and keratinocytes. We next investigated whether ABA is involved in UV-B-induced cell responses: UV-B-induced NO and ROS production, phagocytosis and migration were strongly inhibited in granulocytes irradiated in the presence of a monoclonal antibody against ABA (anti-ABA mAb), which prevents ABA effects. Moreover, the presence of the anti-ABA mAb strongly inhibited NO, PGE2 and TNF-a release upon UV-B irradiation of keratinocytes.",

Thus, human keratinocytes were transfected with a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for LANCL2 and in parallel with a negative control siRNA. After 24 hours, LANCL2 mRNA levels were decreased to approximately 30% compared with control cells, electroporated in the absence of siRNA. The silencing of LANCL2 was accompanied by abrogation of the UV-B-triggered release of PGE2, TNF-a and NO and ROS production. Altogether, these results indicate that UV-B irradiation induces ABA release from human granulocytes and keratinocytes and that autocrine ABA in turn stimulates cell functions involved in skin inflammation. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a severe autoimmune dermatosis induced by autoantibodies (Abs) to antigens expressed by stratified epithelial cells. Most known PV autoantibodies are directed to desmosomal cadherins desmogleins (DSG) 3 and 1. The pattern of DSG expression cannot explain all clinical PV manifestations. It is likely that other autoantigens such as desmocollins (DSC) or a9nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (a9nAChR) can induce pathological immune response. The aim of this work was the identification of other possible autoantigens involved in PV pathology. As the major location of PV lesions is stratified epithelium such as epidermis and mucosa we used cryosections of newborn rat head where all typical tissues are present. The sections were stained with either Abs to DSG1, 2, 3; DSC2, 3; PV serum or normal human serum. To identify a9nAChR expressed by typeII hair cells in cochlea, the sections were incubated with a-bungarotoxin-Alexa488 (a-BT). All sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Bright labeling of DSG1 and 3, DSC1 and 3 was found in epidermal layer, where PV staining was specific, demonstrating that PV auto Abs indeed recognize desmosomal cadherins. No specific binding was found for PV serum to typeII cochlea hair cells while these cells were visualized by a-BT. These results show that PV auto Abs do not recognize a9nAChR while it was reported earlier. We also identified specific binding of PV but not of normal human serum to pseudostratified epithelial cells (PSEC) of nasal cavity which produce mucous. It was not reported whether PSEC express desmosomal cadherins. When tested we found the expression of neither DSG2, 3 nor DSC2, 3 while PSEC in basal layer expressed DSG1. PV serum bound not only the basal layer but also the suprabasal one where known desmosomal cadherins were not expressed. It is well known that nasal cavity is highly affected by PV pathology. We believe that PSEC express some unidentified up to now autoantigen relevant to PV pathology.",

It accounts for 13% of hematologic malignancies, with an overall incidence of 1% on the diagnosed tumors. Despite new therapeutic approaches, MM remains an incurable disease. Difficult access to plasma cells limits the possibility of directly studying the pathophysiological mechanisms sustaining MM development and progression. The basic idea is to use functional molecules of MM or its microenvironment as therapeutic targets. To overcome the limitation of a difficult access to normal plasma cells, we established a cell line model from cells derived from pleural effusion of a highly aggressive, therapy refractory plasma cell leukemia patient. After two years of in vitro culture, the cell line (DL06) maintains stable the phenotypical characteristics (CD38++/CD19-/CD138+/HLA Class II+5%) and secretion of IgA/k light chain, comparable with the characteristics observed in the original human myeloma. DL06 cells express CD38 and CD138, as expected. A unexpected result is that the cells express high levels of the receptor for oxytocin (OTR). These results were also confirmed in freshly isolated samples of plasmocytoma containing different percentages of myeloma cells. Experience in CD38 KO mice have demonstrate that CD38 controls the release of oxytocin from neurohypophysis with resulting reduced plasma levels of the hormone. This condition is reverted in mice by the genetic reconstitution of CD38. In order to investigate the functional interactions between CD38 and OT/OTR system in myeloma, DL06 cells were treated with the agonistic anti-CD38 mAb IB4. The treatment is followed by up-modulation of OTR surface expression. A similar effect was observed for CD138 (Syndecan-1). Other molecules used as control (i.e., HLA Class I) were unaffected. To mimic physiological conditions, DL06 cells were co-cultured in presence of mouse fibroblasts transfected with human CD31 gene. CD38 ligation by CD31, a non-substrate ligand of CD38, is followed by modification of OTR expression. CD138 results unaffected. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that OT, administered in vitro may have a role in sustaining DL06 cell proliferation. In conclusion oxytocin is proposed as component of a chain of events involved in the growth of plasma cells, normal and pathological. A picture of signals generated from interaction between OTR and CD38 and secretion of OT will be confirmed by experiments of co-culture of murine fibroblasts expressing human OTR gene and DL06 cells.",

Interestingly, both lipids have been proposed to compete for such an interaction, ceramide displacing cholesterol from 'raft-like' liquid-ordered domains. In the present study, model lipid membranes containing saturated phospholipids, palmitoyl ceramide (pCer) and cholesterol have been characterized. Based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), confocal microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), the presence of stable lamellar gel (Lb) phases of ternary lipid mixtures has been observed. The mixtures exhibit gel (Lb) -fluid (La) phase transitions in the 55-65\u00b0C range as observed by DSC of multilamellar vesicles, and give rise to stable micron-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). The ternary phases are observed near the phospholipid:(ceramide + cholesterol) (1 : 1) lipid ratio and they occur either in the presence of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or of palmitoyl sphingomyelin (pSM). These phases are partially stabilized by direct hydrogen bonding between ceramide and cholesterol. However, the ternary lamellar gel phase is completely destabilized upon cholesterol substitution by 5-cholesten-3-one. Likewise, pCer substitution by dipalmitoyl glycerol (DPG) has a similar effect in the membrane, preventing the formation of the ternary phase. The data thus highlights the complexity of apparently simple ternary lipid systems, in which ceramide and cholesterol appear to cooperate rather than compete giving rise to ternary lamellar gel (L\u00df) phases of yet unknown biophysical and/ or biological properties. These lipid-lipid interactions are the basis of lateral phase segregation both in model membranes and in cells, particularly in the fields of sphingolipid-based membrane platform formation and cell signaling.",

            "text": "Diacilglycerol kinase alpha regulates central lumen formation through Annexin2 and Cdc42 Kidney proximal tubular cells (PTC) use the apical endocytic receptor, megalin, to recapture ultrafiltrated proteins. By analogy to LRP-1, megalin/LRP-2 was reported to signal via PI3-kinase (PI3K) class I. However, this conclusion was largely based on the broad-spectrum inhibitors wortmannin (WRM) and LY294002, which likely also inhibit Vps34p (class III), a key downstream effector of the rate-limiting regulator of apical endosomal function, Rab5. We therefore addressed which of these PI3-K isoforms is central in megalin-mediated endocytosis : PI3K-I (internalization) versus PI3K-III (endosomal maturation). In the PTC-derived OK cell line, we found that WRM and LY294002 slowed down apical endocytosis of megalin ligands by approximately twofold, but also decreased to the same extent their surface binding, implying that the internalization efficiency of bound ligands could be unaffected. Surface biotinylation confirmed a approximately twofold decrease of megalin surface pool after short LY294002 treatment suggesting intracellular sequestration. Upon WRM treatment, EEA1 was fully released from sedimentable membranes into the high-speed supernatant pointing to uncoupling of the Rab5-dependent machinery. PI3K inhibitors or sequestration of the PI3K product, PI3P, by overexpression of GFP-2XFyve, induced a major vacuolisation of apical endosomes. None of these effects were observed using ZSTK474, which efficiently inhibits PI3-K class-I and -II, but not class-III. Removal of LY294002 led to rapid shrinkage of the apical vacuoles and triggered the formation of long radial tubular extensions labelled with Rab5-, Rab11-, dynamin-GFP and GFP-2XFyve. Dynasore and Dyngo4 blocked tubule formation confirming dynamin dependence. We propose that class III-PI3K is the central isoform for apical receptor-mediated endocytosis in PTC by controlling receptor recycling and suggest that its understanding could shed light on genetic diseases of apical endocytic trafficking, including Lowe and Dent's diseases. We used genetically-encoded fluorescent probes to visualize the distribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) in live S. cerevisiae. The majority of the PS was found to reside in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Remarkably, PS was polarized, accumulating in bud necks, the bud cortex and the tips of mating projections. Polarization required vectorial delivery of PS-containing secretory vesicles. Rapid dissipation of the PS gradient is prevented by the slow diffusion of lipids along the plasmalemmal inner leaflet, estimated by photobleaching recovery measurements to be over an order of magnitude slower than in mammalian cells. Finally, PS is largely excluded from the endocytic vesicles, explaining the PS enrichment in the plasma membrane and contributing to PS polarization. In mutants lacking PS-synthase the absence of PS was associated with impaired polarization of the Cdc42 complex, leading to inhibition of bud emergence, diminished growth rate and abolishment of mating. Addition of lyso-PS lead to recruitment of the PS probe to the plasma membrane and polarization was seen in a large portion of the cells. A similar fraction of cells displayed re-polarization of GFP-Cdc42. The results indicate that PS and likely its polarization is required for optimal Cdc42 targeting and activation during cell division and mating. Analysis of the structural-functional organization of cell membranes, specifically, the studies of the functional state of betaadrenoreceptors is a topical problem in medicine and biology. Probe -cation DSM (derivative of styrilpyridinium) possess such properties as polychromaticity, sensitivity to the changes in polarity, viscosity of medium. The emission spectra of DSM in erythrocytes consists of two bands with the maxima at 560-565 nm (exc. 470 nm) and 610-620 nm (exc. 495 nm). The differences in the parameters of DSM binding to erythrocytes were found (1) at low and high adrenoreactivity of animals (guinea pigs, rats); (2) in pathological states(myocardial infarction, instable stenocardia etc.). Studies on increased adrenoreactivity in animals and patients groups revealed a decrease of DSM fluorescence intensity, K and increase of N as compared with the control data. At decreased adrenoreactivity of animals there was a lowerig of N and rise of K. Change of fluorescence intensity correlates with dynamics of change in parameter N and fluorescence intensity (560-565 nm). The similarity in the character of membrane response to the change in in the adrenoreactivity of the organism during the effects of stress factors and in diseases of the cardio-vascular system suggest that along with the structural rearrangement of the erythrocytes membrane the structural and functional properties of the adrenoreceptors also change.",

Probe DSM is promissing in studies of the cell membrane and functional state of beta adrenoreactive system in erythrocytes and the organism as a whole. Endocannabinoids are derivatives of arachidonic acid and of other poly-unsaturated fatty acids, that control basic biological processes, including the cell choice between survival and death, immune response, neurotransmission, energy homeostasis and reproduction. Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) is a prototype member of these bioactive lipids, and its biological activity is known to be subjected to a 'metabolic control'. Therefore, a dynamic equilibrium among biosynthetic, catabolic and oxidative pathways drives the intracellular concentration of AEA [1] . Soybean (Glycine max) lipoxygenase-1 (LOX-1) is a widely used prototype of the 'lipoxygenase family' of arachidonate-oxygenating enzymes. LOX-1 has been shown to recognize also AEA as substrate, thus generating natural derivatives termed 'hydroxyanandamides' [1] . With the aim of mimicking the in vivo conditions, where the interaction between LOX-1 and AEA is likely to occur mainly within cell membranes, here we sought to characte- It is well known that digitonin solubilizes mitochondrial membranes, breaks the integrity of the respiratory chain and consequently releases respiratory complexes. Generally, it is supposed that the inhibition of individual respiratory complexes is caused by the release of cytochrome c (cyto c) and coenzyme Q (CoQ) from membrane. Our aim was to assess the concentration dependence of the digitonin inhibitory effect and to estimate to which extent idebenone (hydroxydecyl-ubiquinone; IDE) is able to restore the original enzyme activity. In our study we followed two enzymes located on the outer and inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, glycerol-3-phosphate (GP) and succinate (SUC) cyto c oxidoreductase activities, respectively. We found 80% inhibition of GP cyto c oxidoreductase and 20% inhibition of SUC cyto c oxidoreductase by 2 mg digitonin/mg protein. We restored both enzyme activities by 20 lM IDE. Similarly, we could detect the inhibitory effect of digitonin on GPand SUC-dependent respiration. Under these experimental conditions we needed to add cyto c and IDE for the restoration of the respiratory rate. The similar effect as IDE (a synthetic analog of CoQ) had a short-chain homolog of CoQ, CoQ1. Our findings thus indicate that added IDE or CoQ1 and cyto c are able to restore the respiratory chain and electron flux from mitochondrial GP and SUC dehydrogenases to cyto c oxidase when the integrity of mitochondrial membrane was damaged by digitonin.",

The results show that levels of NADPH reductase (CPR) activity, determined immediately after capture, presents a significantly correlation (p < 0.01) with mGST, and ECOD activities and heme contents of P. marinus. These results taken together with those obtained in ammocoetes stayed in the aquaria for 30 days in freshwater or subjected to salt gradient up to 35 psu show also highly significant correlation (p < 0.001) between liver mGST levels and CPR, EROD, ECOD activities and heme content. The results reveal that agnathan, in the early phase of trophic migration, presents different functional expression of biotransformation enzymes regulated by AHR-ARNT system. This fact contributes to reveal the importance of this response and its ancestral role. Embryo developmental program sets up dynamic gene regulatory networks, by combining transcription factors, enzymatic activities and signaling molecules, to drive specific morphogenetic events. In sea urchins, the synthesis of the embryonic skeleton is a key example of directed cell migration and formation of cellular and structural patterns of considerable complexity orchestrated by an epithelial-mesenchymal signaling network.",

Although the biomineralization process is determined entirely by the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), strim1 gene expression in restricted regions of the ectoderm is required to guide the aggregation of the PMCs in two bilateral clusters from which skeletal elements will form. Indeed, strim1 overexpression by microinjection into developing embryo of the functional mRNA provokes severe skeletal abnormalities. Conversely, knock-down of strim1 function by injection of antisense morpholino-substituted oligonucleotides abrogates PMC positioning, prevents expression of ectoderm (pax2/5/8) and PMC (sm30) markers, and eventually blocks skeletogenesis. By blastomere transplantations we established that these defects specifically depend upon strim1 misexpression in the ectoderm. Furthermore, we show that a clonal source of strim1, superimposed on morphant embryos, is able to restore the correct skeletogenic program. A straightforward interpretation of these data is that Strim1, in ectoderm cells, evokes the emanation of diffusible molecules that trigger the biomineralizing behavior of the PMCs. Exactly, we report that Strim1 participates in the expression of FGF-A, which has been previously involved in skeletogenesis. We conclude that strim1 function is able to elicit specific gene expression both in ectoderm cells and PMCs to guide the skeletal morphogenesis. The transcription factor Pax8 is expressed during thyroid development and is involved in the morphogenesis of the thyroid gland and maintenance of the differentiated thyroid phenotype. To date, Pax8 has been shown to regulate all the genes that are considered markers of thyroid differentiation. To identify novel Pax8 target genes we performed a genome-wide expression analysis following Pax8 siRNA. The silencing of Pax8 expression in rat thyroid differentiated FRTL-5 cells and the subsequent analysis of the gene expression profile by microarray identified Wnt4 among the downregulated genes. Wnt4 is a secreted glycoprotein and, as the other members of the Wnt family, has been implicated in several developmental processes including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. No data are available on Wnt4 in the thyroid but we believe that it could be involved in thyroid morphogenesis and development. We focused our attention on the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which Pax8 could regulate Wnt4 expression in thyroid cells. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the Wnt4 gene identified a putative Pax8 binding site that we successfully validated in vitro by electromobility shift assays and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, transfection of FRTL-5 cells with different regions corresponding to progressive deletions of the 5'-flanking region of Wnt4 showed that all generated constructs possess a thyroid-specific activity. To better understand the role of Pax8 in Wnt4 expression, we mutagenized the identified Pax8 binding site and we tested the effects of the mutagenesis in promoter-reporter assays. The results obtained show that Pax8 is clearly involved in the transcriptional activity of the Wnt4 promoter. Taken together, our data indicate that in thyroid cells the transcription factor Pax8 participate to Wnt4 gene expression directly binding to its 5'-flanking region suggesting that Wnt4 is a new target of this master regulatory gene.",

            "text": "The role of transcription factors for the establishment of olfactory axons connections During embryonic development, the coordinated morphogenesis and differentiation of the olfactory placode (OPL) and the forebrain leads to the formation of the olfactory sensory system. Starting from early stage (E9.5), immature olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) elongate their axons to reach and contact the anterior forebrain. Axonal elongation is accompanied by migration on GnRH+ neurons, a process specifically impaired in the Kallmann's syndrome. Axon elongation is mediated by signals and interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme (i.e. morphogens, guidance molecules, ECM), but recent evidence identify specific transcription factors (i.e., Dlx5, Fez, Emx2) as master regulators of this process, and identify a set of genes and miRNAs essential for axon connectivity. We focus on the analysis of mice in which homeogene Dlx5 has been inactivated. Dlx5 is expressed in early ORNs and is essential for axon connectivity. We have obtained global profiles of expressed genes and microRNAs of wild-type and Dlx5-/-OPL. In particular, the miR-200 family is shown to be relevant for olfactory neurogenesis and is altered in the Dlx5 mutant neurons. Combining the obtained data with a genomewide co-expression network and the prediction of putative Dlx binding sites on the genome, we can now raise novel hypotheses on transcription regulation and signals coordinating epithelialmesenchymal interaction in neuroepithelial development and axon elongation. Added value in elucidating this embryonic process resides on the peculiarity of the adult peripheral olfactory system to renew its neural component, both physiologically as well as following a lesion: progenitor cells give rise to new neurons which extend axons to the OB and re-establish connections and topography. On the long term, investigations on the regulatory network used for olfactory connectivity may have more general implications for the biology of nerve regeneration an d repair. Melatonin is a neurohormone synthesized in the dark by the pineal gland from serotonin. It is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, of metabolism and has antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Low melatonin levels have been reported in patients with autism in several independent studies. Here we confirm the melatonin deficit in 200 patients with autism and their relatives. We show that melatonin deficit -observed in 60 percent of patients -is strongly correlated with low activity of ASMT, the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Exploration of the mechanisms of melatonin deficit involves identification of loss-of-function mutations in ASMT gene in a small number of patients, as well as a partial duplication of the gene, found significantly more frequently in patients with autism than in the general population. Furthermore, ASMT mRNA levels are significanlty reduced when quantified in blood cells of patients compared to controls, suggesting abnormal transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of ASMT. Melatonin deficit is associated with specific clinical features in patients, especially stereotyped behaviors. The melatonin pathway is a new therapeutic target in autism, frequently associated with sleep disorders -several clinical trials have reported a good efficiency of melatonin treatment for autism-associated sleep disorders. Pectin methylesterase (PME, EC: 3.1.1.11) is a ubiquitous multifunctional enzymatic component of the plant cell wall which plays role in defense against invading pathogens and also participates in cell wall modulation during general plant growth. PMEmediated pectin demethylation results in production of methanol. For a long time gaseous methanol was considered as a by-product of the PME-mediated pectin demethylation. However, our recent data has shown the role of methanol in plant-to-plant communication. Plant leaf wounding resulted in burst of methanol production and emission accompanied by up-regulating mostly defense and cell-to-cell communication genes of intact neighboring plant.",

IGF1 deficiency in the mouse causes respiratory failure at birth due to severe lung hypoplasia and collapsed alveoli. Prenatal lungs of Igf1-deficient embryos at embryonic stage (E) 18.5 display undifferentiated alveolar epithelium, altered vascular remodelling with dilated capillaries, and des-organized extracellular matrix (ECM). Our previous analysis on their differential mRNA expression identified candidate target genes of IGF1 during prenatal lung maturation related to vascular development, morphogenesis and cellular growth functions and to MAP-kinase, Wnt and cell-adhesion pathways. Here we tried to validate these results at the protein level by focusing on activation of signalling mediators and expression of regulatory genes with previously described lung function, IGF dependence, and/or related to lung cancer. By analyzing Igf1-deficient lungs, we were able to validate changes in Nfib (up-regulated) and Klf2 (down-regulated) transcription factors, in Ctgf matricellular protein (down-regulated), and in the activation of ERK1/2. To test IGF1 actions at the cellular and molecular level, we added the factor to either lung explants or different lung-derived cell types, followed by evaluation of changes in morphology and protein gene expression. Addition of IGF-I to E16.5 lung explants in culture induced alveolar maturation reflected by mesenchyme reduction, epithelium differentiation, and increased expression of Nfib, Klf2, Cyr61 and Ctgf proteins. IGF1 also caused differential changes in morphology, expression or nuclear/cytosol content of these genes between cells of mesenchymal, endothelial and epithelial origin. Our results demonstrate the functional implication of IGF1 in alveolar lung maturation by differentially controlling regulatory target genes on a cell-type specific basis. CCN family 2 (CCN2), also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), promotes endochondral ossification. However, the role of CCN2 in the replacement of hypertrophic cartilage with bone is still unclear. The phenotype of Ccn2-null mice, having an expanded hypertrophic zone, indicates that the resorption of the cartilage extracellular matrix is impaired therein. Therefore, we analyzed the role of CCN2 in osteoclastogenesis; because cartilage extracellular matrix is resorbed mainly by osteoclasts during endochondral ossification. Expression of CCN2 gene was up-regulated in mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 on day 6 after treatment of GST fusion mouse receptor activator of NF-jB ligand (GST-RANKL), and combination of recombinant CCN2 (rCCN2) and GST-RANKL significantly enhanced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cell formation compared with GST-RANKL alone. Therefore, we suspected the involvement of CCN2 in cell-cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis. To clarify the mechanism, we performed realtime PCR analysis of gene expression, co-immunoprecipitation analysis and solid-phase binding assay of CCN2 and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), which is involved in the cell-cell fusion. The results showed that CCN2 induced and interacted with DC-STAMP. Furthermore, GST-RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis was impaired in fetal liver cells from Ccn2-null mice, and the impaired osteoclast formation was rescued by the addition of exogenous rCCN2 or the forced expression of DC-STAMP by a retroviral vector. These results suggest that CCN2 expressed during osteoclastogenesis promotes osteoclast formation via induction of, and interaction with DC-STAMP. Because CCN2 is highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes, the CCN2-promoted osteoclast formation may be involved in promotion by CCN2 of resorption of the cartilage extracellular matrix at the final stage of endochondral ossification.",

They are known to play an important role in several biological processes and, together with transcription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory network. Looking at the structure of this network, it is possible to recognize a few overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary regulatory functions. Among them, a special role is played by the microRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor regulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. We show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version of this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an efficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall gene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream regulators. Among the other results, a non-trivial prediction of our model is that the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression of the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected fine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the actual effect of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their targets.",

The first step in the formation of epithelial organs, such as kidney or lung, is the self-organization of hollow and functionally polarized multicellular structures, like tubules and cysts. With the support of a discrete computational model that can simulate cystogenesis from its earliest stages, we demonstrate that differential adhesion and coordination of cell division and polarity axes are sufficient to reproduce both normal and mutant cyst phenotypes, similar to those observed in several epithelial cancers. By comparing simulations and experiments in wild-type MDCK cells cultures in a three dimensional environment, we show that cyst development takes place strongly out of biomechanical equilibrium. In this regime, we show that the coordination of mitotic spindle axes orientation with respect to the cell apical side is mandatory to achieve the formation of epithelial cysts displaying a central hollow lumen, and that the abrogation of this coordination leads in fact to the formation of the pathological multilumen phenotype. Our results show that accurate genetic control of the spatial orientation of the mitotic division axes is required to sculpt physiological epithelial morphologies.",

Targeted mass spectrometry and quantitative proteomics hold a promise to revolutionize basic research in molecular and cellular biology and advance our understanding of complex cellular processes. To investigate the response of energy metabolic pathways in breast cancer cells under different growth conditions, we developed a proteomic protocol and a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay for accurate quantification of near all proteins in major energy metabolic pathways (Krebs cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway). Panels of housekeeping proteins for normalization and positive control proteins for the corresponding growth conditions were also analyzed. Our SRM assay simultaneously measured the relative abundance of 78 proteins in total. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were exposed to a number of growth conditions such as normoxia, hypoxia, glucose-free-galactoseabundant media and estradiol stimulation. Control proteins were found over-expressed several folds in the corresponding growth conditions validating our biological model. The most prominent examples included overexpression of progesterone receptor and trefoil factor upon estradiol stimulation. Several proteins in glycolysis and Krebs cycle were found overexpressed under certain growth conditions. Time-dependent increase of expression was observed after 24 and 48 hours of growth. Our assay also allowed discovering intrinsic differences in energy metabolic pathways between near-normal (MCF-10A) and cancer (MCF-7) cells. We believe that our workflow is a valuable experimental tool to facilitate research in systems biology, metabolic engineering and metabolic transformation of cancer cells. While many microRNAs are transcribed from their own genes, nearly half map within introns of 'host' protein-coding genes. Eventually these intronic microRNAs may regulate the expression of their host genes, forming an intronic microRNA-mediated self loop. Recent bioinformatical analysis of this phenomenon, supported by an experimental finding related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggests that autoregulation mediated by intronic microRNAs may be under positive selective pressure. In this work we tried to shed light to the possible functions perfomed by the circuit, using both stochastic and deterministic analysis. Our model suggests that microRNA-mediated self regulation, despite its simple topology, can perform different regulative tasks. Firstly it can confer robustness to noise, secondly it can alter the response time of gene expression to upstream signals eventually locking the on-state of transcription and finally it can implement adaptation and fold-change etection. This one-to-many mapping between circuit topology and functions confers to the circuit a certain degree of flexibility apparently linked to the robustness of the circuit with respect to fluctuations. We compared the features of this circuit with the analogous transcriptional self-regulation, an ubiquitous network motif in different species, to highlight in what situations a post-transcriptional control can be advantageous for the cell. We validated all the analytical predictions via simulations then presenting a list of the ten most probable intronic microRNAs mediated self-loop found via bioinformatical analysis.

How is balanced utilization achieved, despite fluctuations in the concentrations of the enzymes that make up the regulatory circuitry? Here, we address this question by studying the nitrogen system of E. coli. A mechanism based on the avidity of a bifunctional enzyme, Adenylyl-transferase (AT/AR), to its multimeric substrate, glutamine synthetase, is proposed to maintain a robust ratio between two key metabolites, glutamine and a-ketoglutarate. This ratio is predicted to be insensitive to variations in proteins levels of the core circuit and to the rate of nitrogen utilization. We find using mass-spectrometry that the metabolite ratio is robust to variations in protein levels and that this robustness depends on the bifunctional enzyme. Moreover, robustness carries through to the bacteria growth rate. Interrupting avidity by adding a mono-functional AT/AR mutant to the native sys-tem abolishes robustness, as predicted by the proposed mechanism. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is the major determinant for the activation of the angiogenic program leading to the formation of new blood vessels. VEGF specific binding to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) is critical for triggering different signaling pathways including phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma) and Akt cascades, crucial for endothelial proliferation, permeability and survival. We carried out a quantitative in vitro analysis of these pathways by studying cultures of long-confluent and sparse endothelial cells that, at different VEGF doses, mimic the in vivo conditions of quiescent and angiogenic endothelium. We performed accurate quantitation of the phosphorylation levels of VEGFR-2, PLC-gamma and Akt, and integrated the results by means of a mathematical model. We found that: (i) cell density influences VEGFR-2 protein level, as receptor number is 2-fold higher in long-confluent than in sparse cells; (ii) cell density affects VEGFR-2 activation by reducing its affinity for VEGF in long-confluent cells; (iii) despite reduced ligand-receptor affinity, high VEGF concentrations provide long-confluent cells with a larger amount of active receptors; (iv) PLC-gamma and Akt are not directly sensitive to cell density, but simply transduce downstream the upstream difference in VEGFR-2 protein level and activation; (v) the mathematical model correctly predicts the existence of at least one protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) directly targeting PLC-gamma?and counteracting the receptormediated signal. The principal finding of this study is the formal demonstration of the influence of endothelial cell density on the activation of the early triggered signaling events along VEGF/ VEGFR-2 axis. Our results provide a basic framework suitable for further extensions that will shed light on the complexity of the VEGF signaling, and prompt for future investigation aimed at identifying the unrecognized PTPs for the development of potential therapeutic strategies.",

The role of a protein in a complex can be inferred from its functional context, provided by associated proteins whose functions are known (ii). The Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) represent the most common cause of inherited progressive encephalopathy of childhood, characterized by accrual of autofluorescent, ceroid-like lipopigment and degeneration of cortical neurons. NCLs are caused by mutations in 10 postulated genes (CLN1-10), eight of which have been cloned. Despite recent progress in the NCL field, the mechanistic and biological functions of most NCLs remain unclear (iii). In order to systematically investigate the functions of NCLs, we initiated a proteomic analysis of TAP-tagged NCLs and their associated protein complexes. First, we created a 'Gateway\u00d2compatible NCL entries library', including all available disease genes and their direct interacting partners, with tags either at the N-or C-termini of the human ORFs. Using modified LUMIER technology (iv) we subsequently verified several CLN3 Y2H binary data. Secondly, using modified vectors, we generated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably expressing the TAP-tagged NCL proteins and subjected them to tandem affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) (v). Isolated complexes were identified by nanoscale capillary LC-MSE (vi) on a nanoAcquity UPLC Synapt G2 HDMS (Waters). Identifications of NCL-interacting proteins were done with ProteinLynx Global SERVER\u00d4 (PLGS) software (Waters) against UniProt and International Protein Index (IPI) human databases. Functional annotation by bioinformatic analyses of proteins that co-purify with CLN3 or CLN5, respectively, revealed novel putative binding partners for both proteins. It is noteworthy that most of the putative novel interacting partners of CLN3 or CLN5 are proteins involved in calcium dependent signaling; Gprotein coupled receptor signal transduction and cell-cell adhesion. Although, the authenticity of these interacting partners requires rigorous validation by other techniques such as coimmunoprecipitation and LUMIER assays, our results present a first step towards drafting NCL protein interactome in the brain. Salmonella is a human pathogen that evolves many genetic determinants in process of horizontal gene transfer. This pathogenic bacterium has a large variety of virulence factors that are important in specific recognition of host organism, penetration, colonization and the ability to resist the host defense system. Genetic elements such as pathogenicity islands, gene cassettes, transposons, virulence plasmids or prophages are therefore regarded as a source of pathogenic diversity. Comparative genetic analysis of various salmonella strains is one of the approaches in the characterization of genomes. For this purpose we designed DNA microarray chip containing 167 probes to characterize variable genes of interest, 74 different variants of resistance genes, 16 virulence genes, 17 virulence genes with prophage origin, 7 integrase genes of specific bacteriophages. For plasmid characterization 18 probes typing incompatibility groups and plasmid of virulence were added. DNA chip contained also 28 probes for fimbrial genes detection. Some other probes to characterize salmonella species, as well as integrons I or II were included. After optimization of salmonella DNA chip, strains of different serovars isolated from food source were analyzed to reveal relationships. All serovars were also analyzed by MLST method. Comparison of results showed that DNA microarray was capable to determine the relatedness based on genetic profile with higher differentiation capability compare to MLST analysis. All data were divided into individual clusters with closely related serovars and since the analysis of virulence determinants was included, it is conceivable that different serovars are subject to similar recombination processes, for example such as existence of Gifsy1 bacteriophage in our samples was bound only to serovar Typhimurium, which was also confirmed by other studies. Similar results were obtained in cluster analysis of fimbrial genes or genes of virulence.",

Microscopic examination of the isolate showed that the cells are long rods and their morphologies are similar to C. thermocellum, an industrial cellulolytic thermophilic ethanol producing strain. At the end of the one week incubation, C. thermocellum and the isolate produced 0.3 g/l and 0.6 g/l ethanol from crystalline cellulose in synthetic minimal RM medium, respectively. It was observed that the isolate is more successful in conversion of cellulose to acetate and ethanol as compared to C. thermocellum ATCC 27405.

Tropical theileriosis is a serious disease caused by Theileria (T.) annulata which infects wild and domestic ruminants and it is transmitted by ticks from hyalomma genus. Currently available antiparasitic drugs are still in use to threat this disease but a resistance against one of the important antitheilerial drugs has been reported for the first time in this year. For the aim of developing new antitheilerial drugs or vaccines, enolase gene was cloned from T. annulata genomic DNA by PCR for the first time in literature. In this study, analysis of cloned enolase gene was performed at nucleotide level by using different web based tools. These analyses showed that the open reading frame of the gene was formed of 1365 nucleotides and interrupted by an intron sequence that is 36 bp in length. The intron sequence was placed between residues 40-41. GC content ratio of the gene was calculated as 44.3%, excluding the intron sequence. When this cloned sequence was compared to it's counterpart in T. parva, they were found to be 88% identical. The same comparison was also made between, T. annulata enolase and the muscle enolase (ENO3) isoform of the host, Bos taurus and they were found to be 65% identical. Most remarkably, there were two insertions in different regions of the T. annulata enolase compared to the host enzyme. The importance of these insertions will be exploited from the point of developing new antitheilerial drugs by structure based drug design studies.",

We propose a new 3D system to gain insight into mechanisms of platelet formation as well as a new platelet production system. A recently proposed bioreactor platform (Lovett et al., 2007) has been adapted to Mk function within the bone marrow. Bioreactor was perfused by stainless steel needles, spanned by porous silk microtubes with 500 lm inner diameter, wall thickness around 50 lm and pore sizes of 2-8 lm mimicking the sinusoidal blood vessels. The silk tubes were coated with a combination of matrigel with fibrinogen (FBG), von Willebrand factor (vWF) and SDF-1 alpha, substrates known to support proplatelet formation (PPF) in the vascular niche, and were embedded within a cell-seeded type I collagen gel which replicates the osteoblastic niche. Human cord blood derived Mks, seeded at the interface between the type I collagen gel and the coated vascular microtubes, were analyzed in terms of migration, PPF and platelet production. Mks were able to migrate in the gel enriched with FBG and vWF and, after additional 24 hours, Mks were able to adhere to the external wall of the vascular microtubes and protrude proplatelets through the pores of the vascular wall. Finally, the vascular microtubes, coated with FBG and vWF, were perfused at a rate of 32 ll/min and collected platelets were analyzed. The particles collected in the flow effluent of the vascular microtubes were CD61+ cells with the same scatter properties of human peripheral blood platelets. Moreover, increased exposure of P-selectin to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with thrombin was observed. In conclusion, we validated an innovative 3D bone marrow model where the fundamental steps of thrombopoiesis can be analyzed and functional platelets can be obtained. Alisporivir (Debio-025) is an analogue of cyclosporine A and represents the prototype of a new class of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that alisporivir inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and ongoing clinical trials are exploring its therapeutic potential in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Recent data suggest that the antiviral effect is mediated by inhibition of cyclophilin A which is an essential host factor in the HCV life cycle. However, alisporivir also inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition by binding to cyclophilin D. As HCV is known to affect mitochondrial function, we explored the effect of alisporivir on HCV proteinmediated mitochondrial dysfunction. By the use of inducible cell lines, which allow to investigate the effects of HCV polyprotein expression independent from viral RNA replication and which recapitulate the major alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics observed in infectious cell systems, we show that alisporivir prevents HCV protein-mediated cytochrome c redistribution, decrease of cell respiration, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, overproduction of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial calcium overload. Strikingly, some of the HCV-mediated mitochondrial dysfunctions could even be rescued by alisporivir. These observations provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver disease and reveal an additional mechanism of action of alisporivir that is likely beneficial in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Nanosized particles of gold (AuNPs) are widely used as advanced materials for protein catalysis investigation. So far, several methods have been optimised for AuNPs fabrication with a particular effort to improve their stability in solution. In this work, we describe the electrochemical study of human flavin-containing monooxygenase isoform 3 (hFMO3) in a nanoelectrode system, based on AuNPs stabilised with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) on glassy carbon electrode. Much interest has been focused on the hFMO3 catalysis, due to its well known detoxifying properties. Previously we described the engineering of a soluble form of hFMO3 that has been characterised by direct electrochemistry in terms of its catalytic activity towards several drugs including tamoxifen and benzidamine (Sadeghi et al. Here, we studied the electrochemistry of immobilised hFMO3 using cyclic voltammetry by comparing redox features of the protein by scanning the potential at different rates, from 10 to 120 mV/sec. Our results showed that, the presence of AuNPs improved the protein electrochemical performance in terms of peak currents and of detection stability. Interestingly, we also observed that redox parameters of the protein, such as reduction and oxidation potential, midpoint potential and peak to peak separation are affected by the presence of AuNPs in the nanostructured medium. In particular we observed a shift of the redox potentials towards more negative values due to AuNPs presence. Electrochemical characteristic of the DDAB/AuNPs immobilised hFMO3 was also confirmed by electrocatalysis followed by HPLC quantification. In conclusion, the immobilization of hFMO3 protein in DDAB stabilised AuNPs nanostructured electrodes improves the bioelectrochemical performance of the enzyme, and therefore can be employed for drug screening of this important human phase one metabolizing enzyme.",

In order to make QDs more water soluble and, in the meantime, to mitigate their potential cytotoxicity, we developed a simple yet versatile formulation for QDs by using the lipid coating technique. Phospholipids possess the surfactant properties in nature. After mixing dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) with dipalmitoylphosphocholine (DPPC) in the present of ligand-linked lipids, e.g., biotinylated DOPE, the functionalized QDs were formed. Further, the bifunctional adaptors such as protein A-streptavidin (PAST) fusion protein could be overcoated outside of these lipidcoated QDs to bind with antibodies for targeting various cells with specific surface markers on the cell membrane. This layerby-layer coating method can be adapted and optimized for quick assembly of molecular probes for a wide variety of biomedical applications. Ferritin is the iron storage protein for most living beings and it is present in many biological processes. It is organised on a 24meric hollow sphere, making it resistant to pH and temperature changes. Their properties and its capability to accept not only iron ions but also a wide variety of atoms, have made it the perfect biocompatible mould for the synthesis of size and shape controlled nanoparticles. We have synthesized three kinds of ferritin-encapsulated materials: iron oxide, cobalt oxide and cadmium sulfide semiconductor nanoparticles or quantum dots. The solubility of these nanoparticles in biological buffers has been demonstrated and their structural, magnetic and fluorescent properties have been analyzed using microscopy, spectroscopy and magnetometry techniques. Their magnetic properties have been analyzed depending on their P08 -Molecular engineering for medicine Abstracts size, both in bulk and on the surface on newly developed magnetic nanosensors. We have successfully prepared magnetoferritin covalent dimers, and magnetoferritin-semiconductor dimers that display interesting magneto-optical properties for drug delivery applications. A step forward is to link magnetoferritin or the hybrid dimers to apolipoprotein AI mutants that have proved very effective in the removal of lipids. The nanoparticles decorated with apoA1 will be conducted to atheromatous plaques by the action of an external magnet for its reductive treatment.

Mutants of the rat FAAH protein (rFAAH) were engineered with unique surface accessible cysteine residues for site-specific labelling with fluorescent probes. The cysteine mutations (C269S and C299S) were introduced in regions of the FAAH protein where structural changes occur upon ligand/inhibitor binding. Both mutants and the wild type protein were purified from the membrane fractions after expression in E. coli BL21. Yields of about 1 mg of pure protein per litre of culture were obtained for wild type and both mutants. The activity of the purified proteins was measured using aminomethyl coumarin arachidonoyl amide (AMC-AA) as the substrate. This substrate upon hydrolysis releases the fluorescent AMC whose emission was measured at 445 nm. A selected group of Cysteine-specific fluorescence probes were tested for labeling of the mutants. Labeling experiments were carried out with 10\u00b7 molar excess of the probe at 4C for 1-3 hours. Excess label was removed by gel filtration and the labeling ratio measured spectrophotometrically. Samples with labeling ratios of around 1 were then tested for inhibition of the FAAH activity. Data will be presented on the fluorescence intensity changes upon titration with the strong FAAH inhibitor, MAFP (methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate). These preliminary data provide the basis for a reagentless sensor of FAAH. Nucleic acid based aptamers are promising alternatives to antibodies in therapy and diagnostics. Several DNA G-quadruplex aptamers for the human thrombin have been developed already by combinatorial library selection with SELEX; though no direct structure based drug design has been performed yet. Therefore the main goal of this work was to establish a rational approach for constructing functional DNA aptamers by comparing several G-quadruplexes. All known G-quadruplex structures from PDB have been classified into several groups. For computer molecular dynamics simulations the optimized for the nucleic acids force field parmbsc0 was adapted for GRO-MACS architecture. G-quadruplex dynamics has been thoroughly studied with very long trajectories: total trajectory duration was tens of microseconds, which is the biggest known so far. Base on established dynamical properties the novel modular DNA aptamer, RA-36, has been designed. Comparative studies with two known aptamers, minimal G-quadruplex 15-TBA and extended 31-TBA (15-mer and 31-mer, respectively), were made. Thrombin activity assays, as well as mathematical model for calculation of kinetic parameters has been developed. Conventional 15-TBA inhibits thrombin at rather high concentrations, 1 -10 mkM, while RA-36 and 31-TBA are effective at much lower concentrations, 5 -20 nM. The type of inhibiting is also different that could shed light on a mode of anti-thrombin action of the aptamers. In coagulation tests RA-36 gave APTT doubling at 1 lM concentration; and aptamer shows dose-dependent effect for TT, PT, and APTT. Contrary to 31-TBA, RA-36 is highly specific for human thrombin in human versus rat tests, therefore a special protocol for aptamer animal testing has been developed. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zippers transcription factor involved in key processes of cellular control mechanisms. Mitf forms homodimers binding to E-box and M-box DNA and activate the transcription of various target genes known to be involved in e.g., pigmentation. Importantly, it also plays a major role in skin cancer progression of malignant melanoma. In this work, we selected two peptides from rationally designed libraries targeting the coiled coil domains of Mitf and Tfec, respectively, using an E. coli based 'hitchhiker' selection system. Both peptides show strong binding to their target sequence as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and ELISA. Midpoints of thermal unfolding were shifted by DTm values of 15\u00b0C or 25\u00b0C, respectively, as elucidated by thermal denaturation measurements. Further characterizations were undertaken to describe the structure and the pattern of the hetero-complexes. One peptide (iM6) emerging from the first library was mainly randomized at designated hydrophobic core positions and found to form a heterodimer with Mitf. Interestingly, the peptide selected from the second library (iM10) forms heterotrimers with a prefered ratio of two (Mitf) to one (iM10). This sequence from the second library pool was based on iM6 and additionally randomized at one core and several surrounding positions eventually leading to the oligomerization switch. This study shows that the selected helices bind with high specificity and affinity to their target Mitf and strongly discriminate against other coiled coil domains. Additionally, first in vitro cell culture assays were performed to show binding of the peptide to the full-length wild-type transcription factor. In this work, we demonstrated an evolutionary approach to generate peptides with high affinity and specificity to intracellular protein targets. Human growth hormone (hGH) was one of the first FDA approved recombinant proteins for the treatment of human growth disorders. Its size of only 191 amino acids, presence of only 2 disulphide bonds and absence of post-translational modifications make Escherichia coli a host of choice for both small and large scale production. Although formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli cells, consisting mostly of the recombinant protein, can simplify purification steps, it can also lead to the loss of activity and yield during refolding process. This has led to development of many expression systems using fusion partners to aid correct folding of the foreign protein. These fused proteins are cleaved after successful purification using proteases or chemical agents to yield product in its active form and with native structure. By the application of the rational design, the first steps toward increased effectiveness of the human growth hormone production in E. coli cells had been taken. An optimized synthetic hGH gene was fused to thioredoxin to improve solubility. This construct also contained a His-tag and enterokinase cleavage site, allowing relatively simple removal of fusion partners yielding native 191 aa hGH. The expression of recombinant protein was carried out in E. coli RV308ai strain, allowing precise modulation of the expression induction using different concentrations of arabinose.",

These compounds, called SkQBerb and SkQPalm, were shown to penetrate across planar bilayer phospholipid membrane in their cationic forms and to accumulate in isolated mitochondria and mitochondria in living human cells in culture. The reduced forms of SkQBerb and SkQPalm as well as C10Berb and C10Palm (analogs lacking the plastoquinol moiety) revealed radical scavenging activity in lipid micelles and in liposomes, while the oxidized forms were inactive. In isolated mitochondria and in the living cells, berberine and palmatine moieties were not reduced, so the antioxidant activity of C10Berb and C10Palm was not detected. SkQBerb and SkQ-Palm inhibited lipid peroxidation in isolated mitochondria at nanomolar concentrations, while a prooxidant effect was observed at 1000 times higher concentrations. In human cell cuture, SkQBerb and SkQPalm effectively prevented fragmentation of mitochondria and apoptosis induced by exogenous hydrogen peroxide. This is the first successful attempt to construct mitochondria-targeted antioxidants consisting entirely from natural components, namely the plastoquinone, nonyl, acetyl and berberine (palmatine) residues. Molecular recognition is central to biosensing. A biosensor includes a sensitive 'recognition' element associated with a physico-chemical transducer. Hemoglobin (Hb), a natural heme containing protein, exhibits enzymatic activity towards hydrogen peroxide, which is possible to improve by altering the heme ori-entation and/or changing the microenvironment in the vicinity of the heme sites. The aim of this work is to explore the possibility of improvement of Hb peroxidase activity for construction of Hb-based hydrogen peroxide sensor. It was shown that hypericin (HY), a naphthodianthrone from Hipericum perforatum and a potent natural photosensitizer, interacts with Hb and causes conformational changes of the protein. The aim of this work is the construction of a series of artificial porins with pre-defined features, to be applied in biotechnological applications. We could take advantage from the dataset of crystalized bacterial porins. These proteins form transmembrane beta barrels where each b-strand is connected to the next with alternating long loops (on the extracellular side) or short turns (on the periplasmic side). We have screened the porin sequences for conserved portions. We found a very conserved stretch encoding for two beta strands and their connecting beta turns. We thus decided to use this sequence to build multimers with rising, even number of the basic sequence (our module). The assembly of consecutive modules was first studied with bioinformatic simulations to predict the potential folding patterns. These simulations were indeed used as an additional criteria to decide the sequence of the module. Interestingly, the predicted structures formed with a number ranging from six to twelve repeats of the module showed a comparable thermodynamic stability. The molecular building of the repetitive module was based on standard molecular biology techniques. Mutagenesis of the cloned sequences was performed to polish the structure, insert tags for purification procedures and to allow the constructs to be in frame.",

Today's antibody engineering technologies enable routine production of human or humanized mAbs (150 kDa) which are naturally well adapted for therapeutic applications. However, a major disadvantage of using intact antibodies as imaging probes is that they circulate in the blood for some days. Several studies of antibody-based imaging agents showed that blood clearance was inversely related to the size of the protein. So, the production of genetically engineered antibody fragments of different sizes and valencies, as diabody fragment, is crucial for developping the in vivo imaging. Diabody is the smallest bivalent mole-cule retaining the specificity and affinity of a mAb (Olafsen, T., Based on the DNA sequence of the single-chain antibodies (single-chain fragment variable, scFv) we had obtained before and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase with enhanced catalytic activity (bacterial alkaline phosphatase mutated, B\u00c0 \u00f0mut), we aimed at construction of genes of the chimeric protein scFv-B\u00c0 \u00f0mut and obtaining these proteins by bacterial synthesis. The chimeric proteins scFv-B\u00c0 \u00f0mut were synthesized by secretory expression in E. coli, which ensures accumulation of the protein in periplasm and culture medium in a functionally active form. As a result of amino acid substitutions D330N and D153G, we observed a manyfold increase in phosphatase catalytic activity as part of the chimeric complex compared to the wild-type E. coli protein. We obtained high specificity of the interaction between scFv-B\u00c0 \u00f0mut and antigen, as well as showed the possibility of using bacterial periplasm and culture medium in immunodetection without preliminary purification. The convenience of designing the sequence encoding specific scFv's, simplicity of obtaining recombinant protein by bacterial synthesis, high sesitivity to antigen, as well as the wide spectrum of the available colorimetric, luminescent, and fluorescent substrates for the phosphatase opens new perspectives and utility of the obtained chimeric proteins in immunochemical analysis.",

Foreign antigen disposed on the surface of virions and subsequently repeated in many copies might be successfully expressed in plants. We cloned cDNA copy of the genome of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in binary vector under the control of plant transcriptional promoter. TMV coat protein (CP) gene was modified in order to carry the sequence of conservative extracellular domain of matrix protein M2 from human Influenza virus A (M2e). Agroinfiltration experiments on Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed that the modified viruses were capable of spreading via plant vascular system. The preparations of chimeric viral particles were purified; genetic stability of recombinant viruses was demonstrated. Immunoelectron microscopy detected foreign epitope on the surface of chimeric virions. Cysteine residues in heterologous peptide might impede efficient assembly of chimeric particles. Therefore, we created additional mutations in the natural sequence of Influenza epitope by replacing -cysteines at the positions 17 and 19 with either serine or alanine residues. This resulted in designing three vectors: TMV-M2e-cys, TMV-M2e-ser, TMV-M2e-ala. Following the purification, TMV-M2ecys particles contained rather low amount of protein with Influenza epitope, while TMV-M2e-ser and TMV-M2e-ala contained up to 80% of CP-M2e protein in preparation. Western blots and immunoelectron microscopy proved that the modified epitope within chimeric particles preserves immunogenic properties. Moreover, TMV-M2e-ala causes milder symptoms than TMV-M2e-ser but dramatically stimulates fusion protein accumulation. Mice immunization with TMV-M2e-ser and TMV-M2e-ala particles showed full protective effect against Influenza strain A/PR/8/ 34 (H1N1). Thereby we created simple and efficient system for presentation of conservative Influenza antigen using agrobacteria and plant viral vector in order to produce a candidate universal vaccine.",

IPCR combining the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with the amplification of the PCR. The crucial element defining the IPCR sensitivity is the model of DNA-antibodies conjugation. The application of supramolecular complexes generated from the bi-biotinylated DNA marker and streptavidin is the more effective approach. In this way the scores of DNA probes molecules fall at one detected antigen molecule due to that the specific signal is mostly increased. We tested the supramolecular complexes formed with the different types of DNA probes: dsDNAs 750, 300 and 150 bp as well as ssDNA 60 bases. The complexes were stable and using mainly two streptavidin valencies (defined by atomic force micros copy). The size of 3D complexes depends on the streptavidin-DNA molar ratio (SDMR). If the SDMR was 1 : 1 the more extensive complexes formed (the electrophoretic mobility correlating to the 1500-50000 bp DNA). The 4 : 1 SDMR lead to the forming of oligomeric complexes with the electrophoretic mobility divisible to that of the DNA probes (2-8fold). The complexes forming with the ssDNA probe (60 bases) and the different SDMR had the equal electrophoretic mobility corresponding to that of 600 bp DNA fragment. The best convergence and sensitivity were obtained with the 4 : 1 SDMR and dsDNA 750 bp or ssDNA 60 bases. The optimized IPCR systems were applied to develop the diagnosis systems of some diseases: the A and toxic shock syndrome enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and cholera toxin. The IPCR was carried out of two-sided (sandwich) variant with Real-Time PCR detection using TaqMan probe system. The following sensitivities were obtained: for the A toxin of S. aureus -0.1 pg/ml, for the toxic shock syndrome toxins of S. aureus -1.0 pg/ml, for the cholera toxin -10.0 pg/ml. Thus the sensitivity of IPCR in comparison with the ELISA were enhanced 5000, 500 and 30 fold, respectively.",

For the past ten years PEGylated interferon alpha 2a and 2b (IFN), in combination with Ribavirin, have been the only therapies available for the patients suffering from chronic Hepatitis B and C viral infections. The challenges of producing IFN a2b for medical purposes are the high cost and time-consuming protein production in mammalian or plant cells. For the patients, frequent use of the drug increases the cost of the therapy. Human IFN is a glycosylated protein with a calculated molecular weight of about 19.4 kDa. It has been shown previously that the non-glycosylated form expressed in bacteria still retains its antiviral activity. However, overexpression of this eukaryotic protein in bacteria results in its cytoplasmic deposition as insoluble inclusion bodies that need to be solubilised and correctly folded. In this work, the gene encoding the full-length IFN was codonoptimized for bacterial expression and cloned in the expression vector pET30a under the control of the IPTG-inducible pT7 promoter. Protein expression was carried out at 37\u00b0C in a 5 l fermenter for 20 hours post-induction. The expressed protein was purified from the solubilised inclusion bodies and refolded by dialysis and its antiviral activity tested on human cell lines infected with HCMV. Addition of polyethylene glycol molecule (PEG) to IFN extends the half-life of the drug by maintaining a more effective concentration and therefore prolonged activity. Attempts were made in pegylating the purified IFN with branched as well as linear PEG and data will be presented on the results obtained. Carbon nanotube grafted chitooligosaccharides (CNT-COS) were prepared by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The grafting of COS to the CNT was attained by producing acylchloride on the carboxylic group associated with the CNT. The prepared CNT-COS were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), 13C NMR, X-ray diffraction analysis and solubility studies. The results reveal that the amidation occurs at C2 position of NH2 group and acylated CNT. No decomposition was observed in pyranose ring in CNT-COS due to heating and acidic condition as confirmed by FT-IR. The X-Ray diffraction analysis showed that CNT-COS was amorphous in nature. Further, the alkaline phosphatase activity of CNT-COS was checked against osteoblastic cell lines at different concentrations. As a resultant alkaline phos-phatase activity of CNT-COS was higher as compared with the control group. These results suggest that CNT-COS is biocompatible material and could open up a number of promising pharmaceutical and clinical applications to mankind.

The minimization of Microcin B molecule has been carried out. The minimal fragment of pro-Microcin B able to be processed by Microcin B Synthetase in vivo comprises 60 amino acids. It has been shown that the deletion mutants of Microcin B, which lack the C-terminal amino acids, are capable of inhibiting DNA gyrase, but have dramatically reduced bactericidal activity. We assume, that the C-terminus of Microcin B includes amino acid residues which are necessary for its interaction with the inner and outer membrane porins of E. coli. Thus, the C-terminally truncated Microcin B mutants display weakened ability to pass through the membranes of sensitive cells. Using saturated mutagenesis of cloned mcbA gene, we have constructed complete collection of A and B-site Microcin B mutants. It turned out that A-site bisheterocycle is not critical for production and bactericidal activity of Microcin B.",

Our results demonstrated that the 3D native system maintained linear growth compared to 2D culture in which cells exponential growth up to 100% confluent monolayer. MTT test demonstrated that the growth of the 3D culture was supported by a constant number of dividing cells. FACS analyses shown that this process involved almost all fibroblasts in the culture. Dividing cells are not a distinct population and have no specific localization in the matrix. These results were confirmed by the down regulation of cyclin D. This was not associated with changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation but was a result of its sequestration into the lipid raft domains of cells from the 3D native matrix. We demonstrated that the effect of the lovastatin induced lowering of membrane cholesterol was associated with a shift of phosphorylated ERK1/2 from the raft domains and with an increase of cyclin D expression and proliferation in the native matrix. Our future aim is to develop this 3D culture as a model system for studies of cancer cell invasion and drug testing. The color palette of GFP-like fluorescent proteins (FPs) covers almost whole visible range of the spectrum. However there is lack of bright and photostable FPs in the far-and infra-red sections where living tissues are more transparent due to low absorbance and light-scattering levels. Earlier we elaborated bright far-red FP Katushka (1) (kex/ kem = 588/635 nm). Based on the analysis of the crystal structure of its monomerized version mKate (2) we generated two farred shifted FPs -eqFP650 and eqFP670 (kem = 650/670 nm, respectively) (3) . It was demonstrated that EqFP650 is the brightest far-red FP with fluorescence emission maximum above 635 nm whereas EqFP670 is characterized by lower fluorescence brightness but stronger batochromic shift of both excitation and emission maxima thus being the first FP with near infra-red fluorescence emission. Importantly EqFP670 can be exited by standard 633-or 635-nm laser line that makes it a remarkably useful tool in both whole-body imaging and flow cytometry techniques. To investigate the penetration of the fluorescent signal of eqFP650 and eqFP670 through animal tissues we performed subcutaneous (2 mm depth) and intramuscular (5 mm depth) injections of Katushka, eqFP650 or eqFP670 protein samples into living mice. The fluorescence was excited with 635 nm photodiodes and emission was measured over the integrated 700-800 nm range. It was demonstrated that eqFP670 exhibited the highest infra-red fluorescence in both injection experiments. The comparison in living tissues demonstrated advantageous characteristics of eqFP650 in the far-red and eqFP670 in the infra-red parts of the spectrum. Both FPs possess high potential to increase the sensitivity of whole-body imaging techniques and are useful for multicolor labelling experiments. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of nanobiological effects are in the focus of the modern medicine, from the toxicological and therapeutic point of view. Cytoprotective effects of polyhydroxylated derivative of fullerene, fullerenol (FNM), are mainly mediated by its ROS scavenging properties. By the means of quantitative realtime PCR (RT-qPCR), we have analysed the expression of genes involved in key cellular functions and processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, redox regulation, DNA damage and repair, and resistance to anti-tumor drugs. RNA for cDNA synthesis was isolated from Doxorubicin (DOX) treated K562 cells, from FNM treated cells and DOX + FNM treated cells. Our results of expression of genes involved in antioxidative cell defence showed that FNM significantly suppresses DOX-induced inhibition of MnSOD. Inducible NOS was significantly induced by DOX, whereas FNM treatment inhibited this effect. FNM suppresses DOX-induced inhibition of GSH redox cycling (GR) and synthesis (gGCS). NFkB expression was increased in K562 cells treated by FNM, most probably due to high sensitivity of NFkB to changes in the intracellular redox environment. mRNA levels of Ki-67 were used as a marker of cell proliferation. Our results show that FNM + Dox induce the same proliferation block as DOX itself. FNM alone induces significant cell proliferation effects, possibly due to up-regulation of anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative mechanisms. We observed the FNM induced down-regulation of Bax, mediated by FNM-induced overexpression of Bax-inhibitor. Baxinhibitor inhibits the accumulation of ROS, thereby protecting cells. Bax-inhibitor mediated as well the induction of HMOX, gGCS and GST. The inhibited expression of hOGG1 in DOX + FNM cells shows that fullerenol contributes to increased K562 sensitivity to DOX. We may conclude that FNM modulates redox status of DOX treated K562 cells, while it synergisticaly contributes to the block of erythroleukemia cells proliferation.",

Cytotoxicity assays carried out using both mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) and Simian-virus-40transformed ones (SVT2 cells) revealed that the chimera did not affect 3T3 cells viability, while was very effective against SVT2 cells, showing greater levels of toxicity than those observed for PD-L4 alone. Somehow, the presence of WSCI domain at the chimera C-terminus enhances cytotoxicity of the N-terminal domain. In order to investigate chimera's importing an immunofluorescence analysis on SVT2 cells was carried out, using PD-L4 and WSCI as controls. Preliminary results showed that chimera and PDL4 were present in the nuclei of living cells, while WSCI was in both nuclei and cytosol. Further studies will be aimed to clarify chimera's mechanism of action in cell death induction. Recently a novel single molecule detection system based on the rolling circle amplification (RCA) has been developed for the clinically relevant human topoisomerase IB (hTopIB) enzyme (1). RCA is an isothermal amplification technique that creates tandem repeated sequences of the same substrate that can be hybridized with a complementary fluorescent probe and visualized at the microscope. In this study a bead-based assay is proposed for highly sensitive single molecule hTopIB activity's detection. The sepharose beads have an average diameter of 25-40 lm and can capture hundred of thousand of circularized substrate. This procedure gives a sensitivity approximately 100 times higher than a previous one, in which the signals were spread over a slide, and open the possibility to analyze the hTopI's activity in cancer cell lines in presence or absence of hTopI inhibitors, permitting to directly assess the cancer cell resistance to the hTopI inhibitors. Work is in progress to increase the sensitivity and to permit the detection of the hTop1B function at the single cell level. ",

It is now generally con-sidered that MS is an autoimmune pathology characterized by presence of autoantibodies towards myelin basic protein (MBP). These antibodies were shown to possess a proteolytic activity against MBP [1] [2] [3] thus contributing to the pathological destruction of myelin sheath. A development of new approaches to the selective detection of anti-MBP antibodies and inhibition of their proteolytic activity could be of importance for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The goal of the present work was the selection of RNA aptamers for the specific targeting of anti-MBP autoantibodies. To this purpose, the polyclonal IgGs were isolated from sera of patients with multiple sclerosis, and the fraction with affinity to human MBP was used as a target in SELEX procedure. To improve nucleolytic stability of aptamers, all pyrimidines in the RNA SELEX library were replaced by their 2'-fluoro analogs. After 10 rounds of selection, an enriched library was obtained which bound with high affinity to MS-associated IgGs and also inhibited degradation of human MBP by polyclonal IgGs. The library was then cloned and sequenced. Individual 2'-F-pyrimidine RNA aptamers were synthesized and characterized in terms of their secondary structure, binding affinity and ability to inhibit the proteolytic activity of autoantibodies. Colchicine, an alkaloid obtained from Colchicum autumnale, is an effective and safe antifibrotic drug for long-term treatment of gout, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), amyloidosis and Be-hc\u00b8et's disease. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, EC 1.1.1.49) is first and regulating enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) which is responsible for the generation of NADPH and de novo production of cellular ribose. In this study we have investigated the effects of Colchicine on G6PD from various sources: sheep brain cortex, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and from baker's yeast (S.cerevisiae). We have purified G6PD from sheep brain cortex and we have purchased Leuconostoc mesenteroide and baker's yeast (S.cerevisiae) G6PD from Sigma Chemical Co., MO, USA. The purification consisted of two steps, 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange chromatography in procedure which took two working days. The enzyme was obtained with a yield of 68.33% and had a specific activity of 51.25 U/mg protein. We have chosen glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase because of the three important function of the enzyme; first one is the rate-limiting property of the PPP and the second one is reduction is maintains the cellular NADPH levels, the third and the last one is ribose-5-phosphate synthesis which is essential for the de novo nucleic acid synthesis. We have established that colchicine inhibits G6PD in a concentration dependent manner. We have investigated the kinetic characterization, inhibition types and constants (Ki). The pyridine nucleotide cycle is a network of biochemical transformations that allow cells to recycle back to NAD the byproducts of the endogenous coenzyme consumption and to salvage exogenous NAD precursors. While most of the enzymes involved in such routes have been characterized, some of them are not yet assigned to any gene and still belong to the family of 'orphan enzymes', i.e. enzymes included in the EC database for which no corresponding gene has been so far reported. Among them is a well-documented NMN deamidase activity, which in enterobacteria is involved in the predominant route recycling NMN to NAD. This enzyme is also suggested to be a regulator of intracellular NMN levels, which need to be tightly controlled since NMN is a potent inhibitor of NAD-dependentent DNA ligase. In this view, NMN deamidase would prevent DNA ligase inhibition and contribute to NAD supply. Moreover, the product of the NMN deamidase-catalyzed reaction, i.e. NaMN, is used as the preferred phosphoribosyl donor by the enzyme CobT, that catalyzes a late step in adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis, thus suggesting a role of NMN deamidase in the control of vitamin B12 levels. Despite several attempts, this enzyme has remained 'orphan' for over 25 years. Here we report on the identification of the NMN deamidase encoding gene, following purification and partial sequencing of the enzyme from Shewanella oneidensis. Biochemical and structural characterization reveals that NMN deamidase is both structurally and phylogenetically distinct from known amidohydrolase enzymes. Comparative genomic analysis indicates a conservation over a large phylogenetic distance. In vivo genetic studies are in progress to assess the enzyme physiological role and contribution to NAD biogenesis. Zinc is required for a wide variety of cellular functions and plays a key role in bacterial metabolism. We have previously shown that Salmonella enterica strains lacking the high affinity zinc uptake transporter ZnuABC are impaired in their ability to grow in environments poor of this metal and that, in spite of the apparent abundance of this metal in all eukaryotic tissues, show a dramatic reduction in pathogenicity. These studies have established that the free zinc quota available for bacterial growth within the animal is limited and that the mechanisms ensuring zinc uptake are critical to establish a successful infection. Besides ZnuABC, bacteria possess another putative zinc transporter, ZupT, that is believed to mediate import of zinc and other diva-lent metals under conditions of moderate metal demand. The participation of ZupT in zinc uptake in Salmonella has never been investigated. Despite zupT is upregulated in response to zinc deprivation, in vitro experiments did not show a clear impairment in growth of a zupT mutant with respect to the wild type strain. However, we have found that the simultaneous absence of ZupT and ZnuABC causes a reduction of virulence in mice hypersensitive to Salmonella (NRAMP-) greater than that observed in mutants lacking only the high affinity system. At the same time the double mutant zupTznuABC shows an increase in susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide when compared to the znuABC mutant strain. This difference disappears in bacteria cultivated in presence of zinc. Furthermore, when infections are performed in mice resistant to Salmonella (NRAMP+), the mutant lacking zupT shows a significant competitive disadvantage compared to wild type strain. This study demonstrates that ZupT participates in the process of zinc uptake in vitro and during infections, but also shows that the main transporter involved in zinc uptake in the infected animal is ZnuABC.

It is a high affinity ATP-binding cassette-type transporter that comprises three proteins like most prokaryotic importers of this class. The most extensively studied component is the soluble periplasmic protein, ZnuA, that captures Zn(II) and delivers it to the membrane permease ZnuB, also because inactivation of the encoding gene znuA in several pathogenic bacteria results in significantly reduced virulence in different animal models. These observations are at the basis of the rational design, identification and validation of novel antimicrobial agents that inhibit ZnuA and are able to interfere with Zn(II) import in facultative intracellular Gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica. ZnuA inhibitors can be envisaged as small molecules able to impair Zn(II) uptake/release from the ZnuA-Zn(II) complex or possibly the ZnuA-ZnuB interaction. In principle, novel ZnuA inhibitors can be identified by rational drug design performed using a structure/ligand approach, as in the case of other metalbinding proteins. To this end, the in-house library of compounds containing Zn(II) binding groups was screened against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028. Interestingly, out of the 45 small molecules tested at 250-500 microM concentrations, 5 hydroxamate compounds inhibited bacterial growth appreciably and one com-pound yielded X-ray quality crystals in complex with ZnuA. At variance with the ineffective compounds, the effective ones induced changes in the bacterium. Thus, transmission electron microscopy imaging revealed granulation deposits, large vacuoles and a putative interaction with the genetic material.",

All bacteria were isolated from Italian cheeses. Lactococci and enterococci were grown in M17 broth at 37\u00b0C while Lactobacillus plantarum was grown in MRS broth at 30\u00b0C. All cultures were performed both in microaerophylia and in presence of O 2 to test whether stress (presence of oxigen) stimulates bacteriocins production. The whole culture and the cell-free supernatant of both strains were tested against pathogens using well-diffusion assay and their antimicrobial activity was shown by the formation of an inhibition zone around the well on the plate. In order to evaluate the time of maximum production of bacteriocins, cultures at different growth phases were tested. Two different peptide purification protocols were tested in order to recover a larger amount of bateriocins. A biochemical characterization was performed: molecular size determination by Tricine-SDS-PAGE, thermostability at 70\u00b0C, 80\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C and proteinase k sensitivity. Molecular targeting experiments of bacteriocins encoding genes by PCR were performed in order to confirm the bacteriocins identification. This study demonstrated that all lactococcal strains produced nisin A, the two enterecoccus strain produced enterocin A, while the L. plantarum was able to inhibit pathogen by means of large amounts of lactic acid. The most interesting strains (L. lactis L5 e L7) possess both extracellular and surface-bound bacteriocins and their maximum production occurs during the middle logarithmic phase.",

DNR is active under low oxygen tension in the presence of N-oxides: in particular, it has been suggested that it may act as a NO sensor in vivo (4). DNR forms a stable complex with heme (5); this cofactor is required in the bacterium to perceive the physiological messenger, i.e. nitric oxide (6) . Here we present a spectroscopic, kinetic and protein engineering study which allowed us to propose the aminoacid residues involved in heme iron coordination in DNR. The results of this study underlines that DNR is characterized by a remarkable flexibility in solution, in agreement with the data available on other members of the CRP-FNR class of transcriptional regulators. We propose that protein flexibility and dynamics is a key structural feature essential to explain the evolutionary success and adaptability of these bacterial transcription factors (7).",

We used electrochemical and spectrofluorimetric methods to assay the pump activity in these bacteria. Accumulation of ethidium (Et+) and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) ions by the cells was registered potentiometrically using selective electrodes. Simultaneously accumulation of Et+ was assayed using fluorescence spectroscopy: the increase in fluorescence was observed because of the dye binding to DNA. Results of our experiments revealed that Et+ ions easier than TPP+ penetrate the OM of S. enterica cells. Effects of RND-family MDR pump inhibitor phenylalanyl-arginyl-b-naphtylamide (PAbN) and the outer membrane (OM) permeabilizers EDTA and Polymyxin B were studied. At high concentrations PAbN not only blocks the activity of MDR pumps but also triggers depolarization of the plasma membrane (PM). Starved and permeabilized cells are more susceptible to the depolarizing activity of PAbN. We demonstrated that the temperature, the intensity of aeration and the composition of medium differently affect the RND-family pump activity in S. enterica and P. aeruginosa. S. enterica pumps effectively extrude indicator compounds in the absence of nutritives, but the presence of glucose increases the efficiency of cell envelope barrier to lipophilic compounds. Our results indicated that in formation of the envelope barrier to lipophilic cations contribution of AcrAB-TolC pump is higher than that of LPS layer of the OM. In con-trast to P. aeruginosa cells, the alternative efflux pumps in S. enterica fail to compensate loss of the major pump AcrAB-TolC. Experiments with tolC ir acrB gene mutants indicated that defects in both the OM and the PM components of AcrAB-TolC pump almost equally contribute to the loss of cell envelope barrier to lipophilic cations.",

            "text": "The tendency to decrease the use of chemical additives in food has stimulated investigation into bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria due to their application in food preservation to control undesirable organisms in recent years. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides that usually inhibit strains closely related to the producing bacteria. Bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are small, heat stable, cationic and hydrophobic peptides. Bacteriocin production is widespread among lactic acid bacteria. Due to serious outbreaks caused by food borne pathogenic bacteria, investigation of lactic acid bacteria has been concentrated on bacteriocins targeting these bacteria, particularly Listeria. Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strain W3 produces a bacteriocin termed mesentericin W3, which displayed antagonistic activity against selected strains of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is thermostabile over a wide pH and has a potential for use in both high-acid and low-acid canned foods given its extreme pH and thermostability. By adding mesentericin W3 to low-acid foods, it should be possible to reduce the extent of heat-processing required, thus resulting in improved flavour, increased nutritional value and an overall more economical process. Its mode of action was bactericidal with a subsequent bacteriolysis. Mesentericin W3 was also stable to a wide range of organic solvents and can be extracted with chloroform, methanol, acetone, toluene and hexane. Mesentericin W3 was purified by a three-step protocol consisting of pH mediated cell adsorption-desorption, cationexchange chromatography and reverse-phase chromatography. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the pure mesentericin W3 revealed a molecular mass of 5443 Da and de novo sequencing resulted in a partial amino acid sequence: Abstract:An example of a functional food, which has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, is probiotics-'live microbial feed supplements'. Strains of Weissella confusa have been also demonstrated to act as probiotic. Weissella con-fusa that is a lactic acid bacterium is gram-positive, catalase-negative, short rod or coccobacillus that has been isolated from a wide variety of habitats. Lactic acid bacteria are beneficial probiotic organisms that contribute to improved nutrition, microbial balance, and immuno-enhancement of the intestinal tract, as well as anti-cancer activity. The vast majority of studies on the anticancer effects deal with colorectal cancer, although there are some studies on breast and bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of increasing concentrations of lyophilized form of W.confusa cytoplasm on human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2 cells). In this study, 5\u00b7104 Caco-2 cells/ml were incubated in 96-well microtiter cell culture plates. 24 hours after different concentrations of lyophilized form of bacterial supernatants (1.000-100-10-1-0.1 lg/ml) were added to the culture medium. Caco-2 cells were further incubated for 24 hours. After incubation, the cell viability was determined using the MTT-test. The results showed that the significant dosedependent cytotoxic effects of W.confusa cytoplasm were not observed on Caco-2 cells for 5\u00b7104 cells/ml after 24 hours incubation. These new findings on the characteristics of W.confusa may be valuable in the evaluation of this probiotic. We continue investigating effects of different concentrations of this bacterium supernatant on Caco-2 cells at different incubation times. Therefore, W.confusa may be useful for the inhibition of colon cancer cells as an ingredient of medicinal foods or new drugs. Keywords: probiotics, Weissella confusa, caco-2, cytotoxicity, mtt assay Phenolic compounds which are produced by variety of industrial and urban activities possess dangers to human and animal lives. Mutagenesis and carcinogenic effects are reported for several derivatives of phenols. In the present study, an inducible degradation system of such pollutants was designed and constructed in Escherichia coli as the host. CapR which is a member of NtrC family of transcription activators in Pseudomonas species shows sensitivity towards phenol, methyl phenols, chlorophenols, nitrophenols and catechol. CapR was prepared synthetically with codon preference of the host and cloned under the control of a constitutive promoter. Upon presence of inducible pollutants, CapR will be activated by conformational changes and turns an inducible r54 promoter (-24 TGGC, -12 TTGC) to its on state. A bacterial laccase gene, which is isolated from an Iranian Bacillus species, was placed under control of the inducible promoter. Laccase is a multicopper oxidase enzyme with the ability to oxidize wide variety of mono and polyphenols. Therefore, just in the presence of phenolic pollutants, the transcription activator will trigger the laccase expression and the initiative pollutants will be detoxified. The sensitivity of the inducible system was checked in the presence of phenol with the concentration range of 1nM-10M. Laccase expression was assayed even in lowest concentrations after 2 hours exposure to phenol as the inducer. Additional investigations on the efficiency of laccase in detoxifying the pollutant are being done. LL-37 is a human a-helical, cationic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) with a direct antibacterial activity and multifunctional immunomodulatory capacities. Like many AMPs, it kills bacteria primarily by altering membrane integrity, although the exact mechanism of action is undefined. To increase our knowledge on the bacterial components involved in its mode of action, we screened an E. coli knock-out mutant library in search for mutations conferring altered susceptibility to LL-37. The library was created by random Tn5 transposon insertion into the bacterial genome and mutants with decreased susceptibility to LL-37 were selected by plating E. coli cells on peptide-supplemented solid medium. The different susceptibility of the wild-type and mutant cells was characterised by determining the effect of increasing peptide concentrations on either the kinetics of bacterial growth or the kinetics of bacterial killing, and its binding to bacterial and effect on their integrity studied by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.",

            "text": "In 15 out of 20 LL-37-resistant mutants, Tn5 insertion was observed to occur in the waaY gene, encoding for a specific kinase responsible of the phosphorylation of the Hep II residue in the core region of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This modification decreased the peptide's ability to kill bacterial cells, correlating with a reduced binding to and permeabilisation of bacteria. Susceptibility to several other AMPs of different structural classes was however unaffected, indicating that this binding may relate to LL-37's particular structure. WaaY inactivation determines a decreased anionicity of the outer membrane due to a missing phosphorylation of a specific sugar residue, causing a significant but selective reduction in peptide binding to the cell surface and a decreased antibacterial activity. The results reveal a putative LPS-binding site for LL-37 and stress the importance of the electrostatic properties of the cell surface for binding. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is considered as an important virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori, and contributes to infection persistence and disease severity. ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6epimerase is an enzyme essential for LPS synthesis and understanding of its biochemistry is critical for drug development. We cloned one putative ortholog of Escherichia coli rfaD, HP0859, from H. pylori 26695. Determination of the native molecular weight of the recombinant HP0859 protein suggests that the protein is likely a hexamer. NADP+, instead of NAD+, was proved to be the physiological cofactor for HP0859 protein. Circular dichroism spectrum analysis demonstrated that the secondary structure of this protein is significantly altered when the cofactor is removed. We also constructed an HP0859 knockout mutant and examined its phenotypic properties. The HP0859 knockout mutant exhibited a severe truncation of LPS, a decreased growth rate, and a higher susceptibility to novobiocin. Disruption of HP0859 also reduced the adhesive capacity of H. pylori to AGS cells, and the infected cells failed to display the classic hummingbird phenotype. Complementation of the HP0859 knockout mutation restored these phenotypes completely. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HP0859 codes for a protein essential for the LPS inner core biosynthesis in H. pylori and an intact LPS structure contributes to the adherence ability of this bacterium.

Deletion of three amino acids at positions 82-84 of L22, a mutation which causes reduced erythromycin susceptibility by broadening the exit tunnel, did not essentially affect the first step of telithromycin binding. However, it strongly reduced the rate of telithromycin shift to the highaffinity site and increased the dissociation rate constant of the final ribosome-drug complex. In contrast, substitution of lysine by glutamic acid at position 63 of L4, a mutation conferring resistance against erythromycin, failed in affecting either the first or the second step of telithromycin binding. Our results accord with recent crystal structures of E. coli ribosomes in complex with telithromycin, revealing that between the two guard ribosomal proteins only the extended loop of L22 in which the D82-84 mutation lies, provides a surface facing the alkyl-aryl group of telithromycin, a side chain known to strengthen the drug binding. Acknowledgment: We thank Sanofi-Aventis Inc. for providing telithromycin. In an effort to combat antibiotic resistance, a newer class of macrolides, known as ketolides, was developed. Ketolides show improved activity against strains with inducible erm genes and are believed to exhibit a tighter binding to the ribosome compared with the previous classes of macrolides. Here we present data concerning some novel promising drugs of this class named fluoroketolides. Their structure is similar to that of cethromycin, another important ketolide that is already in the last stages of clinical trials, but with one or two fluorine atoms bound to the C2 or C13 atoms in the lactone ring. In microbiological tests involving a number of wild type and mutant clinical pathogenic bacterial strains, the fluoroketolides were characterized by lower MIC values than those of erythromycin and telithromycin. In vitro studies using a coupled transcription/translation system confirmed the previous data as well as competition experiments with [14C] erythromycin. Chemical protection experiments in domain V of 23S rRNA revealed that all the fluoroketolides strongly protected nucleotides A2058, A2059 from dimethyl sulfate modification. This footprint pattern suggests that these new fluoroketolide antibiotics also occupy the classical macrolide site at the entrance of the exit tunnel, but that the exact position of the alkyl-aryl sidechain as well as potential additional interactions relating to the fluorine atoms, remain to be determined. Understanding how the sidechain and fluoride atoms of these novel ketolides interact with the ribosome will aid in the future research and development of this important class of antibiotics. Bombinins H are mildly cationic antimicrobial peptides isolated from the skin of the anuran genus Bombina. Some members of this peptide family coexist in skin secretions as diastereomers in which a single L-amino acid is post-translational modified to produce the respective D-amino acid. We have evaluated the antimicrobial activity of H2 and H4 (the latter containing a D-alloisoleucine at the second N-terminal position) against a large panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria; performed membrane permeation assays on both intact cells and model membranes mimicking the composition of the plasmamembrane of Gram-negative/positive bacteria; used biochemical tools to monitor the peptides' ability to translocate through the membrane of liposomes mimicking Escherichia coli inner membrane. The results highlight that the presence of a single D-amino acid in the sequence of an antimicrobial peptide is decisive to determine its target microbial cell selectivity and its membrane perturbing activity.",

            "text": "Mechanistic insights into outer membrane permeability and synergistic activity of temporins The increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant microbes has prompted the search for new antibiotics with a new mode of action. Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), that are produced by almost all forms of life, represent attractive candidates for the development of a new generation of antiinfective agents [1] . There is compelling evidence that unlike conventional antibiotics, most AMPs do act by altering the permeability of the target cell membrane. However, before reaching it, they need to cross the microbial cell wall that, in Gram-negative bacteria, is surrounded by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)outer membrane, which forms an efficient barrier against a variety of molecules. In Amphibia, temporins are among the shortest (10-14 residues) AMPs, with up to ten isoforms within the same specimen [2] . We have shown that some of them (temporin-1Tb, TB, and temporin-1Tl, TL) have a synergistic effect in killing Gram-negative bacteria [3] . This suggests an important strategy to overcome bacterial resistance due to the LPS layer. More precisely, we have found that LPS induces oligomerization of TB. This would prevent its translocation across the outer membrane making the peptide inactive on Gram-negative bacteria. Differently, TL is highly active on these bacteria, presumably due to the lack of such oligomerization. To gain insight into interactions of TL and TB within LPS, we investigated the peptides' structures and interactions in LPS micelles using NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, TL assumes a novel anti-parallel dimeric helical structure stabilized by intimate packing between aromatic-aromatic and aromatic-aliphatic residues. By contrast, TB demonstrates populations of helical and aggregated conformations in LPS. Note that the LPS-induced aggregated states of TB are largely destabilized in the presence of TL. STD (saturation transfer difference)-NMR studies have delineated residues of TL and TB in close contacts with LPS and enhanced interactions of these two peptides with LPS, when combined together. Importantly, these results provide the first structural insights into the mechanism of action and synergism of AMPs at the level of the LPS-outer membrane. Based on similarity searches, two putative pathways were previously described as being encoded by the pAO1 megaplasmid of Arthrobacter nicotinovorans: an almost fully established nicotine-degrading pathway and a yet unknown putative sugar-catabolic pathway. The general organization of the latter indicated the presence of a transcriptional control factor, an multicomponent ABC-type sugar transport system and a cascade of dehydrogenases and oxidoreductases. The current work is focused on experimental identification of the catabolic pathway substrate. An initial screening was performed using the A. nicotinovorans pAO1+ wt strain and a cured derivative strain (pAO1-, Igloi and Brandsch, 2003) not harboring the pAO1 plasmid. As the megaplasmid is not present in the cell, the latter strain is unable to form nicotine-blue and also, as shown here, is unable to degrade five sugars and derivatives (D-Ribose, D-Xylose, L-Rhamnose, D-Sorbitol, GlcNAc) out of 50 carbohydrates tested using an API50CH kit. Part of this yet unknown sugar catabolic pathway is orf40, a putative dehydrogenase containing the partially conserved consensus sequence: 119-AGKHIFTEKP-128, similar to AG-KHVxCEKP motif found in sugar-dehydrogenases. The gene was cloned, the protein expressed and purified as an 45 kDa slightly brown His-tagged protein and used to raise antibodies in rat. Western-Blotts using anti-ORF40 as primary antibodies were further used in a series of experiments aimed at establishing the expression conditions of the ORF40 protein in A. nicotinovorans pAO1+wt. Although our previous in-silico blind docking experiments indicated tagatose as the putative ligand for several proteins in the pathway (Mihasan, 2010), the current work showed that tagatose is degraded by both the pAO1+ and pAO1-strains. Nevertheless, the docking scores always placed xylose among the top five ligands, indicating that that the second pathway coded by the pAO1 megaplasmid is a xylose catabolic pathway.",

Cellulose biomass is the most abundant waste produced by human activities including agricultural by-products (e.g. wheat straw and corn stalks), municipal solid wastes (e.g. waste paper) and industrial waste streams (e.g. paper mill sludge): it is definitely the most interesting substrate for the 'biorefinery strategy' producing high-value products (chemicals, fuels, enzymes, etc.) by microbial fermentation processes. Lactic acid (LA) is among the most requested chemicals that can be produced by this approach, owing to the promising applications of its polymer, the polylactide (PLA), as a biodegradable and biocompatible general purpose plastic (e.g. for manufacturing of biomedical devices and for food and good packaging) alternative to petrochemical-derived materials. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are among the chief sources of LA: unfortunately, natural LAB strains are not able to degrade cellulose. The present project aims to construct a cellulolytic LAB by metabolic engineering so as to obtain a strain able to be employed in a cost efficient consolidated bio-processing converting cellulosic wastes into optically pure LA. Cloning and expression of the genes encoding the components of the cellulase system of Clostridium cellulovorans into Lactococcus lactis is currently underway. Notably, an artificial bicistronic operon encoding the cellooligosaccharidase BglA and the endoglucanase D has been constructed and cloned into the pMG36ea E. coli -L. lactis shuttle vector (pABER). L. lactis cells transformed with the pABER vector were able to hydrolyse carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) indicating that the two heterologous genes were expressed and their corresponding proteins were functional in L. lactis. Current investigations aim to assess the cellular localization of these enzymes in L. lactis and to previsely quantify their amount and catalytic activity. Futhermore, the recombinant L. lactis is being tested as concerns its yields of CMC, crystalline cellulose and other cellulosic substrate metabolization into lactic acid. Manufacture of probiotics and food stuffs of functional purpose concerns to hi-tech branches that explains its concentration in industrially developed countries. Extensive investigations of biological active compounds from probiotic bacteria are directed primarily for the preparation of highly effective therapeutic products. Among these substances are bacterial polysaccharides and polar lipids. Therefore, it is important to identify the biologically active compounds and to determine their structures. Composition and structure of polysaccharides and glycolipids of biotechnologically promising probiotic bacteria were characterized. The major polysaccharide specific for strain Bifidobacterium bifidum BIM B-465D was found to be a branched glucogalactan with a heptasaccharide repeating unit. The second, minor polysaccharide is a branched glucan having a main chain of 1,6 linked a glucopyranose residues and side chains of single a-glucopyranose residues attached at position 2 of 60% glucose residues in the main chain. Bifidobacterium longum BIM B-476D produced several polysaccharides, including a glucosylated ribitol teichoic acid and a polymer with a branched pentasaccharide 1-phosphate repeating unit. The glycolipid isolated from Lactococcus lactis supsp. cremoris B-493-D contains two 1 fi 2-linked residues of a-D-glucose. The pool of glycolipids isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum B-495-D consists of two major fractions.

Unfortunately the synthetic form of this molecule had no antibacterial activity and it was probably not correctly structured. To overcome this problem we are setting up the cloning of polA gene in Pichia pastoris. The second peptide (PolB), with a mass of 3700.54 Da, has been almost completely sequenced and belongs to the group of defensins, because of the presence of six cysteine residues. It shows some similarities with a putative defensin of the dipter Culicoides sonorensis. Experiments are in progress to determine the MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) of these peptides on B.subtilis grown on LB broth. The complete characterization of the peptides will bring to an increase of antimicrobial molecules to be tested as new therapeutic agents.",

Comparison of NtcA alone with NtcA in complex with PipX reveals that PipX stabilizes the active conformation of this transcription factor and that it may also contact RNA polymerase, helping recruit this enzyme. Whereas active NtcA closely resembles active CRP (the cAMP bacterial receptor protein, also known as CAP) at least two inactive forms of NtcA exist (judged by comparing structures of S. elongatus and Anabaena sp.PCC 7120 NtcA, and these differ importantly from the several known CRP inactive forms. Therefore, transcription factors of the CRP family appear to have always the same active conformation, reflecting the needs to recognize the target DNA and RNA polymerase, but their inactive conformations are diverse, reflecting relaxation by lack of functional constraints. Bac7 is a proline-rich peptide with a potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [1, 2] . Here we investigated its in vivo activity using a mouse model of S. enterica serovar typhimurium infection. The efficacy of the active 1-35 fragment of Bac7 was assayed in the presence of human and murine serum and plasma, and its stability in these biological fluids analyzed by mass spectrometry. The ability of the peptide to protect mice against Salmonella enterica was assayed in a typhoid fever model of infection by evaluation of survival rates and bacterial load of infected animals. Bac7(1-35) retained a substantial activity in blood components and showed a very low toxicity in vivo. Injected in Salmonella-infected mice it significantly increased the number of survivors and the mean survival time of treated animals, reducing the bacterial load in liver and spleen. Despite these effects the peptide showed a limited biodistribution and a rapid renal clearance.",

Analysis of available genomes from Desulfovibrio species shows that MorP encoding gene is located downstream of a sensor (MorS) and a regulator gene (MorR), characterizing a two component system (1) . A putative r54 promoter region was identified between morS and morP genes. By sequencing analysis, it is predicted that MorS is composed by a periplasmic region, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic PAS and kinase domains. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in Mo regulation in DdG20, biochemical characterization of this two component system was performed. The proteins MorR and the periplasmic domain of MorS were heterologously expressed in E. coli cells and purified from soluble fraction. The molecular mass of MorR determined by MALD-TOF is 51412.14 \u00b1 97.54 Da. Gel filtration showed that MorR has a molecular mass of 97 kDa, indicating that this protein is expressed as a dimer. The intergenic region between morS and morP was PCR amplified, and the DNA-MorR interaction was assessed by EMSA. DNA footprinting analysis was performed. The results obtained have shown that MorR specifically binds to this intergenic region. Bacteria exist in nature in a planktonic single-cell state or in a sessile multicellular state, the biofilm. Biofilms are diffused in many settings and are less sensitive to antibiotics compared to planktonic cells: new therapeutic options are needed to treat bacterial biofilms, the main cause of chronic infections. Bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation are controlled by a ubiquitous second messenger, namely c-di-GMP1. The intracellular levels of c-di-GMP are regulated by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and phosphodiesterases (PDE), catalyzing its synthesis and degradation, respectively. The aim of this project is to study the biochemistry and structural biology of selected DGCs and PDEs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main pathogen causing chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The final goal is to identify novel targets to inhibit biofilm formation. The activity of one PDE (PA4781), showing phosphodiesterase activity in vivo2, and of its isolated catalytic domain was assayed in vitro using several approaches, including HPLC reverse phase C18 column and UV-Vis spectroscopy. No c-di-GMP hydrolysis could be detected under all conditions tested. These results suggest either that this protein needs a physiological partner to be fully active or that PA4781 controls c-di-GMP levels indirectly acting as a c-di-GMP sensor. We have obtained suitable crystals of PA4781 full length and we are attempting crystallization of the catalytic domain. In parallel, putative inhibitors of DGCs, previously identified in vivo3, were tested on the prototype DGC, PleD from Caulobacter crescentus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC 501 \u00d2 and Lactobacillus paracasei IMC 502 \u00d2 on oxidative stress in athletes during a four-week period of intense physical activity. Two groups of twelve subjects each were selected for this analysis. The first group consumed a daily dose of a mixture of the two probiotic strains (1 : 1 l. rhamnosus IMC 501 \u00d2 and L. paracasei IMC 502 \u00d2 ; Approx. 109 cells/day) for four weeks. The second group (control) did not consume any supplements during the four weeks. Blood samples collected immediately before and after the supplementation were analyzed, and plasma levels of reactive oxygen metabolites and biological antioxidant potential were determined. Faeces were also collected and analyzed before and at the end of the probiotic supplementation to measure the influence of probiotic intake in intestinal lactoflora and the faecal recovery of the probiotic strains. Antioxidative activity and oxidative stress resistance of the two strains were also determined in vitro. Results demonstrated that intense physical activity induced oxidative stress and that probiotic supplementation increased plasma antioxidant levels, thus neutralizing reactive oxygen species. L. rhamnosus IMC 501 \u00d2 and L. paracasei IMC 502 \u00d2 were well tolerated and a significant increase in total faecal lactobacilli was detected in probiotic group. Faecal recovery of L. rhamnosus IMC 501 \u00d2 and L. paracasei IMC 502 \u00d2 was documented by molecular methods only in probiotic group. The functional efficacy of the consumed formulation is proved by the increase of the intestinal lactobacilli counts providing putative defence against enteric infections and by reduction of the oxidative stress indices of blood. Athletes and all those exposed to oxidative stress may benefit from the ability of these probiotics to increase antioxidant levels and neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen species.",

Proteomica e Biochimica dei Microrganismi, DBAU Biodegradable plastics can find applications in several commercial products, so-called 'environmental friendly'.In the present research we try to obtain biodegradable polymers from vegetable oils, lowcost industrial by-products that constitute a renewable source of fatty acids (FA). The limiting step of FA polycondensation is the lack of a second carboxyl or hydroxyl function in a terminal (x) or subterminal (x-1) position. We employed an aromatic-degrading Acinetobacter radioresistens S13 strain whose hydroxylating ability, via both mono-and di-oxygenases, has been previously proved (Pessione et al. Eur J Bioch 2003). The growth of A. radioresistens S13 was firstly tested on several aliphatic hydrocarbons (C9, C10, C12, C16, C18) as the sole carbon source. The strain proved to be able to metabolize them, with growth different kinetics, suggesting the presence of an x-oxidative enzyme system. Then we tested growth on fatty acids (from C9 to C18) obtaining satisfactory results for C9 and C18: considering these results and the availability of industrial wastes, we chose pelargonic acid as the most interesting substrate. Experiments are underway to inhibit catalytically, or by gene deletion, b-oxidative enzymes in order to obtain x-hydroxy and x-carboxy fatty acids. We set up a gas chromatography method to verify the consumption of carboxylic acids and the parallel formation of metabolites of interest, with the goal to determine the best conditions for future comparative proteomic experiments. After that we evaluated the consumption of pelargonic acid when it was present as the sole carbon source and when it was supplemented with acrylic acid (b-oxidation inhibitor) and acetate as second carbon source. Results show complete metabolization of pelargonic acid despite the b-oxidation inhibitor.",

VLY belongs to the group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). CDCs bind to cholesterol-rich membranes and form oligomeric transmembrane pores causing eukaryotic cell lysis. VLY is a member of the subgroup of CDCs that recognize human complement regulatory molecule CD59. The interaction of VLY with human CD59 occurs through the domain D4 of VLY. To characterize the structure-function relationship of VLY in more detail, we have generated recombinant VLY, developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against VLY and mapped the epitope recognized by the neutralizing MAbs. VLY gene was amplified using genomic DNA isolated from G.vaginalis clinical isolate. His-tagged VLY was expressed in E. coli and purified using affinity chromatography. The MAbs were generated using hybridoma technology. MAb specificity was studied by Western blotting, ELISA and in vitro hemolytic assay. For epitope mapping, recombinant truncated VLY variants were expressed in E. coli. Recombinant VLY expressed in E. coli was functionally active and induced the lysis of human erythrocytes in vitro. Thirteen MAbs against recombinant VLY were generated. Some of them neutralized the hemolytic activity of VLY. One MAb (clone 9B4) showed the most potent neutralizing activity (IC50 = 6.7\u00b710 -11 ). By using a series of overlapping truncated VLY variants, the epitope for MAb 9B4 was mapped within the region spanning aa 112-165 of VLY. This region is located in the domain D3 of VLY and contains the conserved motif VAARMQYD that is supposed to be inolved in oligomerization.",

            "text": "Background: Cholesterol is an important basic building block for body tissues. However elevated blood cholesterol is a well known major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Therefore interest in use of probiotics for lowering blood cholesterol levels is increasing continuously. Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relation between exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing and cholesterol removal of Bifidobacterium breve A28, S4 and S9 and Bifidobacterium bifidum A10 and S9 strains that were isolated from breast fed infants feces and breast milk samples. Material and Methods: Total EPS (expressed as mg/l) was estimated in each sample by phenol-sulphuric acid method. Cholesterol removal was studied according to a modified method of Gilliland et al. Results: B. breve A28 and S4 strains which produced high EPS (97.64 and 93.67 mg/l, respectively) and B. bifidum A10 and B. breve S9 strains which produced low EPS (38.00 and 39.85 mg/l, respectively) were determined. Cholesterol removal of high EPS production B. breve A28 and S4 were found better than low EPS production B. bifidum A10 and B. breve S9. Conclusion: This investigation showed that high EPS production of Bifidobacteria may be important in the selection of probiotic strains for cholesterol removal. Aim: Drug-induced liver injury is a problem of increasing significance, but has been a long-standing concern in the treatment of tuberculosis infection, especially in case of several antituberculosis medications co-administration. Nevertheless the exact mechanism and factors contributing to liver toxicity remain poorly understood. Internal medicine literature suggests that the hepatotoxic effects of ethambutol are not unusual and transient, but the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity is unknown. In the current study we examined effects of ethambutol on CYP2E1 gene expression. Methods: Influence of therapeutic dose administration of ethambutol (during 2 month) on the CYP2E1 gene expression level in male rats' liver has been evaluated by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction. Total cytochrome P450 and reduced glutathione content, microsomal p-nitrophenol hydroxylase and glutathione-S-transferase activity also were measured. Results: In 24 hours after final ethambutol administration the high level of CYP2E1 expression in liver has been demonstrated. At the same time p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity levels rose in 4 times and total cytochrome P450 content increased by 36% as compared with control, which was additionally evidence of CYP2E1 induction. These events attended with rising of glutathione-S-transferase activity and reduced glutathione content by 17% and 20% respectively. Conclusion: The information regarding drug-drug interactions mediated by the induction of cytochrome P-450 2E1 during antituberculosis therapy is known to isoniazid. In addition to the reported inductive effects of mentioned antituberculosis drug, our results newly showed ethambutol effect on gene expression level of this isoform. Was significant to note that ethambutol is reported not metabolized by CYP450. Results encourage for further research toward CYP450-mediated mechanisms of ethambutol hepatotoxicity and its investment to drug-drug interaction in order to develop new solutions for prediction and prevention of antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury. De novo purine synthesis (DNPS) requires 10 enzymatic steps to generate inosine 5'-monophosphate, and is catalyzed by 6 enzymes. Coordinated channeling of intermediates through a multimeric protein structure was suspected. Recently An et al. described transient structure-purinosome in the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells transiently transfected with proteins of DNPS, which is regulated by amount of purines. In our study we confirmed the existence of purinosome also in non-transfected carcinoma and in normal cells (skin fibroblasts (SF), keratocytes (KC)). Cells (HeLa, SAOS, HepG2, SF, KC) were seeded either to purine depleted (PD) or purine rich (PR) medium. After 24 hours immunofluorescence was performed with anti-ATIC and anti-PPAT antibodies (beginning and end of DNPS), as secondary antibodies served species appropriate Alexas \u00d2 488 and 555. Labeled proteins were imaged by confocal microscopy and colocalized. To measure the duration of single purinosome structures, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-FGAMS and mCherry-ATIC, seeded to PD medium and single cell was observed for 24 hours. We observed formation of purinosomes in all cell types seeded to the PD medium, but cells seeded to PR medium showed diffuse distribution of both tested proteins. Carcinoma cell lines formed purinosome only in 5-7% of the population, the formation of purinosome was much higher ( \u202120%) in the cells with longer doubling time (SF and KC). In the life experiments we observed formation of many transient structures and each of them lasts for maximum 90 min. Purinosome is transient structure with very short duration. Based on our data we suggest that formation of this structure is dependent on particular cell phase. However the full understanding of the nature of purinosome is still unknown and worth further exploration. PPARG gene polymorphisms have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MS). PPARc is the key orchestrator of the transcriptional cascade underlying adipocyte differentiation, and also plays a key role in the entraining of adipose tissue lipid metabolism to nutritional state. In this study we analysed whether genetic variants of PPARG gene are associated with traits of MS and T2DM. Correlation between biochemical parameters (including but not limited to, glucose, HbA1c, insulin levels, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, serum proteins, liver enzymes) and frequency of polymorphisms in PPARG gene (rs10865710, rs3856806 and rs1801282), were tested. The study included 73 patients diagnosed with MS and T2DM and 37 healthy controls from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Three polymorphisms of gene PPARG (rs10865710, rs385806 and rs1801282), were analyzed by real time PCR and by conventional PCR-RFLP method. Our results showed that Pro12Ala (rs1801282) polymorphism was statistically significantly associated with levels of LDL cholesterol (p = 0.006), activities of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.024), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0016) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.042). Polymorphism 1431C > T (rs3856808) showed statistically significantly association with creatinine levels (p = 0.027). Futhermore, haplotype analysis of PPARG gene showed statistically significant association with LDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.033) and ALT activity (p = 0.020). Thus, these data reflect an association of analyzed PPARG gene polymorphisms with levels of LDL, creatinine, AST and ALT activity, and BMI, suggesting an important role of this gene variants in metabolic disorders. As site of the main oxidative reactions, mitochondria are the organelle committed to metabolic energy production required for all cellular functions. Because of the ubiquitous presence of these organelles, their density and function have a significant impact on whole-body metabolism. Consequently, finding new mitochondrial regulators could expand the knowledge on cell biology and biochemistry. The molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial biogenesis remain poorly understood, and only few transcription factors or coactivators (e.g. PGC-1a, NRF-1, mTFA) have been associated with this process. Thus the aim of the present study was to discover new potential mitochondrial factors able to control mitochondrial density and activity.",

All these clones were then validated for their ability to induce or reduce mitochondrial density and function using staining assays (MitotrackerTM Green and MitotrackerTM CM-H2-Rox).

Finally, the 239 genes were classified for their biological and molecular function using a bioinformatic analysis in order to identify the biological pathways in which they are involved.

The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has been demonstrated to be released from glucose-challenged rodent and human pancreatic beta cells. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of ABA stimulate both glucose-dependent and -independent insulin secretion. Therefore, we started an in vivo study on whether a glucose load was accompanied by enhanced plasma levels of ABA. We determined plasma ABA concentrations in healthy subjects during prolonged (240 min) oral or intravenous glucose tolerance tests (OGTT, IVGTT). In all subjects undergoing OGTT (n = 10), plasmatic ABA concentrations increased 3-7 times over basal values, peaking at 60-120 min after glucose administration. A significant positive correlation was found between the ABA area under the curve (AUC) and the glucose AUC (p < 0.05). In 3 out of 5 IVGTT, little or no increase of ABA levels was observed. In the remaining two subjects, the ABA increase was similar to that during OGTT. Incretins may mediate the stronger stimulation of ABA release by oral glucose, since presence of GIP and GLP-1 potentiated the glucose-induced ABA release from an insulinoma cell line (by 8 and 3 times, respectively). In addition to pancreatic islets, we found that human adipose tissue (obtained from abdominoplasty) also releases ABA in response to high (25 mM) glucose (3-fold over controls). Accordingly, adipocytes obtained upon differentiation of either human mesenchymal stem cells or of 3T3-L1 cells, released ABA in the supernatant when exposed to high glucose concentrations (approx. 4-fold over control in both cell types). At nanomolar concentrations, ABA stimulated glucose uptake (2-fold over untreated cells and in the same range of insulininduced glucose uptake) in 3T3-L1 cells differentiated to adipocytes.",

Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 2 (MODY2) is characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion and hyperglycemia, monogenic autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, nonketotic disease, lack of auto-antibodies and age at onset less than 25 years. In South Italy it accounts between 8% and 56% of MODY forms. Particularly, MODY2 is associated with heterozygous mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene which alter the enzyme activity. We sequenced GCK gene in 124 patients from South Italy with suspect MODY2 and identified 44 mutated children; 15 mutations were novel. We performed both the in silico modeling of the structural alterations and the enzyme functional study of the most significant mutations. All the investigated mutations reduced GCK enzyme activity and also affected the thermal stability of the protein, so contributing to the hyperglycemia observed in MODY2 patients. In conclusion, the identification of GCK mutations in diabetic children, confirms the diagnosis of MODY2 and helps to predict the likely prognosis and clinical course. Since the proband's sibling will have a 50% chance of having inherited the mutation (unless the mutation is de novo) and the disease can be subclinical prior to undertake the genetic screening, this diagnosis has implications also for other family members. In addition, although more than 600 inactivating GCK mutations have been reported, only less than 20% of these mutations have been functionally characterized and so our study adds new information on the structure-function relationship of GCK and the MODY2. Some experimental models of nephropathy have recently shown that activation of TACE/ADAM17 is involved in nephropathy, even though the exact role of ADAM17 and its inhibitor TIMP3 in a hyperglycemic environment is unclear. To test this hypothesis we treated WT mice with streptozocin to induce hyperglycemia, and then measured TACE activity in kidney; we found a significant activation of the enzyme in hyperglycemic (STZ, streptozocin-treated) mice compared to untreated controls (p < 0.001). Next, we analyzed STZ-WT and STZ-Timp-3-/-kidneys. STZ-Timp-3-/-mice showed incresead mean glomerular area and fractional mesangial area (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), a thicker glomerular basement membrane, due to an increased amount of type IV collagen deposition (p < 0.01). STZ-Timp-3-/-showed increased macrophage infiltration, measured by F4/80 staining (p < 0.01). Oxidative stress markers staining revealed that STZ-Timp-3-/-mice are characterized by an increased expression of NOX4, RAGE and N-Carboxymethyl-lysine, a major product of oxidative modification of glycated proteins (p < 0.01 for all). To analyze the role of TIMP3 we performed real time PCR on kidney RNA from STZ-Timp-3-/and WT mice. MCP-1, a marker of inflammation, was increased while nephrin and WT1, two podocyte markers were reduced in STZ-Timp-3-/-mice compared to the WT littermates (p < 0.01 for all). Microarray profiling revealed up-regulation of different classes of genes involved in inflammation (Cxcl9, Ccr5, Mcp-1, Mcp-5, Cd36, Mgl-1, Mgl-2), renal cells proliferation and fibrosis (Pdgf-d, Tgfb3, Fgf, Ghr) and lipid metabolism (Fabp5, Fasn, Ldlr, Acaca, Acms3) in STZ-Timp-3-/-mice compared to WT ones. We found a significant reduction in the expression of genes connected to control of oxidative stress (Foxo1 and Foxo3a) in the kidney of STZ-Timp-3-/-mice. In conclusion our results show that the deficiency of Timp3 is correlated to inflammation and oxidative stress accumulation in diabetic nephropathy. Introduction: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with dysregulated expression of hepatic genes related to metabolic homeostasis including carbohydrates and lipids. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise intensity on global gene expression in fatty liver of high-fat induced male C57BL/6. Materials and Methods: At age of 5 weeks, a total of male C57BL/6 mice (n = 40) were randomly divided into a standard chow diet (SCD, n = 10) and a high fat diet (HFD, n = 30), and they were subjected to 8 weeks of SCD and HFD, respectively. After the initial 8-week dietary treatments, the mice in the HFD group were further assigned to either HFD or moderate exercise (HFD + MODEX) or interval exercise (HFD + IN-TEX) lasting for additional 8 weeks. Global mRNA expression using cDNA microarrays was measured in hepatic tissues of the SCD, HFD, HFD + MODEX, and HFD + INTEX groups. Results: HFD induced a significant dysregulation in the expression of 418 hepatic genes related to metabolic homeostasis, de novo lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and etc. Exercise training normalized the expression of 67 genes out of the HFD-induced 418 hepatic genes. In particular, both moderate and interval exercises were equally effective in normalizing the dysregulated expression of several hepatic genes involved in de novo lipogenesis such as Insig-1 & -2 and hepatic lipid homeostasis and liver growth such as Cyp2b10, Cyp51, Cyp2c29, and Cyp4a12b (cytochrome P450 enzyme family). Conclusion: Our data show that regardless of intensity, exercise training can be used as a non-pharmacologic means for normalizing the dysregulated expression of genes underlying the pathology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated to unbalanced energy intake and expenditure and has been proposed as a possible cause to the onset of obesity and the often consequent insulin resistance and diabetes. By using selective biochemical inhibitors here we show that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important regulators of mitochondrial function. MS275, a class I selective HDAC inhibitor, increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in C2C12 murine myotubes via upregulation of the coactivator PGC-1 a, a key determinant of mitochondrial biogenesis. Knock down of HDAC3 by RNAi increased the expression of PGC-1 a and recapitulated the effects of MS275. Administration of MS275 to db/db mice improved the obese and diabetic phenotype as body weight, fasting glucose and insulin levels were lower and insulin sensitivity was higher than in control mice. Metabolic studies showed elevated oxygen consumption in mice on MS275 and the concomitant decrease of the respiratory exchange ratio suggested a switch to oxidative metabolism. In addition, higher heat production was noticed in mice treated with MS275, an effect paralleled by the improved functionality of brown adipose tissue consequent to increased expression of typical marker genes such as Ucp1, Prdm16, Adrb3, Pgc-1 a. Remarkably, visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice treated with MS275 underwent a major reprogramming as several markers of brown fat were increased in a Prdm16-independent fashion. At the same time, infiltration of macrophages and the expression of inflammatory markers in WAT were reduced. In conclusion, biochemical inhibition of class I HDACs revealed a mitochondrial signature mediated by the transcriptional coactivator Pgc-1 a in skeletal muscle and by the Pgc-1 a /Ppar c axis in adipose tissue, leading to insulin sensitizing effect in db/db mice.

Previously we showed that knock-down of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated FA, protects muscle against lipid-induced insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to investigate mechanisms by which different FA affect insulin signaling. The experiments were performed on 14-week old male Wistar rats fed either chow, high-fat (HF, 60% calories from fat, mainly palmitic acid) or high-trioleate (TO, 36% calories from fat) diets for 8 weeks. In HF-and TO-fed rats the onset of diet-induced obesity was accompanied by moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia with overly impaired glucose tolerance. Intracellular triglyceride (TG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) contents were increased in the soleus of HF-and TO-fed rats compared to chow-fed rats. These changes were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC. Furthermore, the content of GLUT4 in plasma membrane was significantly reduced by HF and TO feeding. PKC-theta membrane translocation was significantly increased in muscles of TO-fed rats. To examine the intracellular mechanisms linking oleate to increased PKC activity, we incubated C2C12 myotubes with palmitate (16 : 0) or oleate (18 : 1). Free FA, DAG and TG levels were increased in both 16 : 0-and 18 : 1-treated myotubes compared to control group. While 16 : 0 led to insulin resistance, the 18 : 1 treatment did not affect insulin sensitivity in myotubes. The decreased insulin sensitivity due to 16 : 0 was accompanied by decreased unsaturated FA content in muscle DAG. This effect was not observed in 18 : 1 treated cells. Obtained results suggest that FA composition of intramyocellular DAG can be a part of a molecular switch linking FA and insulin signaling.

Female mice lacking PTPe (EKO mice) are protected from weight gain following physiological stress, such ovariectomy, a high-fat diet, or old age (>1 year). When fed high-fat food, EKO mice exhibit increased whole body energy expenditure, consistent with their resistance to obesity; food consumption and physical activity are normal in EKO mice. EKO mice also exhibit improved blood glucose regulation. Young, asymptomatic EKO mice are markedly leptin hyper-sensitive and exhibit strong trends for decreased plasma leptin levels.",

Following injection of leptin into mice, hypothalamic RPTPe is phosphorylated in vivo at its Y695, most likely by JAK2. This phosphorylation event is critical for the ability of RPTPe to down-regulate JAK2 since the non-phosphorylatable Y695F RPTPe cannot do so efficiently in cells. We conclude that RPTPe targets JAK2 in a negative-feedback mechanism that down-regulates hypothalamic leptin signaling. The dependence of this activity on leptin-induced phosphorylation of RPTPe suggests that RPTPe returns leptin signaling to baseline. Lack of RPTPe increases leptin sensitivity and alters the physiological response to stress that affects body mass. Interleukin-21 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is produced mainly by activated CD4+ T cells and NKT cells and exerts its effects on immune and non-immune cells. Recently, several studies suggested a role for IL-21 in mediating chronic inflammatory responses. As obesity is characterized by systemic chronic low grade inflammatory state that is causative of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we compared C57BL/6J wt and IL-21 knockout (IL-21 k.o.) mice in a context of diet induced obesity. Animals were subjected to metabolic characterization: weight and blood glucose monitoring, glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance tests, blood pressure measuring. Metabolic chambers were used to assess the metabolic rate of these animals. At the end of six months of high fat diet (HFD) mice were sacrificed and metabolically active organs were collected for molecular studies. IL-21 knockout mice showed lower weight due to less adipose tissue accumulation, lower levels of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and hypoinsulinemia (p < 0.01) compared to wt littermates. In liver, western blot analysis showed impaired phosphorylation and acetylation of FoxO1 and Real Time-PCR experiments revealed an increase in PEPCK and G6pase (p < 0.01) in IL-21 k.o compared to wt mice in the fasting state. RNA expression profiling for inflammatory genes revealed that IL-21 k.o. mice have significant lower levels of F4/80 and CD68 (p < 0.01) in liver and WAT compared with wt, suggesting a lower rate of macrophages infiltration in these organs. Taken together, our data indicate that IL-21 k.o. mice are protected from the metabolic injury caused by HFD. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenotype.",

            "text": "Ghrelin regulates obesity-related receptors in a rat obesity model The nervous system regulates energy balance by integrating orexigenic and anorexigenic signals from the periphery. In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), anabolic neurons express a variety of receptors that participate in the regulation of feeding behavior, including Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR) and leptin receptor (Ob-R). Their ligands, hormones ghrelin and leptin, respectively, both regulate feeding behavior and fat oxidation in an opposing manner. Ghrelin, mainly produced in the stomach, stimulates the gut-brain orexigenic axis to increase food intake and reduce fat mobilization. As obese individuals have lower fasting ghrelin levels, removal of the stomach fundus by sleeve gastrectomy is the surgical procedure of choice for morbid obesity and results in decreased apetite. However, the regulatory interactions between molecules of the gut-brain axis are not known. Therefore, we undertook these studies to investigate the correlation among ghrelin and obesity-related receptors in the dynamic setting of post-gastrectomy. We developed a rat obesity model, where animals were fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks and then underwent sleeve gastrectomy or sham operation. All animals were then fed normal diet, and, when sacrifized one or three months later, ghrelin and ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) in the stomach, and GHSR and Ob-R mRNA levels in the hypothalamus were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We found that sleeve gastrectomy decreased ghrelin message in the stomach over obese, sham-or non-operated animals even after 3-mo. GOAT patterns followed that of ghrelin initially suggesting co-regulation of their expression as well as acylation of ghrelin. Moreover, lower acyl-ghrelin levels resulted in decreased GHSR and Ob-R expression in the hypothalamus. Our results indicate that ghrelin participates in the control of energy balance through the regulation of its own receptor GHSR and of Ob-R expression in the hypothalamus of obese animals. Cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (BA) which is the major metabolic pathway of cholesterol disposal in mammals. CYP7A1 gene expression is repressed by BA returning to the liver via enterohepatic circulation. We previously showed that BA stimulate the sequential recruitment of HDAC 7, 3, and 1, and of the corepressors Silencing Mediator of Retinoid and Thyroid receptors-a (SMRT-a) and N-CoR1 on CYP7A1 promoter that finally repress CYP7A1 gene transcription. Moreover, we showed that valproic acid (VPA) and trichostatin A (TSA), two non-selective HDAC inhibitors (HDAC-i), stimulate CYP7A1 expression in vitro and in vivo by preventing the negative feedback exerted by BA and consequently decreasing serum cholesterol in mice. Based on these studies, the aim of this work is to define the importance of specific HDACs on cholesterol catabolism to bile acids. By using siRNA oligonuecleotides we were able to show that HDAC7 plays an important role in CYP7A1 regulation. To understand the relative importance of the activity of different HDACs in BA biosynthetic pathway, we tested different HDAC-i on human hepatoma cell lines, the pan-inhibitor SAHA, the class 1 selective HDAC-i MS 275, and the class 2 selective HDAC-i MC 1568. Our results show that the class 1 selective HDAC-i MS275 prevents the repressive effect of BA on CYP7A1 expression, whereas the pan inhibitor SAHA and the class 2 HDAC selective inhibitor MC1568 allow only a partial recovery of CYP7A1 expression after BA treatment. Our results highlight the role of class 1 HDACs in the formation of the repressive complex acting on CYP7A1 promoter and suggest that the inhibition of class 2 HDAC activity may not be sufficient to prevent the inhibitory effect of bile acids on CYP7A1 promoter.

The aim of the present study was to go further into the sex dependent differences about BAT thermo-genic capacity by investigating the effect of the ovariectomy and 17b estradiol replacement on brown adipose tissue mitochondrial function. In this study, fourteen-week-old male, female and ovariectomized female Wistar rats were used. Rats were ovariectomized at 5 weeks of age and were treated every 2 days with placebo (OVX group) or 17b estradiol (10 lg/kg) (OVX + E2 group) for the 4 weeks before sacrifice. Serum levels of E2 were measured. We determined the oxidative capacity, antioxidant defences and oxidative damage markers in BAT. Moreover, the levels of key elements of mitochondrial biogenesis as well as UCP1 protein levels, as an index of mitochondrial thermogenic capacity, were also determined. In response to ovariectomy, mitochondrial proliferation increased resulting in less functional mitochondria, a similar profile to that found in male rats. Although E2 supplementation was able to restore the serum levels of E2 shown by control female rats, the treatment revert only in part the effects of the ovariectomy, and oxidative and antioxidant capacities in OVX+E2 rats did not reach the levels shown by control females. Taking these results into account, we suggest that ovarian hormones are responsible, at least in part, for the sexual dimorphism in BAT mitochondrial function. However, other signals produced by ovary, rather than E2, would play an important role in the control of mitochondrial function in BAT.",

Recent works aim at developing dual PPAR a/c agonists devoid of the side effects of the antidiabetic agents thiazolidinediones and the dual-agonists glitazars. We studied the molecular mechanism of action of a new compound, LT175, and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in cell and animal models. In cell-based assays LT175 activates both PPARa and PPARc. Because of the unique structural properties of the ligand-receptor complex, we studied the coregulator recruitment by FRET, which revealed that LT175 is a full PPARa and a partial PPARc agonist. We tested the biological activity of LT175 in mouse adipocytes, showing lower lipid accumulation than the PPARc full agonist rosiglitazone, which may be explained by the lower expression of genes for fatty acid uptake (CD36) and glycerol 3-phosphate formation (PEPCK and GYK). Using PPRE-LUC reporter mice we showed that LT175 switches on the PPAR-dependent transcription program in typical target tissues. Administration of LT175 to Diet Induced Obese (DIO) mice decreases plasma glucose, insulin, Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA), triglycerides and cholesterol while it increases adiponectin and FGF21 levels, ameliorating the metabolic profile and insulin sensitivity. Data obtained by RT-qPCR in DIO and db/db mice show that LT175 enhances the expression of PPAR target genes in the liver and adipose tissue. LT175, opposite to rosiglitazone, does not increase the expression of renal sodium transporter ENaCc, which is involved in fluid retention. These results indicate that LT175 has favourable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism with a reduction of some of the major side-effects and could therefore represent a new PPAR ligand with a more favourable profile as compared to glitazones. High fat diet (HFD) is usually associated with the development of obesity and liver steatosis. Iodothyronines exert pronounced effects on lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Previous studies demonstrated that 3,5-L-diiodothyronine (T2), as well as 3,3',5-L-triiodothyronine (T3), were able to both prevent and reverse hepatic steatosis in rats fed HFD, and this effect depends on a direct action of iodothyronines on the hepatocyte. However, the involvement of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in mediating the lipid-lowering effect of iodothyronines in the liver was not yet established. In this study, we investigated the ability of T2 and T3 to reduce the lipid excess using an in vitro model of hepatic steatosis. To mimic the fatty liver condition, the rat hepatoma FaO cells defective for functional TRs were treated with a fatty acid mixture (2 : 1 molar ratio, final concentration) for 3h and then exposed to pharmacological doses of T2 or T3 (10-5 and 10-6 M) for 24 hours. The absence of constitutive mRNA expression of both TRa1 and TRb1 in FaO cells was verified by RT-qPCR. Lipid accumulation, mRNA expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-a,-c,-d) the acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), and the apolipoprotein B (Apo B), as well as fuel-stimulated O 2 consumption in intact cells were evaluated. Lipid accumulation resulted in a increase of TAG content, PPARc mRNA expression, and a decrease in PPARd mRNA expression. The addition of T2 or T3 to lipid-overloaded FaO cells resulted in: (i) reduction in lipid content; (ii) down-regulation of PPARa, PPARc and AOX expression; (iii) increase in PPARd and Apo B expression; (iv) stimulation of mitochondrial uncoupling. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that in the FaO hepatocyte the lipid-lowering actions of both T2 and T3 are not mediated by TRs.",

The results showed that the chimeras with reconstituted HO-1+/) bone marrow were protected from HFDinduced insulin resistance. The beneficial effect of HO-1 haploinsufficiency appeared to be associated with lower adipose macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis, suggesting that HO-1 has an effect on the migration of myeloid cells toward obese adipose tissue. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the peritoneal macrophages from HO-1+/) mice exhibited decreased VEGF-and MCP-1-induced migration as compared to macrophages from WT mice. Moreover, both VEGF and MCP-1 induced phosphorylations of p38, Akt and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were decreased in the HO-1+/) peritoneal macrophages. Further experiments demonstrated that both carbon monoxide and bilirubin, the byproducts derived from heme degradation by HO-1 reaction, enhanced macrophage migration. The phosphorylations of p38 and FAK were significantly induced by treatments of macrophages with carbon monoxide and bilirubin, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that hematopoietic HO-1 has a pathophysiological role in HFD-induced insulin resistance via modulating macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue.",

Yoshida Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine Ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) is the sole iron exporter in mammals and regulates iron homeostasis. Although Fpn1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by iron-regulated hormone hepcidin and ironresponsive element (IRE) on its mRNA, mechanism of transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) belongs to the basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) transcription factor family and has a central role in protecting cells against oxidative stress through the upregulation of antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-mediated gene transcription. In this study, we showed that Nrf2 upregulates Fpn1 mRNA expression in macrophages. Nrf2 activation by several electrophilic compounds commonly resulted in the up-regulation of Fpn1 mRNA in bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages obtained from wildtype, but not from Nrf2 knockout, mice. Further, Nrf2 activation actually enhanced iron release from the murine macrophage cell line J774.1. It is previously reported that LPS suppresses Fpn1 mRNA expression, which leads to iron retention in monocytes and macrophages. The increase of intracellular iron level is often associated with the enhanced inflammation. While LPS suppressed Fpn1 mRNA expression in human macrophages, Nrf2 activation restored the expression of Fpn1. Furthermore, LPS induced suppression of Fpn1 mRNA and induction of Hepc mRNA in peritoneal macrophages, but sulforaphane (SFN) counteracted these changes by Nrf2-dependent and -independent mechanism. These results suggest that Nrf2 regulates Fpn1 gene transcription and modulates iron efflux from macrophages during LPS-induced inflammation.",

Plasma insulin level and insulin secretion in TO-fed group was on the control level what may suggest impaired betacell adaptation. H&E staining revealed hyperplasia of islets in HF-fed group, and reduction in islets size in TO-fed group. BrdU incorporation assay showed increased proliferation of beta-cells in HF-compared with TO-fed group.

NO-synthase belongs to hem containing cytoreductases and has both cytoprotector and cytotoxic properties. The goal of presented work is the investigation of intracellular location of liver, brain and kidney NO-synthase (NOS). The enzyme activity in the homogenates of these tissues is explored (in liver -0.66 mcmol, in brain -0.091 mcmol, in kidneys -0.041 mcmol in 1g fresh tissue). For investigation of NO-synthase's intracellular location the homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min 1500 g. Enzyme activity was explored both in soluble fraction and with subcellular components bound state (1:1,5 appropriately). To solubilize NO-synthase bound with subcellular components it was investigated the approach of double freezing and thawing of homogenates, followed with centrifugation which lead to collect soluble fraction in supernatant. NO-synthase activity assay in precipitate and supernatant fractions was used as the measure of the enzyme solubilization. Detected high NO-synthase activity in precipitate (much greater than in supernatant) allows us to conclude that bulk activity of NO-synthase remains in subcellular components in bound state, which don't allow solubilizing the enzyme due to membrane disruption.

Angiogenic factors play a pivotal role in development of microvascular complications associated with diabetes. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent mitogen and survival factor for endothelial cells that has been shown to initiate vasculogenesis and angiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell proliferation, migration and sprouting. We aimed to study angiogenesis mechanism which performs as a result of VEGF and glucose induction in endothelial cells from human term placenta. Methods: Human placental endothelial cells were exposed to VEGF (VEGF165, 100 ng/ml), 5 mM D-glucose (normal glucose conditions) and 25 mM D-glucose (high glucose conditions) for 24 and 48 hours in vitro. D-Mannitol was used as an osmotic control. The expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1), and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) were measured using RT-PCR, and western blotting techniques. Cell proliferation assay was examined to study proliferative processes in human placental endothelial cells following the VEGF and glucose induction. In addition, in order to study the role of mitogenic signal transduction pathways in this process, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was measured using western blotting technique. Results: VEGF165 and high glucose upregulated the expressions of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 mRNA and protein. It was also shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway play a role in endothelial cell proliferation in placental angiogenesis which induced by hyperglycemia. Conclusion: We believe that our study will be beneficial to understand the reasons of malformations which occur during diabetes for clinical approaches and the molecular mechanisms of placental angiogenesis during diabetes.

            "text": "Plasma conjugated linoleic acid isomers levels in peritoneal dialysis patients and healty subjects F. Ye. Hu\u00a8meyra, _ I. Mehmetog\u02d8lu, S. Kurban and Z. Tonbul Biochemistry Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a mixture of isomers of linoleic acid with conjugated double bonds, wherein the isomers c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA are the most abundant and the two isomers have very different health effects. We have determined plasma CLA isomers in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and in healthy subjects. This study was performed on 51 (21M, 30F) CAPD patients at least 6 months under dialysis, aged 20-75 years (mean 47.81 \u00b1 11.8 years) and 45 (25M, 20F) healthy control subjects aged 20-60 years (mean 38.62 \u00b1 12.9 years). CLA isomers (t10, c12-CLA and c9, t11-CLA) levels were measured by GS-MS technique. t10, c12 and c9,t11 isomers of CLA levels of the CAPD patients were found as follows: 11.84 \u00b1 5.3 and 8.34 \u00b1 4.4 mg/l respectively. The same parameters of the controls were as follows: 12.88 \u00b1 4.1 and 9.20 \u00b1 4.5 mg/l respectively. The differences between plasma CLA isomers levels of CAPD patients and control subjects were not significant. These findings suggest that the levels of t10, c12 and c9,t11 isomers of CLA are not changed in CAPD patients a finding which needs to be supported by further investigations. In previous study, Dgcs1 disruptant lacking of the gene encoding c-glutamylcysteine synthetase 1 (GCS1) were non-viable in minimal defined medium and showed typical apoptosis due to the depletion of reduced glutathione In Candida albicans. Dgcs1 disruptant in glutathione-free medium showed significant increase in methylglyoxal (MG) and an MG-oxidized C3 compound, pyruvate compared to wild type strain. Novel MG-specific oxidizing enzyme induced by increased intracellular MG and D-pyruvate levels of Dgcs1 was thought to be expressed in response to MG accumulation and this enzyme, catalyzing the oxidation of MG to D-pyruvate directly, was purified and characterized. And also, purified methylglyoxal dehydrogenase 1 (MGD1) showed that it could perform enzymatic reversible reaction with MG and pyruvate as substrates in oxidation and reduction reactions in the presence of NAD+ or NADH. Dmgd1 strain was more sensitive to H2O2 and MG compared to wild-type strain and intracellular concentrations of MG, pyruvate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased, respectively. Furthermore, inducible expression of caspase gene by elevated MG, G1-specific arrest of cell cycle, and DNA fragmentation were remarkably observed in Dmgd1 strain different from wild type strain. These results suggest that MGD1 gene expression in C. albicans did not only protects the cell from MG and oxidative stress but also associated with intracellular redox state, virulence, apoptosis and normal cell cycle control related to the fluctuation of MG and ROS concentration in C. albicans.

PPAR a, c, and d receptors play an important role in lipid metabolism, regulation of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and insulin sensitivity. Thus the pan-(a, c, d) PPAR activator is expected to efficiently improve lipid and glucose homeostasis. Methods: An established luciferase reporter gene assay system was used to test transactivation of Robinia pseudo-acacia var. umbraculifera (RPA) extract (methanol and 70% ethanol) and its five fractions (methylene chloride, hexane, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water) to human PPAR a, c, and d. The anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects of RPA extract and its fractions were investigated in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity. During the experimental period, body weight and food intake were measured. And at the end of the experimental period, fasting blood glucose, plasma biomarkers, liver/body weight, and adipose tissue/body weight were measured. Results: RPA hexane fraction strongly induced luciferase activity on human PPAR a, c, and d. The supplementation of RPA extract and its fraction for 8 weeks lowered weights of body and liver/body compared to the control HFD group. But adipose tissue/body weight was not significantly different. The groups of mice were orally administered RPA extract (methanol and 70% ethanol) and two fractions (methylene chloride, hexane) among the experimental groups decreased total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol than control HFD group. Conclusions: We suggested that RPA hexane fraction included at least one pan-PPAR agonist and these compounds can be considered as an anti-obesity agent that is effective for suppressing body weight gain and improving the lipid homeostasis. Insulin participates in the development and maintenance of brown adipose tissue (BAT), since promotes adipogenesis and activates the thermogenic program, which shows sex dependent differences. Insulin signaling can be altered in response to an excess of caloric intake, and insulin resistance is a crucial defect associated with obesity. The aim was to investigate the sex-dependent effects of high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding on BAT insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis process. Ten-week-old Wistar rats of both sexes were fed a pelleted low-fat diet or a palatable HFD for 26 weeks. Serum markers of insulin sensitivity were analyzed. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, mitochondrial oxidative activities, peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1a) mRNA levels, as well as the protein levels of insulin receptor subunit b (IRb), glucose transporter GLUT4, b3-adrenergic receptor (b3-AR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) were measured in BAT. In response to HFD feeding, females showed impaired systemic insulin sensitivity accompanied by decreased IRb, GLUT4 and b3-AR protein levels. In addition, TFAM and COX IV protein and PGC-1a mRNA levels decreased in obese females, whereas mtDNA levels increased. In obese males, the decreased mtDNA levels were compensated by increased oxidative and thermogenic capacities, although no significant changes were observed in the elements of the insulin signaling pathway. Taking into account the possible connection between insulin signaling pathway and mitochondriogenesis program, it could be suggested that the reduced insulin sensitivity in BAT of females may be responsible for the impaired biogenesis process found in this sex in response to HFD feeding, whereas the enhanced mitochondrial functionality of obese males would avoid increased oxidative damage and the impairment of insulin signaling. Although, emerging evidences suggest a strong association of activity of certain liver enzymes, such as ALT (alanine amino transferase) and GGT (gamma glutamyl transpeptidase) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), limited number of studies have examined the association of liver enzymes with T2DM control. Upto now, synchronized data related to the relevance of continuous monitoring of these liver markers in progression of T2DM are lacking. In this study we examined association of liver enzymes activities and lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) levels in T2DM patients. We analyzed the activities of ALT, AST (aspartate amino transferase), GGT and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) levels of, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), cholesterol and triglycerides in 40 T2DM patients, and 40 age-matched healthy controls. Blood samples were collected from all participants in regular 3-months intervals up to 6 months period. All subjects included in this study were free of evidence of hepatitis, viral infection, or active liver and kidney damage. Standard IFCC enzyme protocols were used to determine enzyme activities on the Alcyon analyzer. As expected, the results showed a significant correlation between cholesterol and triglycerides levels in Type 2 diabetic patients (p < 0.01). In all three time intervals of measurements we observed a highly positive correlation between AST and ALT (p < 0.01) and GGT and AST (p < 0.01).Our results also demonstrated an association of ALT activity and triglycirides levels in diabetic patients (p < 0.05). Our data suggest relevance of monitoring of liver enzymes activityes, particularly ALT, in even adequately controlled diabetes. Adiponectin and leptin are two hormones exclusively secreted from adipose tissue. Both of them regulate fat metabolism. The study was performed on 50 Wistar female rats. The rats were separated into five groups. The groups were as follows: Control group (group-I), high fat group (group-II), forskolin group (group-III), rolipram group (group-IV), forskolin + rolipram group (group-V). Control group was fed normal laboratory chow, the other groups were fed 60% fat in their chow forskolin group received 5 mg/ kg/day of 10% forskolin extract, rolipram group received 0.1 mg/kg/day rolipram, forskolin plus rolipram group received 5 mg/kg/day forskolin and 0.1 mg/kg/day in addition to 60% fat in their chow. The groups were fed 10 weeks and forskolin and rolipram were added to the chow for last two weeks via gastric gavage After that period, the rats were killed under ketamine anesthesia and serum hormones levels were measured by commercially available kits. Our results show that adiponectin levels were reduced and leptin levels were increased with weight gain compared to the control group, except those of the rolipram group. Also, there was no difference between adiponectin and leptin levels of high fat groups except a significant difference between leptin level of high fat group and rolipram group. Thus, it was concluded that fors-kolin had no effect on adiponectin levels but rolipram prevented an increase in leptin levels. In recent years, the potential adverse effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in human health and ecosystems have become a major research issue. The monomer bisphenol A (BPA, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane) is one of the industrial compounds that have generated concerns due to its high production and widespread use in many consumer products. The purpose of this work is to examine the influence of BPA on invertebrates (insects) and Sesamia non-agrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was selected as an organism to evaluate the endocrine disrupting effects. We determine the early molecular effects of BPA in S. non-agrioides larvae using the HSPs genes (Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp83, Hsp20.8 and Hsp19.5) as biomarkers. The SnoHsp70 gene, which is considered to be an indication of cellular stress, has not been affected from the BPA treated. In contrast, BPA induced the SnoHsp19.5 and SnoHsp23 genes. Ecdysteroid analog RH-5992 increased the SnoHsp19.5 and SnoHsp23 mRNA levels. Our results demonstrate that BPA behaves as an ecdysone-mimetic that is able to up-regulate the small heat shock genes in S. non-agrioides cells. The levels of SnoHsp83, which plays a crucial role in vertebrate sex steroid signal transduction, and SnoHsc70 mRNAs were significantly induced by BPA. The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone), triggers and coordinates the successive stages of the insect's life cycle. In D. melanogaster, the receptor for ecdysone is a heterodimer of the protein encoded by EcR and the ultraspiracle (USP) genes. EcR/USP DNA binding activity requires activation by a chaperone heterocomplex that required for activation of the vertebrate steroid receptors. Hsp90 and Hsc70 are required in vivo for ecdysone receptor activity. Our results have shown that the SnHsp83 and SnHsc70 are activated by BPA and suggest that these genes have the capacity, along with other steroid receptors of vertebrates, to be modulated by BPA. Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) is a cytosolic metalloenzyme highly expressed in human liver where it is responsible for up to 50% of the homocysteine (Hcy) remethylation. BHMT catalyzes methyl transfer from betaine to Hcy to form dimethylglycine and methionine (Met). Hcy arises from reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the product of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methylation reactions. The ratio SAM : SAH, also called ''methylation index'', is an indicator of hypomethylation and influences numerous meth-ylation reactions of DNA, lipids and proteins. Remethylation subsequently leads Hcy to the methionine cycle whereas trans-sulphuration commits Hcy irreversibly to the synthesis of cysteine (Cys). Betaine, a substrate of BHMT, has an important role as a cellular osmolyte and is obtained from the diet or through choline oxidation. Elevated Hcy is a risk factor for many diseases including neural tube defects, cancer, cardiovascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In our study, we examined the levels of important metabolites mentioned above (Hcy, Met, Cys, SAM, SAH, betaine and choline) in well-established hepatoma cell line HepG2 and in BHMT transgenic cell model of HepG2 cells. A sensitive and structurally specific HPLC/MSMS method for the simultaneous quantification of the above-mentioned metabolites has been developed and validated. We studied changes of levels of the metabolites in both cell lines, which were treated with Hcy or S-(d-carboxybutyl)-DLhomocysteine (CBHcy), a specific BHMT inhibitor. These experiments were supplemented with measuring of BHMT enzymatic activities and with 2DE-proteomic studies. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in the regulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (Cyp7a1) transcription in response to bile acids (BA). BA increases the HDAC7 nuclear concentration in hepatocytes and promotes the assembly of a repressor complex on the Cyp7a1 promoter. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) stimulate Cyp7a1 expression and decrease serum cholesterol in mice. The aim of this work was to better understand the role of HDACs, and in particular HDAC7, in the regulation of Cyp7a1 transcription. As a first approach we decided to generate a conditional liver-specific knock-out of Hdac7 gene (H7Liv-KO) using the Cre-loxP technology. Preliminary experiments indicate that H7LivKO mice were viable but we observed a high degree of variability among animals, probably due to the mixed genetic background. These findings suggest that backcrossing with C57Bl/6J is required in order to achieve offspring with a more homogeneous genetic background. A second approach has been the treatment of wt C57Bl/6J mice with pan (SAHA), class I (MS275) and class II selective (MC1568) HDACi. Preliminary experiments were conducted with mice treated for one week every day (ED) or every other day (EOD) with HDACi. Body weight, food and water consumption, glycemia and cholesterol level have been evaluated and no differences where detected between ED and EOD mice. Gene expression analyses showed that the treatment with the class I HDAC selective inhibitor induced a partial de-repression of Cyp7a1 at transcriptional level, implying a major role of class I HDACs in the regulation of Cyp7a1 gene transcription in vivo. Understanding of the relationship between the level of gene expression and catalytic activity of metabolic enzymes modulated by therapeutic agents might lead to the development of novel strategies for regulation of these processes. In this respect, much attention has been focused on the induction or inhibition of CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 isoenzyme), which is involved in the biotransformation of more than 50% of all drugs clinically used. Furthermore, it is known that the expression of CYP3A4 is affected by different factors from genetic polymorphism to xenobiotic exposure. In the light of all above, we determined the effect of antitumor agents C-1748 and C-1305 on the level, gene expression and enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 in HepG2 cells. Both compounds were developed in our Department, and they exhibited high cytotoxic activity against a broad spectrum of tumor cell lines in vitro.",

            "text": "Considering that the derivatives differ in chemical structure and in metabolic pathway in cancer cells, we hypothesized that C-1748 and C-1305 could influence the action of CYP3A4 in the specific manner. Enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 was assessed by HPLC control of 6b-hydroxytestosterone concentration after incubation of treated cells with testosterone. The direct effect of C-1748 and C-1305 on the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA was determined by Real-time PCR analysis. The results demonstrated that C-1748 repressed enzymatic activity, the protein level and the expression of CYP3A4 enzyme what distinguished this compound from C-1305 which induced CYP3A4 activity. These findings indicate that the effect of C-1748 and C-1305 on CYP3A4 activity might be mediated by different mechanism of their metabolic pathway. The metabolic reprogramming of cells exposed to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) is being widely studied due to its important implication in many pathophysiological conditions. Mitochondria are oxygen sensors. Changes of the mitochondrial biochemistry due to reduced oxygen levels are essential to induce cells adaptation. However, the critical step of the mechanism underlying the association of oxygen level reduction with stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) is still object of investigation. Indeed, hypoxia induces changes of mitochondrial morphology, dynamics, and metabolism, and in particular it can induce mitochondria to release reactive oxygen species (ROS), but whether this plays a major role in the activation of the cellular adaptation mechanism is still a matter of discussion [1, 2] . Therefore we designed a study to evaluate the hypothesis that the hypoxiainduced reprogramming of mitochondria might be impaired when cells are exposed to prolonged hypoxia under various metabolic conditions induced by different energy substrates. We used primary human cells cultured for 24, 48 and 72 hours in media containing variable glucose concentrations and we exposed the cells to different oxygen tensions from physiological to moderate hypoxia, to mimic conditions occurring in vivo in many aging-related pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and tumors. We confirmed the occurring of significant mitochondrial mass reduction associated with increased HIF-1, which was modulated by glucose availability to the cells, and reduced ROS, as revealed by measuring peroxides with DCFDA [3] . These results will be discussed in relation with the levels and organization of complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The nutrient sensing transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha and the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 are important regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis at the nuclear level. By modulating the transcription of nuclear encoded-mitochondrial proteins they are able to promote mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) expression so executing a pivotal role in the control of mitochondrial homeostasis. We demonstrated that these proteins, until now considered prevalently localized into the nucleus, reside also within mitochondria. Indeed, PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 were found in mitochondria of various cell lines and mice organs as well as in nuclear-free human platelets. Through confocal microscopy analysis and blue native PAGE, an interaction of PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 with mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) was also found. PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 have been detected into purified nucleoids in association with mtDNA. More specifically, by oligo pull down assay we observed the interaction of PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 with the mtTFA binding-site H (mtTFA consensus sequence on the D-loop). By mtDNA immunoprecipitation assay, carried out on mitochondrial extracts, we also observed the association of PGC-1alpha with the D-Loop region.",

Finally, these results point to a more direct function of PGC-1alpha and SIRT1in mitochondrial biogenesis that put these proteins at the center stage of nuclearmitochondrial communications especially upon nutrient or energetic stress conditions.

Obesity-induced adipocyte dysfunction leads to a dysregulation of adipokine secretion, which is related with the impairment of insulin sensitivity. Sexual dimorphism has been described in the development of insulin resistance associated to obesity both in liver and muscle, and given the involvement of WAT in the secretion of adipokines and its role as an insulin dependent organ, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of retroperitoneal WAT in the impairment of the obesity-associated insulin sensitivity induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, as well as to determine whether a sex-dependent response exists. Ten week-old Wistar rats of both genders were fed a control pelleted diet (3% w/w fat) or a HFD (24% w/w fat) for 26 weeks. Serum glucose levels were determined by the Accutrend system, while serum insulin, leptin, resistin and adiponectin levels were measured by ELISA immunoassay. HOMA-IR was calculated. Levels of proteins of the insulin signalling (IRb, IRS1, pAkt/Akt and GLUT4) and adiponectin signalling (AdipoR1 and pAMPK/ AMPK) pathways, as well as CPT1 were determined by Western blot. Adiponectin and PPARc mRNA levels were assayed by real-time PCR. Although HFD induced a decrease in insulin sensitivity of female rats, they did not reach the degree of insulin resistance observed in males, either under control or HFD feeding, which could be related with their higher adiposity index. Moreover, sex differences in the insulin and adiponectin signalling pathways were observed. In conclusion, obese female rats would have a greater WAT expandability capacity as well as enhanced lipogenesis associated to a better insulin sensitivity profile, a picture that is not observed in males.",

Although many studies showed the beneficial effect of dietary oleate there are some reports verifying the negative effects of oleate treatment (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum stress, cardiac disorders). In this study we investigated the effect of long-term feeding of Wistar rats with trioleate rich diet (TO; 36% fat calories). After 11 weeks of feeding the amount of liver diacylglycerols (DAG) and triglyceride (TAG) significantly increased in TO-fed rats when compared with chow-fed rats. It was associated with the substantially elevated level of proteins involved in lipogenesis, i.e. acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), in liver of TOfed rats in comparison with chow-fed rats. Surprisingly, 16 weeks of TO feeding has revealed a decrease in the amount of DAG and TAG almost to values noted in control rats. These changes were associated with strong decline in SCD1, FAS and ACC protein levels. Additionally, the level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, a key enzyme involved in regulation of fatty acid betaoxidation, was substantially increased. Also the transcription factor associated with oxidation, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha, was enhanced in rat liver after 16 weeks of TO feeding. These data show important differences in the effect of TO-rich diet on hepatic lipogenesis and beta-oxidation depending on feeding duration. While, shorter term feeding a TO-rich diet results in progression of lipogenesis, the long-term TO feeding leads to inhibition of lipogenesis and intensification of fat oxidation. Glyphosate is, probably, the most commercialized broad-spectrum herbicide worldwide. People may be exposed to its residues by agricultural practices or along the food chain. With respect to toxicity, harmful effects are described in several models, not only human. Among these effects are: cell cycle modifications, apoptosis and necrosis induction or alternations in gene transcription. We studied glyphosate toxicity in the human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 (androgen independent) and LNCap (androgen dependant). Results in cell proliferation by MTT salts metabolization, show a decrease in cell number up to a 60%, after 3 days of treatment with 50-100 lM glyphosate supplemented medium. Apoptosis induction analysis performed detecting Anexin-V by flow cytometry and valuating Procaspase-3 activation, shows an increase of apoptotic cells referred to control in both lines. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) liberation assays indicate that there are significant levels of necrosis in LNCap line, but not in PC3. A primary study with propidium iodide by flow cytometry, apparently shows cell cycle alterations as well. All these effects, previously mentioned in other models, seem not to be enough to explain the dramatic decrease in cell viability we observed. That's why we studied an indicator of another cell death pathway: autophagy. Results on LC3 protein expression are highly significant, reaching a 200% signal referred to the control, both for 2 and 3 days of treatment, even before changes in apoptosis induction or LDH liberation are seen. The same occurs with acridine orange staining, which shows not only an increase of acid vesicles but also a redistribution of them. Commonly, all the effects are more intense in the androgen dependant cell line, what lead us to suspect that glyphosate has a differential effect between both models, resulting highly cytotoxic for LNCap and mainly Cytostatic in PC3.",

The third group was kept at standard conditions for 14 days in order to control the remission of the disease. Animals of the 4th group were injected with a solution of bioflavonoid quercetin (CYP2E1 inhibitor) in the dose of 5 mg/kg. The 5th group was treated with both quercetin and vitamin C (20 mg/kg) for 14 days. To evaluate the general condition of animals in all groups we determined the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol and glucose levels in blood serum and the CYP2E1 level in the liver. The obtained data showed that after 6 weeks of the experiment animals of the third group have marked symptoms of diabetes such as 1,6-fold increase of glucose serum concentration. Hereby the slight increase in ALT activity and 1,45-fold increase in AST activity are evidences of liver injury. Furthermore the CYP2E1 protein level in the animals liver showed 1,5-fold increase. A significant decrease of these parameters took place in quercetin treated groups, but the greatest effect was observed in the group which was treated with both quercetin and vitamin C. These results indicate a pronounced hepatoprotective effect of quercetin which inhibits cytochrome P450 2E1 and thereby reduces the production of free radicals.",

Pereira-Wilson 1 1 CBMA/ 2 CITAB -Department of Biology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with elevated triglycerides (TG) and LDL levels and decreased HDL levels, a pattern also recognized as dyslipidemia. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic dyslipidemia are not completely understood, this lipoprotein pattern is associated with T2DM and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Accumulation of fatty acids and lipid metabolites can inhibit insulin signaling pathway, leading to insulin resistant conditions. In a previous study, we reported the effect of Salvia officinalis tea in improving lipid profile in healthy female volunteers that constitute a risk to develop T2DM [1] . We also verified that the food constituents ursolic acid (UA) and luteolin-7-glucoside (L7G) had effects on plasma glucose and lipid profile improvement, whereas UA also showed increased liver glycogen deposition and plasma HDL levels [2] . The present study aims to characterize the effects of natural compounds in lipid profile and metabolism of rat hepatocytes. Studies are underway to evaluate the in vitro effect of these compounds in lipid synthesis and/or degradation. Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) is a rare form of diabetes characterized mainly by maternal inheritance of diabetes, hearing loss and macular dystrophy and is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The most frequent point mutation associated with MIDD is 3243A > G in the tRNALeu (UUR) gene, that causes an altered ATP production and thereby impairs the glucose-induced insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to search potentially diabetogenic mtDNA variants in a pediatric cohort from Southern Italy with suspected MIDD. We screened, by sequencing, the entire mtDNA, extracted from blood and buccal mucosa of MIDD patients (n = 11), of their mothers and of healthy control subjects (n = 80). We identified a total of 416 variants, among which 325 variants were detected only in controls, 58 variants were present both in controls and cases and 33 variants (4/33 novel) were present only in cases and their mothers. Among the variants detected only in patients, 22/33 were in the coding region (50% were synonymous and 50% caused an amino acid change). Only in one patient we found the 3243A > G variant. Because most patients (91%), and their mothers were mutated in complex I and/or IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we measured by spectrophotometric assay, the enzymatic activities of these two complexes in lymphocytes of both patients and their mothers. We found that these enzymes were less active in mutated patients and their mothers than in the healthy control pool. Furthermore we observed a much lower prevalence of hearing loss (36% versus 75-98%) and macular dystrophy (54% versus 86%) in our mitochondrial diabetic children than reported in adults. In conclusion our study support that the entire mtDNA should be studied in children with suspected MIDD and that the enzyme evaluation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes is a reliable method to assess the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with mitochondrial diabetes. LVVYPW is a member of hemorphins family, an endogenous non-classical opioid peptides derived from hemoglobin and demonstrated a wide spread of biological activity by affecting different receptors function. Recently, we have revealed the blood glucose-lowering effect of LVVYPW in streptozotocin (STZ)induced diabetic rats. Earlier it has been found that calcineurin is a key enzyme involved in the molecular mechanisms of hemorphins action in the brain and immune system. Because of functional interactions of calcineurin with serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and NMDA glutamate receptors, the aims of present work were to study the possible participation of mentioned receptors in anti-diabetic effect of LVVYPW. For that purpose STZinduced diabetic rats (male, Wistar line, weighing 180-220 g) received the intraperitoneal (ip) pretreatment with either selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 mg/kg) or NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) 30 minutes before ip administration of LVVYPW (1 mg/kg). It has been shown that pretreatment of diabetic rats with ketanserin completely abolished the blood glucose-lowering effect of hemorphin, while pretreatment of diabetic rats with MK-801 only partially inhibited (by 22.5%) blood glucose-lowering effect of hemorphin alone (by 36.5%) respectively. Thus, data obtained demonstrated that serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, as well as NMDA glutamate receptors are involved in molecular mechanisms of anti-diabetic effect of LVVYPW. These findings support the view that molecular mechanisms of anti-diabetic effect of LVVYPW are complex processes, which involve the integration of different receptors function with Ca 2+ /calmodulin/calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) behaves as an endogenous pro-inflammatory hormone in humans. ABA is released by activated inflammatory cells and stimulates several functional activities. ABA release is also induced in pancreatic beta cells after glucose administration and nanomolar ABA stimulates glucose-dependent and -independent insulin release. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ABA in the human adipose tissue (AT). Incubation of abdominal AT fragments from human biopsies with IL-8 or LPS for 24 hours induced a 1.5-to 8-fold increase of ABA content, respectively.",

Indeed, adipocytes differentiated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSC), as well as AT fragments, incubated for 2 hours with 25 mM glucose, released ABA in the culture supernatants (3fold over controls). Furthermore, ABA stimulated several responses in AT, in ATMSC and in 3T3L1 murine pre-adipocytes. In AT cultured for 24 hours with 10 lM ABA the release of RANTES, MCP-1, IL-1b, -4, -6 and -10 was significantly stimulated over controls. Besides, ATMSC differentiated in the presence of ABA showed a significantly increased expression of adipocyte markers, namely PPARc, adiponectin and aP2, during the first days of the differentiation protocol. Finally, 3T3L1 cells showed an increased lipid accumulation after differentiation in the presence of ABA, as well as an increased triglyceride synthesis after standard differentiation and further incubation for 24 hours in the presence of ABA, or of ABA plus insulin, as compared to controls. In conclusion these data indicate the occurrence in adipose tissue of autocrine mechanisms involving ABA as an endogenous hormone affecting both functional responses and differentiation. Glyoxalase-1 enzyme (GLO-1; EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of reactive glucose metabolites to non-toxic products as a part of cellular defense system against glycation. Altered GLO-1 activity and expression is associated with the development of late diabetic complications, oxidative stress-and aging-related diseases. The activity of GLO-1 is conveniently measured in the lysates of red blood cells; although the leukocyte subpopulations are known to change their expression patterns of inflammatory mediators in response to glycation stress-related conditions. The aim of the study was to develop an experimental set-up for measurements of GLO-1 in leukocytes and apply it to investigate the regulation of GLO-1 expression and activity in diabetic patient samples. The flow cytometry method was used for GLO-1 detection in human leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples to investigate the GLO-1 expression in diabetes mellitus patients (n = 11) and healthy subjects (n = 8). The analysis of GLO-1 in leukocytes showed that the expression index of GLO-1-positive cells was slightly increased in mononuclear leukocytes from diabetic patients. This result correlated with the increase in GLO-1 activity in the whole blood samples of type 2 diabetes patients. GLO-1 activity was also determined in whole blood samples of type 1 (n = 108) and type 2 (n = 109) diabetes patients and age matched control group (n = 132). The average GLO-1 activity in the control blood samples was 30 \u00b1 1 U/g haemoglobin. In type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus patients the GLO-1 activity was elevated by 7% and 10%, respectively, compared to control group and it negatively correlated to the severity of diabetic neuropathy.",

            "text": "Excess of glycogen accumulation in the liver and increased endogenous glucose production (EGP), predominantly from the liver, are characteristic features of diabetic type 2 patients. Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are the pathways that significantly contribute to increasing EGP in diabetes. Fructose-1,6bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a highly regulated enzyme in the anabolic pathway and is also related to indirect glycogen synthesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate and related three-and four carbon compounds to glucose-6-phosphate which is subsequently converted to glucose or funneled to glycogen. Here, we studied the contribution of FBPase to liver glycogen accumulation. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were used as a liver model. The strategies to modulate the activity of this enzyme were as follows: overexpression of human liver FBPase (hFBP1) by adenoviral transduction, and inhibition of its enzymatic activity using a specific inhibitor (Calbiochem). As precursors in glycogen synthesis, 25 mM glucose or 10 mM dihydroxy-acetone (DHA) were used. The overexpression of hFBP1 by adenoviral transduction was achieved, but no changes in glycogen accumulation or EGP were observed. In contrast, the specific FBPase inhibitor had a dosedependent decrease on glycogen accumulation. However, the inhibitor caused adverse effects on hepatocytes. Plausible explanations for our findings are: (i) the regulation of FBPase activity in vivo is highly efficient, with no significant increases in the deposition of glycogen even when the enzyme is overexpressed; and (ii) endogenous FBPase is sufficient to supply the G-6-P required for hepatocyte metabolism. Introduction: Cyt-b5 is a ubiquitous electron transfer hemoprotein known to augment the activity of various cytochromes P450, including the lyase activity of cytochrome P450 17a-hydroxlase/ 17,20 lyase (CYP17) in the adrenal gland. During adrenal steroidogenesis, the activity of bHSD and CYP17 are critical in determining the flow of steroid intermediates through the steroidogenic pathway as both enzymes compete for the same D5 steroid intermediates. The augmentation of CYP17 activity by Cyt-b5 has been shown to significantly alter the steroidogenic output of the adrenal gland. However, to date, no data is available describing the potential influence of Cyt-b5 on non-P450 steroidogenic enzymes, specifically 3bHSD. Therefore, this study investigated the potential influence of Cyt-b5 on 3bHSD activity during adrenal steroidogenesis.",

Results: A significant (p < 0.05) increase was observed in the activity of both Angora and ovine 3bHSD towards all three steroid substrates in a substrate and species specific manner. Furthermore, kinetic studies revealed Cyt-b5 to have no influence on the Km values whilst increasing the Vmax values of ovine 3bHSD towards its respective steroid substrates. In addition, 3bHSD activity in ovine adrenal microsomes towards pregnenolone was also shown to be significantly (p < 0.001) increased by the addition of purified Cyt-b5 with maximum stimulation being observed at a ratio of 1 : 10 (endogenous b5:added b5).",

Flavonoids exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including the modulation of adrenal steroidogenic enzymes, thus influencing steroidogenesis. Aspalathus linearis (Rooibos), a dietary source rich in flavonoids, was investigated to determine the influence on glucocorticoid biosynthesis. The influence of Rooibos on P450 17a-hydroxylase (CYP17), P450 21-hydroxylase (CYP21), P450 11b-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II (3bHSD) was determined in COS1 cells. The outcome of steroid metabolism was also determined in H295R cells in the presence of Rooibos. Plasma cortisol (F) levels were investigated in human subjects consuming Rooibos and in Wistar rats to determine the influence of Rooibos on corticosterone (CORT) production. The inhibition of CYP17, CYP21 and 3bHSD was significant (p < 0.001) while the inhibition of CYP11B1 was negligible. Aspalathin, a flavonoid compound unique to Rooibos, inhibited CYP21 and 3bHSD (p < 0.001) significantly with markedly less inhibition of CYP17. In H295R cells, pregnenolone metabolism was inhibited by Rooibos (p < 0.001) while aspalathin inhibited CORT (p < 0.05) and deoxycortisol (S) and increased androstenedione production. In vivo studies showed male serum F levels remaining unchanged together with increased testosterone levels while females showed a downward trend in F levels and increased dehydroepiandrostenedione sulphate levels. CORT concentrations in rats receiving Rooibos were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Both studies showed in the inactivation of the respective glucocorticoids to be increased, resulting in a marked decrease in the CORT:11-dehydroCORT and F:cortisone (E) ratios. Rooibos influences the flux within the adrenal steroidogenic pathways and the outcome of steroidogenesis. Preliminary investigations into the interconversion of F and E showed that Rooibos favours the production of the inactive metabolite, indicating possible clinical applications in hypertension and metabolic syndrome.",

In this study, we want to establish if Erg7p and Erg27p interact also in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals. S. pombe ERG7 was overexpressed in an erg7/erg27 S. cerevisiae strain. OSC functionality of recombinant strain was tested by cell culture incubation with [14C] acetate and incubation of homogenates with [14C] oxidosqualene. The accumulation of 3-ketosteroids and the full enzymatic activity of OSC indicate that in S. pombe Erg27p doesn't protect Erg7p. As a model to study the interaction in mammals, we used a cholesterol requiring murine myeloma cell line (NS0), deficient in the 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd17b7), the ortologue of the yeast steroid-3-ketoreductase. Tracer experiments with intact NS0 cells followed by lipid analysis showed that OSC is fully active in these mammalian cells, suggesting that in mammals the ketosteroid reductase is not required for OSC activity.",

The full enzymatic functionality of mammalian Hsd17b7 expressed in S. cerevisiae along with an only negligible OSC activity point to the inability of the mammalian 3-ketoreductase to retain secondary function of assisting OSC activity in S. cerevisiae.

Hypercatabolic syndrome is a biochemical state characterized by increased inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-a) and catabolic hormone levels. Anabolic effects of insulin have also decreased. Diabetes mellitus is a hypercatabolic disease and one of the most important metabolic consequences of it is muscle protein breakdown. In this study, we intend to create a hypercatabolic state by applying high concentration of glucose and TNF-a to the differentiated skeletal muscle cells. Rat myoblasts were grown in DMEM including 10% FBS, and 5 mM glucose. For differentiation into myotubes, the serum content was reduced to 2%. When the cells were differentiated, they were incubated in mediums with different concentrations of glucose (5-50 mM) and TNF-a (0-200 ng/ml) for various incubation times. Cell viability was assessed by measuring the LDH that was released to the medium. Proteasomal activities (chymotrypsin, trypsin and caspase-like activities) and Western blot of the beta 5 and C2 subunits of proteasomes and NFKB have been analysed. In high glucose treatment, the proteasomal activities and protein expressions have reached to the highest level at 25 mM glucose and these increments were time dependent (24, 48 and 72 hours). When L6 cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-a C2 protein expression was reached to the max level at 10 ng/ml. While trypsin-like activity reached to the highest level at 10 ng/ml, chymotrypsin-like activity was at 50 ng/ml. These increments were more marked at 12 and 24 hours incubation time rather than 6 hours. Moreover, both TNF-a and glucose increased nuclear translocation of NFKB in time dependent manner. In conclusion, both the two components of hypercatabolic syndrome, hyperglycemia and high TNF-a levels may explain increased proteasomal activity which leads to the muscle wasting observed in diabetic patients.

            "text": "Expression and regulation of muscle glycogen synthase in testis: disruption of seminiferous tubules by glycogen overproduction Glycogen is the main source of glucose to many biological events; however this molecule could have other functions, including deleterious effects on cells. The rate-limiting enzyme in the glycogen synthesis is glycogen synthase (GS) encoded by two genes, GYS1, expressed in muscle (muscle glycogen synthase, MGS) and other tissues, and GYS2, primarily expressed in liver (liver glycogen synthase, LGS). The expression of GS and its activity have been widely studied in many tissues. To date, it is not clear which GS isoform is responsible of glycogen synthesis and the role of glycogen in testis. By RT-PCR, Western-blot and immunofluorescence, we have detected the expression of MGS and not LGS in mice testis during its development. Additionally, we have evaluated, both, GS activity and glycogen storage at different days after birth, and our results showed higher levels during the first days of development. We have also demonstrated by RT-PCR and immunoblot the expression of malin and laforin in testis, clue enzymes in the regulation of GS activity in Lafora disease. These proteins formed an active complex able to regulate MGS by poly-ubiquitination, both, in Sertoli and male germ cell lines. Using a knock-in mouse expressing MGS that is not regulated by phosphorylation (superactive-form), we evaluated the role of glycogen in testis development and spermatogenesis. Our results showed that glycogen overproduction induced degeneration of seminiferous tubules and an increase in physiological apoptosis rate versus wild-type mice, measured by immunodetection of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL assay. These findings suggest a strong regulation of GS activity in testis and a fine equilibrium between glycogen homeostasis and testis development and spermatogenesis, implying that its loss could be responsible of the disruption of seminiferous tubules and probable cause of infertility. In adults, high serum levels of uric acid and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity have been associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The relation of serum uric acid level and GGT activity with obesity and atherosclerosis has not been elucidated in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to find associations of the two cardiovascular risk factors (hyperuricemia and high GGT activity) with obesity parameters in overweight children. A total of 50 obese children of school age and 50 healthy children and adolescents with normal weight were enrolled. Serum carbohydrate and lipid profile and associations with uric acid and GGT activity were determined. The obese children answered a diet history questionnaire. The investigated parameters had increased levels in obese children versus control. Serum uric acid level and GGT activity were associated with anthropometric indices, glycaemia, HbA1c, fasting C peptide, total cholesterol, ALT activity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and atherogenic index with r values between 0.35 and 0.82, for p < 0.05. Uric acid was correlated with serum triglycerides (r = 0.52, p < 0.05) and carotid intima-media thickness (r = 0.35, p < 0.05), while GGT activity was related with LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.30, p<0.05). The intake of fructose was positively associated with triglycerides level. In conclusion, in overweight children, serum uric acid and GGT activity have the strongest associations with waist circumference and insulin resistance. The association between triglycerides and uric acid is explained by a diet rich in fructose. The link between GGT activity and atherosclerosis is high LDL-cholesterol level. In diabetic conditions, kidney largely contributes to hyperglycemia by enhanced endogenous glucose production. Two key gluconeogenic enzymes that are specifically expressed in the proximal tubule from normal kidney are phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). Using long-term (8 months) streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, we demonstrated a correlation between the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and anatomo-pathological alterations in the kidneys. The level of FBPase protein expression was unchanged while PEPCK was over-expressed in the diabetic kidney. Nevertheless, both FBPase and PEPCK activities were up-regulated in long-term DN. Interestingly, FBPase cellular distribution was homogenous throughout the proximal tubules of the renal cortex, whereas PEPCK presented a gradient of expression decreasing from the external cortex to the medulla. The exclusive expression of FBPase and PEPCK in proximal tubules was not changed between control and diabetic kidney, but some changes in subcellular localization were observed. The maintained expression of both enzymes in proximal tubules of diabetic kidney indicates that this is still the main cell type responsible for gluconeogenesis in diabetic conditions. The analysis of tubular damage using the profibrotic adhesion molecule, osteopontin (OPN), indicated that segment 2 of proximal tubules is the early affected zone. Notably, co-localization analysis demonstrated that this segment expresses higher PEPCK levels. We suggest that segment 2 of the proximal tubule has a higher gluconeogenic activity, inducing cell alterations by glucotoxicity in the long-term diabetic kidney. DID UACh, FONDECYT 1090694. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and is intimately associated with hyperlipidemia as well as hyperleptinemia due to leptin resistance. The lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor LSR is a hepatic receptor for triglyceride (TG)rich lipoproteins that may be involved in the dynamics of lipid distribution between the liver and peripheral tissues. Here, we sought to determine the potential regulatory role of leptin on this receptor. At physiological concentrations (1-10 ng/mL), leptin increased LSR protein and mRNA in Hepa1-6 cells through an Erk1/2-dependent and a-amanitin-sensitive pathway. Leptin treatment of C57Bl6/Rj mice (1 lg twice daily, 8 days) led to a significant increase in hepatic LSR mRNA and protein, decreased liver TG and increased VLDL secretion as compared to control animals, showing that leptin is an important peripheral regulator of LSR protein levels providing the means for the control of hepatic uptake of lipids during the postprandial phase. LSR+/) mice have elevated postprandial lipemia, and when placed on a high-fat (60% kcal) diet, female LSR+/ )exhibited accelerated weight gain and increased fat mass as compared to LSR+/+. In these mice, hepatic leptin receptor protein levels and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 were significantly reduced, while plasma leptin levels were increased (3fold). Furthermore, male LSR+/) on a normal diet displayed a significant weight gain (11.8%, p < 0.025) as compared to controls with age, but a disproportionate increase in plasma leptin (>3fold, p < 0.004) without changes in food intake. Incubation of Hepa1-6 cells with very high leptin levels (50-100 ng/ml) led to a marked reduction (60-75%) of LSR protein and mRNA levels. These data suggest that peripheral leptin resistance results in decreased mobilization of hepatic LSR protein by this adipokine, thereby disrupting efficient hepatic removal of lipoproteins during the postprandial phase, leading to hyperlipidemia often observed in obesity. Myristic acid is a saturated fatty acid found and widely distributed among plant and animal fat. Myristic acid, as a key compo-nent of a typical, high saturated fat Western diet, has been associated in both animals and humans, with an increased incidence of several chronic, debilitating conditions, such as obesity, cancer, coronary artery disease and diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate plasma myristic acid levels of obese and non-obese Turkish subjects This study was performed on 105 (22M, 83F) obese people aged 18-70 years and 80(20M, 60F) control subjects aged 18-70 years. There were no complaints and symptoms of the obese people other than obesity. Body mass index (BMI) was used as an obesity criteria. BMI of the obese subjects was more than 35 kg/m 2 and that of healthy controls was less than 25 kg/m 2 . Plasma myristic acid levels were measured by GS-MS technique. Plasma myristic acid levels of the obese and the control subjects were found as 0.70 \u00b1 0.34 mg/l and 0.52 \u00b1 0.25 mg/l, respectively the difference of which was statistically significant (p < 0.05).",

Epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed that exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light can induce cataractogenesis. We determined gene expression changes in human lens epithelial (HLE) cells in response to UVB exposure. SV40 Tantigen-transformed HLE cells (SRA01/04) were irradiated at 30 mJ/cm 2 and total RNAs at 12 and 24 hours after UVB exposure were examined for global gene expression changes using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array. Emphasis was placed on genes encoding extracellular proteins, especially growth factors and cytokines. A total of 18 secreted protein genes were up-regulated more than twofold at either or both time points. Amphiregulin (AREG), a member of the EGF family and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a divergent member of the TGF b superfamily were chosen because of their higher up-regulation and novelty. AREG and GDF15 mRNA levels were also significantly up-regulated in UVB-irradiated primary cultured HLE cells prepared from surgically removed lens epithelium. AREG and GDF15 protein levels assayed by ELISA in conditioned media of SRA01/04 cells increased at 24 hours after UVB exposure, while they were scarcely detectable at 12 hours. Recombinant AREG significantly stimulated 3H-thymidine and 3H-leucine uptake in SRA01/04 cells as did a positive control EGF. Recombinant GDF15 did not stimulate 3H-thymidine incorporation at any concentration tested, but significantly stimulated 3H-leucine uptake. Primary cultured HLE and SRA01/04 cells expressed both EGF receptor and TGF b receptor mRNAs. These results indicate that AREG and GDF15 produced in response to UVB exposure can affect the growth and protein synthesis of lens epithelial cells, suggesting that they have autocrine and paracrine roles related to pathological changes of lens tissue during long-term UVB exposure (Molecular Vision 2011; 17: 159-169). The inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is currently assayed as a mechanism to improve glycemic control in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. Procyanidins derived from grape seed (GSPE) can ameliorate some hyperglycaemic situations, but their mechanisms of action are not clearly understood. In the present study, we evaluate their effects on intestinal DPP4 activity and expression and on incretin effect. We measured DPP4 activity by colorimetric determination of product formation (H-Gly-Pro-pNA, 0.2 mM, Bachem) and DPP4 genic expression by real time RT-PCR in different situations. CaCo2 cells were used to evaluate the chronic effects of GSPE on human intestinal DPP4. It was found that 10 and 100 mg GSPE/L inhibit DPP4 activity, and 100 mg GSPE/L treatment also repressed DPP4 genic expression. In vivo effects of chronic (25 mg GSPE/kg bw for 45 days) and acute (1 g GSPE/ kg bw for 1 hour) GSPE treatments on intestinal DPP4 were also analysed on Wistar rats. Both treatments decreased DPP4 activity and gene expression. Finally, incretin effect was evaluated by OGTT and IPGTT in healthy rats after 19 days of chronic treatment with 25 mg GSPE/kg bw and an improvement on glucose curve was observed in OGTT, but not in IPGTT.",

Procyanidin extract also produces incretin effect, which could in part explain the GSPE effects on glucose homeostasis. These results therefore, suggest that the inverse correlation existing between lumican expression and Saos 2 cell adhesion is dependent on active TGF-b2 signaling. Moreover, the significant increase in Smad 2 activation present in lumican-deficient cells (p \u00a3 0.01) was annulled in the presence of the anti-TGF-b2 peptide, demonstrating that lumican is an upstream regulator of the TGF-b2 / Smad 2 signaling cascade. Our data demonstrate the existence of a novel out-in signalling circuit in human osteosarcoma cells. In conclusion the secreted to extracellular matrix lumican is shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of TGF-b2 activity. Nucleostemin (NS) is implicated in the control of stem and cancer cell proliferation. The protein encoded by NS is abundantly expressed in proliferating stem cells in an early multipotential state, but it is abruptly and almost entirely disappears at the start of differentiation. The fact that NS is expressed in stem cells and several cancer cell lines, but not in terminally differentiated cells of adult tissues, suggests a potential role for NS in maintaining self-renewal/ proliferation of stem and cancer cells.

Fresh tissue biopsies were obtained from patients whom had been hospitalized in Ankara University Hospital. The samples were obtained from 20 patients with GBM. RNA isolation was performed with TRI-Reagent kit. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. GAPDH expression was used as an internal control. QRT-PCR analysis showed that NS is 2-4 times under expressed in GBM tumours compared to pooled RNA sample perpetrated from normal glial tissue samples. Their peculiar capacity to rapidly produce, upon activation, both Th1 and Th2-specific cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-c and interleukin (IL)-4, provides iNKT cells with the ability to link the innate and adaptive immune responses. Various iNKT cell alterations have been reported in cancer patients [1] , but no data are available on the iNKT cells in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a rare tumor of the mesothelium strongly related to asbestos exposure [2] . The aims of our work were to analyze the frequency and the subset ratio of iNKT cells in MPM patients, compared to healthy volunteers. We analyzed (by FACSVantage-SE) the cell surface expressions of CD3, CD4, CD8 and Va24Vb11 (specific iNKT cell markers) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MPM patients and healthy volunteers, and, then, the intracellular expression of IFN-c and IL-4 cytokines after PMA/ionomycin stimulation in the presence of IL-2 and brefeldin. We found, in MPM patients in comparison to healthy controls, a significant increase in the frequency of iNKT cells (0.0388% versus 0.0139%, p = 0.0013); skewed subsets of circulating iNKT cells with a low frequency of circulating . The development of more aggressive tumors in Stat3C/MMTV-NeuT mice correlates with an increased migratory and invasive ability of tumor-derived cells, which display disrupted distribution of cell junction markers and increased in vivo metastatic potential. We found some genes upregulated in STAT3C expressing cells: Twist1, a well-known STAT3 transcriptional target, Lgals3, Lypd3 and Cten. All these genes have been shown to play a role in regulating cell migration and/or tumor metastasis. In particular we could show that Cten, known to be required for EGF-induced cell migration, is a novel Stat3 target that plays an important role in mediating the aggressive phenotype of Stat3C cells.",

CoPP was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of imatinib while SnMPP restored the cytotoxicity. Interestingly, neither bilirubin nor CO (using the CO-releasing agent CORM-3) were able to protect K562 cells from imatinib-induced toxicity. The protective effect of CoPP was mitigated by addition of a protease inhibitor (Ed64), which was able to stop HO-1 nuclear translocation. We also analyzed 96 kinase genes and found that addition of CoPP in combination with imatinib leads to at least seven kinases being significantly increased while the expression of these genes was reduced in cells treated with imatinib alone or in the presence of SnMP. All of them are able to activate mitogenic signals. We also found that 1 lM imatinib was able to increase the formation of cellular reactive oxygen species and this effect was inhibited by CoPP and restored in presence of SnMP. In conclusion, the protective effect of HO-1 on imatinib-induced cytotoxicity does not involve the action of its catabolites, but rather a translocation of HO-1 to the nucleus after proteolytic cleavage. Migration to the nucleus activates several kinases able to induce mitogenic signals thus enabling HO-1 to reduce oxidative stress induced by imatinib.",

Carcinogenesis is a multi-step genetic process that involves mutational activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation/silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Identification of genes causally related to the neoplastic process is essential for elucidating signaling pathways in oncogenesis. Human chromosome arm 3p is often affected in various epithelial tumors, and several tumor suppressor genes were recently identified in this region. The most affected is 3p21 region that is 50-100% rearranged in more than 30 types of malignancies, mostly in epithelial cancers. Previously we have identified a novel region, frequently affected in BC, RCC, NSCLC and EOC was localized between markers D3S2409 and D3S3667 in the 3p21.3. The aim of our research was to perform the detailed analysis of 3p (especially 3p21 region) to discover novel potential oncogenes and/or tumor suppressors. Cancer cells exhibit aberrant metabolism, which allows a more efficient production of biomass and hence tumour growth and progression. However, the genetic cues modulating this metabolic switch remain largely undetermined. Here we identify a metabolic function for PML, which uncovers an unexpected pro-survival activity for this paradigmatic tumour suppressor in breast cancer. We find that PML functions as a key promoter of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which mechanistically stems from the regulation of PGC1A acetylation, and the consequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling. We show that through FAO enhancement, PML promotes ATP production, inhibits anoikis and allows luminal filling in 3D basement membrane breast culture models. Furthermore, analysis of breast cancer biopsies reveals that PML is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers, which is enriched in triple negative cases. Indeed, PML expression in breast cancer strikingly correlates with time to recurrence and a gene signature of poor prognosis. These findings have important therapeutic implications, as PML and its key role in FAO metabolism are amenable to pharmacological suppression towards cancer treatment. A number of studies have indicated that tumorigenesis is associated with several metabolic alterations that actively participate to the onset and maintenance of transformed phenotype. To identify and characterize the specific metabolic alterations able to promote growth of K-ras transformed tumor cells as compared to their normal counterparts, we show herein integrative results of an analysis performed by high-throughput techniques, transcriptomics and metabolomics, upon alterations in nutrient availability.",

Stable isotope labeled glucose and glutamine tracers and computational determination of intracellular fluxes indicate enhanced glycolytic activity, decreased oxidative flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and an increased dependence on glutamine for anabolic synthesis. Notable, a non-canonical labeling of TCA cycle associated metabolites (for instance aspartate) is detected in both transformed cells lines. MFA data strongly correlate with gene expression profiling, as cells expressing oncogenic K-ras exhibited elevated expression of glycolytic, glutamine utilization and nucleotides synthesis genes as well as a deregulation of several TCA cycle related genes expression. Besides, specific inhibition of some glutamine metabolic pathways, further indicates glutamine as a necessary substrate to generate cellular metabolic precursors.

Here, we tested the effects of CoQ10 on angiogenesis stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). CoQ10 significantly inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis in a mouse Matrigel plug and the sprouting of endothelial cells in rat aortic rings. In addition, CoQ10 decreased the ability of tube forma-tion, migration, and invasion in endothelial cells. When CoQ10 was used to inhibit angiogenesis in endothelial cells, the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the phosphorylation of ERK were decreased.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids are major components of phospholipids, the principal structural unit of biological membranes. Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double-bonds in a cis or trans configuration. Trans isomers are able to perturb both cell membrane arrangement and lipid enzymatic cascades. Endogenous trans fatty acid isomers are relative to the isomerization of fatty acids in cell membranes due to an endogenous free radical process. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to the oxidative degradation of lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage. Cell membranes, which are structurally made up of large amounts of PUFA, are highly susceptible to oxidative attack and, consequent changes result in altered membrane fluidity, permeability, and cellular metabolic dysfunction.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements are frequent in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. The t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocation fuses the 5\u00a2 portion of MLL to the 3\u00a2 portion of AF4 and leads to the synthesis of the chimeric oncoprotein, MLL-AF4. It misregulates the expression of the MLL target genes that are implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation (HOXA9, MEIS1, p27kip1) [1] . Indeed, the MLL-AF4-driven transactivation crucially depends on epigenetic modifications, e.g. H3-K79 methylation (1). However, there is also evidence that MLL-AF4 oncogenic pathways could involve some receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [2] . We previously demonstrated that, in HEK293 cells, both recombinant AF4 (Flag-AF4) and MLL-AF4 (Flag-MLL-AF4) interact with Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) [3] . We studied this interaction further and demonstrated that it occurs in the nucleus, where both partners localize. We also confirmed that FGFR2 interacts directly with endogenous MLL-AF4 chimera in the RS4;11 acute leukemia cells. Lastly, in HEK293 cells stably transfected with MLL-AF4, silencing of FGFR2 reduced HOXA9 transcript level. Our data strongly suggest that the oncogenic potential of MLL-AF4 chimera crucially depends on its nuclear interaction with FGFR2. It is well know that metabolic reprogramming represents a tumor phenotype hallmark to escape apoptosis. Nowadays, Warburg's hypothesis has been challenged by a growing number of studies showing that mitochondria in tumor cells are not inactive per se, but operate a low capacity, confirming that OXPHOS are repressed in some tumor, rather than impaired. Thus, the activation of mitochondrial pathways and the reversion of the cellular energy metabolism to the phenotype characteristic of non-malignant cells have been suggested as an intriguing basis for the optimization of the antitumor strategies. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was cultivated in presence of different concentration of glucose with the aim to explain the ''positive'' mitochondrial plasticity (aglycemia condition) in terms of mitochondrial biogenesis, function and structure, and the ''negative'' adaptation to hyperglycemia. Western blot analysis of the expression level of PCG1a and citrate synthase activity revealed that the absence of glucose caused a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, an increase of the oxidative capacity was documented by high resolution respirometry, demonstrating that OXPHOS could be used as an alternative energy pathway when glycolysis was limited. In addition we documented an increase in expression level of b subunit of ATP synthase even if its supramolecular organization analyzed by BN-PAGE didn't change.",

Inversely, the addition to GEM of genipin, a highly selective inhibitor of UCP-2, synergistically inhibits proliferation of cancer cell lines. This effect is mediated by a strong induction of mitochondrial superoxide and apoptosis, which was analyzed by annexinV binding, caspase-3 and -7 activity, and PARP cleavage. The radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine strongly prevents superoxide generation, apoptosis, and cell growth inhibition by GEM/genipin. Similar data were obtained by over-expressing manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), indicating that mitochondrial oxidative stress plays a key role in the synergistic cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by GEM/genipin combination. In normal primary fibroblasts, the combined treatment induces a very low induction of superoxide ion, apoptosis, and cell growth inhibition, as compared to cancer cells, probably because of a low UCP-2 function, which is instead particularly high in cancer cells to maintain reactive oxygen species within tolerable limits. These data encourage us to develop in vivo studies aimed to enhance GEM response by UCP-2 inhibition.

It plays a key role in ribogenesis, centrosome duplication, cell cycle control and response to stress stimuli. These multiple activities depend on its modular organization. The C-terminal domain is responsible for nucleic acid binding, while the N-termi-nal domain has chaperone activity and binds a variety of proteins, including the tumor suppressors p14arf and Fbw7c. The NPM1 gene is the most frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), accounting for 35% of cases. The over 40 mutations which have been identified to date are all localized in the C-terminal domain of the protein and their structural consequences are similar. The reading frame is altered, due to duplication of short base sequences, thus leading to a protein that: (i) has lost its nucleolar localization signal, (ii) has acquired a newly formed nuclear export signal and (iii) is largely destabilized or totally unfolded in its C-terminal domain. Taken together, these variations account for the aberrant and stable cytoplasmic localization of mutated NPM1.",

Casado Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia -CSIC Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a key regulatory step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, which are implicated in cell homeostatic processes and play an important role in the onset of inflammation, mitogenic responses and cancer. COX-2 is expressed and induced by different stimuli in several tissues and cellular types. COX-2 expression in liver is restricted to those situations in which proliferation or dedifferentiation occurs. Previous reports suggest that COX-2 signaling is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although COX-2 expression is elevated in the early stages of HCC, there is an inverse correlation between COX-2 expression and the differentiation grade of HCC. Moreover, our preliminary results reported that COX-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the adjacent liver than in HCC. Epigenetic modifications of genomic DNA underlie regulation of all genome functions, including gene expression, DNA replication and genome stability. Particularly, CpG islands methylation is associated with suppression of gene expression. Promoter hypermethylation transcriptionally silences COX-2 in HCC cells showing that epigenetic alteration of COX-2, at least in part, modulates the growth of HCC cells. In order to determine the implication of epigenetic events in liver cancer progression we studied the CpG island methylation on COX-2 gene by pyrosequencing in several human HCC samples. We have performed the study including DNA obtained from non-tumor and tumor cells of each patient biopsy. The results allow a detailed analysis of the correlation between the CpG methylation status, the COX-2 mRNA expression and the histological classification of HCC. The human AF4 gene is involved in the t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocation that causes acute lymphoblastic leukemia [1] . AF4 is a transcriptional activator implicated in early lymphoid development. It is a crucial component of a nuclear protein complex that promotes transcription elongation and chromatin remodeling [1, 2] . Noteworthy, AF4 function is regulated by phosphorylation and its cellular levels by proteasomal degradation [3] .",

Methods: Thirty-nine primary sporadic non-ampullary adenocarcinomas of the small intestine were analyzed. We investigated the protein expression of b-catenin by immunohistochemistry, microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 18q by fragment analysis and the mutational status of K-Ras and TP53 by direct sequencing. Results: Nuclear and citoplasmic b-catenin over-expression was found in 9 cases (23.6%). MSI was found in 9 cases (23.6%).

Targeting the kinase activity of this receptor by lapatinib (Tykerb\u00d2, GW-572016) has shown encouraging therapeutic benefits for HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, the development of acquired resistance after several months of treatment limits the therapeutic efficacy of lapatinib. HER2-negative cells in the HER2-heterogeneous tumor have been proposed to escape from lapatinib inhibition and develop the recurrent tumor. Our previous study further suggests that selection with lapatinib renders HER2-negative cells more metastatic via increasing EGFR and COX-2 expressions. However, the molecular mechanism for the induction of EGFR/COX-2 expression in response to lapatinib remains unclear. Here, we showed that up-regulation of histone deacetylases (HDAC) 3 and 7, accompanying with the deacetylation of histone H3K9 and H2BK5, were found in lapatinibselected cells. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors SAHA and TSA obviously attenuated the lapatinib-induced migration and invasion of HER2-negative cells and induced more cell death of these lapatinib-selected cells. These HDAC inhibitors dramatically attenuated the expression of EGFR and COX-2 via down-regulating their promoter activities. Moreover, induction of microR-NA-7 by TSA was also found to be able to reduce the EGFR expression in lapatinib-selected cells. These results indicate that inhibition of HDACs may down-regulate EGFR expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Our findings suggest that co-treatment with HDAC inhibitors may synergize the therapeutic potency of lapatinib and reduce the relapse in breast cancer patients.",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative way to the most common cancer treatment methods. The use of PDT as a cancer therapy is particularly attractive because of its selectivity on cancer cells. During PDT, a photosensitizer is excited by the appropriate wavelength of light, ending up with singlet oxygen or free radical mediated biological responses. Hypericin which is derived from Hypericum perforatum, continues to be one of the most promising photosensitizer, as it fascinates with its antitumor, antiviral and antidepressant properties. Different modes of action and multiple molecular pathways of its activities continue to be a main topic and need to be straightened out. Recently, hypericin uptake has been correlated with the loss of intercellular adhesion and metastasis. An anti-adhesion molecule which is defined as dysadherin was related to tumor metastase, cell motility and organisation of actin filament. In this study, Caco-2 Grade-II colon adenocarcinoma cell line was treated with 40, 80 or 150 nM hypericin concentrations following irridation with L18W/30 fluorescent light (4 mW cm 2 ). The analyses started 24 hours after hypericin activation. Antihuman rabbit polyclonal IgG for dysadherin immunolocalization and Alexa Fluor-488 Phalloidin for F-actin staining were used. Besides the mRNA expression levels of dysadherin were measured by RT-PCR. The present study shows that the photoactivated hypericin changed the dysadherin immunolocalization and caused actin reorganization. Therefore, this study supposes to enlighten the explanation of hypericin related cell motility prevention and its adverse effects on metastatic potential of cancer cells. Angiogenesis is an important step during tumor progression. The key regulator of angiogenesis is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, which plays a critical role in cellular response to low oxygen concentration. In this study, to examine the effect of melatonin on angiogenesis during tumor progression, we made a mouse tumor model using Balb/c. We showed that melatonin inhibited the blood vessel formation and tumor growth. Moreover, melatonin decreased the level of HIF-1a and VEGF in HCT116 cells. These findings suggest that melatonin could play a critical role in tumor suppression via inhibition of angiogenesis. URG4 is a novel gene firstly found in uninfected liver cells stimulated by HBxAg (Hepatitis B virus encoded X antigen) and HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) cells. It is associated with cell growth, growth factor-independent survival, and anchorage-independent growth in HepG2 cells. It has been implicated as a putative oncogene contributing HBxAg related multi-step hepatocarcinogenesis. URG4 has also been shown to be strongly expressed in gastric cancers and osteosarcoma tissues that is the most common primary malignant bone tumor by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to determine the expression profile of URG4 in two different osteoblast like cell lines; MG63 and Saos-2. These two osteoblastic cells represent different cell characteristics. Phosphorylation of proteins is a major post-translational modification which regulates many cellular processes, including gene P11 -Cancer biology Abstracts expression, disease mechanisms and signalling pathways. Identification of substrates or biochemical pathways regulated by a phosphatase has always been challenging. Here, we report the use of phosphoproteomic methods to analyse the pathways regulated by POPX2 phosphatase which is a negative regulator of PAK kinase. POPX2 is a serine/threonine phosphatase found in many cancer types. The levels of POPX2 have been found to be up-regulated in the more invasive breast cancer cells compared with non-invasive ones. Our observations also suggest that POPX2 level is positively correlated to cell motility and invasiveness. Thus, finding substrates or pathways regulated by POPX2 will help to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of cancer cell motility and invasiveness. In this study, we have also developed and validated a protocol using electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) to enrich the phosphopeptides followed by LC-MS/MS to allow comparison between the phosphoproteomes of control and POPX2 overexpressing cells.",

Enhanced levels of HIF-1a, the oxygen-regulated subunit of HIF-1, are associated with tumour angiogenesis. To elucidate the roles of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) on anti-angiogenic processes, we conducted several angiogenesis assays. In this study, we report that PP2A potently suppressed the angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo system, whereas okadaic acid which is a PP2A inhibitor promotes angiogenesis. Moreover, PP2A decreased the level of HIF-1a and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Taken together, these results demonstrated that PP2A inhibits angiogenesis through inhibition of HIF-1a. Autoantibodies produced against tumor-associated antigens may provide an in vivo amplification of an early cancerogenic signal and therefore may allow early detection of cancer. Simplicity of detection and high stability make antibodies an appropriate tool for diagnostics, prognosis and monitoring of cancer. The aim of our study was to identify and characterize novel tumor-associated antigens of medullary breast carcinoma (MBC) for the creation of test system for monitoring of autoantibody ''signature'' for diagnostics and prognosis of different types of breast cancer. Medullary breast carcinoma despite the high degree of malignancy has a good prognosis for patients and characterized by heavily lymphocytic infiltration, that makes it an ideal target to search for tumor-associated antigens of breast cancer. In the course of this study using a modified SEREX methodology we have identified 42 genes which products are involved in different cellular processes. Preliminary allogenic screening by phage expressed system allowed us to select 12 antigens for verification them as potential tumor-associated antigens in expanded allogenic screening in ELISA format. Brain metastases constitute the most significant part of intracranial tumors. The majority of brain metastases originate from lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Among these malignant tumors melanoma is the one which metastasizes to the brain with one of the highest frequencies: brain metastases are diagnosed in 40-50% of the cases. Since the central nervous system lacks a lymphatic system, the only possibility for melanoma cells to reach the brain parenchyma is via the blood stream and the blood-brain barrier. Despite the great clinical importance, the mechanisms of transmigration of melanoma cells through the blood-brain barrier are incompletely understood. For our investigations we have used an in vitro blood-brain barrier model system based on the culture of cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) and A2058 or B16/F10 melanoma cells, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies have shown that the TJ proteins occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-5 disappeared from the membrane of endothelial cells which were in contact with melanoma cells suggesting that melanoma cells can transmigrate through the bloodbrain barrier using the paracellular route. Transmigration was accompanied by an increased proteolytic activity, and we have shown that the serine protease seprase plays a role in this process. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that transmigration is significantly enhanced by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632. This supports the hypothesis that melanoma cells preferentially use the mesenchymal-type of movement during their transmigration through cerebral endothelial cell layers. Atomic force microscopic measurements indicate that individual binding force between melanoma and endothelial cells is in the range of 100-1000 pN and is significantly increased in the presence of the Rho-kinase inhibitor. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the molecular details of the transmigration of melanoma cells through the blood-brain barrier.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate tumor tissue expression of TIMP-1 mRNA and TIMP-1 protein plasma levels as a prognostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We studied a group of 108 patients with NSCLC who had undergone lung surgery. TIMP-1 mRNA tissue expression was quantified using the qRT-PCR method.

Our previous work demonstrated that BCR-ABL is an inducer of ER stress in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. It is known that the PERK-eIF2a phosphoryla-tion pathway is an important arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is induced under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Activation of the PERK-eIF2a arm facilitates the adaptation of cells to ER stress through the temporal inhibition of protein synthesis and expression of genes with cytoprotective functions. We found that BCR-ABL expression in CML cell lines, CML CD34+ primary cells and CD34+mouse progenitor cells leads to the activation of PERK kinase and to the increased phosphorylation of eIF2a, which correlate with CML progression and resistance to imatinib. We demonstrate that imatinib-induced apoptosis is associated with a downregulation of the PERK-eIF2a phosphorylation arm in imatinib-sensitive cells. On the other hand, inactivation of the PERK-eIF2a phosphorylation pathway by using the PERK-Y615F, PERK-K618A or eIF2a-S51A dominant negative mutants can sensitize imatinib-resistant cells to apoptosis. All mutants show higher level of apoptosis before as well as after Imatinib treatment comparing to cells carrying empty vector, indicating that PERK-eIF2a dependent signalling mediates the cytoprotective mechanisms. Altogether, these findings provide evidence of a novel link between BCR-ABL and imatinib resistance through PERK activation and eIF2a phosphorylation with possible significant implications for therapeutic intervention in CML. The transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) plays a key role in cellular processes including; proliferation differentiation and apoptosis. Deregulation of AP-1 component members has been linked to many cancers, and its over-expression has been associated with the transformation of normal cells. Little is known about the downstream targets of AP-1 that associate with the transformation process. Previous studies using a doxycyclineinducible cJun/AP-1 construct identified PAK3, a serine/threonine kinase as a potential AP-1 target involved in AP-1 induced transformation. PAK3 has been implicated in a variety of pathological disorders and over-expression of other PAK-family members has been linked to certain cancers. This study aims to investigate the role of PAK3 in cJun/AP-1 induced oncogenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed elevated PAK3 expression at both the mRNA and protein level in cJunoverexpressing cells. PAK3 expression levels were also elevated in transformed human and cancer cell lines compared to normal. Analysis of the PAK3 promoter using promoter-luciferase assays identified a putative AP-1 binding site, at position +52 to +60, which may in part be responsible for the increased PAK3 expression observed in cJun overexpressing cells. siRNA inhibition of PAK3 expression showed a regression in the morphology and migration associated with cJun overexpression. However, PAK3 inhibition showed no significant effect on the proliferation of cJun-transformed cells. This study suggests that PAK3 is a cJun/ AP-1 target gene that associates with AP-1 induced transformation; specifically that of cell morphology and migration. Small heterodimer partner interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) has been characterized as one of nuclear receptor coregulators. In this study, we investigated the effect of SMILE on the function of androgen receptor (AR) and the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Transient transfection assays showed that SMILE suppressed AR transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner without altering AR protein level. Ectopic expression of SMILE also repressed the expression of endogenous AR target genes, PSA and Nkx3.1, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.",

Results: Acquired drug resistance was found to be suppressed in doxorubicin resistant breast cancer cells (MCF7/Dx cells) after a pre-treatment with GSNO. The effect was accompanied by enhanced protein glutathionylation and accumulation of doxorubicin in the nucleus. Among the glutathionylated proteins we identified three members of the histone family; this is the first time histone glutathionylation has been reported. Formation of the potential nitric oxide donor dinitrosyl diglutathionyl iron complex, bound to glutathione transferase (GST P1-1), was observed in both MCF7/Dx cells and in drug sensitive MCF7 cells, to a similar extent. In contrast histone glutathionylation was only detected in the resistant MCF7/Dx cells, which also showed 14-fold higher amount of GST P1-1 and increased glutathione concentrations compared to MCF7 cells.",

CD157 is a member of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADase)/adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl cyclase gene family implicated in the control of myeloid cell adhesion, migration and diapedesis. Human CD157 is expressed by9 0% of epithelial ovarian cancers and is a powerful independent predictive factor for disease recurrence and survival. We assessed the relevance of CD157 to migration and dissemination of ovarian cancer cells by transfecting the full-length cDNA in the poorly invasive, CD157-negative NIH:OVCAR-3 cell line. The results indicated that CD157 expression in NIH:OVCAR-3 cells is accompanied by marked morphological changes and enhanced spreading of cells. Moreover, CD157 expression reduces cell-cell aggregation and induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton thus promoting cell motility and invasiveness. Western blot analysis showed that CD157-positive cells are characterized by a significant decrease in E-cadherin and b-catenin expression compared to CD157-negative control cells. Taken together, these observations indicated that exogenous expression of CD157 is associated with the acquisition of morphological and molecular features of the mesenchymal-like phenotype. This was supported by the results of functional assays showing that CD157-positive NIH:OVCAR-3 cells are characterized by enhanced secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 2, 7 and 9, leading to an increased ability of tumor cells to remodel the extracellular matrix and invade the peritoneal mesothelium. The in vitro model of transmesothelial migration of ovarian cancer cells was reproduced deducing suitable Cellular Potts Models (CPM), a grid-based 3D multi-scale mathematical model, which uses a hybrid approach to describe subcellular, cellular and tissue level interactions, combining cellular automata and continuum methods. Collectively, these results indicate that CD157 expression induces a mesenchymal phenotype resulting in increased cell invasiveness. Immortal cells can maintain their telomeres by two mechanisms: the first one is based on the activity of the telomerase enzyme that synthesizes new telomeric DNA; the second one, known as ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres), preserves telomere length by homologous recombination.",

We isolated three TERT positive clones and four TERT negative clones from the VA13 cell line. After demonstrating that the positive clones do not derive from contamination of telomerase positive cell lines, we detected the presence of APBs (ALT-associated Promyelocytic Leukemia bodies), an ALT marker, in all the clones indicating that the ALT phenotype was maintained. A low telomerase activity was detected by TRAP assay both in the positive clones and in the parental cell line. With a fluorescence telomeric probe we showed that in the TERT positive cells the high heterogeneity of telomeric length, typical of ALT cells, was preserved. Nevertheless, following Southern hybridization, short telomeric fragments appeared less abundant in TERT positive cells than in negative cells, suggesting that, as expected, telomerase activity preferentially elongated short telomeres. We finally showed that in the telomerase positive clones the copy number of the TERT gene was increased, suggesting that gene amplification was the mechanism responsible for telomerase activation.

Recent biochemical studies have shown that the deamidation of the NGR sequence gives rise to isoDGR, a new avb3-binding motif. Accordingly, a cyclo-peptide containing the isoDGR motif is a competitive antagonist of avb3-ligand RGD, inhibiting endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and tumour growth. No competition is observed with cyclo-peptides containing DGR or NGR sequences, thus implying precise stereospecific recognition at the basis of isoDGR interaction with avb3.",

We investigated the binding of a small library of cyclopeptides (CRGDC, CisoDGRC, CDGRC, CNGRC, cyclo (-RGDfV-) onto 2 human cancer cell lines differently expressing avb3 and CD13, including a melanoma (MSR3:avb3 + CD13cells) and a non-small lung carcinoma (MR300:avb3 + CD13+) cell line, which display different phenotypes for CD13 and integrins. Only very small amount of receptors are needed to prove binding (in the picomolar range), as it is sufficient that the receptor is detectable by FACS analysis. The method allows using different cell lines, with different receptors, which can be also silenced with siRNA techniques to prove recognition specificity. There was also statistically significant connection between present or absent of PCR products with primers complementary to exons IV, V and junctions III/IV and IV/V and grade of malignancy (p = 0.0000). In cases classified as G1 and G2 lack of at least one of this mentioned above transcript fragments was found. The ERK8 (MAPK15) MAP kinase is implicated in controlling the functions of different nuclear receptors (NRs) and in cellular proliferation and transformation. Indeed, it negatively regulates the activity of androgen and glucocorticoid receptors and enhances ubiquitin-dependent degradation of estrogen receptor a (ERa). ERK8 has been also involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity, cellular transformation and breast cancer. We identified the orphan NR estrogen related receptor a (ERRa) as a novel ERK8-interacting protein. We observed that ERK8 induces CRM1-dependent translocation to the cytoplasm of the otherwise nuclear ERRa and strongly inhibits its transcriptional activity. Also, we identified in ERK8 two LXXLL motifs, typical of agonist-bound NR corepressors, as necessary features for ERK8 to interact with ERRa and to regulate its cellular localization and transcriptional activity. This is in accord with evidences of ERRa being a constitutively active orphan NR, locked in an active-like conformation even in absence of a ligand, and therefore heavily relying on proteic coregulators for its modulation. Ultimately, we demonstrated that ERK8 is able to modulate the expression of ERRa target genes and to counteract, in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells, ERRa activation induced by the EGF receptor pathway, often deregulated in breast cancer. Altogether, we propose ERK8 as a bona fide ERRa corepressor exerting a key role in the regulation of the biological activities of this NR. Based on an increasingly important role for ERRa in human malignancies and, specifically, breast cancer, our results suggest that ERK8 may provide opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatments of these tumors. The critical role of angiogenesis in tumor development has long been considered for the development of effective therapeutical antiangiogenic drugs. It has been shown that different inhibitors of the sterol biosynthesis pathway affect the angiogenic process. For instance the antifungal drugs terbinafine and itraconazole, two inhibitors of the late steps of cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells (EC) acting downstream the formation of prenyl intermediates, suggesting a mechanism different from that of the HMGCoA reductase inhibitors statins. Therefore different steps of sterol biosynthesis could be targeted to obtain antiangiogenic drugs. Here we present the antiangiogenic activity of four different sterol biosynthetic pathway enzyme inhibitors, namely Ro48-8071, policosanol, naftifine and itraconazole, which target oxidosqualene cyclase, HMGCoA reductase, squalene epoxidase and C14 demethylase enzymes, respectively. All the compounds were able to inhibit the migration, differentiation, adhesion of EC in vitro and the vessel network pattern ex vivo experimental models. Compared to the other inhibitors, Ro48-8071 was the most potent inhibitor of VEGF-A-mediated EC migration and adhesion on fibronectin. Besides, the compound was the most efficient in inhibiting the vessel network formation on matrigel and in the presence of cholesterol its antiangiogenic activity was completely abrogated. Ro48-8071 did not affect the expression and activation of the small GTPase Rho, rather it was able to decrease the phosphory-lation of AKT, but not ERK, in a time-dependent manner, thus suggesting its specificity for the mTOR pathway, an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Taken together these data indicate that the inhibition of the oxidosqualene cyclase enzyme, by sensing the membrane sterol content, exerts an effect on vessel formation conferring to Ro-8071 a role as a potential new antiangiogenic drug.

More than 500 peptides were identified and classified in clusters on the basis of their functions, as proteins involved in metabolic processes, cell adhesion, migration and proliferation processes. Some of them have captured our attention because of their involvement in metabolic processes related to tumor progression and metastasis. Among them: galectin-1, a family of proteins that is essential in tumor angiogenesis, whose overexpression is often related to invasiveness; cathepsin B, that is involved in cancer metastasis by facilitating cell invasiveness and migration; integrin-a5, which is known to play a critical role in cell surface-mediated signaling and adhesion functions. In vitro assays have confirmed that the FHC-silenced MM07m cells are characterized by a decreased growth activity, by a reduced invasiveness and a reduced cell adhesion capability. Moreover nude mice (CD1 nu/nu), subcutaneously-injected with FHC-silenced MM07m cells, have shown a remarkable 4-fold reduction of their tumor growth capacity compared to those who received the FHC-unsilenced MM07m counterpart.

In this regard, it has been shown that cancer cells use more glucose and accumulate extracellular lactate even in normoxic conditions (Warburg Effect). Accordingly, transformed cells rely mostly on glycolysis for ATP production as compared to normal cells that use mainly OXPHOS. Taking advantage of a cellular model of transformation, the NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts harboring an oncogenic k-ras gene, we have previously shown that these transformed cells, grown in low glucose availability (1 mM), reduce their proliferation and increase cell death as compared to parental cells, NIH-3T3. In order to identify the mechanisms involved in transformed cells apoptosis, a transcriptional analysis of normal and transformed cells grown in optimal glucose availability (25 mM) as compared to glucose shortage (1 mM) has been performed. The results indicate that both cell lines, when seeded in low glucose, activate genes associated to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and to autophagy. Activation of these processes has been confirmed by protein expression analysis and using chemical modulators of both pathways. Notably, latter experiments have shown that the fate of transformed cells upon glucose shortage is modulated by either UPR or autophagy. Since the autophagic process is strictly linked to UPR, these results highlight the role of UPR-autophagy pathway in the induction of glucose-dependent apoptosis in transformed cells.",

However, in vivo application of siR-NA is complicated by multiple obstacles emerging on the way to gene silencing: degradation by nucleases, rapid elimination from blood by kidney clearance, and low efficiency of cellular uptake and intracellular release. In addition, it is critical to deliver siRNAs to specific cell type to avoid side effects. A novel approach developed in our group employs a natural capability of certain immune and cancer cells to recognize and uptake short DNA fragments containing non-methylated CpG motifs, typical for bacterial DNA. siRNA conjugated to CpG oligonucleotides (CpG-siRNA) are efficiently internalized and bind to the intracellular Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in target immune cells.

It was found that Gn inhibited cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in these cells following 24 hours exposure to a single dose of Gn. The cell viability decreased dose-and time-dependently and the IC50 was found to be 1.3 and 1.5 lM for HL-60 and K562 cells, respectively. Based on the morphological changes, Wright-Giemsa staining, and the expression of cell surface markers, as analyzed by flow cytometry, we found that Gn induces monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells and K562 cells have differentiated toward megakaryocytic lineage. In addition, Gn was found to induce apoptosis among both HL-60 and K562 cells, as evidenced by AO/EtBr and annexin-V/PI double staining techniques. These changes, which were abrogated by the addition of guanosine, became evident when the intracellular GTP level decreased to~20-35% of the untreated control level. Our results suggested that the Gn-treated cells displayed differentiationdependent apoptosis. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that Gn induces differentiation and apoptosis in the cells through perturbation of GTP metabolism, as one of its mode of action. is an abundant cytoplasmic protein found in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipocytes. It is distinguished from other members of the CA family by characteristics such as very low carbon dioxide hydratase activity, resistance to sulfonamide inhibitors, and resistance to oxidant-mediated S-glutathiolation. In addition CAIII is a characteristic of slow-twitch, aerobic, type I muscle fibers. Some studies with CAIII showed that CAIII is involved in mitochondrial ATP synthesis indicating a role of CAIII in cystic fibrosis liver disease. CAIII, is considered as one of the proteins involved in oxidative stress response both in liver and skeletal muscle, probably acting as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, thus protecting cells from oxidative damage. CAIII seems to play an important role also in disruption of the intercellular barrier associated with the down-regulation of E-cadherin in the laryngopharyngeal reflux disease. In recent years, CAIII relationship with the cancer was also investigated. A large body of epidemiological evidence suggests that obesity increases breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Indeed, biologically active substances produced by adipocytes, such as cytokines, growth factors and steroid hormones are known to exert oncogenic effects in mammary gland. Although endocrine factors appear to be the cornerstone of this association, the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer behaviour in obese women is still unclear. Global protein expression analysis, known as proteomics, has emerged as a novel scientific technology currently successfully applied to several fields of medicine. Thereby, a thorough exploration of the protein expression pattern of breast cancer in relation to obesity may lead to a better understanding of the reasons for a higher breast cancer risk and a poor prognosis in obese postmenopausal women. To this aim, we compared proteomes of breast tumour biopsies from obese and normal weight postmenopausal women by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In brief, we found 20 spots to be differentially expressed in obese women (13 down-regulated, 3 up-regulated and 4 missing in obese). Mass spectrometry revealed that most of these proteins have a potential role in neoplastic processes, part of them being already linked to breast cancer. By means of these large-scale approaches, this study reveals that obesity influences the levels of key proteins involved in breast cancer, and opens new avenues for the study of the molecular mechanisms linking these diseases as well as for the development of new prognostic markers.

In the light of these results, alteration of drug clearance and drug toxicity due to decreases of these CYP450 isoforms may be observed in the people used EHT as an herbal remedy. Therefore some precautions should be taken in terms of use of EHT.",

The etiology of this disease include mainly family history, sporadically occurring genetic mutations but also wide range of risk factors such as obesity, smoking and diet. Flavonoids and other phenolic compounds are widespread in foods and are important constituents of the human diet. A growing number of epidemiological studies suggest that high flavonoid intake may be correlated with a decreased risk of cancer. These compounds display diverse biological activities including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well as inhibition of cell signalling proteins. Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxy-flavone) belongs to subclasses of flavonoids known as flavones and has been shown to inhibit proliferation of many types of cancer cells in vitro in dose-and time-dependent manners. There are also numerous evidences showing that chrysin sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis by different molecular mechanisms. Many biochemical targets of this compound are unknown however it was proved that chrysin activity is associated with induction of apoptotic DNA fragmentation, PLC-c1 degradation as well as with activation of caspase-3. The main aim of our studies was to establish the influence of chrysin on the viability of human adenocarcinoma cell lines. Chrysin was also tested for its MDR modulating and apoptosisinducing activity in drug-sensitive (LoVo) and doxorubicin-resistant human adenocarcinoma cell line (LoVo/Dx). The gene expression level of ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1) that are involved in developing of MDR (multidrug resistance) phenomenon was determined. The membrane perturbing ability of chrysin in lipid membranes was also assessed by differential scanning calorimetry. Our results identified chrysin as potential inhibitor of the growth of human adenocarcinoma cells as well as apoptosis-inducing and membrane perturbing agent.",

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in cannabinoids as therapeutic drugs for their antineoplastic, anticachetic, and analgesic potential. In the present study, we show that the combination GEM/cannabinoids synergistically inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by single treatments. The antiproliferative synergism is prevented by the radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine and by the specific NF-jB inhibitor BAY 11-7085, demonstrating that the induction of ROS by GEM/cannabinoids and of NF-jB is required for this effect. Interestingly, cannabinoid treatment influences the Warburg effect by determining strong metabolic alterations in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways and in glutathione synthesis. We also report that neither apoptotic nor cytostatic mechanisms are responsible for the synergistic cell growth inhibition by GEM/cannabinoids, which is strictly associated to the enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagic cell death. Noteworthy, the antiproliferative synergism is stronger in GEM-resistant compared to GEM-sensitive pancreatic cancer cell lines. The combined treatment strongly inhibits growth of human pancreatic tumor cells xenografted in nude mice without apparent toxic effects. These findings support a key role of the ROS-dependent activation of an autophagic program in the synergistic growth inhibition induced by GEM/ cannabinoid combination in human pancreatic cancer cells. The link between cancer and abnormal use of glucose by tumors has opened a new scenario in which bioenergetics could contribute and sustain malignant transformation. The onset of the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells has been reported to derive from several mechanisms, including adaptation to hypoxia, oncogene activation or loss of anti-oncogene and impaired mitochondrial function.

The notion that ALCL strongly express CD30, and display recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene, led to recognition of two subsets, according to ALK expression. Although ALK positive ALCL can be readily diag-nosed, ALK negative ALCL still lack unique genetic features and their distinction from other CD30 positive Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas (PTCL) is not trivial. To unravel the regulatory network underlying lymphomagenesis of ALCL, and to discover new genomic lesions/classifiers for the recognition of ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL patients, we undertook a systematic approach of pathway discovery through a gene expression profiling meta-analysis of 309 cases, using data generated by five sets of experiments. In agreement with previous studies, unsupervised analyses were not able to distinguish ALK positive ALCL and other T-NHL categories, however supervised and class-prediction analyses revealed signatures peculiar of each diagnostic subset. Notably, we identified a signature capable of defining nodal ALCL and validated this classifier in an independent set of samples by RT-qPCR.

It has been recently shown that the transition from proliferative to a senescent state requires activation of autophagy. Moreover, both cellular senescence and autophagy, can be induced in cancer cells upon drug treatment and thus can determine the outcome of anticancer therapy. The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible link between autophagy and senescence in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 and NCI-H460 cells treated with C-1311. C-1311 is a highly potent antitumor imidazoacridinone which intercalates to DNA, inhibits catalytic activity of topoisomerase II and covalently binds to DNA after metabolic activation. All experiments were performed at IC80 concentration of C-1311 over a period of 168 hours. C-1311 slowed down the proliferation rate and produced a stable accumulation of A549 cells in the G1 and 4n DNA G1 phases, while NCI-H460 cells were mainly arrested in the G1 phase. Another marker of cellular senescence, such as size and granulocity increase, activation of senescence associated-bgalactosidase and the induction of p21 protein, was observed in all A549 cells and in most of NCI-H460 cells. Importantly, in all cells that underwent senescence we also observed several symptoms of autophagy such as increased amount of acidic vesicular organelles and the conversion of protein MAP1-LC3-I to a lipidized form LC3-II. When autophagy was blocked with 3-methyladenine, the senescent phenotype was strongly reduced. However, another inhibitor of autophagy, wortmannin, failed to suppress cellular senescence.",

However, no unifying view of a core function determining this widespread STAT3-dependence has yet emerged. We show here that constitutively active STAT3 acts as a master regulator of cell metabolism, inducing aerobic glycolysis and down-regulating mitochondrial activity both in primary fibroblasts carrying a knocked-in constitutively active STAT3C allele and in STAT3-dependent tumour cell lines. As a result, cells are protected from apoptosis and senescence while becoming highly sensitive to glucose deprivation. We show that enhanced glycolysis is dependent on HIF-1alpha up-regulation, while reduced mitochondrial activity is HIF-1alpha-independent and likely caused by STAT3-mediated down-regulation of mitochondrial proteins. The induction of aerobic glycolysis is an important component of STAT3 pro-oncogenic activities, since STAT3 inhibition in the tumour cell lines down-regulates glycolysis prior to leading to growth arrest and cell death, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, STAT3C/C fibroblasts spontaneously immortalized via the 3T3 protocol are transformed and show features of aerobic glycolysis. The transformed phenotype is completely dependent on STAT3 expression but only partially reversed by HIF-1alpha silencing. These data support the idea that constitutively activated STAT3 can act as a first hit oncogene, at least partially by conferring a metabolic advantage to cells. We propose that this novel metabolic role is at the core of the addiction for STAT3 shown by so many biologically different tumours. Our data also suggest that a combination of STAT3 inhibition with glucose deprivation may represent a valuable therapeutic strategy in cancer, providing a mean to hit fundamental metabolic functions of a wide variety of STAT3-dependent, highly glycolytic tumours more effectively than STAT3 inhibition alone.",

In athymic mice, NNMT silencing induced a drastic reduction in tumour volume, suggesting the involvement of the enzyme in cancer development. The present data support the hypothesis that NNMT plays a role in oral carcinogenesis and represents a highly promising marker for early detection of oral cancer. The results obtained from silencing and in vivo experiments seem to suggest that NNMT is involved in cell proliferation and its inhibition could represent a possible molecular approach to the treatment of oral cancer. The venom of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) contains various molecular weight peptides and proteins (mellitin, apamin, adolapin), biologically active amines (histamine, epinephrine) and several non-peptide components including lipids, carbohydrates and free amino acids.

Nevertheless, no reports on the antiapoptotic effects and the associated molecular mechanism of BV in human cervical cancer cell line have been investigated. In this respect, the aim of the present study is investigate the possible mechanisms of apoptosis by which BV acts on human cervical cancer cells (HeLa). For this purpose, the cytotoxicity of BV in HeLa cells was investigated by crystal violet staining assay. It was found that 40 mg/ml BV was 50% cytotoxic dose for these cells. This dose was applied to cell for 48 hours and cells were harvested. The induction of DNA laddering indicates that BV induces the apoptosis of HeLa cells. Moreover, mRNA levels of bax, caspase 9, p38 were increased 30%, 142% and 30% by BV treatment, respectively. On the other hand, bcl-2, and Erk-2 mRNA level decreased 65% and 60% as a result of BV treatment. Unlike these proteins, caspase 3, p53 and JNK mRNAs were not changed by BV. These results indicate that another effector caspase such as caspase 6 or 7 may be involved apoptosis process which remains to be elucidated. Moreover, two MAPK pathways, p38 and Erk, may be involved in BV induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. These observations provide a molecular explanation for the anti-proliferative properties of BV, and suggest that this agent may be useful in treating cancers.

Accumulating literature supports that S1P can act as onco-promoter signal, favouring growth, invasion, and survival of different cancer cells. S1P appears to be involved as an important mediator also in human glioblastomas, the most frequent and aggressive intracranial tumours. Despite the recent introduction of the alkylating agent temozolomide in glioblastoma therapy has improved patient survival, drug resistance mechanisms limit its benefits. Recent evidence suggests that glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), a cell subpopulation within the tumour, are involved in the aberrant expansion and therapy resistance properties of glioblastomas. We investigated the possible role of S1P in the survival properties of GSCs, using GSCs obtained from human U87 glioblastoma cells as model. These cells were grown as neurospheres, and we demonstrated that they express the stem cell markers CD133 and nestin. We observed that GSCs are more resistant to temozolomide toxicity than parental cells, despite not expressing the DNA repair protein MGMT. Moreover, the exposure of GSCs to a SK inhibitor induced cell sensitivity to temozolomide, and thus reduced their resistance to this drug. Further analyses revealed the presence of S1P in the medium derived from both GSCs and U87 cells. Intriguingly, S1P level was markedly higher in the medium from GSCs than that from parental cells, suggesting GSCs can efficiently produce/ secrete this mediator in the extracellular milieu. Altogether our data suggest that GSCs may be an important source of S1P in the extracellular microenvironment, which might contribute to their drug-resistant properties. Mitochondrial biogenesis is under estrogen influence and relies on the spatiotemporally coordinated synthesis and import of proteins encoded by the nuclear genome, of which some are assembled with proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Estradiol control mitochondrial biogenesis through estrogen receptor alpha (ER a) and estrogen receptor beta (ER b). Both ERs can modulate mitochondrial biogenesis in a different manner. Our aim was to check if the 17b-estradiol acts differently through ER a and ER b over mitochondrial biogenesis. To tackle this aim three breast cancer cell lines with different ER a /ER b ratio were analyzed: MCF-7 with high ER a /ER b ratio, T47D intermediate ER a /ER b ratio, and MDA-MB-231 with low ER a /ER b ratio. The cells were treated with 1 nM of 17b-estradiol and expression of some mitochondrial proteins that controls biogenesis parameters, mtDNA levels, and acridine orange (NAO -fluorescence probe as mitochondrial biomass indicator) were analyzed. PGC1a, NRF1, NRF2, TFAM and mtSSB expression levels were higher in treated-cells than in vehicle treatedcells. However, the mtDNA levels change after 17b-estradiol treatment in a different way in the three studied lines: MCF-7 mtDNA increased, MDA-MB-231 decrease and T47D showed a tendency to drop. Mitochondrial biomass decreased only in MDA-MB-231 cell line. In conclusion, our results showed that ER a /ER b ratio could be of great importance in mitochondrial biogenesis and in the cellular response to 17b-estradiol in breast cancer.",

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous multifunctional enzymes, which play a key role in cellular detoxification. The enzymes protect cells against toxicants by conjugating them to glutathione, thereby neutralizing their electrophilic sites, and rendering the products more water-soluble.

Differences in gene expression were calculated as fold changes in gene expression in ovarian carcinomas compared to normal ovaries. It was found that SLC34A2 gene was highly expressed in well-differentiated endometrioid and papillary serous tumors, but was not expressed in low-differentiated endometrioid tumors and in normal tissues. Unspecified adenocarcinomas and benign tumors showed variation of SLC34A2 mRNA expression level from high to low. Analysis of SLC34A2 gene expression according to tumor differentiation level (poor and well-differentiated) showed that SLC34A2 tends to increased level of gene expression in well differentiated tumors. Upregulation of SLC34A2 gene expression in well-differentiated tumors may reflect cell differentiation processes during ovarian cancerogenesis and could serve as potential marker for ovarian cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

            "text": "Analysis of miRNAs potentially involved in ALK oncogenic properties in peripheral T-cell lymphomas Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) characterized by marked cellular pleomorphism and diffuse expression of CD30. ALCLs carry translocations in which the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene is juxtaposed to various genes, the most common of which is Nucleophosmin (NPM1). ALCLs are subdivided into two distinct disease entities (ALK+ and ALK-), based on whether the ALK gene is rearranged as the consequence of traslocation events. Among the numerous signalling pathways activated by the tyrosine kinase ALK, it has been demonstrated that the constant activation of the transcription factor STAT3 is strictly required for ALK-mediated transformation and cellular survival. The aim of this work is to unravel the function of micro-RNAs regulated by ALK or STAT3 in the pathogenesis of ALK+ ALCL. In order to identify miRNAs potentially involved in ALK oncogenic properties, we profiled miRNA expression following ALK or STAT3 inducible knock down (KD) in ALK+ ALCL cell lines. Microarray data analysis revealed that about 200 miRNAs were detectable and around 25 were concordantly modulated by ALK and STAT3 KD. Among them miR-221, miR-222, miR-223, the miR17-92 cluster, miR-34a, and miR-193b resulted as the most significantly regulated. This signature was further validated by RT-qPCR. We decided to focus our attention on miR-223 and miR17-92 cluster which had opposite modulation following ALK and STAT3 KD. To evaluate their functional role in ALCL ALK+, we forced the expression of miR-223 and miR17-92 cluster and monitored their influence on proliferation and survival. We found that forced expression of miR17-92 partially rescues the STAT3 KD phenotype and promotes survival of ALK+ ALCL cells in low serum conditions. These data suggest that miR17-92 cluster could be involved in ALK oncogenic properties in T cell lymphomas and that inhibition of miR17-92 expression could interfere with ALK downstream signalling. It is well established that some natural products enable to inhibit cancer cell growth and metastasis as well as induce apoptosis, suggesting a growing application of these natural compounds as an alternative medicine treatment of human cancers. Honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom (BV) is one of the natural products that have been used traditionally for cancerous tumors, skin diseases, the relief of pain and the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis in oriental traditional medicine. It contains many biologically active enzymes, peptides and biogenic amines such as mellitin, phospolipase A2, apamine that are related to biological activities of bee venom. Although, BV can induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines, its molecular mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. In this respect, the aim of the present study is investigate the possible mechanisms of apoptosis by which BV acts on human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2). For this purpose, the cytotoxicity of BV in HepG2 cells was investigated by crystal violet staining assay. It was found that 350 mg/ml BV was 50% cytotoxic dose for HepG2 cells. This dose was selected for further studies. The induction of DNA laddering indicates that BV induces the apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Moreover, mRNA levels of bax, caspase 3 and 9, p53 and p38 increased 96%, 30%, 65%, 35% and 56% as a result of BV treatment, respectively. On the other hand, bcl-2 mRNA level was decreased 82% by BV treatment. Unlike these proteins, Erk-2 and JNK mRNAs were not changed by BV. In this study, apoptosis was enhanced by BV treatment which was activated by up-regulation of caspases-3 and caspase-9, down-regulation of bcl-2 and up-regulation of the level of bax and p53 via the p38 MAPK and mitochondrial pathways. These observations provide a molecular explanation for the anti-proliferative properties of BV and suggest that this agent may be useful in treating cancers. The definition of tumour niche signals involved in brain tumours stem cell maintenance is crucial to understand the leading cause of glioblastoma onset, progression and relapse. We have injected primary glioblastoma-derived cells into the brain peri-ventricular zone of zebrafish larvae, nowadays considered to be a suitable animal model for orthotopic xeno-transplantation, and evaluated the phenotypic reprogramming potency of the zebrafish brain microenvironment. Glioblastoma-derived cells infiltrated the zebrafish brain tissue, undergoing a progressive loss of stemness and proliferation markers and acquiring a neuronal, differentiated phenotype. In this model, we observed that phenotypic reprogramming of glioblastoma cells could be majorly attributed to the activation of Wnt pathway by endogenous zebrafish Wnt ligands. The possible role of Notch signaling in mediating this activity will be presented and discussed. Epilobium hirsutum is a softly hairy herb, which grows in Turkey. It is used for treating inflammation, adenoma and prostate tumors. The antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) serve as your primary line of defense in destroying free radicals. The serum aminotransferases (also called transaminases), the most sensitive markers of acute hepatocellular injury, have been used to identify liver disease. We have studied the effect of E. hirsutum water extracts on antioxidant enzymes and transaminases in rats. 24 male Wistar rats aged 12 weeks and weighing 200-250 g, were given 37.5 mg E. hirsutum extract per kg body weight, i.p., for nine consecutive days. At the end of the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed, and livers were isolated. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were measured. Our results have indicated significant increase (50%) in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. The weaker decreases were observed in CAT and SOD activities (17% and 10%, respectively). In addition, there was no significant difference between treated and untreated groups in transaminase activities. These results suggest that water extract of E. hirsutum has no acute or chronic toxicity. NAD is a coenzyme involved in numerous metabolic pathways and it has been demonstrated a number of signalling pathways bring about its consumption. Different pathways leading to the formation of NAD are present in cells. A rescue mechanism exists in cells to re-use nicotinamide (NM) released by NADmetabolizing enzymes, this pathway is known as the ''NAD salvage pathway''. In this pathway nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT), which forms nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from NM and PRPP, plays a crucial role. The link between Nampt and cancer is rapidly strengthening. Nampt has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis and to be up-regulated in a number of solid tumours. Moreover, an important role in tumorigenesis has been postulated for a number of NAD-utilizing enzymes and inhibitor of NAMPT, named FK866 entered clinical trails for cancer treatment (Hasmann et al.2003) . We characterized the cytotoxic effect of FK866 and other Nampt inhibitors in different neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines and the possible use of these compounds as a chemosensitizing agent in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents. In neuroblastoma cells, Nampt inhibitors lead to NAD depletion following by cell death. Upon NAD depletion, autophagy must be initiated to allow cell death to occur (Billington et al.2008), i.e. NAD depletion is not sufficient per se. A striking synergism was observed with etoposide and cisplatin in combination with FK866. The combination yielded a drop in both NAD and ATP levels compared to the single agents alone, and also a significant increase in DNA damage. Moreover, in human melanoma slices NAMPT is over-expressed compared to normal tissue, suggesting that NAMPT is involved in melanoma tumorigenesis. Data on cytotoxity of Nampt inhibitors in melanoma tumours, possible synergisms with agents used in melanoma therapy and the different expression of NAD synthesizing enzymes in different melanoma cell lines will also be presented. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor with patient survival at 5 years being less than 5%. GBM progression is strictly related to the malignant behavior of a cell subpopulation that shows stem characteristics. This subpopulation is known as GBM stem cells and is endowed with a great potential of self-renewal and resistance to radio/chemotherapy.",

In particular, GBM stem cells revealed a significantly higher expression of the mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum associated sialidase NEU4 and a different ganglioside pattern. GBM stem cells have been isolated from U138MG, U87MG GBM cell lines and from surgical specimens, plating cells in serum-free medium containing EGF and FGF. Cells forming neurospheres showed the increased expression of stemness markers CD133 and nestin. Sialidase gene expression analysis revealed that NEU4 expression resulted to be significantly elevated in GBM stem cells, in contrast to NEU1 and NEU3 expression which did not change between GBM stem cells and GBM nonstem cells. NEU2 sialidase resulted not expressed in both cell types. In addition, GBM stem cells showed an increased content of GD3 and GM3, as result of a parallel increased expression of GD3 and GM3 synthase genes. In order to understand the significance of the altered expression of NEU4, we stably silenced by RNA interference in U87MG cells and isolated GBM stem cells. Ganglioside pattern changed in silencing GBM stem cells (-75% of GD3 content). After silencing, proliferation rate seemed not to change in GBM stem cells but the expression of stemness related genes such as Nanog (+50%), Oct-4 (+63%), CD133 (+41%), nestin (+75%) increased, supporting a possible connection between NEU4 expression and the stem/differentiated behavior of GBM cells. An analysis by three independent methodologies of the interactions of Erbicin-Derived-ImmunoAgents (EDIAs) and Trastuzumab with the ErbB2 extracellular domain (ECD) led to the finding that EDIAs bind soluble ECD with a lower affinity than that for the native receptor on tumor cells. Trastuzumab instead shows a higher affinity for soluble ErbB2-ECD. Accordingly, ErbB2-ECD abolished the biological properties of Trastuzumab with no effects on those of EDIAs. These results suggest that the fraction of immunoagent neutralized by free ECD shed into the bloodstream is much higher for Trastuzumab than for EDIAs, thus the latter could be used at lower therapeutic doses compared to those employed with Trastuzumab. More interestingly, we found through the use of three different methods, that the epitope recognized by EDIAs is different from those recognized by Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab, and it is located in the domain I of the extracellular region of ErbB2. This finding could lead to the identification of novel epitopes on ErbB2 to be used as potential therapeutic targets to mitigate anti-ErbB2 associated cardiotoxicity and eventually overcome resistance.",

            "text": "One of the most important cellular pathway is a signaling pathway, in which growth-regulating signals from within and outside the cell are integrated through serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR. In cancer cells, some of the proteins shown upstream or downstream of mTOR may be deregulated and it may contribute to, or in some cases drives, the malignancy. mTOR signaling network is implicated in the regulation of many physiological events, and it is also influenced by nutrient and energie levels. Inhibition of the mTOR and its downstream signaling by rapamycin, the specific inhibitor of mTOR, has a cytostatic or cytotoxic effect on cancer cells and was shown to restore the susceptibility of some resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. Treatment with rapamycin, however, also induced activation of endogenous Akt/ PKB in several cancer cell lines in a feedback mechanism that may contribute to drug resistance. Since melanoma, a tumor with a high incidence, is mostly chemoresistant, we analyzed two lines of melanoma cells, SK-MEL-5 and HBL showing different expression of the genes encoding ATPases. We found that the activity of mTOR signaling pathway was upregulated in these melanoma cells compared to normal cells melanocytes. Highly increased phosphorylation and the activity of several effector proteins upstream (Akt/PKB, tumor suppressor tuberin) and downstream (p70 S6 kinase, S6 ribosomal protein) of mTOR was reduced by treatment of the melanoma cells with two different kinds of inhibitors, rapamycin, or SU6656, the specific inhibitor of Src kinase activity. This may indicate an implication also of Src tyrosine kinase activity in regulation of the mTOR-dependent signaling pathway. The soft agar colony formation assay was used to examine the capability of these inhibitors to influence the phenotype of the analyzed melanoma cells. Boron in the form of borates is distributed throughout the earth in soil, food, and water in trace quantities. It's a natural constituent in the human diet, found in the blood as boric acid. Their use in different industries is increasing every day. In the last few years boron compounds became increasingly frequent in the chemotherapy of some forms of cancer with high malignancy and of inoperable cancers.Several studies reported that boron compounds has a therapeutic role in various cancer types. Boron in the form of boric acid, phenylboronic acid, and calcium fructoborate targets proliferative properties of breast and prostate cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated effects of diammonium tetraborate which is boron compound on the activation of the cytotoxicity and apoptotic pathway in the human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7). We used the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay for measured cell proliferasyon and viabilty, Neutral Red (NR) for cytotoxicity. Mitocapture assay for understanding the apoptotic effects on the cell mitochondria are Caspase3/8 Enzim activation test and DNA fragmentation method. MCF7 cells proliferation was measured after the 24, 48 and 72 hours, using by the MTT and NR Assays. According to these result, the cytotoxic effect was found for diammonium tetraborate concentration at 45 mM. According to Caspase Enzyme activation assay apoptotic effects were found for caspase 3 Genitourinary cancers are a major healthcare issue in modern oncology. Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in males. Renal cancer is the seventh most common cancer and the tenth most common cause of cancer death for men, although it is the eighth for women. Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) functions as an autocrine growth factor in various malignancies including prostate cancer and renal cell carcinomas. In these diseases, the high mortality rate leads to search new treatment strategies, in which GHRH receptors have been proposed as new therapeutic targets. In this work, we evaluated the expression of GHRH-R isoforms and the effect of GHRH on cell proliferation and migration. Human prostate (PC3) and renal (A498) carcinoma cell lines as well as non-tumour human prostate (RWPE-1) and proximal tubular (HK2) epithelial cell lines were used. The presence of pituitary-GHRH receptors and its splice variants were demonstrated by Western blotting. In the tumoral cell lines, GHRH-receptor expression was increased as compared to non-tumoral cells. We studied the effect of treatment with 0.1 lM GHRH by bromodeoxyuridine-assays, and we observed an increase on proliferation at 24 h in all cell lines. Wound-healing assays were also performed. Further analysis revealed that GHRH induced a higher migration rate as compared with untreated cells. Presents results indicate that GHRH enhances proliferation and migration in prostate and renal cells lines. The use of GHRH antagonists could provide another approach to prostate and renal cancer therapy. This work was supported by grants from Comunidad Auto\u00b4noma de Madrid/Universidad de Alcala\u00b4(CCG08-UAH/BIO-3782) and Junta de Castilla-La Mancha (PII10-0189-3222 and PII1I09-0061-3802). . Results indicate that a simultaneous exposure to nicotinamide and etoposide is followed by (i) a significant increase in miR-34a levels, and by (ii) a concomitant inhibition of SIRT1. Furthermore, (iii) p53 acetylation levels are higher than with either agent used alone. The end results are strongly synergistic effects in the induction of apoptosis. The conclusion is that nicotinamide has the dual property of inhibiting SIRT1 through a non-competitive enzymatic block (p53-independent) and at the same time through miR-34a induction (p53-dependent). These observations suggest that nicotinamide may become a novel, safe and inexpensive drug to be used in combination with chemotherapy for CLL patients with wt p53. Mesalamine (5-aminosalicyclic acid, 5-ASA) has proven to be an effective first-line non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmacologic therapy that is used today for the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, two major human forms of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. This drug most probably is metabolized by the drug metabolizing enzymes, specifically known as cytochrome P450s. However, There are no available studies related to the effects of 5-ASA on this system. Moreover, there is no information about which CYP isoforms are involved its metabolism. In this regard, the purposes of this study is to elucidate the effects of 5-ASA on cytochrome P450 dependent drug metabolizing enzymes in human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). For this purpose, the cytotoxicity of 5-ASA in HeLa cells was investigated by crystal violet staining assay. It was found that 22.5 mM was effective in killing 50% of these cells in culture. This dose was applied to cell for 48 hours and cells were harvested. The mRNA levels of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 were determined by RT-PCR. Relative CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 mRNA levels were increased 30%, 540% and 25%, respectively (p < 0.05). Similarly, mRNA level of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 increased 30% and 40% in 5-ASA treated cells compared to control ones (p < 0.05). On the other hand, CYP2C9 mRNA level was not changed significantly in this dose regimen. In the light of the present study, it is expected that people using 5-ASA may have increased risk of carcinogenesis due to co-exposure of chemicals such as nitrosamines, and benzo(a)pyrene may be increased because of induction of CYP1A1/2 and CYP2E1 enzymes. Moreover, alteration of drug clearance and drug toxicity due to induction of CYP3A4 and",

In a previous work, we demonstrated that cladosporol A, a secondary metabolite purified from Cladosporium tenuissimum, is able to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells through the upregulation of p21waf1/cip1 gene expression mediated by an Sp1-dependent mechanism. In different cell types the increased p21waf1/cip1 transcription has been shown to depend on a specific Sp1/PPARgamma interaction. In this work we sought to investigate the functional relationship between these transcription factors in HT-29 cells treated with cladosporol A. PPARgamma protein levels undergo a cyclic reduction due to a negative autoregulation mechanism triggered by cladosporol A, supporting the notion that it is a PPARgamma specific ligand. This result is confirmed by the reciprocal effect observed after addition of GW9662, a well-recognized irreversible antagonist. The concomitant exposure of HT-29 cells to cladosporol A and GW9662, indeed, attenuates the increase of p21waf1/cip1 protein levels further proving the involvement of PPARgamma in the upregulation of p21waf1/cip1 gene expression. Transient silencing of PPARgamma in HT-29 cells exposed to cladosporol A reduces the upregulation of the endogenous p21waf1/cip1 gene and inhibits the transcriptional activation of an exogenous transiently transfected p21waf1/cip1 promoter.

Sirtuins and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) are largely involved in brain neurogenesis, as both regulate cell proliferation, cell survival and cell death, and their role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression has been fairly studied in many types of cancer.

Here we report a derivative of this family with apoptotic activity against HCT116 colon carcinoma cancer line. HCT116 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 \u00b7 105 cells/well and treated with 50-80 nM of the 2amino-4-(3-nitro phenyl)-3-cyano-7-(dimethylamino)-4Hchromene (3-NC). This compound was found to be highly active growth inhibitor with GI50 value of 50 \u00b1 3.5 nM as determined by MTT assay, Proliferation of HCT116 cells was diminished by more than 70% and viability was decreased by about 50% upon 72 hours of treatment with 50-80 nM concentration of the compound. Apoptosis as the mechanism of cell death was investigated morphologically by Hoechst 33258 staining, caspase-3 activation assay, as well as formation of DNA ladder. Treatment of HCT116 cells with 3-NC (at GI50 Values) resulted in time-dependent increase in photolytic activity of caspase-3 as compared to the respective control cells. In addition to increased caspase-3 like activity, caspase-9 was also cleaved indicating the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, western blot analysis shown 3-NC is also able to down-regulate the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, cIAP2, XIAP and survivin. Collectively, these data suggest that 3-NC may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of colon cancer. Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide synthesized endogenously by carnosine synthetase. Most of the research has looked at carnosine as an anti-oxidant, anti-aging agent, protein glycosylation inhibitor and more recently as an antiproliferative molecule (1). Recently, it was reported that carnosine inhibits ATP production in human malignant glioma cells by affecting anaerobic glycolysis (2) . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of carnosine on HCT-116 colon cancer cells proliferation. We observed that treatment with 50-100mM carnosine decreased ATP concentration and this result was consistent with the MTT assay. This effect could be related to the inhibitory activity of carnosine on glycolytic metabolism. In HCT 116 colon cancer cells, the activating KRas mutation induces mitochondrial ROS, the signalling molecules for cell proliferation through MAPK signal trasduction pathway (3). We found that, the pre-treatment with carnosine, induced reduction of ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner as well as the phosphorylation level of Erk1/2. In addition, we observed that after pre-treatment with 50-100 mM carnosine, cyclin A protein levels decreased, whereas p21waf1 protein levels and mRNA expression increased significantly. Finally, the cell cycle distribution by a flow cytometry assay (FACS) showed that carnosine induces G1 arrest in HCT116. Analysis of apoptotic cells by annexin V assay demonstrated that the treatment with carnosine was not accompanied by apoptotis or necrosis, but rather by reduced proliferation. We believe that the anti-proliferative effect of carnosine in HCT116 cells is related to its anti-oxidant action and its ability to affect glycolysis. Therefore, we believe that carnosine for its properties may be a good candidate for new therapeutic strategies. (1) and by Spelbrink with colleagues documenting the increased replication activity in large nucleoids (2) . To resolve this issue, we attempted to assess number of mtDNA per nucleoid, visualize possible processes inside enlarged nucleoids, and post-treatment recovery and, finally, whether those giant nucleoids replicate their mtDNA. Enlargement of mt nucleoids was induced by low concentrations of ethidium bromide (EtBr). The exact mtDNA copy number per cell was estimated by RT-PCR and nucleoid number was estimated from the copy number and evaluations of nucleoid number by confocal and structural illumination microscopy. Our results clearly demonstrate that no mtDNA remodeling inside a single nucleoid occurred after EtBr treatment. However, individual mt nucleoids were clustered into large structures, besides the original ''normal'' nucleoid population maintained. After more than 48 hours part of the large nucleoid population was relocated out of the mitochondrial reticulum, which may indicate induction of mitophagy. Recovery after 48 hours of EtBr treatment showed new replication in small objects which probably stood out of large structures. The role of solitaire non-enlarged nucleoids will be further discussed. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the NBS1 gene, which codes nibrin a protein involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks. NBS's characteristic features include: genomic instability, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity and increased risk of cancer development. It is believed that cellular senescence can be induced by DNA double-strand breaks which are followed by the DNA damage response signaling pathway. Therefore we decided to verify whether immortalized cells with a mutation in the NBS1 gene, which codes a protein involved in the DNA damage signaling pathway, have a preserved ability to undergo DNA damageinduced senescence. To this end we used two spontaneously immortalized NBS cell lines (S3R and S4) in which we observed a high basal level of DNA damage noted as cH2AX foci. Cells were treated with a DNA damaging agent, doxorubicin for 24 hours and afterwards cultured for 4 days in a drug free medium. In doxorubicin treated S3R and S4 cells we observed an activation of p53, Chk1 and Chk2, involved in the activation of the DNA damage pathway. Also a time dependent increase in the level of p21 was found in the S4 cells, which was accompanied by the presence of other biomarkers of senescence. This was not the case in the S3R cell line where a time dependent decrease of this protein was observed and very few senescent cells could be found. Based on our results we can conclude that different fate of the S3R and S4 cells treated with doxorubicin, namely apoptosis and senescence is not connected with the mutation causing the NBS syndrome, but genomic instability can be implicated.",

            "text": "Effects of late onset regular exercise on redox homeostasis, neurotrophic status and molecular damage profile in aging mouse brain cortex Oxidatively-and glycatively-damaged biomolecules, together with the decline in neurotrophic support, are crucial factors in cerebral aging. The a-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal (MG) seems to play a major role in age-related molecular damage and neuronal injury. Although physical activity promotes overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), habitual exercise retards cellular aging and reduces the age-dependent cognitive decline, most likely through hormetic adaptive mechanisms and physiological compensative adjustments. This research was designed to address gaps in the literature by testing whether a late onset long-term regimen of forced moderate exercise may alter the interplay between the redox-related profile and the oxidative-/MG-dependent molecular damage patterns in mouse brains, as well as at detecting possible interferences of the BDNF-dependent pathway in the above mentioned processes. Nine-month old CD1 female mice underwent a four-month treadmill-based exercise protocol. Then, brain cortices were removed from two-and four-month treated or sedentary subjects for subsequent biochemical analyses. Our results clearly indicated that after a transient imbalance in almost all parameters investigated, the enforced lately-initiated moderate and regular exercise regimen strongly reduced molecular damage profiles in mature mice brain cortices, by enhancing activities of the main ROS-and MG-targeting scavenging systems, and preserving as well the BDNF-dependent signalling during aging. We have previously shown that the down-regulation of protein kinase CKII activity is tightly associated with cellular senescence of human fibroblast IMR-90 cells. In addition, we have demonstrated that the activation of the p53-p21Cip1/WAF1-Rb pathway acts as a major mediator of cellular senescence induced by CKII inhibition. Here we examined the molecular mechanism through which CKII inhibition activates p53 in HCT116 cells. CKII inhibition by treatment with CKII inhibitor or CKIIa siR-NA increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion levels. These effects were significantly blocked by pre-treatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Additionally, NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and p22phox siRNA significantly reduced p53 expression and suppressed the appearance of senescence markers. CKII inhibition did not affect mitochondrial superoxide generation. These data demonstrate that CKII inhibition induces superoxide anion generation via NOX activation, and subsequent superoxide-dependent activation of p53 acts as a mediator of senescence in HCT116 cells after down-regulation of CKII. Senescence of endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the vascular system is involved in the formation of plaques and arteriosclerosis. It seems that the main cause of cellular senescence is DNA damage resulting from the free radicals action. This could be connected with angiotensin II activity both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to answer the question whether DNA damage induced by doxorubicin, a classical inducer of DNA double strand brakes, was able to evoke senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) isolated from rat aorta. We showed that doxorubicin induced DNA damage in VSMC, what was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining and WB detection of ATM (ser 1981), H2AX (ser 139) and 53BP1. The activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was also proved by the increased level of phospho-p53 and p21 upon doxorubicin treatment. However, the activation of ATM, H2AX, 53BP1 and p53 was transient and its decrease after 24 hours of doxorubicin treatment was observed. FACS analysis showed an increased population of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover cells did not replicate DNA as it was showed by the lack of BrdU incorporation. Despite the changed cell morphology (the increase in size and granularity characteristic for senescent cells), the presence of SA-beta galactosidase, a common marker of senescence, was not observed in rat VSMC. Moreover, after replating the cells into a doxorubicin-free medium the cell regrowth was observed. Interestingly, in those of VSMC which escaped cell cycle arrest, aneuploidy was detected by DNA content analysis using FACS. In contrast to rat VSMC, the human ones were able to undergo senescence upon doxorubicin treatment, what was shown by the activation of SA-beta galactosidase and the arrest of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The mechanism of DNA damage-induced genomic instability accompanying cellular senescence of VSMC is under elucidation. In mammals, SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family, functions as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase and play a key role in fundamental cellular processes including the stress response. The involvement of SIRT1 in the stress response is attributed to interaction with transcription factors belonging to the FOXO family, forkhead transcription factors which control cell functions such as cell cycle arrest, differentiation, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, DNA repair and apoptosis. Despite the finding that SIRT1 knockout mice have impaired gametogenesis and embryogenesis, there is still little information concerning the role of sirtuins in the female gonad. In this work, we investigated the expression of SIRT1 and FOXO3A, the member of FOXO family that regulate the survival of ovarian follicles, in human granulosa cells (hGC). hGCs were isolated from follicular fluids of women aged between 28 and 42 years undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization, and were subjected to Western blotting analyzed. By using antiSIRT1 and antiFOXO3A antibody, we highlighted the presence of bands with molecular weight of about 110 kDa and 70 kDa in all samples analyzed, with evidence of reduced expression of both proteins in reproductive-aged patients (38-42 years). These results provide the first evidence of the expression of these proteins in human granulosa cells and represents an important starting point for defining the cellular pathways involved in the response to stress conditions associated with ovarian ageing and ovarian dysfunctions. P12.7 (S12.2.6) Adoptive expression of a set of miRNAs induces cellular senescence in human fibroblasts Cellular senescence is considered a key player to tissue and organismal aging. DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) are common events in cellular senescence programs initiated by telomere shortening, oxidative stress or aberrant oncogene activation. Cellular senescence is characterized by some biochemical markers and by modification of gene expression pattern. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional ''regulators'' of gene expression. In order to investigate whether miRNAs play a role in the induction of senescence, we profiled the expression of 365 human miRNAs in young (PDL33) and replicatively senescent (PDL55) human diploid fibroblasts (IMR90). Out of the one hundred-fourty-eight miRNAs expressed in IMR90 cells (Ct < 39), we identified 69 miRNAs that were either up-or down-regulated (> 2 fold) in senescent cells. Results were validated for a set of 24 miRNAs (14 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) in different senescence conditions, either induced after repeated passages in vitro or after chemically-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress. To establish whether up-regulation of senescenceassociated miRNAs was causally related to senescence, we electroporated the 9 highest ranked up-regulated miRNAs in young proliferating IMR90 and analyzed their capability of inducing senescence-associated markers. We found that adoptively overexpression of five of them (miR-210, miR-376a*, miR-486, miR-494, miR-542-5p) triggers a premature senescent phenotype characterized by reduced proliferation and typical markers of senescence (SA-b-gal, SAHFs). This phenotype was associated with induction of double strand DNA breaks at a neutral COMET assay and for 2 of them (miR-210 and miR-494) also with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) (cH2AX foci). According to free radical theory of aging, age-related functional decline is related to accumulation of damage inflicted in cells by toxic by-products of oxygen metabolism termed reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative damage leads to a vicious cycle in which increased amount of ROS is produced, leading in turn to progressive augmentation of damage. In non-dividing cells DNA molecules cannot be synthesized de novo and must be repaired to avoid development of persistent mutations and lethal destabilization of the genome. Thus it is usually assumed that the intensity of both DNA damage and repair increase with age. Urinary 8hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) output is widely used as a simple and reliable marker of the global rate of oxidative DNA damage and repair. However, data on changes in urinary 8-OHdG with age in healthy individuals are scarce. We were able to find only one relevant paper (Miwa et al. 2004; Bio Factors 22: 249-253), in which slightly lower urinary 8-OHdG concentration in elderly compared to young healthy humans has been reported, although correlation with age was poor (R2 = 0.08). The purpose of the present study was to observe urinary 8-OHdG levels in rats during lifetime. Five male Sprague-Dawley rats were kept in standard cages. Starting from age four weeks, every four weeks each of the animals was put in a separate metabolic cage and urine was collected in three consecutive 24 hours periods. The urine samples were aliquoted, frozen and kept at -80\u00b0C until assayed. Urinary 8-OHdG was quantified with commercially available ELISA (JaICA, Japan) and creatinine was assayed with the method of Jaffe. Mean urinary concentration of 8-OHdG in 4-week old rats was 7.78 ng/mg creatinine, while in 80-week old animals only 1.73 ng/mg creatinine. The level of 8-OHdG declined logarithmically with correlation of R2 = 0.54 (P < 0.01). Our results strongly suggest that common belief that the rate of DNA oxidative damage and repair increases with age needs to be revisited.",

Tendon injuries produce considerable morbidity and disability that may last for several months despite what is considered as appropriate management. Although different techniques are applied, surgical repair in accordance with tissue engineering is often required. To facilitate healing process, there has been an increasing interest in replacing damaged tendons with either engineered allografts or other synthetic materials. Multiple cell types have been seeded within grafts to stimulate cell-mediated tissue regeneration. The most commonly used cell types are fibroblasts, tenocytes and mesenchymal stem cells/marrow stromal cells. The specific cells -tenocytes-within tendons are important to maintain the unique structural and material properties of these grafts by secreting and maintaining the extracellular matrix. Longtermed monolayer cultivation of tenocytes may lead to a phenotypic drift within passages. Therefore, we studied in vitro viability, cellular senescence and extracellular matrix production of tenocytes. Cell viability was assessed by a digital cell counter and cellular senescence was examined by b-galactosidase activity. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for matrix proteins type I, II, III, V collagen and for specific tenocyte markers tenomodulin and tenascin-C. According to our results, tenocytes showed an increasing growth pattern during monolayer cultivation period. However, cell proliferation was higher in early passages. Cellular senescence was detected after primary passage in an increasing manner in each passage. Immunofluorescence staining results showed positive staining for all molecules except type II collagen in all samples. This study suggests that tenocytes in early passages have advantage for tissue engineering applications without any phenotypic drift and cells may easily be repopulated for reseeding on graft materials.",

Mitochondria are the primary source of chemical energy within the cell, converting macronutrients to adenosine diphosphate. Mitochondrial dysfunction and the agerelated decline in mitochondrial content are hypothesised to contribute to the ageing process. DR-dependant lifespan extension may be mediated through changes in mitochondrial function. This study examined the effects of 30% DR in male C57BL/6 mice following 1, 9 and 18 months of DR compared to their ad libitum (AL) fed counterparts (4, 12 and 21 of age, n = 10 per group). Mitochondrial respiration rates were measured in permeabilised gastrocnemius skeletal muscle. Alterations in mitochondrial content and biomarkers associated with mitochondrial biogenesis were also measured. Mitochondrial content was significantly increased (~35%) by DR in skeletal muscle compared to AL controls. However, mitochondrial content was decreased with age at a similar rate in both AL and DR mice (~25%). Rates of oxidative phosphorylation and uncoupled respiration were signifi-cantly increased by DR. Our data demonstrate that DR initially induces mitochondrial biogenesis and increases mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, although it does not abrogate the agerelated decline in mitochondrial density. A DR-dependant increase in oxidative phosphorylation may contribute to bioenergetic efficiency with age.",

            "text": "Cr (VI)-induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype in normal human bronchial fibroblasts Replicative cellular senescence (RCS) is a pleiotropic antagonist phenomenon-responsible for the cell cycle arrest of compromised cells. It is assumed to have emerged to prevent gene loss at subtelomeric zones as a consequence of telomere's shortening after several cellular divisions. Senescent cells are characteristic of aging tissues where they tend to accumulate and to activate physiological processes of aging. Factors secreted by these cells were recently reported to induce malignant transformation of premalignant neighbor epithelial cells. Cellular senescence is also directly affected by external microenvironmental factors, some of them responsible for RCS' pre-mature onset. Oxidative stress, telomerase inhibition, oncogene overexpression and chemotoxic agent's presence are some examples. Aiming to understand the molecular processes underlying RCS, normal human bronchial fibroblasts (NHBF) were exposed to the chemotoxic agent hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] and the condi-tions to attain Cr (VI)-induced RCS were searched for. A wide range of Cr (VI) doses was tested to exclude Cr (VI)-induced cell death or proliferation, and the impact on cell's viability was measured by the MTT assay. In addition, cellular senescence was measured by the expression of senescence-associated-b-galactosidase. Following four weeks of continuous Cr (VI) treatment, only the 0.25 and 0.5 lM concentrations induced RCS. Though, while 0.5 lM Cr (VI) induce complete senescence in the confluent NHBF culture, the 0.25 lM Cr (VI) result in a mild senescent pattern, with senescent cells dispersed on the monolayer. Surprisingly, senescent NHBF also display morphological changes closely resembling mesenchymal cells and suggesting the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) involvement on the senescent process. In agreement, MET was recently described as a senescence-like phenomenon-and our results strongly corroborate this observation. Oxidative stress has a central role in aging and in several agelinked diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer. Mitochondria are the main cellular source and target of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging (1). Impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation has been reported in several aging tissues. Defective mitochondria are not only responsible of bioenergetically less efficient cells but also of increased ROS production further contributing to tissues oxidative stress. Acetyl-Lcarnitine (ALCAR) is a biomolecule able to limit age-linked mitochondrial decay in brain, liver, heart and skeletal muscles by increasing mitochondrial efficiency (2) . The aim of this work was to study the effect of in vivo ALCAR administration to old rats on the liver mitochondrial proteome. Experiments were performed on three groups of male Fisher-344 Charles-River rats: 12-month-old rats; 28-month-old rats; 28month-old ALCAR-treated rats. Mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation from freshly excised livers. Mitoplasts were prepared treating mitochondria with digitonin; proteins were separated in first dimension on 18 cm 4-7 and 6-11 pH gradient IPG strips and in second dimension on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by nano ESI MS/MS mass spectrometry. A significant age-related change occurred in 31 proteins involved in several metabolisms and ALCAR supplementation altered the levels of 26 proteins. In particular, ALCAR reversed the agerelated alterations of 10 mitochondrial proteins relative to mitochondrial cristae morphology, to the oxidative phosphorylation and antioxidant systems, to urea cycle, to purine biosynthesis. Cilostazol is known to increase the intracellular level of cyclic AMP by blocking its hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase type III. Cilostazol functions as a vasodilator and platelet aggregation inhibitor, and is mainly used for treating patients with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication. However, the role of cilostazol in development, maintenance, and degeneration of articular cartilage has remained elusively. This study was undertaken to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying cilostazolinduced dedifferentiation in primary rat articular chondrocytes. Cilostazol treatment in articular chondrocytes evoked a slight growth inhibition without a reduction in viability. Cilostazol significantly reduced the expression of collagen type II, which play a crucial role in regulating chondrocyte functions via cell-matrix interaction. And, cilostazol stimulated accumulation of b-catenin, a phenotypic marker in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. In addition, when cilostazol-treated cells were stimulated with apoptosis inducer etoposide, the percentage of TUNEL positive cells was markedly decreased, compared to cells treated with etoposide alone. In summary, our findings show that cilostazol induces dedifferentiation in rat articular chondrocytes, and cilostazol-induced dedifferentiation render chondrocytes resistant to etoposide-induced apoptosis.",

A numerous genetic and environment factors may affect the aging process in humans. Recently a number of studies revealed the importance of telomere maintenance as function and causes of aging. Telomeres are protective nucleoprotein complexes that stabilize the ends of chromosomes and modulate cellular aging. The other factor that was addressed in this study was mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy, the presence of multiple mtDNA sequence types within a cell. mtDNA heteroplasmy is quite commonly observed and tends to increase with age. In this study we evaluated the mean telomere length and the rates of the heteroplasmy of mtDNA in human leucocytes samples from different age groups. Methods: Genomic and mtDNA was simultaneously extracted from the blood cells by phenol deproteination method. Telomere length was measured by telomere restriction fragment analysis, and mtDNA heteroplasmy was detected by three different methods: SURVEYOR Mutation Detection Kit, DGGE assay and sequencing analysis. Results: The highest telomere length and the lowest frequency of mtDNA heteroplasmy were observed in the 18-40 year age group. Our results showed that the mean telomere length gradually decreased and occurrence of mtDNA heteroplasmy increased with age. The age group 70-80 appeared to be the most critical for both studied genetic factors. Interestingly, in the non-agerian group (81-100 years) we did not observed further significant changes in the telomere length and mtDNA heteroplasmy level. The results of the present study may indicate on potential importance of genome and mitochondrial components on the mechanism of aging. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to be caused by a toxic buildup of b-amyloid protein (Ab42). However, small amounts of Ab42, which favor the persistence of the peptide in its non-toxic monomeric state, may have a physiological role in the brain (Giuffrida et al., 2010) . We have previously reported that synthetic monomers of Ab42 have a broad neuroprotective effect in vitro, which can be reconducted to the stimulation of IGF-I receptors and/or other receptors of the insulin superfamily (Giuffrida et al., 2009). We now report that, in cultured neurons, synthetic monomers of the mouse Ab42 peptide analogous, also exhibits the neuroprotective effect of human monomers. Noteworthy, mice do not form natural cerebral A\u00df aggregates and do not reveal significant neurodegeneration. To determine how Ab42 monomers interact with the IGF-I/ insulin pathway(s) in neurons, we have investigated whether Ab monomers facilitate the activation of IGF-I/insulin receptors by inducing the local release of IGF-I or by regulating the local actions of IGF-I via IGFBP-2. To address the structure-neuroprotection relationship we have identified in the central region of Ab42, the minimal active sequence capable of retaining the neuroprotective activity of the full-length peptide. We are currently working to establish whether Ab42 monomers also participate in the insulin/IGF-1 control of peripheral glucose homeostasis, and/or neuronal glucose uptake. Preliminary data indicate that Ab42 monomers stimulate glucose uptake both in skeletal muscle cells and in cortical neurons. ",

            "text": "Aging is one of the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Autophagy, an intracellular catabolic process involved in protein and organelle degradation, declines with aging and there is an overlap between the signaling networks reg-ulating both aging and autophagy. The role of autophagy in diabetic vascular disease is poorly understood, but basal autophagy is considered a survival mechanism and is clear the importance of the regulation of autophagic responses during metabolic homeostasis. Computational analysis reveals that crucial autophagy related genes, such as Beclin1 and Atg5 are potential targets of miR-216a, a microRNA that is highly expressed as a consequence of diabetes. First, we compared the miR-216a expression in old HUVECs (PDL44) versus young cells (PDL8) and in the presence of high glucose levels (25 mM). Our results show a significant upregulation of miR-216a expression during aging and glucotoxicity. In the same conditions, expression of Beclin1 and Atg5 was correspondingly downregulated, as assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Transfection of PDL44 endothelial cells with an oligonucleotide that decreases miR-216a level (AS216a) permits an increase in Beclin1 and Atg5 expression, both at mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, overexpression of the miR-216a decreases Beclin1 and Atg5 mRNA and protein expression levels in PDL8 cells. Because autophagy plays a central role in atherosclerotic plaque stabilization we examined miR-216a, Beclin1 and Atg5 expression in plaques from patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, confirming a negative correlation between miR-216a and autophagic genes mRNA level in an in vivo setting. Furthermore, miR-216a expression in atherosclerotic plaque was positively correlated with HOMA-IR. Our data suggest that vascular senescence is associated to decreased expression of autophagy genes as a consequence of increased miR-216a expression. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare genetic disorder with autosomal recessive transmission. AT shows a complex phenotype characterized, primarily, by an early-onset progressive neurodegeneration with cerebellar ataxia, accompanied by oculocutaneous telangiectasias, immunodeficiencies, high incidence of infections and tumors. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the low term treatment of AT patients with glucocorticoid analogues can improve their neurological symptoms and, in some cases, reverse their cerebellar atrophy. The molecular mechanism involved in glucocorticoid action on neural cells has not yet been established. However, since glucocorticoids mainly act through trans-activation of gene, we focused on the identification of the over-expression induced by the drug on AT cells. To this end, lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from healthy volunteers (ATM+/+) and AT patients (ATM-/-) have been subjected to Dexamethasone treatment and Selective Subtractive Hybridization PCR to select the over-expressed cDNAs. The obtained cDNA-library has been first randomly sequenced and next analyzed by microarray in order to identify the whole subtractedselected genes. The over-expression of some of the genes contained in the library has been validated by qRT-PCR. This approach let us to discover about 8000 over-expressed transcripts (versus 57,000 spotted on the bioarray) both in wt and AT cells, mainly involved in protein turn-over, oxidative phosphorylation, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and neurological disorders (i.e. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease). Moreover, about 900 transcripts were specifically activated by Dexamethasone in AT cells, whose genes are related to nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination and cell cycle pathways. Primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1) is a disorder of glyoxylate metabolism caused by mutations in the human AGXT gene encoding liver peroxisomal alanine : glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). In PH1, the deficiency of functional AGT, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent enzyme, allows glyoxylate accumulation and its oxidation to oxalate in liver cytosol. The increasing synthesis and excretion of oxalate results in the deposition of insolu-ble oxalate crystals in the kidney and urinary tract. PH1 is characterized by significant phenotypic variability, the molecular basis of which is poorly understood. Indeed, more than 150 pathogenic mutations have been identified until now, and the molecular mechanism leading to AGT deficiency can differ from one mutation to another (1-3). To reveal the biochemical and structural basis for this phenotypic heterogeneity, we expressed and purified 11 pathogenic AGT variants. Among these variants, six of the mutated residues are located in the large domain either at the active site and interacting with the coenzyme or in the proximity of the active site, while five residues are far from the active site either in the large or in the small domain. The purified proteins were characterized with respect to enzyme kinetics, coenzyme binding mode and affinity, spectroscopic features, oligomerization, and thermal stability in both the holo-and apoform. Overall, this ''in vitro'' expression analysis of PH1-causing mutations has the following major applications: (i) to confirm that a disease-associated mutation is pathogenic, (ii) to define which kind of impact (structural and/or functional) each mutation wield on the AGT enzyme, (iii) to assist in delineating pharmacological strategies. Several rare diseases affect proteins involved in mitochondrial beta oxidation of fatty acids. The majority of these inborn errors of metabolism results from missense mutations which account for broad clinical phenotypes, and for which there is not a clear biochemical correlation with the pathogenesis mechanisms. In this communication I will overview our contributions to fill this gap by addressing the molecular mechanisms underlying multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD). This disorder results from mutations in the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF : ubiquinon-e oxidoreductase (ETF : QO) genes, which constitute the hub linking fatty acid oxidation to the respiratory chain.",

One specific aspect has been the establishment of a molecular rationale for the beneficial effect of riboflavin (Vitamin B2) intake by patients, and the practical demonstration of the role of small molecules as protein folding and function helpers, as chemical chaperones (3, 4) . The relevance of these findings will be discussed in respect to its relevance and implications in the molecular pathogenesis of genetic disorders involving mitochondrial flavoproteins. Krabbe disease is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactocereb-rosidase (GALC). The disease is characterized by nerve demyelination and brain cell suffering due to the accumulation of the cytotoxic galactosylceramide derivative psychosine in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, zebrafish was used as a novel animal model to investigate the role of galc in vertebrate CNS development. Comparative genomic analysis identifies two different galc genes in zebrafish, named galca and galcb. These genes encode for two proteins with high homology to human and mouse GALC. When stably over expressed in human HEK293T cells, both galc zebrafish cDNAs lead to a fivefold increase in galc activity, that co-fractionates with endogenous lysosomal markers and shows an optimum pH value equal to 4.0, thus demonstrating that galca and galcb encode for bona-fide lysosomal galc zebrafish orthologs.",

The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins is encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the organelle by a complex import machinery that includes translocases of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (TOM, SAM, TIM complexes), as well as of the intermembrane space (MIA). To characterize the mechanisms involved in this intergenomic cross-talk, experimental approaches in our lab have been focused on the identification of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes coding for several translocase subunits. Previous results reveal that nuclear respiratory factors NRF-1 and GABP (NRF-2), which target genes that specify the respiratory chain and the mtDNA transcription, translation and replication machinery, are also the major transcription factors regulating the expression of the human genes encoding the mitocondrial translocase subunits TOM20, TOM70, TIM23 and the chaperone TOM34.",

Additional transcription factor/s is/are required for a full expression. We propose several candidates. Massively parallel RNA sequencing, followed by data analysis, allows to discover novel single nucleotide variants and to identify new potential target genes in rare diseases, such as WT-GISTs. By this, mutations at the level of the A subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) of the mitochondrial inner membrane were characterized and validated with Sanger sequencing as tumoral common markers of two young adults (1). After SNP calling and validation, the effect of the variation at the protein level is either a truncation of the protein chain or a mutation that is identified as disease-related with a predictor, SNPs & GO (2), suited to identify disease-associated residue substitution on the basis of the protein sequence and its function. Further investigation of the effects of the mutation on the protein stability indicates that the disease associate mutations hamper folding stability by decreasing the number of hydrogen bonds and of other stabilizing interactions in the FAD binding domain of SDHA. This approach highlights also private variants in the two young adults. Among the private disease-related variants we identified in one patient a K1775E substitution in the myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) and a R206H substitution in the triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1 Moreover, we recently showed that neurofibromin actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a PKC-phosphorylation specific manner, through induction of intermolecular interactions, for functions related to neural cell differentiation. To further address the mechanism of neurofibromin's nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in a post-mitotic environment, we examined its subcellular localization in chick embryo primary neurons, in culture, after incubation with Leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of CRM1-dependent pathway. Surprisingly, we found that expression levels of neurofibromin were reduced, indicating possible nuclear degradation of the protein. This hypothesis was verified, as we observed a twofold increase of nuclear neurofibromin levels, upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors like MG-132. More importantly we found that neurofibromin's nuclear degradation was rescued when neurofibromin became phosphorylated on Ser2808 after activation of PKC. Our results suggest that a pool of neurofibromin is proteasomally degraded inside the nucleus of post-mitotic cells and the degradation is regulated by PKC phosphorylation in the C-tail of the protein (PENED grant 03ED778).",

This defect leads to an intracellular aggregation of linear glycogen molecules, which are characterized by poor water solubility and high damage potential towards intracellular structures. Additionally, the efficiency of glucose release from such abnormal glycogen is strongly impaired, which may lead to energetic imbalance in the cell. The disease manifests itself by dysfunctions of liver, skeletal muscle and nervous system. It is not clear to which extent cell injuries occurring in GSD IV result from a mechanical damage due to presence of linear glycogen aggregates in the cells and, on the other hand, how much the disruption of glucose metabolism contributes to the injury. In our study we compare energy metabolism of fibroblasts with functional GBE and with GBE deficiency (cell lines derived from GSD IV patients as well as cells with suppressed expression of GBE). The preliminary data will be presented regarding mitochondrial morphology, respiratory parameters as well as growth and survival rate of the cells under different accessibility of substrates for glycolysis and for the oxidative phosphorylation. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of skin and visceral organs. We have provided evidence that the serum of SSc patients contains stimulatory autoantibodies directed to the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) that elicit HaRas-ERK1/2 signalling and collagen production in normal human fibroblasts in vitro. Recently, the key role of increased PDGFR activation and signalling in promoting systemic fibrosis has been confirmed in vivo in transgenic mice. To identify the epitopes of PDGFR extracellular domains bound by stimulatory auto-antibodies, B cells from patients with SSc were immortalized with Epstein Barr Virus and a small panel of cultures producing PDGFR-specific immunoglobulins were isolated. mRNA was extracted from such B cells for sequencing and cloning of immunoglobulin variable regions into a human IgG expression vector. Human IgG constructs were expressed in CHO cells, recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rmAbs) were purified from the culture medium and characterized. Selected rmAbs proved to be able to recapitulate properties identified in serum IgG from SSc patients, since they bound to PDGFR and induced reactive oxygen species, pERK and type I collagen gene expression in normal human fibroblasts. Molecular docking simulation predicted that stimulatory rmAbs and nonstimulatory rmAbs recognize different epitopes on PDGFR. This assumption was confirmed through epitope mapping performed by binding competition experiments using a recombinant PDGFR immobilized onto a biosensor.",

We studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) population starting from early embryo development up to late larval stages along with the expression of sets of genes involved in mtDNA replication, transcription and OxPhos complexes. In our survey, we identified the zebrafish genes of mtDNA maintenance and of some OxPhos structural components, with emphasis to those that in humans are candidate genes for mitochondrial pathologies. We investigated the expression of catalytic subunit of the mtDNA polymerase c, mtDNA helicase and timidine kinase 2, in addition to mtDNAdirected RNA polymerase and transcription factor A. Moreover, to assess respiratory complexes biogenesis, we evaluated a nuclear-encoded subunit of NADH-ubiquinon-e oxidoreductase (CI), as well as of the cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthase and a mtDNA encoded subunit of CI as representative of the polycistronic transcripts. For all these genes the spatial and temporal gene expression in zebrafish embryos at different stages of development by whole-mount in situ hybridization was evaluated. Our results show that mtDNA copy number decreases significantly during early embryo development to adult stages suggesting that mtDNA replication is not necessary for zebrafish early development and, accordingly, the genes involved in mtDNA replication present an expression pattern suggestive of a late expression during development whereas genes for OxPhos components are ubiquitously expressed but particularly in cerebral structures.",

Blood samples were obtained and total DNA was isolated using phenol deproteinization method. The following mutations and polymorphisms of mtDNA were checked using sequencing analysis: polymorphisms in hypervariable segments I and II (HVSI, HVSII), whole ND4 gene (including 11 778A mutation), 1555G (12S RNA), 8993G/C (ATP 6), phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA haplogroups. mtDNA heteroplasmy was verified using DGGE analysis. Results: Two patients (mother and son) harbored homoplasic mtDNA mutation at position 11,778A in the ND4 gene forming Arg340His change. Revealed mutation is one of the most frequently observed among patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). HVSI sequence was also homoplasic and without any polymorphisms. Phylogenetic status of the 11,778A mutation was linked to haplogroup (hg) H, but not to hg J as it could be expected in the most cases.

Iron overload occurs in a number of hereditary disorders including thalassemia major and various red cell enzyme deficiencies. The exact mechanism by which iron is absorbed and the manner in which the absorption is regulated has not been definitively determined, however a number of different proteins that are involved either in the transport process itself or its regulation have been identified. Divalent metal transporter (DMT1) gene mediates between apical iron uptakes into duodenal enterocyte and it has crucial roles in intestinal iron absorption, erythroid iron utilization, iron accumulation and iron transfer. In this study, it was investigated the relationship between the DMT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and blood iron levels among 50 thalassemia patients. In order to determine the DMT1 gene polymorphism, standard PCR-RFLP technique was used and blood Fe levels were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). As a result, statistically significant association was found between the IVS4 + 44 C/A SNP in the DMT1 gene and Fe levels in the blood samples of thalassemia patient (p < 0.01 Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a polygenic disease and association with AS was shown for several non-MHC genes.

Also we analyzed an association of two other non-MHC loci associated with AS. In particular we analyzed association of five most associated coding-region SNPs in the ERAP1 gene and alleles of MICA gene coding Val129 or Met129 with that KIR3D alleles. MICA*Val129 and MICA*Met129 alleles are different in strength of interaction with activating receptor NKG2D and likely to contribute in AS.

            "text": "P14 -Biochemistry of the brain and neurodegenerative disorders . Has been shown that these hormones counteract degenerative effects exerting protective effects in the CNS of this experimental model (2). Nervous system is not only a target, but it is also able to synthesize and to metabolize NS (4). Therefore, an interesting therapeutic strategy could be to increase the levels of NS directly in the nervous system. This therapeutic approach could be very interesting because it may avoid possible endocrine side effects exerted by the systemic treatment with NS. In this study we have evaluated whether the levels of NS present in the CNS of diabetic animals would be affected by the activation of translocator protein-18 kDa (TSPO) or liver X receptors (LXRs). We observed that the treatment with either Ro5-4864 (i.e. a ligand of TSPO) or with GW3965 (i.e., a synthetic ligand of LXRs) induced an increase of NS in the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex of STZ-rats. Interestingly, the pattern of induction was different among the three CNS areas analyzed and between the two pharmacological tools. The activation of LXRs might represent a promising neuroprotective strategy since the treatment with GW3965, with respect to Ro5-4864 treatment, did not induce significant changes in the plasma levels of NS. This suggests that activation of LXRs may selectively increase the CNS levels of NS avoiding possible endocrine side effects exerted by the systemic treatment with these molecules. Alzheimer\u00a2s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and a progressive decline of cognitive abilities. Postmortem histopathological studies of affected brain regions in AD patients typically show neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and seniles plaques. Beta-amyloid peptide (Ab) is the major constituent of these senile plaques. There is increasing evidence of a role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD. Several studies have shown an increase of lipid peroxidation in AD. In addition, it has been suggested that stimulation of lipid peroxidation by Ab (25-35) or Ab (1-40) may be involved in eliciting the alterations in membrane lipid composition and the reduced expression of a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (a7-nAChRs) associated with the pathogenesis of this disease. Neuronal nAChRs are thought to play major roles in cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Positive allosteric modulators of these receptors have attracted considerable interest as potential tools for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as AD and schizophrenia. PNU-120596 is a positive allosteric modulator of a7-nAChRs. In view of these results, we evaluated the effects of PNU-120596 on oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rats treated with Ab (25-35). Intracerebroventricular Ab (25-35) infusio\u00b4n (300 pmol/day) during 14 days induced a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase activities as well as an increase in lipid peroxidation in the rat hippocampus . PNU-120596, administred two days prior to Ab (25-35) infusion, partially or totally prevented the Ab-induced effects. Taken together, these data indicate that PNU-120596 may protect the rat hippocampus against Abinduced oxidative stress via its positive allosteric modulation of the a7-nAChRs. An impaired inflammatory response represents the initial starting point for many neurodegenerative diseases1. For their capability of releasing and being target as well of pro-inflammatory molecules and growth factors, astrocytes can be considered key players participating in the development of these neurodegenerative processes. Moreover, astroglial cells cover unique functions in the adult brain parenchyma by regulating synaptic transmission and, therefore, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal homeosta-sis2. To investigate how astrocytes react to the initial phases of inflammation, we cultured rat cortical astrocytes and exposed them to pro-inflammatory molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We observed that stimulated cells rapidly (8-24h) acquire typical features of reactive atrocytes, by increasing the expression of markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) evaluated by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, respectively. Surprisingly, LPS/IFN-gamma treatment did not influence cell viability, measured by MTT test, even at later time-points, but inflammation altered astrocyte morphology inducing the formation of vacuoles characteristic of autophagic processes. We analyzed the expression of the autophagic marker Microtubule Associated Protein 1 Light Chain (LC3B) over time and correlated it with an altered morphology of mitochondria in these cells by time-lapse microscopy. Our data demonstrate that astrocytes rapidly respond to inflammation by undergoing autophagy. Further experiments will reveal the molecular pathways involved in this reaction and what role these events have in controlling the inflammatory response. Beta-amyloid1-42 is a self associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases. Toxicity of beta-amyloid thought to be due to disregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis and inhibition of mitochondrial functions. In this study we tested whether beta-amyloid oligomers have an effect on mitochondrial sensitivity to calcium. Mitochondrial capacity to accumulate calcium was measured by adding of CaCl2 pulses until mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening occurred as large, irreversible increase in fluorescence (using dye Calcium Green 5N). Results showed that treatment with beta-amyliod oligomers 1 mikroM significantly decreased mitochondrial calcium retention capacity comparing with control. However, beta-amyloid oligomers at 1 mikroM had no effect on brain mitochondrial respiration rate at state 2 and state 3 as a substrate were used pyruvate and malate. These data indicates that beta-amyloid oligomers has no effect on isolated brain mitochondrial respiration rate, but decreases mitochondrial resistance to calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra. Recent studies indicate that 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (CysDA) is strongly neurotoxic and may contribute to the onset and progression of this disease (1) . The aim of the present work is to study the effect exerted by CysDA on the expression, aggregation and cellular localization of alpha-Synuclein (a-Syn), involved in the etiopathogenesis of PD, and of ERp57, an endoplasmic reticulum thiol oxidoreductase, known to be implicated in neurodegeneration (2) . Intrastriatal injection of CysDA in CD1mice caused a depletion of dopamine, without affecting serotonergic or noradrenergic systems. After treatment, an increase of a-Syn aggregated forms and a slight decrease in the monomeric form were observed in the pre-frontal cortex with respect to the striatum and hippocampus. These data are in agreement with previous findings which indicate that a-Syn is overexpressed in the pre-frontal cortex in cognitive impairment (3). To assess a-Syn cellular localization, cytoplasm and nuclei fractions were obtained from SH-SY5Y cells treated with CysDA at different times. In the cytosol, a-Syn oligomers increased with incubation time, up to 24 hours, whereas the monomeric form was overexpressed within 1 hour, and decreased in prolonged incubations. In the nuclei, only the oligomeric form was present, which increased after 8 hours of incubation. In mice, ERp57 expression was upregulated in the striatum after CysDa treatment, whereas the other brain regions were slightly affected. In the cells, protein expression was increased up to 24 hours at the cytosolic level, on the contrary in the nuclei ERp57 was transiently increased within 3 hours. Our results show that both a-Syn and ERp57 are modulated in response to CysDA induced toxicity. It has been proposed that cholinergic neurotransmitter system may be involved in the mechanisms of lead (Pb) neurotoxicity mainly during development [1] and that Pb seems to be implicated in the aetiology of psychological pathologies [2] . The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of lead (500 ppm Pb(CH3CO2)2/day, in drinking water, for 4 weeks) on (i) anxiety and (ii) the activity of the two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) isoforms [salt soluble (SS)-and detergent soluble (DS)-isoforms] of specific brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain), in adult male mice. Anxiety was assessed by measuring (i) the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze apparatus and (ii) the thigmotaxis time (time remaining close to vertical surfaces) spent in an open-field. The activity of both AChE isoforms was evaluated by Ellman's colorimetric method. Our results showed that lead-treated mice displayed a decrease (40.9%) in the time spent in the open arms and an increase (13.45%) in thigmotaxis time compared to their respective controls, suggesting thus, an anxiogenic-like behavior. Concerning the activity of AChE, lead caused significant inhibition in the enzyme's activity (in a range of 6.35-24.62% in both isoforms) in all brain regions tested. Conclusively, our data indicate that lead exerts neurotoxic effects in adult mice, through behavioural and cholinergic disturbances. Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a non-convulsive form of epilepsy characterized by impaired consciousness and SWD activity on EEG. Some investigators showed involvement of T-type channels in this disease (Chen, 2003; Broicher, 2008). We used WAG/Rij rat strain as an animal model of absence epilepsy and Wistar strain as control. We investigated three T-channels (Cav3.1, Cav3.2, Cav3.3) mRNA expression in thalamic laterodorsal (LD) nucleus and S1ULp zone of somatosensory cortex (''cortical focus'') using TaqMan Real-Time PCR system. Three age groups of rats were taken for expression measurements in ''cortical focus'' (10 days, 25 days, 6 months) and two groups for measurements in LD nucleus (10 and 25 days). T-channels mRNAs expression was increased in ''cortical focus'' of WAG/Rij rats. We observed 1.8-fold increase of Cav3.2 mRNA level in 10-days-old rats, 2.5-fold increase in 25-days old group and insignificant raise in 6-months-old rats. We identified almost the same levels of Cav3.1 mRNA in 10-days-old epileptic and control rats, 2-fold increase in 25-days-old WAG/Rij rats and 2.5-fold raise in 6-months old group. There was observed 1.3-fold augmentation of Cav3.3 mRNA expression in 10-daysold group of epileptic rats, 1.4-fold increase in 25-days-old group and the same levels in 6-month-old WAG/Rij and Wistar rats. LD nucleus levels of T-channels mRNAs were decreased in epileptic rats. The levels of Cav3.3 and Cav3.2 mRNAs were unchanged in 10-days-old rats and decreased by 1.6 times in 25 days old epileptic rats. We observed 1.8-fold decrease of Cav3.1 mRNA level in 10-days old epileptic rats and 3-fold diminution in 25-days-old rats. Elevated expression of Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 in ''cortical focus'' after puberty may lead to hyperexcitability of neurons and generation of SWD seen in epilepsy. As neurons of LD nucleus are overactivated during spike-wave discharges, lowering of T-channels expression might indicate some compensatory mechanism against such over activation. In the human brain D-amino acid oxidase (hDAAO) degrades D-serine, a glutamate co-agonist necessary for the activation of the NMDA receptors: a reduced concentration of synaptic D-serine has been associated to schizophrenia susceptibility (1). The activity of hDAAO is known to be affected by the interaction with the protein pLG72 (2). In the database various SNPs in the hDAAO gene resulting in non-synonymous substitutions are reported: the most known one resulted in the G331V replacement. Furthermore, a gene sequence carrying three nucleotide substitutions yielding the D31H and R279A replacements has been also deposited. In order to evaluate the effect of these polymorphisms on the enzyme functionality, we expressed and characterized the corresponding hDAAO variants. The D31H and R279A variants of hDAAO have been over-expressed in E. coli cells ( 10 mg/L of broth), whereas the expression level of soluble G331V variant was low (< 0.1 mg/L). The D31H and R279A hDAAO variants did not show alterations in the kinetic properties on D-serine, binding affinity for benzoate and chlorpromazine inhibitors, dimeric oligomerization state and interaction with pLG72, whereas the affinity for the FAD cofactor is higher (4-and 10-fold) than for the wild-type enzyme. By using stably transfected U87 human glioblastoma cells, the EYFP-hDAAO-D31H and -R279A proteins were shown to correctly localize to peroxisomes and to produce a higher decrease in cellular D/(D + L) serine ratio than the wild-type hDAAO.",

Vertebrate retinal rod Outer Segments (OS) are the site of visual transduction, an energy demanding process for which mechanisms of ATP supply are still poorly known. Glycolysis or diffusion of either ATP or phosphocreatine from the inner segment (IS) do not seem to display adequate timing to supply ATP for phototransduction [1] . Our previous data suggest the existence of an aerobic metabolism in OS, which would largely account for the light stimulated ATP need of the photoreceptor [2] . Here, by oxymetry and biochemical analyses, we show that: (i) isolated disks synthesize ATP and consume O 2 in the presence of pyruvate/malate and succinate either in coupled or uncoupled conditions; (ii) OS homogenates, which contain cytosol, house the whole biochemical machinery for the aerobic degradation of glucose, i.e. glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). Activities of the 8 TCA cycle enzymes in OS were comparable to those in retinal mitochondria-enriched fractions. Disk and OS preparations were subjected to immunogold TEM analysis with specific antibodie, showing the expression therein of both the visual pigment rhodopsin and FoF1-ATP synthase. Finally, double immunofluorescence on mouse retina sections demonstrated a colocalization of some respiratory complex mitochondrial proteins with rhodopsin in rod OS, strengthening the idea that these are true components of OS. Data could shed light on those retinal pathologies (retinitis pigmentosa and age related macular degeneration) related to oxidative stress and to mutations in TCA enzymes. Moreover the high oxygen consumption by rod during dark adaptation, may substantiate rod driven hypoxia, and be the driving force of diabetic retinopathy. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the extracellular accumulation in the brain of fibrils made of the 40-42 aminoacids amyloid b -peptide (Ab). Ab is released through proteolysis of membrane bound amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the combined action of b-and c-secretases, and exerts neurotoxic activity through a centrally located sequence encompassing aminoacids 25-35 (Ab25-35). A b is also present in plasma, and increased levels of plasma Ab have been documented in AD, and shown to accumulate in the atherosclerotic plaques. Platelets are the main source for plasma Ab, as they express high levels of APP that can be proteolyzed during activation. Moreover, alterations of platelet APP metabolism have been described in AD. In this study, we investigated whether Ab supports platelet activation and adhesion. We found that Ab25-35 peptide caused a dose-dependent integrin aIIbb3mediated platelet aggregation, which was completely suppressed by aspirin or ADP scavengers. Ab25-35 also caused serotonin release, P-selectin exposure, and inside-out aIIbb3 activation. These processes were associated to stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways, as evidenced by the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including Syk and PLCc2, by cytosolic Ca 2+ increase, and by Rap1b activation. Platelets were also able to adhere to immobilized Ab25-35, to an extend comparable to that observed over collagen or fibrinogen. However, Ab25-35-adherent platelets failed to spread, even upon activation with TRAP1, convulxin, or U46619. Nevertheless, Ab25-35 supported activation of adherent platelets as revealed by accumulation of GTPbound Rap1b, and phosphorylation of myosin light chain and Akt. These results demonstrate that the soluble amyloidogenic Ab peptide can trigger aggregation of circulating platelets, but also supports platelet adhesion and activation when immobilized into insoluble structures as occurring in AD patients.",

            "text": "In vitro effect of human mesenchymal stem cells on some adhesion molecules involved in leukocytes trafficking and inflammation into the central nervous system The central nervous system (CNS) is considered an immune-privileged site, where the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly controls lymphocyte entry. Under physiological conditions, lymphocyte traffic into CNS is low, whereas during inflammatory diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), circulating lymphocytes gain access to the CNS through discrete steps involving adhesion molecules and chemo-kine receptors. In EAE model, several studies showed that autoaggressive T cells upon activation in vitro can migrate across the BBB into the CNS, leading to inflammation and demyelination. Recent reports about the immunomodulating properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) together with the efficacy of their systemic administration as treatment of EAE, prompted us to investigate their effect on in vitro activated lymphocytes stimulated via TCR and aCD28. The expression of a4-integrin, b2-integrin, CXCR3, and ICAM-1 was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR on activated CD3+ selected lymphocytes cultured in the absence or in the presence of MSCs (CD3/MSC ratios 4 : 1, 10 : 1, 20 : 1), in a cell to cell contact and transwell systems. We observed a MSC-mediated modulation of the expression of a4-integrin, CXCR3, ICAM-1 and? b2-integrin in activated lymphocyte population, mainly at the 4 : 1 CD3/MSC ratio. Overall, we can conclude that human MSCs modulate the expression of some crucial adhesion molecules expressed on T blast-cells and that are involved in the processes of lymphocyte trafficking and inflammation into the CNS. This first information might be relevant in view of the clinical application of MSC-based cellular therapy for the autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis.",

            "text": "Investigating the role of the cellular prion protein in Alzheimer's disease ). An intriguing hypothesis, based on increasing amounts of data that may explain the multifaceted behavior of PrPC, entails that the protein is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. In this respect, we have demonstrated that PrPC influences local Ca2+ movements in neurons (Lazzari et al., 2011). This was achieved by using lentiviral constructs expressing different aequorin Ca2+ probes, and primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) derived from WT and PrP-KO congenic mice. Recently, a few reports have shown that PrPC acts as a high-affinity receptor for the amyloid-b (Ab) peptide, a fragment of the amyloid precursor protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that PrPC-Ab interactions may be fundamental for AD-related impairment of synaptic plasticity (Laure\u00b4n et al., 2009; Gimbel et al., 2010). Given that synaptic plasticity is closely related to Ca 2+ homeostasis, we have adopted the aequorin strategy to investigate whether treatment of primary CGN -expressing or not PrPC -with oligomeric Ab (1-42) peptides, or the shorter (1-40) fragment, deranges Ca 2+ metabolism in a PrPC-dependent manner. Specifically, we have analysed Ca 2+ entry through either store-operated channels, or those activated by glutamate. Here, we present preliminary results of this investigation, which suggest that Ab could exert PrPC-dependent effects on Ca 2+ metabolism of CGN. Neuroactive steroids act in the peripheral nervous system as physiological regulators and as protective agents for acquired or inherited peripheral neuropathy. Recently, it was reported that the modulation of neuroactive steroids levels could be a potential therapeutic approach to protect peripheral nerves from damage caused by diabetes. An innovative approach to restore neuroactive steroid synthesis and level could be represented by the modulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The liver X receptors (LXRs), master regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, would thus represent a key candidate. LXRs are ligand activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptors superfamily. They act as cholesterol sensors leading to prevent excessive intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. In an experimental model of diabetic neuropathy we show that functional LXRa and b isoforms are expressed. Their activation by GW3965, a non-steroidal synthetic ligand, in streptozotocin induced diabetic rat increases in the sciatic nerve the gene expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR (a molecule involved in the transfer of cholesterol into mitochondria), of the enzyme P450scc (responsible for conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone), of 5a-reductase (involved in the generation of neuroactive steroids) and of classical LXRs targets involved in cholesterol efflux, such as ABCA1 and ABCG1. These effects were associated with increased levels of neuroactive steroids (e.g. pregnenolone, progesterone, dihydroprogesterone and 3a-diol) in the sciatic nerve, and with neuroprotective effects on thermal nociceptive activity, nerve conduction velocity, and Na + , K+-ATPase activity. Altogether these results suggest that LXR activation may be a promising pharmacological approach to increase local neuroactive steroid to exert neuroprotective effects in diabetic neuropathy.",

In this paper, we review the potential importance of these alterations to the pathogenesis of these diseases and focus the reader's attention on some secondary alterations of sphingolipid metabolism that have been sporadically reported in the literature. Moreover, we present a detailed analysis of the lipid composition of different central nervous system and extraneural tissues from the acid sphingomyelinase-deficient mouse, the animal model for Niemann-Pick disease type A, characterized by the accumulation of sphingomyelin. Our data show an unexpected, tissue specific selection of the accumulated molecular species of sphingomyelin, and an accumulation of GM3 and GM2 gangliosides in both neural and extraneural tissues, that cannot be solely explained by the lack of acid sphingomyelinase. Keywords: gangliosides, glycosphingolipids, sphingolipids, sphingomyelin, sphingolipid storage diseases, Niemann-Pick PrPC is a GPI-anchored protein primarily concentrated in neuronal cells; its pathological transition occurs in lipid rafts. These membrane domains, enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, are thought to play a crucial role in the alternative folding of the PrP by providing a favourable environment for the conformational conversion to occur. Alternatively, PrPC can be submitted to different cleavages; the most known befall in the middle of the actual neurotoxic sequence and prevents the conformational conversion of the protein. The aim of our project is to establish if the alteration of cell lipid composition can modify the distribution of the cellular prion protein within raft or non-raft regions and/or promote the activity of disintegrins, such as ADAM10, upon PrPC. Granule cells from the cerebella of 8-day-old SD rats were incubated, after 8 days in culture, with different gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, GT1b) 210-6 M, at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours. Detergent resistant membrane fractions (DRM) preparation was accomplished according to Palestini et al., 2000 and proteins in all gradient fractions were separated and analysed by EF/WB. Considering our interest in PrPC, we immunoblotted this protein with primary antibodies able to recognize different aminoacidic sequences. Proteins were then detected by ECL. Cell incubation with GM1 lead to its enrichment in DRM; immunoblottings with different anti-PrP antibodies showed a different distribution of PrPC along all gradient fractions.",

            "text": "Virtual screening, identification and experimental testing of novel inhibitors of human dopa decarboxylase However, only 1-5% of L-DOPA reaches the dopaminergic neurons of the brain, while the rest is metabolized by the peripheral isoform of DDC. Therefore, in order to increase the amount of L-DOPA in the CNS and prevent its side effects, a DDC-inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa) unable to cross the blood-brain barrier is usually co-administered. Unfortunately, carbidopa is not selective for DDC, but it reacts irreversibly with both free PLP and other PLP-dependent enzymes, inducing diverse side effects (1). In the present work, virtual screening (VS) approaches were undertaken with the aim of developing new, more selective and competitive inhibitors of DDC. Starting from the structural complex between pig kidney DDC and carbidopa, a new VS protocol, integrating pharmacophore searches and molecular docking, was developed. This approach was exploited to filter the public ZINC database ( 8 million compounds) (2), in an attempt to identify new DDC inhibitors. The potential hits retrieved from this study were purchased and tested in vitro. The most potent hit compounds obtained during the first round of screening analysis underwent an in-depth investigation, involving mainly similarity search approaches, to increase their inhibitory activity. This second screening permitted us to identify two series of structural analogs with novel scaffold structures, which were purchased and in vitro tested. The most promising representatives of the two series inhibited human DDC in vitro with a Ki in the low micromolar range. FAAH is a membrane enzyme terminating the signalling of anandamide (AEA) that, together with 2-arachidonoylglycerol, represent the most studied endocannabinoids. In contrast to most neuromodulators, the hydrophilic cytosol poses a diffusional barrier for the efficient delivery of the lipophilic AEA to its site of degradation. Enzyme/substrate interactions involving lipophilic substrates and membrane bound enzymes have peculiar mechanistic requirements that need to be investigated. In this study we analyzed the structure of a truncated form of rat FAAH by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealing that the enzyme in solution is an octamer of dimers, and, in the presence of detergents mimicking the membrane milieu, it dissociates to dimers. We paralleled this structural information with a functional analysis of the enzyme investigating the catalytic activity and the membrane binding properties in the presence of different synthetic vesicles using fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements (FRET). FAAH showed both an increased membrane binding ability and enzymatic activity in the presence of lipid bilayers containing AEA, and both parameters appeared to be strongly enhanced with the contemporary presence of cholesterol within the membrane. Confocal analysis of the intracellular distribution of AEA, FAAH, cholesterol, and lipid rafts, clearly indicated a strong association between cholesterol and AEA, as well as between AEA and FAAH. On the other hand FAAH and lipid rafts appeared segregated, with FAAH staining restricted to intracellular membrane and adiposomes. Molecular dynamics simulation of FAAH, cholesterol and AEA within the membrane gives rise to structural information in line with the experimental results. Taken together, these data allowed to describe the molecular mechanisms responsible for the functional modulation of FAAH, evidencing the key role of membrane lipids in orchestrating both the enzyme function and its subcellular localization.",

            "text": "Proteomics analysis of altered proteins phosphorylation in alzheimer disease hippocampus: inplications in the neurodegenerative process Phosphorylation on tyrosine, threonine and serine residues represents one of the most important post-translational modifications and is a key regulator of cellular signaling of multiple biological processes that require a strict control by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Abnormal protein phosphorylation has been associated with several human diseases including Alzheimer P14 -Biochemistry of the brain and neurodegenerative disorders Abstracts disease (AD). One of the characteristic hallmarks of AD is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, composed of microtubuleassociated, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein [1] . Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant protein phosphorylation occurs in AD, resulting from the concomitant alteration of protein kinase and phosphatase machinery. Several proteins other than tau show altered phosphorylation levels in AD [2, 3] . Phosphoproteomics has recently gained attention as a valuable approach to analyze protein phosphorylation, both in a quantitave and a qualitative way [4, 5] . We used the fluorescent phosphospecific Pro-Q Diamond dye to identify proteins that showed alterations in their overall phosphorylation in the hippocampus of AD versus. control (CTR) subjects. Significant changes were found for 17 proteins involved energy metabolism and ATP production, signal transduction and neuronal structure, thus suggesting the impairment of various neuronal functions. These phosphoproteome data may provide new clues to better understand molecular pathways that are deregulated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD Ribosome, the protein synthesis machinery of the cell, has also been implicated in protein folding. This activity resides within the domain V of the main RNA component of the large subunit of the ribosome. It has been shown that two anti-prion drugs 6-aminophenanthridine (6AP) and Guanabenz (GA) bind to the domain V of the large ribosomal RNA and inhibit specifically the ribosomal protein folding activity (RPFA). Here, we have characterized the mode of inhibition of RPFA by these two drugs using ribosomes or ribosomal components active in protein folding (referred to as 'ribosomal folding modulator' or RFM) from both bacteria and yeast using human carbonic anhydrase (HCA) as a study system. Our biochemical data indicate that 6AP and GA inhibit RPFA by competition with the unfolded protein for binding to the ribosome and thereby decrease the yield of the refolded protein without affecting the rate of their refolding. Further, 6AP-and GA-mediated inhibition of RPFA can be reversed by the addition of RFMs in excess. We also demonstrate with delayed addition of the ribosome and the antiprion drugs in separate HCA refolding reactions that there is a short time-span in the range of seconds within which the ribosome interacts with the unfolded protein substrate for its refolding. Thus we conclude that the protein folding activity of the ribosome is conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes and most likely the substrate for RPFA is an early refolding state of the target protein. The amyloid hypothesis was proposed, to study the Alzheimer's disease, and is focused on the aggregation of fragments of the protein APP known as beta-amyloid, Ab. This is believed to be responsible for neuronal death which leads to memory loss and irrational behavior. When the O2 reacts with a reduced metal ion, it produces reactive oxygen species, or ROS, such as HO\u2022, H2O2, O2-that destroy proteins, cellular membranes, and DNA. This process starts when Ab aggregates and interrupt neurons communication. With metals ions like CuII and O2, these aggregates produce ROS that concludes in neuronal death. In this project we study the interaction between the peptide DAHK and Ab40-CuII. We selected the peptide DAHK because it is believed to be a stronger quelator than Ab. DAHK has a specific CuII binding site and it is the terminal Cu-binding domain of HSA, human serum albumin, a protein present in the human brain and blood. Throughout the realization of this project, we were able to provide evidence that DAHK and HSA have stronger affinity to CuII than Ab40. DAHK can decrease the aggregation of Ab40 and both, DAHK and HSA presented low ROS production: 6.8% and 1.2%, respectively.",

Alterations in autophagy and inflammation occur at the early stages of AD. Autophagy is a major pathway for the degradation of proteins and organelles in the lysosomes. Several data indicate that autophagy is altered in AD with accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in brain. The inflammation is increased and contributes to the pathology. However, the links between autophagy and inflammation in AD remain to be discovered. The aim of this study is to understand if an inflammatory stress can modulate autophagy. For that purpose, we used two models of acute inflammatory stress: First, murine primary mixed neuron-astrocyte-microglia co-cultures exposed to an inflammatory stress induced by LPS (100 ng/ml) or Ab42 (20 lM) and second B6C3F1 mice treated either with LPS (10 mg/Kg i.p. every 8 hours during 24 hours) or 0.9% NaCl as vehicle. In both models, amount of inflammatory factors (TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6) were measured by ELISA and autophagy was assessed by western blot analysis of Beclin-1, p62, the rate of conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, as well as of components of the mTOR signaling pathway which negatively controls autophagy.",

The Group II of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes of Fold-Type I comprises three evolutionarily related human enzymes: aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) [1] . These enzymes are highly expressed in the brain, where they are responsible for the synthesis of dopamine, serotonin, GABA and histamine. Despite the key role of these three enzymes, and their involvement in very important diseases (e.g. Parkinson Disease) the regulation of their activity is still shrouded in mystery.

Here we present the first crystal structure of an apoenzyme of Group II decarboxylases; the human apoAADC. On the basis of the surprising conformation of this structure we propose a simple model for the preferential degradation of the apoenzymes. The unexpected conformation of apoAADC forces to reconsider in a new perspective the mechanism of PLP addition to the apoenzymes of group II decarboxylases.

Tat-peptide is able to shift the metabolism of APP towards amyloidogenesis, reproducing the initial phases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (Epis, 2010). In this context, we investigated alterations of the calcium signaling in primary co-cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and glial cells treated with Tat-Pro peptide. Some key components of calcium signalling, such as the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and the neuronal type IP3 receptor (IP3R1) were significantly increased after the treatment with Tat-Pro, with a consequent deregulation of calcium signalling in these cells. We noticed the involvement of astroglial cells in the first phases of this pathology, showing that probably these changes appeared first in glial cells, which then affect the neurons. In this regard, we confirmed the possibility for glial cells to produce Ab and we verified their impact on the survival of the neurons themselves. Moreover, direct application of Ab mimicked the effect of Tat-Pro on Ca 2+ homeostasis. FK506, a specific inhibitor of phosphatase calcineurin, was able to reduce the effects of Tat-Pro peptide, suggesting a possible involvement of this enzyme in deregulation of Ca 2+ -related genes. Our results demonstrate that Tat-Pro model can be used for investigation of the role of alterations of calcium homeostasis in glial cells in the early stage of sporadic AD.",

Several enzymes comprising the purine salvage and cleavage pathway are found with highest activity in lymphoid tissues mainly associated with T-lynphocytes. The study of hypoxanthine (HX), xanthine (X) and uric acid (UA) in plasma would provide data on the homeostasis of the purinic enzymatic system in diseases with T cell proliferation or activation.

Preliminary data do not confirm in RRMS and psoriatic patients a change of UA concentration to controls.

The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is resulted by oxidative stress and has been shown to exert neurotoxic impacts in the brain. Protein-thiol is indicated to react with ROS, and its modification is considered to be an important mechanism of biological defense. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of L-PGDS on H2O2-induced oxidative stress in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Human L-PGDS has four Cys residues including two free thiols at Cys65 as a catalytic residue and Cys167, and a disulfide bond between Cys89 and Cys186. We purified two kinds of L-PGDS mutants such as C89A/C186A and C89A/C167A/ C186A. By the treatment with 50 lM H2O2, the amounts of free thiols in C89A/C186A and C89A/C167A/C186A decreased to 50% and 0% of the initial amounts of them, respectively, showing that H 2 O 2 reacted with the thiol of Cys65, but not that of Cys167. The MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of C89A/C167A/ C186A oxidized by H 2 O 2 showed an increase in the mass (DM = 32 Da) relative to untreated one, demonstrating that a thiol of Cys65 was oxidized to sulfinic acid. By the treatment with H 2 O 2 , cell viability of SH-SY5Y cells was decreased to 50%. In the presence of 5 lM C89A/C167A/C186A, however, the viability was recovered to about 70%. The suppression of L-PGDS expression by siRNA in SH-SY5Y cells decreased the viability by the treatment with H 2 O 2 . Further, the Kd values of untreated C89A/C167A/C186A were calculated to be 91 nM for biliverdin and 1520 nM for all-trans retinoic acid, while those of oxidized mutant were calculated to be 110 nM and 770 nM, respectively, showing that oxidized L-PGDS still had the ability to bind the ligands. These results, taken together, showed that L-PGDS could suppress the neuronal cell death by scavenging ROS at Cys65 residue without losing the function to bind hydrophobic molecules.",

This is because the amyloid hypothesis postulated that Amyloid beta (Ab) deposits are the fundamental cause of the Alzheimer disease (AD). AD has been identified as a protein misfolding disease caused by accumulation of abnormally folded Amyloid-beta peptide in the brain [3] . Objective of this study is to develop a carrier macromolecule-peptide based system against Amyloid Beta in AD. To achieve this goal, characterizing the carrier macromolecule-Ab peptide systems is the first step to obtain information about the structurefunction relationship. In the study, we have investigated the bioconjugation reactions between different Ab Peptide fragments comprising Tryptophan and different macromolecules. The bioconjugates were synthesized by using a water soluble carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) in different carboxyl activation mechanisms as well as using various peptide initial molar ratios.

Alexander Andronikashvili Institute of Physics, I. Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University Background: Attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), common to many kinds of cell/tissue injury, has been implicated in the development of ischemic stroke (IS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The intra-and extracellular redox environment is a balance between the production of ROS and their removal by antioxidants. The extracellular oxidant/antioxidant balance has been examined in plasma at the acute disease stage in timedependent manner. Methods: We studied 30 IS patients and 21 community-based healthy controls. Non-fasting venous blood was obtained within 24, 48 and 72 hours after stroke onset and at baseline for controls. We estimated the plasma activity of the main enzymatic antioxidants: catalase, SODs (superoxide dismutase), and measured the plasma concentration of Cu,ZnSOD by ELISA, and catalase quantity by Western blotting method. Besides, the total peroxides (TP) level was evaluated. Results showed that plasma catalase activity was found to be higher in IS patients at all studied time points compared with healthy controls (p = 0.0079 (24 hours); p = 0.024 (48 hours); p = 0.027 (72 hours)), what was correlated with the decreased TP level in case of IS patients. On the contrary, patients and healthy controls had the comparable SODs activity. The significantly increased plasma Cu, Zn SOD concentration was observed in case of IS patients. Conclusions: We suggest that the possible source of the increased Cu, Zn SOD quantity in IS patients is the damage of neural tissue via necrosis and apoptosis often accompanies ischemic stroke, as both Cu,Zn-SOD and mitochondrial Mn-SOD are abundant in neural tissue, and an increased expression of these enzymes can occur in response to ischemia as well. Thus, antioxidants in plasma can be not only markers of oxidative stress at IS, but also the markers of severity of brain tissue damages.",

The biological functions of various 14-3-3 proteins (alpha, beta, gamma, eta, tau, epsilon, delta, and zeta) remain unclear. However, recent work has shown that the association of 14-3-3 (eta) with AS in LBs. Herein we show how 14-3-3(eta) can modulate AS in vitro aggregation behavior, by rerouting it toward the formation of stable non-fibrillar aggregates which are normally not observed in its absence. We also show that the resulting populations of fibrillar and pre-fibrillar aggregates exhibit a modified toxicity in vivo with respect to the unperturbed aggregates. Interestingly, 14-3-3(eta) does not show any binding affinity for monomeric AS, nor for the mature fibrillar aggregates. We provide evidence that it acts on the oligomeric species which form during the amyloidogenesis process, modifying their self-assembly capabilities and ultimately changing both the process and the outcome of aggregation. We also demonstrate that 14-3-3(eta) acts as a chaperon, being able to modify the behavior of a large stoichiometric excess of amyloidogenic protein. Since 14-3-3(eta) can influence the toxicity of amyloidogenesis without perturbing the functional AS monomers, we are convinced that once fully understood, its mode of action could represent a promising model to mimic with synthetic drugs and peptides. Inflammation is essential in defence against infection or injury. However, overresponse can be detrimental, especially in immuneprivileged organs such as the central nervous system, in which microglia are the major source of inflammatory factors. Autotaxin (ATX), a phospholipase D, converts lysophosphatidylcholine into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and is upregulated in several CNS injuries. LPA, a pleiotropic immunomodulatory factor, can induce multiple cellular processes, morphology, proliferation, death and survival. Here, we investigated ATX effects on the inflammatory response to two distinct inflammatory stimuli targeting microglia. Lipopolysacharide (LPS) mimics gram negative infection, and trimethyltin (TMT), induces hippocampal neurodegeneration via the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Murine BV2 microglia and stable transfected, overexpressing ATX BV2 (BV2A+) were treated with LPS (1 lg) and TMT (10lM). ATX, TNF, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 levels were examined by qRT-PCR. LPA levels were determined. Microglial activation markers (CD11b, CD14, B7.1, B7.2) were quantified by flow cytometry. ATX expression was significantly enhanced in LPS or TMT treated BV2. LPS-induced CD11b, CD14, and B7.1 and B7.2 were reduced in BV2A+. TNF and IL-6 were inhibited in LPS or TMT treated BV2A+ while IL-10 level was increased. In vivo, elevated ATX mRNA levels in the hippocampus were demonstrated in CD1 mice 5 days following an acute ip injection of TMT (2 mg/kg bwt). With the pattern and time course of response, our results suggest an involvement of ATX in regulating microglia activation and neuroinflammation.

In 2002, the new human gene G72, encoding for the pLG72 protein, and the gene encoding for D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) have been genetically linked to the susceptibility to schizophrenia. A yeast two-hybrid screening experiment identified DAAO as a putative interacting partner of pLG72. DAAO is a FAD-containing flavooxidase that in brain is responsible for the elimination of D-serine, a co-agonist that binds to the glycine-site of the NMDA receptor. We recently demonstrated that pLG72 acts as ''inactivator'' of human DAAO (hDAAO) and that the cellular concentration of D-serine might depend on the expression of the active form of this flavooxidase. Based on these results, a molecular model for the onset of schizophrenia has been proposed: a decrease in pLG72 expression might yield an anomalous high level of hDAAO activity and therefore a decrease in the local concentration of D-serine, affecting glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptor. The characterization of the complex is a challenging task, hardly feasible by high resolution techniques. The main limit is due to pLG72 since: 1) no structural information is available; 2) it is soluble only in the presence of mild denaturant; 3) no homologous proteins have been characterized so far. In this perspective, we have used low resolution strategies based on the coupling of classical biochemistry approaches (complementary proteolysis, crosslink) with mass spectrometric techniques, to characterize the pLG72-hDAAO complex. Results indicated that hDAAO exhibits different proteolysis profiles when isolated or in complex with pLG72, thus suggesting a conformational change upon binding the effector protein. Chemical cross-linking experiments will complement the proteolysis experiments providing with details about the contact regions between hDAAO e pLG72. Hypoxia leads to massive release of neurotransmitter glutamate during ischemic stroke. Elevation of concentration of intracellular calcium via NMDA receptor under glutamate excitotoxicity results in inhibition of mitochondria function including permeability of mitochondrial transition pore, Dw loss and release of proapoptotic factors. Meanwhile, it is possible to assume direct signaling pathway linked hypoxia and mitochondria. Our aim was to study the mitochondria hypoxia sensing mechanism. We used three models: rat brain homogenates after in vivo common carotid artery occlusion, homogenates of cortex tissue slices, and mitochondria isolated from brain using Percoll density cen-trifugation. Using in vivo model we have shown that after 24 hours of occlusion in rats respiratory control index (RCI) of mitochondria was reduced from 7.7 \u00b1 0.5 to 4.5 \u00b1 0.3. The same disruption of phosphorylating system was observed in both in vitro models of hypoxia (brain slices and isolated brain mitochondria). The reduction of RCI was accompanied with increased of H 2 O 2 generation by isolated mitochondria. The effects of a modulator (glycine) and an inhibitor (MK-801) of NMDAR on mitochondrial function were studied. The depletion of RCI in both in vivo and in vitro models was effectively prevented by glycine. Generation of H 2 O 2 by mitochondria stimulated in anoxia was also significantly reduced by MK-801 (10 lM) and glycine (5 mM). We suggest that one of the possible mechanism of hypoxia sensing by mitochondria could be associated with abundance of the functional NMDA receptor in the brain mitochondria. NMDAR agonist glutamate (10-500 lM) added to isolated mitochondria in the presents of rotenon-e (inhibitor of complex I mitochondrial respiratory chain) stimulates the generation of H 2 O 2 up to threefolds. Process was significantly reduced by 10 lM MK-801 (inhibitor NMDAR) and 5 mM glycine. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which brain mitochondria could directly sense hypoxia during stroke.",

We reported an abnormally high intracellular Ca 2+ concentration (Ca 2+ ) (i) in SC from a rat model of CMT1A (CMT1A SC), caused by overexpression of the purinergic receptor P2X7. Correction of the elevated (Ca 2+ ) (i) levels by the use of P2X7 antagonists or through down-regulation of P2X7 expression restored the normal phenotype in CMT1A SC. We recently identified a new P2X7 antagonist, called P18, which is an isomer of Ap2A. P18 is also an agonist of P2Y11, the only purinergic receptor increasing the (cAMP) (i) a positive regulator of SC differentiation. Organotypic DRG cultures from both wt and CMT1A rats were treated for 3 weeks with 200 nM P18, or 1 lM A438079 (a commercially available P2X7 antagonist), or 1 mU/ml apyrase.

Therefore, P2X7 antagonist could represent a therapeutic strategy for CMT1A; the concomitant activation of P2Y11 could prove further advantageous. The ability of cells to control the balance between the generation and neutralization of reactive oxygen species is important in preventing potentially damaging effects of oxidative stress. One mechanism that cells use to maintain redox homeostasis is the antioxidant response pathway. Antioxidant response elements (AREs) are cis-acting elements located in regulatory Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that binds to the ARE and regulates the transcription of specific AREcontaining genes such as NAD(P)H, quinon-e oxidoreductase 1 and heme oxygenase. Activation of Nrf2 results in release from its negative repressor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and allows Nrf2 to translocate into the nucleus to induce gene expression. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a potent chemo protective agents, Bis (2-hydroxybenzylidene) acetone (HBB-2) on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to nitrosative stress. HBB-2 is a potent inducer of the phase 2 response through the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. When cells were incubated in culture with HBB-2, there was a significant increase in the heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis. In order to examine the protective effects of HBB-2 on peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity, SH-SY5Y cells were pre-treated with HBB-2 and then exposed to the peroxynitrite generator, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1). Pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with HBB-2 significantly showed a markedly increased resistance to SIN-1 or peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with low concentrations HBB-2, by inducing vitagenes (Hsp-70, Hsp-60, sirtuin-1, sirtuin-2, thioredoxin reductase-1, thioredoxin protein and Heme oxygenase-1) provide neuronal cells with significant cytoprotective potential which can withstand deleterious effects of oxidative and nitrosative stress. This study may have important implications for possible application of HBB-2 in neuroprotective strategies against free-radical induced damage associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.",

Vekrellis 1 1 Division of Basic Neuroscience, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, 2 Dept. of Animal and Human Physiology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens a-Synuclein (SNCA) is an abundant pre-synaptic neuronal protein that is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Recent data from our laboratory and others suggest that SNCA can be normally secreted from neuronal cells. To assess the effects of secreted SNCA on neuronal homeostasis, we used as a source of secreted SNCA inducible-SH-SY5Y cells expressing wild-type SNCA. We have shown that these cells readily secrete SNCA species (monomeric to high molecular weight forms) into their culture medium, partly via an exosome-mediated manner. Secreted SNCA forms were shown to be toxic to recipient neurons. This toxic effect did not involve the uptake of SNCA into neuronal cells. To investigate the possible mechanisms of extracellular SNCA-mediated neuronal death, we applied naturally secreted SNCA to differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. We found that such treatment altered Ca 2+ homeostasis, in recipient neuronal cells, manifested by increased Ca 2+ influx upon depletion of intracellular Ca 2+ stores with thapsigargin. This effect was SNCA dependent since immunodepletion of SNCA from the conditioned medium reduced Ca 2+ influx. The SNCA-induced Ca 2+ influx was mediated via L-type channels, since their specific inhibition with nifedipine, abolished this effect. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells incubated with nifedipine and extracellular or intracellular Ca 2+ chelators are resistant to secreted SNCA-mediated toxicity. Our data suggest that secreted SNCA is toxic to recipient neuronal cells through engagement, at least partly, of the intracellular homeostatic Ca 2+ machinery. Therefore, manipulating Ca 2+ signaling pathways mitigates extracellular SNCA toxicity and may represent a potent therapeutic target for PD.",

This pathology induces neurological complications on both nerve function and structure. Myelin is a biological membrane characterized by high lipid content and it is one of the main structures that contribute to a correct function of the nervous system. The particular characteristics of the lipids present in the myelin sheath provide the electrically insulating property required for the saltatory propagation of the nervous influx. Liver X Receptors (LXRs) belong to nuclear receptors family and they are ligand-activated transcription factors. The physiological role of LXRs is to avoid harmful concentrations of cholesterol within the cells by activating a battery of genes involved in cholesterol efflux. Besides regulating homeostasis, LXRs directly activate the expression of the lipogenic transcription factor Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a gene involved in fatty acid synthesis. Recently, it has been highlighted the role of SREBP-1c in the regulation of lipid metabolism during peripheral nerve myelination. Using streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats, an experimental model of diabetic neuropathy, we observed that LXRs activation by GW3965 (a synthetic ligand) counteracts alterations in myelin caused by diabetes by improving myelin lipid content and restoring the expression levels of all major enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. We also found that diabetes decreased thermal sensitivity and nerve conduction velocity in STZ-treated rats, parameters restored at the level of non-diabetic animals by the treatment with the LXR ligand GW3965. These results suggest that increased lipogenesis in sciatic nerve of diabetic rats may protect peripheral nerves from neuropathy. The NMDA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDAR) plays an important role in the synaptic plasticity of CNS. The unique biophysical properties of the NMDAR channel are: (i) high permeability for Ca 2+ ions and (ii) voltage-dependent block by Mg 2+ ions. As a result at voltages near rest the channels are blocked by milieu Mg 2+ ions. Only significant depolarization leads to relief from Mg 2+ block and allows Ca 2+ entry through NMDAR channels. There are many CNS pathologies, which are accompanied by the NMDAR hyperactivation. Currently a number of NMDAR channel antagonists (blockers) have been designed in order to regulate the receptors activity. Most of them, including clinically used memantine, act by binding in the NMDAR channel at a site that overlaps with the Mg 2+ binding site. However, the interaction between organic NMDAR channel blockers and Mg 2+ is often underestimated. At the present work we analyzed action of several NMDAR channel blockers under physiological concentrations of magnesium (1 mM). These compounds belong to structurally diverse groups and characterized by different voltage-dependence and mechanism of blocking action. Experiments were performed on NMDAR of hippocampus pyramidal neurons. We demonstrated that Mg 2+ significantly reduces activity and voltage dependence of block in all cases. The magnitude of the Mg 2+ effect on the action of organic blockers strongly depended on the intrinsic characteristics of the block. However, in all cases the simple competition model provided reasonable fit for the data. The data obtained are important for the understanding of the action of NMDAR blockers under physiological conditions and should be kept in mind while elaboration of new NMDAR channel antagonists for clinical use.",

Instead, lymphocytes and monocytes from AD and T2DM patients displayed similar reductions of cathepsins (Cat) B and S activity rates, and the expected down-regulated expression of the corresponding genes in AD patients was likely a consequence of decreased nuclear localization of the transcription factors TFEB and PU.1. These results point to specific mechanisms underlying the expression of lysosomal enzymes either in AD and T2DM disease. Investigation performed in CD34+HSCs revealed that mature forms of Cat S and D were exclusively detected in AD patients.

While most cases of PD occur sporadically as the result of many different environmental factors, several gene products have been identified as responsible for Mendelian forms of PD. Mutations in the parkin gene are expected to play an essential role in autosomal recessive PD. In primary skin fibroblasts from two patients affected by an early onset PD, we identified a hitherto unreported compound heterozygous mutation del exon2-3/del exon3 in the parkin gene, leading to the complete loss of the full-length protein. In both patients, but not in their heterozygous parental control, we observed severe ultrastructural abnormalities, mainly in mitochondria. This was associated with impaired energy metabolism, deregulated ROS production, resulting in lipid oxidation, and peroxisomal alteration. Changes in cellular metabolism, due to the loss of mitochondrial oxidative capacity could elicit an adaptive response by promoting a signaling pathway involving activation of CREB by cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA) phosphorylation leading to the remarkable upregulation of PGC-1a expression. However, the function of PGC-1a, a strong stimulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was blocked as revealed by the lack of its downstream target gene induction. In conclusion, this work strengthens the role of mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative stress in PD pathogenesis, highlighting the overall mitochondrial homeostasis impairment as causative of the pathological process. Our data confirm the role of parkin in mitochondrial homeostasis and suggest a potential involvement of the PGC-1a pathway in the pathogenesis of PD. Strategies to promote PGC-1a function could represent a promising therapeutic approach for the treatments of multiple forms of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

An underlying complex genetic susceptibility exists in multiple sclerosis (MS), and an association with the HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotype has been repeatedly demonstrated in high-risk (northern European) populations. It is unknown whether the effect is explained by the HLA-DRB1 or the HLA-DQB1 gene within the susceptibility haplotype, which are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). In this study, 50 MS Brazilian patients and their families, as well as 126 healthy volunteers of the overall population were investigated for alleles of HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DPB1 genes. The patients were from the Out-Patient Neurology Clinic of Hospital Universita\u00b4rio Gafre\u00b4e Guinle (UNIRIO), Hospital Univer-sita\u00b4rio Clementino Fraga Filho (UFRJ) or other accredited institutions in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood; the HLA genes were genotyped by PCR-SSP, and amplicons were resolved by 3.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. An association between the haplotype HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 and MS is being suggested, since 16% of MS patients (n=50) presented this haplotype but only 2% of the healthy control subjects (n = 126) (Two-tailed Test p < 0.001). The haplotype high frequency in MS patient group points towards its role as putative susceptibility factor for the development of the disease in this Brazilian sample. These results have been correlated not only with clinical findings but also with ethnic information. The role of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration and the temporal relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation have been investigated in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). To address these issues and identify specific targets of protein oxidation we have employed a proteomic approach coupled to quantitative determination of key metabolites in cortex tissues from mice with clinical signs of EAE. Our results show a decrease in endogenous antioxidant levels and a specific increase of glutamine synthetase (GS) oxidation with little or no evidence of immune/inflammatory cell invasion. The reduction in enzyme activity associated to GS oxidation leads to an increase of glutamate/glutamine ratio and paralleled disease severity in EAE mice. The possibility that GS oxidation may cause neurodegeneration through glutamate excitotoxicity is supported by evidence of increasing cortical Ca2+ levels in cortex extracts from animals with greater disease severity. These findings indicate that oxidative stress occurs in brain areas that are not actively undergoing inflammation in EAE and that this can lead to a neurodegenerative process due to the susceptibility of GS to oxidative inactivation.",

We also performed an in-silico analysis of the putative aldolase C interactors using the IPA software. The output predicted the putative cyclin A-aldolase C interaction. Cyclin A is involved in cell cycle progression; during neuro-differentiation cyclin A expression decreases and neurons stop dividing and start to differentiate (4). We confirmed this interaction by GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In GST pull-down experiments we incubated mouse brain and Neuro2A cell extracts with 3 baits: GST-cyclin A, GST-aldolase C and GST-aldolase C fragment (35aa C-terminal domain). We performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with total, nuclear and cytosolic extracts from Neuro2A and from mouse brain extracts using a monoclonal anti-aldolase C antibody. Our results support that aldolase C is involved in neuronal differentiation suggesting an additional role of the protein in the central nervous system In the present work we show that murine ATXN3 (ATXN3Q6) nuclear uptake is promoted by phosphorylation on serine 29, a highly conserved residue inside the Josephin domain. Both casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) are able to carry out phosphorylation on this residue. S29 phosphorylation was initially assessed in vitro on purified ATXN3Q6, and subsequently confirmed in transfected COS-7 cells, by MS analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of S29 to an alanine was shown to strongly reduce nuclear uptake, in COS-7 and SHSY-5Y transiently transfected cells overexpressing ATXN3Q6, while substitution with phospho-mimic aspartic acid restored the wild-type phenotype. Finally, treatment with CK2 and GSK3 inhibitors prevented S29 phosphorylation and strongly inhibited nuclear uptake, showing that both kinases are involved in ATXN3Q6 subcellular sorting. Although other authors have previously addressed this issue, we show for the first time that ATXN3 is phosphorylated inside the Josephin domain and that S29 phosphorylation is involved in nuclear uptake of ATXN3.",

            "text": "Effects of a calcium, magnesium and phosphate ethanolamine salt on glutathione levels and activity in chronic relapsing autoimmune encephalomyelitis Chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE-CR) is an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that represents the major cause of neurological disability among young adults. Both diseases share neurological and neuropathological alterations. MS is considered a biphasic disease, in which there is an inflammatory phase mediated by inflammatory immune cells and a neurodegenerative phase in which there is an increase of oxidative stress caused by deregulation between free radical production and the activity of antioxidant defenses. Ethanolamine plasmalogens have been reported to act as potent antioxidants that minimize membrane oxidation. Therefore, in this study we analyzed the state of the antioxidant defenses at the level of glutathione. To this aim, we evaluated the levels of total glutathione, oxidized and reduced glutathione as well as glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity. In addition, we assessed damage at the protein level, by measuring protein carbonylation. We also analyzed the possible protective effects of a calcium, magnesium and phosphate ethanolamine salt (PEA) in the hippocampus of rats with EAE-CR. The studies were carried out in the three disease states that correspond to the onset and remission of the clinical symptoms. In the CR-EAE rat hippocampus, the results obtained in the acute phase showed a decrease in reduced glutathione levels, and an increase in oxidized glutathione levels which correlated with an increased activity of glutathione peroxidase. In the remission phase, no significant changes in these parameters were detected, where as in the chronic phase, a significant increase in reduced glutathione levels and a significant decrease in oxidized glutathione levels were observed. All these values were partially or completely reversed in rat pre-treated with PEA. In conclusion this study points towards a possible protective effect of the PEA salt in EAE-CR. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system affecting prevalently white matter but also the gray matter [1] . The course of the disease is generally episodic, with frequent exacerbations interleaved with periods of remission. The relapsing-remitting phase is characterized by immune-mediated responses, such as microglial activation which in turn leads to release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2] . Although the pathogenesis of MS is not completely understood, several studies suggest that ROS contribute to the formation and persistence of MS lesions through some distinct pathological processes. As a consequence growing efforts are currently made to gain a deeper comprehension about the influence of oxidative damage in the outbreak of relapsing episode of MS and its progression. The present study aims to measure oxidative stress markers including protein carbonyl, protein nitration and lipid peroxidation.in serum from patients in relapsing as well as in remitting phase. Cases here considered have been selected from a cohort of patients attending the MS unit Centre at the INCI. Each of them had given his/her written informed consent and the study had been previously approved by the INCI local ethical committee. To keep to a minimum the bias of the patient's genetic background a case control approach was followed with each patient in remitting phase serving as control against the case of himself/ herself in the relapsing phase. The results will be presented and discussed within the context of the clinical and biochemical patient's status. Possible implications of experimental data in the development of new therapeutic approach to MS will be also discussed. In brain the flavoenzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) catabolizes D-serine, which acts as an endogenous allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors. We demonstrated that the cellular concentration of D-serine depends on the expression of active DAAO and on the presence of the inactivating interactor pLG72 (1). Genetic evidence indicates that both pLG72 and DAAO are related to schizophrenia susceptibility. We proposed a model to explain the DAAO/pLG72/D-ser association with schizophrenia: an anomalous hypoexpression of pLG72 yields to an increase of DAAO activity, then to a decrease of D-ser released at the synapse and to the hypoactivation of NMDA receptors (1). This mechanism of D-ser regulation does not match with the subcellular localizations proposed for DAAO (peroxisomes) and pLG72 (mitochondria). Here, by using U87 human glioblastoma cells transfected with plasmids encoding EYFP-DAAO and/or pLG72-ECFP fusion proteins, we provide evidence that the newly synthesized DAAO is transiently located in cytosol before being delivered to peroxisomes. Immunolocalization and FRET analyses indicate that cytosolic DAAO colocalizes and interacts with pLG72, which we propose to be on the external membrane of mitochondria. We also report that neosynthesized cytosolic hDAAO is catalytically active, and therefore pLG72 bindingand ensuing hDAAO inactivation-plays a protective role against D-ser depletion. Concerning the degradation pathways, the largest part of DAAO is degraded by the lysosomal system while pLG72 is mainly targeted to the proteasome: in cotransfected cells, pLG72 binding increases the degradation of DAAO. In conclusion, since hypofunction of NMDA receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, future pharmacological approaches may involve targeting enzymes that affect D-ser metabolism, and thus the mechanisms underlying DAAO regulation will need to be fully elucidated. i Napoli ''Federico II'', 80131 Napoli, Italy, 2 CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate, Napoli, Italy, 3 Facolta`di Scienze Biotecnologiche, Universita`di Napoli ''Federico II'', 80131 Napoli, Italy, 4 Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Universita`di Napoli ''Federico II'', 80131 Napoli, Italy DDB1 is a subunit of an eterodimeric complex (UV-DDB) that binds UV-damaged DNA and by interacting with DDB2, is involved in Global Genomic Nucleotide Excision Repair (GGNER) (1).

Cystatin B (CSTB) is an anti-protease that inhibits proteases of the cathepsin family thus protecting cellular proteins from degradation. The interest in CSTB is triggered by its involvement in progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1), a neurodegenerative disease attributes to the cstb gene mutation. CSTB in vivo has a polymeric structure susceptible to oxidationreduction and over-expression of pathological natural mutants of CSTB in neuroblastoma cells generates toxic aggregates (3). In human embryonic kidney cells Hek 293 we analyzed the aggregation pattern of endogenous human CSTB protein and of its pathological mutants after UV irradiation. We report evidence that CSTB increased its aggregation pattern after UV-treatment and we found that it interacts with DDB1, DDB2 and Cullin 4A (CUL4A) by immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments. Preliminary results showed that CSTB could be substrate of an ubiquitin E3-ligase complex substrate and that in Hek 293 cells the overexpression of CSTB or its mutants reduced the global cellular ubiquitination. Therefore, the aim of our study will be to clarify whether CSTB is substrate for an ubiquitin E3-ligase complex and whether this protein has a role in ubiquitination mechanism.

The study is performed on 10 control mice, 10 MPTP-intoxicated mice (25 mg/kg, i.p. once daily during 5 days) and 10 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned mice (unilateral stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA in the VTA, 4.5 lg/1.5 lL). MRS acquisitions are performed at 9.4Tusing a PRESS sequence (TE = 8.8 ms; TR = 4 s; 1024 scans) in a 1.56 lL voxel centered in the NAc. Metabolite levels are measured using the jMRUI software. The DA lesion in the VTA is quantified by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunolabeling. Glu, Gln and GABA levels are significantly higher in the NAc of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice than in controls. MPTP intoxication induces no change in the NAc metabolites. The number of THpositive neurons in the VTA decreases of 43% after MPTP intoxication and 60% after 6-OHDA lesion.

Dendritic spines are specialized protrusion with a pivotal role in memory and learning working as the major site of excitatory synaptic input. P140Cap is an adaptor protein able to directly bind and inhibit Src kinase and downstream signalling. We have already shown that p140Cap is highly expressed in brain, particularly in hippocampal neuron dendritic spines. Here we report that p140Cap deficient mice (p140Cap-/-) display an altered distribution of the spine density and a compromised dendritic spine morphology in hippocampal CA1 region. Interestingly P140Cap-/cultured hippocampal neurons show a reduced number of mature spines and a mis-localized F-actin staining inside to the dendritic shaft. Purified P140Cap-/-synaptoneurosomes display an increased Src kinase and Rac1 activities and a reduced RhoA activation. Moreover, in sinaptosomes P140Cap and Src kinase co-immunoprecipitate with Citron-N (CIT-N), an adaptor protein responsible to recruit active RhoA into spines. Over expression of CIT-N into rat hippocampal neurons silenced for p140Cap expression can rescue the immature filopodia phenotype due to p140Cap downregulation, whereas overexpression of CIT-N mutant unable to bind RhoA fail to rescue this phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest the importance of p140Cap, Src kinase and CIT-N cooperation in dendritic spine maintenance and synaptic plasticity.",

Searching for the molecular mechanism underlying the resistance, we have found that GSNOR-/-PCNs have a lower amount of reactive oxygen species. These data correlate with a decrease of carbonylated proteins in homogenate GSNOR-/mice brain (TB) with respect to the wt counterpart. Moreover, in GSNOR-/-PCNs and brain subcellular fractions, we detect the nuclear translocation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2 and the upregulation of the antioxidant protein DJ-1, suggesting their putative role in the enhancement of the antioxidant defence and pro-survival response to MPP+. It has been reported that DJ-1 interacts with protein kinase B (also named AKT) and their overexpression is associated with neuroprotection in experimental models of PD. Interestingly, we find that AKT is phosphorylated/activated in GSNOR-depleted experimental models suggesting a role for DJ-1/AKT system in neuroprotection. Overall, our results indicate that GSNOR depletion induces protection in MPP+ treated neurons, by means of antioxidant and pro-survival pathways activation via NO modulation. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in jj Gunn rat results from a deficiency of the hepatic bilirubin conjugating enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1, homologous to human patients with Crigler Najjar type I Syndrome and analogous to the reduced enzyme activity seen in neonates during the first days of life. The high levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in plasma can lead to the accumulation of bilirubin in the brain. The hyperbilirubinemic jj Gunn rat develop a marked cerebellar hypoplasia, with the greatest damage occurring in brain areas that mature postnatally. Recently, an effect of UCB on cell cycle progression has been described with cell cycle arrest in the late G1 phase. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cell cycle arrest in the cerebellar hypoplasia in hyperbilirubinemic jj Gunn rat. The cerebellum from hyperbilirubinemic (jj) and normal (JJ) Gunn rat at 9 days after birth was dissected and divided in two parts. The first was used to evaluated the mRNA relative expression of Cyclin A, D1, E, and Cdk2 genes using Real Time q-PCR (n = 11); and the other one to determinate the protein levels of Cdk2 and Cyclin A by quantitative Western Blot (n = 9 and n = 7 respectively). At the mRNA level, we observed a slight reduction in Cyclin D1 expression in jj rats (JJ 1.00 \u00b1 0.18 versus jj 0.80 \u00b1 0.30 NS) and a significant increase in the Cyclin E expression (JJ 1.00 \u00b1 0.34 versus jj 1.44 \u00b1 0.26, p < 0.01). The mRNA expression of Cyclin A and Cdk2 was unchanged. The protein relative expression of Cdk2 and Cyclin A was significantly reduced in jj animals (1.12 \u00b1 0.11 versus 0.84 \u00b1 0.07 p < 0.001 and 2.28 \u00b1 0.40 versus 1.81 \u00b1 0.31 p < 0.05, JJ versus jj respectively). Our in vivo study show that bilirubin arrests the cell cycle through alteration of the protein level of the Cdk2, the catalytic subunit of the cell cycle regulators, and Cyclin A. The exact point of the cell cycle at which bilirubin is acting needs to be further elucidated. Converging evidence suggests that mitochondrial damage is an early critical event in FALS, some cases of which are caused by mutated forms of the copper-dependent enzyme SOD1. The mutant proteins show higher propensity to associate with mitochondria, with respect to the wild-type one. Since the role of copper availability in the toxicity of mutant SOD1s is widely debated, we studied correlations among intracellular copper level, SOD1 cellular compartmentalization, and mitochondrial damage in neuronal cell models. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells or mouse motoneuronal NSC-34 cells were used, also over-expressing human mutant G93A SOD1, and treated with a specific copper chelator in order to achieve copper depletion. We found that this treatment induces a decrease in SOD1 activity, the occurrence of copper-free enzyme, and the enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction of SOD1. However, our findings rule out that copper deficiency may affect mitochondrial damage in cells expressing G93A SOD1. We also investigated the mechanism by which mutant SOD1s can decrease the activity of the mitochondrial copper-enzyme cytochrome oxidase (Cytox). In NSC-34 cells (either overexpressing one of three different mutant SOD1s, namely G93A, H46R, or H80R, or copper-depleted), we demonstrated that Cytox inactivation is not due to competition for the mitochondrial copper pool by mitochondrial associated mutant human SOD1, but rather to the formation of nitric oxide (NO), which binds to Cytox. This was demonstrated by the recovery of Cytox activity and the rescue of cell viability upon treatment of mutant SOD1-expressing cells with NO scavengers or NO synthases inhibitors. These results suggest a role for NO in mutant SOD1s-induced mitochondrial toxicity, and may represent a unifying mechanism for all forms of ALS.

Delayed microglial reactivity with increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression accompanied by formation of amyloid plaques occur during neurodegeneration. In area of neuronal death free transition metals are deemed to be responsible for protein misfolding and aggregation as well as for an increase of oxidative stress caused by an excess of free radicals. However a consequent analysis of the occurrence and accumulation of metals in course of time after cortical infarction was never done. In this study Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been successfully applied as a powerful imaging technique to produce quantitative images of element distributions in thin tissue sections of rat brains at different time points after cortical infarction (1 day, 5, 7, 17, 21, 42 days). Surprisingly, the never in context with neurodegeneration described transition metal titanium accumulates over the whole period of examination with the neurodegenerative incidence. In lesion unaffected brain tissue titanium is undetectable. In order to evaluate if the titanium accumulation in neurodegenerative processes after cortical infarct is due to its binding to transferrin or amyloid peptide, these proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation from native brain, the damaged cortical and thalamic areas and analyzed due to their metal binding. While titanium accumulation in damaged cortex is ascribed to transferrin and amyloid peptide binding, in thalamic neurodegeneration titanium accumulates exclusively due to amyloid peptide binding, reflecting the existence of blood-brain barrier disruption in cortical infarct. In vitro analysis confirms the capability of soluble titanium compounds to promote beta-amyloid fibrillation. Titanium is an obvious risk factor for long lasting amyloid plaque formation in neurodegenerative disorders. In the last decade, different Mendelian forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been identified. Mutations in these genes potentially lead to autosomal dominant PD or autosomal recessive PD. The PARK2 gene encodes parkin, associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, that functions as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. PARK6 encodes a protein kinase PINK1 localized in cytosol as well as in mitochondria. Recent observations suggest interaction of PINK1 and parkin in the quality control of mitochondrial proteins, autophagy and mitochondrial structural dynamics. Furthermore there is substantial evidence pointing to a critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of sporadic and early onset PD. We have characterized the mitochondrial genotype and function in a patient carrying a homozygous W437X PINK1 mutation. This resulted in mitochondrial respiratory depression which was due to loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c, associated with decreased capacity of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced cellular level of ROS. Sequence analysis of the overall mtDNA revealed coexistence of homoplasmic point mutations in the ND5 and ND6 genes of complex I. We have carried out a biochemical analysis on primary skin fibroblasts from patients carrying the following mutations in Parkin gene: ex3-4del; Cys253Tyr/ex5del; ex2del/ex2-4del. We found a significant decrease in patients' fibroblasts complex I, IV and V specific activity and a significant reduction of the uncoupled respiration rates independent of the substrate used compared with that in the controls. Cellular total ATP content, measured under basal conditions, was significantly lower in patients compared with control values. Mitochondrial dysfunction in PD patients was associated with a significant decrease in DY? and increase in ROS production. These results provide evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in PINK1 and Parkin mutant fibroblasts apparently involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson.",

            "text": "Transcriptional activation of the human aldolase C gene in transgenic mice reveals a stripe-like distribution within the cerebellum Aldolase C is the brain-specific aldolase isoenzyme. We previously identified two regions in the human Aldolase C (hAldC) gene promoter: a proximal region (-164/+1), located upstream from the main transcriptional start site, that drives low expression levels of the brain-specific aldolase C messenger, and a distal region ()1190/)164) that contains binding sites for transcriptional activators (1). The complete hAldC gene promoter region directs brain-specific LacZ expression in adult transgenic mice with a stripe-like distribution in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum thus mimicking the endogenous AldC expression pattern (2) . To determine the role of promoter regions in governing brain-and cell-specific expression of the AldC gene, we analysed three newly stabilized transgenic mice lines, obtained using different constructs including deleted promoter regions of the hAldC gene: pAldC1464-LacZ, containing the proximal region, pAldC1580-LacZ, including the proximal region and part of the distal region, and pAldC2336-LacZ, lacking the proximal region. We demonstrated, for the first time, that ?-gal is distributed in a stripe-like pattern in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum in all three mice lines. Furthermore, we found that the distal promoter region is responsible for higher expression levels of ?-gal respect to the proximal region. Also the pAldC1580-LacZ construct, containing 100 bp of the distal region, is responsible for high ?-gal expression. This distal region fragment contains a consensus sequence for a strong transcriptional activator, USF1, that we recently characterized (manuscript in preparation). Future goals will be to identify the promoter regions that include putative transcription factors responsible for the AldC stripe-like expression within the cerebellum. We have recently shown that the lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor, LSR, actively participates in the peripheral removal of apoB and apoE containing lipoproteins during the post-prandial phase. In mice with reduced LSR expression (LSR+/)) on a high-fat/cholesterol diet, atherogenic apoB containing lipoproteins are increased, accompanied by increased cholesterol in the aorta, indicating significant changes in lipid status of these animals. Members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family have been shown to play important roles in brain lipid homeostasis and neuronal function. Since changes in cholesterol -both peripheral and central -have been associated with memory and brain dysfunctions, we sought to characterize LSR expression in the brain, and to determine its potential role in lipid homeostasis in the central nervous system. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated region-specific distribution of this receptor in the brain. LSR is expressed in neurons, including the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and at the interface (ependymal cells) between brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid. In the Y-maze test which requires optimal cerebellum and hippocampus function, 18-month old LSR+/) mice exhibited significantly impaired spontaneous alternation. Interestingly, filipin labeling revealed more intensive accumulation of membrane cholesterol in the cerebellum and hippocampus of these aged LSR+/-mice, as compared to control littermates. Furthermore, LSR+/-mice placed on a high-fat diet for 6 weeks exhibited impaired spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze task, associated with increased cholesterol in the cerebellum and hippocampus. We propose then that this could modify neuronal membrane fluidity, and as a consequence lead to altered synaptic plasticity. These data suggest that LSR could play an important role in brain cholesterol homeostasis, which is particularly important in maintaining cognitive and neuronal functions during aging. Schizophrenia is a common, debilitating psychiatric disorder. Current models of schizophrenia suggest that this pathology is related to abnormalities of the glutamatergic neurotransmission; accordingly several genetic studies have identified a number of genes, (e.g., PRODH1) which protein products are related to the modulation of the glutamatergic neurotransmission, to schizophrenia susceptibility [1] . PRODH1 encodes for the mitochondrial flavoenzyme proline oxidase (PO): it catalyzes the first step of oxidation of proline to 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), a key metabolite that can be converted to glutamate. PRODH1 gene is a hot spot for mutations: 16 missense mutation have been identified, that result in mild to severe effects on PO activity [2] . Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Two key processes are neuroinflammation and axonal damage and the study of biomarkers of these two processes is fundamental to better understand the evolution of the pathology. We showed that active Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2 can be considered as early biomarker of ongoing inflammation and resolution of inflammation in MS, respectively, since they are inversely related to disease activity determined by Magnetic Resonance. Recently, the combination of Neurofilaments (Nf) and N-Acetylaspartic Acid (NAA) were identified as promising markers of axonal damage. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of Nf light, Nf heavy and NAA as biomarkers of axonal damage in Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) patients and to evaluate whether the combination of these biomarkers can provide more information on the disease severity.",

Combination of multiple environmental and genetic risk factors are thought to increase susceptibility to the development of this disease. Therefore, investigation of the polymorphisms of enzymes playing role in the metabolism of xenobiotics including drugs is of crucial importance to determine the molecular etiology of the disease. Two susceptible genes are CYP2E1, which causes oxidative stress, and NQO1, which protects cell against oxidative stress. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between CYP2E1*5B, CYP2E1*6, CYP2E1*7B and NQO1*2 polymorphisms on the risk of incidence of ischemic stroke. ] reported the functional expression of D2 receptors in boar sperm, suggesting that dopamine acts as a physiological modulator of viability, capacitation, and sperm motility. Low-concentration dopamine (100 nM and 10 lM) increased total and progressive motility of sperm, but high concentrations of dopamine (1 mM) decreased both tyrosine phosphorylation and motility in in vitro sperm capacitation assays. The presence of receptors and transporters for catecholamine could explain the effects observed at low and high doses, respectively.

Treatment of neurons with methyl-b-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol extracting agent that perturbs membrane lipid rafts (glycosphingolipid/cholesterolenriched membrane domains) proved the association of Gal-4 to these microdomains, similarly to that previously described in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, where Gal-4 was originally identified. Furthermore, treatment of neurons with sodium chlorate, which interferes with sulphate metabolism, showed that sulphated sphingolipids (sulfatides) are important for the association of Gal-4 to plasma membrane. Gal-4 and 8 were also detected in cultured primary glial cells including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia at different stages of maturation.

Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as mediators of demyelization and axonal damage in MS. DNA is probably the most biologically significant target of oxidative damage. Among numerous types of oxidative DNA damage, the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is ubiquitous marker of oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to determine 8-OHdG level in sera from patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Methods: Serum 8-OHdG levels were measured in 38 MS patients (23F/14M) with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and 37 matched healthy controls (5M/5F). The serum levels of 8-OHdG was analyzed by oxidative DNA damage ELISA kit (Highly Sensitive 8-OHdG Check, Japan Institute for Control of Aging). ELISA was performed according to the methods recommended by manufacturer. The kit had an 8-OHdG detection sensitivity range between 0.125 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Results: Mean differences in serum levels of 8-OHdG, between the patients and control group, were analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). There were no observed significant differences in 8-OHdG serum levels between MS patients and healthy controls. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze associations between EDSS index and disease duration with 8-OHdG levels.

No significant correlation was observed between serum levels of 8-OHdG and EDSS index and duration disease. The effects of central treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on memory processes and oxidative stress were examined. Stimulation of the immune system has been found to enhance, impair, or have no effect on various learning and memory tasks. LPS (3 lg/ ll and 10 lg/ll) was right-unilateral injected into the substantia nigra of adult male Wistar rats. Memory processes were studied by means of Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks. Rats given LPS were found to have significantly memory deficits in Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks compared to control groups. In addition, within Y-maze, positive correlations between behavioral deficits and indicators of oxidative stress were found. The present results suggest that activation of the immune system with LPS administration significantly impairs spatial memory processes by increasing brain oxidative stress, with relevance for the neurological abnormalities in Parkinson's disease conditions. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases are believed to be causally related to the accumulation of amyloid oligomers that exhibit a common structure and may be toxic by a common mechanism involving cell membrane permeability, eventually leading to cell death. Despite accumulating reports describing mechanisms of mem-P14 -Biochemistry of the brain and neurodegenerative disorders Abstracts brane permeabilization by oligomers in model membranes, studies directly targeted at characterizing the events occurring in biological membranes is rare. In the present report, we describe interaction of the original native structure, pre-fibrillar oligomers and fibrils of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) with mitochondrial membranes, as an in vitro biological model, with the aim of gaining insight into possible mechanism of cytotoxicity at the membrane level. These structures were first characterized using a range of techniques, including fluorescence, size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, dot blot analysis and circular dichroism. Possible permeabilization of mitochondria was explored utilizing sensitive fluorometric and luminometric assays. Results presented demonstrate release of mitochondrial enzymes upon exposure to HEWL oligomers, but not to native enzyme monomer or mature fibrils, in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, this study shows that HEWL oligomers are flexible/hydrophobic structures that confer on them the ability to interact with biological membranes. The observed release of proteins from mitochondria appear to occur by a non-specific perturbation mechanism. We believe the type of approach outlined here may provide information of major physiological significance.",

The aim of our study was to use a model of either the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury in order to evaluate neuroprotective potential of the mitochondria-targeted chimeric compounds carrying antioxidant moiety. We tested mitochondria targeted chimeric compounds consisting of either a rhodamine 19 or rhodamine B moiety linked to a plastoquinon-e molecule named SkQR1 or SkQRB correspondingly. Among all tested compounds the highest anti-ischemic efficiency was assigned to SkQR1. We found that a single i/p injection of SkQR1 at the concentration of 0.5, 1, 2 lmoles/kg before and after MCAO significantly diminishes infarct volume and improves performance of a test characterizing neurological deficit of ischemic animals in a dose-dependent mode. SkQRB did not display apparent neuroprotective properties. An analog of SkQR1 not containing plastoquinon-e (C12R19) significantly decreased neurological deficit of the ischemic animals but not infarct volume. However, SkQR1 did not reveal significant neuroprotective efficiency in the model of HI brain injury. We also found that SkQR1 ignites signaling pathways involved in ischemic tolerance. We conclude that beneficial effect of rhodamine 19 derivative of mitochondria-targeted compound SkQR1 causing significant improvement of neurological functions and decreased infarct volume may be explained by a direct antioxidative effect of the drug. However, we assume that in addition to this some other SkQR1-induced mechanisms are involved providing an ischemic tolerance to the brain.",

The inhibitory effect of HNs on the inflammatory pathway regulated by NFkB was found suggesting the differences in the AD and PDinflammatory/immune background. Cycloxygenase (COX), also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the membrane bound limiting step in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane. The implication of COX-2, the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, in the cardiac physiopathology is not clear. It is expressed in human ischemic myocardium and in dilated cardiomyopathy but it is absent in a normal heart. COX-2 knockout animals show cardiac fibrosis. Likewise COX-2 inhibition improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction in human or animal models. Contrary to the results that point, it has been demonstrated that ischemic pre-conditioning (PC) upregulates the expression and activity of COX-2 and NOS-2 in the heart mediating the protective effects of the late phase of PC. To clarify the role of COX-2 in heart, we have developed transgenic mice, which constitutively express functional human COX-2 in cardiomyocytes under the control of a-myosin heavy chain promoter. These animals do not have an apparent phenotype but are protected against ischemia/reperfusion injury, with an increased functional recovery and a diminished cellular necrosis. The pre-treatment of these animals with a specific COX-2 inhibitor reduced the cardio protective state, with a positive correlation between myocardial PGE2 levels and the degree of cell death. To further explore the phenotype of our animal model, we carried out the analysis of differential proteome from Wt or Tg cardiomyocytes. We have clustered these proteins according to their biological functional and we have observed that many of them are mitochondrial proteins.

In agreement with the results obtained after long-term exposure to L-NAME, HIF-1 a clearly accumulated in the nucleus of eNOS knock-down cells. Moreover, the NO donor DETA/NO reverted the HIF-1a accumulation induced by L-NAME treatment, confirming the dependence of HIF-1a stabilization from NO deficiency. Based on our results, we suggest that basal release of NO may act as a negative controller of HIF-1a levels and cell motility with important consequences for the endothelial cell physiology. Finally, long term L-NAME treatment induced in HUVECs a significant decrease in mitochondrial mass, confirming also in endothelial cells the central role of NO in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. We evaluted a novel approach to identify causative mutations in a large number of HCM-related and candidate genes. Four HCM patients previously analysed by DHPLC/Sanger sequencing for causative mutations in 8 sarcomeric genes were enrolled in this study. Overall, 234 genes were selected and a custom sequence capture array was designed to enrich all their coding regions and 500 bp of the flanking regions. The size of our target was 3,908,196 bp. Each DNA sample was sequenced in two independent runs by the GS FLX System. We obtained an average of 164 Mb/sample, which is equivalent to 503,775 different sequencing reads/sample with an average read length of 325.6 bp. Sequence and data analysis were performed using the Roche/454 gsMapper software. High confidence variants were blasted against the SNP database to distinguish between known and unknown variants. We found 7864 different variants, of which 6725 were intronic, 424 intergenic and 715 exonic. About 31% of the last ones were novel and 56 novel variants were in 35 HCM related genes. In all patients, we confirmed the mutations and polymorphisms previously identified in them with the DHPLC/ Sanger approach. The simultaneous analysis of a vocabulary of genes may increase the information for those patients in whom traditional screening was not adequate. Moreover, it may be possible to identify mutations responsible for clinical variability contributing to explain HCM pathogenesis. Consequently, by reducing time and costs and increasing the sensitivity of molecular testing, routine HCM molecular diagnostics could be implemented obtaining a model readily applicable to other genetic diseases. Ischemic pre-conditioning is a cardioprotective phenomenonthat involves adaptive changes in cells and molecules. This adaptation occurs in a biphasic pattern: an early phase (1-2 hours), and a late phase (12-24 hours). While it is widely accepted that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly involved in triggering ischemic pre-conditiong, it is not clear if they play a major role in the early or late phase of pre-conditioning and which are the mechanisms involved. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms behind H2O2 induced cardioprotection in cardiac cells focusing on the induction of phase II enzymes and the involvement of Nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) and Nrf2. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were grown until confluence. Preconditiong was simulated with 100 lM H2O2 for 10 min and after different times oxidative stress was generated by 100 lM H2O2 for 30 min. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT, and ROS production by 2\u00a2,7\u00a2-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate. Phase II enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically, and Nrf1 and Nrf2 nuclear translocation by immunoblotting. To evaluate the involvement in phase II enzyme induction, Nrf1 and Nrf2 were silenced with Nrf1-siRNA and Nrf2-siRNA. H2O2-pre-conditioning was more effective against oxidative stress in the late than in the early phase of adaptation. Surprisingly, H2O2-pre-conditioning led to a decrease in intracellular ROS production consistent with the induction of glutathione reductase, catalase, thioredoxine reductase and NADPH quinone oxidoreductuase 1. H2O2-pre-conditioning induced the nuclear translocation of both Nrf1 and Nrf2. The down-regulation of Nrf1 and Nrf2 by Nrf1-siRNA and Nrf2-siRNA partially inhibited the enzyme induction. These findings demonstrate a key role for Nrf1, and not only for Nrf2, in the induction of phase II enzymes following H2O2-pre-conditioning. The ubiquitously expressed sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) regulates cell volume, internal pH and a variety of cell functions, like cell adhesion and migration on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. NHE-1 is an anchoring protein for the cytoskeleton and its activity can be stimulated by integrins and other cell surface receptors. Monocyte (MC)-ECM interactions have been implicated in atherosclerosis. High ROS and atherosclerosis are common denominators in obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. Our data indicate that high glucose, insulin, endothelin, leptin and adrenaline concentrations, as well as PPARc activation (by rosiglitasone), stimulate human monocyte NHE-1 activity, cell adhesion and migration to ECM, oxLDL phagocytosis. These stimuli amplify the pro-atheromatic properties of MCs through a complex signaling net involving NHE-1, actin cytoskeleton, PI3 kinase, PKC kinase, NO synthase and NADPH oxidase. Increased ROS production by MCs can result in carbonylation of ECM proteins. MCs attached more to carbonylated laminin or collagen IV than to native forms. a2 integrin subunit was necessary for the attachment to both native and oxidized laminin and collagen. Both glucose and insulin increased a2 integrin subunit expression of MCs. b1 and b2 integrins were also important for control MCs' adhesion and migration through native ECM proteins. Attachment of endothelial cells to oxidized ECM proteins, increased the ability of MCs to attach to the endothelium. This phenomenon-has been attributed to ICAM-1 expression on the endothelium and interaction with b2 integrin subunits. Inhibition of NHE-1 by specific inhibitors inhibited MCs' differentiation to macrophages in vitro and reversed the induction of pro-atheromatic properties induced by the above stimuli. However, inhibition does not stop increased free radical (ROS) production by MCs. These observations indicate the multifaceted role of NHE-1 in MCs' contribution to the induction of atherosclerosis.",

Apocynin completely blocks the angiotensin II-stimulated collagen production, collagen I and III protein and mRNA expression. Superoxide anion production is also increased by the Cu, Znsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DETC) and decreased by the superoxide scavenger tempol in control and ANG II-treated fibroblasts. ANG II and DETC stimulate the collagen production in fibroblasts. The SOD mimetics tempol and EUK-8 as well as polyethyleneglycol-SOD reduce the collagen production. ANG II also decreases the activity and mRNA and protein expression of the mitochondrial antioxidants Mn-SOD and peroxiredoxin-3. Upon phosphorylation of Akt by ANG II, P-Akt is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and nuclear phosphorylation of FOXO3a by P-Akt leads to relocalisation of FOXO3a from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in a decrease in its transcriptional activity and in Mn-SOD expression. ANG II inactivates FOXO3a by activating Akt and this leads to a reduction in the expression of the antioxidant Mn-SOD. A role of SOD and the formed reactive oxygen species in the regulation and organization of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts is suggested. Isothiocyanates are metabolites derived from hydrolysis of glucosinolates, a class of compounds present in plants of the Brassicaceae family. Sulforaphane (SF), in particular, is an isothiocyanate produced from glucoraphanin by the enzyme myrosinase. SF is known for its chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions (1, 2) . A previous study demonstrated that SF strongly protects cardiomyocytes by oxidative stress and that this protection is partly due to the induction of a pattern of antioxidant/phase II detoxifying enzymes (3) . In order to better clarify the mechanisms underlying SF induced cardioprotection, the purpose of this study was to identify new molecular targets, by proteomic analysis. Primary cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with 5 lM SF for different times (1-48 h). The protein extracts were analyzed by 2D-PAGE electrophoresis combined with enzymatic digestion of the spots of interest, MALDI/MS of digested and identification of proteins by bioinformatics analysis. About 60 differently expressed proteins were identified, 4 of which are potentially involved in cardioprotecion. In particular, there was a significant up-regulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), glyoxalase I, elfin (CLP36) and a down-regulation of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). SF modulation of these proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies. The results suggest that the cardioprotection elicited by SF is a complex mechanism that involves the modulation of proteins with different cardioprotective role. Growing evidence supports the role of local and systemic inflammation as a common pathophysiological mechanism in cardiovascular diseases. LPS, a major component of the outer surface of Gram negative bacteria, is a potentially crucial source of inflammatory vascular injury and circulating LPS constitutes a strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. In addition, the stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by LPS induces the release of critical proinflammatory cytokines that activate strong immune responses. Alternative ligands, such as mmLDL (minimal modify LDL) can also activate TLR4. E5564 (eritoran) is a second generation synthetic lipodisaccharide designed to antagonize the toxic effects of endotoxins. To investigate the potential anti-atherosclerotic effects of E5564 we incubated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with eritoran (10nM) in presence or not of LPS (100 ng/ml) or OxPAPC, oxidized phospholipid isolated from MM-LDL, (100 lg/ml), for 6h and we analyzed cytokines expression by real time PCR and western blot. In this study we observed that administration of eritoran significantly reduced the expression of LPS induced cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, MCP1, IL6, as well as ICAM and VCAM adhesion molecules (p<0.0001) and increased both the expression and phosphorylation of eNOS. In parallel, real time PCR experiments revealed a reduction of IL-8 and IL-6 expression by oxPAPC in presence of eritoran (p<0.01). These data suggest that eritoran is potentially involved in the reduction of LPS and oxPAPC induced inflammatory rsponses in HAECs. Preliminary data also indicate that treatment with eritoran significantly reduced IkappaB phosphorylation induced by LPS, suggesting that one mechanism by which eritoran may alter the response to endotoxin in HAECs involves modulation of IkappaB phosphorylation and subsequently of NFkappaB activation.",

More importantly, we could show that systemic STAT3 inhibition significantly interfered with EAM development, dramatically reducing heart inflammation and myosin-specific IgG1 production. Thus STAT3, whose acute activity is protective in heart ischemia, acts as a pathogenic factor when improperly activated like in chronic and acute myocarditis, which represent an important cause of heart failure particularly in young adults. We suggest that the same might apply to other autoimmune diseases on inflammatory bases, via both hyper-stimulation of Th17 CD4+ T cells differentiation/activation and up-regulation of complement C3. The pro-haemostatic potential of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a large glycoprotein (240 kDa) expressed as ultra-large polymers (UL-vWF) in endothelial cells and platelets, increases with its length, which in turn is regulated by ADAMTS-13 proteolysis at the single Tyr1605-Met1606 bond in vWF. Using the minimal peptide substrate (VWF74) of vWF cleavable by ADAMTS-13, we have recently shown that in vitro oxidation of Met1606 to methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) by peroxynitrite (PN) or hypochlorous acid (HClO) severely impairs proteolysis by ADAMTS-13. Hence, we proposed a novel prothrombotic mechanism by which oxidation of Met1606, promoting accumulation of UL-vWF multimers through inhibition of their proteolysis by AD-AMTS-13, might be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathic complications in diseases associated with high oxidative stress (e.g., type 2 diabetes, renal and heart failure), where PN and/or HClO concentrations are much increased. Here we have developed a Targeted Mass Spectrometry (TMS) method capable of detecting MetSO at position 1606 of UL-vWF oxidized in vitro with PN or HClO. Our TMS approach was applied to vWF purified from patients subjected to chronic dialysis treatment (DP-vWF), a pathological setting characterized by high oxidative stress. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that in DP-vWF >10% MetSO is present at position 1606, whereas this value drops down to < 1% in vWF from healthy subjects. Finally, modelling and docking studies of the protease-vWF interaction indicate that the affinity of vWF for ADAMTS-13 is dramatically reduced due to loss of hydrophobic and specific sulfur-aromatic interactions between Met1606 of vWF and ADAM-TS-13 active site. These results provide a comprehensive molecular model for explaining the higher frequency of thrombotic complications in dialysis patients, which are also scarcely sensitive to anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs. Stroke is the third cause of death in the world and the most common cause of permanent disability, about 15% of the strokes are caused by an unstable carotid artery plaque. The carotid endoarterectomy (CEA), consisting in the surgical removal of the atheromatous plaque, notably decreases the risk of stroke, in particular in patients with severe CAS. Otherwise, in the moderate CAS, the effectiveness of CEA is decreased, in part because of the limited number of unstable plaques. The aim of this project is to study some ''innovative'' molecules, indirectly involved in the process of atherosclerosis, with the goal of detecting serum biomarkers that could be useful, for the identification of unstable plaques, in the subjects with CAS. We studied the relation between ADMA and Apelin, biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and carotid atherosclerosis, in patients with traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, focusing our attention on the evaluation of carotid intima media thickness. We found that all the patients with severe CAS showed mean values of ADMA increased in comparison to those detected in control and statistically higher, with respect to the concentrations found in the patients with pre-clinical atherosclerosis. On the contrary, we didn't observe a significant difference between the mean values of Apelin detected in patients with pre-clinical atherosclerosis, with respect to those detected in the subject with severe CAS, although a significant difference was observed comparing the same values with those of the HD. Overall this suggests a more accuracy of serum ADMA levels, to discriminate between preclinical and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The next step will be to study the behavior of ADMA and other molecules in patients with moderate CAS with the scope to find serum biomarkers, in addition to imagine techniques, to refine the identification of patients to undergo surgical intervention of CEA even in presence of moderate carotid stenosis. Background: The role of angiogenic molecules in critical lower limb ischemia (CLI) disease is still not known well. The results of currently used methods of treatment are not satisfactory. Therefore scientists are continuing to search novel and more effective methods. CLI is characterized by high, 15% mortality rate and has become the major world health problem. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to compare the profile of gene expression in popliteal artery of patients with critical limb ischemia with healthy individuals. Methods: Popliteal arteries from Hunter's canal were collected during limb amputation from 21 patients suffering from CLI and from 3 healthy donors during multi-organ transplantation. Total RNA was extracted and then reverse transcription was prepared. The analysis of gene expression was performed using TaqMan low density array method. Primers and assays were designed for 93 genes recognized as essential for angiogenesis. The results were determined by statistical analysis with the use of Ct model. Results: The analysis of gene expression demonstrated that the level of mRNA for 21 examined genes in CLI patients was increased. 16 of the 21 examined genes had been previously described as proangiogenic factors. Only 3 of them were known as inhibitors of angiogenesis. We have observed a distinct up-regulation of VEGF B, C and D isoforms in many CLI patients in comparison with the VEGF A isoform expression. The mRNA level for VEGFR (FLT-1) was similar in CLI and healthy donors. The expression of anty-angiogenic tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) and interferon beta1 (IFNB1) was increased on average 63-fold and 13.7-fold respectively. Perspectives: Our study will provide a new insight into molecular events responsible for development of critical lower limb ischemia and will improve therapeutical angiogenesis strategies. In the future we expect to apply an improved angiogenesis-based gene therapy in patients with CLI. Complement C3 is the pivotal component of three cascades of complement activation and also has immunoregulatory effects towards T-cells and B-cells differentiation and dendrite cell maturation. C3 is involved in pathological processes during atherogenic lesion formation; however, the mechanism of C3 accumulation in atheroma is not well elucidated. We have shown that acetylated and oxidized low density lipoproteins (acLDL and oxLDL) increase C3 gene expression and protein secretion by THP-1 cell derived macrophages and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. By using LXR synthetic agonist and TLR4 blocking antibodies we have shown, that modified LDL (mLDL)-mediated activation of C3 expression mainly depends on LXR and partly on TLR4, whereas C3 secretion is increased due to TLR4 activation by mLDL. We have found DR4 site inside of promoter region of human C3 gene, and EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrate that LXRbeta is bound with this site in THP-1 macrophages. Interestingly, mouse C3 promoter contains deletion in the region corresponding of human DR4 site and C3 gene expression does not increase after LXR synthetic agonist treatment in mouse peritoneal macrophages as opposite to human macrophages. We have shown that, in spite of decreased expression of C3 in alternative activated IL-4 treated human M2 macrophages, LXR synthetic agonist leads to higher level of C3 gene activation in comparison with control macrophages and this effect appears to be result of increased level of LXRbeta binding with C3 promoter in M2 macrophages. To study the consequences of increased C3 secretion by mLDL-treated macrophages we have used purified human C3a. Treatment of human macrophages with 10 nM C3a during differentiation results in increased oxLDL accumulation and augmented oxLDL-mediated stimulation of C3 expression. These data suggest novel mechanism of mLDL-mediated increase of C3 expression and secretion by macrophages in atheroma. Vascular calcification is a common complication of diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, and atherosclerosis, as well as ageing. Comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms will facilitate novel therapies. Recent studies indicate a crucial role of enzyme transglutaminase (TG2) in vascular calcification. We have previously shown that TG2-induced calcification in cultured VSMC is accompanied by activation of b-catenin signaling. Here, we present in vitro and ex vivo data on the critical requirement for TG2 in b-catenin activation under pro-calcific conditions. Further, a significant increase in TG2 levels and in transglutaminase activity was detected in the aortic rings calcify-ing in hyperphosphatemic conditions. These changes are accompanied by activation of the b-catenin signaling. Similarly, in vivo both TG2 and b-catenin signaling are activated in the calcifying arterial tissue in rat model of warfarin/vitamin K-induced elastocalcinosis. The following hallmarks of Activation of b-catenin is evidenced byprotein accumulation of b-catenin, increase in Ser-9 phosphorylated GSK-beta, and induction of the downstream targets axin2, cyclin D1, Tcf4 and NUMB. We have identified a plant bioflavonoid as a potent inhibitor of the warfarin-induced activation of TG2 and b-catenin in cultured VSMC. Daily dietary supplementation with this bioflavonoid inhibited the TG2/bcatenin signaling axis in the arterial tissue of the warfarin-treated animals and caused a 50% reduction in arterial Ca2+ accrual in rats (n = 10). In addition, bioflavonoid diet enhances expression of the VSMC markers suggesting a stabilized smooth muscle phenotype of these cells. Moreover, it reduced intrinsic age-associated Ca 2+ accrual in arterial wall over 4 week treatment (n = 8). These findings define the excess b-catenin signaling as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular calcification, and suggest a first dietary regimen for this life-threatening and debilitating disorder. The development of atherosclerosis exhibits a complex etiology and is considered to have an inflammatory component. Neopterin is released from human monocyte-derived macrophages upon stimulation with interferon-c and is thought to represent a marker of immune activation and macrophage activity. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme degrades tryptophan (Trp) to kynurenine (Kyn), suppresses T cell activity and is up-regulated by various inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we evaluated tryptophan degradation, neopterin levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in patients with coronary artery disease. Study population, which is consist of fifty-seven patients undergone to planned coronary angiography, divided into patient group having CAD confirmed by coronary angiography and control group without angiographic evidence of CAD. Tryptophan and kynurenine levels were determined by HPLC with UV detection. Neopterin levels and myeloperoxidase activities were measured with ELISA. Trp and Kyn levels did not show statistically significant difference between groups. Mean Kyn/Trp, neopterin and MPO activity of patients were higher than those of controls, but did not reach statistically significant levels. Patient group had higher high sensitive-CRP (Hs-CRP) levels than controls (p = 0.05). Kyn/Trp ratio positively correlated with neopterin, Hs-CRP levels and MPO activities (r = 0.423, p = 0.006; r = 0.544, p = 0.013; r = 0.419, p = 0.006, respectively), and Hs-CRP positively correlated with MPO activities (r = 0.424, p = 0.027) in patients.",

            "text": "The hemostasic system has a modular structure and includes several subsystems responsible for specific functions. However, control roles of individual components of these subsystems are not clear. Here, we studied blood clotting regulation using a detailed mathematical model of coagulation in a spatial reaction-diffusion system. Plasma concentrations of factor VII (FVII), factor X (FX), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and others were varied, and their effect on clotting parameters was studied. Computer simulations revealed that hemostasis appears to be very insensitive to variations of FVII concentration at high (100 pmole/m 2 ) and medium (20 pmole/m 2 ) initiating density of TF, and physiologic concentration of FVII provide maximal clot formation. Paradoxically, FVII exerts inhibitory effect at low (2 pmole/m 2 ) initiating density of TF. Increase of FX concentration first leads to reduced clotting lag time and then, at concentrations much higher than physiological ones, to reduced clot growth. Hemostasis is not sensitive to TFPI concentrations near its physiological range at TF initiating densities of 20-100 pmole/ m 2 . However, small variation of TFPI concentration causes great changes at low TF density (2-10 pmole/m 2 ). In addition, TFPI physiologic concentration provides almost the highest clot growing rate and minimal lag time thus providing optimal clot formation. In conclusion, since the physiological variations of protein concentrations do not exceed 50% of their mean values, the hemostasis system appears to be very stable with regard to these variations. Moreover, physiological concentration values of tissue pathway proteins are optimal for rapid clot formation within a wide range of activating TF densities. The study was supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research grants 09-04-00232, 09-04-00357, 09-04-92427, 09-02-00018. Cytokines and inflammatory cells have been studied individually or in small groups as potential predictors of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. However, there is a lack of information about the use of arrays of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in a well-defined group of patients that had undergone angiography to precisely define coronary artery phenotype. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of T-cell populations with myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-c and TNFa, in the circulation of patients with stable angina (SA) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A follow-up of 25 patients was evaluated at three time points (at admission before angioplasty, 30 and 180 days after) together with 33 subjects without coronary disease. IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-c and MPO were analyzed in serum by flow cytometry with a multiplex kit and TNFa by ELISA. T lymphocyte CD3, CD4 and CD8 populations were assessed by flow cytometry. At admission, SA patients had increased levels of both MPO and TNFa and diminished levels of IL-4. In AMI patients MPO, TNFa, IL-8 and IL-10 levels were increased relative to controls. In AMI, these differences attenuated after 180 days. In both SA and AMI patients, alterations in cell populations were observed: increased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased CD3+CD4+ population and increased CD3+CD8+ T-cells. A strong correlation of T-cells with IL-8 was found In AMI patients, while in SA patients T-cells were associated with IL-10. In AMI patients the pro-inflammatory action expressed by Tcells, MPO, TNF-a and IL-8 changes seems to dominate. However, in SA patients the decrease of IL-4 and the strong associations of T-cells with IL-10 and of IL-8 with TNF-a were the most evident features. The alterations of these mediators can be relevant to the evaluation of pro-and anti-inflammatory balance in the disease evolution. Platelet activation and subsequent thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury is crucial for normal haemostasis, but it can also cause myocardial infarction and stroke. This process involves a large number of surface receptors, signaling pathways, and enzymatic cascades as well as their complex interplay. A novel partner in the platelet regulatory process is the LIM and SH3 domain protein LASP-1. Originally LASP-1 was described as cytoskeleton protein that predominantly localizes at focal contacts and regulates actin dynamics. More recently it became obvious, that the LASP-1 protein is a substrate of the cAMP dependent protein kinase of the platelet inhibiting pathway as well as a substrate of the Src kinase in the platelet activating pathway. This implies an important function of LASP-1 in platelet regulation. We therefore generated a LASP-1 deficient mouse line using a gene trap approach to analyze the effects of LASP-1 deficiency on platelet function. Lasp1-/-mice are viable and show no overt phenotypic abnormalities. Nevertheless LASP-1 deficient mice display a platelet phenotype with prolonged bleeding times. This is accompanied with impaired aIIbb3 integrin activation and granule secretion as well as a decreased aggregation in response to major agonists. Our data support the hypothesis that LASP-1 is an important regulator of platelet function.",

            "text": "P15.29 (S15.1.6) Exogenous hydrogen sulfide as a modulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in rat heart Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a novel inorganic gasotransmitter in the cardiovascular system and potential regulator of important physiologic functions. The mechanism of action of H 2 S and its physiological role is not fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major cause of cardiovascular pathologies and of heart function related to aging. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening plays a significant role in induction of cell death. However, the role of H 2 S in regulation of mPTP opening is unknown. The aim of our research was study the influence of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) as a donor H 2 S on the sensitivity of Ca2+-induced mPTP opening in adult and old rat hearts. MPTP opening was determined spectrophotometrically (k = 520 nm) resulting from mitochondrial swelling. In experiments on the isolated mitochondrial was shown the effects of NaHS in the range of concentrations 10-12-10-4 mol/l. It was showed that NaHS (1, 5, 10 lmol/l) caused inhibitory effects on Ca2+-induced swelling of organelles in different degree, indicating its protective effect on the mPTP opening in adult and old rat hearts. These concentrations were almost identical to the physiological concentrations in the rat blood serum. Ca2+induced mPTP opening was partially prevented with cyclosporine A (10-5 mol/l) as classic inhibitor. In our experiments NaHS in extremely low concentrations (10-12 -10-8 mol/l) induced swelling of isolated mitochondria in the absence of Ca2+. 5-hydroxydecanoate (10-4 mol/l) as the mitochondrial KATP-channels blocker partially reduced swelling of mitochondria under low concentrations of NaHS. It was shown also the change of the sensitivity of mPTP opening to Ca2+ under the action of NaHS in adult and old rat hearts. It was concluded that H 2 S involves in the modulation of the mPTP opening in adult and old rat hearts and thus in the changing of the sensitivity of mPTP opening to its inductor. Background: During the distribution of population studied in risk prediction charts (using WHO/ISH risk prediction charts) and/or assessment of this risk for individual patient it is important to focus on intermediate risk group as last investigations showed that considerable number of subjects were reclassified from this (intermediate) group into the high-CVD risk ( \u2021 20%) group. The aim of the present investigation was an assessment of the reasons of such reclassification by focusing on blood lipid levels and their disturbances (various atherogenic indexes) as they can be considered as ''culprit'' indexes. Materials and methods: The study was designed as a substudy of CVD and CVR assessment of the Georgian population by WHO/OSH risk assessment scares. The final number of population studied was 900 after exclusion of persons with defined CVD. More then 45% of study participants who don't belong to the low risk category were in intermediate risk group. Along with Total Cholesterol (TC) LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, VLDL-C and some other indexes of atherogenesis (LDL/HDL; non-HDL/HDL; TG/ HDL; log\u00d6TG/HDL) were assessed. Results: DM subgroup has high mean levels for TC (222.04 \u00b1 16.67 mg/dl) as was in non-DM subgroup -238.8 \u00b1 10.3 mg/dl. In whole group 61.4% of persons have high TC, 38.6% -optimal. Approximately 44% of persons with optimal level of TC have LDL-C higher than 120 mg/dl; G 55.5%high levels of TG (>150 mg/dl) and VLDL-C; G 66.6% -low HDL-C (<40 mg/dl). Assessment of atherogenic indexes studied also indicated that in >50% of cases dislipoproteinemia presented. Conclusions: Intermediate risk is a transient condition that can be changed as risk factors are more effectively controlled. Persons in this risk category need more deep investigation of lipid profile even in cases of non-DM and TC optimal range. Insulin resistance is a central pathophysiological event in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). The initial cellular adaptations that precede IR are largely undefined. This study induced IR in rats, using high sucrose and investigated changes in gene expression in cardiac, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 g) were randomly divided into control (C) and sucrose-fed (SF). SF rats received 32% (w/v) sucrose in their drinking water. Both groups were fed and watered ad libitum. Plasma glucose, insulin, and triglycerides were measured every 2 weeks. At 26 weeks intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) ascertained the presence of insulin resistance. RNA was extracted and purified from cardiac, liver and skeletal muscle and used to quantify gene expression for 84 genes along the insulin signaling pathway using Real Time PCR and PCR arrays. Statistical analyses utilized repeated measures ANO-VAs for assays and t-tests for gene expression data. A p-value of >0.05 was considered significant. High sucrose feeding induced hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and IR. In the myocardium, the expression levels of Akt, ARAF1, glucokinase, hexokinase, LDL receptor, NOS2, PKCc, ribosomal protein S6, RAS, SREB1 and tyroglobulin were down regulated. In the liver, five genes were up regulated; PEPCK and GLUT4 while GLUT2 was down regulated. In skeletal muscle, docking protein 1 was up regulated while four genes, including PI3K and PKCc were down regulated. IR is associated with altered gene expression in cardiac tissue. Affected genes were related to both proximal and distal insulin signaling as well as cellular metabolism. IR simultaneously altered gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle tissues.",

It's commonly supposed that in PPP thrombin generation curve (thrombogram) has usually one peak of thrombin concentration. Here we show that thrombogram obtained from PRP can have two maximums. The causes of this phenomenon are unknown. So, we investigated effects of platelet number and degree of their activation on formation of second pick in thrombogram. Methods: Tissue factor-induced thrombin generation in PRP and PPP was monitored by standard method of Hemker using continual measurement of hydrolysis rate for thrombin specific fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC, but without additional supplementation with artificial phospholipids. Activation of platelets was defined by phosphatidylserine (PS) expression, which was measured by flow cytometry using fluorescentlylabeled annexin-V. Results: All PRP thrombograms had two thrombin peaks while the thrombograms obtained from PPP had only one. Time of achievement to the first thrombin peak was 11 \u00b1 2 (mean \u00b1 SD) minutes in PRP and 8 \u00b1 1 minutes in PPP. The second peak in PRP appeared after 18 \u00b1 7 minutes after the first one. Addition of different concentrations of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to PRP before activation of coagulation led to concentrationdependent disappearance of the second peak, insignificant first peak reduction and did not influence on the first peak time. It was also measured that PGE1 inhibited formation of the PSexpressing fraction in the suspension of platelets after thrombin stimulation. Conclusions: Results obtained demonstrate that the second peak of the PRP-thrombogram could be produced by PS-express-ing activated platelets. Further inquiry of this effect could bring us to better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of the platelet and plasma haemostasis interaction.",

Simic Molecular basis of cardiovascular disease Introduction: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, and cigarette smoking is a major contributing factor to the disease. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme plays a key role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and carcinogens present in tobacco smoke and consequent polymorphisms in this gene may confer susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. The aim of study was to determine the polymorphism of GSTM1 in patients with CHF and of corresponding control group. Materials and Methods: In case-control study there have been included 120 patients with CHF divided into four groups accord-ing to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and 69 controls. The genetic polymorphism analyses for the GSTM1 gene were determined by the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The genotype frequencies of null GSTM1 showed no significant differences among four groups patients with CHF and control group. Considering the effect of GSTM1 gene polymorphisms on the smoking-related CHF, smokers with GSTM1 null genotype had more increased risk for CHF than non-smoker with GSTM1 positive genotype (adjusted odds ratios [ aureus internalization in bMEC and the modulation of innate immunity elements. Our data showed that both SCFAs (0.25-10 mM) did not affect S. aureus growth and bMEC viability. By gentamicin protection assay (MOI 30:1) we showed that sodium propionate and sodium hexanoate reduced bacterial internalization in bMEC, which ranged 27-55% and 39-65%, respectively. On the other hand, tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) and bdefensin 5 (BNBD5) gene expression were up-regulated in response to infection. In addition, TAP expression was up-regulated by both SCFAs, while BNBD5 expression was not modified or was down-regulated. Finally, we did not detect any relationship between nitric oxide production and bacterial invasion. In conclusion, sodium propionate and sodium hexanoate decrease S. aureus internalization in bMEC and modulate TAP gene expression, which may be related to the reduction in bacterial invasion. Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular disease, but increasing evidence shows that neural cells are also affected. Growing evidence also indicates that diabetic retinopathy can be considered a low-grade chronic inflammatory disease. In the retina, the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is increased, suggesting that it may play an important role in neural dysfunction. Since IL-1beta can be synthesized and affect different cell types, our first goal was to identify the retinal cells that synthesize IL-1beta and those expressing interleukin-1 type 1 receptor (IL-1RI). Additionally, we evaluated how IL-1beta could affect the expression of IL-1RI and several synaptic proteins, and how different retinal cell types could be affected.",

            "text": "In primary retinal neural cell cultures, both retinal neurons and glial cells synthesize IL-1beta and express its receptor, but microglial cells are the main source of IL-1beta. In cell cultures exposed to IL-1beta (1-24 hours), it was observed a transient downregulation of IL-1RI. The exposure of retinal cells to IL-1beta for 24h increased the reduction of MTT, which is used as a viability or proliferative assay, by 20%, and this effect was prevented by an anti-IL-1RI antibody. Moreover, IL-1beta increased the number of CD11b-and GFAP-positive cells, suggesting that IL-1beta increases microglia (60%) and astrocyte or Muller cell (55%) proliferation. Regarding the content of synaptic proteins or neural degeneration, no significant alterations were observed. These results show that retinal microglial cells are the main producers of IL-1beta. The cytokine transiently downregulates the protein levels of IL-1RI, which may have some implications in IL-1beta signalling in retinal cells. Moreover, the increase in microglia proliferation triggered by IL-1beta may be responsible for a higher production of this cytokine, which may have an impact on retinal neuronal function. PCERA-1, a novel synthetic ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) analog, modulates production of key pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in activated macrophages. IL-10 induction and TNFa suppression are mediated via the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting that the PCERA-1 receptor is a Gs-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). As PCERA-1 and the endogenous analog C1P have distinct signaling pathways in macrophages, we proposed that PCERA-1 binds a distinct phospholipid-binding receptor, upstream of an anti-inflammatory signaling pathway. We further hypothesized that this receptor is homologous to the known sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Indeed, we identified the orphan GPCR, GPR3, as a receptor for PCERA-1. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has received increasing attention as a causative agent of multiple sclerosis (MS). In the course of an infection, the process of immune maturation requires a progressive increase in antibody affinity. It is known that neurological infectious diseases are characterized by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibodies with high-affinity against the causative agent. In this basis, to better understand the role of EBV in MS pathogenesis, the aim of our study was to evaluate the affinity distribution of CSF EBV-specific IgG in MS patients and, as controls, in patients with other inflammatory neurological disorders (OIND). CSF samples were obtained from 48 MS and from 42 OIND patients. Affinity distributions of anti-EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, as lytic marker, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) IgG, as latent marker, were measured by a modified ELISA protocol based on the employment of increasing concentrations of sodium thiocyanate. The affinity of CSF anti-EBV IgG was defined by Relative Affinity (RA) and by Affinity Ratio (AR). No differences were found in RA and AR between MS patients and OIND groups for both the antigens. Affinity demonstrated a different trend for the two antigens in both MS and in controls.",

Taken together, our results seem to exclude a causative role of EBV in MS pathogenesis as the affinity distributions of anti-EBV antibodies in MS and in controls was similar. However, we demonstrated that CSF affinity of IgG response against EBV in patients with neurological diseases was greater for the lytic rather than for the latent antigens, suggesting that VCA induces a more specific, and presumably more effective, humoral immune response. Nucleic acids (NA) interacting with pattern-recognizing receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like-(TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and dsDNA-receptors activate innate immune response, and thus the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Along with bacterial and viral NA, endogenous free and cell-surface-bound extracellular DNA (exDNA and csb-exDNA) could interact with PRRs and possess immunomodulating activity. The aim of this research is to elucidate specific immunomodulating activity of ex-DNA. A comparative study of exDNA as well as genomic and plasmid DNA on interleukin production in gingival fibroblasts (GF) has been done. All DNA tested have no effect on IL secretion in a broad concentration range (10 ng/ml-10 mkg/ml). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major constituent of bacterial outer membrane which strongly activates macrophages. Two macrophage plasma membrane receptors, CD14 and TLR4, cooperate in LPS recognition triggering synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. Excessive responses to LPS may lead to a potentially fatal condition, named sepsis. One of means to prevent uncontrolled macrophage activation by LPS may be to downregulate the cell surface level of CD14 and/or TLR4. We found that the level of TLR4 on the surface of J774 cells, as determined by radioimmunolabelling, did not change upon treatment of cells with 1-100 ng/ml LPS. However, it was reduced by 30-40% after 2 hours incubation with 1 lg/ml LPS. At these conditions the total cellular level of TLR4 was also decreased significantly, as determined by Western blotting. Simultaneously, the potency of cell activation, as measured by phosphorylation of IB and ERK1/2 decreased as well. Even stronger decrease of the",

Dynasore treatment inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of IB and ERK1/2 and TNF production. Similar results were obtained after overexpression of dynamin 2 K44A mutant suggesting that dynamine-idependent endocytosis contribute significantly to degradation of TLR4 in LPS-challenged cell. Our data indicate that downregulation of surface TLR4 can serve as a mean of negative regulation of macrophage responses toward high doses of LPS. This process engages pathway of internalization which is distinct from clathrin-and dynamin-dependent endocytosis.

In the newly-synthesized derivatives, taking into account docking studies into the ALR2 active site, the introduction of hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups on the 5-arylidene moiety appeared to be a useful strategy in order both to improve the interaction with the specificity pocket of the target enzyme and to extend the previously acquired SARs for this class of inhibitors.

The inflammatory reaction progress is a result of infectious factors action, e.g., bacterial endotoxin (LPS). In our studies we used different model and non-toxic modified thioglycosides conjugated with glycine residue, which is one of the non-sugar substituents localized in various bacterial LPS as an inherent component. Biological importance of sugar-aminoacylated structures has not been explained sufficiently because of their lability. In order to obtain stable substituted N-acetylated glycine 1-thioglycosides we prepared synthetic 1-thioglicoside derivatives of monosaccharides, e.g., D-glucose or D-galactose as well as disaccharides, e.g., lactose or maltose according to previously published reports. In our experiments the N-acetylated glycine residue was substituted to model 1-thioglycosides of Dglucose or D-galactose by using DCC/DMAP procedure. Obtained products were analyzed by TLC and NMR methods. Obtained 1-thioglycoside derivate of D-galactose substituted by N-acetyl glycine was less heterogeneous than 1-thioglycoside derivate of D-glucose.

This was demonstrated using various EBV-derived CTL epitopes demonstrating that this effect is not epitope-restricted. Furthermore, this result was confirmed using a cocktail of CTL epitopes (CEF). These in vitro evidence suggested that Tat may function in vivo as both an antigen and a novel adjuvant with the capacity to increase T cell responses. To determine the in vivo relevance of these findings, the effect of Tat on the induction of memory CTL responses was evaluated in vaccinated mice. Specifically, mice vaccinated with the Gag antigen were treated or not three months after vaccination and Gag-specific CTL responses were evaluated by IFN-gamma and IL2 Elispot assays. By this approach we found that Tat-treated mice presented Gag-specific CTL responses that were absent in untreated mice. These results demonstrate that Tat Interferon-c is homodimeric glycoprotein which protects the human body against viruses, some bacteria and even some parasites. Specifically, interferon-c induces an anti-viral state and is anti-proliferative. In addition, interferon-c has several properties related to immunoregulation. These attributes suggest that interferon-c could be a useful diagnostic tool for some diseases (biochemical marker). It is used to detect viral infections, tuberculosis, malaria, transplant rejection or atopy. Interferon-c is not only biochemical marker but also the drug. It can be used to treat multiple sclerosis or severe infections caused by atypical mycobacteria or fully resistant mycobacteria, the serious allergic dermatosis, scleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis and septic shock. The aim of this work is to develop easy, sensitive and inexpensive immunochromatographic colloidal gold-based method that would allow rapid detection of human interferon-c in plasma. Here, we present data of the development of immunochromatographic assay for determination of interferon-c. We compared different types of membranes to eliminate the matrix effect of plasma. Various antibodies against human interferon-c were tested in both, direct and indirect format. Obtained data were used to set up the lateral-flow device for the interferon-c detection. Pentraxins are essential components of the humoral arm of innate immunity. PTX3 is the prototypic long pentraxin that is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both somatic and immune cells. PTX3 exerts a major protective role in resistance to selected pathogens, such as the opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Additional functions have been described for PTX3 that place this long pentraxin at the crossroad between innate immunity, inflammation, vascular biology and female fertility [1] . This broad spectrum of activities is likely due to the modular nature of the PTX3 protein, which is made of a glycosylated Cterminal pentraxin domain and a unique N-terminal region. In addition to the multidomain organization, PTX3 shows a complex quaternary structure with eight protomer subunits assembled into high order oligomers stabilized by both covalent (i.e., disulfide bonds) and non-covalent interactions.",

Also, we have investigated the role that glycosylation plays in PTX3 biology and found that this post-translational modification substantially affects recognition of A. fumigatus and P-selectin, where masking of the latter ligand by PTX3 attenuates leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation.

In present study, we examined about anti-inflammatory action of x-3 polyunsaturated fatty acylated lipids such as 1-docosahexaenoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) in lysolecithin-induced peritoneal inflammation. First, a peritoneal administration of palmitoyllysolecithin was found to increase the level of PGE2 and 12-HETE corresponding to pro-inflammatory lipids. Additionally, the level of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5 or TNF-alpha was also enhanced, indicating that a typical inflammation was induced by palmitoyl-lysolecithin. Such inflammatory actions were also expressed by lauroyl-lysolecithin, myristoyllysolecithin, stearoyl-lysolecithin or oleoyl-lysolecithin, but not polyunsaturated fatty acylated lysolecithins. Next, when the effect of docosahexaenoyl-lysolecithin on palmitoyl-lysolecithininduced inflammation was examined, it was found that lysolecithin-induced formation of PGE2 or 12-HETE was prevented remarkably by docosahexaenoyl-lysolecithin. Compared to arachidonoyl-lysolecithin, docosahexaenoyl lysolecithin was more effective in suppressing the inflammation induced by palmitoyllysolecithin. Moreover, docosahexaenoyl-lysolecithin suppressed the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or IL-6, while the level of IL-10, corresponding to antiinflammatory lipid, was augmented remarkably. Based on these data, it is suggested that lysolecithins with x-3 polyunsaturated fatty acyl moiety may antagonize inflammatory action of lysolecithins with saturated fatty acyl chains.",

In an effort to find more effective anti-atherosclerotic agent, here we evaluated anti-inflammatory effect of 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), an HCA derivative, in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. We showed BCA more effectively inhibited NO production than HCA with less cell cytotoxicity.

We also confirmed anti-inflammatory effect of BCA in vivo. Overall, these observa-tions suggest that BCA has the potential for use as an anti-atherosclerotic agent. Mouse B lymphocytes express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) involved in regulating their development and activation. However, the molecular mechanisms of nAChR immunoregulating activity are not completely understood. We investigated the involvement of a4b2, a7 and a9(a10) nAChRs in B lymphocyte activation by using both knockout mice and selective ligands of these nAChR subtypes. By means of flow cytometry, a7 nAC-hRs were found in about 60%, while a4b2 and a9(a10) nAChRs in about 10% and 20% of mouse spleen B lymphocytes, respectively. a4b2 and a7 but not a9(a10) nAChRs, were up-regulated upon B lymphocyte activation in vitro. Flow cytometry and sandwich ELISA studies demonstrated that a7 and a9(a10) nAChRs are coupled to CD40, whereas a4b2 nAChR is coupled to IgM. B lymphocytes of both a7-/-and b2-/-mice responded to anti-CD40 stronger than those of the wild-type mice, whereas the cells of b2-/-mice responded to anti-IgM worse than those of the wild-type or a7-/-mice. Inhibition of a7 and a9(a10) nAChRs with methyllicaconitine resulted in considerable augmentation of CD40-mediated B lymphocyte proliferation in cells of all genotypes; stimulation of a4b2 nAChRs with epibatidine increased the IgM-mediated proliferation of the wild-type and a7-/-, but not b2-/-cells. Inhibition of a9(a10) nAChRs with a-conotoxin PeAI exerted weak stimulating effect on CD40-mediated proliferation. This nAChR subtype was found expressed only in mature B220+CD23+ spleen B lymphocytes and was up-regulated in a7-/-B-cells. Neither of nAChR ligands used influenced IgM to IgG class switch of B lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD40 plus IL-4. It is concluded that nAChRs regulate mainly mitogenic pathways of activated B lymphocytes: a7 nAChR fulfills inhibitory CD40-related function, a4b2 nAChR produces a stimulatory IgM-related effect, while a9(a10) nAChR is a ''reserve'' receptor, which partly compensates the absence of a7 nAChR in a7-/cells.",

            "text": "It is postulated that cold exposure can have an immunostimulating effect related to enhanced noradrenaline response and can be connected with paracrine effects. Cold is known to affect leukocyte mobilization, and it is suggested that cold exposure initiates changes in cytokine expression associated with a non-specific acute phase reaction that could be the effect of multiple interactions between the cytokines and neuroendocrine hormones. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of different sequences of whole-body cryostimulations on the level of chosen pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNFa) in healthy individuals, serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for quantitative detection of human interleukin (Human Interleukin Elisa, Bender MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria). The research involved 45 healthy men divided into three groups. The groups were subjected to 5, 10 or 20, 3 minute long whole-body cryostimulations each day at -130\u00b0C. Blood was collected for analysis before the stimulations, after completion of the whole series, and 2 weeks after completion of the series, for the examination of any long-term effect. The analysis of results showed that in response to cryostimulation, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 increased while Il-1a cytokine level decreased. Changes in the cytokine level caused by cryogenic temperatures seem to stimulate immune mechanisms in the body. It seems that the most advantageous sequence was the series of 20 cryostimulations due to the longest lasting effects of stimulation after the completion of the whole series of treatments. In dendritic cells (DC) cysteine cathepsins play a key role in antigen processing, invariant chain (Ii) cleavage, and regulation of cell adhesion following maturation stimuli. Cystatin F, a cysteine protease inhibitor is present in DC along the endocytic pathway and thus has the potential to modulate cathepsins activity. We demonstrated that, in immature DC but not in mature DC, cystatin F co-localizes with cathepsin S. Further, in lysosomes of adherent, maturing DC, a strong co-localization of cystatin F with cathepsin L was observed. The inhibitory potential of the co-localized cystatin F depends on the properties of the monomeric form. We showed that the full-length monomeric cystatin F was a 10-fold stronger inhibitor of cathepsin S than the N-terminally processed cystatin F, whereas no significant difference in inhibition was observed for cathepsins L, H and X. Therefore, the role of cystatin F in regulating the main cathepsin S function in DC, i.e. the processing of Ii, depends on the presence of the type of the monomeric form in endosomal-lysosomal vesicles. On the other hand, the intact and truncated monomeric forms of cystatin F are both potent inhibitors of cathepsin L and it is likely that cystatin F could regulate its activity in maturing adhesive DC, mediating processing of procathepsin X, which promotes cell adhesion via activation of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) integrin receptor. Fluridone is a herbicide largely utilized in agriculture for its documented absence of adverse effects on animals. The mechanism of Fluridone toxicity in plants involves inhibition of the biosynthetic pathway starting from \u00df-carotene, the precursor of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). We recently discovered that ABA is also synthesized in human inflammatory cells, where it behaves as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. Therefore, we investigated whether Fluridone could represent a new anti-inflammatory compound in human cells. The increase of the intracellular ABA concentration in TNF-a stimulated granulocytes and in LPS-challenged monocytes was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner upon pre-incubation of the cells with Fluridone (ranging between 0.5-50 lM). Moreover, Fluridone inhibited both NF-jB nuclear translocation, increase of COX-2 expression, release of pro-inflammatory mediators (PGE2, MCP-1, TNF-a) and chemotaxis in LPS-treated monocytes, and NO release, ROS production, chemotaxis and phagocytosis in fMLP-or TNF-a-challenged granulocytes. Finally, we found that 5 lM Fluridone and 100 lM Acetylsalcylic acid display the same inhibitory effect on PGE2 and MCP-1 release from LPS-treated monocytes. These results suggest that Fluridone could represent the prototype of new anti-inflammatory drugs possibly targeting human ABA biosynthesis.",

Frutalin (FTL), a lectin expressed in the breadfruit plant seeds (Artocarpus incisa), possess participation on activation and modulation of lymphocytes and neutrophils, showing that FTL could act on inflammatory states. Based on these effects, we suggest that FTL could interfere on the gastric lesion process. Acute gastric lesions were induced in mice (n = 8/group) by oral administration of EtOHabs. FTL was administered at oral doses (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/ kg) 60min before EtOHabs. 30 minutes after EtOHabs administration, animals were killed, the stomachs were removed and the area of gastric lesions was measured by planimetry. Stomachs samples were prepared for optical and force atomic analysis (AFM). EtOHabs induced severe gastric mucosal damage. FTL at all tested doses exhibited a dose-unrelated protective effect (48, 68, 44 and 43% of inhibition, respectively). It was observed, by the optical microscopy, lesion of the gastrical mucosal with evident commitment of the glandular portion and submucosal, with an intense inflammatory focus and edema. These lesions were prevented by FTL 0.5 mg/kg, and it was possible to observe the P16 -Biochemistry of immunity and inflammation Abstracts integrity of the mucosa and submucosa, suggesting an intensive gastro-protective activity of FTL. AFM analysis have confirmed the optical microscopy findings, offering, however, much more details about the glandular lesions, with evident loss of organization of epithelium and absence of villosity contours, besides the organization of glandular structures near the adjoining submucosal region (conjunctive). It can be observed the presence of edema and disorganization of collagen fibers.

TG2 has additional enzymatic activities yet, e.g. mediates signal transduction or has kinase activity, and is present in various cellular compartments. The NB4 is an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line which could be differentiated into neutrophil granulocytes with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. Recently we published that during differentiation process of NB4 cells the expression of TG2 was highly increased and down regulation of that by lentivirus mediated knock down in differentiates NB4 TG2-KD cells could cause several functional defects like delayed differentiation, lower migration, less effective adherence, lover phagocytotic ability and decreased CCL chemokine production. The aim of this work is to explore the effect of TG2 in the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced proinflammatory cytokine production of differentiated NB4cells. Upon activation of Tolllike receptors (TLRs) by ligands, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) recruits interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), which is going to lead to activation of IKKs which stimulates IjBa phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in NFjB translocation to the nucleus which stimulates gene expressions e.g. TNF-a Our working hypothesis is that the TG2 could influence the immunological functions of neutrophil granulocytes by an unrevealed mechanism. We found that the level of secreted TNF-a was lower in the case of differentiated NB4 TG2-KD cells than in NB4 cells. It was proved that only a CD14 independent MD2 dependent TLR4 mediated pathway functions in these cells and the MyD88, which is an adaptor molecule, was expressed at lower level. Degradation of IjBa that is the downstream molecule of TLR4 pathway was also impaired. All these together could lead to a hypo-inflammatory state in TG2 siRNA expressing differentiated NB4 cells.",

Moreover, it displays anti-inflammatory actions and attenuates inflammatory responses in several tissues and cell cultures. It has been reported elevated serum levels of Acrp30 in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) patients but the role of the increased levels are not yet clarified. Since COPD patients are characterized by increased serum and sputum concentrations of several cytokines (TNFa, IL-6, IL-1b), in this study we analyzed the effects of Acrp30 treatment in A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma) selected as a in vitro model of lung epithelia. Furthermore, we investigated the role of Acrp30 at two concentrations (5 and 50 lg/ml) in A549 cells treated with TNFa. We performed a viability assay (MTT test) and demonstrated that Acrp30 reduces cell viability in a dose and time dependent manner; interestingly in pre-treated cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFa, Acrp30 treatment (48 and 72 hours) is able to ameliorate the proliferation rate. We found also that the reduction of cell viability induced by Acrp30 is linked to the inhibition in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that the beneficial effects induced in co-treatment with cytokines is mediated by activation in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Our data show that Acrp30 could play a central role in the control of local lung inflammatory state and epithelial cell degeneration in lung of COPD patients, thus Acrp30 may represent a target for the development of new therapeutic approaches also in inflammatory diseases as COPD, an increasing global health problem. Bovine mammary epithelium is a target tissue for the hormone prolactin (PRL) where it mainly regulates differentiation and lactation. This tissue is involved in mastitis, which is characterized by an inflammatory response of the mammary gland. The main infectious agent causing mastitis is Staphylococcus aureus. In a previous study, we shown that bovine PRL (bPRL) stimulates S. aureus internalization in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMEC) regulating diverse host innate immune elements, many of them modulated by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB). However, it is unknown whether the activation of this transcription factor is regulated by bPRL during S. aureus internalization. The objective of this study was to determine the role of NF-jB during S. aureus internalization in bMEC stimulated with bPRL. The results showed that bPRL (5 ng/ml) induces the activation of NF-jB in bMEC; while S. aureus inhibits it in the presence of the hormone. When we blocked NF-jB activation with acetylsalycilic acid, we detected an inhibition in S. aureus internalization ( 50%) in bMEC stimulated by bPRL. The inhibition of NF-jB activation induced by infection in the presence of bPRL correlates with the down regulation in the TNF-a ( 50%) and tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP, 50%) mRNAs expression, as well as NO production in bMEC. We also detected in these conditions an inhibition in the expression of the bPRL target gene j-casein (20%). These effects are not achieved through PRL receptor (PRLR), because the mRNA expression of the long isoform was inhibited ( 50%). In conclusion, NF-jB activation in bMEC is inhibited by S. aureus in the presence of bPRL, suggesting a mechanism by which the host innate immune response may be compromised during subclinical mastitis. Introduction: Macrophages play an important role in immunogenic challenges by producing reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide (NO), and pro-inflammatory cytokines that can aggravate and propagate local inflammation. Multiple mechanisms regulate these inflammatory processes. The NF-jB and AP-1 pathways are crucial in the overexpression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as TNF-a, IL-1a or b and IL-6. It has been reported that several kind of polyphenols, which are present in beverages, vegetables and fruits, and PUFAs, which are present mainly in marine and plant seed oils, possess anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. Our aim was to assess whether polyphenols and PUFAs have synergistic anti-inflammatory effects in murine macrophages in vitro. Material and methods: Inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells was induced by LPS. The treatments with molecules were performed by co-incubation for 19 hours. A NO production assay by Griess reaction, a phosphoprotein assay by Pathscan ELISA kit and gene expression analysis using TaqMan\u00d2 Low Density Array (TLDA) for 91 genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolism, were performed to assess the synergistic antiinflammatory effects of dimeric procyanidins (B1-B4) (5 lg/ml), epigallocatechin gallate (2.5 lg/ml), resveratrol (2.5 lg/ml) and the PUFAs, DHA and EPA (30 lM). Results and Discussion: Adding B3 plus EPA and resveratrol plus EPA had synergistic effects leading to decreased NO levels; modulation of phosphoprotein levels, such as P-NF-jB p65 and P-SAPK/JNK; the downregulation of proinflammatory genes, such as interleukins, chemokines, transcription factors; and the upregulation of antioxidant genes. Therefore, these combinations have a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than either of these molecules separately in RAW macrophages.

The CD39+/CD73+ disease subset is the only one catalyzing the conversion of ADP to adenosine, in a time-and dose-dependent way. Differential CD73 expression is confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses of BM and LN biopsies, with the highest intensity scored by Ki-67+ cells within the lymph node proliferation centers, in close association with CD3+ T lymphocytes. RT-PCR data indicate that CLL lymphocytes express higher levels of a functional A2A receptor, as compared to age-matched healthy controls. Engagement of the A2A receptor by extracellular adenosine or by selective agonists is followed by (i) block of chemotaxis, (ii) increased secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 and (iii) protection from spontaneous and druginduced apoptosis. These results suggest the existence of an autocrine adenosinergic loop, active in selected CLL patients, which likely contributes to determining conditions that favour the development, maintenance and progression of the leukemia. Polyunsaturated fatty acylated lysophosphatidylcholines have been known to be anti-inflammatory in vivo. In present study, we examined about anti-inflammatory action of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE), orally administrated, in zymosan A-induced peritonitis. Oral administration of 2-docosahexaenoyl-lysoPE or 2-arachidonoyl-lysoPE was found to inhibit the plasma leakage in mice treated with zymosan A. In support of this, 2-polyunsaturated fatty acylated lysoPEs diminished the formation of LTC4, an important lipid mediator responsible for vascular permeability. Next, 2-docosahexaenoyl-lysoPE or 2-arachidonoyl-lysoPE was also found to inhibit the leukocyte extravasation into peritoneum. Consistent with this, each polyunsaturated lysoPE diminished the formation of LTB4 and 12-HETE corresponding to chemotactic factors. Additionally, the level of pro-inflammatory interleukins such as IL-1beta, IL-6 or TNF-alpha was decreased remarkably after lysoPE administration, whereas the level of anti-inflammatory interleukin, IL-10, was augmented, providing further evidences for anti-inflammatory action of 2-arachidonoyl-lysoPE or 2-docosahexaenoyl-lysoPE. Furthermore, 2-(15-HETE)-lysoPE and 2-(17-HDHE)-lysoPE, corresponding to 15-lipoxygenation product of 2-arachidonoyl-lysoPE and 2-docosahexaenoyl-lysoPE, respectively, were more potent than corresponding acylated lysoPE. Besides, the formation of LXA4 was upgraded in accordance with increasing dose of 2-arachidonoyl-lysoPE, suggesting that some part of anti-inflammatory of 2-arachidonoyl-lysoPE might be explained by pro-resolving action of lysoPE metabolite. Taken together, it is suggested that polyunsaturated lysoPEs and their lipoxygenation product could be classified as potent anti-inflammatory lipids. Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease characterised by airflow limitation and abnormal inflammatory response of lungs to noxious particles and gases. Chronic inflammation is associated with the infiltration of immune cells which release proinflammatory mediators into the lung. Beside a local inflammatory process, COPD patients are also showing systemic inflammation. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein present at the surface of most cell types, including lymphocytes, with a known activity in serum. DPP IV is a serine exopeptidase which selectively removes X-Pro dipeptide from different proinflammatory neuropeptides, chemokines, cytokines and other biomolecules, thus contributing to their functional activation or inactivation. Our goal was to correlate DPP IV activity with classic markers of inflammation in COPD patients. Materials and Methods: We obtained blood and serum samples from COPD patients (n = 106) and healthy volunteers (n = 38). DPP IV activity was determined using the spectrophotometric method with a glicyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilid as substrate. Creactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured by immunoturbidimetric assay. Total leukocyte number and proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes were determined using the Cell-Dyn 3200 hematology analyzer. Results: DPP IV activity and percentage of lymphocytes are significantly reduced, while CRP concentration, total leukocyte number and percentage of neutrophils are significantly higher in COPD patients comparing to healthy controls (p < 0.001). Furthermore, DPP IV activity is showing weak correlation with the percentage of lymphocytes (r = 0.355, p < 0.001) and weak inverse correlation with the CRP concentration (r = -0.340, p < 0.001) and total leukocyte number (r = -0.367, p < 0.001).",

            "text": "Conclusions: Decreased activity of DPP IV found in COPD patients might be a key factor contributing to the development of both local and systemic inflammation in COPD. Neutrophils are the first cells recruited to sites of inflammation, and as such are prime candidates as sensors of danger signals. Such signals are recognized by a suite of pattern recognition receptors. Though neutrophils are recently appreciated to express numerous Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members, and be key mediators of TLR-dependent immune responses, comparatively little is known about the expression and function of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in these cells. As NLRs may also be important regulators of neutrophil function, we used qPCR to determine the NLR repertoire of murine neutrophils. We find that many NLRs are expressed by these cells. The finding that NLRP1, NLRP3 and IPAF, as well as ASC and caspase-1, are expressed in neutrophils suggests these cells may be capable of signaling via these proteins through formation of caspase-1-activating platforms known as inflammasomes. Indeed, neutrophils cleave and P16 -Biochemistry of immunity and inflammation Abstracts secrete caspase-1 and the caspase-1 target, IL-1b in response to non-particulate NLRP3 activators, as well the IPAF activator, Salmonella typhimurium, indicating that the NLRP3 and IPAF inflammasomes are functional in murine neutrophils. Our findings suggest that NLRs, through their ability to sense and respond to danger signals, may be important but hitherto unappreciated regulators of neutrophil function.",

Our disease model is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that results from a dynamic balance between proliferating cells in lymphoid organs and circulating cells resisting apoptosis. This equilibrium is tuned by a set of surface molecules expressed by the CLL cell according to environmental conditions. We previously reported that CD38, a negative prognosticator, functionally associates with the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis modulating the homing process of leukemic cells both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Moreover, it seems to enhance the adhesion ability of CLL cells working in association with the CD49d integrin. Attention has now been focused on MMP-9, the main MMP expressed by CLL cells, due to the relevance of extravasation in the homing process. The final aim is to clarify whether CD38 may represent a key player, taking part to all the main steps of CLL cells recirculation. Analyzing a large cohort of CLL patients, results indicate that (i) CD38+ cells are characterized by a higher expression and activity of MMP-9; (ii) the analysis of CLL patients with a bimodal expression of CD38 indicate that the CD38+ fraction of the clone is the one expressing higher levels of MMP-9 compared to the negative one. (iii) Genetic manipulation of CLL cells indicate that de novo expression of CD38 is followed by secretion of high amounts of the active form of MMP-9. Finally, (iv) agonistic or blocking mAbs are highly effective in the modulation of MMP-9 secretion. These results support the hypothesis that CD38 is part of a molecular network that regulates the homing of CLL cells to growth permissive niches, linking the ability to migrate and invade to the poor clinical outcome of these patients. Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) play an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism, they synthesize ECM components and secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in response to stimuli. The dysregulated expression of MMPs, involved in normal tissue remodeling, is implicated in several pathological processes, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [1] . In fact, in Crohn's Disease (CD) an increase of MMPs production occurs and this induces mucosal degradation and local leukocyte recruitment. MMP-2, the most ubiquitous member of the MMP family, secreted also by ISEMFs, is up-regulated in IBD intestine leading ulceration, epithelial damage and/ or fistula formation. This MMP is sensitive to oxidative stress, and ISEMFs isolated from colon of patients with active CD exhibit an increased oxidative state, due to the decrease in the GSH/ GSSG ratio [2] . For this reason we have investigated in the culture medium of these cells the basal and stimulated MMP-2 activity. First data show an enhancement of MMP-2 activity related to the increased oxidative state present in CD patient ISEMF. In fact, the treatment of these cells with N-acetylcysteine, a GSH precursor, reduced MMP-2 activity. On the contrary, an increased activity of MMP-2 occurred in ISEMF isolated from colonic area of patients without IBD (control) and treated with buthionine sulfoximine, inhibitor of GSH synthesis. This relationship was confirmed in 18Co, a cell line derived from human colonic mucosa that exhibit many properties of ISEMFs. These data demonstrate that the increased oxidative stress involved in the pathogenesis of CD, through an excessive production of MMPs, can contribute to intestine barrier dysfunction in IBD and be in part responsible of intestinal mucosa damages. We have studied the role of fasting-stimulated Orexin-A (OXA) on the carrageenan-induced inflammatory response in the rat.",

Air pouches were induced subcutaneously in the intrascapular area and injected carrageenan on the last day of treatment. Six hours after carrageenan challenge, the contents of the air pouches were removed. The measurements were made of cell migration, chemotactic and phagocytic activities of exudate cells, iNOS and COX-2 protein expression in exudate cells, levels of nitrite/nitrate (NOx), PGE2 and TNF-a in exudates and OXA levels in plasma. Plasma OXA levels were increased significantly in inflammated animals. Pretreatment with SB-334867 had no effect compared to the fasting group. The volume and protein amount of the exudate, leukocyte infiltration and phagocytic activity of the exudate cells were significantly reduced in fasted rats. TNF-a, NOx and iNOS expression were also markedly lower in fasted animals. Chemotactic activities of exudate cells, exudate PGE2 and COX-2 expression were unchanged in fasting groups. Pretreatment with SB-334867 did not affect the alterations caused by fasting. These results indicate that fasting-stimulated OXA has no significant effect on air-pouch inflammation induced by carrageenan. Malaria is an important human zoonotic disease transmitted by arthropod vectors and caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Plasmodium falciparum infection is one of the most frequent acquired red blood cell disorders worldwide. These parasites undergo asexual multiplication within erythrocytes, causing anemia, fever, chills, nausea and, in several cases, coma and death. The spread of multi-drug-resistant strains has increased the need to identify new molecular targets for antimalarial chemotherapy. DNA topoisomerases may be considered possible candidates, due to their important role in cellular activities, including DNA replication. DNA topoisomerases alter the biological state of DNA by catalysing the breaking and rejoining of DNA strands and they are classified as type I and type II. Both are targets for antibacterial and anticancer agents. Type I topoisomerases are specifically inhibited by a natural plant alkaloid, camptothecin and its derivatives, which are known anticancer compounds actually used in clinical therapy. The Plasmodium falciparum topoisomerase I (PftopoI) is a 839 amino acids monomer enzyme encoded by a single copy gene localized in chromosome 5. The protein sequence shows a 42% identity with the human homologue and structural analysis reveals that PfTopoI contains three insertion regions when compared to human topoisomerase I (htopoI): two in the core and one in the linker domain. Previous studies have suggested that the insertion mapped in the core and in the linker domains could confer resistance to camptothecin. In this work we have studied the effect of CPT on PftopoI, to investigate how the different structure could influence the response and to propose topoiosmerase I as a critical target against malaria.",

Membrane biosynthesis is obligatory and essential during the intra-erythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the most severe human malaria parasite. Parasite membranes contain 85% of two phospholipids: phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Two enzymes of the de novo Kennedy PE and PC synthesis pathways have been identified as putative drug targets being the rate-controlling steps and essential for parasite survival. Our study focuses on CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltranferase (ECT). This enzyme is predicted to contain two cytidylyltranferase domains in numerous species however the functionality of each domain has not yet been evidenced. We established the kinetic properties of the recombinant protein in vitro and of the endogenous enzyme within the parasite. For the first time, functional characterization upon site-directed mutagenesis allowed to differentiate between the two cytidylyltransferase domains of an ECT enzyme. At the cellular level, PfECT was localized using specific antibodies and transgenic parasites were generated to analyze the phenotype of PfECT overexpression. A three-dimensional model of PfECT was built using homology modeling and was analyzed to describe the substrate binding sites and the specificities of the catalytic domains, a prerequisite for the structure-based design of pharmacological inhibitors. Together, the kinetic, cellular, and structural data resulted in new insights into the enzyme's mechanism of catalysis and its regulation.",

Rizzi 1 1 DiSCAFF -University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy, 2 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, Universita`di Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, parasitizes host macrophages. The resistance of M. tuberculosis to the innate immunity response of the host macrophage relates to the pathogens ability to impair phagosome maturation and suppress inflammasome activation by preventing the caspase-1dependent activation and production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1b. The metalloprotease Zmp1 has been proposed to play a key role in the process that M. tuberculosis developed to block phagosome maturation by suppressing caspase-1-dependent inflammasome activation (1). We have cloned, expressed, purified and biochemically characterized wild-type Zmp1 as well as the two inactive mutants H493A and E494A. We showed that Phosphoramidon, a generic Zn-dependent metalloprotease inhibitor, has an IC50 of 2.65 lM against Zmp1. Crystal structure of Zmp1 in complex with Phosphoramidon has been solved at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution and structural comparison with the Zmp1 homologous human proteins NEP and ECE-1 revealed unique features in the enzyme active site. We therefore propose that selective inhibition of Zmp1 is achievable. Furthermore, we are currently carrying out structure-based in silico docking of potential substrate peptides in order to identify possible Zmp1 host protein targets.",

The assay is based on the use of a monocytic cell line (THP-1) as the effector cell and of a non-toxic, stable and strongly fluorescent intracellular molecule (CFDA-SE, carboxyfluoresceindiacetate-succinimidyl ester) for the cytofluorimetric analysis of phagocytosis of non-parasitized, stage-separated parasitized and co-cultivated non-parasitized RBCs. Intrinsically low phagocytic activity of THP-1 cells was enhanced by pre-treatment with TNF and IFNgamma that upregulates Fc-and complement receptor expression without modifying phagocytic selectivity. Making use of this assay we assessed the percentage of phagocytically active THP-1 cells (phTHP-1), and estimated the mean number of RBCs phagocytosed by each phTHP-1 cell, a novel feature of the present method. The phagocytosis by THP-1 cells of parasitized and non-parasitized RBCs double-stained with CFDA-SE and ethidium bromide, is also presented here. The aim of the double staining was to specifically discriminate between phagocytosis of parasitized and non-parasitized RBCs both present in mixed parasite cultures. In conclusion, present method combines some potentially useful features: possibility to simultaneously quantitate phagocytosis of both parasitized and non-parasitized RBCs; usage of a easily cultivated, phagocytically potent human cell line with the same discriminatory power as human monocytes; high sensitivity which allows assay to be performed with minute amounts of parasitized and non-parasitized cells. Those features are particularly useful in studies of malarial anemia.",

With respect to prophylaxis against the Mtb, vaccination with the attenuated strain of bacillus Calmette-Gue\u00a2rin (BCG) has been used worldwide to prevent infection with TB. However, accumulating data from different clinical trials have tended to reveal its general ineffectiveness in adults. Thus, there is need for the development of more effective vaccines against Mtb. Our previous study shown that a vaccine should induce a strong cellmediated immune response, characterized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, may direct against Mtb antigens actively secreted and abundantly expressed in the early steps of infection. Regarding this point, we developed a multivalent recombinant TB vaccine (muiti-rTB) encoding the highly immunogenic Mtb culture filtrate proteins for inducing protective immunity against TB. Seven days after vaccination, guinea pig vaccinated with multi-rTB were found to have significantly higher Th1-polarized IFN-c concentrations than animal in the untreated controls. The frequencies of IL-2, IFN-c, and TNF-a producing cell were demonstrated higher than controls by flow cytometry of CD4-gated cells. Our results shown that muiti-rTB containing novel TB genes encoding 30-kDa antigen complex, 25-kDa membrane protein, 40-kDa phosphate transporters homologous, and 6-kDa early secreted antigen target protein were an effective molecules for inducing protective immunity against TB. Six weeks later, vaccinated animals were aerogenically exposed to the pathogenic 300 CFU of Mtb. The multistage strategy not only protected against initial illness, but controlled reactivation of latent infection and reduced Mtb levels in the lungs more effectively than BCG alone. Conceivably, these studies should provide evidence of the potential utility of muiti-rTB for the development of a genetically modified TB vaccine against tuberculosis.",

We have shown that Cry1Ac is induces protective immune responses against Plasmodium chabaudi AS and P. berghei ANKA infection. In this work, we analyzed whether the administration of Cry1Ac protoxin in combination with P. berghei ANKA antigen (Ag) potentiates this protection and if oxidative stress is associated with parasite clearance. Groups of CBA/ Ca mice were weekly treated with: PBS, protoxin Cry1Ac, Ag plus PBS or Ag plus Cry1Ac (Ag+Cry) during 5 weeks, 1 day after the last injection mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA, daily parasitaemia, body weight and survival were recorded. In addition, on day nine post-infection splenic mRNA was isolated retrotranscribed and analysed for qPCR using IFN-gamma specific primers, NO and catalase activity also were studied. Mice treated with Ag increased survival for 5 days while mice injected with Ag+Cry survived 8 days more compared to mice treated with PBS (control group), both groups of mice treated with Ag developed lower parasitaemias and lower spleen index compared to control group, furthermore, IFN-gamma mRNA expression was upregulated, which implies that with lower cell proliferation the better parasite elimination was attained. Mice treated with Ag+Cry developed significantly higher levels of NO and catalase specific activity in the spleen compared to control group, all this results suggest that Cry1Ac protoxin could be a potential adjuvant for a malaria vaccine. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, which could persist in an organism in the latent state for a long period of time. Abrupt reactivation of MTB into metabolicallyactive state results in exacerbation of chronic infection. Despite the progress that has been made in elucidation of TB possible mechanisms reactivation, just a little has been known about the biochemical basis of this process. Till the present time the only factor which is connected with the reactivation process has been found and thoroughly characterized. This factor is the secreting bacterial protein -Resuscitation Promoting Factor (Rpf) (Mukamolova 2006). A crystal structure of the Rpfs showed lysozymelike fold; the enzymatic activity predicted to cleave the glycosidic bond between N-acetylglucosamine and N-glycolyl muramic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. But the question of how exactly peptidoglycan hydrolysis influences the process of reactivation still remains unclear. In our recent studies it was proved that Rpfs influence the process of disaggregation of long-spread bacterial aggregates formed by mycobacteria (Nikitushkin et al. 2011). By this way Rpfs overcome physical requirements need for cell division. However, an alternative way might be in formation of the specific breakdown products of peptidoglycan: short-and long-chain muropeptides that serve as signaling molecules, initiating metabolic up-regulation. To prove this, the purified mycobacterial peptidoglycan was treated by recombinant Rpf. Formed muropeptides were collected and tested on the model cultures of mycobacteria. We found that these molecules were able to resuscitate the dormant cultures of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. In this paper, for the first time, we are reporting that muropeptides derived from Rpf-treated peptidoglycan are the signaling molecules in the process of dormant mycobacteria resuscitation. Introduction: Recently, the in vivo involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage during cerebral malaria (CM) has been suggested. Moreover, MMP-9 is induced by malaria pigment (HZ, haemozoin) in human monocytes in vitro. Here, the effects of HZ on balances between MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) are described. Methods: Cells were treated for 72 hours with different doses (6-25 lM) of native (n) or lipid-free HZ. Therefore, total gelatinolytic activity by fluorogenic gelatin conversion assay; levels of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by gelatin zymography; MMP-1, MMP-3, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 protein expression by Western blotting; and cell morphology and microtubule-like vessel formation by microscopy were studied. Results: nHZ enhanced total gelatinolytic activity by inducing de novo proMMP-9 and MMP-9 without affecting basal proM-MP-2 levels. TIMP-1 (endogenous MMP-9 inhibitor) was not altered by nHZ, whereas MMP-2 inhibitor (TIMP-2) was enhanced. Additionally, nHZ induced MMP-1 and MMP-3, two enzymes sequentially involved in proMMP-9 proteolytic activation. Cells treated with nHZ appeared elongated and were able to form microtubule-like vessels on synthetic basement membrane surfaces. Lipid-free HZ did not reproduce the effects of nHZ. Conclusions: The present data suggest that the lipid moiety of HZ alters the MMP/TIMP balances, promotes proteolytic proM-MP-9 activation, and enhances total gelatinolytic activity and cell invasiveness in HMEC-1. These findings might be useful to understand the mechanisms underlying BBB damage during CM. MMPs may be considered as candidate targets for adjuvant therapy. The maintenance of genome integrity is of vital importance for both the persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the host's infected macrophages and the reactivation of the bacillus from the dormant state [1] . Similarly to other bacteria, M. tuberculosis genome encodes for two proteins involved in protection against DNA alkylation: the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (OGT) and a putative alkyltransferase-like protein (ATL). OGT is a suicidal enzyme capable of restoring DNA integrity by transferring the alkyl group from the modified base to a conserved cysteine of its active site [2] ; on contrary, ATL, which lacks a functionally equivalent residue, does not display any enzymatic activity [3] and could behave as a damage sensor for the recruitment of other DNA repair machineries. Notably, ATLs from other species [4, 5] have been demonstrated to directly associate to the UvrA protein that participates in bacterial Nucleotide Excision Repair system [6] . In this scenario, our current investigations are aimed at elucidating the molecular bases of the biological function of M. tuberculosis OGT and ATL and analysing the M. tuberculosis UvrA protein to understand mechanistic aspects of the first steps in NER. In particular, we solved the 1.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of OGT in its ligand-free form and we produced highly homogeneous ATL to be subjected to similar analyses, enabling us to provide a structural overview of mycobacterial alkylated-DNA repair. Moreover, by means of X-ray crystallography and atomic force microscopy, we performed further structural studies on M. tuberculosis UvrA to reveal novel aspects of NER in mycobacteria.",

Following HZ/HNE treatment, two critical proteins in cell cycle regulation, p53 and p21, were increased and the retinoblastoma protein, central regulator of G1-to-S-phase transition, was consequently hypophosphorylated, while GATA-1, master transcription factor in erythropoiesis was reduced. The resultant decreased expression of cyclin A, B1 and D2 retarded cell cycle progression in erythroid cells and the K562 cell line. As a second major effect, HZ and HNE inhibited protein expression of crucial receptors: transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1, CD71), stem cell factor receptor (c-kit, CD117), interleukin-3 receptor (CD123) and erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R). The reduced receptor expression and the impaired cell cycle activity decreased the production of cells expressing glycophorin-A and hemoglobin. Present data confirm the inhibitory role of HZ, identify HNE as one HZ-generated inhibitory molecule and describe molecular targets of HNE in erythroid progenitors possibly involved in erythropoiesis inhibition in malaria anemia. c-Conglutin is a glycoprotein accounting for about 5% of the total seed proteins. Expression of c-conglutin during seed germination can be elicited by treatment with chitosan, strengthening the hypothesis of an actual role of the protein in plant defence mechanisms The protein shares high amino acid sequence identity and the conserved array of cysteines with some endo-xylanase inhibitors, namely tomato XEGIP and TAXI-I which are active, respectively, against glucanases belonging GH12 and GH11 classes. However, c-conglutin failed to inhibit representative fungal endo-glucanases and other cell wall-degrading enzymes. Based on bioinformatic analysis, the lack of inhibitory activity of c-conglutin was attributed to an amino acid deletion on the inhibitor interaction domains. To investigate this hypothesis a gene mutagenesis approach has been carried out. Two mutants have been created by PCR gene fusion to insert an amino acid stretch and two or three amino acid substitutions, respectively, with the aim to simulate the corresponding region of tomato XEGIP and TAXI-I proteins, respectively. The two mutants and the wild-type genes version have been expressed in Pichia pastoris cells and the three c-conglutins have been purified, biochemically characterized and assessed for the inhibitory capacity. The two mutants were able to inhibit only enzymes belonging to GH11 class, although with different efficiencies and at different pH conditions. The obtained results indicate that the amino acid deletion observed is indeed responsible for the lack of inhibitory activity of c-conglutin. The inserted sequence cannot, however, be considered responsible for the enzyme specificity. On the whole altogether the results indicate that c-conglutin is potentially functionally more similar to TAXI-I than to XEGIP endo-xylanase inhibitors. Those findings about fluorescent flowers have been discussed as a new possibility for pollinator perception. Betaxanthins represent a subclass of betalains that replace the anthocyanins in the order of Caryophyllales and some higher fungi. These pigments are biosynthesized by the condensation of betalamic acid and amino acids/ amines forming a Schiff-base that causes their yellow colour. The naturally occurring dopamine-betaxanthin (miraxanthin V), has been described in the species Mirabilis jalapa, Beta vulgaris, Portulaca grandiflora, Celosia argentea, and Portulaca oleracea. The presence of the two phenolic hydroxy groups in the betaxanthin derived from 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine is linked with high antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. In this work, yellow solutions of pure miraxanthin V were obtained and its stability was analysed under different conditions. The pigment was stored at different temperature and pH values, either in the presence or in the absence of light. The presence of light increased the degradation of miraxanthin V for all the pH values assayed. The free radical scavenging activity of pigment was evaluated by its effect on stable coloured solutions of radical ABTS + and its antioxidant activity was also characterized using the FRAP assay.

It occurs predominantly as arsenate, which is a phosphate analogue and can disrupt phosphate metabolism. It enters the body typically as a drinking water contaminant. Arsenate may be reduced to the more toxic arsenite by arsenate reductase activity. Evolutive pressure has led to the development of arsenic defence mechanisms in every organism. Bacteria and archea have arsenic-resistance operons, in eukaryotes arsenic detoxification involves glutationylation and methylation, but the molecular pathways of its reduction is poorly known. The fern Pteris vittata can tolerate extremely high soil arsenic concentration (up to 1500 ppm) and hyperaccumulate large amounts of the metalloid in its fronds. These qualities make P. vittata an ideal plant for phytoremediation purposes. Employing proteomic analysis [1] , with bidimensional electrophoresis and protein identification by MS/MS sequencing, we have detected the up-regulation of multiple forms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phopsphoglycerate kinase, and enolase, suggesting a central role for glycolytic enzymes in arsenic metabolism. In particular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been detected as a target enzyme for arsenic detoxification in both root and frond tissues, where it can act as an arsenate reductase. Interestingly in the frond a porin may confer arsenic resistance to the fern and may be linked to increased arsenic uptake or to arsenite efflux into the vacuole. In order to evaluate arsenate reductase in P. vittata, we have amplified PvACr2 and Pv2.5-8 cDNA from foliar total RNA, cloned and expressed the recombinant proteins in E. coli for the antibodies production. Both arsenate reductases have been detected directly in fern tissues, moreover arsenic treatment did not modify protein levels. The oxylipins formed by lipoxygenase pathway play an important role in the signaling and defense of plants against stress factors (wound healing, pest resistance and others). Lipoxygenase catalyzes the first step of conversion of linoleic and a-linolenic acids into the 9-or 13-hydroperoxides. These hydroperoxides are metabolized by enzymes of the CYP74 family of cytochromes P450, for example, divinyl ether synthases (DES) and hydroperoxide lyases (HPL). DESs catalyze the conversion of 9-or 13-hydroperoxides into corresponding divinyl ethers. Sequences of the CYP74 enzymes are very similar. However, their catalytic activity is different. Probably, there are the important amino acids defining a type of catalysis. In our work we have tried to find determinants of catalytic activity. We have compared primary amino acid sequences of the CYP74 enzymes and have revealed conservative areas and distinguishing amino acids. These sites were subjected by a site-directed mutagenesis. As a result we substituted asparagine for serine in position 289 of SRS-4 site. Mutant form of protein has been expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant mutant DES N289S was incubated with substrate -9-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid. Reaction products were identified by GC/ MS. Along with usual product -colnelenic acid -there was a new product -9-oxononanoic acid. Oxoacids generally are products of HPL reaction. Single point mutation converted DES (dehydrase) into HPL (isomerase). Thus, we can speak about presence of important amino acids in sequence of the protein whose substitution leads to alteration of catalytic properties.",

The relations between the betalain pigments structures and the spectroscopical properties they exhibit have been explored. A combined procedure for semi-synthesis and purification was applied to obtain both betaxanthins and betacyanins. Fluorescence properties of all the betalains have been investigated. Both excitation and emission spectra for the betalain molecules were obtained. In order to cover the entire range of possible wavelengths for both excitation and emission, three-dimensional fluorescence spectra were recorded for all the molecules. The influence of structural factors on the fluorescence intensity of betalains has been studied. The presence of a carboxylic group in the pigment structures leads to an enhancement of the fluorescence displayed by the pigments, and fluorescence intensity is reduced by the presence of hydroxyl groups. The results provide a full characterization of the fluorescence properties of betalains, and show fluorescence peaks centered at the corresponding maximum excitation and emission wavelengths.

Pectin stabilizes the cell wall by calcium-mediated cross-links formed by stretches of acidic demethylated homogalacturonan (HGA). We have demonstrated that by reducing the amount of acidic HGA in dicot and monocot plants through the expression of a fungal polygalacturonase or an inhibitor of pectin methylesterase, the tissue digestibility is enhanced and the need of acid pre-treatment before biomass processing is reduced. We show here that the enzymatic saccharification of the plant tissue is better in Arabidopsis mutants with a lower content of de-methylated stretches of HGA. As an alternative to genetic transformation, the natural variability can be exploited to isolate plants with low levels of unesterified HGA and improved saccharification efficiency. Cytokinins (CKs) are plant hormones involved in control of numerous important processes associated with growth and development. Plant isoprenoid CKs originate from two biosynthetic pathways resulting from prenylation of either ADP/ATP or tRNA. Because tRNA CKs were found in prokaryotic bacteria, tRNA CKs are believed to represent the first CKs in evolution and plant hormones in general. Prevailing type of plant tRNA CK is cis-zeatin (cisZ). Free cisZ and its derivatives occur in plant kingdom ubiquitously and its function is hypothesized to reside in maintaining minimal CK signaling under growth limiting conditions. However, the role of cisZ in tRNA is still unclear. Levels of cisZ derivatives in shoots and roots of plants with impaired growth conditions will be presented and their potential function(s) as well as relation to plant phenotype discussed. This work was supported Czech Science Foundation (P506/11/ 0774) and MEYS CR (LC06034). Plants, because of their intrinsic immobility, are constantly exposed to environmental agents and endogenous processes that can cause damage to DNA and genotoxic stress ultimately leading to reduced genome stability, growth and productivity. As a response to DNA damage, plants like other organisms are well equipped with checkpoint pathways of DNA damage responses (DDR) and DNA repair systems that ensure genome protection and stability essential for cell division and plant reproduction. Interestingly, while in mammalian cells DNA damage activates complex responses including apoptosis, plant cells lose the ability to divide without its activation. Therefore the connection between cell cycle control and DNA repair mechanisms results extremely important also in plants. E2F/RB pathway is one of the major players in the cell cycle control and has been shown to regulate also DNA repair. Therefore the potential involvement of E2Fs plants in the regulation of DNA damage repair is worth to be investigated. Here we describe a phenotypic characterization of E2Fs over-expressing plants and E2Fs mutants in response to x-ray and mutagenic chemicals (bleomycin and mitomycin) treatments. Preliminary results showed different sensitivity to genotoxic stress among E2Fs plants suggesting a different involvement in the control of damage response.",

The products lipoxygenase pathway -oxylipins -play important roles in plant cell signalling and defense. Great importance in their biosynthesis belongs to the CYP74 enzymes that are nonclassical cytochromes P450: allene oxide synthases (AOS), hydroperoxide lyases (HPL), divinyl ether synthases (DES). The CYP74 family is comprised of four subfamilies: the CYP74A and the CYP74B subfamilies consist mainly of allene oxide synthases and fatty acid hydroperoxide lyases, respectively; they have specificity for 13-hydroperoxides. HPLs and AOSs of the \u00d1 YP74\u00d1 subfamily have a preference, but not absolute specificity, for 9hydroperoxides. Members of the CYP74D subfamily are all divinyl ether synthases. We have identified novel oxylipins in the flax leaves whose synthesis may be associated with an unknown cascade of biochemical reactions. It is assumed that the main role in this process belongs to poorly understood enzymes -divinyl ether synthases. We have identified and cloned a gene that belongs to the CYP74 family. The n\u0131\u02c6vel enzyme was identified as CYP74B1 because it has a high homology with sequences of CYP74B enzymes -13-HPLs. Functional gene has a length of 1,419 nucleotides, and its sequence is available in GenBank under accession number HQ286277.1 (GI: 310687282). The recombinant protein has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Bio-Scale Mini Profinity IMAC columns. The enzyme preferentially utilized 13-hydroperoxide of a-linolenic acid. The product was identified by its MS, NMR and UV spectral data as the divinyl ether (9Z,11E,1\u00a2Z,3\u00a2Z)-12-(1\u00a2,3\u00a2-hexadienyloxy)-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, (x5Z)-etherolenic acid. This study showed that the novel oxylipins from flax leaves are not a result of secondary metabolism, but are compounds synthesized by specific enzymes of lipoxygenase pathway. Polar auxin transport (PAT) -an important spatial and temporal signaling mechanism in plant tissues -was thoroughly studied by various approaches. Mathematical modelling as one of these approaches has been frequently used to explore many hypotheses on cell polarization and related regulatory mechanisms, especially in plant tissues. Contrastingly auxin transport on single-cell level has remained a much less addressed subject of recent studies. We describe the transport of auxin at the cellular level using basic techniques of mathematical modelling and the characterization of auxin transport mechanisms demonstrated earlier by Delbarre et al. (1996) in tobacco cells.",

Malatya, locates in the southwest Eastern Anatolia Region, the crossroads of Central, Mediterranean, Eastern and Southeast Anatolia, is the most important apricot production region in Turkey and in the world producing 7-10% of the world's table apricots and 80-85% of dried apricots [1] . Apricot fruits are used in the production of juices, jam, compote, pestil (dried layers of fruit pulp), vinegar and dried production industries besides consuming as fruit and nuts (apricot's seed).

The samples obtained from dialysis proce-dure named partially purified enzyme were used for characterization of the apricot pectinesterase. The effect of various factors such as pH, temperature, heat and storage stability on the partially purified apricot PE enzyme was investigated. Optimum pH values were 9.0 for PE with 1% pectin in 0.1N NaCl (w/v). The optimum temperature for apricot PE was found 60\u00b0C on standard analysis conditions. Heat inactivation studies showed a decrease in enzymatic activity at temperatures above 70\u00b0C. K m and V max values 0.77 mM and 1.75 lmol/minute/mg for apricot PE. Five inhibitors were tested in the study and the most effective inhibitors were found as sodium carbonate (100% inhibition). The order of inhibitory effectiveness was: Na2CO3, iodine, lauril sulphate, AgNO3, EDTA. Thermal inactivation data indicated that apparent activation energies with pectin substrate were 2.96 kcal/mol for the enzyme.

We detected that elicitation by ergosterol increases the concentration of cytosolic calcium mainly from internal sources, but direct activation of calcium release from vacuole by ergosterol didn\u00a2t determined. D1-Piperideine-6-carboxylate dehydrogenase, also named a-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, antiquitin or simply alde-hyde dehydrogenase 7 (ALDH7) represents a member of the ALDH7 family within the ALDH protein superfamily. Antiquitin's name is derived from the supposed high age of the respective coding gene. Human and plant ALDH7 proteins show roughly 60% identity in amino acids despite the evident evolutionary distance occurring between both organisms. Such a high degree of sequence similarity between species often indicates an essential and functionally conserved role within the cell. Human antiquitin was found to metabolize a wide range of aliphatic aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes and betaine aldehyde but it is mainly connected with lysine metabolism and mediates the conversion of a-aminoadipic semialdehyde (a-AASA) to a-aminoadipate. Mutation in human ALDH7A1 gene results in the accumulation of P6C in plasma that inactivates pyridoxal 5\u00a2phosphate, an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions. The physiological function of plant antiquitin is believed to be related to a general stress response but no detailed data exist on the enzyme structure and substrate specificity. Genes coding for pea and maize antiquitin (PsALDH7 and ZmALDH7) were cloned and expressed in T7 E. coli cells. The recombinant proteins of 508 and 509 amino acids, respectively, carried an N-terminal 6xHis-tag and were successfully crystallized. The enzyme utilizes NAD+ but not NADP+ as a coenzyme and prefers a-AASA to other amino-and aliphatic aldehydes while aromatic aldehydes are not oxidized.

High capacity in cyanide detoxification is found to be accompanied with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) dependent ethylene biosynthesis during plant evolution. It becomes clear that it is the ACC-dependent cyanide rather than the cyanogenic glycosides, generates steady level of cyanide in vivo that would act as the driving force for cyanide detoxifying enzyme (CAS) speciation from the OASS family proteins. While OASS are major components in forming the cysteine synthase complex for cysteine synthesis evolved early in primitive plant species and found in various cellular compartments, we hypothesize that CAS in plants should be originated from an OASS member protein localized to mitochondria. We have conducted a survey on ACC-dependent ethylene from various plant species collected at Hong Kong countryside and found that gymnosperms and angiosperms produce ACC dependent ethylene and that ferns synthesized non-ACC dependent ethylene. Based on this survey, we further speculate that CAS speciation from OASSs following the divergence between semi-aquatic ferns and terrestrial gymnosperms. Based on the mutagenesis studies on rice OsCAS in a yeast expression system, we have also identified key amino acid residues changes in these family proteins that would lead to significant shift of OASS/CAS activity ratio and substrate preference. For example, changing valine (conserved in CASs) at position 284 on rice OsCAS to alanine (conserved in OASSs) demonstrates a significant increase in both cysteine synthesis activity and O-acetylserine affinity, but also a significant decrease in cyanide detoxification activity and cyanide affinity. CAS encoding gene sequences were also identified from collections of expressed sequence tag (EST) including 70 plant species ranging from acyanogenic and cyanogenic, lower and higher plant species.

CP plays a role in host-plant interaction, since it induces production of H2O2 and NO, programmed plant cell death, overexpression of defence genes, phytoalexin synthesis and restriction of conidia growth. Therefore, CP appears to act as PAMP able to activate effective primary defence mechanisms. CP is the founder of the ''Cerato-platanin family'', whose members are proteins involved in the microbe-host interaction, mainly acting as elicitors of plant defence. In the present study the physiological role of CP in the life style of C. platani and its role as PAMP in inducing defence responses are investigated by: (a) Gene deletion experiments. A deletion cassette for the cp gene has been obtained using the fusion PCR technique, which enable amplification of the hygromicin phosphotranspherase (hph) gene flanked by sequences of about 150 bp of the gene to be deleted. Another deletion cassette with longer flanking regions is in progress.

During the infection of a plant tissue by phytopathogenic fungi, homogalacturonan, the main component of pectin, is broken down into fragments called oligogalacturonides (OGs) by the action of fungal polygalacturonases. The interaction between polygalacturonases and their inhibitors (polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins: PGIPs) in the plant cell wall favours the formation of OGs with degree of polymerization from 10 to 15 that function as signals for the activation of the plant innate immune response. Although the effects of OGs in plant defence are well recognised, the perception/transduction mechanisms of these elicitors are still not completely described. By a 2D-DIGE approach coupled with the quantitative phospho-specific stain ProQ Diamond we studied the early events of phosphorylation in Arabidopsis thaliana in response to OGs. Soluble proteins and prefractionated total membranes were analyzed and the differential phosphorylated proteins were identified by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation changes were detected in several oxidative stress-related proteins that included heat shock proteins, jasmonate-inducible jacalin proteins and H+-ATPases, among which the vacuolar-H+ATPase encoded by DET3 gene. Phosphorilation changes were also detected in plasma membrane proteins like AtPcaP1, a plasma membrane-bounded protein involved in the cross-talk between Ca+2 signaling and PtdInsPs in the intracellular signaling pathway. Lipoxygenases (LOX, linoleate:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC1.13.11.1 2) are non-heme iron-dioxygenases that catalyze hydroperoxidation of fatty acids. In plants, the hydroperoxide are further metabolized into lipid-breakdown products as 2-nonenal. In barley and malt, LOX directly influences final sensory quality of beer. The objective of this work is to study polymorphism in LoxA gene in 21 parent varieties of Czech spring barley with different lipoxygenase activity. DNA was extracted from barley leaves by DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Quiagen). DNA concentration and purity was analyzed using agarose electrophoresis. Eight PCR markers were proposed for LoxA gene amplification. PCR products were purified and sequenced. LOX activity was analyzed by UV spectrometry at 234 nm. 2-nonenal was analyzed by gas chromatography and antioxidant activity was analyzed by Randox kit. Some of parent varieties substantially differed in LOX activity. Among these only several were used for breeding into F2 generation. Parent varieties KM 2008 and Marthe exhibited the best results with regard to extremely low thermostability of LOX from KM 2008 and excellent yields and malting characteristics of Marthe variety. Both varieties differed in point mutation (G/A) in exone 3 of LoxA gene, which was found in variety KM 2008 only. Thus, co-dominant CAPS marker was proposed for allele differentiation. PCR products were cleaved by NaeI endonuclease specific to GCCGGC sequence present in standard allele only. Thus, PCR product at size 593 bp was obtained in standard allele, while 662 bp was found in mutant allele. To verify association of LoxA mutation with phenotype, LOX activity in 40 mutant and 40 standard plants was measured. In plants with mutant allele 5-10x lower LOX activity was found. LOX activity was connected with trans-2-nonenal level as well as with antioxidant status.",

Cerato-platanin (CP) and cerato-populin (Pop1) are small proteins produced by the phytopathogenic fungi Ceratocystis platani and C. populicola, respectively. CP and Pop1 behaved as PAMPs, since they elicited typical defense responses in various host and non-host plants such as the induction of synthesis of phytoalexins and of some defence related genes. CP and Pop1 are well-structured a/b proteins with a identity of about 63%. CP structure has been solved by NMR and it is a double w-b-barrel protein. Pop1 has a similar fold but Circular Dichroism shows differences in the secondary structure between the two proteins. In order to better characterize the PAMP activity of these proteins we assayed: (i) the production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide by using specific fluorescent probes; (ii) the viability of cells determined by staining with propidium iodide and the in situ detection of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay); (iii) the expression of the genes PR5 (thaumatin), LTP (Lipid transfer protein) and APX (Ascorbate peroxidase). Assays were performed using 1.5 \u00b7 10 -4 M CP and Pop1 applied on the lower surface of plane leaves. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a hallmark of successful recognition of infection and activation of plant defences. Results indicate that either CP or Pop1 induce synthesis of H2O2, NO and hypersensitive cell death with apoptotic features which are hallmark of successful recognition of infection and activation of plant defences. H2O2 is produced after 3-6 hours of treatment and it remains constant until 24-48 hours post-treatment when the programmed cell death began. NO is produced as a spike between 6 and 9 hours when the analyzed genes are over-expressed (PR1 and APX) or underexpressed (LTP). Moreover, Pop1 effects are delayed when compared to the CP ones. The differences between CP and Pop1 effects will be interpreted in the light of structural differences, being the 3D structure of CP recently determined. The presence of phytochemicals in vegetables is of nutritional and therapeutic importance, as many of them have been found to possess strong antioxidant activity. Phenolic acids are the most widespread dietary anti-oxidants, among which caffeoylquinic acids, such as chlorogenic acid (CGA), and dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQA) stand out. Most of the proteins controlling the biosynthesis of CGA in plants have been identified and characterized; however, the mechanism underlying the synthesis of diCQAs is still unclear. In crude extracts of tomato fruits we detected an activity capable of synthesizing diCQA from CGA. According to the enzymatic reaction we hypothesize the presence of an enzyme chlorogenate: chlorogenate transferase catalysing the formation of diCQA using CGA as acyl donor. The enzymatic activity occurs predominantly in peel of tomato fruits and increases during the ripening stages, reaching the highest value (0.008 nkat/ mg) in red fruits accompanied by accumulation of diCQA. The optimum pH of the enzyme is 4.0 and a typical Michaelis Menten-saturation curve was observed with increasing substrate concentrations. Protein extracts from red tomato fruit were used to purify the enzyme through a combination of ammonium sulphate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. The protein fraction with the highest enzymatic activity (387-fold enrichment) was subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectrometric sequencing. The peptide sequence Tau GST (Glutathione S-transferase) was selected as a potential candidate gene involved in diC-QA pathway. To acquire information about the functional role of this GST gene, a Virus-induced gene silencing experiment was performed in purple Delia and Rosea tomato lines. The biochemical analyses highlighted that red-coloured Del/Ros/GST-silenced sectors contained 2.1-fold more diCQA than observed for red coloured Del/Ros silenced portions. These results suggested the involvement of this GST gene product in diCQA metabolism.",

Each of the normal, type I, and type II groups were divided into two subgroups, one of which received an intraperitoneal injection of 125 mg/kg/b.w of lyophilized chicory seed extract (20% in water) daily, for 4 weeks. Weight and FBS were measured weekly, and sera were analyzed for ALT, AST, HbA1c, nitric oxide, triglycerides and total cholesterol at the end of study time after sacrifice. A similar procedure was repeated in another set of rats for 10 days. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) along with insulin determination was performed after simultaneous injection of glucose (2 g/kg/b.w) and extract (125 mg/kg/b.w) with blood taken every 30 minute. Chicory extract prevented significant body-weight losses in both mild and severe diabetic subgroups. In mild (type II) diabetic group there was a steady decrease of blood sugar during treatment period (p < 0.05). In severe (type I) cases, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HbA1c decreased, and nitric oxide seemed to increase toward normal upon treatment. Serum insulin concentration was higher in the treated type II diabetes relative to its own control group. Unlike type I diabetes (undetectable insulin levels), GTT was greatly affected in type II diabetes: the peak of insulin moved closer to normal with respect to its timing-the maximum level of insulin (7.5 lg/l) was observed at 30 minutes for normal untreated rats, about 90 minutes in mild untreated (insulin, 6.2 lg/l) and 60 minutes in mild type II chicory treated rats (insulin, 6.8 lg/l).

Lipoxygenases (LOX) are the first enzymes of lipoxygenase pathway in plants, that catalyse the stereo-and regio-specific formation of 9-or 13-hydroperoxides unsaturated fatty acids. There are a few theories which explain the high stereo-and region specificity of LOX catalysis. All of them propose that regiospecificity is regulated by the orientation and depth of substrate entry into the active site. Currently, there are no plant LOX-substrate structures. At the same time there are structural data about soybean LOXs (including GmLOX1). This structure provides a foundation for modeling the enzyme-substrate interactions for 9-and 13-regiospecificity LOXs. In this research, we use high resolution structure of 13-specific GmLOX1 and homology modeling structure of maize 9-specific LOX (ZmLOX3) as the model proteins.",

One of the factors defining the specificity of ZmLOX3 is the binding of fatty acids carboxylate end on the protein surface. The length of carbonic chain of free fatty acid and the position of 1,4-pentadiene system are significant for correct substrate alignment in active site for 9-specific LOX. These factors do not play an important role for the regiospecificity occurrence of 13specific GmLOX1.

The active form of this vitamin, thiamine diphosphate (TDP), plays a role of essential cofactor for many major metabolic pathways. In plants, TDP determines the proper functioning of the acetyl-CoA synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, the Calvin-Benson cycle and isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway.",

A remarkable increase of expression levels was measured for the genes which encode key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine and thiazole parts of thiamine molecule (thi1 and thiC, respectively) as well for the tpk gene, coding for thiamine pyrophosphokinase, the enzyme which catalyzes TDP formation. Owing to an enhanced requirement for TDP by plants under osmotic or high salinity conditions, the expression levels of a number of TDP-dependent enzymes was also shown to increase. These include a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, transketolase and 5-phosphate 1deoxyxylulose synthase. In parallel to the gene expression response to these stressors, we also observed the increase of free thiamine, TDP and thiamine triphosphate levels. Similar changes in the rate of thiamine biosynthesis/activation process were observed in seedlings treated with abscisic acid (ABA). The analysis of plant mutants defective in ABA biosynthesis (ABA1, ABI4) confirmed the involvement of this plant hormone in the regulation of thiamine production under selected stress conditions. As the thiamine compounds were proposed to function as ''stress alarmones'' in bacteria this vitamin could play the function of stress protectant in plants and help them to survive in unfavorable environment.",

The peptides differ by a single amino acid residue and show high sequence similarity to Raphanus sativus L. defensins Rs-AFP1 and Rs-AFP2. The Ns-D1 and Ns-D2 defensins display strong although divergent antifungal activity towards a number of phytopathogenic fungi. Two novel highly homologous defensins, Sm-AMP-D1 and Sm-AMP-D2, were isolated from seeds of common chickweed Stellaria media L. (family Cariophyllaceae). They show sequence homology to defensins of the Brassicaceae plants and display strong inhibitory activity against phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes in the micromolar range. From the annual weed barnyard grass Echinochloa crusgalli (L.)

The maize isoenzyme ZmCKO1 comprises eight potential N-glycosylation sites in its primary structure. Recent crystal structures show that at least six of them may be occupied. However, structural and functional aspects of the carbohydrate chains have not yet been investigated. A recombinant ZmCKO1 from Yarrowia lipolytica was subjected to an enzymatic deglycosylation. The enzyme treated under non-denaturing conditions showed a decreased activity as well as thermostability demonstrating the physiological importance of the carbohydrate chains. N-glycans liberated under denaturing conditions were purified by chromatography and measured on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with 6-azathiothymine as a matrix. Several structures belonging to high-mannose type N-glycans were confirmed by collision-induced tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) on a Q-TOF instrument with electrospray ionization (ESI). Tryptic digests of ZmCKO1 were prepared to analyze whole N-glycopeptides by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The digests were separated on a reverse phase and detected on the Q-TOF machine. In CID Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) is one of the most important plant crops and a model system to study development and ripening of fleshy fruit. The membrane system is very important for all biological processes; for example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus play a pivotal role in the secretion of proteins and in the synthesis of the non-cellulosic portion of the cell wall. The aim of this work was to characterize the membrane proteome profile of tomato fruit at the ''mature green'' ripening stage. Total microsomes were prepared and separated by centrifugation through a iodixanol continuous gradient. The organelle distribution pattern (plasma membrane, ER, Golgi, chloroplast, nucleus) was determined using known markers of these compartments. Proteins were identified using a combination of 1-D SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. After electrophoresis, each lane was cut into 14 pieces, digested with trypsin and analyzed by nano-HPLC coupled to an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. More than 2400 different proteins were identified, for which the Arabidopsis homologue was searched and subjected to GO analysis to determine the represented biological process, molecular function and subcellular localization. GO term enrichment analysis confirmed the enrichment in membrane proteins. This large scale proteomic analysis provides a detailed reference map of the membrane proteome at specific stages of tomato fruit development and a background for comparison of physiological processes such as ripening or biotic and abiotic stresses. The lipoxygenase pathway of fatty acids metabolism plays a fundamental role in plant development and resistance. Crucial enzymes of this pathway are cytochromes P450 of CYP74 family comprised of allene oxide synthases (AOS), hydroperoxide lyases (HPL) and divinyl ether synthases (DES). We chose model object -maize -to perform entire characteristics of all CYP74 enzymes within one species. We compared two databases (www.maizesequence.org and NCBI) to find as much as possible maize CYP74 sequences. Altogether we found eight CYP74 genes and two genes previously described as CYP84. However, translated amino acid sequences of these genes are very similar to CYP74 family and strongly distinguish from classical P450 sequences. We performed initial characteristics of these sequences and referred them as following: two isoforms of ZmAOS1, three isoforms of ZmAOS2, ZmHPL1, ZmHPL2 and two isoforms of ''CYP84'' genes. Two genes ZmAOS1 and ZmHPL1 we already cloned into pET51b(+) vector and obtained bacterial producers on the basis of E. coli. We obtained pure preparations of recombinant enzymes and performed their catalytic characteristics. ZmAOS1 is classical 13-AOS with 13-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid and allene oxide as substrate and product, respectively. ZmHPL1 is HPL with preference for 13hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid and unusual set of products dependent on substrate. Two isoforms of ZmAOS2 are localized subsequently on the first chro-mosome and have few substitutions thus confirming our hypothesis of origin of the CYP74 family diversity because of gene duplication and random point mutations. Earlier we rendered the process of point mutations appearance by site-directed mutagenesis of representatives of all CYP74s types: AOS, HPL and DES. Unique substitutions of sequences converted AOS and DES into HPL but not vice versa thus confirming evolutional origin of CY74 enzymes existing diversity from unique ancestor possessing HPL activity.",

A. lividus was collected from Bartin, Turkey. The stems with leaves and flowers of A. lividus were extracted in boiling water. The extract was filtered and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator. Male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 served as control and received the respective vehicles only. Group 2 received CCl4 (1.5 ml/kg as a 50% olive oil i.p.) on the 10th day. Group 3 and 4 were treated with two different doses of the water extract (250 and 500 mg/kg respectively, p.o.) and Group 5 was treated with silymarin (25 mg/kg p.o.) once daily for 9 days and CCl4 (1.5 ml/kg as a 50% olive oil i.p.) on the 10th day. 24 hours after CCl4 administration, the animals were sacrificed, their blood was collected and sera separated. Livers were dissected out and used for biochemical studies. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment of rats with A. lividus extract significantly prevented the increased activity of MPO in liver and the elevation of hepatic MDA formation as well as protected the liver from GSH depletion. A. lividus pretreatment also slightly increased CCl4-induced altered PON and ARE activities in serum. The activity of the extract was comparable to the standart drug, silymarin. Our results demonstrate that A. lividus has a protective effect against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, which may be due to both the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and the increase of antioxidant activity.",

In this work we have focused on heme b containing catalase-peroxidases (KatGs). The fungus expresses an intracellular KatG most likely located in peroxisomes (MagKatG1) as well as an extracellular variant that is secreted and might participate in host-pathogen interaction. Recombinant MagKatG1 and MagKatG2 have been expressed heterologously in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. We report UV-Vis and resonance Raman spectra of the ferric and ferrous forms as well as the standard reduction potential of the Fe(III)/ Fe(II) couple of both metalloproteins. Kinetic parameters of both catalase and peroxidase activities are reported probing several artificial one-and two electron donors at different pH. Both described KatGs differed slightly in their pH optima for both catalatic and peroxidatic reactions. For probing the peroxidatic reaction mode several (artificial) one and two electron donors (ascorbate, ABTS, 5-amino salicylic acid, L-DOPA, o-dianisidine, guaiacol, resorcinol, catechol, pyrogallol, luminol, tyrosine, tetramethylbenzidine and halides) were tested since the natural substrate is unknown. In addition ligand binding and reaction of the ferric enzymes with various hydrogen peroxide and peroxoacetic acid concentrations were tested by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Similarities and differences between these two KatGs and homologous heme peroxidases will be discussed and related to a putative role of KatG2 in plant-pathogen interaction. Chicoric acid, dicaffeoyl tartaric acid, was first isolated from aerial parts of plant chicory (Cichorium intybus). It is also present in the plant seeds.

In the present study, the human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells were used to investigate the possible toxicity of chicoric acid and compare it to chicory seed water extract. HepG2 cells (2 \u00b7 10 4 ) were seeded in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere. Different concentrations of chicoric acid (0-1.4 mg/ml final concentration) were added to the cells in quadruplicate. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The approximate weight of seed extract containing an equivalent amount of chicoric acid was estimated by HPLC, and parallel experiments were conducted for the whole chicory seed extract as well (0-5 mg/ml of a lyophilized product of heated 20% solution of ground chicory seeds in water).

During the past two decades substantial amount of work has been done to develop matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, but without much success. The main reason for the limited success is not a lack of potent inhibitors, but rather incomplete understanding of the function of these enzymes, and lack of specific and selective MMP inhibitors relative to proteins with similar active site architecture. It is therefore important to identify the structural determinants of weak and strong inhibitor binding to the MMPs. This study explores the interaction of ABT-a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor and matrix metalloproteinases by docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies. The MD trajectories were analysed and the free energies of binding were calculated and correlated with experimentally determined binding energies.

First is to discover and process the genetic factors of diseases and second one is to deliver the therapeutic genes or materials to the concerned site. For the second purpose solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can be used as a delivery system for gene therapy. However, only some fixed parameters examined about complexation between SLN and plasmid DNA (pDNA). Whereas, these parameters characterize the complex suspension more than complex's itself. Polidispersity index, gel electrophoresis and the more importantly particle size distribution are better parameters to understand complex's characteristics. Since these parameters analysed together, it can be seen if there are uncomplexed or incompact particles that affect the mean size and zeta potantial of suspension. SLNs were developed by modified microemulsion dilution technique using stearic acid as matrix lipid, Tween 80 as surfactant and ethanol as co-surfactant, distilled water as dispertant. Ester-quate1 and stearylamine was incorporated into the formulation as charge carrier. SLN-DNA complexes were prepared by mixing pDNA (pIRES-EGFP) solution and cationic SLN suspension at different rates. When the amounts of SLN in the complex suspension increased, mean particle size decreased approximetly from 100 nm to 30 nm. In addition, zeta potential showed increasing values from )10 mV to +20 mV. However, the amount of free uncomplexed particle is also increasing proportionally. Optimal rate of complexation was also confirmed by TEM analysis and agarose gel electhrophoresis. Finally, optimal complex was selected and tested as a transfection agent on mammalian cell culture (COS-7) and found that it has transfection ability with low cytotoxicity. Lichens represent a source of compounds unique in nature formed by symbiosis between fungi and green algae or cyanobacteria to fulfill their nutritional requirements. Artanorin is a lichenic secondary metabolite. Atranorin has antibiotic, antinociceptive and antiinflammatory actions. Also it exhibited antiproliferative effects against malignant cell lines. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from an existing capillary bed, is a crucial process involved in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including embryonic development, wound healing and tumor growth. It comprises a cascade of events, emanating from endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration and maturation to form capillary tubes. In this study, the antiproliferative and angiogenic activities of atranorin isolated from chloroform extract of the lichen Parmelia sulcata on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell Line (HUVEC) was assessed. Cells were treated with different concentrations of atranorin (50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400 lM) and cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. Matrigel tube formation assay was performed to investigate the angiogenic activity. The results of the MTT assay showed a dose and time dependent manner. The results of the tube formation showed that atranorin decrease significantly at physiological concentrations in a dose dependent manner and inhibit HUVECs tube formation moderately at higher concentration. Results show that atranorin decreased of cell numbers at 48 hours and cell death rates increased in a dosedependent manner. Tube formation assay show that atranorin inhibiting angiogenesis.

Among these systems an important role is played by the non-ionic nanoemulsions that form transparent or translucent, high kinetic stable dispersions of oil and water stabilized by the surfactant interfacial film. The attractiveness of formulating oil-in-water (o/w) nanoemulsion systems lies in their ability to incorporate many hydrophobic drugs into the oil phase thereby enhancing their solubility and permeation. The present work has been carried out to explore the biological potential and ability of o/w nanoemulsions stabilized by non-ionic polyoxyethylated surfactant to solubilize selected photosensitizers of the cyanine -type. Phase diagrams of the pseudoternary system: Tween 80/soybean oil/water, Tween 80/ IPM/water and Tween 20/IPM/water were determined. Size and morphology of o/w droplets have been characterized by DLS and zeta-potential measurements. These studies allow one to select suitable systems for solubilization of hydrophobic cyanines such as IR-786 and IR-780. The solubilization capacity and partition coefficients: between micellar and bulk phases (Km/w) and octanol/water (LogP) of selected dyes was determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The biological impact of cyanine-loaded nanovehicles was evaluated on cancer cell lines (MCF-7) by FACS analysis and CLSM as well as the measurements of cytotoxic and phototoxic activity estimated by MTT assay. The obtained nanoemulsion-type nanocarriers offer simultaneously the ease of manufacture with little energy input, a long shelf life and high solubilization capacity. Therefore they present considerable potential to act as solubilizing media and drug vehicles by encapsulating hydrophobic cyanines: new type of photosensitizing dyes used in photodynamic therapy. Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disease, caused by CDH1 germline mutations. Most of these origin premature termination codons (PTC), generating non-functional truncated proteins. Disease clinical expression occurs at early age, with undetected multifocal tumors in patients stomachs. Prophylactic gastrectomy is the only therapeutic approach for asymptomatic mutation carriers, so it is important to develop new therapies. We hypothesize PTC replacement by a correct aminoacid using suppressor-tRNAs in patients mRNA could be used to treat HDGC. We developed a cellular model to study CDH1 truncating mutations and its possible reversion. We generated a wild-type CDH1 mini-gene encompassing the full-length cDNA and an intron before the last exon (CDH1_WT). Nonsense and frameshift mutations were introduced in the mini-gene by site-directed mutagenesis (CDH1_Mut). Plasmids were transfected into MDA-MB-231, a breast cancer cell line lacking CDH1 expression. RT_PCR confirmed CDH1 expression and correct splicing in MDA-MB-231 transfected with CDH1_WT and Western blot and immunocitochemistry showed E-cadherin correctly localized at the membrane. CDH1_WT rescued aggregation and invasion suppression. In contrast, cells transfected with CDH1_Mut resembled parental cells as they did not recover E-cadherin expression nor rescued aggregation or invasion suppression. So far we developed a reliable in vitro cell model to study CDH1 truncating mutations and their reversion. We further developed plasmids carrying suppressor-tRNAs, designed by site-directed mutagenesis to be complementary to nonsense mutations from CDH1_Mut. After cotransfection of suppressor-tRNAs in cells carrying CDH1_Mut mini-genes, we observed by Western blot E-cadherin protein expression recovery. The study of protein functionality is ongoing. Angiogenesis plays a central role in both local tumour growth and distant metastasis. As tumour angiogenesis proceeds, new capillaries invade and surround the tumour, feeding its rapid growth. Tumour cells may then spread from the tumour into the circulation, leading to metastasis. Thus, the inhibition of angiogenesis offers an attractive therapeutic target with little expected toxicity. Usnic acid, which can be obtained from lichens offer such a potential with antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antiviral, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and antitumour activities as well as some other properties such as UV protection, allergen, toxicity. Our study determined the antiangiogenic activity of usnic acid, isolated from ethanol extract of lichen Cladonia foliacea, that was collected at Bozdag, Eskisehir. Cytotoxicity (by MTT assay), as well as apoptotic (by DAPI and JC-1 staining) and anti-angiogenic activities (by tube formation) was evaluated on human umbilicial vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) for the first time. Apoptotic potential of usnic acid were determined by mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 staining) and DNA condensation (DAPI staining). Cells were treated with different concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 lM) of extract and assays carried out. Usnic acid were cytotoxic and apoptotic against cells dose dependent manner. IC50 value was about 80 lM. As a result of the angiogenic assay, usnic acid is non-cytotoxic but inhibits capillary vessel formation in cultured HUVECs as from at a concentration of 20 lM. We noticed that the significant difference in the size and morphology of the tubes depending on the concentration. And also JC-1 and DAPI staining results showed that usnic acid have apoptotic activity on HU-VECs dose dependent. Our results revealed that it is a potential candidate for novel cancer therapies. Usnic acid is may be used in the development of therapeutic agents for angiogenic diseases and cancer.",

These RNA molecules consist of the sense (SncmtRNA) or the antisense (AS-ncmtRNA) transcript from the 16S mitochondrial gene plus an inverted repeat (IR) linked at the 5' terminus, forming long hairpin structures. These RNAs display a consistent differential expression pattern by in situ hybridization, depending on proliferative status; in normal proliferative cells, S and ASncmtRNAs are both present, while in tumor cells only the SncmtRNA is detected and resting cells display neither. This is true for cultured cells and tissue samples. In a wide variety of human and mouse tumor cell lines, interference of the ASncmtRNA with chemically modified oligonucleotides results in massive cell death, with features of apoptosis and autophagy. In contrast, viability of resting or proliferating normal cells is unaffected by the treatment. These results suggest the applicability of this technology for the development of a highly effective and selective tumor therapeutic method. As a first approach to this end, we have carried out ex vivo assays of cell death induction in the murine melanoma cell line B16F10. Cell death typically reaches 60-80%, but treatment also affects cell proliferation, since only 2-5% live cells remain, compared to untreated controls. Colony formation assay revealed that the treatment practically abolished the ability of the remaining live cells to form colonies in soft agar. When these cells were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic (C57BL6/J) mice, they were unable to induce tumor formation. Moreover, in vivo treatment of B16F10 cells injected into mice prevented formation of tumors.

Gefitinib (C22H24ClFN4O3), an anilino-quinazoline derivative, inhibits the activity of several tyrosine kinases and has been tested as an anticancer drug against several tumors including non-small lung cancer (NSLC). Gefitinib inhibits Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase (EGFR-TK) activity by inhibiting ATP-binding, and is expected to be active against tumors that depend on EGFR for survival. Gefitinib shows potent synergetic activity with DNA damaging anticancer drugs such as Irinotecan (CPT-11; 7-ethyl-10-[4-(-1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxy camptothecin), an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. The synergy with DNA damaging agents suggests that Gefitinib may interfere with DNA damage responses. We tested the activity of Gefitinib against wild type yeast cells, and observed significant growth inhibition. Therefore, we extended our examination to other isogenic strains that are defective in DNA repair. We found that recombination deficient yeast cells showed enhanced Gefitinib sensitivity compared to wild type cells. We are currently examining other yeast strains that are defective in responses to DNA damage to elucidate the target(s) of Gefitinib. Our results may shed insight in other biochemical targets that may be relevant to the efficacy of this novel anti-cancer agent. Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Recent studies have shown that HIV-protease inhibitors (HIV-PIs), widely used in highly antiretroviral therapy, led to a reduced incidence and regression of HIV-associated tumors in infected patients. Evidences indicate that this antitumor effect is not only the result of drug-mediated HIV suppression and immune reconstitution, but also of direct anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor actions. Herein we sought to evaluate whether HIV-PIs could impair events leading to cervical cancer employing a mouse model of spontaneous cervical cancer, K14-HPV/E2. We performed a prevention-intervention trial aimed to prevent or regress tumor progression and angiogenesis by treating mice with Indinavir, Saquinavir and Ritonavir. HIV-PIs indirectly inhibited tumor growth and incidence by exerting an antiangiogenic effect and, consequently, by inducing tumor apoptosis. We further performed a regression trial, starting treatments when the mice had invasive tumors, to evaluate if HIV-PIs were able to regress or stabilize tumor progression. Interestingly HIV-PIs dramatically reduced tumor burden and invasiveness by increasing collagen-IV expression compared to controls. Remarkably, in both treatments, HIV-PIs completely inhibited matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 activity in tumors compared to controls. Since MMP-9 is involved in the mobilization of VEGF-A from the matrix, we evaluated the formation of VEGF-A-VEGR-2 complex in tumor vessels. Of note HIV-PIs strongly reduced the amount of VEGF bound to its receptor VEGFR2, in parallel to a dramatic reduction in MMP-9 activity, suggesting that HIV-PIs, by targeting MMP-9, impair the VEGF-A pathway and therefore inhibit tumor angiogenesis. We conclude that HIV-PIs have anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects on cervical carcinogenesis unrelated to their antiviral activity and that these drugs could represent new antiangiogenic targets that can be easily transferred to the clinic. Cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), is among the highest effective antitumor drugs used for the chemotherapeutic treatment of a broad range of malignancies. The preponderance of research over the last three decades has focused on cisplatin direct bonds with the N7 of the purine bases of nuclear DNA (guanine and adenine). Nonetheless, more than a generation after its clinical introduction, the mechanisms linking drug/nuclear DNA adducts formation and the cytoplasmic cascade of events leading to apoptosis are unclear. Considering that mitochondria play an important role in cell death activation and in a significant portion of the clinical activity and pharmacological properties associated with cisplatin, aim of this research was to evaluate the possibility that the model complex platinated deoxyguanosine triphosphate [Pt(dien)(N7-G), dien=diethylenetriamine, G=5'-(2'-deoxy)guanosine triphosphate] could be transported into mitochondria and then incorporated in the mitochondrial DNA. The kinetic characterization has revealed that the deoxynucleotide carrier (DNC; also known as Slc25a19), solubilised from rat liver mitochondria and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, transports [Pt(dien)(N7-G)] with high affinity. Furthermore, the radioactive uptake assay associated with quantitative analysis of Pt by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES), has provided a strong evidence for a specific import of [Pt(dien)(N7-G)] into intact and respiring rat liver mitochondria. Finally, a highly efficient in organello DNA synthesis system followed by ICP-AES, has demonstrated that [Pt(dien)(N7-G)] is incorporated in the mitochondrial DNA. These results may have critical implications in the development of a new generation of anticancer deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogues with a specific cellular target and fewer side effects.",

There is an urgent need for improved control and therapeutics because the emergence of acaricide resistance in the vector tick populations and occurrence of resistance against to antitheilerial. Parasite's the citric acid cycle is inactive. In this respect, glycolysis is the main pathway for energy production. In this study, the use of parasite's enolase that is one of glicolysis enzymes as an antitheilerial drug target is evaluated. Gene encoding the enolase enzyme from Theileria parva, which genome project was completed, has not been characterised previously. For the first time, we have isolated and cloned the enolase into pGEM-T vector. Results showed that enolase gene contains an insert when compared with host organism Bos taurus. This insert may be an excellent target for inhibitor design. Keywords: Theileria parva, East Coast fever, antitheilerial, enolase, inhibitor design P19.14 BAG3, specifically expressed in uterine cervical carcinoma HPV positive cells, sustains E6 oncoprotein-dependent survival signals in infected cells and modulates its activity. Furthermore, BAG3 contains a WW and a proline-rich domain, able to mediate interactions with other molecular partners. Several tumors constitutively express bag3 gene; in such neoplastic cells, BAG3 protein suppresses apoptosis and sustains cell survival. It is likely that BAG3 influences cell survival by interacting with more than one molecular partner, expectedly represented by proteins that modulate apoptosis. ''High-risk'' HPVs (such as HPV16 and HPV18) are the major causative agent of uterine cervical carcinomas. HPVs encode E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which interfere with the normal regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in host cells. Interestingly, high levels of BAG3 protein were detected in uterine cervical carcinoma HPV positive HeLa and SiHa cells (HPV18 and HPV16 positive, respectively), but not in HPV negative C33A cells. Such a correlation between increased BAG3 expression and HPV infection prompts us to investigate whether BAG3 might play a pro-survival role in HPV18-infected HeLa cells. BAG3 siRNA transfection effectively resulted in a significant decrease of HeLa cell cycle progression/viability. In addition, BAG3 silencing was found to down-regulate the levels of E6 protein as well E6-mediated p53 ubiquitinization. In addition, by immunoprecipitation experiments, we successfully demonstrated the presence in HeLa cells of an E6-BAG3 complex. The ability of BAG3 in sustaining E6 level and function seems to be specific for this oncoprotein, since the levels of pRb protein, an E7 target, were not affected by BAG3 silencing. All together our findings suggest that BAG3 might contribute to HPV-positive neoplastic cell survival by sustaining specifically the levels of E6, either by assisting E6 folding and /or preventing its delivery to proteasome.",

Tau, encoded by a single gene on chromosome 17q21, is a cytoskeletal component expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), with a role in neurogenesis, axonal maintenance and axonal transport. The neuropathological aggregation of tau as Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs) in brain is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as ''Tauopathies'', among which Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). FTDP-17 is a rare autosomal dominant condition. The cause of about half of the cases of FTDP-17 are mutation affecting the alternative splicing of exon 10 (E10). The aberrant inclusion of E10 in the tau mRNA leads to the accumulation of the tau protein in neurons. The project explores the feasibility of an antisense (as-) RNAbased gene therapy to correct tau splicing in FTDP-17. We first tested whether it was possible to modulate E10 alternative splicing by the usage of a Antisense Oligonucleotides (AONs) that masks specific sites regulating splicing pathways. Real Time-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that the transfection of specific AONs is able to alter the splicing behaviour of tau E10 in the rat endogenous transcript (PC-12), with variable efficiencies depending on the concentration of the AONs and on the targeted sequence. These results were confirmed by transfection of Scramble Control oligonucleotides that had no effects on E10 inclusion at the same concentrations.",

It has been reported that a strong correlation between the flavonoid intake and a decrease risk of cardiovascular diseases exists. The flavanone 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), extracted from the lupulin glands of the hop flowers, was identified as a novel phytoestrogen, unique with respect to estrogen receptors specificity and potency. Human exposure to 8-PN occurs primarily through the consumption of the hop-derived products, such as beer and an increasing number of dietary supplements. However, no investigations on the 8-PN role in modulating platelet function has been undertaken. Given these considerations, we have evaluated whether 8-PN could influence platelet functionality. Our results showed for the first time that 8-prenylnaringenin was able to irreversibly inhibit platelet aggregation induced by different agonists and platelet adhesion to collagen matrix. Moreover, our data demonstrated that 8-PN effect on platelet function was not related to its ability to bind the estrogen receptors. The treatment of platelets with 8-PN directly activated one of the best characterized inhibitory pathway in platelets increasing intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels and promoting VASP phosphorylation. However these molecular events were not responsible for the inhibitory action of 8-PN on platelets. Therefore we focused our attention on protein phosphorylation, crucial event in platelet activation. Our results demonstrated that 8-PN inhibited the collagen-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent activation of Pyk2, Akt, and Erk 1/2. In conclusion we have demonstrated that 8-PN exerts antiaggregatory and antiadhesive effects on human platelets, independently of estrogen receptors. However further studies are needed to better characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in 8-PN-mediated platelet inhibition.",

The mucosal vaccines may be developed based on the native or recombinant allergens. The using of recombinant allergens is more advantageous. The different systems are usually applied for the recombinant allergens production. The prevalent heterologous expression system is E. coli. Such system is easier and cheaper but has some disadvantages: lack of the post-translational modifications and incorrect protein folding. That is why the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in plants in some cases seems to be preferable due to the high yield of protein and correct post-translational modifications and folding system. The aim of this investigation was to establish an efficient system for the production of recombinant allergens Der f 1 and Der f 2 from Dermatophagoides farinae. For that two expressed systems were compared. The mature forms of Der f 1 and Der f 2 were expressed in E. coli (M15 strain) using pQE-30 vector. Also the proform of Der f 1 and mature form of Der f 2 in fusion with the tobacco signal peptide from PR-R protein were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using PVX-201 viral vector. All recombinant allergens were purified under native conditions on Ni-NTA columns. The IgE-binding capacity of recombinant allergens was verified by ELISA test on the 26 serums from the children manifesting symptoms of asthma with sensitivity to house dust mites. The r Der f 1 and r Der f 2 from E. coli shown the IgE-binding capacity with 58% and 96% serums, respectively. Whereas the r Der f 1 and r Der f 2 from N. benthamiana plants shown the IgE-binding capacity with 100% serums.

Elevated NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity promotes oxidative injury of the cardiovascular cells. Janus-tyrosine-kinase2 (Jak2) regulates various aspects of the atherosclerotic process, e.g., inflammation, cellular growth, proliferation, and migration. Methods and results: Here, we investigated the potential of Jak2 inhibition to counteract Nox-dependent O2\u2022-formation in atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. Male ApoE-/-mice fed a high-fat, cholesterolrich diet were treated for 5 weeks with either vehicle or tyrphostin AG490 (1 mg/kg), a specific Jak2 inhibitor. Lucigeninenhanced-chemiluminescence assay, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that Nox-derived O2\u2022-generation, Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated in the aortas of ApoE-/-mice fed a high-fat diet compared to ApoE-/-mice fed a normal diet. Treatment with tyrphostin AG490 significantly reduced the up-regulated Nox activity, the expression of each Nox subtype, as well as the protein level of CD68, a macrophage-specific marker.

Although esssential oils contain a variety of volatile molecules such as terpenes and terpenoids and also most of them as antioxidants, it is crucial to consider that the terms being natural or traditionally used does not mean that these ingredients are safe. Because it's not known that these components have genotoxic effects on humans. So that genotoxicity studies of individual components of essential oils are the most important area for human healthy. CBMN technique has been extensively prefered for detecting micronucleus which is a biomarker of genetic damage. The formation of micronuclei (MN) in dividing cells can result from chromosome breakage due to unrepaired or mis-repaired DNA lesions or chromosome malsegregation due to mitotic malfunction. In this study, genotoxic activities of essential oil of Origanum onites L. and its monoterpenes thymol and carvacrol were investigated in human lymphocytes culture with CBMN and HGPRT mutation assay. According to the data from CBMN assay, essential oil of Origanum onites and thymol showed the genotoxic effects because of they significantly increase of micronucleus formation compared with the control value in cultured human lymphocytes. But carvacrol weren't significant in terms of the formation of MN. In the HGPRT mutation assay, It was determined that essential oil of Origanum onites have efficient HGPRT gen mutation activity.

The transplant of SC to restore normal ocular physiology is challenged by their identification and isolation, since a specific surface marker is still lacking. To this end, the presence and topographic localization of nucleotide-consuming ectoenzymes were analyzed on cells isolated from human corneas. WB and confocal microscopy demonstrated the expression at the epithelial cell membrane of the 45-kDa CD38 protein. The enzymatic activities of CD38, NADase and ADP-ribosyl cyclase, were respectively demonstrated by the ability to consume NAD and cyclize NGD by HPLC assays. The compartmentalization analysis of the molecule showed that CD38 is only expressed by superficial epithelial cells of the limbus. CD157 appears as a doublet of 42-45 kDa with an enzymatic performance similar to that observed in leukocytes. Topographical analysis showed that CD157 marks a discrete subset of basal limbal epithelial clusters, a p63+/cytokeratin 19+ cell subset reported to contain corneal SC. To study this subset, the CD157+ and CD157-populations were immunomagnetic cell sorted, and the proliferative capacity and SC marker signature investigated. Further, microarray gene expression of dissected central cornea and limbal epithelium showed the presence of mRNA for CD73 and CD39 ectoenzymes, which were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and by an ad hoc developed enzymatic HPLC assay, measuring the conversion of ADP to AMP and Adenosine. Results confirmed the hypothesis that an adenosinergic loop is operative in human eyes: a subset of limbal corneal cells expressing CD39 and CD73 can generate Adenosine, thereby modulating the extracellular environment and creating an immune privilege compartment. The complete identification of ectoenzymatic components and pathways will help to improve the isolation of bona fide SC for therapeutical purposes. Cervical cancer is one of the most important causes of death in women worldwide. High risk human papillomaviruses are known to play an important etiological role in cervical cancer development. The E6 viral protein function is linked to carcinogenesis and targeting degradation of p53 on a E6AP-ubiquitin ligase dependent mechanism.EZH2 expression is often observed in proliferative and aggressive tumor subgroups, being a potential proliferation marker and who seems to directly contribute to the deregulation of cell growth as an oncogene. Activated p53 suppressed EZH2 gene expression through repression of the EZH2 gene promoter. In order to attempt reversing malignant phenotype and to study the related molecular mechanisms of HPV oncogenesis, Caski cell line (HPV16) was used as experimental model, targeting E6AP mRNA with a specific siRNA (Santa Cruz).E6AP expression silencing was performed using synthetic small interfering RNA transferred into CaSki cell line according to manufacturer's protocol (80 pmol E6AP siRNA).siRNA control and cells treated with transfection medium as well as untreated cells were used as controls.The cells were harvested after 48 hours and the efficiency of transfection was estimated at 82%.The p53 gene expression was measured using Real-Time PCR and expression levels of HPV16 E6, p53, EZH2 proteins were detected by Western blot as compared with controls. Results showed that the expression of p53 mRNA and protein level was significantly increased as compared with controls. After transfection the level of EZH2 protein decreased, meanwhile E6 protein expression seemed to remain similar to control. siRNA targeting can effectively suppress the expression levels of E6AP mRNA and lead to the recovery of P53 protein function activity, demonstrating that activated p53 can control the level of EZH2 protein expression which can represent a useful tool for future therapy. Theileriosis one of the tick-borne diseases caused by Theileria parva (also known as East Coast fever or ECF) which are responsible for economic losses in cattle in Africa, result in profound medical, social, and economic effects. The cost of imported acaricides and the need for newer and more expensive ones to combat acaricide resistance is heavy. In addition, therapeutic drugs such as buparvaquone have become available but are expensive and difficult to use unless the Theileria infection is diagnosed early. It is necessary that exploiting new resources to identify effective therapeutic targets so it will help to develop new, effective, and cheap drugs. Thus, the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme from Theileria parva has been selected as a new candidate for drug target. Although genome sequence of T. parva is known, for the first time, we have isolated and cloned its lactate dehydrogenase gene which hasn't been characterised so far. Results have revealed that lactate dehydrogenase of Theileria parva has five residue insertion according to host organism Bos taurus. This five residue insertion may be a valuable target for antitheilerial design. Keywords: Theileria parva, tick-borne disease, antitheilerial, lactate dehydrogenase, insertion",

The therapeutic role of DOX in human cancers was first revealed with preclinical and clinical studies on DOX induced apoptosis and growth delay of cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cancer of the prostrate. The mechanism was suggested as Fas mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint regardless of its ability to inhibit alpha 1-adrenoreceptor. Later, the antineoplastic activity of DOX was determined as an independent of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor but multiple mechanisms depending on tissue and cell type. For cardiomyocytes, DOX induced apoptosis was identified with endoplasmic reticulum associated pathway where increase in C/EBP beta and GADD153 expression was determined. In human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) the apoptosis induction was determined through mitochondrial membrane potential loss. In metastatic renal cell carcinoma and vascular smooth muscle cells DOX induced death-receptor-mediated apoptosis was reported. In breast cancer cells, on the other hand, doxazosin was shown to induce apoptosis through inhibition of EGFR and NF-kB signalling pathways. As a global effect, transforming growth factor-b associated apoptosis induction was reported for cancer and normal cells of various tissues including bladder smooth muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, colon cancer, HeLa and pituitary adenoma cells. There is no report in the literature related with DOX effect on cytosolic non-receptor tyrosine kinases although several quinazoline derivatives were very recently patented as compounds for src kinase inhibitors. Since c-Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a central signaling molecule for multiple mechanisms related to cell viability, proliferation and invasion, in the present study, we hypothesize that the global or tissue specific effect of DOX on cells may be due to its interaction with c-Src to modulate its kinase activity at a dose range higher than it is required to inhibit the phase II drug metabolizing enzyme glutathione transferase (GST). In this approach, initially the dose of DOX required to inhibit the GST was determined. The Src-DOX interaction was evaluated within the dose ranges higher and lower than those exerting GST inhibition between 40-80% of transferase activity. The overall analysis of DOX mediated c-Src dose-response curve revealed that cellular accumulation of DOX may modulate kinase activity of Src family kinase members and this may be due to reduced ability of GST to detoxify the accumulating drug in in vitro acellular conditions.",

Ellagic acid and tannic acid ranging from 1 lM to 250 lM were incubated with rabbit liver microsomal fractions. Enzyme activities were inhibited to different degree by both phenolic acids except ethylmorphine N-demethylase. Ellagic acid and tannic acid were found to be the most potent inhibitor of NDMA N-demethylase and erythromycin N-demethylase activity with IC50 of 2.8 \u00b1 0.04 lM and 16.9 \u00b1 0.87 lM, respectively. FMO catalyzed methimazole oxidation was only inhibited when ellagic acid and tannic acid were used in higher concentrations with IC50 of 180 \u00b1 0.09 lM and 169 \u00b1 1.34 lM, respectively. To study the detail of inhibition kinetics of CYP enzymes in the presence of ellagic acid and tannic acid, CYP2E1 dependent aniline 4hydroxylase and CYP2B dependent benzphetamine N-demethylase were chosen. Tannic acid was found to be non-competitive inhibitor of both aniline 4-hydroxylase and benzphetamine N-demethylase with Ki of 54.7 lM and 65.7 lM, respectively, while ellagic acid competitively inhibited those enzymes with Ki of 6.89 and 8.11. These results show that ellagic acid and tannic acid may affect the metabolism of drugs and carcinogenic compounds differently by modulating CYP and FMO enzymes involved in xenobiotic activation pathways.",

Lactaptin was shown to induce apoptosis in several cultured human cancer cell lines. Recombinant analogue of lactaptin (RL2) was constructed and produced in E. coli. The apoptotic action of RL2 was specific only to tumor cells: MCF-7, A549, AsPc1 and Hs-578 whereas the nonmalignant human mesenchymal steam cells as well as normal breast tissue primary cells were resistant to RL2. Here we describe the therapeutic effect of RL2 on the growth of implanted tumors in mice. Two mouse tumors -hepatoma HA-1 and HA1/2 were selected for in vivo experiments because of RL2 decreased in vitro their viability by 85%. HA-1 and HA-1/2 were inoculated in A/Sn mice s/c or intramuscularly. RL2 injections caused significant decrease tumor in size (by 65%). It was shown intravenously injections were more effective than intraperitoneal ones. Strong dose-dependent antitumor effect of RL2 was also detected. The tumor inhibition rate in high RL2 doses was comparable to cyclophosphamide effect but RL2 did not induce detectable side effects. Conclusion: Our results show that RL2 therapy significantly delayed the tumor growth. Taken together, RL2 can be considered as a basis for further development of formulation and a promising tool for clinical treatment. The disturbance of cytokine synthesis can lead to the development of different autoimmune diseases. Among cytokines which excessive release appears to be associated with a number of pathological processes is interferon (IFN)-c. Since the pathophysiology of several autoimmune disorders is thought to be driven by Th1 type inflammation, inhibiting the action of IFN-c, including blockade of its function using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), might be considered as an approach for the treatment of these diseases. The aim of present work is the development of recombinant antibodies blocking IFN-c activity. The panel of six murine monoclonal antibodies raised against human recombinant IFN-c was investigated. These mAbs are characterized by different affinity and biological activity. The capacity of mAbs to block IFN-c functions was determined in two assays. In first in vitro study, the effect of mAbs on the IL-10 secretion by T-cells in whole blood (activated via CD3/ CD28) was elucidated. IFN-c itself is one of the factors that promote the differentiation of Th1 cells, therefore blockade of its function is assumed to lead to deviation in differentiation of T cells to Th2 type and increased secretion of corresponding cytokines. The second assay was used to determine ability of mAbs to inhibit MHC class II induction on U937 cells. As a result of these studies, three mAbs were selected for subsequent modification. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to light and heavy chain variable domains of the selected mAbs were obtained and vectors for secretory expression of chimeric Fab'-fragments in E. coli cells were constructed. The recombinant antibody fragments were isolated and used for the determination of their affinity and biological activity. Chimeric antibody affinity was measured in competitive ELISA and dissociation constants amounted to 0.9 \u00b7 10 )9 M for F1 mAb and 1.2 \u00b7 10 )8 M for A1 mAb. These values correlate with dissociation constants of parental mouse mAbs.",

Galvano and F. Salamone Section of Biochemistry, Department of Drug Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening condition leading to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy and multiorgan failure. The main cause of ALF in industrialized countries is acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication. In this study, we assessed the therapeutical potential of adipose tissue-mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in APAP-ALF. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were administrated 300 mg/Kg of APAP i.p. Four rats served as healthy controls. After 2 hours from APAP dose, six rats were transplanted 200.000 ASCs, suspended in saline, via the caudal vein, whereas six animals received only the vehicle. After 24 hours from APAP administration, rats were sacrificed and blood, liver and brain samples were collected. Plasma liver injury markers and brain water content was determined. Liver isoprostanes and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) was measured by ELISA. Hepatic nitrite/nitrate was measured colorimetrically. JNK expression was evaluated by immunoblot. Liver sections of rats with APAP-ALF showed diffuse vacuolar degeneration indicating mitochondrial damage and scattered necroinflammatory foci. In rats transplanted with ASCs, liver injury was almost absent. Tranplantation of ASCs decreased liver isoprostanes, 8-OHG and nitrite/ nitrates to the levels of control rats.Western blot analysis showed that phospho-JNK expression was markedly increased in rats with APAP-ALF as compared to control rats, whereas ASCs transplantation restored p-JNK expression to levels of healthy animals.Transplantation of ASCs decreased AST, ALT, ammonia and prothrombin time to the levels observed in control rats. Consistently, brain water content of transplanted rats was similar to healthy animals. Furthermore, these animals did not present clinical signs of encephalopathy. In this study we demonstrated that ASCs transplantation is effective in treating APAP-induced ALF and encephalopathy in rats. ASCs engraft in the injuried liver, where exert potent antioxidant effects and inhibits JNK activation. The actions of plant antimicrobial peptides (PAP) against intracellular pathogens are poorly known. It has been reported that wheat puroindolines show antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis endocyted by macrophages. In this work, we evaluated the intracellular antimicrobial activity of PAP c-thionin and thionin Thi2.1 produced by bovine endothelial cells against intracellular Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. We used three host-pathogen models: (i) bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC)-S. aureus, (ii) bovine endothelial cells (BEC)-S. aureus and (iii) BEC-C. albicans, and evaluated the effect of con-ditioned media from BEC producers of PAP (c-thionin and thionin Thi2.1). In the first model, conditioned medium (CM) containing Thi2.1 completely inhibited S. aureus intracellular after 24 hours treatment. In the second model, CM from BEC containing c-thionin has a better effect killing intracellular S. aureus for 12-24 hours incubations than CM from endothelial cells producers of Thi2.1; this was related with an increase of nitric oxide production (2 times) in BEC infected and treated for 12 hours with CM containing c-thionin, which negatively correlates with bacterial viability. In the third model, CM containing Thi2.1 showed a more potent intracellular fungicidal activity (85% of inhibition) at 24 hours treatment than CM containing c-thionin (35% of inhibition). This work shows new effects of PAP to control intracellular bacterial or fungal infections.",

One of the most important families of non-histone proteins are High Mobility Group (HMG) proteins. HMG proteins induce structural changes in chromatin fiber by binding to nucleosomes, making them as important proteins in different kinds of chromatin-dependent diseases for example cancer. Daunomycin is an Anthracycline antibiotic anticancer drug that is most effective on DNA and chromatin. In this work, the effect of daunomycin on HMG proteins in soluble chromatin structure, was investigated using SDS-PAGE, Western blot and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. For this purpose, chromatin was incubated with various concentrations of daunomycin, and HMG proteins were extracted and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The results showed that by increasing drug concentration, the content of HMGB proteins are decreased on the gel, thus at high concentrations of daunomycin, HMG-B proteins are fully disappeared. Analyzing of the proteins by Western blot using antisera against HMG proteins revealed the same result. Daunomycin was also incubated with chromatin and the mixture analyzed on HAP column, demonstrating that HMG proteins are bound to daunomycin in which UV/Visible and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed it. From the results it is suggested that binding of daunomycin to chromatin, condensed and aggregated the chromatin somehow that prevented release of HMG proteins. Also, HMG proteins can be considered as a target for anticancer drugs such as daunomycin.",

Biosensors with surface plasmon resonance detection (SPR) are powerful tools for characterization of biomolecular interaction in general.

In cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary infections are often caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Efforts to treat these infections are also hampered by the conditions present in the CF lung, such as formation of antibiotic-resistant biofilms. The development of novel therapeutic strategies is therefore in high demand. In this study, the in vitro activity of two bovine antimicrobial peptides (BMAP-27 and BMAP-28) was tested against CF bacterial isolates (25 P. aeruginosa, 27 S. maltophilia, and 15 S. aureus MDR strains) under conditions mimicking those found in CFlungs, and compared to that of tobramycin. The effect of both peptides and tobramycin at sub-MICs was also tested against biofilm formation. To mimic the CF lung environment, assays were performed under 5% CO2 atmosphere and by using a defined synthetic medium whose nutritional composition is similar to that of CF sputum. MIC determinations showed that BMAP-27 and -28 exhibited comparable activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC90: 16 and 32 lg/ ml, respectively) and S. maltophilia (MIC90: 8 and 4 lg/ml, respectively), while BMAP-28 exhibited an activity higher than that of BMAP-27 against S. aureus (MIC90: 32 and >64 lg /ml, respectively). Tobramycin was significantly less active, regardless of the species tested (MIC90: >64 lg/ml, for all strains). Timekilling assays showed that both BMAPs exhibited a rapid (within 30-60 minutes) bactericidal activity generally leading to complete eradication within 120 minutes. In contrast, tobramycin showed a bacteriostatic effect allowing some re-growth at 24 hours. The two peptides at sub-MICs significantly reduced the amount of biofilm formed on polystyrene by CF strains, although to a lesser extent than tobramycin. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the uptake of a photosensitizer followed by its photosensitization through a selective irradiation, which induce oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. In this work the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was evaluated during photodynamic treatment. We have used as experimental system four cell lines: COLO 829 (primary melanoma), A2058 (metastatic melanoma), BJ-5ta (human immortalized fibroblasts), SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma). 5-ALA is the precursor of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the biosynthetic pathway of heme. PpIX is a potent photosensitizer, thus leading to an ALA-based PDT. When exogenous 5-ALA is added to culture medium, the production of cellular PpIX can be induced. We have verified the intracellular production of PpIX in the above mentioned cell lines after treatment with different concentration of 5-ALA for various times in the dark. Fluorimetric analysis has shown a dose-dependent increase of fluorescence intensity up to 0.3 mM 5-ALA after 6 hours of incubation. Hence, to evaluate the 5-ALA photocytotoxicity effect, the cells were incubated with 0.3 mM 5-ALA for 6 hours in the dark. After incubation, the cells were irradiated with different light doses using a halogen lamp with a 520 nm long pass filter and a fluence rate of 2.6 mW/cm 2 . After this exposure, the cells were incubated for additional 24 hours and then the photocytotoxicity effect was evaluated. The results showed that the cytotoxic effect was proportional to the light dose and, interestingly, the metastatic melanoma cell line A2058, is more responsive than the other cell lines used. Furthermore, analysis of expression profiles of some antioxidant enzymes, after 5-ALA-based-PDT lead to a reduction of SOD2 protein levels in cellular extracts of A2058 cell. These results may provide further insights for clinical applications of PDT in cancers particularly resistant to conventional therapies.",

It was proposed that DNase I may be produced more economically in bacterial expression system. Expression of recombinant nucleases in E. coli or other heterologous hosts is problematic due to nucleases intrinsic toxicity. We assumed that enzyme activity of human DNase I may be reduced by addition to its N-terminus of short peptide sequence, cleavable in vitro by site-specific protease. Optimized synthetic gene of human DNase I was constructed and expressed in a modified pET28a vector with introduced Nterminal tag and enterokinase site. DNase I with N-terminal extension was abundantly expressed in BL21[DE3] cells, comprising more than 30% of total cellular protein. Target protein was completely insoluble and was purified to >95% purity by the single round of immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Refolding by rapid dilution procedure was developed and optimized using design of experiment. Best refolding conditions found lead to more than 70% monomer yield. Relative enzymatic activity of refolded N-terminally extended human DNase I was found to be as low as 2.6 Kunitz units/mg.

Further studies are required to develop the processes of its conjugation with biopolymers for pharmaceutical purposes. We describe the synthesis and biological activity of a new class of 1,3-diaryltriazenes, namely 4-nitro-substituted 1,3-diaryltriazenes. Structure-activity relationship analysis reveals that 1,3-diaryltriazenes can be modified from inactive to highly cytotoxic compounds by the introduction of two nitro groups at the para positions of benzene rings and two additional electron-withdrawing groups (bromo, chloro, trifluoromethyl or fluoro substituents) at their ortho position. In order to increase the solubility of the modified compounds, we introduced various acyl groups to their triazene nitrogen. The results of LC-MS/MS analysis showed that N-acyltriazenes can be considered as prodrugs of non-acylated triazenes. Selected 3-acetyl-1,3-bis(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-1-triazene (8b) is highly cytotoxic against different tumor cell lines, including cisplatin-resistant laryngeal carcinoma cells. Notably, its antiproliferative activity is significantly higher against tumor cells than against normal cells. DNA binding analysis suggests that neither 8b nor its non-acylated derivative 8a bind into the minor groove of DNA. Instead, 8b induces reactive oxygen species that could provoke endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress finally leading to apoptosis. Our data suggest that 4-nitro-substituted 1,3-diaryltriazenes are a new class of anticancer molecules which preferentially target malignant cells and may serve as potential antitumor agents. *PCT patent application is pending for this invention. Platinum complexes, and especially the cisplatin as the representative of these groups of compounds, have been used as chemotherapeutics due to their antitumoral activity through DNA intercalation, especially for specific types of human cancers, including small cell lung cancer, germ cell tumors, lymphomas and ovarian cancer. They are also approved for the use in combination with other chemotherapeutics in the treatment of advanced ovarian and testicular cancers after surgery and radiotherapy. Structure-activity studies of the platinum complexes revealed that the compounds interact with DNA to form DNAinterstrand cross link, and hence, causing DNA damages that accumulate to induce apoptosis. Although the compounds are effective through wide range of human cancers,the important clinical limitation to use platinum complexes is resistance to drug accumulation in cells and particularly in nucleus, and hence, resulting in reduced DNA-drug complex formation. In addition to reduced drug uptake by tissues and tissue specific increased DNA repair activity, the most common mechanism that interfere with drug accumulation is attributed to the presence of overactive Glutathione Transferases (GSTs), the member of the phase II detoxification system enzymes which catalyze the nucleophilic addition of glutathione to diverse electrophilic molecules including platinum based drugs, such as cisplatin. Additionally, the increased activity of GSTs has been also associated with human cancers, and very recently this was associated with deregulations in kinase signaling. Since kinases are difficult to target selectively, it may be promising to enhance therapeutic efficacy of complexes by providing ligands to improve GST inhibitory activity. Therefore, developing novel platinum complexes with full biological response in terms of their interaction by enhancing the DNA binding capacity and GST inhibitory activity may provide opportunity to enhance antitumor activity of these compounds. From this point of view, in this current study, we designed novel platinum complexes with ligands of thiophenyl and Pyridinyl-ethanone oximes and evaluated their activity against GSTs using bovine liver cytosol as enzyme source and CDNB as general substrate for GST isozymes. In this concept, the various oxime derivatives which are recently shown to interact with DNA and cause the strand breaks, were considered as potential ligands for platinum complexes to enhance DNA binding capacity. In the current study it is proposed that novel oxime derivatives as ligands for platinum complexes may provide potential anticancer agents with enhanced DNA interaction. Among the five novel compounds evaluated, we identified three novel complexes as GST inhibitors and the dose response studies revealed their inhibitory activities with IC50 values in between the nanomolar and micromolar range under physiological conditions.",

Neural induction of ASCs displayed expression of 4 neural genes eno2, map2, beta-3-tub, and nestin. The induction effect of BDNF was mediated by the receptor TrkB, which mRNA was detected in the initial ASCs population. In our experiments ASC expressing green fluorescent protein, were subjected to the inductive effects of BDNF and 5-azacitidine, within 3 days. Then these cells were injected into striatum of Black6 mice. Through 7, 9 and 11 days the distribution of transplanted cells on sections of the brain was analyzed. After 9 days, many induced ASCs migrated into the surrounding brain parenchyma. Control uninduced cells were arranged locally and did not extend beyond the injection site. By the 11th day after injection the control cells disappeared from the brain sections, whereas induced cells remained alive. The data obtained suggest that the effect of BDNF with the background of 5-azacytidine not only promotes neural differentiation of ASCs and increases the expression of neural genes, but also increases the survival of cells after transplantation into brain tissue. Immunohistochemical staining of sections containing the transplanted cells showed that induced by the developed method ASCs expressed dablkortin.

In this work we analyzed the effects of two lipohilic statins, mevastatin and simvastatin, on drug transport at BBB level. In primary human cerebral microvascular endothelial HCMEC/ D3 cells, statins decrease the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids, impair the activity of the small G-protein Rho and of the downstream effector RhoA kinase. By doing so, statins activate the IKK/NF-kB pathway, up-regulate the NO synthase isoform II and produce the nitration of critical tyrosine residues on Pgp and BCRP, decreasing the ATP-ase activity. As result, doxorubicin, a drug that is fully extruded by HCMEC/D3 cells, becomes able to cross the BBB. In addition, taking advantage from the physiological up-regulation of low density lipoproteins receptor (LDLR) induced by statins as a consequence of the decreased cell cholesterol, we designed a liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin, conjugated with a recombinant peptide containing the LDLR-binding site from human apoB-100. This nanoparticle is more uptaken by a LDLRmediated endocytosis and less extruded by Pgp in drug-resistant solid tumors [3] , as well as in BBB cells pre-treated with statins.

            "text": "Fetal bovine serum proteins associate with molecular chaperone GRP78 in stromal cells derived from the dental pulp of human exfoliated deciduous teeth Fetal bovine serum (FBS) remains the most commonly used supplement for in vitro cultivation of mammalian cells. It represents a mixture of growth factors, cytokines, transport proteins, hormones, attachment factors and lipids. The use of FBS is often associated with problems, because it contains poorly characterized components that are present at variable concentrations in different lots. Typically, medium for cell culture is supplemented with 10-20% of FBS, which means, that cells are constantly exposed to the bovine proteins at a concentration varying from 5 to 10 mg/ml. Previous studies demonstrated that cells actively internalize FBS components from culture media. However, nothing is known about the mechanisms by which cells utilize internalized proteins. Stromal cells derived from the dental pulp of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) were incubated in standard medium supplemented with 10% of biotinylated FBS (biot-FBS). Confocal microscopy revealed substantial amounts of internalized biot-FBS in SHEDs. Biotinylated proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm in fine granular structures. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that molecular chaperone GRP78 associates with biotinylated proteins in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) revealed that serum albumin is present in co-immunoprecipitates derived from the cytoplasm using antibody against GRP78. These findings were further confirmed using confocal microscopy. Interestingly, GRP78 was also expressed on the cell surface and colocalized with biot-FBS proteins. We demonstrate that internalized components of FBS interact with GRP78 in SHED cells. These results suggest that molecular chaperone GRP78 may have an important role in regulating cellular responses to the FBS. Nowadays cancer is one of the most serious diseases. Many anticancer drugs have been designed to kill cancer cells by restoring their programmed cell-death mechanism. The main problems in using some of these drugs are their low selectivity for tumor cells and high system toxicity. We decided to combine therapeutic and imaging properties intended for cancer cells in one agent which could have powerful implications in modern medicine. We recently designed and synthesized novel tumor-homing photosensitizers (PS) for selective control of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Meso-tetraphenylporphyrins (PP) and zinc-coordinated PP used as PS and imaging agent were functionalized by bombesin analogues (BN) in meta-or para-phenyl positions. BN targeting their receptors overexpressed in cells of various types of cancer (prostate, pancreas, breast cancer) should minimize photodamage of non-targeted cells. We found that porphyrin functionalization by BN had a positive effect on their watersolubilization. The cytotoxic effect of these conjugates was tested and proved on six human cancer cell lines (suspension as well as adherent cell lines), in contrast to HEK 293T cell line serving as a positive control. The efficiency of zinc-meta-porphyrin-BN conjugates was significantly higher. In addition to the cytotoxic effect of our anti-cancer conjugates, their intracellular localization was monitored by fluorescence microscopy in real-time. All prepared anti-cancer agents exhibited strong far red intracellular fluorescence. We found that the meta-conjugates exhibited much stronger fluorescence intensity than para-derivatives. Fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that our PS were selectively accumulated in the tested tumor cells. This in vitro study demonstrated high potential for the use of these compounds in targeted imaging and cancer therapy. The meta-porphyrin-based compounds have great potential in non-invasive monitoring of tumour cells in vivo much like in photodynamic therapy. To tap into the therapeutic potential of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, it's crucial to disclose which properties of the peptide/lipids are important for target selectivity, and to examine the peptide structure and its association with lipid bilayers. We structurally and dynamically characterized a novel semi-synthetic peptide with a dimeric scaffold, named SB056, and investigated its antimicrobial activity and modes of interaction with model membranes. SB056 was active against Gram-negative bacteria, but showed a limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria and was substantially inactive against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Candida spp. Both the potency and spectrum of antimicrobial activity of SB056 were comparable to those of colistin and poly-myxin B. SB056 insertion into DMPC and DMPC/DMPG monolayers, to mimic neutral and anionic membranes, respectively, was measured, together with that of the peptide's linear monomeric constituent. For both SB056 and the linear monomer monolayer activity was enhanced by the presence of DMPG, showing that electrostatic binding plays an important role in peptide-membrane interactions. Also, SB056 displayed a stronger intercalation activity with respect to the linear monomer. Given their alternating sequence of hydrophobic and charged/polar amino acids, both SB056 and its linear monomer are expected to form an amphiphilic b-strand when in contact with a lipid bilayer. 1H NMR spectra of the linear SB056 and the dendrimeric SB056 peptides in water and 70:30 water:TFE mixture, showed that peptides are basically unfolded in both solutions, although a reduced mobility of the two peptides in the water/TFE mixture compared to pure water could be discerned, as well as a different conformational flexibility of the two peptides, with the dendrimer being more constrained. A simulated annealing procedure showed that for both peptides residues in the core part of the sequence lie in the b part of the Ramachandran plot. The human genes AML1 and ETO are known partners in a t (8, 21) translocation that is associated with the development of so-called treatment-related leukaemias in patients receiving chemotherapy with DNA -topoisomerase II poisons. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the t(8,21) translocation, we assessed the degree of mutual localization of the AML1 and ETO genes in cultured human lymphoid cells (line Jurkat). Using 3D FISH, we found that in at least 5% of untreated Jurkat cells, alleles of AML1 and ETO are in close proximity. The degree of AML1 and ETO juxtaposition increased twofold in cells treated with the DNA -topoisomerase II poison etoposide. Surprisingly, in more than 50% of observed cases, co-localization of the AML1 and ETO genes occurred at the surface of nucleoli. The particular role of nucleoli in juxtaposing broken DNA ends is far from clear, although the involvement of this multifunctional nuclear compartment in DNA repair has already been suggested by previous studies. In another set of experiments, we found that treatment of Jurkat cells with etoposide triggers preferential loading of RAD 51 onto breakpoint cluster regions of the AML1 and ETO genes. Taken together with the results of previous studies, the results presented here strongly suggest that the repair of DNA lesions introduced by topoisomerase II poisons may be mediated simultaneously by multiple mechanisms, which may be the cause of mistakes resulting in translocations. Recently, our group has developed amphiphilic peptides with a cationic arginine block and a hydrophobic amino acid block for combined delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and hydrophobic drug. Hydrophobic drug may be loaded into the cores of the amphiphilic peptide micelles and pDNA may be complexed with cationic surface arginines. In this study, the R3L6 peptide was characterized as a carrier of dexamethasone and pDNA. The R3L6 peptide formed micelles in aqueous solution. Dexamethasone was loaded into the cores of the R3L6 peptide micelles by oil-in-water emulsion method. The stability of the R3L6 peptide micelles might be enhanced by dexamethasone, since dexamethasone may provide strong hydrophobic core for micelle structure. Heparin competition assay, the dexamethasone loaded R3L6 peptide micelles (R3L6-Dexamethasone) formed more stable complex with pDNA than poly-L-lysine (PLL). In vitro transfection assay showed that R3L6-Dexamethasone had higher transfection efficiency than PLL. Furthermore, MTT assay suggests that R3L6-Dexamethasone was not toxic to cells. Therefore, R3L6-Dexamethasone may be useful for combinational delivery of dexamethasone and pDNA.",

            "text": "Active-induced modulation of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) gene in human brain cancer Hypoxia is a crucial factor in tumour aggressiveness and its treatment resistance, particularly in human brain cancer. Tumour resistance against radiation-and chemo-therapy is facilitated by oxygenation reduction at tumour areas. HIF-1a regulated genes are mostly responsible for this type of resistance. Among these genes, carbonic anhydrase isoform 9 (CA9) is highly overexpressed in many types of cancer especially in high grade brain cancer like GBM. CA-IX contributes to tumour environment acidification by catalyzing the carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons, leading to the acquisition of metastasic phenotypes and chemoresistance to weakly basic anticancer drugs and therefore to inadequate application of radio-therapeutic or chemotherapeutic anti-cancer treatment strategies. Inhibition of this enzymatic activity by application of specific chemical CA9 inhibitors (sulphonamide derivative compounds) or indirect inhibitors like HIF-1a inhibitors (chetomin) or molecular inhibitors like CA9-siRNA leads to reversion of these processes, leading to the CA9 functional role inhibition during tumourigenesis. Hypoxia significantly influences the tumour microenvironment behaviour via activation of genes involved in the adaptation to the hypoxic stress. It also represents an important cancer prognosis indicator and is associated with aggressive growth, malignant progression, metastasis and poor treatment response. The main objective in malignant GBM therapy is either to eradicate the tumour or to convert it into a controlled, quiescent chronic disease. Sulfonamide derivative compounds with CA9 inhibitory characteristics represent one of the optimal treatment options beside other CA9 inhibitory agents or chemical inhibitory compounds against its main regulating transcription factor which is the hypoxia induced HIF-1 a when applied against human cancers with hypoxic regions like GBM, bearing potential for an effective role in brain tumour therapy.",

In this research adult male Wistar rats aged 14-15 weeks with initial body weight 270 \u00b1 30 g divided in three groups: First group is control group and received physiological saline 2 ml per rat. Second group received 0.5 mg/kg Haloperidol in physiological saline and the third group received 0.5 mg/kg Alprazolam in physiological saline. The animals received drugs orally with gastric gavages for 28 days. The rats were anesthetized by ether 24 hours after ending the experimental period. Bloods were collected by direct cardiac puncture. After centrifugation of the blood samples, the isolated plasma from these blood samples analyzed and measured automatically with the use of chemiluminescent assay. The results of control group in comparison with the treated groups with drugs shows that these drugs have not any significant change and effect on TSH. The amounts for these drugs in relation with this hormone is (PTSH = 0.99[ALP], PTSH = 1.00 [HAL] ) and according to p < 0.05, we haven't any significant change on this hormone. PaTg = 0.00 gained for aTg after treatment with these drugs that show significant changes (p < 0.05). These drugs didn't cause any significant change on aTPO, according to these amounts ( Oligonucleotide conjugates with peptides and peptide-like molecules have a wide application for therapeutics. The artificial ribonucleases based on peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates are capable of cleaving RNA substrates and may be used for modulation of gene expression and inactivation of viral genomes. Synthetic ribonuclease consists of two parts. The first one is an oligonucleotide delivery, which is complementary to a segment of RNA target. And the second one is a functional group that is playing an important role in catalytic center of natural enzymes. Several strategies are used for the preparation of oligonucleotide conjugates with peptides or other compounds containing functional groups. We have designed a novel non-nucleosidic reagent for oligonucleotide labeling and modification based on 3-amino-1,2-propanediol. It is suitable for 5'-end and internal modification of oligonucleotide chain. Advantages of our approach to e.g. are that it offers a wider range of functional group for incorporation. All synthesized phosphoramidites may used to functionalization as of 5'-end as internal position of oligonucleotide during solidphase DNA synthesis. Oligonucleotide syntheses were performed on an ASM-800 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Biosset) on a 0.1 lM scale. Oligonucleotide conjugates were obtained by treatment of anthracene containing oligonucleotide derivative with peptides with maleimide residue. All used peptides have demonstrated high ribonuclease activity on model RNA substrates. Thereby a series of peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates was synthesized. Development of oligonucleotide conjugates for cleaving of RNA at complementary sequence provides new tools for investigation of RNA structure and functions and opens new possibilities for design of therapeutics.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of silymarin against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage to human fibroblasts. The ability of silymarin to stimulate growth was also studied. Methods: Human fibroblasts were used to monitor the effect of silymarin on cell growth and protective effect against hydrogen peroxide. Assessment of cell growth was examined by Brdu incorporation assay. To determine the protective effect of silymarin against H 2 O 2 -induce oxidative stress, cells were pre-treated with silymarin for 18 hours and then H 2 O 2 was added for 3 hours. Cells were also treated with silymarin and H2O2 simultaneously for 3 hours. Results: Silymarin did not have any effect on cell growth at 100 mM/ml and lower. Pre-incubation with silymarin overnight before the application of the hydrogen peroxide, significantly protected fibroblasts against hydrogen peroxide damage (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Silymarin significantly protected human fibroblast cells against oxidative damage the damage induced by the hydrogen peroxide and may be useful for treatment of wound healing. Positively charged dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and its copolymers are used in biomedicine as materials for scaffolds and vectors for DNA delivery. We observed rapid release of the short peptide entrapped in DMAEMA-copolymer scaffold. The aim of this work was to develop method of optimization of release profile of the entrapped peptide without significant cell viability decreasing. Delta-sleep inducing peptide (DSIP) was used as a model short peptide. The scaffolds including DSIP were incubated in spirit and aqueous solutions of natural polyphenols (quercetin, dihydroquercetin and baicalin) for forming additional bonds among polymer, polyphenol and peptide molecules. Polyphenols were selected as modificators since they are negatively charged and have affinity to amino acids. DSIP release was studied in NaCl solution and its concentration was measured by HPLC. Cytotoxicity was studied utilizing various cell cultures. 15, 30 and quite 0% of entrapped peptide released from matrix in process of modification in dihydroquercetin, quercetin and baicalin solutions respectively. The scaffolds changed their color from yellow to brown which can be explained by polyphenol oxidation. DSIP release from the unmodified scaffolds was completed in 1-3 hours in vitro. Dihydroquercetin modification prolonged DSIP release at least to 9 hours (6 and 16% for 0.1-1 mg/ml dihydroquercetin in modification solution for first 30 minutes). 43% DSIP released in the first 30 minutes from quercetin modified scaffolds and 8% from baicalin modified scaffolds. DSIP release from baicalin modified scaffolds was quite completed in 6 hours (16% entrapped DSIP) and no release was observed after. Thus dihydroquercetin showed most optimal profile of the entrapped peptide release. The dihydroquercetin modified scaffolds showed no evident toxicity for suspension and adhesion cell cultures.",

Phage therapy overcomes antibiotic resistance and represents an alternative approach to standard antimicrobial treatment. There are no published studies on the use of phages against Cronobacter spp in vivo. The aim of our study was to prove the effects of isolated Cronobacter-specific phages on renal colonization in a model of urinary tract infection in mice. Methods: Urinary tract infection was induced by transurethral application of Cronobacter turicensis (10 11 cfu). Simultaneously, isolated Cronobacter-specific phages were administered intraperitoneally (10 11 pfu). After 24 hours kidneys and bladder were collected and used for cultivation, analysis of gene expression and oxidative stress markers. Results: In our study phage, therapy reduced the number of Cronobacter colonies in the kidney by 70%. Higher levels of malondialdehyde were reduced by phage therapy without affecting the antioxidant status. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 increased by the infection and was attenuated by phage therapy. Tanacetum vulgare L. (Tansy) has been extensively used in folk medicine for treatment of a variety of medical disorders and the extracted compounds of Tansy species have antitumoral, antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic effects. Tansy belongs to the genus Tanacetum and the family Compositae (Asteraceae). In the present study, 350 g of air dried flowers of Tanacetum vulgare subsp. siculum (Guss.) were extracted sequentially with petroleum ether (3 \u00b7 2L), dichloromethane (3 \u00b7 2L) and methanol (3 \u00b7 2L) obtaining 9 g, 16 g and 21 g of extracts respectively. The dichloromethane (DCM) extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography using gradient elution from 100% petroleum ether to 100% ethyl acetate. Five sesquiterpenes were isolated in order of elution: douglanin (1), ludovicin B (2), ludovicin A (3) 1a-hydroxy-1-deoxo-arglanine (4) and 11,13-dehydro-santonin (5) . The occurrence of these molecules can be rationalized in a single biogenetic pathway. Oxidation reactions were performed on compounds 1 and 2 using PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate) in DCM. After, oxidation reaction of compound 1, an unusual rearrangement was observed for the product 6 yielding peroxidic compounds as a mixture (7) of equilibrating epimers. Compound 8 was obtained following the oxidation reaction of compound 2. The cytotoxic effects of compounds were tested in vitro by using the tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT) assay on A549 (human lung carcinoma epithelial like) cells and V79379A (Chinese hamster lung fibroblast like). In addition, chemotherapy drug cisplatin was tested against A549 and V79379A cell lines to compaire the compounds activities. All of tested compounds induced time-and concentration -dependent high cytotoxic effect. Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer death in the world. Although in the most of cases, surgery represents the only curative treatment, the availability and application of treatment modalities in colon cancer needs to be improved. Therefore, we aimed to determine the cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of carvacrol in a human colon carcinoma cell line, DLD-1. Carvacrol, the main (phenolic) component of essential oils of some aromatic plants like Labiatae family, has several biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, analgesic, anti-angiogenic and antimutagenic. Because of its biological activities, a few studies were established with carvacrol for its anticancer activity. So, carvacrol is greatly preferred for cancer studies. In the present work, the viability of cells treated with carvacrol was investigated by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Ratio of DNA synthesis in the cells was further investigated using BrdU incorporation method. Properties of apoptotic morphology of DLD-1 cells treated with carvacrol were observed after staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide and also DAPI. The results demonstrated that carvacrol exhibited a significant effect on the viability of DLD-1 cells, indicating an IC50 value around 300 lM for 48 hours. DNA synthesis was also inhibited after carvacrol treatment of the cells as a dose-dependent manner. Carvacrol induced the apoptotic morphology in the cells with distinct characteristics as chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and apoptotic blebbing. As a result, carvacrol exhibited cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on DLD-1 cells, indicating that it could be one of candidate compounds for chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for colon cancer. Higher plant polyphenolic secondary metabolites such as flavonoids were assessed to be effective in the defense against free radicals in organism. Isoflavones, mostly known for their estrogenic activity are structurally related to flavonoids and are produced from a branch of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. We assessed the effect of 2'-, 3'-and 4'-methoxy substituted 3-(Xbenzylidene)-4-chromanones on mitochondria respiration and antioxidant defenders (reduced glutathione and glutathione related enzymes as glutathione peroxidase glutahione reductase and superoxide dismutase). Parallel measurement by addition of humic acids to the mixture was done. All three compounds lowered coupling, however 2'-, 4'-methoxy isofavones displayed clear respiration inhibition. Different degree of mitochondria respiration defects resulted in increased superoxide dismutase activities. Under 2'-, 4'-methoxy analogues treatment reduced glutathione depletion jointly a glutathione reductase significant increase corresponding to mitochondria destruction were observed. Still, with nearly unchanged glutathione peroxidase activities. Quantity of experimental work deals with the possibility of direct thiol oxidation by superoxide radicals giving the sulfinyl radicals. Come to a conclusion, two of selected compound with stated prooxidant effect evoked glutathione peroxidase inhibition in excess. Collated 3'-methoxy analogue seems to have beneficial effect. Treatment with humic acid showed to held up maximal activity of respiratory chain. This partial uncoupling effect alone could prevent increased phosphorylation that would inhibit respiration so that effected preventively to mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition. Antioxidant enzyme activities were estimated to embody lowered level of oxidative stress conditions. Despite relatively low solubility in aqueous solutions, humic acids participated in redox regulation. The study was supported by VEGA 1/0799/09. Animal venoms are a treasure trove for pharmacology. In particular, spider venom typically contains many dozen or even hundreds of components specifically and efficiently affecting different targets. Some spider toxins are nowadays routinely used in neurobiology as precise research tools. The vast potential of spider venom constituents as novel drug leads is widely recognized. From venoms of several European and Central Asian spiders, we isolated a novel family of homologous peptides named purotoxins. These peptides contain 30-35 residues and are cross-linked by 3-4 disulfide bridges. Recombinant purotoxins were produced at considerable yields in Escherichia coli (5 mg per 1 l of culture) and were then used for functional and structural studies. 3D structure of purotoxin-1 (PT1) from Geolycosa sp. (Lycosidae) features the inhibitor cystine knot motif typical for spider toxins, which probably also occurs in other members of the family. Purotoxins were found to modulate purinergic P2X receptors, which are implicated in pain sensation, in sensory neurons of mammals. Particularly, PT1 inhibits P2X3 receptors at nanomolar concentrations (IC5010 nM) probably by stabilizing the desensitized state. In animal models, PT1 was able to effectively alleviate evoked pain at doses (0.05 mg/kg) much lower than that of conventional pain killers. The new family of spider venom peptides is attractive in terms of novel analgesics development.",

The increased activity of the protein kinase is associated with several pathologies, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, liver diseases and cancer. The ASK1 inhibitors may become important compounds for the development of clinical agents. The main aim of our research is to identify potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors of ASK1. In order to discover novel ASK1 inhibitors we have performed screening program, using both in silico and in vitro approaches. The system based on DOCK 4.0 package was used to study receptor-ligand flexible docking. The virtual screening experiments were carried out targeting the ATP binding site of ASK1 by browsing the compound library of 156,000 organic compounds. The most promising 172 compounds having docking score less than -50 kcal/mol have been taken for the kinase assay study. In vitro experiments revealed that ethyl 2,7-dioxo-2,7-dihydro-3H-naphtho[1,2,3-de]quinoline-1-carboxylate (NQDI-1) inhibited ASK1 with a Ki of 500 nM.

To examine the structure-activity relationships of the derivatives of 3H-naphtho [1,2,3-de] quinoline-2,7-dione the structural ana-logues have been tested in vitro. The in silico analysis of ASK1 complexes with studied compounds indicated, that compounds providing hydrogen bonding capability with hinge region of ATP-binding site were shown to be potent inhibitors of ASK1. These results strongly suggest that the core structure of this class of compounds can be used for the development of more potent and selective inhibitors of ASK1.",

Dexketoprofen trometamol is a water-soluble salt of the dextrorotatory enantiomer of non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drug ketoprofen. The advantages of this product compared with ketoprofen are faster onset of action, increased potency and possibly decreased potential for gastrointestinal side effects. Although it is found that chondrocytic cell proliferation and cell death are affected by certain non-selective NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors, there is no available data about the effect of dexketoprofen trometamol on chondrocytes. We hypothesized that intra-articular drug administration on postoperative pain could be a new therapeutic approach with limited or any systemic side effects. For this purpose, initially, the cytotoxic effects of the drug (ArvelesTM, dexketoprofen trometamol) on the chondrocytes were determined in vitro using mice primary articular chondrocyte culture. The culture of chondrocytes is one of the most powerful tools for exploring the intracellular and molecular features of chondrocytes. Several culture models have proved useful for studying chondrocyte function, such as primary cultures of rabbit, bovine or rat chondrocytes. Cell lines from chondrosarcoma produce larger numbers of cells but have tumorigenic properties that may fail to replicate physiological processes. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of ArvelesTM on mice primary articular chondrocyte culture. Therefore, chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage obtained from knees of 5-6 days old mice. Following the characterization of chondrocytes, cytotoxic effects of the drug were determined using MTT test. Primary cells were treated with drug for 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes exposure times at different concentrations. At the end of time intervals, including 24, 48 and 72 hours, primary mouse chondrocytes were highly affected by all concentrations of drug treatment compared to control groups. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a) pays a pivotal role in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis and others. Antibodies (Abs) to TNF-a are effective in the treatment of these diseases however the treatment is rather expensive. Optimization of recombinant Abs production can decrease expenses for the treatment of chronic diseases. Among many cell lines CHO DG44 cell are approved for the production of therapeutic Abs. The aim of this work was the optimization and improvement of Abs production in CHO DG44 cells. The genes of anti-TNF-a Abs were expressed in CHO DG44 cells using OptiCHO and pcDNA3.3 plasmids (Invitrogen) containing nucleotide sequences of light and heavy Abs chains, accordingly. After three rounds of selection using thymidine and hypoxanthine deficient selective medium supplemented with antibiotic geneticin and methotrexate the level of Abs production was around 60 mg/ml. To increase the Abs yield we used three approaches: encapsulation of recombinant cells in alginate beads; cell sorting using anti-human IgG Abs; and addition of supplements into culture medium such as glucose, L-glutamine, or yeast extract for the high density cultures. We showed that encapsulation of DG44 cells led to the increase in Abs yield from 90 mg/ml to 106 mg/ml (+18%). The Abs are concentrated within the capsules that makes their isolation easier. Addition of supplements into culture medium permitted to increase the Abs production from 90 to 125 mg/ml (+39%). The best results were obtained using cell sorting of recombinant DG44 cells. For this end, we labeled live cells with anti-human IgG-FITC conjugates and sorted around 5-10% of brightly positive cells. Cell sorting increased the Abs yield by 48% to 50% in two sets of sorting resulting finally in 134 mg/ml of Abs. We concluded that cell sorting is a preferable method to increase the Abs production in stably transformed culture. b-lactam antibiotics represent one of the most important contributions to medical treatments in recent years. The widespread and continued use of b-lactam antibiotics has caused the bacteria to acquire resistance to these antibiotics. TEM-1 class A beta-lactamase is a plasmid-mediated b-lactamase encountered in E. coli commonly and has significantly contributed to resistance against b-lactam antibiotics. The use of b-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP), which exhibits high affinity for b-lactamases, is an effective strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance. Here, the in vivo inhibition potential of b -lactamase and BLIP was examined by using E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, harboring the pUC18 plasmid vector and pET-26sj plasmid vector, which contains BLIP gene for simultaneous expression of b-lactamase and BLIP. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pUC18 and pET-26 plasmids were used as control. b-lactamase activity per viable cell count in the presence and absence of BLIP production was measured. The results showed that b-lactamase activity per viable cell of E. coli BL21(DE3) pUC18 pET-26sj and E. coli BL21(DE3) pUC18 pET-26 are nearly the same in the absence of BLIP production. Induction of BLIP production led to a 35 fold decrease in b-lactamase activity per viable cell compared to the control set. The interaction between b-lactamase and BLIP in E. coli BL21(DE3) pUC18 pET-26sj cells is also shown by native gel electrophoresis. Objective: Glucocorticosteroids (GCs) are strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents and applied in the treatment of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). The mechanism of action is still poorly understood. This work was aimed to investigate the role of Prednisolone in degradation effects of interleukin-1a (IL-1a) on Bovine nasal cartilage (BNC). Materials and Methods: Fresh Bovine nasal cartilage (BNC) samples were shortly prepared, from slautherhouse under sterile conditions. Explants of BNC were treated with the both Prednisolone (1000 nM) and IL-la (10 ng/ml) at the same time for 28 days. The morphology of chondrocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) of explants were assessed by using histology techniques. The cell viability was evaluated by using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cytotoxic detection kit. On the days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28, the media of the different wells were replenished and their conditioned media were frozen and stored at -20\u00b0C. Western immunoblots were performed to determine the effects of Prednisolone and IL-la on the MMP-1 expression. Results: In the presence of IL-la, nuclei of chondrocytes were either enlarged or pyknotic. Cell membrane of most chondrocytes, and the edges of cartilage explants were thoroughly disappeared. Chondrocytes morphology changes were partially decreased in Prednisolone group. No increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the presence of both IL-la and Prednisolone was found in culture medium. Prednisolone, showed significant inhibition on MMP-1 expression induced by IL-1a.",

They have received significant attention for their effectiveness, lack of immunogenicity as well as low toxicity. Poly(hydroxyalkylene imine) (pHP), a novel cationic polymer, has been described as an efficient reagent for gene delivery in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of the cellular pathway involved in pHP mediated gene transfer has not been elucidated. Here we present the results of our investigation on the cellular interaction, uptake and intracellular trafficking of pHP-DNA complexes in HeLa cells. Endocytic pathway was delineated based on the process sensitivity to different chemical / pharmacological inhibitors. Transfection was significantly reduced by cholesterol oxidase, known to affect lipid raft / caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and partially blocked by Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor EIPA, known to hamper macropinocytosis. Considering that endocytic pathways should not be deemed as mutually exclusive, since more than one entry mechanism may be operational, we conclude that pHP-DNA complexes are internal-ized primarily through caveosomes with lesser fraction entering cells through macropinosomes. Internalized complex localization was visualized and confirmed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Having the knowledge of pHP-mediated gene transfer mechanism will allow us to device strategies to direct the delivery and control the action of therapeutic agents inside the cell.",

The clinical manifestation of protein drug immunogenicity ranges from lack of complications to aggravated conditions, including severe anaphylaxis and autoimmune responses. To date, the reasons for the immunogenicity of protein therapeutics are not fully understood. Here, we show that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contribute to the immunogenicity of two interferon-b (IFN b) pharmaceuticals. We have found that the level of antibodies (Abs) against human IFNb in sera of multiple sclerosis patients treated with either IFNb-1a (Rebif\u00d2 or IFNb-1b (Betaferon\u00d2) correlates positively with the level of Abs against AGEs. Over 50% of anti-IFNb Abs+ sera have demonstrated cross-reactivity with AGEs, which implies that AGEs form immunogenic epitopes on IFNb. Consistent with these results, we have shown that IFNb-1a and IFNb-1b contain the products of advanced glycation Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and imidazolone. Immunoassay performed with anti-CML and anti-imidazolone Abs provides further evidence for the immunogenic nature of AGEs in IFNb. Finally, using Escherichia coli-derived human interferon-gamma (rhIFNb) as a model, we propose strategies for prevention of AGEs formation in therapeutic proteins. Aims: The photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective local cancer treatment that induces cytotoxicity through intercellular generation of reactive oxygen species. The oxidative stress is a factor which initiates the cell death during photodynamical reaction. The aim of this study was to assess photodynamic therapy in vitro which induces apoptosis in the human amelanotic melanoma C32 cell line. We examined the cells viability, expression of three caspases associated with apoptosis and the photosensitizer localization. Methods: The Photofrin was used for the photodynamic reaction in vitro as a photosensitizer. The cells were incubated for 18 hours with 20 lg/ml of Ph in DMEM (medium). Than they were irradiated 10 minutes with the light intensity of 10 mW/cm2 using a lamp with polarized light and red filter (632.8 nm). The cells viability was determined by cloning efficacy test.

Drosophila larval salivary gland polythene chromosomes puffing pattern under increased and decreased endogenous nitric oxide production was investigated. Expression of key apoptosis regulating genes, grim and hid, under nitric oxide and heat stress influences was studied comprehensively: by the appearance of mRNA transcripts, corresponding polypeptides, tissue specificity of protein products and on functional level -by the apoptosis induction. Using endogenous donors and inhibitors of nitric oxide we demonstrated that high concentrations of intracellular nitric oxide is a strong apoptosis inducer that even cytoprotective protein Hsp70 is not able to suppress NO-induced apoptosis and mediated by proapoptotical grim and hid genes products.

Bruni 1,2 1 Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche, Viale GB Morgagni, Firenze 2 IIM Istituto Interuniversitario di Miologia Skeletal muscle regeneration involves resident stem cells called satellite cells that are usually quiescent and become activated after tissue injury. The recovery of skeletal muscle is altered by fibrosis, in which transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFb1) plays a prominent role. Recent studies have shown that some effects elicited by cytokines are dependent on regulation of sphingosine kinase (SK), which catalyzes the biosynthesis of the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) that, in turn, regulates many cellular responses, mainly acting as ligand of distinct membrane receptors (S1P1-5). We recently identified a new mechanism by which TGFb1 enhances muscle fibrosis that involves the induction of SK1/S1P3 expression in C2C12 myoblasts. Interestingly, the cytokine was also found capable of up-regulating S1P4 mRNA, even though this effect was disengaged from TGFb1-induced pro-fibrotic effect. In this study the role exerted by S1P4 in TGFb1-treated myoblasts was investigated. TGFb1 challenge (5 ng/ml) of serum-deprived or staurosporine-treated myoblasts for 24 hours exerted a remarkable apoptotic effect, as assessed by caspase-3 activity assay and Poly-ADP-ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Notably, myoblasts stably transfected with a plasmid encoding S1P4 were more responsive to TGFb1-induced apoptosis, in comparison with empty vector-myoblasts. In agreement, when S1P4 was specifically silenced, TGFb1-induced apoptosis was dramatically decreased. In order to study the signaling pathways triggered by S1P4, the activation of downstream effectors, ERK1-2, Akt, p38MAPK, was also analyzed: interestingly, in S1P4-overexpressing myoblasts Akt phosphorylation induced by 1 lM S1P was significantly lower, indicating a major role of Akt inhibition in the S1P4-mediated response. These findings increase the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in muscle regeneration that are crucial for the improvement of new therapies for degenerative muscle disorders. Apoptosis represents a cellular 'suicide' mechanism which keeps the cell number in tissues between normal limits and allows the elimination of cells presenting DNA mutations or having an aberrant cell cycle, cells predisposed to malignant transformation. The chemo-preventive efficacy has been associated to enhanced apoptosis; therefore any therapeutic strategy that specifically triggers apoptosis in cancer cells might have potential immunotherapeutic value. Anti-cancer drugs might exert their action during physiological pathways of apoptosis, leading to tumour cell destruction. Traditional anti-cancer therapies have limited effects, therefore the cytotoxic action exerted by drugs (e.g. 5-fluorouracyl) on tumors might be added by natural compounds (apigenin/ APG, quercetin/QCT, curcumin/CRM, genistein/GST) and the signaling mechanisms or apoptosis pathways influenced. The present study focuses on the influence of the treatment with 5-FU and/or natural compounds on antigen versus gene expression of molecules involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (P53, Bcl-2). Apoptotic events and progression through cell cycle phases were evaluated in colon tumour cell lines with different rates of proliferation (Colo201, LoVo, HT29, SW1116). Percentages of apoptotic cells were analyzed by using Annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining, while progression through cell cycle phases was estimated by using PI staining, both followed by flow-cytometry analysis. Gene expression was detected by qRT-PCR, and correlated to the antigen expression detected by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting or flow-cytometry. New therapeutic approaches could be more useful for destruction of tumor cells and renewal of the cellular pathways that lead directly to apoptosis, contributing to the immunotherapeutic management of cancer. Actinomycin D inhibits transcription by binding DNA at the transcription initiation complex and it can also interfere with DNA replication. Inner way of apoptosis is triggered in actinomycin D-treated cells by hdm2 inhibition, p53 stabilization, Puma activation and consecutively mitochondrial depolarization. Apaf1/cyt c/caspase 9 apoptosome activates executive caspases and large apoptosis is observed in CML-T1 cell line as well as in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Redistribution of nucleolar protein nucleolin (NCL, C23) from a nucleolus into a nucleoplasm and enhanced nucleophosmin (NPM, B23) expression in the nucleolus is observed together with the apoptotic changes. We investigated whether there were some interactions between these nucleolar proteins and proteins concerned in apoptosis and how these interactions are influenced by actinomycin D. Combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence methods was used. Yeast two hybrid analyse identified the nucleophosmin/p53 and nucleolin/p53 interactions. Both of these interactions were for-merly mentioned in literature. Fluorescence microscopy showed that actinomycin D-stabilized p53 protein is localized mainly in nucleoplasm and therefore there is a possibility of its interaction with relocalized nucleolar proteins. Strong B23/p53 interaction was observed by immunoprecipitation in native cells and in cells treated by actinomycin D for up to 6 hours. On the other hand, C23/p53 interaction was observed only in actinomycin D-treated cells. We speculate, that nucleophosmin prevents the apoptosis in cancer cells by suppressing p53 in early phase of apoptosis, whereas nucleolin could potentiate the p53 apoptotic activity facilitating its transport. This work was supported by the grants IGA NS 9637-4 and IGA VZ00023736 from the MHCR. It is known that inborn errors of purine metabolism are often associated with psychomotor dysfunctions, but the molecular link between the metabolic disorders and the neurological manifestations remains in most cases unclear. The deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine, is associated with severe immune deficiency and abnormalities in the functioning of many organs such as bone, liver, kidney and nervous system. We have mimicked an ADA-deficient situation by incubating a human astrocytoma cell line (ADF) in the presence of the strong ADA inhibitor deoxycoformycin (dCF) and deoxyadenosine (dAdo), which accumulates in vivo when the enzyme is deficient, and have monitored the effect of the combination on cell viability, mitochondrial functions, and other metabolic features. Cells incubated in the presence of dAdo and dCF in combination, but not those incubated with dAdo or dCF alone, underwent apoptotic death, which appears to proceed through a mitochondrial pathway, since release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation have been observed. The inhibition of ADA affects mitochondrial functionality as well, because an alteration in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species level has been revealed. A surprising effect of dAdo and dCF in combination is the significant reduction in lactate production, which is suggestive of a reduced glycolytic capacity, not ascribable to an alteration in NAD+/NADH ratio. This is a hithertho unknown effect presenting early during the incubation with dAdo and dCF, which precedes their effect on cell viability. We are presently investigating on the possible connection between lactate decrease and induction of the apoptotic program. Endotoxins can cause serious damage and death of liver cells by triggering the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-6 in Gram-negative bacterial infections. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major cell wall constituents of Gram-negative bacteria that initiate well known effects of systemic response in the process of sepsis. Kupffer cells are the most important source of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the inhibition of Kupffer cell activation may decrease the damage of the liver caused by LPS. Erythropoietin (EPO) is widely used in the treatment of anemia due to chronic renal failure. Recent studies revealed that EPO performs cell protection and anti-inflammatory effects via erytropoietin receptors. The aim of the present experimental study were to investigate the possible hepatoprotective effects of EPO in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia by evaluating the histological parameters of Caspase 9 as a cell apoptosis marker and also to evaluate its effect on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 as hepatocyte inflammation markers. We used Sprague-Dawley(350-400 g) mature male rats. We categorized the rats into three groups. Group 1: a control group (n = 6); group 2: an LPS (20 mcg/kg, intra peritoneal) applied group (n = 6); group 3: an EPO (3000 u/kg, intra peritoneal) application 30 minutes before LPS (n = 6). The rats were decapitated 4 hours after the LPS administration, and the blood samples were examined liver function tests, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 counts were performed. Histopathologic examination was also performed. The results revaluated that LPS administration caused an increase in AST, ALT levels as well as inflammation parameters such as TNF-alpha, IL-6. Those parameters were significantly higher in group 2 than in Group 1. The results revealed that EPO administration before endotoxemia prevents increase in inflammation parameters and decreases liver cell damage. Histopathologic examination revealed that LPS administered group showed hepatocyte degeneration, mild inflammatory infiltration in portal areas and Kupffer cell proliferation in sinuzoids. EPO administered rats before LPS application showed minimal histopathology changes. Statistically significant difference was detected between EPO pre-treated, control and LPS groups in caspase variable. Caspase scores are lower in EPO and control group. In the present experimental study it was shown that EPO have protective effects on the inflammatory process and cell apoptosis during inflammatory states.",

Several approaches have been recently proposed to antagonize this protein family for therapeutic purposes, among which the design of pro-apoptotic IAP-binding compounds able to induce death in malignant cells. Among these compounds, a specific class mimics the N-terminus (AVPI) of Smac/DIABLO, the natural endogenous IAPs inhibitor. Materials: X-ray crystallography was used to address this biological problem, together with fluorescence binding assays, thermal stability experiments and in silico docking searches in order to characterize the Smac-mimetics binding to IAPs and develop more potent compounds. Results: Here we present the crystal structure of the BIR3 domain from one member of the IAP family, cIAP1, in complex with Smac037, a smac-mimetic known to potently bind to the XIAP-BIR3 domain and to induce cIAPs degradation. The structural comparison between the cIAP1-BIR3/Smac037 and the XIAP-BIR3/Smac037 complexes is also reported, to highlight the structural conservation and properties of the IBM (Iap Binding Motif) groove in both homolog IAP domains. The superposition of cIAP1-BIR3/Smac-AVPI complex to the structure here presented suggests the gain of two interactions in the cIAP1-BIR3/ Smac037 complex, explaining the higher affinity of Smac037 relative to the natural Smac-AVPI peptide. Thermal stability and fluorescence polarization assays are also shown to prove the stabilizing effect and the high affinity of Smac037 on XIAP-, cIAP1-and cIAP2-BIR3 domains. As shown in our previous work for cIAP1, we report the effective degradation of cIAP2 induced by the Smac037 through western blot experiments. Conclusions: This work presents Smac037 as a lead compound for cancer therapy, describing its high affinity towards the target proteins, and its ability to simultaneously interfere with two important apoptotic pathways, where XIAP and cIAPs, respectively, play crucial roles. Human infection by the protozoan pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis causes one of most common sexually transmitted diseases throughout the world. It emerges as an important cofactor in amplifying HIV transmission and is associated to cervical cancer, atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Iron is an essential element for in vitro and in vivo survival of microorganisms, acting as a cofactor of several enzymes and playing a critical role in host-parasite relationship. Only the more virulent strains, endowed with effective mechanisms to acquire iron from healthy hosts can invade, colonize, multiply and establish infection. In this work, T. vaginalis grown in iron-rich and iron-depleted media were analyzed with the aim of investigate the effect of iron depletion in (i) the peptidase expression profile of parasites, (ii) the process of cytotoxicity and adherence of the parasites to epithelial cells, and (iii) the ultrastructure of parasites. Withdrawal of iron from the culture medium resulted in dramatic changes in both the morphology and peptidase expression of T. vaginalis. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that in iron-depleted conditions, trophozoites underwent transformation from ellipsoid or amoeboid forms to rounded cells, whose flagella and axostyle were internalized. This morphological transformation is followed by down-regulation of peptidase expression as well as decreased adherence and low toxicity of parasites to epithelial cells. TUNEL assays revealed that iron depletion did not affect the integrity and viability of T. vaginalis pseudocysts. Finally, inoculation of pseudocysts in iron-rich medium recovered the trophozoyte phenotype.",

We plan to investigate the glycosylation of BIM BH3 domain peptides utilizing experimental and computational studies. In this part, we study theoretically the biophysical property changes of mutant BIM BH3 domain peptides upon chemical glycosylation. The results showed that glycosylation will stabilize the structure of the BIM peptide causing a decrease in the total internal energy, an increase in helicity, a new H-bonds between glycans and the mutant BIM peptide, a decrease on the mutant BIM peptide's H-bonds with solvent and a decrease on the peptide solvent accessible area maintaining it biologically active when it is bound to the pro-apoptotic BAX protein.

Probably the best known metal for cancer therapy is cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)]. It has been widely used in the treatment of variety of cancers like testicular, ovarian, bladder, cervical, smallcell and non-small-cell lung cancers. The success of cisplatin as an anticancer drug prompted medical researchers to use of metals, including platinum derivatives such as carboplatin, oxoplatin, nedaplatin, lobaplatin, ruthenium and gold compounds, in anticancer medicine. Gold and platinum compounds are very significant therapeutic agents because of fewer side effects than existing metal anticancer drugs. Au(III) complexes, with their metal centers being isoelectronic and isostructural to Pt(II), are thus promising candidates as anticancer agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic, antitumoral and apoptotic properties of gold(III) and platinum(II) complexes as a potential anticancer drug lead. After synthesis of test copmpounds, MTT assay was used to investigate the cytotoxic effects of materials and antitumoral effect was determined by colony forming ability assay (CFA) .

Results showed that both complexes, [Au(5-Cl-phen)Cl2] Cl and [Pt(5-Cl-phen)Cl2], have significant effect on cells but Pt(II) complexes are much better effective than gold complexes and also have better antitumor effect. In conclusion, our data showed that [Pt(5-Cl-phen)Cl2] complexes may be used in the development of therapeutic agents for lung cancer. The unicellular budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can undergo a programmed cell death (PCD) process which resembles mammalian apoptosis in both morphological and molecular aspects [1] . Due to the high degree of conservation of genes and pathways between S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes, yeast is a favorite model organism to investigate how PCD occurs. By using an experimental system in which PCD is induced by acetic acid (AA-PCD), we have determined how cells die as a function of time en route to AA-PCD and characterized the interrelations among certain molecular processes and components [2] . Different yeast mutant cells were studied to understand the role of oxidative stress, cytochrome c and the metacaspase-encoding YCA1 gene in AA-PCD. We found that cell death can also occur without cytochrome c release and/or YCA1. Data show the existence of two AA-PCD pathways, one in which YCA1 acts upstream of cytochrome c release and caspase-like activity increase in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)dependent manner and another in which cytochrome c release does not occur and caspase-like activation occurs in a ROSindependent manner [3, 4] . In these pathways mitochondria appear to play crucial but different roles in cell death commitment. We aim to investigate the pivotal role of mitochondria as 'receivers, integrators and transmitters' of death signals in PCD pathways, whose dysregulation underlies several human pathologies, such as neurodegeneration and cancer.",

Methods: The female Wistar rats were exposed to whole-body (1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 Gy) and thoracic (5, 10, 20 and 30 Gy) gamma irradiation by 60Co gamma-ray source. One hour post-irradiation the peripheral blood was sampled from the rat by cardiac puncture and lymphocytes were isolated. GammaH2AX was detected immunocytochemically using phospho-specific antibodies, DNA content was counterstained with propidium iodide or 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The cell immunofluorescence intensity or the percentages of gammaH2AX positive cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Differential leukocyte count of peripheral blood was determined on the haematological analyzer 24 hours after irradiation. Results: The fluorescence of gammaH2AX in lymphocytes 1 hour after the whole-body irradiation increases linearly in dosedependent manners. In our experiments, both the mean value of gammaH2AX immunofluorescence in lymphocytes and the percentage of gammaH2AX positive lymphocytes 1 hour after whole-body and thoracic irradiation of rats followed the same tendency and increased significantly for increasing doses. This was accompanied by dose dependent lymphocytopenia 24 hours following whole-body and thoracic irradiation. Microscopic detection after thoracic low-dose irradiation of rats was more sensitive in comparison with flow cytometry. Conclusion: Quantification of phosphorylated histone H2AX in rat lymphocytes could be used as an early screening indicator for estimation of received dose of radiation. The mitochondrion is the major power station of the cell that generates most of the cell's supply of ATP. The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial energy transformation involves the electron transport chain (ETC) that consists of electron transfer complexes I-IV embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ETC converts high energy potential of electrons from NADH and FADH2 into the energy of electrochemical proton gradient across the inner membrane that drives the synthesis of ATP by the ATP-synthase (complex V). Besides, mitochondria participate in the synthesis of many metabolic intermediates, including the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines. The latter process is catalyzed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an FMN flavoprotein in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which transfers electrons from dihydroorotate to ubiquinone of the ETC for further oxidation. The p53 tumor suppressor mediates important quality control functions by limiting proliferation and survival of abnormal or damaged cells. To the date there is little information regarding signals emitted by mitochondria that trigger p53 response. In our study we blocked by specific inhibitors each of the mitochondrial ETC complexes and monitored p53 induction. We conclude that neither the compounds that reduce MMP nor the suppression of ETC activity per se can trigger the p53 response. However, an activation of p53 and an induction of a p53-dependent apoptosis can be elicited specifically by inhibitors of mitochondrial complex III, which cause depletion of pyrimidines through the inhibition of a functionally coupled DHODH. We found that the deficiency in pyrimidines is critical for the induction of p53 in response to ETC complex III inhibitors. The results provide a previously unknown functional link between mitochondrial respiration and the p53 pathway.

Apoptosis as one of the most important physiological processes regulates cellular homeostasis. Loss of cell death regulation is a cause for many disorders such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Following the initiation of the process, caspases execute this type of cell death. Caspases are cystein proteases that recognize and cleave following the aspartate residue. Because of its crucial role in execution phase of apoptosis, Caspase-3 is the most important enzyme in destruction of apoptotic cells. The activity of this enzyme is regulated by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) through its BIR2 domain. The critical role of caspases in apoptosis makes them potential targets for drug development. It has been suggested that molecules which inhibit caspases can be of therapeutic value in suppression of symptoms of certain diseases in which apoptosis occur abnormally. In addition, antagonists of XIAP can induce caspase-3 activity leading to induction of cell death in certain cancers. In order to find inhibitors of caspase activity as well as antagonists of XIAP, total extracts obtained from various soil bacteria endemic to Iran and approximately 500 synthetic compounds were screened. The criterion for enzyme activity was its ability to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate DEVD-pNA to a yellow product that was detected spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Chemical compounds had no effect on caspase or XIAP activity inhibition. While methanol extract from one of the microorganisms was able to inhibit the activity of caspase-3 in a dose dependent manner. It was found that the active component responsible for caspase-3 inhibition had a molecular weight below five kDa making it suitable for clinical applications. The extract failed to inhibit another cysteine protease papain suggesting that it is not a general cysteine protease inhibitor. Presently, isolation of the active ingredient is underway.",

Costanzo Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples Federico II Wilms' tumour 1 protein, WT1, is a zinc finger transcriptional factor that controls the expression of a wide number of genes involved in tissue differentiation, in apoptosis, or in cell cycle control. Moreover, the transcriptional regulatory properties of WT1 are known to be influenced by interaction with an increasing number of molecular partners. Recently, we identified the Kru\u00a8ppel-like zinc finger protein, ZNF224, as a novel human WT1-associating protein and demonstrated that ZNF224 may act as a transcriptional co-regulator of WT1, enhancing the transcriptional activation of the VDR promoter mediated by WT1. The expression of the WT1 transcription factor in leukemic cells is proposed to exert an antiapoptotic effect. However, despite the identification of several WT1 target genes involved the control of apoptosis, little is still known about the molecular mechanisms of WT1 regulation in leukemia cells. In the present study, we analyze the consequences of WT1/ ZNF224 interaction on WT1-dependent transcriptional regulation of apoptotic genes in K562 cell line. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and transient transfection experiments we demonstrate that WT1 recruits ZNF224 on the promoter region of some of its target genes, involved in apoptotic regulation. By siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments we demonstrate that ZNF224/WT1 interaction affect negatively the expression of A1/Bfl1 and bag3 antiapoptotic genes, while modulates positively the expression of VDR and other pro-apoptotic genes.",

Deficient functionality of the apoptosome apparatus (AA) is one of the major factors enabling tumour growth and progression and therapy resistance. To evaluate the functionality of AA in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) we studied the AA activation in cell-free cytosols from NSCLC cells and tissues. Although NSCLC tissues and lungs from surgically treated patients expressed the core protein components of AA including Apaf-1, procaspase-9, -3 and -7, AA was activated by cytochrome-c (cyt-c) and dATP only in 19 of 62 NSCLC tissues and in 5 of 62 matched lungs, as assessed by kinetic fluorometric assay of caspase-3-like activity. Furthermore, the addition of cytc and dATP into the cytosol samples lead to a robust induction of caspase-3-like activity in 4 of 7 examined NSCLC cell lines. Immunoblotting analysis of the (cyt-c+dATP)-activatable cytosols, prepared from CALU-1, SKMES-1, NCI-H520 and LXF-289 cells, showed that procaspase-9 was processed to the p35 and p37 fragments while the p35 fragment was generated before the p37 one. On the other hand, the p35 fragment of procaspase-9 was not detected in the (cyt-c+dATP)-non-activatable cytosols prepared from A549, COLO-699 and SKLU-1 cells. Gel chromatography in combination with immunoblotting analysis of the (cyt-c+dATP)-activated cytosol from CALU-1 cells showed a shift of both Apaf-1 protein and processed caspase-9 (p35 fragment) to the high-Mr fractions, confirming the assembly of AA and its functionality. In conclusion, the results of the present work indicate that the functionality of AA is suppressed in a high proportion of NSCLC tumours and that the recruitment to and/or the activation of procaspase-9 in the apoptosome may underlie the resistance of NSCLC cells cytosol to the (cyt-c+dATP)-induced AA assembly. The novel family of non-coding mitochondrial RNAs (ncmtR-NAs) displays a differential expression pattern according to proliferative status. In both cultured cells and tissue samples, normal proliferating cells express the sense (SncmtRNA) and antisense ncmtRNAs (ASncmtRNA). In contrast, tumor cells express the sense transcript and down-regulate de ASncmtRNAs, while normal resting cells express neither. Treatment with chemically modified oligonucleotides (ODNs) directed against the antisense ncmtRNAs induces massive and selective death of tumor cells, whereas normal cells are unaffected by the same treatment. This tumor cell death elicited molecular and morphological features typical of cell death type I, such as phosphatidylserine transloca-tion, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MOMP), caspase activation, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. At earlier post-transfection times, cell proliferation was inhibited and underwent G1 arrest, followed by hypodiploid events (sub-G1peaks) at 48 hours post-transfection. In addition, we have also observed that cell death is preceded by morphological changes associated to autophagy. At 24 hours post-transfection, we have observed accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, together with LC3-I to LC3-II conversion only in cells treated against the antisense ncmtRNA. Electron microscopy revealed double-membrane structures and mitochondrial collapse only in tumor cells. Our results indicate a tight relationship between expression of the ncmtRNAs and cell proliferation and that death of tumor cells is preceded by autophagy.

However, oxidative stress can disrupt bone remodeling by descending osteoblast activities. Special A-T rich sequences binding protein 2 (SATB2), a transcription factor, binds to A-T rich elements in the promoter regions and then regulate certain gene expression. Previous studies have shown that SATB2 contributes to osteoblast differentiation. This study was aimed to evaluate the roles of SATB2 in oxidative stress-induced osteoblast insults. Exposure of osteo-blasts prepared from neonatal rat calvariae to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) time-dependently increased cellular nitric oxide amounts and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. Simultaneously, SNP decreased cell viability and induced osteoblast apoptosis. Exposure to SNP enhanced amounts of HSP60, COX-2, and HO-1 in rat osteoblasts. In the same way, levels of cytosolic and nuclear SATB-2 in rat osteoblasts were significantly augmented by SNP. Knocking-down SATB2 translation using an RNA interference technique decreased synthesis of this transcription factor and concurrently caused chromosome. In addition, SATB2 knockdown inhibited Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expressions and triggered cell apoptosis. Therefore, we suggest SATB2 can act as a heat shock protein to prevent osteoblasts from oxidative stressinduced insults. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), is a serine/threonine kinase involved in divers signaling pathways and biological processes. Abnormal GSK-3 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, and it has emerged as a prime drug discovery target. GSK-3 is expressed as two isozymes a and b that share high similarity in the catalytic domains, but differ in N-and C-termini, with GSK-3a having an extended glycine-rich N-terminus. Here we used live cell imaging combined with molecular and bioinformatic analyses to understand the distinct biological functions of the GSK-3 isozymes. We found that unlike GSK-3b, which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, GSK-3a was excluded from the nucleus. Deletion of GSK-3a-N terminal region or treatment with leptomycin B resulted in nuclear localization. GSK-3a rapidly accumulated in the nucleus in response to calcium or serum deprivation. This was strongly prevented by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin. We further demonstrated that this nuclear accumulation was mediated by GSK-3abinding with, as yet unknown, calpain-sensitive protein or proteins, via its N-terminal region. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses indicated that nuclear exclusion of GSK-3a is likely an exclusive characteristic of mammalian GSK-3a. Finally, we show that nuclear localization of GSK-3a reduced the nuclear pool of b-catenin and its target cyclin D1. These data suggest that the Nterminal region of GSK-3a is responsible for its nuclear exclusion, and its binding with a calcium/calpain sensitive product enables GSK-3a nuclear retention. We further uncovered a novel link between calcium and nuclear GSK-3a mediated inhibition of the canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in important physiological functions in higher plants, such as response to abiotic stress (temperature, light, drought), regulation of seed dormancy and germination, control of stomatal closure and of gene transcription. Previously, our group demonstrated endogenous ABA synthesis in marine organism in which ABA levels are related to intracellular calcium traffic. The increase of the [Ca2+]i stimulates oxygen consumption, water filtration and protein synthesis in sponges and tissue regeneration in Hydroids. The most exposed cells to environmental stimuli in the animals are granulocytes; in fact they represent the first line of defense against pathogens. An increase of the [Ca2+]i via cADPR is known to stimulate the functional activities of human granulocytes and ABA has been identified as a new endogenous proinflammatory hormone in human granulocytes and monocytes. In these cells, ABA stimulates several functional activities (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production, chemotaxis) and, as monocytes are involved in inflammation and immunity, the research of molecules ABA antagonists can lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs in inflammation pathologies ABA mediated. This work concerned the synthesis and structural characterization of new synthesized ABA analogs useful as potential ABA antagonist. After synthesis, carried out in liquid phase starting from ABA scaffold or a and b ionone, all the crude powders were submitted to HPLC-ESI-MS for their purification and identification. Further analysis were performed by MS2 using an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD ion trap instrument both in the negative or positive ion mode. These measures were carried out on-line on isolated signals or off-line on molecules purified by preparative HPLC, allowing structural characterization of some products to be tested as potentially active agonists or antagonist. Nuclear receptors from D. melanogaster are valuable models for studying the mechanisms of transcription regulation in higher organisms. The ultraspiracle protein (USP) belongs to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily and together with the ecdysone receptor (EcR) forms a functional EcR/USP complex that mediates the effects of the steroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. Up until now there has been no study about USP sumoylation -an important post-translational modification made by small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins (SUMOs) that regulate diverse cellular processes. To investigate the sumoylation of USP we used a Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation (UFDS) system. We prepared constructs that coded fusion proteins where Ubc9 (SUMO-conjugating enzyme, E2) was placed to the N-or C-terminus of USP. After expression in HEK293 line, cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with an Ubc9 antibody. The results revealed that USP is modified by SUMO1 and SUMO3 regardless of the Ubc9 location. Modifications in USP also occurred when USP was coexpressed with its partner -EcR and the EcR ligand, muristerone A. In order to identify the sumoylation sites in USP we used mutated SUMO1 (T95R) and mass spectrometry. This method enabled us to identify the USP sumoylation residues: K20 in the A/B region and K506 in the ligand binding domain. Further consequences of the sumoylation of USP are currently being studied. In hemopoietic M07e cells, stem cell factor (SCF) activates glucose transport through GLUT1 translocation from intracellular stores. Recently, it has been reported that in many cell types GLUT1 is localized in part in detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains and a role for lipid rafts in GLUT1 stimulation has been suggested. We investigated whether a plasma membrane cholesterol depletion might play a role in GLUT1 activity. Cell exposure to 10 mM methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MBCD) for 20 minutes resulted in a loss of cholesterol from plasma membrane, without affecting viability. MBCD-treated cells exhibited a rise in glucose uptake, higher than that observed upon SCF treatment. The combined cell treatment with SCF and MBCD determined a further increase in glucose uptake, showing an additive effect. Membrane fractionation by flotation on sucrose density gradient showed that in untreated cells most of GLUT1 is distributed in the high-density region, but a little amount is colocalized with lipid raft marker proteins in low-density regions, corresponding to DRM. Upon MBCD treatment, GLUT1 resulted totally confined to the high-density region. DRM exhibited also the highest cholesterol content. The cholesterol distribution profile of the MBCD-treated samples shows that the cholesterol preferentially decreased in DRM, confirming its selective depletion. Cell membrane isolation by biotinylation and immunofluorescence staining indicated that MBCD treatment, like SCF stimulation, greatly enhanced the amount of GLUT1 at cell surface, promoting a translocation from intracellular stores. MBCD increases Akt-pS473, while SCF positively regulates PLCc signaling cascade, both involved in GLUT translocation and in glucose uptake control. Therefore, these two stimuli could proceed through distinct signalling pathways. In summary, a mild lipid environment alteration in lipid rafts enhances GLUT1 activity in M07e cells via a cholesterol-dependent mechanism, possibly involving Akt. Regeneration of mammalian skeletal muscle following injury is mediated by muscle resident stem cells, named satellite cells (SCs). These cells, are normally quiescent but, after myotrauma, proliferate and differentiate into multinucleated myofibers. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid involved in the regulation of many critical biological processes, such as cell proliferation, survival, and migration. S1P exerts most of its actions by binding to five specific G protein-coupled S1P receptors, namely S1P1-5. We previously demonstrated that in C2C12 myoblasts S1P regulates myogenesis, by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing myogenic differentiation by ligation to S1P2 [1] . Here, to further investigate the role of S1P in muscle repair, we have characterized the biological action of S1P in SCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, 1 lM S1P was found to enhance SC proliferation, evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Moreover, the investigation of S1P receptor involvement in the S1P-induced proliferation, accomplished by different means, such as pre-treatment with pharmacological agonists and antagonists and RNA interference, highlighted a major role for S1P3 and a partial involvement of S1P2. In addition, the effect of S1P on SC migration was evaluated by performing wound healing and Boyden chambers experiments: 1 lM S1P was identified as pro-migratory cue, mainly acting through S1P1 ligation. Finally, by employing SCs isolated from S1P2-knock-out mice, S1P was also found to promote differentiation of SCs into myotubes through specific interaction with S1P2. These findings increase the present knowledge on the role of S1P in skeletal muscle regeneration, opening new perspectives for individuating in the S1P action mechanism new pharmacological tools to improve the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle. Introduction: Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that acts through G-protein-coupled receptors. While it is well established that PACAP, a VIP-related peptide, mediates renoprotective effects, the role of VIP at the kidney level remains incompletely characterized. In this study, we analyzed the effects of VIP exposure of non-tumour (HK-2) and tumour (A498) human proximal tubular epithelial cell lines on cell viability and proliferation as well as the molecular events involved in these processes. Both renal cell lines are known to express VIP and VPAC receptors. Methods: We evaluated the effect of VIP on cell viability by the MTT assay and on cell proliferation by [H3]-Tymidine and BrdU assays. Flow cytometry following annexin V and propidium double -staining was used to exclude cell death by necrosis or apoptosis. Results: Both viability and proliferation of HK-2 and A498 cells after 0.1 lM VIP exposure for 24 hours, were significantly reduced as compared to control values. Both responses, however, were higher in tumoural cells as compared to non-tumoural cells. Signal transduction pathways involved in the VIP-induced antiproliferative effect, as measured by the BrdU assay, appear to be modulated by different routes. In the non-tumoural cells HK-2, the effect is mediated by ERK1/2 whereas in the tumoral cells A498, it is mediated by PI3-K. In both cell lines, PKA is involved in basal effects. These features were evaluated by the corresponding kinase inhibitors. Conclusions: These results suggest an anti-proliferative potential of endogenous VIP in renal cells. Thus, VIP receptors could be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of various renal disorders. Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) activation can be also induced by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which represent the largest group of cell surface receptors exerting a variety of biological functions. Transactivation of RTKs by GPCRs serves as a paradigm for inter-receptor cross-talk, combining the broad diversity of GPCR with the potent signalling capacities of RTKs. We investigated the ability of the GPCR Formyl Peptide Receptor Like 1 (FPRL1) to transactivate the RTKs c-Met, EGFR and Axl in non-tumoral and tumoral human cells (PNT1A, Calu6 and IMR90). The results showed that the stimulation of these cells with the FPRL1 agonist WKYMVm induces the phosphorylation of cytosolic tyrosines of c-Met, EGFR and Axl, which is prevented by the synthetic FPRL1 antagonist WRW4 and by PTX, a selective inhibitor of Gi protein coupled to FPRL1. This suggests that RTKs trans-phosphorylation depends by FPRL1 activation. Moreover, the FPRL1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs is prevented by pre-treatment with DPI and apocynin, a generic and a selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and by silencing of NADPH oxidase. These data indicate a key role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the transactivation process. WKYMVm-induced phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide docking sites for signaling molecules which, in turn, activate intracellular cascades such as PI3K/Akt and STAT3 pathways. Our results show that the pre-incubation with specific RTKs inhibitors (SU11274 and AG1478), as well as PTX, prevents Akt phosphorylation and STAT3 dimerization and its nuclear translocation. These results strongly suggest that stimulation of FPRL1 with its ligand induces the transactivation of several RTKs and that FPRL1-associated ROS generation is involved in this process, probably by inhibiting a cellular phosphatase activity. We also observed that the intracellular signaling cascades triggered by trans-phosphorylation of RTKs are involved in cell growth and survival. Introduction: Intracellular accumulation of fatty acid metabolites in non-adipose tissues has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Moreover, lipotoxicity may contribute to cell death and cardiac dysfunction. Evidence is emerging that saturated fatty acids induce cell death through apoptosis and this effect is specific for palmitate and stearate. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been implicated in the protection against cardiovascular diseases, cardiac ischemic damage and myocardial dysfunction. In the present study we showed that supplementation with the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), to culture medium of H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts protects cell against palmitate-induced apoptosis. Methods: Experiments were performed by using H9c2 rat ventricular cardiomyoblasts. Apoptosis was detected by trypan blue exclusion, MTT or caspase activity assays. Gene expression was investigated by Real Time PCR. Signal transduction pathways were investigated by Western blotting. Results: Our results indicate that palmitate induces apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. In particular at 500 lM dose it increased caspase activity by about fourfold after 24 hours of treatment. The incubation with 60 lM EPA inhibited palmitateinduced apoptosis of H9c2. Preliminary results indicate that the anti-apoptotic effect of EPA could be mediated by the modulation of the transcriptional peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c coactivator-1a considered a master regulator of myocardial energy metabolism in diverse pathophysiological conditions, and may involve the rapamycin-insensitive companion of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Rictor) a key member of mTOR complex-2 that promotes cellular survival. P21.10 MAPK phosphatase-1 contributes to trichostatin A inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have emerged as a new class of antitumor agents because they were demonstrated to induce cell cycle arrest, promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit metastasis. Recently, HDAC inhibitors were also shown to exhibit pronounced anti-inflammatory properties. However, the underlying mechanism contributing to the suppression of inflammatory responses by HDAC inhibitors remains to be fully defined. In the present study, we explored the actions of trichostatin A (TSA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). The LPS-induced cox-2 messenger RNA expression and COX-2 protein elevation were markedly suppressed by TSA. In addition, TSA also inhibited JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in cells exposed to LPS. Treatment of cells with a JNK signaling inhibitor (SP600125) or a p38 MAPK inhibitor (p38 MAPK inhibitor III) markedly inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 expression. TSA suppression of JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and subsequent COX-2 expression could be restored by selective inhibition of MKP-1 using a MKP-1 small interfering RNA strategy. TSA may cause MKP-1 activation to dephosphorylate JNK and p38 MAPK, leading to the downregulation of COX-2 in HUVECs stimulated by the proinflammatory stimulus, LPS.",

Treatment of A549 cells with thrombin increases Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/240 and Tyr317 in a time-dependent manner. Pre-treatment of A549 cells with dominant negative mutant of c-Src (c-SrcDN) inhibited thrombin-induced Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/240 but not at Tyr317. Pre-treatment of A549 cells with GW5074 (a Raf-1 inhibitor) and PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) inhibited thrombininduced IL-8/CXCL8 release. Moreover, thrombin-induced IjB kinase a/b (IKKa/b) phosphorylation and NF-jB-luciferase activity were inhibited by GW5074 and PD98059. Stimulation of cells with thrombin resulted increases in Raf-1 and ERK phosphorylation; these effects were inhibited by c-SrcDN. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gbc, c-Src, and Shc complex formation in time-dependent manner. Taken together, these results imply that thrombin activates the shc/Raf-1/ERK signal pathway through formation of Gbc, c-Src, and Shc complex to induce IKKa/b phosphorylation and NF-jB activation, which in turn induces IL-8/CXCL8 release in human epithelial cells. Decidualization is a biological and morphological process occurring in human endometrial stromal (hES) cells. This differentiation process is coordinated with induction of muscle-specific gene products such as IGFBP-1 and prolactin (PRL) concomitantly. We previously reported that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) regulates expression of IGFBP-1 and PRL in cAMP-induced decidualization of hES cells. In the present study, we focused on how PLD1 regulates expression of IGFBP1 and PRL. Phosphatidic acid (PA), end product of PLD1 further degraded to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and arachidonic acid (AA) by the action of PLA2. When we treated these PA metabolites, we found that LPA and AA increased expression of IGFBP1 and PRL independently. AA increased expression of IGFBP1 but not PRL. Contrary, LPA increased expression of PRL but not IGFBP1. LPA also upregulates COX-2 expression but inhibition of COX-2 by NS398 has no effect on PRL expression, suggesting that COX-2 pathway was not involved in LPA-induced PRL expression. In conclusion, IGFBP1 and PRL as decidual genes are induced by AA and LPA, respectively, which were different metabolites of PA increased by PLD1 during decidualization.",

Overexpression of PLD1 increased bFGF -induced NT-3 expression, and DN-PLD1 or PLD1 siRNA abolished bFGF-induced NT-3 expression and neurite outgrowth. Treatment with bFGF activated the RhoA/ Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)/ c-jun N terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. bFGF-induced NT-3 expression was blocked by a dominant negative RhoA as well as a specific ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), and an inhibitor of SAPK/JNK (SP600125). Furthermore, bFGF-induced JNK activation was also blocked by Y27632. These results indicate that RhoA/ ROCK/JNK pathway acts as upstream signaling in bFGFinduced NT-3 expression. Also PA, the product of PLD, increased NT-3 expression. We found that PLD regulates the RhoA/ROCK/JNK pathway, which then led to Elk-1 transactivation. When Elk-1 activity was blocked by Elk-1 siRNA, bFGF-induced NT-3 expression and neurite outgrowth were decreased. Also we found that overexpression of NT-3 resulted in increased Neurite outgrowing. Taken together, these results suggest that, PLD1 is an important regulator in bFGF-induced NT-3 expression and neurite outgrowth which are mediated by RhoA/ROCK/JNK pathway through activation of Elk-1 in H19-7 cells.",

These results are associated with the modulations of key regulator genes including p21cip/Waf1, Bax, and survivin.

HMGB1 can also enhance the efficiency of different stimuli, independently of these receptors. HMGB1 administered to erythroleukaemia cells, in the presence of hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA), or to epidermoid carcinoma cells, in the presence of epidermal growth factor, increases Ca 2+ influx and the consequent erythroid differentiation or cell motility program, respectively. However, the mediator of this HMGB1 effect has not been yet identified. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a glutamate-gated ion channel that mediate Ca 2+ influx and plays pivotal role in synaptic function in physiological and pathological conditions. Interestingly, NMDAR also operates in non-neuronal cells. Moreover, altered Ca 2+ homeostasis affects cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, secretion, and contributes to the onset and worsening of human pathologies. Here we have explored the possibility that HMGB1 could modulate NMDAR. We show that HMGB1 activates the NMDAR in neuroblastoma cells exposed to sub-stimulating amounts of NMDA. Aim of this study was to explore molecular and functional aspects of this signalling. The HMGB1/NMDAR interaction and the following activation of a calcium-dependent enzyme cascade involved a peptide of HMGB1 not overlapping the sequences that recognize RAGE or TLR 4. The HMGB1-induced cell responses resulted in calpain activation and increase of active neuronal NO synthase, leading to enhanced cell motility and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, we also identify NMDAR as the functional mediator of HMGB1 stimulation of murine erythroleukaemia cell differentiation, induced by HMBA. Since several cells express functional NMDARs, HMGB1 could modulate NMDAR-mediated cell responses inside and outside the CNS. Mitochondria constantly respond to changes in substrate availability and energy utilization to maintain optimal ATP supply; reversible phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins has been proposed to play a fundamental role in metabolic homeostasis, but little is known about the signaling pathways involved. cAMP is known to affect several different functions in distinct subcellular compartments, but its possible role in mitochondrial functions is poorly understood. Increasing evidence assigns important functions to the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway on the cytosolic surface of mitochondria, whereas a potential role for cAMP in the mitochondrial matrix has until recently been largely neglected. Only recently evidence has been obtained on the existence of a soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC)-cAMP-PKA signaling cascade wholly contained within mitochondria, which would serve as a metabolic sensor modulating ATP generation and ROS production in response to nutrient availability and cell demands. To directly investigate the cAMP dynamics within living mitochondria, we targeted genetically engineered cAMP sensors to the mitochondrial matrix. In conjunction with the overexpression of mitochondrially targeted molecules involved in cAMP signalling we have also monitored ATP levels using transfected luciferase targeted to the mitochondrial matrix.",

In addition, preliminary evidence points to a correlation between mitochondrial ATP concentration and sAC expression level and activity, suggesting a possible role for sAC in the basal regulation of ATP production. The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, and androgen-deprivation therapy is standard treatment for metastatic disease. The mechanisms responsible for the progression to the androgen-independent are not clear, but a high level of AR expression and resumed expression of androgen-regulated genes indicate that AR transcriptional activity is reactivated. The regulation of AR function involves cross-talk with other signaling pathways (PI3K/Akt), transcription factors and coregulatory proteins, e.g. beta-catenin, which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. It is proposed that PI3K/Akt plays a role in regulating AR activity through phosphorylation of AR at Ser(P)-213/210, but we have observed that in differentiated post-surgical prostate tissues, only a small percentage of cells are positive for AR Ser(P)-213, which suggests that this phosphorylation depends on cellular concentration of androgens and cancer stage. Akt phosphorylates beta-catenin at Ser(P)-552/675, induces beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and increases its transcriptional activity. The frequency of the loss of PTEN expression, which is a negative regulator of PI3K-Akt pathway, is correlated with a high Gleason score and advanced tumor stage. A high expression of PTEN and a lower expression of AR was observed in normal and low Gleason score tissues. Inhibition of Akt signaling by siRNA resulted in downregulation of AR Ser(P)-213, c-Myc and upregulation of cyclin G2, i.e. molecules regulated by PTEN. Silencing of both AR and Akt genes restored their less aggressive phenotype. We postulate that PTEN-dependent gene expression is mediated by both Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which reg-ulate AR transcriptional activity in various stage of prostate cancer.

AG, but not UnAG, stimulates growth hormone release and positive energy balance through binding to the receptor GHSR-1a. However, AG and UnAG share several biological activities, including PI3K/Akt-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in several cell types and induction of skeletal myoblasts differentiation through activation of p38. Here we show that both AG and UnAG impair skeletal muscle atrophy in vitro induced by treating C2C12 myotubes with dexamethasone (DEXA), a glucocorticoid eliciting muscle atrophy features, such as reduction of myotube diameter and induction of atrogenes. Skeletal muscle atrophy and atrogenes expression can be opposed by activation of the protein kinase mTOR, which, by forming two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, triggers distinct pathways leading, respectively, to increased protein synthesis and to inhibition of protein degradation. Both AG and UnAG inhibit DEXA-induced atrophy of myotubes through stimulation of p38 and mTORC2 pathway, without activating mTORC1 pathway and protein synthesis. Anti-atrophic signaling induced by AG and UnAG differs from signaling induced by IGF-1, a wellknown anti-atrophic factor. Indeed, IGF-1 anti-atrophic activity depend both on mTORC2-mediated inhibition of protein degradation and mTORC1-mediated stimulation of protein synthesis, thereby leading to muscle hypertrophy. Conversely, AG and UnAG do not stimulate protein synthesis: both peptides fail to induce phosphorylation of S6, to stimulate protein synthesis, and thus to increase myotubes diameter. In summary these data, along with in vivo data (see abstract from Reano S. et al.), provide the first evidence that AG and UnAG activate an anti-atrophic signaling in the skeletal muscle and that muscle atrophy can be counteracted even in absence of stimulation of protein synthesis and hypertrophy.",

Ovariectomy increased the production of superoxide anion, did not modify the NO release nor Ach-and SNP-induced relaxation. Indomethacin decreased the Ach-induced response only in arteries from ovariectomized rats; ODQ decreased the Ach-induced response in aortas from both groups of rats; L-NAME decreased the Ach-induced response more in arteries from intact than in those from ovariectomized rats. Pre-contraction with KCl decreased the Ach-and SNP-induced responses more in arteries from ovariectomized rats than in those of intact rats. Glybenclamide did not modify the SNP-induced relaxation, while charybdotoxin decreased that response more in arteries from ovariectomized rats than in those of intact rats. These results show that ovariectomy induces the production of relaxant factors other than NO and a greater participation of hyperpolarizing mechanisms in which the activation of KCa is involved, which allow the maintenance of the vasodilator response.

Diacylglycerol kinases (Dgks) are a family of enzymes, which phosphorylate diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), thus turning off and on DAG-mediated and PA-mediated signalling pathways, respectively. Dgk-a activity is stimulated by growth factors and oncogenes and is required for chemotactic, proliferative, and angiogenic signalling in vitro. In here, using either specific siRNAs or the pharmacological inhibitor R59949, we demonstrate that Dgk-a activity is required for 17-b-estradiol (E2)-induced proliferation, motility and anchorage independent growth of Hec-1A endometrial cancer cell line. Impairment of Dgk-a activity also influences basal cell proliferation and growth in soft agar of Hec-1A, while it has no effects on basal cell motility. Moreover, we show that Dgk-a activity is also induced by G1, the specific agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 (GPER) and that specific inhibition of GPR30 by siRNA impairs E2 biological activities on Hec-1A. Thus these data indicate that in endometrial cancer cells, activation of Dgk-a mediates cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and motility induced by estrogen through stimulation of GPR30 receptor. FccR are important IgG-binding immune receptors. While most FccR elicit activating responses, one receptor, FccRIIB (IIB), is inhibitory. The significance of IIB is emphasized by the finding that the disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is linked to polymorphisms of this allele. One mutation causes signalling defects that are attributed to lipid raft exclusion. Using superresolution microscopy we sought to characterize the behaviour of wildtype (wt) and mutant (mut) RIIB to establish the mechanism whereby raft exclusion occurs. RIIB was expressed in Cos7 cells as an N-terminal HA fusion protein that could be detected by immunofluorescence. Single-particle tracking was performed to analyze the diffusion of RIIB-HA in the plane of the plasmalemma under various conditions. This analysis indicated that the mobility of wt and mut RIIB were identical. We next performed spatial apposition analyses at the single-molecule level to analyze the frequency with which RIIB co-localize with GM1 gangliosides, a marker of lipid rafts. Using Monte Carlo simulations to establish the frequency of random co-localization, it was determined that under basal or cross-linking conditions RIIB and cholera toxin B (CtxB)-labelled GM1 do not co-localize. To evaluate if differences in RIIB recruitment are only apparent when stimulatory FccR are present and activated, we co-expressed in Cos7 FccRIIA-YFP with wt and mut RIIB-CFP, and monitored their recruitment to phagocytic cups. Importantly, RIIA is enriched over RIIB, consistent with published data. Again differences between wt and mut RIIB-CFP recruitment were not evident. We concluded that the inhibitory signalling defects of the lupus-associated RIIB mutant are not caused by perturbation of receptor diffusion in the plane of the membrane, impaired association with rafts or abnormal recruitment to the phagocytic cup.",

Penengo Department of DiSCAFF, University of Piemonte Orientale 'A. Avogadro', Novara, Italy DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious among the many types of DNA lesions. Thus, to protect genomic integrity, cells mount a complex signalling based response that coordinates cellular reactions to DNA insults termed the DNA damage response (DDR) in which, at the apex, sensor proteins detect damaged DNA and recruit PIKKs (phosphatidilinositol-3kinase-like kinases) to DSBs. It was recently highlighted by different labs, including ours, the importance of the non-degradative function of ubiquitination by the discovery of two E3 Ub ligases essential for the amplification of the signalling pathway activated by DSBs, RNF8 and RNF168. We showed that RNF168 contains a RING finger domain and two ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) called MIU (motif interacting with Ub); in addition, we recently identified and characterized a novel UBD in RNF168, called UMI (UIM-and MIU-related UBD). Inactivation of the three UBD impairs the recruitment and the proper localization of RNF168 to the site of DNA lesions, and the RNF168-dependent ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX. This prevents the recruitment of 53BP1 to DDR foci, which is a critical step for the G2/M checkpoint and DNA repair. Considerably, we found that depletion of endogenous RNF168 renders the cells more sensitive to genotoxic agents, such as etoposide. Despite the importance of RNF168 in the maintenance of genome stability and in the onset of human disease, little is known about the regulation of its signalling pathway, the substrates of its Ub ligase activity (except for histones) and its interacting partners. Here, we showed preliminary data, obtained by mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis, revealing a number of proteins that form a complex with RNF168. Among them, we found different players of the DDR that belong not only to homologous recombination (HR) but also to the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, suggesting a prospective new role of RNF168 in different DNA repair pathways. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor frequently over-activated in a variety of tumours, providing prolonged signals for cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Its ligands induce dimerization, phosphorylation and stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Ligand binding is followed by internalization of the receptor, which can lead to its attenuation by lysosomal degradation, recycling to the cell surface or to a nuclear import. To elucidate the different internalization and signal transduction pathways of EGFR, we focused our attention on ERp57, which is a member of the disulfide isomerase family, mainly located in the ER. The protein has also been found in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell surface [1] . Regarding this latter location, ERp57 appears to be involved in the cellular response to calcitriol [2] and to interact with angiotensin [3] receptors, as well as with STAT3 [4] . The experiments were carried out on the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468, which is highly enriched in EGFR and displays ERp57 on its cell surface. The internalization of EGFR after EGF administration, which is accompanied by the internalization of ERp57, was drastically decreased when ERp57 was silenced by RNAi, indicating that ERp57 is a required cofactor for the process. The silencing of ERp57 determined a strong decrease in the amount of phosphorylated EGFR at the level of two tyrosine residues, important for the proper signal transduction. Moreover, the knockdown of ERp57 brought up a strong decrease of the receptor in the nucleus, causing a decreased expression of three EGF-dependent genes. Studies to establish the requirement of ERp57 for the recycling or the degradation of the receptor are now ongoing, as well as the detection of a possible direct interaction between the two proteins. Recently we have demonstrated that ABA stimulates several proinflammatory activities (phagocytosis, ROS and NO production and chemotaxis) of human granulocytes by a LANCL2-mediated signaling pathway involving cAMP, cADPR and enhanced [Ca2+]i. Twenty-two analogs of ABA, natural or synthesized in our laboratory, were tested for ABA antagonistic effects on human granulocytes. Cells were incubated in the presence of ABA and of the various analogs and the concentration of cAMP was measured. A synthetic compound (#10) capable of abrogating ABA-induced cAMP production was identified. Competition binding experiments showed that #10 has an IC50 of 0.87 nM and a Ki of 0.46 nM. Furthermore, at concentrations ranging between 1 nM and 1 lM, #10 significantly inhibited the ABAinduced functional activation of granulocytes. #10 (1 lM) also abrogated monocyte production of PGE2 and MCP-1 induced by ABA. Stability of #10 in phosphate buffer and in human plasma was verified by HPLC-MS and exceeded 90% after 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. Finally, #10 was not cytotoxic on several human and murine cell types. Recently, we have selected by SE-LEX method (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment), sequences of ssDNA (aptamers) of 76 nucleotides from a library of random sequences, capable of selectively binding ABA. Out of 22 clones selected, three ABA-binding sequences were identified by ELONA (enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay). The KD of these aptamers is approximately 1.5 lM and they are able to discriminate between the different ABA isomers and enantiomers.",

Outside-in signaling through integrin a2b1 involves the stimulation of PLCc2, which is required for platelet spreading, and initiates an intracellular pathway leading to inside-out activation of integrin aIIbb3 through the small GTPase Rap1b. The focal adhesion kinase Pyk2 is a Src-and Ca2+-dependent kinase, whose implication in platelet integrin signaling has not been investigated. In this study we report that platelet adhesion to monomeric collagen or GFOGER peptide through integrin a2b1 caused the time-dependent activation of Pyk2, as revealed by its autophosphorylation on Tyr402. This process was only minimally dependent on secreted ADP or TxA2. Integrin a2b1-mediated activation of Pyk2 was only partially reduced by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2, but was completely suppressed upon intracellular Ca2+ chelation. Moreover, Pyk2 activation by integrin a2b1 failed to occur in PLCc2 KO mice. Platelets from Pyk2 KO mice adhered and spread normally over monomeric collagen, indicating that Pyk2 is not required for these processes. By contrast, Rap1b stimulation and inside-out activation of integrin aIIbb3 in collagen adherent platelets were significantly reduced in the absence of Pyk2. Interestingly, a reduction of integrin a2b1induced Rap1b activation and fibrinogen binding comparable to that observed in Pyk2-deficient platelets was also measured in adherent platelets from mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of PI3Kb (PI3KbKD). Moreover, while Pyk2 activation was normal in PI3KbKD platelets, Akt phosphorylation induced by integrin a2b1 engagement was strongly reduced in Pyk2 KO platelets, as well as in platelets lacking PLCc2. These results demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 links PLCc2 to PI3Kb downstream of integrin a2b1, and plays an important role in the cross-talk to integrin aIIbb3. Recent studies have shown that Ab also induces non-neuronal cells death. These non-neuronal cells include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and cerebral endothelial cells (CECs). CECs and astrocytes constitute blood-brain barrier (BBB) which prevents central nervous system (CNS) from deleterious insults. Therefore, Ab-induced CEC death may lead to BBB breakdown and cerebrovascular degeneration. Our previous study revealed that Ab may activate p38MAPK-mediated signaling to cause p53 phosphorylation and Bax expression leading to CEC death. However, the precise mechanism involved in Ab-induced cell death remains unclear. We demonstrated in the present study that compound C, an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, suppressed Ab-induced p38MAPK-p53 signaling cascade. Transfection of CECs with AMPK dominant-negative mutant (DN) also inhibited Ab-induced p53 phosphorylation. Moreover, Ab was shown to time-dependently cause AMPK phosphorylation in CECs. In addition to phosphorylation, modification of p53 by acetylation has also played a crucial role in p53 activation and subsequent events leading to cell death. We demonstrated for the first time that Ab induced p53 acetylation in a time-dependently manner in CECs. Taken together, these results suggest that Ab may activate the AMPK-p38MAPK-p53-Bax signaling to cause CEC death. Furthermore, modification of p53 by phosphorylation and acetylation may be attributed to Ab induced CEC death.",

Furthermore, PEBP specifically binds to phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine, but the functional role of lipid binding activity of PEBP in cellular processes is unidentified. It has been also suggested that it facilitates trimeric G-protein signaling to control autophagy, a metabolic degradation process, through inhibition of the protein kinase GRK-2. However, the role of PEBP in the regulation of autophagy is largely undiscovered. In this work we examined how PEBP controls autophagy under starvation. The mTOR activity was highly elevated when PEBP was overexpressed in Hela cells: increase of phosphorylated mTOR, phosphorylated p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (Thr389), and Akt (Ser473). Conversely, shRNA-mediated down-regulation of PEBP in HeLa cells dramatically reduced mTOR activity, consequently leading to increase of lipidation of LC3 proteins (LC3-II), a major autophagy indicator, at the amino acid deprivation. Other autophagy-related proteins are significantly up-regulated in the absence of PEBP expression. In addition, PEBP specifically interacts with LC3 and ATG5 in cells. These findings suggest that PEBP regulates the autophagic process through the activation of mTOR pathway and modulation of autophagy proteins under starvation. Tubulin acetylation is enigmatic and insufficiently examined tubulin modification and little is known about the signal pathway(s) that lead to its occurrence. It has been postulated that tubulin acetylation is higher in slow dividing cells or non-renewing tissues, and lower in rapid growing cultures. We speculated that activation of b1 integrin affects tubulin posttranslational modifications. In order to test our hypothesis we used GD25 cells expressing b1 integrin (GD25b1), b1 integrin depleted strain and cells expressing mutant integrin with suppressed activation (W775A) that can be experimentally restored. We also took advantage of recently developed and characterized three-dimensional (3D) in vivo-like model based on same cell line that is able to escape contact inhibition and therefore it allowed us to test our hypothesis in 3D, tissue-like environment. We established that acetylated tubulin is approximately 30% higher in GD25 monolayers that do express b1 integrin compared to KO cells. Reactivation of W775A mutant b1 integrin also resulted in about 50% increase in tubulin acetylation. Inter-estingly the other tubulin modifications like polyglutamination and tyrosination remain unaffected confirming the possible link between b1 integrin activation and tubulin acetylation.",

These results indicate that tubulin acetylation is (at least partially) under the control of b1 integrin and this is valid for 3D, tissue-like environment also. We studied the possible role of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) in neuronal differentiation including neurite formation of neural precursor cells (NPCs). Expression level of PLD1 increased during neuronal differentiation in NPCs. Bcl-2, which was defined to have a critical role in neurite outgrowing in H19-7 cells from our previous data, also showed increased expression level during neuronal differentiation. To investigate whether PLD1 is involved in neuronal differentiation of rat NPCs, the cells were infected with DN-PLD1. Downregulation of PLD1 using DN-PLD1 showed inhibited neurite outgrowth and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. PLD activity was dramatically reduced by PLCc inhibitor (U73122), Ca2+ chelator (Bapta-am), PKC inhibitor (Ro320432). These results indicate that PLCc, Ca2+ and PKC act as upstream activators of PLD in NPCs. Furthermore, treatment with arachidonic acid (AA) upregulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, CREB, and Bcl-2 expressions during differentiation condition, suggesting that AA is involved in the differentiation process generated by PLD1 activation in NPCs. We found that PGE2, which is a cyclooxygenase product of AA, was increased during neuronal differentiation of NPCs. Moreover, PGE2 stimulated G12/13 protein leading to activation of RhoAGTPase and ROCK. Inhibition of ROCK blocked phosphorylation of P38 MAPK as well as CREB. As expected, inhibition of P38 MAPK resulted in deactivation of CREB. When CREB activity was blocked with CREB siRNA, Bcl-2 expression was decreased.

In adult rat ventricular myocyte (ARVM), the limited contractile response to b2-AR stimulation is due to compartmentation of cAMP. The mechanisms responsible for confining the b2-AR signal include receptor-Gi coupling, phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, and location of b2 components in caveolar lipid raft domains of the sarcolemma. We have previously shown that contractile properties of ARVM are unaffected by selective activation of b2-AR with zinterol (ZNT), but significantly augmented in ARVM treated with the caveolae-disrupting agent methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MBCD). Here we explore the role of two main cardiac PDE isoforms (3 + 4), phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and PP (protein phosphatase) in the caveolar compartmentalisation of b2-AR signalling using phosphorylation of phospholamban (pPLB) and increased inotropy and lusitropy as indices of globalised b2 signalling. PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition caused a comparable increase in PKA-mediated pPLB at Ser16 in control (Con) and MBCD cells (n = 6, p > 0.05 between Con/MBCD). PDE3 inhibition enhanced ZNT-induced shortening and t0.5 relaxation in Con and MBCD cells; relative changes were comparable between groups (p > 0.05). PDE4 inhibition caused contractile dysfunction in MBCD cells that precluded assessment of functional effects. PI3K inhibition had no significant impact (p > 0.05) on pPLB but enhanced inotropic and lusitropic effects to ZNT (p < 0.05) in Con AVRM; identical effects were seen in MBCD-treated cells (p > 0.05). By contrast, enhanced pPLB, inotropic and lusitropic responses to PP inhibition in Con cells were reduced following treatment with MBCD (p < 0.05). We conclude that PP is partly dependent on caveolae for its cAMP compartmenting effect, but that PDE3, PDE4, and PI3K operate independently of caveolar organisation.",

A basal level of cAMP is required for growth, while a transient increase of cAMP induced by addition of glucose is required for transition from respiratory to fermentative metabolism. Although the cAMP/PKA pathway has been extensively studied in yeast and both upstream and downstream elements are known, data on the spatiotemporal variation of cAMP in single cells are till now lacking. We used a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) sensor to monitor the changes in cAMP level in single yeast cell. To avoid any interference with the cAMP/PKA signalling we used a sensor based on the mammalian protein EPAC, originally developed by Nikolaev et al. (J Biol Chem 2004; 279 : 37215) to monitor cAMP changes in mammalian cells. The sequence coding for the sensor (a fusion between Cyan-fluorescent protein-Epac1-yellow fluorescent protein) was cloned in a yeast expression vector and expressed in several yeast strains. We used a two-photon confocal microscope system to measure in a single cell the CFP and YFP fluorescence and the relative FRET efficiency was determined from the CFP/YFP fluorescence ratio. In a wild type strain the CFP/YFP ratio increases immediately after glucose addition to derepressed yeast cells, no changes were observed when glucose was added to strain that is not able to produce cAMP (cyr1-delta), while a sustained increase was observed in a strain bearing a deletion in the phosphodiesterase-1 gene (pde1). We are currently trying to reduce the ''noise'' related to the FRET evaluation and the stability of the setup in order to better relate the FRET efficiency parameter with the 'absolute' cAMP Cancer is a disease of the cell, therefore is essential the identification of evolution stages and use of this information in prediction, prevention, early diagnosis and development of new target drugs. The main obstacle against the success of therapy in many cancers seems to be the impossibility of eradication all tumor cells. Colon cancers represent some malignancies with high incidence throughout world, their etiology involving many genetic, immunological and biochemical factors. Naturally occurring antioxidant compounds such as quercetin (QCT), genistein (GST) or apigenin (APG) were recently used as cancer chemo-preventive and chemo-therapeutic agents. The present study focused on modulation of antigen expression of AMPK-alpha, -beta, LKB1, TSC2, mTOR and S6K1 associated to colon cancer cells by cytotoxic drugs (5-fluorouracyl) in the presence or absence of natural compounds such as quercetin or apigenin. Levels of expression of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated proteins were evaluated by immunoblotting in oral tumor cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas. Protein expression was detected by western blotting using the chemiluminescence. Our results showed a differential antigen expression of the molecules under study involved in signaling mechanisms involved in kinase activities depending on the association of stimuli and drugs. Protein expression alterations, resulting frequently from gene modifications, are responsible not only for the appearance of cancer, but also for the clinical responses of patients to chemotherapy. The knowledge of the relation between the implied molecules, of the mechanisms of regulation of the gene and protein expression, as well as their functions, of the effect of therapeutic agents (oncolytic agents, natural compounds) on proliferation, induction of apoptosis and tumor cell lysis has a potential diagnostic and prognostic value of the disease evolution, but also regarding the tumor response to immunotherapy.",

CNS microvasculature has a unique system of cell to cell communication among endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes which is known as the blood-brain barrier [1] . In malignant gliomas, a pathological increase in microvasculature is characterized by an active production of tumor proangiogenic molecules [2, 3] . In a triple co-culture system, we observed that C6 glioma cells significantly enhanced proliferation of primary bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) cultured in contact with pericytes. We evaluated endothelial cPLA2, PKCa, ERK1/2, expression/phosphorylation and iPLA2 protein/mRNA levels. 48 h after co-culture in the presence of C6 cells, cytosolic PLA2, ERK and PKCa phosphorylation was significantly stimulated, phenomenon which was attenuated by PKCa, ERK and PI3K specific inhibitors. By confocal microscopy, enhancement of fluorescence signal for endothelial phospho-cPLA2, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-PKCa and iPLA2 was observed. Incubation of our triple co-culture model with antibodies against VEGF or VEGF receptors 1/2 strongly reduced EC proliferation and phospho-cPLA2 and iPLA2 protein levels. The findings suggested that PLA2 activities, particularly iPLA2, were involved in stimulating EC proliferation, and were positively regulated upstream by PI3K, PKCa and ERK1/2 cascades. Our work provides new insights in understanding EC metabolism and signaling during tumor angiogenesis, which represent potential therapeutic targets to inhibit or enhance microvascular cell proliferation. Background and purpose: The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is regulated by its association with membrane microdomains like the lipid rafts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CB1 palmitoylation by analyzing the functional consequences of site-specific mutation of cysteine 415, the likely palmitoylated residue at the end of helix 8, in terms of membrane association, raft targeting and signalling of the receptor. Experimental approach: The palmitoylation state of the CB1 receptor was assessed in rat forebrain by depalmitoylation/repalmitoylation experiments. Cysteine 415 was replaced with alanine by site directed mutagenesis. Green fluorescence protein chimeras of both wild-type and mutant receptors were transiently expressed and functionally characterised in human neuronal cells by means of confocal microscopy, cytofluorimetry and competitive binding assays. Confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to assess receptor membrane dynamics, whereas cAMP and co-immunoprecipitation assays were employed to assess signalling activity. Results: Endogenous CB1 receptors were palmitoylated in rat brain. Mutation of cysteine 415 significantly reduced receptor recruitment at both the plasma membrane and the lipid rafts; it also increased protein diffusional mobility, whereas the immobile fraction remained unaltered. The same mutation markedly reduced the functional coupling of CB1 receptor with adenylyl cyclase, whereas depalmitoylation abrogated receptor association with G proteins. Conclusions: We found that CB1 receptor is post-translationally modified by palmitoylation and that mutation of cysteine 415 gives rise to a form of receptor that is functionally impaired in terms of membrane targeting and signalling. Ubiquitination is a widespread post-translational modification that regulates many cellular functions, including the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. It is a multi-step process involving the attachment of the ubiquitin moiety (Ub) to lysine residues on substrate proteins. Ub mediated network requires protein modules known as Ub binding domains (UBDs) to translate and amplify the Ub signal into specific cellular functions. UBDs play an important role by determining stability, localization, activity and interaction partners of proteins. Both the enzymatic activities and the docking capability of the ubiquitinating system represent an important level of regulation of DDR response allowing the recruitment to the site of lesion of a number of proteins that function as sensors, transducers and effectors of DNA damage signals. We have previously identified and characterized a new RING finger protein endowed with Ub ligase activity, namely RNF168, involved in DDR. RNF168 remodels the chromatin structure by ubiquitinating histones H2A and H2AX at the site of DNA double strand break. We found previously that RNF168 contains two UBDs named MIU (Motif Interacting with Ub). We further investigated the Ub binding ability of RNF168, and we found a novel surface of interaction with Ub at the N-terminus of the protein that we called UMI (UIM and MIU-related UBD). We examined the function of the three UBDs (UMI, MIU1 and MIU2) and we found that their integrity is largely required for the localization and function of RNF168. In fact, we demon- The novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKCeta, is a serine/ threonine kinase involved in a variety of cellular responses. However, its role in autophagy as an adaptive response to stress hasn't been established yet. We have previously shown that PKCeta is localized in the perinuclear region, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Thus, we aimed to investigate its effect on cell responses to ER stress, which includes the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the autophagy mechanism. The role of PKCeta, in autophagy induced by the ER stressor, thapsigargin (TG), was examined in MCF-7 breast cancer cells inducibly expressing PKCeta under the control of a tetracycline responsive promoter. LC3-II is served as a marker for autophagy, formed at the autophagosome membrane during the process. The level of LC3-II was reduced by the inducible expression of PKCeta in compared to control PKCeta-non-expressing? cells in response to TG treatment. Additionally, an increased level of LC3-II was also demonstrated in response to TG in shRNA PKCeta-knocked-down MCF-7 cells compared to control cells. Consistently, using transiently transfection of GFP-tagged-LC3 (GFP-LC3) plasmid we detected an increased formation of autophagic vesicles in shRNA PKCeta-knocked-down cells compared to scrambled-shRNA cells. PARP-1 as an apoptotic-marker was not affected by the expression of PKCeta, implying that PKCeta affects the autophagic but not the apoptotic response to TG treatment. However, the expression of PKCeta promotes autophagy induced by amino acid starvation or UV irradiation as depicted in PKCeta-inducible cells. Taken together, PKCeta expression affects autophagy in a stimuli-dependent pattern, probably through the different signaling pathways which are activated. As ER stress and autophagy are involved in several diseases, its role in these processes could be of therapeutic value.",

In contrast, GSH at concentration of 6 mM led to increase of cytosolic F-actin content and plasma membrane depolarization due to activation of volume regulating chloride channel ICln. Conclusion: Our results indicate that extracellular GSH affect platelet function by triggering cell actin cytoskeleton remodeling as well as changes in plasma membrane potential resulting in a specific modulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling. Background: Platelet activation with strong agonists is known to result in the formation of two subpopulations, one of which is highly procoagulant, because its cells express phosphatysilserine and bind coagulation factors.",

Methods: Gel-filtered platelets loaded with calcium-sensitive dyes were activated by various agonists, labeled with annexin V and antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Calcium Green and Fura Red dyes were compared, and only the latter was found to be suitable for studies of signaling in platelet subpopulations. Phosphatydilserine-positive activated platelets had high and stable intracellular calcium level independently of the activation type; addition of convulxin not only increased the number of these procoagulant platelets, but also increased and stabilized calcium concentration in phosphatydilserine-negative platelets as well. Use of protease-activated receptor SFLLRN instead of thrombin was able to induce calcium signaling and formation of platelet subpopulation in a similar manner, but the resulting platelets were not coated with alpha-granule proteins. Addition of the adenylatecyclase activator forskolin decreased the number of phosphatydilserine-positive platelets by 80%, while its inhibitor SQ22536 had an effect. This suggests that adenylatecyclase inactivation is necessary, but is not rate-limiting for the platelet subpopulation formation. Inhibition of both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (with U0126) and inwardly rectifying potassium channels (with SCH23390) had no effect on the formation of annexin Vpositive platelets, whereas addition of inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin) and Src tyrosine kinase (PP2) decreased the coated platelets subpopulation approximately three-fold Conclusions: We were able to identify principal signaling pathways leading to coated platelets formation.",

Although delta and mu opioid receptors are very similar and interact with the same G proteins, they show a sharp difference in the extent of constitutive activity. This is marked for the delta, but negligible for the mu receptor. Here we used a cell-free assay based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between luciferase-linked delta or mu receptors and fluorescentlytagged Gbeta1 subunits to detect and compare the formation of the transducer-receptor complex in the absence or presence of ligands. In this system the enhancement of BRET ratio is consistent with the intramolecular rearrangement of a pre-existing complex between receptor and heterotrimeric G protein, which results in tighter receptor-transducer association. Ligands with positive efficacy increase whereas ligands with negative efficacy decrease the molar fraction of transducer-receptor complex. GDP and Mg2+ exert, respectively, negative and positive allosteric effects on the receptor-transducer complex. We found that the G protein associated to empty receptor was much more sensitive to Mg2+ and GDP than the complex formed with receptor bound to either agonist or inverse agonist. This suggests that the mechanism of G protein activation by 'empty' receptors and by receptor occupied by ligands with either positive or negative efficacy are different. By comparing the maximal fraction of transducer-receptor complex induced by diverse ligand structures between mu and delta receptors, we identified two distinct groups of ligands. The first induced divergent levels, while the second produced a constant level of receptor-transducer complex in the two subtypes. The mechanism of G protein activation by the second group of ligands is identical to that underlying constitutive activity.",

Hydrogen peroxide has been long thought to be freely diffusible but recent evidence suggest that specific mammalian aquaporin homologues (AQP8) possess the capacity to channel H2O2 across membranes [2, 3] . Moreover, it has been recently shown that in human cells AQP3 expression can modulate the intracellular level of H2O2 and is required for NOX-derived H2O2 signalling [3] . Redox deregulation of proliferative pathways involving ROS (particularly H2O2) in cancer initiation and progression is now firmly established. Here we tested the hypothesis that specific isoforms of aquaporins regulate the level of intracellular H2O2 produced by NOX affecting downstream pathways linked to cell proliferation. In the present study, we show that in different leukemic cell lines NOX2 and/or NOX4 are expressed and are necessary to produce ROS that, in turn, are able to sustain glucose uptake and cell proliferation. Furthermore, we report that inhibition of aquaporins diminishes intracellular ROS accumulation either when H2O2 is produced by Nox enzymes or when is added exogenously to the medium. Finally, we observe a decrease in glucose transport following aquaporins inhibition. Taken together data suggest that aquaporins can regulate hydrogen peroxide uptake and downstream pathways mediated by H2O2. Psoriasis is a common chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, which is incurable nowadays. Aberrant interactions of immune system and skin cells play important role in development of the disease: DAMP molecules overexpression in skin and increased immune cells infiltration lead to the activation of autoamplification loop and further development of the inflammation.",

In this work, a statistical analysis of unstructured residues was made by considering 34 464 unique protein chains taken from the PDB database. In this database, 4.65% of residues are unstructured (i.e., invisible in X-ray structures). The statistics was obtained separately for the N-and C-termini as well as for the central part of the protein chain. Based on the collected statistics, it has been shown that frequencies of occurrence of unstructured residues of 20 types at the termini of protein chains differ from the ones in the middle part of the protein chain and a scale for prediction of unstructured regions was made. Our systematic analysis of disordered regions in PDB revealed 109 disordered patterns with different length and position in protein chain. All obtained patterns are statistically significant. Distribution of patterns in protein structures demonstrates that more often the disordered patterns occur in proteins with high identity or belong to proteins with low identity. Using the library of disordered patterns we can provide reliable predictions on the status of residues to be structured or unstructured inside the considered pattern. The question about specificity of these patterns is more important for biological function. We analyzed the occurrence of the obtained patterns in human proteome. A new method based on the dynamic programming has been developed for searching not only disordered regions but also individual unstructured residues in protein chain. This method correctly finds 75% of unstructured residues as well as 85% of structured residues in the protein data bank.",

In static calculations as (MM/MM+), while the NTs CBN(7, 0) and CBN (4, 4) can store 2H2 molecules, the same NTs can store only one H2 in molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K stable temperature.

However, current interactomes undercover protein interactions at a very low-resolution, that is to say, it is know what proteins interact but not how. Moreover, the number of structures of protein complexes only represents a very tiny fraction of the protein complexes that are predicted to exist in cells. As a result, current interactomes offer a blurry and granular picture of cell machinery, while the structural details of protein interactions are central in order to fully understand the function and dynamics of proteins inside the cell. Therefore, the very question that this project tackles is the missing structural component of large fraction of known genome-wide interactomes. This project presents the development a novel computational approach that integrates existing knowledge and computational tools to provide structural models for protein complexes. The method makes use of protein binding sites prediction to located in the protein interfaces that is then combine with protein docking to generate structural models of protein complex. This methodology has been applied to the human interactome characterizing over 13,000 protein complexes. Ultimately, this project will aim to a more realistic and informative representation of interactomes for a number of model organism.

            "text": "Genome-wide analysis of DNA repetitive elements in estrogen receptor binding sites There are several experimental evidences of the supramolecular organization of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in supercomplexes [1] [2] , but only few works deal with its functional implication. Indeed supercomplex organization provides a kinetic advantage through the direct channeling of electrons between the enzyme components and it can be postulated that the presence of supercomplexes may limit the formation of radical oxygen species (ROS) from the respiratory chain [3] . A methodological approach by metabolic flux control analysis used in our laboratory allowed to demonstrate that Complex I and Complex III act as one enzymatic unit in mammalian mitochondria [4] . Starting from these previous observations, our aim is to investigate the characteristics of supercomplex I+III and to evaluate the functional implications of its disassembling. For this purpose we analyzed the structure, the kinetic properties and the production of ROS after inducing supercomplex I+III dissociation in two experimental models: (i) in proteoliposomes enriched in Complex I and Complex III with different protein to lipid ratios, we observed that supercomplex I+III dissociation occurs in the presence of an excess of phospholipids or if lipid peroxidation is chemically induced; (ii) in mitochondrial membranes, the I+III super-assembly is loss after treatment with chaotropic agents. Kinetic analysis showed lower efficiency with loss of channelling; on the other hand preliminary results on ROS production showed changes in the amount and sensitivity to Complex I inhibitors. Cytochrome c oxidase exhibits cooperative, thermodynamic coupling between metal redox centers and protolytic groups in the apoprotein (redox Bohr effect) (Papa S. Biochim Biophys Acta 1976; 456: 39-84). Evidence has been obtained of membrane vectoriality of redox Bohr protons coupled to heme a/CuA and CuB electronic transitions. Upon reduction of these centers protons are taken up from the negative membrane side and are released at the positive side upon oxidation. Redox Bohr protons linked to heme a3 appear to be scalar, i.e., exchanged only at the outer positive membrane side. Different observations provide evidence for a crucial role of vectorial redox Bohr effect linked to the low spin heme a in the proton pumping activity of the enzyme. (Capitanio G., Martino, P. L., Capitanio N. and Papa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2011; doi: 10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.02.004). Effects of decoupling mutations on redox Bohr protons can provide further insight on the role of these redox-linked protolytic transitions. Exogenous zinc has been shown to inhibit the electron transfer activity of the enzyme and impair proton pumping by inhibiting proton uptake from the negative side and/or proton release to the positive membrane side. EXAFS and X-ray crystallographic analysis have identified residues of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase involved in the binding of exogenous zinc at the entry mouth of the D proton conducting pathway. This zinc binding site has been related to uncoupling of proton pumping in the P. denitrificans enzyme. In the mammalian enzyme, zinc binding on the negative membrane side results in a partial decoupling of the proton pump at level flow. Under these conditions, a depression of redox Bohr protons linked to heme a3 is also observed. It is proposed that this decoupling effect is associated with zincinduced conformational changes of an acid/base cluster linked to heme a3. Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase E.C 1.6.5.3) is the largest enzyme of mitochondrial respiratory chain of high eukaryotes made by at least 45 subunits. Seven subunits of mammalian complex I are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, the other 38 by nuclear genes. It has been found that post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acylation, oxidationreduction and proteolytic processing can regulate the activity of the complex. In this context, it has been shown that oxidative stress causes a decrease of complex I capacity accompanied by reduced ATP level. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the NDUFS4 subunit of complex I promotes its import into mitochondria and possible assemble in the complex by exchange with the old subunit in the complex. The cAMP cascade, via PKA, promotes the activity of complex I. Here we show that, in fibroblast cell cultures, the oxidative stress insult decreased the activity of the complex enhancing the carbonylation of its subunits. Activation of cAMP cascade by the b-agonist isoproterenol rescued the activity of the complex and reduced the carbonylation level of its subunits in particular of a band around 18 kDa, the molecular weight of the NDUFS4 subunit. The promoting effect of isoproterenol was prevented by the addition of CCCP or valinomycin, which collapse the membrane potential. All these effect correlated with the phosphorylation status of the NDUFS4 protein. In vitro mitochondrial import experiments showed that in isolated rat liver mitochondria, stressed by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, the assembly in the complex I of the new imported radiolabelled NDUFS4 was reduced. The assembly was recovered by addition in the mixture of PKA. In conclusion our results show that the cAMP cascade can rescue the complex I activity, lowered by oxidative stress, by promoting mitochondrial import of the NDUFS4 subunit and its assembly in the complex. Polyphenols are a huge class of food-derived metabolites reported to exert anti-tumor activities by triggering apoptosis in several tumor histotypes. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon remains still debated. Here, we demonstrate that kaempferol (KF), a member of the flavonols family, induces energetic failure in HeLa cells due to the inhibition of both glucose uptake and mitochondrial Complex I activity. As adaptive response, cells activate autophagy, which stands for an early and reversible process occurring as survival mechanism against apoptosis. Indeed, chemical or genetic inhibition of autophagy significantly shortens the times at which the apoptotic markers are detectable, and increases the extent of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. We also demonstrate that autophagy depends on the early activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR-mediated pathway. Actually, the over-expression of the dominant negative form of AMPK (AMPK/DN) result in a decrease of autophagic cells, a decrement of LC3-II levels and a significant increase of apoptosis. In the searching for the downstream mediators of KF-induced autophagy, we find that both the expression levels and nuclear localization of p53 increase. Moreover, results obtained upon pharmacological inhibition of p53, or p53 knock-down, recapitulate AMPK/DN conditions, suggesting that p53 is implicated in KF-induced autophagy as well. We then focused on the possible occurrence of a functional relationship between AMPK and p53. Western blot analyses of p53, performed upon chemical inhibition of AMPK with compound C, indicate that KF-induced p53 accumulation is significantly decreased. However, nuclear p53 is even maintained upon AMPK inhibition and increases during KF exposure, pointing out that other molecular factors are responsible for p53 nuclear accumulation, and, reasonably, that p53 could be also involved in the long-term response of cell death to KF-mediated energetic stress.

            "text": "Exponentially growing E. coli cells contain high amounts of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), a well-known cofactor, but only 20% is bound to apoenzymes. We showed that the abundant free ThDP is the precursor for two triphosphorylated derivatives, thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) and the newly discovered adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). Both compounds are produced under different conditions of stress. ThTP transiently accumulates in response to amino acid starvation, but, in contrast to AThTP, its synthesis requires the presence of a carbon source yielding pyruvate. Under such conditions, the amount of cellular ThTP may reach up to 20-60% of total thiamine, while it is generally a minor compound (0.1 to 1% of total thiamine). The biological role of ThTP remains uncertain until now, though in E. coli, it seems to be required for rapid adaptation to amino acid starvation [1] . ThTP accumulation requires inorganic phosphate and is inhibited by anoxia and cyanide. It is also blocked by low concentrations of the protonophore CCCP and is inhibited by low concentrations of DCCD, an inhibitor of FoF1-ATP synthase. These results suggest that ThTP is synthesized by a mechanism similar to oxidative phosphorylation, i.e., the reaction ThDP + Pi' ThTP catalyzed by FoF1-ATP synthase and energized by respiration. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that E. coli with FoF1-ATP synthase mutated in various subunits are unable to synthesize ThTP in minimal medium in response to glucose exposure. Moreover, a strain in which the atp operon was deleted is unable to synthesize ThTP, but transformation with a plasmid encoding the atp operon totally restores this capacity. We recently demonstrated a similar chemiosmotic mechanism for ThTP synthesis in rat brain mitochondria [2] suggesting a conserved mechanism for ThTP synthesis between bacteria and mammals. We investigated the acute effects of 3,5-L-diiodothyronine (T2) administration to hypothyroid rats on liver mitochondria and bioenergetic metabolism. 1h after i.p. injection, T2 noticeably increased both coupled (state 3), uncoupled (state 4) and FCCPstimulated respiration, while no change in the ADP/O ratio was observed. FoF1-ATP synthase activity, which was reduced in hypothyroid mitochondria, was significantly increased by T2 administration in both ATP-synthesis and hydrolysis direction. Real-Time qPCR and immunoblotting analysis showed no significant change in b-subunit mRNA accumulation and in protein content of a/b subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase, respectively, ruling out a T2 effect on transcriptional and / or translational mechanism. Among mitochondrial phospholipids, cardiolipin (CL) showed the greatest alteration. The content of CL in the mitochondrial inner membrane may change either as consequence of an alteration of the enzymatic steps involved in its biosynthetic process or as consequence of oxidative damage by ROS. Here, we show that in the mitochondria from hypothyroid rats, the decrease in CL amount was accompanied by a simultaneous increase (+23%) in peroxidised CL level. T2 administration raised (36%) CL level and decreased peroxidised CL amount, tending to restore CL euthyroid value. Minor T2-induced changes in mitochondrial fatty acid composition were detected. These findings provide evidence that the raise in the FoF1-ATP synthase activity observed in T2-treated hypothyroid rats may be ascribed, at least in part, to a T2-induced increase of mitochondrial CL level, occurring in parallel with a decreased content of CL oxidized form. Our results strengthen the suggestion [ . The formation of the CoAsy/RCD8 complex was shown to be induced by stimulation of cells with growth factors. We found that osmotic and oxidative stresses strongly reduce the interaction between CoAsy and RCD-8, while blocking of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone had no effect on the complex formation. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot alalysis revealed the localization of RCD-8 on mitochondria, but after stress treatment its relocalise to the cytoplasm. We propose that CoASy serves as a repository of RCD-8 on mitochondria and therefore might be involved in regulating mRNA life-span. We found that RCD-8 interacts with CoASy via the C-terminal domain, which is responsible for the localization of this protein to PB. Also we were interested whether the interaction with RCD-8 could affect the activity of CoASy. We have observed a strong inhibition of its activity by RCD-8. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RCD8 showed a concentration-dependent profile. No inhibition of CoASy activity was detected in the presence of RCD-8 mutant, lacking the C-terminal domain which mediates the interaction with CoASy. The inhibitory effect of RCD8 on CoASy was also observed on His-dPCoAK domain. We believe that better understanding of the CoASy/RCD-8 interaction and its functional consequences will shed light on the link between CoA biosynthesis and regulation of gene expression through mRNA degradation. The dicarboxylate carrier (Dic) is an important member of mitochondrial carrier family, which catalyzes an electroneutral exchange of dicarboxylates for inorganic phosphate or sulfurcontaining compounds. In yeast and mammals Dic is present as a single protein, while the screening of Flybase database allowed us to identify four Dic related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster (DmDicp). A phylogenetic analysis on these proteins revealed that DmDic1-4 proteins are monophyletic and form a group with all Dics. We investigated the DmDIC gene expression finding out that DmDIC1 is expressed in all D.melanogaster developmental stages, DmDIC2 is completely absent, whereas DmDIC3 and DmDIC4 expression is limited to the pupal stage. We then studied the biochemical properties of DmDic 1-3-4 proteins in a reconstituted system (proteoliposomes). Our findings demonstrate that DmDic1p is the D. melanogaster homolog of the human Dic and shows similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity of mammalian and yeast mitochondrial Dics. Interestingly, DmDic3p seems to be an atypical dicarboxylate carrier, being able to transport only phosphate, sulphate and tiosulphate. However, its exclusive presence in the pupal stage, its low affinity for phosphate and its low similarity with the known phosphate carriers led us to exclude that DmDic3p is the main D. melanogaster phosphate carrier. We did not observe any transport activity for DmDic4p, which may be explained by the lack of selective pressure upon its gene copy that could have been free to mutate and acquire a new function which remains to be determined. These outcomes have been supported by modelling and structural alignment analyses using as template the well-characterized bovine mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), which confirmed the apparently weird behaviour of DmDic3p respect to DmDic1p and gave us a potential explanation of the lack of dicarboxylate or phosphate transport activity of DmDic4p.",

Ovariectomy is a surgical procedure used to model the post-menopause condition. Ovariectomized animals have decreased metabolic rate measured by indirect calorimetry but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this work was to evaluate possible causes for the differences in metabolic rate and muscle function in ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats weighing approximately 200 g were divided into two groups: sham-operated and ovariectomized (ovx). The animals were sacrificed either 21 days or 13 days after surgery. At the 10th day of the 13-days protocol, the rats were divided into two groups: maintained at 22\u00b0C or exposed to 4\u00b0C during 3 days. In the 21-days protocol, body weight gain was significantly greater in ovx group compared to sham even though differences in food intake were not observed. The amount of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein important for BAT (brown adipose tissue) thermogenesis, did not differ between groups. The same result was observed for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SER-CA1a), an enzyme involved in both muscle relaxation and heat production. In the 13-days protocol, both groups were able to maintain body temperature when exposed to cold. The differences in body weight between sham and ovx persisted. In spite of the differences in body weight gain, oxygen consumption and heat released by mitochondria isolated from BAT were similar in sham and ovx maintained at 22\u00b0C. Cold exposure promoted a huge increase in these parameters in both groups. Taken together, these data suggest that increased body weight gain in ovariectomized rats cannot be explained by decreased BAT thermogenesis.",

It has been shown that ATRA cell-treatment modulates keratinocyte terminal differentiation and depresses their growth. These effects are associated with enhanced level of GRIM-19 and inhibition of the enzymatic activity of complex I [3] . The inhibition of complex I activity is reversed by dibutyryl-cAMP or okadaic acid. The effect of ATRA is apparently mediated by regulatory processes such as phosphorylation [4] . We have performed proteomic analysis in order to characterize the protein expression profile of total cell and mitochondria extracts of normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) in response to ATRA treatment. ATRA cell treatment resulted in differences in proteomic profile in both cellular and mitochondrial proteomic map of exponentially growing keratinocytes. Two proteins showing the same molecular weight (32.000 KDa) and different pI (4.2, 4.3) were significantly down expressed in both cell and mitochondrial proteins extract.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, uses L-proline in its bioenergetic metabolism. Besides, this amino acid is involved in osmorregulation, resistance to oxidative and nutritional stresses and also is involved in critical processes for the parasite life cycle, supporting the host cells invasion and differentiation. The proline-glutamate pathway in T. cruzi involves two enzymatic reactions, being the first one the oxidation of L-proline to D1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by the proline dehydrogenase (PRODH, E.C. 1.5.99.8) . In this work, the TcPRODH gene was cloned and the recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli. Our results showed that the recombinant TcPRODH is FAD dependent and has a Km = 16.58 \u00b1 1.69 lM and Vmax = 0.066 \u00b1 0.002 lmol/min/mg. The mRNA expression, protein quantity and specific activity profiles showed that this enzyme is up-regulated in the intracellular epimastigote, a stage requiring external supply of proline. We also demonstrated the mitochondrial localization of PRODH by digitonin extraction and immunofluorescence assay. When evaluated the relevance of PRODH on respiration, we observed that no significant differences were observed in mitochondrial vesicles or permeabilized parasites after stimulation with either succinate or proline. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanism of participation of PRODH in critical processes of T. cruzi life cycle, prompting this enzyme as a sensitive point to target drugs against the parasite.

A wide pharmacological application of Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) is determined by the main active substances: flavonoids (flavone glycosides, primarily composed of quercetin) and terpenoids (ginkolides and bilobalides). In this study we investigated the concentration-dependent GBE effects on isolated perfused rat heart functions (i.e. heart rate, coronary heart flow, contraction force), on mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence and possible protection of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We found that GBE, depending on concentration, decreased perfusion rate of isolated rat hearts, and diminished heart contraction rate at high concentration. GBE, similarly to classical uncouplers, produced the gradual decrease in mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence during perfusion of isolated hearts. This may cause the decrease in heart contraction force and changes of other parameters of heart work. Protective GBE effect on mitochondria functions against ischemia (45 minutes) -reperfusion (15 minutes) injury was concentration dependent. GBE at 5 ll/100 ml perfusion medium, added 20 min before no-flow global ischemia increased mitochondrial respiration rate in state 2 (by 28%), state 3 (by 100%), respiratory control index (by 57%) and induced attenuation of H2O2 generation (by 23%). However, GBE at concentration 40 ll/ 100 ml, had no effect on mitochondrial respiration rate in state 2 but decreased it in state 3 (by 38%). The data suggest that proper GBE concentration may protect mitochondria against ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

In demyelinating diseases of CNS and PNS, the myelin loss is always associated with an axonal necrosis, the major determinant of irreversible neurological disability. It was hypothesized that axonal degeneration could depend on an energy depletion consequently to a lack of trophic support by myelin [1] . Interestingly, a recruitment of mitochondria was observed in the demylinated sites. Recently, we have reported that myelin is a site of oxidative phosphorilation (OXPHOS), consuming oxygen to produce ATP [2, 3] . To understand the 'energetic role' of myelin in demyelinating diseases, the OXPHOS functionality was studied in myelin isolated from multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques at different activity degrees, and Charcot Marie Tooth 1a (CMT1a) sciatic nerves, comparing with healthy samples. Both an imaging and a bio-chemical approach were utilized. In myelin from MS plaques, the expression and activity of the OXPHOS proteins appeared lower with respect to the controls. Such decrease was directly proportional to the plaque activity degree. A similar result was obtained in myelin from CMT1a sciatic nerve, in which oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis decreased in comparison with the normal sciatic nerves. In conclusion, data demonstrated that the OXPHOS activity was compromised both in damaged myelin, as in MS plaques, and in uncorrectedly formed myelin, as in CMT1a, suggesting that, in demyelinating diseases, the energetic support by myelin to the axon, may be impaired. These results may give a new input to the understanding of the correlation between the myelin loss and the axonal degeneration, clarifying the neuro-trophic role of myelin. Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also known as mitochondrial porin, is a highly conserved large conductance anion channel that regulates the mitochondrial energy balance and the communication of the entire cell through the exchange of metabolites between the mitochondria and cytoplasm. VDAC is also involved in apoptosis through the control of its gating induced by different cytosolic proteins and mitochondrial lipids. In mammals three isoforms (VDAC1, 2 and 3) exist, but only VDAC1 and VDAC2 are well characterized. VDAC3 has been poorly studied and does not show an evident pore-forming ability in vitro. Moreover VDAC1 and 2 are able to complement the defective growth of a yeast strain lacking the endogenous Porin1, while VDAC3 does not. This complementation assay was useful to screen mutations of single amino acids and swapping of protein domains in order to obtain significant information about the structure/function relationship of human VDAC. The results obtained and their relevance is discussed.",

Measurement of complex I and complex IV activities, at postnatal days (PND) 3, 8, 15 and 21 showed an age-dependent increase in control new-born cerebellum. The ATRA treatment depressed the post-natal increase in complex I activity. The depression of the activity of complex I, was not associated with an altered expression of its subunits, neither with direct inhibitory effect of ATRA on the enzyme. Analysis of GSH and GSSG levels, glutathione peroxidase and SOD activities, showed that ATRA had no effect on oxygen free radical scavengers. The ATRA embryonic exposure resulted, however, in a marked increase in the level of carbonylated proteins in the mitochondrial fraction of new born's cerebellum, in particular of complex I subunits.

            "text": "Trypanosoma cruzi posses a delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase involved in the energetic metabolism In most of eukaryotes, P5C is a metabolic node between proline, ornithine and glutamate pathways, linking the Kreb\u00a2s and urea cycles through intermediates such as succinate. The proline-glutamate pathway in T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, is catalyzed by two oxidoreduction reactions: first, proline is oxidizes to P5C which in turn is irreversibly oxidized into glutamate by P5C dehydrogenase (Tcp5cdh). The TcP5CDH gene (1.7 Kb) was able to functionally complement a yeast knock-out for put2 gene (its orthologue). The gene product was functionally expressed in E. coli, the enzyme (Tcp5cdh-6xHis) purified, and a biochemical characterization was performed. The enzyme uses P5C and NAD+/NADP+ as substrates. The Km values were: 20.9 \u00b1 7.22; 704.7 \u00b1 21.97; 342.48 \u00b1 14.20 lM, and V max values: 13.61 \u00b1 1.8; 22.29 \u00b1 2.268 and 7.016 \u00b1 0.885 nmol/min for P5C, NAD+ and NADP+, respectively. The Tcp5cdh was specific for P5C when compared with other structurally-related aldehydes. Subcelullar localization assays showed that Tcp5cdh is located mainly inside the mitochondrion. The mRNA, protein and activity levels were evaluated in all life stages showing the higher quantities (3-fold) in the infective stages (metacyclic and trypomastigote). Furthermore, we observed that T. cruzi, under a metabolic stress condition, was capable of using P5C as fuel for energy obtainment and cell maintenance. It was also shown that P5C-based ATP production was abolished by antimycin A suggesting that this process is dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. Our data strongly supports, by the first time, the involvement of Tcp5cdh in the energy management and nutritional stress resistance. To counteract energy deprivation and ROS overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger compensatory changes in the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense of the cells which are defined as the mitochondrial stress response. This study was designed to investigate the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and antioxidant defense in human NARP (Neuropathy, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa) syndrome caused by 8993T fi G mutation in mtDNA-encoded subunit 6 of ATP synthase with 98% of heteroplasmy and Rho0 cells in the osteosarcoma 143B cells. The hypothesis that selenite can boost antioxidant defense and affect mitochondrial biogenesis was also tested. We found that increased ROS production in NARP cybrid cells was associated with increased level/activity of (glutathione peroxidase) GPx, cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), and methionine sulphoxide reductase A (MsrA). Although the level of PGC-1a, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was not changed in NARP and Rho0 cells, we observed the changes in the level/activity of nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) and showed the compensatory upregulation of respiratory chain subunits in NARP cells whereas their expression was low or undetectable in Rho0 cells. Additionally, we found that selenite lowered ROS level, boosted GPx activity, as well as affected the level of respiratory chain subunits. The hydrogen ion is the key intermediate energy carrier for the system of ATP synthesis. The enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation may function in two different states depending on conditions [1, 2] . The first one was offered by P. Mitchell [3] , the second one -by R. Williams [4] . According to the second model the transport of ''energized'' phosphorylation protons into the ATP synthase ought to be conducted in the metastable membrane bounded state within supercomplex. The phenomenon of formation of membrane bounded energized proton fraction (MF) [5, 6] was demonstrated in the model system under conditions of proton transport through BLM [5] . It should be noted that the effects of catalysis was also found. The membrane impermeable catalysts (citrate, HEPES, MES) are able to accelerate the reaction of proton dissociation from BLM surface to the bulk phase. The main goal of this work was the detection of metastable proton fraction on the mitoplasts' surface under conditions of respiration proton pumps functioning. The criterion of MF presence was the change of zeta-potential value after addition of catalyst (HEPES 20 mM), which selectively removes the 'energized' protons of MF. Zeta-potential of mitoplasts was measured in the system developed by Malvern Zetsizer. Medium contains PCP 1 lM, succinate 5 mM and rothenon 1 lM. We have found that the catalyst (HEPES 20 mM) changes the value of zeta-potential by 3-5 mV (n > 100, p(t) < 0.001). TTFA (inhibitor of SDH) abolished this effect. These data confirm formation of William's proton fraction on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Background: The mechanism of differentiation and dedifferentiation of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells has been extensively studied, but the influence of nutrients on the metabolism, differentiation (angio-versus adipo-) of SVF is still poorly understood. In our previous study we observed the inhibitory effect of EPA on lipid droplets formation during differentiation of SVF. The aim of the presented study was to evaluate energetic status of the differentiating SVF progenitor cells treated with selected fatty acids: PA, OA, EPA, AA. Methods: Isolated SVF cells were cultured in the adipocyte differentiation medium (MDI) for 48 hours, out which the last 24 hours included incubation with FFA. Cells were investigated after 15-day-long differentiation and than after following 15 days of dedifferentation induced by addition of FCS or VEGF or Larginine. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was analyzed by TMRM. Metabolic activity of mitochondria were assessed by ATP level and by high-resolution respirometry. A phosphorylation control protocol was used for evaluation of the physiological respiratory control state, the mitochondrial coupling state and uncoupled respiratory capacity. Results: Preincubation with some FFA increased ATP level, mitochondrial coupling state and uncoupled respiratory capacity. After 15 days of differentiation tendency to increase MMP, oxygen consumption and ATP generation by OA, PA and EPA was observed. After the next 15 days of dedifferentiation in presence of FCS, in cells preincubated with OA or AA an increased ATP generation was seen. EPA decreased oxygen consumption. Mitochondrial activity of SVF was reduced in presence of VEGF, whereas L-arginine increased mitochondrial respiration during dedifferentiation especially in the OA pre-treated cells . EPA and L-arginine induced changes in metabolic status of SVF cells, modify their differentiation into adipose tissue. We previously demonstrated that c-Fos has, in addition to its well known AP-1 transcription factor activity, the capacity to associate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activate key enzymes involved in phospholipid and glycolipid synthesis (Mol Biol Cell 2004, 4:1881; JBC 283: 31164; PLoS One 5(3):e9544, 2010). Only ER-associated c-Fos is capable of activating lipid synthesis. c-Fos/ER-association and consequently its lipid activation capacity is regulated by the phosphorylation state of c-Fos tyrosine residues (Oncogene 2007; 26:3551). Herein we determined that c-Fos physically associates to the enzymes that it activates; no interaction was observed between c-Fos and enzymes it does not activate. To examine possible physical associations, initially, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed between tagged enzymes and c-Fos. c-Fos activates and immunoprecipitates CDP-DAG synthase (CDS) and PtdIn 4K (PI4K) but not PtdIn Synthase (PIS). Direct physical association was confirmed by FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assays. Positive FRET was observed between c-Fos and CDS and c-Fos with PI4K but not with PIS. Furthermore, c-Fos deletion mutants evidenced that the N-terminal of c-Fos is required for its association to these enzymes whereas its basic domain (amino acids 139-159) is responsible for enzyme activation. c-Fos expression is tightly regulated by specific environmental cues. This strict regulation assures that lipid metabolism activation will occur as a response to cell requirements. Thus, c-Fos emerges as an important regulator of key membrane metabolisms in membrane-biogenesis demanding processes such as those involved both in normal growth and in the exacerbated growth characteristic of tumor cells.",

However, the mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs inhibit breast cancer cells growth, is not yet well understood. It was suggested that these fatty acids might change the fluidity and structure of cell membrane, especially of lipid rafts. We have studied the incorporation of PUFAs in cancer cell membrane and then in lipid rafts by HPLC/GC. We have observed that EPA and DHA are incorporated in cell membrane and in lipid rafts with different specificity for the phospholipids moiety. Worth of note is the observation that only the treatment with DHA induces a reduction of cholesterol content in lipid rafts, indicating a possible change in raft organization. Changes in the lipid rafts structure were also analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM) both before and after n-3 PUFA treatment. The AFM analysis of breast cancer lipid rafts indicates a reduction of microdomains number, after DHA incorporation. Moreover PUFA treated rafts are dimensionally different than control rafts. Taken together, our results indicate that n-3 PUFA 'feeding' might induce modifications of lipid rafts structure increasing the degree of fatty acid unsaturation, and these changes of lipid rafts might modify signal transduction and cell-cell interactions. The activity of membrane proteins is dependent on their orientation and on the presence of a membrane-mimicking environment in which the proteins can retain their tertiary structure. Tethered bilayer lipid membranes have been proven to be a powerful biomimetic platform to be used for this purpose. In this work, the properties of tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) constructed by different phospholipids (saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) were studied and the whole process was followed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Lipid composition is expected to affect bilayer properties like viscoelastic properties. This characteristic could be determined by the help of Quartz Crystal Microbalance-Dissipation (QCM-D). tBLMs were formed according to the procedure optimized in our group. Shortly, either SPR gold covered slides or QCM gold covered crystals were modified by dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DTSP; 1mM in DMSO), then DSPE-PEG(2000) (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino (polyethylene glycol)-2000]; 0.03 mg/ml in dH20) was attached on it to serve as tethers for the tBLMs. Finally, liposomes of different lipid composition (e.g. PC:PE / 90:10 / 75:25) were generated by the help of an extruder using 100 nm membranes and were spread onto the modified surface. Preliminary studies demonstrated that increasing PE concentration led liposomes to stably attach to the surface without forming bilayer, whereas bilayer formation was more favored in lower PE ratios. Additionally, the effect of liposome size on bilayer formation was examined and it was seen that decreasing the liposome size to 50 nm had negative effect on the stability of the formed layer.

This basic observation hangs onto the possibility of applying several powerful non-invasive physical techniques to assess the structure of complex biomembranes, threatening the interest in their non-invasiveness by the oversimplification of the experimental model. The use of asymmetric model systems is rare, due to the difficulty of realizing artificial membranes with well defined heterogeneous composition and applicable for non-average structural investigation. In collaboration with the ILL in Grenoble, we have developed and tested an experimental model bearing forced membrane asymmetry in the form of single floating bilayer, that we investigated by neutron and synchrotron radiation reflectivity. The two coupled different monolayers are prepared by Langmuir-Blodgettn and Langmuir-Schaefer technique. We have tested the asymmetric phospholipid, cholesterol, ganglioside model system. In fact, gangliosides in real membranes reside in the outer layer, which has been invoked to provide the structural basis for the third-dimension static deformation of membrane portions. Also cholesterol transverse disposition may assume specific arrangement in asymmetric domains. The Angstrom scale of neutron accessibility is able to reveal the cross profile of the membrane. We present some experimental results, revealing the experimental crucial points and the potentiality of the technique. We plan to directly access the structural effect brought by a soluble enzyme digesting the glycolipid component. We have analyzed the biochemical activity of many forms of CK2a proteins such as CK2a-wild type; CK2aD336 (C-terminally truncated form) and CK2a4E (phospho-mimic mutant), without disclosing any intrinsic regulatory function. The results instead suggest that the C-terminal segment of CK2 could act as bait for prey-proteins. Our walking hypothesis is that, when CK2 is phosphorylated at C-terminus some specific proteins could gain affinity for CK2. To disclose substrates recognized by phosphorylated CK2 we have separated by 2D gel electrophoresis a total cellular extract (SKNBE cells neuroblastoma) phosphorylated by either CK2awt or CK2a4E and we have analyzed the radiolabeled spots by mass spectrometry. Our preliminary data show the preferential phosphorylation of a number of endogenous substrates by CK2a phospho-mimic mutant. One for all is the histone demethylase LSD1. LSD1 is involved in the switch-off of transcription and chromatin condensation in G2/M phases, but its regulation is still unknown.",

In eukaryotic cells, the initiation of translation is a complex sequence of reactions requiring the interaction of the ribosome with a number of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). Among the eIF family, eIF3 is an essential multiprotein complex, composed of 13 different subunits, which is a key component in the recruitment and assembly of the translation initiation machinery. Phosphorylation has been shown to function as a general mechanism for the regulation of initiation and phosphoproteomic analyses demonstrated that, like other eIFs, also eIF3 is phosphorylated [1, 2] . The protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous, mitotically active and pleiotropic Ser/Thr kinase endowed with constitutive activity and frequently overexpressed in human cancer. CK2 has been shown to interact with and phosphorylate eIF2 and eIF5 [3] . By means of both western blot and mass spectrometry analyses we demonstrated that several eIF3 subunits are associated with CK2 in human cells and that the eIF3 subunit j is a new substrate of the protein kinase. Ser127 of eIF3j, which is located in the sequence QEESDLE matching the CK2 phosphorylation consensus motif, was identified as a phosphorylated site using immobilized metal affinity chromatography to enrich for phosphopeptides and tandem mass spectrometry. The subunit eIF3j associates with the decoding center of the 40 S ribosomal subunit and plays a crucial role in the binding of eIFs and mRNA, therefore the biological significance of eIF3j phosphorylation was analyzed by treating cells with CK2 specific inhibitors.

Kuznetsov 1 , M Loog 2 and J Ja\u00a8rv 1 1 University of Tartu, Institute of Chemistry, 2 University of Tartu, Institute of Technology Pyruvate kinase (PK, ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) catalyzes final step of glycolysis transferring phosphoryl group of phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP producing pyruvate and ATP. It is the key enzyme of glycolytic pathway and carbon metabolism in general. In mammals there are four PK isoenzymes -M1, M2, R and L. The activity of the L-type, found in liver, can be regulated by phosphorylation on serine 12 residues of small N-terminal domain: MEGPAGYLRR10AS12-VAQLTQEL20GTAFF. In our previous work it was shown that phosphorylation is a molecular switch between allosteric and non-allosteric form of L-type pyruvate kinase. Phosphorylation also reduces the affinity of enzyme to one of it substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In the present work we studied the effect of point mutation around phosphorylation site in positions 9, 10 and 13 on catalytic properties of L-PK. The question was whether redistribution and introduction of new ionic groups can mimic the effect of serine phosphorylation. It was found that in some cases the catalytic activity of the enzyme was affected. The affinity of enzyme to PEP binding was reduced and not changed toward the second substrate ADP, similarly to the effect of phosphorylation. But the allosteric properties of L-PK were not switched on by mutations. Some structural aspects of L-PK regulation were discussed by comparing the results of mutation analysis and computer modeling of docking of the regulatory domain fragments with the main body of the enzyme, and novel mechanism of allosteric regulation of L-PK activity was proposed. The computational docking analysis supported the idea that N-terminal domain can interact to protein main body. Proceeding from this idea we suggest kinetic mechanism of L-PK allosteric regulation.",

Elson Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a central role in regulation of cellular processes, among them bone structure and metabolism. We previously demonstrated that the non-receptor form of protein tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (PTPe), cyt-PTPe, is highly expressed in osteoclasts. Young female mice genetically lacking PTPe exhibit increased trabecular bone mass; their osteoclasts resorb bone less well in vitro and in vivo. These phenotypes are caused by reduced adhesion of PTPe-deficient osteoclast to bone, secondary to abnormal structure, stability and organization of podosomes, the adhesion structures of these cells. Most importantly, expressing cyt-PTPe in PTPe-deficient osteoclasts corrects the abnormal stability of podosomes in these cells. RPTPa is a very close structural relative of PTPe, and is also expressed at high levels in osteoclasts. However, our preliminary study of PTPa revealed no changes in bone matrix or osteoclast differentiation and their activity. Although the sequences of cyt-PTPe and RPTPa are very similar, Cyt-PTPe is predominantly cytosolic while RPTPa is an integral membrane protein. In order to determine if this difference prevented RPTPa from playing a significant role in osteoclasts we examined the ability of various forms of PTPe and PTPa to rescue the cellular phenotype of osteoclasts lacking PTPe, using podosomal organization as readout. We found that expression of cyt-PTPe or of an artificial cytosolic PTPa rescued the phenotype, while the receptor forms of PTPe (RPTPe) and PTPa (RPTPa) or of LCK-PTPe (a membraneassociated form of PTPe lacking an extracellular domain) cannot do so. We conclude that cytosolic localization of PTPe or PTPa catalytic activity is required to maintain proper organization and function of podosomes in osteoclasts. Background: Signaling from PI3K c is crucial for leukocyte recruitment and inflammation but also contributes to cardiac maladaptive remodeling. To better understand the translational potential of these findings, this study investigates the role of PI3Kc activity in pressure overload-induced heart failure, addressing the distinct contributions of bone marrow-derived and cardiac cells. Methods and Results: Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) triggers the activation of PI3Kc signaling in two ways: as a response to pressure overload stimulation in cardiac cells, and through the activation of inflammatory responses and leukocytes infiltration to the damaged myocardium, both processes thought to be detrimental for cardiac function. Accordingly, mice knockin for a catalytically inactive PI3Kc (PI3Kc KD) showed reduced fibrosis and normalized cardiac function up to 16 weeks. To define the cell types involved in this protection, bone marrow chimeras, lacking kinase activity either in immune system or in the heart, were studied after TAC. Bone marrow-derived cells from PI3Kc KD mice were not recruited to wild-type hearts, thus preventing fibrosis and preserving diastolic function. After prolonged pressure overload, chimeras with PI3Kc KD bone marrow-derived cells showed slower development of left ventricle dilation and higher fractional shortening than controls. Conversely, in the presence of a wild-type immune system, KD hearts displayed bone marrow-derived cell infiltration and fibrosis at early stages, but reduced left ventricle dilation and preserved contractile function at later time points. Conclusions: Altogether these data demonstrate that, in response to TAC, PI3Kc contributes to maladaptive remodeling at multiple levels by modulating both cardiac and immune cell functions. Murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), also named Melk, is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related serine/threonine kinase family and is a pivotal component of a variety of cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle, and signaling pathways. However, the regulatory mechanism of MPK38 activity is unknown at present. Here we report that thioredoxin (Trx) functions as a negative regulator of MPK38 through direct interaction with MPK38. This association was mediated by the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain of MPK38 and was decreased by treatment of ASK1 stimuli (H2O2, TNF-a, thapsigargin, and ionomycin) and TGF-b. The complex formation between MPK38 and Trx also caused to phosphorylate Trx at Thr76, indicating Trx as a substrate for MPK38. Analysis of the activity of MPK38 showed that Trx dose-dependently suppressed AP-1-and TGF-b-mediated transcription induced by MPK38. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Trx at Thr76 was required for the regulation of MPK38-mediated ASK1 and TGFb signaling. Together, our present results suggest Trx may be a negative regulator of MPK38.",

Elements in the 5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR), such as Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) and upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs), are known to regulate protein translation at the initiation phase. Not much is known on the translational regulation of Protein Kinase C (PKC), family of serine/threonine kinases that play a central role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Previous work carried out in our laboratory showed that the 5'UTR of the Protein Kinase Ceta (PKCg) isoform contains two conserved uORFs that repress the basal levels of PKCeta in growing cells, while enhancing its expression upon stress induced by amino acids starvation (Hadas Raveh-Amit et al.). To extend these studies we are currently studding the role of uORFs in other PKC isoforms. Our results indicate the presence of a single uORF in the rat 5'UTR of PKCgamma isoform. Here we show that the PKCgamma protein level rises upon H2O2 treatment or amino acid starvation. In order to assess if the increase in the PKCgamma is mediated through its 5'UTR, we cloned the 5'UTR and 3'UTR upstream and downstream of firefly luciferase reporter gene accordantly and mutated the uORF initiation and termination codons. The luciferase activity of the uORF initiation/termination mutation constructs was not changed in comparison to the WT construct. On the other hand, there was an increase in the luciferase activity in the WT and the mutants as well upon amino acid starvation. Moreover, we have revealed that the presence of the 5'UTR itself rises the PKCgamma translational efficiency dramatically, suggesting regulation by IRES. Further work is needed to examine the 5'UTR IRES potential. The molecular mechanism underlying spore germination remains one of the last unanswered questions in bacterial spore biology. Our previous studies revealed that protein phosphatase PrpE is a novel molecular player in nutrient-induced germination in B. subtilis spores. We demonstrated that PrpE is required for expression of genes coding for GerA and GerK spore germination receptors. As a consequence, germination of spores produced by the strain lacking PrpE (DprpE) is impaired. It seems plausible that the phosphatase is the first identified component of a novel phosphorylation-based signalling network controlling germination. However, apart from germination receptors, components of the network remained elusive. In an attempt to identify such proteins, strain deleted for prpE gene was subjected to in vivo random transposon mutagenesis. Screening of the resulting library enabled us to isolate a mutant displaying the germination phenotype similar to the phenotype of WT spores. With the use of an inverted PCR strategy, transposon insertion site was mapped to rocA gene. To confirm that the germination phenotype in the isolated germination-proficient mutant resulted from the transposon insertion, derivative of the DprpE strain with clean insertional inactivation of a rocA gene was constructed. Assays of kinetics of spore germination in conjunction with real-time monitoring of spore morphology during germination and outgrowth in the constructed strain were carried out. The results confirmed that inactivation of rocA gene in the DprpE background improves the DprpE spores' response to nutrients to an extent that allows them to outgrow and reach exponential growth in a similar period of time as WT spores.",

VRK1 is also known to phosphorylate nuclear membrane protein Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) which links chromatin to nuclear envelope during interphase. Therefore VRK1 should be strictly regulated during cell cycle. Here we suggest polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as a key regulator of VRK1 in mitotic progression. We found that PLK1 phosphorylates VRK1 in vitro. We also revealed that PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of VRK1 potentiated its catalytic activity.

It is known that the amount of essential oils extracted from Origanum differs between different environmental factors (geographic regions, climates, cuts etc.). Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of environmental (biotic and abiotic) stresses and they developed sophisticated signaling pathways to adapt to the changing environment. A common mechanism that is mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in plants is used to translate the external stimuli into cellular responses. The MAPK enzyme family is a signal transduction pathway composed of triple kinases modules namely MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK and play roles in production of cellular response to environmental factors in plants. In Aim: The aim of our study was to determine the response of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to DNA-damaging cytostatic cisplatin and compare the response of DPSCs with the response of normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). We focused on the proliferation, viability, protein expression and induction of apoptosis after exposure of DPSCs and HDFs to cisplatin. Methods: DPSCs were exposed to doses 5-40 lmol/l cisplatin. Proliferation of affected cells was detected by Z2 Counter and viability by Vi-Cell XR using Trypan blue exclusion staining. Cell cycle analysis and induction of apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis was also determined by moni-toring the activities of caspases. The expression of key proteins was detected by Western blotting. Results: We show that DPSCs are more sensitive to cisplatin than HDFs. All three main MAPK families -extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 were activated after treatment of DPSCs with cisplatin. Similar activation of MAP kinase pathways was not observed in HDFs exposed to cisplatin. In DPSCs as well as in HDFs, cisplatin provoked an increase in p53 and its phosphorylation of serine 15 as well as the expression of p21. Higher concentrations of cisplatin induced activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 and decreased the viability in DPSCs. Conclusion: DPSCs are more sensitive to cisplatin than HDFs. Cisplatin in higher concentrations triggers apoptosis and activates MAPK in DPSCs, but this is not observed in HDFs.

It is a large multidomain protein, containing a very conserved amino-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. CIT-K is expressed by all proliferating cells with a peak in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and is specifically localized to the cleavage furrow and to the midbody during cytokinesis. However, the functional studies so far conducted have shown that the sensitivity to CIT-K inactivation may considerably vary in different cell types. Indeed, in CIT-K knockout mice, cytokinesis failure occurs only in specific neuronal precursors and in the male germ cells. In addition, upon CIT-K RNAi, cytokinesis failure has been reported to occur also in cultured cell lines, such as HeLa cells. The mechanisms that determine the sensitivity of cytokinesis to CIT-K inactivation are still unknown. In this work, we have addressed the hypothesis that the function of CIT-K in cytokinesis might be related to microtubule dynamics. This possibility is suggested by the close spatial relationships between CIT-K and central spindle microtubules during cytokinesis and by the fact that CIT-K has been shown to interact with the kinesin KIF14. We have found that treatment of HeLa cells with drugs affecting microtubules polymerization strongly modifies their sensitivity to CIT-K inactivation. Moreover, we will show that CIT-K displays a specific physical and functional interaction with BetaIII-tubulin, a specific tubulin isoforms expressed at high levels in the tissues that display cytokinesis failure in CIT-K knockout mice. Altogether, our preliminary findings strongly suggest that CIT-K may promote cell division by stabilizing midbody microtubules during the latest stages of cytokinesis.",

Deregulation of mTOR-coordinated signalling has been associated with diabetes, inflammation and cancer. The molecule of mTOR is a 290kDa protein involved in mammalian cells in two major complexes: TORC1 and TORC2 in the association with different proteins. Recently, using RT-PCR analysis of various human cell lines our research group has identified the existence of potential mTOR splice variants. Among them, TOR-b isoform have been characterized as a potential oncogene. The aim of our current studies was to prove the existence of additional mTOR isoforms -TORc and TORe on RNA and protein levels in mammalian cells. The bioinformatical analysis of TORc and TORe primary structure allowed to determine the absence of several functional domains in their structure compared to a full-length TORa molecule. Both isoforms TOR-c and TOR-e were cloned in eukaryotic vector pcDNA3.1 and stable cell lines were obtained. Also, a fragment of C-terminal part of mTOR was cloned, overexpressed and purified from bacteria cells. This recombinant protein was used for rabbit immunization and TOR-specific polyclonal antibodies generation. The application of generated antibodies allow to detect the presence in some mammalian cell lines and tissues not only TORa (290kDa), but also several bands of proteins with lower molecular weight, similar to TORb, TORc and TORe isoforms. The investigation of phosphorylation status of up-stream and down-stream effectors of mTOR (Akt, S6K1, S6 protein) in stable cell lines overexpressing TORc and TORe had showed that there status was differed compere to wild type cells. Also, we detected that phosphorylation status of TORc, like TORa, is rapamycine sensitive, in contrast to TORe isoform.",

            "text": "Interaction between SH3 domain of Src family kinases and HTLV-1 p13's proline rich motif confers novel functional properties to the single components The complex regulation of Src Family Kinases (SFKs) rests upon several mechanisms occurring singly, sequentially or synergistically and including post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and oxidation, and protein-protein interactions, involving the different domains of SFKs. In particular, the association of the SH3 domain with protein partners bearing proline rich motifs has been implicated in the regulation of the activity, and recently described as a possible mechanism of relocalization to subcellular compartments, of SFKs. In this work, we demonstrate that p13, a HTLV-1 accessory protein containing a N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal (MLS), associates with the SH3 domain of SFKs through its Cterminal proline rich motif, forming a stable heterodimer that migrates into mitochondria. It is to be underlined that mitochondria only recently have been described as a location for SFKs [1] . In fact, although SFKs have commonly been thought to be located at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [2] [3] [4] , considerable evidence has been reported for a wider intracellular distribution of this family as well as for peculiar functions of SFKs associated with their distinct intracellular localizations [1, 5, 6] . The SFK/p13 interaction confers novel functional properties to the single components of the complex, the activity of several SFKs, being dramatically enhanced with subsequent increase in mitochondrial tyrosine phosphorylation and p13's ability to perturb the mitochondrial membrane potential being abolished. This association and the resulting effects here described lead us to hypothesize a general mechanism by which the transfer of SFKs to different cellular districts mediated by the SH3 domain and directed by the localization signals of interacting proteins may exert a more general action in the cell fate by modifying the phosphorylation state and hence the function of key substrates resident in the targeted cellular compartments.",

Coccetti Univeristy of Milano-Bicocca, Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, Milano, Italy CK2 is a highly conserved protein kinase, ubiquitously distributed among eukaryotic cells and involved in many cellular processes. It has recently emerged as an important anti-tumor target, since its up-regulated activity, observed in many tumors and cancer cell lines, is linked to the increased proliferation and survival of tumor cells. In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CK2 is composed of two catalytic subunits (a and a') and two regulatory subunits (b and b'), and can exist as a tetrameric a2b2 enzyme or as free catalytic subunits, which can phosphorylate different substrates. The presence of either a or a' subunit is essential for cell viability; on the contrary, regulatory subunits are known to be required only to respond to high salt concentrations and to DNA damage. Here we investigate the role of CK2 regulatory subunits in budding yeast. We show that both b and b' subunits are needed for the activity of CK2 holoenzyme, indicating that the bb' heterodimer is required to form the tetrameric CK2. Moreover we show that cells lacking b and b' subunits present a slower G1/S transition if compared with wild type cells, in keeping with a decreased and delayed expression of Clb5, the principal S phase cyclin. The reduction of Clb5 level is not due to decreased protein stability. The role of b and b' subunits in the regulation of transcription during G1 phase will be discussed, especially focusing on the transcription factor Swi6, which presents several putative CK2 consensus sites.",

The commonest mutation (accounting for 70% or more of all CF cases) is the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (DF508) in the nucleotide binding domain-1 (NBD1) of CFTR, which leads to premature degradation of the nascent protein with consequent alterations of diverse cellular functions. We recently showed that protein kinase CK2, which unlike the other protein kinases has no recognised factors controlling its activity, is susceptible to allosteric modulation in vitro by peptides reproducing the sequence encompassing the F508 deletion of CFTR. Consequently the targeting of several substrates by CK2 is deeply altered by these DF peptides [1, 2] . This prompted us to hypothesize that in DF508 CFTR expressing cells signalling by CK2 might be subverted, rendering CK2 a new target for therapies aimed at treating CF. Lysates of cell lines expressing either wild type or DF508 CFTR incubated with 32P-GTP in the presence or absence of selective CK2 inhibitors exhibit significant alterations in the phosphorylation of CK2 protein substrates. By MS analysis, a number of proteins whose phosphorylation by CK2 is altered in DF508 cells, have been identified and some of these have been recognized as implicated in the process of maturation, stabilization and degradation of CFTR. Treatment of cells with selective CK2 inhibitors affects the protein level of CFTR, both wild type and DF508, disclosing the possibility that modulation of CK2-dependent phosphorylation may represent a tool for the regulation of expression and maturation of CFTR, especially in a DF508 CFTR background.

Wang Inst. of Medical Sciences, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan Endothelial cells are constantly subjected to blood flow-induced shear stress. Laminar shear flow (LF), in contrast to disturbed flow, has been implicated as atheroprotective. Our previous studies demonstrated that laminar flow to bovine aortic endothelial cells attenuated the serum-and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation. The detailed suppression mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, ECs pretreated with an inhibitor to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), sodium orthovanadate, markedly attenuated the LF-induced STAT3 dephosphorylation indicating that PTP is involved in this suppressive effect by LF. SHP2, a SH2-containing PTP, is a major PTP in ECs revealed by in gel phosphatase assay. ECs transfected with either small interference RNA to SHP2 (siRNA) or catalytic inactive mutant of SHP2 (SHP2C/S) greatly ameliorated the IL-6-induced STAT3 activation suppressed by LF. ECs exposed to LF increased SHP2 association to STAT3. Furthermore, substrate-trapping mutants of SHP2 (PTP-CS and PTP-DA) identified STAT3 as a putative SHP-2 substrate. In vitro dephosphorylation of STAT3 but not JAK2 (upstream kinase of STAT3) with the SHP2 further confirm that STAT3 is a substrate of SHP2. These results demonstrate that LF to ECs induces an association of SHP2 with STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 is a substrate of SHP2. Taken together, these data clearly show that laminar flow suppressing IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling is, at least partially, mediated via the SHP2. SHP2 thus plays an atheroprotective role by attenuating endothelial responses to IL-6 under flow condition.",

            "text": "Expression and functions of different isoforms of Cdc37 cochaperone protein in CEM cells sensitive or resistant to apototsis Cdc37 is a co-chaperone protein, which participates to a complex with Hsp90, and forms a chaperone machinery specifically dedicated to maintain the correct folding and function of many signaling protein kinases. Cdc37 is a substrate of protein kinase CK2, which, phosphorylating its Ser13, enables the association of the client kinases to the complex (1). We analyzed the expression and functionality of Cdc37 in CEM T lymphocytes, a leukemia cell line available in two variants, S-CEM, normally sensitive to drug-induced apoptosis, and R-CEM, a multidrug resistant variant. This model was chosen to investigate the importance of Cdc37 amount and phosphorylation level in the phenomenon of apoptosis resistance. Moreover, since we have found that, for unknown reasons, the CK2 catalytic subunit is more abundant in R-CEM than in S-CEM (2), this cell model was also exploited to assess if there is a correlation between the level of CK2 and that of the chaperone machinery proteins. We found that the total amount and the Ser13 phosphorylation level of Cdc37 are quite similar in the two cell lines, but the S-CEM cells express a shorter isoform, lacking of a C-terminal tail. During apoptosis, Cdc37 is fragmented in S-CEM, while in R-CEM only the C-terminal part is rapidly cleaved, being the remaining main body of the protein much more stable. We also found that the amount of CK2 catalytic subunit rapidly decreases in S-CEM during apoptosis, in parallel with the cleavage of Cdc37, while, similarly to Cdc37, also CK2 appears more stable in R-CEM. This suggests that Cdc37 is involved in the regulation of the CK2 level in these cells, and that the Cdc37 isoform expressed in R-CEM is more efficient in preserving higher amount of the kinase. Translocation to cellular membranes is one of the hallmarks of PKC activation, occurring as a result of the generation of lipid secondary messengers in target membrane compartments. The activation-induced translocation of PKCs and binding to membranes is largely directed by their regulatory domains. We have previously reported that PKCg, member of the novel subfamily and an epithelial specific isoform, is localized at the cytoplasm and ER/Golgi and is translocated to the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope upon short-term activation by PMA. Here we show that PKCg is shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and that upon etoposide induced DNA damage is tethered at the nuclear envelope. Although PKCg expression and its phosphorylation on the hydrophobic motif (Ser675) are increased by etoposide, this phosphorylation is not required for its accumulation at the nuclear envelope. Moreover, we demonstrate that the C1b domain is sufficient for translocation to the nuclear envelope. We further show that, similar to full-length PKCg, the C1b domain could also confer protection against etoposideinduced cell death. Our studies demonstrate translocation of PKCg to the nuclear envelope, and suggest that its spatial regulation could be important for its cellular functions including effects on cell death. This article has recently been accepted for publication at the journal for Experimental Cell Research. Glutathione (GSH) plays a relevant role in the control of redox homeostasis even in philogenetically distant microbial species. The presence of GSH was recently hypothesized even in coldadapted sources, on the basis of the effects produced by this thiol on some antioxidant enzymes from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, a psychrophile isolated from the Antarctic sea. The possible existence of an enzyme system aimed at GSH biosynthesis in P. haloplanktis was investigated. This biochemical process involves the activity of the enzymes glutamyl-cysteine ligase (GshA) and glutathione synthetase (GshB). In the genome of P. haloplanktis two putative genes encoding GshA (PhGshAI and PhGshAII) and one encoding GshB (PhGshB) were identified. In order to characterize the first enzyme system for GSH biosynthesis in a psychrophilic source, recombinant forms of PhGshAII and PhGshB were obtained. It is known that each step leading to GSH from glutamate, cysteine and glycine involves the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. Therefore, a convenient assay for determining the activity of each enzyme was set up, using the radiolabelled compound [c32P]ATP. Concerning rPhGshB, the pH optimum of the activity was between 7.5 and 7.8. The affinity for ATP in the temperature range 10-30\u00b0C was evaluated. rPhGshB showed a significant activity even at low temperatures, whereas the Km ranges between 0.14 and 0.25 mM in the 10-30\u00b0C temperature range.",

Objective: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) can lead to liver failure in association with remote organ failure, both of which have significant rates of morbidity and mortality. In this study, novel spin-trapping and histopathological techniques have been used to investigate in vivo free radical formation in a rat model of warm liver IR injury. Materials and Methods: 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was administered to rats via intraperitoneal injection at a single dose of 1.5 g of pure DMPO/kg body weight 2 hours before the initiation of liver ischemia. Blood vessels supplying the median and left lateral hepatic lobes were occluded with an arterial clamp for 60 minutes, followed by 60 minute reperfusion. At the end of the experimental period, blood samples were obtained from the right ventricle to determine plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities and animals were sacrificed to obtain samples of nonischemic and postischemic liver tissue. The effects of DMPO on IR injury were evaluated by assessing hepatic ultrastructure via histopathological scoring. Hepatic conversion of xanthine dehygrogenase (XDH) to XO, and protein nitrone adducts were also measured as markers of in situ protein radical formation. Results: Total histopathological scoring of cellular damage was significantly decreased in hepatic IR injury following DMPO treatment. DMPO treatment also significantly decreased hepatic conversion of XDH to XO in IR injury compared with non-treated IR group. Formation of protein nitrone adducts were increased in livers of DMPO treated rats following IR injury compared to DMPO treated control tissues indicating increased in situ protein radical formation following IR injury and scavenging by DMPO. Conclusions: The current results suggest that the mechanism of action by which DMPO reduces IR damage is antioxidant protection against oxidative injury. Acknowledgement: This study was supported by a grant (110S275) (Bennett, 1835) , the Asia minor ground squirrel, is a group-living, diurnal and obligately winter hibernating about 6-9 months. Generally, it is accepted that hibernation is realized by the double effect of internal rhythm and external factors, and mammalian hibernation is characterized by prolonged torpor bouts interspersed by brief arousal periods. Dramatic changes in blood flow and oxygen consumption occur during torpor-arousal cycles in mammalian hibernators that could increase the risk of oxidative stress to sensitive tissues. However, studies showing that the effect of hibernation on oxidative stress in this species is limited. Thus, in the present study we aim to investigate the role of hibernation on lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide production and glutathione levels in various organs of Spermophilus xanthoprymnus. Materials and Methods: A total of 6 female ground squirrels were collected from different localities in Nig\u02d8de Bolkar Mountains -Turkey. The squirrels were housed individually in a room with an ambient temperature of 21\u00b0C and a 12 hour light/ 12 hour dark cycle, and were fed standard rodent diet and water ad libitum. While all squirrels were in three different cases: at hibernation, new wake up from hibernation and fully active form, they were sacrificed under anesthesia. Brain, heart, kidney, liver and lung tissues were excised, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a )80\u00b0C until use. Lipid peroxidation biomarker, malondialdehyde, reactive nitrogen oxide species which are stable end products of nitric oxide and glutathione levels were measured by spectrophotometer in tissues. Results and Discussion: We determined increased lipid peroxidation levels in the heart, lung, brain tissues at hibernation under the laboratory conditions when compared both new wake up from hibernation and fully active form of squirrels. However, both liver and kidney tissues MDA levels increased at fully active form of squirrels. At the same time, we found increased nonenzymatic GSH levels in the heart, liver and kidney tissues at the fully active form of the squirrels. Taken together, the increase in GSH levels may be protective against any oxidative stress resulting from arousal Background: Diabetic nephropathy is an important cause of end stage renal disease. Its incidence is closely correlated with duration of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to assess the oxidative stress status in diabetic nephropathy. Methods: Malondialdehyde, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, concentrations were measured in the serum samples of pre-and post-hemodialysis 30 patients with diabetic nephropathy and 30 non-diabetic nephropathy patients. Moreover, these parameters were also compared with healthy control subjects. Serum malondialdehyde values were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Results: We found that in both pre-and post-hemodialysis samples in the diabetic nephropathy patients, serum malondialdehyde concentrations were higher than the healthy controls (2.00 \u00b1 0.49, 2.48 \u00b1 0.55, 0.89 \u00b1 0.23 lmol/l, respectively). And, malondialdehyde concentrations were also higher in both pre-(0.98 \u00b1 0.20 lmol/l) and post-hemodialysis (2.18 \u00b1 0.69 lmol/l) serum samples of the patients with non-diabetic nephropathy compared with the control subjects (0.89 \u00b1 0.23 lmol/l). Additionally, malondialdehyde concentrations in post-hemodialysis serum samples were higher than in pre-hemodialysis samples of both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy patients. Conclusion: It was concluded that hemodialysis caused an increase in malondialdehyde levels. Therefore, patients undergoing hemodialysis may lead to exposure to oxidant stress.",

Even if microglia express LPA1 receptor (LPAR1), importance of ATX in cells submitted to oxidative stress was never studied before. In this study, we investigated the role of ATX in microglial response to oxidative stress.Mouse BV2 microglial cells and stable transfected overexpressing ATX BV2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Relative toxicity was determined using trypan blue, MTT and LDH methods. Autotaxine level were examined by QRT-PCR. Lysophosphatidic acid levels were enzymatically quantified. BV2 cells were treated by oleoyl-a-LPA and a LPA1R antagonist. Protein oxidation and ROS levels were determined by measuring carbonyl content and rates of DCF oxidation, respectively. BV2 cell expression of CD11b, a marker of microglial activation, was determined by flow cytometry. Autotaxine expression evaluated at mRNA, protein and LPA activity levels was significantly enhanced in non-transfected BV1 cells treated with 100 lM H 2 O 2 . Stable overexpression of ATX in BV2 cells protects from oxidative stress-induced cellular damages, improve cell viability, and reduces intracellular ROS formation and carbonylated protein accumulation. Annihilation of BV2 H 2 O 2 -mediated activation was evidenced by ATX overexpression.Our results suggest that oxidative stress-mediated enhancement in autotaxin secretion by microglia could represent a mechanism to protect CNS against in inflammation Sulforaphane (SF) is a natural dietary isothiocyanate produced by the enzymatic action of the myrosinase enzyme on glucoraphanin contained in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, and cabbage. It has been found that SF has significant pharmacological properties, such as antiinflammatory and chemopreventive. In addition, cardioprotective roles for SF have been demonstrated. Recent studies have shown that SF increases phase II enzyme gene transcription, protein expression, and enzyme activity in cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Also physical exercise, if moderate and constant, can lead to a higher antioxidant and detoxifying enzyme expression, while exhaustive exercise leads to oxidative stress. Our aim was to assess whether a diet supplemented with a broccoli extract could modify tissue redox state, modulating the expression of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes and modifying GSH levels. Female adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups (16 rats each): (i) control diet, (ii) control diet plus spontaneous exercise in running wheels and (iii) control diet supplemented with broccoli extract (250 mg/100 gdiet, 0.15 mg SF/ die). For each group, eight rats were sacrified before and eight after forced intense exercise on a treadmill for 30 minutes. Data show that both spontaneous physical exercise and broccoli supplementation prevent the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level raise observed in control animals. Furthermore we observed significant modification in the activity of some phase II enzyme in muscle, heart and liver that could suggest a protective role of mild and spontaneous physical exercise as well of broccoli extract supplementation towards a final exhaustive stress.",

After being released from the biosynthesis site, JHs are transported and protected by JH binding proteins (JHBPs). A direct comparison of the spectroscopic properties of G. mellonella JHBP with the properties of simple proteins which lack Trp residues suggested that JHBP contains some unusual chromophore molecules, because it exhibits additional fluorescence with a maximum near 420 nm, after excitation at 315 nm.

Background: According to a number of reports, oxidative stress (OS) might be involved in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PO), one of the most critical disorders for elderly women (1). In particular, evidences suggest that oxygen reactive species (ROS) are able to influence bone metabolism, inducing the imbalance between bone resorption and formation, responsible for PO onset (2) . Objectives: The aim of our study was to investigate whether OS is involved in bone metabolism and PO development. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional population-based study on 103 climacteric women including 31 in peri-and 72 in post-menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD) of femur and spine was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The bone health status was also evaluated by assessing serum levels of bone alkaline phophatase (BAP) and collagen type 1 crosslinked C-telopeptide (CTX-1), markers of bone formation and resorption, respectively. Serum levels of hydroperoxides (Hy), total antioxidants, uric acid (UA), thiols and bone markers were also determined. Results: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis revealed 25 healthy, 47 osteopenic and 31 osteoporotic subjects. Total antioxidants mean values were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in both osteopenic and osteoporotic with respect to healthy women. Thiols and UA also showed a similar trend, but the differences between groups were not significant. Antioxidants and UA were also significantly correlated with BMD of femur (r = 0.373 and 0.390, respectively). Moreover, CTX-1 was associated with Hy (r = 0.328, p < 0.05), but only in postmenopausal group. Conclusion: Oxidative stress could play an important role in PO development by increasing the rate of bone resorption. Our findings are also suggestive of a potential use of antioxidants supplementation in PO treatment. The health-promoting effect of fruit and vegetable consumption is thought to be due to fresh plant-contained phytochemicals. However, a remarkable amount of the food intake in the human diet comes from processed foodstuffs, and whether processed foods provide the same benefits as unprocessed ones is an open question. Prunes are obtained by drying the fruit of certain cultivars of plum (Prunus domestica L.), and possess the highest antioxidant activity among the most commonly consumed fruits and vegetables. Melanoidins from heat-processed plums (prunes) were isolated and their presence confirmed by hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content and browning index. The endothelial cell (EC) plays a crucial role in the integration and modulation of signals within the vascular wall and perturbation of such homeostasis by oxidative damage is the trigger for the development of several cardiovascular diseases CVD. The present work was undertaken with the intent to investigate whether food melanoidins isolated from prunes might protect human EC against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress and cell damage. In control and melanoidin-treated cells, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox status was assessed by using the novel, redox-sensitive, ratiometric fluorescent protein sensor (roGFP), while mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was investigated with the fluorescent dye, JC-1. Treatment of ECV304 cells with hydrogen peroxide dose dependently induced mitochondrial and cytoplasmic oxidation, MMP dissipation with ensuing cell death. Pretreatment of ECV304 with prune melanoidins, significantly counteracted and ultimately abolished hydrogen peroxide elicited phenomena, clearly indicating that these polymers protect human EC against oxidative stress.

Recently, some of the GST isozyme levels, particularly GST-pi have been found to increase in various tumor tissues. GST-pi is considered as an indicator of cancer and it is induced in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Hypericin is one of the plant derived oral antidepressant which increases serotonin levels in the hypothalamus. Besides, its antiviral, antitumoral activity, due to its capacity for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by light induction, make its use possible in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. The aim of this study was to purify GST-pi from rat small intestine and investigate the effects of hypericin. Glutathione S-transferases were purified using affinity chromatography on S-Hexylglutathione Sepharose 6B column. The purified GSTs were then loaded on to PBE-118 chromatofocusing column and isozymes were separated with Pharmalyte/HCl pH 8. GST-pi was eluted at the isoelectric point of 8.97 and it gave a subunit molecular weight of 24 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The Km values were calculated as 97 \u00b1 13 lM and 175 \u00b1 19 lM at varied [GSH] and varied [CDNB], respectively. Hypericin was found to be an inhibitor for GST-pi; noncompetitive inhibition pattern was found at varied [GSH] with a Ki value of 2.46 \u00b1 0.43 lM whereas when the varied substrate was CDNB, the inhibition type was competitive and a Ki value of 0.55 \u00b1 0.07 lM, was obtained. The over-expression of GST-pi is a characteristic of resistance to chemotherapeutics in cancer and the inhibition of GST-pi by hypericin may increase the efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs.

Demir, B. Yuce-Dursun and C. Gunduz Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science and Letters, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey A redox imbalance in a healthy living system leads to malfunctioning of cells that ultimately results in various diseases, including cancer, neurological degeneration, and arthritis as well as accelerating the aging process. Therefore, therapeutic strategies should aim at reducing free-radical formation and scavenging free radicals. Free radicals and other reactive oxygen species, collectively known as ROS are generated continuously via normal physiological processes and more so in pathological conditions. Developing better antioxidants is a major challenge for the redox biology field. Many antioxidants are available but most have failed in clinical studies. Coumarins are a very large group of 1,2-benzopyrones derivatives that are widely distributed in a variety of natural plant sources and have been found to exhibit a variety of biological and pharmacological activities and have raised considerable interest because of their potential beneficial effects on human health. Very few systematic studies have been reported on structure-antioxidant activity correlations in coumarins. The nine coumarin derivatives bearing different functionalities such as amino, hydroxyl, azo and nitro have been synthesized and confirmed on the basis of their spectral data. They were examined for the first time for their effect on radical scavenging, Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ reducing and metal chelating activity, in order to establish structure activity relationship. The results were compared with standard antioxidants such as trolox, a-tocopherol and ascorbic acid.

Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are ubiquitous proteins that decompose hydroperoxides at very high rates by means of very reactive cysteines. Peroxiredoxins disulfides are frequently reduced by thioredoxin (Trx), enzyme disulfide reductase that possesses two highly conserved redox-active cysteine residues in a Cys-X-X-Cys motif. Thioredoxin make use of the N-terminal thiol to reduce the disulfide bridge of the target proteins, releasing a protein thiol and forming a transient mixed disulfide bridge with a cysteine residue of the target. Then, the C-terminal thiol of Trx Cys-X-X-Cys motif attacks the mixed disulfide bridge, releasing the reduced target and oxidized Trx, with an intra molecular disulfide bridge. Therefore, substitution of specific cysteine residues by serines can stabilize protein complexes linked by mixed disulfides. Despite the importance of the Prx and Trx in the cellular redox control, the molecular mechanisms of electron transfer between these enzymes and the events involved in establishment of these protein complexes remain poorly understood. Therefore, the cytosolic Prx isoforms Tsa1 and Ahp1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their mutants Tsa1C170S and Ahp1C120S were expressed and oxidized by DTNB, diamide or peroxides. To follow complex formation, equivalent amounts of oxidized Prx were reacted with reduced Trx1C33S and the results were evaluated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and ESI-QTOF mass spectrometry. Our data revealed that the only Tsa1-Trx1C33S and Ahp1-Trx1C33S combinations were able to form stable proteins complexes, but only when hydroperoxides were used to oxidize Prx. Mass spectrometry also revealed that the complexes are maintained by N terminal cysteine from Trx and the C-terminal cysteine from Prx. Moreover analysis of several Prx crystallographic structures suggest that the disulfide oxidized Prx exerts a strong influence on the molecular surface of Prx, required to productive interaction with Trx. Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable clonal B-cell malignancy that occurs in the bone marrow, characterized by the expansion of terminally differentiated plasma cells, specialized in the synthesis and secretion of high levels of immunoglobulin. In the endoplasmic reticulum of these cells, the formation of intra-and interchain disulfide bonds drives immunoglobulin proper folding and assembly, which are essential for its stability and function. Electrons produced as a consequence of these bonds formation are finally accepted by molecular oxygen, giving rise to stoichiometric hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) per disulfide bond formed. Therefore, thanks to the overload of immunoglobulin production, MM cells continuously accumulate unfolded proteins and H 2 O 2 , which can lead to cell death. Cellular defense systems for these specific forms of stress have been explored as therapeutic targets for MM. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) I and IV belong to a family of ubiquitous proteins able to catalyze peroxide detoxification and also to act as molecular chaperones, functions that are influenced by their oligomeric state. Peroxiredoxins I is distributed in the cytoplasm, whereas Prx IV is the endoplasmic reticulum-localized isoform. To investigate the association of these protective enzymes with immunoglobulin production in MM cells, we quantified intracellular light chain accumulation by ELISA in MM cell lineages cultured along 12 days and its potential impact on Prxs I and IV expression, evaluated by qPCR and Western blotting. Our results demonstrated that the raise in light chain amounts during the culture period was accompanied by induction of Prxs I and IV, both at mRNA and protein levels, thus suggesting that these enzymes are crucial components of the cellular adaptive response of MM cells to cope with the H 2 O 2 associated with the massive disulfide bond formation during immunoglobulin synthesis.",

Oncogenes deregulation is not enough to induce cellular proliferation and tumorigenic transformation, which are caused by a variety of cooperating mechanisms. The oncogene Ras requires deregulation of other oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, to increase the cell proliferation rate and to transform completely the cells. Expression of the constitutively activated oncogene H-RasV12 induces a proliferative arrest in normal fibroblasts due to senescence, apoptosis and autophagy, associated with DNA damage. H-RasV12 activation leads to an aberrant DNA replication increase, genomic instability and the activation of DNA Damage Response (DDR), which serves like tumorigenic barrier in pre-neoplastic lesion. In this work, we show that senescence induced in human fibroblasts by transfection with H-RasV12, is associated with DNA damage as well as with redox cellular imbalance. Flow cytometer analyses indicate that redox imbalance is due to both ROS increase and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, oxidative stress triggers important protein post-translational modifications by functional regulation via S-glutathionylation. Interestingly, in mono-and bi-dimensional electrophoresis there are evidences for the presence of different S-glutathionylation patterns in normal and activated H-RasV12 cells. It is known that protein S-glutathionylation is important both to the protection of protein cysteinyl groups sensitive to oxidative stress and to modulate the activity of several target proteins involved in tumor progression and/or cell death. In conclusion, H-RasV12 induced cellular redox imbalance and S-glutathionylation of target proteins may be associated to proliferative arrest and cellular death.

Pretreatment of cells with 50 lM EGCG, 50 lM DHA and 50 lM EGCG + DHA for 1 hour, decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels; therefore, the pretreatments protected cell damage produced by H 2 O 2 for 3 hours. Also, the flavonoid and the omega-3 fatty acid pretreatments decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels produced by H 2 O 2 and t-BOOH, which are quantified by the DCFH assay. The Comet assay also demonstrated that these molecules protected DNA damage produced by oxidative stress, so EGCG and DHA have antigenotoxic properties in rat hepatocytes cells.

Isolates of C. terrigena N3H and N1C testosteroni or C. testosteroni K1 and K3 selected from polluted environments exhibited high catalases activity with considerable diversity in catalase and peroxidase expression, most likely due to selective environmental pressure. The exogenous stress effect of 20 mM H 2 O 2 in the C. testosteroni CCM 1931 and C. terrigena CCM 2409 strains stimulated peroxidatic activity which supports metabolic oxidation leading to agent decay, while the significant increase of catalase activity in the H 2 O 2adapted isolates to 60 mM may be involved in resistance to reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that catalases are essential not only for very efficient decomposing substances containing a peroxidic bond but they could play an important role in the decay of some pollutants. They can contribute to a better understanding of the physiological role of catalases in bacterial responses to polluted environments.

These findings support the idea that the oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis underlying dementia and Parkinson neurodegeneration. Keywords: Dementia, Parkinson disease, malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity, antioxidant enzymes. Oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous degenerative or chronic diseases, such as chronic renal insufficiency. Elevated oxidative status and reduced antioxidant defence systems in patients with chronic renal insufficiency accelerate the prevalence of atherosclerosis and other chronic complications. Oxidative modifications of structural proteins play a significant role in the etiology and/or progression of several human diseases. 3-Nitrotyrosine is thought to be a relatively specific marker of protein oxidation mediated by peroxynitrite. Nitric oxide produced from arginine by endothelial nitric oxide synthase is a potent endogenous vasodilator that plays an important role in regulation of blood flow and pressure. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. The aim of the study was to investigate the changes on levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, nitrotyrosine and nitric oxide in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. A total of 64 patients with chronic renal failure were enrolled in this study and were treated by hemodialysis. As the control group (n = 22), subjects with normal renal function were included. Asymmetric dimethylarginine and nitrotyrosine levels were quantitated by ELISA method. Nitric oxide level was measured by spectrophotometric method. Serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, nitrotyrosine and nitric oxide were significantly increased in patients with chronic renal failure compared to controls (p < 0.001). The results have support that an increase in oxidative stress is considered one of the major risk factors in chronic renal failure patients. This study indicates the existence and increased production of an oxidizing stress resulting from hemodialysis and disturbance in antioxidant systems. We have previously demonstrated that imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and elimination results in apoptosis induction in primary cultured chorion (C) cells, and not in amnion (A) cells of human fetal membrane tissues prepared at the term, indicating differences in sensitivity to oxidative stress between C-and A-cells. Results from our laboratory also demonstrated that the expression of various stem cell marker genes was detected in these primary cultured cells. Of note, recent studies demonstrated that OCT-4 gene among stem cell-associated genes plays a critical role in responding to external stimuli including anti-cancer reagents. We thus hypothesized the involvement of OCT-4 in the differential sensitivity to oxidative stress between two primary cultured cells. In this study, treatment of C-cells with a nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), induced significant reduction in OCT-4 expression level, accompanying with apoptosis induction associated with caspase-9 and -3 activation. However, the same phenomena were not observed in Acells. Furthermore, knockdown of OCT-4 using a TRUE gene silencing method (tRNaseZL-utilizing efficacious gene silencing) not only sensitized the A-cells to SNP treatment, resulted in apoptosis induction along with activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but also strengthened the effect of SNP on the C-cells. These results indicated the contribution of OCT-4 to the differential sensitivity, suggesting that OCT-4 could be a candidate target gene for modifying the sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by various external stimuli such as anti-cancer reagent. Metal oxide nanoparticles exhibit unique properties which are exploited in many fields of technology and medicine. Among these novel materials, ZnO is already produced in high tonnage with commercial applications ranging from catalysts and pigments to UV absorbers in sunscreens and cosmetics materials. In view of the considerable development of nanotechnologies and nanomedicine it is important to evaluate the potential risk of nanoparticles for human health. Zinc oxide nanoparticles with different chemical compositions, differing in size and shape have been proven to be genotoxic and cytotoxic effect on human health due to the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress, lysosomal damage, mitochondria damage and cell death via apoptosis. In this study, measurement of reactive oxygen species, cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of large-scale produced ZnO nanoparticles were evaluated after exposure of the Chinese hamster lung cell line (V79 379A). Accordingly; at first Chinese hamster lung cells (V79 379 A) were exposed to appropriate concentration of ZnO materials, time and concentration dependent decrease in the cell viability was observed MTT reduction and Neutral red uptake assays. To determine reactive oxygen species level, DCFH (dichlorofluorescin) assay was performed because of the popularity for oxidative damage screening due to its low cost and automation. To investigate the apoptotic effect of ZnO particles, DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining assay was done. The results showed that ZnO nanoparticles cause cytotoxicity on healthy cells dependent on times and concentrations, induce oxidative stress and apoptosis. Intracellular ROS levels were significantly increased dependent on time and concentration. Eventually, our results indicate the induction of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptotic effect by ZnO We have studied interaction of the novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (MTA) with cells and their protective effects confirmed their high efficiency. These antioxidants named SkQ1 and fluorescent SkQR1 are conjugate of antioxidant (plastoquinol) and cationic part (triphenylphosphonium or rhodamine-derivates in fluorescent analogue). SkQR1 specifically accumulated in mitochondria during 1-2 hour and can be visualized in cells by fluorescent or confocal microscopy. In spite of rapid accumulation of MTA antioxidant effect during H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress and cell death was developed slowly (24 hour for normal fibroblasts and 8 days for tumor carcinoma HeLa cells). Uncoupler FCCP which reduces mitochondrial potential prevents accumulation of SkQR1 and abolishes his protective effect. Expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp 170) one of the major multidrug resistance pump (MDR) non specifically extrude positively charged lipophilic compounds and suppresses accumulation of SkQR1. SkQR1 accumulation was increased by inhibitor of PgP170 pluronic L61 in tumor cells with high level of MDR but not in normal fibroblasts with low level MDR. Also we have suggested that long preincubation of cells with MTA for protective effects is needed for accumulation MTA in small population of mitochondria that have decreased membrane potential and produce the major part of reactive oxygen species.

Hermesz Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Neuroscience, Faculty of Science and Informatics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary Introduction: The development and toxic effects of diabetes on different organs have been attributed to increased levels of free radical generation, resulting in metabolic imbalances, morphological and functional alterations in many tissues. Metallothioneins (MTs) and heme oxygenases (HOs) act as potent antioxidant and stress proteins that protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress. The aims of this study were to compare the effectiveness of the endogenous antioxidant defence system in different gut segments of streptozotocin diabetic rats, and to study the effects of insulin replacement in prevention the diabetes-related alterations. Materials and methods: The streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model was used to elucidate the region-specific expression of ho-1, ho-2, mt-1 and mt-2 genes and the apoptotic marker caspase-3 in control, diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats. Expression levels were followed by reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in duodenum, ileum and colon after removing mucosa and submucosa. Results: The stress-induced alterations revealed gene-, isoformand segment-specificity. The duodenum proved to be the most responsible gut segment in the diabetic rats: most of the examined genes, ho-1, mt-1, mt-2 and caspase-3, were significantly upregulated. In contrast in the ileum and colon, only the mt-1 mRNA was elevated. The beneficial effect of insulin was demonstrated in all gut segments by unaltered expression of mt-1 and ho-1 following insulin treatment. Conclusion: These findings furnish evidence that different intestinal segments exhibit different susceptibilities to the diabetic state and to insulin replacement, possibly due to the variable capacity of the antioxidant defence system.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients is associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha-308 polymorphism Reactive oxygen species (ROS), regulatory molecules implicated in the signaling cascade triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have important role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Also, it is well known that TNF-a is increased in CLL patients and acts as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor. Since there are strong evidence that TNF-a (-308) polymorphism is responsible for higher rate of TNF transcription, we have investigate the association of this polymorphism with oxidative stress in CLL development. In this study, we have analyzed polymorphism in TNF-a gene (TNF-a-308 G/A SNP) by PCR-RFLP; the activity of catalase, gluthatione peroxidase were measured by spectrophotometric methods; the level of MDA was measured by TBAR method; and nitrites were estimated using the colorimetric method of Griess. All these parameters were measured in peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from 49 CLL patients and 40 healthy controls. The obtained results showed significant increase of MDA level, but not nitrites, in heterozygote and homozygote patients for investigated polymorphism (p < 0.01). The positive correlation of MDA level (as a measure of lipid peroxidation) and polymorphic allele A (highly productive TNF allele) confirms that TNF induce ROS production and oxidative modification of organic molecules. The activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) were higher in patients with polymorphic allele A, probably as a consequence of increased production of free radicals. Since the level of oxidative stress strongly depends on TNF genotype we recommend intensifying antioxidative therapy, especially for CLL patients heterozygote or homozygote for TNF-a (-308) polymorphism. Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites and small molecules that are not necessary for normal growth or development. Secondary metabolites have a tremendous impact on society, and they are exploited for their antibiotics and pharmaceutical activities such as anticancer, antitumor, immuno-stimulatory and antioxidants. It is also demonstrated that Aspergillus could produce antioxidants as metabolites. Thus, the present study was aimed at evaluating antioxidant potential of Aspergillus sp. broth filtrate. In our study we examined broth filtrate DPPH and radical scavenging activity, and also total phenol content (Folin cicolteu reagent). We used 20 fungi samples in our study. We detected free radical scavenging activity over 80% in four fungi among them. In parallel with these results total phenol substance content was quite high, too. Phenolic acids in filtrates were determined in thin layer chromatography by comparing with standards. According to these results natural antioxidants gained from fungi are very essential resources in terms of biotechnology. Studies of isolating and purifying agent substances in extracts will be done by using advanced techniques. Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) is a large family of enzyme, playing an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics by conjugating reduced glutathione to electrophilic centers of these molecules. The increased GST isozyme levels in some tumor tissues suggest that GSTs may be considered as a marker for some types of tumors and they might appear as a response to chemotherapy. Antidepressant drugs are commonly used by cancer patients. The effect of antidepressants on GSTs is not well characterized. These effects may be important for the prognosis of the disease. Hypericin (known as Saint John's Worth) is an oral drug used for mild or moderate depression therapy. It is also used as a light inducible compound in the treatment of tumors by photodynamic therapy (PDT). Since it is taken orally, hypericin may also show an effect on gastrointestinal tract enzymes. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of hypericin on one of the GST isozymes, GST-a, which was purified from rat small intestine using affinity chromatography on S-Hexylglutathione Sepharose 6B. Chromatofocusing of the affinity eluate on PBE-118 column gave a peak for GST-a isozyme at pH 9.58. A subunit molecular weight of 25 kDa for GST-a on SDS-PAGE was found. The K m values of 248 \u00b1 43 and 150 \u00b1 28 lM for [GSH] and [CDNB] were found, respectively. Hypericin showed an uncompetitive inhibition pattern for GST-a, using [GSH] as a varied substrate (K i : 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 lM), whereas non-competitive inhibition pattern was found when the [CDNB] was used as a varied substrate (K i : 1.91 \u00b1 0.21 lM). We conclude that since, hypericin is used in the photodynamic therapy of cancer and the inhibition of GST-a may increase the effectivity of the treatment.

Keywords: Glutathione-S-transferase-alpha, hypericin, inhibition kinetics P26.32 Biochemical properties of the superoxide dismutase from the pathogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are an important enzyme family for the inactivation of toxic electrophiles. They conjugate them with reduced glutathione (GSH). Glutathione S-transferases are widely distributed in all living organisms. Elevated levels of glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-pi) has been shown in tumour tissues. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic anti-depressant drug, was developed as a non-selective amine reuptake inhibitor. It is highly prescribed drug for cancer patients for mood elevation but there is limited study about the interaction of amitriptyline with GST-pi. The aim of this study is to elucidate the impact of the inhibitory behavior of GST-pi by amitriptyline and to discuss its possible controversial role in decreasing the enzymatic barrier formed by GST-pi and increasing the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs. GST-pi was purified from rat small intestine using Sephadex G25 filtration, S-hexyl GSH Sepharose 6B affinity chromatography and chromatofocusing on PBE 118 column. GST-pi eluated as a single peak from PBE118 at pH 8.97 (pI). It also gave a single band on SDS-PAGE with a subunit molecular weight of 24 kDa. The concentration dependent inhibition of GST-pi by amitriptyline followed an inverse hyperbolic inhibition curve reaching to a maximum inhibition of 63 percent at infinite [amitriptyline] and an IC50 value of 5.54 mM was obtained. When the varied substrate is GSH the inhibition type of GST-pi by amitriptyline was competitive (K i = 1.62 \u00b1 0.13 mM), but when the varied substrate is CDNB the inhibition type was non-competitive (K i = 1.98 \u00b1 0.31 mM). We conclude that, although its K i values are at the millimolar range, the inhibition of GST-pi by amitriptyline might have a minor supportive role on the effectiveness of the anticancer drugs.",

These two pathologies were chosen for study to develop a proper strategy for protection of the kidney. Mitochondria were found to be a key player in these pathologies, being both the source and the target for excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A mitochondria-targeted compound which is a conjugate of a positively charged rhodamine molecule with plastoquinone (SkQR1) was found to rescue the kidney from the deleterious effect of both pathologies. Intraperitoneal injection of SkQR1 before the onset of pathology not only normalized the level of ROS and lipid peroxidized products in kidney mitochondria but also decreased the level of cytochrome c in the blood, restored normal renal excretory function and significantly lowered mortality among animals having a single kidney exposed to ischemia/reperfusion. The SkQR1-derivative missing plastoquinone (C12R1) possessed some, although limited nephroprotective properties and enhanced animal survival after ischemia/reperfusion. SkQR1 was found to induce some elements of nephroprotective pathways providing ischemic tolerance such as an increase in erythropoietin levels and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3b in the kidney.

In summary, exposure to NPs resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in cultured ECV304 cells that was associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondria damage. Tumor cells generally exhibit a cross-resistance to a large number of compounds chemically and structurally unrelated (multidrug resistance, MDR), partly determined by the overexpression of efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) [1] . Some MRPs are involved in the co-transport of glutathione (GSH) that is required for the MRP-mediated extrusion of chemoterapeutic drugs [2] . Furthermore, both carcinogenesis and MDR are frequently associated with increased oxidative stress and activation of the cellular redox metabolism [3] . How anti-neoplastic agents induce MDR in cancer cells and the role of GSH in the activation of pumps such as the MRPs are still open questions. GSH is the most abundant cellular thiol and plays a pivotal role in cancer and MDR development [4] . The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is the most important pathway for cellular GSH recycling because glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme, produces the NADPH used by glutathione reductase to reduce glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to GSH. We report that a doxorubicin-resistant human colon cancer cell line (HT29-DX), exhibiting decreased doxorubicin accumulation and increased intracellular GSH content and MRP1 and MRP2 expression in comparison to doxorubicin-sensitive HT29 cells, shows increased activity of the PPP and of G6PD. We observed the onset of MDR in HT29 cells overexpressing G6PD, accompanied by an increase of GSH; the G6PD inhibitors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) reversed the increase of G6PD and GSH and inhibited MDR both in HT29-DX cells and in HT29 cells overexpressing G6PD. The activation of the PPP and an increased activity of G6PD could be necessary to some MDR cells to keep high the GSH content, which is in turn necessary to extrude anticancer drugs out of the cell. Our data could provide a new further mechanism for GSH increase and its effects on MDR acquisition. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is a rapid, selective and convenient method for sample preparation prior to the analysis of compounds in the volatile matrices of vegetable products. In addition, SFE is a simple, inexpensive, fast, effective and virtually solvent-free sample pretreatment technique. For these reasons the use of supercritical fluids in the extraction of plant volatile compounds has increased during two last decades. Salvia desoleana L. is a herbaceous perennial shrub native into the island of Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea. The essential oil of this species is very similar to that of Salvia sclarea, and contains the same active compounds, linalool, linalyl acetate, and sclareol. It is becoming increasingly evident that natural compounds isolated from plants provide benefits to the human health either by interacting with important signaling pathways or by modulating the intracellular redox state. The extract of Salvia desoleana L. was obtained by setting up an efficient SFE process with carbon dioxide, and its biological activity, in term of antioxidant activity was tested on normal (HUVEC) and transformed (ECV304) human endothelial cells. Results indicated a strong antioxidant activity on both cellular models, which was evidenced by the inhibition of both hydrogen peroxide-induced ROS generation and cell damage. Extensive studies about non-covalent hemin-albumin complexes suggested the possibility of using covalent and non-covalent hemin/protein complexes to induce cell death. This work studied two carbodiimide-promoted hemin covalent complexes, hemin-BSA and hemin-protamine. BSA-and protamine-heme iron covalent complexes exhibited catalytic activities: peroxidase-and catalase-like activities. The catalase-like activity was determined by generation of molecular oxygen after HOOH addition, using a Clark-type O 2 electrode. Catalase-like activity of hemin-BSA was 6-fold higher than that exhibited by hemin-protamine. Peroxidase activity was investigated by UV-Vis and EPR spectroscopy in the presence of HOOH as an oxidant agent, and pcresol as a reducer agent. The EPR experiments indicated that both covalent complexes have peroxidase activity since the loss of EPR signal after HOOH addition and typical of the formation of a high valence intermediate was recovered after the addition of the reducer agent. However, the EPR signal was totally regenerated after a peroxidase cycle of hemin-protamine complex while the recovering of Fe 3+ hemin-BSA signal was partial and accompanied by the appearance of a EPR signal at g = 4.3, characteristic of oxidized porphyrin. The use of the spin trapping DMPO (3,4-Dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-pyrrole 1oxide) revealed the occurrence of homolytic peroxidase cleavage by both complexes but the signal was significantly more intense for the protamine-hemin complex. This result suggests predominance of homolytic cleavage by this complex or the possibility that BSA act as a free radical trapping of hydroxyl radical. Consistently, hemin-protamine complex was able to exacerbate the capacity of HOOH to induce death of K562 cells challenged by HOOH (by necro apoptosis) while hemin-BSA complex further decreased the capacity of HOOH to induce death of the leukemic cells.",

Oxidative damage on human U937 leukemia cell culture was detected by ultraweak photon emission, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dotblot and comet assay. Ultra-weak photon emission was used to follow the kinetics of cell oxidative damage using highly sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT). Other methods were used to quantify oxidative damage of biomacromolecules. Evidence that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radical (HO\u2022) catalyze oxidative damage in human U937 leukemia cells are presented. Detection of malondialdehyde (MDA), byproduct of lipid peroxidation, by isocratic reverse-phase HPLC revels HO\u2022 caused lipid peroxidation while H 2 O 2 caused no effect after 30 minutes. incubation. Dotblot reveals that HO\u2022 caused much higher oxidative damage to proteins that H 2 O 2 while thanks to comet assay it can be said that there was some but no significant difference in oxidative damage of DNA caused by H 2 O 2 and HO\u2022.

We assessed in plasma and platelets: Nitric Oxide (NO) and Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) levels; Lipid hydroperoxide levels, assessed by oxidation with ferrous xylenol orange (FOX); Lipoperoxide levels, assessed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs); Conjugated dienes levels only in platelets; Paraoxonase activity only in plasma. NO levels significantly decreased, while ONOO-FOX TBARs levels significantly increased in platelets and plasma of obese pregnant women compared to pregnant controls, with a stronger respectively decrease or increase in platelets respect to plasma. Conjugated dienes levels increased significantly in platelets, while Paraoxonase activity significantly decreased in plasma of patients compared with controls. Significant correlation between BMI and all the parameters assessed were observed. Our data highlighted that pathological condition obesity-related induces important modifications on NO metabolism, reducing its bioavailability and engaging ONOO-production; ONOOamplify and propagate tissue oxidative damage, as demonstrated by increased peroxidation levels. Major modifications observed in platelets compared with plasma could lead to an higher reactivity and aggregability of platelets, inducing both atherosclerotic process onset, and a more difficult maternal-foetal circulation with consequent gestational complications.",

In Azotobacter vinelandii, the absence of the rhodanese-like protein RhdA results in an impaired redox condition and in the activation of the OxyR-regulon mediated response. Moreover, the finding that in the RhdA-null mutant the glutathione pool was depleted and glutathione precursors were accumulated suggested an impairment in the regeneration pathway of reduced glutathione (GSH). In the presence of hydroxyl radical (OH*), GSH is oxidized to glutathione thiyl radical (GS*) which needs an enzymatic pathway to be recovered as glutathione disulfide (GSSG), a GSH-generable form. Proteins with a low-pKa cysteine residue (like in the case of RhdA) are good candidates to stabilize an adduct with GS* for enzymatic GSSG dependent recovery. In the present study, we found that RhdA was able to specifically bind both GSH and GS* in vitro with high affinity (K d = lM range) and that RhdA-Cys230 residue was mandatory for the adduct formation. The RhdA/glutathione adduct was stable enough to be used as a substrate to produce GSSG (kcat = 628 s-1), despite MS analyses did not reveal the formation of a covalent bond. The RhdA scavenging activity of GS* was O 2dependent suggesting that O 2 might be the final acceptor of the radical. The GS*-scavenging activity of RhdA supports the phenotype observed on the RhdA-null mutant defined in our previous studies, highlighting RhdA's key role as ROS-level mediator by preserving glutathione from irreversible oxidations induced by OH*.",

            "text": "Role of glutathione and oxidative state on marker genes involved in bone remodelling Several studies have recently linked reactive oxygen species and GSH to bone metabolism and remodelling but molecular mechanisms related to these events are little known. Previously, we demonstrated in osteoblast-like cells, SaOS-2, a relationship between changes in alkaline phosphatase activity (biochemical marker of osteogenic differentiation) and variations of intracellular redox state. This study evaluates in SaOS-2 cells whether GSH/GSSG ratio levels, index of intracellular redox status, are related to specific expression markers of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization such as RUNX-2 and osteocalcin (OCN). The expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteoclastogenesis markers produced in osteoblasts and in osteocytes, is also studied. RANKL induces and OPG inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activity. RANKL/OPG ratio is involved in the bone remodelling. The modulation of GSH/GSSG ratio in SaOS-2 cells, during osteogenic differentiation was obtained by GSH or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis. The results showed that an high oxidative state decreased RUNX-2 and OCN expression which enhanced when the oxidative state was reduced. Redox regulation of RUNX-2 activation by phosphorylation was also confirmed. OPG expression levels were decreased in BSO treated cells, and GSH was able both to eliminate BSO effect and to augment OPG expression. Differently, redox alterations did not affect RANKL expression. Thereafter, the changes measured in the ratio RANKL/OPG suggest that an elevated oxidative status supports osteoclastogenesis. Differently, GSH can reverse this effect by the maintaining of intracellular reduced status and the decrease of RANKL/OPG ratio. These results may be useful to develop novel therapeutic strategies in bone redox-dysregulated diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and bone diseases related to inflammation processes. Hypoxic conditions elicit a series of cellular and systemic response to assist animal in their adaptation and survival to hypoxic stress through several mechanisms such as neoangiogenesis promotion, improved glycolytic flux enhancing energy production, and upregulation of molecules related to cell survival, providing enough energy for essential activities. The transcriptional response to hypoxia is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). The levels of HIF variants are different in cells or tissues in different environment. In particular, histological study has revealed the low level of HIFs in lung tissue in which oxygen probably has much higher level than most of other organs. Ones would conceive that accumulation of enough HIFs might trigger surviving capability of cells for adaptation to drastic or harsh condition, such as ischemia or hypoxia in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) or oxidative stress was raised as a causative factor for further damage.",

Anyway, methods used to evaluate AA are usually based on narrow conceptual basis, so giving limited biological information. For example, two widespread methods, the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), may only evaluate the scavenging activity of a non-physiological radical cation or a peroxyradical, respectively. In this study, an improved ORAC assay has been developed. This new method is based on the enzymatic reaction between soybean lipoxygenase (LOX)-1 isoenzyme and fluorescein (FL) in presence of linoleic acid (LA). Briefly, hydroperoxidation of LA entails anaerobic secondary reactions generating physiological radicals able to quench FL fluorescence. We have studied kinetic of this reaction in some detail showing that antioxidants may be quantified by measuring the delay induced in FL quenching (ORAC/LOX assay). Notably, this assay may simultaneously detect many antioxidant functions of phytochemicals: scavenging of some radical species, iron ion reducing and chelating activities, inhibition of pro-oxidant enzyme, thus providing a comprehensive AA evaluation and suggesting ability of ORAC/LOX assay to highlight synergism. The ORAC/LOX assay was very sensitive to phenolic compounds providing AA values of 34.3 \u00b1 1.8 (SE, n = 4) lmol Trolox eq\u2022g-1 of cherry puree, about two and five times higher than ORAC and TEAC values, respectively.

Interestingly, when plasma and phenols were mixed, the ORAC/LOX assay, as expected, was able to better highlight synergism: eight times more than ORAC, whereas TEAC was unable to measure synergism under our experimental conditions.",

Both premature ageing and chronic oxidative stress (OS) are typical features of DS (1). The involvement of OS in the pathogenesis of this syndrome suggests the use of antioxidant molecules as potential therapeutic strategy. Dietary components, such as polyphenols, play a key role in the antioxidant defence in vivo. Among them, the o-diphenol hydroxytyrosol (HTy) (2), naturally occurring in virgin olive oil, displays high scavenging activity, and is endowed with antithrombotic, antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. HTy is characterized by high bioavailability in humans and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. We investigated the responsiveness of DS cells to oxidative stress conditions and the possible protective role played by HTy and its in vivo metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol, using intact erythrocytes (RBC) from both controls and trisomic patients, incubated in the presence of t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). Free radical generation in RBC from DS patients were significantly higher than in the controls, even under baseline conditions, confirming previous data on increased oxidative microenvironment in DS tissues (3) . Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, as assessed by isoprostane formation. The t-BHP-induced alterations were prevented by incubating intact RBC with microM phenol concentrations, being the two antioxidants protective in the same concentration range (10-100 microM). Therefore, HTy represents a good candidate for novel therapeutic strategies in DS.",

We try to evaluate selected biomarkers according to their biochemical properties to indicate selenium usefulness in clinical usage and its potential effectiveness in reduction complications or patient's outcome in groups diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis. Patients with selenium intravenous injection supplementation within 1-3 weeks were compared with those without admission. During monitoring time more than 120% elevation in serum Creactive protein levels were present in placebo group reflecting invasive infection, in comparison with mean 5% drop in selenium group.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common carcinomas observed in humans. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce carcinogenesis via DNA injury. Enzymatic parameters as part of the antioxidant defense system participate in cell protection against harmful influence of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to assess the levels of final lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in colorectal cancer. Moreover, we analysed the activity of main antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Investigations were conducted in 35 primary colorectal cancers. As a control, the same amount of sample was collected from macroscopically unchanged colon regions of the most distant location to the cancer. Sample was also collected from the closest healthy tissue surrounding cancer. Homogenisation of specimens provided 10% homogenates for our evaluations. Activity of antioxidant enzymes and level of MDA and AOPP were determined by spectrophotometry. Our studies demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the level of lipid peroxidation products (MDA) compared with control (p < 0.001), and also increase in surrounding tissue level of MDA compared with control p < 0.05). Level of AOPP was statistically significantly increased compared with control (p < 0.001), as well as level od AOPP of surrounding tissue compared with control (p < 0.01).Activities of SOD and CAT were decreased compared with control (p < 0.01). Still there were no statistical difference between activities of these enzymes in surrounding tissue compared to control.

Many insecticides such as diazinon (DZN) are hydrophobic molecules, which bind extensively to biological membranes, especially to the phospholipids bilayers. Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant and is known to protect cellular membranes and lipoproteins from peroxidation. The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of DZN and the protective role of vitamin E on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes of rat liver. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups including: control (corn oil as diazinon solvent), DZN group (100 mg/kg, i.p.), vitamin E (150 mg/kg, i.p.) group and vitamin E -DZN group. 24 hours after injection, animal to ether anesthesia and liver removed. After liver tissue hemogenation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, as well as GSH and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined by biochemical methods. The result showed that DZN decreased GSH level in liver, however, vitamin E-DZN pretreated rats showed increased GSH content. The increased SOD and CAT activities and MDA level in DZN treated rats as compared with control appears to be a response towards increased oxidative stress. Vitamin E pretreated animals showed a lowering in these parameters as compared to DZN-treated rats which indicate that vitamin E provide protec-tion against DZN-induced oxidative stress. The data suggest that vitamin E may amelierate DZN-induced oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation and altering antioxidant defense system in liver.",

The reactive alpha-dicarbonyl compounds (e.g. methylglyoxal, MGO) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed. Alpha-dicarbonyls cause protein cross-linking and formation of AGEs mainly on intracellular proteins, which usually lose their biological activity and may persist in tissues. We suppose that activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (e.g. glutathione S-transferases or cytochrome P450) may be modified by glycation in vivo. Formation of AGEs may be slowed down by compounds with antioxidant activity such as green tea catechins. The effect of MGO on a viability of primary rat hepatocytes and activities of selected xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes as well as antiglycation activity of catechin gallate (Cg) and gallocatechin gallate (GCg) were studied.

The spots were excised in order to identify the deregulated protein species by mass spectrometry analysis. The protein data set will be analyzed in the frame of metabolic networks to identify the most differentially altered cellular pathways. Defining altered protein profiles could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for MMA. During recent years, increased efforts have focused on elucidating the pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells. Differentiation towards the different lineages has attracted significant attention given the potential use of stem cells in regenerative medicine. Embryonic stem cell differentiation is a complex process coordinated by strictly regulated extracellular signals that act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. Through secreted molecules, stem cells affect local niche biology and influence the cross-talking with the surrounding tissues. Emerging evidences support the hypothesis that fundamental cell functions, including proliferation and differentiation, are strictly regulated by the complex set of molecules secreted from cells. The understanding of this molecular language could largely increase our knowledge on pathways regulating stem cell differentiation. Here we have used a proteomics platform to investigate the profile of proteins secreted during differentiation of murine Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs). We have followed the dynamics of protein secretion by comparing the secretomes at different time points of mESC cardiac and neural differentiation. In addition to previously reported molecules, we have identified many secreted proteins not described so far as released from embryonic stem cells. By comparing the secretome of mESCs induced to differentiate toward cardiomyocites and neurons, respectively, we were able to identify different classes of secreted proteins which are potentially involved in cardiac and/or neuronal stem cell commitment. Interestingly, different members of the TGFb Nodal pathway came out in our proteomic analysis including two well known Nodal antagonists (i.e. Cerberus and Lefty-1).

In kidney samples, we found that OTA was able to induce GSH and MDA increase, a decrease of lysosomal membrane stability, a gain in lipofuscin content and DNA damage. Wine administration had a cytoprotective effect on all parameters. A total of 69 proteins were differentially expressed with prevalence of anti-oxidant proteins (HSPs, peroxiredoxins and GSH-related proteins), proteins involved in energy metabolism and cytoskeletal proteins such as tropomyosin and vinculin.

Although the initial engagement of microglia seems to play a neuroprotective role, many lines of evidence indicate that a persistent activation with the production of pro-inflammatory molecules contribute to dismantle neuronal activity and to induce neuronal loss occurring in neurodegenerative diseases. To date, limited proteomic data are available on activated microglial cells in response to extracellular amyloidogenic peptides.

The disease encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from simple cutaneous lesions, which may heal spontaneously, to mucosal lesions, a hyperergic invasive and destructive form of leishmaniasis. It has been suggested that the disease phenotype may be related to both the host immune response and parasite protein expression. During the first steps of infection, Leishmania faces up diverse structures with distinct dimensions such as the thin layer of basal membrane and the complex tridimensional structure of the interstitial space around tissues. The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays fundamental roles during cell migration, signaling, gene expression, and cell differentiation and proliferation. In addition, ECM has a key role in pathogenic processes. In this study we analyzed the mechanical features and secreted protein profile during the interaction of mucosal and disseminated isolates with two-dimensional (2D) and 3D collagen matrices. These isolates were chosen as they reproduce the clinical manifestations in the macaque model of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Scanning electron microscopy showed that both isolates damage and remodel the collagen matrix fibers. However, mucosal and disseminated isolates differentially interact and invade the 3D matrix, exhibiting different mechanical features during the interaction. Zymographic analysis reveled that metallopeptidases are secreted during the invasion and interaction of parasites with 2D and 3D matrices. Finally, proteins secreted to extracellular medium were identified by mass spectrometry, revealing that several functional groups of proteins, including peptidases from cysteine-and metallo-classes, are secreted during the interaction of parasites with collagen fibers. These results indicate that such enzymes could be involved in the remodeling and/or damage of the matrix. Oxidative DNA damages count among the most involved lesions in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases or ageing (1). These damages result mainly from the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coming from cellular metabolism or exogenous agents and leading to various types of lesions among which the oxidation of bases (8-oxoG) or formation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (2) . These lesions are specifically taken care of by base excision DNA repair mechanism or BER, which itself is initiated by the action of a DNA glycosylase, such as the 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylase (Ogg1) (3) . Knowing the importance of this enzyme in the initiation of BER and thus in the maintenance of genome integrity, it was important to determine its various proteomic partners. A yeast two-hybrid screen allowed the identification of gene Pol2, coding for the catalytic subunit of replicative DNA polymerase e (Pol2). A second screen allowed identifying the interaction domain of Pol2 within the 3' to 5' exonuclease domain (N-terminal part of the catalytic subunit). Similarly, the two N-and Cterminal regions of yOgg1 may be involved in the interaction. These results were confirmed by pull down experiments, showing a physical interaction between the two yeast partners, yOgg1 and yPol2 fragment. Being given the genetic and biochemical studies involving Pole in BER (4, 5) , such a physical interaction would make it possible to couple BER with Pole-dependent replication, Pol2 targeting yOgg1 to the damage during DNA replication. yOgg1 could thus work just upstream of the replication fork or have a post-replicative action repairing the 8-oxoG/C pairs newly formed by the DNA polymerase. In both cases, this physical interaction is clearly in favour of a close cooperation between DNA repair and replication in order to maintain the genome stability.",

Also, supernatants from five primary cultures obtained out of the toumoral samples were analysed together with the glioblastoma cell line U87. An astrocyte enriched culture obtained from normal brain tissue was used as control. Indirect immunofluorescence for EGFR and VEGFR2 was performed on the glioblastoma cultures. Our results revealed increased serum levels of EGFR and VEG-FR2 in glioblastoma samples versus control, with a significant difference for EGFR. However, mean values for sIL-2Ra were lower in samples from glioblastoma patients than in controls. Also supernatants of the cell cultures showed modified levels of sEGFR and sVEGFR2, with similar pattern as serum. Immunofluorescence illustrated high expression of membrane receptors for EGF and VEGF. Multiplex xMAP technology enabled the simultaneous quantitation of serum levels for several relevant molecules in glioblastomas.

Missense mutations, localized in both DNA ligase I alleles, have been observed in a patient with a rare disorder, the DNA ligase I deficiency syndrome, characterized by immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sun sensitivity. We present the first contribution of a comprehensive proteome profile of cultured human skin fibroblasts (46BR.1G1 cells) established from this patient. 2-DE (in the 3-10 and 4-7 pH ranges) was the separation technique used for production of maps, with particular attention to the generation of the best profiles in terms of resolution and of reproducibility. MALDI-TOF/MS and LC-MS/MS were the mass spectrometry platforms applied for identification of proteins in gel spots. 220 of about 285 spots analyzed, produced MS signals of excellent quality and relative proteins could be confidently attributed. 197 out of 220 gel spots analyzed (90%) contained a single protein thus confirming that, with a few exceptions, spot overlap was minimized. A total of 154 proteins, including 41 never detected before in skin fibroblasts with this approach, were identified in gel spots analyzed. The procedure also allowed to identify spots which displayed reactivity against anti-Lig I antibody. This newly generated extensive database provides for the first time a global picture of abundant proteins in 46BR.1G1 skin fibroblasts.

IGF-I is the main effector for the action of the growth hormone; IGF-I has effects on carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism in many cell types. DHT is responsible of the androgenic effect of testosterone and is more potent than its precursor because of the increased affinity to the androgen receptor (AR). Several preclinical studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between tumorigenesis and IGF-I or DHT abuse (1, 2) . We have recently demonstrated that high doses of DHT activate the drug detoxification process, stimulate cell motility and exert a prosurvival effect in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (3) .

In this study we investigated the cortex membrane protein expressions of genetic rat model of absence epilepsy ''Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS)'' with proteomic technology. For this purpose, cortex region were dissected from GAERS (n = 5) and non-epileptic control (n = 5) rat brains.

Spots that showed significantly different level of expression between control and GAERS groups were detected by 2D electrophoresis analysis software. These protein spots were excised and identified by mass analysis and compared to protein data base. The vesicular trafficking inside eukaryotic cells is a highly regulated process that requires specificity at each transport step.

Our studies focused on the endocytic pathway of human milk lactoferrin in macrophagelike THP-1cells.

Many aspects of centriolar structure, function, duplication and cilia formation still remain poorly understood. Identification of centriole and ciliary regulators is essential to enhance our understanding of human genetic diseases caused by centrosome and ciliary dysfunction. Previous work implicated the motor protein KICF5A and its interacting nucleotide-binding proteins Nubp1 and Nubp2 in a regulatory pathway that controls centriole duplication. Here, we extend our studies and show that the proteins KIFC5A, Nubp1 and Nubp2 share a common localization in mitotic cells. These proteins localize to the center of microtubule asters at the beginning of mitosis and to spindle microtubules in later mitotic phases. Interestingly, Nubp1 and Nubp2, but not KIFC5A, are detected on both centrioles in interphase cells. This localization is extended in quiescent cells where Nubp1 and Nubp2 are found on the basal body whereas KIFC5A is absent. Silencing experiments reveal that the recruitment of Nubp1 and Nubp2 to centrioles and basal bodies is independent of KIFC5A. Importantly, silencing experiments of KIFC5A and Nubp1 reveal different effects in cilia numbers. Conclusively our data suggest that, in addition to their role in centrosome reduplication control, KIFC5A, Nubp1 and Nubp2 are also implicated in the ciliogenesis pathway. Identification of proteins and mechanisms that regulate cilia assembly is crucial to accelerate our understanding towards the complexity of human ciliary diseases.",

The vesicles are discharged into the lumen by a pinching-off process, resulting in double-membrane vesicles (J Insect Physiol , 1999; 45: 29-37). For this process to occur, actin filaments should be polymerized and depolymerized. Here we describe the investigation on the role of midgut gelsolin in this process. The sequence of the cDNA coding for gelsolin was obtained from ESTs assembled as described in Ferreira et al. (J Insect Physiol , 2007; 53: 1112 -1124 , after Spodoptera frugiperda library screenings. Partial sequences were extended using specific primers with T7 and T3 universal primers and a midgut cDNA library as a template. The complete cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. Gelsolin mRNA is highly expressed along the midgut, lowly expressed in the Malpighian tubules and no expressed at all in the fat body and carcass (semiquantitative RT-PCR data). Interfering gelsolin RNA was injected into the insect haemolymph and suppressed the expression of gelsolin 3 days after injection, with no changes in larval weight or mortality. No suppression was observed when nuclease free water or interfering RNA coding for a heterologous green fluorescent protein were injected. Inspection by transmission electron microscopy of midgut columnar cells where gelsolin expression was suppressed revealed flattened structures at the microvillar base, near the terminal web. These structures are absent from control animals and probably correspond to vesicles that could not migrate through the microfilaments present inside the microvilli. The data support a role for gelsolin in the secretion process. Supported by FAPESP, CAPES, CNPq and INCT-Entomologia Molecular.",

The mRNAs of these isoforms have different sizes (1.6 kb, 1.2 kb and 1.1 kb) and are products of differential splicing. They encode three distinct but highly similar isoforms, that exhibit an ATP/GTP binding motif A (P-loop). A LiSH domain is present in the largest isoform but absent in the other two isoforms. Differential expression studies by RT-PCR revealed that the two largest isoforms are widely expressed across many of the mouse tissues examined, however their pattern of expression is distinctly different. The expression of the smallest isoform is more restricted with notable enrichment in the hippocampus. The expression of the larger isoforms appears to be developmentally regulated in the mouse embryo.",

Here we demonstrated that fully processed plasma membrane-associated Hex and Gal co-distribute with the raft marker flotillin-2 after fractionation by continuous sucrose-density gradient. Jurkat cell stimulation upregulates the expression of lysosomal Hex and Gal and leads their targeting to lipid microdomains. After de novo synthesis, Hex and Gal, like the other lysosomal proteins, are delivered from TGN to lysosomes, where they undergo to the final proteolytic processing. Therefore the presence of these glycohydrolases in a fully processed form on lipid microdomains suggests that they are first targeted to the lysosomes and then to the cell surface, probably by a fusion event of the lysosomal membrane with the plasma membrane. Results provide evidence that the glycohydrolases Hex and Gal are not randomly distributed in the external leaflet of the plasma membrane but they localise in close proximity to their natural substrates and products. Based on these results, it can be hypothesized that changes of glycosphingolipid structures at the plasma membrane domains level could happen directly in situ in a very fast way, without involvement of the complex metabolic machinery determining glycosphingolipids plasma membrane rearrangement. NCLDV comprise an heterogeneous group of viruses, characterized by large genomes and infecting several types of eukaryotic cells. Members of this group, in particular Chloroviruses and Mimivirus, probably encode at least in part, if not all, the machinery required to glycosylate their structural proteins. This property differs from that of most viruses, which use the host ER/Golgi system for glycoprotein production and whose glycan structures are dependent on their host cells. Several viral proteins involved in glycoconjugate formation have been already identified, including enzymes for nucleotide-sugar and hyaluronan synthesis and glycosyltransferases. To better characterize viral glycoconjugates, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of monosaccharide composition of six Chlorella viruses, which infect green unicellular algae, and of the giant Mimivirus, which infects free-living Achantamoeba species. Results from Chloroviruses showed that viruses infecting the same host have significant differences in glycan composition, further confirming that glycosylation of their proteins is host-independent. Analyses of Mimivirus indicated that the majority of sugars is associated to the long fibers which cover the viral particles. These glycan structures probably contribute to the Gram positive stain displayed by these virions. Identification of the constituent monosaccharides represented the first step for the further structural characterization of viral glycans. Moreover, it has allowed us to identify other virally encoded enzymes, which are involved in modified sugar production and which are currently under study in our laboratories. Studies on the enzymes involved in glycoconjugate production encoded by NCLDVs could provide important insights not only about their role in viral life cycles, but also, due to the long evolutionary history of these viruses, about the relationships with bacterial glycans and with the evolution of the eukaryotic glycosylation machinery.",

The human cytosolic sialidase NEU2 is the only structurally characterized mammalian enzyme and represents a valuable model to study the specificity of the viral (NA) inhibitory drugs as well as to characterize the molecular basis of the natural substrate recognition by the members of this class of enzyme in mammals. In this perspective we have carried out a study of molecular docking of NEU2 active site using natural substrates of increasing complexity. The study was conducted with a preliminary molecular docking approach and validated with the selective mutation of the residues putatively involved in interaction. Recombinant enzymes were tested for their catalytic activity and substrate specificity. We show that E218 and Q270 are involved in the binding of the disaccharide a2,3-sialyl-galactose, whereas K45 and Q112 binds the distal glucose of the trisaccharide a2,3sialyl-lactose, corresponding to the oligosaccharide moiety of the ganglioside GM3. Interestingly, the major effects detectable on the enzyme activity of recombinant NEU2 mutants are associated to residue(s) possibly involved in the recognition of the terminal sialic acid, whereas the others reveal their relevance only in double mutants. This approach will be used to study the recognition of more complex substrates as well as the relative relevance of the sialoside bond (i.e. a2,3 versus a2,6 and a2,8).",

Although inactivation of all three EDEMs activated the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), we found that single inactivation of EDEM genes in the absence of ER stress did not have a dramatic effect on worm viability. Moreover, our genetic interactions suggested a tight regulation between EDEM 1-3 functions to maintain ER homeostasy upon ER stress.",

Interestingly, such a genome sequence set includes not previously classified, echinoderm-specific, TRIM genes as well as multiple copies of known ones. In both cases, the deduced protein sequences show overall similarity with a number of vertebrate TRIMs. Among them, we isolated Strim1, the first echinoderm TRIM-containing factor whose functional role has been characterized during development. Strim1 groups with the subfamily C-V of human TRIMs, showing no additional conserved domains in the C-terminal region. Of particular interest, we demonstrated elsewhere that Strim1 is involved in the regulation of the embryonic skeletogenesis, in the Mediterranean sea urchin species Paracentrotus lividus. By a in silico approach we identified a locus containing two copies of the strim1 gene, and in each copy we predicted regions of sequence identity to the transposable element Helitron-N2 (HeN2). In particular, HeN2 elements lie within the putative promoter regions of these strim1 gene copies, and consist of a unique 5' palindromic sequence followed by eleven tandemly arranged 155bp-long direct repeats and a unique 3' palindromic sequence. It is known that Helitrons constitute 1% of the sea urchin genome and are a formidable evolutionary tool owing to their ability to capture host genes.

However, before using ESCs for therapeutic purposes, such as transplantation and tissue regeneration, it will be essential to improve our ability to modulate and control ESC differentiation into lineage-specific derivatives. In this context, our main aim is to identify and characterize molecules able to control embryonic stem cell differentiation. To achieve this goal we have developed an in vitro system based on the RNA interference technology. By using this approach we have identified many factors strictly required for proper neuronal differentiation. Among them we have found a membrane protein that we have named Dies1. Dies1 suppression blocks ESC differentiation by maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated state. We have demonstrated that this protein is required to allow neuronal differentiation by participating to the signaling pathway of BMP4 that plays a crucial role in the balance between ESC stemness and differentiation. Indeed, Dies1 suppression induces an impairment of BMP4 signalling and on the other hand it induces an up-regulation of Nodal/Activin targets. Thus, Dies1 seems to be responsible for the balance between BMP4 and Nodal pathways in the decision of ESC fate. We have demonstrated a direct interaction between BMP4 receptor complex and Dies1 by means of site-direct mutagenesis followed by FRET microscopy and biochemical approaches. Moreover, we are characterizing the regulation of Dies1 in ESCs. Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR), a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporter proteins, is a heme exporter that has a crucial role in erythropoiesis. Consistently, FLVCR-null mice lack definitive erythropoiesis and die at midgestation. In addition, they have craniofacial and limb deformities resembling those of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The FLVCR gene is present in the zebrafish suggesting a conserved role during evolution. Moreover, FLVCR is expressed in developing zebrafish embryos: eggs are supplied with a maternal FLVCR transcript and the fetal one starts to be synthesized at 8 hours postfertilization. To investigate in detail the role of FLVCR during development, we knocked-down its expression in zebrafish with an antisense morpholino targeting the ATG start codon of the transcript. FLVCR morphants died within 5 days postfertilization. The morphants showed craniofacial cartilage malformations, severe vascular abnormalities, extended hemorrhages and a deficiency of circulating red blood cells. Vascular defects are characterized by abnormal branching and formation of intersegmental vessels. As endothelial cells are highly sensitive to the toxic effects of heme, our hypothesis is that the lack of a heme exporter during endothelial development may results in heme excess affecting cell survival and maintenance. Moreover, the deficiency of circulating red blood cells together with the observation that heme level in FLVCR morphants is strongly reduced compared to controls suggest a defect in erythropoiesis. Analysis of erythropoiesis by in situ hybridization with specific probes is currently under investigation as well as the characterization of vascular abnormalities. These data demonstrate a crucial and conserved role for FLVCR in skeletal formation and highlight a previously unappreciated function for this protein in the development of blood vessels and maintenance of vascular integrity. Metamorphic processes in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis depend on a complex interplay of events, including a caspase-dependent apoptosis, which has recently been shown to be regulated by the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP signaling pathway. Basic features of the regulatory role of NO included a correlation between endogenous NO levels, tail regression and caspase activity, as well as a very dynamic spatial expression pattern of NO and NO synthase (NOS) during larval development and metamorphosis. We provide now evidence that NO regulates Ciona metamorphosis via a complex balance of signaling pathways that are critically dependent on local redox control and temporal changes of reactive oxygen species production. The data demonstrate that NOS inhibitors along with scavengers of peroxynitrite and NO 2 , two key NO-derived nitrative agents involved in protein nitration, markedly decrease the rate of Ciona metamorphosis. On the contrary, a NO donor as well peroxynitrite result in acceleration of the process. Increased protein nitration was observed at the late larvae stage, when larvae are competent, and proteomic methodologies identified nitrated tyrosine residues in ERK and snail. Exposure of larvae to NO resulted in a marked decrease in ERK phosphorylation. Overall, these and the previous results point to a dual mechanism of NO regulation during metamorphosis in Ciona operating on different time frames and with different outcomes. Oxidative stress and elevated ROS production emerge as a means of diverting NO signaling toward long-term effects in Ciona development that are mediated by protein tyrosine nitration and the associated modulation of phosphorylation-activated processes. Generally, it is accepted that hibernation is realized by the double effect of internal rhythm and external factors, and mammalian hibernation is characterized by prolonged torpor bouts interspersed by brief arousal periods. In this study hibernation pattern and changes in the body weight of Dryomys laniger, kept in uncontrolled conditions were investigated. When the ambient temperature reached 16\u00b0C, it was observed that, D. laniger stopped food intake. It was determined that D. laniger entered hibernation on November 6 when its body weight was 37 g and the ambient temperature was below 16\u00b0C, which seem to be the critical values for entering hibernation. Although body weight has an important role in entering hibernation at the beginning of the hibernation season, Anatolian dormouse hibernated as the hibernation season was in progress regardless of their body weight. Anatolian dormouse (Dryomys laniger) did not remain torpid continuously throughout heterothermal period, but spontaneously aroused and re-entered torpor at frequent interval sundered laboratory conditions. These torpor periods which took 2 or 3 days were short at the beginning of the heterothermal period and increased to 6-7 days, stayed more or less stable until they shortened again to 2-3 days towards the end of the heterothermal period. Sialidases are enzymes that catalyze the removal of terminally linked sialic acid residues from glycoconjugates. In mammals four different sialidases, known to be involved in several relevant processes such as lysosomal catabolism, regulation of cell adhesion, growth, differentiation, apoptosis and tumor transformation, have been cloned. In this study we focus our attention on NEU4 the second membrane linked enzyme of the group. Human and murine proteins are expressed in two isoforms. In particular murine NEU4 have been hypothesized to be involved, together with NEU3, in neural development and plasticity as well as in neurite formation. We used Danio rerio as animal model to further investigate the biological role of NEU4. Through in silico analysis we identified an ortholog gene in Zebrafish, named neu4. This gene is expressed from 8 hpf to the adult organism; in situ hybridizations show a peculiar expression within the marginal zone of the brain ventricle, starting from 24 hpf, while, starting from 48 hpf, the embryo labelling is restricted to the lens. RT-PCR demonstrates an almost ubiquitous expression in all tested organs, with highest levels detectable in brain, liver and kidney. Knock-down experiments have been carried out using spliceinhibiting Morpholinos (MO). A preliminary characterization of 24-hpf-old neu4 morphants shows reduced cranial dimension and significant CNS disorganization, mainly involving the hindbrain and midbrain/hindbrain boundary and ventricular zone. Starting from 30 hpf Tg(kdr:EFGP) neu4 MO-injected embryos reveal alteration in cranial vascularization and in the organization of intesegmental vessels. We are currently performing further knock-down experiments using different splicing-inhibiting MO in order to confirm the observed developmental defects.",

Over-expression of the adaptor protein p130Cas in the mammary gland results in extensive mammary epithelial hyperplasia during pregnancy and delayed involution at the end of lactation, due to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. To further address the function of p130Cas during mammary gland branching morphogenesis, 3D organotypic cultures from MMTV-p130Cas tg and wt primary mammary epithelial cells were used. We show that p130Cas over-expression in mammary epithelia leads to a significant increase in branching morphogenesis induced by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) that correlates with elevated levels of Erk1/2 MAPK activation. Concomitant addition of estradiol (E2), an important mitogen during mammary gland development, results in further increase in Erk1/2 activation and Akt phosphorylation in p130Cas tg-derived organoids. Surprisingly, E2 treatment also significantly affects EGF-mediated branching of p130Cas tg organoids, leading to multicellular structures with altered apoptotic levels. Cell treatment with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI rescues branching morphogenesis, indicating that p130Cas over-expression alters E2 responsiveness in mammary epithelial cells. These findings provide for the first time evidence that p130Cas plays an important role during mammary gland development, increasing branching morphogenesis in concert with EGF and Erk1/2 activation. In addition, high levels of p130Cas also disrupts downstream E2 signaling leading to increased cell survival.",

Distribution of these hormone receptors was examined in fallopian tube tissue samples of young (22 days), prepubertal (4 weeks), adult (10 weeks), premenopausal (8 months) and old (24 months) female rats via indirect immunohistochemical methods. Follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSH-R) and progesterone receptor (PR) immunostainings were observable at surface of epithelium and in nucleus of cells for all developmental stages, respectively. However, estrogen receptor (ER) immunostaining was markedly present in apical cytoplasm of epithelial cells at the early stage of development. In the light of overall results, significant ER, PR and FSH-R immunostainings were observered in fallopian tubes of adult rats with a decrease in older age groups. Differential distribution in immunostaining of these hormon receptors was revealed to be associated with functions of these hormones in sexual development and variations in reproductive productivity during ageing. Neuronal differentiation is a crucial event in the regeneration of nervous tissues and adhesion on a substrate is critical for neurite extension. The initiation and guidance of a neurite rely on extra-cellular signals, such as substrate energy of adhesion. Therefore it is of great interest to unveil the substrates characteristics that are sensed by the growth cone and translated into neurite extension.",

It has been revealed that nickel can be found as a cofactor of several enzymes in various organisms. However, the overexposure to nickel makes it very cytotoxic and carcinogenic through the formation of damaging oxygen radical. A defect in uptake mechanism or endogenous accumulation of nickel can result in imbalance between the requirement for nickel ions and the damage caused by its reactivity. During the last century, exposure to nickel compounds and alloys has been increased due to industrial developments. However, the nickel resistance mechanism in yeast is not yet fully understood. The aim of this research was to obtain nickel-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains by evolutionary engineering approach and to analyze those possible changes on gene and/or protein level of the mutants which confer the nickel-resistant phenotype. Evolutionary engineering is a significant strategy successfully used for strain improvement. This technique is based on applying selective pressure in order to obtain desired phenotypes. A chemically mutagenized S.cerevisiae culture was used as the starting population to create genetic diversity. First nickel-resistant population was obtained by applying 0.05 mM NiCl 2 stress to this culture. Throughout the selection procedure, the stress level increased gradually from one population to the next one up to 5.3 mM NiCl 2 stress level at the final 94th population. Individual mutants were randomly selected from final mutant population, and their resistance, in terms of percent survival, were determined using most probable number method. Additionally, characterization of the mutant individuals with respect to their cross-resistances to different metal and non-metal stresses is in progress.",

The DNA fraction was exposed to certain concentration of chromium oxide Cr (VI) for 45 minutes at room temperature and analyzed employing UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as thermal denaturation techniques. The results showed that the binding of chromium to DNA reduced the absorbances at 260 and 350 nm (k max of metal) producing hypochromicity. The fluorescence emission intensity was also gradually decreased upon increasing metal concentration, indicating that DNA chromophores quenched upon binding to metal. Moreover, binding of metal induced very high hypochromicity and shifted DNA melting temperature to higher values. From the results it is suggested that chromium oxide binds to DNA and induces structural changes such as DNA compaction. The interaction is mainly occurred through DNA base pares and stacking of bases is influenced by metal action.

In the experiment, we revealed a high content of strontium ions in patients with coronary heart disease and the presence of carriers of cytomegalovirus infection. A total of two experiments were performed, for each one we selected a group of patients. The first group of donors was selected thoroughly for the presence of serum antibodies only for CMV, in particular, to exclude those patients with detected antibodies to the herpes viruses, data samples were collected over a long time. The second donor group was selected on the rising titer of antibodies to CMV, and it was a mixed group, which is not analyzed for the presence of herpes viruses. The test samples of this group were subjected to momentary research and they didn't store for long periods. Using the obtained data, the correlation fields were built -point chart to determine the form of correlation and its tightness.

Despite the recent discovery of a bacterium that is able to replace phosphorus by arsenate, opening new frontiers to life, it is a fact than either arsenate and arsenite are considered toxic to the majority of living organisms. Recently was reported that D. desulfuricans G20 possesses an arsenic resistance operon with following arrangement arsRBC2C3. This operon contains two different arsenate reductases (arsC2 and arsC3), that putatively convert intracellular As(V) to As(III), a membrane protein responsible for As(III) extrusion (arsB) and an As(III) inducible transcription regulator (arsR). This ars operon functions as a detoxification mechanism by lowering the intracellular arsenic concentration and confering high resistance to arsenate. Four enzymes involved in catalysis of arsenate: ArsC2, ArsC3, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, were heterologouly expressed in E. coli and purified with success. The molecular mass of the ArsC2 and ArsC3, 16.6 kDa and 16.0 kDa respectively, was accessed using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the aggregation state was determined by gel filtratrion. Both arsenate reductases are monomers and by aminoacid sequence analysis thioredoxin is the putative cofactor. Kinetic measurements for the two ArsC present in the arsRBC2C3 operon were performed to test possible cofactors and address the function in resistance of the two arsenate reductases independently. The kinetic parameters determined, such as V max , k cat and K iu , will be compared for other arsenate reductases described in literature. We also perfomed phosphatase activity measurements for these ArsC. Complementation arsenic resistance assays in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain were performed for both arsenate reductases. Only ArsC3 is able to confer resistance to arsenate in E. coli cells allowing bacteria to grow until 20 mM of arsenate.",

Lead exposure of human can result in a wide range of biological effects depending upon the level and duration. The toxicity results from the continuous and excessive exposure of lead poses a huge risk factor for health. In adults, lead toxicity is most commonly caused by occupational workspace. Especially after oral way exposure to toxic metals are derived from gastrointestinal tract. In the duodenum divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1) protein plays a crucial role for dietary Fe uptake but also recognizes nonessential metals such as Pb. The intention of this study was to determine whether DMT1 IVS4+44C/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has an effect on Pb and Fe levels in blood samples of Turkish metallurgical industry workers. For this purpose blood samples were obtained from 84 male workers and samples were studied by standard PCR-RFLP technique. Pb The environmental impact of nanomaterials is expected to increase substantially in the near future as they are becoming a part of our daily life. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are widely used in the form of cosmetics, food packaging, drug delivery systems, therapeutics, antimicrobial agents, biosensors, or labels. Manufactured nanoparticles can be toxic via interactions with proteins and enzymes. Nanoparticles are known to be able to interfere with cellular metabolism and to cause cytotoxicity and moreover may interfere with specific cellular functions. We studied interaction of AgNP with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and related butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Both cholinesterases are present in brain, blood and nervous system. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key enzyme in cholinergic neurotransmission and inhibition of AChE may lead to fatal outcome. BChE has important pharmacological and toxicological roles due to its hydrolysis of various xenobiotics. We have evaluated the ChE inhibition by AgNPs prepared using reduction methods of silver nitrate with trisodium citrate (AgNPcitrate), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (AgNP-chloride) and sodium borohydride in presence of polyvinyl alcohol (AgNP-PVA). All tested AgNPs inhibited ChEs and the evaluated apparent inhibitor constants ranged from 49 lM to 670 lM. In the case of AChE the inhibition potency increased in the following order: AgNP-PVA < AgNP-citrate < AgNP-chloride, while in the case of BChE the inhibition potency increased in the following order: AgNP-citrate < AgNP-PVA < AgNP-chloride. The impact of AgNP on ChE activity depends greatly on the nature of the nanomaterial coatings. It is also interesting that AgNP showed higher affinity for AChE, than for BChE.

The expression system chosen for Ig-pCons protein production was a mammalian cell line, the Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells. In order to obtain a quantity of Ig-pCons protein in short times, we adopted transient transfection of HEK293 cells with a plasmid encoding Ig-pCons containing a IgG secretion sequence. HEK293 cells were cultured in adhesion in a medium supplemented with 10% ultra low IgG serum. The expression of Ig-pCons protein was monitored and quantified in supernatants of HEK293 cells culture, at various increasing intervals of time after transfection. Depending on the higher concentrations of Ig-pCons protein obtained, the times to harvest supernatants were selected. Strategies to increase Ig-pCons protein production were also studied: they included the addition of sodium butyrate and/or a cocktail of protease inhibitors in the HEK293 cells culture medium. Concentration of Ig-pCons protein increased almost 6-fold when HEK293 cells were cultured in presence of 2 mM sodium butyrate and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. A N-terminal aminoacid sequencing of protein produced confirmed the correct pCons sequence.

Among the various analytical parameters measured in blood, we have introduced the fast and slow myosins as monitoring the development of chronic and acute muscle injuries that occur in fast and slow -twitch fibers and they have been compared with the creatine kinase muscle marker. 31 football players participate in the study. They were from a Spanish 1st division soccer team. They followed the usual protocol to monitor 6 periodic reviews during the season. 1 ml of blood was obtained in every review. Immediately, blood was centrifuged and the serum was used. Serum was concentrated with G protein and detection of fast and slow isoforms of myosin was done by Western blot technique, using commercial fast and slow myosin antibodies (Sigma). Creatine kinase (CK) was determined by an authomatized spectrophotometer method. The values found in these parameters were related with the workloads the team followed during the season. The results show high fast and slow myosins before the season, only surpass by the beginning of the season. Both myosins decreased during the racing season. The individual player analysis shows slight differences in their maximum value of muscle injury during the season. The relationship between fast and slow is kept between 0.5 and 0.9 and it indicates that any important injury appears in fast fibers during the competitive period. Only some players showed important lesions characterized by high levels of both myosins. The creatine kinase activity do not relate well with those of myosin. We conclude that the workload Imposed on the players as training together with the competition matches produced a very low degree of injury in the squad of players. It is shown that the information provided by CK and myosin differs in interpretation of results. Project financed by MAPFRE Foundation (SV-07-MAPFRE-SALUD).",

Moreover, immunomagnetically separated CD14+ cells (monocytes) have higher levels of proteasomal activity compared to CD14-cells. Both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells from patients with MDS have higher levels of activity compared to the same cell populations from age-matched individuals and have approximately the same activity as cells from young healthy donors. Concluding, contrary to marrow cells, blood cell populations from patients with MDS possess higher levels of proteasomal activity compared to the same cell populations from healthy individuals of the same age and blood cell populations possess different proteasome activity in both patients and healthy individuals.",

In vitro antimicrobial tests were carried out by an agar-disk diffusion technique using a bacterial suspension of 0.5 McFarland density. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds (1 mg/ml) solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was determined against the following strains: Salmonella arizonae 23, Proteus vulgaris 12, Morganella morganii 2, Klebsiella planticola 8, Escherichia coli 13147, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1246, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 1268. A quantitative assay was performed to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC, lg/ml). The qualitative screening of the newly synthesized compounds showed low diameter inhibition zones. The quantitative assay revealed that out of the eight tested compounds, six exhibited MIC values lower than DMSO control on Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (62.5 lg/ml). The intensity of the antimicrobial activity was not influenced by the presence of a second halogenated substituent, demonstrating that the -CF3 group is essential for the antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative tested strains. The 2-F, 4-CF3 and the 2-F, 5-CF3 disubstituted derivatives exhibited anti-Staphylococcus activity, superior to DMSO. For the other tested strains, the activity of the compounds was similar to that of the solvent. The -CF3 substituted compounds could be considered for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs against multi-drug resistant strains of Gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus, frequently implicated in the etiology of opportunistic infections. Stable biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles have demonstrated their potential in targeting biologically active molecules -including hormones, allergens, and various peptides -to specific cells or tissues expressing their cognate receptors, and may represent versatile and non-invasive tools for monitoring cellular functions both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, betalactoglobulin, one of the major whey proteins and food allergens, was covalently conjugated to biocompatible dextran-coated magnetic nanoparticles. The conjugated protein retained its structure and immunoreactivity towards monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. BLG-conjugated nanoparticles were taken up by human monocytes much more efficiently than non-conjugated particles, allowing easy magnetic separation of cells that had adsorbed the allergen. To verify whether this approach could be complemented with others for improving our current understanding of the intracellular and intratissutal path of food allergens, BLG was conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles also labeled with a fluorescent probe. The uptake of these materials by human monocytes was monitored through flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, in comparison with fluorescent nanoparticles devoid of the allergen or conjugated with human serum albumin. Both approaches confirm a higher uptake of the BLG-conjugated particles, and confocal microscopy provided direct evidence of actual internalization of the particles into the cytoplasm. These results open up the possibility to use a combination of these approaches for monitoring the fate of food allergens in cells that may be involved in the immune response to food.",

STAT3 is a major transcription factor for haptoglobin gene expression, and augments hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). In this study, we investigated whether HIF-1a participates in the haptoglobin gene expression. HIF-1a-overexpression by gene-transfection or hypoxia increased haptoglobin level in HepG2 human hepatoma cells. Conversely, HIF-1a was knocked down by specific siRNA transfection, haptoglobin was significantly decreased at both the levels of mRNA and protein, without a change in STAT3 phosphorylation. For the HIF-1a-stimulated transactivation of the gene, adjacent two DNA elements, a STAT3-binding element (SBE) and a cyclic AMP-response element (CRE)-like site in human haptoglobin gene promoter (-120/-97) were required. Although there was no hypoxia response element for HIF-1a binding in the promoter region, HIF-1a could be bound to the SBE/CRE as a complex form with STAT3 and p300/CBP. Knockdown of HIF-1a attenuated STAT3 binding to the SBE in the promoter. These findings suggest that HIF-1a assists STAT3 in strong binding to the SBE in IL-6 response element of haptoglobin gene promoter. CRE-like site located near the SBE may contribute to the formation of stable complex of STAT3, HIF-1a, and p300/CBP, which leads to maximum transcription of the haptoglobin gene. In this study, polymer-ceramic nanocomposites and/or composites have been prepared by solution intercalation method using poly(methyl metacrylat) (PMMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA); characterizated; and investigated their biocompatibilities. The characterization of polymer/ceramic nanocomposites or/composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD); the interactions between ceramic and polymer by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR); and the thermal stability of polymer and nanocomposites and/or composites by thermogravimetry (TG) and differantial thermogravimetry (d[TG]). XRD results, FTIR-ATR and thermogravimetric analysises showed that HA ceramic was dramatically dispersed at nanoscale in the polymer matrix; the interaction with ceramic and polymer were occured between -OH groups of HA and carbonyl gruops of polymer and introduction of ceramic to the polymer matrix generally resulted in an increase in thermal properties, respectively.",

More recently, 'DNA barcoding', the survey of sequence diversity in a 648 bp segment of the mtDNA gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) has been proposed as a standard tool for species-level identifications of all animals. The present study builds on this work, producing and analyzing a large number of sequences of two mitochondrial markers: the COI and the left domain of mitochondrial control region (5'D-Loop) for an economically important species, the swordfish Xiphias gladius. Therefore a 683 bp segment of COI and a 404 bp of the 5'D-loop of 65 swordfish samples from different geographical sources (Atlantic, Indian Oceans and Mediterranean Sea) were amplified, sequenced and compared. The sequences obtained were aligned using Clu-stalX and Gblock. The Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic trees based on COI and 5'Dloop sequences allowed us to correlate the swordfish haplotypes to different geographical stocks. The trees were built using pairwise distances (K2P) in MEGA v. 4.0. The robustness of internal branches of distance was estimated by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Similar results were obtained with both molecular markers. This analytical system was validated and subsequently applied to the discrimination of 15 unknown samples purchased from the market. The comparison of results obtained with COI and the 5'D-Loop, a well known marker of intraspecific variability, showed that, at least in X. gladius, COI is not only an efficient species-specific marker but unexpectedly has also the potential to assign geographical provenance and to reveal fraudulent substitution in commercial seafood products.

However, knowledge about cold induced molecular changes in human tissues and cells is very limited. Unique material for hypothermia research is gained from medico legal autopsies. Our aim is to identify molecular events specific to hypothermia deaths in the heart and other human tissues. We will focus mainly on gene expression studies in order to clarify mechanisms behind cold exposure/hypothermia. Immunohistochemical analyses, quantitative protein and transcript measurements are carried out in these studies. Molecular events in hypothermia, cardiac and non-cardiac deaths are compared. Thus our studies will highlight new aspects connected to cardiac and other diseases as well. Cold exposure activates sympathetic nervous system resulting e.g. in increased circulating catecholamine levels and actions on blood vessels. Endothelial cells of blood vessel walls seem to be sensitive to the effects of cold. We are studying these effects by monitoring both cellular and secretory forms of an endothelial transmembrane protein trombomodulin in the heart, blood and urine. Furthermore, cold contributes to function of cardiac myocytes modifying processes such as cell cycle and protein synthesis. Our target genes in these processes are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and elongation factor 2, respectively. Current results indicate differences both in cellular and secretory forms of trombomodulin between hypothermia, cardiac and non-cardiac deaths. In addition, myocardial p21 protein and elongation factor 2 transcript levels seem to be increased in hypothermia compared to other deaths.

Of note, while a PlexinB2 antibody was unable to block Sema4A-induced migration, the PlexinD1 antibody strongly inhibited the macrophage chemotactic response to Sema4A. Analyzing the effect of Sema4A on the expression of molecules regulating angiogenesis, we observed a significant induction of VEGF-A transcript and protein in Sema4A-treated macrophages. Remarkably, we observed a significant increase of endothelial cells migration in the presence of Sema4A-treated macrophages that was completely abrogated by the VEGF-A blocking antibody bevacizumab. To further assess the effect of Sema4A in inflammation, using a mouse model of thioglycollate-induced peritonitis, we observed a dramatic increase of Sema4A expression in CD68+ cells 48 hours after induction. Finally, to study the involvement of Sema4A on angiogenesis, tissue remodeling and inflammation in vivo we employed a cardiac ischemia/reperfusion mouse model. Interestingly we observed a strong increase of Sema4A expression in macrophages recruited in the ischemic injury. We conclude that Sema4A exerts a pro-angiogenic effect by inducing VEGF-A expression in macrophages and by regulating their recruitment and activation in the angiogenic and inflammatory processes.",

Further, the ''SPs-antigen/epitope'' complex was stabilized by formaldehyde fixation. The formation of complexes consisted of SPs and foreign antigens/epitopes was revealed by method of indirect immunofluorescence staining. Our data indicated that the whole surface of all SPs was involved in binding with molecules of recombinant proteins. It has been found that different foreign antigens/epitopes linked to the surface of SPs retained their antigenic activity and possess ability to react with corresponding primary antibodies. This fact indicates that the specificity of linked antigens/epitopes was not changed after their binding to the SPs surface. Therefore, these compositions could be regarded as promising candidates for the development of novel vaccines and means of diagnostics. The eggshell (chorion) proteins of the silkmoth Bombyx mori are produced exclusively in the epithelial cells that surround the developing oocyte. According to their temporal expression pattern, chorion genes are characterized as early, middle, or late. Chorion genes of the same developmental specificity are organized in divergently transcribed a/b gene pairs, sharing a common 5' flanking promoter region. The current model describing the developmental regulation of these genes implicates both ciselements, harbored in their common 5' flanking regions and their corresponding transcription factors (BmC/EBP, BmHMGA, BmCHD1, BmGATAb). In order to investigate the contribution of distinct cis-elements to temporal gene specificity, we developed an electroporation-based transient expression method for ex vivo developing follicles. Thus, upstream of the lacZ reporter gene, we have cloned the entire promoter sequence of different temporal specificity genes (5H4, 6F6.2 for early, A/B.L9, A/B.L1 for middle and Hc.12 for late stages) as positive controls, and also several differentially truncated A/B.L9 and A/B.L1 promoter regions, with the purpose of analysing single or composite cis-elements. Our present effort focused on the optimization of several parameters which affect the efficiency of epithelial cell transfection through the application of electric pulses on silkmoth follicles. These optimized conditions show that the method works, at least as far as positive and negative controls used. We will proceed to the analysis of the truncated and other constructs in an attempt to further elucidate the role of promoter modules in developmentally controlled gene expression but also to identify additional factors participating in chorion gene regulation.",

Using this technique, we developed the first transformation protocol for the saprobic aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii, a Blastocladiomycete localized at the base of fungal phylogenetic tree, which has been shown as a promising and interesting model of study of cellular function and differentiation. We constructed binary T-DNA vectors containing hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) genes, under the control of Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter and terminator sequences. 24 hours of co-cultivation in induction medium (IM) agar plates, followed by transfer to PYG-agar plates containing cefotaxim to kill A. tumefsciens and hygromycin to select transformants, resulted in growth and sporulation of resistant transformants. Genomic DNA from the pool o resistant zoospores showed to contain T-DNA insertion as evidenced by PCR amplification of hph gene. Using a similar protocol we could also evidence the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in zoospores derived from transformed cells. This protocol can also open new perspectives for other non-transformable closely related fungi, like the Chytridiomycete class. Rabies is a life-threatening disease caused by an RNA virus that is usually transmitted to humans through bites of rabid animals. In Europe, three genotypes of the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, are present, classical rabies virus (RABV, genotype 1), European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1, genotype 5) and European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2, genotype 6). The Lyssavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is the major component of the ribonucleoprotein complex that packs viral RNA. Due to the high level of amino acid (aa) sequence homology between N proteins of different genotypes, a broad cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against Lyssavirus N protein is observed. This fact allows the use of N protein-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for a direct detection of the virus in infected tissue and laboratory diagnostics of rabies. This study was aimed at investigating the immunodominant regions of RABV (CVS-11) N protein using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and recombinant yeast-expressed antigen self-assembled to nucleocapsid-like particles. Six MAbs against CVS-11 N protein were generated and their fine specificities were studied. Four MAbs were cross-reactive with RV1423 and RV1333 N proteins. The alignment of aa sequences of CVS-11, RV1423 and RV1333 N proteins revealed 86.6-87.7% sequence identity that explains the cross-reactivity of the MAbs. To localize the epitopes recognized by the MAbs, their interaction with two recombinant N protein fragments expressed in E.coli was investigated. The fragments corresponded to the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of N protein: aa 1-186 and 367-450, respectively. Four out of six MAbs recognized epitopes located between aa 1 and 186 of CVS-11 N protein, which suggests that the Nterminal region of CVS-11 N protein is immunodominant and induces antibody formation. These results are in line with recent structural data indicating the surface localization of the N-terminal region of Lyssavirus N protein.",

Usually, students examine ROS in mammalian tissues, with 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein or dihydroethidium. I propound qualitative/quantitative assay of O 2 \u2022 and H 2 O 2 in Aphididae. Superoxide anion is determined with the Nitro blue tetrazolium, yellow NBT+2 is reduced to deep blue NBT+. Fresh digestive system is treated with 5 mM Y-NBT, for 15 minutes and O2\u2022 is localized under microscope. Visualization of H 2 O 2 is based on reduction of ferricyanide into Prussian blue. Insect injects saliva through parafilm into 1.25% agarose -30% sucrose, incorporating L-DOPA, (+)-catechin, caffeic and gallic acid. The gel and digestive system are stained in a equal volume of 0.01% K 3 Fe(CN) 6 and FeCl 3 . For control, 5 mM PTU-PPO inhibitor is added. ROS are generated in aphid during PPO-catalyzed oxidation of o-diphenolics. Amount of H 2 O 2 in whole insect is measured at A240. Samples for comparative assay of H2O2 are 1000g \u00b7 15 minutes supernatants of crude homogenates of 10 aphids",

Kanopka Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania Monoamine oxidases (MAO) are enzymes localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane that plays a crucial role in the metabolic degradation of biogenic amines, exists in two functional forms: MAO-A and MAO-B. Both genes are made of 15 exons with identical exon-intron organization. Both enzymes are present in various tissues throughout the body with the highest levels in liver and brain. Altered levels of MAO-B have previously been associated with a number of psychiatric and neurological conditions, e.g. schizophrenia, depression, alcoholism, and neurodegeneration. A polymorphism of the gene encoding MAO-B has been identified as a single base change (A or G) in intron 13 of the X chromosome. The A allele was previously associated with a risk of Parkinson disease (PD). To better understand mechanism of this polymorphism we used an in vitro pre-mRNA splicing assay and our studies show that single base change (G to A) in Mao B gene non-coding, intron 13, sequence increases intron 13 removal efficiency. Currently we are working on understanding mechanism of this phenomenon. P02.9 Small GTPase, GTPBP1 regulates stability of the Bcl-xL mRNA H.-J. Kim, K.-C. Woo, K.-H. Lee, D.-Y. Kim, S.-H. Kim, H.-R.

Microcins are excellent candidates for drug development because virtually limitless numbers of their derivatives can be generated by genetic engineering. Microcin B17 (McB) of E. coli targets DNA gyrase, capturing it in a complex with DNA containing a double-stranded cut. Microcin B17 is synthesized from pro-Microcin B17 (pro-McB) -a product of mcbA gene. Pro-McB undergoes post-ranslational modifications carried out by the McbBCD enzyme, that result in formation of a polypeptide of 43 amino acids containing two oxazole, two thiozole heterocycles and two bis-heterocycles: A-site and B-sites.

Severinov Institute of Gene Biology, Moscow, Russia Microcin B17 (McB) is a 68-aminoacid antibacterial peptide targeting the DNA gyrase. The McB precursor is ribosomally produced and then post-translationally modified by the McbBCD synthase. Active mature McB contains eight oxazole and thiazole heterocycles. Here, we show that a major portion of mature McB contains an additional unusual modification, a backbone ester bond connecting McB residues 51 and 52. The modification results from an N->O acyl shift of Ser52 residue located immediately downstream of one of McB thiazole heterocycles. We speculate that the N,O-peptidyl shift underwent by Ser52 is an offpathway intermediate of post-translational modification catalyzed by the McbBCD synthase.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the 5'-NIO anticancer activity are not well understood. The 5'-NIO treatment decreased human lung cancer cell viability in a concentrationdependent manner, which correlated with G1 phase cell cycle arrest. The 5'-NIO-mediated cell cycle arrest was associated with a decrease in protein levels/activity of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase 1 (Pin1), and phosphorylated Rb. Treatment of A549 cells with Plk1 siRNA or Pin1 inhibitor effectively inhibited the Cdk4 expression and Rb phosphorylation, suggesting their regulatory role at G1 phase. In addition, a Cdk4 inhibitor blocked Plk1-and Pin1-dependent Rb phosphorylation. Coincident with cell cycle arrest, 5'-NIO-inhibited Plk1 and Pin1 induced apoptotic signals following the activation of caspase-3 and -7. In conclusion, the findings in this study suggest that 5'-NIO might have potential anti-cancer efficacy, including the Cdk4-dependent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis of lung cancer cells through the inhibition of Plk1 and Pin1 expression and activation.

Ko\u00a8c\u00b8kar Department of Biology, Bal\u0131kesir University Faculty of Science and Literature, Balikesir/Turkey Abstract: The appropriate choice of an internal standard is critical for quantitative RNA analyses. As housekeeping genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), b-Actin and H-b-2-Microgloblin are commonly employed as RNA internal standards with the assumption that their expression levels remain relatively constant in different experimental conditions. We have compared the gene expression levels of this genes under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in Hep3B (Human hepatoma cell line) with 10% FCS and without FCS (0.1% BSA). The cells were passaged (2 000 000 cells per flask) into 25 cm 2 in 5 ml medium. Chemical induced hypoxic conditions in Hep3B cells were created with 150 lM final concentration of CoCl2 for different time intervals, namely 24, 48 and 72 hours with 10% FCS and without FCS (0.1% BSA). In addition, the expression of HIF1a (Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a) which is the indicator of hypoxic conditions were analyzed. To compare the expression of the individual gene examined, RT-PCR was performed using primers designed using published information on GAPDH, b-actin, H-b-2-Microgloblin and HIF-1a mRNA sequences in GenBank. Hypoxia conditions were correlated with upregulation of the transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a mRNA levels. Expression levels of H-b-2-Microgloblin RNA were constant, independent of O2 tension, but levels of GAPDH and b-Actin varied widely with hypoxic conditions.

Banerjee Phd Candidate and Project AssistantColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths throughout the world. 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) is an enzyme for the conversion of linoleic acid to 13-Shydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE) and its expression is lost in CRC. In this study, we have hypothesized that 15-LOX-1 may be anti-tumorigenic by the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B. The ability of 13(S)-HODE to bind PPARgamma (PPARc); and activities of PPARc and NF-jB in 15-LO-1 expressing HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells were analyzed by luciferase reporter assays, NF-jB DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA and a colorimetric TransAM NF-KappaB DNA binding Assay kit. NF-jB nuclear translocation was investigated using Western blot and immuno?uorescence assay. Our data indicate that ectopic expression of 15-LO-1 gene in HCT-116 and HT-29 CRC cell lines inhibited the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IjBa), decreased nuclear translocation of p65 and p50, decreased DNA binding in the nucleus and decreased transcriptional activity of NF-jB. PPARc can be activated by bioactive lipids and, in turn, activated PPARc is known to inhibit NF-jB. We observed that 13(S)-HODE could bind to and activate PPARc, thereby acting as a ligand. Moreover, the inhibition of both early and late stages of NF-jB activation in 15-LO-1 expressing cells could be rescued by the PPARc antagonist GW9662 indicating that the inhibition was most likely mediated via PPARc. Overall, our work provides a mechanistic overview of the pathway through which 15-LO-1 has pro-apoptotic, anti proliferative function and can therefore be utilized for therapeutic purposes.",

The aim of this work was to evaluated the effect of pravastatin on MM cell line (RPMI 8226), clarifying its action on cell proliferation, viability, cell cycle by Flow Cytometry and gene expression by QRT-PCR. The MM cell line RPMI 8226 was maintained in culture conditions until confluence. After, these cells were transferred into 12-well plates (1.0 \u00b7 106 cells/well,) in four groups (control and 0.3 lM, 0.6 lM and 0.9 lM of Pravastatin). The cells received the treatment for 3 days and the cell viability was determined by Trypan Blue Method. The cell cycle was evaluated by flow cytometry using propidium iodide for the same groups and time. The treatment with pravastatin 0.6 lM and 0.9 lM showed significant decrease of the cell population when compared with the control after 72 hours. Low dosage of pravastatin (0.3 lM) did not present toxicity when compared to control group.There were an arrest of cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase in groups treated with 0.6 lM and 0.9 lM of pravastatin after 72 hours. The evaluation of IL-6 gene did not change. Genes: FGF, TGFb, HMG CoA reductase showed less expressed after treatment. Genetic evaluation was performed by QRT-PCR. These preliminary results show that pravastatin induces late cell death evaluated by the decrease of 50% of the cells after 3 days of treatment. The cell cycle characterizes it by an arrest in G0/ G1 cell cycle after 72 hours. The anti-inflammatory potential of statins and decreased protein ubiquitination may be the mechanisms for the effects found.

Ahn Department of Pathology, School of Dentistry, Chosun University, Gwangju, 501-759, Republic of KoreaHead and neck cancer has the high infiltrative potential leading to metastasis. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of 5'-nitro-indirubinoxime (5'-NIO), an indirubin derivative, on metastasis of head and neck cancer cells and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in this process. After treatment of head and neck cancer cells with 5'-NIO, cell metastatic behaviors such as colony formation, invasion and migration were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. 5'-NIO inhibited the integrin b1/FAK/Akt pathway which can then facilitate invasion and/or migration of cancer cells through the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, treatment of head and neck cancer cell with integrin b1 siRNA or FAK inhibitor effectively inhibited the invasion and migration, suggesting their regulatory role at invasiveness and migratory of head and neck cancer cells. In vivo CAM assay, treatment with 5'-NIO reduced the angiogenesis in FaDu cells xenograft fertilized chicken eggs, primarily by inhibiting expression of VEGF. We conclude that 5'-NIO inhibits the metastatic ability of head and neck cancer cells by blocking the integrin b1/FAK/Akt pathway.

Dalmay, D.R. Edwards, 2006) and tumor-derived DNA (D. Garcia-Olmo et al, 2000, 2010) in regulation of tumorigenesis gave a new start to the study of the nucleases as potential antitumor agents.The tumoricidal activity of mammalian RNase A and DNase I was studied using two murine tumor models with pulmonary (Lewis lung carcinoma) or liver (Hepatoma A-1) metastases. Both nucleases inhibited metastasis development: their intramuscular administration resulted in 2fold decrease of metastasis number and the decrease of metastases area in target organs by 60-90% (therapeutic scheme: RNase A at the doses of 0.3-35 lg/kg, DNase I at the doses of 0.12-2.3 mg/kg, intramuscularly, daily, two weeks). RNase A at the dose range of 0.1-50 lg/kg was shown to retard the primary tumor growth by 20-40% but the increase of its dose up to 10 mg/kg led to a disappearance of both effects. Simultaneous treatment of animals with RNase A and DNase I led to an additive effect and resulted in almost total absence of metastases. The use of RNase A as an adjuvant in conjunction with cytostatic cyclophosphamide resulted in a reliable enhancement of antitumor and antimetastatic effect of the therapy. The search for possible mechanism of antimetastatic effect of nucleases showed that the enzymes reduced the pathologically increased level of extracellular nucleic acids and increased nuclease activity of the blood plasma of tumor-bearing mice back to the level of healthy animals. Thus, we unequivocally show that the proposed protocol of treatment of tumor-bearing animals with RNase A and DNase I has a general systemic and immunomodulatory effect, leads to a drastic suppression of metastasis development, and in perspective may become an effective component of intensive complex therapy of cancer.

In addition, clinical studies show a beneficial effect of converting enzyme inhibitors of Ang II (ACE) reducing neovascularization in tumors and metastases. Therefore, considerable attention has been focused on the development of RAS blockade therapy as a new strategy for cancer treatment. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a major group of enzymes that regulate cell-matrix composition. The importance of degradation of the ECM by MMPs during tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis has long since been established. MMPs activity has been examined in various human tumors, showing that the expression of these proteins is one of the most significant changes observed during the process of carcinogenesis and elevated levels of these are frequently associated with poor prognosis.In this study, we demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulated the growth of breast cancer cells in a dose-and timedependent manner. The maximal proliferation effect on MCF-7 cells was obtained with 1 lM Ang II at 24 hours. Moreover this increase in cell proliferation is correlated with a time-and dosedependent increase in the activity of metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) and MT2-MMP (MMP15). We also studied the influence of Ang II on the expression of transforming grown factor (TGF-b), and hypoxia inducible hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a) finding a correlation with the increased expression of MMPs and cell proliferation.P11.97 Alteration of HOXC5 expression in the development of rat tongue carcinogenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide S. -M. Moon, S. -G. Ahn and J. -H.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of HOXC5, PCNA and bcl-2 during rat tongue carcinogenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Along with the progression of multistage carcinogenesis, the HOXC5 expression levels of mRNA and protein significantly increased during the dysplasia stage when compared with normal epithelia and hyperplasia. Furthermore, highly HOXC5 immunostaining of the nuclei was found in dysplasia stage. These results indicate that HOXC5 expression could contribute to OSCC progression. HOXC5 may be a potential diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for OSCC.This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the the GHRH antagonist, jmr-132, on metastasis-related phenotypes in an experimental model of human prostate cancer L.

A high mortality rate of this disease leads to search new treatment strategies, which include the use of antagonists of the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). GHRH receptors have been proposed as new therapeutic targets in several types of cancer. In this regard, the effectiveness of several GHRH antagonists on tumor growth reduction has been demonstrated. In this work, we analyze the effect of a new GHRH antagonist, JMR-132, in an in vivo experimental model. For this purpose, human androgenindependent prostate cancer PC3 cells were injected in nude mice in order to induce tumors. After treatment with JMR-132 (10 lg/ day), we observed a decrease of tumor growth as compared with control group. Moreover, ELISA and zymography experiments showed a decrease of the expression of the major proangiogenic factor (VEGF165) and metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and -2 activities in the antagonist-treated group. Immunoreactivity analysis of tumor sections for MMP-9 and MMP-2 were correlated with enzyme activity studies. Immunohistological examination using specific antibodies for pGHRH-R and its splice variants revealed an increase of both isoforms in the JMR-132-treated group.",

DrobotPalladin Institute of Biochemistry of the NAS of Ukraine C60 fullerenes are nanodimensional molecules promising for anticancer photodynamic therapy due to their ability to generate ROS after UV/Vis photoexcitation. Nevertheless, the mechanism of C60 fullerene photoinduced cell death in oncotransformed cells has been poorly studied. The aim of the present work was to study the markers of apoptosis in transformed T cells treated with combined UV/Vis light and C60 fullerene. The cytotoxic effect of pristine C60 fullerene was detected in human leukemia T lymphocytes (Jurkat cell line) after irradiation with UV/Vis light (k = 320-600 nm). After 1 minutes irradiation of Jurkat cells preincubated for 1 hours with 50 lM C60 cell viability was decreased by 50 \u00b1 4% after 6 hours incubation. Jurkat irradiation in the presence of C60 caused internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Following the combined action of C60 and UV/ Vis irradiation caspase-3 processing was dramatically intensified -the content of 17 and 19 kDa intermediate cleavage products was increased at 6 hours and reached maximum at 24 hours. Jurkat cells apoptosis photoinduction by C60 appears to be activated by mitochondrial pathway -cytochrome c release by the mitochondria to cytosol was observed 1-3 hours after irradiation. ROS production by photoexcited C60 fullerenes inside Jurkat cells was confirmed by early (0.5 hours after irradiation) activation of superoxide dismutase. Photoexcited C60 fullerene causes apoptotic cell death accompanied by ROS formation, cytochrome c release into the cytosol and subsequent caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in transformed T cells.P11.113The oncogenic WIP1 phosphatase controls HEDGEHOG-GLI1 signaling pathwayS.

A. Krasil'nikov Russian N.N.Blokhin Cancer Research CentreOestrogen plays an important role in the regulation of the breast cancer growth and progression. Many breast cancers are initially sensitive to estrogen and antiestrogen treatment. The acquired tolerance of breast cancers to growth stimulating estrogen action may provokes the paradoxical tumor sensitization to estrogen apoptotic action. The phenomenon of the cell sensitization to estrogen-induced apoptosis has been demonstrated for the breast cancer cells undergoing long-term estrogen withdrawal or antiestrogen treatment. NF-kB is a transcriptional factor that controls apoptosis and cell responses to stress. Earlier studies have shown that estradiol suppress NF-kB, demonstrating the possible NF-kB involvement in the estrogen apoptotic action. The goal of this work is to study the influence of estrogens on the sensitivity of the resistant breast tumors to doxorubicin, and to evaluate the role of NF-kB signaling in the regulation of the survival of the resistant breast cancer cells. MCF-7/LS subline was developed by long-term cultivation of the parental cell line MCF-7 in steroidfree medium. The transcriptional activity of NF-kB and estrogen receptor was determined using luciferase reporter gene assay. The apoptosis level was evaluated by flow cytometry using staining with propidium iodide. It has been demonstrated that estradiol enhances the apoptotic action of doxorubicin in the resistant MCF-7/LS breast cancer cells. The proapoptotic estrogen action is mediated by NF-kB suppression when NF-kB knock-down sensitizes the resistant cells to both estrogen and doxorubicin. Thus estrogen-induced NF-kB suppression in the resistant breast cancers results in an imbalance between pro-and anti-apoptotic pathways and cell sensitization to anti-tumor drugs. Additional inhibition of NF-kB by siRNA increases the apoptotic action of estrogen and doxorubicin, demonstrating that NF-kB may be considered as a potential target in the therapy of the resistant breast cancers.Cancer is the one the most important health problem of today's and because of the high death risk and being so widespread, it has became to public health disease. Cancer is described as uncontrolled cell proliferation and invasion, it effects all the tissues and organs of the body. Zinc containing carbonic anhydrase enzymes have important roles in different physiological processes as gas exchange, ion transport and acid-base balance. There are 15 enzymatically active CA isoforms in mammalian and the role of these enzymes is catalysis of the hydration of CO2 molecule and dehydration of HCO3-ions. CAXII and CAIX are both tumour related genes that induced at the transcriptional level via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 mediated pathway, which is activated in tumor cells by hypoxia or by a mutation in the Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene. Tumour-associated inflammation and tumourigenesis makes several cytokines attractive targets for adjuvant treatment in cancer such as TNFa. Cytokines have very important roles in a whole range of body functions from general maintenance through regulating inflammatory responses. Up to 20% of all cancers arise in association with chronic inflammation and immune cells have a broad impact on tumour initiation, growth and progression and many of these effects are mediated by proinflammatory cytokines In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of TGF-b and TNF-a on the expression of tumor-related CAXII and CAIX at mRNA and protein levels in prostate tumour cell line. Therefore cells were treated with cytokines at different concentrations and the gene expression profiles of CAIX and CAXII were determined after 24, 48 and 72 hours by real time PCR. Western blot and flow cytometry analysis were used for detection of protein profiles of treated cells.Keywords: cancer, cytokines, PC3 P11.130 In vivo effects of epilobium hirsutum extract on different glutathione transferase isozymes A.

In this study, we compared cytotoxic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with hexenyl ester of ALA (ALA-hx) between MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and MCF-7/ADR, adriamycin-resistant MCF-7 cells. In MCF-7/ADR cells, PDT with ALA-hx more efficiently produced ROS and suppressed cell viability compared to MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis revealed that cell death induced by PDT in MCF-7/ADR cells was mainly due to apoptosis. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay confirmed that apoptotic activity of PDT in MCF-7/ADR cells was significantly higher than that in control MCF-7 cells. We further found that MCF-7/ADR cells produced lower levels of glutathione (GSH) than control MCF-7 cells. Molecular analyses using Western blots and minimal reporter construct containing antioxidant response element (ARE) region showed that expression of Nrf2-dependent anti-oxidant genes including c-glutamylcysteine ligase, heme oxygenase-1 and quinine oxidoreductase were down-regulated in MCF-7/ADR cells and Nrf2 overexpression significantly decreased susceptibility of PDT in MCF-7/ADR cells. Moreover, PpIX synthesis and the expression levels of protoporphyrinogen oxidase and coproporphyrinogen oxidase were much higher in MCF-7/ADR cells than MCF-7 cells.

From RC LR n5/2002-200. of St.Petersburg, St.Petersburg, Russia A number of investigations have appeared lately, linking serotonin systems with the development of psychic diseases and pathological states of consciousness. The presence of the short variant (S) of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and C102T polymorphism of gene of serotonin receptor 5HTR2A are associated with development of psychic diseases and pathological states of consciousness. The present study was primarily linked to the search for genetic markers, supporting active adaptation to unusual and extreme conditions. The group studied by us comprised 205 persons, aged 70 years and older, because long livers are an adequate model of human successful adaptation to any stress. Genetic part of our study included genotyping by polymerase chain reaction in various modifications. Basing upon the results of genotyping, we have demonstrated that occurrence of variants of this gene in the group of long-livers corresponds perfectly to the Russian populations in general. On the contrary, presence of correlation between the 'weak' allele of 5-HTR2A gene, longevity and religiosity was demonstrated. Taking in this way part in the formation of a 'psychological defense centre', such as religiosity, A2 polymorphism of gene of serotonin receptor is likely to contribute to attaining active longevity, although in an indirect way.

Rio de Janeiro, RJ -BrazilMu\u00a8ller cells constitute the main glial cell type in the retina and span the tissue from the inner to the outer limiting membranes. Several functions have been attributed to these cells including structural and nutritional roles as well removal of ions and neurotransmitters from the extracellular space. The potential of Mu\u00a8ller cells to actively participate in cellular communication within the nervous system has been recently uncovered. Moreover, it has been suggested that this type of cell can undergo de-differentiation process upon specific signals and become a progenitor-like cell. Also, it has been shown that Mu\u00a8ller cells can generate neurons under appropriate conditions. The knowledge on controlling this particular differentiation could be extremely useful as potential therapy against neurodegenerative disorders. In the present work, we evaluate the capability of Mu\u00a8ller cells to be used as a source of neuronal cells and evaluate the functional dopaminergic differentiation of Mu\u00a8ller glia into dopamine releasing cells. We have shown that Mu\u00a8ller cells in culture (n=3) not only express dopaminergic markers as the dopamine transporter (DAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and the transcription factor for dopaminergic differentiation Nurr1 but they are also able to produce and release dopamine in vitro (n = 5), reaching values of 50 \u00b1 10 nmoles or 65 \u00b1 8nmoles, when treated either with 10 lM forskolin or 10nM PACAP38, respectively. Injection of functional dopaminergic differentiated Mu\u00a8ller cells in mouse model of Parkinson's disease obtained with stereotactic injection of 6-OH-DA in the striatum clearly reduced the typical apomorphine-induced rotational behavior presented by the animals (n = 7).

Only the PO-BarrelN_His variant (encompassing the whole C-terminal catalytic domain of the protein, residues from 176 to 570) was successfully expressed as soluble dimeric holoprotein which shows spectral characteristics typical of the FAD-containing flavo-proteins. Its specific activity on the physiological substrate L-proline is quite low: 20 mU/mg. The expression of additional deletion variants of PO, as well as of PO variants related to schizophrenia susceptibility, will allow the investigation of the effect the reported PRODH1 polymorphisms on the catalytic properties of the enzyme and on the Lproline concentration in selected cell lines.References: 1.

To date, fifteen members have been identified in a wide variety of cells and tissues. The aim of this work is to contribute to the definition of the biological function of galectins in the development and differentiation of the central nervous system (CNS). We have determined the expression pattern of 8 galectins (Gal-1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9) by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis in cultured neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. Among the different galectins analyzed, Gal-1, 3, 4 and 8",

The animals were divided into 3 groups: the control group consisted of vehicle-treated animals; the 1st experimental group was i.c.v.

Results of flow cytometric and immunohistochemical studies of our experiment observed that after i.c.v. injection of Ab1-42 in hippocampus there were no significant changes in fluorescence intensity and quantiy of Nestin, Wnt and BrdU/Wnt doublelabeled cells, but Vimentin, Nestin/Vimentin double-labeled cells decreased compared with the control cells, which suggested the inhibitory effect of neurodegeneration on neural stem cells maintenance and survival. On contrary, the expression BrdU positive cells increased, which suggested that neurodegeneration could play a trigger role in stem-cells proliferation. After administration of PEG fluorescence intensity of Vimentin and Nestin/Vimentin double-labeled cells dramatically increased compared with amyloid, which proposed that PEG activate the proliferation and further differentiation of adult stem cells in brain.P14.70 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: a pilot study R.

Cardarelli, Napoli Introduction: Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a disease characterized by high levels of total and LDL cholesterol. The Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCH) consists in the increase of total cholesterol, triglycerides or both and has a polygenic and multifactorial basis not yet completely clarified. Mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene are the main cause of FH. More than 1100 mutations in the LDLR have been reported although mutation clusters are present in different countries. LDLR mutations have been reported in clinically diagnosed FCH patients indicating a misdiagnosis. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 102 FH patients and 90 FCH patients from Southern Italy with a clinical diagnosis. The promoter and 18 exons of the LDLR gene were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. For detection of large rearrangements, copy number quantification of the 18 exons of the LDLR gene was performed by the SALSA MLPA kit. Results. Direct sequencing and MLPA analysis revealed mutations in the LDLR gene in 76/102 FH patients (mutation rate 74.5%). Among the 34 different mutations found, 6 mutations (2",

Cardiovascular disease can be related to various factors including environmental components. This study evaluates the effect of early life permethrin treatment (1/50 LD50, from 6th to 21st day of life) on heart in adult rats. Increased DNA damage, decrease in plasma membrane fluidity, increase in cholesterol content, protein and lipid oxidation have been measured in cardiac cells population obtained from adult rats treated with permethrin during neonatal period. Moreover the same group showed higher level of cholesterol, IL-1 b, IL-2, IFNc, rat-Rantes and IL-10 cytokines and decreased albumin content in plasma. No change in homocysteine was detected. Lower cholesterol level and perturbation in the phospholipid lateral diffusion together with a decrease in GSH level and increase in GPx activity were measured in heart mitochondria from treated group. Our finding supports the evidence that neonatal period of life plays a critical role in the development of adulthood heart disease. We hypothesize that the alterations observed in adult rats are influenced by epigenetic changes occurred during neonatal period that can modify gene expression finally affecting different parameters related to cardiac functions.P15.20 ADMA and Apelin, two novel biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in vascular surgery: a preliminary study in carotid atherosclerosis A.

Zaklyazminskaya Russian Research Center of Surgery RAMS, Moscow, Russian FederationBackground: Primary HCM is inherited cardiac disorder characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in My-BPC3 gene account 20% of HCM cases and usually associate with favorable prognosis. Despite good survival of MyBPC3 mutation carriers may also have a risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Genetic screening of HCM-related genes in HCM patients can be used for diagnosis confirmation, making more clear personal and familial prognosis and genetic counseling. Methods: By now panel of 30 patients with primary HCM have been formed. We have screened coding and adjacent intronic areas of MyBPC3 by direct sequencing in four patients. Medical examination: personal and familial history collection, physical examination, standard ECG, 24-hour HM and Echo-CG. Results: Two known mutations (S217G, Q1233ter), two known HCM-associated polymorphisms (S236G, R326Q) and two new variants (c.2067+38 A>T, V449E) were found. Patient carried heterozygous variants R326Q, Q1233ter, and c.2067+38 A>T, had early manifestation, fast progression and positive SCD familial history. Compound heterozygosity of Q1233ter and R326Q variants was previously described as HCMassociated combination without SCD events. Patient with mild form of HCM had heterozygous S217G mutation shown previously as leading to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM (with sudden infant death) both. Carrier of new V449E variant had positively familial history with SCD. The fourth patient with HCM-associated polymorphisms S236G, had mild HCM with late-onset at 45 y.o. Population analysis of unknown variants (c.2067+38 A>T, V449E), and genetic screening of other HCM-associated genes will be further provided in this group of patients. Conclusion: We suspected that new variants (c.2067+38 A>T, V449E) can be associated with HCM and the functional effect of these modifications on MyBPC3 protein has to be studied.",

Joint stimulation of GF with poly(I:C) and oligonucleotides (ODN), with specific sequences, demonstrates that both ssODN and dsODN possess sequence-dependent inhibiting effect. Inhibition of IL production after colipofection of ODN and poly(I:C) into cells indicates the involvement of RLRs or other cytoplasmic factors in the effect. Affinity modification/isolation with subsequent MALDI-TOF identification of cellular proteins interacting with the ODNs demonstrate that the main targets for these ODNs are DNA-PK proteins KU70 and KU80. The importance of ODN-KU70/80 binding in modulation of IL secretion should be clarified.

Pre-injection of donor cells via portal vein significantly increases the survival rate of tissue allografts from the same donor, due to portal vein tolerance (PVT). Uncovering of possible regulatory mechanisms of PVT development is necessary for understanding of this phenomenon and for its medical application. Immune proteasomes (IPs), which produce antigenic peptides from intracellular proteins for MHC I, can be involved in such regulation. Objective: The behavior of IPs in the liver and transplant of tolerated and non-tolerated rats during neonatal ovary transplantation under the renal capsule remains unclear. Methods: The dynamics of IPs expression was assessed by Western blotting with anti-LMP7/2 antibodies. The cellular distribution of IPs was shown using immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry (FC). Chymotrypsin-like (ChTL) and caspase-like (CL) proteasomal activities were evaluated by hydrolysis of commercial fluorogenic peptides. Results: The total amount of IPs was equal in tolerated and non-tolerated livers. However the increase of the amount of cells with high content of LMP2 and decrease of the amount of cells with high content of LMP7 was demonstrated in the liver of rats with induced PVT. Moreover high CL, not ChTL, activity was detected in the liver directly after injection of donor cells and it was further increased in the liver of tolerated rats with survived transplant. The significant changes in IP levels in the transplant were observed between tolerated and non-tolerated animals. IPs with the LMP7 prevailed in the rejected transplant of non-tolerated rats and were found in the immune and non-immune cells populating the transplantation area. IPs with the LMP2 dominated in the cells of survived transplant of tolerated animals. Conclusion: The PVT development is associated mainly with the functioning of the IPs with LMP2.",

Palestini Department of Experimental Medicine, DIMS, POLARIS Research Center, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Milano, Italy Endotoxins are components of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria associated to the fine and coarse PM fractions (Schins et al., 2004). From previous literature data, it is known that coarse PM collected in summer is able to induce strong inflammatory response possibly due to the huge presence of Gram-negative bacteria (Alfaro-Moreno et al., 2007; Farina et al., 2011). Analyses performed on PM10 collected in a Milano urban area during summer season (PM10sum) showed a LPS content of 60.5 EU/mg (Camatini et al., 2010). BALB/c mice were intratracheally aerosolized with 100 ll of saline solution containing 100 lg of PM10sum for three times, leaving 2 days recovery between the instillations; control mice, running parallel to PM10sum treated ones, were instilled with 100 ll of saline solution. 24 hours after the last instillation mice were euthanized, BALf was collected and lung excised as described in Farina et al., 2011. BALf was analysed for TNF-a and MIP-2 concentration, while levels of HO-1 and Hsp70, two protection proteins, were evaluated in lung parenchyma. HO-1 and its enzymatic products have been shown to down-regulate the inflammatory response (Wagener et al., 2001) as well as to prevent apoptosis (Reiter and Demple, 2005) and lipid peroxidation (Reiter et al., 2006). Moreover, HO-1 and Hsp70, together with an already documented tolerance induced by the continuous exposition of lungs to LPS, are able to negatively regulate TLR4 signalling, thus attenuating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting iNOS production and so resolving the inflammatory status (Wang et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2006). PM10sum intratracheal aerosolization in mice induces all the protection mechanisms above described, as demonstrated by the analyses of MDA, iNOS, Caspase8-p18, Caspase3-p17 and -p11, IRAK-1, TAK-1 and IKBa levels in the lung parenchyma.",

Kim 1 1 Center of Herbal Resources Research, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, 2 Department of Veterinary Histology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of KoreaGardenia jasminoides is a traditional herbal medicine with antiinflammatory properties. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with enhanced T-helper 2 (Th2) lymphocyte responses to allergens that results in elevated serum IgE levels and peripheral eosinophilia. We investigated the effectiveness of Gardenia jasminoides extract (GJE) as an antiallergic agent in an AD model as well as its underlying mechanism of action. The effects of GJE on house-dust mite allergen (Dermatophagoides farinae)-treated NC/Nga mice were evaluated by skin symptom severity, ear thickness, production of serum IgE and histamine, and mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in the ear lesions. In addition, the levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/ CCL17), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5) produced in both TNF-a-and IFN-c-stimulated human keratinocytes were investigated by ELISA. GJE treatment of NC/Nga mice significantly reduced dermatitis scores, ear thicknesses, and the levels of serum IgE, histamine, and TNF-a. Histological examination demonstrated decreased thickening of the epidermis/dermis as well as dermal infiltration by inflammatory cells. In the ear lesions, mRNA expression levels of IL-4, TNF-a, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were inhibited by GJE treatment. GJE also suppressed the induction of TARC, MDC, and RANTES in the ear lesions and HaCaT cells. In conclusion, GJE inhibits the development of AD in NC/Nga mice by suppressing the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.P16.38 (S16.3.5) NLR expression and inflammasome activation in neutrophils C.

Bellini Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Section of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, University of Ferrara, Italy Objectives: One of the most important aspects of the management of critically ill patients is to modulate the inflammatory process, this goal could be achieved by fluid administration in presence of hypovolemia. The objective of our study was to observe the in vitro modulation of Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities by two commercially available solutions for volume replacement: 6% polyhydroxyethyl starch (HES) in 154 mM NaCl (S), 6% HES in balanced solution (B). Moreover, we aimed to verify whether B and S solutions can influence neutrophils response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Methods: Activities of MMP-9 and MPO were measured with commercially available Activity Assay kits. The levels of MMP-9 and MPO were determined with ELISA in conditioned media after LPS and IL-8 stimulation of neutrophils. Results: The B solution showed more inhibitory effect on both MMP-9 and MPO activities compared to S solution. Compared to RPMI, the S and B solutions had the same effect on MPO release under IL-8 and LPS stimulation. On the contrary, the release of MMP-9 was increased in the B solution after IL-8 stimulation, whereas it was reduced in B and unaffected in S solution after LPS treatment.Conclusions: MMP-9 and MPO activities as well as neutrophils response to inflammatory stimuli are differentially affected by the ionic composition of the different solutions used in fluid replacement and could be relevant for the ''in vivo'' therapy.",

Ps encompass 8000 chemical structures. Flavonoids, i.e. anthocyanidins, catechins, flavones, flavanones, flavonols, isoflavones, and phenolic acids, e.g. gallic, tannic, and also stilbens, e.g. resveratrol are the most abundant and bioactive Ps in the human diet. The dietary Ps are important/multi-aspect subject of a variety of current sciences i.e. molecular medicine, nutrition, toxicology and genetic engineering due to antioxidant and prooxidant mechanisms and other biochemical activities i.e. antimutagenicity and anticarcinogenicity. This paper provides a survey of amount and antioxidant effectiveness of total Ps in food groups i.e. beverages, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds and vegetables. The concentrations of total Ps vary between 0.28 (bean) and 137 (tea) mg x g of the dry weight. Relatively high levels of Ps are in berries and citrus versus banana. About six fold level of Ps is found in pigmented fruits, e.g. blackberry, strawberry versus black and green tea. Essentially high content of Ps is in apple/grape peel versus pulp, respectively fourfold/sevenfold. Seeds of white/red grapes contain extremely high concentration of Ps; fourteen fold versus pulp. The concentrations of total Ps in vegetables are in order: red pepper>broc-coli>red onion>potato>tomato>carrot. Red onion contains three times more of Ps versus potato and tomato. Grains, e.g. wheat, barley contain till hundred times less Ps versus tea and only twice less versus potato and tomato. Soy bean is relatively abundant in Ps versus common legumes, and contains till tenfold level of Ps versus kidney bean. In the case of antioxidant capacity, the variety is assessed: berry fruits=tea>red pepper> lemon>broccoli>apple>soy bean. The highest correlation coefficient (r=0.98) is indicated for the antioxidant potential and the total Ps of apple, black tea and soy bean. The data on natural sources of antioxidant Ps are applicable to health menu, diet supplementation, phytotherapy and food processing P18.29 Protective activity of Amaranthus lividus L. against acute hepatotoxicity in ratsT.

Drought is one of the main factors affecting growth and productivity of plants. The purpose of this study is to identify new strategies to improve the productivity of crops grown in arid environments. Several Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) strains have been identified from a large collection of bacterial isolates from rhizosphere and roots of pepper plants collected from the Egyptian desert. Pepper plants grown hydroponically were inoculated with selected bacterial strains in nutrient solution with addition of polyetilenglycole (PEG6000) to induce water stress. At the leaf level the effect of bacterial strains on pepper plants has been assessed by leaf gas exchange measurements, determining net photosynthesis (Pn), evaporation/transpiration (E), stomatal conductance (Gs): after PEG addition, inoculated plants showed values of Pn, E, Gs parameters significantly higher than not inoculated plants. At the root level bacterial strains directly affected Na and K content: indeed, their concentration increased more in inoculated plants than in non-inoculated ones in the presence of PEG. In order to understand the change in the concentration of these ions occurring in inoculated plants under water stress condition, the involvement of the vacuolar proton pumps (V-ATPase and V-PPase) has been investigated. Western blot analysis performed on the tonoplast enriched fraction and immunolocalization on cross sections of root tips revealed, under water stress, an increased level of the vacuolar H+-PPase protein in inoculated plants respect to not inoculated plants. The collected data suggest that the bacterial strains induce in plants a greater degree of tolerance to water stress through the activation of the vacuolar H+-PPase which lowers the root water potential thus promoting the absorption of water.P18.33 (S18.1.5) Flax produces biologically acitive cannabinoids M.

Decay accelerating factor (DAF) or CD55, a complement regulating protein protects cells against complementmediated damage. Previously we demonstrated that MG subjects of African or recent African ancestry with a c.-198C>G SNP in the regulatory region of the DAF gene, have an increased risk of developing treatment-resistant EOM dysfunction. We showed that the c.-198C>G SNP prevents up-regulation of DAF mRNA and protein levels in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced immune stress1. We thus hypothesized that the c.-198C>G SNP may result in lower DAF expression in MG patients on standard immunosuppressive therapy. Indeed, using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting, we show that prednisone treatment of c.-198C>G lymphoblastoid cells at both clinically relevant low (0.1 lM) and high (10 lM) doses result in reduced DAF expression. In contrast, under the same conditions, lymphoblastoid cells with wild type DAF showed increased mRNA levels. The effect of prednisone on DAF expression was shown to be transcriptional since promoter luciferase-reporter assays reflected the same results obtained for the qRT-PCR experiments. Preliminary analyses with azathioprine (5 lM) and cyclosporine (0.25 and 5 lM), yielded similar results to that obtained for prednisone. Importantly, in response to methotrexate (10 and 22 lM), a drug not routinely used in the treatment of MG, DAF mRNA and protein levels are upregulated in c.-198C>G lymphoblastoid cells compared to controls. Our results have serious implications for the effective treatment of MG patients with c.-198C>G DAF because it highlights the shortcomings of current drugs in response to LPS-induced immune stress and identifies methotrexate as a drug of preference.

C. Santos Biomembranes Unit, Instituto de Medicina MolecularA new class of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) was generated by splicing the (1-9) and (38-42) segments of crotamine, a toxin from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom[1]. As they localize preferably on the nucleolus, these novel CPPs were named nucleolartargeting peptides (NrTPs). The extent of NrTP partition to zwitterionic (POPC; POPC:cholesterol 67:33) and anionic (POPG; POPC:POPG 70:30) lipid vesicles was studied following the intrinsic Tyr or Trp fluorescence of the peptides. The partition curves into POPC zwitterionic vesicles were characterized by downward slopes and higher partition coefficients (Kp104-105).For pure POPG, an upward curve and smaller partition coefficient point out for a different type of membrane-peptide interaction. POPC:POPG membranes present characteristics of both types of interaction. From red edge excitation shift and quench-ing experiments similar conclusions were attained. Leakage assays ruled out lipid vesicle disruption by crotamine or NrTPs. Further studies on NrTP cellular translocation mechanism and large molecule delivery are currently in progress. Reference: 1.

This study examined the anti-tumor effects of 5-OH-NIO in A549 non-small lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. 5-OH-NIO significantly inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells and increased the proportion of apoptotic cells by FACS analysis and DAPI staining. The levels of cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspse-9 and PARP were increased in 5-OH-NIO treated cells. 5-OH-NIO-induced apoptosis through caspase activation was confirmed by the increase in the release of cytochrome c and Bax levels. The inhibitory effect of 5-OH-NIO on tumor growth was confirmed by in vivo tumor xenograft model. 5-OH-NIO significantly suppressed transplanted A549 cells tumor growth and the expression of proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). 5-OH-NIO also increased TUNEL positive apoptotic cells populations compared with vehicle-treated control in tumor tissue. These results suggest that 5-OH-NIO may be effective in the treatment of lung cancer with possible inhibition of tumor growth by inducing the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Although it's widely used in the treatment of cancer as a therapeutic agent, acquired resistance has served to limit the widespread use of cisplatin. In this study, cytotoxic and apoptotic effects ofdinuclear Au(III) ve Pt (II) complexes [Au(ip)(bipp)]PF6, [Au(pip)(bipp)]PF6, [Au(ip)(bipp)]PtCI2 and [Au(pip)(bipp)]PtCI2 on A549 cells in comparison with those of cisplatin were investigated. MTT assay performed to investigate the effects of applied metal complexes on cell profileration. JC-1 staining were used to investigate apoptotic effects of test substances. Our results revealed that dinuclear Au(III) ve Pt (II) complexes have cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on A549 cells. In addition, these substances proved to be more cytotoxic effects on A549 cells than cisplatin.

Pinent Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Universitat Rovira i Virgili of TarragonaIntroduction: Hyperglycemia derived from insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes leads to progressive beta cell dysfunction and beta cell loss by apoptosis, known as glucotoxicity. Phenolic compounds, included procyanidins, have been reported to modulate apoptosis in several cell types. Procyanidins are the most abundant polyphenols in grapes and red wine and they function as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the effect of grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) on apoptosis of pancreatic b-cells in vitro under conditions of high glucose. Materials and methods: First, pancreatic b-cells INS-1E were treated with different concentrations of glucose and during different periods of time to establish the conditions in which it induces apoptosis in our cells. Then, we analyzed the protective effects of a 24-hour treatment of GSPE, at 25 mM of glucose. Apoptosis was quantified by measuring histone-complexed DNA fragments (kit Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche), Bcl-2 gene expression by Real Time PCR and caspase activity (Caspase-Glo\u00d2 3/7 Assay, Promega). All statistic analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: The treatment of INS-1E cells with high glucose increased the apoptosis levels at all doses and at all times assayed, and decreased the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 in most of the treatments. The treatment of the cells with GSPE further increased the apoptosis levels and decreased Bcl-2, showing a tendency at 5 mg/l and significantly at 25 mg/l. The dose of 25 mg/l of GSPE also enhanced the effects of glucose treatment on caspase activity. Conclusion: Under assayed conditions, GSPE does not protect against the apoptosis caused by high glucose in a pancreatic bcell line. Some more work needs to be done to better understand the effects and mechanisms of procyanidins on apoptosis induced by high glucose in pancreatic b-cells.",

Ahn Department of Pathology, School of Dentistry, Chosun University, Gwangju, South KoreaThis study was examined the therapeutic effect of photodynamic therapy using the photosensitizer Pheophorbide a (Pa-PDT) in mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma AT-84 cells. Pa-PDT treatment significantly induced cell growth inhibition and the intracellular ROS generation, which is critical for cell death induced by PDT. Cell cycle analysis showed the increased sub-G1 proportion of cells in Pa-PDT treated cells. Induction of apoptotic cell death was confirmed by DAPI staining and the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (DY (m)). The changes in apoptosisrelated molecules were next examined using Western blot after Pa-PDT treatment. The release of cytochrome C and the cleavage of caspse-3, PAPR were exhibited, whereas Bcl-2 protein level was decreased. To determine the therapeutic effect of Pa-PDT in vivo, mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma animal model was established. Treatment of mice with Pa-PDT significantly inhibited tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay showed decreased PCNA expression and increased apoptotic cells compared to vehicle-treated controls. Our findings suggested the therapeutic potential of Pa-PDT in the oral squmous cell carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo.

Constantinescu Signal Transduction Unit, Universite\u00b4Catholique de Louvain, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research -Brussels, BelgiumN-glycosylation is a major post-translational modification shown to exert profound effects on protein folding, stability and ligand binding. Little is known on the role of the N-glycosylation pattern in cytokine receptor function, except that ligand binding does not require N-glycosylation of the receptor. We asked whether the four N-glycosylation sites present in the extracellular domain of the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) are important for receptor traffic and stability. TpoR mutants lacking single or multiple N-glycosylation sites were created by changing the codon for Asn in each of the four potential N-glycosylation sequons to the codon for Gln. The resultant expressed proteins were named 1, 2, 3, 4, 123, 134, 124, 234 according to the N-glycosylation site/sites removed. The cell surface expression of the mutants was assayed in stably transduced murine pro-B cell line. We observed that N-glycosylation mutations at any of the four sites determined a decrease in cell surface levels of the receptor. The glycosylation status of the receptor mutants was assessed in transiently transfected HEK293T, by performing digestions with PNGaseF and EndoH. 1, 2, 3, 4 TpoRs were able to acquire the mature N-glycosylated pattern but there was no evidence of mature receptor in the case of 123, 134, 124, 234. Stability experiments in which we used cycloheximide treatment of cells stably transduced with different TpoRs mutants showed a decrease of receptor stability for the 123, 134, 124, 234 TpoRs compared with the wild-type TpoR. Nevertheless, the receptor mutants were not defective in signaling, as shown in overexpression conditions in JAK2-deficient cell line where mutants were able to support activation of STAT pathway upon Tpo stimulation. Our preliminary conclusion is that the acquisition of the complete N-glycosylation pattern is important for the stability and efficient cell surface localization of the TpoR.P21.2 The N-terminal region of GSK-3 alpha dictates its distinct cellular localization and function in the nucleus I.

LPS enhanced TNF-a expression in Raw 264.7 macrophage cells. We found that the expressions of PLDs were increased by LPS-stimulation along with TNF-a expression in Raw 264.7 cells. To investigate the role of PLD in LPS-induced TNF-a expression, we transfected PLD1, PLD2 or their dominant negative forms to Raw 264.7 cells. Interestingly, PLD overexpression increased TNF-a expression without LPStreatment. Moreover, LPS-induced TNF-a expression was blocked by PLD siRNA. This result suggesting that PLDs can regulate LPS-induced TNF-a expression. Next, we investigated whether mTOR-P70S6K, JNK and c-Jun were involved as PLD downstream molecules in LPS-induced TNF-a expression. The phosphorylation of P70S6K, JNK and c-Jun induced by LPS were dramatically decreased when PLDs were downregulated by siRNA. Furthermore, we found that c-Jun bound to the TNF-a promoter, and its binding to the promoter their binding was mediated by PLD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PLD acts as an important regulator in LPS-induced for TNF-a expression through mTOR-P70S6K, JNK and c-Jun signaling pathway in Raw264.7 cells.P21.42 Ubiquitination and the DNA damage response: the role of ubiquitin binding domains in RNF168's function S.

            "text": "Analysis is widely used experimentally to study the distribution of flux control within a metabolic system. The aim of this study was to perform complete MCA for mitochondria by measuring the flux control coefficients (FCC) for all complexes of ATP synthasome and mitochondrial creatine kinase in permeabilized cardiac cells under conditions of (i) direct activation of respiration by ADP and (ii) control of respiration by the MtCK reaction. FCC in control experiments were measured in isolated heart mitochondria. Under physiological conditions the major energy carrier from mitochondria into cytoplasm is PCr, produced by mitochondrial creatine kinase due to the selec-tive of permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) (Timohhina et al. 2009). Functional coupling to adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is enhanced by selective limitation of permeability of MOM within supercomplex ATP synthasome-MtCK-VDAC-tubulin, mitochondrial interactosome (Timohhina 2009; Saks 2010). The complexes of MI were gradually inhibited by their specific inhibitors: mitochondrial creatine kinase by 2,4-DNFB, ANT by carboxyatractyloside, Complex I by rotenone, Complex III by antimycin, Complex IV by NaCN, ATP synthasome by oligomycin and Pi carrier by mersalyl. FCC of the several complexes increases significantly when MI was activated (condition 2). The main regulatory complexes in the MI are MtCK (FCC = 0,92) and ANT (FCC = 0,95) which emphases again the MtCK and the PCr/Cr as main energy flux regulator in cardiomyocytes. The results of this study show very high efficiency of regulation of energy fluxes in the coupled to MtCK -ANT reaction within mitochondrial interactosome in comparison with linear sequence of reactions in the ATP synthasome activated by direct addition of ADP. High efficiency of energy flux control in MI makes this supercomplex a key site for feedback metabolic regulation of mitochondrial respiration in cardiac cells.

Mature Mks were plated on different collagen preparations or on different adhesive extracellular matrix proteins. Mk spreading and PPF were evaluated by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. We found that adhesion of Mks to fibrillar type I collagen inhibited PPF, but not Mk spreading that was maintained over 16 hours incubation. This process was strictly dependent on fibrillar structure and biochemical properties of the adhesive substrate. In fact we showed that chemical modification of N-acetylation on collagen I, that leads to loss of negative charge on lysine residues and prevents 'in vitro' fibrillogenesis, permitted PPF, while completely inhibited Mk spreading in 2 hour incubation. Interestingly activation of Rho/ROCK pathway, upon engagement of a2b1 integrin, occurred in Mks adherent on both collagen preparations. However, increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 was observed in Mks adherent on native type I collagen with respect to Mks adherent on the modified collagen. Therefore we hypothesized the existence of a reciprocal regulatory interaction between extracellular matrix structure and Mk function within the bone marrow microenvironment.",

Major differences between the GAF domains from two sensor kinases are limited to the channel to the heme, which is embedded in the domain. The channel in DosS is narrow and can be blocked by E87 while that in DosT is always open and wide. Two mutant proteins, E87A and E87G of the DosS GAF domain, which have an opened channel, behavior like DosT indicating oxygen-binding when reduced forms are exposured to air. Reversely, a mutant G85E of DosT shows similar spectrum to the DosS representing its oxidation. It suggests that oxygen accessibility to heme confers oxygen-binding property on the GAF domain. the soluble cell-free synthesis of correctly folded IMPs were tested.

We performed structural and biophysical studies on a P450 from S. erythraea, called EryK. This protein catalyzes the C6 hydroxylation of its substrate, erythromycin D (ErD), during the erythromycin biosynthesis[2]. We determined the structure of two different forms of ligand-free EryK. Depending on the degree of exposure of the active site to the bulk, we could distinguish between an open and a closed conformation of the free protein. Pre-steady-state kinetic studies revealed that these structures are in equilibrium in solution and thus represent two alternative conformations of the enzyme. Ionic strength can modulate the relative populations of these conformers, allowing, for the first time, an unequivocal assignment of pre-existing alternative conformations in a P450[3]. Furthermore, by solving the structures of EryK in complex with its substrate, we identified key interactions determining the high selectivity for ErD.Recently, we solved the structures of EryK in complex with azole inhibitors, ketoconazole and clotrimazole.

Although tertiary structural information is crucial for function annotation and potential drug design, the three dimensional structure of Smoothened protein has not been experimentally determined yet. Because of that, homology modeling is a helpful technique to reveal its tertiary structure. In inactive Hh pathway, Smoothened is repressed by Protein patched homolog 1 (Ptch) until ligand Sonic hedgehog homolog (Shh) binds to Ptch. Some Smoothened amino acid changes act as activating missense mutations (e.g. Trp535Leu and Arg562Gln) that can lead to unregulated activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and therefore to cancer, what was shown in sporadic basal-cell carcinoma. We used de novo protein structure prediction and comparative modeling by using known X-ray structures of GPCRs as templates (rhodopsin, b1-adrenergic receptor, Frizzled) to model tertiary structure of Smoothened. The best predicted 3D model was then used to investigate how polymorphisms and known activating mutations, found in basal cell carcinoma, could affect the structure and stability of the protein.This modeled three dimensional structure of Smoothened protein could be further used to identify the possible mechanism of Smoothened inhibition by plant-derived teratogen cyclopamine and then virtual screening of compound libraries can be performed to find new potential antagonists of Smoothened protein, which could be used as therapeutic agents.

Chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers and even cancer may represent the final effect after infection. However, the CagL-integrin interaction is not essential for the CagA translocation suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism of action of CagL in H. pylori infection.

These motifs are involved in ADP-ribosylation activity which is one of the main mechanisms of cell intoxication employed by bacteria.

Box 13145-1384, University of Tehran, Tehran -Iran Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of the metabolic syndrome. NASH is defined as steatosis (intrahepatic lipid accumulation) with inflammation in non-alcoholic patients. Several researches have suggested that oxidative stress play an important role in the progress of simple steatosis to NASH as the ''second-hit'' hypothesis. In that line, we employed a manganese superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, EUK-8 and Vitamin C in an experimental model of NASH. Disease was induced in male N-Mary rats, weighing 200-250 g, by methionine -choline deficient (MCD) diet for 14 weeks. The animals were randomly distributed into four groups of five and were fed orally: the control group was fed a normal diet plus the vehicle; the MCD group received a MCD diet plus the vehicle; the MCD + EUK-8 group was fed a MCD diet with EUK-8 (30 mg/kg/day); the MCD + vitamin C group was fed a MCD diet plus vitamin C (30 mg/kg/day). Steatosis, ballooning and inflammation were observed in MCD fed rats. EUK-8 and Vitamin C attenuated these hepatic features in this group. The sera transferases activities in MCD fed rats were increased relative to the control rats. Our findings showed significant decrease in alanine transferase, aspartate transferase, alkaline phosphatase and glutathione transferase activities among MCD fed treated rats. Thus, results confirmed the hepatoprotective efficacy of EUK-8 and vitamin C in NASH murine model. Lumican acts as an endogenous inhibitor of TGFb2 activity in Saos 2 osteosarcoma cells J.

Secreted lumican was found to regulate the growth as well as the migration and chemotaxis of osteosarcoma cells. In this study, lumican-deficient Saos 2 cells were demonstrated to have increased adhesive capability onto fibronectin (FN) (p \u00a3 0.01). Upon neutralization of endogenous transforming growth factor b2 (TGF-b2) activity, no difference in the ability of lumican siRNA-transfected and scramble siRNA-transfected Saos 2 cells to adhere onto FN was detected (p = NS).

Yokota Pamukkale UniversityObjectives: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) PTEN gene is frequently inactivated. However, it still remains unclear whether this gene is involved in the regulation of metastasis potential in lung cancer cells. Methods: PTEN cDNA isolated and cloned into TETON vector. PTENG129R and PTENG129E mutants are established by site directed mutagenesis reaction. Stable transfection was conformed by FUGEN HD and NFkB activity detected by using Lusiferase gene reporter system. Results: our results indicate that PTEN expression is very important for normal lung cells and most of lung cancer cell lines do not express PTEN tumor suppressor gene, and there is a correlation between PTEN expression loss and increased AKT activity. We also found that stable wt PTEN expression, which was stable transfected in no PTEN expressed NSCLC, is suppressed the cell invasion 72%. For the determination of the mechanisms, we created PTENG129R and PTEN129E mutants vectors which are catalytically inactive and lipidphosphatase death PTENs respectively. Constitutive expression of wild type PTEN, but not neither catalytically inactive mutant (PTENG129R) or Lipid phosphatase death mutant (PTENG129E) reduced phosphorylation on Ser-473 of AKT, leading to inactivation of NFkB, and the cellular invasion in NSCLC cell line PC14. Moreover we showed that only continuously AKT expression is enough for the induce invasion of NIH3T3 cells. Conclusions: PTEN tumor suppressor gene product can control Akt and NFkB activation. Knowing that NFkB is a transcriptional activator which regulates survival pathways, and that metastasis is a process related with cell survival, one can comprehend the presence of a possible interaction between metastasis and NFkB activation. We conclude that PTEN is suffient to reduce the invasive potential of NSCLC cell invasion by lipid phosphatase activity which implies that PI3K/AKT/NFkB/Twist pathway is important to invasiveness on NSCLC.

Besides some well characterized functions in mitochondria (Landriscina et al., 2010; Altieri et al., 2009). TRAP1plays an important role in protein-quality control in different subcellular compartments. In fact preliminary data by our group identified by mass spectrometry analysis as a putative interacting protein TBP7, an AAA-ATPase of the 19S proteasomal subunit. TRAP1 and TBP7 colocalize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The analysis of cellular lysates in which TRAP1 and/or TBP7 are silenced, shows an increased intracellular protein ubiquitination, both in total lysates and in subfractions of cytosol and ER. These experiments led us to hypothesise for TRAP1 and TBP7 a role in protein quality control for newly synthesized proteins on ER; in fact, misfolded proteins emerging from ER are controlled by a large number of molecular chaperones and, if the quality control fails, they are retrotranslocated, ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasome. RT/PCR data show that in cells in which TRAP is stably silenced the basal levels of Bip mRNA, a member of HSP70 family, involved in the refolding of damaged proteins are lower, while highly increase, respect to control cells, after thapsigargin-induced ER stress. These preliminary data suggest that TRAP1interference sensitizes cells to stress stimuli, regulating the levels of chaperones involved in stress responses and controlling, with TBP7, the ubiquitination of damaged proteins in ER.S.

SenFaculty of Arts & Sciences, Department of Biology, Pamukkale University, 20070 Denizli, TurkeyCytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are major players in the phase I oxidative metabolism of wide range of xenobiotics and endobiotics. It is well established that CYP1A1/1A2 and CYP2E1 enzymes are mainly involved in carcinogen metabolism but, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes enable mainly drug metabolisms. CYP2B6 is another isozyme that metabolizes several important pharmaceutics. CYP enzymes activities and expression can be profoundly altered by many herbs. Cyclamen is one of the widely used herbs for treatment of hemoroids, eczema and expelling digestive tract worms in Turkey. Therefore, in this study we have investigated the effect of extracts obtained from cyclamen tubers on the mRNA expression levels of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 enzymes in human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa). In this respect; the aim of this study is to determine the effect of ethanol extracts of cyclamen's tubers on hepatic CYP450 isozymes. For this purpose, the mRNA expression levels of CYP isozymes were determined after incubating HeLa cells with cyclamen tuber extract with 150 lg/ ml for 48 hours. The mRNA levels of CYP isozymes were determined by RT-PCR. mRNA levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 increase 13% and 51% as a result of Cyclamen treatment, respectively.

These results indicate that cyclamen tuber extract might have a potential not only to inhibit and/or induct the metabolism of certain co-administered drugs but also development of toxicity and carcinogenesis due to induction of the cytochrome P450 dependent drug metabolizing enzymes.L.

DDC gene was found to be significantly overexpressed in PCa patients compared to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) control ones, as well as its overexpression follows the aggressive phenotype of the disease. Materials & Methods: DDC expression was quantified, using Real-Time PCR methodology, in 70 prostatic tissue specimens obtained from PCa patients that underwent radical prostatectomy. Moreover, the expression levels of the miR-145, which represents a predicted post-transcriptional regulator of DDC expression, was determined in the abovementioned PCa specimens and 60 control prostatic tissues from patients with BPH. Results: An approximately threefold risk for biochemical recurrence revealed for the DDC-positive PCa patients compared with DDC-negative ones (p = 0.021). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis pointed out the significant reduced disease-free survival (DFS) of the DDC-positive in relation to DDC-negative Finally, shorter DFS period is expected for the PCa patients with decreased miR-145 expression levels (p = 0.013). Conclusion: DDC expressional levels are inverse correlated to DDC predicted miRNA regulator miR-145, throughout the progression of PCa aggressive phenotype and serves as a novel predictor of the PCa patients' prognosis.",

Komisarenko Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kiev, UkraineBackground: Development of advanced nanotechnology for drug production with high efficiency based on biocompatible polymers is of the great importance for developing personalized cancer therapy. Substance that was used as the basis for a new drug -EMAP II -endothelial and monocyte activating polypeptide II. This cytokine-like molecule has an apoptosis-inducing effect, acting at the same time as angiogenesis inhibiting factor in the development of tumor vascular system and leading to tumor growth inhibition. Dextran-70, polysaccharide, that is well-known as a biocompatible polymer, composed of a-D-glucopyranose residues, was used in this study as a stabilizing nanocomposite component, cryoprotector and filler. Materials and Methods: Recombinant protein EMAP II, obtained by expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE cells using pET30a-EMAP II vector was used in this study. Recombinant protein was purified using the metal chelate affinity chromatogra-phy on Ni-NTA agarose and further purified after splitting by enterokinase, with further sterilization by cold filtration. Nanocomposite complex was prepared by adding 1,5% dextran-70 to EMAP II solution. For testing nanocomposite antitumor activity renal subcapsular Bohden test was applied to CBA line mice. Results: 55% xenografts of the control group had more than 50% weight gain. While investigating the antitumor activity of 10 lg/kg of the EMAP II based nanocomposite, 17.7% xenografts weight gain was estimated, which means that nanocomposite provided 77% inhibition of tumor growth. 58% of xenografts were shown to have a complete tumor regress. The effect triggered by the nanocomposite complex can be considered as the tumor growth inhibition. Conclusion:EMAP II based nanocomposite complex with Dextran-70 can be trialed as a stable and efficient drug for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment.Cancer cell motility depends on dynamic changes in cell-cell adhesion process. Homofilic intercellular interactions are mainly regulated by the proteins involved in forming adherens junctions. Two of thema-catenin and b-catenin play a key role in binding transmembrane E-cadherins to actin filaments and consequently regulate the strength of intercellular interaction. In current study we used RNAi process to observe the a-catenin and b-catenin effect on three different human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines migration (LS180, LoVo and BE). The migration capacity of LS180 cells were significantly lower than LoVo and BE cells. We observed the correlation between high cell motility of LoVo cells was accompanied by the low protein expression level of a-catenin and b-catenin. In contrast, the migration of BE cells was correlated with smaller amounts of E-cadherin. Silencing of b-catenin in LS 180 cells caused a significant increase in their motility through Transwell filters. However, we didn't observe such effect in the case of BE and LoVo cells. Reduction of a-catenin expression by siRNA had no influence on migration capacities of all investigated cell lines. The migration ability of colon adenocarcinoma variant cells with overexpression of acatenin and b-catenin are under investigation. The results will allow us to verify the real effect of catenins on colon cancer cell migration. The work was supported by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education, grand no. N N302 138035.",

Yasasever Oncology Institute, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey IFN-c is a cytokine that is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control. It plays an important role in the growth and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells, activates NK cells and acts as a B cell maturation factor. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules and has a role in the activation of several matrix metalloproteinases. EMMPRIN is expressed in areas of tissue remodeling, including tumors, placenta, skin and regions undergoing angiogenesis. It is also expressed in cells with high metabolic activity, such as lymphoblasts, macrophages and tumor cells. Head and neck cancers are revealed in the cells that line the mucosal surfaces in the head and neck area, e.g. mouth, nose, and throat. In order to understand the correlation between the expression of IFN-c and EMMPRIN, we have studied two tests with nasopharynx and larynx cancer patients. Method: Our study group consists of 40 nasopharynx and 20 larynx cancer patients in the University of Istanbul, Institute of Oncology and 20 healthy subjects. The serum levels were measured by ELISA. Statistical differences have been determined with SPSS 16. Result: The serum levels of IFN-c in patients with larynx cancer (p = 0.03) and in patients with nasopharynx cancer (p = 0.009) are significantly higher than serum levels of IFN-c in healthy controls. The serum levels of EMMPRIN in patients with larynx cancer (p < 0.01) are significantly higher than the serum levels of EMMPRIN in healthy controls, but we could not find any significant difference (p > 0.05) between the serum levels of EMM-PRIN with nasopharynx cancer and the healthy controls. Conclusion: Our data indicate that high serum levels of IFN-c can be used as a diagnostic parameter for nasopharynx and larynx cancer. EMMPRIN can be useful only at the diagnosis of larynx cancer.

Antioxidant selenoprotein GPX1 metabolizing H2O2 to O2 and H2O, is downregulated in many cancers and potentially has tumor suppressive features. Indeed, GPX1 overexpression was found to delay growth of the endothelial cell line, ECV304. GPX1 was downregulated in 100% of cRCC samples in comparison to surrounding normal tissue. No significant association was found between gene expression level and gender or age, though its expression has a trend to correlate with histological grade. All CpG islands were found unmethylated. Then, GPX1 was tested for homozygous deletion in RCC and BC in comparison with RASSF1A and SEMA3B. Using multiplex PCR, HDs were detected in GPX1 gene in these tumors with frequencies of up to 12%, and in RASSF1A and SEMA3B with frequencies of up to 11% and 8%, respectively. As a main result, a novel TSG GPX1 was found in MECA3 region.HIF-2a, which is closely related to HIF-1a, could regulate unique genes and physiological functions. So far, distinct roles for HIF-1a versus HIF-2a in promoting tumor growth have been mostly clearly defined in clear cell renal carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer and neuroblastoma where the role for HIF-2a as a driver of a more aggressive disease has been recently highlighted. Nevertheless, little is known about the HIF-2a regulation in these cancer lineages. Herein, we report for the first time that SphK1 signaling controls HIF-2a activity in various cancer cell models including RCC. First, we show that up-regulation of SphK1 activity precedes HIF-2a accumulation under hypoxia. Second, pharmacological inhibition or siRNA strategy against SphK1 decreases the content and the transcriptional activity of HIF-2a. Third, we establish that early activation of Phospholipase D (PLD) is responsible for the up-regulation of SphK1 under hypoxia, and that inhibition of PLD leads to a decrease in SphK1 activity and in HIF-2a activity. Overall, we have identified a new molecular mechanism whereby a PLD/SphK1 signaling pathway regulates HIF-2a accumulation and activity. Thus, targeting SphK1 may represent an innovative therapeutic strategy for suppressing HIF2a in RCC and other cancers in which HIF2a has been implicated.A. Carracedo, D. Weiss, A. K. Leliaert, M.

Chen Division of Molecular Radiation Biology, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas Texas, USAOf the different types of DNA damage that occur in human cells, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious. The inability to repair DSBs can result in genomic instability, carcinogenesis, or cell death. The cellular response to DSBs is a complex process that includes recognition of the DNA damage, activation of signaling pathways including cell cycle checkpoints, and repair of the DNA lesions. Two important proteins that are required for the cellular response to DSBs are the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein. DNA-PKcs and ATM belong to the PI3K-like family of serine/threonine protein kinases. Both kinases are rapidly activated in response to DSBs and play important roles in transducing the damage signal and for the repair of the DNA damage. In this study, we compared and contrasted the recruitment and retention of each protein to DSBs. Both proteins were shown to rapidly localize to DSBs, but DNA-PKcs reached its maximal level faster (10 minutes) than ATM (20 minutes). Although DNA-PKcs and ATM both rapidly associate to DSBs, their dissociation from DSBs is markedly different. DNA-PKcs rapidly dissociates from DSBs with only 20% of the protein still at DSBs 2 hours following introduction of the damage while 60% of ATM is still present at DSBs 2 hours later. Fluorescence after photobleaching data shows that the DNA-PKcs-DSB interaction is much tighter than that of ATM-DSB. Previous studies have shown that the phosphorylation status of ATM and DNA-PKcs play an important role in the dynamics of each protein at DNA DSBs. We found that autophosphorylation of ATM is not required for localization to DSBs as a kinase dead and a serine 1981 mutant form of ATM localizes to DSBs. But unlike wildtype ATM, both the 1981 mutant and kinase dead version of ATM rapidly dissociated from DSBs. Similar to ATM, phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs does not play a role in the ability of the protein to localize to DSBs. However, unlike ATM, ablation of phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs results in sustained retention of the protein to DSBs. These data show that although DNA-PKcs and ATM share many characteristics, including being recruited to and activated by DSBs, overall their dynamics at DSBs are clearly different with the phoshphorylation status of the protein playing an important role. mediated Src activation is critical for oncogenic Ras to induce tumor invasionP.-C. Chan and H.-C. Chen Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, TaiwanThe oncogenic Ras and the aberrant activation of Src are frequently detected in human cancers. However, the causal relationship between oncogenic Ras and Src activation remains largely unknown. In this study, we find that depletion of oncogenic Ras in human cancer cell lines harboring oncogenic mutations in ras genes leads to suppression in Src activity. Conversely, overexpression of oncogenic Ras induces Src activation. The activation of Src by oncogenic Ras is occurred mainly on the Golgi complex. Through short-hairpin RNA-based screening, we identify p120RasGAP as an effector for oncogenic Ras to activate Src. The recruitment of p120RasGAP to the Golgi complex by oncogenic Ras facilitates its interaction with Src, thereby leading to Src activation. Furthermore, Ras-induced activation of Src selectively stimulates the JNK pathway, which is important for oncogenic Ras to induce tumor invasion and metastasis. Collectively, our findings unveil a relationship between oncogenic Ras, p120RasGAP, and Src, and implicate a critical role for Src in cancers evoked by oncogenic Ras.F. Chiaradonna, D.

Aberrant miRNA expression can influence several gene networks and pathways implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis formation. To reveal miRNAs involved in breast cancer progression we investigated miRNA expression in 77 ductal breast carcinoma biopsies and 17 mammoplasties by microarray analysis. 16 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified comparing patients with or without disease relapse, within 72 months from surgery. When putative miRNA target analysis for the relapse-signature miRNAs was performed, employing Targetscan, 6,114 potential targets were found. By applying Ingenuity Pathway Analysis systems (IPA) to the entire set of targets, a significant and specific enrichment for 62 cancer related pathways was found; examples are integrins, mTOR, PI3K/AKT and ERK/ MAP signaling pathways. Among the deregulated miRNAs, miR-148b, down-regulated in more aggressive breast tumors, was able to predict survival per se and to coordinate tumor cell growth and progression as well as chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via a novel pathway involving over 36 genes such as the adhesion receptor ITGA5 and its downstream players ROCK1, PIK3CA/ p110alpha, NRAS as well as CSF1, MMP15, BCL2, CDK6 and FZD5. Among them ITGA5, ROCK1, PIK3CA/p110alpha and CSF1 were found to be direct targets of miR-148b. Our findings underline the relevance of the identified relapse-signature for patient prognosis and suggest a critical role for miR-148b in breast cancer progression and response to chemotherapy.P11.25 ''Effects of genetic variants of CCR5 chemokin receptors on oral squamose cell carcinoma'' Z.

Infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric MALT lymphoma, and gastric carcinoma. Virulent H. pylori strains contain a cag type IV secretion system (T4SS) that injects the CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells leading to the activation of host signaling pathways that result in cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell elongation and scattering. Aim: To investigate the role of H. pylori on gastric epithelial cell invasion, a phenotype characterized by increased capacity of the host cells to degrade and invade the extracellular matrix, and to explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: Using Matrigel and collagen type I invasion assays we found that H. pylori induces AGS cell invasion, and studies with different bacterial strains showed that this capacity is dependent on the presence of the cag T4SS. Experiments with chemical inhibitors and siRNAs showed that H. pylori-induced cell invasion is mediated by c-Met receptor activation, and is accompanied by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. Further experiments targeting known downstream c-Met signaling molecules revealed that Nck, c-Src, PLC-c, and FAK are involved in H. pylori-induced cell invasion. Conclusions/Relevance: The dissection of this pathway involved in cell invasion induced by H. pylori will allow a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this bacterial infection and may contribute to disclose novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.E. Crowley, S. Arena, and A. Bardelli Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, IRCC, University of Turin Medical School, Turin, ItalyThis project aims to assess, at a cellular level, the functional role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs61764370 identified in genome-wide association studies as contributing to tumour progression. The SNP, located in the miRNA let-7 complementary site (mLCS6) in the 3' UTR of KRAS, has been associated with an increased risk of developing NSCLC in moderate smokers, reduced survival in oral and colorectal cancers and responses to targeted therapy. The SNP is thought to weaken let-7 miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of KRAS mRNA resulting in increased expression of the protein. To investigate the biological and functional characteristics of the SNP rs61764370 a method to ''knock-in'' the genetic risk variant, using AAV mediated homologous recombination, into the genome of human cells was employed. Sequencing within the 3'UTR to assess ''risk associated'' SNP status of several cell lines led to the selection of SW48 as an appropriate parental model for subsequent knock in experiments. High sequence conservation of the 3'UTRs required that the recombinant AAV construct be identical to the genomic DNA of SW48. Consequently the region of SW48 genomic DNA involved in homologous recombination was sequenced to ensure perfect homology between construct and genomic DNA. The recombinant AAV plasmid was generated by GeneScript (Piscataway, USA.) and used to produce the recombinant AAV virus. Following cellular infection of the parental SW48 cell line clonal colonies were generated from single cells and homologous recombination verified using a PCR screening technique. Future work will involve biological and functional profiling of the SNP knock-in model system to establish whether there is a link between the rs61764370 SNP and cancer susceptibility.M. D.

A significant part of the PTH bone anabolic action is attributed to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) stimulation. Furthermore, FGF2 is known to regulate the expression of the small leucinerich proteoglycans (SLRPs), established component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and of great importance to osteosarcoma cell functions. In this study we investigated the possible participation of FGF2-signaling on the PTH-dependent osteosarcoma cell migration. We utilized MG63 osteosarcoma cell line as a model system with real-time PCR, western blotting, ''wound healing'' assay and RNA interference as techniques of choice. FGF2 treatment of osteosarcoma cells resulted in a significant, similar to PTH, increase (p < 0.01) in MG63 cell migration. The mRNA expression analysis of cells treated with PTH, showed a strong increase of FGF2 transcript levels (p = 0.0015). Interestingly, the addition of FGF2 to MG63 cells demonstrated a significant downregulation of the SLRP biglycan expression both at the mRNA (p \u00a3 0.0001) and protein (60%) level. In order to examine the significance of biglycan on MG63 cell migration, transfection with short interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for biglycan was performed, resulting in a significant increase (p \u00a3 0.01) in the migration capacity of biglycan-deficient MG63 cells. Finally, a direct correlation between PTH (1-34) action and biglycan expression was established by determining a significant decrease (p = 0.01) in biglycan transcript levels in PTH treated cells. In conclusion, PTH(1-34) upregulates MG63 cell migration through the enhancement of FGF2 activation, correlated to alterations in biglycan expression.A. Di Savino 1 , A. Morotti 2 , R.

Its downregulation promotes the interaction between ROCK II and nucleophosmin, leading to an increased ROCK II kinase activity, which results in centrosome amplification. morgana+/) primary cells display an increased susceptibility to neoplastic transformation and morgana +/) mice are more prone to tumour development after treatment with the chemical carcinogen DMBA.(Ferretti et al., Dev.

To further characterize the role of morgana haploinsufficiency in tumor onset, we assess the susceptibility of morgana +/) mice to spontaneous tumor formation.Here we show that about 50% of morgana+/) mice get sick and die mostly between 12 and 16 months of age. Morgana haploinsufficiency in mice induces with age a fatal myeloproliferative disorder like-chronic myeloid leukemia (MPD like-CML) manifested by severe anemia, significant leukocytosis with neutrophilia in the peripheral blood along with myeloid hyperproliferation in the bone marrow and spleen and myeloid cell infiltration of liver. In addition, the morgana heterozygous cohort developed more frequently lung tumours. Taken together, our data propose Morgana as a bona fide suppressor of MPD in mice and raise the possibility that Morgana dysfunction contributes to the development of hematologic malignancies in humans.P.

Defilippi University of Turin p140Cap is an adaptor protein that has been shown suppress the tumour cell properties, by binding Src and regulating its activation via C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). Interestingly, p140Cap expression is lost in more aggressive human breast cancers, showing an inverse correlation between p140Cap expression and tumour aggression. Therefore, p140Cap mechanistically behaves as tumour suppressor that inhibits signalling pathways leading to aggressive phenotypes. In order to examine the tumour suppressor role of p140Cap, we chose Her2/Neu model of breast cancer. When overexpressed or mutated, Her2/Neu induces neoplastic transformation, increasing proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis via Src, PI3K, MAPK and Rho GTPase. Moreover, Her2 distrupts the apical polarity of epithelial cells and tissue organization, binding two proteins of polarity complex Par6/aPKC and causing Par3 and Zo-1 mislocalization from tight junction. Here, by in vivo analysis of MMTV-p140Cap and MMTV-NeuT transgenic mice, we report that p140Cap delays tumour insurgence in MMTV-NeuT transgenic mice and inhibits tumour properties of MMTV -NeuT derived cancer cells.

Although Ruk/CIN85 appears to modulate tyrosine kinase receptors and PI3 kinase signalling, the exact molecular mechanisms by which Ruk/CIN85 affects carcinogenesis are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the oncogenic potential of Ruk/CIN85 by overexpressing the fulllength isoform in weakly invasive MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. The Rukl/CIN85 overexpressing cells showed a slower growth rate, decreased cell adhesion, and an enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Transwell migration and wound healing assays revealed that Rukl/CIN85 overexpressing cells possessed increased motility. Stable overexpression of Rukl/ CIN85 also induced hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein level and HIF-1 activity under hypoxia as well as increased activity of NF-kappaB transcription factor. Further, overexpression of Rukl/CIN85 affected EGF-dependent signalling: activation of both Akt and ERK1/2 was faster in comparison with control cells and both kinases remained in its active state for up to 30 minutes after EGF treatment. Together, these findings suggest that high level of Rukl/CIN85 can modulate EGF-dependent signalling and contributes to the conversion of breast adenocarcinoma cells into a more malignant phenotype.P11.38The analysis of mutations in the EGFR, KRAS and BRAF genes using hybridization with hydrogel biochipsM.

Nasedkina 1 1 Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Moscow, Russian Federation 2 Blokhin Cancer Research Center Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation 3 Medical Genetic Center, Moscow, Russian FederationThe Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose overexpression is observed in many types of cancers. Specific EGFR inhibitors such as anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib) have been developed and used for the treatment of several types of cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer. Somatic mutations in the EGFR gene and key effectors along the EGFR signaling pathway (KRAS and BRAF) are associated with the sensitivity to these drugs. To determine the mutational status of genes EGFR, KRAS and BRAF we have developed biochip allowing to choose an optimal treatment for each patient individually. The biochip detects following genetic events: -13 mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of the KRAS gene; mutation in codon 600 of the BRAF gene.The technique of blocking (clamping) of wild-type sequences with a synthetic nucleotide analogue (locked nucleic acid or ''LNA'') was used for specific amplification of mutant fragments in a large excess of wild-type DNA. The amplified fragments were labeled via incorporation of fluorescently labeled dTTP during the second round of PCR. To prove the feasibility of the method the clinical samples from patients with pancreatic cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer were analyzed. We consider that biochip-based approach with LNA-clamp PCR can be a useful tool for screening of mutations in the EGFR, KRAS and BRAF genes and hence for identification of the patients which will respond to anti-EGFR targeted therapies.L.

Despite the complex correlation of dysregulated periostin expression levels both in physiological and neoplastic conditions, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying its transcriptional control.Here, we report the initial characterization of the human POSTN gene promoter and show that its activity in HeLa cells depends on the binding of YingYang-1 (YY1) zinc finger transcription factor. We mapped, by ChIP and EMSA analysis, the functional YY1-binding site on human POSTN gene promoter at position -604. In order to define the functional role of YY1 binding on the expression of the human periostin gene, we performed RNA interference experiments to knock down endogenous YY1 and analyzed the effects on periostin mRNA levels. We found, by RT-PCR experiments, a consistent and reproducible increase of POSTN transcript in the HeLa cells silenced for YY1. Conversely, over-expression of YY1 results in a significant down regulation of POSTN gene when compared to control HeLa cells. Next, ChIP and sequential ChIP showed that the repression observed on POSTN gene expression is not solely ascribable to the YY1 activity. In fact, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that YY1 interact with BRCA1 to form a complex that co-ordinately represses POSTN expression via the functional YY1-binding site. These findings shed light in the transcriptional control of the POSTN gene expression and provide evidences supporting the potential role of this protein in BRCA1-dependent tumorigenesis.",

The aim of this work was to evaluate changes in gene expression in gastric cells induced by H. pylori. The human gastric carcinoma-derived cell line AGS was infected with H. pylori strain 60190 (ATCC 49503) for 24 hours. Variations of gene expression were evaluated using an oligonucleotide microarray (Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit Agilent). H. pylori significantly changed the expression of 562 genes (266 genes up-and 296 genes down-regulated). Gene ontology and enriched pathways were determined using DAVID (Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery v6.7). This revealed deregulation of 10 major biological processes: response to stress, transcription regulation, cell signalling, cellular homeostasis, cell cycle, cell motility, metabolic processes, molecular transport, angiogenesis and morphogenesis. Five cellular functions related to ion binding, cytokine activity, growth factors, kinase inhibition and catalysis were altered by the infection. Signalling pathways influenced by the bacterium were related with inflammation, metabolism, activation of MAPK, and pathways in cancer. Protein functional interaction analysis performed in STRING v8.3 (highest stringent score and cluster mean of 4), exposed a complex network of protein interactions involved in inflammation, metabolic processes, cell growth and migration. Array validation was performed by real-time PCR for a set of genes which were at least two fold-changed. Target validation by additional experiments with other cell lines and bacterial strains, including mutants for virulence factors, is ongoing. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori-induced host epithelial cell responses will improve the understanding of H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis and may reveal novel candidates for therapeutic intervention.",

In mammalian cells it forms a complex with Hsp90, ROCK I and II and directly binds ROCK II inhibiting its kinase activity (Ferretti R. et al.,Dev.  Cell, 2010). Furthermore it has been described as a stress responsive protein with an intrinsic chaperone activity. It behaves like an Hsp90 co-chaperone (Michowski W. et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 2010). Human tumor tissue arrays reveal that Morgana expression is reduced in a large fraction of samples, but interestingly the protein is strongly up-regulated in a subset of them. Here we show that NIH3T3 overexpressing Morgana are transformed in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore NIH overexpressing Morgana are more resistant to different apoptotic stimuli (detachment, serum starvation, DNA damage induced by etoposide). Our results suggest that Morgana acts as an anti-apoptotic factor by inhibiting ROCK kinase activity. In fact cells overexpressing Morgana show a reduction in MLC-2 phosphorylation. In addition with constitutively active ROCK Morgana overexpressing cells loose their ability to grow in soft agar and show a restoration of apoptosis sensitivity. Moreover, by the analysis of Morgana level in different tumor cell lines, we also found the up-regulation of the protein in cancer cell lines. To assess the role of Morgana overexpression in breast carcinoma, expression of endogenous Morgana is knocked down in breast cancer cells using shRNA. Silenced cells show reduced ability to grow in soft agar and higher rate of apoptotis upon etoposide treatment. These results provide novel evidence of the important role of Morgana overexpression in conferring cells some oncogenic hallmarks.M.N. Gadaleta 1,2 , F. Guerra 1 , I. Kurelac 3 , A. Cormio 1 , R.

Patol, Bari University Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been described in almost all types of cancer. However, their exact role and timing of occurrence during tumor development and progression are still a matter of debate. MtDNA has been scarcely investigated in type I endometrial carcinoma (EC) despite the fact that mitochondrial biogenesis increase has been reported (Cormio A. et al., 2009). Here we screened a panel of 23 type I endometrial carcinoma tissues and matched hyperplasia for mutations in mtDNA and in the 4 canonical oncosupressors/oncogenes involved in progression, namely PTEN, KRAS, CTNNB1 and TP53.Overall mtDNA mutations were identified in 69% of cases, while mutational events in nuclear genes occurred in 56% of the cases. These data suggest that mtDNA mutations may precede genetic instability of the genes canonically involved in progression from hyperplasia to tumor. Moreover, we detected correlation between pathogenic mtDNA mutations and the oncocytic phenotype in type I EC. Increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and activation of oxidative stress response mechanisms in tumor tissues in correlation with the occurrence of pathogenic mtDNA mutations were found. Since mtDNA mutations occur after hyperplasia, a potential role in contributing to genetic instability may be envisioned and they may be considered biomarkers for distinction of tumor from hyperplastic tissue.

Here we show that breast cancer cells lines with PI3KCA mutations (T-47D) or with different genetic alterations (MDA-MB-231) are dependent by PDK1 for the growth in absence of adhesion and tumor formation in mice. Indeed, the reduction of PDK1 activity by RNAi or chemical molecules strongly inhibits the growth in soft-agar of these cell lines and increases their sensitivity to anoikis. Nevertheless, PDK1 down-regulation does not alter the proliferation rate of these cells when grown in adhesion. PDK1-silenced cells exhibit reduced the growth of experimental tumors by increasing the apoptosis inside the tumors. Re-expression of wild-type PDK1 in silenced cells rescues the phenotype while PDK1 kinase-dead does not. The requirement of the kinase activity is in contrast with the unaltered phosphorylation of Akt in MDA-MB-231 cells. The involvement of Akt1, as possible PDK1 downstream effector in the MDA-MB-231 cells, has been excluded by the introduction in PDK1-silenced cells of a constitutively active form of Akt1, which is unable to rescue the impaired phenotype. These results suggest a widespread role of PDK1 in breast cancer that is not exclusively related to tumors harboring oncogenic mutation in the PI3K pathway. On the other hand, we proved that the PDK1 role in breast cancer can be independent from Akt that is still considered the main PI3K downstream effector.P11.49Fe65 in the response to DNA damage A.

Minopoli Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universitad egli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy, CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate s.c.a.r.l., Napoli, Italy, SEMM European School of Molecular Medicine, Napoli, Italy The function of the b-amyloid precursor protein APP is still not completely understood. A possible starting point to address the question of the function of APP is the well demonstrated interaction of its cytodomain with the adaptor protein Fe65. The phenotype of Fe65 KO mice suggested that this protein could play some role in DNA damage response (DDR). In fact, Fe65 null mice show high sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Furthermore suppression of Fe65 in cultured cells hampers DNA repair. Strong evidence indicates that DDR could be a crucial barrier against cell transformation. To address the possibility that Fe65 could be involved in tumorigenesis, we examined the effect of Fe65 suppression in cell transformation. We observed that Fe65 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in the number of colonies of NIH3T3 cells transformed by oncogenic Ras. This phenotype was rescued by wild type Fe65 but not by Fe65 mutant unable to interact with Tip60 histone acetyl-transferase. Experiments in mouse models of tumorigenesis confirmed the apparent role of Fe65 as a tumor suppressor. Indeed, haploinsufficiency of Fe65 greatly accelerated the appearance of the lymphomas in tEl-myc mice. The weakening of DDR provoked by Fe65 haploinsufficiency was confirmed in cells treated with IR or DNA damaging agents or transiently transfected with Myc, thus suggesting that Fe65 suppression affects tumorigenesis by hampering DDR. Further experiments in vitro and in vivo suggest that ligands of the central PTB of Fe65, like Tip60, play a crucial role in the function of chromatin-associated Fe65. C. Giaccherini, M. Ceriani and E. Martegani Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126 Milan, Italy Ral proteins are members of the Ras GTPase superfamily and localize at the plasma membrane, in endocytic and exocytic vesicles and in synaptic vesicles. These GTPases are involved in multiple cellular events including proliferation, migration, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, vesicular transport, exocytosis and receptor endocytosis. They are also implicated in tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. RalGPS2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RalA belonging to RalGPS family. It is a 590 aminoacids polypeptide that contains a well conserved Ras-GEF domain, a PxxP motif and a PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain. Previous experiments have demonstrated that RalGPS2 can activate RalA in vivo, while the PH-PxxP domain acts as a dominant negative for RalA activation in both NIH3T3 and PC12 cells. These data suggest that the PH-PxxP domain of RalGPS2 could inhibit RalA activation, thus influencing cytoskeleton rearrangement.The principal aim of this work is to analyze the role of RalGPS2 and of its PH-PxxP domain in human and rodent cells transformation. In particular our attention was been focused on transformed murine fibroblasts (NIH3T3 k-Ras) and on human bladder cancer cells (5637 cell line). We found that RalA and RalGPS2 were highly expressed in 5637 human bladder cancer cells and that the overexpression of PH-PxxP domain reduced the level of active RalA bound at GTP. Furthermore the expression of PH and PH-PxxP domains in both NIH3T3 k-ras and 5637 cell line, induced a marked cytoskeleton re-organization.In particular PH domain caused formation of thin protrusions with the presence of vesicles. PH-PxxP domain caused formation of long inter-cellular structure that are probably involved in the exchange of signals and cellular components between different cells. It will be interesting in the future to understand the molecular nature of these ''hairy'' structures that could be nanotubes. Partially supported by a CIB fellowship to CG.",

Cellular, biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of control of cancerous tissue growth are not clear yet. Conventional in vitro model to explore these mechanisms in the prostate is LNCaP cell line culture (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate). Recombinant proteins (hormones, antibodies etc.) are widely used as medicines for treatment and prevention of oncological diseases. We studied the effect of the recombinant endothelial -monocyte activating polypeptide II, EMAP II, on growth, proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells. Biotechnology of bacterial expression and purification of EMAP II has been earlier presented in detail (Dubrovskiy A.L. et al, 2000). The protein was stabilized by reagent D (conditional name). The final concentrations of EMAP II in culture medium were 0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 lg/ml. Cells were cultivated for 24 hours, then fixed and stained with hematoxilin. Apoptosis was evidenced by the appearance of apoptotic bodies and nuclear DNA defragmentation as assayed by TUNEL technique. Effects of EMAP II were dose-dependent. Under exposure to the minimum EMAP II concentration, the number of mitotic cells was significantly less as compared to the control, but monolayer density was visually unchanged. Typical signs of apoptosis were found as result of exposure to EMAP II concentration of 0.1 lg/ml. When the maximum EMAP II dose was used, no signs of cells in anaphase were found. We observed the chromatin condensation and nuclei fragmentation. Thus, under the highest dose, there was almost complete destruction of the cell monolayer. EMAP II proapoptotic effect was confirmed by calcium imaging. Our findings demonstrate antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of EMAP II in LNCaP cell line.M. Feracci, O. Bornet, M. Nouailler, A. Badache and F. Guerlesquin CNRSOverexpression of ErbB2 results in a constitutive ligand-independant activation of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways underlying ErbB2-driven cancer progression. Experimental studies have revealed that ErbB2 shows many features of a therapeutic target : ErbB2 is able to confer many characteristics of a cancerous cell, including uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and increased motility (i). Our purpose is to describe the assembly of the supramolecular complexes associated to the C-terminal domain of ErbB2 on the basis of a strong knowledge of the associated interactome to improve the understanding of this complex network. The challenge of this project will be to study macromolecular complexes including a large unstructured domain as an anchoring platform. Previous investigations have evidenced a new pTyr adaptor, MEMO (Mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility), which is associated to a new pTyr motif found in ErbB2 (ii). On the basis of MEMO structure (iii), we have generated a structural model of this complex reporting for the first time the role of histidine residues in the anchoring of pTyr-binding proteins. Moreover, sequence analysis of the C-terminal domain has identified a polyproline type I motif in ErbB2. We are investigating the structural and functional role of this SH3 binding site using an NMR approach.References: 1. Badache A and Gonc\u00b8alves AJ. Mammary Gland Biol.

Sen Faculty of Arts & Sciences, Department of Biology, Pamukkale University, 20070, Denizli, TurkeyEllagic acid is a phenolic compound present in fruits and nuts such as raspberries, strawberries and walnuts. It is known to inhibit certain chemical-induced cancers and may have other chemopreventive properties. Therefore, in this study we have investigated the effect of ellagic acid on the expression of p53 and PTEN in 3T3 (fibroblast), 293 (embriyonic kidney), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and PC-14 (non-smal lung cancer) cell lines. The TD50 of ellagic acid was found to be 0.2 mM for 3T3, MCF-7, PC-14 cell lines and 0.4 mM for 293 cell line. p53 and PTEN protein levels were detected by Western blotting. In control cell lines, both p53 and PTEN protein levels were not changed by ellagic acid treatment. On the other hand, these protein levels were increased around 15% in cancer cell lines. However, these increases were not found to be significant. The results of this study showed that ellagic acid caused increase in p53 and PTEN protein levels in cancer cells without affecting the noncancer cells. Therefore, ellagic acid may be used for alternative therapy instead of cancer chemotherapies that have side effects on normal cells. Further advanced and sophisticated scientific studies should be to elucidate the completely molecular mechanism behind these actions. anti-tumor agent in vitro and in vivoS. -Y. Han, C. O.

A number of small molecules targeting kinases are prescribed in clinics and many kinase inhibitors are being evaluated in the clinical phase. Previously, we discovered a series of aminopyridines substituted with benzoxazole as orally active c-Met kinase inhibitors. One of the compounds, KRC-108, has been evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in vitro and in vivo. A kinase panel assay exhibited that KRC-108 is a potent inhibitor of Ron, Flt3 and TrkA as well as c-Met. Moreover, KRC-108 inhibited oncogenic c-Met M1250T and Y1230D more strongly than wild type c-Met. The anti-proliferative activity of KRC-108 was measured by performing a cytotoxicity assay on a panel of cancer cell lines. The GI(50) values (i.e., 50% inhibition of cell growth) for KRC-108 ranged from 0.01 to 4.22 lM for these cancer cell lines. KRC-108 was also effective for the inhibition of tumor growth in human HT29 colorectal cancer and NCI-H441 lung cancer xenograft models in athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice. This molecule should serve as a useful lead for inhibitors targeting kinases and may lead to new therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.P11.56 The influence of oracin on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and human mammary epithelial cells MCF-10A V. Hanusova, A. Pakostova and L. Skalova Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Hradec Kra\u00b4love\u00b4, Czech Republic Doxorubicin (DOX), anthracycline antibiotic, belongs among the most important antineoplastics used in breast cancer therapy.Unfortunately, the clinical application of DOX is strictly limited his undesirable effects, especially cardiotoxicity. The inhibition of the DOX deactivation in breast cancer cells represents one of possible strategies to improve DOX efficacy. We were studied DOX deactivation and anti-proliferative effect in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and simultaneously influence on the non-cancerous breast cancer cell line MCF-10A. DOX is mainly deactivated by the activity of carbonyl reductases in breast cells. acts as significant inhibitor of DOX reduction in cytosolic fraction from cell homogenates. Using end-point viability tests, the influence of DOX, ORC and DOX+ORC combinations on cell proliferation was assayed and compared in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. In DOX + ORC combinations only noncytotoxic ORC concentrations were used to avoid potential additive toxic effect of ORC. In MCF-7 cells, combination of DOX with 0.5 lM ORC decreased viability by 55% compared to DOX alone. Oppositely, the same combination in cell line MCF-10A showed significantly lower toxicity than DOX alone. Results suggest that concomitant use of ORC and DOX may improve the therapeutic index of DOX in the managements of breast cancer.

Several studies implicated that CAIX could be a prognostic marker in several type of tumor. Therefore, the detection of protein is valuable for clinical studies. In this study, the protein expression of Carbonic anhydrase IX was analysed by flow cytometry in adherent colon carcinoma cells, namely HT-29. In order to optimise the detection of HT-29 cells, several parametres have been assessed. Sample preparation that means produce a suspension of single cells is a very important experimental stage in flow cytometry. Two different methods was used for the preparation of cells to flow cytometry, namely chemical methods Tripsin-EDTA and physical method, cell scrabers tecniques. PE staining Human CAIX monoclonal antibody was used for the detection. . According to the results obtained from this optimization study, cell suspension preparation by cell scraper resulted in the more significantly CAIX protein expression in HT-29 cells than chemical Tripsin-EDTA method. This could be that CAIX that is a membrane protein is likely to being damaged by Tripsin-EDTA method during the treatment. Keywords: carbonic anhydrase IX, flow cytometry, HT-29, cell scraper, tripsin-EDTA Rheum plant extracts which has been used for medical treatment since ancient times. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. In our research, we aimed to study the biological effects of emodin on MCF-7 and MDA-231 cell lines. Cytotoxicity assays and microscope images showed that emodin treatment for 48 hours caused a concentration dependent decrease in viable cell numbers of both cell lines. As determined by cell counting with tryphan blue, IC50 values of emodin were calculated as 8.40 and 12.17 lg/ml for MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells, respectively. The concentration dependent effects of emodin on glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity were measured using CDNB as substrate. Up to 5 lg emodin/ml treatment of MCF-7 cells for 48 hours increased the enzyme activity 2fold with respect to control. However, effect of emodin on GST activity in MDA-231 cells was found insignificant. Apoptotic effects of emodin were examined by analysing the changes in Bcl-2 and Bax gene expressions in microarray data obtained by Affimetrix GeneChip\u00d2 Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array, and further evaluated by qRT-PCR. In MCF-7 cells, Bax expression increased with increasing emodin concentrations, while Bcl-2 expression was downregulated as obtained from qRT-PCR by DDCt method. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was calculated as 9.2fold at 10 lg emodin/ml treatment for 48 hours, indicating stimulation of apoptosis. However, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was found 1.6 fold for MDA-231 cells. These results were in accordance with the results obtained from microarray analysis of related gene expressions. DNA fragmentation was observed in MCF-7 cells by TUNEL method. According to microarray analysis results, emodin affected the gene expressions of GST isozymes in MCF-7 cells much more than in MDA-231 cells.

The growing incidence of drug resistance to cancer chemotherapeutic agent represents a serious medical problem. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new classes of chemotherapeutic agent to treat cancer. A series of cyclohexanone derivatives of curcumin were prepared in our lab and screened for in vitro cytotoxicity.Methods: Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in triplicate against a series of cancer cell lines: Neuroblastoma SK-N-MC, Hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2, nasopharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma KB, leukemic cell K562, Breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis were also observed after treatment of the MCF-7 cells with the potent synthetic compounds after staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide by fluorescence microscopy. Results: The cytotoxicity data of tested compounds demonstrate that these compounds had varying degree of toxicity (IC50 = 0.35 > 10 lg/ml). Analyses of the compounds treated MCF-7 cells by acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining showed that the synthetic compounds induces apoptosis in the cells in a time dependent manner. Conclusion: These results confirm that the heterocyclic cyclohexanone curcumin have the potential to be developed into future anticancer agents.

Two mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases are central for Ras transformation: extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2). We have studied that contribution of JNK2 to Ras transformation utilizing immortalized Jnk2-/-mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which exhibit severely reduced Ras transformation capacity both in vitro and in vivo (Nielsen et al., 2007). Despite being deficient in Ras transformation, the Jnk2-/-MEFs exhibit strong Ras-mediated c-Jun accumulation and activation (Nielsen et al., 2007). To find what other factors are involved instead, we investigated the phosphorylation status of the two oncogenic JNK substrates, ATF2 and c-Myc and found that both their protein and phosphorylation levels were low in Jnk2-/-MEFs. Additionally, the expression of the cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A) was low in Jnk2-/-MEFs in comparison to Jnk1-/or wild type (wt) MEFs. With RNA interference, quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies we identified a novel Ras-activated positive transformation promoting signalling cascade involving JNK2, ERK, CIP2A, c-Myc and ATF2. It begins by Ras activating JNK2 and ERK and leads to increased levels of CIP2A, c-Myc and ATF2. Interestingly, previous studies show that ERK-mediated Ser 62 phosphorylation protects c-Myc from proteosomal degradation. We show here that ERK is not alone sufficient to stabilize c-Myc, but requires the cooperation of CIP2A, an oncogene that counteracts PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of c-Myc. The expression of CIP2A is regulated by JNK2 activated ATF2. With expression array analysis, ChIP, qPCR and luciferase reporter analysis we identified ATF3 as an important downstream target gene of c-Myc and ATF2 in Ras-transformation. These data identify the signal converging point of JNK2 and ERK pathways and underline the central role of CIP2A in Ras transformation. G. Ozturk, B. Altinok, T. Ozkan, I. Yukselen, S. Ilgaz, A. Karadag, N. Ozsoy and A. Sunguroglu Ankara UniversityAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder that results from gaining of malignant characteristics of hematopoetic progenitor cells. Nucleophosmin is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that plays key roles in several cellular processes including ribosome biogene-sis, centrosome duplication, genomic stability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Somatic mutations occurring in exon 12 of the NPM gene (NPM1) are the most common genetic abnormalities seen in AML cases. NPM1 gene mutations are found in 35% of all the AML cases and up to 60% of AML cases carrying these mutations have normal karyotype. AML patients carrying NPM1 mutations have characteristic clinical and prognostic features. In this study, NPM1 gene mutation frequencies are assessed in Turkish AML patients. 44 AML diagnosed patients and 12 healthy controls were admitted to the study. NPM1 mutations were determined by nested PCR assay, genotypes were determined by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and image analyzer system. NPM1 gene mutations were detected in 8 of the 44 (%18, 18) patients but not in healthy controls. NPM1 gene mutations were significantly associated with AML patients with normal karyotype. But the frequency of NPM1 gene mutations in our study was remarkably lower than that of studies came from Europe. Additionally these mutations were associated with old age, high white blood cell count, primer AML, high bone marrow blast percentage, FAB subtype M4 and negative expression of CD34. But these results were not found statistically significant. Finally this assay is a cheap and reproducible method to assess NPM1 mutations in AML. It is thought that the results obtained from this study contribute to routing of the treatment of patients with AML and classification of the disease.P11.64Does hypericin alter the expression of anti-adhesion molecule dysadherin and immunolocalization of fibrous actin in caco-2 cells?A.

It has been reported that the expression of KLF4 is elevated in up to 70% of breast cancers. The present study revealed that KLF4 activates the glycolytic activity through the up-regulation of the platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFKP) in breast cancer cells. The KLF4 activates the transcription of PFKP by the direct binding of KLF4 to the PFKP promoter. The knockdown of KLF4 severely inhibited glucose uptake and lactate production, whereas the overexpression of KLF4 activated them. The effects on glucose utilization by KLF4 coincide with the expression of PFKP. The expressions of other phsophofructokinase isoforms and other glycolytic genes were not affected by KLF4. The association between KLF4 and PFKP was exhibited in breast cancer tissues. The statistically positive correlation was observed between KLF4 and PFKP expression in breast cancer tissues. Also, our results showed that PFKP plays a critical role of glycolytic activity and cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Therefore, our data suggest that KLF4 plays a role in maintenance of high glucose utilization through transcriptional activation of PFKP gene and KLF4 might contributes to progression and development of breast cancer cells.",

Tzanakakis University of Crete, Medical School, Histology/Embryology laboratory, Heraklion, Crete, GreeceHyaluronan is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix that provides tissue homeostasis and is widely known to play a fundamental role in maintaining the ECM architecture. Increased hyaluronan (HA) synthesis has been associated with malignant progression. Previous studies have shown that HA signaling, through its specific receptors CD44 and RHAMM, modulates several cancer cell functions. Specifically, HA was found to regulate migration of fibrosarcoma cells. In the present study we investigated the effect of HA/RHAMM signalling on the adhesion capacity of a fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080) onto fibronectin. An in vitro adhesion assay showed that LMWHA significantly increased (p < 0.05) the adhesion capacity of HT1080 cells, whereas exogenous addition of high molecular weight HA strongly inhibited cell adhesion. Investigation of the possible signaling pathways involved in the regulation of HT1080 cell adhesion showed that ERK inhibition significantly reduced (p < 0.001) LMWHA-dependent adhesion. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that LMWHA enhanced adhesion-dependent HT1080 cell FAK phosphorylation. Western blot and real time PCR analysis indicated that HT1080 cells expressed RHAMM at protein and mRNA level, respectively. Three different protein isoforms were detected at 90, 73 and 45 kDa. LMWHA significantly increased RHAMM transcript (p < 0.05) and protein isoform levels (33%) in fibrosarcoma cells. In order to study the role of RHAMM on the HA signaling-induced changes correlated to HT1080 adhesion capacity, RHAMM expression was inhibited using RNA interference. The ability of HT1080 RHAMM deficient cells to adhere was significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) compared to control cells. Furthermore, their adhesion capacity did not change after addition of LMWHA. RHAMM inhibition also reduced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In conclusion, RHAMM/HA interaction is suggested to regulate fibrosarcoma cell adhesion via the activation of FAK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.P11.73 Mechanisms of the interaction between melanoma cells and cerebral endothelial cellsI.

Therefore, to improve the clinical outcome, more effective and tolerable combination treatment strategies are needed. Here, we show that isochaihulactone (K8) enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptotic death in human lung cancer cells, and the enhancing effect was related to increased NSAID-activated gene-1 (NAG-1) expression. CalcuSyn software was used to evaluate the synergistic interaction of K8 and paclitaxel on human lung cancer cells; the synergistic effect of K8 in combination with paclitaxel was increased more than either of these drugs alone. Furthermore, the activity of ERK1/2 was enhanced by the combination of K8 and paclitaxel, and an ERK1/2 inhibitor dramatically inhibited NAG-1 expression in human lung cancer cells. Therefore, this synergistic apoptotic effect in human lung cancer cells may be directly associated with K8-induced NAG-1 expression through ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, over-expression of NAG-1 enhanced K8/paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. In addition, treatment of nude mice with K8 combined with paclitaxel induced phospho-ERK1/2 and NAG-1 expression in vivo. Targeting of NAG-1 signaling could enhance therapeutic efficacy in lung cancer. Our results reveal that activation of NAG-1 by K8 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel in human lung cancer cells via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.",

Lee School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological UniversityMitotic cell death is a major cell death pathway that occurs in cancer cells which have been treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the mechanisms underlying this form of cell death is poorly understood. Here, a novel molecular event that regulates mitotic cell death is reported. During prolonged mitotic arrest, caspase-3 is activated and it cleaves condensin I subunit, Cap-H. Absence of Cap-H on the chromosomes compromises chromosome integrity, making them susceptible to degradation by caspase-activated DNase. When a caspase-resistant form of Cap-H is expressed in cells, mitotic chromosomes are able to maintain their structural integrity during mitotic arrest and thus, able to withstand nuclease cleavage. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the molecular events that regulate mitotic cell death.

In our previously study(Wang and Yu et al., Nat Cell Biol 2006), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) can be phorsphorylated and stabilized in the chromatin-bound form by nuclear EGFR to facilitate the DNA repair and proliferation of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we will plan to develop a novel anti-cancer therapy through PCNA peptides to disrupt PCNA functions may further enhance tumor-cell killing. Indeed, we found that the synthetic PCNA peptides, which directly competed PCNA phosphorylation with nuclear EGFR, caused chromatin-bound form PCNA degradation and further inhibited growth of EGFR overexpressing MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, there is no significant inhibition found in the EGFR low-expressing breast cancer cells line MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 treated with PCNA peptides. In addition, we show that the PCNA peptides in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment enhance the inhibitory effect on MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cells proliferation. It is also worth noting that the PCNA peptide is able to more effectively inhibit the selected TKI-resistant MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells than parental cells. Our results may provide another venue to develop effective therapeutics for cancer treatment via blockade of PCNC phosphorylationA. Primavera 1 , A. De Luca 1 , N. Moroni 2 , A. Serafino 2 , R.

Recent reports on NO effects in certain drug resistant cell lines suggest it may be possible to overcome resistance through administration of NO donors. Moreover, we have recently reported that Glutathione Transferases (GSTs), Phase II detoxification enzymes, may act as intracellular NO carriers or scavengers. In the present study we wanted to ascertain whether the reversal of drug resistance could be mediated by an increased rate of detoxification through Phase II enzymes combined with high cellular GSH contents, by treating breast cancer cells resistant to doxorubicin with nitrosoglutathione (GSNO).",

Semaphorins (Sema3), are implicated in the regulation of both physiological and tumor angiogenesis. We have recently shown that endothelial Sema3A is an endogenous inhibitor that is lost during tumor progression and its reintroduction into a mouse model of pancreatic islet b-cell carcinogenesis (RipTag2), resulted in reduced vascular density, blood vessel normalization, restoration of tumor normoxia, and inhibition of tumor growth. Here, we show that the treatment of tumor-bearing RipTag2 with exogenous Sema3A induced a dramatic reduction of tumor invasiveness, the reappearance of E-cadherin and a down-modulation of vimentin, two known targets of cancer hypoxia that are also regulated during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Then, we sought to investigate if the preventive administration of exogenous Sema3A was able to overcome the evasive resistance observed in RipTag2 upon treatment with Sunitinib, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits several tyrosine kinase receptors. Notably, we observed a dramatic reduction of tumor volume, cancer invasiveness, liver and peripancreatic lymph node metastases in RipTag2 treated for 2 weeks with Sema3A followed by 2 weeks of Sunitinib treatment, compared to Sunitinib-treated controls. Moreover, while Sunitinib-treated tumors were highly hypoxic and displayed few pericyte-covered vessels, the combinatorial regimen of Sema3A and Sunitinib normalized the vasculature and restored tumor normoxia. Finally, Real-Time RT-PCR and confocal microscopy analysis revealed a strong increase of E-cadherin expression and a complete inhibition of vimentin in tumors treated with Sema3A and Sunitinib as compared to Sunitinib alone. Therefore, re-expression of Sema3A in tumors may safely harness the therapeutic potential of anti-angiogenic drugs, by normalizing the vasculature, inhibiting tumor hypoxia, and modulating the expression of EMT markers and other hypoxic-induced genes activated by anti-angiogenic treatments.S.

This purification scheme resulted in the isolation of a single 67 kDa band, bearing L-Dopa decarboxylase inhibitory activity. This single band was excised from the gel and mass spectrometry results suggested that it corresponded to serum albumin. Highly purified human serum albumin was tested for its inhibitory effect on human DCC activity. Indeed, our results confirmed that the observed inhibitory effect of albumin was pH, temperature, pre-incubation time and protein concentration dependent. Our results show for the first time that Human Serum Albumin is a regulator of DDC activity in humans. The elucidation of the biological importance of the presence of a DDC activity inhibitor could provide us with new information leading to the better understanding of the biological pathways that DDC is involved in.",

Previous studies have suggested that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and endothelial function may play important role in the process of CSX. We aimed to evaluate the association of H. pylori infection and endothelial function in CSX patients. Methods: Between June and December 2010, 56 patients with CSX (23 male/33 female, mean age: 51.25 \u00b1 8.86) who were anti-H. pylori IgG-positive and 24 patients (7 male/17 female, mean age: 52.79 \u00b1 9.0.88) who were anti-H. pylori IgG-negative, were included in the study. We evaluated plasma levels of the sE selectin as a marker of endothelial function, using ELISA method. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Results: The levels of sE selectin were significantly higher in H. pylori (+) than H. pylori (-) -CSX patients (43.22 \u00b1 15.70 versus 31.72 \u00b1 8.25 ng/ml, respectively; p < 0.05). Fifty-six anti-H. These findings support an association between H. pylori infection and sE selectin as an endothelial function marker. This association suggests that H. pylori infection can be a trigger for the probable mechanism of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CSX.",

So\u00a8zen Anadolu University MAPK cascades are highly conserved modules in all eukaryotes. In plants, MAPK pathways are involved in the regulation of development, growth, and programmed cell death and in responses to a diversity of environmental stimuli including cold, heat, drought, high salinity, oxidative stress, UV and pathogen attack. MAP kinase kinase being integral part of this cascade performs an important function of integrating upstream signals to mitogen activated protein kinase for further appropriate cellular responses. Until today a number of MAPKK genes were identified in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. We have recently cloned a putative MAPKK full length cDNA (OoMAPKK1) from Origanum onites. The present study was focused on the expression levels of OoMAPKK1 under different abiotic stresses. The expression patterns of OoMAPKK1 were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR after cold, wounding and ABA treatments. After exposure to 4\u00b0C, transcript levels of OoMAPKK1 increased rapidly, maximum level was observed 1 hour after treatment, then, the OoMAPKK1 transcript declined and fell to the basal level after 4 hours. Transcript levels of OoMAPKK1 also increased in 1 hour after wounding and maintained its high level up to 6 hours then decreased gradually and back to its basal level after 24 hours. The expression of OoMAPKK1 could also be induced by ABA treatment, when treated with ABA, the transcript levels of OoMAPKK1 increased after 30 minutes, and decreased after 6 hours. A phylogenetic tree based on the aminoacid sequences of OoMAPKK1 and other known plant MAPKK genes also showed that OoMAPKK1 grouped with MAPKKs stimulated by abiotic stresses such as cold, salt and wounding. To the best of our knowledge, the data presented is the first report of transcript regulation of MAKK in aromatic plant Origanum onites. Studies linking the OoMAPKK1 with the downstream OoMAPKs, triggered by different stimuli will further elucidate the origanum MAPK cascade.N. N. Topalov, Y. N. Kotova, S. A. Vasil'ev and M. A.

Vitale Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare, Universita`di Napoli 'Federico II'The calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase involved in multiple signalings and biological functions. We previously demonstrated in epithelial and mesenchimal cells that CaMKII participates with Ras to Raf-1 activation and that it is necessary for ERK activation by diverse factors. Raf-1 activation is complex and involves multiple converging signalings, protein interactions and Raf-1 phosphorylation at multiple sites. Maximal Raf-1activation is reached by phosphorylation at Y341 by Src and at S338. Although early data proposed the involvement of p21-activated kinase 3 (Pak3), the kinase phosphorylating S338 is not definitively identified. We investigated whether CaMKII phosphorylates Raf-1 at S338. RasV12 and SrcY527 were expressed in NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells. CaMKII activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay and Western Blot for pT286. Raf-1 activation was determined by in vivo and in vitro kinase assay and Western Blot for pS338 upon CaMKII inhibition. CaMKII and ERK were activated by serum and RasV12 in COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells. RasV12 and SrcY527 activated CaM-KII and both cooperated for Raf-1 maximal activation. CaMKII inhibition by the CaMKII dominant negative mutant (CaM-KIIDN) strongly reduced Raf-1 activation. In cells stimulated by serum, fibronectin or epidermal growth factor, phosphorylation of S338 Raf-1 is strongly reduced by the CaMKII inhibitors KN93, antCaNtide or CaMKIIDN. The inhibition of Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), which in turn activates Pak3, was ineffective. In vitro incubation of purified CaMKII and immunoprecipitated Raf-1, resulted in S338 phosphorylation. In conclusions, CaMKII phosphorylates Raf-1 at S338 and it participates to ERK activation upon different stimuli in the MAPK cascade.L. Degre`ve, C. A. Fuzo and A. Caliri Universidade de Sao PauloDengue is a disease transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with any one of the four dengue viruses. It occurs in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Symptoms range from a flu to a potentially lethal complication. There are no specific antiviral medicines for dengue. Today, the disease is endemic in over 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, Mediterraneo East, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific where 2.5 billion people live in risk areas. The envelope (E) protein of the dengue virus interacts with the receptors DC-SIGN and is important for the fusion with the cell membrane. The behaviors of the monomer of the E protein in acid medium, i.e. with histidine residues protonated in four ionic strength (IS) aqueous solutions (IS = 0.0; 0.075; 0.15 e 0.225 mol/L) were studied by molecular dynamics simulations, using the 4.5.1 GROMACS package. The protein initial configuration was obtained from the dimer (PDB code: 1oke). The system was modeled by the GROMOS 96 force field (43a1) with the SPC/e model for water. The simulations were realized at 300 K and 1 atm in the NPT ensemble. The evolution of the structures was monitored by observing the RMSD calculated in relation to the initial structure as compared to the average structure obtained by a Principal Component Analysis in the final stages of the simulations. Only for IS = 0.15 mol/L the protein showed a convergence to an average structure. For other IS values, large fluctuations indicate that the structures are unstable. This first result shows that the E protein is perfectly adapted to the environment assuming stable configurations necessary for performing their activity.FAPESP, CNPq P22.2 Modeling of amyloid fibril formation N. V. Dovidchenko and O. V. Galzitskaya Institute of Protein Research, Russian Academy of SciencesNo detailed step-by-step model of protein rearrangements during amyloid structure formation has been presented in the literature. The aim of this work was to design a kinetic model for description of the amyloid formation process on the basis of the most recent experimental data. A general kinetic model is proposed for description of the amyloid formation process including the nucleation mechanism of polymerization with consecutive monomer attachment to oligomer and autocatalytic growth of amyloid aggregates implying all types of exponential growth such as branching, fragmentation, and growth from the surface. Computer simulations have shown that the model correctly describes experimentally observed growth stages of amyloid fibrils and that the presence of exponential growth stage in the model is critical for modeling amyloid fibril formation. The key feature of the proposed model is the stage of the exponential growth of the aggregate. Such stage can simultaneously describe several versions of aggregate enlargement by branching, fragmentation, or growth from the surface. Data obtained using this model suggests conclusions concerning the significance of each stage in amyloid fibril assembly.

Rigid automated docking simulations of 22-NBD-cholesterol binding in the catalytical sites of the oxidoreductases were conducted with Autodock 4.0 and AutoDockTools (The Scripps Research Institute). Results obtained for P450scc (pdb id: 3NA0) indicate that NBD-group of the steroid locates close to Trp270 and Trp126; C20 atom (a typical site of cholesterol oxidation by P450scc) is within 4 \u00c5 from Fe of heme. In the case of cholesterol-oxidase (pdb id: 1COY) NBD-group of the steroid is surrounded by Phe83, Gly84, Ile85, etc; 3b-OH group of 22-NBD-cholesterol is localized within 4 \u00c5 from the redox-active fragment of FAD. Spectrophotometric and fluorometric measurements indicate that 22-NBD-cholesterol binds close to heme of P450scc into a hydrophobic pocket tryptophan residue(s). In the case of P450scc -adrenodoxin -adrenodoxin-reductase -NADPH enzymatic system formation of a hydrophilic derivative of 22-NBD-cholesterol has been detected by TLC and HPLC. In the case of cholesterol-oxidase from Nocardia sp. formation of hydrophobic 3-oxo-D4-derivative of 22-NBD-cholesterol has been confirmed by UV-Vis, HPLC and mass-spectrometry. So, experimental and docking results are in good agreement. The data obtained can be useful for investigations of structural-functional features of the enzymes mentioned above and for detection of pathogenic bacteria expressing enzymes, catalyzing conversion of 3b-hydroxy-D5 steroids to their 3-oxo-D4-derivatives.

Cerebrovascular disorders, particularly ischemic stroke, are complex diseases in which several genetic variants interact with environmental factors to determine phenotypic manifestations. The identification of such genetic factors is essential to improve risk prediction and to gain insight into pathophysiological mechanisms and it will eventually allow the development of new therapeutic strategies. We are studying an Italian cohort of patients affected by cerebrovascular disorders: a total of 712 cases have been recruited and genotyped on the Illumina platform for more than 600k wholegenome SNPs, together with a total of 961 healthy individuals selected as controls (in part recruited in collaboration with the PROCARDIS consortium). A case-control genome-wide association study is now ongoing in order to validate previously recognized risk variant and to identify new genetic determinants. In particular we are studying the association of genetic variants at 9p21.3, a genomic region already known to be involved in the pathogenesis of different disorders, in the Italian Cerebrovascular Cohort. Results of our analysis demonstrated that genetic variants in this region represent risk factors for cerebrovascular disorders also in the Italian population and highlighted the preferential association to the subgroup of patients affected by vascular dementia.E.

Our goal is to understand how multiple miRNAs regulate a set of genes involved in breast cancer progression. Targetscan, Miranda, Diana-microT and Mirbase algorithms and an exact Fisher test were used to statistically predict miRNA targeting for differentially expressed protein-coding genes obtained from four different breast cancer datasets (good versus bad prognosis with 5 years follow-up). A group of six miRNAs (miR-21, miR-223, miR-19b, miR-203, miR-200c and miR-340) was strongly predicted to be up-regulated in poor versus good prognosis tumors. 465 down-regulated genes were predicted to be targeted by at least three out of six miRNAs and used to perform an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to find crucial network hubs. STAT5a and JUN are two transcription factors found to be network hubs for our down-regulated genes and known to play a central role in breast cancer. We are now investigating how the predicted miRNAs regulate STAT5a and JUN expression in several breast cancer cell-lines, following miRNA overexpression and data will be presented.J.

Caselle Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (IRCC), Candiolo, Torino, ItalyEstrogen Receptor alpha (ERa) is one of the key molecular players in most human breast cancers and the influence of ERa at the genomic level in response to ligands has been widely described(Carroll 2006). Unliganded ERa was also recently correlated to epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes(Cardamone et  al. 2009). Several studies showed that DNA repeats in the human genome are significantly associated with transcription factor binding sites (Bourque 2008; Kunarso 2010). Here, we first set out to examine the binding of ERa to DNA using several chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (Chip-Seq) public datasets on MCF7 and T47D cell lines. We then performed a genome-wide bioinformatics analysis of DNA repetitive features and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) considering ERa binding sites obtained in different conditions. In particular, we have set up a bioinformatic pipeline that is able to explore the behavior of genomic repeat features mapped on Chip-Seq binding peaks and to assess the statistical enrichment of single repeats (or class of repeats) by means of rigorous Monte-Carlo simulations, in the human genome. Furthermore, we have performed a genome-wide scan for putative TFBSs overlapping Chip-seq peaks and repetitive regions, employing canonical positional weight matrices (PWMs) reported in the Jaspar database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) and using affinity scores assigned using a standard Log-Likelihood Ratio scoring function with background frequencies evaluated on human intergenic sequences. A few repetitive sequences and TFBSs showed a remarkable enrichment in ERa sites thus proposing a putative mechanism for the definition of estrogen receptor binding events.G. Barbero, E.

Papa and F. Zanotti Dept. of Medical Biochemistry, Physics and Biology, University of Bari, Italy In the last years, various reports (Moser et al. PNAS 1999 and Martinez et al. Nature 2003) have focused on the ecto-ATP synthase complex located on the external surface of different cell lines, but, to date, its role is not clear. Previous investigations by our group were done on freshly isolated hepatocytes that are able to retain, at least for some time, the characteristics of living cells representing an experimental tool, the closest to in vivo (Mangiullo et al. BBA 2008). Our results clarified the subunits composition of ecto-ATP synthase in freshly isolated hepatocytes, and showed that both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis are coupled with trans-membrane proton gradient (DlH+). The above mentioned results indicate that the ecto-ATP synthase could play a role in cellular conditions where intracellular pH (pHi) changes happen.The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the ecto-ATP synthase is involved in pHi changes, in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, 3 hours after partial hepatectomy (PH). It has been reported (Farghali et al. Lab Invest 1994) that a decrease in pHi occurs after PH, and similar results were obtained in our experimental conditions. In PH hepatocytes no significant extracellular ATP synthesis coupled with DlH+ was detected, differently than with hepatocytes of control and sham groups. Spectrophotometric measurements confirmed that extracellular ATP synthesis is almost negligible in PH hepatocytes. The ecto-ATP hydrolase activity coupled with DlH+ was also depressed in PH hepatocytes as compared to control and sham groups, but at a lower extent than extracellular ATP synthesis. FACS measurements showed a decreased expression of F1-a/b in PH group. The present results indicate that functional impairment of ecto-ATP syn-thase might be involved in maintenance of pHi acidification induced by PH in hepatocytes.P23.10 RCD-8 as a novel possible regulator in CoA biosynthesis in mammalian cells D.

New alternative fluorescent labeling technique -Fluorescein Arsenical Hairpin (Flash/tetracystein) binder technology was exploited to fluorescently label MtCK. Implementation of fluorescent proteins such as GFP for MtCK fluorescent tagging was excluded because of the functional importance of MtCK C-and N-terminal part and insertion of large fluorescent protein inside the MtCK protein imposes potential risk to interfere the structure, localization and function of the fused protein. Two different tetracysteine motifs CCPGCC and FLNCCPGCCMEP were introduced into different positions in MtCK by mutagenesis. Sequentially the recombinant MtCK constructs were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLys E.Coli cell line and activity of the each construct was determined. The results of the activity measurements demonstrated that many of the mutants, including those with longer 12-amino acid sequence mutantion, displayed full activity and were therefore chosen for consecutive studies in eukaryotic cell lines. Sequentally the recombinant MtCK sequences were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 mammalian expression vector and expressed in COS-7 cell line. The cells were stained with F2Flash labeling reagent and the expression of tetracysteine tagged MtCK mutants were visualized ab inito with epifluorescent and confocal microscopy. Improved variant of cyan fluroescent protein Cerulean as an appropriate FRET partner for F2Flash was chosen to fluorescently label AAC. Both N-and C-terminally fused AAC-Cerulean constructs were generated. AAC fusion proteins were expressed in COS-7 cell line and their expression was visualized with epifluorescent and confocal microscopy. Functional constructs of MtCK and AAC-Cerulean were selected for studies of their interaction in cardiomyocytes by applying FRET technique.

Methods: Human DPSCs and PLSCs were irradiated with the doses of 2, 6 and 20 Gy. We used western blotting to evaluate changes in protein expression. DNA damage was evaluated by comet assay and by cH2AX quantification. Results: We evaluated DNA damage of DPSCs and PLSCs immediately, 1 and 24 hours after IR. We founded 95% of damaged DNA in cells immediately after IR with the dose of 20 Gy. This damage was repaired as early as within 30 minutes. Then we evaluated the presence of cH2AX as a marker of DSBs. One hour after IR with the dose of 20 Gy cH2AX occurred in 85% of cells, and disappeared within 24 hours (4%). The expression of ATM kinase increased 1 hour as well as 24 hours after IR, whereas p-ATM_ser1981 increased only after 1 hour. P-Chk1_ser345 and p-Chk2_thr68 increased significantly after 1 hour. The amount of protein p53 was increased during the whole time period; p-p53_ser15 reached its maximum after 1 hour post IR. Protein p21 was increased after 24 hours. We evaluated the expression of DNA-PKcs and its subunit Ku80, but there were no significant changes observed. Conclusion: IR of DPSCs and PLSCs with the doses of 2 and 20 Gy causes immediate DNA damage. We observed breaks in 95% of DNA, high level of cH2AX (85%), increased expression of pATM_ser1981, phosphorylated checkpoint kinases and p-p53_ser15 after IR. We found that both SCs are able to repair the damage very quickly. Percentage of damaged DNA decreased to 10% within 30 minutes and to only 3% within 60 minutes. After 24 hours post IR significant decrease in cH2AX amount and decreased phosphorylation of ATM, Chk1 and Chk2 was observed.

Many substrates of CK2 play a critical role in cell proliferation, and CK2 concentration is often abnormally high in malignant cells. CK2 precise modulation is enigmatic, it appears to be constitutively active but it interferes with many signal pathways such as Wnt or Akt cascade. So the question is: how can a constitutively active kinase mediate alterations in stimuli intensity? Some clues may come from the analysis of C-terminal and N-terminal regions of CK2.During mitosis C-terminal sequence is phosphorylated by Cdk1, and cell lines with transient expression of phospho-mimic mutant CK2aT344E/T360E/S362E/ S370E(CK2a4E) show ''catastrophic effects'' during cell segregation.",

Results: Mean Vit E and Vit A concentrations were 8.85 \u00b1 3.02 and 0.588 \u00b1 0.91 respectively in which 6.9% were Vit E deficient while 36% were Vit A deficient. Vit E correlated positively with serum concentrations of total cholesterol. Conclusion: The elevation in Vit E levels was associated with unfavourable total cholesterol levels.

            "text": "Pyk2 is a focal adhesion kinase, highly homologous to FAK, which does not possess SH2 or SH3 domains, but a centrally located catalytic domain flanked by a FERM domain and two proline-rich sequences. Pyk2 is unique in that it can be activated both by Src-mediated phosphorylation and by intracellular Ca 2+ increase, and thus it can translate Ca 2+ signals into a tyrosine kinase-based pathway. Pyk2 is highly expressed in platelets, and is rapidly activated by the majority of the physiological agonists, through an aggregation-and integrin aIIbb 3-independent mechanism. However, its role in platelet activation is still unknown. In this study we report a functional analysis of platelets from Pyk2-knockout mice. Platelet count was normal in Pyk2 KO mice, and no significant differences in the expression of the major glycoproteins was observed by flow cytometry. In an in vivo model of photochemical-induced femoral artery thrombosis, the time for artery occlusion was significantly prolonged in the Pyk2 KO mice. In addition, Pyk2-deficient mice exhibited a marked protection against collagen plus epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism, with a significant reduction of the number of occluded vessels in the lung. Tail bleeding time was slightly increased in Pyk2 KO mice. Ex vivo analysis on Pyk2-deficinet platelets revealed that aggregation was normal upon stimulation of GPVI, but was almost completely suppressed in response to PAR4-activating peptide. Similarly, aggregation of Pyk2 KO platelets was strongly reduced in response to low but not high doses of thrombin or U46619. Thrombin-induced inside-out activation of integrin aIIbb3, but not secretion was impaired in the absence of Pyk2. Finally, we found that Pyk2 was critically required for efficient TxA2 generation. These results reveal a novel important role for the focal adhesion kinase Pyk2 downstream of G-proteins coupled receptors to support platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. The pathophysiological process ''Androgen Escape'' is a clinical phase in which the tumoral prostatic cells obtain the ability to survive and proliferate without the required signals delivered normally by circulating androgens. Androgen insensitivity reflects the ability to grow without (or with very low) circulating androgens, but it should not be confused with an absence of the intracellular signaling activated downstream of androgen binding to AR. This event occurs when the tumoral prostatic cell can over activates the androgenic pathway by several mechanisms. A convergence point of some of these pathways is the protein STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription). The phosphorylation of STAT-3 of tyrosine 705 in the cytoplasm, by IL-6 and EGF, leads to its dimerization, translocation into the nucleus, DNA binding, and then, expression of genes that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In prostate cancer (CaP) AR and STAT3 pathway are constitutively activated; they coexist in the hormone-responsive tumor and crosstalk in androgen-refractory tumor. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of STAT3 and its post-translational modifications (PTMs), like phosphorilation, acetilation, glutathionylation, responsible of a functional variability of the protein as transcription factor. To evaluate STAT3 activation and its PTMs we performed Western Blotting analysis on two human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, androgen-sensitive, and PC3, androgen-refractory, untreated and stimulated with IL-6 (25 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml) and H2O2 (100 mM). The results showed differences between the profiles of PTMs in the two cell lines and in the different conditions. After, we examined by RT2-PCR, the expression levels of STAT3 target genes, under the same conditions: the data obtained showed a relation between PTMs of STAT3 and Aberrant histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is frequent in human leukemias. However, while classical, NAD+-independent HDACs are an established therapeutic target, the relevance of NAD+-dependent HDACs (sirtuins) in leukemia treatment remains unclear. Here, we assessed the antileukemic activity of sirtuin inhibitors and of the NAD+-lowering drug FK866, alone and in combination with traditional HDAC inhibitors. Primary leukemia cells, leukemia cell lines, healthy leukocytes and hematopoietic progenitors were treated with sirtuin inhibitors (sirtinol, cambinol, EX527) and with FK866, with or without addition of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid, sodium butyrate, and vorinostat. Cell death was quantified by propidium iodide cell staining and subsequent flow-cytometry. Apoptosis induction was monitored by cell staining with FITC-Annexin-V/propidium iodide or with TMRE followed by flow-cytometric analysis, and by measuring caspase3/7 activity. Intracellular Bax was detected by flow-cytometry. Cellular NAD+ levels were measured by enzymatic cycling assays. Bax was overexpressed by retroviral transduction. Sirtuin inhibitors and FK866 synergistically enhanced HDAC inhibitor activity in leukemia cells, but not in healthy leukocytes and hematopoietic progenitors. HDAC inhibitors were found to induce upregulation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family-member whose translocation to mitochondria is normally prevented by SIRT1. As a result, leukemia cells become sensitized to sirtuin inhibitor-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, NAD+-independent HDACs and sirtuins cooperate in leukemia cells to avoid apoptosis. Combining sirtuin with HDAC inhibitors results in synergistic antileukemic activity that could be therapeutically exploited.Previously we have found the phenomenon -formation of nonequilibrium membrane bound protons fraction (NMBP) occurred on the outer surface of inner mitochondrial membrane in cause of functioning of H+-pump. This proton fraction has the excess of free energy and does not interact with classical uncouplers [1] [2] [3] . Moreover specific catalysts which selectively accelerate the reaction of dissociation of NMBP from the BLM surface [1] and mitochondria [2, 3] were found. Reagents usually used as standard buffers (citrate, MES and HEPES) reveal catalytic properties [1] [2] [3] . We have also found that mitochondria addressed antioxidants like SkQ, MitoQ [4] and SkQ3 [5] revealed uncoupling features [4] . Our aim was to study the mechanism of SkQ3 uncoupling ability and primary its interaction with the NMBP fraction. We obtained that SkQ3 react specifically with NMBP. SkQ3 uncoupling ability was significantly reduced in case when this fraction was removed from the inner mitochondria membrane by addition a catalyst (HEPES 20 mM) to incubation medium. Meanwhile uncoupling ability of classical uncouplers increases in these conditions. We have found also that activity of SkQ3 reduced by adding phosphate 0.5-1 mM in the incubation medium. The addition of phosphate reduces the uncoupling effect SkQ3, because it leads to H2PO43-/OHexchange on inner mitochondria membrane and to neutralization of the non-equilibrium membrane bound H+-acids. Thus we have found new class of membranotropic uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, SkQ3, which selectively interact with non-equilibrium membrane bound protons fraction. The cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli couples the exergonic reduction of O2 to 2H2O to proton motive force generation by transmembrane charge separation. The oxidase contains hemes b558 and b595 and heme d, where O2 chemistry occurs through sequential formation of a few catalytic intermediates. The steady-state behavior of the isolated cytochrome bd has been examined by stopped-flow multiwavelength absorption spectroscopy. Under turnover conditions sustained by O2 and dithiothreitol-reduced ubiquinone, we found [1] that the mostly populated catalytic intermediates are the ferryl and oxy-ferrous species, with a minor fraction of the enzyme containing ferric heme d and possibly one electron on heme b558. These new findings clearly differ from those obtained with mammalian cytochrome c oxidase [2] , in which the oxygen intermediates were not found to be populated at detectable levels under similar conditions. The results are discussed in the light of previously proposed models of the cytochrome bd catalytic cycle. Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) regulate lipid signaling by phosphorylating diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid (PA). Membrane recruitment and activation of DGK-alpha (DGKA) is required for cell proliferation, migration and matrix invasion induced by growth factor, chemokines and oncogenes in epithelial and endothelial cells.Through a proteomic approach we identified 76 proteins associated to tyrosine phosphorylated DGKA in Kaposi sarcoma cells. Among these proteins we selected non-muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), for further characterization. MLCK is a regulator of acto-myosin driven contraction, which phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC). DGKA co-immunoprecipitates with both long (non-muscle) and short (smooth muscle) MLCK isoforms, consistently with the interaction observed with the proteomic strategy.Inhere we show that in epithelial cells: (i) HGF-induced activation of DGKA produces PA at the nascent ruffle; (ii) DGKA-mediated PA generation is necessary and sufficient to recruit MLCK at ruffling site were MLCK promotes ruffle extension; (iii) expression of a constitutively active and membrane-bound DGKA mutant induces ruffles formation by recruiting MLCK at plasma membrane and promoting MLCK-mediated MLC phosphorylation; (iv) expression of constitutively active MLCK is sufficient to lead to ruffle assembly independently from DGKA activity. Altogether those data indicate that PA produced by HGFinduced activation of DGKA, is a novel regulator of the localization and the activity of MLCK required for ruffle formation in epithelial cells.",

HnRNP A2/B1 was found to localize in cell membrane and endomembranes in spatiotemporal manner by cell fractionation as well as immunolocalization. Confocal microscopy confirmed the colocalization of hnRNP A2/B1 and K-RasG12V in plasma membrane. Differential interaction of hnRNP A2/B1 with K-Ras depending on activation status and Ser181-phosphorilation was assessed, given our previous results showing that this modification induce increased Ras activation. Here we demonstrate in vivo and in both directions that both endogenous and transfected hnRNP A2/B1 interact preferentially with HA-K-Ras wild type rather than with the constitutively active HA-K-RasG12V. Moreover, this interaction was favored in the pseudophosphorylated form HA-K-RasG12VS181D and, what is more, it was impaired with non-phosphorylabe mutant HA-K-RasG12VS181A. Concomitantly, membrane recruitment of endogenous hnRNP A2/B1 was diminished in HA-K-RasG12VS181A. Looking for cellular condition where this interaction could be significant, we found that sorbitol-induced osmotic stress increased both membrane recruitment and interaction of hnRNP A2/B1 specially in cells transfected with HA-K-RasG12VS181D. Conclusions: We describe a novel interaction in plasma membrane. The Serine/Threonine protein kinase Snf1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a member of the SNF1/AMPK (Sucrose Non-Fermenting 1/AMP-activated protein kinase) family, one of the central components in the nutrient sensing and regulation of the carbon metabolism in eukaryotes. Glucose depletion or growth on non-fermentable carbon sources lead to the activation of Snf1 which induces the expression of 400 glucose-repressed genes controlling different transcriptional regulators or influencing chromatin remodeling. This kinase is also involved in several other cellular processes such as stress resistance, sporulation, invasive growth and ageing. Recently, we proposed a new function for Snf1 as cell cycle regulator since we showed that in 2% glucose growing cells Snf1 is required to guarantee the correct expression of CLB5 gene and the G1-to-S phase transition. We also demonstrated the existence of a physical interaction between Snf1 and Swi6, the regulatory subunit of the SBF and MBF transcriptional complexes which regulate the expression of G1 and S phase cyclins, respectively. Here we focus on Snf1/Swi6 interaction showing that it is independent either on the activatory subunit of Snf1 (Snf4) and on the DNA-binding proteins Mbp1 and Swi4 which interact with Swi6 in SBF and MBF complexes. Although Swi6 is involved in the regulation of the expression of G1 cyclins, the lack of the Swi6/Snf1 interaction does not influence CLN2 expression, since CLN2 transcription is not altered in a snf1D strain, at least during exponential phase, suggesting the existence of a specific role of Snf1 in the regulation of the expression of CLB5.Aim: The aim of our study was to determine the response of breast cancer cell line MCF-7 to DNA damage induced by fractionated radiation and to compare the response with single exposure. The work is mainly focused on the analysis of signaling cascades responding to DNA damage (DNA-PK, gamma H2AX, MDC-1) and on the effect of inhibition of DNA-PK during irradiation on the cell viability. Methods: MCF-7 were exposed to gamma radiation by fractionated irradiation (1x2, 2x2, 3x2 and 4x2 Gy) or single dose of 2 and 8 Gy in the presence or absence of a specific inhibitor of DNA-PK (NU7026 or NU7441). Cell cycle analysis and induction of apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of key proteins and their co-localization in nuclei was detected by confocal microscopy. Results: Phosphorylated H2AX and MDC1 form discernible colocalized foci 1 h after irradiation. After single exposure majority of the foci disappear within 24 h. Consecutive irradiation by the subsequent fractions does not increase foci formation 1 h after the irradiation, but 24 h after the repair is incomplete and the cells with damaged DNA persist. We show that radiation-induced decrease in cell viability is significantly affected by inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase. Cell line MCF-7 is also significantly more sensitive to fractionated radiation compared with the same single dose. Conclusion: Inhibitor NU7441 affected the cells more specifically than NU7026. Inhibition of DNA-PK appears to be an important factor along with fractionated radiation in cancer therapy.Exposure to asbestos fibers is associated with the risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis and tumor diseases such as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma (MM). The molecular mechanisms by which crocidolite and other asbestos forms induce these severe pathologies are still poorly understood. Accumulating evidence has established that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important second messengers of asbestos toxicity, which may modulate different redox-sensitive signaling pathways, such as NF-kB (nuclear factor kB). We have previously observed that crocidolite asbestos in human MM cells (HMM) induces NF-kB activation and stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide by inhibiting the RhoA signaling pathway. Cytotoxicity, oxidative stress induction (lipoperoxidation) and the effect of asbestos on the RhoA signaling pathway (RhoA GTP binding, Rho kinase activity, RhoA prenylation, hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-CoA reductase activity) were investigated both in primary human mesothelial cells (HMC) and in HMM cells exposed to crocidolite, in the presence or not of antioxidants (Tempol, Mn-porphyrin and the association of superoxide dismutase and catalase). We showed that crocidolite-induced ROS production in both HMC and HMM cells mediates the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Indeed the co-incubation of HMC and HMM cells with crocidolite together with antioxidants completely prevented the cytotoxicity and lipoperoxidation caused by crocidolite alone, as well as the decrease of HMGCR activity, and restored the RhoA/ROCK activity and the RhoA prenylation. The same effect was observed by using the oxidizing agent menadione in place of crocidolite. In conclusion, such a mechanism could at least partly explain the effects exerted by crocidolite fibers in mesothelial cells.",

Peculiarly, this O 2 -sensitive parasite lacks some conventional ROS-scavenging enzymes, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase. Despite that, Giardia preferentially colonizes the fairly oxygenated small intestine where it has to cope with oxidative stress to survive. With the long-term goal of developing novel anti-parasitic drugs, our research has been focusing on the structural and functional characterization of the enzymes playing a key role in the antioxidant defense system of this microbial pathogen. We report that Giardia cells express a flavodiiron protein (FDP) and, under nitrosative stress conditions, a flavohemoglobin (Fla-voHb). This is surprising because FDPs are typically absent in eukaryotes and FlavoHbs are very rarely found in protists. Both proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. The FDP is endowed with a high H 2 O-producing O 2 -reductase activity (TN > 40 s-1, KM, O 2 \u00a3 2 lM, T = 20\u00b0C), that led us to propose that the primary function of the FDP is to protect Giardia from O 2 toxicity, a function originally attributed to NADH-oxidase. More recently, we observed that following short-term exposure to \u2021100 lM hydrogen peroxide, highly toxic for Giardia, the O 2 consumption by the parasite is irreversibly impaired and the FDP undergoes a degradation, prevented by the proteasomeinhibitor MG132. Under aerobic conditions and in the presence of NADH as the reducing substrate, the recombinant Giardia FlavoHb metabolizes nitric oxide (NO) with high efficacy (TN = 116 \u00b1 10 s-1 at 1 lM NO, KM, O2 = 22 \u00b1 7 lM, T = 37\u00b0C). Consistently, we found that the NO-induced expression of Fla-voHb in Giardia cells endows the parasite with the ability to degrade NO in the presence of O 2 , which likely represents a strategy to evade the host immune response during infection. Many soil pollutants are subjected to oxidation processes, resulting in the formation of reactive intermediates, especially radicals that react with oxygen to produce various reactive oxygen species (ROS). Microorganisms are generally protected from ROS damage by several enzymes, including catalases and peroxidases. Soil bacteria of the family Comamonadaceae are known for their broad catabolic diversity in the degradation of various xenobiot- Helicobacter pylori, a pathogenic aerotolerant bacterium colonizing the gastric mucosa, causes gastritis and ulcer and, if not eradicated, may lead to the development of gastric tumors. H. pylori resistance to moderate oxygen concentrations is mainly due to the key anti-oxidant role played by superoxide dismutase (HpSOD), the enzyme scavenging the toxic superoxide anions formed during oxygen consumption. The 3D structure of a recombinant form of HpSOD showed that this enzyme, belonging to the Fe-SOD family, contains an extended C-terminal tail, which is missing in other bacterial SODs and whose role remains obscure. Furthermore, in some cultures of H. pylori the endogenous HpSOD was found anchored to the flagellar sheath of the bacterium. In the present study the biochemical properties of the recombinant HpSOD were investigated to improve the knowledge on the enzyme functions, which could explain the H. pylori survival in the harsh conditions of the stomach. The research is also focused on the possible role played by the unusual C-terminal extension of HpSOD. The high specific activity (5000 U/mg) of the recombinant enzyme and its discrete heat resistance (T1/2 = 64\u00b0C) ensure its functional efficiency. The effect of typical inhibitors and inactivators of SODs was investigated; while sodium azide caused only a low inhibition, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite provoked a significant inactivation of HpSOD. It is known that the genes involved in glutathione biosynthesis are missing in the H. pylori genome; however, HpSOD undergoes a glutathionylation reaction by the oxidized form of glutathione. A mutagenic analysis aimed at the replacement of the two cysteine residues possessed by HpSOD allowed the identification of C79 as the target residue of the S-glutathionylation reaction. The production of a deleted form of HpSOD lacking the C-terminal extension of the enzyme is on the way, to check the effect on the biochemical properties of the enzyme. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal damage. Little is known about its cause that contribute to its unpredictable course. Recent clinical studies suggest that NO and its reactive derivative peroxinitrite are implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. Reactive NO derivative species are reportedly cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes and neurones in culture by inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Cytokines and immunoglobulins may elicit a survival response in the oligodendrocytes, involving the induction of endogenous heat shock proteins (Hsps), which suggests that redox systems, and therefore the oxidant/antioxidant balance in these cells, are of great importance in MS.The chemical composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered to reflect brain metabolism, and we have previously demonstrated in MS patients a increase in the content reactive nitrogen species and peroxidative products. This study was aimed to determine the differences in the levels of cell stress response markers in the CSF and lymphocytes of control patients as compared with MS patients, in order to provide evidence of an imbalance of oxidant/antioxidant balance and oxidative damage in MS patients. We found that the levels of Vitagenes Hsp72, Hsp70, 4-hydroxy-nonenal HNE, protein carbonyls (DNPH), Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), in lymphocytes MS patients was significantly higher than that control patients. In addition an increased expression of thioredoxin protein (Trx) was observed in MS, possibly related to the decrease in the expression of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) measured in MS lymphocytes. Our findings also indicate that carbonyls and HO-1 are decreased in the CSF of patients with MS with respect to the control patients. Our study opens new possibilities to combat neurodegenerative damage associated with the pathogenesis of MS, providing new redox sensitive targets which can be relevant for clinical settings of this neurodegenerative pathology.",

Bakar 1 , U. Unluturk 2 , K. Agbaht 2 , N. Baskal 2 and S. Nebioglu 1 1 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey 2 Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, TurkeyObjective: Annexins are a family of phospholipid binding proteins with diverse functions. Annexin V (Anx V) is a calciumdependent glycoprotein with a potent anticoagulant capacity. Anx V appears to form an antithrombotic shield around the phospholipids, displacing their coagulation factors. The complex of phosphatidylserine and extracellular Anx V provides an antigenic stimulation for antibody production. Anti-annexin V antibodies (aANVAs) were detected in various autoimmune diseases. It is suspected that aANVAs may interfere with Anx V functions and exert a detrimental role leading to thrombosis and/or vascular occlusion. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune diesease related with thrombotic complications but it's relation with aANVAs is unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of aANVAs in thrombotic complications observed in IDDM. Material and Method: A total of 42 IDDM patients and 40 controls without history of vascular disease were included in the study. Concentrartions of Anx V and aANV IgG and IgM antibodies in plasma and Anti-prothrombin antibody levels were determined by using ELISA technique. Results: The plasma aANV IgG concentration in normal healthy individuals were 4.11 \u00b1 2.28 (Mean \u00b1 SD), while that in IDDM patients was elevated to 22.61 \u00b1 4.95 (p < 0.05) and the plasma aANV IgM concentration in normal healthy individuals were 7.92 \u00b1 3.27, while that in IDDM patients were significantly higher 45.35 \u00b1 11.41 (p < 0.01). Plasma Anx V concentration in IDDM patients were significantly lower than the levels of control group (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the plasma levels of Anti-prothrombin IgG antibodies in IDDM patients in control were 3.36 \u00b1 1.67, while that in IDDM patients was elevated to 37.82 \u00b1 17.58 (p < 0.01). Discussion: Our data suggest that the low plasma Anx V with high levels of aANVAs in IDDM patients may indicate the existence of hypercoagulable state and the high levels of Anti-prothrombin IgG also support the indications. All living cells must maintain homeostasis in a constantly changing environment. A major goal of systems biology is to understand the spatial and temporal changes of all cellular units and their dynamic interplay during cellular responses to stress. Regulation of protein stability and localization are often used to control processes quickly and independently of de-novo protein synthesis. However, although enormous amounts of data have been collected for transcriptional responses to stress, very little data exists, even in the well-studied yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, on the dynamics of protein abundance and localization under a variety of different environmental conditions. Here we show a comprehensive microscopic platform for rapidly and accurately measuring protein localization and abundance in yeast in high throughput. Using the commercially available yeast GFP library, we have used our platform to look at protein dynamics under three different conditions (DTT, H2O2, Nitrogen starvation). We find that hundreds of proteins change localization under the various conditions. Moreover, we find dramatic changes in protein levels, many of which do not correlate to transcriptional changes suggesting an array of post-transcriptional responses. Finally, by comparing our data to data on essentiality of proteins under stress, we find that such posttranscriptionally regulated proteins can have a role in promoting the ability of yeast to survive in stressful environments. To enable easy access to this data we have created a database, which we call LOQATE (LOcalization and Quantitation Atlas of YeasT ProteomE). Using the information in LOQATE it is now possible to start unraveling the scope and general rules guiding proteome localization and abundance changes under diverse cellular and environmental conditions. Hereditary methylmalonic acidemias, (MMAs), are severe autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism caused by the deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). MUT converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, a Krebs cycle intermediate. This reaction is essential for the metabolism of propionyl-CoA, an important intermediate in the degradation of isoleucine, valine and odd-chain fatty acids. A block at this enzymatic step results in elevated plasma levels of methylmalonic acid as well the accumulation of other propionyl-CoA-derived metabolites. The disorders are caused by mutations in the MUT apoenzyme or defective metabolism of the enzymatic cofactor, 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (1) . Two enzymatic phenotypes of apoenzyme deficiency are recognized: mut0 patients have no detectable residual enzyme activity while mut-patients have reduced enzyme activity that may be cobalamin-responsive. The main treatment for mut0 patients is dietary restriction of propiogenic amino acids and carnitine supplementation. Liver or combined liver/kidney transplantation has been performed but its clinical utility is unclear due to the small number of transplanted patients. The aim of this project is the characterization of possible pathogenic mechanisms of MMA. Liver specimens from healthy A complete proteomic analysis was performed on blood plasma samples of male donors with the mean age of 39 \u00b1 7 years which were divided into four groups. Group I included healthy donors who did not work in the enterprise; in II -healthy workers of JSC ''Belaruskali'' without underground work experience; group III and group IV -underground workers without or with chronic bronchitis respectively. We found that total protein value in group II-IV differed from the samples of the group I. To investigate the plasma proteome composition the proteomic maps using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were obtained. Three protein spots were detected that were up-regulated in group IV samples. These proteins of interest were excised from the gel, digested and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as transthyretin, tissue plasminogen activator and protein AF288161. Thus, diagnostic marker proteins were identified in plasma samples from donors with chronic bronchitis. Basing on the detection of protein biomarkers, supplementary method for early diagnostics of chronic bronchitis was developed.P28.14 Comparative secretome analysis of four isogenic Bacillus clausii marketed as probiotics R. Lippolis, A. Gnoni, S. Maiorano and A. M. Sardanelli Institute of Biomembranes and Bioenergetics, CNR, Bari, Italy, Dept. of Medical Biochemistry, Biology and Physics, University of Bari, Italy Bacillus species are currently being used for oral bacterio-therapy and bacterioprophylaxis of gastrointestinal disorders although little is understood about how these bacteria exert their therapeutic benefit. Their genome comprises 4.100 protein-coding genes (1); a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the production of a variety of secreted proteins, enzymes and secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, which perform several very important functions. Because of these relevant applications and industrial importance, in the last years work is addresses to the characterization of bacteria secretome. Our work is directed on the four closely related isogenic L1, L2, L3 and L4 Bacillus strains identified as belonging to B. clausii species. Comparative proteomics analysis was performed to study and elucidate the differences among extracellular proteome (secretome) of four strains. Proteins from stationary phase culture supernatants were collected from the four strains and analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-ED). All strains released significantly amounts of protein in the medium. Protein spot patterns from each strain were compared using image analysis and visible spot differences were identified using mass spectrometry. This procedure identifies proteins, which concern enzymes of carbohydrates metabolism, (enolase, transaldolase and hydroxymethyltransferase), proteases (cell wall lytic activity) two metalloenzymes: (carbonic anhydrase and manganese superoxide dismutase) and a structural flagellum-related proteins, (flagellin). Has been investigated this last protein seems to have an important role in the interaction between human epithelial and immune cell. (2) Further research is needed to elucidate the role of each B. clausii strains and the molecular mechanism of action of proteins as probiotics compound. The fungal cell wall is an essential organelle that shapes the cell, provides physical strength and limits permeability thereby retaining periplasmic proteins and protecting fungi from host degrading enzymes. Cell wall is also the structure involved with the interactions of the fungus with the host and the major target of the host immune response. The major constituents of C. albicans cell wall are polysaccharides mainly 1,3 b-glucan, 1-6 b-glucan, and proteins most of them mannosylated. Several proteins are covalently bound to the cell wall glucan (glucan-associated proteins (GAPs)) and the most abundant class of GAP is linked to 1,6 b-glucan through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Modulation of GAPs may be observed in different physiological states and upon challenge of the organism with environmental stresses. In this study we used a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis based proteomic approach to examine different GAP patterns between control, drug-treated and drug-resistant cells. We analyzed the 2DE proteomes of sensitive and micafungin resistant strains along with the proteomes of these strains after treatment with sublethal doses of micafungin. Results, showed an up-regulation of a 29 kDa protein, identified as Pga29/Rdh3, in the micafungin resistant strain and a further increased expression of this protein in the same strain after the treatment with micafungin. Pga29/Rdh3 was previously identified as a GPI protein up-regulated in cells grown in presence of iron and down-regulated during the transition from yeast to hyphae. Recently Pga29/Rdh3 was involved in the host-pathogen interaction; deletion of this protein attenuated the virulence and diminished the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the host. Our results suggest that overexpression of Pga29/Rdh3 in micafungin-resistant strain may be a strategy of C. albicans to balance the toxic effects of the micafungin increasing the virulence of the pathogen.Several diseases are characterized by changes in the expressed glycoproteins both in the cell glycocalyx and soluble in the sera. These serum expressed glycoproteins may be used in non-invasive methods for diagnoses. Plant seed lectins are sugar-binding proteins, characterized by their high specificity toward the carbohydrate structure. Many of these proteins, have already been reported to recognize carbohydrate-specific configurations of the cancer cell glycocalyx. In order to evaluate the use of this lectinsoluble glycoconjugate interaction, in cancer diagnosis, a Sepharose-immobilized glucose-binding lectin, isolated from the Dioclea altissima seeds (DAL) was used to investigate the presence of possible biomarkers in prostatic disease patient sera. Thus, serum samples from patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer (PCa) or no prostatic disease (NPD) were subjected to affinity chromatography on Sepharose-DAL columns. This matrix was able to retain several glycoproteins present in the sera of patients with the three pathophysiological conditions studied. The retained glycoproteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and by mass spectrometry (MS). The electrophoretic profile of the isolated glycoproteins revealed an additional protein band in samples from patients with prostate cancer. Additionally, a total of 111 glycoproteins were identified by MS and, among them, 6 unique to prostate cancer patient sera. These results suggest the discovery of a new biomarker for prostate cancer that can be used in a non-invasive method for prostate cancer diagnosis. Overexpression of proteins in E. coli is considered to be a routine today, at least when the protein is soluble and not otherwise toxic for the host. We report here the preparation of the functional dual regulation system for overexpression of heterologous gene in Escherichia coli based on pKL1 plasmid properties. This system allows us to control the expression of heterologous proteins on two levels. On the first level the copy number of expression vector is controlled, while on the second level we control the target gene transcription. The key feature of this system is an expression plasmid containing two origins of replication. Replicon pSC101 ensures a low copy number of expression vector in non-induced cells, while replicon pKL1 ensures a high copy number in cells after induction. The first step in creating such an expression system was the preparation of a bacterial strain carrying genes for trans-elements of plasmids pSC101 and pKL1 on its chromosome. An integration cassette was created. Using plasmid vector it was transferred into a host cell and by double homologous recombination at the lac operon site the cassette was integrated into a chromosome. Our system of dual regulation of gene expression based on properties of pKL1 plasmid is highly efficient and at the same time small enough so it does not represent a significant metabolic burden for the host cell. Introduction: The prognosis in glioblastoma, the most malignant adult glial brain tumor, remains poor in spite of the advances in treatment procedures, including surgical resection and chemotherapy. Tissue and serum proteomic analysis represents an original application of SELDI-TOF MS technology that can expand the use of clinical proteomics and may provide a panel of tissue and/or serum biomarkers for early identification and monitoring disease progression. The purpose of this research was to show that there are major differences in the protein expression patterns in the tumors of GBM patients that correlate with disease activity. Methods: We investigated serum proteome analysis in 32 serum samples (16 glioblastoma patients and 16 normal controls) based on surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF) using CM10 ProteinChip Arrays. In parallel, to further optimize the clinical compatibility of SELDI-TOF profiling, we introduced a new strategy consisting in analysis of tumor tissue samples from patients with glioblastoma. Results: Samples were run to examine the contribution of sample batch and time to peak detection variability. Optimal instrument settings, regular calibration along with controlled sample handling and processing nearly doubled the number of peaks detected and intensity variance. The protein profiles were analyzed with the Protein Chip Data Manager Software 3.0.7. Conclusions: This research was designed to be a preliminary study and as such our findings does not necessarily hold prognostic information. If these results can be repeated in a prospective study, it may have an impact on clinical decision making. SEL-DI-TOF MS technology is a proteomics approach that can rapidly identify tens of thousands of proteins. However, it is challenging work to validate, prioritize, and select the best targets from those candidate proteins. This work was supported by Grant ",

            "text": "Determination of protein-protein interaction in tellurite resistance using affinity pull-down four Ter proteins were successfully expressed using Duet Vectors system. To verify activity of the proteins these were co-expressed in one cell obtaining characteristic black phenotype. In a pulldown assay TerD and TerE proteins were expressed as a fusion proteins in E. Coli. Immobilized proteins with HisTag were then incubated with cell lysate of E. coli with plasmid pLK18 that was proved to confer the resistance for potassium tellurite. After a series of wash steps the entire complexes has been eluted from the affinity support using competitive analyte elution. Potential interacting partners were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently by HPLC analyses. In the last years, several studies have been focused on the mechanisms underlying neural differentiation, a complex process coordinated by specific extracellular signals playing a critical role in the formation of neuronal connections. This process involves the activation of multiple serial events that can be regulated and influenced by secreted molecules that may determine and coordinate neurogenesis. Therefore, the characterization of secreted proteins during neural differentiation is one of the main goals of the proteomic approach applied to neuroscience. Recent studies reported the characterization of proteins released from neurons, astrocytes and neural precursor cells by 2DE and LC-MS/MS (1) . Although it was demonstrated that the secreted extracellular pool was specific for a given cell population, the pattern of secreted proteins involved in the neural differentiation has not been yet elucidated. In this study, the secretome of mes-c-myc A1 cell line (2), generated from mouse embryonic mesencephalon, was investigated during the late phase of neural differentiation (from 3rd to 6th day of differentiation) by shot-gun LC-MS/MS analysis. A specific subsets of extracellular proteins (e.g. annexin A2, glia-derived nexin, biglycan, follistatin, SPARC, fibulin-1, cystatin-C, clusterin) secreted during neural differentiation was identified. The presented work provides the basis to clarify the complex extracellular protein networks implicated in neural differentiation. Lipid-rafts are membrane microdomains particularly enriched in glycosphingolipids (GSLs) involved in the information transduction process across the membrane. The great interest for such domains is due to the observation that some membrane associated proteins are highly concentrated in lipid rafts, even if the overall protein content of these membrane areas is very low. It has been assumed that the trapping of certain proteins in lipid rafts might be somehow functional to their biological role, i.e. their involvement in signal transduction processes. GSL-protein interactions can be investigated by cell photolabelling experiments using radioactive photoactivable GSLs, which yield, when illuminated, a very reactive intermediate that covalently binds to the molecules in the environment, i.e. proteins.1, 2 In this context, we have designed a fatty acid probe with two nitrophenylazide photoactivable groups, one at position 2 and the other at the end of the acyl chain. The conjugation of the fatty acid to a radioactive glycosphingolipid generates a species to be used for photolabelling experiments allowing the simultaneous identification of the proteins belonging to the cytoplasmatic and the extracellular leaflets of the membrane. Herein we describe a general synthetic strategy to obtain not commercially available a, x-diamino acids, the synthetic precursors of the labelled fatty acids, which we have applied to the synthesis of a C-18 derivative. Furthermore, it will be described the preparation of a photolabelled radioactive GSL as a case study. Eukaryotic membranes contain specialized domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, also termed lipid rafts, which can be isolated as detergent-resistant membranes (DRM). These specialized domains are more ordered and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer and compartmentalize cellular processes such as signaling, protein trafficking and adhesion. Sialidase Neu3 is the membrane-associated form of mammalian sialidases, exhibit-ing high substrate specificity toward gangliosides, a sub-class of sphingolipids, but its distribution between DRM and non-DRM is not clearly established. To obtain new insights concerning Neu3 distribution during its biosynthesis and degradation processes, we expressed the murine sialidase Neu3 tagged with the HA and GFP epitopes using the inducible-expression model HeLa tTA2 Tet-OFF. A significant decrease in GM3 and GD1a was observed together with an increase in LacCer in Neu3-HA-GFP induced cells compared to non-induced cells, demonstrating that the chimeric protein is enzymatically active. The newly synthesized protein resulted to be initially associated to non-DRM and, after 48 hours of expression, reached a steady-state distribution of 45% in DRM and 55% in non-DRM. By switching-off the promoter, we found that the half-life of the enzyme is roughly 8 hours. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 preserved the enzyme from degradation and caused accumulation of Neu3-HA-GFP in intracellular aggregates, suggesting that the protein is degraded by the proteasome machinery. We are currently investigating whether the DRM or the non-DRM pool of the protein are preferential target of the degradation process. Glycosylation regulates protein folding, distribution and numerous biological processes. An aberrant glycosylation has been implicated in several human disorders, as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) binds a 21-bp DNA sequence (RE1), resulting in transcriptional repression in neural progenitors; as these cells differentiate, REST declines allowing the expression of repressed genes, while it remains active in non-neural cells. REST is a zinc finger protein containing a DNA-binding domain and two repressor domains, one at the N-terminus, which interacts with mSin3, and the other one at the C-terminus, which interacts with CoREST: they act as platforms where different chromatin-modifying enzymes can bind to repress gene transcription. REST expected molecular weight, calculated from the sequence, is 116 kDa while the apparent molecular weight ranges from 120 to 220 kDa, we investigated any contribution of glycosylation status to REST molecular weight. Using different combinations of deglycosylating enzymes, we hypothesize the presence of Oand N-linked glycan chains: mass spectrometry profiling of glycans released from REST confirmed the presence of hybrid Nlinked chains, composed of mannose, galactose and N-AcetylGlucosamine. REST contains seven putative N-linked glycosylation sites, two of which are located in the mSin3 interaction domain (Asn59, Asn83) and another one in proximity to the CoREST interaction domain (Asn1000). We carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies to generate single-and multiple-glycosylation site mutants of REST, which were tested for their ability to repress gene expression of a Luciferase reporter gene bearing a RE1 sequence. We observed that, unlike wild-type REST, non-glycosylated REST on Asn59 and Asn83 can't repress transcription of Luciferase: these results confirm that glycan chains on REST protein are crucial to modulate its transcriptional activity. Cardiac valves are specialized forms of cardiovascular connective tissue designed to bear high mechanical stresses during the normal cardiac cycle. Cardiac valves are dynamic structures, that remodel in response to changes in local mechanical forces, and exhibit a complex architecture highly specialized, consisting of cells and extracellular matrix enriched in proteoglycans (PGs), glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), collagen and elastic fibers. Mechanical properties of extracellular matrix are critically important for a better performance and durability of heart tissue valve substitutes [1] . During the last 15 years, tissue engineering (TE) approaches emerged in response to limitations associated to valve bioprostheses. Aim of this study is to characterize the specific GAG composition and structure in the leaflet and commissure of aortic and pulmonary valves before and after decellularization procedures finalized to obtain a scaffold for cell repopulation. Free GAGs were obtained from selected portions of leaflets, sinuses, and artery wall of porcine valves. GAG content and distribution were assessed on both fresh and decellularized specimens. GAG structural analysis was performed after depolimerization and fluorescent derivatization of the products. The disaccharide analysis was conducted by fluorophore-assisted polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (FACE). Results showed that total GAG concentration was reduced after decellularization and the loss mainly regards hyaluronan and an under-sulfate chondroitin sulfate isomer in the three areas selected. In conclusion, decellularization treatment affected the distribution of valve proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. The functional consequences of their selective depletion may have a large impact on the cell repopulation potential of the scaffold. Hyaluronan (HA) oligosaccharides stimulated pro-inflammatory responses in different cell types by modulating both the CD44 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). The activation of these receptor is also mediated by collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) that through two different pathways ends with the liberation of NF-kB which, in turn, stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-18 and Il-33 deeply involved in rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of small fragments of HA on mouse synovial fibroblasts obtained from normal DBA/J1 mice or subjected to CIA. Normal synovial fibroblasts (NSF) and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF) showed no up-regulation of CD44 and TLR-4 mRNA expression and the related proteins, as well as no activation of NF-kB. Very low levels of both mRNA and related proteins were also detected for IL-18 and IL-33. Treatment of NSF and RASF with HA oligosaccharides significantly increased all the parameters in both groups, while to a major extent in RASF CIA. The addition to both NSF and RASF of hyaluronan binding protein (HABP), that inhibited HA activity, was able to reduce HA effects and the consequent inflammatory response The lectin CV-IIL from opportunistic human pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum shows ability to bind L-fucose and D-mannose with high affinity. There are two calcium ions in the carbohydrate binding site, which mediate binding of the saccharides [1] . The crystal structure of CV-IIL reveals one water molecule, which plays a special role by bridging sugar with backbone nitrogen atom and with the side chain of the amino acid threonine in position 97. Therefore, several representatives from different groups of amino acids were chosen for the mutagenesis in this position. The extensive thermodynamical analysis was performed using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, which allows to obtain complete thermodynamical profiles of the lectin-saccharide interaction from a single experiment. For each prepared mutant lectin, the interaction was measured with high affinity ligand a Me-fucoside at different temperatures in the range from 10\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C at constant pressure. In addition to estimation of enthalpy and entropy contributions to the interaction, these detail measurements allow the determination of the heat capacity Cp. Accurate values of Cp for individual mutants allow partial discrimination of the entropy change associated with the solvent release and the loss of configurational entropy. Two major contributions to the binding entropy are the change in configuration and solvation entropy which will be discussed. The process of ligand binding is very complex and complicated, however, better understanding of thermodynamical parameters and their structural origin could provide new insights for the development of better molecular design strategies and potent anti-adhesion therapeutics. As the accumulation of HA into vessel wall supports neointima formation and cardiovascular diseases progression, we studied the regulation of HA synthesis and, in this work, we assayed whether its production could be controlled by nutrients availability. The excess of glucose could enter in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) that could increase the concentration of the HA precursor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNac) leading to an increase of HA synthesis. The UDP-GlcNAc produced by the HBP regulates the O-GlcNacylations of proteins on serine and threonine residues. In light of these issues the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate HA metabolism could represent new strategies to develop anti-atherosclerotic drugs.In this study, we tested the influence of different compounds to stimulate or reduce the flux through the HBP in the regulation of HA biosynthesis in hAoSMCs. We found that the inhibition of O-GlcNacylation strongly reduced HA production whereas treatments that induced protein O-GlcNacylation increased HA secretion. Gene expression studies done by quantitative RT-PCR revealed that HAS2 mRNA was the most sensible to O-GlcNacylation. Although factors governing constitutive HAS2 transcription are yet to be established, we found evidences that the transcription regulator YY1 activates HAS2 expression. Interestingly, experiments with wheat germ agglutinin, that specifically binds GlcNAc, and recombinant 6myc-HAS2 revealed that HAS2 was O-GlcNacylated causing an increased activity. As cell migration and adhesiveness are critical for neointima formation and progression, we quantified this two issues and found that O-GlcNacylation increased cell invasion and inflammatorycell recruitment. These data highlight the critical role of precursor availability and HBP to control cell microenvironment and behaviour. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a b-galactoside binding protein, a key lectin which regulates (patho)physiological processes of innate and acquired immunity. Generally considered a powerful pro-inflammatory signal, Gal-3 triggers/promotes monocyte respiratory burst, acts as a monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant and promotes survival of inflammatory cells. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of exogenous Gal-3 on the (patho)physiology of monocytic lineage cells and ascertain the level of Gal-3 expression in said cells. Using cytokine capture beads and flow cytometry we studied the effect of recombinant human Gal-3 on inflammatory cytokine secretion of classically (M1) or alternatively activated (M2a/c) macrophages. PBMC-derived monocytes from healthy volunteers were exposed to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), IFN-c and LPS to generate M1 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4/IL-10 to generate M2a/c cells. M1 polarization was confirmed by elevated TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 in culture medium and lack of CD206 mannose receptor in respect to M2 macrophages. Dead cells were excluded by 7AAD. Used Gal-3 concentration did not induce significant apoptosis. Our data indicate IL-8 could be considered a novel M1 vs. M2 polarization marker. Exogenous Gal-3 was shown to upregulate IL-6 and IL-8 in M2a cells and TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 in M2c cells, skewing M2 towards the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype.The expression level of Gal-3 was determined by Western blotting in monocytes, M1 and M2a/c cells. Preliminary data show difference in number and molecular weight of discrete Gal-3 isotypes in monocytes and M1, M2a and M2c macrophage subtypes. Significant variability of Gal-3 expression was also detected in samples obtained from different healthy blood donors. Collected data provide new insights into Gal-3 biological roles and contribute setting up a platform for development of new anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches.",

The role of serglycin in malignancies has been studied only in multiple myeloma, where is constitutively secreted by myeloma cells and inhibits both bone mineralization and complement system activation. The aim of our study was to examine the role of serglycin in breast cancer biology. RT-PCR analysis revealed the high expression of serglycin in the most aggressive breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 compared to the low expression in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, which show low metastatic potential. The expression of serglycin by breast cancer cells was confirmed in tissues from breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. Serglycin was localized mostly in the cytoplasm and less on the cell membrane in MDA-MB-231 and tumor cells in breast cancer biopsies. Serglycin was constitutively secreted in detectable levels only in aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells. It was isolated from culture medium from MDA-MB-231 cells by combined anionexchange and gel-permeation chromatographies. Isolated serglycin carries CS-side chains as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and capillary electrophoresis before and after treatment with specific enzymes. Solid phase microtiter binding assays revealed the interaction of serglycin isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells with C1q with similar affinity to that of serglycin isolated from myeloma cells. Serglycin was also found to inhibit the classical pathway of complement system using hemolytic assays. Our results show for the first time that serglycin is highly expressed and constitutively secreted from the aggressive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Moreover, it carries CS chains, binds C1q and inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation implying a role of serglycin in the protection of cancer cells against immune system attack.",

Due to good thermostability of target proteins, temperature clean-up of cell lysate has been optimized. LecB, the gene coding PA-IIL lectin from bacterium P. aeruginosa, was chosen as a primary target gene to be modified via random mutagenesis. This soluble protein is well-characterized and it shows very high affinity for L-fucose but it can bind several monosaccharides with similar stereochemistry [1] . The aim of this work is to produce mutants with interestedly modified specificity and/or affinity for monosaccharides. The mutated lectins with improved properties could be further used in biotechnology and for bioanalytical purposes. The proteoglycan (PG) Versican is a primary constituent of the extracellular matrix, involved in cellular processes and molecular interactions, as well as in the embryonal development. In particular, Versican seems involved in the control of Neural Crest Cells (NCC) migration. The NCC are embryonic stem cells which segregate from the dorsal part of the neural tube and undergo extensive and coordinated movements, giving rise to different cell types. Several studies were performed to understand the role of Versican in the NCC migration but untill now the real effect of the PG in this cellular process does not seem entirely clear. In a previous study, we cloned the Xenopus laevis Versican gene, defined its spatiotemporal distribution and performed loss of function experiments. The results obtained showed an involvment of Xversican during the NCC migration. We found that Xversican exhibits two different genes and a total of 6 splicing variants, while both gene expression analysis and loss of function experiments suggested that Versican may exert a promoting effect on NCC migration in contrast to the inhibitory effect of other molecules such as Aggrecan. In this work, we investigate the interactions between Versican and NCC. To better understand the role of Xversican during the NCC migration, further loss of function experiments were performed by injection of two splicing morpholinos able to block the carboxyl terminus of the Versican. Besides, gain of function experiments were carried out confronting NCC migration to stripes of Versican protein. In particular, NCC were dissected from an early neurula of Xenopus embryos and cultured in vitro on plastic dishes coated with fibronectin alone, Versican alone, or a mixture of Versican and fibronectin. The findings obtained confirm that Versican is fundamental for a proper NCC migration. In particular, the presence of this PG is required in order to promote the transition of the NCC from a premigratory state to an active state of migration. Myoglobin from horse skeletal muscle (MB) was used as a model protein for modification with monosaccharides, disaccharides and a-oxo-aldehydes as glycating factors (GF). The high temperature incubation in water condition (HTW), high temperature incubation in dry condition (HTD) and incubation in microwaves environment (HMW) were performed to obtain the glycation products. The HMW method was the most effective and allowed to decrease the time reaction to several minutes and lowering the reaction temperature. Effective formation of high molecular mass products of MB glycation with monosaccharides or disaccharides was observed at 1:100 molar ratio of MB/GF. However, modification of MB with 100 molar excess of a-oxo-aldehyde methylglyoxal leads to receive insoluble derivatives just after lyophilization even if they did not undergo temperature or microwaves action. Decreasing of molar ratio MB/GF to 1:32 mol/mol was necessary when modification of MB was provided by methyglyoxal. The MB glycation products obtained in HMW and HTD methods differed in molecular mass and fluorescence ability from these formed during HTW. Furthermore, we have shown in ELISA tests and immunoblotting significant differences of investigated compounds in immunoreactivity. High molecular mass glycated mioglobin derivatives obtained with HTW method do not react, contrary to glycation products of HMW or HTD synthesis, with poly-or monoclonal anti-AGE antibodies obtained in our laboratory. The ability of parasitic organisms in their developmental stages to adhere to the surface of the host cell is the first step for invasion and infectivity. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a clinically important pathogen, which is responsible for numerous nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients. The bacterium colonises patients with chronic lung diseases and its infection is fatal in cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa produces high levels of D-galactose and L-fucose binding lectins, PA-IL (LecA) and PA-IIL (LecB) respectively, which are associated with its cytotoxic virulence and could be involved in primary recognition of the host organism and in biofilm formation [1] . Moreover, the PA-IIL lectin displays an affinity for fucose in micromolar range, unusually high for monosaccharide binding. [2] .Past and recent data suggest that glycosphingolipids (GSLs) can be opportunely modified at the plasma membrane level by the action of enzymes involved in their metabolism, working in concert directly at the cell surface. Many reports indicate the presence of glycosil-transferases and glycohydrolases associated to the external side of the plasma membrane. We previously demonstrated that plasma membrane-associated b-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) is composed of fully processed subunits and share biochemical properties with the lysosomal counterpart, thus indicating its lysosomal origin (1, 2) . In addition, this form is active towards its natural substrate GM2 ganglioside. In this work we show that the overexpression of Hex a-subunit-GFP fusion protein in HEK293 cells induced an increase of Hex A isoenzyme (ab dimer) at both lysosomal and plasma membrane levels and the formation of Hex S (aa dimer). Confocal microscopy analysis clearly demonstrated that the fusion protein is targeted to lysosomes and cell surface where colocalizes with the lipophilic membrane dye DiQ, in restricted areas. In addition, biochemical characterization evidenced that the lipid microdomain-associated enzyme is fully processed. DEAE cellulose chromatography of purified lipid microdomains demonstrated the presence of all Hex isoenzymes (Hex B, Hex A and Hex S). Interestingly, Hex a-subunit overexpression resulted in a strong increase of lipid microdomains-associated Hex, but also of bgalactosidase, with respected to mock and control cells. These observations clearly indicated that the levels of soluble and membrane-associated Hex A depend to HEXA gene expression and that the recruitment of the metabolically related glycohydrolases Hex and Gal in lipid microdomains is regulated in a coordinated manner.Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major polypeptide mitogen for mesenchymal cells. It can be produced by fibrosarcoma cells as well as by stroma cells. It has been considered to participate in malignant processes including autocrine transformation and human oncogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that free chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) chains which are abundant in the tumor pericellular matrix, can specifically affect the PDGF-dependent initiation of cell cycle, migration and attachment of human fibrosarcoma cells. We demonstrated that the effect of chondroitin sulphate A was not due to transcriptional up regulation of platelet derived growth factor receptors genes, but rather to more efficient phosphorylation of its tyrosine kinase receptors. Collectively our data point to a possible involvement of an unknown CS A -binding proteoglycan which has the ability to regulate the phosphorylation of PDGFRs. A very promising candidate is the transmembrane receptor CD44 which has recently been shown by co-immunoprecipitation to be in close proximity to the PDGF-Rb. Using stable HT1080 transfectants with CD44 knock down, we showed that ht1080 cells can physically bind CSA through their CD44 receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDGF-mediated signaling triggers a transient morphological alteration in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells that can be monitored by the impedance change in the xCELLigence System (Roche). This alteration is dose dependently influenced by CSA chains in a CD44-dependent manner. This finding was verified by western blot quantification of phosphorylated PDGF-Rb, demonstrating the direct involvement of CD44 to the CSA-mediated regulation of the PDGF-induced functions in human fibrosarcoma cells.",

These hormones exert their action through binding to specific receptors. The aim of this study was immunohistochemical investigation of age related hormone receptor distribution in rat ovaries. Thirty female Wistar-albino rats were used in the investigation. These rats were divided into five groups according to age: young (22 days), prepubertal (4 weeks), adult (10 weeks), premenopausal (8 months) and old (2 years). Six rats allocated in each age group. Indirect immunostaining was performed on paraffin embedded ovarian tissue sections, using specific antibodies to estrogen receptor alpha (ER-a), progesterone receptor (PR) and follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR). Immunostained slides were evaluated by light microscopy. Age-related decrease in ER-a immunostaining and increase in PR immunostaining were observed. In all age groups PR immunostaining was detected in zona pellucida. Starting from puberty, FSHR immunostaining was declined in granulosa cells while increased in teka interna. On the other hand in premenopausal group FSHR immunostaining was decreased in teka interna cells. In this study, immunohistochemical localization of the estrogen, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone receptors were demonstrated in the rat ovaries. Differential distributions of these reproductive hormone receptors were found to be associated with age related alterations in rat ovaries. In mESC TFII-I occupies most of the target promoters and this binding is completely opposite in ET where BEN recognizes the same binding sites. In ET the TFII-I occupancy sites are either lost or replaced by BEN and only a small fraction of these sites is still bound by TFII-I. On a contrary, in ET the promoter sites occupied by BEN are rarely switched to the TFII-I binding. The TFII-I occupancy does not correlate with the expression level of the target genes in mESC, however, we noticed a significant association with the H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 bivalent marks, a hallmark feature of genes important in development and differentiation.",

It is formed by four subunits, called ''adaptins'': b, c1, l1 and d. In eukaryotic organisms, two different AP1 complexes are identified: AP1A and AP1B, differing in their medium subunit, l1A or l1B respectively. AP1A regulates vesicular transport of cargos between the TGN and endosomes, while AP1B is involved in polarized sorting to the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells. We used zebrafish as animal model to understand the role of l1A and l1B during vertebrate development. In silico analysis reveals two different genes, ap1m1 and ap1m2, orthologues of mammalia l1A and l1B adaptins. RT-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) point out that l1A is ubiquitously expressed, while l1B is mainly expressed in endoderm-derived organs such as gut, pronephric ducts, liver and pancreas. Localization of mRNA expression is confirmed by sectioning embryos after WISH. To better understand the role of l1 subunit during zebrafish development, two splice-inhibiting morpholinos have been used (ap1m1MO and ap1m2MO). We performed a detailed in vivo analysis on single and double morphants. Single morphants show a slight delay of hatching and mobility defects but no significant defects appear during organogenesis. Down-regulation of both genes causes apoptotic cell death in brain regions, as confirmed by acridine orange assay and WISH analysis. Using different key markers (i.e. prox1, pax2.1, ngn1 and nrd), we identified strong morphogenetic defects in early pronephros development, both in l1B-depleted embryos and in double morphants. At the same time, double morphants show severe neuro-developmental impairments compared to wild type embryos.

The in vivo toxicity of titanium nanoparticles is manifested by the induction of inflammatory states or by the occurrence of genotoxic and cytotoxic effects that usually depend on the particle size and, therefore its surface area, photocatalytic activity and their tendency to aggregate. However we not found studies in the literature on the importance of temperature on the biological effects of nanoparticles in unicellular eukaryotes. Consequently, the main purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of temperature in Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth, when exposed to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. S. cerevisiae UE-ME3, wild-type yeast, belonging to the enology laboratory collection of University of \u00c9 vora, and BY4741, a Invitrogenese strain, growing at mid exponential phase in liquid YEPD medium with 2% (w/v) glucose, at 25, 28, 30 or 40\u00b0C, were exposed during 200 minutes, to 0.1 or 1.0 micg/ml of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, prepared by sonication, at same temperature conditions, except in case of cells grown at 28\u00b0C that were also further exposed to 40 Celsius degrees, during the same range time (200 minutes). Samples of each treatment were used to obtain the post-12000 g supernatant, which were used for protein content and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) activity determinations. The results show that UE-ME3 strain exhibit a glucose-6-P dehydrogenase activities levels higher than values expressed by BY4741 strain, growing in the temperature ranging from 25 to 30\u00b0C. The titanium dioxide nanoparticles caused a significantly decrease of the same enzymatic activity (p < 0.01) in UE-ME3 (10%) and BY4741 (16%) yeast cells growing at 28\u00b0C and subject to the heat-shock 28-40\u00b0C.

Aime Centro di Imaging Molecolare-Unito Molecular imaging is emerging as a novel multidisciplinary approach that combines biology, chemistry and biomedical imaging. It has been developed for the visualization of patho-physiological processes at cellular and sub-cellular levels. MRI, among the currently available imaging modalities, stands for its excellent spatial resolution and low invasiveness, but it suffers from an intrinsic low sensitivity. Among the proposed MRI contrast agents, CEST (Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) ones are under intense scrutiny, in virtue of their ability to generate a frequency encoded contrast with common proton MRI protocols. Through this mechanism, the contrast can be switched on and off at will, changing the radiofrequency pulse, thus making possible the detection of more agents simultaneously present in the same anatomical region. Liposomes loaded with paramagnetic agents (LipoCEST) resulted to be a class of high sensitivity systems as all the water molecules contained in their inner cavities represent the pool of exchangeable protons that, upon applying the proper irradiation field, markedly affect the intensity of the water signal in the region where they distribute. Moreover nonspherical liposomes further widen the field of use of LipoCEST agents. Discoidal shaped cells are supposed to interact with the magnetic field in an analogous way as these phospholipids based particles. Results concerning the use of neutral paramagnetic Shift Reagents as cell labelling probes able to induce large shift on the intracellular water protons will be presented. The sensitivity of the proposed labelling procedure has been assessed in vitro on murine macrophagic cells (J774.1). It has been shown that CEST effect is still detectable when the labelled cells are of the order of 10% of the total cells' ensemble. Moreover we will report a proof of concept on the possibility to distinguish in the MR image different cells populations present in the same anatomical region. The relatively poor sensitivity of MRI modality when applied for molecular imaging purposes has prompted the development of systems able to deliver a high number of MR imaging reporters to the biological target of interest. Several nano-sized carriers have been considered so far including naturally-occurring systems such as proteins, virus capsids or lipoproteins. This search prompted us to consider the micron-sized platform of yeast cell wall particles (YCWPs). The peculiar chemical stability of yeast walls allows the setup of a new loading protocol in which the particle inner cavity acts as a micro-reactor for the formation of paramagnetic emulsions from water insoluble Gd-complexes. As far as the MRI properties are concerned, the formation of the microemulsion inside the yeast shell has two important advantages: (i) an increased paramagnetic density is obtained, and (ii) an enhanced relaxivity per paramagnetic center as a consequence of the restricted rotational motion of the paramagnetic agent can be reached. The Gd-loaded YCWPs were characterized by 1H-relaxometry measuring the longitudinal relaxivity at 20 MHz and 25\u00b0C and the relaxivity (per Gd 3+ ion) was 22.3 m/M/s, a value ca. 50% higher than that reported for the same chelate embedded in a liposome membrane. It was estimated that each YCWP is loaded with ca. 1.6 \u00b7 107 Gd 3+ ions, thus yielding a relaxivity per particle of 3.5 \u00b7 108 m/M/s. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest molecular relaxivity ever measured for a Gd-based agent. The high affinity of YCWP to cells of the immune system could be exploited to label, ex vivo or in vivo, such cells with the aim of tracking them by MRI. Preliminary experiments, performed on murine macrophages, have demonstrated a high Tin or stannous (Sn 2+ ) compounds are used as catalysts, stabilizers in plastic industries, wood preservatives, agricultural biocides, and in nuclear medicine. Due to the wide application of these compounds, organic and inorganic forms of Sn 2+ are found in many life forms and have accumulated in the food chain. To verify how Sn 2+ is taken up, distributed and detoxified, we used cell survival assays and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) along with a multi-elemental procedure known as particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Our PIXE analysis showed that XV185-14c yeast cells demonstrate a significant loss of intracellular elements such as Mg, Zn, S, Fe and an increase in P levels after 1 hour exposure to 25 mM SnCl 2 in stationary phase. The survival assay showed that Fet4p and Zrt2p, both low-affinity iron and zinc transporters, respectively, may internalize Sn 2+ . Moreover, qRT-PCR showed an increase in gene expression of CCH1 and MID1, which encode the cytoplasmic transmembrane Ca 2+ transporters Cch1p and Mid1p. This could indicate increased cytosolic Ca 2+ entry that is critical for survival under a variety of stress conditions in yeast. Our data also indicate that once inside the cell, Sn 2+ may be transported from the cytosol to the vacuole by a P-type ATPase (Pmc1p) or may be chelated by Crs5p metallothionein in the cytosol. Alternatively, Sn 2+ may generate reactive oxygen species inducing direct cellular injury and stress-generated activation of many genes, including SOD1, YAP1, and APN1.

Glycolysis is essential for the bloodstream form of this parasite, but glucose is also a substrate for the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This pathway serves two very important purposes: it is responsible for maintenance of the redox level in the parasite, by production of NADPH, and for the synthesis of the ribose 5-phosphate that is used for nucleotides production. The enzyme ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (Rpi) catalyses the reversible isomerization between ribulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate, at the end of oxidative branch of the PPP. Two types of Rpi exist: RpiA, that is broadly distributed among eukaryotic organisms, in metazoa as well as fungi, and in some bacteria; and RpiB that is found in most prokaryotic organisms. Previous studies showed that trypanosomatids possess the isoform RpiB that is not homologous to the RpiA found in human. We performed some kinetic and functional studies of the RpiB from T. brucei. The gene of the T. brucei RpiB (TbRpiB) has 458 bp and has been cloned in pET28a. The protein was expressed, with an N-terminal His-tag, in a soluble form and purified by affinity chromatography. The active form of the TbRpiB is a homodimer and this recombinant enzyme showed a K m = 1.26 \u00b1 0.49 mM, that is similar to this kinetic parameter described for the corresponding enzyme from T. cruzi and some bacteria. By site-direct mutagenesis we constructed two mutants, substituting the catalytic residue Cys69 by Ala (TbRpiB-C69A) and Pro (TbRpiB-C69P). The TbRpiB-C69A was expressed in soluble form, purified and showed no activity, demonstrating that TbRpiB has a similar catalytic behavior as the other RpiBs.

The liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, is important parasite of livestock, causing liver damage, anaemia and weight loss of animals. The treatment of liver fluke infections relies on administration of benzimidazole drugs, especially triclabendazole (TCBZ). However, the observed resistance to TCBZ could put at risk the future use of these drugs. The aim of our project was to investigate if TCBZ-resistant isolate could be made more sensitive to action of another anthemintic drug, albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ.SO), in presence of a metabolic inhibitor methimazole (MTZ). MTZ, inhibitor of the flavin monooxygenase system (FMO), was used in 100 lM concentration for 2 hours pre-incubation of flukes. They were further incubated for 22 hours in NCTC medium containing MTZ and ABZ.SO (35 lM). To evaluate the effect of MTZ, other group of flukes was incubated with ABZ.SO alone (without MTZ) for 22 hours (35 lM). The action of drug treatment itself and drug treatment following metabolic inhibition were assessed as morphological changes of flukes' bodies by means of electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the surface changes, which showed to be more severe after co-incubation with MTZ than the drug on its own. Changes in other structures were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Our attention was focused on inner structure of surface layer (tegument), muscles, gut, male and female reproductive system (testis and vitellaria). Incubation of flukes with ABZ.SO and MTZ led to more severe changes in all examined structures except gut than incubation with the drug alone. The obtained results support the idea of altered drug metabolism in TCBZ-resistant flukes and suggest that this process may be involved in the development of drug resistance.

Thus, if the subject is known to have a risk factor for thrombosis, it will be more suitable if the drug is not used. Enzyme inhibitors have received an increasing attention, not only because they constitute good tools for the study of enzyme structures and reaction mechanisms, but also for their potential utilization in pharmacology and agriculture. In particular, protease inhibitors play an important role in activating target proteases in the pathogenic process of human diseases. In this study, the effect of marine biological extracts, collected from the Gabes gulf in Tunisia, was evaluated on the extracellular proteolytic activity of Beauveria bassiana. All extracts exhibited inhibitory effect against the protease. However, only Caulerpa prolifera, Hippospongia communis and Posidonia oceanica extracts led to an inhibition greater than 50%. Interestingly, C. prolifera aqueous extract displayed total inhibition which was dose dependent. This inhibitory activity was abolished by boiling. The active ingredient was purified from C. prolifera extract by C18 reversed-phase followed by Gel-filtration chromatography allowing the isolation of a fraction with 62% of inhibition. C. prolifera extract may therefore be useful in developing new molecules with interesting potential of utilization in several biotechnological applications. Sexual selection is considered a major cause of speciation, acting in synergy with ecological selection or selection for species recognition. Understanding the relative contributions of diverse forms of selection may help to explain how and when in the history of a lineage one trait might have originated. In this regard, the genus Ophryotrocha represents an excellent model. The almost 30 species described so far have very similar morphologies and ecological habits, although their reproductive patterns differ greatly, ranging from simultaneous and sequential hermaphroditism to gonochorism. Until now, no molecular genetic support has been given to the several hypotheses suggested to explain the underlying evolutionary dynamics leading to the existing divergence. Here, we report a preliminary analysis of differentially expressed cDNAs in juvenile males and adult females of O. puerilis, a protandrous hermaphrodite, by cDNA-sequence-related amplified polymorphism (cDNA-SRAP), with the final goal to compare orthologous cDNAs from closely related species, e.g. the gonochoric O. labronica and the simultaneous hermaphrodite O. diadema. cDNAs from pooled juvenile males or adult females were amplified with 10 distinct primer pairs. For each sex, approx. 1,000 transcript-derived segments (TDSs) ranging in size between 0.2 and 2 Kbp were obtained. About 300 sex-specific TDSs, as well as shared products, were eluted from the PAGE gels and cloned in plasmid vectors for sequencing. Sequences were identified by similarity search using the WU-BLASTX and the FASTX programs with various matrices against the UniProt database. The majority of comparisons reported matches to predicted or unknown peptides. A substantial number of similarities were found to proteins with known function, although several were of bacterial origin. The vast majority of these belongs to the energy, metabolism and cell structure groups, while some were recognized as involved in sperm-egg interactions.",

Recently, a cDNA coding for a b-glycosydase from Diatraea saccharalis midgut (DsbGly) was sequenced using primers based on consensus sequences and a midgut cDNA library. The cDNA coding for DsbGly was cloned in pAE vector, expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 and purified by Ni+2-NTA agarose affinity chromatography. The enzyme is expressed in the anterior, middle and posterior regions of the midgut and is absent from other larval tissues. The recombinant enzyme has a K m of 0.85 mM and 3.2 mM with a relative V max /K m of 65 and 100 against the synthetic substrates pnitrophenyl b-D-glycopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl b-D-galactopyranoside, respectively, indicating that DsbGly is more active against galactosides than on glucosides. DsbGly is stable in pH values ranging from 5.1 to 8.6 and the ionization constants of the catalytic residues E379 (nucleophile) and E167 (donor proton) in the free enzyme are 5.20 and 7.25, respectively. The constants change to 4.94 and 8.51 in the enzyme-substrate complex, thus increasing the optimum pH value in 0.5 units. To understand the molecular bases of the proton donor pKa change, we modeled the DsbGly structure using as template the structures of the b-glycosidase from the termite Neotermes koshunensis with (1AI0) and without (3AHZ) substrate. Ramachandran plots of the models show that more than 94% of the residues are in favorable regions. Besides, superposition of the structures shows the same secondary elements and same position of the catalytical groups. Without substrate, E167 interacts only with N310 (2.83\u00c5 ), but in the presence of substrate, E167 can interact also with E170 and N227, due to the decrease in the residue distances. The presence of a negatively charged group (E170) in the vicinity of E167 may stabilize the H+ and be the main cause of the pKa increment. Supported by FAPESP, CNPq and INCT-Entomologia Molecular.",

The objective of the study was to optimise and validate the HPLC method for the determination of isoflavones genistein, daidzein, glycitein and metabolite equol in bovine rumen fluid. The experiment was carried out on three lactating Holstein cows fitted with rumen cannulas. The experiment lasted 14 days and was divided into an adaptation period (10 days) followed by a 4-days collecting period. Cows were fed individually twice daily the diet based on maize silage, lucerne hay and supplemental mixture that contained extruded full-fat soya as a source of isoflavones. During the collecting period individual samples of ruminal fluid were taken in five time intervals -T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4, it is prior feeding and 2, 4, 7, 10 hours post-feeding, respectively. Extruded full-fat soya used in the study contained 377.9 mg/kg of daidzein, 558.2 mg/kg of genistein and 129.6 mg/kg of glycitein, resulting in average total isoflavones intake of 1330. Odorant receptors (ORs) belong to a large family of GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptor) which are expressed in the olfactory neurons located in the nose. The ORs activated by a specific odorant couple to the Gaolf protein, which activates adenylyl cyclase III, resulting in the production of cAMP. The information released by the activation of ORs is then transmitted to specific regions of the brain, leading to odorant perception. The vast majority of human ORs are orphans. In this work we developed a heterologous system for the functional expression of human ORs in order to determine their ligands. ORs with already known ligands such as mORS6 (nonanedioic acid), mORI7 (heptanal) and mOREG (eugenol) were used as control. The importance of using accessory proteins to aid the OR transportation to the membrane or its function has been previously demonstrated. For this reason we used different concentrations of plasmids coding for the accessory proteins (RTP-1S and Ric-8B), Gaolf and also the pCRE-SEAP plasmid, which codes for the secreted alkaline phosphatase that is measured in our assay. We identified a group of 21 human-specific ORs by using bioinformatics methods and, among the ORs identified there is one (OR1G1), which has already been deorphanized and will be used as one of our controls in the experiments. This group of human-specific ORs has been used to test a set of 90 odorants of different chemical classes. In our experiments one of these receptors, OR5AC2, responds specifically to esters. Supported by FAPESP. 2) (cGT) is a key enzyme of the g-glutamyl cycle, able to transfer the c glutamyl moiety of glutathione (GSH) to acceptor molecules such as amino acids, peptides or simply to water. In studies performed in the nineties a c-DNA with an overall similarity of about 40% with human cGT was cloned, thus suggesting the existence of another enzyme, distinct from cGT, capable of splitting the isopeptide bond of GSH [1] . This enzyme, that has been defined as gGT-related (gGT-rel), has never been purified nor characterized, so that its existence as a functional enzyme as well as its possible specific role in GSH homeostasis and hence in the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of cell redox status, are still to be assessed. The only peculiar feature associated to gGT-rel is its strict specificity for GSH as substrate that appears to discriminate this enzyme from cGT. Besides GSH, gGT is in fact able to act on a series of chromogenic synthetic substrates which are normally used to measure cGT activity in biological samples. Thus, taking advantage of an optimized specific cGT-rel assay [2] and of the well known chromogenic assay for cGT with c-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as substrate, we were able to perform some protein purification steps from bovine kidney, in which the relative specific activity (c glutamyl-p-nitroanilide/GSH activity) could be monitored . Preliminary results are indicative of the actual presence of an enzyme activity, likely cGT-rel, that is distinct from gGT and is specific for GSH. The baculovirus expression system is widely used for recombinant protein production in insect cells and larvae due to the high pro-duction yields obtained and its biosafety conferred to the final product. Today about 20% of biological products are generated by this methodology. The most commonly used baculovirus is the Autographa californica multi-nucleopolyhedrovirus (Ac-MNPV). The powerful polyhedrin (PPH) virus promoter is extensively used to drive the production of the foreign proteins. However this promoter is very late, at infection stages where the cells are seriously impaired as consequence of infection. Insects are capable of storing large amounts of amino acids in specialized storage proteins. One of these storage proteins are the hexamerins. In this study we have analyzed and characterized the accumulation of three hexamerins (AJSP, BJSHP1 and BJSHP2) in the fifth instar larvae evolution stage of Trichoplusia ni (Cabbage looper). The upstream sequences of the encoding genes for these proteins were isolated and cloned in the AcMNPV expression vector. Their promoter activity was elucidated by using the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a reporter gene in Sf21 insect cell line. The AJSP and the BJSHP1 upstream regions showed an early but low eGFP expression. However, the BJSHP2 upstream region showed an early and strong promoter activity. Since the upstream element (BJSHP2) was about 1 kb in size, further characterization studies were addressed to determine the minimal promoter sequence, which maintain the promoter activity. Different configurations of this region in combination or not with other promoter and enhancer sequences were studied until obtaining a baculovirus vector with earlier and stronger foreign protein expression levels than conventional baculovirus vectors. The new developed vectors could improve the efficiency of the baculovirus expression system and also facilitate post-translational modifications of complex proteins. Although HBV replication and assembly are well understood, the early steps of the viral lifecycle are still unknown. Recent data have shown the implication of caveolae mediated endocytosis in the infectivity process of HBV, however the steps from internalization to viral replication remain obscure. In this study we examined the importance of endosomal-lysosomal system acidification as well as the role of redox potential and lysosomal proteases in HBV infection process. Ammonium chloride, lysosomotropic reagent, has no effect when added at time 0 in the infection process, however when added latter, increases the infectivity of HBV. When redox potential of the intracellular space was modified to a more reducing one, by adding DTT, the viral infectivity was boosted. Also, the inhibition of lysosomal cathepsin L results in a significant increase in HBV infectivity. All this data suggest that after entry into the host cell an important pull of viral particles is transported to the lysosomes where it is degraded. The modification of the lysosomal environment, helps the virus escape thus leading to a better infection of host cell. Interaction between transcription factors and DNA are essential for regulating gene transcription. The Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in cell signalling and its failure is a principal cause of several autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. We have developed an atomic force microscopy (AFM) method to quantitatively characterise the interaction force between NF-kB and DNA or LNA (locked nucleic acid) double strand molecules containing the NF responsive elements (RE). This process allows the simple testing and selection of LNA based decoy molecules to be used in NF-kB modulation decoy strategies. Furthermore the proposed methodology is also suitable for testing drug efficacy on the modulation of NF-kB binding to its nucleic acid target sequence. A biological AFM based sensor is therefore considered appropriate for characterising transcription factors and selecting molecules to modulate their activity.",

Terra Instituto de Qu\u0131\u1e3fica, Universidade de Sa\u02dco Paulo, Sa\u02dco Paulo, Brazil a -Mannosidases (a-man) are enzymes little known in insects that belong to family 47 or 38 of the class of glycoside hydrolases (GH).Two midgut a-man were purified by chromatographic methods from the beetle Tenebrio molitor midgut (Man1 and Man2). Man1 preferentially hydrolyzes mannosyl a-1,2-mannoside (M-a-1,2-M) and Man2 hydrolyzes M-a-1,3-M and M-a-1,6-M. A partial sequence of a-man (TmMan1) was found in the screening of a T. molitor midgut cDNA library. The sequence was extended, but still lacks about 300 amino acids in the aminoterminal region, where the catalytic residues are. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA coding for TmMan1 is absent from fat body, carcass and Malpighian tubules, and is present in the midgut. One peptide was designed from the partial sequence of TmMan1 and was used to generate antibodies in a rabbit. The antibody recognized a single protein band of approximately 60 kDa in electrophoretically resolved Man 1 and Man2 proteins from midgut tissue and contents homogenate. a-Man sequences were retrieved from Tribolium castaneum genome (species that is close to Tenebrio molitor) with annotated Drosophila melanogaster a-man sequences as query. Fourteen sequences were recovered and they branch in two monophyletic groupings in a cladogram. One group corresponds to GH family 47 and the other to GH family 38. This last branching is separated into two monophyletic clades which main feature is the putative cytological origin of the enzyme: lysosomal or Golgi. TmMan1 branches among the lysosomal-like enzymes of GH 38 family of T. castaneum. As Man 2 is recognized by anti-TmMa1 serum and has substrate specificity characteristic of enzymes GH 38 it may correspond to the lysosomal-like TmMan 1. As much as we know, this is the first characterized digestive a-mannosidase in insects. Formaldehyde (FA) is a very important commercial chemical, but at the same it is a very toxic pollutant. FA in indoor air has a negative effect on human health and should be removed by ventilation or by conversion to non-toxic products.

Genetic polymorphism and expression of antioxidative enzymes, and Nrf2 transcription factor were analyzed in 90 healthy men. The Regional Ethics Committee for Scientific Research approved the study protocol and a written consent was obtained from each participant of the study. Transcripts level of hGSTA1, hGSTP1, hNrf2, hSOD2 and hGAPDH in circulating blood leukocytes was determined by means of quantitative Real-Time PCR. Genotyping of GSTM1 (gene deletion), GSTP1 113A/G (rs1695), GSTT1 (gene deletion), Nrf2 -617C/A (rs6721961), SOD2 -9C/T (rs4880) and GSTA1 -69C/T (rs3957357) was conducted by Real-Time PCR assays. GSTP1, GSTA1, Nrf2 and SOD2 allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Transcripts level of hSOD2, hGSTA1, hGSTP1 among healthy males was modulated by SOD2, GSTA1, GSTP1 genotypes, respectively. Individuals with variant alleles of SOD2 -9C/T, GSTA1 -69C/T, GSTP1 113A/G possessed higher mRNAs level of adequate genes in blood leukocytes compared to individuals with wild-type genotype. Nrf2 -617C/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) did not influence hNrf2 expression. Nrf2 transcription factor modulated expression of hGSTA1, hGSTP1 and hSOD2 among control men. Carriers of at least one Nrf2 -617A allele presented higher expression of hSOD2, hGSTA1 and hGSTP1 when compared to men with Nrf2 -617C/C genotype. These data suggest occurrence of functional SNPs of GSTA1, GSTP1 and SOD2 modulating expression of hGSTA1, hGSTP1 and hSOD2 in circulating blood leukocytes. Genetically modified variations in hGSTA1, hGSTP1 and hSOD2 transcripts level may contribute to xenobiotics and free radicals metabolism efficiency in humans. This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science Comparative studies concerning Claviceps purpurea metabolism in conditions of shake-flask and bioreactor submerged cultivations have been performed in order to develop a new succesfull biotechnology on the production of fungal bioactive compounds with cytostatic effects. Because of the high oxygen demand during submerged cultivation, three different aeration rates have been tested (1 -1.5 -2.5 vvm). The mycelium extracts and the supernatants were analyzed and dry weight, protein, total alkaloids, DNA and RNA contents during the fermentation processes have been measured. A significant increase in total alkaloid content (280.47 mg/100 g dry weight) was obtained in bioreactor, at 1 vvm aeration rate, compared with shake-flask fermentation (246.16 mg/100 g dry weight), at eight days of submerged cultivation. The highest aeration rate (2.5 vvm) was not favourable to the culture development, but it had a stimulant effect on protein synthesis in mycelium and supernatant and on total alkaloid content in supernatant, so modifying the ratio between intra -and extracellular level of bioproduct. The cytostatic potential of extracts and concentrated supernatants has been tested on HeLa tumor cells, during a period of 72 hours, of which 48 hours in the presence of bioactive samples. The inhibitory impact of fungal bioproducts on protein synthesis, mitosis, cell viability and development of normal and tumoral cells was analyzed. The maximum inhibition of cell protein synthesis (87.62%) was induced by the hydrous mycelium extract of Claviceps purpureaICB-CP10 strain, obtained after ten days of fungus cultivation in bioreactor, at 1 vvm aeration rate. The highest total alkaloid content was not correlated with the maximum cytostatic potential of the bioactive product, fact suggesting that there is a complex of bioactive compounds, not only of alkaloidic type, with cytostatic potential.",

            "text": "Differential effects of polyamine mixtures on DNA aggregation C. Seppi and C. Balduini Dipartimento di Biochimica ''A.Castellani'', Universita\u00b4di Pavia, Pavia, ItaliaThe natural polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are found ubiquitously in mammalian cells and involved in many cellular processes. However, the most relevant characteristic of polyamines is their ability to bind nucleic acids, in particular DNA. It is well known that this binding induces DNA condensation and aggregation. Most studies concerning DNA aggregation have investigated the effect of one polyamine at a time. We have analyzed DNA aggregation induced by mixtures containing different amounts of the three polyamines. In a first set of experiments, the medium ionic strength was kept at very low values. In these conditions spermidine and spermine exert a synergistic effect: the concomitant presence of both polyamines induces the aggregation at concentrations at which the single polyamines are ineffective and this effect is not merely due to a positive charge increase. Putrescine inhibits the aggregation of DNA treated with spermidine and spermine or with spermidine alone, but has no effect on the spermine-induced aggregation. At physiological polyamine concentrations and in the presence of 150 mM NaCl only spermine induces DNA aggregation and the synergistic effect exerted by spermidine disappears. Moreover at physiological ionic strength putrescine inhibits also spermine-induced DNA aggregation. Our observations could be of interest from an evolutionistic point of view. In fact it is well documented that polyamines can stabilize DNA and protect it from external agents. Moreover, they can alter the DNA structure and modulate DNA processing enzymes. Therefore it was hypothesized that polyamines could participate in the organization of a primordial genome DNA genome. In a modern cell the condensation of DNA is mediated by proteins, but it is intriguing to imagine that in prebiotic conditions, modifications of the relative polyamines concentrations were sufficient to modulate DNA packaging.were infection with HCV virus and chronic alcohol consumption, with a mean MELD score of 7.8 \u00b1 2.5. We performed this study to evaluate the association between MS-associated features, IMA, and inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL). Results: Patients with liver cirrhosis exhibited significantly higher serum levels of IMA (0.361 \u00b1 0.078 ABSU) as well as higher levels of AOPPs, OxLDL, hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-a than non-cirrhotic patients (IMA = 0.182 \u00b1 0.063 ABSU; p < 0.001). The IMA level has been associated with metabolic disturbances, and this association is concordant with the correlation between IMA level and MS-associated features. Significant positive correlations between IMA level and the model MELD score and inflammatory biomarkers were also found in all patients with liver cirrhosis. Conclusion: IMA is a new serum biomarker useful in assessing the severity of the peripheral oxygenation insufficiency and the low-grade inflammatory state in patients with features of the MS-associated liver cirrhosis.",
