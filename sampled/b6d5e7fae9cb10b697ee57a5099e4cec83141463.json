Nakamura et al. fibrosis associated with abnormally increased extracellular volume (ECV). In the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), a stent is represented in its midportion, characterized as patent by CTA, without significant pressure drop by CT FFR (negative), but associated with a previous distal myocardial infarct, characterized by CT DE. Moreover, the stented lesion is also associated with a distal fixed perfusion defect due to reduced capillary density in the scar, which commonly extends to its peri-infarct border caused by lower capillary density (mixed normal and scarred myocardium) combined or not with microvascular dysfunction. CT ECV is greatly increased in the scar, as expected, and possibly increased in the peri-infarcted region as well because of tissue mixing or repeated ischemia and apoptosis. The heart cartoon also shows a first large LAD diagonal affected by diffuse atherosclerosis but with no significant morphological stenosis, as demonstrated by CTA. CT FFR can be abnormal if too many lesions in series lead to an overall pressure drop across the entire epicardial vessel length. CTP may be normal or abnormal because of microvascular disease and dysfunction. Finally, although CT DE is most often negative for myocardial scar, CT ECV can be increased because of chronic ischemia from microvascular disease with interstitial fibrogenesis. Importantly, the cartoon illustrates that multiple scenarios due to different combinations of macrovascular and microvascular disease can occur, and very frequently do, in the same heart in a patient with CAD, particularly in those with advanced ischemic heart disease. In this regard, although computed tomographic replacement fibrosis phenotyping through delayed enhancement is more than a decade old (14), the recently demonstrated ability to quantify interstitial myocardial fibrosis by CT (15) could provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction (16) .

Thus, the generalizability may be difficult to ascertain. Smaller numbers of women, nonwhite, and Hispanic participants. Only 23% (1,168 of 5,179) of the randomized cohort comprised women.

B Ischemia tests included electrocardiographic ischemia, radionuclide/cardiac magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion abnormalities, and ischemic wall motion abnormalities, which may have different implications for burden of ischemia and prognosis. Due to slow recruitment, study inclusion criteria were amended to include patients based on exercise stress test evidence of ischemia, the study primary endpoint was amended as pre-specified into the study, and follow-up was reduced in 2014. Inclusion of exercise stress alone cohort is problematic as the magnitude of electrocardiography changes do not correlate to the extent and severity of ischemia. It added heterogeneity to the patient cohort and may have diminished the study power for drawing conclusions for the imaging-based ischemia alone. Whether this exercise stress-only cohort underwent fewer revascularizations is not clear. The exercise stress-only cohort had a stricter cutoff of 70% stenosis in a coronary artery serving a large myocardial region before randomization (23) . It is not surprising then that the exercise stress-only cohort had greater frequency of severe ischemia (83% vs. 44.8% for imaging stress test) (23), greater frequency of 3-vessel CAD, LAD, and proximal LAD stenosis than participants undergoing stress imaging. On the other hand, they were also younger, less often white, with lower prevalence of hypertension and prior PCI or CABG, stroke, or MI (23) . Exercise stress-only cohort made up 25% of all patients enrolled. All eligible stress-only patients were assigned to the severe category, thus accounting for 50% of severe ischemia, a disproportionate portion of patients that may have diluted the severe ischemia cohort defined on imaging. It is well-recognized that high-risk ischemic features on nuclear imaging (transient ischemic dilation, heart to lung ratio, right ventricular tracer uptake, left ventricular ejection fraction, and myocardial blood flow values by positron emission tomography) portend greater risk.

Completeness of revascularization has not been reported yet, but chronic totally occluded coronary arteries were common and frequently not revascularized. At this time, we do not know if the revascularization was directed to the coronary stenoses that subtended ischemic territories. The study was underpowered to evaluate CABG vs. PCI separately.

The strongest predictors of the individual risk for the development of significant TR were PH, LA enlargement, older age, and AF. At the population level, based on PAF calculation, age and PH were the most important contributors to the burden of hemodynamically significant TR. Analyzing the data after the exclusion of patients with significant VHD yielded similar results. Finally, during follow-up, patients progressing to moderate/severe TR exhibited greater accumulation of left heart disease (LHD) characteristics, suggesting an accelerated LHD progression.

During a median follow-up period of 38 months, 292 patients (19%) developed moderate or severe FTR. They found that independent predictors of FTR progression were age, female sex, heart failure, pacemaker electrode, AF, in-dicators of left heart disease, including left atrial enlargement, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and the presence of left-sided valvular disease. They also showed that among the selected risk factors, PH and aging were the most important contributors to the burden of significantFTR. The study by Mutlak et al. (12) is clinically relevant, because it raises the clinicians' awareness about the need to aggressively treat conditions such as AF and PH to prevent the progression of FTR. Given the current challenges in FTR treatment, it has become essential to identify early markers of FTR worsening and focus our interventions on the most relevant modifiable factors. For instance, this study suggests that treating left-sided heart valve diseases or implementing strategies to mitigate TR after pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implantation is likely to have a limited impact on the prevalence of significant tricuspid regurgitation. However, given the strength of association and high prevalence of aging, PH, and AF in the general population, the burden of FTR seems to be significant and hardly modifiable. Interestingly, the only echocardiographic predictors of FTR progression were left atrial size and PASP, indirect signs of increased leftsided filling pressures. The study findings have also important implications for patient follow-up; accordingly, only patients with FTR with 1 or more of the 4 risk factors (age $60 years, PASP $36 mm Hg, AF, and moderate or greater left atrial dilation) would require close follow-up, while in the absence of any risk factor, the likelihood of FTR progression would be low. However, a few methodological aspects should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this study. This was a retrospective study based on review of echocardiographic reports issued at the time of clinically indicated examinations, and patients were included if a repeat examination was available within 1-to 10-year time frame from the index study (January 2006 to June 2007). The evaluation of both FTR severity and chamber size and function in these routine studies was based largely on subjective, visual assessment, and the categorization of abnormalities was performed according to the guidelines in use at the time of the first examination, although changes in methods and partition values from 2005 to 2015 guidelines may have led to significant reclassification of chamber abnormalities (such as of the left atrium", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF13": {"text": "problematic, because the extent of the regurgitant jet area on color Doppler does not reflect the regurgitant volume, but the jet momentum, and the momentum is dependent on the square of the velocity. Assuming a tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity of 3 m/s, a color Doppler jet area of 5 cm 2 could arise from a regurgitant orifice that is 4 times the size of an equivalent jet area of a mitral regurgitation jet with velocity of 6 m/s. It is thus possible that the severity of FTR in the first echocardiogram was underestimated, and/or the progression of FTR severity reported by Mutlak et al. (12) and its association with PASP (calculated from the tricuspid regurgitant jet) is simply a change in jet momentum and/or loading conditions between the 2 examinations. The only semiquantitative parameter used by Mutlak et al. (12) was the measurement of the vena contracta width obtained from the apical 4-chamber view. However, the shape of the FTR jet is not circular but starlike, crescentic, or elliptic, with the longest dimension usually along the anteroposterior direction. Accordingly, using a single linear dimension obtained from the apical 4-chamber view is likely to underestimate FTR severity. Moreover, small rotations of the apical 4-chamber view between subsequent studies (which is likely in studies acquired by different sonographers, at different times, during clinical routine examinations) can result in different vena contracta widths despite the lack of any actual change in FTR severity. Finally, the diagnosis of primary tricuspid regurgitation or interference of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads with tricuspid valve leaflets is quite challenging using conventional 2-dimensional echocardiography (15). Without the use of 3-dimensional echocardiography, the actual incidence of those conditions might have been largely underestimated.

However, the methods available for busy clinicians to integrate these parameters at the point of care to directly impact medical decision-making remain imprecise. Moreover, traditional machine learning pipeline is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and challenging. Consequently, it may be difficult for nonexperts in ML to accomplish this goal. In the present study, we explored the application of a cloudbased platform for automating machine learning workflows that are efficient and easily accessible to technically-inclined data scientists and busy clinicians with limited programming expertise. We first applied a patient similarity network, a novel unsupervised clustering technique that can compress the complex dataset derived from echocardiography for creating meaningful representations and identify patient groups with similar presentations and clinical outcomes. After this initial exploration, we then trained supervised machine learning techniques to automatically classify any unknown patients to the distinct patient clusters identified by the patient similarity network (Central Illustration). METHODS PATIENT ENROLLMENT. To develop a broad crosssectional representation of patients across different stages of cardiac disease, we prospectively recruited 323 consecutive subjects in whom echocardiography was performed using the ultrasound equipment with VFM software between July 2017 and December 2018.All scans were performed by a single sonographer who was an expert in VFM images. We excluded patients with severe mitral annular calcification, pacemakers including cardiac resynchronization therapy, left ventricular assist devices, poor echocardiography windows, or suboptimal cardiac imaging. This study population (N \u00bc 323) included healthy control volunteers (n \u00bc 50) without any history of previous cardiac diseases. These volunteers were recruited via advertisement and were excluded if there were any echocardiographic or electrocardiographic abnormality. The study protocol was compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. All echocardiographic examinations were performed following the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines and using commercially available ultrasound equipment (LISENDO 880, Hitachi Healthcare America, Twinsburg, Ohio) (17,18). The detailed steps of 2dimensional echocardiographic measurements are listed in the Supplemental Appendix. SPECKLE-TRACKING ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. Longitudinal strain and strain rates by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) were analyzed off-System, Munich, Germany). The reference point for image analysis was taken at the onset of the QRS complex, and the endocardial borders of both the left atrium (LA) and LV were traced manually using the end-diastolic frame (17). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) as well as the LV global systolic strain rate (SRs) and early diastolic strain rate (SRe) were calculated as the average values in standard apical views. Peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), which represented LV reservoir function, and peak atrial contraction strain, which represented LA pump function, were measured from the average of the strain curves of all segments at the end of ventricular systole. Strain rate analysis was used to measure the peak LA strain rate during ventricular systole (LA SRs) and early LV filling (LA SRe).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF16": {"text": "Cho, J.S. et al.

Although by definition, AF is a functional rhythm disorder, and conceptually an abnormal \"behavior\" of atrial tissue, whether there are structural determinants of AF is debated. For decades, it has been well known that certain structural heart diseases increase the likelihood of AF, the prime example being rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis. Aside from valvular disease, the structural determinants of AF are less clear. Myocardial fibrosis is a common feature of clinical and experimental models of AF (2).

METHODS The multicenter CAPIRE (Coronary Atherosclerosis in outlier subjects: Protective and novel Individual Risk factors Evaluation) study is part of the GISSI Outlier Project. A prospective cohort of subjects who underwent coronary CTA for suspected CAD was enrolled. Based on risk factor (RF) burden, patients were defined as having a low clinical risk (0 to 1 RF with the exclusion of patients with diabetes mellitus as single RF) or at high clinical risk (3 or more RFs).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF58": {"text": "The CAPIRE study confirmed the prognostic value of atherosclerosis assessment by coronary CTA, demonstrating high noncalcified plaque volume as the most ACS-predictive parameter in patients with extensive CAD.

D espite the improvement in diagnosis, 43.9% of the U.S. adult population is projected to have some form of cardiovascular disease by 2030 (1). Clinical guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention (2) support the assessment of global cardiovascular risk using multiparametric clinical scores. However, cardiovascular events often occur in patients who are not receiving preventive therapies because they are asymptomatic and they had been misclassified by conventional risk factors as \"low-risk patients\" (3). On the contrary, several patients with traditional risk factors do not develop coronary heart disease, illustrating that when risk factors are widely present in a population, they may not predict disease accurately in individuals (4). A metaanalysis including 122,458 patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS) confirmed that the cardiovascular risk proportionally increased with risk factor (RF) number, but approximately 15% men and 20% women did not have any conventional RFs (5). Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) allows the detailed exploration of the coronary wall anatomy. Recently, a large literature, including different subanalyses of the international CONFIRM (COronary CT Angiography EvaluatioN For Clinical Outcomes: An InteRnational Multicenter Registry) study, demonstrated coronary CTA as a robust prognostic tool for the stratification of patients with suspected but unknown coronary artery disease (CAD) (6,7). Moreover, to better evaluate the extent of atherosclerotic burden, the segment involvement score (SIS), the segment stenosis score (SSS), and the computed tomography (CT)-adapted Leaman score have been applied to coronary CTA findings, demonstrating that they are independent long-term predictors of hard cardiac events (8). Recently, some prospective studies aimed at a comprehensive assessment of coronary atherosclerosis demonstrated that coronary CTA is able to identify subjects at higher risk for ACS according to the presence of specific atherosclerotic plaque features (9,10). The complex relationship among traditional risk factors, CAD, and its clinical manifestation is the object of the CAPIRE (Coronary Atherosclerosis in outlier subjects: Protective and novel Individual Risk factors Evaluation) study (11). Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the advanced coronary atherosclerosis analysis by coronary CTA may improve prognostic stratification independently from traditional risk factors and lumen stenosis degree. METHODS THE CAPIRE STUDY. The CAPIRE study (NCT02157662) is part of the GISSI Outlier Project jointly promoted by the Heart Care Foundation Onlus, Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists, and Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research. The CAPIRE study was designed as a prospective, observational, international multicenter study involving a crosssectional comparison of clinical, imaging, and biomolecular variables of a selected populations and a longitudinal phase during which subjects would be followed up for a 10-year period (11); the present analysis refers to a 5-year follow-up period. STUDY POPULATION. From January 2011 to June 2013, a consecutive cohort of subjects, both men and women, 45 to 75 years of age, who underwent $64slice coronary CTA because of suspected but unknown CAD in the outpatient clinics of the 11 centers involved in the study, were screened.

All circulating biomarkers were measured in a central laboratory, in a single batch, by personnel unaware of patients' characteristics, as previously reported(11).CORONARY CTA ANALYSIS. Coronary CTA datasets were analyzed using a vessel analysis software with a dedicated tool for plaque volume semiautomatic quantification (PlaqID of CardIQ Xpress 2.0 Package, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). This software enables the quantification of coronary plaque volume with 3-dimensional image reconstruction including volume rendering and curved multiplanar reformation, as previously demonstrated(15,16). Manual editing of plaque and lumen contours was possible according to readers' experience to improve plaque volume quantification accuracy. Images were independently evaluated by 2 readers with 10 years of experience in cardiovascular CT.Coronary plaques were defined as structures of at least 1-mm 2 area within or adjacent to the artery lumen, clearly distinguishable from the vessel lumen, and surrounded by pericardial tissue; tissue with signal intensity below -40 HU was considered pericardial fat and excluded from analysis. Normal coronary arteries were defined when no atherosclerotic plaque (including focal and eccentric calcified plaques) could be detected in any segment within the coronary artery wall or lumen(17).For each coronary artery plaque detected, lumen stenosis was quantified and graded as normal, nonobstructive (<50%), moderate (50% to 70%), or severe (>70%).Moreover, high-risk plaque features were evaluated as follows (Figure 1): arterial remodeling index assessed using vessel area, defined as the ratio between vessel area, including lumen, at the site of maximum lumen stenosis and normal vessel proximal reference area (arterial remodeling index \u00bc lesion plaque area / reference area); plaque burden, defined as the ratio between cross sectional plaque area at the site of maximum stenosis and cross-sectional vessel area, at the same site (plaque burden \u00bc [crosssectional vessel area \u00c0 cross-sectional lumen area] / cross-sectional vessel area); or napkin ring sign, defined as the presence of a semicircular thin enhancement around the plaque along the outer contour of the vessel and small spotty calcifications as any discrete calcification #3 mm in length and occupying #90 arc when viewed in short axis (18). Plaque length was recorded as well. Plaque consistency was assessed using HU and low-attenuation plaque was defined as the presence of any voxel <30 HU (18). Total plaque volume, defined as the entire volume of coronary plaque on a per-patient basis including both calcified and noncalcified plaque, was evaluated and reported in mm 3 . Low-attenuation plaque volume and fibro-fatty plaque volume have been expressed as the amount of plaque with attenuation density below 30 HU and between 30 HU and 150 HU, respectively, reported in mm 3 (15). Noncalcified plaque volume was considered as plaque volume with attenuation density below 150 HU. All plaque volumes have also been evaluated as qualitative dichotomic variables using the highest quartile (HQ) as cutoff on a per-patient basis. Plaque analysis were performed for all coronary vessels, including each evaluable segment. Finally, atherosclerosis burden was assessed on a per-patient basis using previous validated CT scores: SIS, SSS, and CT-adapted Leaman score, as previously reported (8); HQ was used as cutoff. The presence of multivessel disease (MVD) was defined as the presence of more than 1 vessel with stenosis >70% or left main stenosis >50%; this definition was suggested by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for myocardial revascularization as a marker of high-risk CAD (19). FOLLOW-UP. Follow-up was performed by dedicated researchers from each of the 11 centers involved in the study. Every 12 months, a clinical visit was scheduled while a structured phone interview was planned every 6 months. All clinical events were recorded and validated centrally by an event committee blinded to the coronary CTA results. Hospital records and outsourced clinical documents were screened to confirm the information obtained. For the purpose of this study, the occurrence of cardiac death, ACS, and nonurgent revascularization were recorded. Cardiac death was defined as death caused by acute myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, or refractory heart failure. ACS was defined as both STsegment elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In all cases ACS was recorded as an event only when culprit was identified and urgent myocardial revascularization was performed; if invasive coronary angiography together with advanced invasive plaque imaging showed normal coronary arteries without culprit lesion detection, ACS was not recorded as an event. Late nonurgent revascularization was defined as nonurgent revascularization occurred more than 6 months after coronary CTA. Patients with early nonurgent revascularization were censored at followup. Outcome measures were obtained using 3 different combined endpoints: 1) ACS; 2) cardiac death \u00fe ACS; and 3) major adverse cardiovascular event(s) (MACE) (cardiac death \u00fe ACS \u00fe late nonurgent revascularization).

When the variable distribution was not normal, Mann-Whitney U tests for independent samples were used. The proportion of the categorical variables was compared using a chi-square analysis or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Estimated hazard ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented for each class of the variables that became significant at the univariate analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical and coronary CTA variables and outcomes at univariate analysis. The presence of high-risk clinical profile (FRS >20%), the presence of MVD and advanced coronary CTA plaque analysis, if significantly associated to the events at univariate analysis, were evaluated at multivariable analysis. To avoid overfitting, plaque characteristics were included in separate models. Akaike information criterion was calculated for every multivariate model. For each model, the incremental value in predicting the composite endpoint by stepwise inclusion of significant variables was assessed by the chi-square value using Omnibus test of model coefficients. Reclassification of patients was determined using net reclassification improvement analysis for the combined endpoint. For each endpoint, the net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement were used to determine reclassification of patients obtained by MVD and plaque volume to the model based on clinical data.

Will Plaque Quantification on Coronary CTA End Our Infatuation With Lumen Stenosis?* Todd C. Villines, MD, Austin A. Robinson, MD W hat did the angiogram show? This question is asked thousands of times daily around the world after invasive or noninvasive coronary angiography and is invariably answered as units that are universally understood: percent diameter stenosis. Since the days of Dr. Mason Sones and Dr. Charles Dotter, pioneers in invasive coronary angiography approximately 6 decades ago, percent diameter stenosis of the coronary lumen has served as the universally accepted measure to define the severity and guide the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Indeed, stenosis and the location of coronary lesions on invasive coronary angiography or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) are among the strongest predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in individuals and populations. Elegantly simple and concise, percent stenosis is frequently remembered by patients, demanded by surgeons, and beloved by cardiologists, despite knowledge that stenosis only modestly predicts functional significance defined by invasive fractional flow reserve. Unlike traditional coronary angiography (lumenography), 3-dimensional coronary CTA can detect, characterize, and quantify coronary atherosclerosis across nearly the entirety of the epicardial coronary arterial tree (1). Research over the past decade has consistently shown that adverse plaque features, such as positive remodeling, spotty calcification, low attenuation, and the napkin ring sign (central lower attenuation with peripheral plaque enhancement), identify plaques more likely to represent thin-cap fibroatheromas that result in acute coronary syndromes (2). Moreover, the presence of these plaque vulnerability features improves risk prediction beyond stenosis alone (3,4). More recently, advanced plaque quantification software and machine learning techniques have been used to more fully assess and quantify plaque on coronary CTA, providing measures of total plaque volume as well as the volume of plaque subtypes, such as noncalcified, calcified, partially calcified, fibrous, fibrofatty, and low attenuation (5,6). Demonstrating the potential of plaque quantification, in a post hoc analysis of the prospective randomized controlled SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial, lowattenuation (<30 HU) plaque volume on coronary CTA measured using semiautomated research software (AutoPlaq, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California) was the strongest predictor of future myocardial infarction, irrespective of coronary artery calcium score, clinical risk factors, or stenosis severity (7). Despite advances in plaque quantification technology, coronary CTA currently is interpreted and reported clinically in much the same way as conventional invasive coronary angiography. For example, the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography's Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) classifies disease severity (0 to 5) according to the worst percent lumen stenosis. Highrisk (vulnerable) plaque features are described as present when $2 features are visualized within a plaque, but they are reported in a binary fashion (present or absent in the entire scan) and not quantified or further characterized with regard to the number of high-risk plaques or their location (8). The number of segments with plaque, the segment involvement score (SIS), and other semiquantitative scores of CAD extent and severity shown to add prognostic value beyond stenosis also are not a part of CAD-RADS and are not typically reported. A few of the limitations to the clinical use of volumetric coronary plaque quantification include a lack of stan-", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF71": {"text": ", scan acquisition of dynamic CTP was initiated by injecting 40 ml of contrast medium with an iodine concentration of 370 mg/ml at a flow rate of 5 ml/s.

After dynamic stress CTP, standard prospective CTA was performed at rest with the following scan parameters: 2 \u00c2 100-kV tube voltage or 80-kV and 0.28-s gantry rotation time, with injection of 0.84 ml/kg of contrast medium with an iodine concentration of 370 mg/ml over 12 s. Tube current was determined with the angular modulation technique. CTDE images were acquired 7 min after CTA without additional contrast administration and were reconstructed by using targeted special frequency filtration and half-scan reconstruction (3).

Continuous variables are presented as the mean AE SD and were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables are expressed as frequency (proportion) and were compared by using the Fisher exact test.

Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of MACEs. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed by using stepwise forward selection for variables with p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis to determine independent predictors of MACEs. The incremental value of a predictor over another predictor was evaluated by calculating the global chisquare test and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis.

Lima, MD, MBA, a Joanne D. Schuijf, PHD b C oronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has emerged as one of the most preferred, if not the primary, noninvasive method for assessing stable ischemic heart disease (1). In addition to its well-established power to define obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), CTA can be augmented by computer-based calculation of intracoronary pressure drop (computed tomographyderived fractional flow reserve) to guide lesion revascularization in patients selected to undergo interventional procedures (2,3). Also, CTA can be combined with perfusion assessment (computed tomographic perfusion [CTP]) during the administration of a vasodilator (4) for sizing ischemic burden and orienting myocardial revascularization (Figure 1). Within the CTP field specifically, the emergence of dynamic CTP (5-8) has dramatically enhanced diagnostic capabilities through the possibility to quantify myocardial perfusion noninvasively, improving also the reproducibility and ease of performance of CTP relative to the original static CTP protocols. However, currently, there is a paucity of studies examining whether blood flow quantification by dynamic CTP translates into a greater ability to forecast future adverse outcomes in patients with CAD. In this issue of iJACC, Nakamura et al. (9) significantly extend the armamentarium for prognostic assessment of patients with symptomatic but stable CAD by demonstrating the power of semiquantitative dynamic CTP enhanced by scar determination to predict long-term disease outcomes noninvasively. The study investigators enrolled 540 patients who were followed for 4 years after undergoing comprehensive computed tomographic examinations that included coronary CTA, dynamic CTP, and delayed enhanced imaging. The study population consisted of symptomatic patients with angina pectoris, and importantly, patients with suspected as well as known CAD were enrolled, including those with stents and heavy calcifications. Major adverse cardiac event(s) (MACE) occurred in 43 patients; hard events included 3 patients who died of cardiac causes and 7 patients who had nonfatal myocardial infarctions. All MACE also included patients who were hospitalized for angina pectoris (n \u00bc 23) and heart failure (n \u00bc 10). The most important findings of this study, depicted in Figure 8 and the Central Illustration (9), were the annualized MACE rates calculated for all patients (13.5%), those with suspected CAD (15.6%), and those with known CAD (12.9%), taking the main computed tomography (CT)-derived features in combination (i.e., presence of obstructive CAD on CTA, ischemic perfusion defect on dynamic CTP, and myocardial scar on delayed enhanced CT). Moreover, the presence of ischemia on dynamic CT significantly reduced MACE-free survival in subgroup analyses of patients with stents, heavily calcified coronary arteries (coronary artery calcification >400 HU), borderline (50% to 69%) and severe ($70%) stenosis, single-and ISSN 1936-878X/$36.00 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.03.007 *Editorials published in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging reflect the views of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of iJACC or the American College of Cardiology.

Importantly, although the increment in area under the curve was greatest for patients with known CAD (from 0.58 to 0.74; p \u00bc 0.001), it was still significant for patients with suspected CAD (from 0.78 to 0.88; p \u00bc 0.033), further underlying the prognostic predictive power of ischemia over and above anatomic stenosis for patients with and those without histories of CAD. The findings by Nakamura et al. (9) demonstrate that the addition of measures of replacement fibrosis (myocardial scar) by delayed enhanced CT adds substantial prognostic power when combined with perfusion quantified by dynamic CTP, a concept previously shown in studies that combined myocardial perfusion with scar assessment by delayed enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (10).

Moreover, patients who develop CDRIE have increased device-dependent, long-term mortality even after successful treatment of the infection (6). Despite the use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, the number of CDRIE cases is still on the increase at a rate disproportionate to the rising rate of device implantations (7,8). Hence, the development of tools designed to select for high-risk patients may be crucial in improving outcomes for patients with CDRIE. Currently, there are no data for the potential role of the hybrid technique of single-photon emission tomography and computed tomography using autologous leukocytes labeled with technetium-99 m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime ( 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT) to identify patients at a higher risk of death and complications in the course of IE, including CDRIE. Therefore, this prospective, singlecenter study sought to assess the prognostic value of 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT in patients with suspected CDRIE. METHODS STUDY POPULATION. This study was conducted prospectively between 2015 and 2019 in a tertiary cardiac center. Overall, 103 consecutive patients who had been hospitalized and were suspected to be cases of CDRIE were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were stated as the presence of one of the following in a patient with a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED): a local device infection (LDI), echocardiography positive for CDRIE, and a fever of unknown origin or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, lactation, renal replacement therapy, neutropenia, and coexisting neoplastic disease. In addition to the standard clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and imaging work-up for CDRIE according to current guidelines, all patients underwent 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT (3). SCINTIGRAPHY. The radiolabeling procedure and image acquisition were carried out according to current guidelines (dose: 370 to 740 MBq) (9-12). The 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT protocol, which was applied and which included performing delayed and late whole-body scans after 4 to 6 h and 20 to 24 h, has been described in detail in the authors' previous work (13-16). The planar and hybrid SPECT/CT images were assessed for the presence of inflammatory foci of increased radiotracer uptake by 2 experienced nuclear medicine specialists blinded to clinical data (Central Illustration). The 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT examination was classified as positive for CDRIE in cases where there was at least 1 focus of increased radioactivity in the vicinity of the intracardiac and/or intravascular portion of the CIED electrode and which was characterized by a time-dependent IE pattern, with further accumulation of labeled leukocytes seen in the late images due to increased uptake in infected areas and reduction in background activity (17). In the case of any isolated accumulation of radiolabeled leukocytes within the CIED pocket, the examination result was classified as LDI. STUDY PROTOCOL AND DEFINITION OF OUTCOMES. After undergoing an initial evaluation, patients were prospectively observed for a mean time of 17.48 AE 11.90 months. After a period of at least 6 months, all surviving patients attended an outpatient clinic for clinical reassessment with follow-up transthoracic echocardiography (18). The endpoints were all-cause mortality, in-hospital mortality, complete hardware removal, and composite endpoint including at least 1 of the following complications: an embolic event, new onset heart failure, uncontrolled infection, renal replacement therapy, reoperation, and new heart rhythm and conduction disturbances. Endpoints were analyzed in patients who were subdivided into 2 groups according to their 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT results. In-hospital mortality has been defined as any death, regardless of cause, occurring at the hospital during the same hospitalization subsequent to 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT. Complete hardware removal included joint device and lead extraction due to CDRIE by the transvenous lead extraction (TLE) technique or with an open surgical procedure. Based on the available medical literature, including the published guidelines, as well as the present authors' long experience in the field of IE, several endpoints of interest were identified prior to the commencement of the study, and therefore the composite endpoint included (3): HMPAO-SPECT/CT Negative for CDRIE Holcman, K. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol Img. 2020;13(8):1739-51. Positive results yielded by the hybrid SPECT/CT technique with the application of 99 mTc-HMPAO-labeled autologous leukocytes in patients with suspected CDRIE are associated with higher in-hospital mortality, an increased rate of complications and more frequent hardware removal.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. The normality of the distribution of variables was evaluated using a Shapiro-Wilk test. For comparison of mean values and discrete data, Student's t-tests and chi-square tests were used, respectively. Cox proportional hazards analyses were applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the endpoints, as well as their individual component events. For the \"in-hospital mortality\" and \"new heart rhythm and conduction disturbances\" variables, due to the limited number of events, odds ratios and 95% CI were calculated instead of HR with MEDCALC software. Survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared with the log-rank test. Medians and quartiles were estimated using the parametric Weibull model. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the associations of selected variables with endpoints of interest (unadjusted analyses, and analyses adjusted for age, LVEF, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)). Moreover, multivariate Cox stepwise regression was applied. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica version 13.0 software (Hamburg, Delaware). The p values <0.05 were statistically significant. COMPLIANCE WITH ETHICAL STANDARDS. This study was carried out with a grant from the Jagiellonian University Medical College (K/DSC/004383).

The disease profoundly impacts a patient's prognosis because it gradually affects older patients with a higher number of comorbidities (4). The socioeconomic effect of CDRIE is partly a result of the increasing number of implanted devices, which in turn has caused rising rates of infectious complications (19). As a result, infectious indications are currently the leading cause of TLE (3,20).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF106": {"text": "Results of the Analysis of Complete Hardware Removal Rates Using the Kaplan-Meier Method and Compared With", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF108": {"text": "for IE diagnosis and management, both 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT and fluorine-18labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) have been included for the first time in the diagnostic pathway in patients with prosthetic valve IE (3). However, data supporting the role of these techniques are less robust for patients with implanted CIEDs; therefore, the guidelines were not included in the CDRIE diagnostic criteria (3). On the other hand, data from specialized centers for the potential value of 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT in patients with various forms of IE are promising because they show high sensitivity and specificity (12,17,26). Moreover, 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT helps to differentiate between IE infectious lesions and sterile echocardiographic lesions and reduce the number of false positive echocardiographic results (14). Accordingly, in patients with CIED-related infections, this technique has a favorable diagnostic profile (27-29). However, none of the studies previously conducted were designed to account for the potential role of 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT in the risk stratification of patients with IE. Moreover, thus far, there have been no data for how 99m Tc-HMPAO-SPECT/CT-positive results may impact patient management and outcomes.

Patients with tracer uptake levels typical for CDRIE more often underwent complete hardware removal. Despite the implementation of early treatment strategies, increased in-hospital mortality and complication rates remained elevated within the first 3 months after initial diagnosis. Overall, based on the present findings, this technique seems to have an adjunctive value for the risk stratification of patients with CDRIE. Paola A. Erba, MD, PHD, a,b Riemer H.J.A. Slart, MD, PHD b,c D uring the last years, cardiovascular medicine has faced a paradigm shift by embracing the concept of multimodal imaging and multidisciplinary team-working. Extensive imaging applications aim primarily to establish a prompt diagnosis. Further, this shift presents significant implications for treatment regarding decisionmaking and prognosis prediction. By this approach, the focus of attention moves away from a single organ dysfunction assessed by a single imaging modality and managed by a single specialist, to a more comprehensive approach build upon 2 pillars of the systemic involvement of a disease and patients' teammanagement. For patients with infective endocarditis (IE) and cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infections, patient risk assessment is crucial. Results from the EuroEndo registry have shown that vegetation length, the presence of cerebral complications and/or abscess, and failure to undertake surgery were all independent predictors of mortality (1). Therefore, multimodality image-based predictors (imaging biomarkers) took the steps to be fully integrated into the traditional diagnostic criteria, filling in the diagnostic gap for patients with IE and CIED infections (2). In this specific setting, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-Dglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography ([ 18 F]FDG PET/CT) has emerged as a powerful tool for disease characterization (3). The technique has been mostly used in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, increasing the sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria from 70% to 97% (4).However, more and more commonly it is used in patients with native valve endocarditis for proper assessment of the embolic burden as well as in patients with CIED infections (5", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF111": {"text": "]FDG PET/CT requires proper imaging evaluation by experienced operators. The application of specific interpretation criteria will reduce potential pitfalls(2). Combination of PET/CT and CT angiography findings represents an accurate strategy to overcome these limitations (10) as well as the clinical integration of imaging results within the endocarditis team(5). An alternative to increasing imaging specificity is the use of another imaging method, radiolabeled white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy. WBC imaging has resulted in improved identification of endocardial involvement and extracardiac complications of IE(11,12)  and in the detection of infectious device involvement with additional diagnostic value, particularly in the subset of possible CIED infections(13)(14)(15). Because of the capability to explore the whole device, WBC imaging has the ability to help differ-entiate superficial surgical site infection from true generator pocket infection, as well as superficial from deep pocket infection. This is particularly relevant when patients present with either systemic infection or blood-positive culture in the absence of the typical signs of involvement at the generator pocket. However, a longer scan-time, a more complex procedure for the radiopharmaceutical preparation, lower spatial resolution of single-photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT system as compared with PET/CT, and limited availability among clinical centers worldwide are generally considered limitations to the appropriate implementation of this imaging modality (", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF112": {"text": "the value of imaging for better disease understanding, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies.

Technetium-99m -WBC SPECT/CT findings guide treatment, and more often result in complete hardware removal. These results further expand the evidence to support active use of multimodality imaging in the diagnostic algorithm of patients with suspected CIED infection to optimize their management and potentially reduce management costs, as recently suggested by the European Heart Rhythm Association international consensus document on how to prevent, diagnose, and treat CIED infections (17).

The current study evaluated if noninvasive imaging with LGE-CMR and PET could improve ICD patient selection. Our study showed that impaired LV function and the amount of scar border zone were related to the occurrence of VA. However, considerable heterogeneity of imaging data was observed within groups of patients with and without VA in follow-up. This suggests that improved prediction of VA by more detailed evaluation of the arrhythmic substrate using advanced imaging will be challenging for the individual patient. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Additional studies are required to improve patient selection for ICD implantation. Studies in larger patient populations evaluating a multifactorial risk calculator for SCD, including noninvasive imaging techniques such as LV function and presence of LGE, would be recommended.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines provide a Class I recommendation for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of SCD in patients with reduced LVEF based on large randomized controlled trials (RCTs)(2). However, only 21% of such patients received appropriate ICD shocks over 5 years in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (3). There are 2 likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: 1) presence of risk-gradient with a subgroup of patients at low risk of SCD despite reduced LVEF; and 2) subgroup of patients whose competing risk of mortality from non-arrhythmic causes especially pump failure is much higher than the risk of arrhythmic death (4).Thus, a large number of these patients would not derive benefit from ICD implantation while subjected to a significant risk of device related complications.Inappropriate ICD shocks account for one-third of all ICD shocks and are associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality(5). Therefore, risk stratification beyond LVEF is needed to identify individuals who may benefit from primary prevention ICD. This would also improve cost-effectiveness of primary prevention ICD.SUBSTRATE IMAGING FOR RISK STRATIFICATION OF SCD SCD risk stratification is based on elucidating substrate for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and identification of arrhythmia triggers. Risk markers include surface electrocardiographic markers of autonomic modulation, abnormal impulse conduction or abnormal repolarization, invasive electrophysiological testing, genetic biomarkers, and molecular bio-. However, clinical utility of these markers is limited by their poor sensitivity and specificity for prediction of arrhythmic mortality (7). Advanced imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), single-photon emission computed tomography, or positron-emission tomography (PET) provides direct visualization and quantification of arrhythmic substrate in the form of myocardial scar, ischemia, and denervation. Despite numerous studies spanning over the past 2 decades evaluating the role of substrate imaging for enriching SCD risk stratification, the association of chronic myocardial ischemia with VAs and arrhythmic SCD remains inconclusive. Several small studies found association of hyperemic myocardial blood flow, impaired coronary flow reserve, or periinfarct ischemia with inducible VAs or clinical arrhythmic events in patients with LVEF #35% (8-10). However, these studies were limited by small sample sizes with no or limited risk-adjustment, wide confidence intervals, and non-uniform characterization of ischemia.

LVEF #35% and rest/stress cardiac PET scan, none of the markers of comprehensively assessed myocardial ischemia including global or peri-infarct ischemia, coronary flow reserve, or resting and hyperemic myocardial blood flows were associated with clinical events of SCD or appropriate ICD shocks over a median follow-up of 3.2 years in either univariable or multivariable analyses (11). These findings were robust in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy after accounting for post-PET revascularization. Furthermore, myocardial ischemia has been shown to be an infrequent cause of VAs in patients with prior myocardial infarction (12). Thus, the potential for ischemia imaging to improve riskstratification of SCD in stable patients with reduced LVEF is limited at best. Unlike chronic ischemia, the studies linking myocardial scar with VAs and SCD have yielded relatively more consistent results (11,13-15). Myocardial scar is characterized on CMR as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and on cardiac PET scans as severe fixed perfusion defect with >50% reduction in counts during perfusion imaging or lack of metabolic activity on F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose imaging. LGE is associated with inducible VAs, ICD shocks, and SCD (13). In a large prospective study of 217 patients referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy with pre-procedure CMR, none of the patients without LGE experienced ICD therapy or SCD over a median follow-up of 3 years (14). However, LGE was present in 91% of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy limiting its utility as a binary marker of risk stratification in this population. Among patients with LGE, scar mass and border zone (areas of mixed scar and viable tissue) mass was associated with higher hazard of VA events (14).Sympathetic innervation can be imaged using 123 Imeta-iodobenzylguanidine or11  C-meta-hydroxyephedrine scans(16,17). In Prediction of ArrhythmicEvents With PET (PAREPET) study of 204 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy eligible for primary prevention ICD, total denervated myocardium as well as denervated but viable myocardium (perfusioninnervation mismatch) was shown to be associated with ICD shocks or arrhythmic SCD at a median follow-up of 4.1 years (17). The majority of these previous studies of substrate imaging were limited by a retrospective design with inherent limitation of assessing VA events, especially adjudication of SCD or appropriateness of ICD shocks. Of the prospective studies, none provided comprehensive evaluation of ischemia, scar, and denervation using both PET and CMR. Overcoming these limitations, in this issue of iJACC, Rijnierse et al. (18) prospectively investigated the utility of CMR-derived left ventricular structure, function, and scar burden, 15 O-H 2 O PETderived perfusion, and 11 C-meta-hydroxyephedrine-PET derived innervation for prediction of VAs in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF144": {"text": "Daubert JP, Zareba W, Cannom DS, et al.

Ultrafast ultrasound imaging is able to capture images at frame rates up to 100 times faster compared with conventional imaging. Specific applications of this technology have been developed and tested for clinical use in pediatric and adult cardiac imaging. These include ultrafast Doppler or vector flow imaging, shear wave imaging, electromechanical wave imaging, and backscatter tensor imaging. The principles of these applications are explained in this manuscript with illustrations on how these methods could be applied in clinical practice. Ultrafast ultrasound has great clinical potential in the assessment of cardiac function, in noninvasive hemodynamic analysis, while providing novel techniques for imaging coronary perfusion and evaluating rhythm disorders. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2020;13:1771-91) \u00a9 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.E chocardiography plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of patients in cardiology. During the past 2 decades, new technologies based on conventional ultrasound have been introduced in clinical practice and have improved diagnostic capabilities (1). Tissue Doppler imaging (2), strain imaging (3), and 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography (4) have found a role in clinical cardiology in most centers. Although most of these techniques have been widely accepted in adult cardiology, application of these techniques in children is limited by specific technical challenges (5). The heart rates in newborns is 3 times higher than in the adults, requiring higher temporal resolution, whereas the anatomical structures are much smaller, requiring higher spatial resolution. Moreover, in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) the morphology and loading conditions can be highly variable. This result in the need for specific ultrasound tools for pediatric and congenital heart disease. In addition, the noninvasive assessment of cardiac function remains a major challenge in cardiology, especially in adults. Systolic and diastolic function require a specific evaluation and new parameters independent of loading conditions. Most of the current tools in echocardiography rely on focused ultrasound beams, which intrinsically limits frame rate and temporal resolution.

Applications of ultrafast imaging include novel methods to assess myocardial viscoelastic properties (such as myocardial stiffness [MS]) (8,9), imaging of coronary flow (10), intracavitary blood flow (11-13), as well as tools to study electromechanical coupling (14,15) and methods to study the dynamic characteristics of myocardial fiber orientation (16-18). Ultrafast ultrasound has also been proposed for noninvasive central venous pressure assessment (19-21) and brain perfusion (22). The introduction of ultrafast ultrasound created a revolution in noninvasive diagnostic capabilities but, at the moment, is only at the clinical proof-of-concept stage. Further clinical developments could potentially reduce the need for cardiac magnetic resonance (MRI) or imaging techniques requiring radiation (23). Therefore, the objective of this review is to provide an overview of ultrafast ultrasound imaging in cardiology. ULTRAFAST ULTRASOUND IMAGING BASIC CONCEPTS. Although the use of ultrasonic plane-wave transmission rather than line-per-line focused beam transmission has been long researched, clinical application of this technology was only recently made possible through increasing computing capabilities and the introduction of powerful graphical processing unit-based platforms, making ultrasound systems capable of acquiring per channel data in real time (6). Ultrafast imaging is based on the use of plane or divergent waves, instead of focused beams (Figure 1). Plane and divergent waves are generated by applying a plane or circular delay on the elements of the transducer. In both cases, it is possible to reconstruct an entire image with a single emission. This imaging approach results in a lower spatial resolution and a lower contrast of the images. A technique that can be used to overcome this limitation is to use multiples plane waves transmitted at slightly different angles to obtain 1 image. Indeed, coherent combination of compounded plane-wave transmissions (also called coherent plane wave compounding) allows the recovery of high spatial resolution without", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF145": {"text": "allows separation of blood flow from tissue motion resulting in the evaluation of coronary anatomy, intramural perfusion, and coronary flow reserve. It has recently been shown that the spatiotemporal information using transthoracic ultrafast ultrasound allows the detection of coronary flow in epicardial and intramyocardial arteries in both children and adults (10) (Video 2). Furthermore, power Doppler imaging may be used to quantify blood volume. It relies on the measurement of pulse-to-pulse decorrelation of returning echocardiographic signals from the same location to detect moving objects. Ultrafast vector flow imaging. Doppler imaging as implemented in clinical scanners is often limited to the measurement of blood flow velocities in the axial direction (i.e., detecting blood moving toward or the probe). Detecting more complex flow velocities in different directions is made possible by vector flow imaging (VFI). Initially, this was based on speckle tracking of injected microbubbles using contrast echocardiography (echographic particle image velocimetry) (29). This method was developed using conventional imaging techniques at lower frame rates, thereby having an intrinsic frame rate limitation. For application in children, the use of contrast agents is limiting the clinical applicability. VFI can also be achieved without contrast agents by tracking blood speckles. This approach is generally referred to as blood speckle flow imaging (30) and requires temporal high-pass filtering to remove the high-amplitude signals from surrounding tissues. The advantage of vector flow imaging is its low angle dependence, which differentiates it from spectral Doppler techniques. It allows visualizing and estimating the direction and velocities of blood flow in different directions from any angle. Although 2dimensional (2D) velocity estimations are limited by through-plane motion, ideally 3D or 4-dimensional (4D) techniques could overcome this problem. The main technical limitation is the huge amount of information gathered by 4D flow acquisitions making implementation on standard scanners impossible (31). Velocity information in different directions allows for analysis of the exact vector velocity (32). This gives access to more complex flow patterns, including visualization of intracardiac or intravascular vortices (33). Vortex imaging has been demonstrated to provide important novel hemodynamic information contributing to novel insights in cardiovascular pathophysiology and disease detection (34). TISSUE MOTION: IMAGING OF NATURAL WAVES AND SHEAR WAVE ELASTOGRAPHY. Higher frame rates make it possible to visualize short-lived myocardial tissue motion that cannot be detected by conventional ultrasound techniques. This allows the detection of myocardial mechanical waves that occur naturally (for instance, at the time of valve closure or following electrical depolarization) or are generated by transmitting an external mechanical wave by acoustic radiation force. Electromechanical wave imaging. Electromechanical coupling is a very short-lived cardiac event and is the time between electrical and mechanical activation (35). This delay is very short, on the order of 10s of milliseconds (36); propagation of the", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF146": {"text": "Conventional Left) Conventional imaging with focused emission. (Right) Ultrafast imaging with plane wave emission. electromechanical activity throughout the myocardium occurs at a similar delay. At the tissue level, the depolarization of myocardial regions triggers electromechanical activation (i.e., the first time at which the muscle transitions from a relaxation to a contraction state). Spatially, this electromechanical activation forms the electromechanical wave front that follows the propagation pattern of the electrical activation sequence. At high frame rate, electromechanical wave imaging (EWI) uses radiofrequencybased cross-correlation, a motion estimation method that can be up to 10 times more accurate than brightness mode (B mode)-based speckle tracking. Ultimately, being able to see the motion (displacement or deformation) induced by the electromechanical coupling makes it possible to deduce the mechanical activation timing and to map it (37,38). Assessment of MS: Natural waves and shear wave elastography (acoustic radiation force). What is stiffness? Stiffness is an intrinsic property of soft tissues that reflects the tissue composition and organization at macroscopic and microscopic scales. Conventional assessment of softtissue elastic properties (i.e., stiffness) relies on mechanical testing, for instance by the application of an external stress and the measurement of the resulting tissue deformation. This general principle was developed for the analysis of elastic properties of ex vivo tissues, and was then applied to noninvasive imaging techniques such as ultrasound or MRI through the quantification of the deformation using the so-called static elastography technique. Static elastography, however, does not provide a quantitative estimate of tissue stiffness because the stress distribution cannot be quantified accurately in vivo, even though strain imaging", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF147": {"text": ", O. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol Img. 2020;13(8):1771-91. Possible applications of ultrafast ultrasound imaging in cardiology. propagation of low-frequency shear waves in tissue were introduced to overcome this limitation. These approaches rely on tracking shear wave propagation at ultrafast frame rates (>1,000 fps) to quantify the shear velocity are quantitative thanks to the direct link between shear velocity and shear modulus (Equation 1). They have now been implemented in commercial medical devices and ultrasound scanners to quantify stiffness in the breast, liver, or skeletal muscles.Assuming that the medium is incompressible, infinite, and isotropic, shear wave propagation velocity can be derived from general equations of the dynamic theory of linear elasticity(41). Therefore, the stiffness of a tissue can be approximated by estimating the shear modulus (m) using the equation relating shear wave speed (Vc), shear modulus (m), and local density (r), knowing that r is almost constant in soft tissue (r z 1,000 kg/m 3 ):", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF148": {"text": "Stiffness shear wave is initiated by an external stimulus and then visualized by UF imaging.

Ultrafast imaging measured Vc in soft tissue is in the order of 1 to 10 m/s, or 1 to 10 mm/ms, which is within the temporal resolution of ultrafast imaging. A shear wave can be generated by using an external force or can occur naturally related to intrinsic mechanical events such as valve closure. External stimulus: acoustic radiation force. External generation of shear waves in soft tissue is possible using acoustic radiation force (40,42). A short burst of several hundred microseconds of focused ultrasound can induce micrometric tissue displacements in a small zone of myocardium (Figure 2, Video 3). The transient mechanical excitation produces a shear wave in the low-kHz frequency range, which propagates through the myocardium at a velocity that is dependent on the tissue stiffness (42). Using ultrafast imaging, myocardial wall motion is subtracted from the average wall motion during the acquisition, resulting in net tissue motion induced by the shear wave. Vc can be computed at each depth of the image using the spatiotemporal data of the shear wave propagation. Finally, the shear modulus m (i.e., stiffness) can be derived at each location using Equation 1. The advantage of using an external stimulus to generate the shear waves is that it is possible to choose both the timing of the tissue assessment and the location of the shear wave source. Indeed, because the shear wave is generated by an external stimulus controlled by the investigator, one can", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF149": {"text": "Stiffness", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF150": {"text": "at any time during the cardiac cycle(43).Because MS varies throughout the cardiac cycle(43,44), one may analyze the MS at a time in the cardiac cycle relevant to the clinical question (during the active relaxation or the diastasis for example).The disadvantage of this approach is that it is only possible to analyze a specific myocardial region, as defined by the push area. Indeed, because of the physical properties of both the shear wave (kHz frequency) and the medium (e.g., thickness of the myocardium), shear wave propagation is interpretable only in an area of few centimeters(45). It is therefore a segmental analysis and only reflects MS within the interrogated area.Measuring shear wave velocities using internal events. The motion of the heart can be summarized as contraction and relaxation of the myocardium (Figure 3). However, the local motion of cardiovascular tissues over the course of an entire cardiac cycle results from various transient events such as the valvar closing and opening, sudden changes in blood pressure, and electrical conduction through the myocardium. All of these events elicit natural mechanical waves during the cardiac cycle (14). During valve closure, a transient mechanical shear wave is generated at the annulus of the valve, which propagates through the adjacent myocardium (46). Similarly, sudden changes in chamber pressure, such as following atrial contraction, generates left ventricular (LV) myocardial stretch that propagates from base to apex with a speed proportional to myocardial elasticity (47). The correlation between MS and myocardial stretch, using the theory of wave propagation in elastic tubes (Moens-Korteweg equation), deserves further exploration (48,49). Currently, only shear waves induced by the aortic or mitral valve closure have been used to deduce the shear velocity. The advantage of this approach is that only ultrafast imaging, without external acoustic radiation force, is used to visualize and analyze natural phenomena (50). Usually, tissue velocity is estimated between every 2 frames using a Doppler autocorrelation method. Anatomical acceleration M-mode maps are extracted along the midline of the LV septum, yielding a spatiotemporal representation of the local tissue acceleration throughout the cardiac cycle(50). Moreover, the amplitude of these natural waves is at least 1 order of magnitude higher than acoustic radiation force-induced shear waves and thus are more easily visualized(45). The main disadvantage of this approach is that the timing is dictated by the intrinsic event (i.e., the shear waves are visible just after atrioventricular valve closure [during isovolumetric contraction] and just after the", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF151": {"text": "Different shear waves have a variable propagation directivity and a wavelength that could make their analysis subject to bias. On the other hand, the shear wave generated by acoustic radiation force requires a more local analysis. affected by the geometry of the myocardial wall, making the link between shear velocity and stiffness more complicated (51)(Figure 4).Technical limitations. For relatively isotropic and homogeneous organs, such as the liver or breast, Young's modulus can be derived directly from the shear velocity (E z 3m). However, the propagation of elastic waves in the myocardium is more complex because of the active properties of the muscle fibers. This includes stiffness changing over time, the anisotropy of the tissue relating to the complex fiber orientation of different layers, and the geometry of the ventricles (52). These parameters induce a complex wave propagation in 3 dimensions, complicating the relationship between shear wave characteristics and elastic tissue properties (53). Moreover, guided wave propagation occurs when the wall thickness and the shear wavelength are on the same order of magnitude (54). The main consequence of this is a modification of the shear wave velocity and therefore, an alteration of the link between Vc and m (Equation 1). Correia et al. (55), using shear wave imaging (external stimulus) showed that the accuracy could be significantly altered for MS superior to 25 KPa and for myocardial wall thickness inferior to 5 mm in vitro on calibrated mimicking tissue phantoms using a phased-array probe (2.75 MHz). The reader should keep in mind that the link between shear velocity and stiffness is not always straightforward; therefore, shear velocity should be always reported by researchers. Complex biomechanical modeling can be used to derive viscoelastic parameters such as the elastic anisotropic properties of the myocardium (56).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF152": {"text": "Analysis of diastolic function is a major challenge in pediatric and congenital cardiology. Parameters conventionally used in adult cardiology, such as pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler, continuous-wave (CW) Doppler, or tissue Doppler imaging, have limitations in pediatrics for 2 main reasons: 1) these parameters are highly dependent on heart rate, heart size, and body size; and loading conditions in children. Dragulescu et al. (60) have shown that conventional ultrasound seems inadequate in pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy to assess diastolic dysfunction. More generally, the use of parameters depending on anatomy are limited in the presence of cardiac malformations (61,62). Ultrafast ultrasound allows a direct measurement of viscoelastic properties and diastolic MS. Initial data are promising. Using myocardial shear wave imaging, Song et al. (69) showed that measuring diastolic stiffness was feasible in children and they published reference values in healthy controls. Villemain et al. (8) showed that SWE could differentiate healthy volunteers and patients with sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Figure 5).

More validation is required but shear wave echocardiography is a promising new tool for the assessment of diastolic function in children. Nevertheless, whether by SWE or natural shear waves, the assessment of MS currently remains segmented (limited to 1 specific myocardial segment). This is the main application limitation of these techniques at the moment. Ultrafast ultrasound-based flow imaging techniques could also be used for studying diastolic function. The more detailed 2D/3D flow information as obtained with vector flow imaging, could be used to calculate energy losses during diastole and to calculate intraventricular pressure gradients during early filling representing early diastolic suction. Initial studies in adults have been promising but clinical validation in children is still required (63). SHUNT AND VALVAR DISEASE. The hemodynamic assessment of shunts and valvulopathies is complex in pediatric cardiology. Doppler-based imaging techniques are currently used in clinical settings using spectral analysis techniques (CW and PW Doppler) for local velocities and color-coded techniques (color flow imaging [CFI]) for flows in a wider field of view. Unfortunately, these techniques have inherent limitations including angle dependence and low frame rates, which may lead to inaccurate evaluation (64). In addition, both CFI and PW Doppler are limited by aliasing, limiting the velocity range and leading to potentially ambiguous results. Currently, estimation of valvar regurgitation is at best semiquantitative. Clearly, improved flow measurements are necessary. Ultrafast VFI possesses important advantages. Because of its low dependency of insonation angle and its temporal resolution, it can more accurately estimate flow and pressure gradients (13). Accordingly, it may be well-suited to study the hemodynamic consequences of a valvulopathy and for estimating flows through shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects (Figure 6) (65). Recently, Hansen et al. (66) compared VFI with conventional Doppler imaging and showed that VFI may provide additional information, in particular the flow analysis at the apex or in the ascending aorta, compared with conventional echocardiography and become a useful additional diagnostic tool. Fadnes et al. (65) also showed that complex intraventricular flow velocity patterns could be quantified using ultrafast VFI by comparing VFI with CFI and PW Doppler using manual angle correction. The angle independence of this parameter could significantly decrease variability when measuring peak velocities in shunt flows. In addition, more recently, the same group demonstrated the feasibility of VFI for cardiac 4D acquisitions (Figure 7) (33). They compared their results with MRI and showed that 4D VFI is reliable and robust. Using this approach, it might be possible to analyze and assess, in a volumetric acquisition and at the bedside, all relevant hemodynamic parameters (e.g., flow, pressure, size) of shunts and in different valvulopathies. One of the challenges for this approach remains the very large datasets that have to", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF154": {"text": "Dimensional Vector Flow Imaging Three-dimensional rendering of the flow path lines in 3 parts of the cardiac cycle corresponding to diastole, diastasis, and systole, respectively.

Although feasibility has been proven, it will be a long journey to a readily available clinical application.CORONARY IMAGING. CUDA (Figure 8) allows unprecedented noninvasive visualization and analysis of intramural coronary perfusion and hemodynamics such as coronary flow reserve. Osmanski et al. (26) showed that it is technically possible to visualize the coronary flow (veins and arteries). Then, Maresca et al. (10), in an animal model (using a coronary flow probe as gold standard) and in humans with a transthoracic model (children and adults), proved that the CUDA allowed an anatomical and hemodynamic analysis of the coronary flow. No other imaging tool is currently able to assess hemodynamic flow variation in the coronaries. Using power-velocity integrals, a metric proportional to flow rate (67), CUDA could provide a quantitative measurement of coronary flow variations and coronary flow reserve. This direct measurement of flow variation overcomes the limitations of existing Doppler techniques allowing for the analysis of dynamic myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, except for this clinical publication, to our knowledge there are no other published clinical applications of CUDA. In addition, a linear probe was used in this work, which theoretically limits clinical applications in cardiology. It will therefore be necessary to provide evidence of the application of this technique with a phased-array probe. Notwithstanding, a variety of pathological situations could benefit from this new capability. For example, right ventricular (RV) function is a major determinant of prognosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Thus, the global impairment of stress flow dynamics may indicate altered global vasoreactivity, and quantitative changes in microcirculation suggest that their role in the pathogenesis of systemic RV dysfunction is important. Nevertheless, positron emission tomography is difficult to use in clinical practice, especially in pediatrics (72). Access to a noninvasive bedside tool such as CUDA to analyze myocardial perfusion could be revolutionary. Last, Nield et al. (73) investigated whether specific coronary Doppler patterns intraoperatively predicted adverse early myocardial events in newborns with transposition of the great arteries before the arterial switch operation. Forty patients were recruited and 32 had intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography plus an epicardial echocardiogram during surgery. They showed that flow reversal in the left coronary artery was associated with the composite endpoint (postoperative STsegment changes, ventricular tachycardia, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and for delayed chest closure. This suggests that in transposition of the great arteries, myocardial perfusion analysis just before and immediately after arterial switch operation provides information relevant to the patient's clinical course. Further clinical studies using ultrafast imaging are expected to explore intramural perfusion in these patients. CARDIOMYOPATHIES AND MYOCARDIAL FIBER STRUCTURE. Risk assessment in a variety of pediatric cardiomyopathies using conventional imaging parameters is quite limited (60). The ultrafast ultrasound tools previously described could aid in the evaluation and risk stratification of pediatric cardiomyopathies and myocarditis. In adults (74) and in children (8), Villemain et al. explored the potential of SWE to distinguish normal from pathological, finding a strong correlation between SWE and clinical status.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF157": {"text": "Myocardial Three-dimensional representation of fibers orientation in the left ventricle of an open-chest sheep at 4 different moments of the cardiac cycle. Also see Video 4. Adapted with permission from Papadacci et al. . Therefore, ultrafast imaging could shed new light on myocardial function and structure, especially in a variety of cardiomyopathies. In a systematic review on hypertrophic cardiomyopathies published in 2002, Maron (75) noted that the \"LV myocardial architecture is disorganized [.] with multiples intercellular connections often arranged on chaotic alignment and with expanded interstitial (matrix) collagen.\" This is supported by previous work that tried to link myocardial histological explorations and MS (76). The degree and type of myocardial fiber disarray is different according to the etiology of cardiomyopathy, and the new tools presented (shear wave imaging, BTI, ETI) allow a quantitative assessment of this disarray. Despite this, shear wave imaging and ETI currently only allow for segmental exploration. which could limit the use of these techniques for the global understanding of a myocardial fiber's disarray. Moreover, because of frame rate limitations, myocardial (or ventricular) structure cannot yet be observed in the beating heart, with the exception of BTI (Figure 9) (16). The understanding of cardiac embryogenesis is a fundamental point in the analysis of the function and structure in CHD. For example, the right ventricle has distinct embryological origins from the second heart field, whereas the left ventricle originates from first heart field progenitors (77). This may partially explain the varied molecular response and histological makeup of the right ventricle relative to the left ventricle when subjected to increased pressure and volume loading, and may explain why well-proven medical therapies for LV dysfunction fail to show benefit for RV failure (78). The normal RV myocardial architecture has superficial circumferential fibers and deep longitudinal fibers, with the majority of contraction occurring longitudinally from base to apex under normal circumstances.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF158": {"text": ", the authors were able to compare noninvasively electrical activation delays, (A) before and (B) after radiofrequency ablation of accessory pathways.

RHYTHM DISORDERS. Ultrafast ultrasound allows the study of electromechanical coupling, which could be useful for detecting abnormal electrical activation patterns. Recently, by studying 15 pediatric patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Melki et al. (38) have shown that EWI was capable of consistently localizing accessory pathways with better accuracy than traditional clinical tools, such as that of Arruda or Boersma (Figure 10), using invasive electrophysiology as the gold standard. Studying electrical activation patterns may facilitate preparation of complex electrophysiology procedures and may help in better understanding pathophysiology of bundle branch block. The main limitation of the EWI lies in its absolute necessity to be realized in volume acquisition, therefore in 3D/4D, because of the variability of propagation of the electrical activity. As long as this technique is not tested and confirmed with matrix probes able to perform ultrafast imaging, these results will remain questionable from a clinical point of view. VASCULAR APPLICATIONS. Ultrafast ultrasound imaging could also be used for the assessment of vascular stiffness using localized vessel wall pulse wave velocity and wall shear stress measurements.The conventional method of looking at vascular stiffness includes the measurement of pressure wave propagation (tonometry) over relatively long distances such as carotid-brachial or carotid-femoral, resulting in relative nonspecific assessment of vascular stiffness. More local assessments of different vascular beds could be important because regional vessel wall remodeling may be present and may be clinically relevant, especially in CHD. A good example is patients after coarctation of the aorta, in which significant differences were found in vessel wall structure proximal and distal from the coarctation (79). Studying regional wall properties would thus", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF159": {"text": "liver stiffness (LS) and central venous pressure (CVP), pre-and post-volume loading, with an example of evaluation of LS by shear wave elastography (kPa). Adapted with permission from Villemain et al. novel information. Ultrafast ultrasound allows for measurement of pulse wave velocities in shorter vessel segments. Couade et al. (80) showed using SWE that a local assessment of arterial stiffness is possible. Afterwards, Maksuti et al. (81) confirmed these results comparing in vitro SWE and mechanical testing to assess arterial stiffness. Concerning clinical applications, Marais et al. (82) compared local assessment (by SWE) to global assessment (by the reference technique [e.g., tonometry]) to differentiate healthy volunteer and essential hypertensive patients. They showed that local assessment presents heterogeneous results and allows to identify the stiffest areas. Bernal et al. (83) also demonstrated that SWE could estimate the stiffness of vascular anastomoses in synthetic material, namely polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron). Knowing that the use of these materials is very frequent in pediatric cardiac surgery and that their stiffening is one of the most recurrent problems during the growth of children, the analysis of their stiffness seems essential. In addition, although this application seems more limited in pediatrics, the evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque by SWE is also a new tool opening new perspectives in the understanding of this disease, in particular to identify unstable plaques (84). Ultrafast Doppler also offers the possibility to quantitatively map the vascular resistivity index over large areas as performed in the brain of neonates using trans fontanelle imaging (22). Thanks to the very high sensitivity of ultrafast Doppler, functional brain imaging has been shown feasible in neonates by Demen\u00e9 et al. (27). LIVER STIFFNESS. Studying liver stiffness (LS) in cardiac patients provides information on central venous pressure (CVP) as shown almost 10 years ago (85). SWE has become a well-established technique for evaluating LS and has been applied to assess CVP. In a pediatric population with CHD, Jalal et al. (20) showed a strong correlation between LS and CVP assessed during right heart catheterization. Villemain et al. (19) compared LS with other parameters used in clinical practice (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, inferior vena cava diameter, pulsed-Doppler profile of hepatic veins) to estimate CVP (also assessed during right heart catheterization) and showed that it had the strongest correlation with CVP. Moreover, LS varies over time with the CVP and could theoretically be used to monitor CVP (Figure 11). This is especially important because other echographic parameters (inferior vena cava collapsibility, hepatic vein pulsed Doppler,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF160": {"text": "Left) The 4 phases of the cardiac cycle are readily displayed on the PV loop, which is constructed by plotting instantaneous pressure vs volume.

By studying the volume and pressure in a cavity, assessment of hemodynamic pump parameters and of intrinsic ventricular properties became possible (90). Likewise, strain (\u03b5, segment length relative to a specified standardized length) can assess the contractility (91,92) and MS (m) will affect diastolic function (93,94), especially in late diastole (EDPVR) (Figure 12) (95,96).

Adapted with permission from Villemain et al.(74). Abbreviations as in The EDPVR is currently the index for characterizing the passive elastic properties of the entire ventricle. Chamber stiffness is the change in ventricular pressure relative to a change in its volume, as reflected by the slope of the EDPVR (b). Therefore, chamber stiffness, which is by definition independent of loading conditions, is a central parameter for understanding the EDPVR and hence diastolic function.It would be useful to clinicians to be able toquantify noninvasively myocardial diastolic properties and ventricular compliance independent of the loading conditions. Current echocardiography parameters to evaluate diastolic function are dependent on loading conditions and often interdependent. Moreover, most of these parameters reflect early relaxation and not end-diastolic or passive stiffness as described by Zile et al. (97). Ultimately, clinicians need to integrate multiple parameters (including mitral inflow by pulsed wave Doppler, mitral annular velocities by tissue Doppler imaging, pulmonary venous flow by PW Doppler, velocity of flow progression by M-mode and color Doppler) to differentiate between normal and abnormal pathological groups (98). This is particularly the case in many pathological situations, such as cardiomyopathies (99) and heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (100). There is therefore a need to develop new diagnostic tools to better characterize and manage these patients. During the past decade, shear wave elastography was proposed to quantify the end-diastolic myocardial stiffness. Early studies were performed and validated on large-animal models such as an ovine model of infarcted myocardium (101). Noninvasive shear wave imaging evaluation of diastolic myocardial stiffness was able to differentiate between stiff, noncompliant infarcted wall and softer wall containing stunned myocardium. This was highly correlated with local invasive measurements of the end-diastolic strain-stress relationship performed with sonomicrometers and pressure catheters (101). Recently, several proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the possibility of estimating MS by ultrafast imaging in adults (48,50,74,102). External acoustic radiation force was used in patients with sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, showing that MS was significantly higher in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients than in healthy volunteers (75) (Figure 13).

Petrescu et al. (50), using natural valve closure, observed significantly higher MS in patients with cardiac amyloidosis compared with healthy volunteers and also increases in MS with aging (Figure 14). Concerning cardiac amyloidosis, Pislaru et al. (49), working on correlation between MS and myocardial stretch, showed a relation between patient outcome and MS estimated by this approach. Investigation of MS in dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart transplant were also performed using natural valve closure (104). Therefore, now that proof of concept in human application of these techniques has been demonstrated, possible applications seem numerous and varied, including the assessment of diastolic function at the bedside. The challenge now is to incorporate MS into clinical management and to validate its use for the diagnosis and management of diastolic dysfunction.

During cardiac contraction, myocardial stiffness becomes driven by the myocyte contraction and matrix elasticity (105).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF164": {"text": "Noninvasive measures of cardiac function are sometimes used as surrogates for systolic function.These measures include ejection fraction, wall motion, and myocardial strain. Current noninvasive measures of myocardial wall motion and function do not directly reflect myocardial contractility. MS could be a more direct parameter linked to intrinsic myocardial contractility(107)(108)(109). Using PV relations, Sagawa et al.(107) andMirsky et al. (110)    showed the relation between myocardial stiffness and contractility. Using isolated papillary muscles, Taubert et al.(108) showed that inotropic agents increase MS during systole. It has also been shown that transverse stiffness, measured using small highfrequency indentations, is an index of contractility in beating canine interventricular septum(111). In summary, MS could be used to better understand the systolic function.To date, however, MS has not been used in clinical practice to measure contractility even though several studies have demonstrated that systolic MS estimated by ultrafast imaging could provide new insights into systolic function (43,112). Pernot et al. (43), in Langendorff perfused isolated rat hearts, demonstrated that systolic MS increased immediately after isoproterenol stimulation and followed the development of systolic pressure. They concluded that systolic MS provides a noninvasive index of myocardial contractility. In the same preclinical model, Vejdani-Jahromi et al. (112) reached the same conclusion. These experiments were performed using external acoustic radiation stimulation and ultrafast imaging to be able to select the timing of assessment. Nevertheless, Petrescu et al. (50), using natural valve closure, have demonstrated that end-systole MS (just after aortic valve closure) was different between healthy volunteers and patients with cardiac amyloidosis. As such, it is the only study to date to investigate MS for assessment of systolic function in humans. Ultrafast imaging, now applicable in clinical practice, would therefore offer the possibility of having a quantitative parameter more directly related to myocardial contractility. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to validate the clinical application of MS for assessment of systolic function. CURRENT CLINICAL LIMITATIONS OF MS ASSESSMENT BY ULTRAFAST ULTRASOUND IMAGING. The main clinical limitation, common to both approaches (internal or external stimulus), is currently a segmented and not a global myocardial analysis. This is similar to the history of speckle tracking imaging, which was initially developed to allow segment analysis and then gradually improved to allow a global analysis of the heart.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF165": {"text": "of myocardium as well(14,37).There are therefore 2 natural events that can overlap, very close in a temporal point of view. However, the sequence of myocardial activation cannot be correlated to MS because there is no link between these 2 parameters. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of electromechanical waves, which have a propagation speed in the same order of magnitude as shear waves in the myocardium, so that these events can be differentiated.CONCLUSIONSUltrafast ultrasound imaging is a recent technology in cardiology. Because of its innovative character and the importance of the varied applications it offers, it has the potential to become a central noninvasive tool in this field. However, some questions remain unanswered, and collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and manufacturers will play a key role in achieving this goal. In this review, we aimed to shed light on current and possible future clinical applications of ultrafast ultrasound imaging in cardiology.

The disease primarily involves the lungs and progresses through 3 stages of increasing severity, corresponding to distinct histopathologic, imaging, and clinical findings (6-8).The first stage involves the incubation period, SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respiratory system, and potential spread to target organs. During this phase, alveolar and interstitial inflammation is mild and patchy and usually shows a bilateral, peripheral, and lower distribution, with patients presenting with mild respiratory and systemic symptoms.The second stage is characterized by localized lung inflammation, which shows different grades of severity, ranging from severe interstitial inflammation and thickening to air-space consolidation. Patients develop symptoms of viral pneumonia and eventually hypoxia, leading to clinical deterioration and need for hospitalization. In a subgroup of patients, transition to the third stage occurs. This phase is dominated by widespread lung inflammation and systemic inflammatory syndrome triggered by a dysregulated host immune response and cytokine storm, causing hyperinflammation, ARDS, shock, and multiorgan damage. Clinical features of COVID-19 are variable. Although the majority of patients present with only mild respiratory and systemic symptoms, some progress to severe forms of viral pneumonia and eventually develop severe systemic inflammatory manifestations, with an increasingly higher case fatality rate (7). Cardiovascular adverse events may occur at different stages, complicating the course of the disease and leading to unfavorable out-This may be a consequence of viral tropism for the endothelium and (presumably) for the myocardium. A link between the respiratory syndrome and the pleomorphic cardiovascular manifestations associated with COVID-19 could be identified in angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a membrane-bound enzyme that serves as cell-entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (9). This receptor is expressed in a variety of tissues, including lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, as well as arterial smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (9). On the basis of previous data from the SARS-CoV epidemic, myocardial infection by coronavirus is a possibility: in an autopsy series, SARS-CoV ribonucleic acid was found in 35% of sampled hearts, along with macrophage infiltration and myocardial damage", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF168": {"text": "caused severe left ventricular dysfunction but showed some degree of systolic function recovery following medical therapy, ranging from progressive improvement to complete myocardial function restoration.

In the absence of proven SARS-CoV-2 infection of the myocardium, the clinical these case reports with other possible differential diagnoses calls for prudence in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis. SECONDARY CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT. This is the result of indirect myocardial damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, it may represent the convergence of multiple different mechanisms. In a post-mortem examination from a patient with COVID-19 who developed ARDS, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cells were noted in heart specimens without structural damage (16). A hyperinflammatory response in the advanced stage of the disease elicits a cytokine storm, mediated chiefly by interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 pathways, closely resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a life-threatening hematologic disorder characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of activated lymphocytes and macrophages, with massive release of inflammatory cytokines (9). These cytokines have been implicated in myocardial injury and adverse remodeling in clinical and experimental models of acute coronary syndrome(s) (ACS) and may exhibit direct negative inotropic and metabolic effects on cardiomyocytes in sepsis-like settings (17). In addition, interleukin-1 plays a proven role in atherothrombosis, Agricola, E. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol Img. 2020;13(8):1792-808. Viral replication and host immune response synergistically determine coronavirus disease 2019 pathogenesis. As the disease progresses through its 3 stages, different chest imaging modalities (lung ultrasound, chest radiography, and computed tomography) demonstrate worsening lung involvement. In case of severe pneumonia, transthoracic echocardiography can identify increasing pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular impairment. Cardiovascular complications related to viral infection or to systemic inflammation can occur at different stages of the disease, increasing the risk for adverse outcome, and require specific multimodality imaging assessment.

This condition could either unmask underlaying obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or present as MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) in the presence of intense oxygen supply-demand imbalance(20). Moreover, altered pulmonary hemodynamic status may play a role in secondary cardiac involvement. In severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of higher positive endexpiratory pressure may be associated with increased right ventricular afterload and strain due to higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. Pulmonary circulation hypoxic vasoconstriction and superimposed pulmonary thromboembolic events may further precipitate these effects.WORSENING OF PRE-EXISTING CARDIOVASCULARDISEASES. This is frequently observed during COVID-19 and may explain the higher prevalence of patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities in nonsurvivor cohorts(3,4,21). Indeed, patients with heart failure are particularly vulnerable to hemodynamic decompensation during viral infections(22). Furthermore, in predisposed patients, arrhythmias may ensue as a result of multiple mechanisms, including hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and side effects of drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (i.e., hydroxychloroquine often combined with azithromycin) (2). MULTIMODALITY IMAGING IN COVID-19 CHEST RADIOGRAPHY. Recent radiology research on COVID-19 has been molded by the Chinese experience, with the vast majority of reports focusing on the role of chest computed tomography (CT), almost neglecting the contribution of chest radiography (CXR). However, European hospitals have drawn diagnostic algorithms in which CXR is described as a first-line triage tool, mainly because of its availability and feasibility and long turnaround times for reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, the American College of Radiology has pointed out that CT room decontamination after scanning patients with COVID-19 may disrupt radiological service availability and suggested that portable CXR might be considered the optimal tool to minimize the risk for cross-infection (23). As recently reported, CXR demonstrates typical radiographic features in the vast majority of patients with COVID-19, including ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation, while pleural effusion is not common (Table 2, Figure 1). In a retrospective cohort of 64 patients, Wong et al. (24) found that the common computed tomographic findings of bilateral involvement, peripheral distribution, and lower zone dominance can also be assessed on CXR and that the severity of findings on CXR peaked at 10 to 12 days after symptom onset, consistent with previous reports with CT (24). Although 6 of 64 patients demonstrated abnormalities on CXR before eventually testing positive on RT-PCR, baseline CXR sensitivity was 69%, significantly lower than that reported for initial RT-PCR and baseline CT (25). Moreover, in contrast to what has been previously reported for chest CT, radiographic and virological recovery times were not significantly different, thus reducing the role of CXR in clinical monitoring (25). A retrospective analysis of 9 South Korean patients who underwent both chest CT and CXR further decreased the sensitivity of CXR in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia to 33.3% (26). However, the significance of this result is limited by the small sample size. Recently, Bandirali", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF170": {"text": "et al. (27) proposed a role for CXR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients in epidemic regions, who may have positive radiographic findings even after 14 days of quarantine. To date, there are no consistent findings accurately depicting the course of disease on serial CXR. CHEST CT. Chest CT is a highly accurate imaging modality for pneumonia identification and characterization. As recently reported, chest CT demonstrates typical imaging features in patients with COVID-19, including bilateral GGOs, crazy paving pattern (GGOs with superimposed interlobular or intralobular septal thickening), and/or consolidations, predominantly in subpleural locations in the lower lobes; typically, discrete pulmonary nodules, lung cavitation, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathies are not present (28,29) (Table 2, Figure 2). Pan et al. (28) demonstrated that multiple computed tomographic scans could accurately depict the course of disease, summarized in 4 CT-based stages. Typical COVID-19 pneumonia often starts as small subpleural GGOs, mainly affecting the lower lobes (early stage, 0 to 4 days after symptom onset), which then rapidly develop into crazy paving pattern and consolidation areas, typically affecting both lungs (progressive stage, 5 to 8 days after symptom onset). Thereafter, dense consolidation becomes the most frequent finding (peak stage, 9 to 13 days after symptom onset). When infection resolves, the consolidation areas are gradually absorbed with residual GGOs and subpleural fibrotic parenchymal bands (absorption stage, >2 weeks after symptom onset) (Figure 2). Ai et al. (25) found that with RT-PCR as a reference, the sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 was 97%. Interestingly, these radiological findings are also observed in patients with clinical symptoms but negative RT-PCR results, and almost 50% and 33% of these patients were reconsidered as highly likely cases and as probable cases, respectively, in a comprehensive evaluation (25). Furthermore, 60% to 93% of patients had initial positive results on chest CT consistent with COVID-19, before the initial positive RT-PCR results (25). Finally, 42% of patients showed improvement on follow-up chest CT before RT-PCR results became negative (25). Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that patients with RT-PCRconfirmed COVID-19 might have normal findings on chest CT at admission, when disease is still subtle (30). Additionally, chest CT can be used for characterization of COVID-19 pneumonia severity. Yang et al. (31) proposed a CT-based severity score defined by summing individual scores from 20 lung regions; the individual scores in each lung, as well as the global severity score, were found to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with those with mild disease (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 94%). LUNG ULTRASOUND. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a widespread and validated technique for lung evaluation with features that make it very attractive for the assessment of patients affected by COVID-19 (32-34). LUS can be performed with any 2-dimensional scanner, including portable ones, using linear, convex, or phased-array probes. Specifically, a high-frequency linear probe is recommended to assess the pleural line, a phased-array low-frequency probe is suggested to evaluate deep consolidation, and a micro convex probe with a small footprint is useful for evaluating posterior fields in supine patients. The entire chest can be scanned with the probe oriented longitudinally or obliquely along the intercostal spaces. The scanning protocol consists of a 12-zone examination with 6 regions per hemithorax: the upper and lower parts of the anterior, lateral, and posterior chest wall, demarcated by the anterior and posterior axillary line(32,33).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF171": {"text": "\u00bc computed tomography; CXR \u00bc chest radiography; LUS \u00bc lung ultrasound. affected by subpleural interstitial syndrome with the appearance of B-lines, which increase in number as the pathology spreads, covering most of the pleural line. These findings correspond to GGOs and a reticular pattern on CT (Table 2). The characteristics of the B-lines help distinguish within interstitial syndrome between pneumonia or ARDS and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Specifically, inflammatory patterns are characterized by the presence of bilateral, irregularly distributed B-lines with spared areas and coalescent B-lines mostly in posterior fields; furthermore, the pleural line appears typically thickened and irregular, with reduced or absent lung sliding (32). As the disease progresses, lung consolidations become frequent. The subpleural consolidation areas are identified as anechoic hemispheric areas close to the pleural line with a hyperechogenic base. Extensive consolidation appears as nontranslobar and translobar consolidation with hepatization of lung tissue and air bronchogram, which distinguish them from consolidations in resorptive atelectasis (Figure 3). However, LUS also presents limitations, as it is operator dependent, and abnormalities affecting the central regions surrounded by aerated lung are not detectable. With the aim of increasing reproducibility, it would be convenient to establish a scanning model and a severity score.

Compact and highly mobile machines should be the ideal ultrasound systems to adopt, privileging dedicated probes and machines in infected areas. A miniaturized handheld ultrasound system that can be easily protected and cleaned may be an alternative option(35,36).A pragmatic strategy based on the use of focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) seems the most reasonable approach(37). FoCUS should be combined with LUS for the evaluation of patients with respiratory failure. The COVID-19 crisis highlights the need for imagers to be cross-trained (LUS and FoCUS) and nimbler: sonographers, cardiologists, and emergency physicians who are not familiar with LUS can learn quickly with initial support from expert colleagues and web resources(38). However, because FoCUS is not performed as the definitive diagnostic test, if no usable information is obtained, comprehensive echocardiography and/or other diagnostic testing must be considered(37).

The clinical presentation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may encompass a variable combination of dyspnea and chest pain, electrocardiographic alterations, and cardiac enzyme dispersion, challenging the differentiation between pulmonary and cardiovascular etiology of these findings and requiring advanced imaging to clarify the diagnosis. Several reports hint at an increased risk for venous and arterial thromboembolism, while our clinical experience and other reports suggest that some patients with COVID-19 presenting with ACS-like syndromes may not have obstructive CAD on invasive coronary angiography (ICA), falling into the wide spectrum of MINOCA(19,20). In this clinical scenario, CT may represent a valuable \"one-stop shop\" approach for the combined assessment of pneumonia, PE(Figure 4), and obstructive CAD (Figure 5)to guide further management, limiting the use of ICA to selected cases (Figure 6).Computed tomographic coronary angiography is a well-established tool to effectively and safely rule out CAD in the setting of acute chest pain, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value (95% to 100%)(39).

Although most of the currently available computed tomographic scanners allow imaging of the coronary arteries with high resolution and limited motion artifacts, clinical judgment is advised, as dedicated scanners can improve image quality. Additionally, computed tomographic angiography can rule out left atrial appendage thrombus, allowing direct-current cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation, thereby limiting operator exposure deriving from TEE. Moreover, cardiac CT can provide advanced diagnostic assessment through myocardial characterization (41). Indeed, CT can be completed with a delayed iodine-enhanced scan to identify areas of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis. This further evaluation may be especially useful in patients with MINOCA, making it possible to differentiate MI from stress cardiomyopathy, which is typically characterized by an absence of myocardial late enhancement, and to diagnose acute myocarditis, detecting myocardial scar with typical nonischemic pattern. In this case, one can speak of \"quadruple rule-out,\" with a single examination looking for lung involvement, coronary and pulmonary artery patency, and myocardial scar (42).

The recent introduction of parametric mapping enables CMR to reveal diffuse myocardial edema that can be missed by conventional sequences, increasing its accuracy in the diagnosis of inflammatory cardiomyopathies. Currently, a few case reports have shown CMR findings consistent with acute myocarditis in patients with laboratory-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection (13-15). Myocardial edema was the key for CMR diagnosis in all of these cases, underscoring the importance of including mapping techniques in CMR protocols adopted in patients with COVID-19 with suspected myocarditis (43). Therefore, in selected patients with COVID-19 not requiring ICU support, when clinical presentation and biomarker alterations suggest acute-onset myocardial inflammation, if the diagnosis is likely to influence management, CMR may be considered to confirm acute myocarditis, after the exclusion of alternative relevant clinical conditions, including ACS and heart failure, by means of other rapidly available imaging modalities (i.e., cardiac CT or TTE).NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY IMAGING.

Therefore, in patients with COVID-19, the use of nuclear cardiology tests should be restricted to very specific indications when they may yield diagnosis or directly influence clinical management and no alternative imaging modalities can be performed (i.e., suspected infective endocarditis of prosthetic valves or intracardiac devices), in order to reduce health care personnel exposure related to long protocols and imaging acquisition times (45). INVASIVE CARDIAC IMAGING. When evaluating the role of invasive cardiac imaging modalities in patients with COVID-19, several aspects deserve consideration. In the complex rearrangement of the health care service, all efforts should be directed to ensure the standard of care and timely access to the catheterization laboratory for patients with acute cardiovascular conditions, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the use of ICA in patients with COVID-19 should be restricted to those presenting with clinical or hemodynamic instability, including acute MI, myocarditis, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest (Figure 6). In these cases, an invasive strategy is pivotal to ensure diagnosis and interventional treatment (46). In addition, ICA eventually combined with coronary intravascular imaging or left ventriculography plays an important role in identification and differential diagnosis of MINOCA (9). On the basis of our direct experience, MINOCA accounts for >25% of ACS in patients with COVID-19.

Interestingly, although great emphasis has been placed on the link between myocardial injury and mortality, the actual incidence of specific cardiovascular clinical conditions (myocarditis, MI, PE, and heart failure) and the respective prognostic implications in different stages of COVID-19 are largely unknown because of a significant lack of imaging data (4). A systematic approach with the use of multimodality imaging to precisely characterize COVID-19-related cardiovascular manifestations should be warranted to provide clinicians with comprehensive risk stratification tools.

Real-time imaging with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is invaluable for guidance and procedural success. However, anatomic criteria may be unfavorable, and frequently >1 clip is needed, making standard 2D and 3D imaging techniques quite challenging. The advent of real-time 3D multiplanar reconstruction (live MPR) has a revolutionary potential, as it allows live simultaneous crossreferencing of multiple 2D high-resolution planes, along with a 3D volumetric representation (Videos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), with continuous monitoring of clip position and orientation (Figure 2). We present here the use of 3D MPR in challenging cases in which standard imaging was off-axis (Figure 3), the MR was commissural (Figure 4), leaflet calcification was present near the grasping zone (Figure 5), and additional clips were needed (Figure 6). Current limitations of live MPR include a drop in the spatial and temporal resolution, particularly relevant in assessing MR severity, and therefore it should be complemented by standard assessment. Live MPR value is not only limited to mitral valve interventions but also to tricuspid valve therapies (Supplemental Figure 1, Videos 7 and 8).

The standard 2D views, including the bicommissural (A) and long-axis (B), were foreshortened and failed to demonstrate the mitral regurgitant jet in an adequate fashion necessary for successful grasping. The use of live MPR during intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) allowed for the display of the standard, on-axis, grasping, and bicommissural views for proper positioning of the MitraClip device above the valve (C). Satisfactory visualization of leaflet insertion (D) and confirmation of adequate grasping (E) was therefore possible. Following clip deployment, 3D MPR with color shows interval significant reduction in the severity of mitral regurgitation (F).Commissural mitral valve pathology poses multiple significant challenges. The jet is typically eccentric along the commissural line (unlike the typical anteroposterior direction of the mitral regurgitation [MR] jet), and its origin difficult to clearly image and therefore to target for intervention. Also, there is a concern for an interaction between the MitraClip equipment and the submitral apparatus (papillary muscles and chordae), which is dense in that area. The use of 3D MPR is crucial to overcome these obstacles. It allows clear depiction of the pathology: there is a medial commissural flail (A) with resultant severe eccentric MR jet directed laterally along the commissural line (B). It also permits safe crossing into the left ventricle without interaction with the submitral apparatus (C), which is visualized in multiple planes simultaneously.

In A, the mitral regurgitation [MR] pathology was central between the middle scallops (A2 and P2); however, there were interfering areas of leaflet calcification, medially anteriorly, and laterally posteriorly (arrows, B).

The cutoff values of LVGLS provided in our systematic review predicts the occurrences of cardiac events and can assist in determining the optimal timing of surgery.

Myocardial work (MW) is a novel semiautomatic echocardiographic method which characterizes the efficacy of the left ventricular (LV) contraction by evaluating the amount of energy loss (wasted work [WW]) and the amount of work performed (constructive work [CW]) for each myocardial segment (1). We investigated regional differences in CW and WW between the septum and the lateral wall, its potential implications for CRT response, as well as the pattern of changes occurring early after CRT implantation. The review board of the Leiden University Medical Center approved this retrospective analysis of clinically acquired data and waived the need for patient written informed consent. A total of 168 patients (71% men, mean age 65 AE 10 years) with HF and sinus rhythm were included. Speckle-tracking echocardiography was used to assess MW at baseline and early after CRT implantation (within the first 5 days). LV global longitudinal strain, noninvasive blood pressure measurements, and valves opening and closure times were integrated to construct pressure-strain loops. CW and WW of the septal and lateral walls were calculated as the average values of basal and mid-ventricular segments. CRT response was defined as a decrease in LV end-systolic volume $15 % at 6-month follow-up. The interobserver and intraobserver variability of MW indices was assessed calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on 35 randomly selected patients.

The blood tests showed leukopenia (3,800 cells/ml) and troponin I increase (140 ng/l). Chest X-ray showed no pathological findings. Because of the COVID-19 emergency, a large-scale hub-and-spoke model was developed in the Lombardy region to select dedicated cardiology centers for management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) to support other general hospitals that were converted to treat only patients with COVID-19 (1). In agreement with this model, the patient received a nasopharyngeal swab that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in a dedicated catheterization laboratory. ICA demonstrated normal coronary arteries with a diagnosis of myocardial injury with nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was considered for further evaluation, it was not performed because of equipment and room cleaning and disinfection issues. The day after admission, to evaluate for lung infection, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial injury, as suspected by biomarker elevation, a modified scan protocol including a nonenhanced acquisition followed by electrocardiogram-triggered contrast-performed. The pre-contrast CT showed scattered patchy ground-glass opacities in the peripheral area of the lungs (Figures 1A to 1C), while the contrast-enhanced scan confirmed the absence of both pulmonary embolism and coronary artery disease (Figures 1D to 1G).

(1), describing the prevalence of right ventricular (RV) dilation among 105 patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Thirty-one patients were mechanically ventilated, and 32 patients (31%) presented with RV enlargement. The authors (1), however, do not refer on the proportion of mechanically ventilated patients with RV dilation. Mechanical ventilation, vasoactive medication use, and RV enlargement were significantly associated with increased mortality; however, all 3 are interrelated. Heart-lung interactions may be pronounced in COVID-19 pathophysiology under mechanical ventilation. When lung compliance is relatively normal, as has been reported in COVID-19 lung (2), a substantial amount of the alveolar pressure is transmitted to the pleural pressure. Increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels may induce dead space ventilation and compression of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and right heart dilation and dysfunction (3). Increased PVRs may be exacerbated in the setting of nonmassive pulmonary embolism (COVID-19 has been related to lung thrombotic events). This could be the case in the 5 patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism (computed tomography angiography) in the study by Argulian et al. (1). Moreover, relatively high PEEP, according to current guidelines (4), in a nonrecruitable lung with almost normal compliance (as in COVID-19) may significantly increase pleural pressure and have a detrimental impact on hemodynamics by deteriorating venous return (5). The effects are exaggerated when the patients are relatively hypovolemic in the initial phase after intubation (fever in the preceding days); restricted fluid resuscitation is also indicated in acute respiratory distress syndrome to keep the lung \"dry\" in an effort to improve oxygenation and avoid intubation (4). Increased PVRs and a reduction in venous return decrease the cardiac output. The first reaction to correct hypotension, in an intensive care unit setting, is vasopressor initiation. At the tissue level, hypovolemia and vasoconstriction induce hypoperfusion and end-organ damage, which can lead to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and an unfavorable outcome. Our rationale is that RV dilatation and dysfunction, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation are interchangeably related in patients with COVID-19. Argulian et al. (1) nicely report that all 3 factors are associated with increased mortality. It would be informative if the authors could provide data on: 1) RV dimensions before and after initiation of mechanical ventilation; 2) PEEP levels in patients with and without RV enlargement; and 3) possible associations between RV dimensions and PEEP levels.

ASSOCIATION OF CLUSTERS WITH THE CLINICAL SEVERITY OF HEART FAILURE. The clusters that formed based upon echocardiographic data showed meaningful correlations with the clinical stages of heart failure. The prevalence of patients with heart failure consistently increased from clusters I to IV (Table 1), with heart failure symptoms (New York Heart Association functional classification) showing progressive worsening from clusters I to IV. The median follow-up time was 138 days (Q1 to Q3: 100 to 213 days). In total. 25 (8.4%) patients experienced MACCE-related hospitalization (acute coronary syndrome: 3, recurrent myocardial infarction: 4, heart failure: 16, stroke: 2); these included 5 (1.6%) patient deaths due to MACCEs that occurred during the follow-up period in the enrolled patients. Importantly, there were no MACCE-related hospitalizations or deaths in cluster I, whereas cluster IV had both MACCE-related hospitalizations (23%; p < 0.001) and deaths (7%; p < 0.001) during this short follow-up period. From the Kaplan-Meier survival curves generated for the cluster model, we determined that cluster IV had significantly lower event-free survival for MACCEs compared with the remaining clusters (Figure 5) (p < 0.001). Furthermore, we performed multivariable Cox proportional analysis to adjust the prognostic implication of cluster information with clinical risk factors.

Automated machine learning allows selection of appropriate algorithms, their parameter settings, and the processing methods that would improve their ability to detect complex patterns in big data. The current study represents one of the first attempts in its application to cardiovascular disease state. The study opens up several opportunities of inquiry. First, larger studies with longer follow-up would allow eventual model outcome comparisons and confirmation. Inclusion of diverse sets of patients with different cardiac disease spectrums will allow evaluation of model generalizability. Furthermore, assessments following therapeutic interventions performed on specific patient phenotypes will allow an understanding of the extent of phenotypic reversibility in the disease loop. Just as the disease loop identified a stage with irrevocable risk, perhaps the study is also symbolic of the impact artificial intelligence would create, allowing our mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular diseases to branch off into the landscape of possibilities.

A ny cardiac imaging technique to be included in routine practice needs to contribute unique information in 3 areas: diagnosis, prognosis, and decision-making. Vasodilator stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) permits a comprehensive diagnostic work-up of patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) (1-3). The value of this technique for prognostication and decision-making is mostly derived from studies that analyzed the occurrence of combined endpoints in the short-to mid-term follow-up of small groups or meta-analyses made up of heterogeneous series of Recently, the multicenter SPINS (Stress CMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States) study comprehensively demonstrated the value of stress CMR for predicting the occurrence of death and/or myocardial infarction, as well as the cost-effectiveness of this approach (4). Whether coronary revascularization can improve prognosis in patients with SIHD and the role of myocardial ischemia in the decision-making process are matters of constant debate (5). The association of the effect of revascularization with all-cause mortality, depending on the extent of myocardial ischemia as derived from vasodilator stress CMR, has not been explored. We hypothesized that in a large registry of unselected patients with known or suspected SIHD who underwent vasodilator stress CMR, a more extensive ischemic burden would be associated with long-term, all-cause mortality and might help to identify those patients who derive the most benefit from revascularization in terms of all-cause mortality. METHODS REGISTRY. This study was based on a large registry that included all consecutive patients who underwent vasodilator stress CMR for known or suspected SIHD in our health department from 2001 to 2016. To guarantee the robustness of data collection and avoid missing values over such a long period of time, the database was defined to include a limited number of baseline characteristics-CMR data that were prospectively recorded and immediately entered into the predefined database. Of 6,700 patients included in the registry, the final registry consisted of 6,389 patients. Reasons for exclusion and for using vasodilator stress CMR are displayed inFigure 1. The referring cardiologists indicated the CMR studies as part of routine medical practice. They had full and unrestricted access to clinical reports, which includes all the variables described in the following. Decision-making (i.e., referral for revascularization) was left to their discretion. Our registry was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In September 2018, the local ethics committee approved a retrospective revision of the occurrence of all-cause mortality in the patients included in the registry. Authorized personnel carried out this revision using the electronic regional health system registry from October 2018 to November 2018. CMR DATA ANALYSIS. Technical aspects related to CMR studies are depicted in the Supplemental Appendix and elsewhere (1,3).

ISCHEMIC BURDEN AND ASSOCIATION WITH ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. During a median follow-up of 5.75 years (276 weeks; range 120 to 443 weeks), allcause mortality occurred in 717 patients (11%). The baseline and CMR characteristics of the entire registry, as well as of survivors and deceased patients, are displayed in Table 1. Regarding vasodilator stress CMR indexes, those patients who reached the endpoint displayed more dilated LV end-systolic and enddiastolic volumes indexes, more depressed LVEF, and a larger ischemic burden and a larger extent of LGE. The all-cause mortality rate increased in parallel with the ischemic burden (Figure 2, Central Illustration). Once adjusted for variables independently related to the occurrence of all-cause mortality (age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, current smoker and LVEF), a positive and significant association persisted between the ischemic burden and the risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.07 per increasing number of segments with PD post-stress; p < 0.001)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF16": {"text": ").

ACS \u00bc acute coronary syndrome; HQ \u00bc highest quartile; MACE \u00bc major adverse cardiovascular event(s).fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction rate in patients with suspected CAD undergoing coronary CTA versus standard of care was recently demonstrated in a subanalysis of SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial (23). Results from the present study confirmed the prognostic role of atherosclerosis evaluation by cardiac CT even beyond coronary stenosis evaluation. Plaque volume and particularly noncalcific plaque volume resulted to be the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular events over lumen stenosis and clinical risk profile. Of note, to distinguish calcific versus noncalcific plaques, we used a cutoff of 150 HU, which was recently demonstrated to be associated with detrimental downstream myocardial perfusion by positron emission tomography and invasive fractional flow reserve, irrespectively from lesion severity (24). Taking into consideration that induced myocardial ischemia has been clearly associated with future coronary events (25), evidence linking lowattenuation plaque volume and inducible myocardial ischemia may further support the prognostic role of advance plaque evaluation by coronary CTA. As expected, at univariate analysis the presence of MVD resulted to be associated with cardiovascular events at follow-up; however, when corrected for clinical risk profile and atherosclerotic burden, lumen stenosis quantification appeared to have only a marginal role in the identification of higher-risk patients. Recent data on ACS pathophysiology supports our findings, suggesting that the plaque at the site of the culprit lesion often does not cause flow-limiting stenosis when seen on a previous angiogram (26). comprised 62% of all events (27). To reduce the amount of related elective revascularization coronary CTA, early nonurgent revascularization (<6 months after coronary CTA) have been censored at follow-up in the present study. Of note, plaque volume quantification by coronary CTA appeared to be associated not only to future ACS occurrence, but also to the composite endpoint, including future late nonurgent revascularizations. This finding may be explained by the capability of plaque volume analysis to identify patients with higher risk of plaque progression early, as recently suggested in the PARADIGM (Progression of AtheRosclerotic PlAque DetermIned by Computed TomoGraphic Angiography IMaging) study (28), even in the absence of significative coronary stenosis at baseline. Traditional clinical risk factors alone appear to have a limited predictive value for not only atherosclerosis itself, but also adverse high-risk plaque characteristics. Separate multivariate analyses were performed in low and high clinical risk subgroups, confirming the independent prognostic role of noncalcified plaque volume in both groups of patients (Table 2, Supplemental Appendix). Despite this, our data suggested that some traditional risk factors and precisely elevated FRS (>20%) were associated with cardiovascular events, reaching statistical significance both at univariate analysis and in model 1, model 3, and model 4 for ACS occurrence.However, in model 2, when corrected for high noncalcified volume, neither FRS >20% or MVD were no more significantly associated to prognosis.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF48": {"text": "Continuous NRI and IDI of MVD Over FRS >20% and of Plaque Volume Over MVD \u00fe FRS >20%FRS >20% \u00fe MVD / FRS >20% \u00fe MVD \u00fe Pl Vol <30 HU FRS >20% \u00fe MVD / FRS >20% \u00fe MVD \u00fe Pl Vol <150 HU FRS >20% \u00fe MVD / FRS >20% \u00fe MVD \u00fe Pl Vol Tot IDI \u00bc integrated discrimination improvement; MVD \u00bc multivessel disease; NRI \u00bc netreclassification index; other abbreviations as in Tables 1 to 3.clinical data showed moderate incremental prediction of ACS and ACS \u00fe cardiac death, whereas a further impressive improvement was achieved when adding the plaque volume <30 HU and, particularly, plaque volume <150 HU. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival curves well described how plaque volume quantification plus clinical evaluation may have an additive prognostic role. Particularly, the absence of high noncalcified plaque volume identified low-risk patients independent of the presence of MVD. These findings are consistent for all different combined endpoints of the study.The additive prognostic value of high-risk atherosclerosis outlined by our study is in accordance with previous data suggesting that the integration of coronary artery characteristics and systemic risk features (i.e., thrombus-promoting factors) appears to be the most promising approach for acute coronary event risk assessment(29). STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, although its multicenter fashion, owing to its peculiar study design specifically aimed at selecting 2 extreme groups of patients, and owing to the involvement of only Caucasian patients, CAPIRE study results may not necessarily reflect the general population of other countries.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF49": {"text": "Kaplan-Meier curves for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ACS \u00fe cardiac death, and major adverse cardiovascular event(s) (MACE) showing similar event rate in patients with low noncalcified plaque (NCP) volume independent of the presence of multivessel disease (MVD) or left main involvement or Framingham Risk Score (FRS) >20%; event rates are significantly higher in patients with both MVD or FRS >20% and high noncalcified plaque volume (log-rank p < 0.001).Second, different scan parameters, accordingly to different body mass index values, were used among patients enrolled in the study, and this could have an influence on plaque attenuation value and analysis.However, this is a multicenter and multivendor study, making our data comparable to everyday clinical practice. Third, patients could have modified medication use or lifestyle after coronary CTA; we were not able to evaluate the influence of this possible bias on our results.Fourth, the survival analysis included in this study was based on a relatively low number of cardiac events recorded during the first 3 years of follow-up and should be considered of speculative interest.For the sake of transparency, we reported Akaike information criteria in SupplementalTable 3. Therefore, the future findings related to the entire period(10 years) of follow-up scheduled for this study will allow confirmation of the current results. Moreover, all analyses of the present study were performed at patient level, although it should be recognized that a single culprit lesion is usually responsible for ACS; therefore, further studies are needed to investigate whether these per-patient findings may also improve early identification of the specific culprit lesion that cause ACS. Last, although both standard and advanced analysis of coronary CTA findings have been performed by a core lab, the coronary CTAs were acquired at different local sites and with different scanners and acquisition protocols, with potential impact of the plaque analysis measurements. However, all coronary CTAs were performed in agreement with the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines by physicians with >4 years of experience in cardiac CT, in centers with an activity of at least 250 coronary CTAs per year. This study supports the role of advanced atherosclerosis evaluation by coronary CTA, demonstrating the prognostic value of both quantitative and qualitative high-risk plaque features, in the setting of extensive CAD (SIS >5), even beyond the presence of significative coronary stenosis and high clinical risk. Of note, the peculiar study design emphasized that elevated noncalcific plaque volume was not differently distributed in low-versus high-risk patients. The coexistence of both high-risk plaque characteristics and high clinical risk appear to have an additive role in determining prognostic stratification. However, it should be underlined the need to confirm our findings in larger settings, as they are based on a low number of hard events at follow-up.

Incremental prognostic utility of coronary CT angiography for asymptomatic patients based upon extent and severity of coronary artery calcium: PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: A non-negligible amount of patients exhibit ACS as first cardiovascular event. Thus, early identification of patients at higher risk is needed, beyond traditional risk factors and myocardial ischemia assessment. Results from this study suggest advanced plaque evaluation at coronary CTA as a promising tool for early detection of patients at increased risk. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The flow chart of stable CAD management is focused on traditional risk factors control and on detection of inducible myocardial ischemia. However, a complex interplay among biochemical factors and vulnerable atherosclerosis is needed to lead to ACS. Results from this study underline the emerging role of coronary CTA for the evaluation of coronary atherosclerosis and put the light on the need for future translational research trial to better integrate CAD clinical management with atherosclerosis pathophysiology.

(9) performed a multicenter prospective cohort study of 544 consecutive individuals who underwent coronary CTA for suspected but not known CAD. Only patients with low (0 to 1 traditional risk factors, nondiabetic) or high ($3 risk factors) clinical risk were included. Interestingly, patients with CAD present but involving <5 segments (SIS 1 to 4) were excluded. Experts in cardiac computed tomography (CT) performed qualitative and quantitative assessments of coronary atherosclerosis using commercially available vendor software (PlaqID, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Coronary stenosis and high-risk plaque features were assessed in standard fashion. Total coronary plaque volume (mm 3 ) was reported on a per-patient level, not indexed to coronary artery length or patient size, and plaque was quantified and categorized as noncalcified (<150 HU), fibrofatty (30 to 150 HU), or low attenuation (<30 HU). A strength of the study was the measurement of several circulating biomarkers to include highsensitivity troponin, in addition to risk factors and several validated CT risk scores (SIS, CT-Leaman). Specifically, higher volumes of noncalcified and lowattenuation plaque were the strongest predictors of the combined endpoint on multivariable and reclassification analyses. In patients with severe lumen stenosis, those with high noncalcified plaque volume demonstrated the highest risk for adverse events. Andreini et al. (9) are to be commended for this important addition to the growing body of published data suggesting that it is the volume of coronary atherosclerosis, especially low-attenuation and noncalcified plaque, that most powerfully predicts risk when assessed by coronary CTA. So, are the days of percent stenosis as the primary standard bearer for describing and reporting CAD severity over? Not just yet. Several important limitations to the current study should prompt readers to view these results as hypothesis generating. First, the study population was relatively small and highly selected based on their risk factor profile, CTA findings, and image quality. Most patients (n \u00bc 342) had no CAD on CTA, a population known to be at exceedingly low risk. Furthermore, 42 patients who underwent coronary revascularization within 6 months after CTA were censored from the outcomes analysis. Ultimately, there was a very small number of hard cardiovascular outcomes (8 myocardial infarctions, 1 cardiovascular death), with elective late revascularizations, a soft outcome prone to selection bias, composing the majority (13 of 22) of \"events.\" Lastly, it should be noted that coronary plaque volume was measured semiquantitatively with manual lumen and plaque boundary corrections by experts in the field and using studies screened for adequate image quality. Despite these limitations, these data are exciting when viewed in the broader context of the growingFIGURE 1 Milestones for Clinical Adoption of Plaque Quantification on Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Whole-Heart Plaque Quantification Milestones to Widespread Clinical Adoption", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF51": {"text": ". First, high image quality CTA studies are a pre-requisite for accurate, reproducible, automated plaque measurements. Performing plaque quantification and characterization on overly noisy images or those with significant artifacts will undoubtedly lead to inaccurate results. Providers should strive for high image quality while always attempting to limit patient contrast and radiation exposure. As such, studies using plaque quantification must be validated across a range of tube potential (kVp) and noise levels. Similarly, studies exploring the accuracy of plaque quantification using monoenergetic (keV) spectral reconstructions are needed. Fortunately, advances in CT detector technology, iterative reconstruction, and spectral imaging technologies will likely continue to improve the ability to detect and quantify coronary atherosclerosis using CTA in an automated fashion.With multiple vendors developing competing software and the increasing use of various machine learning methods, studies are needed to assess for meaningful differences in accuracy and reproduc-ibility across platforms. Furthermore, the optimal HU thresholds to define plaque types and the technique for reporting plaque findings will hopefully become standardized. For example, in addition to total coronary plaque volume, percent atheroma volume (the proportion of total vessel wall volume occupied by atherosclerotic plaque) and/or plaque volume indexed to coronary or patient size have been reported by many. Moreover, age-and sex-based volume thresholds for mild, moderate, and severe abnormalities remain to be defined. Finally, the impact of these features to guide interventions, whether nutritional, medical, or mechanical, begs further investigation.With these refinements, we look forward to fulfilling the 6-decade-long journey that was started byDrs. Dotter and Sones, moving beyond the negative space of lumen stenosis to integrating the totality of features in coronary atherosclerosis. ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Todd C.

Therefore, combined CTP and CTDE has the potential to differentiate myocardial ischemia from infarction. Previous studies showed that myocardial ischemia detected with perfusion imaging and delayed enhancement imaging by MRI was a strong predictor of cardiac events (8,9). Similarly, the detection of myocardial ischemia by CTP with CTDE might improve risk stratification. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of stress dynamic CTP with CTDE in patients with suspected or known CAD and in subgroups of patients with stent, heavy calcification, or stenosis. METHODS STUDY POPULATION. This study was designed as a single-center, retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed for 618 consecutive patients who completed a comprehensive cardiac CT examination for evaluation of ischemic heart disease at our hospital between March 2012 and February 2017 (Figure 1). The cardiac CT examinations included calcium scoring, CTA, stress dynamic CTP, and CTDE. The acquisition and analysis of the cardiac CT images were approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients at the time of cardiac CT. Exclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1) age of <45 or >85 years (n \u00bc 25); 2) no written informed consent for followup, which was approved by the institutional review board (n \u00bc 15); and 3) severe artifacts on CTP due to motion or breathing (n \u00bc 15). Thus, 55 patients who met the criteria were excluded, and we enrolled 563 patients, who had follow-up after the cardiac CT was performed. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up; therefore, the final study population comprised 540 patients with suspected or known CAD. Known CAD was defined as having a history of Siemens Healthineers). Patients were asked to avoid drinks containing caffeine for at least 24 h before undergoing stress testing. Unenhanced images for Agatston calcium scoring were acquired with electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered high-pitch spiral scanning with 120-kV tube voltage before stress dynamic CTP (10).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF52": {"text": "minimum distance of 1 mm from the endocardial and epicardial borders to avoid contamination. When any myocardial scarring was identified on CTDE, we did not include areas matching the myocardial scarring within regions of interest on the MBF map. A normalized MBF value was calculated as an MBF value in each segment divided by the highest MBF value within the 16 segments on the MBF map.Ischemic score was calculated by adding the scores of all segments using a 5-point scale based on normalized MBF values: 0 \u00bc normal (>0.75), 1 \u00bc mildly abnormal (#0.75, >0.675), 2 \u00bc moderately abnormal (#0.675, >0.60), 3 \u00bc severely abnormal (#0.6), and 4 \u00bc absent (11). Ischemic perfusion defect (IPD) was defined as ischemic score $4. When myocardial scarring covered an entire segment, the score for that segment was counted as 0. Calcium score images were analyzed with a commercially available software package (Ziosta-tion2, Ziosoft Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using the Agatston score with a cutoff of 130 Hounsfield units. The analysis for calcium score was performed only for patients with suspected CAD, because most of the patients with known CAD had stents or bypass grafts (13). CTA images were visually evaluated in a joint reading by 2 observers, including a radiologist with 10 years of experience in CTA. Coronary segments with a reference diameter of $1.5 mm were assessed for the detection of stenosis. Obstructive CAD, severe stenosis, multivessel disease, and proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis on CTA was defined as $50% stenosis in $1 vessel, $70% stenosis in $1 vessel, $50% stenosis in $2 vessels, and $50% stenosis in the left main or proximal LAD, respectively. CTDE images were visually evaluated to determine the presence or absence of hyperenhancement suggestive of myocardial scarring within each of the 16 segments by the consensus decision of 2 observers. Examples of perfusion defect and myocardial scarring are shown in Figure 2. The transmural extent of scarring was scored in each segment on CTDE images using a 5-point scale: 0: 0%; 1: 1% to 24%; 2: 25% to 49%; 3: 50% to 74%; and 4: 75% to 100%. Scar score was calculated by summing up the scores in all segments. FOLLOW-UP. Follow-up information was collected through a review of hospital records or telephone interviews blinded to CT results. Patients who underwent early (#60 days after CT) revascularization were censored from follow-up thereafter. Major adverse cardiac events consisted of cardiac death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure. Hard events included cardiac death and nonfatal MI. Cardiac death was defined as death caused by acute MI, ventricular arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure. Nonfatal MI was defined as prolonged angina accompanied by new ECG abnormalities and increased cardiac biomarkers. Unstable angina was defined as new-onset, worsening, or rest angina requiring hospital admission.

The effective dose for calcium scoring was <0.5 mSv for all patients. Heart rate increased significantly from 64 AE 11 beats/min at baseline to 76 AE 12 beats/min under stress (p < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly from 131 AE 20 mm Hg at baseline to 116 AE 20 mm Hg during stress (p < 0.001), whereas diastolic blood pressure declined significantly from 67 AE 10 mm Hg to 57 AE 10 mm Hg (p < 0.001). In our population, no patients had any major complications related to stress agent. At CTA acquisition, the mean heart rate was 67 AE 10 beats/min.IMAGING RESULTS. Results for coronary calcium score (CCS), CTA, CTP, and CTDE are presented in OUTCOMES. During a median follow-up of 2.9 years, 43 patients (suspected CAD, n \u00bc 19; known CAD, n \u00bc 24) experienced a MACE: cardiac death: n \u00bc 3, nonfatal MI: n \u00bc 7, unstable angina: n \u00bc 23, and hospitalizations for congestive heart failure: n \u00bc 10.

It is important to note that ISCHEMIA was a randomized trial comparing 2 treatment strategies. It was not a randomized trial comparing particular functional tests (radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance, stress echo, treadmill testing) or anatomic tests (coronary CT angiography, coronary CTA, or invasive angiography). As such, the results cannot and should not be used to alter diagnostic testing strategies for patients with ischemic heart disease.The first approach was the ISCHEMIA trial design. To do so without a firm diagnosis of ischemia will undoubtedly be even more challenging.Furthermore, in most parts of the world, long-term antianginal therapy and revascularization may be not affordable by the patient and the health care system; in these environments, ischemia testing and identification of higher risk can identify need for OMT and/or revascularization. We also recognize that estimation of pre-test probability of obstructive CAD using age, sex, and symptoms and a Bayesian approach remains highly limited, particularly in women; women compared with men age >70 years with typical anginal symptoms have a much lower pre-test probability of obstructive CAD (27% vs. 52%)The third approach of coronary CTA first in all symptomatic patients to exclude left main is also not desirable. Coronary CTA is not able to define whether symptoms are due to ischemia to direct treatment of angina. In the ISCHEMIA trial, only 1% (40 of 3,845) of the randomized patients and 5% of enrolled patients (434 of8,518)  with moderate to severe ischemia demonstrated obstructive LM disease on coronary CTA coronary(23). Of note, in a prior study, a coronary CTA first strategy compared with a functional imaging strategy has been shown to increase downstream coronary angiography and revascularization(30), despite similar clinical outcomes(31). Also,30.5% of patients in the ISCHEMIA trial had prior MI, PCI, or CABG, where ischemia testing is preferred to anatomic testing to guide management. In addition, women with moderate to severe ischemia could be falsely reassured by a coronary CTA first approach.For each of these reasons, for ischemia testing in any given patient, it is critical to establish if symptoms are indeed ischemic in origin as this will drive downstream management decisions. Just as COURAGE(32)    did not change diagnostic strategies or the use of revascularization strategies, likewise, we do not anticipate any major changes in clinical practice going forward following the ISCHEMIA trial.IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASING ISCHEMIA PORTENDS WORSE OUTCOMES STILL A VIABLE CONJECTURE UNDER THE PRESENT SPECTRUM OF MEDICAL THERAPY? Consider the limitations notedTable 1: 1) patient selection (high percentages of patients who present with moderate to severe ischemia were not enrolled in the study); 2) 25% of patients had treadmill testing, which defined 50% of the severe ischemia; 3) lack of comparability between treadmill and other methods; 4) uncertainty regarding whether high-risk features (transient ischemic dilatation, lung uptake, right ventricular uptake, EF, PET flow) were considered; 5) uncertainty regarding the completeness of revascularization; 6) limited use of CABG in patients with diabetes; 7) limited use of CABG in multivessel CAD; and 8) the need for longer-term outcome data. Although it may be tempting to suggest the ISCHEMIA trial refutes the hypothesis that ischemia portends a worse outcome, there are too many such limitations in the ISCHEMIA trial that could have diluted the signal to conclude this. It may also be that the selected cutpoint was not correct and that patients with truly severe ischemia and high-risk features were not included. As we practice now, knowing the results of ISCHEMIA, who among us is willing to manage a patient with angina, with 20% ischemia, transient ischemic dilatation, drop in left ventricular EF, and coronary steal on flow quantification without considering revascularization? Would we consider a next trial to randomize patients with LM disease to OMT versus revascularization, because patients with stable IHD who have LMCA stenosis have extensive ischemia? Does this extensive ischemia not portend a high risk of events? This is not counter to the concept of defining high-risk plaques that require strategies to prevent rupture. These paradigms are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, there is extensive prior published data from observational trials and the FAME trials that continue to support that greater ischemia portends worse outcomes. Long-term outcomes of the ISCHEMIA study and the imaging substudy data will be informative. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR SEARCHING FOR \"SIGNIFICANT STENOSIS\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? There is a relationship between a significant proximal stenosis including LMCA disease and the extent of ischemia, so the noted points remain. Also, as such, there is a role to define a significant stenosis for patients who have angina and moderate to severe ischemic burden. The ISCHEMIA trial does support that revascularization may be considered for relief of angina and to improve quality of life. Patients wanting this approach should have coronary anatomy defined. Such patients could go straight to invasive angiography (which would define LMCA and other high-risk anatomy to direct intervention with PCI or CABG if needed). Likewise, in patients with moderate to severe ischemia and a preference for conservative management, a coronary CTA to exclude LM disease as an explanation for the ischemia may be helpful so symptoms can be attributed to ischemic heart disease and OMT can be instituted and/or optimized. Long-term outcomes of the ISCHEMIA study and the imaging substudy data will be informative in this regard as well.Kirk Garratt, MD, Timothy D. Henry, MD, Sunil V. Rao, MD, Peter L. Duffy, MD, David Cox, MD, Cindy Grines, MD, Ehtisham Mahmud, MD HOW DO THE EXPERTS IN INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY VIEW THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL? On behalf of the interventional cardiology community, SCAI would like to congratulate the investigators of the ISCHEMIA trial. This was a highly anticipated trial that required significant commitment from the investigators. We as interventional cardiologists take great pride in participating and enrolling our patients in this trial to help answer critical questions for the field. The primary result of the trial showing no reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe ischemia and stable CAD with an early invasive/revascularization approach plus guidelinedirected medical therapy (GDMT) over GDMT alone was surprising (1). However, it was noteworthy that the early invasive approach with revascularization (predominantly with PCI) resulted in an improved quality of life (33). Importantly, in patients with stable CAD, the lower risk of future spontaneous MI with early revascularization was a critical observation. On balance, the clinical implications of the trial are nuanced. GDMT is clearly the cornerstone of treatment for stable CAD. The benefit of PCI in reducing angina, improving quality of life, and reducing the future risk of spontaneous MI was gratifying and likely demonstrates a combination of the evolution in interventional technique and technology and in the identification of appropriate patients for PCI.findings of the ISCHEMIA trial suggest that both sides of the COURAGE debate may have been partially correct: GDMT without early intervention is safe, but not superior to intervention. Quality of life is better if PCI is performed early; the more limiting the ischemic symptoms, the greater the benefit. The crossover rate in ISCHEMIA was also remarkable, with many patients randomized to initial GDMT alone receiving invasive care because they had an adverse event (nearly 14% of patients), they failed GDMT (about 4%), or they could not adhere to GDMT (about 8%).Within 4 years, 28% of patients randomized to GDMT alone underwent catheterization, most receiving PCI, whereas just 1% of those initially randomized to GDMT \u00fe PCI underwent additional catheterization.Finally, the lower rate of spontaneous MI rates with early PCI is of clear patient benefit. Interventionalists do not dismiss the concerns about periprocedural MI, but available data suggest that those events are of less clinical significance than spontaneous MI(34). As noted in the original data presentation and subsequent manuscript, the rate of MI in the early invasive arm was increased by periproce-dural events. However, spontaneous MI occurred more frequently in the conservatively treated patients, with the cumulative MI curves crossing at about 2 years and continuing to widen between 2 and 5 years. The effect of an alternative, more sensitive definition of MI was explored (1); although this definition inflated the incident rate of periprocedural MIs and kept the curves from crossing, it did not alter the observation that an initial plan of conservative care was associated with a greater risk of spontaneous MI. The SCAI members support the call for funding to support longer follow-up of the ISCHEMIA trial patients to fully delineate the implications of this observation. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS WILL AFFECT UTILIZATION PATTERNS IN YOUR SPECIALTY? If you look at PCI use over the past 2 decades, it has decreased significantly with approximately one-half as many PCI procedures being performed per 100,000 patients today compared with 15 to 20 years ago (35). In part, this is related to the decreased prevalence of both acute and SIHD (36,37). This has resulted in a lower need for coronary revascularization. Additionally, the use of AUC in clinical practice has resulted in a reduction of inappropriate PCI. The ISCHEMIA trial confirms that the evolution in PCI practice standards, now embedded in quality metrics and physician performance measures, has already been moving in the right direction. It is also important to address patient wishes and incorporate quality of life indexes in clinical decision making. The ISCHEMIA trial helps inform physicians and patients regarding the improvement in both quality of life indexes and reduction in the future risk of spontaneous MI with PCI. This provides 2 tangible benefits of a percutaneous revascularization strategy for patients with stable CAD. Overall, the need for invasive imaging and interventional services will likely decrease over time as improvement in medical therapy and primary prevention strategies for the development of CAD continue. Furthermore, patients presenting with an ACS comprise a significant portion of patients undergoing PCI, and those patients were excluded from the ISCHEMIA trial, as were patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction, class III to IV congestive heart failure or LM disease. Therefore, large changes in clinical interventional practice or revascularization strategies are unlikely as a result of the ISCHEMIA trial. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"STRESS TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? The ISCHEMIA trial did not show that stress testing is overused or unnecessary. It showed that even in the setting of a stable patient with a markedly abnormal stress test, initial GDMT without cardiac catheterization is a safe therapeutic option. However, the stress test was followed by a coronary CT angiogram or prior invasive coronary angiogram to exclude LM disease. Therefore, it would appear that stress testing followed by delineating coronary anatomy are required prior to incorporating the findings of the ISCHEMIA trial in practice. Even then the findings of the ISCHEMIA trial require strict adherence to GDMT, and it is possible that the results of a markedly abnormal stress test might motivate improved medical compliance by some patients. Stress testing is notoriously inaccurate in determining the extent of ischemic burden, but being relatively inexpensive and widely available, it remains a good screening tool. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"ISCHEMIA TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? The results of inducible ischemia are intertwined with stress testing. The identification of stable patients with CAD who can be treated with intense GDMT requires assessment of both inducibility and burden of ischemia. As a key inclusion criterion, the majority of enrolled patients were required to have the presence of moderate to severe ischemia; therefore, it has a prominent role for applying the results of the ISCHEMIA trial in practice.Although almost one-quarter of the patients in the trial were enrolled after stress testing alone, it is difficult to make any definitive statements regarding that strategy alone as the trial is not powered for any subgroup analyses.However, ischemic testing for symptom provocation is highly useful in deciding who will benefit from PCI. In the quality-of-life paper, Spertus et al.(33), reported a gradation of benefit, with the highly symptomatic receiving greatest benefit from early PCI(33). Stratifying patients by severity and frequency of symptoms is suggested by the ISCHEMIA findings.IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASING ISCHEMIA PORTENDS WORSE OUTCOMES STILL A VIABLE CONJECTURE UNDER THE PRESENT SPECTRUM OF MEDICAL THERAPY? Atherosclerosis is responsible for MI and death, but it does not cause harm directly: it causes injury through plaque rupture with thrombotic occlusion and the induction of ischemia. To the degree medical therapy is effective in preventing or stabilizing plaque and relieving ischemic burden, PCI is unnecessary. However, many patients present with advanced CAD requiring revascularization in addition to medical therapy to achieve a desired quality of life (n.b., nearly 1 of 3 patients randomized to conservative care received PCI by the end of the study). The future risk of spontaneous MI was lowered with PCI in ISCHEMIA similar to the FAME studies (38-40), all of which aimed to test the relationship between the relief of ischemia with PCI and outcomes. If medical therapy could be initiated early enough, and coupled with sufficiently healthy lifestyle choices in everyone, the need for revascularization would undoubtedly be much lower. But, studies show that adherence to recommended therapy, even lifesustaining cardiovascular medications prescribed after an acute event, are alarming low among Americans (41). ISCHEMIA reinforced concepts built on earlier FFR studies about the importance of ischemia in predicting benefit from PCI. Interestingly, ISCHEMIA aligned with the FAME studies not just in corroborating the importance of ischemia to predict benefit, but also in suggesting that relief of severe ischemia may be linked to fewer clinical events (38-40). Although cardiovascular death and MI are an important focus, it is worth emphasizing that quality of life is an outcome of great interest to patients; psychosocial studies in highly stressed populations, such as oncology patients, find that quality of life may be more important than life expectancy to some (42). PCI relieves ischemia, improves quality of life, and, based on the findings of the ISCHEMIA trial, appears to offer the additional benefit of lower future risk of spontaneous MI. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR SEARCHING FOR \"SIGNIFICANT STENOSIS\" AND \"FIXING STENOSIS\" IN STABLE CAD, FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? In the context of a discussion about symptomatic CAD, the role of coronary angiography is to identify hemodynamically significant stenoses that are responsible for anginal symptoms not responding to GDMT. Based on the ISCHEMIA trial findings, and in the context of work that came before it, this is appropriate and yields the best clinical outcomes. Countering the \"oculostenotic reflex,\" the root cause of unnecessary and inappropriate PCI (43-45), has been the work of SCAI and others. Interestingly, studies indicate the temptation to provide treatment once a lesion is found-the very problem being sought in the invasive study-is tremendous and often influenced by a desire to provide the greatest benefit to patients as well as by cognitive biases related to distrust of studies like COURAGE (45). Recent administrative efforts to combat this behavior in clinical practice, energized by payment reform, have focused on emphasizing AUC and driving accurate documentation to prove treatment was required. The ISCHEMIA trial has provided reassurance that a conservative care strategy in selected patients is safe and should further help resolve such bias. The SCAI has always stood for the appropriate application of PCI and supports the generation and application of evidence that helps the interventional community make the proper decisions for patients. SCAI opposes the use of PCI or any other potentially harmful therapy when it is unlikely to provide clinical benefit. However, the SCAI stands firmly in support of the value of PCI in safely and reliably relieving anginal symptoms, reducing ischemic burden, and delivering important clinical benefits to patients-not instead of GDMT, but in partnership with it. Our mission as SCAI is \"saving and enhancing lives.\" The ISCHEMIA trial has provided additional evidence that the combination of strategic medical therapeutics and tactical intervention can do exactly that. Ron Blankstein, MD, Leslee J. Shaw, PHD HOW DO THE EXPERTS IN YOUR MODALITY VIEW THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL? Overall, the ISCHEMIA trial is viewed by members of the cardiac computed tomography community as a study which strongly supports the role of coronary CTA in guiding patient management (46). The results, combined with other studies, reinforce the use of coronary CTA as an efficient and cost-effective initial testing option for symptomatic patients who do not have known CAD. There are several reasons why the ISCHEMIA trial results make the use of coronary CTA compelling: ISCHEMIA supports the fact that the vast majority of patients with CAD can be treated with an initial conservative strategy of medical therapy alone. It follows that a test that can directly visualize CADthe disease that we are trying to treat and preventis best suited for identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from medical therapy. The vast majority of symptomatic individuals who are referred for noninvasive imaging do not have obstructive CAD and would never have been eligible for inclusion in ISCHEMIA-a trial that required the presence of obstructive CAD on CTA AND at least moderate ischemia. Because coronary CTA is less costly than other functional imaging tests, and because it can identify nonobstructive plaque, it follows that coronary CTA may be the most efficient test for distinguishing individuals with no CAD from those who have CAD-a subgroup in whom outcomes may be improved with medial therapy. In fact, in the PROMISE study, the majority of cardiac events occurred in patients who had a normal functional study (47). Even for the subgroup of patients who had sufficient ischemia to be included in the ISCHEMIA trial, coronary CTA was useful for excluding LM disease (w5%) or nonobstructive CAD (w14%). Thus, even in the presence of significant ischemia, if a decision is made to pursue medical management alone, coronary CTA should be considered for excluding high-risk anatomy. Conversely, when an invasive strategy with revascularization is being considered, coronary CTA may be helpful for excluding the presence of nonobstructive CAD, thus avoiding the need for coronary angiography. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS WILL AFFECT UTILIZATION PATTERNS IN YOUR MODALITY? We anticipate that the trial results will further strengthen the role of coronary CTA in evaluating patients with suspected CAD. Accordingly, we would expect increased use of this test. However, the magnitude of the increase in use of coronary CTA will depend on other factors, including coverage and reimbursement. At present, payment patterns in the United States may incentivize other testing options as well as the use of invasive procedures. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"STRESS TESTING\" OR \"ISCHEMIA TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? Yes, there certainly remains a role for stress testing following the ISCHEMIA trial results. First, it is evident that some patients cannot undergo coronary CTA, including those with significant tachycardias or contraindications to intravenous contrast. In addition, patients who have known CAD (i.e., multiple stents, extensive coronary calcifications) should be evaluated with functional testing involving other imaging modalities. Although most patients referred for testing in the current era would have been too low risk to be included in ISCHEMIA (i.e., not enough ischemia), there remains a group who were less likely to be randomized as they were too high risk (e.g., significant symptoms, decrease in blood pressure or EF with exercise, high-risk imaging findings). Stress testing remains a useful test to identify such high-risk subgroups in whom the ISCHEMIA trial results may be less generalizable. On the other hand, among symptomatic patients who have multivessel obstructive CAD (either by coronary CTA or on invasive angiography) the use of functional testing may be used to support the decision to pursue medical management. Examples of such reassuring test findings include: 1) exercise treadmill testing with normal hemodynamics and good exercise capacity; 2) PET myocardial perfusion imaging study with normal myocardial blood flow reserve (48); and 3) CT-FFR with normal values (>0.80) (49). Stress testing may also be useful among patients with nonspecific symptoms, if it is unclear whether their symptoms represent angina. In such individuals, exercise testing with or without imaging may be helpful for diagnosing angina. Finally, in symptomatic patients with nonobstructive plaque who have significant symptoms, the use of PET MPI could support the diagnosis of microvascular dysfunction (50). Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether patient management based on such findings could improve outcomes. IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASING ISCHEMIA PORTENDS WORSE OUTCOMES STILL A VIABLE CONJECTURE UNDER THE PRESENT SPECTRUM OF MEDICAL THERAPY? Although there was no significant gradient between level of ischemia and adverse outcomes observed in the ISCHEMIA trial, data from multiple prior registries have supported the fact that the severity of ischemia is associated with worse out-comes. This is certainly a plausible hypothesis as patients with more ischemia are more likely to have more advanced CAD, including more severe stenosis and more extensive CAD. However, it is unclear if the higher event rate that has been observed in such patients is due to the fact that they have more severe coronary stenosis and more extensive plaque-and thus potentially unstable lesions-or if the high risk is a direct result of poor tissue perfusion and is not necessarily due to underlying plaque. In other words, one could ask: is it ischemia that really matters for identifying and treating risk, with plaque just being a bystander, or is it plaque that matters most, with ischemia serving as a marker for identifying it?Regardless of the underlying mechanism relating ischemia and adverse outcomes, the major contribution of the ISCHEMIA trial is that the increased risk of patients with moderate or severe ischemia who met the inclusion criteria was not modified by whether or not they underwent an initial invasive strategy with coronary revascularization, when feasible, versus an initial conservative strategy with medical therapy alone.FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? The ISCHEMIA trial has proved that contemporary medical therapy is highly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Yet, it is important to recognize that the risk associated with coronary atherosclerosis may be due to the overall amount and extent of underlying coronary plaque rather than whether there is a \"significant stenosis.\" The identification of stenosis certainly contributes to risk assessment, but may be most relevant when assessing the feasibility of coronary revascularization, and when trying to determine if revascularization would provide improvement in symptoms. Although lesions that have more severe stenosis are more likely to be flow limiting, it is well recognized that in many cases coronary anatomy may be insufficient for determining if a lesion is flow limiting. Based on the ISCHEMIA trial results, knowing this information may not always be necessary. However, in patients who have frequent angina despite aggressive medial therapy, the decision to proceed with revascularization may depend on whether a lesion is flow limiting-a question that may need further invasive or noninvasive testing to answer.

Greenwood, MBCHB, PHD, Colin Berry, PHD, Subha V Raman, MD, James Carr, MD, Eike Nagel, MD, Andrew E. Arai, MD The SCMR welcomes the opportunity to comment on the results of the important ISCHEMIA trial. The SCMR is the leading international independent organization in the field of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with a mission to improve cardiovascular health by advancing the field of CMR. The SCMR is a multidisciplinary society; our physician members include cardiologists and radiologists involved in the care of patients with all aspects of cardiovascular disease, and many are experts in a range of imaging modalities and trials. SCMR and its members embrace a multimodality approach in which all imaging modalities, including CMR, are used appropriately based on best available evidence. The SCMR perspective on the ISCHEMIA trial has been compiled in this spirit. HOW DO THE EXPERTS IN YOUR MODALITY VIEW THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL? General considerations. The ISCHEMIA trial of a routine invasive strategy versus a conservative strategy without initial invasive management is a landmark study that will affect clinical practice. The trial was a prodigious effort by the investigators, research staff, and the participants, and they deserve great credit from delivering this trial. ISCHEMIA was designed to determine whether an invasive strategy is superior to noninvasive management of stable angina. Guideline-directed medical management was recommended for all of the trial participants. The trial builds on the evidence from previous revascularization strategy trials such as COURAGE (51) and BARI 2D (52). In COURAGE, PCI as an initial management strategy in patients with stable CAD, did not reduce the risk of death, MI, or other major cardiovascular events when added to OMT. In BARI 2D, an early strategy of revascularization in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart disease offered no improved outcome compared to medical therapy. The main finding of ISCHEMIA was that routine invasive management does not reduce major adverse cardiac events compared with OMT in patients with stable CAD and moderate to severe ischemia on noninvasive stress testing. ISCHEMIA excluded many of the high-risk patients such as those with LM disease, low EF or heart failure, and recent acute coronary syndromes. In addition to the primary result that there was no improvement in adverse cardiovascular events from an early invasive strategy over an initial medical therapy strategy in patients with moderate-severe myocardial ischemia, the quality of life substudy demonstrated that invasive assessment and revascularization did improve symptoms in patients with persisting angina despite GDMT. Noninvasive imaging in ISCHEMIA. In the ISCHEMIA trial, noninvasive imaging was included in the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify patients with CAD and at least moderate ischemia. However, evaluating noninvasive imaging strategies was not part of the research question of the ISCHEMIA and the trial did not assess outcomes as a function of ischemia testing. Its results should therefore not be extrapolated to the role of stress testing in patients with stable angina or to compare stress testing with anatomic imaging. ISCHEMIA in the context of other trials. Although some might advocate that ISCHEMIA complements other imaging strategy trials such as PROMISE (31) and SCOT-HEART (10), the ISCHEMIA trial is fundamentally different in that it was answering a specific question of treatment strategy in a very focused group of patients: those with at least moderate ischemia with evidence of obstructive CAD by coronary CTA who were free of LM disease by CTA. The presence of significant ischemia by noninvasive testing was an inclusion criterion in ISCHEMIA. In symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, PROMISE demonstrated that an anatomic strategy with coronary CTA did not improve outcome over a median follow-up of 2 years compared with a functional testing strategy, despite more revascularization in the anatomic arm. Functional testing in PROMISE did not include CMR and results should not be extrapolated to other modalities than those used in the trial.In SCOT-HEART, patients with stable chest pain underwent routine clinical assessment, which included a symptom-limited exercise ECG study in 63% of the participants before randomization to standard care or coronary CTA in addition to standard care (exercise treadmill testing). Although the primary outcome of the trial with 1.7-year median follow-up did not demonstrate a significant reduction of adverse cardiovascular events, the 5-year followup of the trial demonstrated that patients in the computed tomography arm experienced a significantly lower rate of death from CAD or nonfatal MI at 5 years than standard care alone, without a significantly higher rate of coronary angiography or coronary revascularization. Of note, with a study design of \"test\" versus \"no test\" as in SCOT-HEART, any imaging test strategy in the active arm versus no test would likely lead to patients benefit. Interestingly though in SCOT-HEART, the coronary CTA arm was associated with less improvement in physical limitation, angina frequency, and quality of life compared with standard care(53).The MR-INFORM (Myocardial Perfusion Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance versus Angiography and Fractional Flow Reserve to Guide the Management of Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease) (54) trial compared a stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) management strategy with FFR-guided management of patients with typical angina and either 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors or a positive exercise treadmill test. The trial included >20% of patients with known CAD. The CMR strategy was shown to safely guide patient management and reduce the number of invasive angiograms and coronary revascularization with minimal cross over in patients with intermediate to high pre-test likelihood compared with an invasive angiogram AE FFR strategy. Of note, an excellent reduction of angina was achieved using a CMR strategy. Methodological considerations. Group comparisons in ISCHEMIA were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The results show that there was a large cross-over between trial arms, with 26% of patients in the medical therapy group undergoing angiography and 21% undergoing revascularization, thus blunting any potential treatment effect of revascularization. It is noted though that 19% of these patients underwent angiography and 15% underwent revascularization before the occurrence of the primary outcome event.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF97": {"text": "results of the ISCHEMIA trial suggest that coronary CTA should be performed as the first-line strategy in most patients with chest pain, regardless of pre-test likelihood of CAD without demonstration of ischemia. In ISCHEMIA, coronary CTA was performed to confirm the presence of obstructive CAD in patients with at least moderate ischemia, and to exclude significant LM disease, which was a defined exclusion criterion of the study. Due to selection bias, the prevalence of LM disease in ISCHEMIA was up to 5%, whereas in the all-comers population the prevalence of LM disease is only 1-2% as reported in SCOT-HEART. Advocating that coronary CTA should be performed at a population level where the prevalence of LM disease is much lower has the potential of exposing a significant number of patients to ionizing radiation, when alternative options with functional imaging are available. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS WILL AFFECT UTILIZATION PATTERNS IN YOUR MODALITY? CMR provides a comprehensive examination with multiple components, from ischemia assessment to viability, noninvasive myocardial tissue characterization in a range of cardiomyopathic processes, accurate volumetric assessment of the left and right ventricles, as well as robust intracardiac shunt and vascular flow assessment. The imaging protocol is tailored to the clinical request and underlying condition and stress CMR is only 1 of the many investigations that can be performed with CMR.As the guideline-supported indications of CMR continue to grow in both acquired and congenital heart disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathies, pericardial, valvular disease, and angiography, an overall reduction in the use pattern based on the ISCHEMIA trial is not expected.Stress CMR is comparatively widely used in some countries such as the United Kingdom, whereas in other countries, including the United States, its use remains low. The low-level adoption of stress CMR in the United States and other countries is due to a combination of relative limited expertise, limited cardiac magnetic resonance scanner availability for stress CMR and greater availability of other stress modalities, limited awareness in referring physicians about the potential of this novel technique, as well as unfavorable reimbursement. This is despite the accumulation of a wealth of contemporary robust clinical evidence on diagnostic accuracy data (55-57), prognostic utility, and noninferiority versus invasive management strategy test (54). Moreover, the SCMRsupported SPINS (Stress Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Perfusion Imaging in the United States) trial has shown that ischemia testing by CMR is costeffective (13,58) (less costly and less downstream testing) in the United States compared with other imaging modalities. We believe that with the sustained effort from our Society and the current body of evidence supportive of the use of stress CMR in patients with chest pain syndromes, a gradual increase in the uptake of stress CMR will be observed. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"STRESS TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? ISCHEMIA was a trial comparing treatment strategies, not diagnostic strategies. Although the amount of stress testing may decrease following ISCHEMIA, significant changes in practice regarding stress are unlikely to occur. Patients will continue to present with chest pain, with a need to determine whether their symptoms are attributable to myocardial ischemia. Stress testing is recognized in all major clinical guidelines as an appropriate test for diagnosing CAD. PROMISE is the more appropriate clinical trial to frame questions about anatomic detection of CAD versus stress testing detection of CAD. In the PROMISE trial, coronary CTA did not improve outcome of patients compared with a heterogeneous stress test strategy, which included exercise treadmill testing.Anatomic testing with coronary CTA is an important tool for diagnosing patients with CAD, but alone it does not provide information about the functional significance of the disease, which has been shown in trials such as FAME(25)  to result in better decisionmaking regarding revascularization. Furthermore, even if an anatomic strategy is adopted, there will continue to be a need for ischemia testing when patients fail medical therapy and may need to be considered for revascularization.Three important aspects need to be considered.First, ischemia remains an important predictor of outcome and knowledge about the extent and severity allows guiding risk-modifying therapy. Second, revascularization should not be performed without proof of ischemia. Thus, stress testing remains an important part of the armamentarium. Third, anatomic imaging provides no specific information regarding vascular function at the epicardial or microvascular levels. When coronary CTA excludes obstructive epicardial CAD, patients with microvascular angina or vasospastic angina may receive false reassurance, including discontinuation of therapy. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"ISCHEMIA TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? Yes, there is still a need for ischemia testing.It is likely that the results of the ISCHEMIA trial will support further adherence to AUC and a reduction of inappropriate stress testing, which will be beneficial to both patients and the health care system.As observed in the United Kingdom, we predict an increase in uptake of stress CMR in view of the recent robust evidence of high diagnostic and prognostic Also, sometimes it might take more than 1 trial to change practice, particularly when it involves mainstream cardiology practice. The STICH trial was alsoexpected to reduce the indication for myocardial viability testing to guide coronary revascularization, but in clinical practice, these tests are still used in appropriate settings. Similarly, despite the results of COURAGE, the rate of PCI in stable CAD was not drastically reduced. In the United Kingdom, despite the 2016 NICE guidelines recommendation to use coronary CTA as a first-line investigation in patients with typical or atypical chest pain across all pre-test likelihoods of disease, a significant volume of ischemia testing is still undertaken in the United Kingdom. In fact, in the last 4 years there has been a significant rise of stress CMR testing, largely resulting from a reduction in the use of other noninvasive imaging modalities. There is an increasing awareness that myocardial ischemia and unobstructed coronary arteries (INOCA) is more prevalent than what the cardiology community has previously considered, particularly in women. Microvascular dysfunction is the hallmark of this condition, and it can be well identified noninvasively by quantitative stress CMR (59) and PET (60), or with invasive physiological assessment. The results of the ISCHEMIA trial do not directly pertain to the INOCA population in whom ischemia testing will continue to be pivotal. It is also important to consider that anatomic imaging favors a positive diagnosis in men (higher prevalence of obstructive CAD) with the risk of providing a false negative diagnosis in women, in whom there is a higher prevalence of INOCA. A population-level strategy exclusively with anatomic imaging with coronary CTA can potentially increase the already prevalent sex bias in cardiology practice. Anatomic and functional imaging are therefore complementary. The ISCHEMIA team should be congratulated on a secondary analysis of the ISCHEMIA trial that highlights that women had more frequent angina, independent of less extensive CAD, and less severe ischemia than men (61). IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASING ISCHEMIA PORTENDS WORSE OUTCOMES STILL A VIABLE CONJECTURE UNDER THE PRESENT SPECTRUM OF MEDICAL THERAPY? Yes. The ISCHEMIA trial was not designed to assess the clinical impact of noninvasive imaging. It demonstrated that OMT as an initial treatment strategy, compared with an early invasive strategy, in patients with moderate to severe ischemia by noninvasive testing is a viable option. By only studying patients with moderate to severe ischemia, the ISCHEMIA trial does not provide an assessment of outcomes as a function of ischemic burden. The study only assesses whether treatment with GDMT reduces adverse outcomes compared with invasive therapy. Furthermore, the ISCHEMIA trial population did not include patients with New York Heart Association functional class III to IV, unacceptable angina despite medical therapy, EF <35%, ACS within 2 months, PCI or CABG within 1 year, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min or on dialysis; overall, this is not a negligible number of patients. The role of treatment strategy in these patients is not assessed in the ISCHEMIA trial. As a consequence of the trial design, ISCHEMIA had a relatively low combined cardiovascular event rate and an even lower rate of hard events. Stress CMR is well suited to studying all of these categories of patients and, although less frequently used, can diagnose ischemia and assess function and viability in patients with chronic kidney disease through dobutamine stress testing. PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS?Yes, provided the patient has angina. As mentioned in the previous text, the interpretation of ISCHEMIA should focus on the evidence from this randomized controlled trial, rather than extrapolation around anatomic versus functional ischemia testing.In conclusion, the SCMR's key points are:1. ISCHEMIA is a trial of initial invasive assessment and revascularization versus conservative, noninvasive management. 2. ISCHEMIA is not a trial of imaging approaches to diagnosis. 3. Enrollment into ISCHEMIA was refined by coronary CTA to exclude LM disease. 4. ISCHEMIA is limited to a minority of all-comers with moderate to severe ischemia, a determination made by ischemia testing, not coronary CTA, and not by invasive FFR. 5. PROMISE is the most appropriate study to address coronary CTA versus ischemia testing but probably should not be extrapolated to individual functional modalities. 6. PROMISE did not show a benefit at 2 years of coronary CTA versus ischemia testing. 7. Ischemia testing is recognized by all major guidelines for assessing symptoms that may be related to CAD and will continue to be used. 8. The MR-INFORM trial, the wealth of published data, and guidelines are the strongest pieces of evidence favoring increasing use of CMR. 9. The recent SCMR registry study (SPINS) demonstrated the diagnostic and cost-effective value of CMR in the United States. 10. Stress CMR stress is increasing in the United Kingdom despite the NICE guidelines. Venkatesh L. Murthy, MD, PHD, Terrence D. Ruddy, MD, Vasken Dilsizian, MD, on behalf of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Cardiovascular Council HOW DO THE EXPERTS IN YOUR MODALITY VIEW THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL? The ISCHEMIA trial is an important and groundbreaking randomized trial designed to test the hypothesis that revascularization of moderate to severe ischemia on noninvasive testing is associated with better outcomes than OMT alone. The investigators deserve much credit for completing this large and complex trial. There were many compromises made in the interest of completing the study. The most serious limitation of the study is that only a minority of patients had severe ischemia on nuclear imaging. Many patients had ischemia involving <15% of the left ventricle-a level where even observational data suggest no convincing benefit to revascularization. Furthermore, many patients either did not have imaging or had imaging with modalities that had no prior studies relating quantitative measures of Most critically, the ISCHEMIA trial did show that there is a symptomatic benefit from revascularization of patients with ischemia, which was more meaningful than seen in the COURAGE trial. Combined with data from ORBITA (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with Optimal Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina), these observations suggest that demonstration of ischemia may be critically important when selecting patients who will have symptom relief from revascularization. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS WILL AFFECT UTILIZATION PATTERNS IN YOUR MODALITY? There is no doubt that the ISCHEMIA trial, combined with other seminal studies such as COURAGE, BARI 2D, and CARP (Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis), will result in reduced use of noninvasive testing for CAD. These studies have collectively shown that revascularization in patients with $70% stenosis in at least 1 major epicardial coronary artery and without >50% LM coronary stenosis does not improve hard outcomes beyond OMT. These principles are already found in AUC, although there will be need for further refinement of these in the future. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"STRESS TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? Based on a large body of published data, we believe the role of stress testing without imaging is limited, and this role will be even more so following publication of the ISCHEMIA trial. The diagnostic accuracy of stress ECG without imaging for CAD is limited, and as such, it should not be a preferred test for CAD. Nonetheless, the prognostic value of the test may be useful in limited circumstances. Assessment of peak exercise oxygen consumption is useful in assessment of patients with heart failure. Additionally, evaluation of ECG response to exercise may have importance in selected patients with arrhythmia syndromes. Unfortunately, approximately 1 of 4 patients in the ISCHEMIA were enrolled based on stress ECG without imaging. Furthermore, we know of no prior data identifying a clinical benefit from revascularization of patients with the specific ECG abnormalities used in the ISCHEMIA trial inclusion trial. IS THERE STILL A PROMINENT ROLE FOR \"ISCHEMIA TESTING\" FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? YES. Why do you say so? First, in symptomatic patients, there is value in confirming a clinical diagnosis to explain what may be quality-of-life-limiting symptoms. Second, identification of patients who may have symptomatic benefit from revascularization is another important role. Simply having angina and anatomic stenosis is insufficient to identify a population for whom revascularization improves quality of life, as elegantly demonstrated in the ORBITA trial. Furthermore, microvascular dysfunction, diffuse disease, and endothelial dysfunction can lead to stress induced abnormalities of myocardial perfusion, which are increasingly recognized as an important cause of chest pain symptoms and yet cannot be diagnosed with anatomic testing. Finally, there have been no high-quality studies comparing nuclear stress functional testing to anatomic testing showing a difference in outcomes in favor of coronary CTA. Indeed, anatomic testing as an initial strategy has been consistently associated with increased invasive catheterization and revascularization. How do you see it being deployed in clinical practice going forward? It is likely that the use of noninvasive cardiac testing for lower-risk patients and those with no or atypical symptoms will continue to decline. However, patients with established CAD, those without established CAD but typical symptoms and/or significant clinical risk factors, and those with persistent symptoms despite medical therapy will continue to benefit from nuclear stress testing. IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASING ISCHEMIA PORTENDS WORSE OUTCOMES STILL A VIABLE CONJECTURE UNDER THE PRESENT SPECTRUM OF MEDICAL THERAPY? There is no doubt that myocardial ischemia is prognostic for adverse outcomes. This has been established in hundreds of thousands of patients across many different types of equipment, stressors, imaging protocols, and clinical sites. Modern studies continue to demonstrate that this relationship holds and is strong. Whether revascularization of ischemia reduces that risk may depend on multiple factors, including extent of ischemia, symptoms, risk factors and coronary anatomy. PUBLICATION OF THE ISCHEMIA TRIAL RESULTS? The ORBITA trial has demonstrated that stenosis severity and invasive indexes showing pressure decreases across epicardial stenoses are not correlated with symptomatic relief from revascularization. Conversely, symptom improvement was noted in the ISCHEMIA trial, albeit without placebo control, and among the ORBITA participants with noninvasively demonstrated ischemia. These randomized clinical data confirm a large body of evidence that has shown the \"significance\" of an epicardial stenosis is highly variable depending on factors such as microvascular health. Collectively, these data suggest that use of anatomy as a gold and single standard for selection of which patients will have symptom relief from revascularization will be suboptimal. ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Y. Chandrashekhar, Division of Cardiology, University of Minnesota/VA Medical Center, 1 Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55417. E-mail: shekh003@ umn.edu. I n the pre-coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) era, on any given day in the United States, thousands of patients required not only clinic visits but also a multitude of imaging and other diagnostic services for confirmatory diagnoses, assessments of their clinical courses, or planning of therapeutic interventions. During that time, cardiovascular imagers have had to balance their responsibilities among imaging laboratories, patient care, teaching house staff, and other clinical and administrative duties. This encapsulated cardiovascular imagers' lives, and in the last few months, it all has changed! In unimaginable ways, our lives and those of all others have been disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Each of our respective cities represents \"hot zones\" for the virus. Our health systems have transformed into acute care hospitals, often overflowing beyond capacity and overwhelmed by the severity of illness and frequent specter of death. For some cities, like New York City and New Orleans, it seemed instantaneous that our centers were inundated with critically ill COVID-19 patients, nearly exhausting supplies of needed medical equipment and placing an enormous burden on all medical staff. While other cities, such as Boston and Detroit, had a delayed onset of the pandemic, which provided time for planning and execution of a response. In all, the COVID-19 outbreak dramatically impacted all of our medical centers. As our hospitals have been dramatically repurposed to care for COVID-19 patients, our lives as cardiovascular imagers and researchers have been put \"on pause,\" causing considerable uncertainty about the future of our specialty. Will we regain the imaging volumes that largely included elective procedures?", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF98": {"text": "Throughout the pandemic, the loss of our normal activities as clinicians created a vacuum and heightened the anxiety regarding the future of medicine. For researchers, all activities outside of critical care investigation are on hold, leaving concerns regarding the tremendous loss in investigative momentum, the timely completion of projects, and the potential cancellations of funded research activities. Grant timelines and timesensitive research costs place further effects on the stress of researchers. In some cases, the rapid transformation of hospitals required imagers to promptly pivot to new and often foreign services to aid in the care of COVID-19 patients. Some imagers have been deployed outside of cardiology into various clinical duties including workforce health services, fever clinics, intensive care units, and medical wards caring for patients infected with COVID-19. In this \"all hands on deck\" approach, we all came together to provide patient care that we learned largely during medical school. Some institutions preferred to redeploy only clinicians with more recent training in general internal medicine, whereas other health systems retrained physicians, with some imagers finding themselves in the throes of an overwhelmed emergency department or intensive care unit. Often, physicians were required to rapidly learn the standards of care for COVID-19 patients, with its many evolving therapeutic approaches and without a deepened understanding of this or other viruses, as is the case for cardiovascular care. This further added to the everyday stress of \"leaving\" cardiology to serve a role for which we were not formally trained. At the same time, we are in awe of all our colleagues (including nurses, respiratory therapists, and many others) who have risen to this challenge to take care of each person, providing the best care during this unprecedented time. Some cardiology care was provided in a limited direct manner but largely through telehealth services; albeit not all patients have this capability. Not being able to review vital signs, listen to a murmur, or examine an electrocardiogram puts constraints on what a cardiovascular specialist can do remotely. It is challenging to gauge a patient's level of symptom instability or clinical worsening through remote interaction, often staccato in course, and without our usual tools available in the outpatient clinic. TheseFIGURE 1 Changes in Testing Volume From Conventional Utilization to Testing of COVID-19 Patients These data are based on an aggregate response from all participating health care systems.

Many cardiovascular imagers struggled to find solutions as to what if any imaging modality would yield informative findings across the diverse cardiovascular differential including causes of arrhythmia, ischemia, thromboembolism, or heart failure. A smattering of procedures were done, including stress testing to assess chest pain, cardiac magnetic resonance to assess myocarditis, and coronary computed tomographic angiography in the paconvalescent chest pain (Figure 1). However, the most common indication for imaging a COVID-19 patient was the use of a focused (not comprehensive) echocardiogram for assessment of biventricular (global and regional) function, chest pain, or dyspnea. Across institutions, the use of imaging varied widely and largely depending on expertise. The lack of uniformity in practices left sizeable gaps in our knowledge about pathophysiology and further questions about the appropriateness of imaging in the COVID setting.In many cases, we devised our own evaluation algorithms with the imaging societal guidelines helpful but often published after our own institutions cared for hundreds if not thousands of COVID-19 patients.In many instances, we learned novel imaging approaches and clinical insights, shared with others on social media and other online interactive platforms.The necessity for imaging the COVID-19 patient prompted major concerns regarding safety and potential exposure to all laboratory staff and clinicians. This is especially so for imaging procedures such as transesophageal echocardiography, with a high potential for aerosolization of the virus. For this and other procedures (such as exercise testing) came appropriate concern over staff exposure and transmission of the virus. This apprehension was exacerbated given the shortages of personal protective equipment initially unavailable for staff in imaging laboratories.Safety concerns were even more worrisome with bedside echocardiography, given the proximity of the sonographer to a patient. As such, we spent considerable time developing novel imaging protocols to shorten imaging time, limiting staff exposure to infectious patients, and providing rapid sterilization of imaging equipment and facilities. Although this may seem simple, no level of detail could be overlooked, including air circulation times in the imaging laboratories or at the patient's bedside. There always seemed to be some level of detail initially overlooked that became critical to create an optimal safe environment for all health care workers.Safety concern also extended to our imaging trainees, who found themselves in the trenches practicing ventilator management and critical care.Many of them, both dedicated imaging and senior cardiology fellows, who allocated much of this year to acquiring critical imaging skills necessary for their professional growth, are in danger of not achieving the usual milestones necessary for completing their fellowships, although relaxation of training criteria is being considered by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Many trainees from outside the United States were asked to promptly return to their home countries, often at the request of their governments, with likely numerous challenges to returning. The interruption in their training and disruption in their specialty goals further adds to the emotional burden related to the outbreak. As we now strategize about reopening, our attention is increasingly shifted toward a safe reintroduction of cardiovascular services. Such planning involves multiple levels of complexities and unknown factors regarding the optimal approach for universal or selected COVID-19 screening of candidates for cardiovascular imaging. Ideally, all of this information would be known before the patient arrives to our imaging facility. Questions arise as to whether reconfiguring waiting rooms and other measures of physical distancing or universal masking will be enough; and can we maintain an adequate supply of personal protective equipment as we start to perform procedures with a moderate risk of viral aerosolization, such as exercise testing? We also now approach the use of cardiovascular imaging differently and often consider its necessity or how much testing is really needed to care for a patient. Thus, issues of appropriateness combined with streamlined, focused protocols are very much at the forefront of our strategies for reopening. Reservations persist about the use of certain procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography, with high risk of exposure for medical staff and consideration of replacement procedures with an improved safety profile (e.g., cardiac computed tomography versus transesophageal echocardiography for the evaluation of endocarditis). A final challenge is communicating all this information to our colleagues and patients, assuring them that we are working diligently to reopen our imaging laboratories with a primary focus on safety for all patients and staff.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF100": {"text": "backs or potential furloughs, salary reductions, redeployment to new areas in medicine, and the shutting down of our research laboratories. Although this is a personal account of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular imagers, our current environment is saturated with an emotional toll on the medical staff, families, public health officials, and the general community, especially the fear within vulnerable communities at high risk for the virus. The COVID-19 infection hit our hospitals at a time when cardiovascular services, particularly imaging, were dealt harsh cuts in reimbursement. In many ways, the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded a very challenging imaging environment leaving even more instability regarding its future. Yet, in the midst of all of this, we impatiently await for all of this to pass and look ahead to the post-COVID-19 storm. We must remind ourselves that many cardiology patients left unattended will require more intense care for critical aortic stenosis, heart failure, and chronic coronary disease. We also do not yet realize the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Millions of patients have had their imaging procedures and directed care interrupted. How will we care for the millions of patients who had cardiovascular care deferred remains unknown, but we are eager to put as many pieces of our lives back together as is possible. It is impossible to tell what the new normal will look like, but one thing is clear, ahead is a long road of learning, adapting, and collaborating as we inch beyond the flattening curve.

Ischemic Heart Disease Diagnostic Costs With Treadmill Stress CMR Versus SPECT A Multicenter, Randomized Trial Vasodilator stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) offers superior accuracy over single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (1); however, pharmacological stress cannot reproduce exertional symptoms or signs. We have shown that MRcompatible treadmill stress with CMR offers excellent diagnostic performance versus SPECT (2). We compared exercise CMR and SPECT costs for evaluation of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in the randomized EXACT-COST trial (Comparative Effectiveness of Stress Tests; NCT01875315). Adults referred for treadmill stress SPECT were enrolled across 4 centers: men age 30 years or older with chest pain and/or equivalents; women with diabetes age older than 30 years and all women age 40 years or older with chest pain and/or equivalents; and subjects with known coronary artery disease. Subjects with contraindication to CMR or exercise stress were excluded (3). Subjects provided written informed consent to participate in this protocol, which was approved across research committees. Subjects randomized to SPECT underwent resting myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) followed by standard Bruce protocol stress and stress MPI. Those randomized to stress CMR had resting cine images and then standard Bruce protocol stress. Acquisition of free-breathing cine and perfusion imaging commenced 26.5 AE 7.8 s post-stress followed by recovery monitoring, resting perfusion, and late gadophysicians received standardized reports in both arms that detailed exercise, symptoms, electrocardiography, and imaging findings.

A linear mixed-effects model fit by restricted maximum likelihood was used to assess the impact of the modality on total cost adjusted for: participating center; age; sex; race; hypertension; diabetes; current smoking; test result; and baseline medications.

Empirical optimal cutoff points for these variables for VT were identified through receiver operator characteristics analyses (Liu method) and sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve determined (Figure 1). logistic regression showed lateral wall PSI $4.5% and BE to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Our observations indicate that mean Pickelhaube spike, BE, and basal and midlateral wall PSI tend to be higher in patients with malignant arrhythmogenic MBMVP. The Pickelhaube sign represents a marker of myocardial stretch caused by tugging of prolapsing mitral leaflets in systole on papillary muscles and adjacent myocardium, thus altering myocardial deformation in these segments (PSI). In contradistinction to a previous report of CMR LGE (LV fibrosis) in MBMVP syndrome (1), we found CMR evidence of LGE in only 33% of patients. This may be because fibrosis occurs at a later stage in the disease. Thus, tissue Doppler and STE can identify patients at risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in MBMVP earlier, before development of fibrosis. Muthukumar, MD Arshad Jahangir, MD M.

Yet, aggregate CMR data, without adjustment for sex or age, are now used for risk stratification and to guide timing for intervention in select CHD populations. In those with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF), CMR data provide a cornerstone for management that is virtually unparalleled in other forms of heart diseasedcongenital or acquired. Although an understanding of the range of CMR values in patients with rTOF is essential because this information may direct clinical care, little has been published on this topic to date. Therefore, in this study, we examined crosssectional CMR measurements, stratified by age and sex, in a large, multinational cohort of patients with rTOF and significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR). Children and adults with rTOF, at least moderate PR and a contemporary CMR examination were prospectively recruited in Canada, Europe, and Asia as part of the CORRELATE (Comprehensive Outcomes Registry Late After Tetralogy of Fallot Repair) study. Those with a bioprosthetic pulmonary valve (PV) were excluded. Institutional review board approval was obtained from each participating site. Participants provided written informed consent. Subjects were divided into quartiles by age: younger than 18 years; 18 to 24 years; 25 to 39 years; and 40 or older years. An experienced central reader blinded to clinical data completed all CMR analyses. Our CMR methods were previously published (1).

Among 12 patients that were selected at random for intrareader agreement, ICC were between 0.79 to 0.99 for all parameters, indicating excellent agreement. Comparison of FeMRA with CTA showed no significant difference in arterial diameter and area of calcification (mean differences \u00c00.36 to 0.89 mm and \u00c00.05 to 0.06 mm 2 , respectively), but there was significant systematic difference in vein diameter (mean difference 1.53 to 2.44 mm). Contrast-to-noise ratio values were significantly higher in FeMRA in both the arterial and venous vasculature (mean differences 3.16 to 7.44 and 16.78 to 24.70, respectively). We have demonstrated a cardiac magnetic resonance strategy for kidney transplant candidates that provides reliable depiction of arterial lumen, accurate detection of arterial calcification, and synchronous delineation of the venous vasculature. In addition, the favorable pharmacokinetics of ferumoxytol allow imaging of pre-dialysis patients without concerns for iodine or gadolinium contrast toxicity. From a clinical standpoint, FeMRA can complement or even replace currently used imaging methods in pre-transplant assessment of CKD patients with known or suspected PAD. Our study has limitations. Arterial-phase CTA combined with computed tomography venography was not performed, but this requires higher doses of iodine contrast, venous opacification can be suboptimal, and acquisition times vary considerably. This limits conclusions that can be drawn about venous anatomy in this study to some degree. In the steady state, ferumoxytol enhances arteries and veins equally and independently of bolus timing; however, this attribute did not compromise diagnosis, as the arteries and veins of the abdomen and pelvis were readily distinguishable. Ferumoxytol is not currently licensed as a contrast agent for cardiac magnetic resonance and its commercial price (approximately $700 per 17 ml vial) is not realistic for a routine deployment, limiting translation of our study protocol to clinical practice. However, its applicability in pre-dialysis patients fills an unmet clinical need, offering a safe and robust technique decisive to timely transplant listing.been developed to make IVOCT interpretation more reliable and rapid, none are founded on histological validation (1,2). Our aim is to demonstrate feasibility of a histology-validated virtual histology OCT (VH-OCT) algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI). Our AI algorithm classifies IVOCT image features with high accuracy into fibrous, calcium, and lipid components, as well as morphological categories, including fibrocalcific, pathological intimal thickening, thickcapped fibroatheroma (ThCFA), and TCFA. Coronary arteries were obtained from organ donors, imaged with IVOCT, and processed with histology (hematoxylin and eosin). Seventy-six coronary arteries were imaged with St. Jude ILUMIEN (St. Jude Medical, Little Canada, Minnesota) and Volcano CorVue IVOCT (Volcano Corporation, San Diego, California) systems. Images were co-registered to histology and manually segmented into tissue types by 2 expert IVOCT readers (T.H. and D.V.) and 2 cardiovascular pathologists (D.V. and M.B.) with guidance from histology. From this ground truth dataset, 200 training frames were randomly selected for constructing the algorithm, and 200 testing frames were randomly selected for AI algorithm evaluation. Before building the algorithm, image data were first converted into logarithmic and attenuation scales (3). For both image types, a small sub-window was passed over every tissue point in each sampled frame, and statistical features were computed, including intensity values and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features that captured the image textural character. In addition to this regional information, axial features were computed from individual scan lines that radiated out from the center of the IVOCT image. An array of neural networks was trained and optimized with feature data and then applied to the testing set.For fibrous, lipid, and calcium sensitivities were 87%, 86%, and 85%, respectively, and specificities were 80%, 80%, and 87%, respectively. After automatically colorizing these plaque components in IVOCT images, each colorized image was further classified by morphological type. As graded against the pathologists' classification of the corresponding histology, accuracies for fibrocalcific plaque, pathological intimal thickening, and fibroatheroma were 72%, 83%, and 72%, respectively.

The patient was medically treated with a progressive clinical improvement. The Lombardy region in northern Italy is one of the areas with the highest number of patients with COVID-19. Comparing the period between February 15 and March 20, 2020, with the same period last year, we observed a significant increase of ACS with no obstructive coronary artery disease (27% vs. 4%; p < 0.01). Recent reports suggest that acute cardiac injury is present in approximately 7% of patients with COVID-19 and may be related to myocarditis. Although CMR is known to be highly effective in identifying the underlying diagnosis beyond myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries, some concerns related to equipment and room disinfection should be considered in patients with COVID-19. Recently, cardiac CT (CCT) has shown the ability to detect myocardial damage (2,3) through late iodine-enhanced scans. A lesson from this case is that in these patients with equivocal ACS presentation who are hemodynamically stable, CCT could be considered to rule out coronary artery disease as an alternative to ICA. Moreover, additional information to rule out interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF110": {"text": "). The authors confirmed that impaired RVLS was associated with the mortality, but 3 key issues deserve further consideration.First, a confounding bias. Right ventricular(RV)    function is closely linked with afterload. The same is applicable for RVLS, which is modulated by afterload.Although RV dysfunction can be induced by direct COVID-19 damage, a more likely scenario is that it results from severe lung damage, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. As the authors showed, there was no association between the cardiac enzyme (creatine kinase myocardial band, High-sensitivity Troponin I, and B-type natriuretic peptide) and RVLS, but patients with impaired RVLS had more tricuspid regurgitation and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure than those without impaired RVLS. As such, given the small number of events, it becomes impossible, in our view, to claim with certainty that RVLS is independently associated with outcomes in this sick group of patients without properly accounting for the health of the right-side unit(2). This includes incorporating the right chamber size (larger in nonsurvivors), pulmonary pressures (greater in nonsurvivors), tricuspid regurgitation severity, and RV systolic function. Given the small number of events, the authors could at minimum evaluate the impact of the RV-PA coupling, which takes into account RV systolic performance at a given degree of afterload and which has been shown in several other cohorts to be prognostically important(3,4).Second, the incremental prognostic value of RVLS over the comprehensive clinical assessment including known risk factors is also unclear, which given a likely type II error (underpowered), becomes less apparent. A case in point is baseline cardiovascular disease, which has a significant hazard ratio in the univariate analysis (2.93) and is shown by many other publications in this COVID-19 population to be associated with worse outcomes, but \"loses\" its signifi-cance in the overfitted multivariate model (3 variables for 18 events). Last, RVLS is highly dependent on adequate image quality, which can be challenging in this group of sick patients, at times in the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation or in supine or prone position, all of which make echocardiographic imaging quality decrease. In fact, the authors excluded 24 (16%) of the initial 150 patients, due to suboptimal image quality analysis for RVLS. Could other parameters of RV size/ function be assessed besides RVLS in these excluded patients? The study by Li et al. (1) is an important first step in the assessment of RV dysfunction in patients with COVID-19, and we commend them for exploring new parameters of RV performance. However we believe that a more balanced perspective of their findings is necessary, because we do not know the additional value of RVLS over the other clinical and echocardiographic parameters, which can be assessed more easily and possibly without direct potential exposure to COVID-19. Further studies are needed before this parameter could be used to improve the risk stratification. Fukui, MD, PhD Jo\u00e3o L.

COVID-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more likely to have more severe clinical course and represent a higher proportion of the patients who are at greater risk of mortality. Although cardiovascular disease has a marginal significance in the univariate analysis (p \u00bc 0.058), it was not included in the multivariate analysis due to the smaller number of endpoints. Speckle-tracking echocardiography is dependent on image quality, which may relatively preclude its wide application in clinical practice, especially in patients who had a poor echocardiographic window. Therefore, we had to exclude 24 patients due to suboptimal image quality. Except for RVLS, RV size and function parameters were measured in these excluded cases. Our study showed that there were no significant differences in RV structure and function parameters between patients included for final analysis and those who were excluded. Therefore, we think the effect of excluding cases on our findings may be negligible. We agree with the comments of Dr. Fukui and colleagues regarding the need for exploring the incremental prognostic value of RVLS over comprehensive clinical assessment. However, the small number of observed events does not enable us to explore the additive value of RVLS over the known risk factors. Future studies with larger simple sizes are needed to determine the additional prognostic value of RVLS over the other clinical and echocardiographic parameters in COVID-19 patients. We are also delighted to respond to Dr. Schiavon and colleagues, who commented on the relatively high prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and no cases of pulmonary embolization (PE) in our study. Each patient in the present study received both bedside echocardiography and the lower-extremity venous ultrasound. The levels of DVT included the bilateral common femoral, deep, and superficial femoral, and the popliteal veins as well as the posterior tibial, peroneal, and calf muscle veins. Moreover, if there was any clinical suspicion of PE, computed tomographic angiography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA) was considered (4) and obtained, if possible. In the present study, CTPA was performed in 2 patients with DVT, but neither of them was diagnosed with PE. Although previous studies demonstrated an increased risk of DVT and potential PE in respiratory and other intensive care settings (5), our data suggested that CTPA-confirmed PE was less frequent in this group of patients. Nevertheless, the finding was limited because we did not perform screening CTPA for every patient with DVT. We agree with the comments by Dr. Schiavon and colleagues about the effect of the timing of echocardiographic study and ventilation on RV echo parameters. In our study, there were 105 patients (87.5%) with oxygen therapy, 6 patients (5%) with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 15 patients (12.5%) with invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of echocardiographic examinations. Indeed, two-thirds of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation had the worst RV longitudinal strain. We acknowledge that the proposed cutoff values for RV function are largely within the normal range. Except for the thoughtful explanation proposed by Schiavon and colleagues, another important reason may be the small proportion of patients (22%) admitted to the intensive care unit as well as those (12.5%) receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.
