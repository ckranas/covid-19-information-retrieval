They cover more than 70% of the earth's surface, hold 97% of the world's water, host some of the planet's most diverse ecosystems, and support economies in countries around the world [1, 2]. Microscopic organisms in the seas are a major source of atmospheric oxygen [3, 4, 5, 6]. By absorbing more than 90% of the excess heat released into the earth's environment and nearly one-third of carbon dioxide emissions, the oceans slow planetary warming and stabilize the global climate [7] .",

Rising seas and increasingly violent coastal storms endanger the 600 million people worldwide who live within 10 m of sea level [1] . Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 have caused acidification of the oceans, which in turn destroys coral reefs, impairs development of oysters and other shellfish, and dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the food web [1, 18, 19] . The oceans are losing oxygen [1] . Fish stocks are declining [20, 21, 22] . Dredging, mechanized trawling, oil exploration, and planned deep undersea metal mining threaten the seabeds [23] .",

Today, however, the claim that pollution is inevitable and that pollution control costs jobs and stifles economies is no longer tenable. It has been disproven by the experience of the many countries that have more than doubled their GDPs in the past half century while greatly reducing pollution [24] [25] [26] .

In ASGM, mercury is used to form an amalgam to separate gold from rock. The amalgam is heated to boil off the mercury leaving the gold behind. ASGM operations release mercury to the environment through vaporization and through runoff of spilled mercury into waterways [34] . Metal mining and oil and gas exploration can be additional sources of mercury release. In rivers, lakes and the oceans, the metallic, inorganic mercury released to the environment from these sources is converted by marine microorganisms into methylmercury, an organic form of mercury that is a potent neurotoxicant.",

These losses range in magnitude from 0.2 to 5.13 IQ points depending on the severity of exposure. These authors found additionally that population-wide downward shifts in IQ caused by widespread exposure to methylmercury are associated with excess cases of mental retardation (IQ below 70), amounting to 3.2% (range: 0.2-5.4%) of all cases of mental retardation in the United States [80].",

Ocean acidification appears in some instances to mitigate [85] or even reduce [86] the toxicity of mercury.

The size distribution of ocean microplastics is highly skewed, with increasing numbers of particles at smaller particle sizes [108, 109] . Microplastic particles can sink downward through the water column and accumulate on the ocean floor. In contrast to microplastics, which have been measured widely in the marine environment (e.g., Text Box 1) and in marine organisms, concentrations of nanoplastics are poorly defined [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] .",

Powerful prospective cohort studies, such as the Nurses' Health Study II and the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study [220] provide compelling evidence that POPs exposures in humans are associated with a broad range of cardiovascular conditions. \u2022 Developmental defects: The core concept of developmental toxicity is that that exposures to extremely low doses of toxic chemicals during windows of exquisite vulnerability in early development can have devastating, potentially lifelong effects on health [221] . Genetic imprinting appears to be a mechanism by which toxic exposures during vulnerable periods injure health and increase risk of disease [222, 223] . The Developmental Origin of Human Adult Diseases (DOHAD) hypothesis encapsulates this concept [224] , and DOHAD is now recognized to be a widespread phenomenon that explains the toxicity of many man-ufactured chemicals [225, 226] . Some developmental toxicants act by disrupting endocrine function while others directly damage developing organs such as the lungs and the brain. The first well-described example of the unique susceptibility of infants and children to toxic chemicals in the environment was in the Minamata disaster in post-war Japan. In Minamata, prenatal exposures of human infants in utero to high concentrations of methylmercury in contaminated fish consumed by their mothers during pregnancy caused profound neurological impairment. The mothers, by contrast, sustained little or no physical toxicity [227] .",

Damage done to the brain early in development can become evident at any point in infancy, in childhood, or later in life [245] [246] [247] . Systematic reviews have now linked early life exposures to several POPs and pesticides (e.g., OP pesticides) [248] to cognitive deficits, ADHD, and autism. Ongoing prospective cohort studies continue to identify new, previously unsuspected chemical causes of developmental neurotoxicity. Analysis of NHANES data suggests that PBDE exposure in early life is a major contributor to the burden of intellectual disability in children, resulting in loss of 162 million IQ points and more than 738,000 cases of intellectual disability [249] in the United States each year.",

Thus, the association between prenatal PBDE exposure and attention problems persists at least to age seven years [251] . Likewise, early exposures to PCB 153, DDE, \u03b2-HCH, and PFOS are associated with hyperactivity up to at least age 13 years [241, 252] . Postnatal exposures may also contribute to these effects and post-natal exposure to PCBs are linked to deficits in fine motor function in Inuit children at age 11 years [253]. \u2022 Endocrine disruption: An endocrine disruptor is defined as \"an exogenous substance that causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, secondary to changes in endocrine function\" [254] . A number of manufactured chemicals have been found capable of damaging human and ecosystem health through disruption of endocrine function. Chemicals or chemical mixtures can interfere with natural hormones by blocking, mimicking, or disrupting their actions in development, in maintenance of homeostasis and in physiologic function [128] . Many POPs are EDCs. Because they are environmentally persistent, these chemicals can continue cause damage to living organisms for years or even decades after their release to the environment [255] . Two examples are DDE, the stable metabolite of DDT and PCBs. Both DDT and PCBs have been banned for several decades, but both are still identified in most human blood, milk, and adipose tissues as well as in top predator fish species and marine mammals. [270] . \u2022 Mortality: Studies in the PIVUS cohort suggest that mortality due to CVD is associated with higher body burdens of POPs [220] . In the US NHANES survey, some organochlorine pesticides have been found to be associated with increased all-cause mortality and others with increased non-cancer, non-cardiovascular mortality [271] . Higher concentrations of POPs in plasma are associated with decreased survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [272] . Kim et al. found that an interaction between POPs concentrations and total body fat mass affected risk of mortality from chronic diseases [273] . Massive exposures in early life to PCBs, dioxins, and furans in the Yusho and Yu-Cheng episodes in Japan and Tai-wan have been linked to increased risk of mortality from chronic diseases [273] and to elevated all-cause mortality [234, 270] .",

The movement of harmful algae into the Arctic coupled with northern indigenous peoples' lack of experience with HAB toxins put these populations at high risk of exposure and disease.

Increased abundance of these materials results in proliferation of some, but not all species of microalgae. If the proliferating species are not the preferred food source of species above them, the composition of the entire food web can be altered and follow-on adjustments in the relative abundances of grazers and predators can ripple through multiple trophic levels [467] .

The small invertebrates that populate estuaries are well able to cope with changing conditions of salinity and temperature caused by riverine and marine tidal influences [469] . However, these organisms can be highly susceptible to pollution, and coastal pollution can reduce invertebrate abundance and remove intolerant species entirely [470, 471] .

All of these changes compromise the nursery function of estuaries. These changes can result in increased or decreased salinity, more frequent or less frequent flooding, changes in energy supplies, frequent closures of inlets that hinder migration of marine species in and out of estuaries, and changes in the timing of inlet closure and opening such that they no longer synchronize with fish life stages [475] [476] [477] [478] .",

Losses and changes of habitat, increasing light and noise levels, and industrial chemical discharges impact fish populations in these areas, modifying their behavior and ultimately reducing the amounts of fish available to feed humans [483, 484] . Dredging and coastal pollution increase turbidity, change the light regime in the water column, impact primary production, and affect migration and predator-prey interactions [481] . Increased foraging activity in artificially lit areas increases predation pressure on one trophic level, and in turn releases predation pressure on the next trophic level [485] . Noise pollution may affect fish and marine mammal communication, as well as the behavior of invertebrates. Artificial hard structures change habitat that might originally have been comprised of soft sediment. Such changes in habitat provide opportunities for invasive species [481, 481] . All such modifications, especially when they are of large scale, cause changes in the food web, resulting in changed productivity patterns that alter ecosystem services to humans. Although human modifications can occasionally enhance habitat and increase fishery production (e.g., around artificial reefs), the negative impacts of human activity far outweigh their positive benefits on a global scale [481] . Reduced content of dissolved oxygen in seawaterocean hypoxia -is another consequence of pollution and climate change that has negative impacts on fish stocks [486, 487] . Ocean hypoxia is the result of terrestrial runoff that introduces nutrients to the seas, increases frequency of HABs, and leads to eutrophication and the formation of dead zones. Vast releases of organic matter from industry and waste water systems further compound these effects. Hypoxic areas and dead zones are increasing in seas across the globe [488] . Additional contributory factors are sea surface warming, which reduces oxygen solubility in the oceans and changes stratification patterns that, in turn, may reduce ocean mixing and prevent re-oxygenation [489] . All of these effects are most pronounced in coastal and continental shelf areas of the oceans -the regions of the seas that produce 90% of commercially exploited fish species [490] .",

Over the past several decades, several disturbances have threatened the reefs (Craig et al., 2005) . In the latter half of the 20th century, tuna canneries regularly released nutrient-rich wastewater to Samoan coastal waters leading to an increase in coral-eating plankton and a decrease in corals. By the late 1970s, after an outbreak of crown-of-thorn starfish, only 10% of the corals remained.

These blooms produce potent natural toxins such as ciguatera toxin and domoic acid that can concentrate to high levels in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological disease and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and trigger asthma and other respiratory diseases. \u2022 Coastal pollution in concert with sea surface warming stimulates overgrowth of dangerous pathogens, most notably Vibrio species. Coastal pollution also increases antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in marine pathogens. With worsening coastal pollution and rising sea surface temperatures, concern is great that diseases caused by marine pathogens could spread into new, previously unaffected areas, especially places in the Global South where infrastructure is poorly developed and public health systems are weak. \u2022 Declines in seafood stocks caused by pollution, ocean warming, ocean acidification and overfishing threaten the health and well-being of the millions of people worldwide who depend on the seas for their food and their livelihood. 3. Ocean pollution has multiple harmful effects on marine ecosystems. These effects can have negative impacts on human health. Plastic pollution kills fish, seabirds, whales, and dolphins. Pharmaceutical waste contributes to the destruction of coral reefs. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the oceans causes ocean acidification, destroys coral reefs and dissolves calcium-containing plankton at the base of the marine food web. Petroleumbased pollutants and POPs impede the production of oxygen by beneficial marine microorganisms. 4. Ocean pollution is deeply unjust. Ocean pollution and all its negative impacts fall disproportionately on people in small island nations, indigenous communities, coastal communities in the Global South, and fishing communities worldwide. These are populations that create only miniscule amounts of pollution. Most of the pollution to which they are exposed arises from sources far away. This is environmental injustice on a global scale. 5. Ocean pollution is inadequately charted. Current knowledge of ocean pollution and its impacts on human health is still at a relatively early stage. Information on the geographic distribution and concentrations of pollutants in the oceans is fragmentary and confined mostly to the seas that border high-income countries. Likewise, information on the sizes of the human populations exposed to ocean pollution and their levels of exposure is scant. Data that could support the development of estimates of the contribution of ocean pollution to the global burden of disease (GBD) are only beginning to be developed.",

A second goal is to better quantify the contributions of ocean pollution to the global burden of disease (GBD). Findings from the GBD study have become powerful shapers of health and environmental policy and are used by international agencies and national governments to set health and environmental priorities and guide the allocation of resources. It is therefore critically important that accurate information on the disease burden attributable to ocean pollution be accurately and fully captured in the GBD analysis and made available to policy-makers. Specific recommendations are the following:",

A major impediment to estimating the GBD attributable to pollution of the oceans is a lack of comprehensive, geospatially coded measurements that display current information on the types and concentrations of pollution in seas around the world and their impacts on human health and wellbeing. Absent this information, it is not possible to estimate the sizes of the populations exposed to ocean pollutants or their levels of exposure. Opportunity exists here to apply new technologies such as satellite imaging and ocean sampling by marine saildrones and autonomous underwater vehicles coupled with big data analyses that integrate data from multiple sources. Monitoring for all of the chemical and biological hazards in the oceans should increase in scope and be coordinated globally. It is possible to monitor for some biological hazards, ocean pH, and temperature in sensors that are part of the Global Ocean Observing system (GOOS) within the UN system. Enhancing this capability and adding sensors for chemical hazards that incorporate new technologies and capabilities is an objective that may be achieved by partnering with programs such as the Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO). \u2022 Enhanced sampling of pollutant concentrations in fish, shellfish, and marine mammals. Because consumption of contaminated seafood is the major route by which chemical pollutants in the ocean as well as HAB toxins reach humans, better information is needed on concentrations of key pollutants in seafood. High-quality data are available from high-income countries, but much less information is available from the countries of the Global South. \u2022 Improved tracking of biomarkers that are early indicators of damage caused to human health and marine ecosystems by chemical pollutants. \u2022 Expanded coverage of ocean sampling for marine pathogens. Techniques have been developed for monitoring the global spread of pathogenic bacteria, such as Vibrio species, but these techniques have been deployed to date in only a few areas of the world. Expanded geographic coverage of marine bacterial sampling -especially into areas important for commercial fishing, shellfish harvesting and aquaculture -coupled with real-time information on sea surface temperature will be important for tracking, and predicting the spread of life-threatening bacteria and for mobilizing early responses to new outbreaks of diseases. \u2022 Improved studies of human exposure to ocean pollutants. A major impediment to developing estimates of the GBD attributable to ocean pollutants is lack of detailed, population-level studies of human exposures to marine pollutants. Conducting such studies in a number of countries will elucidate the importance of such factors as geographic variation in background exposure to pollutants, in seafood consumption, in pollutant concentrations in seafood, and in exposures to toxic chemicals via routes other than consumption of contaminated seafood. \u2022 Improved assessments of combined effects of exposures to multiple ocean pollutants. Humans are seldom exposed to pollutants one at a time. Instead, people are typically exposed to complex mixtures of pollutants. The limited available evidence indicates that these combined exposures can produce additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects. \u2022 Implementation research. Transdisciplinary international cooperative implementation research is needed to identify best practices and feasible, cost-effective solutions to prevention and control of ocean pollution. This research will build upon and codify the findings that have emerged from the case studies in success against ocean pollution presented in this report. Continuing research and development into biodegradable polymers will be an important component of this research [572] .",
