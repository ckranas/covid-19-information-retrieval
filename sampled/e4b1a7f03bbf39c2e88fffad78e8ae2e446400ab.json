Lactobacillus enhanced the level of mucosal proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell structure, and mobility in the jejunum of weaning piglets. The higher VFA concentration in the colon of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-fed piglets might have contributed to the lower rates of diarrhoea. The higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acid in the ileum and colon of LAB-fed piglets could have been the result of the higher numbers of LAB in these animals, as LAB during fermentation may either produce lactic acid alone or may produce both lactic and acetic acid. The LAB numbers and their major fermentation products may indirectly affect the concentrations of acetic, propionic and butyric acid. Reduction of pathogenic microorganisms in the gut of animals can be explained by the fact that LAB reduces pH in the luminal contents, which can inhibit the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria.

Yeast might change the immune function of the gut by triggering a Th-1 response. A possible explanation may be that yeast triggers gut epithelium or gut-associated lymphoid tissue Th-1 responses by activating macrophages. IFN-\u03b3, which can activate phagocytosis by macrophages, was increased in gut mucosa by yeast supplementation. Thus, weaning-induced systemic immune response alleviated by yeast cells may be due to improvements in Th-1 response in gut mucosa. Yeast has been shown to promote the growth of lactobacilli, suggesting that the lower numbers of faecal coliforms in the treated group could be interpreted as a positive effect of yeast on the enteric ecosystem, intestinal integrity, and health. The higher proportions of CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes in the yeast group suggest that systemic cell-mediated immunity was activated by the changes induced by yeast.

Soybean oligosaccharides was found to increase the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 mRNA but to diminish the expression of pro-inflamatory cytokines TNF-\uf061, IL-1\uf062, and IL-8 mRNA in both the ileum and colon, whereas supplementation increased that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.

SOY peptide treated pigs had reduced IL17a and RORC gene expression compared to positive controls, suggesting that soy peptides may modulate this pathway. Cytokine IL17a activates the NF-\uf06b\uf042 and MAPK proinflammatory cascade, and recent studies indicate that RORC is necessary for T-helper (Th)-17 commitment and differentiation. Soy peptide supplementation lowered the expression of IFN-\uf067, TNF, and IL12b. The Treg transcription factor, FOXP3, was highly expressed in the ileum of SOY pigs.

The effect of SDP on the performance is unclear. SDP improved duodenal villus height and duodenal villus height to crypt depth ratio in piglets. SDP also reduced malondialdehyde content in mucosa.

Piglets fed porcine SDP (SDPP) diet exhibited higher levels of IgG. Dietary SDP plasma reduced the percentage of blood monocytes and macrophages (SWC3+) in ileal Peyer's patches (PP) and lymph nodes (LN), of B lymphocytes (CD21+) and \u03b3\u03b4+ T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 T cell receptor (TCR)+) in LN, and of intraepithelial lymphocytes as well as the density of lamina propria cells in the colon.

Pigs fed diets containing egg yolk antibodies had longer villi, less severe diarrhoea, and grew faster. The oral administration of bovine colostrum seems to improve and retain the immunological properties of the structures associated with the gastrointestinal tract in weaning piglets by generating different types of responses protecting the pigs from infectious and allergic diseases. The immunomodulatory effects of bovine colostrum primarily target the GALT, which responds by producing, at different levels, both Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\uf067 and IL-12) and anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). The CD21+/CD3+ cells populations of the ileal Peyer's patch (PP) were markedly affected, and a decrease in IFN-\uf067 was also observed in the ileal PP consecutive to colostrum administration. Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that bovine colostrum may influence the development of the IgA response by potentiating a Th2 response in the ileal PP. The general increase in cytokine production by mucosal and systemic immune cells isolated from piglets fed dietary bovine lactoferrin (bLF) indicates a priming of the immune system. IL-10 was increased under both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated conditions, which potentially limits inflammation. In LF piglets, the spleen cells, but not MLN, increased with regard to IFN-\uf067 and TNF-\uf061 production; MLN, but not spleen cells, tended to increase IL-6 production, demonstrating organ-specific effects of dietary bLF treatment. Strong TNF-\uf061 and IL-6 production indicates a robust innate immune response by the cells from piglets fed bLF compared with those fed the control diet. The improved IFN-\uf067 response indicates that dietary bLF may be most important in T-helper-1-type adaptive immune responses and thus is vital to protection from infection. Pigs supplemented with LF had greater villus heights and lower crypt depths at the small intestinal mucosa, which may contribute to improved growth performance. Supplemental LF significantly improved the relative abundance of mRNA for PR-39 and protegrin-1, suggesting that LF can regulate the expression of the 2 cathelicidins in the bone marrow of weanling piglets. LF could regulate transcription of the IL-1\uf062 gene and may also regulate transcription of other natural genes containing the LF binding sites.

Glutamine was able to alleviate the stressful condition and inflammation and to improve immunity and growth performance in the early starter stage. In response to dietary glutamine supplementation, expression of eight genes was downregulated in the small intestine. These genes are related to cellular signalling transduction [casein kinase 1 epsilon and MAPK-6], the cell cycle [Rho-related GTP-binding protein], apoptosis [KLF-10], immune activation (La antoantigen homolog and ICAM-1), protein modification [peptidylprolyl isomerase G], and gene expression (pre-mRNA cleavage complex II). Enhanced expression of antigens and activation of leukocytes in the intestinal epithelium due to activation of the MAPK-6 signalling may contribute to intestinal dysfunction and diarrhoea in weanling pigs. Another beneficial effect of glutamine supplementation is increased expression of six genes related to transcription regulation [AF-9 protein], lipid metabolism (endozepine), iron absorption (heme-binding protein), cytoskeletal structure and function (myosin), defence against pathological microorganisms [IL-13R-a-1 and endozepine], and regulation of nutrient metabolism (signal recognition particle 72K chain). Feeding glutamine has beneficial effects in alleviating growth depression of E. coli K88+-challenged pigs, primarily through maintenance of intestinal morphology and function, and/or possibly through modulation of the somatotrophic axis. Supplementing the diet with Glycine (Gly)-Glutamine (Gln) improved the growth and intestinal integrity of weanling piglets. Gln supplementation during the weaning period is useful in reducing the early stages in weaning-related gastrointestinal infections by suppressing the inflammatory and regulatory cytokine response in the gut and decreasing damage to tight junction proteins and intestinal electrolyte movement. The adverse effects of LPS on intestinal integrity could be mediated by the decline in average daily feed intake ADFI, but could also be directly affected as a result of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-1\uf062 secretion), whereas Gly-Gln may have the ability to limit this proinflammatory response. Reduced performance was observed in glycinin-or b-conglycinin sensitised piglets. The Increased Proliferative Index, Apoptotic Index, and relative metabolic rate (REMR) were only observed in duodenum of piglets fed with glycinin or b-conglycinin. Glutamate supplementation numerically improved duodenal villus height and IgG levels. Organic acids improved growth performance primarily via reducing pathogenic bacteria and increasing beneficial bacterial population in the gut and faeces. Diets supplemented with organic acids fail to affect the growth performance of weaned pigs. Diets supplemented with organic acids enhanced PBMC and MLN proliferation by Concanavalin (Con) A. Poke weed mitogen (PWM) stimulation was more evidenced than the organic acids effect on spenlocyte proliferation, Ig or antiSEP titer response. The mechanisms for the effects of diet supplemented with organic acids on enhancing T-and B-cell proliferations were dependent on energy supply, and other pathways still need to be understood.

Furthermore, mixtures of CLA and n-3 PUFA accelerated recovery by activating PPAR d, i.e. induced uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 and upregulating the expression of KGF in the colon. CLA-supplementation increased the numbers of \uf067\uf064+-T cells in the colonic mucosa in pigs with bacterial-induced colitis. CLA favoured a CD8+ T cell phenotype with an increased predominance of naive cells (CD8+CD29low and CD8+CD45RC+). This naive CD8 Tcell phenotype in the peripheral blood of uninfected pigs fed CLA originated from an enhanced thymic output of CD8 T-cells. After the PCV2 challenge, this was overshadowed by the expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells and increased CD25 expression. In T-cell immunoregulation, dietary CLA differentially modulated PPAR-\uf061 and PPAR-\uf067 expression in PCV2-infected pigs. Greater expression of PPAR-\uf061 in the lymph nodes of pigs fed with the control diets was associated with attenuated CD8+ T-cell responses.

Hydrolysed yeast and YCW increased the height and width of the villi in the jejunum, where maximum absorption of nutrients takes place. Longer villi indicate more mature epithelia and enhanced absorptive function due to increased surface area of the villus. It is possible that increased mucin secretion from the goblet cells under the influence of the hydrolysed yeast and the YCW supplementation, coupled with the intrinsic properties of the yeast cell wall mannans binding to bacteria, decreased the number of free bacteria in the lumen and increased their counts on the mucosa. YCW may enhance the cell-mediated immune response in broiler chickens by modulating the production of cytokines. IL-1\uf062 and IL-6 expressions were significantly enhanced in the spleen of YCW-fed birds, suggesting that YCW might act as an immunoprotective agent by up-regulating the inflammatory response leading to enhanced protection against pathogens. Supplementation of broiler diets with yeast-derived macromolecules (YDM) resulted in both local and systemic immune responses where TLR2 was primarily involved locally, whereas only TLR4 was involved systemically with the production of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The TLR-21 was not observed to be a major receptor involved as a result of YDM supplementation. Supplementation of YDM supports both a pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine effect via Th1 and Th2 cell-associated pathways, both locally and systemically, with expressions of IL-2, IL-1\uf062, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\uf062, TGF-\uf0624, IL-10, IL-4, and CD40 locally and IL-12p35, IFN-\uf067, TGF-\u03b24, and IL-4 systemically.\uf020 Supplementation of whole yeast cell products, in the absence of any pathogen challenge, increases the IL-10 mRNA amount and Treg population in the caecal tonsils of birds. In the absence of infection, higher IL-10 production and Treg numbers in the gut will facilitate immune tolerance. In the presence of pathogenic bacteria, an inflammatory response mediated by Th17 cells predominates and Tregs lose their suppressive properties and IL-10 production.

Butiric acid (BA) reduced villus length and increased microvillus and crypt depth. Dietary BA inclusion did not affect the counts of lymphocytes, heterophils, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils. Butyric acid reduces virulence gene expression and invasiveness in S. enteritidis; it also decreases in invasion and has been proposed to lead to decreased caecal colonisation. Prebiotic, butyric acid glycerides, and probiotics or their combination with prebiotics or butyric acid glycerides enhance the resistance of birds and partially protect against Coccidiosis.

A combination of Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) agonists and butyrate (or butyrate analogues) with a strong capacity to induce host defence peptide (HDP) synthesis may have the potential to augment animal innate immunity. CLA (conjugated linoleic acid) alleviated the immunosuppression of T-lymphocytes in broiler chickens exposed to cyclosporin A through increasing the peripheral blood Tlymphocyte proliferation and IL-2. The 2 CLA isomers enhanced T-lymphocyte proliferation at low concentrations and inhibited T-lymphocyte proliferation at high concentrations. At a cellular level, the effects of CLA on the alleviation of immunosuppression in T-lymphocytes are mainly attributable to increasing the signalling molecules, such as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Feeding low dietary ratios of linoleic to linoleic acid to newly hatched chicks modified fatty acid composition of immune tissues, resulting in an increase in antibody production against standard vaccines. The proliferation of lymphocytes depends on the production of IL-2. One may speculate that the effects of dietary alpha-linoleic acid (LNA) on lymphocyte stimulation is caused by the increased competition of n-3 and n-6 PUFA for the binding sites of cyclooxygenase to produce Prostaglandin E2(PGE2).

The enhanced engulfment may be due to potential effects of \uf061-tocopherol on receptors located on the cell membrane for different functions and are Fc portion of immunoglobulins.

The lack of a significant diet effect on IFN-\uf067 supports an increase in T-helper cell number rather than an augmentation of the T-cell-mediated immune response. The addition of immune-enhancing substances to chicken diets may have different effects due to the genetic backgrounds of the lines. When breeders received a high mix (retinol (vitamin A), tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), zinc, copper and selenium) the number of infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the intestine was higher compared with those of breeders receiving basal amounts of minerals and vitamins. Additionally, the recovery rate of intestinal lesions, cystic crypts, and villus atrophy, as observed by histopathology, was faster in the groups in which the breeders received high mix.

However, it resulted in lighter relative weight, longer villus length, and shorter crypt depth of the small intestine. Dietary Folic Acid (FA) enhanced expression of IL-8 in the spleen; however, there was a downregulation in the expression of IL-8 in the caecal tonsils, indicating a pleiotropic effect of FA in older laying hens under acute LPS challenge. Interleukin-18 and IL-1\uf062 are related pro-inflammatory cytokines critical to the initiation of inflammatory responses. The downregulation of IL-1\uf062 and IL-18 in the caecal tonsils may partially explain the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of FA in young laying hens exposed to an acute LPS challenge. This downregulation reduces the likelihood of an immune response to an antigen and serves to control inflammatory responses once the pathogen has been cleared.

Natural Clinoptilolite (NCLI) and modified Clinoptilolite (MCLI) improved the permeability of the intestinal mucosa, reduced the extent of intestinal mucosa damage, and ultimately protected intestinal mucosal barrier function. Pre-treatment with NCLI and MCLI significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggested that NCLI and MCLI could decrease the concentrations of TNF-\uf061, IL-1 and IL-10. This indicated that NCLI and MCLI could improve the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and played a protective role in the broiler intestinal barrier function. The addition of Zinc-bearing clinoptilolite (ZnCP) to the diet produced a decreasing effect on the Salmonella population, suggesting that ZnCP can regulate the caecal microflora of broilers after Salmonella infection. The protective effects of ZnCP on growth performance, microflora colonies, and serum diamin oxidase (DAO) of broilers infected by Salmonella might attribute to the antibacterial activity and the adsorption of bacteria or toxins onto ZnCP. Therefore, ZnCP could act as an antibacterial agent against Salmonella, inhibiting its growth and improving the gut health. Results indicated that supplementation with ZnCP significantly decreased the relative weight of the spleen. It is likely that ZnCP could adsorb Salmonella bacteria or toxins and inhibit its activity, decreasing the transportation of Salmonella into the spleen and thus reducing the immune reactions against Salmonella and spleen weight.

These changes may affect the immune function of local intestinal mucosa in broilers. The ameliorative effects of dietary sodium (Na)-bentonite on the reduced percentage and mean of phagocytosis caused by Aflatoxin could be attributed to the role of Na-bentonite as a sequestering agent against aflatoxin (AF) present in the diet through reducing its bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Minerals"}, {"text": "Amino acids and derivatives Use of L-threonine increased intestinal morphology parameters such as crypt depth, villi height, and width in both the jejunum and ileum segments.

Because the bursa is the source organ for B-cells, the development of the bursa may induce the proliferation of B-cells. Thus, the growth-promoting effect of phytase may be expressed via both nutrient release and a physiological regulation mechanism. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells are enhanced by phytase addition, indicating a potential for increased activity of immunocytes. Part of the nutritional improvements associated with phytase may be mediated through improvements in immunocyte activity. Birds fed high-phytate diets returned a lower concentration of sIgA in jejunal mucosa, which may partially result from dilution when mucin is hypersecreted, as stimulated by phytate. The mechanism by which phytate influences mucin integrity is thought to be related to the highly (pH dependent) reactive nature of dietary phytate. When feed is exposed to the low pH conditions in the proximal gut, phytate is solubilised and can react electrostatically with basic amino acid residues in dietary protein.

Increased expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor implies that the neutrophils of the treated animals may be more sensitive to EGF signalling and therefore may be more sensitive to TNF.

Probiotic supplementation reduced the faecal count of Clostridia and Enterococci. Oral administration of Enterococcus in calves may have an immunostimulatory effect, promoting the earlier recovery of IgA levels in mucosal immunity, enhancing the intestinal mucosal immunity, increasing the number of IELs, and reinforcing of the intestinal mucosal barrier against infection by the hyperplasia of epithelial goblet cells in the small intestine. Animals fed with the probiotic group also showed a higher number of mast cells. Intestinal mucosal mast cells are important immunocompetent cells in the intestinal mucosal immune response, and they exert multifunctional roles.

Chromium (2): Supplementation of the rations for dairy cows with chromium affected the regulation rather than the intensity of immune responses. The relative dominance of the specific antibodies of IgG2 isotype is not only a sign of the prevalence of cell-mediated type of immune response (Th1 type) but also of a higher efficiency in the protection against bacterial and some viral and parasitic infections.

The improved milk production might be attributed to improved rumen fermentation, Zn status, and immune function. Addition of soybean Trypsin Inhibitor may be beneficial not only by protecting Ig but also by protecting these nonspecific antimicrobial factors from proteolytic degradation. Difructose Anhydride (DFA) III (1): The MCH was significantly higher in the DFA III group than in the control group. This suggests that DFA III increases Hb production and maintains the MCH within the normal range. Further, supplemental DFA III may accelerate the shift of iron into the Hb in the blood more efficiently in the early stages after calving than in the late stages. Further, the serum iron concentration at 24 h after calving was significantly lower in the DFA III group than in the control group. The increase of IgG indicates the superior immunological status of the calves in the DFA III group at one month after calving, and this finding is consistent with the difference in duration of medical treatment between the groups at two months after calving and at weaning. Monensin (MO) (1): Feeding monensin could be beneficial in terms of increasing bypass protein from the rumen, but it did not improve feed digestion or milk production. Colostrum replacer (1): Calves fed colostrum replacer had a significantly higher rate of daily weight gain and were less likely to be affected with diarrhoea. The effects of lactulose are sex-specific: male calves tended to have higher body weight and female calves tended to have increased changes in intestinal morphology in response to lactulose. Ileal villus height, crypt depth, and the surface area of lymph follicles from Peyer's patches were reduced by lactulose treatment. Some studies found that lactulose feeding significantly stimulated IL-10 production in the jejunum and colon and others showed decreases in IL-10 mRNA expression. IL-10 can inhibit antigen specific proliferation and cytokine secretion by Th1 lymphocytes and has down-regulatory effects on macrophages and dendritic cells, such as suppression of activation and IL-12 production and prevention of interferon-\uf067 induced disruption of colonic epithelial barriers. High dose lactulose feeding significantly stimulated TGF-\uf0621 production in the caecum. TGF-\uf0621 regulates proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and immune regulation. Lactulose has a suppressive effect on the anti-apoptotic marker B-cell lymphomaextra large (Bcl-xl) in the jejunum. The high lactulose feeding has upregulated the apoptotic molecule caspase 3 in the caecum. The enhanced apoptotic rate of caspase 3 seems to be associated with a decrease in crypt depth due to lactulose supplementation. Total leukocyte count was decreased but a significantly greater number of blood lymphocytes were detected in lactulose group. Additional lactulose feeding had an immunomodulatory effect on the composition of T-cell subsets in different immune compartments. The expression results in male calves indicated that the transcription of IgA Fc receptor in the ileal mucosa of lactulose treatment group increased. Decreases in interferon-\uf067 mRNA expression were observed in the ileum.

Dietary choline enhanced the serum activities of lysozyme and ACP, haemagglutination titer, C3 and C4 levels, and the leucocytes phagocytic activity of juvenile Jian carp after challenge; this suggests an improvement of the innate immune response of juvenile Jian carp, caused by choline.

There were significant interactions between vitamin A and Lf with respect to crypt cell proliferation, not only in the colon but also in the ileum. When introduced to HS diets, this supplement increased erythrocyte count by 4.2% and haematocrit value by 4.7%, whereas its presence in the diets based on hay alone had no effect on these parameters. The MOS additive influenced (P\u22640.05) white blood cell counts but its impact varied significantly across treatments.

In the meantime, gut microbiome also plays an important role in intestinal development (Pan & Yu, 2014). As a component of the intestinal mucosal innate immune system, the mucus layer prevents gut microorganisms from penetrating into the intestinal epithelium, serving as the first line of defence against infection.

Acidification capability was increased, as were hydrogen peroxidase and bacteriocins, which might be active against some pathogens. The increased number of peripheral monocytes expressing TLR2 (inducing pro-inflamatory cytokines i.e. IL1b, IL6, TNF\uf061) might be associated with the protection is not the result of direct antibacterial activity of the BT on the SE. In mammals, most of these cationic peptides have little direct antimicrobial activity but do enhance innate immune response without harmful inflammatory responses. Swine Intestinal Antimicrobial Peptides (SGAMP) could increase the number of mast cells, goblet cells, and IEL, suggesting that SGAMP can improve the integrity of intestinal mucosal surface structure. Markedly increased sIgA-producing cells in the duodenum, jejunum suggests that SGAMP could improve mucosal immune responses for an extended period of time. These results document the regulating capabilities of SGAMP in modulating the outcome of intestine immunocompetent cells. Dietary sAO (Sodium alginate oligosaccharides from brown algae) inclusion at 0.04 and 0.2% of the diet increased the caecal populations of LAB and reduced caecal Salmonella colonisation.

It is important to mention that, for all of the above-mentioned plant extracts, further information is needed in terms of the active compounds responsible for the physiological responses observed in fish.The effects of soybean derivatives in the immune competence of different salmonid fish presented inTable 37should not be considered positive. Signs point to an inflammatory or hypersensitivity response due to the inclusion of anti-nutritional factors in the soybean and, consequently, soybean derivatives cannot be considered immune stimulants, although their content inflavonoids and phenolic compounds may exert some beneficial effects on the activity of antioxidative stress enzymes.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF244": {"text": "Lactobacillus spp. and Bacillus spp. were the probiotic bacteria mostly tested in freshwater fish species, representing 59% of the scientific articles published in this area. Similarly to the reviewed literature on salmonids, the mode of action of probiotics in freshwater fish species depends on the study and set of parameters analysed by authors. For instance, Bacillus spp. has been reported to modulate intestinal microflora, enhance the activity of digestive enzymes, induce the up-regulation of different cytokines from the intestine (IL-1\uf062, TGF-\uf062 and TNF-\uf061), increase the humoral immune response (IgM levels, lysozyme, phagocytic, bactericidal, complement and respiratory burst activities) and the activity of several antioxidative stress enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPX). However, different results were observed across different species of the genera Bacillus in front of different pathogenic bacteria, which does not allow for generalising with regard to the mode of action of Bacillus spp. The mode of action of Lactobacillus spp. was similar to that described in Bacillus spp. with regard to the modulation of the gut microbiota, reducing oxidative stress status, and the enhancement of the humoral immune response (IgM levels, lysozyme, phagocytic, complement and respiratory burst activities), as well as an increase in the immunity of the intestinal mucosa (number of lymphocytes and acidophylic granulocytes in the intestinal epithelium), the number of circulating thrombocytes, leucocytes, and lymphocytes, and the expression of IL-10 and TNF-\uf061. Similar effects were reported with the dietary administration of Pediococcus acidolactici. Contradictory data exists with regards to the use of Pseudomonas spp. as a probiotic.
