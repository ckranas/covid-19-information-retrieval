We evaluated the safety and effi cacy of HD-CY post BMT, after myeloablative conditioning and unmanipulated haploidentical BMT, in patients with advanced or refractory hematologic malignancies. End point of the study: In this study we assessed hematologic engraftment, non relapse mortality (NRM), together with acute GVHD and infections, and relapse related death (RRD). Patients: We report 40 patients (median age 42, range 16-66); the diagnosis was AML (n=19), ALL (n=10), CML blast crisis (n=2), LNH (n=4), MI (n=3), MDS (n=2). Eighteen patients (45%) were in CR1/CR2, whereas 22 (55%) had active disease at the time of transplant; 10 patients (25%) were receiving a second allogeneic transplant. The median marrow cell dose given was 3.7x10 8 /kg (range 1.3-7.8); 11 patients were prepared",

            "text": "Background: HLA class I antigens are ligands for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). These receptors are expressed by NK and T-cells and thus modulate innate and adaptive immunity. In patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), alloreactive donor natural killer (NK) cells are believed to be of signifi cance for survival after stem cell transplantation (SCT). We tested the missing-ligand hypothesis, which indicates that alloreactivity is regulated by inhibitory KIR-receptors on natural killer NK cells and their corresponding HLA ligands on recipient cells. Aim: To analyze the impact of KIR / HLA mismatches on posttransplant relapse, transplant-related mortality and overall survival in allografted AML-patients. We therefore performed a retrospective blinded study with patients transplanted in our centre between 1996 and 2008. Patients and Methods: Out of a consecutive cohort of 177 AML-patients allografted in our centre between 1996 and 2008, samples from 108 donor/patients pairs were evaluable for retrospective KIR-ligand matching. The median patient age was 49 (range 20-69) years. Patients were transplanted with G-CSFstimulated PBSC (n=103) or bone marrow (n=5) from HLA matched unrelated (n=55) donors or family related donors (n=53). KIR typing was performed as previously described. Patients were categorised according to their HLA inhibitory KIR ligand group C1, C2, Bw4, A3/A11 and presence or absence of KIR. Results: The actuarial overall survival (OAS) of all 108 evaluable patients at 5 years is 45%. A total of 60 patients (55%) died due to relapse (n=39) or TRM/NRM (n=21). Patients with KIR-mm had a lower NRM (8/52 vs.13/56) and a lower relapse rate (16/52 vs 23/56). OAS and EFS were superior in patients with KIR-ligand mismatches (KIR-mm) compared to the group of patients without mismatches (OAS at 5 years: 59% versus 30%, log rank p=0.026, EFS at 5 years: 56% versus 33%, p=0.02). Patients with 2 KIR mismatches (C1 and/or C2) had even better survival compared to patients with single KIR mismatches. Conclusions: AML patients with KIR ligand mismatch have a reduced mortality due to both lower relapse and as well as lower TRM resulting in superior eventfree and overall survival. Patients with AML benefi t from KIR-ligand mismatched allografts. KIR typing would be a useful tool to be included to defi ne optimal histo-compatibility of donor patient pairs.",

Methods: Retrospective study in 192 AML patients who have undergone allo-SCT between 1982 and 2010. Analysis performed in 171 patients (85 male) by excluding 21 APL: 65 patients until 1999 and 106, since 2000. Median age: 37 [18-74]. Median lecocyte count: 13400/uL [470-250000]. 82% de novo AML. 87% in morfologic complete remission (70% 1\u00aaCR). 14 with previous SCT. Cytogenetic risk: 55% intermediate, 34% high and 11% low. Conditioning regimen was ablative in 162 patients: 36%CyTBI, 31%BuCy and 30%BuFlu. Donor: 76% related (95% matched) and 24% unrelated (64% matched). Stem cell source: 85% bone marrow. Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophilaxis: based on Ciclosporine in 150 patients (88%). Median time from last treatment: 73 days [12-268]. Results: Median follow-up: 61 months [1 -317]. OS at 1, 3 and 5 years: 57%, 44% and 40%. RFS at 1, 3 and 5 years: 62%, 50% and 45%. Early mortality (< day +100): 26% (43% until 1999 and 15% since 2000, p<0,0001). Late mortality: 27% (basically relapse). Cumulative relapse incidence at 5 years: 35%. Secondary malignancies incidence: 5%. Multivariable analysis showed that Transplantation Related Mortality (TRM) was infl uenced by: year of allo-SCT (OS at 5y of 49% if 2000-2010 vs 28% if 1982-1999, p<0,0001), late engraftment (p=0,002) and severe aGvHD (OS at 5y of 45% if no evidence/gradeI-II vs 25% if grade III-IV, p<0,071). Donor type and conditioning regimen lost its univariable analysis signifi cance. No difference was found in case of HLA and ABO discordance or donor/recipient CMV status. Multivariable analysis also showed that RR and RFS at 5 years was infl uenced by: disease status at allo-SCT (50% if 1\u00baCR vs 0% if \u2265; 2\u00baCR/PR/refractory disease, p<0,002)",

High dose of Cy was given at 50 mg/kg day+3, day+5. Cyclosporin and mycophenolate were given from day 0 and + 1 respectively. Results: Three patients died before day 10 of haemorrhage and infections. One patient had autologous recovery and died with progressive disease. Of the 36 (90%) evaluable patients all engrafted with 100% donor chimerism by day +30. Hematologic recovery was complete in 33 (82%) patients. The median times to neutrophil (>500/\u03bcL) and platelet recovery (>20,000/ \u03bcL) are 18 days (range, 13-30 days) and 23 days (range, 14-58 days), respectively. GvHD was scored as grade I in 13 patients (32%), grade II in 3 patients (7%) and grade III in 1 patient (2%). The incidence of grade II-III GvHD was 9%. With a median FU of 166 days , NRM is 11% and 28% in patients with CR1/CR2 or active disease (p=0.1) (Figure 1 ), RRD 0% vs 28%; p=0.01, and actuarial survival 87% vs 36% (p=0.008) ( Figure 2 ).

Zuckerman (2) (1)Rambam Medical Center (Haifa, IL); (2) Rambam Medical Center and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion (Haifa, IL) Objectives: Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations detected at the time of diagnosis are the most powerful predictors of outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Translocations of the core binding factors (CBF) [t(8;21) , inv(16)] and mutations of NMP1 gene are associated with favorable prognosis. However, 40-50% of patients still relapse. We have investigated the outcome of these patients based on post-remission therapy administered. Methods: We report a single center experience with AML patients with favorable prognosis who were uniformly treated between the years 2002 and 2010. Sixty one patients with favorable AML were identifi ed, including 19 patients with mutated NPM1/unmutated FLT-ITD, 16 patients with t(8;21) and 26 patients with inv(16) at a median age of 45(18-72) years. Induction treatment consisted of standard \u20397+3\u203a regimen. Post-remission therapy included either 3 cycles of high-dose Ara-C(HIDAC) or HIDAC (busulphan 16 mg/kg/d x 4 days and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (Auto SCT).The decision to proceed to Auto SCT was based on insurance coverage. Patients who were not in CR post-induction or with post-consolidation relapse were referred for allogeneic (allo) SCT. Results: With a median follow-up of 16 months , there was no signifi cant difference in treatment outcome between patients with different translocations/mutations (Table 1) . Statistically signifi cant improvement in OS and reduced RR were found for Auto and allo SCT versus chemotherapy [OS: Auto versus chemo; p=.0001, Odds ratio (OR): 14, allo versus chemo; p=.08, OR: 3.2] (RR: Auto versus chemo p=.021, OR:4.5, allo versus chemo; p=.06, OR:32) . Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was not signifi cantly different between chemotherapy and Auto SCT cohorts (p=0.4). Conclusions: Survival was signifi cantly superior in patients with CBF/NPM1+ AML receiving post-induction high-dose therapy with either autologous or allogeneic SCT, mainly due to a reduced relapse risk. This was achieved with no increase in toxicity in the Auto versus chemotherapy group. Patients subjected to allogeneic SCT due to residual/refractory or relapsed disease have an inferior outcome compared with patients undergoing Auto SCT as fi rst-line treatment.",

Median lecocyte count:17250/\u03bcL . 90% de novo AML and 92% in 1\u00ba Complete Remission.81% received 3+7 as Induction, 57% of which based on Idarrubicine (12 mg/m 2 ) and Citarabine (continuous 100 mg/m 2 ). 73% received, at least, 2 courses of Consolidation, combining an antracicline with low-intermediate doses of Citarabine in 74% (500 mg/m 2 /12 h for 5 days in 77% of them). Cytogenetic risk: 64% intermediate, 29% high and 7% low. Conditioning regimen: 62% oral BuCy, 24% CyTBI and 12% iv BuCy. Stem cell source: 52% Peripheral Blood (PB). Median time from last treatment: 94 days . .OS at 1,3 and 5 years: 59%, 46% and 44%. RFS at 1,3 and 5 years: 60%, 49% and 48%. No relapse after 5 years. Early mortality (<day +100): 12% (9/11 from 1988 to 1999) and late mortality, 47% (34/45 because of relapse).Secondary malignancies incidence: 13% (haematologic: 5/6), none of them had received TBI.Multivariable analysis showed that RFS at 5 years was infl uenced by: disease status at ASCT (55% if 1\u00baCR vs 0% if \u22652\u00baCR/PR/ refractory disease, p<0,0001), leucocyte count at diagnosis (p<0,0001, without a signifi cant cut-off), ethiologic classifi cation (53% if \"de novo\"AML vs 19% if secondary AML, p=0,002) and age of recipient (60% if \u226440 years old vs 45% if older, p=0,031). Stem cell source, conditioning regimen or cytogenetic risk had no signifi cance in univariable analysis. Relapse was infl uenced by the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) at time of ASCT (p=0,03, with available data in 47, since 1997) and by a CD34 cells count >3x10 6 /kg (p=0,04, with available data in 49, only if PB as stem cell source). Conclusions: ASCT is an effective procedure of cure in AML patients (global RFS of 48% at 5 years), even in high cytogenetic risk(38% with no signifi cant difference),offering its best outcomes in young patients diagnosed of de novo AML without hyperleucocytosis, who have undergone the transplantation in 1\u00baCR since 2000. Introduction: As previously described (EBMT, Paris 2011) , at our Center we use Busulfan and Fludarabine (BuFlu) as conditioning regimen to autologous transplant (ASCT) for patients with Acute Non Lymphoid Leukaemia (ANLL) lacking an HLA matched donor or ineligible to allogeneic transplant. In this study we updated the survey of this setting of patients with new cases. Aim of the study. To assess the safety and effi cacy of combination of chemotherapy with i.v.Busulfan (Bu) and Fludarabine (Flu) in a setting of patients with ANLL and ineligible to allogeneic transplant. Patients and Methods: From June 2008 to November 2011, we used a conditioning regimen with Flu (120 mg/sm) and myeloablative dose i.v. BU (12.8 mg/bw) (BuFlu) in 21 consecutive patients (9 females and 12 males; median age: 39,9 years, r. 6-59 yy) with ANLL who received ASCT. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all patients signed an appropriate informed consent. At time of transplant, disease status was: 18 patients in fi rst complete remission (CR), 3 in second CR. Patients were classifi ed at high risk (30% of evaluable patients) when the white blood cell count at diagnosis was higher that 30\u00d710 9 /l and/or cytogenetic and/or molecular status was unfavorable and/or when ANLL was secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome; otherwise they were considered at standard risk. The source of hematopoietic stem cells was in all cases peripheral blood. A median number of CD34+ cells 4x10E6/Kg (r. 2-7.4) were infused. Results: All patients engrafted. Most patients did not need red blood cells (47,6%) and platelets (52,3%) transfusion therapy. Late mucositis with median onset 9 days (8-11 dd) after the stem cell infusions (28,5% and fever (90,4% WHO 2) were the most important complications observed during the aplasia. The overall median time for absolute neutrophil count (>0.5x10E9/l) was 16 days (r.12-20 dd) and for platelet count (>30x10E9/l) was 15 days (r.12-22 dd). The median duration of hospitalization was 28 days (r.23-34 dd). At median follow-up of 16.5 months (r. 1-41 m.), TRM was 0% while the OS and DFS was 83.1% and 82%, respectively. All relapsed patients belonged to high-risk group. Three patients died for relapse disease. Conclusions. Our data suggest that combination of BuFlu is a safe conditioning regimen for ANLL patients. It's necessary a longer follow-up to assess the effi cacy of this therapy but these preliminary results are encouraging.",

Tronnolone, R. Fo\u00e0, G. Meloni Sapienza University (Rome, IT) We describe the long-term outcome of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 406 non-M3 AML patients, treated at our Institute from 1981 to 2011 and retrospectively identifi ed by the EBMT Registry. Median age was 32 years and M/F ratio 229/177. Disease status at transplant was CR1 in 289 cases, CR2 in 75, advanced disease in 42. Autologous rescue was provided with bone marrow (BM) (66%) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (34%). Overall survival (OS) at 20 years after HCT was 46% and 40% for patients receiving HCT in CR1 and CR2 respectively (p: n.s.), with a median survival time of 165 and 30 months from transplantation. Among patients transplanted in CR1 (n. 289) the conditioning regimen mostly employed was , while the remaining received BAVC regimen (n. 80) or other schedule (n. 25). The BM/PBSC ratio was 170/119. Engraftment was obtained in 95% of patients. Leukocyte engraftment times were fastened with the use of PBSC(median 14 days, range 7-33) compared with BM (median 26 days, range 7-99). Cytogenetic/molecular data were available for 56% of the patients in CR1; of these, at diagnosis 26% had good risk features , 68% had standard risk features and 6% had poor risk features. At 20 years, actuarial OS and disease-free survival (DFS) estimates are 46% and 45% respectively. The median follow up for survivors is 114 months (range . The non-relapse mortality rate is 27%. Multivariate analysis showed a statistically signifi cant impact of conditioning regimen, number of induction cycles to achieve CR and cytogenetic/molecular good risk features on the cumulative incidence of relapse. No effect of stem cell source was documented in this analysis. Univariate analysis comparing DFS of patients with favorable biologic features with those with standard/high risk features showed a 10-year DFS of 79% vs 51% (p: 0.006). This study provides long-term follow up data in a large series of AML patients treated at a single centre, and supports the observation that long-term survival is achievable in about 1/2 of patients overall and about 2/3 of patients with good risk biological features. In particular, the promising results obtained in these latter group of patients seem to identify a selected population of Ist CR AML patients who are likely to benefi t from autologous transplantation.",

Oral form of busulfan was applied in 14 pts (group A) and intravenous form (busilvex) in 7 consecutive last pts since 2008 (group B). The median CD34+ cells infused after myeloablative schedule was 3.71x10 9 /kg in group A and 3.69 in group B. Results: The median time for ANC recovery (>0.5x10 9 /L) was in group A and B: 16 and 11.5 days, respectively. The median time for PLT recovery (>20.0x10 9 /L) was 17 days for group A and 16 days for group B. Infectious complications were developed in 10 pts from group A (mucositis -9, neutropoenic fever -7, sepsis -2) and 2 from group B (mucositis -1, neutropenic fever -2). Treatment related mortality was 4.8% (1 pt from group A with sepsis in aplastic period). The period of hospitalization was 33 days in group A and 30 days in group B. There were 7 relapses in group A and 1 relapse in group B; 7 pts from group A are alive and they are still in CHR; all pts from group B (7) are alive and all are in CHR. The median time of survival and survival without relapse in group A is 2.9 and 2.8 years, respectively. These parameters in group B are following: median survival -1.2 years and median survival without relapse -also 1.2 years. The OS and DFS in group A were both 50% but in group B were 100% and 85.7%, respectively. Conclusions: The comparison of oral and intravenous form of busulfan as component of myeloablative schedule before AHSCT in pts with AML shows high effeciveness and more favorable toxicity profi le of busilvex, especially with signifi cant reduction of severe mucositis.",

However, it remains uncertain whether the FLT3/ ITD impacts outcome after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

For 203 patients, we had information regarding the existence (88) or absence (115) of nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene mutation. ITDpositive patients had higher white cell counts at diagnosis (54 vs 12.5\u00d710 9 /l; p<0.0001) and more slow remitters (22% vs 11%; p=0.04).

R\u00fcsges-Wolter, B. Mansouri Taleghani, B.U. Mueller, T. Pabst University Hospital (Berne, CH) Background: Autologous stem cell transplantation is widely used to consolidate fi rst remission in patients with AML. An important modifi cation in the last decade has been the transition of the stem cell source from bone marrow to peripheral blood. Whereas this shift has facilitated the collection procedure, it may also imply negative consequences, such as the recruitment of leukemic cells in the graft by the mobilization procedure ultimately leading to relapse of the disease. Therefore, the stem cell mobilizing capacity of AML patients is considered controversial, since both leukemic and normal progenitors are CD34+ and can be concomitantly mobilized. Methods: We determined the prognostic signifi cance of the level of circulating CD34+ cells at the day of autologous stem cell collection in 78 consecutive AML patients in fi rst remission in a single academic center. Patients were stratifi ed into two groups with a cut-off of 60'000 CD34+ cells/ml peripheral blood. We hypothesized that a decreased ability to mobilize stem cells refl ects a chemotherapy-induced reduction in the number of normal and leukemic stem cells and that this might ultimately translate into a more favorable outcome in AML patients with less than 60'000 peripheral CD34+ cells. Results: We observed that patients mobilizing more than 60'000 CD34+ cells per ml had, in fact, both shorter overall survival (P = 0.0274) and time to progression (P=0.0014). This was mainly caused by an increased risk of relapse in AML patients mobilizing more than 60'000 CD34+ cells/ml. Patient characteristics at diagnosis did not differ between the two groups. High levels of CD34+ cells were an independent marker for both shorter overall survival and time to progression in a multivariate analysis that included sex, age, leukocytes and LDH at diagnosis, cytogenetics and the molecular mutations in the FLT3, CEBPA and NPM1 genes. Conclusion: Our results indicate that in AML patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation in fi rst remission relapse rate was increased and overall survival was shorter for those patients with high levels of mobilized peripheral CD34+ cells. Consequently, our data suggest that stringent guidelines should be established when autografting AML patients using peripheral blood stem cells, and that there must be particular caution against performing autologous transplantations in AML patients with high levels of circulating peripheral CD34+ cells.",

However, comparative outcome data with longer established centers have not been reported. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of matched-sibling allogeneic HCT between EMBMT and European countries within EBMT from 2003-2009 among adult acute myeloid leukemia patients (pts) in CR1 using myeloablative conditioning. A total of 440 EMBMT and 1984 EBMT pts met these criteria. The 2 populations were different regarding patient, disease and transplant characteristics with notably a younger age in EMBMT pts. We were able to match 431 pts from 8 EMBMT centers with 431 pts from 27 European EBMT centers according to age (years, (range)) (EMBMT=31.4 (18-56); EBMT 31.8 (18-56), p=0.99), FAB subtype, cell source, and interval from diagnosis to allograft. There was no difference in cytogenetic risk groups or recipient gender. However, male recipients transplanted at EMBMT centers received less allografts from female donors (18% vs. 25% p=0.03). Also, EMBMT recipients as well as donors were more likely to be CMV seropositive (89% vs. 62%; p<0.001) and (89% vs. 52%; p<0.001), respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence (RI) were (NRM: EMBMT=16% vs. EBMT=11%; p=0.07), (RI: EMBMT=13% vs. EBMT 19%; p=0.053) . Notably, the 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were extremely similar between the 2 groups (LFS: EMBMT=70\u00b12% vs. EBMT=69\u00b13%; p=0.97), (OS: EMBMT=74\u00b12% vs. EBMT=73\u00b12%; p=0.81) . Interestingly, despite a higher putative consanguinity in EMBMT centers, the incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV was similar between both datasets (EMBMT=30% vs. EBMT=25%; p=0.1) . Similarly, no difference in the 2-year incidence of chronic GVHD was noted (EMBMT=40% vs. EBMT=46%; p=0.14). Finally, within EMBMT centers, the 3-year OS was signifi cantly better for more experienced centers (>50 allografts) (76 vs. 65%, p=0 .05) likely attributed to a lower RI (11 vs. 23%; p=0 .02) since no signifi cant difference in NRM (p=0.7) was observed. Overall, despite the differences in socioeconomics, health resources and transplant experience, matched-sibling allogeneic HCT outcomes in emerging centers in the Eastern Mediterranean region appear similar to European EBMT centers.",

The purpose of this pilot study has been to extend the use of haplo-SCT to patients aged > 55 years and/or unfi t for myeloablative conditioning because of comorbidities. Materials and Methods: 15 patients with median age of 59 yrs (41-71) with very highrisk AML (resistant to 1st line therapy, MRD+ at the end of consolidation, secondary leukemia, molecular and/or cytogenetics, extramedullary disease, auto SCT failure) underwent G-CSF primed bone marrow transplant (BMT) from haploidentical family donor. Out of the 15 patients, 7 were in CR1, 5 in CR2 and 3 with active disease. Twelve of 15 patients were conditioned with a chemotherapy based regimen consisting of Thiotepa (5 mg/Kg/day on day -6), once daily i.v. Busulphan (3.2 mg/Kg/day on days -4 and -3) and Fludarabine (50 mg/m 2 /day on days -5, -4 and -3): TBF-ric protocol. 14 patients received an identical GvHD prophylaxis consisting of pretransplant ATG combined with CSA, MTX, MMF and Basiliximab (an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody), MMF was deleted in 1 patient with extramedullary disease at transplant. Donors (mismatched at 2 or 3 HLA loci) were primed with G-CSF at 4 mcg/Kg/d for 7 consecutive days. BM was harvested on day 0 and infused unmanipulated. Five CMV+ patients received graft from CMV-donor. Results : The median number of total nucleated, CD34+ and CD3+ cells infused was 6.9 (4-13.2)x10 8 /kg, 1.95 (0.74-4.8 )x10 6 /Kg and 2.8 (0.87-6.7)x10 7 /Kg, respectively. The cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil engraftment was 100% at 30 days with full donor chimerism, median of 20 (16-24) days. Acute GVHD was absent or just grade I in 10 patients (66%) and the CI of III-IV grade acute GVHD was 13% (2 patients). Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 1 (8%) out of 13 evaluable patients. For all patients, the 1 and 3-year CI of TRM was 24%; the 1 and 3 year CI of relapse was 8% and 25%. The 1 and 3year probability of OS was 66% and of DFS 50%. Conclusions: RIC-Haploidentical transplant using G-CSF primed, unmanipulated BM is correlated with high engraftment rate, low incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, low TRM and favourable outcome in patients ineligible for conventional allo SCT.",

Parma, P. Pioltelli, E. Terruzzi, S. Bozzani, E. Pogliani Ospedale S. Gerardo (Monza, IT) Association of intravenous (i.v.) Busulfan and Fludarabine (Bu-Flu) is widely employed in conditioning regimen for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Nevertheless safety and effi cacy of these regimens are not actually well defi ned. Aim of the study: Here we present our experience with the following Bu-Flu myeloablative conditioning regimen: Busulfan i.v. 0,8 mg/Kg x 4/daily from day -5 to day -2 associated to Fludarabin 30 mg/m 2 once a day from day -5 to day -2. Anti Thymocite Globulin (ATG) 3,75 mg/Kg at day -3 and -2 has been added in Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) transplants. We performed 30 HSCT (15 from MUD and 15 from sibling donor) during the last three years employing Bu-Flu as conditio-ning regimen. All the patients (pts) were affected by hematologic malignancy and specifi cally from: Acute Myeloid Leukemia: 12 patients pts, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoblastic Lymphoma: 9 pts; Myelodisplasia: 6 pts; Myelofi brosis: 2 pts; Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma:1 pts. Remissional status was: complete remission for 17 pts, partial remission for 5 pts and stable or active disease for 6 pts. Results: 24/30 (80%) pts are still alive, 23/30 (77%) pts are in complete remission. 6/30 (18%) pts died: 4 (13%) for transplant related mortality (TRM) and 2 for relapse. We observe severe mucositis (WHO grade 3 or 4) in 12/30 (40%) pts and low-moderate mucositis (WHO grade [1] [2] in 14/30 (47%) pts. Incidence of grade 2-4 acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) was 5/30 (17%) pts with 2 related death and incidence of chronic GvHD was 6/30 (20%) (2 extended and 4 limited) . 24/30 (80%) pts experienced fever in neutropaenia, but only 4 of them had pneumonia with 2 related deaths. After median time of observation of 18 months overall survival (OS) is 80%, and Disease Free Survival (DFS) 77%. Median of OS and DFS is not still reached. Conclusion: in our experience Bu-Flu regimen is safe. The major side effects are mucositis of different entity and fever. We observed a low incidence of TRM, severe infections and acute GvHD. Also DFS and chronic GvHD had a low incidence and OS is good, but the median time of follow-up is still too short for these last conclusions.",

Corti, J. Peccatori, A. Assanelli, F. Ciceri, M. Bernardi San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, IT) Background: The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) increases with age, being median age at diagnosis 65-70 years (y). Allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only curative strategy for high risk AML and MDS. However, in elderly patients (pts) an alternative donor is not considered a standard option. Aim: To present a retrospective analysis of outcome of alloSCT from any donor source in a fi t population of pts aged over 60 transplanted at our center. Materials and Methods: Sixty-two pts older than 60 received alloSCT for high risk AML/MDS from a matched related, matched unrelated, haploidentical or cord blood donor at our Institute in period 2002-2011. We selected for this analysis those with a HCT-IC (Sorror) co-morbidity score 0-2 (N=28). Characteristics of these pts are summarized in the table. Results: Twenty-seven pts engrafted and were evaluable at day 30 (96%). Thirteen (49%) developed aGvHD; 8 grade 1-2, 5 grade 3-4; 10 (48%) out of 21 evaluable pts had cGvHD. Transplant related mortality (TRM) was 25% overall (7 pts), being infection and GVHD major causes of death. Variables associated with increase of TRM: PS(ECOG) over 1 vs 0 (50% vs12% at 3y, p=0.05) and aGvHD grade 3-4 vs 1-2 (100% vs 45%, p=0.02). Relapse incidence was 35% with a median time to relapse of 234 days (114-931): presence of disease at SCT was associated with a signifi cant risk of relapse at 3y (33% vs 17% p=0.03) while pts with cGvHD showed a trend to less relapse. After a median follow-up of 842 days, 15 patients (54%) are alive, 13 in complete remission (47%) and 2 (7%) currently receiving salvage treatment for disease relapse. Estimated event free survival (EFS) at 3y is 38%, median 808 days . Variables associated with signifi cant worse EFS at 3y: presence vs absence of disease at SCT (11% vs 46%, p=0.02) and aGvHD grade 3-4(0% vs 32% p=0.01); pts with cGvHD showed a trend to better EFS. Estimated overall survival (OS) at 3y is 45%, median 945 days .",

There were 30 males and 10 females with a median age of 52 years (32-66). Diseases characteristics were: progressive or refractory disease after rescue treatment for fi rst relapse (n=21), early relapse without any further salvage therapy (n=4), and primary induction failure (n=4). The series also included 7 patients with high risk MDS and 4 patients in fi rst CR but having a very poor prognosis. The FLAMSA regimen included Fludarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2/d), cytarabine (2 g/m\u00b2/d) and amsacrine (100mg/m\u00b2/d) from day -12 to day -9. After 3 days of rest, a RIC regimen was administered. In 28 patients, the RIC regimen included 4 Gy. TBI, ATG 5 mg/kg total dose, and cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg in case of matched related donors, and 60 mg/kg for unrelated or mismatched donors. In the remaining 12 patients, TBI was replaced by I.V. Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/d for 4 days. Eighteen patients were transplanted using an HLA identical sibling donor, and 22 received transplant from an unrelated donor. After allo-HSCT, 39 patients (97.5%) engrafted. In the CR group (n=4), after a median follow-up of 5 months (range, all patients were still alive in CR at last follow-up. In the remaining 36 patients, 9 patients developed acute GVHD \u22652 with a cumulative incidence at 3 months of 18% (95%CI, 10-26). At day 90 post HSCT, 23 (64%) patients achieved hematological CR, and 14 of the 23 remained in CR at last follow-up. After a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 1-60), the 2-years probability of OS was 30% (95%CI, , and the 2-years probability of PFS was 29% (95%CI, 17-50). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year was 25% (95%CI, (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . Interestingly, none of the patients who received Busulfan instead of TBI, relapsed. The cumulative incidence of TRM at 3 months and 1 year were 14% (95%CI, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) and 22% (95%CI, (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) , respectively. In the multivariate analysis there was a signifi cantly worsened PFS in patients who received transplant from a mismatched donor (HR=3.6; [95%CI, 1.3-10] p=0.01). Also, when considering disease relapse, there was a highly signifi cant impact of the type of RIC regimen (in favour of a FLAMSA regimen without TBI (HR=0; [95%CI, p<0.0001). A modifi ed FLAMSA regimen incorporating I.V. Busulfan instead of TBI is likely to allow better long-term disease control, warranting prospective evaluation.",

Methods: Eligible patients were adults with AML in First Complete Remission (CR1) and candidate for a BuCy2 conditioning prior to Allo-BMT. In all patients, the Bu AUC was measured each day based on a limited sampling design (on-line analysis of 3 blood samples per day by on-site PK facilities) and a Bayesian calculation. Patients received Busilvex\u00ae 3.2 mg/kg on the fi rst day and subsequent daily Bu doses were adjusted (on the previous day AUC result) in order to achieve the middle of the therapeutic area (AUC = 5200 \u03bcM.min). Results: Preliminary PK results on 21 patients are available. After dose adjustment, most of patients reached the desired AUC range on a daily basis. The mean AUCs were 5168, 5839 and 5019 \u03bcM.min on days 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Based on the cumulated AUC over the 4 days of Bu treatment, 19 of 21 patients (90 %) achieved the targeted window. Short term clinical outcomes were available in 14 patients (19.3-51.9 years, KPS: 90-100%). The median time to onset of neutropenia was 3 days. Median time to reach neutrophil and platelets engraftment was 19 days and 15 days, respectively, and there was no primary graft failure. The hepatic tolerance was excellent with no VOD and no treatment related mortality up to day+28. Conclusions: This study showed that AUC intensifi cation based on a PK-based dose adjustment is feasible and enables to target the upper area of the therapeutic window. High and controlled exposures to Bu following once daily doses were achieved in AML patients without any major safety concerns. Long-term outcomes are needed to conclude on this new therapeutic option benefi t in AML patients at high risk of relapse.",

No signifi cant differences were observed between the M6 patients and the paired M0-M5 patients in the 5-year OS and progression-free survival (PFS), 3-year cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse and 3-year CI of non-relapse mortality (NRM); however, the 5-year OS, PFS and the 3-year CI of relapse were signifi cantly worse in the M7 patients than those of the paired M0-M5 patients PFS, year CI-relapse and CI-NRM of the M7 patients and the paired M0-M5 patients was 12% and 34% (P<0.001), 17% and 33% (P<0.01), 47% and 33% (P<0.05) and 36% and 35%, respectively).

Adverse-risk and undefi ned karyotypes were based on the NCCN guidelines 2011. Clinical correlates and prognostic relevance of mosaicism were evaluated in 163 AML patients (adverse-risk karyotypes were 69 and undefi ned karyotypes were 94) who all underwent induction and consolidation chemotherapies and fi nally, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). And each was divided into two groups either with mosaicism or not. Results: Seventy patients were with more than 10 percent (e.g. More than 2 out of 20 metaphases analyzed) of the intermediaterisk karyotype mosaicism and 93 were without mosaicism. Between the two groups, age, sex, induction chemotherapy cycles to achieve CR and total chemotherapy cycles before HSCT, HSCT type and source and intensity were not signifi cantly different (p>0.05). Multivariate analyses identifi ed intermediate-risk karyotype mosaicism in patients with adverse and undefi ned karyotype signifi cantly correlates with better OS(p=0.005) and DFS (p=0.019). Conclusion: Combined intermediate-risk karyotype mosaicism could make better prognostic expectancy in adverse-risk karyotype patients in AML. Cytogenetic mosaicism at initial diagnosis may be a valuable infl uential factor to transplant outcome.",

There is no standard of care for these patients. We retrospectively analyzed 54 consecutive patients with AML relapsing after Allo-SCT between 2000 and 2010. The objectives were to evaluate effi cacy of salvage therapies. Median age was 48 years, 61% had been transplanted in CR1 or 2 and 80% were prepared using a RIC regimen. Thirty-two patients (59%) relapsed within 6 months after allo-SCT. Twenty-four patients (44%) received intensive salvage treatment, 17 (32%) received non-intensive chemotherapy (Low dose Cytarabine (n=7), oral Methotrexate, 6-Mercaptopurine, Etoposide and/or Melphalan (n=5), Azacytidine (n=3)), 13 (24%) received supportive care only. Among the 24 patients who received intensive salvage, 17 (71%) achieved CR, 6 failed and 1 died early. One died early (induction death: 4%) and 2 additional patients died in CR at 36 and 62 days. Sensitive disease at allo-SCT was the only factor associated with CR achievement after intensive salvage (CR: 83%; others: 33%, p=0.038). No patients treated without intensive salvage achieved CR. Median OS was 3.4 months in the whole cohort. Factors infl uencing OS in univariate analyses were: age < 50 (median OS: 5.1 versus 1.9 months, p=0.039) time to relapse after Allo-SCT > 6months (median OS: 7.7 versus 1.9 months, p=0.014) and intensive salvage (median OS: 7.6 versus 1.8 months, p=0.005). By multivariate analysis, only time to relapse after Allo-SCT (HR: 3.8 [1.6-9.1] ) and PS at relapse (HR: 2.3 [1.1-4.4] ) independently infl uenced OS. Median RFS of the 17 patients in CR after intensive salvage relapse was 9.4 months. After intensive salvage, 6 patients in CR were given a second allo-SCT. Four died from relapse and 2 are still alive in CR at 12 and 39 months after the relapse (3 and 7 months after the second allo-SCT).",

To date little is known about the use of FLT3 inhibitors in the peri-transplantation setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Six patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML with relapsed or refractory disease on standard therapy were treated with the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib (400 to 800 mg per day), one before, three after and two concomitantly to allogeneic HSCT. All patients received myelo-ablative conditioning. Results: One patient was refractory to induction chemotherapy and received Sorafenib monotherapy consecutively, leading to complete molecular remission (CMR). He then underwent allogeneic HSCT without concomitant Sorafenib and has been in sustained CMR. Two patients experienced an early hematologic relapse after allogeneic HSCT (2 and 4 months post-HSCT respectively), both then started Sorafenib treatment, one in combination with donor lymphocyte infusion, leading to sustained CMR. One patient was refractory to induction chemotherapy and underwent allogeneic HSCT in disease progression. Sorafenib was started concomitantly to conditioning, leading to CMR. One patient experienced an early relapse 3 months after autologous stem cell transplantation and received reinduction chemotherapy without response to treatment. After initiation of Sorafenib he achieved CMR and underwent allogeneic HSCT two months later, concomitantly to Sorafenib treatment. Two months post-HSCT he died of disease progression. One patient relapsed after induction chemotherapy and underwent allogeneic HSCT in disease progression, leading to morphologic CR but persistence of FLT3 mutation. Sorafenib therapy was initiated but the patient died shortly afterwards from RSV infection. No dose-limiting toxicity was recorded. Conclusion: Out of six patients treated with Sorafenib in the peri-transplantation setting, four remain in CMR (lasting for 28, 11, 9 and 0,5 months respectively) , one died of disease progression and one of infectous complications. We conclude that FLT3 inhibition in combination with allogeneic HSCT is a promising therapeutic approach, by combining the impact of molecular targeted therapy with anti-leucemic action of the donor immune system.",

We retrospectively analysed outcome of patients with relapsed AML after aloSCT at our centre with the aim to evaluate the potential role of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), combination of chemotherapy (CHT) and DLI or 2nd aloSCT in treatment of relapsed AML after aloSCT. Patients and Methods: From 10/2001 to 10/2011 149 pts underwent aloSCT for AML, 36 pts (24%) relapsed and 22 of them were subsequently treated for relapse. Median of age of treated pts was 45 years (range,28-63 years) and at the time of aloSCT, 12 pts (55%) were in the 1st complete remission (CR) of AML and 10 pts (45%) beyond 1st CR. 13 pts (59%) underwent aloSCT after myeloablative and 9 pts (41%) after reducedintensity conditioning (36% with related and 64% with unrelated donor). Source of stem cell was peripheral blood in 72% and bone marrow in 28% of cases. The median of time to relapse after aloSCT was 7 months (range, 2-30 months). Treatment of relapse was assessed individually and 9 pts (41%) received DLI, 10 pts (45%) were treated with CHT and DLI and 3 pts (14%) received CHT and 2nd aloSCT. DLI were administered at escalating doses. Results: 9 pts received after relapse DLI. The median of applied doses was 2 (range, 1-4 doses) and 1 patient (11%) achieved CR, which lasts for 9 months. The median of overall survival (OS) after relapse among DLI treated pts was 3 months (range, 1-11 months) . Among 10 pts treated by CHT and DLI 7 pts (70%) achieved CR but subsequently 5 of them relapsed and died, 1 patient died in CR due to GVHD and only 1 patient is alive in CR for 54 months. The median of disease free survival among CR pts was 5 months (range, 3-54 months). The median of OS after relapse among CHT and DLI treated pts was 6 months (range, 1-50 months) for all pts and 8 months (range, 5-50 months) for CR pts. 3 pts achieved after CHT CR and underwent 2nd aloSCT. 2 pts died 5 and 15 months (TRM, relapse) after 2nd aloSCT and 1 patient is alive in CR for 24 months after 2nd aloSCT. Conclusion: In spite of relatively small number of pts our data suggest that pts with relapsed AML after aloSCT have dismal prognosis using currently available treatment approaches. In future, incorporation of earlier treatment intervention, novel drug and immunomodulation approaches could improve this poor prognosis.",

Svoboda, K. Steinerov\u00e1, P. Jindra, D. Lys\u00e1k, S. Vokurka, V. Koza Charles University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Background: Outcome of patients (pts) over 60 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with intensive chemotherapy is poor. To improve treatment results reduced-intensity transplantation (RIT) was establish as a part of standard treatment strategy for pts aged 60 to70 years with AML in our centre from 2003. With the aim to evaluate transplant feasibility and the role of RIT in the treatment of pts aged 60 to 70 years with AML we analysed outcome of such pts in our centre since 2003. As a part of analysis we also tried to evaluate the role of RIT using unrelated donor. Patients and Methods: from 1/2003 to 10/2011 AML was diagnosed in 131 pts aged 60 to 70 years. 83 pts were intensively treated and 43 pts with median of age 62 years (range, 60-68 years) with AML in 1.CR (28 pts) or AML beyond 1.CR (15 pts) underwent RIT (37% HLA identical related, 40% HLA matched unrelated, 23% HLA mismatched unrelated). Source of stem cells was peripheral blood and the median of infused CD 34+ cells was 5,2x10 6 /kg (range, 1,7-14,9x10 6 /kg). The conditioning regimen consisted of fl udarabine (30 mg/m 2 for 4 days) and melphalan (140 mg/m 2 for 1 day). CsA and methotrexate were used as GVHD prophylaxis. Pts transplanted from related or unrelated donors did not differ for any signifi cant variables except for younger age of donors and higher amount of infused CD34+ cells in unrelated RIT. Results: The main reasons of impossibility to implement RIT in treatment of older pts with AML were death during remission induction treatment, severe comorbidities, non-availability of donor and refusal of RIT but 52% of intensively treated pts with AML eventually underwent RIT. All pts fully engrafted and achieved complete remission (CR). 15 pts (35%) developed aGVHD (4 pts grade III-IV) and among 36 evaluable pts 20 (56%) of them developed chGVHD (8 limited, 12 extensive). With median follow-up 28 months (range, 2-92 months) 25 pts (58%) are alive (24 pts in CR). 6 pts (14%) relapsed and 5 of them died. 13 pts (30%) died due to NRM and 4 (9%) of them till day 100 after RIT. The estimated probabilities of 3-years EFS and OS are 52% and 59% without any signifi cant infl uence of donor type. Conclusion: our data show that half of intensively treated pts aged 60 to 70 years with AML were able to undergo RIT and that RIT even in case of unrelated or HLA mismatched donor is associated with acceptable NRM and encouraging disease control of unfavourable AML.",

McGuirk University of Kansas Medical Center (Westwood, US) The prognosis of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (Allo SCT) is extremely poor. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) has been used in patients with high-risk Myelodysplastic syndrome and de novo AML with varying degrees of success. We treated eight patients (median age 48y; range 21-68y) at our institution with relapsed AML after allo-SCT with decitabine (20 mg/m 2 IV days 1-5 every 28 days) and withdrawal of immunosuppressants with or without donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) between July 2009 and July 2011. Relapse of AML after allo-SCT was defi ned as loss of donor chimerism and morphologic or cytogenetic relapse of primary disease. Median time to relapse after allo-SCT was 180 days (range 89-300 days). Five out of 8 patients (62.5%) developed morphologic evidence of relapse (>5% blasts; range 6%-88%) and 3 patients (37.5%) had cytogenetic relapse with falling donor chimerism (bone marrow blast <5%). Decitabine was given for a median of 2 cycles (range 1-6). Three patients received planned DLI after 2 cycles of decitabine. Five out of 8 patients (62.5%; 95% CI 24.5 to 91.5%) are still alive at the time of writing this report with a median follow up of 100 days (range 56-204 days). All surviving patients attained 100% donor chimerism (4 patients after decitabine alone and 1 with decitabine followed by DLI) after a median of 60 days (range 30-180 days) or after a median of 2 cycles of decitabine. Four out of 5 surviving patients developed graft versus host disease (GVHD). Three patients developed GVHD after 2 cycles of decitabine without DLI. Of the 5 surviving patients, 3 patients had cytogenetic relapse with mixed chimerism (<5% blasts in the marrow) and 2 patients had morphologic early relapse (Marrow blasts 5-19%) at the time of diagnosis. None of the patients (n=3) with frank relapse (>20% blasts) survived. Decitabine was well tolerated in this cohort. In our experience, decitabine with or without DLI was effective in patients with AML in early relapse after allo-SCT. This was a retrospective chart review of a small cohort with a short duration P433 Once-daily IV busulfan administration with therapeutic drug monitoring showed superior outcome compared to the conventional 4-times a day busulfan administration in BuFluVP conditioning regimen for paediatric ALL/ABL patients JW Lee, HJ Kang, NH Kim, H Kim, KD Park, HY Shin, HS Ahn Seoul National University College of Medicine (Seoul, KR) Introduction: Conditioning regimens for pediatric ALL usually includes total body irradiation (TBI), but TBI may result in serious sequelae. Recently, a reduced toxicity myeloablative regimen using busulfan and fl udarabine showed promising results, and etoposide was used in addition for its anti-leukemic effect in many studies. Busulfan has a narrow therapeutic range, and it shows high pharmacokinetic variability even when intravenous (IV) formulation is used. Due to this pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and dose adjustment of bulsulfan have been recommended to improve the clinical outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients and Methods: We studied patients who underwent HSCT using a busulfan/fl udarabine/etoposide regimen at Seoul National University Children's Hospital from September 2005 to September 2010. Twenty patients (Bu4 group) received IV busulfan (0.8 mg/kg/dose for patients >12 kg and 1.1 mg/kg/ dose for \u226412 kg, 4 times/day, d-8~d-5) without TDM and targeted busulfan (120 mg/m 2 for patients \u22651 year and 80 mg/m 2 for <1 year as the fi rst dose, once daily, d-8~d-5) was used for 14 patients from March 2009 (Bu1TDM group). Results: The diagnoses were ALL in 27 and ABL in 7 patients. Median age was 6.0 years (range 0.9-16.6 years). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients (20.0%) of the Bu4 group, but engraftment was achieved in all patients of the Bu1TDM group (P=0.126). Veno-occlusive disease developed in 4 patients (20.0%) of the Bu4 group and 1 patient (7.1%) of the Bu1TDM group (P=0.226). Three patients (15.0%) of the Bu4 group and 1 patient (7.1%) of the Bu1TDM group died of treatment-related mortality (TRM), and a total area under the curve (AUC) of the 1 patient of Bu1TDM group was 79,469 ug*h/L. Event free survival (EFS) of patients of the Bu1TDM group was signifi cantly higher than that of the Bu4 group (92.9% vs 58.5%, P=0.050). In patients of the Bu1TDM group, the total dose of busulfan administered for 4 days ranged from 249.9 mg/m 2 to 523.0 mg/m 2 (median 403.1 mg/m 2 ) with median total AUC of 74,010 ugxh/L (range 70,815-83,160 ugxh/L). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that once daily IV busulfan administration with TDM showed superior outcome compared to the conventional 4-times a day administration in BuFluVP conditioning regimen for pediatric ALL/ABL patients.",

AlJurf KFSHRC, Riyadh (Riyadh, SA) Background: PhIladelphia positive (Ph+) Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid (AML) and biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) are relatively rare with young age and allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allo-SCT). Our population in Saudi Arabia is relatively young with large families and high consanguinity making myeloablative conditioning (MAC) the preferred modality and sibling donors the most common source. With increased use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), more patients are being transplanted. Relevant data are very limited from the region. Patients and Methods: Between 1999 and 2010, prospectively collected data of 23 (8 females, 15 male) patients were analyzed. Median age was 27 (14-54); 12 were >14-<30. 18 had PreB-, 2 T-ALL, 2 AML and 1 BAL. 9 had additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA); 5 untested. All received MAC (Cy-TBI for all except BU-CY for 2 AML). GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine and methotrexate in all. All donors (23) were siblings; 21 were full match. 65% received peripheral blood (PB) stem cells, 20 were in CR1, 2 in CR2 and 1 in relapse. In combination with different chemo-inductions, 11 received Imatinib, 4 Dasatinib and 2 both and in 2 the use of TKI was unknown. Death in remission considered as a competing risk for relapse. Results: Cumulative transplant related mortality (TRM) at 3.8 mowas 5.2 %. Acute GVHD occurred in 36% (95% CI 34-39%), cGVHD in 35% (95% CI33-37%). Median follow up of survivors was 24.2 mo (95% CI, .The estimated 5 years overall survival (OS) was 65.8% (95% CI, 40%-91%) without difference by age (p 0.5). There was a trend (p=0.1) of higher rate of death in remission for those \u226530 y compared to younger ones. No impact of ACA on OS/DFS (p 0.9). There was a trend (p value 0.1) of better OS for those in molecular remission at transplantation (OS 87.5%; 95% CI, 65%-110%) compared to those who were not (OS 50%) (95% CI: 11%-89%). Molecular remission (MR) was associated with lower rate of death in remission but not signifi cantly (p=0. 3) . CIR was 43.4 % (95% CI 42.9-43.9) regardless of age (p value 0.3), ACA, the molecular status at SCT, aGVHD or c-GVHD. Conclusion: Ph+ acute leukemia of different phenotypes in our relatively younger population are mostly of pre-B phenotype. AllosibSCT offers good OS with an acceptable TRM that tended to increase with age \u2265 30 y. MR before SCT has a trend to improve survival thatneeds to be confi rmed. ACA has no impact on outcome in the presence of MR.",

Chaudari KFSHRC, Riyadh (Riyadh, SA) Background: allo-SCT from matched sibling donors remains the best option in high risk ALL. The majority of population in Saudi Arabia is young and the chance of fi nding sibling donor is high (68%) due to large family size and consanguinity; a setting that may help reduce transplant related mortality (TRM) and reduce graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Patients and Methods: 258 (75 female, 183 male) transplanted between 1991-2011 at KFSHRC with complete data set were reviewed. 64% were PreB-, 33% T-ALL and 9(3%) unknown. Median age was 19.9y (14-54); 86% were <30y. 144 were in fi rst remission (CR1) with high risk features: high count, induction failure, adverse cytogenetics (CyG). 77 were in CR2, 35(\u2265CR3). Myeloablative conditioning was mostly Cy-TBI, donors were siblings in 99% (bone marrow (BM) in 68%; peripheral blood (PB) in 31%) and were fully matched in 96%. GVHD prophylaxis included Cyclosporine and Methotrexate. Results: At a median 40 Mo follow up, 5y OS was 50% and was better (p 0.001) for CR1 (62.6%) vs. CR2 (41.8%) vs. \u2265CR3 (16.6%) ; no difference (P value 0.8) with age < or >30 y, phenotype (p=0.2), CyG (p\u22650.05), aGVHD(p=0.2) or cGVHD (p=0.5). DFS was 44% and was higher (57.5%) in CR1 vs. 34% in CR2 vs. 11% for\u2265 CR3 (p\u22640.001). T-ALL had a trend of better DFS (p= 0.08). No difference with CyG (p >0.05) or age groups (p 0.4). The rate of aGVHD was 42.9% with 5.5% 100-day mortality as a competing event. The cumulative TRM was low at 9%. cGVHD occurred in 29.5% and was higher with PB source (p=0.003). No impact of c-GVHD on OS (P 0.3). The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 34.9% (95% CI; 34%-36%). Death in remission as a competing risk for CIR was 21.5% (95%CI; 16-27); was higher (p=0.001) with aGVHD not age (p 0.7)or cGVHD(p 0.3). cGVHD had a lower CIR (27.1%) vs. no cGVHD(41%)(P = 0.01). Competing risk regression modeling by Fine & Gray showed that cGVHD lowered the hazard ratio (HR) of relapse to 0.58 (p 0.01). a-GVHD also lowered relapse HR to 0.55 (p=0.006) but with markedly increased HR of death in remission (HR 2.9; p\u22640.001). Conclusion: In this study, allosib-SCT in relatively young patients from families with high rate of consanguinity is associated with relatively low TRM and low cGVHD . Relapse remains the commonst cause of failure especially in \u2265CR2. cGVHD improves relapse risk and a-GVHD increased death in remission 3 fold Further improvement in GVHD prophylaxis and supportive care is needed.",

Stamatovic, B. Balint, O. Tarabar, M. Elez, Z. Tatomirovic, O. Tasic Radic, B. Todoric Zivanovic, S. Marjanovic, M. Malesevic, Lj. Tukic Military Medical Academy (Belgrade, RS) Background: Treatment outcome of patients (pts) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) depends on several factors: patient age, immunophenotype and clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features of the disease. Despite intensifi ed chemotherapy, adolescents and young adults with ALL still have lower rates of survival than younger children. Majority of reports published so far indicate that these pts have a better outcome when treated with pediatric, rather than adult therapeutic protocols. Role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in fi rst complete remission (CR) in this cohort of pts is still controversial. Aim: Estimation of treatment outcome in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 30 years with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated in our adult hematology department either with conventional approach or allogeneic SCT. Patients and Methods: Since 1989 till 2011. a total of 82 pts, male/female 56/26, aged 15 to 30 (average age 20), with newly diagnosed ALL were treated with adult chemotherapy protocol and allogeneic SCT. In the postremission setting, pts were divided in two gruops: with \"donor\" (35 pts) in whom we have performed allogeneic SCT in CR1 from idenstical sibling and with \"no donor\" (47 pts) who were treated with conventional maintenance therapy. With respect to disease risk parameters (standard vs. high risk), age (15-18 vs. 19-30) , white blood count (>30x10 9 /l vs. <30x10 9 /l), time to achieve remission (below 28 days vs. above 28 days) groups \"donor\" vs. \"no donor\" did not differ. Results: For the whole cohort, the remission rate was 91,46%, iduction failure 8,54%, early deaths 3,65% and relapse rate 56,09%. After a median observation time of 8 years the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of pts who were treated with allogeneic SCT in CR1 were superior in comparisson to pts who were treated with conventional therapy (OS 42, 85% vs. 25, 53%, p<0.05; DFS 54, 28% vs.29,78%, p<0.05). Relapse incidence was signifi cantly lower in the group of pts with allogeneic SCT (31,43% vs 68,08%, p<0.05). Signifi cantly better OS had pts with initial lower white blood count and those who have achieved remission in the fi rst 28 days. In this cohort of pts age had no impact on the results. Conclusion: Allogeneic SCT in CR1 is superior treatment option for adolescents and young adults with ALL in comparisson to conventional adult chemotherapy protocol, but further investigation, especially in the new target agents era is needed.",

Ghavamzadeh Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Background: The most common conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) consists of total body irradiation (TBI), especially in patients affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the use of non-TBI containing regimens has been considered in recent studies. Method: A total of 69 ALL pediatric patients aged < 15 yrs underwent HSCT in our center between 1997 and 2011. Non-TBI conditioning regimen used in this study was based on protocols approved by the center. Patients received busulfan and cyclophosphamide with or without ATG as conditioning regimen. Cyclosporine \u00b1 methotrexate was used as graft-versushost disease (GvHD) prophylaxis regimen. Stem cell sources included bone marrow in 8 (11.6%), peripheral blood in 54 (78.2%) and cord blood (CB) in 7 (10.2%). Fifty-nine patients received allo-HSCT from HLA-matched sibling donors, 4 from other related donors, 1 from an HLA-mismatched sibling donor and 5 from unrelated donors. All the patients enrolled were assessed for the survival. Results : Median age at transplantation was 10 years (2-14 years) . Sixty three out of 69 patients received transplants in complete remission. At a median follow-up of 14 months the probabilities of two-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 65.8% (SE=6.9%) and 77.2% (SE=6.5%), respectively. Acute and chronic GvHD occurred in 47 (68.1%) and 8 (14%) patients, respectively. Relapse was signifi cantly higher among patients transplanted in advanced disease status. S106 Conclusion: The study revealed an acceptable result in HSCT with non-TBI-based preparative regimens in pediatric patients with ALL. As the use of TBI-based regimens in pediatrics has a lot of side effects and is associated with general decrease in quality of their life, further comparative trials are needed to clarify the difference between two conditioning regimens in pediatric ALL.",

Park Ajou university hospital (Suwon, KR) Central nervous system (CNS) relapse is a catastrophic event in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially more common in Philadelphia chromosome positive (ph+) ALL. In patients with ph+ ALL, overall response rate and survival are signifi cantly improved by integration of imatinib as a front line therapy but imatinib has shown poor response to the CNS relapse. Here we report a ph+ ALL patient experienced complete remission (CR) of CNS relapse with dasatinb. The patient is 24 male referred from private clinic due to many blasts in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow study revealed he had acute B lymphoblastic leukemia and also Philadelphia chromosome was positive. After one cycle of hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) chemotherapy he achieved complete remission. One more cycle of hyper-CVAD and imatinib 400mg/day was given before he proceeded to allo-HSCT. HSCT was performed in molecular remission from matched related donor. He has maintained remission for 10 months since allo-HSCT. At eleven months after HSCT, the patient complained headache and serum BCR-ABL turned to positive. Bone marrow study showed 99.6% donor chimerism without evidence of leukemic recurrence.",

Three times of intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate 12mg was given but blasts persisted in the CSF. Then the patient was started on dasatinb 100mg/day. Within one week of dasatinib treatment headache was improved and BCR-ABL returned to negative within 1 month of dasatinib. The patient has been maintaining dasatinib for 8 months without recurrence and specifi c toxicity. Dasatinib 100 mg/day could achieve enough level to eradicate CNS leukemia. It may be due to better penetration to the CNS and high potency of inhibiting BCR-ABL. In ph+ ALL patients with CNS relapse, dasatinib should be the fi rst choice of treatment. S107 dose Ara-C. CD20 expression was considered positive if at least 20% of the leukemic cells express the marker. Results: Between July 2002-June 2010 a total of 83 AYA patients were identifi ed; 53(64%) were CD20 negative, 24 (32%) were CD20 positive and 6 (7%) were undetermined. 72 (87%) cleared blasts from BM by d14 and 10 (12%) patients required additional induction. Day + 28 Complete remission was achieved in all except 2 (2.4%) patients (CR-1=97.6 %). One induction death occurred in CR1. There were no signifi cant differences in distribution of high risk features between the CD20 pos or CD20-neg groups as shown in the Table 1 . There was no signifi cant impact of CD20 positivity on induction mortality or early outcomes, survivals (OS or DFS) or cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) or central nervous system (CNS) relapse. Although OS and DFS seemed better for CD20 pos yet, the difference was not statistically signifi cant (p value 0.2 and 0.2 respectively) (Table 2, Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). However, more patients (69.6%) of CD20 pos. received allo-SCT compared to only 36.5% of CD20 neg. (p value 0.012). Conclusion: In our EMRO population of AYAs with pre-B ALL and within a risk-stratifi ed unifi ed protocol of chemotherapy for standard risk and allo-SCT for high risk, no signifi cant impact of CD20 expression on early outcomes (rate of clearance of leukemic blasts, CR, induction mortality) or long term outcomes (5 Y OS, DFS and CIR or CNS relapse) . Allo-HCT may help balance any impact. Analysis of the impact of CD20 expression should cautiously be interpreted within the context of treatment given and the age of the population studied. Larger studies may help elucidate any meaningful impact.",

Papanicolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR); (2) G. Papageorgiou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) The total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen is considered the \"gold standard\" for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this retrospective study we compared the impact of TBI-and Busulfan (Bu)-based conditioning regimen on the outcome of patients (pts) allografted for ALL. One hundred fi fteen consecutive pts, aged 24 (4-58) years, underwent allo-HCT during 1990-2011. Thirty-two pts were in 1st complete remission (CR1), 20 in CR2 and 63 in advanced phase (>CR2, relapsed or refractory disease). The graft source was mainly mobilized peripheral blood, originated from 71 siblings, 44 unrelated donors (15 alternative, 1-2 ag-mismatched). TBI-based regimen (14.4Gy divided in 6 fractions over 3 days) was given in 59 and Bu-based (mainly oral, 4 mg/kg/d) in 56 pts. Cyclophosphamide (Cy) was administered at standard [P439] S108 doses (120 mg/kg) in both regimens. TBI-Cy was given in 19 CR1, 11 CR2 and 29 advanced phase pts. For the whole cohort of pts with a median follow-up 7(1-247) months, the conditioning regimen did not signifi cantly affect the outcome in terms of disease-free survival (DFS): (45% vs 30%) and non-relapse mortality (NRM): (20% vs 30%). The type of donor revealed no signifi cant impact on either DFS: 40%, 25% or NRM: 20%, 24%, for siblings and unrelated matched donors respectively). A relatively small number of pts allografted in CR1, did not have any signifi cant difference in DFS and relapse rate (RR) regarding the conditioning regimen (DFS: 63% vs 76%, RR: 24% vs 24%, for TBI and Bu-based regimens respectively, p=ns). NRM tended to be increased in TBI-based regimens (26% vs 0%, p= 0.06). In CR2, DFS and OS were similar for both regimens (39% vs 33% and 44% respectively). On the contrary, in advanced disease, TBI offered a superior DFS: 36% vs 11% and OS: 40% vs 17%, (p<0.05). In a multivariate analysis only early disease phase affected DFS favorably. Age >45, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and mismatched donors increased mortality while early disease phase, younger age, the absence of aGVHD and the presence of cGVHD were proven favorable factors in terms of OS. Overall, the type of conditioning regimen did not infl uence the outcome. NRM which was zero in early disease and Bu-based regimen, could be attributed to the small number of pts but should be taken under consideration. For pts transplanted in advanced disease TBI-based regimen offered signifi cant survival advantage with acceptable toxicity.",

Brissot, M. Labopin, G. Soci\u00e9, L. Volin, A. Rambaldi, D. Beelen, N. Kroeger, S. Lenhoff, J. Finke, J. Esteve, M. Mohty on behalf of the ALWP TKIs emerged as major drugs as part of Ph+ALL treatment armamentarium. The current survey from the ALWP of EBMT aimed to assess the outcome [OS, LFS, NRM, RI] of a cohort of 1041 Ph+ALL patients who received allo-HSCT in CR1 between 2000 and 2010. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the impact of the use of TKIs prior allo-HSCT considering the time period before and after 2007 when TKIs were made available in most EBMT centers for the treatment of adult Ph+ALL according to the European label extension for TKIs in adult Ph+ALL. 552 patients received alloHSCT from an HLA-matched related donor while 489 patients received an HLA-matched unrelated graft. 869 patients underwent a MAC regimen, while 172 received a RIC regimen (Table 1) . With a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 1-132) after alloHSCT, in the whole cohort, the 2-years OS and LFS were 54\u00b12% and 42\u00b12%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, NRM was signifi cantly infl uenced by age>37 y. in the MAC subgroup (P<0.0001, HR=1.90, 95%CI, . No signifi cant predictive factors for NRM were found in the RIC subgroup. The year of alloHSCT (\u22652007) was a strong factor predictive of an improved LFS (P=0.001, HR=0.75, 95%, 0.63-0.89), while age>42 y. was associated with a lower LFS (P=0.001, HR=1.34, 95%CI, 1.12-1.6). In the MAC alloHSCT subgroup, TBI and year of transplant \u22652007 were associated with signifi cantly improved LFS (P=0.01, HR=0.75, 95%CI, and P=0.005, HR=0.76, 95%CI, respectively) , while age>37 y. was a negative predictive factor for LFS (P=0.001, HR=1.38, 95%CI, 1.14-1.68). In the RIC alloHSCT subgroup, no signifi cantly predictive factors were found for LFS. When considering RI, multivariate analysis showed that the year of transplant \u22652007 was also associated with decreased relapse in both the MAC and RIC subgroups (P=0.003, HR=0.67, 95%CI, HR=0.50, 95%CI, respectively) . In the MAC subgroups, the use of TBI and an HLA-matched unrelated graft were found to be factors associated with decreased RI (Table 2) . This large survey suggests that the introduction of TKIs after the year 2007 within European centers, has likely improved the outcome of adult Ph+ALL patients eligible for alloHSCT. Prospective evaluation are needed since further improvement would be expected in the next few years with the wider use of minimal residual disease assessment associated to TKI-based preemptive and/or maintenance strategies.",

Borchert, K. Jost, C. Junghanss, M. Schmitt, M. Freund University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) Background: Patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoma (T-ALL/T-LBL) and failure to standard induction therapy or relapse have a poor outcome. The nucleosid analog nelarabine accumulates preferentially in T-lymphoblastic cells and has cytotoxic activity. Here we report on our experience with nelarabine in patients with relapsed T-ALL/T-LBL as induction therapy before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Patients and Methods: Five patients were treated with nelarabine before subsequent alloHSCT at our institution. The median age was 32 years (range 24-41 years). Three patients suffered from relapsed T-LBL, one patient from failure of induction chemo therapy for T-ALL and one patient from relapse of T-ALL. Nelarabine was administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/m\u00b2 on alternating days (day 1, 3, 5) . One patient received only one cycle, two cycles were given in 4 patients. AlloHSCT was performed after conditioning with 12 Gy total body irradiation in combination with VP16 (60 mg/kg bodyweight, day -3) in 3 patients or cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg bodyweight, day -3 and -2) in one patient. One patient received treosulfan (10 mg/m\u00b2, day -6 to -2) and fl udarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2, day -6 to -2) as conditioning therapy before her second alloHSCT. Results: The infusion of nelarabine was mostly well tolerated. Mild neurotoxicity occurred in two patients. All patients achieved at least partial remission of disease. Two patients died on day 63 or 137 after initiation of nelarabine treatment (day 21 and day 102 after alloHSCT) from severe sepsis. However, two patients (one with T-LBL and relapse after fi rst alloHSCT and one without response to induction chemotherapy for T-ALL) are in continuous complete remission two and three years (day 1032 and 1337) after alloHSCT respectively. One patient developed mixed chimerism on day 302 after alloHSCT which was successfully treated with three courses of donor lymphocyte infusion. On day 540 he is in complete remission of T-LBL without any signs of relapse. Conclusion: The T-cell directed drug nelarabine offers a curative option for the treatment of highly resistant T-cell malignancies in combination with subsequent alloHSCT and was well tolerated in this heavily pretreated cohort of patients.",

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in fi rst complete remission (CR) remains the standard option in patients with a high risk of relapse. Patients relapsing after HSCT represent a very difficult challenge to get a second CR. Nelarabine has been associated with a high response rate in relapsing ALL, but few data are available on its effi cacy and safety in the post-transplant setting. Patients. Medical records of 11 T-ALL/LL patients who received nelarabine-based salvage for a relapse after HSCT were retrospectively reviewed. These patients were treated with Nelarabine alone (1,5 g/m\u00b2/day (D) D1, D3, D5, every 28 days) (N=5) or nelarabine associated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide (HyperC; N=6). Results. Ten patients had T-ALL and one had T-LL. Median age was 23 years (14-62) at time of diagnosis. Ten patients underwent HSCT in fi rst CR. HSCT conditioning regimen was myeloablative (N=7) or reduced (N=4). Source of stem cells was peripheral hematopoietic blood stem cells in 6 patients, bone marrow in 4 patients and unrelated cord blood in one patient. Transplant was related for four patients and unrelated for 7. Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted in ciclosporine alone (N=1) or associated with methotrexate (N=8) or mycophenolate (N=2). Eight patients presented grade I-II acute GVHD, no patient had grade III-IV. Two patients developed chronic GVHD (1 extensive) . Relapse occurred with a median duration of 199 days . Of the 11 patients treated with nelarabine-based salvage, 81% achieved hematological CR within a median delay of 48 days. At one year, disease-free and overall survivals were 70% and 90%, respectively. Eight patients received additional Nelarabine consolidation cycles (median, 4 cycles). Main toxicity was neurological, with 2 patients presenting sensitive neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia. Conclusion. In patients with T-ALL/LL relapsing after HSCT, nelarabine-based salvage is associated with very high 81% response rate, offering some [P441] S110 prolonged remissions are observed. Even if neurological toxicity might be an issue, this salvage is well tolerated. Post-transplant nelarabine maintenance might be a valuable option to investigate in high-risk patients, eventually driven by MRD detection.",

Methods: A total of 15 AML patients (mean age 48.7 \u00b1 12.1 years, median 51, 8 males and 7 females) treated with cyclic chemotherapy (3+7, 2+5, HiDAC) alone or in combination with high-dose chemotherapy (preparative regimen Bu/Cy2 or Cy/TBI) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were studied. We evaluated plasma levels of the following adhesion molecules: E-Selectin, L-Selectin, P-Selectin, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1). All biomarkers were measured by biochip array technology on Evidence Investigator analyzer (Randox) at the diagnosis of AML (active leukemia) and at 6 months after completion of chemotherapy (durable complete remission/CR/ in all patients). Results: Comparing plasma adhesion molecule levels in active leukemia and in durable CR, we found signifi cant decrease in plasma E-Selectin (30.19 \u00b1 20.46 mcg/L vs. 12.99 \u00b1 8.00 mcg/L; p<0.01), L-Selectin (2179.35 \u00b1 1169.39 mcg/L vs. 1533.35 \u00b1 540.69 mcg/L; p<0.05), ICAM-1 (659.61 \u00b1 259.50 mcg/L vs. 492.81 \u00b1 236.96 mcg/L; p<0.05), mcg/L vs. 514.52 \u00b1 115.66 mcg/L; p<0.05). Plasma levels of P-Selectin were without signifi cant difference (89.56 \u00b1 67.60 mcg/L vs. 106.43 \u00b1 52.74 mcg/L; ns). Conclusion: Our results indicate that plasma levels of some adhesion molecules (E-Selectin, L-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) are altered in patients treated for AML, showing activity of the disease. Whether these alterations could serve as a prognostic marker for AML is not known. Further studies in a larger number of patients and comparing adhesion molecule levels with established prognostic markers (cytogenetics, molecular genetics) will be needed to defi ne the potential role of these and additional markers in the risk stratifi cation of AML patients.

Forty-two patients received an HLA-C MM graft, 33 with one HLA-C antigen MM and 9 with an allele MM. All patients received antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Most of the patients had intermediate-(n=80) or adverse risk (n=22) AML. The majority of patients were transplanted in CR1 (n=73). Most patients (n=87) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) . Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts were given to 108 patients and the vast majority (n=122) received cyclosporine A and metothrexate as graft-versus-host (GvHD) prophylaxis. year survival for the 137 patients was 50%, relapse-free survival (RFS) was 46% and TRM at 100 days and 1 year post HSCT was 13.5% and 20.3%, respectively. Patients with HLA-C MM had a 5-year overall survival of 54% compared to 51% in those with HLA-C match (ns) . RFS in patients with HLA-C MM was 52% as opposed to 45 % in patients with HLA-C match (ns). Furthermore both groups had a TRM 1 year post HSCT of 17% (ns) and acute GvHD grade 2-4 was diagnosed in 24% of patients with HLA-C MM and 25% in those with HLA-C match (ns). Also the incidence of chronic GvHD was similar with 23% in patients with HLA-C MM and 22% in patients who received HLA-C matched grafts (ns). In the multivariate analysis more advanced AML was associated with transplant failure (HR=2.02; p<0.01) and relapse (HR=2.99; p=0.001). Furthermore, the most important risk factors for aGvHD and cGVHD were reduced intensity conditioning (HR=6, 36; p=0.002) and PBSC grafts (HR=6,05; p=0.004), respectively. Severe acute GvHD (grades III-IV) increased the risk of TRM (HR=10.2; p<0.001) and was also the most infl uential risk factor on mortality (HR=5.35; p<0.001) but in none of these analyses was HLA-C MM shown to be a signifi cant risk factor. Conclusion: In the present study HLA-C MM had no effect on outcome which may be explained by the use of ATG. Therefore, unrelated donors with HLA-C MM could be acceptable for patients with AML.",

            "text": "Introduction: We have recently reported that CD25 positive AML is associated with high relapse rate and short failure free survival (FFS). CD25+ was a more robust predictor of AML relapse (multivariate Cox regression analysis HR 6.54 [1.34-9.15 ], p=0.01; FLT3-ITD: HR 4.72 [2.04-10.92 ], p= 0.03; Cerny et al Blood 2011; 118: abstr. 3560) . Similarly FLT3-ITD has been associated with poor outcome in AML patients (pts). We report the effect of stem cell transplantation (SCT) on outcome of pts with CD25+ or FLT3-ITD+ AML. Methods and Patients: We have retrospectively evaluated 46 AML pts eligible for induction chemotherapy (APL was excluded). Median age was 60 years (29-83), 15 (33%) pts were older than 65; 21 (47%) females. The expression of CD25 or presence of FLT3-ITD was assigned as high risk AML (HR-AML) and outcome was compared with the rest of pts. No statistical difference in distribution of the following characteristics: sex, age (65+), cytogenetic risk, SCT between high risk and other pts was seen. 67% of pts with CD25+ AML were FLT3-ITD+ (p=0.005); NPM1mut clustered with FLT3-ITD (p=0.036). As induction high dose cytarabine/anthracycline based regimen was used in 40 (89%) pts, and 5 (11%) pts received 7+3. 23 (51%) pts received stem cell transplantation (SCT). Median time from diagnosis to SCT was 4 months (2-7). Results: The estimated median FFS for pts with both (CD25+ and FLT3-ITD+) risk factors was 1.9 months, with one risk factor (CD25+ or FLT3-ITD+) was 10.8 months and not reached in pts without these risk factors (CD25-and FLT3-ITD-; p=0.0016). This did not translate into a difference in OS among these groups (1- year OS: 46% vs 54% vs 70%, p=0.63). Pts undergoing SCT had signifi cantly longer 1-year OS (75%) compared to pts without SCT (35%; p=0.0019). In multivariate analysis SCT was a predictor for improved OS (HR 0.22, p=0.004) . Pts with HR-AML who received SCT had also signifi cantly longer 1-year OS (70%) compared to pts who did not receive SCT (10%; p=0.0005). At the time of SCT 8 (67%) HR-AML pts were in CR1 and 4 (33%) were in CR2 or had refractory disease. Out of the remaining pts 12 (92%) were in CR1 and 1 (8%) pt had relapse at the time of SCT. Conclusion: The expression of CD25 and/or presence of FLT-ITD characterize poor prognostic subgroup in AML with a short FFS and high risk of relapse. In our experience treatment with SCT appeared to abolish the negative impact of CD25+ and FLT3-ITD+ on OS.",

Flynn St James's Hospital (Dublin, IE) Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with an internal tandem duplication of the FMS like tyrosine kinase receptor mutation (FLT pos-ITD) has a poor prognosis. The data as to whether allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in this setting overcomes the poor prognosis is limited. The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of normal karyotype (NK) AML in patients with or without FLT 3 ITD mutation following HSCT. We have performed 62 HSCTs in patients with intermediate risk AML from 1 January 2006 to 1 December 2011. Of this cohort, 46 (74%) (Male=24) had NK AML. Patient characteristics are outlined in Table 1 . The median age was 47yrs (range 20-60 yrs). The donor type was related in 67% (n=31) and the donor source was BM in 16 (35%) and PBSC in the 30 (65%). 22 received myeloablative and 24 received reduced intensity conditioning. 30 (65%) were in fi rst complete remission (CR1) at the time of transplant and the remaining were beyond CR1. 21 were positive for FLT 3-ITD mutation at diagnosis. The median follow up from date of transplant was 536 days (range 32-1959) . Patients who were NK FLT3 ITD positive had a similar outcome post transplant to those who were NK FLT3 ITD negative at diagnosis. This is shown in Figure 1 . Donor type, donor source and conditioning regimen did not have a signifi cant impact on outcome. 34 (74%) patients are alive at date of last follow-up and relapse post transplant had a dismal prognosis irrespective of FLT3 ITD status.",

Studies show that lack of a single ligand HLA to patient for donor KIR ligand can trigger NK cytotoxicity by the absence of inhibitory signals and cause graft versus tumor effects and increase overall survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate the NK alloreativity based on the presence of KIR/HLA ligands between donors and patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant. From March 2009 to April 2011, 31 patients and donors were analyzed for NK alloreativity. Genomic DNA of donors and recipients were extracted using the EZ-DNA kit. The samples were typed by PCR-SSO HLA-A, B, C and DR and DQ 14 KIR genes and 2 pseudogenes. The amplifi ed product was hybridized with specifi c probes attached to microspheres for HLA and KIR genes and alleles. The readings of the reactions were performed in fl ow cytometry using Luminex technology and organized by the computer program Labscan \u00ae. The samples were analyzed (HLA program FusionTM Research, One Lambda) for the presence and absence of KIR and HLA genes. Statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS and the signifi cance level was 5%. To investigate a possible infl uence of polymorphisms of these genes in the occurrence of post-transplant was performed a univariate Cox survival curve with the Kaplan-Meier probability curve. Analyzing the frequency of diseases was observed that acute myeloid leukemia was the most occurred (35.5%), followed by chronic myeloid leukemia (19.4%), malignant lymphomas and lymphoid leukemia. Of the 31 patients, 18 (58%) showed lack of HLA-C ligand for KIR receptor donor, while 13 patients (42%) showed all the ligands presents. Overall survival analysis showed in the group that lack the ligand HLA-C for KIR presented 88% survival, suggesting occurrence of post-transplant aloreativity NK and possible increase in graft-versus-tumor effect, whereas the group presented all the ligands the survival rate was 31% (p = 0.03). Initial results show a protective effect and survival in the absence of ligand HLA-C in patient of the KIR inhibitory donor, showing a possible aloreativity. Further tests will be conducted to establish the best correlation between KIR and HLA to donor and recipient in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",

Koldehoff, M. Ditschkowski, D.W. Beelen, A.H. Elmaagacli Universityhospital Essen (Essen, DE) Objectives: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are well known to play an essential role in the immune response. As previously described are expressed on different levels in dendritic cells derived from blasts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is known that dendritic cells express TLRs which identify so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and by this way trigger the maturation of dendritic cells and production of cytokines. By this way the innate and adaptive immunity are activated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the expression of TLR- 1, -2, -3, -5, -7, and -9 in blasts of patients with AML and compared it the expression of mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers. Methods: We analysed the expression of the above mentioned TLRs with a quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction in blasts generated of whole blood of 6 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AML, the AML cell-line Kasumi 1, and mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers. ABL was used as endogenous reference. The median patients age was 57 years (range 38-60 years). Three patients had relapsed AML after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT), 2 patients a relapse before aSCT, and 1 patient had a newly diagnosed AML. AML classifi cation was as follows: M4 n=2, M5 n=2, unspecifi ed n=2. Results: In AML-blasts and in mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers all analysed TLRs were highly expressed. TLR-1 and -2 were seen to be expressed at a lower level than compared to respectively . The highest level of TLR expression was seen for TLR-7. We could see a slightly different expression of TLR-2 and -3 in healthy volunteers compared to patients with AML. For TLR-2 we had a higher expression in healthy volunteers with a median range of 9936% compared to 1888%. For TLR-3 the level for healthy volunteers was lower in contrast to the level of patients with AML (median 156862% and 487949%, respectively). But due to the small numbers of analyses this difference was not signifi cant. Conclusion: We could demonstrate in our study an expression of all tested TLRs in leukemic blasts. There was no signifi cant difference compared to the expression of TLRs in healthy volunteers. We could detect a slight difference for TLR-2 and -3, but due to the small number of patients, further analyses are needed to confi rm these results. S114 siblings in 15 pts, (2x mismatched siblings), matched unrelated donors in 15 pts and mismatched UDs in 10 pts. Conditioning was myeloablative in 34 pts, RIC in 8 pts. Median follow-up was 15 months (range; . The expression of WT1 gene was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood according the European Leukemia Net recommendations. At the time of allo-SCT 29 pts were WT1 negative and 13 pts were WT1 positive. Results : When comparing the two groups according the WT1 status, there was not signifi cant difference in therms of the age,leukocyte count at dg, sex, AML type, genetic risk, primary induction failure, number of iCR, induction or consolidation type. Also, donor type, graft type, conditioning regimen, HSCT-CI, aGVHD or cGVHD incidence were not signifi cantly different. In the univariate analysis, in terms of OS, there was a trend toward better survival in the group of WT1 neg (OS in 3 years 77% vs 56%, p=0.06), in terms of PFS, signifi cantly better results were observed in group of WT1 neg (PFS in 3y 79% vs 32%, p=0.001) and in pts without aGVHD (p=0.001). In multivariate analysis, the only signifi cant in terms of better OS was WT1 negativity (p=0.029), in terms of PFS, again WT1 negativity (p=0.015) and the absence of aGVHD (p=0.011). Conclusion: Our results show that MRD status measured by quantitative assessment of WT1 gene in AML patients in CR1 signifi cantly affects their future prognosis after allo-SCT. WT1 positive patients should be considered for more intensive pretransplantation therapy or earlier immunomodulatory intervention after allo-SCT (pre-emptive DLI). The larger prospective studies are necessary to confi rm this hypothesis.",

Gerayeli, A. Jalali, S. Mousavi, M. Jahani, M. Iravani, B. Bahar, A. Ghavamzadeh Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Introduction: Diagnostic karyotype is the most signifi cant prognostic factor in AML patients and provides the framework for current risk-stratifi ed treatment approaches. The aim of our study was to use this score for outcome prediction after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in fi rst complete remission. Methods: We studied 171 AML patients (53.8% male) with a median age of 26 years (range: 18-38 yrs) who underwent HSCT in fi rst CR at Hematology, Oncology and Stem cell transplantation Research center. The median follow-up was 1 year (1-82 months) . We analyzed the diagnostic karyotypes and grouped patients according to the Medical Research Council/National Cancer Research (MRC) Institute trials and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) scheme. We compared the 3 existing cytogenetic groups of favorable (8% in MRC and 5% in SWOG), intermediate (82% in MRC and 85% in SWOG) and adverse (10% in each group) to stratify patients for OS and LFS after HSCT. Result: The hazard of death in favorable group of MRC cytogenetic risk categorization was signifi cantly lower than adverse group (HR=0.1; 95% CI: (0.01, 0.79); P=0.03), as well as SWOG grouping system (HR=0.08; 95% CI: (0.001, 0.69); P=0.02). It was also signifi cantly lower in intermediate group compared to adverse group (HR=0.31; 95% CI: (0.14, 0.70); P=0.005) in MRC and SWOG (HR=0.37; 95% CI: (0.17, 0.91) ; P=0.03). The hazard of relapse or death in favorable group of MRC was signifi cantly lower than adverse group (HR=0.14; 95% CI: (0.03, 0.64); P=0.01), as well as SWOG (HR=0.11; 95% CI: (0.01, 0.84); P=0.03). It was also signifi cantly lower in intermediate group of MRC than adverse group (HR=0.3; 95% CI: (0.15, 0.62) ; P=0.001) and SWOG (HR=0.32; 95% CI: (0.16, 0.65) ; P=0.002). Cumulative incidence of relapse (95% CI) one year after HSCT in favorable group was 8% (0.004-0.3), intermediate group 14% (0.08-0.22 ) and adverse group 53% (0.21-0.77) (P=0.01) ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion: The results obtained from MRC and SWOG groups were similar and in consistent with those of previous studies. By analyzing the larger cohort and more follow-up, karyotype as a critical independent determinant of outcome and also as a means of optimizing therapy would help in risk stratifi cation of AML. It seemed that patients in favorable group had a longer DFS after HSCT. No signifi cantly longer DFS was found to be present in unfavorable group even after HSCT but only a trend to a better prognosis. The results of the study revealed that the prognosis of intermediate group improved after HSCT.",

Although aUPD involving chromosome 6 has been recently documented in relapse AML, pretransplant aUPD involving the HLA region is poorly documented. Such events could be of great interest because loss of heterozygosity (LOH) resulting from aUPD in leukemic cells may lead to incorrect results if HLA typing for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor searches is performed on blood samples drawn during blastic crisis. We report here six AML patients whose HLA typing was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) obtained at diagnosis. By using PCR-SSO hybridization on microbeads (luminex technology) and bi-allelic sequencebased typing, apparent LOH was observed in all cases. In 3 patients LOH was detected for the entire HLA region, whereas HLA-A,B,C LOH only was detected in 2 patients and HLA-A LOH in 1 patient. DNA extracted from the PBLs at diagnosis (85-95% blasts) was labeled and tested by Comparative Genomic Hybridization on microarrays (aCGH). The results showed that the copy number was neutral for the HLA-A,B,C,DRB1,DQB1 and DPB1 loci. Because no chromosomal loss has been observed, the LOH observed in all 6 patients can be explained by acquired UPD involving 6p21. When performed on PBLs obtained after complete remission of AML, HLA typing of the patients lead to the identifi cation of both haplotypes. In order to determine a detection threshold of the PCR-SSO reverse hybridization on the microbeads assay, an increasingly used test for routine HLA typing, we performed DNA mixing experiments of 2 HLA homozygous samples. The threshold for detection of the second HLA-A,B,DRB1 allele was >10% when present at a double dose. We conclude that PCR-based HLA typing techniques using locus-specifi c primers could miss the second haplotype if haplotype loss has occurred in >80% of the nucleated cells in the blood sample, as observed during acute blastic crisis. Because aUPD may be partial any homozygous HLA result should be confi rmed by a second typing performed either on a buccal swab or on a blood sample drawn from the patient in remission. A. Werner, M.

Casper Klinikum Oldenburg (Oldenburg, DE) Introduction: Chloroma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma (GS), is an inclusion of early myeloid stem cells in different tissues in patients with leukaemia. Isolated extramedullary relapses of GS after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are reported as an unusual event. Materials and Methods: We analysed 6 patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic (ALL, n=2) or myeloid leukaemia (AML, n=4) who developed a GS after BMT. The data of relapse are based on histological, cytological and molecular investigations. Results: All patients (pts) had a history of advanced (n=3) or refractory disease (n= 3) before BMT and received transplants from matched related (n= 5) or unrelated donors (n=1). In one patient GS was suspected with initial diagnosis and regressed under induction chemotherapy. Cyclosporin A and short MTX were used as post transplant GvHD prophylaxis in all patients. GS developed simultaneously (2/6 pts) with bone marrow relapse or after graft versus leukaemia therapy either by transfusion of donor lymphocytes (DLI) (3/6 pts) or discontinuation of immunosuppression (1/6 pts) ( Table 1 ). In the latter patients, the interval from bone marrow relapse to extramedullary relapse was in the range of 2 to 17 month. In two of these four patients, GS developed without new bone marrow involvement. GS primarily developed in subcutaneous tissue (n=2), paravertebral (n=2), testis (n=1) or in pelvis (n=1). In the course of the disease GS was also found in other locations as well (glottis, spine, breast). Conclusion: Patients receiving allogeneic transplantation for refractory or advanced disease may have an increased risk to develop GS. In addition the induction of a graft versus leukaemia effect may increase the risk for GS development and remission control in the bone marrow alone may not always be suffi cient.",

Methods: From January, 1990 to March, 2010 , 498 consecutive adult patients (median age 57 (15-89), male/female; 301/197) diagnosed as AML were included, and 116 patients received allo-HSCT. The chi2-test was used for comparison of binary variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of continuous variables. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared using the log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically signifi cance. Results: A total of 245 relapses was occurred in 193 patients; 27 relapses (11.0%) were with GS and 36 relapses were occurred after allo-HSCT. Among 36 relapses after allo-HSCT, 9 (25%) occurred GS, and out of the 9 relapses 3 were developed as isolated GS. The frequency of relapses with GS after allo-HSCT was signifi cantly higher than that after chemotherapy (25% vs 9%; p=0.008). Among 36 relapses after allo-HSCT, there was no signifi cant difference between with and without GS in conditioning regimen (with or without total body irradiation and myeloablative or not) and stem cell source (related, unrelated, or cord blood), likewise, the presence and severity of both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease did not affect the frequency of GS. Additionally the durations from transplant to relapse were also comparable between with and without GS. Among 33 relapses (8 with GS and 25 without GS) limited in the fi rst allo-HSCT, the 1-year OS rates after transplant for patients with GS showed the tendency of favorable prognosis compared with those without GS (25% vs. 12%, respectively; p = 0.08). Conclusion: Our fi ndings indicated that the vigilance is required regarding the relapse with accompanying GS after allo-HSCT, which is received from any kind of donor source and conditioned with any regimen. Furthermore, detection of GS at relapse after allo-HSCT may enable us to identify the patients with favorable prognosis.",

Since cytogenetic and molecular characteristics of PTR are still obscure, 80 such pts were analyzed by means of standard G-banding and partly by M-FISH. Furthermore, expression levels of genes WT1 and EVI-1 were determined by real-time PCR analysis in half of them. Results . The main our cytogenetic fi nding was often complex chromosome abnormalities (CCA) which were presented in over 40% of cases with PTR including those with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Besides, abnormalities of chromo some numbers 5 and 7 (-5/5q-and -7/7q-) as well as trisomy 22 were among non-seldom in the pts with AML PTR whereas it was trisomy 22 in pts with Ph+ ALL PTR. As for interesting molecular fi ndings, they include an increased expression of WT1 gene in 69% of pts with AML PTR. Furthermore, the increased expression level of EVI-1 gene was registered in 5 pts, including 1 with t(2;3)(p11;q26) and CCA, 2 pts with t(3;21)(q26;q22) complicated with t(8;9)(p11;q34) or trisomy 13, and 2 pts with CCA without chromosome 3 aberrations. According to published data these cytogenetic and molecular changes are strongly associated with a great resistance to both chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), although they were treated effectively by means of low doses of such hypomethylating agents as Decitabine (Janssen) or Vidaza (Celgene). Among other chromosome abnormalities in pts with PTR must be mentioned non-random rearrangements of 11q23 locus with gene MLL which took place in both AML and ALL leukemias. Conclusion. Since cytogenetic characteristics of PTR are very informative they are needed the further investigations in both theoretical and practical aspects.",

Still, relapse remains an issue: in the haploidentical setting, we showed in a landmark study that disease recurrence can be frequently explained by de novo genomic loss of the mismatched HLA in leukemia, leading to specifi c immune evasion (Vago, NEJM, 2009) . In this study, we set out to identify new mechanisms of leukemia immune escape and relapse in different HSCT settings, by performing comparative high-throughput genomic and transcriptional profi ling of AML blasts harvested at diagnosis and relapse after allogeneic HSCT. Whole genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphism profi ling demonstrated de novo macroalterations in 6/11 relapses studied to date. Uniparental disomy was the most frequent event, often involving the FLT3 locus. In 5/11 cases we observed clonal redistribution at relapse, with relative expansion of clones displaying macroalterations. Importantly, we documented frequent positive selection for adverse prognostic mutations: in particular, in 5/6 patients carrying the FLT3 Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD), the allelic burden of the mutated form was increased at relapse. Gene expression profi ling was performed for 7 paired diagnosis-relapse samples. Interestingly, in the 3 patients with the earliest timing of disease recurrence (median time after HSCT 30 days), most of the transcripts deregulated at relapse were part of immune processes. Moreover, in one of these patients, who relapsed early after a haploidentical HSCT, we could document specifi c down-regulation of the HLA class II antigen presentation pathway, and its recovery when leukemic cells collected at relapse were transferred into immuno-compromised NOD/ SCID mice, suggesting plasticity of the deregulation based on the degree of immune pressure.",

The preferential outgrowth of leukemic cells displaying specifi c unfavorable mutations (such as FLT3-ITD) grants a biological rationale for the post-transplantation use of targeted inhibitors. Moreover, the observation that not only genomic but also transcriptional HLA loss can be at the basis of relapse after haploidentical HSCT warrants further optimization of monitoring and molecular re-typing for targeted treatment of disease relapse. S118 otherwise chemosensitive cells. The CD44 adhesion molecule plays a crucial role in leukemic-cell homing to the BM. Alternative splicing of native transcripts generates different isoform variants, among which CD44v6. CD44v6 acts as a cytokine co-receptor, increasing the sensitivity to survival factors produced by the BM stroma, such as VEGF and scatter factor, the ligand for c-Met. Accordingly, CD44v6 over expression is associated with poor prognosis. We recently confi rmed CD44v6 over expression in a relevant fraction of AML cases (11/26, 42%) with preference for M4-5 FAB subtypes, and interestingly in the majority of malignant plasmacells from multiple myeloma (MM) cases (15/17, 88%), another disease characterized by BM tropism. Primary AML cells cultured with BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) became relatively resistant to daunorubicin and ara-C. Acquired chemoresistance was cell-cell contact independent, suggesting the involvement of soluble factors released by MSC. SDF-1a was ruled out by blocking CXCR4 with plerixafor. Interestingly, while upon MSC co-culture the average levels of CD44 on AML cells decreased, we found that CD44v6 was selectively up-regulated. Accordingly, acquired chemoresistance could be reverted by blocking experiments with a mAb. Remarkably, the role of CD44v6 was confi rmed in MM cells exposed to bortezomib. For in vivo proof-of-concept of acquired chemoresistance in NSG mice, we subsequently generated different AML and MM stable knock-downs specifi c for CD44v6 by LV-assisted short-hairpin (sh)RNA interference and surprisingly observed a virtually complete reduction of tumorigenic potential (P<0,005), rendering impracticable further experiments with CT. Altogether these results indicate that CD44v6 has a crucial and non-redundant role in those aspects of AML and MM cell biology that are microenvironment-dependent, including acquired chemoresistance and tumor initiation in xenograft models. Combining CD44v6 targeting with CT is therefore a promising approach for AML and MM eradication.",

Thiede, M. Bornh\u00e4user, C. Waskow TU Dresden (Dresden, DE) Xenotransplantation has become an indispensable tool in the exploration of stem cells and led to the discovery of cancer stem cells. Characterisation of CSC might provide insights in the pathophysiology of the disease, and also represents the basis to develop new therapeutic strategies. NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma-/mice (NSG) provide a permissive environment for xenotransplantation and have been used to investigate leukemic stem cells of human Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Mononucleated cells (MNC) of 19 patients with AML were isolated from bone marrow, peripheral blood and leukapheresis products, and transplanted into unconditioned or sublethally irradiated NSG mice. Engraftment of human cells was subsequently monitored in the peripheral blood and fi nally bone marrow and spleen of the recipient mice were analyzed for the presence of human cells. The majority of NSG showed a rapid expansion of human leukocytes in the peripheral blood, associated with deterioration of health. Sublethal irradiation enhanced the medical condition. The use of defrosted MNC mitigated the course of the disease, and the primary site of donor graft retrieval had no substantial infl uence on the engraftment. Engrafted human leukocytes cells were mainly polyclonal T cells. Furthermore, we observed the engraftment of human B-cells and cells of the myeloid lineage. Molecular analysis revealed that only cells of the myeloid lineage were derived from mutant primary leukemic cells. By transplanting MNC depleted of T-and B-cells, we could prevent an expansion of human T-cells. In those recipients, the engrafted leucocytes were constituted mainly of cells of the myeloid lineage, and only a minor population of B-cells was detected, strengthening the idea that expanding T cells are unrelated to the initial disease. This fi nding is supported by the observation that even transplantation of MNC of healthy donors in unconditioned NSG mice solely led to an engraftment of T-lymphocytes. Transplantation of non-separated MNC of AML patients into NSG mice leads to the expansion of disease-unrelated T cells followed by a, most likely, T-cell mediated death of the mice. Therefore this transplantation procedure fails to establish an AML-like disease in the recipient mice, and is therefore not useful for the study of human AML in mice. We show here that T-lymphocyte expansion is circumvented by depletion of T cells in the donor material, which makes an engraftment of AML in recipient mice feasible.",

Goulden, G. Davies, P. Amrolia, P. Veys, W. Qasim Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) Objective and Methods: Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Adenovirus (ADV) is a major cause of morbidity after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). From July 2005 to Dec 2010, 291 children (haematological=121, immunodefi ciencies=154, metabolic=16) underwent HCT with prospective, twice weekly, surveillance for viral reactivation till CD4 recovery of 0.3 x 10 9 /l, and reconstitution of cellular immunity was tracked over a 12 month period. We have identifi ed key risk factors for viral reactivation and provide a cost estimate in terms of the fi nancial burden placed on the health care provider. Results: Viral reactivation was frequent following HCT (CMV 17%, ADV 15% and EBV 11%) with the median time to onset of ADV viraemia 15 days, CMV 20 days and EBV 74 days after HCT. Children with reactivation had signifi cantly slower kinetics of CD4 T-cell reconstitution compared to children without viraemia (p<0.05) with median CD4 lymphocyte counts under 150 x 10 6 /l in children developing CMV and ADV reactivations within 2 months, or EBV within 6 months of HCT. Use of serotherapy was a signifi cant risk factor for all 3 viruses ( Figure 1 ). In addition, CMV reactivation was signifi cantly associated with donor/recipient seropositivity and use of mobilised peripheral blood stem cell grafts. ADV and EBV reactivations were signifi cantly associated with HLA-mismatched grafts, acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and extended use (>4 weeks) of steroid therapy. EBV was also linked to use of positive donor/recipient serology and reduced intensity condition regimens. Overall 9 (15%) of 62 deaths were directly attributed to one or more of these viruses. Children with reactivation remained in hospital for a signifi cantly longer period (127 days vs 87 days; p<0.01) and most had additional post-HCT comorbidities, most notably GVHD. Extended hospital stay in children with GVHD \u2265 grade II could be directly attributed to viral reactivation whereas for those with GVHD \u2265 grade III the additional stay was multifactorial. We estimate the cost of antiviral therapy and additional in-patient stay at our centre attributable to viral reactivation is around 25,000 euros per patient. Conclusions: Prospective surveillance of viral reactivation has allowed identifi cation of high risk allogeneic transplant procedures in children, and for the fi rst time we have been able to estimate the fi nancial cost of viral reactivation to the health care provider.",

Duval (2) (1)CHU de Liege (Liege, BE); (2) CHU Ste-Justine (Montreal, CA) Background: The last updated unifi ed international post-transplant vaccination guidelines recommends immunization of all patients at fi xed times post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), independent of their stem cell source. It is not clear, however, whether this strategy will protect patients after cord blood transplantation (CBT) as they have a delayed immune reconstitution. We aimed to assess the protection against diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B of pediatric transplant patients post CBT, at CHU Ste-Justine, Montr\u00e9al. Patients and Methods: The pediatric recipients of CBT at our institution, were tested for the presence of antibodies against 3 vaccine antigens: diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis B. The vaccination schedule is composed of 3 doses of tetanus and diphtheria vaccine at 12, 15 and 24 months post-CBT, and 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine at 12, 15 and 18 months post-CBT, according to the international guidelines. Antibody-levels before vaccination (at 12 months following CBT) and after 2 and 3 doses of vaccination (at 18, 24 and 36 months post-CBT) were measured by ELISA assays. Results: Twenty-eight CBT recipients were tested (20 males). The median age at CBT was 6.9 years (range 0.5 -17 years). All the patients were vaccinated according to the immunization schedule excluding 2 patients who were not vaccinated before respectively 23 and 61 months post-CBT due to severe immune-suppression. After 3 doses of vaccines, all patients had seroprotective antibody concentrations against tetanus and diphtheria. After the fi rst 2 doses of vaccine, 60% of the patients had achieved protective antibody levels to tetanus and diphtheria. For hepatitis B vaccination, 86% and 90% of patients achieved protective antibody-levels after respectively 2 and 3 doses of vaccination (samples obtained at 18 and 24 months post-CBT). However, at 36 months post-CBT, only 77% of them still had protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis B.",

Kr\u00f6ger (1) (1)University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) ; (2) Labor Dr Krause (Kiel, DE) Patients face an increased risk of invasive mold infection, especially of the lungs during allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Low-dose CT-scan is a sensitive tool to detect lung lesions, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a standard procedure to identify pathogenic microorganisms. From April 2008 to August 2011 pulmonary infi ltrates were detected by CT-scan in 64 adult patients (11,6% of all SCT patients) during allogeneic SCT. The BAL was examined by culture for pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Additionally, DNA was extracted and used in two semi-nested PCR assays target ing the mitochondrial DNA of Aspergillus spp. and the 18S ribosomal DNA of Mucorales, respectively. PCR products were characterised by sequencing. In 28 (44%) out of the 64 patients fungal DNA was detected by the PCR assays in the fi rst BAL. Sequencing revealed Aspergillus fumigatus specifi c DNA in 22 (78%) and A. fl avus in one patient. Mucorales specifi c DNA was detected in 9 patients (32%), and identifi ed as Rhizomucor spp in 6 and Rhizopus spp in 3 patients. A mixed infection according to PCR caused by A. fumigatus and Rhizomucor spp was found in 4 patients (14% of all fungal PCR-positives). A follow-up bronchoscopy was performed in 22 of 64 (34%) patients. In the BAL of three previously PCR-negative patients A. fumigatus DNA was detected, and in one Rhizomucor spp [P462] S120 DNA was amplifi ed in addition. In another patient A. fumigatus had been obtained in the fi rst BAL but DNA of Rhizomucor spp was detected in the follow-up bal fl uid. Overall the PCR assays were positive in 31 (48 %) cases. Aspergillus spp. was detected in 20 (65%) patients, DNA of Mucorales spp in 5 (16%) and both A. fumigatus and Rhizomucor spp in 6 (19%) cases. Out of 20 patients with detectable Aspergillus DNA 16 improved under antifungal treatment whereas 4 died. Out of 5 patients with Mucorales spp DNA only two survived whereas 3 out of 6 patients with a mixed infection survived, i.e. 21 patients (68%) with invasive fungal disease survived. In the fungal PCR-negative group consisting of 33 patients 23 (70%) survived. In our hands the two PCR assays from BAL are a useful addition of the microbiological diagnostic armamentarium. It offers the opportunity to detect DNA from agents of mucormycosis. Pulmonary fungal infections are detected at an early stage in order to increase the chance of a successful antifungal therapy. Infi ltrates during SCT are associated with a high case fatality rate and in many cases the etiology remains to be determined.",

For clinical trials the revised EORTC/MSG criteria is useful but there is little data on its usefulness in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 'real world' incidence of IFD in patients undergoing HSCT or high dose chemotherapy using EORTC/MSG diagnostic tools. Patients were recruited prospectively between December 2008 and May 2010 and followed for at least 4 months after chemotherapy/HSCT. During admission twice weekly galactomannan (GM) and beta-Dglucan (BDG) was performed and neutropenic sepsis unresponsive to antimicrobials triggered diagnostic work-up with computed tomography (CT). The CT scans were reviewed independently by two chest radiologists and all cases were independently verifi ed before assigning EORTC status. All patients had antifungal prophylaxis during the period of neutropenia or continuing immunosuppression. Two hundred and three patients were recruited [123 male, 80 female; median age 54y (range 19-73); median follow-up 194 days (range 12-647)]. The underlying diagnoses were: acute leukaemia 62 (myeloid 55, lymphoid 7), chronic leukaemia 4 (myeloid 3, lymphoid 1), MDS/MPD 33, aplastic anaemia 19, lymphoma 37 (non-Hodgkin's 29, Hodgkin's 8), multiple myeloma 45, and others 3. Main treatments received were: HSCT 165 (81%) [allogeneic 94, cord 5, autologous 66], chemotherapy 28 (14%), and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) 8 (4%). The total number of treatments received during study period was 263 (allografts 106, chemotherapy 77, autografts 67, IST 13). The patients were heavily pre-treated; 85% had at least one prior therapy with a median of 5 cycles of therapy/patient (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . There were 44 (21%) cases of IFD in 40 patients: proven 14 (Aspergillus fumigatus 2, Fusarium spp 1, mould IFD 5, non-candida albican spp 5, Pneumocystis jirovecii 1), probable 30. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was the commonest presentation (82%). The treatment-specifi c incidences were 17% (18/104), 12% (21/177), 7% (2/29), and 4% (3/72) for allogeneic HSCT, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, and autologous HSCT respectively. Median time to diagnosis of IFD was 42 days (range 3 to 524) from index chemotherapy or HSCT. Using galactomannan (GM) or beta-D-glucan (BDG) alone (plus host and CT scan evidence) the apparent incidence of IFD would be 13% and 17% respectively. Our fi ndings demonstrate that a multi-diagnostic approach is necessary in order to improve diagnostic accuracy of IFD. F.G.J. Calkoen, C.

Ball, M.J.D. van Tol Leiden Universtiy Medical Center (Leiden, NL) Objectives: Viral infections, i.e. CMV and adenovirus (HAdV) and acute Graft-versus-Host disease (aGvHD) cause high morbidity and mortality in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Both complications can occur simultaneously and the risk of viral infections/reactivations is increased during steroid treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are used for the treatment of steroid refractory aGvHD. On the other hand, adoptive T-cell therapy has been developed to target viral infections. We have investigated the interaction between MSC and virus-specifi c T-cells, because the effect of MSC on HAdV-specifi c responses is unknown and confl icting results have been published on the effect of MSC on CMV-specifi c responses. Methods: PBMC were obtained from healthy volunteers and stimulated with HAdV or CMV peptivator (Miltenyi Biotec). PBMC were also stimulated with peptivator loaded autologous mature dendritic cells (mDC). To obtain virus-specifi c T-cell lines (TCL), cells were restimulated with autologous peptivator loaded PBMC on day 12 and 28. MSC were titrated in on day 0 (PBMC) and day 28 (TCL). Moreover, the effect of MSC on restimulated virus-specifi c T-cell clones was studied. Autologous EBV-B lymphoblastic cell lines were transduced with viral peptides for restimulation. As read-out, tritium-thymidine incorporation, IFN-gamma production, and fl owcytometry (HLA-DR and CFSE) were applied. Results: MSC suppress CMV peptivator stimulated, but not HAdV peptivator stimulated, PBMC. However, after stimulation with loaded mDC, the activation and proliferation of CMV and HAdV stimulated PBMC are suppressed. Responses of HAdV and CMV TCL restimulated on day 28 in the presence of MSC are suppressed. CFSE analysis generally shows that proliferation of CD8+ T-cells is more sensitive to suppression by MSC than the response of CD4+ T-cells ( Figure 1 ). HLA-DR expression is also more suppressed on CD8+ T-cells. To further analyse possible differences in the effect of MSC on CD4 and CD8 T-cells, CD4+ HAdV and CD8+ CMV specifi c T-cell clones were studied. Both are not suppressed by MSC after restimulation. In control experiments, MSC also do not affect CD4+ or CD8+ minor HY specifi c T-cell clones. Conclusion: MSC suppress HAdV and CMV peptivator induced T-cell responses in vitro. The clinical impact of this observation, i.e. during MSC treatment of aGvHD, is currently being investigated. S. Borchers (1) , C. Bunse (1) , S. Tischer (1) , L. Goudeva (1) , E. Dammann (1) , S.

Eiz-Vesper (1) (1)Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) ; (2) University Hospital Frankfurt (Frankfurt a. M., DE) Cytomegalovirus-specifi c cytotoxic T cells (CMV-CTL) are routinely quantifi ed in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in our department to identify patients at high risk for CMV reactivation (CMV-R). Information on the number of CTL transfused with the graft and their fate is currently scarce. Here, we analysed the number of CMV-, EBV-and ADV-CTL within the stem cell graft using multimer staining covering 6 common HLA class I molecules (A*01:01, A*02:01, A*24:02, B*07:02, B*08:01, B*35:01) to classify the donor's antiviral capacity and their potency to protect patients against CMV-R. Functional activity was tested by ELISPOT analysis after restimulation with overlapping peptide pools (CMV: pp65, IE-1; EBV: EBNA, LMP2A, BZLF; ADV: hexon). Antiviral-CTLs were analyzed in whole blood (WB) before and during G-CSF mobilisation (WBM), blood from the apheresis tubing fi lter (R) and from the graft (G). We aimed to detect a possible impact of G-CSF mobilisation as well as the infl uence of apheresis process on CTL frequencies and function. Up to date 42 donors were analyzed with multimers specifi c for each virus (7 CMV, 4 EBV and 3 ADV). In preliminary analysis the median levels of CMV-, ADV-and EBV-CTL varied depending on the multimer used for detection, but frequencies in an individual donor correlated well in WB, WBM, R and G samples. For example, median frequency of CMV-CTL detected with HLA-A*02:01-NLVP tetramer was 1.6% of CD3+CD8+ T-cells resulting in median numbers of 6/\u03bcl (n=28). Interestingly, the number of CMV-CTL detected after G-CSF stimulation was not infl uenced by G-CSF, but function was impaired. Frequency of reactive T-cells detected by ELISPOT in samples collected after G-CSF stimulation (R, G) in an individual donor varied when compared to unmanipulated cells (WB). Furthermore, ELISPOT results did not correlate with the frequencies detected by multimer staining. This is currently under further investigation. Correlation of frequency and function of antiviral-CTL in the graft and reconstitution in the patient after HSCT will be analysed in a larger cohort. Taken together, we suggest that accurate information on the numbers of transferred virus-specifi c CTLs and their functional activity should be determined to better understand the kinetics of antiviral reconstitution in patients after HSCT, to better identify patients in need of adoptive transfer and to select an optimal donor.",

Crawley (2) (1)Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge University Health Partners (Cambridge, UK) ; (2) Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Cambridge, UK) Background: Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality post allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation, allo HSCT. Immunoglobulin replacement, IVIG, is an effective strategy to enhance immune reconstitution and reduce infection risk but criteria for withdrawal of IVIG are not well established. In a retrospective study of a consecutive cohort we compared IVIG (12) versus no IVIG (19) cases using a standardised immune monitoring protocol. Patients and Methods: 31 consecutive cases including 21 males, 10 females; age 43.2 + 13.4 years with recurrent infection and/or low serum immunoglobulins, Igs, (IgG <5 g/L n=11) were investigated. Underlying disease was ALL 8, AML 8, CLL 4, CML 3, NHL 4 , HD 2, MDS 2. Donors were HLA-identical siblings in 17, and unrelated in 14. Donors and recipients were CMV negative in 13. Cases were referred within 1 year of HSCT (8), 1 -2 years (8), 2 -4 years (7), 4+ years (8), and compared with 27 age matched controls, 40.4 + 8.5 years. Immune monitoring included serum Igs; pneumococcal, tetanus, Haemophilus infl uenza b antibodies; major lymphocyte subsets; na\u00efve, differentiated B and T cells; and T cell receptor repertoires, TCR. Results: Cross-sectional study at fi rst assessment revealed early recovery of B and CD8+ T cells but chronic defi cits of NK, memory B and CD4+ T cells. Thymic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells predict na\u00efve B, memory B, and na\u00efve CD8+ T cell counts, r 2 = 0.481, 0.367, 0.940, all p<0 .001, refl ecting combined immunodefi ciency or immune reconstitution. Class switched memory B cells predict serum IgG, and IgA levels. Discriminating parameters were: serum IgG <5 g/L (not IgA, IgM, IgE, nor antibody levels) in 8/12 IVIG versus 3/19 no IVIG, \u03c7 2 8.3, p = 0.004; memory B cells <15 x10 6 /L in 9/12 IVIG versus 6/19 no IVIG, \u03c7 2 5.55 p=0.018; and thymic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells <10 x10 6 /L in 9/11 IVIG versus 2/18 no IVIG, \u03c7 2 14.50 p<0.001. CMV reactivation predicted CD8 counts; CD4, CD8 T cell phenotypes with loss of CD25, CD127, CD28 expression and TCR diversity, but not IVIG use. Serial study showed prolonged defi cits of na\u00efve T and memory B cells lasting \u22658 years post HSCT. Discussion: IVIG is prescribed for symptomatic combined immunodefi ciency of variable duration unpredictable by clinical criteria. Thymic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells are discriminating indices strongly predictive of immunity, and with memory B cells are candidate immune markers for withdrawal of IVIG in allo HSCT for malignancy.",

Leukemia/MDS (n=16) was the most common indication for transplantation. Thirteen patients (72%) received matched related donor and 5 patients (28%) received matched unrelated donor transplantation. Median time of onset of cGVHD after transplantation was 24 months (range 5-60 months) . Median time to start ECP after diagnosis of chronic GVHD was 10 months (range 0-60 months). All patients (100%) were on prednisone when ECP was started. Prednisone dose could be decreased in 15 patients (83%) after initiation of ECP. ECP and steroids could be stopped altogether in 3 patients (17%) after a median of 18 months. 7 of the 13 (53%) patients suffered from severe infections necessitating hospitalization prior to initiation of ECP. Eleven of the 18 patients (61%) needed hospitalization secondary to infection during or after completion of ECP. Majority of the infections necessitating hospital admission prior to initiation of ECP were Pneumonia (n=6), sepsis (n= 3), and port infection (n=1). Infections necessitating admission in patients during and after completion of ECP were Pneumonia (n=10), port infection (n=3), and wound infection (n=3). Some patients had multiple infections. In this small cohort we observed, that majority of patients during ECP could lower the dose of prednisone and 3 patients could altogether stop both ECP and steroids. Though ECP led to decreased steroid use, it did not change admission rates due to severe infection indicating ongoing immune defi ciency. Prospective trial in a larger cohort and detailed monitoring of immune re-constitution assays will be necessary to show if ECP truly affects spectrum and incidence of infection in patients with extensive cGVHD.

Vicente Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Introduction: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is controversial due to the limited prognosis of these patients in case of secondary critical illness. Aim: To evaluate prognostic factors and outcomes of the highest risk subgroup HSCT recipients requiring admission to ICU. Patients and Methods: Retrospective study of patients admitted to the ICU after HSCT between January 2000 and April 2011 at anytime after allogeneic HSCT and until day +100 for autologous HSCT. We collected demographic data, comorbidities, disease characteristics, reason for ICU admission and survival (hospitalary and after one year). SOFA and SAPSII scales were calculated and used as prognostic scores. Results: 50 patients undergoing HSCT were admitted to the ICU, 80% (n=40) received allogeneic HSCT. The median age was 40 years (range . 56% were men. The underlying disease was: 51% acute leukemia, 23% lymphoproliferative syndrome and 26% myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes. The status of hematological disease at the time of admission is detailed on Graphic 1. Among allogeneic HSCT patients, 37.5% presented acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and 30% chronic GVHD. The most common reasons for admission were sepsis, respiratory failure and cardiac failure in both allogeneic (35, 40 and 17% respectively) and autologous (60, 30 and 10%) HSCT. 62% required non invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), 50% invasive MV (IMV) and 72% vasoactive drugs. The hospital survival was 40% and 29% after one year. The presence of acute GVHD (p=0.041), the reason for admission (p=0.041), the requirement for NIMV or IMV (p<0.001), the need of vasoactive drugs (p=0.002) and higher scores on scales SAPSII and SOFA (p<0.001) at the time of admission were associated with higher mortality rate in the univariate analysis. The only predictor of mortality in the multivariate analysis was SOFA score (p=0.023). Conclusions: The most frequent reasons for ICU admission were sepsis and respiratory and cardiac failure. The presence of acute GVHD in the allogeneic patients and the requirement of respiratory support, vasoactive drugs and higher SAPSII and SOFA scores were signifi cantly associated with lower hospital survival. The main prognostic was the SOFA scale score at time of admission, a marker of multiple organ failure. The ICU admission had presented a contribution to the survival of 40%. A.B. Mart\u00ednez, J.J.

Vicente Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and graft versus host disease (GVHD) are the most important determinants of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) . Different factors are associated with the development of CMV infection in these patients. Aim: To analyze the incidence of CMV infection in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT in our center and its impact on GVHD, relapse of the underlying disease and survival. Patients and Methods: Retrospective study of 115 consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT between January 2005 and January 2011. We collected demographic data, donor (D) and receptor (R) CMV serostatus, conditioning regimens, GVHD prophylaxis and clinical outcomes from patient's charts. Information of weekly test for reactivation of CMV by antigenemia or quantitative PCR was also collected. Results: 53% received reduced intensity conditioning. 68% received a graft from a related donor (RD). GVHD prophylaxis was cylosporin + methotrexate in 82% of RD cases. Patients receiving HSCT from unrelated donor (URD) received different GVHD prophylaxis regimens, including pretransplant rabbit thymoglobulin in 49% of cases. The stratifi cation of risk for reactivation of CMV according to D/R serostatus was: low (D-/ R-) in 6% of cases, intermediate (D+/R-) in 49%, and high risk (D\u00b1/R+) in 45%. We observed 40 CMV reactivations, with a median onset of day +52 post-HSCT (range 20-205). 3 patients (2.6%) developed confi rmed CMV disease. The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation, GVHD and relapse at day +100 were 27%, 44% and 5% respectively. In the multivariate analysis, donor type (URD vs RD) and the development of acute GVHD remained as independent factors for reactivation of CMV (p <0.001 and p=0.002 respectively). There was no signifi cant association between CMV reactivation incidence and CMV D/R serostatus, probably related to the small size of our series. All patients received preemptive antiviral therapy. With a median follow up of 23 months (0-73), 50% of patients who presented a CMV reactivation died (68% of them due to non CMV infection causes, 32% of non-infection causes) compared to 36% mortality rate among patients who did not present CMV reactivation (p 0.04). Overall survival of the series was 60%. Conclusions: This study confi rms the higher risk of CMV infection among patients receiving transplant from URD and among those who develop GVHD and the impact of the CMV reactivation on mortality rate.",

Nikolova, G. Benyo, K. Kallay, G. Krivan, P. Remenyi, T. Masszi St. Istvan & St Laszlo Hospital (Budapest, HU) Background: For decades infections have been among the major causes of death in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the era of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, outcome variables should carefully be monitored and re-evaluated. Methods: In a single-center, retrospective survey data from a total of 607 adult and pediatric patients (242 allogeneic and 365 autologous graft recipients) undergoing HSCT between 2008 and 2010 were analyzed. An autopsy was performed in all fatal cases. Pathogens were identifi ed on morphological basis and culture. No nucleic acid based tests were used on tissue specimens. A possible infectious cause of deaths was investigated based on post mortem and clinical fi ndings. In cases of most prevalent infections the time to death post transplantation was also calculated. In mold infections results were compared to historical control data. Results (bacterial: 1, mold infection: 2) . Both of these mold infection cases were heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients dying of an invasive aspergillosis. In the allogeneic HSCT setting 33 fatalities (55% of deaths) could be related to infection. Mold: 16 (25%), bacterial: 9 (15%), viral: 7 (11%), protozoon: 1 (2%) and mold+viral double infection: 1 (2%). Compared to historical control (same centre, between 2003-2006) a non-signifi cant decrease in mold related deaths could be observed (7 vs. 8.2 % of all allogeneic HSCT cases). While the rate of invasive aspergillosis-related deaths decreased, a minor increase was seen in fatalities due to mucormycosis (4.5 vs. 6.1%, and 2.5 vs. 2% of all allogeneic HSCT cases, respectively). Time to death due to aspergillosis after HSCT was signifi cantly shorter when compared to mucormycosis (mean 98.8 vs. 178.5 days, p=0.05). Conclusions: 1. Infectious mortality remains low in autologous HSCT but infection is still a leading cause of death in the allogeneic HSCT setting. 2. Invasive mold infections can occur in pretreated and autografted multiple myeloma patients. 3. The incidence of fatal invasive aspergillosis slightly decreased in allogeneic HSCT but the rate of mucormycosis showed a tendency to increase. 4. Fatal aspergillosis occurred signifi cantly earlier post transplantation than deaths due to mucormycosis.",

Ringd\u00e9n, B. Gustafsson, J. Mattsson Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, SE) Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has been shown to reduce transplant related mortality after HSCT compared to myeloablative conditioning (MAC). We performed a retrospective cohort study to fi nd out whether the use of RIC might also contribute to reducing the risk of early death from pneumonia. Pneumonia-associated deaths were evaluated in 691 HSCT patients. The majority had a hematological malignancy (n=504) and an HLA-matched donor (n=584). RIC was given to 336 patients and MAC to 355. Data concerning radiology, laboratory values, culture, and autopsy results were evaluated together with risk factors for death related to pneumonia within or after 100 days after HSCT (early and overall pneumonia) was evaluated. In 68 patients pneumonia contributed to death (early n=22). The incidence of early pneumonia-related death was 4.2% and 2.1% in MAC and RIC patients, respectively. The overall incidence of pneumonia-related death was 10.5% in both groups. In the multivariate analyses, a malignant disease, a previous HSCT, acute GVHD of grades II-IV, bacteremia and having received mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were factors independently associated to overall pneumonia-related death. MAC-regimen, bacteremia and having received a previous HSCT were found to be associated with early pneumonia-related death. Conclusions: RIC reduced the incidence of early death associated with pneumonia. Patients receiving MSC may have an increased risk for pneumonia-related death. Pneumonia is still an important contributor to overall death in HSCT patients.",

Corradini (1) (1)Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori -Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano (Milan, IT); (2) Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (Milan, IT) Pneumonia is a frequent complication of aplasia and engraftment following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). This retrospective analysis was aimed at understanding whether a positive smoking history may increase the risk of pneumonia during aplasia and engraftment. We collected from clinical charts full data about pulmonary infections during aplasia and engraftment of all the patients consecutively allografted at National Tumor Institute of Milan, Italy, from 2004 to 2011. Smoking history data were collected from clinical charts or by telephone interview. Pneumonia was diagnosed by chest X-ray with associated signs of lung infection, respiratory symptoms and/or fever. High resolution CT scan of the lungs was confi rmatory whenever radiographs were unsatisfactory for diagnosis. Patients evaluable were 170. Their median age was 49 years (range, 15-66 years), and they received alloSCT for lymphoma (57%), myeloma (26%), or acute leukemia or myelodysplasia (17%) from HLA identical siblings (43%), matched unrelated (45%) or haploidentical donors (12%). Eighty patients (47%) had a positive smoking history, with a median consumption of 1.0 pack of cigarettes a day (range, 0.1-3.0 packs a day) for a median of 12.0 years (range, 1.0-40.0 years). Seventy-one patients had quit smoking a median of 5 years before allo-SCT (range, 0.5-41.0 years), 9 patients were still smokers at transplant. Smoking habit was more frequent among males (p=0.005) and among patients living their 5th to 6th decade than younger ones (p<0.001). Smokers had more frequently than nonsmokers a signifi cant reduction (>20%) of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) corrected for hemoglobin (p<0.001 and p=0.004, respectively). During aplasia and engraftment, 24 patients (14%) were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest X-ray (22 positive exams) and/or lung CT (14 positive exams), with associated fever (22 patients) and/or respiratory symptoms (9 patients). Twelve of 80 smokers and 12 of 90 nonsmokers developed pneumonia (15% vs. 13%, p<0.001), with an absolute 2% incidence increase and a 13% estimated increase of risk of pneumonia solely attributable to smoking habit. In conclusion, smoking history signifi cantly increases the risk of pneumonia during aplasia and engraftment following alloSCT. Prospective studies are needed to understand whether respiratory physiotherapy or a tailored antibiotic prophylaxis may decrease this risk.",

Perrone, F. Gaudio, P. Curci, A. Ricco, A. Russo Rossi, A.M. Giordano, A. Spina, R. Angarano, M.C. Longo, G. Specchia Hematology (Bari, IT) Background: The use of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is an important treatment option for selected patients with hematological malignancies. Hovewer, the high chemotherapy doses used for pretransplantation preparation exposes patients to the risk of neutropenic complivations, including bacterial and fungal infections,that in rare cases can be fatal. The post-transplant administration of fi lgrastim reduced the time to neutrophil recovery and has therefore become standard practice in many institutions. Alternatively, the long-acting fi lgrastim formulation, pegfi lgrastim, can be administered as a single 6 mg dose and has a signifi cantly increased half-life, partly due to a decreased renal clearance. Patients and Methods: In this study, data of 72 consecutive adult patients who received an auto-SCT between January 2009 and May 2011 and fi lgrastim (40pts) or pegfi lgrastim (40pts) after transplantation were retrospectively examined. Diagnoses were non Hodgkin lymphoma (26 pts), Hodgkin lymphoma (24 pts) and Multiple Myeloma (30pts). Standard conditioning regi mens (HD-Melphaln or BEAM) were used. The mean CD34+ stem cell doses infused were 4.1 and 4.9x10 6 /kg (p=ns) for the pegfi lgrastim and fi lgrastim group; the groups were matched for age, sex and underlying disease. Patients of the fi lgrastim group received daily subcutaneous injections of 5 mg/Kg/day starting at the day +3 after transplantation until ANC >1x10 9 /L; patients of the pegfi lgrastim group received a fi xed dose of 6 mg subcutaneously on day +3 post-transplantation. Results: The median time to an ANC of 0.5x10 9 /L was 9 and 10 days (p=0.04), respectively, in the pegfi lgrastim and fi lgrastim groups. There was no signifi cant difference in the platelet engraftment between the pegfi lgrastim and fi lgrastim groups (11 vs 12 days, respectively, p=ns) . The median number of days with febrile neutropenia in the pegfi lgrastim group was 2 (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , versus 3 (range 1-6) in the fi lgrastim group (p=0.09). There was no difference in the incidence of documented infections (22% in the pegfi lgrastim vs 25% in fi lgrastim, p=0.8). Median hospital stay (from day 0) was 15 day for pegfi lgrastim and 16 days for the fi lgrastim group (p=0.2); there was no signifi cant differences in survival at day +100 or at 1 year. Conclusions: We conclude that a single injection of pegfi lgrastim administered on post-transplant day+3 shows comparable safety and effi cacy profi les to +3 daily injections of fi lgrastim.",

Karanfi lski Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit (Skopje, MK) Introduction: Infections are the most important complications after stem cells transplantation. The aim of this study is to evaluate incidence, type and severity of infective complications during the early post-transplant period (from day 0 to day +30) in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), conditioned with Bu-Cy chemotherapeutic regimen. We perform comparative study between autologous and allogeneic recipients. Material and Methods: During a ten years period (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) we have treated 110 AML patients with stem cell transplantation. Male: 58 Female: 52 Median age: 34 years. Autologous:70 Allogeneic from HLA identical sibling: 40, peripherall stem cells: 90, bone marrow: 20. Myeloablative preparative regimen Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide was used in 90 patients (60 autologous; 30 allogeneic). Patients were treated in sterile room conditioned with HEPA fi lters, low bacterial diet and antiinfective prophy laxis regimen consisted Ciprofl oxacin 1000 mg/day; Fluconazole 200 mg/day, or Itraconazole 200 mg/12 h; Acyclovir 250 mg/8 h). \u03c7 2 was used to compare frequency of infective complications in autologous and allogeneic transplantation. Results: In the group of allogeneic recipients 20/30 patients (66,6%) developed fever, mucositis gr III/IV 6/30 (20%), pneumonia 5/30 (16,6%), acute viral B-hepatitis 2 patients (2,2%), thrombophlebitis 3/30 (10%), central venous catheter associated infection in 6/30 (20%), The most frequent isolated microorganisms were Gram-positive cocci (70%), Gram-negative bacilli (20%), Candida albicans (6%), Non-albicans Candida (4%). One patient die in septic shock caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6,6%). In the group of autologous AML recipients febrile episode were noted in 30/60 patients (50%), mucositis gr.III/IV 6/60 (10%), pneumonia in 5/60 (8,3%). The most common isolated were Gram-positive cocci (65%), Gram-negative bacilli (25%), Non-Albicans Candida (5%), Candida albicans (5%). The infective complication was fatal in one patients due to septic shock caused by Streptomonas maltophilla. Conclusions: In our center confi rming other study data we detected no signifi cant differences between AML patients treated with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (preparative regimen BuCy) with respect to infectious complications (p=0.118).",

Belgemen, T. Ileri, E. Unal Ince, Z. Uysal, M. Ertem Ankara University School of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Objectives: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has become a defi nitive therapeutic modality in children. Numerous advances have taken place to make the procedure safer. However, infectious complications remain a major cause of transplant related morbidity and mortality. Early infections and infection-related mortality are defi ned as those occurring within 100 days after transplant. In developing countries, early infectious complications are expected to be higher because of the newly settled centers, performing fewer transplants per year, having fewer educated nurses and staff, insuffi cient isolation facilities and more numbers of constructions especially making the risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) higher. The aim of this study was to fi nd out the incidence and nature of early infections and attributable mortality following allo-HSCT from matched family donor (MFD) for hematologic disorders performed in a single pediatric institution in a developing country. Methods: Medical records of all consecutive myeloablative allo-HSCTs from MFD performed for malignant or non-malignant hematologic disorders from November 1997 through December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed to fi nd out the frequency and etiology of early infections, and the incidence of early infection-related mortality. Results: A total of 120 patients underwent 122 HSCTs. Underlying disease was malignant in 48 (39%) and non-malignant in 74 (61%). A total of 170 infection episodes developed within 100 days after transplants. Seven (5.7%) of all patients died. Infections (28.5%) were the second most cause of early mortality following veno-occlusive disorder (43%). Incidence of infection-related early mortality was 1.6% (2/122). Nine (7.3%) of all patients had IFI and one of them (11%) died. Conclusions: In our center which is showing our country's characteristics, the incidence and nature of early bacterial and fungal infections were similar to developed countries' results. The incidence of infection-related early mortality and the role of infections in this mortality were lower when compared with developed countries' data performed on same time periods with similar transplant characteristics. Furthermore, the frequency of IFIs and IFI-related mortality were not higher also. In conclusion, the incidence of early infectious mortality following allo-HSCT may not be different in developing countries by means of universal preventive strategies and attentive care, despite insuffi cient conditions by a dedicated team.",

Lopez-Jimenez Ramon y Cajal Hospital (Madrid, ES) Introduction: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a prohormone that is produced in bacterial infection, like C reactive protein (CRP), although the latter has a low specifi city. The clinical utility of PCT is not well known in severe immunosuppressant conditions, such as stem cell transplantation (SCT). Objectives: Finding PCT concentrations and their predictive value in the diagnosis of severe bacterial infection in SCT compared to CRP levels. Methods and Materials: Prospective study including 31 patients with SCT from March to October 2011. PCT and CRP concentrations were obtained the day of admission, during conditioning, the day of stem cell infusion, and in the main post-transplantation events (fever, antibiotic suspension and discharge). Follow-up was carried on until day +90 from SCT. Results: A total of 136 samples from 25 patients were analyzed, with a mean value of 5 samples per patient. In the conditioning period 3 patients fulfi lled sepsis clinical criteria, with PCT concentrations above the cut-off level (2ng/mL) with a median value of 11.08ng/mL. Excluding infected patients, during SCT, median PCT level was of 0.11 ng/mL (p90: 0.862) (cut-off value [P478] S127 2 ng/mL) and median CRP level was of 29.4 mg/dL (p90:163.02) (cut-off value 5mg/dL). During the follow-up, two types of pattern were found: patients that reached values of 0.20 (n= 14) , and other patients who scored up to 0.60 (n= 11) . In all of them CRP levels were very high (median 35.80 mg/dL p90: 161.9). No signifi cant differences were found in PCT concentrations based upon type of transplant, induction or haematological disease. Only 3 patients were analyzed during the post-transplantation period due to febrile episodes. Two of them did not exhibit PCT elevation (although CRP levels did rise) and were discharged in less than 6 hours. The third patient, who met clinical criteria for sepsis with Acinetobacter isolated in blood cultures, achieved PCT values of 28.8, 53.38 and 33.59 ng/mL and CRP levels of 30, 84.9 and 74.2 mg/dL. Conclusions: In patients without infection, PCT levels remained always below pathological values. However, CRP remained elevated in many of them. We can conclude that in septic situations, in conditioning, during transplantation and after transplantation, PCT levels increased signifi cantly and was useful both in the diagnosis and follow-up of sepsis in SCT.",

Evaluation of 4 years of ambulatory care from a medical, nursing, patient and fi nancial perspective A. Mank, C. Schoonenberg, K. Bleeker, S. Heijmenberg, K. de Heer, R. de Haan, R. van Oers, M.J. Kersten Academic Medical Centre (Amsterdam, NL) The necessity of keeping patients in hospital during neutropenia after high dose chemotherapy is under discussion. A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study was done to examine the safety of ambulatory care in patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukemia, or autologous stem cell transplantation for lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Patients fulfi lling the eligibility criteria were discharged into ambulatory care the day after the last chemotherapy administration, or the day after reinfusion of the stem cells. Patients visited the ambulatory care unit 3 times a week for monitoring of signs, symptoms and laboratory results. During the study period, 165 patients were admitted for 208 chemotherapy cycles. 76 patients in 89 cycles could not be included in the ambulatory care program, most frequently either because their medical situation did not allow for early discharge (58%), or because they had no care giver (14.6%), or had to travel a large distance to the hospital (14.6%). The 89 patients in the ambulatory care group, who underwent 119 cycles of high dose chemotherapy, spent almost 70% of the neutropenic phase at home. 37 out of 89 patients (46 cycles) were never readmitted to the hospital. None of these patients had to be admitted to the intensive care, and there was no treatment related mortality In the hospital group, 2 patients died, one because of pneumonia and one because of invasive aspergillosis. Patients and their caregivers felt safe and comfortable at home, and the vast majority preferred home care over in-hospital treatment. This study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of managing carefully selected patients in an ambulatory care setting after high dose chemotherapy.",

Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) ; (2)Leningrad Regional Clinical Hospital (St. Petersburg, RU) ; RU) Background: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is major cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. This study focuses on the risk factors, etiology and outcomes of IA. Methods: 356 pts after allogenic (allo) (237) and autologous (auto) HSCT (119) were included in 2000-2010 yy. Baseline patient characteristics and abbreviations are outlined in Table 1 . EORTC/MSG 2008 diagnostic criteria of IFD (proven and probable) were used. Results: The incidence of IA in alloHSCT group was higher 19% (45/237) then in autoHSCT group 9,2% (11/119) (p<0,001). Etiologic agents of IA after alloHSCT were A. fumigatus 60%, A. niger 20%, A. fl avus, A. ochracea, A. terreus -9%, and unidentifi ed Aspergillus spp. 11%. IA after autoHSCT were caused by A. fumigatus 54,5%, A. niger 18,2%, A. fl avus 9,1%, unidentifi ed Aspergillus spp. 18,2%. Median date of IA onset after alloHSCT was D+34 , after autoHSCT -D+11 (6-38) (p<0,05). In alloHSCT group risk factors were: previous IFD, nonmyeloablative (RIC) regimen, fl udarabin and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) use in conditioning regimen, lymphopenia >3 weeks, grade 4 neutropenia >2 weeks, acute GVHD, severe bacterial infection, CMV infection, underlying AL, and PBSC as a source of HSC (p<0,05). In this group cyclosporine A use was associated with higher risk of IA than tacrolimus (p<0,05). In autoHSCT group risk factors were: previous IFD, mucositis grade III-IV, lymphopenia >3 weeks, grade 4 neutropenia >2 weeks, severe bacterial infection (p<0,05). In this group G-CSF use was associated with increased risk of IA (p<0,001). In HSCT recipients the 12-week OS rate after diagnosis of IA was 68,2%. In 2000-2005 yy. 12-week OS rate was 52, 6%, in 2006-2010 yy. -72,7% (p<0,05) due to routine diagnostic procedures (galactomannan (GM) test and CT scan) and new antifungal drugs use. Conclusion: The incidence of IA in HSCT recipients was 16% (allo -19%, auto -9%). We reveal high rate of Aspergillus non-fumigatus as etiological agents. Usage of new antifungal drugs, routine GM test and CT scan improved 12-week OS rate.",

M\u00fcller (2) Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing HHSCT. The aim of our study is to identify factors related to the occurrence and the outcome of IA in this patient cohort. Between 2005 and 2010, 33 (M:F 22:11) patients received a HHSCT. Their median age was 52 years (range 17-69). All patients were heavily pre-treated (12 had previously undergone autologous transplantation) due to primary resistant haematological malignancies and/or early disease relapse. Four patients had a previous invasive fungal infection. Graft donors (M:F 27:7) had a median age of 41 years (range 21-67). High resolution HLA typing was available for 28 cases. Among them, in 12, the donor-recipient HLA combinations predicted NK cell alloreactivity against the HLA type of the patient. All conditioning regimens were Fludarabine based. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells. Eight grafts were obtained after selection of CD34+ cells, 24 after depletion of CD3+/CD19+ cells and 1 after both procedures. The median number of cells was: CD34+ 5.33E+06/Kg, CD3+ 3.8E+04/Kg, CD19+ 3E+04/Kg, NK 2.3E+08/Kg. Seventeen patients received prophylaxis against aGvHD. Six developed aGvHD grade II-III and 27 grade 0-I. The data of the HHSCT were compared to those from 39 patients who received graft from a matched sibling donor (control group). The median survival in HHSCT recipients was 115 days (range . Data for the occurrence of IA were available for 21 out of 33 patients. Based on the EORTC criteria, 15 cases were characterized as negative or possible and 6 as probable or proven (28%). Between these 2 groups there was no signifi cant difference on survival, on acute GvHD development and on the presence of KIR alloreactivity. The numbers of NK and T cells in the graft were not signifi cantly different. However, it was observed a trend of a higher number of CD34+ cells correlated with a lower incidence of IA (p< 0.1). A lower incidence of IA was observed in the control group (5 probable cases, 12%). Interestingly, the occurrence of IA in the later was correlated with a reduction of survival (p<0.015). HHSCT is a complex, high risk procedure, where numerous parameters contribute to morbidity and mortality. This might explain the different impact of IA between the HHSCT and control group, which undergoes a lower risk procedure. In any case, larger cohorts of patients enrolled in prospective studies might identify factors correlating with IA.",

During longstanding neutropenia, patients are at high risk for life-threatening sepsis. Aim: to assess the usefulness and protecting effect of recombinant human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (rHuG-CSF) plus Dexametasone mobilized granulocyte transfusions (GTX) combined with antimycotic drugs in severe neutropenic patient with fungal sepsis after autologous SCT. Patient and Methods: Male 42 years old patient was treated for lymphoblastic lymphoma at Clinical center of Serbia with Hyper-CVAD and due to high risk disease consolidated with autologous SCT in the complete remission in 2010. The number of reinfused CD34+ cells was 3.8x10E6/kgtm. Before GTX, severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count -ANC = 0.1x10E9/L) related to autologous SCT was persisted three weeks, complicated with fungal sepsis (Stephanoascus citerii and Candida guilliermondi) despite combined antimycotic (Voriconasol and Caspofungin), antibiotic, antiviral therapy and rHuG-CSF applying. Our own granulocyte-donor preconditioning regimen incorporated: rHuG-CSF 5 \u03bcg/kgbm for two days and Dexametasone 6 mg per os 12 h prior to apheresis. Granulocytes for supportive treatment were collected by Cobe Spectra (TerumoBCT, USA). Results: The processed blood volume was 6250 mL, the quantity of collected cell suspension was 360 mL, and the number of harvested granulocytes was 6.2x10E10/Unit. After cell collection, cells were irradiated with 25 Gy to prevent transfusion associated GvHD, and after that applied across central venous catheter. Patient was premedicated with Methylprednisolone, Ranitidine and Loretadine. The in vivo recovery, that is mean increase of the granulocyte count one hour after GTX was 0.9x10E9/L (0.5x10E9/L to 1.4x10E9/L), with consecutive rising until normalization in seven following days. To prevent of CMV infection, Gancyclovir was applied with resolving fungal sepsis, signifi cant decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) and patient's condition complete clinical recovery. Conclusion: The use of GTX and antimycotics can be a satisfactory and safe therapeutic approach with advantageous effects on invasive fungal sepsis in immunosuppressed neutropenic patients following SCT.",

Varal Erciyes University (Kayseri, TR) The results of the screening on Heamotopoetics Stem Cell Transplante patients, showed that the Quality Management System has decreased the \"catheter infection\" ratio and \"Pulmonary Aspergillosis Infection\" ratio. We have already screened the 60 Stem Cell Transplate Patients before Quality Management System according to Jacie (Joint Accreditation Committee of Eurepean Bone Marrow Transplant) and 60 Stem Cell Transplate Patients after the Quality Management System according to Jacie. Before Quality Management System there were 22 patients with \"Pulmonary Aspergillosis Infection\" in 60 patients and the ratio is % 36,6 and 11 patients with \"catheter infection\" in 60 patients and the ratio is % 18,3. After the Quality Management System there were 15 patients with \"Pulmonary Aspergillosis Infection\" in 60 patients and the ratio is % 25 and 5 patients with \"catheter infection\" in 60 patients and the ratio is % 8,3. With this QMS the ratio of \"Pulmonary Aspergillosis Infection\" decrease % 31,7 and \"catheter infection\" decrease % 55. All selection distribution before QMS 25 Allogeneic and 35 Autologous and after QMS 25 Allogeneic and 35 Autologous. Also the room temperatures are stable between 24-26 C, humidity is stable at %50-60, pressure is stable + 14-16 Pascal, at the same building at the same rooms. This screening study showed that the QMS can decrease the number of the infected patients, because of the rules and standars of hygneic patient care ,attention of all staff with the according to the rules of Jacie Standarts. Background: Voriconazole is frequently used in the prevention and treatment of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. The nonlinear pharmacokinetics and wide inter-and intrapatient variability leads to unpredictable plasma concentrations. Studies report that voriconazole trough levels correlate with effi cacy and toxicity and it has therefore been proposed that voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is necessary to improve patient outcomes. A 6-month pilot project to evaluate voriconazole TDM was initiated at our institution. We sought to evaluate the appropriateness and ordering and sampling practices of voriconazole TDM in our patients. Methods: All voriconazole TDM episodes performed on adults from May 1 to Nov 30, 2011 at the L/BMT Program of British Columbia were included in the study. Voriconazole was measured by UPLC using a UV detector. Steady-state voriconazole trough levels were defi ned as the following: Undetectable (less than 0.3 mg/L); Below therapeutic range (0.3-0.7 mg/L); Borderline therapeutic (0.8 -0.9 mg/L); Therapeutic (1-5.5 mg/L) and Toxic (greater than 5.5 mg/L) Results: 281 TDM levels were performed on 67 patients. 12 patients were excluded due to inappropriately drawn samples or missing information. Of the 214 resultant TDM episodes in 55 patients, voriconazole concentrations were outside of the therapeutic range in 54 (25.2%) TDM episodes: 6 (2.8%) were undetectable; 29 (13.6%) below therapeutic, 12 (5.6%) borderline therapeutic and 7 (3.3%) were toxic. The baseline level was outside of the therapeutic range in 25/55 pts (45.5%). Of those 25, only 6 (24%) had their voriconazole dose adjusted and 19 (76%) did not. Reasons for non-action included not drawn at steady-state, not drawn appropriately, prophylaxis, desire to wait for a repeat level or no reason was given at all. Of those 6 patients where an action was taken, 2 patients became therapeutic, 1 borderline therapeutic, and 3 patients did not have follow-up levels drawn. Conclusion: This pilot study highlights the importance of appropriate sampling and interpretation. 45.5% of patients had nontherapeutic baseline trough levels and only 6 of those patients had their dose adjusted. On the basis of these fi ndings, we conclude that voriconazole TDM should be implemented to optimize patient outcomes and that there is a need for a standardized dosing adjustment algorithm to assist clinicians in interpreting and adjusting dosing for voriconazole trough levels.",

Karas, K. Steinerov\u00e1, T. Svoboda, S. Vokurka, P. Jindra, V. Koza Charles University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aloSCT) can improve outcome of patients (pts) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The part of pts with AML can suffer from invasive aspergillosis (IA) during remission induction treatment. These pts as potential candidates for aloSCT have higher risk of IA relapse and accompanying higher morbidity and mortality after aloSCT. Several published studies indicate that secondary prophylaxis with potent antifungal agents could decrease risk of IA relapse after aloSCT. To evaluate the role of secondary prophylaxis with voriconazole in pts with history of IA who undergo aloSCT for AML we retrospectively analysed outcome of such pts transplanted at our centre. Patients and Methods: in period 1/2005-10/2011, 21 pts with AML (71% in 1.CR, 29% beyond 1.CR) and history of IA (38% with residual infi ltrates) underwent aloSCT (81% redecudintensity, 19% myeloablative aloSCT). The donor was in 29% HLA identical related, in 38% matched and in 33% mismatched unrelated. Source of stem cells was peripheral blood and the median of infused CD 34+cells was 5,2x10 6 /kg (range: 1,7-14,9x10 6 /kg). CsA and methotrexate were administered as GVHD prophylaxis. Voriconazole (200mg twice daily) was used as invasive fungal infection (IFI) prophylaxis from day -1. Other antimicrobial prophylaxis included norfl oxacin and aciclovir. Evaluation and treatment of aloSCT complications and outcome was made according to established criteria and recommendation. Results: All pts fully engrafted and achieved CR. 7 pts (33%) developed aGVHD (5% grade III-IV) and among 18 evaluable pts 10 (56%) of them developed chGVHD (50% extensive). With median follow-up 23 months (range, 2-64 months) 13 pts (62%) are alive in CR. 2 pts (10%) relapsed and died. 6 pts (28%) died due to NRM and 2 (10%) of them till day 100. The median time of voriconazole administration was 60 days (range, 21-131 days) and only in 1 patient (5%) voriconazole was stopped due to hepatic toxicity. With above mentioned follow-up only 2 pts (10%) developed IFI (1 case with IFI-related death). The estimated probabilities of 3-years EFS and OS are 52%. Conclusion: In spite of relatively small number of analysed pts and retrospective type of analysis, our data suggest and also support results of previous published studies that secondary prophylaxis with voriconazole in pts with AML and history of IA undergoing aloSCT is well tolerated and can protect these pts from higher risk of IA relapse.",

Shaul (2), , N. Mir (3) Objectives: Antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) is used in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) recipients to prevent the signifi cant morbidity and mortality associated with invasive fungal infections (IFI). Currently, there is no standard prophylactic agent in Spain for alloHCT recipients post-engraftment. Voriconazole (VOR) is approved for the treatment of various types of IFI, with potential for an expanded indication that includes its use as primary AFP in alloHCT recipients post-transplant. The aim of this study was, therefore, to inform health care decision-makers of the possible fi nancial implications to the Spanish national health system should VOR be approved for this expanded indication. Methods: A budget-impact model (BIM) was constructed based on a population of 709 alloHCT patients, all of whom would be expected to receive AFP, as confi rmed by expert opinion. The model considered costs from day +1 to day +100 associated with drug acquisition (excluding value added tax), switching to other licensed antifungal treatment (OLAT) due to failure or toxicity of original prophylaxis, IFI monitoring, and treating breakthrough IFI. The baseline cost model was based upon current prescribing patterns for orally available, mould-active AFP: 50% for itraconazole, 20% for posaconazole, and 30% for VOR. Three scenarios were developed, assuming a 10%, 15%, and 20% increase in VOR-based AFP, respectively. All estimates for treatment duration, drug usage, and costs were confi rmed by expert opinion. Results: Based on an average incremental cost for all 3 scenarios, the expanded indication for VOR resulted in an average cost increase of \u20ac206,323 in the population of interest (Table) . This increase was derived from a baseline total cost of \u20ac10,441,526. When considering drug costs only (ie, for both prophylactic agent and OLAT), the incremental cost per patient ranged from \u20ac365 to \u20ac730 and the total incremental cost from \u20ac258,720 to \u20ac517,439. When additionally considering costs for treatment of breakthrough IFI, the incremental cost per treated patient ranged from \u20ac194 to \u20ac388 and the total incremental cost from \u20ac137,549 to \u20ac275,098. Conclusion: Along with the assumed increase in VOR use in this setting, expanding the indication of VOR to include AFP in alloHCT recipients post-transplant was projected to minimally increase the overall cost incurred by the Spanish health system.",

Apperley, K. Rezvani Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) AmBisome (amphotericin B liposomal complex, L-Amb) is highly effective for the treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI) and may be an important prophylactic drug in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) specially in patients with liver impairment. We retrospectively analysed the effi cacy and safety of two high dose L-Amb regimens, namely 7 mg/kg given once a week vs. 10 mg/kg given every 10 days, for prophylaxis of IFI in patients who underwent a HSCT at our institution between January 2005 and June 2011. Twenty patients (median age 41 years, range 19-67) received 10 mg/kg every 10 days for a median of 5.6 weeks (range 2-25 weeks) and 13 patients (median age 45 years, range 28-65) received the weekly 7 mg/kg regimen for a median of 8 weeks (range 4-25 weeks). Indications for prophylaxis included prophylaxis in patients having GVHD treatment (n=17), secondary prophylaxis for prior IFI (n=10) and intolerance or allergy to azoles (n=6). There was no signifi cant difference in baseline characteristics or indications for prophylaxis in the 2 groups. Results: Both regimens were well tolerated and there were no cases of discontinuation of prophylactic treatment due to adverse events. Transient rises in serum creatinine and serum potassium levels were noted in 3 patients in the 10 mg/kg every 10 days group and in 2 patients in the weekly 7 mg/kg group. The renal toxicity was reversible in all and responded to intravenous fl uids. Liver function tests remained stable in all patients analysed. We found no signifi cant differences in the rates of breakthrough fungal infections in the 2 groups. Two patients in the 10 mg/kg every 10 days group and 1 in the weekly 7 mg/kg group developed breakthrough fungal infections.",

Peccatori Scientifi c Institute H S Raffaele (Milan, IT) Background: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) constitute a substantial source of morbidity and mortality among patients (pts) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Anidulafungin (ANI) is an echinocandin that inhibits glucan sinthase, an important enzyme in the formation of fungal cell wall; it has a broad antifungal spectrum of action, low toxicity profi le without relevant drug interactions. Aim: ANI safety and effi cacy as antifungal prophylaxis agent was tested in pts with high risk hematological malignancies receiving alloHSCT from July 2009 to March 2011. Materials and Methods: In our institution, we analyzed 36 pts with high risk hematological malignancies (18 acute leukemia, 2 chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 non Hodgkin limphoma, 2 Hodgkin limphoma, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome, 2 myelofi brosis) undergoing allo-SCT: 19 Haploidentical SCT (Haplo), 9 Matched Related Donor (MRD), 7 Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD), 1 Cord Blood (CB). Disease status at SCT was intermediate/advanced in 21/36 pts; anti-thymocyte globulin was administered to 21/36 pts and 2/36 pts performed a previous allo-SCT. The median time from diagnosis to allo-SCT was 664 days (range: 51-4022). Antifungal prophylaxis with ANI was started 1 day before conditioning (200 mg die iv single dose, then 100 mg die iv) until [P486] S132 neutrophil engraftment (PMN >0.5 x 10e9/l for 3 consecutive days) and subsequently replaced with voriconazole. Prophylaxis was primary in 34/36 pts and secondary in 2/36 pts. Results: We observed in 1/36 pts an allergic grade II skin toxicity after the fi rst ANI administration that was immediately interrupted. Median duration of ANI therapy was 23 days (range: . Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 20 days (range: 12-52). 19/36 pts stopped ANI at neutrophil engraftment, without signs of IFIs. 16/36 pts stopped ANI for proven (3/19 pts) or probable IFIs (3/19 pts) (EORTC 2008 criteria) and we replaced it with Voriconazole. In the MRD setting, 7/9 pts stopped ANI for engraftment, 1 for allergic reaction and 1 for possible IFI. In the Haplo setting, 7/19 pts stopped ANI for engraftment and 5/19 for proven/probable IFIs. In the MUD setting, 5/7 pts stopped ANI for engraftment and 2/7 for possible IFI. Patient receiving CB stopped ANI for proven IFI. Overall fungi isolated in proven IFI were aspergillus. Conclusions: ANI is a well tolerated antifungal agent and a choice as primary prophylaxis in high risk pts receiving allo-SCT.",

Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) Micafungin, a novel echinocandin, has been approved for prophylaxis of candida infections in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, data on micafungin's use in clinical practice are limited. Therefore, we retrospectively determined effi cacy and toxicity of primary antifungal prophylaxis with micafungin in different dosage regimens in a total of 150 adult pts undergoing allo-HSCT. Fifty consecutive patients each received micafungin at a dose of 50 mg (1/2010 to 7/2010), 100 mg (9/2010 to 4/2011) or 150 mg (5/2011 to 11/2011) once daily starting from day 0 or earlier, whether leucocyte count was \u22641000/\u03bcl. There were no signifi cant differences regarding age, gender, days of leukopenia, or duration of micafungin prophylaxis (16.0 vs. 15.4 vs. 16.0 days) across the 3 groups. In those pts who received micafungin for at least 6 days, 12/46 (26%), 6/44 (14%) and 9/46 (20%) pts received empiric antifungal treatment according to local standards. However, the frequency of invasive fungal infections according to EORTC criteria did not differ signifi cantly (7/46; 15% vs. 5/44; 11% vs. 5/46; 11%) across the different dosage groups. In the 50-mggroup there was one case of candidaemia with C. parapsilosis after 12 days of micafungin. In all three groups, micafungin prophylaxis was well tolerated without any case of toxicity-related treatment discontinuation. Renal function was not signifi cantly altered (median change of serum creatinine from 0.8 to 1.0 mg/dl after 9 days in each group). In 61% of pts total bilirubin signifi cantly increased due to ATG application. In the remaining 57 pts, total bilirubin increased by median 0.8 mg/dl (baseline: 0.7 mg/dl) 6 days from start of micafungin. The incidence of invasive fungal infections is similar irrespective of the micafungin dosage. Toxicity and tolerability of micafungin prophylaxis are good in the allotansplant setting.",

In patients with cancer a meta-analysis showed that primary antifungal prophylaxis (PAP) with moldactive antifungals agents reduced the documented aspergillosis (Robenshtok JCO 2007) . Micafungin, an echinocandin with activity against Candida and Aspergillus, has a good safety profi le, even in patients with liver or kidney impairments, and it can be used at the same time with the conditioning treatment (CT). Moreover it has no signifi cant interactions with other drugs. In the last three years (September-08/September-11) we have progressively changed our PAP with intravenous itraconazole by micafungin during the neutropenic period in HSCT. We used intravenous itraconazole on the day +1 and micafungin at the beginning of CT. Both were used until resolved mucositis and oral fungal prophylaxis with posaconazole could be started. Moreover intravenous PAP was changed by empirical antifungal treatment or pre-emptive / targeted treatment when they were needed. We present the characteristic and comparative results of the patients treated with each of these drugs, Table 1 , cohort 1(itraconazole 200 mg/day, load dose 400 mg one day) and cohort 2 (micafungin 50 mg/day) Results: Both cohorts presented the same median age (43 vs. 42).

Sirvent University Hospital of Montpellier (Montpellier, FR) Invasive fungal infections (IFI) constitute a major cause of mortality and morbidity among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) recipients. Because early diagnosis and treatment of IFI are the key factors for improving the prognosis, a prophylactic antifungal strategy has been recommended for high risk patients. Objectives: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effi cacy and safety of micafungin antifungal prophylaxis for IFI in pediatric and adult ASCT recipients during the neutropenic phase of high risk transplants (defi ned as myeloablative conditioning, mismatch transplants or umbilical cord blood transplant) and in patients with graft versus host disease (GvHD) to whom posaconazole could not be administered because of oral route unavailability or gastrointestinal dysfunction. The primary endpoint was treatment success, which was defined as no change in antifungal therapy for any reason. The secondary endpoints were the incidence of proven, probable or possible IFI, safety, and overall survival 4 and 12 weeks postmicafungin initiation. Methods: The fi les of all the institution's patients (pts) who received micafungin prophylaxis between October 2009 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical signs, blood culture results, serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen results, computed tomography scans, liver function test results and adverse events were recorded and analyzed. Results: Forty pts (29 adults and 11 children) received prophylactic micafungin at a dosage of 50 mg daily for adults and 1 mg/kg for children weighting <50 kg for a mean treatment duration of 21 days. Prophylaxis was given either during the neutropenic phase of ASCT (n=30) or to pts with GvHD (n=11). The overall success rate was 46% (45% for GvHD, 47% for neutropenic phase of ASCT). For 22 pts, antifungal prophylaxis was discontinued for the following reasons: persistant fever, which was treated empirically, in 13 pts (32%); possible or probable invasive aspergillosis in 5 pts (12%), invasive aspergillosis in 3 pts (7%) and candidemia in 1 patient (2%) (EORTC criteria). In the group of 30 pts treated during neutropenic phase, possible, probable or proved IFI were observed in only 3 pts. No toxicity or other serious adverse event resulted in treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: Micafungin may constitute a valuable prophylactic alternative in high-risk ASCT during neutropenic phase.",

Although prophylactic antifungal therapy with fl uconazole has become the standard care for these patients, it has been associated with the emergence of fl uconazole-resistant Candida infections. Additionally, fl uconazole is not reliably effective against invasive aspergillosis. Methods: Between January 2010 and September 2011, We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the usefulness of the administration of micafungin (Mycamine\u00ae), a class of echinocandin, as a prophylactic antifungal therapy for patients undergoing HSCT. Micafungin was started at a daily dose of 50 mg once a day intravenously over 1 hour from day 1 after HSCT. Therapy was continued until 3 days after hematological engraftment (defi ned as an absolute neutrophil count of over 500/uL after the nadir). Prophylactic success was defi ned as the absence of proven, probable, or suspected systemic fungal infection through the end of prophylaxis therapy and as the absence of a proven or probable systemic fungal infection through the end of the 4-week post treatment period. Results: A total of 35 patients who underwent HSCT were enrolled in the study. Underlying diseases included acute leukemia (n = 18), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 5), aplastic anemia (n=4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 3), and others (n = 5). HSCT were HLA-matched sibling (n=11), matched unrelated (n=15), mismatched unrelated (n=2) or autologous (n=7). The median durations of administration of micafungin were 14 days (range 12-17 days). Prophylactic success was achieved in 34 (97.1%) of the 35 evaluated patients. No patients showed proven or probable IFI. Micafungin was well tolerated, and none of the patients required dose reduction due to adverse effects. Conclusions: Our results indicate the effectiveness and safety of micafungin a daily dose of 50 mg as an prophylactic antifungal therapy in patients undergoing HSCT.",

Meyer (1) , M. Schmitt (2) Introduction: Fungal infections are known as a cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Therefore effective antifungal prophylaxis is necessary. The echinocandine Micafungin is approved for the prophylaxis of candidiasis in HSCT recipients. Here we report our experience with Micafungin as antifungal prophylaxis in the setting of alloHSCT. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed fi ve male and two female patients (pts.) who underwent alloHSCT between december 2010 and may 2011 due to AML (n=4), MDS (n=1), ALL (n=1) and NHL (n=1), respectively. The pts. with a median age of 57 years (range 27 to 69 years) received 50 mg (n=6) or 100 mg (n=1) of Micafungin once daily as primary antifungal prophylaxis after alloHSCT. Median time of Micafunginadministration was 17 days (range 12 to 33 days), beginning between day -21 and day 0 prior to alloHSCT. In fi ve of seven patients Micafungin-prophylaxis was switched to other drugs (predominantly Posaconazole) as breakthrough-infections or major side-effects were observed. Results: The infusion of Micafungin was well tolerated. One patient developed an allergic drug rash and an elevation of liver enzymes, both resolving after discontinuitation of Micafungin. Three of seven pts. developed an oropharyngeal fungal colonisation caused by candida albicans occurring on day 8, 12 and 15 after beginning of antifungal prophylaxis. In addition we observed one severe breakthrough-infection with candida albicans recovered from the bloodstream on day 16 after beginning of Micafungin-prophylaxis. The pt. died from fulminant septicaemia with multi-organ failure on day +17 after alloHSCT. In the whole cohort there was no evidence of fungal-infections caused by aspergillus spp. Conclusion: Despite its known activity against candida spp., Micafungin administered at a dose of 50 mg daily showed no suffi cient antifungal activity, even against non-resistant candida-strains. Additionally, signifi cant side-effects were observed in our cohort of patients. Therefore, the role of Micafungin as antifungal prophylaxis after alloHSCT needs to be further evaluated. A. Alanazi, J. Doyle, U. Allen, S. Richardson, M. Egeler, A. Gassas, T. Schechter The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, CA) Background: Clostridium diffi cile infection (CDI) is one of the most common bacterial causes of nosocomial diarrhea. It is a cause of signifi cant morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. There is limited information on its prevalence and outcome among pediatric patients receiving hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). However, some studies have reported the incidence to be as high as 20%. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, recurrence rate and outcomes associated with CDI in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT. Methods: All pediatric patients who underwent HSCT at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, between 2001 and 2009 have been reviewed from time of admission to HSCT and up to six months post HSCT. The laboratory diagnosis of CDI was based on cytotoxin detection in Vero cells from fecal specimens for all patients with clinical signs of diarrhea. Outbreak was defi ned as more than 2 episodes in different patients over a period of 2 weeks. CDI recurrence and patient's outcome was documented. Results: Between 2001 -2009 a total of 797 HSCTs were performed: 431 allogeneic and 366 autologous. Median age at the time of transplant was 8.0 years (range, 1.0-19.0). We observed 83 episodes of CDI (9.8%) in HSCT recipients. 4.9% of the allogeneic and 9.3% of the autologous patients. CDI episodes occurred at a median of 4 days post-HSCT (range: day -8 to day +180) following HSCT. 78 patients responded to therapy with metronidazole and 2 patients required adding second drug-vancomycin, 3 patients didn't receive therapy. Recurrent CDI occurred in seven patients (8.3%). Only one patient developed severe CDI with pneumatosis intestinalis. The cause of death for the patient was relapse of the primary disease and adenovirus pneumonitis. None of our patients succumbed to CDI. 14 patients were diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis: 11 torovirus, 2 rota virus and 1 adenovirus. We observed 9 episodes of outbreaks. Conclusions: CDI occurred in nearly 10% of pediatric patients undergoing HSCT, especially in autologous HSCT. Nearly all patients experience mild CDI with adequate response to antibiotic therapy. This study is the largest to date to evaluate the outcome of CDI in Pediatric HSCT recipients.",

Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of Children Hematology and Transplantation, Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Objectives: To examine shifts in the etiology and susceptibility of bacterial isolates from allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. Patients and Methods: Between January 2008 and September 2011, all positive cultures from 155 pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing allo-HSCT were reviewed. Results: The most common pathogens were S.epidermidis (14%), Enterococci spp. (17%), Kl.pneumoniae (16%), E.coli (8%), Enterobacter spp. (7%), Acinetobacter spp. (5,5%) , and Ps.aeruginosa (6,5%). Of the 873 isolates, 394 (45%) were gram-positive (GPB) bacteria and 55% were gram-negative (GNB). In the 2008-2009 period GPB accounted for 41% of all bacterial infections, whereas in the 2010-2011 period the percentage had increased to 48%. All patients received as prophylaxis ciprofl oxacin and 53% of all isolates was resistant to this fl uoroquinolone, and resistance increased from 38% to 65%. There was trend of increasing rates among vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) 4% vs 9,5%. S.aureus were resistant to oxacillin in 17%. We observed increasing rates of multiresistant strains of Ps.aeruginosa, Kl.pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp. In 10% Ps.aeruginosa isolates were panresistant. Analysis of susceptibility shows high effi cacy of vancomycin, linezolide and piperacillin/tazobactam, moderate effi cacy of carbapenems, cefoperasone/sulbactam, quinolones and aminoglycosides, and increasing resistance to cefalosporines of III generation. Conclusions: There is a slight prevalence of GNB and the trend of increasing role of GPB. We observed increasing rates of multiresistant strains GNB. The recommendation of cefalosporines of III generation may not be appopriate. Keywords: bacterial infections, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, antibiotic resistance.",

Avaky, P. Stepensky, S. Benenson, M. Harit, D. Engelhard Hadassah Medical Center (Jerusalem, IL) Introduction: Non-fermentative gram negative rods (NFGNR), as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Acinetobacter baumanii (AB), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) are important causes of blood stream infections in children with hemato-oncological diseases and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). They are frequently resistant to multiple antibiotic classes. Aim: To analyze resistance pattern of NFGNR in children with hematological malignancies and HSCT and to determine if bacteremia with NFGNR is associated with high mortality. Methods: All episodes of NFGNR bacteremia that occurred during 2001-2011 in children with hematological malignancies or post-HSCT in our tertiary hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. that exhibited resistance to three or more antibiotic classes, as well as all SM were defi ned multidrug resistant (MDR). Mortality at 7 and 30 days after infection was recorded. Two or more positive blood cultures were considered positive for Acinetobacter lwofi i and Pseudomonas stutzeri. Results: 66 NFGNR were isolated from blood cultures of 52 children, 33 male, 7 months to 17, median 5, years old. Underlying diseases included: hematological malignancy (n=40), HSCT (n=26; 22 allogeneic, 3 autologous and 1 cord blood) for malignancy/premalignancy (n=16) or nonmalignant conditions (n=10). 29 (44%) episodes occurred during neutropenia, 17 (26%) were nosocomial. In HSCT patients they occurred 0-600 (mean 159, median 57) days after transplantation. NFGNR included PA (n=30;46%), SM (13;19%), AB (7;11%); Pseudomonas spp (6;9%), Acinetobacter spp (10;15%). Mortality at 7 (attribute mortality) and 30 days after infection was 1/66 (1.5%) and 2/66 (3%), respectively. NFGNR were non-susceptible to: ciprofl oxacin 6/60 (10%), carbapenems 14/66 (21%). All SM were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole; all 11 Acinetobacter spp. to minocycline. 1/10 (10%) of Acinetobacter spp. were non-susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. were non-susceptible to: piperacillin 8/50 (16%), ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam 6/52 (11.5%) each, gentamicin 4/52 (8%), amikacin 1/52 (2%). 20% of all NFGNR were MDR, including 3/36 (8%) Pseudomonas, 3/17 (18%) Acinetobacter spp. and all 13 SM. Conclusions: Mortality rate due to NFGNR is relatively low despite of emerging resistance. NFGNR bacteremia can frequently occur without association with neutropenia and hospitalization.",

Ros\u00e1rio (1) , I. Carvalhais (1) Empirical beta-lactam monotherapy has become the standard fi rst line therapy in febrile neutropenia. Objective: Evaluate which regimen was preferable empiric antibiotic monotherapy in BMT patients (pts). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 236 pts as intention to treat piperacillin-tazobactam (4x4.5 g IV/day) from May 2009 to April 2010 and meropenem (3x1 g IV/day) from May 2010 to April 2011 for BMT procedures. We evaluated the pts for evidence of bacterial infection and glycopeptide addiction using the EORTC criteria. Results: Fifty one pts had no fever (27 piperacillin-tazobactam, 24 meropenem). One hundred and eighty fi ve episodes were assessable (82 piperacillin-tazobactam, 103 meropenem). Median duration of treatment was: 6 days (0-19 days) piperacillin-tazobactam 7 days (1-19 days) meropenem. The classifi cation (EORTC) was: microbiological documentation (12.9% vs 23.2%), clinical documentation (15.1% vs 10.7%), with no explanation (60.2% vs 55.4%), no infectious (1.1% vs 0.9%). We observed similar success rates without modifi cation (37.6% vs 42.5%), success with modifi cation (1.1% vs 1.8%) and treatment failure (48.4% vs 46%). There were no differences in overall mortality rate and overall survival. Conclusion: The result of the empirical regimen of piperacillintazobactam was similar to meropenem as fi rst line monotherapy in two consecutive years in BMT recipients.

Since nephrotoxicity of tacrolimus concomitantly administered with nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents has yet to be fully, we retrospectively evaluated its safety in the recipients of allogeneic HSCT. Patients and Methods: Recipients of allogeneic HSCT who received intravenous AGs or GPs during the continuous intravenous infusion of tacrolimus within 30 days after transplantation were included in this study. Fifty patients fulfi lled the criteria and could be evaluated. The data including patient characteristics, whole blood concentration of tacrolimus, the dose and duration of AG/GP treatment, and serum creatinine were obtained from data base and medical records. Therapeutic drug monitorings of AGs, GPs, and tacrolimus were systematically performed in all the patients. Results: Median age of the 50 patients was 47.5 years (range: 18-60). Of these patients, there were 40 episodes of tacrolimus administration with AGs (amikacin, gentamicin, arbekacin) and 38 with GPs (teicoplanin, vancomycin). Median duration of the concomitant administration with tacrolimus was 8 days (range: 2-22) for AGs and 11.5 days (range: 4-40) for GPs. Mean blood concentrations (\u00b1SD) of tacrolimus during AG and GP administration were 17.1\u00b12.1 and 16.2\u00b11.6 mcg/ml, respectively. Twice or greater increases of serum creatinine compared with that before initiating AGs or GPs were observed only in 2 of 40 (5.0%) episodes with AGs and 1 of 38 (2.8%) with GPs. Nephrotoxicity observed in these patients was reversible and hemodialysis was not required. Conclusion: Since incidence of clinically signifi cant nephrotoxicity was low, it was suggested that tacrolimus can safely be administered concomitantly with AGs or GPs even in the early post-transplant period.",

The aim of our study was to assume the frequency of the fever of unknown origin and the profi le of detected bacteria, then estimate the effi cacy of empirical antimicrobial therapy after SCT in our centre. In the years 2005 -2011, in our centre 65 allogeneic SCTs were performed (30 HLA-sibling and 38 alternative donors) in 44 boys and 21 girls, in the median age of 11 years (range: 1 month-21 years). The main indications for transplant were acute lymphoblastic leucaemia (29), severe inborn immunodeffi ciencies (13), acute myeloblastic leucaemia (7) and severe aplastic anaemia (7). We assessed cases of fever and the profi le of microbiologically proved infections in post transplant course, and the response to empiric and adjusted antimicrobial therapy. Post-transplant aplastic phase lasted 19 days (SD=4 days). Neutropenic fever occurred in 51 patients. In 16 children, the clinical state (sepsis, diarrhoea, balanitis, cystitis or toxic epidermolysis) and microbial fi ndings were found a cause of fever. In last 35 patients we diagnosed fever of unknown origin (FUO). First line treatment (piperacillin/tazobactam + aminoglycoside) was effective in 37% patients. The most effective next line therapy in FUO was a combination of polypeptide or karbapenem and a new antifungal agent. The profi le of bacteriemia in the post transplant course (aplastic and post-engrafment phases) and adjusted therapy are shown in Table 1 . Staphyloccus epidermidis (MRSE in 50%) was detected in 47% of positive blood cultures. Lower respiratory tract was infected the most frequently with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or MRSE (cultured in BAL material). Gastrointestinal tract was infected by Enterococcus faecium in 41% of positive stool cultures (HLAR in 10%), besides Enterobacter hafniae, Citrobacter freundi, Proteus mirabilis and Clostridium diffi cile were frequently found.

Vallejo University Central Hospital of Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Introduction: CMV disease (CMVD) has historically been a major cause of morbi-mortality after allo-HSCT. Careful monitoring and pre-emptive therapy of CMV reactivation has become standard practice in order to prevent from CMVD. For different reasons, including the frequent presence of post-HSCT leukopenia, genome detection by quantitative PCR has become the method of election for CMV monitoring in the allo-HSCT setting. Plasma is the most frequently used sample, but the measurement of the CMV load in cells from peripheral blood (PB) might estimate more accurately the viral kinetics. Objectives: To address the sensitivity and the precocity of detection of CMV infection by qPCR in whole PB compared to plasma samples, and the correlation between CMV loads in PB and in plasma in the allo-HSCT setting. (2-4.58) in PB, and 3.31\u00b10.66 c/mL (2.3-4.3) in plasma. CMV was identifi ed at the same time in both samples in 5 episodes, earlier in PB in 4, and was only present in PB in 11. When viral load from PB was transformed into c/10 5 leukocytes, CMV load was: 36 < log 2, 10 log 2-3, and 2 log 3-4; the average number of c/10 5 leukocytes was 1.8\u00b10.71 (0.5-3.75) . A signifi cant correlation between PB and leukocytes was found. Conclusions: 1) CMV detection in PB was more sensitive than in plasma, which might be useful to prevent from CMVD in highly immunosuppressed pts. 2) CMV infection was detected earlier by PCR assays in PB than in plasma. 3) CMV load was similar in PB and plasma. 4) There was a correlation between viral load in PB and leukocytes.",

Rovira Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, ES) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a frequent complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). One of the most important factors for preventing and clearing CMV infection is the development of an adequate immune reconstitution post-transplant. There is accumulating evidence that the number of lymphocytes CMV-specifi c (CD8/IFN-gamma) infl uences the risk of CMV infection and its recurrence. It's also known that graft versus host disease (GVHD) and steroid administration increase the incidence of CMV infection. However, the effect of steroid therapy on S138 CMV-specifi c immune response and its correlation with the CMV infection has not yet been studied. Hypothesis: Quantifi cation of CMV specifi c immune response and to receive or not steroids could stratify patients in different groups of risk for CMV infection. Patients: Twenty-two consecutive patients who underwent allo-SCT from June 2010 to January 2011 in one single centre (Table 1) .",

Gonzalez, A.J. Gonzalez, S. Gonzalez, S. Mel\u00f3n, C. Ray\u00f3n, C. Vallejo Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease has historically been a major cause of morbi-mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). During the nineties, the implementation of preemptive strategies resulted in a dramatic reduction of CMV disease. During the past decade, introduction of valganciclovir (VGCV) helped signifi cantly improve the management of pts with CMV reactivation (CMVr). However, VGCV, as a potentially myelotoxic drug, can lead to cytopenias and their clinical consequences. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of VGCV on peripheral blood counts in allo-HSCT pts with CMVr. Design and Methods: We studied 54 pts who underwent consecutive allo-HSCT in 2009 and 2010. Median age was 49 years (range: 6-63). The majority (87%) received ATG as part of the conditioning at a median dose of 2.37 mg/kg (range: 1-8.75 ). All pts received acyclovir, but none of them anti-CMV prophylaxis. All pts received CMV seronegative and leukodepleted blood components. The pts were monitored for CMVr in whole blood and leucocytes with both quantitative PCR and pp65 anti genemia. Results: CMVr occurred in 66.7% of cases, at a median time of day +58 post-HSCT (range: -7 to +790). Older age, ATGcontaining conditioning, grade III-IV acute GvHD, and \u22652 immunosuppressive drugs were found to be risk factors for CMVr. Treatment with VGCV was given in 87.9% of cases. Induction therapy lasted 14 days (range: 3-25) and maintenance therapy 21 days (range: 14-28). After VGCV treatment, 23% of pts developed signifi cant anemia (hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL), and 16% signifi cant thrombocytopenia (platelets <20.000/mcL), requiring PRBC and/or platelets concentrates transfusions. On the other hand, 22.6% of pts had VGCV-related neutropenia (RAN < 500/mcL), requiring the administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) for a median time of 5 days. In all cases, VGCV-related cytopenias were reversible. Conclusion: CMV reactivation continues to be very common after allo-HSCT. In spite of the fact that the introduction of oral VGCV has improved dramatically the management of CMVr in this setting, a considerable of pts will develop signifi cant cytopenias. The knowledge of this potential adverse effect of the drug is very important in order to avoid the presentation of potentially life-threatening clinical consequences.",

Lin, C.C. Li, B.S. Ko, M. Yao, J.L. Tang, H.F. Tien National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei, TW) Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the important complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), especially in Taiwan, where the CMV seropositive rate is more than 90% in adults. (Lu SC, Kaohsiung J Med Sci. 1999 ) Platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRa) activation was reported to be critical for CMV infection. (Soroceanu L, Nature 2008) This trial aims to test whether PDGFRa inhibition by nilotinib effectively prevents patients from CMV infection after allo-SCT. The ClinicalTrial.gov identifi er for this trial is NCT01252017. Methods: Patients received nilotinib 200 mg/day after engraftment. Plasma CMV DNA copies were monitored by real-time Q-PCR at least once a week. Failure of prophylaxis was defi ned as plasma CMV copies higher than 10,000/ml or, regardless of levels, initiation of other anti-CMV treatments for defi nite or clinically suspected CMV disease. Primary endpoint was defi ned as rate of successful prophylaxis by day+100 after transplant. A Simon two-stage design considered the treatment unfeasible if less than nine successful patients were observed among the fi rst 14 patients, otherwise the trial is planned to continue accrual up to a total of 31 patients. Results: Between Dec. 2010 and Dec. 2011, 13 patients were enrolled. At the time of this analysis, 12 patients were evaluable, including four males and eight females. The median age for evaluable patients was 48.6 years. Eight patients received fl udarabine and two, antithymocyte globulin, in their conditioning courses. The median time of starting nilotinib was day+20; the median duration of nilotinib treatment was 80 days. No patients had nilotinib-associated grade 3/4 adverse effects and none had early treatment discontinuation for toxicities. Prophylaxis was successful in nine patients: in four, plasma CMV was continuously undetectable; in the other fi ve, there were subclinical, asymptomatic elevations which later resolved spontaneously. For the three failed patients whose plasma CMV copies were higher than 10,000/ml, one elected to continue nilotinib treatment; the other two switched to ganciclovir treatment. The CMV levels of all these three patients declined smoothly later and none of them developed CMV diseases during the follow-up period. Conclusion: Nilotinib is safe and well tolerated and appears to be feasible in this population of transplanted patients. Accordingly current results permit the trial to continue to the second stage.",

San Miguel Izquierdo Hospital Cl\u00ednico Salamanca (Salamanca, ES) Introduction: The Sirolimus based treatment is seen as protective against the reactivation of Citomegalovirus (CMV) infection in the context of haematopoyetic transplantation, though the evidence level is not strong enough in the international literature. Background: Meningoencephalomyeloradiculitis (MEMR) after stem cell transplantation is a very rare syndrome, characterized by extensive involvement of the nervous system at different levels, including brain, medulla and spinal roots. Case report: We describe a 3-year male patient, 4 months after unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) presenting with prodromal febrile illness, followed by a wide infection of the nervous system with myelitis and less severe meningitis, encephalitis and polyradiculopathy. Clinical symptoms: The syndrome was characterized by subacute onset of leg weakness and gait disturbance. The boy was unable to sit or stand. Bladder function was normal. The disease was diagnosed by neurological examination, serologic determinations, CMV-specifi c polymerase chain reaction in cerebrospinal fl uid and serum, and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging scan of the spine. A neurological examination revealed the presence of myeloradiculopathy causing a signifi cant weakness in the leg muscles. Neck stiffness and Kernig sign were also observed. Deep tendon refl exes were present in the lower extremities. A lumbar puncture yielded cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) containing normal number of neutrophils. Peripheral blood: oligoclonal IgG band. Serum CMV-DNA-emia was not detected at diagnosis, while CMV-DNA load in CSF was 2.26x10E2/mL. It was cleared after one-week therapy, with no EBV-DNA load in CSF and serum. MRI study showed two hipointensive lesions located in the cerebellum and in the periventricular area. The MRI revealed also an increased signal in lumbosacral roots. The patient was treated with systemic intravenous ganciclovir and steroids. The symptoms abate and the patient has recovered completely within 4 weeks, without neurological sequelae. This case suggests that ganciclovir with steroids appear to be effective for the treatment of CMV-induced MEMR in immunocompromised patients following CBT. Conclusions: CMV is not known to be highly infectious for the nervous system, however in this case of MEMR, the presence of DNA sequences in the CSF suggests that CMV plays a role in the development of this newly described syndrome. Clinical, immunological and neuroimaging fi ndings indicate that postinfectious immune mediated infl ammation seems the most probable pathogenetic mechanism in this disease.",

Rohrlich CHU Besan\u00e7on (Besan\u00e7on, FR) Introduction: Ventriculitis is a rare but severe localisation of CNS cytomegalovirus infection. CMV ventriculitis has a dismal prognosis thus needing a early diagnosis and has not been described to our knowledge after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Clinical Case Description: We describe here a 44 years woman with an aggressive nodular pleiomorphic T-cell lymphoma. She received several different chemotherapy regimen before having an allogenic bone marrow transplantation from unrelated compatible donor with a reduced intensity conditioning. The post-transplant period was complicated by an acute skin GVHD, then followed by an extensive chronic skin GVHD. An asymptomatic CMV replication was detected starting from D30 post-graft. She was treated repeatedly by valganciclovir. At the 7th month after allograft, the patient was hospitalised in emergency for the following clinical symtpoms: aggravation of skin GVHD, confusion with major impaired awareness but without any neurological focal signs. She was also complaining of headache since a few days. At admission, cerebral CT scan without iodine contrast showed no abnormality and the blood CMV PCR was negative. Initial therapy was especially acyclovir in the hypothesis of herpers simplex encephalitis. Initial attempt of lumbar puncture failed. After progressive impairment of neurological status (decrease of Glasgow Scale to 5) over 5 days, an MRI was performed and showed abnormal contrast enhancement of the ependymal lining around ventricles associated with frontal punctiform hypersignals of white matter. On the following day, the CSF analysis showed a highly positive CMV PCR and the blood CMV PCR became positive on day 7 after admission. Despite initial improvement after treatment by ganciclovir, the patient eventually died two months after onset of ventriculatis. Discussion: We describe here a rare localisation of central nervous system CMV disease. The clinical picture is often misleading, due to the paucity of specifi c clinical signs. The diagnosis should be systematically questioned in severely immunodeficient HSCT recipients with a past history of cytomegalovirus pelication presenting with headache, even with a normal CT scan. Furthermore this case highlights the possible discrepancy between CNS CMV disease and blood virus load. Early MRI appears to be the investigation of choice together with the CSF analysis for this affection. Early therapy against cytomegalovirus could lead to improvement or cure as in AIDS patients.",

Constantinescu, A. Moise, C. Nicolae, I. Lupescu, D. Coriu, D. Colita, C. Arion \"Carol Davila\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy (Bucharest, RO) Background: Viral central nervous system (CNS) infections have been less frequently reported in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and limited data are available on their characteristics. The main etiology of viral encephalitis is HHV-6 and with lower incidence HSV, CMV, VZV, EBV, JC virus or adenovirus. The CMV encephalitis is severe and frequently is responsible for death. The polyoma JC virus associated haemorrhagic cystitis is also a severe complication after allogeneic SCT. We report a rare association of these severe complications in a young children after allogeneic SCT. Aim: To asses the incidence and clinical manifestations of CNS viral infection in allogeneic transplant recipients in our center. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 10 children transplanted in our center between 2003-2010. All patients received sibling HLA-matched allogeneic transplants and they were monitorized for viral infections with weekly PCR screening for CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, JCV, BKV, HHV-6, adenovirus. Results: We analyzed the results of 10 patients, 5M/5F, median age 5 y, range 1 -15 y, transplanted din our center for ALL -2 cases, AML -4 cases, SAA-3 cases, beta thalassemia -1 case. All patients received HLA identical sibling transplants. The infectious status before transplantation showed: 10/10 CMV D+/R+, 9/10 EBV D+/R+, and 1/10 EBV D+/R-. The viral monitoring showed 4/10 CMV reactivation, 1/10 EBV reactivation with consequent evolution to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Three cases developed CMV disease: gastroenteritis-1 case, pneumonia -1case, hepatitis and encephalitis -1 case. 1/10 cases had a rare association of CMV encephalitis and hepatitis and JCV severe infection. Discussion: The differential diagnosis between viral encephalitis and leukoencephalopathy is clinically diffi cult, but the normal values of CSA level and MRI Introduction: Beta-herpesviruses, such as CMV and HHV6, are important pathogen in transplanted patients. Innate and adaptive immune response against these viruses involves the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Endosomal TLRs (TLR3, 7, 8 and 9) recognize viral nucleic acids and some surface TLRs may be involved in the detection of structural proteins. Clinical and experimental evidences indicate that CMV and HHV-6 can modulate the immune system and infl uence the immune reconstitution after SCT. However, the role of TLRs in this complex interplay remains unclear, especially in the setting of allogeneic SCT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs on lymphocytes and monocytes in relation to CMV and HHV6 reactivation in the early period after allogeneic SCT. Methods: CMV and HHV6 reactivation was monitored weekly by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of TLRs on lymphocytes and monocytes was analysed by fl ow cytometry as mean fl uorescence intensity at day +30 and in any case before CMV or HHV6 reactivation. Functional data were obtained by ELISA assay after TLRs activation. The cell supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and MCP-1. Relative induction of these cytokines was calculated in relation with unstimulated controls. Results: CMV reactivation within 2 months after transplantation was observed in 13 out of 33 patients. HHV-6 reactivation was detected in 1 patient. TLRs expression and function did not signifi cantly differ in controls and patients without CMV. Lymphocytes of patients with CMV reactivation showed an increased expression of TLR5 (4.1\u00b12.4 vs 2.0\u00b11.7 p=0,008). TLR8 expression was lower on monocytes with CMV reactivation (0.8\u00b10.9 vs 2.0\u00b11.7 p=0,03). MCP-1 relative induction post-stimulation of TLR1 and 8 was signifi cantly decreased in patients with CMV reactivation (p<0.04). Conclusion: Surface TLR2 and intracellular TLR3 and 9 are reported to recognize CMV by some authors. In our study, surface TLR5 and intracellular TLR8 seem to be involved in the interaction between CMV and the immune system of transplanted patients. In particular, TLR8 could play a protective role. MCP-1 production upon TLR1 and 8 activation negatively correlates with CMV reactivation. The defective immune system after SCT could explain these results, which could be confi rmed by the assessment of a larger number of patients and the analysis of other possible interfering factors.",

Raschetti, D. Caudullo, L. Rubert, M. Zecca, P. Comoli Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo (Pavia, IT) Human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) is known to reactivate after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and has been suggested to be associated with delayed engraftment, and increased mortality. At present, little data are available on specifi c immune reconstitution to HHV6, considering also that viral reactivation is a very early event after HSCT, and assessment of immune reconstitution in the immediate post-transplant period may be diffi cult to achieve. Aim of the present study was to prospectically analyze cellular immune reconstitution to HHV6 in pediatric recipients of allogeneic HSCT from a HLA-haploidentical family donor (haplo-HSCT) or from a matched unrelated donor (MUD-HSCT). We analyzed the frequency of HHV6-specifi c IFN-g secreting cells, assessed by ELISPOT assay, in 13 recipients of haplo-HSCT and 13 recipients of MD-HSCT. HHV6 DNAemia by RT-PCR was also evaluated. We observed that, when present, cellular immunity to HHV6 was a early event after HSCT. Indeed, the peak frequency of HHV6-specifi c, IFNg-producing cells was observed at 1-2 months after transplantation, in both recipients of haplo-HSCT and MUD-HSCT. In detail, the median frequency of HHV6-directed cytokine-producing cells was 5 spot forming units (SFU)/10e5 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (range: 0-213) in the haplo cohort, compared to 20 SFU/10e5 PBMC (range: 0-261) in the MUD-HSC group. There was no statistically signifi cant difference in the response to HHV6 in the 2 cohorts, indicating that pediatric recipients of haplo-HSCT are able to show an effi cient early response to the virus. The frequency of HHV6-directed lymphocytes was comparable to the response observed for adenovirus, with some patients showing responses in the same range as those to CMV. HHV6 reactivated in a low number of patients (4/13 haplo-HSCT and 1/13 MUD-HSCT), with a median viral DNAemia of 1050 copies/ml. The median frequency of HHV6-specifi c T-cells in the patients with reactivation was 1.5 SFU/10e5, compared to 6 SFU/10e5 (p=ns).",

Still, the actual incidence of HHV-6 infection in recipients of HSCT and the causative link between infection and clinical complications remain elusive. Methods: From January 2009 to November 2011, we retrospectively evaluated 44 consecutive adult patients (median age 50 years) who developed positivity to HHV-6 after allogeneic HSCT for high-risk hematological malignancies and are here described. Stem cell donor were family haploidentical (33), HLA identical sibling (5), unrelated volunteer (4), cord blood (2) . At the time of positivity all patients were receiving acyclovir except 4. Nineteen patients had clinical acute GvHD at time of HHV-6 positivity (grade III-IV in 13), and 36 were receiving 2-4 immunosuppressive drugs. A concomitant CMV positivity was detected in 12 patients, a severe neutropenia in 12. The viral load was determined by quantitative PCR in cell-free body fl uids. Results: Median time from allogeneic HSCT to HHV-6 reactivation was 35 days (range: 7-625). In 24 patients HHV-6 was detected in plasma, 19 had concomitant fever, 8 skin rash of new onset, 6 impaired liver function, and 5 developed cytopenia sub sequently to the infection. In 6 patients HHV-6 was detected in the bone marrow, while in 9 cases, all febrile, on bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In 16 patients, HHV-6 was detected in gastrointestinal biopsies: 11 with documented gut aGvHD, 12 with diarrhoea. HHV-6 was found in cerebrospinal fl uid in 5 cases (all within 30 days after HSCT), associated with high HHV-6 viral load; all these patients experienced clinical encephalitis with abnormal fi ndings on brain MRI. HHV-6 positivity led to antiviral treatment only when associated with clinical manifestations (n=25), and fi rst choice therapy was foscarnet: 13 (52%) completely solved the clinical event, whereas 10 (40%) died. Amongst the total 44 patients with documented HHV-6 positivity, 13 completely solved the clinical event, whereas 21 (48%) died.",

Halkes (1) After reduced intensity conditioning with fl udarabin, busulphan and Lymphoglobulin (horse-derived ATG, hATG) followed by alemtuzumab-based T cell depleted (TCD) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in our patient cohort CMV reactivations were frequently observed, but not EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). After the enforced replacement of hATG by Thymoglobulin (rabbitderived ATG, rATG) CMV complications remained similar but an unacceptable incidence of 26% of early EBV-PTLD was observed. In this study, we analyzed the cause of this immune escape of EBV infected B cells by measuring antibody levels and specifi city in relation to B and T cell recovery early after transplant. During conditioning 16 patients received rATG (total 8 or 14 mg/kg) for in vivo TCD. This cohort was compared to 16 patients conditioned with hATG for in vivo TCD (total 20 or 40 mg/kg). Total serum ATG levels after alloSCT as measured with species-specifi c ELISA at 3 and 6 weeks after alloSCT were similar for the hATG (43 and 15 ug/mL) and the rATG cohort (41 and 21 ug/mL). Next, Specifi c ex-vivo reactivity with human B and T cells of the circulating ATG was measured by a fl owcytometry based method. In serum from hATG treated patients, a high specifi c anti-B cell reactivity was detected, which was dominant over anti-T cell reactivity, resulting in expansion of memory T cells which include EBV specifi c T cells prior to B cell recovery. In contrast, serum of rATG treated patients contained only marginal anti-B cell reactivity, but dominant anti-T cell reactivity resulting in early B cell expansion in the absence of T cell recovery. Interestingly, when tested directly out of the vial both ATG products showed similar dominant functional T cell reactivity over B cell reactivity as demonstrated using cell lineage specifi c fl owcytometry and in vitro CDC assays.",

Preclinical in vitro testing of the reactivity patterns of both ATG products did not reveal these striking differences and is therefore not useful for predicting these in vivo effects. for VZV was also done in the blood and was found to be positive. Acyclovir treatment was returned again to IV. The patient also received immunoglobulins. Due to persistence positive blood VZV-PCR, treatment was changed to foscarnet. This turned the VZV-PCR negative. Nevertheless, while getting the chemotherapy of the conditioning he turned again positive in VZV-PCR and remained so along the whole period of transplant. On the skin all the lesions disappeared and no new lesions appeared. Results: The patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy with carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide and melphalan with stem cell rescue while demonstrating positive VZV-PCR in blood (meaning VZV viremia) and on foscarnet. No major toxicity was documented. Time to recovery of the absolute neutrophil count above 0.5X109/l and 1.0X109/l was day +12 and +13, respectively. Time interval to platelets >25 X10 9 /l was 33 days. He did not achieve platelets >50X10 9 /l until his discharge. Imaging study with ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of disease and the patient was discharged home on day +43. Conclusions: High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be considered for pediatric patients with life-threatening resistant lymphoma although having viremia with VZV if they don't have any other manifestations of multi-organ involvement and they stay all the way on continues anti-viral treatment and recurrent IVIG.",

Dzieciatkowski (1) Background: Infectious diseases are still one of the major problems after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Infrequent but emerging viral infections, such as Adenovirus (ADV) infections are often associated with a high mortality in immunocompromised patients (pts) and are diffi cult to treat with antiviral agents currently available. Objectives: In this analysis, we show the results of three adult pts treated at our transplantation unit with ADV-specifi c donor t-cell transfer (ADV T-cells) suffering from ADV viremia with disease symptoms or disseminated ADV infections. Patients and Methods: Pts treated at our transplantation unit between Jan 2007 and Nov 2011 were enrolled into this analysis. All pts were serologically screened for ADV antigens at the beginning of the treatment. In case of clinical symptoms, quantitative ADV PCR was performed in the symptom specifi c specimens and in blood samples. In uncontrolled ADV infections, or viremia, we transferred ADV T-cells in addition to the common antiviral agents. ADV-specifi c T-cells were monitored in two patients by interferon gamma elispot assay. Results: 515 pts were treated between Jan 2007 and Nov 2011. In 25 pts (4,8%) we detected ADV by serology or PCR in different specimens. Three pts showed clinical symptoms related to ADV, which could not be resolved with the common available antiviral agents. All three pts suffered from diarrhoea when ADV were fi rst detected in stool samples at day +91, day +3, and day +39 after HSCT, respectively. ADV T-cells were transferred at day +141, day +43, and day +61 after HSCT, respectively. No ADV was detected by PCR after ADV-T-cells in both pts with viremia. The application of ADV T-cells was tolerated well in all pts. There was no clinical association with the application of ADV T-cells and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). Two pts died due to severe GvHD and/or other infectious complications at day +179 and day +73 respectively (Table I) . In one patient a long-lasting immunological response more than two years after adoptive transfer could be observed. Conclusions: Adoptive ADV specifi c T-cell transfer is feasible in adult HSCT recipients suffering from severe ADV infections. We could demonstrate the clinical effi ciency with the clearance of ADV viremia by ADV T-cells and a long-lasting immuno logical response without any side effects in one patient.",

Though not fully unrevealed, immune response to viral activation seems to rely predominantly on T-cell expansion. Therefore cellular immunotherapy was successfully developed to allow adoptive transfer of virus-specifi c cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). We present the case of a 16 year-old boy developing ADV reactivation in blood as measured by Polymerase Chain Reaction during the preparatory regimen for haploidentical T-cell depleted SCT from father.

Methods: Eight patients developing HC of 34 patients undergoing HSCT between 2010-2011 at our center have been analyzed retrospectively. The familial and previous individual anamneses, underlying primary diseases, clinical, laboratory and microbiological data were recorded and reviewed for. Results : Median age of the children was 9.6 \u00b1 5.3 years. Primary diseases were acute lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, Glantzmann thrombasthenia and thalassaemia. The onset of HC was observed at the 24 \u00b1 7 posttransplantational day and bleeding was detected for 34 \u00b1 30 days along. Preceding, all patients received cyclophosphamide treatment in the conditioning period. One of the patients developed grade 3 and two of them grade 4 HC. Cidofovir treatment was initiated in 7 cases after detecting urinary bleeding. Five of the patients showed complete recovery. In one case the hemorrhagic cystitis was accompanied with fatal rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonitis in the engraftment period, while in two cases subsequent CMV infection were detected leading to graft rejection and fi nally uncontrollable fatal interstitial pneumonitis after temporary resolution of the HC. (n=2), multiple myeloma (n=20), lymphoproliferative disorder (n=8) and Fanconi anemia (n=1). Twenty-six underwent matched siblings HSCT (52%), and the remainder matched unrelateddonor HSCT (48%). Four pts received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (8%). SC sources were peripheral blood (n=27), bone marrow (n=19), and umbilical cord blood (n=4). BKV and JCV qPCR were performed in urine samples collected at admission for transplant and weekly until discharge. Results: Eight pts (16%) developed HC. BK viruria was demonstrated in 36 pts (72%) at day +7 as a median (range: -7 to +110); only one patient receiving a RIC regimen had urinary BKV excretion. Median BKV load was 6.8 log10 copies/mL in the group of pts who developed HC and 3.2 log10 copies/ mL in those who did not (p=0.036). Pts who had clinical HC showed higher viral load at fi rst detection (log10 4.17 vs 2.7 copies/mL; p=0.003) and at maximum viral load (log10 8.18 vs 3.2 copies/mL; p=0.013) than pts without HC. There was a signifi cant correlation between the fi rst and the maximum BKV load (R=0.445; p=0.009). The median duration of BKV excretion was 230 days in pts with HC and 77 days in pts without HC. JC viruria was seen in 26 pts (52%), being more frequent when peripheral blood was used as the SC source (p=0.01). Median time for fi rst JCV detection was day -1.5 (range: -11 to +347). Median duration of JCV excretion was 34 days in pts who developed HC and 24 days in pts who did not. A signifi cant correlation was found between BKV and JCV maximum loads (R=0.451; p=0.04). Conclusions: 1) JC and BK shedding in urine were frequent in our series of allo-HSCT recipients. 2) High JCV and, particularly BKV load correlated with the development of HC. 3) We suggest that high load of BK excretion should be considered a warning sign for the development of HC in allo-HSCT pts, and preemptive therapeutic interventions need to be further investigated.",

Mori, S. Kurosawa, T. Tanaka, K. Tada, Y. Kobayashi, N. Morikawa, A. Shinohara, K. Okinaka, T. Yamashita, Y. Heike, T. Fukuda National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: Norovirus-gastroenteritis (NV-GE) is considered as a highly transmittable disease that can lead to fatal outcomes in vulnerable populations. Therefore, prompt detection of norovirus in stool specimens is important for patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The commercially available immunochromatography kit (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) is a diagnostic tool that can easily and rapidly detect norovirus antigens with high specifi city and relatively less sensitivity compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here, we report an analysis of patients with NV-GE in our HSCT unit using the immunochromatography method. Patients and Methods: We prospectively examined stool specimens to detect norovirus antigens in patients who developed diarrhea in our HSCT unit between December 2008 and June 2011. We also retrospectively examined stool specimens which had been collected for Clostridium diffi cile (CD) toxin test and frozen at -40\u00b0C between January 2007 and November 2008. Results: Norovirus was detected by the immunochromatography method in 11 patients among the HSCT recipients, and in 1 patient who died before HSCT because of disease progression. The median age of the 12 patients was 56 years (range, 29-66). The median duration of symptoms was 30 days . Among the 11 patients who developed NV-GE after HSCT, primary disease included lymphoma (6 patients), acute leukemia (4 patients), and multiple myeloma (1 patient). One patient developed NV-GE after autologous HSCT, and 10 patients after allogeneic HSCT. Among the 10 allo-HSCT recipients, 5 patients received myeloablative conditioning and 5 received reduced-intensity conditioning before allo-HSCT. The median time from HSCT to the onset of symptoms was 36 days (4-93).",

No patients died of NV-GE, and 6 died of other causes (disease progression, 4; Graftversus-host disease, 1; multiple organ failure, 1). There was no outbreak of NV-GE. Conclusions: Our results suggested that this method is helpful in the differential diagnosis of patients with diarrhea after HSCT and enable us to take an appropriate and prompt preventive measure. In the future study, validation with RT-PCR and immunochromatography method is warranted among the immunecompromised populations. Recently, a newly discovered HRV, HRV type C (HRV-C), has been identifi ed in patients with severe LRTI. There is currently a lack of information on the incidence or pathogenicity of HRV-C in the pediatric HSCT population. We present a case of HRV-C LRTI in a pediatric patient with monosomy 7 juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). and without symptoms over the next 5 months, and during that period a broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) was positive for HRV, indicating LRT involvement. BAL also showed presence of Klebsiella and Enterobacter Asbuirae. In June 2011 he developed both Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6) viremia with pneumonia, and BAL was positive for both HRV and HHV6. HHV6 viremia resolved with cidofovir and foscarnet therapy, but respiratory HHV6 infection persisted. Determination of HRV type by conventional PCR with HRV-specifi c primers targeted at the 5' noncoding region identifi ed HRV-C serotype 025. In this setting of respiratory co-infection with HRV-C and HHV6 the patient relapsed and, in August 2011, underwent a second transplant with 5/6 DRB1 antigen mismatch cord blood and myeloablative Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide and Melphalan conditioning with maintenance foscarnet therapy as it was the only cure of his disease. Unfortunately disseminated HHV6 infection developed 1 month later and he succumbed to renal and respiratory failure and encephalitis 2 months post second transplant. Conclusion: This fi nding of LRT HRV-C infection in a pediatric HSCT patient with bacterial and HHV-6 co-infection demonstrates the need for increased awareness and understanding of potential respiratory complications of HRV-C infection, including the possibility of increased susceptibility to and persistence of co-infecting pathogens. Objectives: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains one of the most challenging obstacles to successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and limits the use of this important procedure. Therefore, defi ning variables that predispose to this event is of critical importance. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins on the surface of immune cells that detect \"microbe-associated molecular patterns\" from a variety of organisms. There is increasing evidence for a role for TLRs in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD (aGVHD). We hypothesized that gene polymorphisms in TLR pathway in donors or recipients may affect the risk of aGVHD. Methods: Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR8 and TLR9 genes were analyzed in 2 independent cohorts. The initial cohort consisted of 138 pairs of patients and their unrelated donors (URDs). The second cohort consisted of 102 pairs of patients and their HLA-identical sibling donors. Results: We found that two SNPs in donor side, TLR9-1174 G/A (rs352139) and TLR9 +1635 C/T (rs352140), infl uenced the risk of aGVHD. The association was particularly strong in the URD transplantation cohort. Multivariate analysis confi rmed that an unrelated donor with the TLR9-1174 mutant genotype (AA/AG) was an independent risk factor for development of aGVHD (P=0.055, RR=2.115). In contrast an unrelated donor with the TLR9 +1635 mutant genotype (TT) was protective (P=0.006, RR=3.556). Myeloablative conditioning (P=0.005, RR=3.601) and donor female and recipient male (P=0.04, RR=1.577) also signifi cantly contributed to the development of aGVHD. The same effect was observed in the sibling transplantation cohort, although the incidence of clinically signifi cant aGVHD in this cohort was low overall and the association was not statistically signifi cant. The incidence of aGVHD was not affected by polymorphisms of the TLR1, TLR2, TLR3 and TLR8 genes in either recipients or donors. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that in addition to HLA matching, polymorphisms in donor and recipient non-HLA genes affect transplantation success by regulating alloimmune responses. These results provide the fi rst report of an association between donor TLR9 gene polymorphic features with the risk of aGVHD, which are located within the promoter region and coding polymorphisms and may infl uence transcriptional regulation and the amino acid exchange of the TLR-9 gene.",

Saudemont Anthony Nolan (London, UK) Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment of haematological diseases. Cord blood (CB) is increasingly used as source of stem cells (SC), as it allows transplantation with a lower HLA match. Prophylaxis drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporine A (CsA), which are often used together after HSCT to prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD), have been studied for their immunosuppressive effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but so far little is known about their effects on CB mononuclear cells (CBMCs). Moreover, it has been shown that the administration of MMF after CB transplantation delays neutrophils engraftment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand better the effects of MMF and CsA on CB cells. Using a fl ow cytometry approach, the effects of MMF, CsA and the combination of both drugs, on cell death, T cell subsets and cell activation were studied on resting and activated CBMCs and PBMCs. PBMCs and CBMCs reacted differently to the addition of these drugs. MMF delayed, but did not abrogate T cell proliferation and activation. Moreover, the use of MMF did not increase the cell death of activated CB cells and preserved the regulatory T cell (Treg) population, which could be important to prevent GvHD. None of these effects were seen when using CsA. Furthermore, CsA seemed to inhibit CD4 and CD8 re-expression after activation. When using the two drugs together, the effects on proliferation, activation and CD4/CD8 populations persisted except for the preservation of the Treg population.",

After allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), patients living within one and a half hours' driving distance to the unit were given the option of treatment at home after HSCT. An experienced nurse visited the patient every morning and a phone-call from a physician was given in the afternoon. One-hundred and forty-six patients treated at home during the neutropenic phase were compared to matched hospital controls, coming from outside Stockholm. Because good oral nutrition was correlated to reduced acute GVHD, oral intake was intensifi ed in patients treated in the hospital from September 2006 (new controls). We compared four groups; old home-care (before September 2006, n=76), new home-care (from September 2006, n=70), old (n=76) and new controls (n=70). The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades II -IV was 15% in the old home-care group, which was signifi cantly lower as opposed to 32-44% in the new home-care group (p<0.001) and the two control groups (p<0.03).

Basheer, A. Tsoulkani, A. Santarsieri, J. Craig, C. Crawley, A. Sureda Addenbrookes Hospital (Cambridge, UK) Objectives: To analyse haematological recovery, duration of inpatient stay and incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) when deleting short course methotrexate (MTX) from a triple immunosuppression prophylaxis program including alemtuzumab in patients with haematological malignancies treated with a reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-allo). Patients and Methods: Thirty-seven consecutive patients allografted (either from a HLA identical sibling donor or from a matched unrelated donor) in a single institution over a 18 months period (January 2010-May 2011) were retrospectively analysed. The main indications for RIC-allo were acute myeloid leukaemias (21; 56.7%), lymphoma (7; 18.9%), myeloproliferative neoplasms (4; 10.8%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (4; 10.8%). Twenty-fi ve patients received the combination of Campath 1H + cyclosporine A (CsA) / tacrolimus (TAC) + short course MTX as GVHD prophyalxis after RIC-allo while twelve, the combination of Campath 1H + CsA / TAC at the same doses. Both groups were comparable in terms of sex, age at the time of RIC-allo, underlying disease and disease status at transplantation, type of donor and source of stem cells, risk factors and time interval between diagnosis and RIC-allo. Results: Campath-CsA/TAC group had a signifi cantly quicker haematological recovery after RIC-allo both in terms of neutrophils and platelets; 19 days vs 22.5 days and 13.6 days vs 25.5 days, respectively. In addition, the length of hospital admission was signifi cantly lower in the group that did not receive MTX (23.25 days vs 35.84 days). The addition of MTX in the GVHD prophylaxis program seemed to decrease the incidence of acute GVHD (30% vs 20%), with no differences in chronic GVHD. Finally, there seemed to be a greater proportion of patients alive as well as fewer relapses at 100 days in those allogeneic transplants that had only CAMPATH + CsA/Tac conditioning than those of the MTX group (92% alive, 0 relapses vs 84% alive, 16% relapses). Conclusions: These data suggest that whilst the incidence of acute GvHD may be slightly lower in the MTX group, there is also a clear prolongation of haematological recovery and inpatient stay in this group. This analysis suggests that the addition of MTX to a two drug Campath-based GvHD prophylaxis may not necessarily be as benefi cial as originally intended, as it appear to confer prolonged hospitalisation and potential morbidity.",

Introduction: In-vivo lymphocyte-depleting therapies as part of pre-transplant conditioning in peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBST) have been variably associated with reductions in acute (a) and chronic (c) graft versus host disease (GvHD), but at the potential risk of delayed immune reconstitution, increased viral reactivation rates and, in some series, increased disease relapse. Methods: From our prospective allogeneic transplant database, we identifi ed three sequential patients cohorts undergoing matched unrelated donor (MUD) PBSCT, who received GvHD prophylaxis with either Cyclosporin (C)+ short course Methotrexate (M), or C+M+ post-transplant (d+14 to d+84) Prednisolone (P), or C+M+ pre-transplant Thymoglobulin (total dose= 4.5 mg/kg)(T). Patients transplanted prior to 2000 were excluded to avoid confounding by historical patient and donor selection criteria. We compared the rates of aGVHD, cGvHD, disease relapse, CMV and EBV reactivation and overall survival (OS) of these three cohorts. aGVHD (up to day +100) and cGvHD (beyond day +100) were scored using Przepiorka 1995 and Wolff 2010 criteria respectively. CMV reactivation (all three cohorts) and EBV reactivation (CMT cohort only) were assessed by weekly PCR.",

Clinical studies exploiting the impact of natural killer (NK) cells during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have provided promising results in GVHD prevention. It is known that NK cells are a heterogeneous population that can be divided into functionally distinct NK cell subpopulations. Murine NK cells can be separated along their expression of CD117 (c-kit), CD27 and CD11b. The functional relevance of the distinct NK subsets in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) has not been investigated in detail so far. In the fi rst part of this study, we optimized the isolation of NK cell subsets and characterized the genomic, phenotypic and functional profi le of these different NK cell subsets. Microarray analysis provided important insights into the distinct genomic profi les of these subsets. Functional in vitro analysis clearly demonstrate that CD11b+ NK cells develop the highest tumorlytic capacity (60%) whereas CD27+ CD11b-only develop about 25% at an effector-target ratio of 5:1. Interestingly, CD27+ NK cells provided the highest IFN-gamma production upon incubation with tumor cells and/or IL-2. We further analyzed the phenotypical changes and functional capacities upon stimulation and expansion in cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-15. Next, we addressed the role of distinct cytokine activated NK cell subpopulations in adoptive cell therapy.",

Ullrich University Erlangen-Nuremberg (Erlangen, DE) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents often the only curative option for severe forms of malignant neoplasia. However, therapeutic success of HSCT is limited by the occurrence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) as a life-threatening adverse effect. Beside liver and skin manifestation, GVHD patients suffer frequently from a severe intestinal infl ammation. Actually, there exist only unspecifi c therapeutic regimens for the control of gastrointestinal GVHD. An improved understanding of the exact immunopathogenesis of intestinal GVHD is needed to develop innovative therapeutic strategies. In our study, GVHD colitis was characterized in a murine model of full allogeneic mismatch BMT following myeloablativ irradiation with an allogeneic T cell transfer. In vivo endoscopic imaging enabled us to monitore the course of GVHD colitis over time.",

            "text": "Around day 14 after BMT and T cell transfer, recipient mice started to develop fi rst clinical symptoms and endoscopic signs of GVHD colitis. Monitoring the intestinal infl ammation in the described experimental setting over time, endoscopic scores as well as histological analysis indicated a chronic course of GVHD colitis. Analysis by immunofl uorescence microscopy confi rmed that the observed GVHD colitis was based on a massive infi ltration of congenic CD45.1+ donor lymphocytes into the colonic lamina propria. The active participation of infi ltrating lymphocytes in the infl ammatory process was refl ected by a high expression of transcription factors like T-bet and Eomes and by a marked induction of pro-infl ammatory cytokines (IFNg, IL-6, IL-17) within the colonic tissue. At the same time, increased intestinal levels of activated caspase-3 could be detected by Western blot and implicated the presence of apoptotic cells within the infl amed colon. Interestingly, apoptotic cell death was not restricted to intestinal epithelial cells, but an increasing number of TUNEL positive immune cells could be detected within the lamina propria during the course of disease. The described GVHD model in combination with the technique of in vivo miniendoscopy represents an optimal and innovative experimental setting for the improved characterization of GVHD colitis. Exact analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms, which underlie immune cell activation and apoptosis within the lamina propria will help to identify gut specifi c targets for optimized therapy of GVHD colitis. Background: Acute graft-vs.-host disease (aGvHD) still remains one of the major obstacles to successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The ability to prevent aGvHD, i.e., the application of successful prophylaxis, is the cornerstone of success. Immunosupression with pharmacological agents such as cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tx) is more often use for aGvHD prophylaxis. 3-years OS after allo-HSCT in relapse with RIC was also higher in Tx group (41%) vs CsA (13%) (p=0,08). The incidence of infections was similar in two study groups and didn't depend on disease stage and conditioning regimens.",

The toxicity profi les of CsA and Tx were similar. But the differences were in the incidence of hypertension -higher in CsA group (38% vs. 24%, p=0,04), but neurological complications (headache, tremor, paresthesia) and nephrology complication were higher in Tx group (44% vs. 30%, p=0,02 and 21% vs 14%, p=0,05, respectively). Conclusion: Use of Tx is preferable in high risk of aGvHD group because it was superior for aGvHD prophylaxis and in relapse pts at allo-HSCT because of better OS. But Tx has more toxic complications such as neurological and nephrology disturbances whereas hypertension is more commonly seen with CsA. Reducing or preventing intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) without a wide systemic suppression would lead to preserve the benefi cial graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect of donor T cells resulting in signifi cantly improve overall survival in patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell plan-tation (HSCT). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the fi rst and rate-limiting step in tryptophan catabolism. Induction of IDO expression can effectively suppress the local infl ammatory response by depletion of tryptophan and/or accumulation of catabolites known as kynurenines. Recently, it has reported that IDO expression is induced in the colon after allogeneic HSCT and it caused local infl ammation decreases and reduces GVHD severity. These results indicate that modulation of IDO in GVHD target organs may represent an interesting strategy for limiting GVHD. However, the physiological mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. We found that IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism induced by donor T cell-derived IFN-gamma is transient and incomplete in colon of recipient mice after allo-HSCT, which infl uence little suppressive activity on GVHD severity and lethality. Administration of kynurenines (3-hydroxykynurnine+ 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid) during the IDO expression time period prevents GVHD lethality, which was caused by promoting effector donor T cell death in colon tissue. Our data suggest that strategies to sustain the IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism in GVHD target organs decrease GVHD severity without impairment of GVT effects.",

Methods: Our questionnaire covered items on indication, possible side effects, precautions, intake modalities, timing, and observance of treatment. It was focused on 6 main oral therapies: cyclosporine, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, penicillin, and posaconazole.

This up regulation could be reduced 2 folds through TGF-beta and IL10 supplement ( Figure 1 ). The 2 to 3 folds increased proliferation could be antagonized by adding TGF-beta. Osteogenic differentiation was induced by MLR supernatant treatment alone. When osteogenic differentiation supplements were added the Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity increased two folds (fi gure 2). In the three week co culture both the number of Colony Area Forming Cells (CAFC) counted and the number of Colony Forming Units (CFU) observed in the following CFU-Granulocytes, Erythrocytes, Monocytes, Macrophages assay (CFU-GEMM) was reduced. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a pro infl ammatory stimulus changes several basic MSC properties. MSCs lose their immunoprivileged status and acquire Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) functions. Regarding their tissue regenerative potential MSCs enhanced proliferation and osteogenic potential might lead to a tissue imbalance in the bone marrow niche. The reduced capacity of MSC to support HSPC could be one explanation for the fact that patients with aGvHD suffer from hematopoietic insuffi ciency and subsequently have a predisposition for infectious complications. Simulating an anti-infl ammatory response these changes could be partially reversed. This observation is in line with the cytokine storm concept which hypothesizes that the imbalance between pro and anti-infl ammatory factors is crucial for the maintenance of aGvHD.",

Casa\u00f1o, A. Rodr\u00edguez, P. G\u00f3mez, F. Mart\u00ednez, M. Alvarez, A. Torres Reina Sofi a Hospital (Cordoba, ES) Objectives: Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) is the main cause of morbi-mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Standar treatment for the fi rst line are steroids that can be effective in about a 50% of patients. Nonetheless another 50% of patients would need second or more lines of treatment for its control. Our goal is to analyse the results for the second or more lines of treatment in our institution. Patients and Methods: Between december 1980 and december 2010 we carried out 712 allo-HSCT (564 related; 147 unrelated). We analyse the results using 4 lines of treatment: corticoids \u2265 2 mg/kg/day, ATG, anti-CD25 and anti-TNF. Results: 423 patients (59%) received steroid treatment (\u2265 2 mg/ kg/day): 369 patients (87,2%) obtained a complete response, 26 patients didn\u00b4t respond (6,1%) to steroids and 27 patients died (6,4%) due to aGVHD associated with another causes (mainly infections). Out of 369 patients that obtained a complete remission after fi rst line of treatment, 139 (37,6%) showed an aGVHD reactivation and 20 patients among them (14,3%) didn\u00b4t respond to a second course of steroids. In sumary, 46 patients (10,6%) received a second line treatment due to corticoids-resistant aGVHD. Following the literature, this condition was defi ned as progression in 1 grade in three days, failure in obtaining 1 grade of improvement after 5-7 days or imcomplete response after 14 days of treatment with steroids to \u2265 2 mg/kg/day. As second line treatment, micophenolate mofetil was added to ciclosporine or tacrolimus (associated to steroids) in 7 patients, obtaining 4 complete responses (57%), 27 patients received ATG (6 complete responses; 23%) and 12 patients received anti-CD25 MnAb (7 complete responses; 58,3%).",

Jagasia (1) We report the preliminary results of the 10 fi rst patients included in a prospective multicentric study assessing extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) for second or third-line therapy in children with steroid refractory aGvHD. Methods: 3 ECP sessions a week during 2 weeks, then: 1/ patients in complete response (CR) receive 1 session a week until steroids are tapered to 0.5 mg/kg/d then stop; 2/patients in partial response (PR) receive 2 sessions during 2 weeks then tapering until steroids are tapered to 0.5 mg/kg/d then stop; 3/in case of absence of response (NR) then the patients are switched off the protocol. Final evaluation at week 10. Refractoriness to corticosteroids was defi ned as progression after at least 48 hours steroids at 2 mg/kg/d or stable disease or progression after 4 days steroids at 2 mg/kg/d or stable disease or progression after 2nd line therapy during at least 8 days. CR was defi ned by the resolution of all signs of aGvHD, PR by improvement of at least one IBMTR grade and NR by the absence of improvement. Results: 10 patients aged 3 to 17 yrs. The indications of transplantation were: acute leukaemia (n=5), 3 aplastic anemia (n=3), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=1) and solid tumor (n=1). The donor was a sibling HLA-identical donor (n=2), an unrelated HLA-identical donor (n=3), and a mismatch unrelated donor (n=5). The stem cell source was cord blood (n=4), bone marrow (n=3) and peripheral stem cell (n=3). Five patients had received a second-line therapy with anti-TNF biologics and/or anti-CD25. At the beginning of ECP, 3 of 10 pts suffered from aGvHD grade 1-2, 3 pts from grade 3 and 4 pts from grade 4. The median duration from onset of aGvHD until start of ECP was 34 days (range 8-212 days). The median number of sessions was 13 (range . ECP was well tolerated, no severe side-effect occurred. Two patients died before 2 weeks ECP, while nonresponders (grade IV Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an important treatment for steroid-refractory acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD and cGVHD). Within a retrospective analysis the results of treatment with ECP in aGVHD (n=35; grade 2: n=15, grade 3: n=16, grade 4: n=4) and cGVHD (n=39; moderate: n=16, severe: n=22, severe overlap-syndrome: n=1) were evaluated. 62 patients were treated with ECP employing the COBE\u00ae Spectra LRSTM System, and 12 patients obtained the procedures with the Therakos UVAR\u00ae XTSTM System. Results: No signifi cant difference in response rates and overall survival could be shown in patients treated either with COBE\u00ae or Therakos System. A complete remission (CR) and a partial remission (PR) was observed in 9 (25.7%) and 5 (14.3%) patients with aGVHD and in 5 (13.2%) and 11 (28.9%) patients with cGVHD without application of any new additional immunosuppressive therapy (IST) during ECP. In 9 additional patients with aGVHD a CR or PR was achieved with additional IST started during ECP interfering with evaluation of response. These patients were classifi ed as \"treatment failure\" (TF). Four additional patients with cGVHD classifi ed as TF achieved CR or PR with additional IST initiated during ECP. In aGVHD 22 (63%) patients and in cGVHD 21 (55%) patients could taper steroids \u2265 50%. In 9 (26%) patients with aGVHD a reduction of 1 immunosuppressive medication, in 7 (20%) a reduction of 2 medications and in 3 (9%) a reduction of 3 medications was achieved. In 11 (29%) patients with cGVHD a reduction of one immunosuppressive drug and in 4 (10.5%) a reduction of two immunosuppressive medications was possible. Treatment related mortality (TRM) was observed in 16 (46%) patients with aGVHD (causes of death: infection (n=7), progressive GVHD (n=8), other (n=1) and 12 (32%) patients with cGVHD (causes of death: infection (n=6), progressive GVHD (n=2), other (n=4). At last follow-up, 12 (34.3%) of patients with aGVHD and 23 (58.9%) of patients with cGVHD were alive. Patients with aGVHD achieving a CR or PR showed a signifi cant improved overall survival (OS) (median OS: 43 months, range: 5-118) than nonresponder (median OS: 25 months, range: 2.5-51) (p =.014). Conclusion: ECP is associated with signifi cant response rates and allows a successful reduction of steroids and IST in patients with steroid-dependent and -refractory aGVHD and cGVHD. Response to ECP is associated with a signifi cant improved overall survival in aGVHD. For anticoagulation in extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit, the manufacturer's recommendation is the use of heparin (normally 10.000 Units). However, patient with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation are at high risk for bleeding complication due to low platelet counts, intestinal lesions from aGvHD or impaired hepatic function. For these patients, alternative anticoagulation using acid citrate dextrose (ACD-A) has been infrequently used in small patient cohorts. We investigated the safety and effi cacy of this approach in 94 consecutive patients (43 male, 51 female) with aGvHD (45% with GvHD of the intestine) undergoing ECP with ACD-A anticoagulation at a single institution 2 to 3 times per week on a weekly basis until complete resolution of aGvHD. A total of 1242 ECP procedures were analyzed with respect to side effects and changes in haemoglobin and platelet levels. Moreover, in a proportion of ECP treatments activated partial thromboplastin time prothrombin time (aPTT) was monitored. Priming of the separator was performed with 1.000 Units of heparin followed by anticoagulation with ACD-A at a ratio of 1:10 during the procedure. ECP was tolerated well by all patients. In only 0.2 % of procedures mild citrate reactions seen as transient paresthesias were observed but resolved without the need for calcium substitution. In no case bleeding complications were noted during citrate anticoagulation. During ECP, aPTT levels increased marginally from a median of 32.1 seconds (sec; range, 25.3 to 44.5 sec) before to a median of 35.4 sec (range, 25.4 to 54.7 sec) after ECP, respectively. At start of ECP 51% of patients had platelet counts <100 G/l and 26% <50 G/l. Haemoglobin and platelet counts decreased by 11% and 14%, respectively.",

            "text": "In conclusion, citrate anticoagulation during ECP is a feasible and safe alternative for patients with high risk for bleeding complications, especially for those with aGvHD of the intestine and low platelet counts. The allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become a major therapeutic option for patients (pts) suffering in different hematologic diseases. Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), the leading cause of non-relapse mortality, has been observed in up to 80 % of matched unrelated (MUD) HSCT in spite of GVHD prophylaxis. This is a retrospective analysis of extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) treatment in aGVHD after mismatched: 13) in our department between 01.01. 2006 and 30.11.2011 . 17 out of 133 MUD-HSCT pts (female: 8, male: 9, median age: 42 years) were treated by ECP because of steroid refractory (5) or hyperacute (12) aGVHD. Transplant characteristics: diagnoses: acute/chronic leukemia: 12, lymphoproliferative disease: 5, conditioning: myeloablative: 14, reduced intensity: 3; stem cell source: bone marrow: 3, peripheral blood stem cells: 14; GVHD prophylaxis: different combinations of tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine A; T cell depletion: in vitro: 5, in vivo: 1. The median time of engraftment was day +13.. The median onset of aGVHD was day +12. Skin involvement (stage: II:4, III:11, IV:2) was detected in all cases, liver involvement in 7 (stage: I:1, II:1, III:3, IV:2) and gut in 6 pts (stage: I:1, II:4, III:1) with overall Glucksberg grade (gr) I-II in 10 and gr. III-IV in 7 pts. The maximal median dose of methylprednisolone before starting ECP was 5 mg/kgbw. The median day of starting ECP was day +26. The median number of ECPs was 19. The initial ECP frequency was 1 cycle/week. The ECP was very well tolerated without major side effects. 14 out of 17 skin aGVHD (CR:10, PR:4), 2 out of 7 liver aGVHD (PR only) and 1 out of 6 gut aGVHD (PR only) responded to ECP. 7 out of 17 pts are alive. The median time between onset of aGVHD and starting ECP was shorter in the surviving group (9 days vs 14 days). 7 out of 10 pts with overall gr. I-II responded to ECP, but all the 7 pts with overall gr. III-IV died. However, 6 pts of the latter group received anti-GVHD monoclonal antibody therapy prior to or concomitantly with ECP treatment, which could infl uence its effectiveness negatively. The median follow up is 142 days following transplants. In our series ECP seemed to be effective in aGVHD in Glucksberg gr. I-II pts. In more advanced GVHD ECP proved to be ineffective, at least together with monoclonal antibody therapy of GVHD. Delay in starting ECP worsened the outcome. Further studies are warranted. The mainstay of treatment is the use of steroids, but responses tend to be lower than 30%. Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) is a useful immunomodulatory therapy in treatment of steroid refractory GVHD. However, the underlaying mechanism is not yet understood and there is little information about lymphocyte subpopulations in infused products. Objective: To analyze the lymphocyte subpopulation infused in ECP and its clinical relevance. Patients and Methods: 4 patients with steroid refractory GVHD who underwent ECP are studied. A Cobe Spectra (Caridian-BCT\u00ae) device was used for lymphopheresis. 1-2 patient\u00b4s volemias and target hematocrit <5% per lymphoapheresis was processed. 3 ml of 8-methoxy-psoralene aqueous solution (8-MOP) was added to a fi nal concentration of drug of 200 ng/ml before the photo-inactivation. Each cycle (C) of ECP was conducted on 2 consecutive days/week and then every 15 days according to clinical response. Studies of lymphocyte subpopulations (T, B, NK) of the infused products were analyzed with multiparametric 4 colour fl ow cytometry (FC-500\u00ae Coulter). Baseline characteristic of the patients are presented in Table 1 .",

In patients with CR or PR of steroid-refractory aGVHD Kaplan-Meier probability of overall survival at 1.5-years was 78% compared to 0% in patients without response (p=0.0018), ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion. ECP in steroid-refractory aGVHD may be used in combined IST with maximal effect in skin involvement. It demonstrated steroid-sparing effect in aGVHD patients. Our series also showed feasibility of ECP in aGVHD after haploidentical HSCT. Background: Diagnosis and onset prediction of Graft-versushost disease (GvHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) as well as therapy monitoring remains a challenging issue. Aim: To evaluate the role of positron emission tomography (PET) using the positron-emitting radionuclide 18F labeled with Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) for the assessment of GvHD after AlloSCT. Methods: We retrospectively studied all patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma who underwent AlloSCT between 2004 and 2009. We included all 36 patients in whom a PET scan before transplant was performed for staging purposes and who had at least three follow up PET scans after transplantation. Overall 8 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 20 Hodgkin lymphoma, 8 multiple myeloma were reviewed. PET scans were blindly reviewed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Scans performed at the time of GvHD were compared with scans obtained before transplant and during clinical remission of GvHD, as well as with scans performed in patients without GvHD. Pathological FDG uptake in GvHD target organs was recorded. Results: Overall 25/36 patients developed GvHD (22 acute, 9 chronic) while 11 remained GvHD-free during the time of follow up. In 11/25 patients one or more PET scans were performed during the period of active clinical GvHD. In 7/11 cases pathological FDG uptake was detected in the gut (n=6), the liver (n=1) and the mouth (n=1). Six out of 11 patients had GvHD related diarrhea at the time of PET analysis. In these six cases there was intense FDG uptake in the bowel in comparison to the scans obtained in the same patients at GvHD-free periods. In 2 patients, PET analysis showed pathological FDG uptake days before the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms. A strong decrease in bowel FDG uptake was observed in 5/6 patients responding to therapy. PET positivity was present in one of 3 cases with pathologically confi rmed liver GvHD, and in one of 5 patients with oral GvHD. Among the 11 patients who did not develop GvHD, 2 patients showed a faint FDG uptake in the gut, that was also present in pre-transplant scans. Overall considering sites of documented GvHD, PET was positive in all patients with gut GvHD (n=6), in 1/3 with liver GvHD, in 1/5 with oral GvHD, and false positive in 2 patients without GvHD. Conclusion: Our preliminary data show that together with clinical fi ndings, FDG PET could be useful in diagnosing and monitoring GvHD, especially at bowel level. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is diagnosed clinically but histopathological confi rmation is frequently warranted due to its unspecifi c nature of symptoms. We performed a survey on current practice for diagnosis and treatment of acute GVHD. The survey was returned by 31 (43%) of 72 centers contacted in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Three paediatric centers answered as requested only the histologic part of the survey. Results: In the presence of diarrhoea and decreased oral intake after engraftment only 3 centers (10%) do not perform endoscopy prior to immunosuppressive treatment, 13 centers perform colonoscopy, 8 colonoscopy and gastroscopy, 3 sigmoidoscopy and gastroscopy, 2 gastroscopy alone and 2 sigmoidoscopy alone. In the presence of a skin rash with the differential diagnosis of GVHD versus drug reaction 11 centers (35%) perform a skin biopsy upfront, 14 apply topical steroids with discontinuation of the suspected drug and perform a skin biopsy only if this strategy fails and 3 centers perform a skin biopsy only after failure of systemic steroids. Three centers do not perform a skin biopsy. In the presence of rapidly increasing cholestasis occurring without any other signs of GVHD 10 centers (32%) perform a liver biopsy upfront and 12 only after failure of steroid treatment while 9 centers do not perform a liver biopsy. Nineteen centers (61%) use a percutaneous, 11 a transvenous approach and one a mini-laparoscopy for liver biopsies.",

In contrast, tryptophan levels did not signifi cantly differ between patients with and without acute GvHD. This may be explained by the tryptophan-containing parenteral nutrition applied in the majority of patients irrespective if they experienced acute GvHD or not. In summary, signifi cantly higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine were detected in patients with acute GvHD so that kynurenine may be considered as a further biomarker for the detection of this complication.",

            "text": "A. Xhaard (1) Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg), a population with potent immunosuppressive properties, may offer a new way to prevent or treat aGVHD. Treg therapy has demonstrated high effi cacy in mouse models; however, translation to human has been hampered by the identifi cation of different subsets of human Treg. Based on the expression of CD45RA and HLA-DR, we identifi ed 3 different subsets of human FOXP3+ Treg in healthy subjects' peripheral blood and in cord blood. All 3 subsets were suppressive in vitro. Gene expression profi ling combined with global pathway analysis revealed clearly distinct immune signatures for each subset, which were validated by analysis at the single-cell level. Single-cell gene profi ling also uncovered a striking heterogeneity of gene expression within these Treg subpopulations and revealed that cytokine-expressing Treg did not downregulate FOXP3 and other Treg markers. We prospectively studied Treg subsets in 18 consecutive alloHSCT recipients' peripheral blood. Analysis was performed before steroid initiation in patients with aGVHD (n=7) and at hematopoietic recovery in the control group (n=11). First sample was analyzed a median of 20 days after alloHSCT (range: 11 to 36) with no difference between the 2 groups. Percentages of FOXP3+ cells in CD4+ cells were not signifi cantly different in aGVHD patients and in the control group (10.4 and 12.6%, p=0.53). However, we observed in the aGVHD group a strong alteration of Treg subsets compared to the control group, with a pronounced bias towards an activated phenotype. RA-DR+ cells were signifi cantly more represented among FOXP3+ T cells in aGVHD patients than in the control group (80.8 versus 53%, p=0.003). Conversely, RA-DR-and RA+DR-cells were more frequent in the control group than in patients with aGVHD (26.8 versus 10.6% and 13.5 versus 2.1%, p=0.014 and p=0.0012, respectively). Our data suggest that frequencies of specifi c Treg subpopulations, rather than the frequency of the total pool of CD4+FOXP3+ Treg, is altered in aGVHD and may serve as a biomarker for this condition. CD4+ lymphocytes under the infl uence of local environment differentiate into populations able to generate IFNgamma (Th1), IL-17 (Th17) and those exerting regulatory role FoxP3+CD4+. All these populations were described as main players in aGvHD. Therefore, the understanding of the interplay between the main subsets of CD4 positive cells may better understanding pathomechanism of aGvHD. We studied 80 pts (median age: 43 yrs), 13 pts manifested aGvHD at the time of hematological recovery and in 15 pts aGvHD was clinically apparent from 17 to 93 days post transplantation (median 31). All patients were bled at the fi rst day of hematological recovery and then in one week intervals as well as on the fi rst day of clinical manifestation of aGvHD. PBMC were stimulated with brefeldin-A, Ionomycin and PMA and then with BD Golgi Stop The cells were labeled for CD4 positivity (BD, CA) and the intracellular presence of IL-17A, FoxP3 (e-biosciences, CA) and IFNgamma (BD). It was found that: (i) Percentages of Th17 lymphocytes (CD4+IL-17+) were signifi cantly lower at the day of aGvHD manifestation as compared to those lacking aGvHD at the similar time post transplant (0.059%\u00b10.01 vs 0.094%\u00b10.009, p=0.007, M-W U-Test). It was also seen when percentage contribution of IL-17+ cells to CD4+ lymphocytes were analyzed (median values: 0.44% vs 0.21% vs 0.19% for lacking aGvHD, having cutaneous and gut aGvHD, respectively).",

Results: Acute GVHD of the intestine did not occur in the patients with a genotype of -403AA, -28GG, or In1.1CC (p=0.087, p=0.14, and p=0.17, respectively). After adjusted by the known GVHD-associated factors such as age, gender, stem cell source, transplantation method, and the stratifi ed risk category of the disease, A GCT haplotype in a recessive model showed a signifi cant harmful effect on the occurrence of acute GVHD of skin and liver (Hazard ratio [HR] = 3.49 and 3.22, 95% CI: 1.20-10.16 and 1.11-9.33, p=0.022 and 0.031, respectively).

Furthermore, the CCL5 polymorphisms of the donor were not signifi cantly associated with the risk of any subtype of acute GVHD. Conclusion: This study suggests that CCL5 polymorphisms of the recipient of allo-HSCT, rather than the donor, might be preferentially associated with the occurrence of acute GVHD of intestine and skin. Our result supports the hypothesis that CCL5 expression in the cells of the specifi c tissue, including tissue antigen presenting cells of the recipient rather than that in T-cell of the donor, plays an important role in the development of the acute GVHD. -3, 0, +3 as prophylactic regimen.

However, nitrite oxygen (NO) and infi ltration of macrophages in the colonic epithelium was signifi cantly lower. Furthermore, in the liver stainings, we observed an increase of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is considered to have immunosuppressive properties. Conclusion: Administration of iODN2088 alleviates intestinal GvHD and results in improvement of infl ammatory markers. However, it has no obvious effect on T-cells. The T-cell independent effect of this substance leads potentially to a synergy of this substance with T-cell inhibitors. This synergy is to be further investigated.",

A total of 216 patients and their respective donors of HSC were enrolled. 73 patients had either grades 0-I or grades II-IV acute GVHD and 60 patients developed chronic GVHD.The commonest HLA-A alleles were HLA-A2, A3, A9, and A24.

Chiusolo (1) Recently the application of proteomic tools, allowing screening for differentially expressed or excreted proteins in body fl uids, could allow detecting specifi c biomarkers and whole saliva is highly attractive for the non-invasive specimen collection. In this aim we collected salivary specimens of 40 patients (pts) submitted to alloHSCT between December 2008 to March 2011 in our Institution. They were: 17M/23F, median age 46 years (range 16-65). Underlying diseases were: 20 AML, 6 ALL, 3 MM, 1 LLC, 5 LNH, 2 LH, 2 MDS and 1 IMF. Graft was obtained from sibling donor and MUD in 28 and 12 pts respectively. GvHD prophylaxis was performed with CSA-MTX in 20 pts, CSA-MMF in 14 pts; CSA and Campath in 3 pts, CSA in 1 pt and 2 pts received no GVHD prophylaxis. Samples of whole saliva were mixed immediately in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with aqueous 0.2% trifl uoroacetic acid solution and centrifuged at 8,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. The obtained solutions were analyzed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ElectroSpray-Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS). Twenty-three out of 40 pts (57%) developed aGVHD, involving oral mucosa. The chromatograms of the acidic soluble fraction of salivary proteins of pts with aGVHD were compared to the asymptomatic ones. Different expressions of S100A8 (calgranulin A, M average 10834 Da; elution time 37.0 min) and S100A7 (psoriasin; E27->D variant, M average 11368 Da; elution time 40.4 min) were observed: 14 pts out of 23 with GVHD showed the presence of S100A8, while the protein was detectable in two pts without GVHD (p 0.001). S100A7 was absent in pts without GVHD and detectable in 11 pts out 23 with GVHD (p 0.0001). S100A8, together with S100A9 (calgranulin B), is part of an etero-dimeric leukocyte-derived protein called calprotectin, which is over-expressed in oral mucosal infl ammation. S100A7 is highly expressed in keratinocytes derived from psoriatic skin and it is chemotactic for CD4+ T cells. We found a statistically signifi cant association between the presence of these proteins and the development of aGVHD, but further studies should clarify if these proteins could be considered either a marker of GVHD or an index of mucosal infl ammation. Objectives: Acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGvHD)is the major cause of non-relapse mortality of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The diagnosis of aGvHD is based on clinical criteria and the biopsy of involved organs. Currently, few validated biomarkers are well established for the diagnosis of aGvHD.

In univariate analysis the use of ciclosporine plus MTX short course (OR 0,1; p=0,034) and HLA-identical sibling as donor (OR 0, 2; p=0, 02) were associated with lesser mortality due to aGVHD. Donor/ receptor female/male, ciclosporine plus MTX short course and donor non-HLA-identical sibling were statistically associated with more incidence of aGVHD grade III-IV. Conclusions: Our results show that receptor age >45y, neoplasic underlying disease, use of radiotherapy in the conditioning regimen and donor non-HLA-identical sibling are factors that predispose to more incidence of aGVHD. Nonetheless, only donor HLA-identical sibling, sex of donor/receptor different of the combination female/male and the use of ciclosporine plus MTX short course are associated statistically with lesser mortality due to aGVHD. Background: Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD) which is an infl ammatory disease still remains a serious complication of allogeneic (allo-) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). MicroRNA (miR)-146a has been associated with disease activity in many infl ammatory diseases and is involved in both innate and adaptive immune systems. Validated targets of miR-146a include IRAK1 and TRAF6, which are known to promote expression of interferon genes via the NF-kB pathway. MiR-146a has been shown to inhibit IRAK1 and TRAF6 as well as reduce the expression of specifi c cytokines (IL-2, -6 and -8) in aGvHD. The aims of this research were to investigate: (1) the relationship between miR-146a expression and the pathogenesis of GvHD, (2) the mRNA expression of known miR-146a targets; TRAF6 and IRAK1 in GvHD. Methods: MiR-146a expression was assessed by qRT-PCR in skin biopsies obtained from in vitro skin explant assay (SEA) and HSCT patients. Skin biopsies in medium alone were used as the control for SEA samples. Similarly, skin biopsies from healthy volunteers were used as the control for clinical skin samples. MiR-146a expression was also analysed in whole",

In whole blood, miR-146a (p=0.0008) and TRAF6 (p=0.006) expression was signifi cantly down-regulated in II-IV aGvHD patients in comparison to 0-I aGvHD patients (Figure 1 and 2). However, no signifi cant difference in miR-146a or TRAF6 expression was observed in whole blood with regards to chronic GvHD (cGvHD). IRAK1 expression did not signifi cantly vary in either the aGvHD or the cGvHD cohort. Conclusion: Low expression of miR-146a at 28 days post-transplant in whole blood obtained from II-IV aGvHD patients could be an early indicator of aGvHD severity. Results may suggest that miR-146a has a protective role as higher expression levels are observed in whole blood of 0-I aGvHD patients. Further investigations are required to examine protein levels of known miR-146a targets (TRAF6 and IRAK1), as well as the mRNA expression levels of additional potential miR-146a targets. Introduction: Pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in the cross-talk between innate and adaptive immune system. TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as common protein, carbohydrate or DNA/RNA pattern motifs. TLRs are also receptors for endogenous ligands and damaged tissue. Extracellular ligands are recognized by surface TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6). Intracellular TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9) bind mainly to foreign nucleic acids and sometimes detect self DNA/RNA.",

            "text": "Aim of the study: Very little is known about expression and function of TLRs in vivo in patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs on lymphocytes and monocytes in relation to the onset of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Methods: The expression of TLRs on lymphocytes and monocytes was analysed by fl ow cytometry as mean fl uorescence intensity at day +30 and at the onset of GVHD. Functional data were obtained by ELISA assay after TLRs activation. The cell supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF-alpha, IFNgamma and MCP-1. Relative induction of these cytokines was calculated in relation with unstimulated controls. Results: We analyzed 17 healthy donors and 34 patients. Acute GVHD developed in 19 patients (12 with grade \u22652). Clinical and transplant characteristics did not differ in patients with and without GVHD. Lymphocytes and monocytes of patients with acute GVHD showed higher levels of TLR5 (3,5\u00b12,3 vs. 1,9\u00b11,6 p=0,03; 25,8\u00b125,9 vs. 9,0\u00b15,0 p=0,02) and a decreased expression of TLR1 (2,5\u00b12,8 vs. 4,3\u00b12,8 p=0,02; 21,4\u00b121,9 vs. 54,9\u00b137,4 p=0,005) and TLR9 (63, 8\u00b130, 4 vs. 111, 1\u00b162, 9 p=0, 03; 85, 3\u00b173, 9 vs. 164, 2\u00b190, 6 p=0, 01) . IFN-gamma relative induction post-stimulation of TLR2,3,4 and 9 was signifi cantly decreased in patients with acute GVHD (p<0,04). Conclusions: These results suggest that the innate immune response via TLRs activation could be involved in the development of GVHD. In particular, a decreased expression of TLR-9 (receptor of hypomethylated DNA) on lymphocytes and monocytes can promote TLR-7 activation, inducing type I interferons and other pro-infl ammatory cytokines. TLR-1 and -5, which are ligands for bacterial cell wall, could also be involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Moreover, acute GVHD negatively correlates with IFN-gamma production upon TLR2,3,4 and 9 activation. S170 gut and symptoms are nonspecifi c. Early recognition is important to start therapy promptly. The current standard for diagnosis is endoscopy of the upper and lower GIT, with histology of biopsies. The clinical and haematological status of the patient may make obtaining endoscopy and biopsy diffi cult and histological features are quite nonspecifi c. Involvement can be patchy and affected areas may be missed occasionally on endoscopy. As 18F-fl uorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) detects mucosal infl ammation, we describe its utility as a non-invasive test for gut GvHD and its correlation with histology. Methods: Ten patients with clinical suspicion of acute gut GvHD between March 2009 to Oct 2011 underwent FDG-PET scanning and endoscopic biopsies of the upper and lower GI tract within 7 days of each other. All were evaluated for other causes for their symptoms before proceeding to PET scan and endoscopy. The fi nal diagnosis of GvHD was made based on clinical symptoms, histology and response to subsequent therapy.",

            "text": "Results: Ten patients (median age 10 years) had PET scan and endoscopic biopsies for suspected GvHD. One patient was evaluated twice. The clinical data is shown in Table 1 and 2. Out of the total of 11 evaluations, 9 were suggestive of GvHD on histology and PET: 9 showed increased uptake in the GIT suggestive of GvHD. Two patients negative on histology as well as PET were labelled as no gut GvHD and recovered with supportive treatment alone. One of these patients had later new symptoms and was then positive on histology and PET. There was 100% concordance between the histology of the biopsy specimens and the PET scan in diagnosing GvHD of GIT, although in 2 patients the biopsy and PET positivity were at different sections of the GI tract. All the patients with positive histology and PET scan showed complete resolution of the symptoms after GvHD treatment. Conclusion: FDG-PET demonstrates signifi cant potential as a non-invasive technique for evaluation of suspected acute GvHD of the GIT. Moreover PET can guide the endoscopists to target biopsies from the more affected areas. FDG-PET as a sole modality in addition to clinical symptoms for diagnosing acute gut GvHD needs further evaluation as the FDG uptake in patients with intestinal infl ammation due to other causes (like CMV enteritis) may look same. [1, 2] . This study examined the kinetic changes of CLA+ and CCR10+ T cells and their association with GVHD after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods: Flow cytometry analysis was performed on 95 PBMC samples from 20 patients. Results: The levels of CLA+CD4 T cells were signifi cantly higher for patients with aGVHD than those without at 100 days post transplant followed by a decline to pre-transplant level at 6 & 12 months. A second peak was apparent in aGVHD patients at 9 months although not signifi cant. Similar kinetic patterns were observed for CLA+CD8 T cells but to a lesser extent ( Figure 1a ). Patients with de novo chronic GVHD showed a sharp increase in CLA+CD4 T cells at day 28, which remained signifi cantly high during the 12-month period. The levels of CLA+CD8 T cells remained comparable for patients with or without cGVHD at all time points (Figure 1b ). There was a trend showing increased levels of CCR10+CD4 and CD8 T cells for patients with aGVHD at day 28 or 3 months as well as raised CCR10+CD4 T cells for patients with cGVHD at most time points, yet no statistical signifi cance was attained. To assess CLA expression and T cell activation we compared the kinetic patterns of CLA+ and CD25+ T cells. There was a trend showing higher levels of CD25+CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients with aGVHD than those without. However the levels of CD25+CD4 and CD8 T cells never exceeded the pre-transplant level. In addition the levels of CD25+CD4 T cells remained high even after the resolution of aGVHD ( Figure 2a ). Patients with cGVHD had signifi cantly higher levels of CD25+CD4 T cells compared to those without while the levels of CD25+CD8 T cells were comparable regardless of cGVHD status (Figure 2b ). Interestingly a sharp decline of CD25+T cells was observed in all patients at day 28 except those with aGVHD, maybe indicating a lack of response to cyclosporine A. Conclusions: Our data suggest that increased frequency of CLA+CD4 T cells in PBMC maybe an informative indicator for acute and chronic GVHD. CLA+T cells do not follow the same kinetic patterns as CD25+T cells post transplant, suggesting they may have diverse functional roles in GVHD. The association of CCR10+T cells and GVHD is inconclusive in this small cohort of patients. Purpose: Acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD) is a major cause of mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Current promising attempts to predict outcome of aGvHD include gene-expression profi ling. However, for rapid clinical decision-making additional, easy-to-use clinical parameters may be helpful. As thrombocytopenia and hypalbuminemia predict outcome in chronic and aGvHD, we analysed the combined infl uence of these factors on outcome. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 42 patients with hematological malignancies who underwent SCT in our centre and were diagnosed with aGvHD. Albumin (Alb) and thrombocyte count (TC) at time of initiation of aGvHD treatment were categorised: Alb low (<28 g/l) vs. high (\u226528 g/l) and TC low (<100 Gpt/l) vs. high (\u2265100 Gpt/l). For preliminary analysis overall survival (OS) served as the primary endpoint. Median follow up time was 24 months (interquartile range; IQR 20).",

Validation of the score in larger patient cohorts is needed and may help to develop trials for risk dependent treatment strategies of aGvHD. Previous studies established an important role of Th1 cells in aGVHD pathophysiology after allo-SCT. The role of proinfl ammatory Th17 cells in aGVHD has been demonstrated in mouse models. However, their contribution in human gastrointestinal (GI) aGVHD remains unclear. The same, the role of PDC (the professional type I IFN-secreting cells), which play an important role in triggering Th17-related cytokines is not established in aGVHD. This report investigated the role of Th17 cells and PDC in GI biopsies taken from patients with or without aGVHD. The cohort included 21 patients who underwent allo-SCT for different hematological malignancies (n=19) and severe aplastic anemia (n=2), with a median age of 53 (range, 16-69) y. The stem cell source was PBSCs in 19 cases, CB in 2 cases and BM in 1 case. 10 patients received transplant from a MRD, and 11 patients from a MUD. A RIC regimen was used in the majority of cases (n=19). Immunohistochemistry was performed on deparaffi nized tissues sections. A quantitative evaluation of antigens expression was performed by counting the number of positive cells in the biopsy. In this cohort, based on standard pathology criteria, 16 patients had a histologically proven GI aGVHD, biopsies were taken before initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy. The remaining 5 patients did not have histological or clinical signs of aGVHD and were used as controls. In order to identify the Th17 cell, biopsies were tested for expression of the CD161 and CCR6 markers, and RORgammaT, the key transcription factor for the differentiation of Th17 cells. Signifi cantly higher numbers of RORgammaT+ and CD161+ cells were counted in the intestinal mucosa of patients with aGVHD (p=0.016 and p=0.009 for RORgammaT and CD161 expression respectively). Given the role of PDCs in triggering Th17-related cytokines, we determine the proportion of PDCs in the GI biopsies. This analysis showed a signifi cant increase of CD123+ PDCs in patients with aGVHD (p=0.017).",

Although the exact mechanism that links type I IFN production to PDC-mediated Th17 responses is still unclear in aGVHD, these data raise the prospect of future innovative approaches to optimize immunosuppression regimens for the treatment of aGVHD by targeting PDCs and the Th17 response. AlloBMT can be burdened by life-threatening complications, being GVHD the major cause of morbility and mortality. Clinical and physio-pathological evidences have shown that vascular endothelium could be a target of GVHD in very early phase; therefore markers of endothelial damage are warranted as valuable support in GVHD diagnosis. Several soluble factors have been tested as endothelial injury biomarkers, but any proved suffi cient specifi city and reliability to enter clinical practice. We conducted a study with primary endpoint to identify and count CEC in peripheral blood of patients undergoing alloBMT as a function of endothelial damage. The CellSearch System\u00ae was used to capture and enumerate CEC. Magnetic particles conjugated to anti-CD-146 are used to capture CEC from 4.0 ml of blood. Enriched cells are stained with DAPI and anti-CD-105-PE antibody. APC conjugated anti-CD-45 is used to exclude leukocytes. Enriched and stained cells are dispensed into a MagNest\u00ae cartridge for magnetic mounting. The cartridge is scanned and individual images of cells are presented for review and scored as CEC, based on CD146+, CD105+, DAPI+ and CD45-phenotype and cell morphology. Patients undergoing alloBMT were tested before, after the conditioning regimen and at weekly intervals till day +100 from alloBMT. Ten healthy subjects have served as controls.",

Rodriguez-Otero (1) Diagnosis of GI-GVHD is based on clinical symptoms and histological fi ndings. Fecal CAL, AAT and elastase are noninvasive biomarkers used in the screening of intestinal infl ammation, protein-losing enteropathy and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, respectively. They have not been yet validated in the context of HSCT and we aim to evaluate them as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of GI-GVHD. From 09/08 to 12/10, 72 patients (pts) were evaluated: 51 with GI-GVHD, 9 with GI infection and 12 without GI symptoms. At fi rst symptoms fecal samples were collected to measure CAL, AAT and elastase concentrations. Prognostic value of markers was evaluated by their association with complete response (CR) and steroid-refractory (SR) GVHD using a multiple logistic regression. Cumulative incidence (CI) functions were compared using Gray's test and adjustment was performed using the Fine and Gray method. CAL and ATT concentrations were higher in pts with GI symptoms than in controls. The concentration of elastase in pts with GI-GVHD was decreased but associated with high levels of CAL and alpha1-AT attesting from mucosal damage possibly not related to a pancreatic dysfunction. Pts with stage 1 GI-GVHD had similar concentrations of CAL and AAT than controls. Initial concentrations of CAL \u2265100 \u03bcg/g and AAT > 1.5 mg/g decrease the probability of CR after treatment (56% vs. 86%, p=0.005; 67% vs. 90%, p=0.00007, respectively). Similarly, high level of CAL and AAT predict a 93% and a 72% probability of SR-GVHD (p<0.0001). CAL and AAT concentration were independently and exclusively associated with a lower probability of CR (HR: 0.47). The model selection procedure also identifi ed a mode with both variables together with stage > 2 GI-GVHD as best predicting SR-GVHD, although marginal testing did not yield a signifi cant odds ratio (OR) for AAT (CAL: OR 17. Our results showed that fecal CAL and AAT levels are biomarkers of GI-GVHD, particularly in GI stage > I. Furthermore, an increase level of those markers predicts the response to treatment. Their use as predictors from severe GI-GVHD are very promising including in patients in whom GI-GVHD stage or histology are not available.",

Kawakita (1) Introduction: Although incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) differ depending on donor stem cell source, impact of AGVHD upon disease relapse and survival has not been analyzed enough in cord blood transplantation (CBT) with single graft setting. In this study, we have investigated the effects of AGVHD on outcomes of CBT. The mechanisms of leukemia relapse in HLA-mismatched HSCT recipients remain largely uninvestigated. A case of leukemia escape from an HLA-specifi c cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in a recipient of HLA one locus-mismatched BMT is presented. A 24-year-old man with primary refractory T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma received BMT from his HLA-B*51:01-mismatched mother. The patient developed acute GVHD on day 46 (maximum grade: III on day 53), which was incurable and transitioned to chronic GVHD. The patient relapsed on day 261 and died on day 279. Flow cytometric analysis for HLA-A, B, and DR showed that only the expression of B51 was down-regulated in post-transplant leukemia blasts compared with that in pre-transplant blasts. Ten CTL clones were isolated from the patient's blood when acute GVHD developed. The nucleotide sequences of the uniquely rearranged TCR Vbeta gene of each clone indicated that 10 clones had been derived from six independent clones. All six independent clones lysed B51-positive recipient EB virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (B-LCL) and B*51:01 cDNA-transfected donor B-LCL, but failed to lyse B51-negative donor B-LCL (Cr release assay). COS cells transfected with B*51:01 cDNA alone clearly stimulated IFN-gamma production by six CTL clones. These data indicate that all clones recognized the B*51:01 molecule as an alloantigen and suggest that the CTL response toward the B*51:01 molecule accounted for a majority of the recipient's CTL alloresponse during acute GVHD. The pre-transplant leukemia blasts were lysed by CTL clones, whereas the posttransplant leukemia blasts were not lysed by any CTL clones. The IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay revealed that B*51:01-reactive T lymphocytes in patient blood on day 232, one month before clinical leukemia relapse, were detected at a level nearly equal to the level of recipient B-LCL-reactive T lymphocytes, that is, the total alloreactive T lymphocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that CTLs specifi c for the HLA-B*51:01 molecule were generated in the patient blood during acute GVHD, and these CTLs continued to produce immunological pressure on leukemia blasts for at least eight months after transplantation, but B*51:01-down-regulated leukemia blasts escaped from the pressure of B*51:01-specifi c CTLs, and the leukemia clinically relapsed. These fi ndings can explain, at least in part, the mechanism of how leukemia relapse occurs during persistent GVHD after HLA-mismatched HSCT. Background: High dose glucocorticoids (prednisone at 1-2 mg/kg) have been considered the standard initial treatment for acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). Major drawbacks of systemic steroid therapy are acute and delayed complications, in particular, the increased risk of infections. Systemic PUVA has been shown to be effective as a secondary treatment in cutaneous GVHD. To our knowledge no studies have performed where methoxalen was applied topically (bath and cream PUVA). Objective: To evaluate the effi cacy of bath and cream PUVA therapy initiated either to control cutaneous aGVHD in pts resistant to standard steroid therapy or to accelerate steroid reduction. Methods: Charts of pts who underwent PUVA therapy during 2010 and 2011 were evaluated. The effi cacy was defi ned from either a reduction of the steroid dose and/or a clinical improvement of the cutaneous GvHD (complete response (CR), partial response (PR): reduction of at least 1 stage). Results: 19 pts (2 stage I, 6 stage II, 9 stage III, 2 stage IV) underwent PUVA therapy (13 pts (68%) bath PUVA, 6 pts (42%) cream PUVA). One pt was excluded from the evaluation. The mean number of treatments was 19,6 (25,8 for bath and 15,0 for cream PUVA). The mean cumulative UVA dosage was 56,7 J/cm 2 (bath PUVA) and 41,2 J/cm 2 (cream PUVA) respectively. 62% of the patients showed a CR and 38% a PR. In 73% of the cases a reduction of the steroids was enabled. The mean steroid reduction was 64%. Conclusion: Bath and cream PUVA was effective, well-tolerated and may be an alternative in pts with cutaneous aGvHD in whom systemic PUVA is not appropriate. In acute myeloid leukemia, the most primitive population of leukemic stem and progenitor cells (LSC) are thought to account for relapses of the disease. Deacetylase inhibitors (DACi) induce growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, premature senescence and apoptosis of malignant cells and may therefore be used as a maintenance therapy. Aim of our study was to analyse the impact of various DACi on 1) the proliferation and self-renewal capacity of LSC and 2) DACimediated gene regulation. Methods: Murine Sca1+/lin-hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were retrovirally infected with AML1/ETO exon9 and PLZF/ RAR-alpha, both known to induce an acute leukemia in C57BL/6N mice, and assesed by serial replating and day 12 spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assays. For gene expression studies, AML1/ETO exon9-and PLZF/RAR-alpha-transduced 32D cells were analysed by Western blot after treatment with valproic acid (VPA, 150 \u03bcg/ml), dacinostat (2.5-20 nM) or vorinostat (1 or 2 \u03bcM).",

Prolonged treatment with dacinostat, vorinostat or VPA resulted in a progressive loss of colony forming cells after the second plating suggesting exhaustion of leukemic progenitors. Western blot analysis of AML1-ETO-and PLZF-RAR-alpha-transduced 32D cells showed a concentration-dependent downregulation of Bmi-1 and c-myc after 48 hours of incubation with dacinostat, vorinostat and VPA which may have contributed to vanishing of leukemic progenitors. The repopulation capacity of AML1/ETO-or PLZF/RAR-alpha-positive Sca1+/lin-HSC was analysed by injecting all the progeny grown within a 7-day culture period in presence of cytokines\u00b1 DACi. Dacinostat-and vorinostat-treated cells gave rise to a signifi cantly lower number of spleen colonies compared to VPA-treated cells or control cultures. Engraftment of LSC in the spleen was determined by qPCR showing a deleterious effect of dacinostat, as we failed to detect an AML1/ETO-or PLZF/RAR-alpha signal. Vorinostat gave confl icting results with reduction of AML1/ETO-and complete deletion of PLZF/RARalpha-positive cells, resp., whereas VPA had no or just a minor inhibiting effect. Conclusion: We here demonstrate effi cious inhibition of proliferation, self-renewal and engraftment of AML1/ETO and PLZF/ RAR-alpha-positive stem and progenitor cells by dacinostat and vorinostat.

The bone marrow (BM) is a reservoir for metastatic breast cancer cells that can enter into a quiescent state and remain latent for decades after dissemination. By still unknown mechanisms, dormant tumor cells can reacquire proliferative ability, causing osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions. We have investigated how breast cancer cells affect the BM stroma when they home to an endosteal niche and how the BM microenvironment can infl uence properties of tumor cells. We have taken advantage of the human adenocarcinoma derived cell line, MDA-MB231 subclone SCP1833, which has a high propensity for bone metastases following intracardiac injection. Bioluminescence imaging followed tumor cell dissemination and cell sorting isolated different cell populations from the BM environment. Excluding cells of the hematopoietic and erythroid lineages (CD45+TR119+) from the analysis, we sorted endothelial cells (CD31+), osteoblasts (Sca1-CD31-CD51+) and mesenchymal progenitors (CD31-Sca-1+CD51+) from tumorbearing and naive mice and compared BM stromal populations by a genome wide-transcriptome study. Microarray analysis revealed that the BM is strongly affected by breast cancer cell dissemination. Several components of key molecular pathways involved in tumor development (including TGFBR, PDGFRB, EGFR, HGFR and IGFR signaling pathways) are modulated in the BM of mice with tumor cells. PIK3CA, a downstream effecter of several of the above-mentioned pathways, is up-regulated in the BM stroma of tumor-bearing mice. We are following up this analysis by testing the effects of the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ-235 in a model of breast cancer bone metastases. We want to elucidate how BEZ-235 infl uences survival and proliferation of tumor cells and how the BM responds to PI3K pathway inhibition.",

We investigated the outcome of patients underwent to allogenic BM transplantion on the basis of the MSC characteristics isolated from BM samples used for the transplantation. Materials and Methods: We isolated MSCs from directly plated BM samples and cultivated for 3-4 passages in an MSC medium containing 10% foetal calf serum. We analysed MSCs for: i) the number of fi broblast colony forming units (CFU-F); ii) growth rates at the fi rst passage (defi ned as the ratio: detached/ plated cell numbers) and the cumulative population doubling, iii) immunophenotype (CD45, 34, 14, 90, 73, 105, 146) . We then stratifi ed these results according to their median values and analyzed the number of TNC/kg, CD 34+ cells %, CD34+ cells/kg, LTC-IC/kg, CFU-GM/Kg, BFU-E/kg, the PMN and PLT engraftment, and the presence of GvHD. The t test and Chi square test were performed as statistical analyses. Results: We isolated MSCs from 39 donors with a median of age of 27 years (18 pts >18 years and 8 <18 years). The P1 rate (a ratio between the cells detached at the fi rst passage and those plated at the moment of harvesting) could represent an index of the number of MSC progenitors in BM grafts. We stratifi ed data on the basis of the median P1 rate (0.124) and observed an inverse correlation of the number of detached cells at the fi rst passage with the number of TNC/Kg (P<0.05) and the number of CD34+ cells, the LTC-IC, CFU-GM and BFU-E. PMN engraftment was faster in the samples with a P1 rate >0.124. Except for the CD146 expression no other differences were observed at the immunophenotype analysis. Although no signifi cant data were shown in GvHD occurrence, it is important to note that patients treated with the samples containing MSC with a high expression of CD146 at P1 did not develop chronic GvHD. We also observed that the samples with more CFU-F/kg (>140 CFU-F/kg) were also the samples with more TNC/Kg (P <0.05) and the number of CD34+ cells /kg but the CFU-F analysis was only carried out on a few samples. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the MSC content in the BM might be predictive of a faster PMN engraftment . These data need larger studies to confi rm the importance of MSCs content within the BM grafts to on outcome after BM transplantation.",

            "text": "Background: Increasing interest is currently set in clinical applications of human mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton's jelly (UCMSC) because of potential off-the-shelf availability at cord blood banks. Foetal bovine serum (FBS) is routinely used for the expansion and differentiation of MSC; however such addictives represent a potential hazard in clinical applications, due to the risk of transmitting viral/prion disease and/or inducing xenogenic immune reactions in the recipient. Therefore we compared the effi cacy of two recently marketed serum-free media with a \"classical\" medium (alpha-MEM containing 20% FBS). Materials and Methods: MSCs were isolated from 12 human umbilical cords. Wharton's jelly was separated from the cord vessels and placed in three different 6-wells dishes containing: StemPro MSC SFM medium\u00ae (medium A) (GIBCO, Invitrogen), StemPro MSC SFM XenoFree medium\u00ae (medium B)-(GIBCO, Invitrogen), or alpha-MEM containing 20% FBS (medium C). Fresh medium was added twice a week up to 90% confl uence. MSC were then harvested and re-plated at 8,000 cells/cm 2 for fi ve passages Doubling Time (DT) values were calculated according to established formulas. Osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiations were performed according to standard protocols and confi rmed by cytochemistry. Results: MSCs isolated in the three media were morphologically similar and showed the same differentiation potential. No signifi cantly differences were observed between DT in all media after the primoculture (P0); however classical alfaMEM medium allows signifi cantly better expansion than A (passages P1-P3) and B (P2-P3) media (Table 1) . It may be noted that Medium B has a generally lower DT than medium A, though the difference does not reach statistical signifi cance. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that serum-free expansion can be achieved for UCMSC, although at a lesser extent than using FCS-supplemented media. Medium A and B can be used interchangeably for ex vivo UCMSC expansion process.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) possess immunomodulatory properties and also participate in tissue repair. Defects in MSC function are reported in cells derived from lupus mice and lupus patients. A key question in the use of MSC in autoimmune diseases is whether MSC from lupus donors are defective and thus not suitable for autologous transplantation. Methods: MRL/lpr mice were treated with intravenous injection of 1\u00d710 6 C57BL/6J (B6) MSC (n=8), MRL/lpr MSC (n=8), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (n=10) at 17 to 20 weeks of age at during active disease. All mice were sacrifi ced at 8 weeks after treatment and bone marrow and kidneys were harvested. Serum anti-dsDNA antibody and proteinuria were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bone marrow plasma cells were characterized by fl ow cytometry as identifi ed by surface CD138 and intracellular IgG expression. Kidney pathological slides were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and scored in a blinded fashion. The average intensity of glomerular immune complex deposition in fi ve independent fi elds of one kidney section per animal was quantitated. Results: MSC transplanted from B6 donors, but not MRL/lpr donors, signifi cantly enhanced mice survival compared to PBS injected animals (p=0.03) ( Figure A) . B6-derived MSC signifi cantly decreased 24 hour proteinuria at 8 weeks after treatment compared to control, but MRL/lpr-derived MSC did not ( Figure B . p<0.05). Neither source of MSC impacted serum anti-dsDNA antibody levels. B6-derived MSC-treated animals, but not MRL/lpr-derived MSC treated animals, had signifi cantly fewer plasma cells in bone marrow and reduced glomerular IgG deposits compared to control (p<0.05). MSC administration did not signifi cantly impact the overall renal pathology scores, though there was a trend towards lower scores in the B6 group versus the other two. Conclusion: B6-derived MSC signifi cantly improved MRL/lpr survival when given at peak disease activity. B6-derived MSC transplantation led to less proteinuria, decreased bone marrow plasma cells, and reduced glomerular IgG deposits. These results indicate MSC transplantation at time of peak disease does impact disease and suggest that allogeneic sources of MSC may be preferred to autologous sources.",

However, very little is known about the specifi city of immunosuppression by MSC and the effect on cell-mediated immunity to pathogens causing post-transplant opportunistic infections. We report the immunological monitoring of a patient, receiving multiple doses of MSCs to treat post-transplant steroid-refractory GvHD, who presented Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation the day after the fi rst MSC infusion. Method: To analyzed the patient's response to MSC infusions we studied two GvHD plasmatic markers, by ELISA assays, before MSC infusion and at day 7, 14 and 28 after cell therapy. Moreover, trying to understand the in vivo effect of MSCs on CMV-specifi c cell-mediated immunity, we evaluated the plasma concentration of IFN-gamma (ELISA assay) and the frequency of CMV-specifi c IFN-gamma secreting cells (ELISPOT assay) circulating in the peripheral blood (PB) of the patient before and after CMV infection. Results: The patient, who presented at the moment of MSC infusion overlap cGvHD grade III, with skin and gut involvement, partially responded to the therapy, as clinically evaluated by the temporary GvHD reduction of one grade in the overall GvHD scoring at day 7/14 after MSC infusions. In accordance with clinical observations, we observed a signifi cant decrease of two validated GvHD plasma markers TNFRI and IL2Ralpha (Paczesny S et al. Blood 2009) after MSC administration. In particular, we observed a 3.6 fold decrease of the TNFRI and a 2.9 fold decrease of the IL2Ralpha plasma concentrations at day 14 after MSC infusion, compared to the pre-MSC levels. Importantly, along with the appearance of high numbers of CMV DNA copies in the peripheral blood the day after the fi rst MSC infusion, the patient showed an increase of IFN-gamma in the PB. Moreover, the frequency of CMV-specifi c mononuclear cells producing IFN-gamma following in vitro stimulation with a pool of CMV-derived, pp65 pp150 and IE1-specifi c peptides, increased 18 times compared to the pre-MSC values. Conclusions: In summary, the monitoring of the patient suggests that MSCs, upon infusion, are able to exert an immunosuppressive effect on alloreactive GvHD-promoting cells without impairing the correct mounting of an anti-viral immune response.",

We have previously demonstrated that transplantation of human MSCs can signifi cantly improve the autoimmune conditions in MRL/lpr mice. The current study aimed to determine the mechanisms by which murine BM-MSC transplantation (MSCT) ameliorates nephritis in MRL/lpr mice. Methods: 18-week-old MRL/lpr mice were treated with BM-MSCs derived from BAL b/c or saline. Mice were monitored for 24h proteinuria. Sera were tested for anti-dsDNA antibodies, BAFF levels, and levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-beta. After sacrifi ced at 26 weeks, kidneys were subjected to histologic examination. The percentage and number of marginal zone (MZ), T1 and T2 B cells in spleen were detected by fl ow cytometry. Results: In this study, we found that MSCT can signifi cantly prolong the survival of MRL/lpr mice. Eight weeks after transplantation, MSCT treated mice showed signifi cantly smaller spleens than control animals, with fewer MZ, T1, T2, activated B cells and plasma cells. Moreover, serum levels of BAFF and IL-10 in MSCT-treated mice decreased signifi cantly compared to those in the control group, while levels of serum TGF-beta were increased. Notably, decreased BAFF expression in both spleen and kidney was accompanied by decreased production of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and proteinuria in MSCT-treated mice. Conclusion: Our fi ndings suggest that MSCT may suppress the excessive activation of B cells via inhibiting BAFF production in MRL/lpr mice.",

This study was undertaken to determine the effect of oxidation status on F-actin cytoskeleton and RhoA signaling pathway in BMMSCs from SLE patients. Methods: The F-actin cytoskeleton was observed by fl uorescence microscopy after staining with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin. Transwell system was performed to determine the migration ratio of MSCs. RT-PCR and western blot were carried out to detect changes of RhoA signaling pathway. Serum level of SOD-1 was examined by ELISA and ROS level of MSCs was tested by fl ow cytometry. In order to investigate the effect of oxidation status on F-actin cytoskeleton of MSCs, 20 \u03bcM H2O2 was added into the growth medium of normal MSCs 1h before testing and 0.2 mM NAC, an antioxidant, was added into the growth medium of SLE MSCs. Results: F-actin cytoskeleton of MSCs was rearranged in SLE patients. The percentage of abnormal MSCs was signifi cantly higher in SLE patients than that of normal controls and increased as they were passaged. The migration capacity was also impaired as passaged. Both of the mRNA level and protein expressions of RhoA, which participates in a main regulatory signaling pathway of F-actin cytoskeleton and cell migration, were downregulated in SLE MSCs. Reduced serum SOD-1 level and higher intracellular ROS level suggested high oxidation status in SLE patients. H2O2, as an exogenous oxidant, induced upregulation of ROS level in normal MSCs. As a result, the F-actin cytoskeleton was rearranged and subsequently reduced migration ratio. While NAC, which downregulated ROS level, reversed the rearrangement of F-actin cytoskeleton and the impairment of migration capacity of SLE MSCs. RhoA expression was downregulated by H2O2 while upregulated by NAC. Conclusion: These experimental fi ndings suggest that the rearrangement of F-actin cytoskeleton of MSCs in SLE patients leads to the impairment of their migration capacity, which may result from the high oxidation status via downregulation of RhoA.",

However, the osteoblastogenesis in SLE patients is unclear. We investigated the bone morphogeneic protein (BMP)2 induced osteoblastic capacity of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) from SLE patients and the TNF signaling system in determining BMP-2 induced the regulatory pathways. Methods: BMMSCs were differentiated into osteoblasts in vitro stimulated by BMP-2 and the osteogenic capacity was quantitated. cDNA microarray was performed between BMMSCs from four SLE patients and four healthy controls, and differentially expressed genes in BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathway were analyzed. The activation of BMP/Smad and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in SLE-BMMSCs were evaluated by detecting the phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (p Smad1/5/8) and I-kappaB. TNFalpha awas added and its effect on the activation of pSmad1/5/8 and BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of normal BMM-SCs was determined, while PDTC, a NF-kappaB inhibitor, was used to examine its effect on that of SLE-BMMSCs. Finally, BMP-2 level in the serum from SLE patients were detected by ELISA. Results: The capacity of osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs from SLE patients reduced as compared with that from healthy controls. The NF-kappaB signaling was active, while the BMP/ Smad pathway was repressed in the BMMSCs from SLE patients. TNF-alpha activated NF-kB pathway and inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation in normal BMMSCs, while addition of PDTC to SLE-BMMSCs could partially restore them. The BMP-2 level was lower in the serum of SLE patients. Conclusions: Our fi ndings suggest that the activated NF-kappaB pathway in SLE-BMMSCs inhibits the BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation through BMP/Smad signaling pathway. The inadequate osteoblastic differentiation may participate in the pathology of osteoporosis in SLE patients.",

MSCs can be used for the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and hepatic regeneration in cases of cirrhosis. Aim: The aim of the study was to present data on the use of human MSCs in clinical practice. Methods: MSCs were taken from bone marrow (BM) and placenta (PLA) and expanded for 30-50 days in vitro. All samples were subjected to bacteriological and viral control. The MSCs' immunophenotypes were typical for cells of mesenchymal origin. Biological safety was evaluated by karyotyping in passages 4-5 and 9-10. The derived MSCs were presented in the native or frozen form. After protocol approval by the ethics committee, 30 child patients (4 with ALL, 4 AML, 1 biphenotypic acute leukemia, 4 Fanconi's anemia, 3 aplastic anemia, 1 adrenoleukodystrophy, 1 Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 1 SCID, 3 lymphohistiocytosis, 2 CML, 5 MDS and 1 osteopetrosis) and 10 adult patients (4 with chronic HBV-infection related cirrhosis and 6 with primary biliary cirrhosis) participated in the study. Results: The indications for co-transplantation of MSCs from BM (99 doses) are: transplantation of HSC (in order to improve HSC engraftment and prevent GvHD) -14, chronic GvHD -2, acute GvHD -10, and hypofunction of HSC transplants -4 cases. In all cases allogeneic MSCs from BM were used, including 5 cases from relative donors (parent/sibling). The MSCs doses were 2; 1; 0.8 and 5.6 million per kg in 92; 5; 1 and 2 cases respectively. 9; 9; 4; 3; 1; 1; 2 and 1 patients received 1; 2; 3; 4; 6; 8; 11 and 12 doses of MSC transplants respectively. In all adult patients allogeneic MSCs from PLA (20 doses) were used for hepatic regeneration and hepatocyte differentiation. The PLA MSCs dose was 2.0 million per kg. All patients received 2 doses MSCs. Acute reactions during and after the PLA and BM MSC infusions were not observed. Conclusions: Thus, the presented data refl ects the possibility of the clinical application of allogeneic human MSCs from BM and PLA, harvested under strict quality and safety control.",

Our group has gained large experience with the application of treatment protocols involving the use of autologous hMSCs in neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Aim: To investigate whether MSCs obtained from MS patients are functionally equivalent to those of healthy individuals and to determine the effect of iron particles (Feridex\u00a9) on the functional properties of MSCs isolated from MS patients. Methods: The neurotrophic effects, neural-differentiation potential and the immunological features of hMSC obtained from MS patients, were evaluated and compared to those of healthy donors. We used FACS analysis, co-culture of patients' MSCs with allogeneic lymphocytes and examination of culture supernatants for cytokine and chemokine production by cytometric beads assay. In addition, the effect of iron particles on the functional properties of the MSCs isolated from MS patients were evaluated using the above mentioned methods. Results: MSCs obtained either from MS patients (MS-MSC) or healthy donors (HD-MSC) were equally able to differentiate into mesodermal cells, adipocytes and osteoblasts and to induce neural differentiation of PC12 cells, indicating that MSCs from MS patients preserve their neurotrophic properties. Both MS-MSC and HD-MSC secreted equal quantities of BDNF and NGF and could be similarly differentiated into neural-like and glial-like cells, upon induction with neurptrophic factors. MS-MSCs had the same suppressive effect on lymphocyte proliferation (85-90% inhibition using 3H-Thymidine incorporation). Both MS-MSC and HD-MSC strongly inhibited the secretion of IFNg ,TNFa, CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL9 (>80%), by lymphocytes. An enhanced IL-10 and a trend toward increased IL-17 production was detected in lymphocytes co-cultured with HDand MS-MSCs. Labeling hMSC with the iron particles did not result in any major effects or compromise of their functional properties.

Raffel, L. Petrillo-Deluca, J. Bednarik, N. Fortier, E. O'Rouke, L. Shanahan, B. Barton, W. Walsh, A. Evens, R. Nath Umass Memorial Medical Center (Worcester, US) Introduction: SCT is a potentially curative procedure for a number of hematological malignancies. However, there remains limited data in the safety and outcomes with SCT for patients over age 75 years. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis for patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies aged \u226575 years that underwent SCT at UMass Memorial Medical Center since 2009. Results: We identifi ed 9 consecutive patients \u226575 years who underwent 10 SCT procedures. There were 7 males and 2 females. Diagnosis was multiple myeloma (n=4), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=3) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=2). Median age at original diagnosis was 74 years (range, 65-80), while median age at SCT was 77 years (range, 75-80). 8 SCTs were autologous (auto) and 2 were from allogeneic matched unrelated donors (MUD). Median number of chemotherapy cycles prior to SCT was 2 range (1-9) and median time from diagnosis to transplant was 19 months (range, 3.5-122). The 2 MUD SCTs were performed for AML with poor prognostic cytogenetics. One patient had received two prior auto-SCTs. Disease status prior to SCT was complete remission (CR) in 3, persistent disease in 6 and unknown in 1 patient. Mobilization chemotherapy for auto-SCT was cyclophosphamide in 6; etoposide/cytarabine in one and growth factor alone in one patient. Median number of CD34 cells infused was 5.0x10e6/kg range (2.8x10e6-6x10e6). Preparative regimen for auto-SCT were BEAM in 1, buslfan(Bu)/thiotepa in 1, and high dose melphalan (>140 mg/m 2 in 5) in 6 patients. The regimen for MUD-SCT was fl udarabine/Bu (3.2 mgx2 or 3)/rabbit ATG. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis (gvhd) was tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus/MMF. Median number of days hospitalized during SCT was 18.5 days (range, 12-28). Median time for neutrophil engraftment was 10.5 days (range, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and for platelet engraftment was 19 days (range, 14-49). All patients survived 100 days post SCT. Two patients have died at 6 and 9.6 months post SCT due to progressive disease. The two patients who underwent MUD SCT are disease free and without GVHD on minimal immunosuppression 8 and 10 months post SCT. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate shows the probability of survival at 6 months to be 89% and 67% at 1 year (see Figure) . Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the fi rst analysis to evaluate the feasibility and outcome of SCT for patients over age of 75 years. SCT appears to be safe and effective in selected patients in this age group. Introduction: Following the AHCST, engraftment occurs approximatelly between days 7-21.Two important complication of late engrafment are bleeding and infections. Patient and Methods: A total 50 patients who underwent AHCST between July 2010-November 2010 were investigated retrospectively. In all patient who underwent AHCST with fullmatch donors the relation between engraftment development and diagnosis, recipient age, donor age, recipient gender, donor gender, blood group compatibility, amount of CD34+ given, conditioning regimen were investigated. Results: The diagnosis of patient were 36 acute leukemia (AL) (72%), 5 aplastic anemia (AA) (%10), 3 myelofi brosis (MF) (%6), 3 non Hodgkin lyphoma (NHL) (%6), 3 (%6) other diseases (Hodgkin lyphoma (HL), sickle cell anemia (CCA) and myelodysplastic sydrome (MDS)). 21 of patients were female (%42) and 29 patients were male (%58). 30 (%60) of patients were given without total body irradiation (TBI) conditionig regimen,",

We validated a back-up model of HPC cryopreservation procedure that can be used in case of failure of controlled rate freezing due to adverse event (eg. rupture or damage of liquid nitrogen freezer, loss of electric power\u2026), when a second nitrogen freezer is not avalable as a back-up. Method: We selected 4 cord blood units non suitable for clinical use (TNC, total nuclear cells <1200x10e6). Each cord blood unit was divided in 25 vials of 1 mL and tested for TNC, CD34+ cells, viability (7-AAD) and CFU-GM/BFU-E: 5 vials (x4=20) was analized without cryopreservation and 20 (x4=80) vials was cryopreserved using 10% DMSO (ALCHIMIA srl) in nitrogen vapour freezer NICOOL PLUS (AirLiquide). We simulated four different adverse event occurring during cryopreservation, due to interruption of controlled rate freezing at different temperatures: -13\u00b0C, -25\u00b0C, -65\u00b0C, -85\u00b0C (5 vials each conditions, each cord blood). After interruption of controlled rate freezing, vials was immediatelly trasferred in mechanical freezer -80\u00b0C in a polystyrene box containing cotton wool, simulating a cryopreservation backup procedure. 24 hours later vials was transferred in vapour fase nitrogen storage tank, simulating a standard long term storage. In order to analized the biological and functional effect on HPC due to adverse event occurring during cryopreservation, each vial was thawed and tested for TNC, CD34+ cells, viability (7-AAD) and CFU-GM/BFU-E.

The advantages of UCB transplantation are: prompt availability of CB, absence of donor risk, tolerance of 1-2 antigen HLA mismatch and reduced incidence of severe acute GVHD (aGVHD). The major limiting factor is the low number of hematopoietic stem cells in a CB unit. Methods: Eight patients (2 male and 6 female) were submitted to intra-bone UCB transplant. Median age was 43 years (range 26-64) and median body weight was 62 kg (range 40-90). The median number of nucleated cells infused was 2 x 10 7 /kg (range 1.2 x 10 7 -3.55 x 10 7 /kg) and the median number of CD34+ cells was 0.805 x 10 5 /kg (range 0.43 x 10 5 -1.1 x 10 5 /kg). The main characteristics are reported in Table 1 . Results: At the last follow up four patients were alive: three patients were in complete remission (CR). Primary graft failure occurred in one acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient. Two patients died during aplastic phase for Gram negative sepsis (n=1) and Gram positive sepsis associate with multiple organ failure syndrome (n=1). One patient with refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) died on day +150 for progression disease. Refractory AML relapsed on day +180 and died on day +240. The median time of neutrophil (>500/mm 3 ) and platelet (>20.000/mm 3 ) recovery was 29 and 38 days respectively. On day +90 mixed chimerism was present in three patients and complete donor chimerism in two patients. Last evaluation showed mixed chimerism in two patients (respectively on day +90 and on day +540) and complete donor chimerism in one patient (day +90). Early transplant related complications were: bacterial sepsis (n=7), cytomegalovirus infection (n=6), pneumonia (n=3), primary graft failure (n=1), renal failure (n=1), Coombs positive hemolytic anemia (n=1), and calcineurin inhibitor related microangiopathy (n=1). Late transplant related complications were: spondylodiscitis (n=1) and Guillain Barre syndrome (n=1). No GVHD was documented in our cases. Conclusion: Intra-bone UCB transplantation is a procedure potentially overcoming the issue of graft failure due to the low number of UCB nucleated cells. Our preliminary data suggest that it's a valid option for patients without HLA compatible donor requiring allo-SCT, as soon as possible, because of high risk of relapse. The mechanisms of UCB engraftment and the low incidence of GVHD require further studies.",

Materials and Methods: The cell count was performed by using the Fast Read 102\u00ae disposable count chamber. As the cell count is a potency test, we had to check: accuracy, precision, and linearity. Viability was checked using the Trypan Blue vital dye. To validate the endotoxin test we used a kinetic Chromogenic LAL test: a limit test for the control of impurities. We evaluated precision, specifi city and detection limit on supernatant, on cell therapy products at different dilutions, and on pyrogenfree water as a negative control. The immunophenotype validation required a performance qualifi cation of the FACS Canto II using two types of standard beads to check the cytometer reproducibly set up. As an identity test, we evaluated specifi city by using the fl uorescence minus one (FMO) method: each cell population was stained with all kinds of fl uorochrome except that of interest. All the experiments were repeated thrice to test precision. The data were statistically analyzed by means (M), standard deviation (DS) and coeffi cient of variation percentage (CV%) inter and intra operator. Results: All the tests performed met the established acceptance criteria of CV% <10%. For the cell count, the precision reached by each operator had a CV% <10%. CV% of the cell viability in three different counts performed by the same operator was <5%. The best range of dilution, to obtain a slope line value very similar to 1, was between 1:10 and 1:50.

            "text": "Background: X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is a primary immunodefi ciency that mutations in gp91phox gene encoding component of NADPH enzyme system result to failure of production of microcidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) in granulocytes. Stem cell gene therapy is considered a promising therapy of disease. However, the existence of peripheral granulocytes with failure of functional reconstitution despite success of transduction of gp91phox gene has been a clinical problem. In previous, we demonstrated that transplanted hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from X-CGD mice transduced gp91phox gene clearly separated into two fractions of peripheral granulocytes: ROS productive or nonproductive populations even the presence of transgene in ROS non-productive population. Based on this result, we attempted to develop of gene therapy model to resolve a clinical problem in human gene therapy of X-CGD. Methods: BM KL (c-Kit+, lineage-) cells isolated from X-CGD mice were transduced with a retroviral vector harboring murine gp91phox cDNA together with Kusabira Orange (KO) gene. After culture, KL cells with KO dull intensities that mean minimum transduction of target gene were sorted. These cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated X-CGD mice. Functional reconstitution of peripheral granulocytes characterized by ROS production were assessed by APF dye staining assay in conjunction with KO fl uorescence intensities in Gra-1+ population of recipient mice. Results and Plan: The majority of reconstituted Gra-1+ cells from all 4 recipients were APFpositive-KObright population at 2 weeks after transplantation. However, these populations were clearly separated into 2 fractions: APFpositive-KObright and APFnegative-KOdull in 3 mice, and one recipient showed disappearance of APFpositive-KObright population at 4 weeks. Interestingly, one of three recipients showed gradually decrease of APFpositive-KObright population during an observation period. Thus, X-CGD mice showed gradual decrease of peripheral granulocytes achieved functional reconstitution even transplantation of KL cells transduecd target gene. This result seems to develop experimental model to resolve clinical problem in human gene therapy. We are studying several possibilities to explain this result: 1) low competitive repopulation activity or antigenicity of a transplanted cell of gene-transduced X-CGD HSPCs, or 2) conditions for expression of transgene or translation.",

We designed a comparative study of peripheral (adult, PB) versus umbilical cord blood (CB) derived EPCs in order to investigate the angiogenic properties of these two sources. Methods: Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from PB (n=4) and CB (<24 hours, n=4) and cultured on fi bronectin-coated cell culture plates in endothelial cell culture medium until the formation of cobblestone-shaped colonies. Colony-derived cells were expanded for further investigation and their endothelial phenotype was confi rmed evaluating the uptake of Di-Iacetylated-low-density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) and expression of endothelial cell-surface antigens (CD34, CD31, CD146, vWF, KDR) and CD45. Proliferation rates of CB and PB derived EPCs were determined using the MTT assay. The angiogenic properties of colony-derived EPCs were assessed by in vitro capillary-like network formation assay: early-passage cells were seeded (20,000 cells per well) onto 96-wells plates coated with Matrigel. Capillary-like network formation and maintenance were evaluated with an inverted microscope after 4-18-24-48-72 hours of incubation; images were taken from 3 random fi elds of Matrigel wells to assess the number of branch points per fi eld to quantify the degree of tubulogenesis. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Results: The median frequency of colonies obtained was higher in CB than PB (0.49/10 7 MNCs vs 0.05/10 7 MNCs) and CBderived EPCs had higher proliferative potential than PB-derived EPCs. Both CB and PB colony-derived cells incorporated Ac-LDL, expressed the endothelial cell-surface antigens and were CD45-. Both CB and PB derived EPCs formed capillary-like structures in Matrigel, but CB-derived tubes formed earlier and more complex networks than PB-derived EPCs. Moreover, the number of branch points in CB-derived capillary-like networks was higher than PB-derived networks (16.3\u00b14.3 vs 7.1\u00b1-2.6). Finally, CB-derived capillary-like networks were maintained for at least 72 hours, while PB-derived networks started to disassembly in 48 hours. Conclusion: Our study confi rms the different clonogenic and proliferative potential of EPCs derived from PB and CB and demonstrates a superior angiogenic potential of CB-derived cells. Our preliminary data indicate that CB-derived EPCs have a better angiogenic potential than PB-derived EPCs and CB is a promising source of EPCs for regenerative medicine purpose.",

Sonntag, A.R. Zander, N. Kr\u00f6ger, B. Fehse University Medical Center Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: Administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) may help prevent or treat relapse in Philadelphia positive leukaemia, however the feasibility and toxicity of this strategy is still under investigation. Besides their cytotoxic effects TKI have also been reported to be immunosuppressive. Application of TKI in the early post-transplant phase will often mean combined treatment with immunosuppressive agents like cyclosporine A (CSA), Tacrolimus or mTOR inhibitors [Rapamycin, (Rapa) or Everolimus]. Methods: We investigated the immunosuppressive and cytotoxic effects of Imatinib (Ima), Nilotinib (Nilo) and Dasatinib (Dasa) in combination with CSA or Rapa in vitro. T-cell stimulation was done with PHA, and Ki67 expression analysed after 72h by fl ow cytometry. Chromium-release assay was used to study effects on NK cell cytotoxicity. Drug toxicity on cell lines was analysed by fl ow cytometry after staining with 7AAD. Combination effects were analysed using Calcusyn\u00ae software. Results: All TKI had dose-dependent cytotoxicity on K562 cells. Addition of CSA or Rapa did not alter cytotoxicity. All TKI had dose-dependent inhibition of T cell activation and NK cell cytotoxicity. Combination of TKI and CSA or Rapa showed synergistic inhibition of T cell activation with combination index 0.47 to 0.74 for Ima + CSA, 0.28 to 0.56 for Nilo + CSA, 0.55 to 0.85 for Dasa + CSA, 0.25 to 0.63 for Ima + Rapa, 0.10 to 0.29 for Nilo + Rapa and 0.50 to 0.68 for Dasa + Rapa. A concentration of 5nM Dasa decreased CFU to 42% of control. Higher doses of Dasa were excluded to allow for analysis of drug combinations. Doses of other TKI were adjusted to 40nM Nilo and 120 nM Ima. Ima and Nilo reduced CFU to 59.8% and 91.8% respectively. CSA (200 ng/ml) and Rapa (0.5 nM) reduced CFU to 86.7% and 48.4% respectively. Addition of CSA to the TKI did not further reduce CFU while addition of Rapa to TKI strongly reduced CFU to 25.8%, 34% and 12.1%, for Ima, Nilo and Dasa respectively. Conclusion: Our data show combination effects of TKI with CSA and Rapa which need to be taken into consideration when combining these drugs. Our results lay the ground work for further preclinical and clinical studies. (1) Due to their ability to inhibit steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are viewed as a potent therapeutic adjuvant to complement allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However the mediators involved in alloreactive T cell inhibition by MSC are not fully identifi ed, nor is the relative importance of soluble versus membrane-bound molecules established. Because T cell inhibition is associated, in vitro with a transient binding to -and the transmigration under MSC, we investigated which surface molecules could be involved in these processes. Integrins such as LFA-1, Mac-1, and VLA-4 were identifi ed on activated T cells. These could respectively interact with I-CAM-1-2, V-CAM-1 and CD90/Thy-1 expressed on MSC. MSC also expressed junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-B and JAM-C which can bind VLA-4 and Mac-1 on T cells. Moreover both cell types expressed CD44, which could support T cell-MSC binding in the presence of hyaluronan (HA). Thus various pairs of receptor-ligand could be involved in T cell-MSC interactions. To identify which molecules were involved in cell binding, stimulated T cells were seeded over MSC in the presence or in the absence of blocking mAbs or excess of HA (known to inhibit CD44 interaction), and the number of bound T cells was assessed. When T cells stimulated for 48 hours with mitogens were incubated over MSC for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, only the anti-CD18 mAb (which inhibits both LFA-1 and Mac-1) signifi cantly decreased cell binding (residual binding 83% of control, n=6 p<0.032 Wilcoxon). Combining mAb together did not increase cell binding inhibition. The contribution of CD44 could not be assessed because the addition of HA to the assay did not generate reproducible results. None of the mAbs, nor HA (from 1 ug to 1 mg/ml) affected T cell proliferation in the absence of MSC, or impaired MSC-induced T cell inhibition, thus indicating that integrin-induced cell-cell interaction was not the effector of the inhibition. Moreover experiments performed with transwell systems showed that T cell transmigration under MSC was not associated with inhibition as long as the compartment where the cells landed after transmigration was voluminous.",

CN activity was assessed in the allogeneic recipients who were treated with TAC for graftversus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to investigate whether CN activity was increased in patients with severe acute GVHD. Methods: CN activity was analyzed in 10 consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). TAC was administered at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenously from day-1 to +21. TAC levels and CN activity was assessed on day-1 before TAC administration and days 0, +3, +7, +14, and +21. Target TAC concentration (15-20 ng/ml) was maintained during the current study. Results: The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (74.1% vs. 60.3%, p=0.888) and severe chronic GVHD (22.5% vs. 33.3%, p=0.539) were not different between high and low TAC trough levels. CN activity on day-1 was 0.12\u00b10.09 nmol and had decreased from baseline level (0.29\u00b10.15 nmol, p<0.001). There was no correlation between CN activity and TAC concentrations (r2=0.024). CN activity was steady-state during posttransplant day+0 to +14 regardless of acute GVHD, CN activity on day+21 for those with grade 2-4 acute GVHD showed higher CN activity (0.18\u00b10.04 nmol) compared to those without grade 2-4 acute GVHD (0.14\u00b10.05 nmol, p=0.462). Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (40% vs. 80%, p=0.248) and chronic GVHD (20% vs. 70%, p=0.464) between low and high CN activity group were not signifi cantly different. Conclusion: Maintaining target TAC trough level did not correlate with the development of GVHD in allogeneic recipients. Although GVHD was higher for the high CN activity on day+21, this pilot study failed to demonstrate signifi cant difference due to small sample size. However, the patients manifesting GVHD with high CN activity on post-transplant D+21 may need to be treated with other kinds of immunosuppressive agent regardless of drug level.",

Balb/cJ recipient mice were intravenously (IV) injected with 2,5x10 5 luciferase transfected MOPC-315.BM cells. At day 30 after inoculation, 6 mice received an autologous transplantation [P602] S185 (Balb/cJ cells) and 8 mice received an allogeneic transplantation (B10.D2 cells) by IV injection of 10x10 6 BM cells and 70x10 6 spleen cells. Prior to transplantation, both groups of mice were irradiated with 6 Gy. Tumor development was followed by measuring their bio-luminescence using VIVOVISION IVIS 200 (Xenogen) . Immune responses were followed by taking blood samples before transplantation (day -2), and at days 7 and 19 after transplantation, analysing lymphocyte counts and NK, NKT and T-cell subpopulations. When mice showed signs of paraplegia or signs of GVH disease, they were sacrifi ed and analysed for immune activation and regulation in different organs (blood, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus and bone marrow). In vivo imaging showed disappearance of the luciferase signal in 7 of the 8 allografted mice. All the mice that received an autologous transplantation developed myeloma disease. The recovery of myeloma diseased mice by this allogeneic transplantation could be attributed to an immune graft versus myeloma effect. Further analysis of the cellular subpopulations at sacrifi ce (Allografted vs Autografted mice) showed a decrease in regulatory T cells [% of CD4: Blood 5,5\u00b12,6 vs 18,4\u00b14,4 (p=1,6x10 -5 ); Spleen 20,6\u00b18 vs 24,7\u00b14,7 (p=0,29); BM 10,9\u00b16.5 vs 48,1\u00b16,4 (p=1,79x10 -7 )] and activation (CD69) of both CD4 T lymphocytes [% of CD4: Blood 45,4\u00b114,5 vs 14,6\u00b18,1 (p=0,0006); Spleen 44,9\u00b18,9 vs 23,1\u00b15,5 (p=0,0002); BM 60,4\u00b114,4 vs 46,2\u00b15,6 (p=0,04)] and CD8 T lymphocytes [% of CD8: Blood 51,6\u00b114,8 vs 12,3\u00b16,7 (p=6,2x10 -5 ); Spleen 46\u00b17,9 vs 11,2\u00b12,7 (p=2,5x 10 -7 ); BM 69,6\u00b19,6 vs 37, 6\u00b110,9 (p=8,1x10 -5 ) ]. The same trends were observed in simply allografted control mice. This model will be used for studying the mechanisms behind graft versus tumour effect (antigen mismatches, activation of T cell subpopulations) and the effects of immune suppressors (e.g. rapamycin) on the graft versus tumour effect. Background: Umbilical cord blood (CB) transplantation is known to be associated with delayed and defective immune reconstitution, in part because recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), have limited intrinsic survival. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) has been reported to increase the initial recovery of the graft-derived T-cells compartment. The aim of this study was to investigate CB-derived T-cell survival and to defi ne a minimal effective dose of recombinant human IL-7 (rIL-7), considering that in addition to its anti-apoptotic effect, IL-7 may enhance immune reactions that occur in the host, including acute GVHD. Methods: Fifteen CB were obtained after normal-term delivery, using the same procedure as for CB banking. T cells were isolated within 12 hours by negative magnetic bead sorting and cultured for 2 weeks either directly or after being frozen. Unstimulated T cell cultures were conducted in parallel in medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% normal AB serum) alone or supplemented with a range of rIL-7concentrations added either only once at day 0 (100 to 1000 pg/mL) or every day (10 to 100 pg/mL). Cell viability was assessed by fl ow cytometric scatter analysis and staining with 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3)] and propidium iodide. Results: In basic culture conditions, the majority of T cells had died over 2 weeks. There was heterogeneity in cell survival, with 2% to 50% viables T cells (median 15%) at day 6 of culture. Interestingly, the same intrinsic characteristics of survival were observed in T cells that underwent beforehand a freezing-thawing procedure. In cultures supplemented with rIL-7, we confi rmed the effi cacy of rIL-7 in maintaining CB T cell survival. A minimal dose of 25 pg/mL added daily was suffi cient to induce the prolonged survival of CB T cells, with more than 95% of viable cells at day 6. Noteworthy, these concentrations allowed prolonged survival of CD T cells without inducing any cell proliferation, as shown by the absence of CFSE dilution. Similar results were observed comparing CB cells that had been frozen or not. Conclusion: Repeated low-doses of rIL-7 are required to preserve the survival capacity of CB T cells without inducing their proliferation. These results could represent a framework for clinical studies aiming at improving T cell reconstitution following allogeneic CB transplantation. Repeated administration of lowdoses of rIL-7 might be especially useful in patients with low serum levels of IL-7 after conditioning.",

Methods: Piglets were allocated to receive either 4 d of Bu plus 2 days of Cy (1.6 and 60 mg/kg/d, respectively, Bu-Cy group, n=9) or saline (controls, n=8) intravenously. After 6 days chemotherapy or saline, pigs were kept for another 5 days until when intestinal samples were collected for histomorphometry (villus height and crypt depth), activity of six brush border enzymes (disaccharidases, peptidases) and tissue levels of cytokines (IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alfa) in the proximal and distal intestine. Results: Bu-Cy pigs had 40% shorter villi in the proximal intestine, relative to controls (p<0.01) while no difference was seen in the distal intestine. Crypt depths were smaller in both proximal and distal intestine (18-24%, p<0.05). Likewise, the activity of the brush border enzymes in the proximal intestine (sucrase, ApA, ApN and DPPIV) were 30-50% lower in Bu-Cy pigs compared with controls pigs (p<0.01 for all) while in the distal intestine only sucrase was lower in Bu-Cy pigs (p<0.05). No differences were found for maltase and lactase. IL-8 were 40% higher (p<0.05) in the proximal intestine while TNF-alfa levels were 50% higher in the distal intestine of Bu-Cy pigs (p<0.05). No difference was found for IL-1-beta. Conclusion: The Bu-Cy treatment resulted in structural damage and reduced functions, especially in the proximal part of the small intestine within 5 days after the 6 days treatment protocol. A faster enterocyte turnover in the proximal versus the distal intestine may explain that chemotherapy induces more marked effects proximally. The associated increases in tissue IL-8 and TNF-alfa levels refl ect local bacteria-stimulated infl ammatory reactions. These may accelerate damage and prime the tissue to later development of graft versus host diseas following infusion of a transplantat. Pharmacological and dietary factors should be investigated as means to reduce the immediate intestinal effects of Bu-Cy treatment. Background: Fludarabine-Cytabarine-Melphalan combination (FLAM) is a novel combination chemotherapy which theoretically has the advantage of being able to provide Central S186 Nervous System penetration (high dose cytarabine) as well as using 2 non-cross resistant chemotherapy drugs (Fludarabine and Melphalan) that is lympholytic and which most of the patients on lymphoma treatment would not have prior exposure. Methods: Selected patients with prior autologous peripheral blood stem cells collected(chemotherapy -GCSF mobilisation) were treated in Hospital Ampang from June 2011 till October 2011 with IV Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 for 5 days, IV Cytarabine 2000 mg/m 2 over 2 hours for 5 days, IV Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 for 1 day. Autologous stem cells were reinfused subsequently. Most of the patient received GCSF from D3 post reinfusion until neutrophil engraftment. Patients were monitored in the ward until stable engraftment. Demographic data, disease and remission status and chemotherapy toxicity, engraftment details were collected during the admission. Results: There were a total of 22 patients treated in total. 31.8% of the patients had Hodgkin Lymphoma, 68.1% had Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in which 50% was B cell lymphoma and 18.1% was T cell lymphoma. The main diagnosis was DLBCL (40.9%). 54.5% had no signifi cant oral mucositis. There was only 1 (4.5%) patient with grade 3 oral mucositis, 6 (27.3%) with grade 1 mucositis and 2 (9.1%) with grade 2 mucositis . Median autologous peripheral blood stem cell dose was 4.7x10 6 CD34/ kg. Median day of neutrophil engraftment was on Day +10 and median day of platelet engraftment was on Day +12. No grade 3 or grade 4 renal or liver toxicity was noted. There was 1 treatment related mortality (TRM) (4.5%) due to sepsis. Conclusions: FLAM is a promising and feasible novel high dose chemotherapy regime that could be used in combination with autologous stem cell rescue in lymphoma. TRM is acceptable and engraftment rates were comparable with other regimes. It appeared to be quite tolerable and there were minimal chemotherapy related toxicities. Long term remission and complications as well as effectiveness of the regime remained to be evaluated.",

But complete remission (CR) rates are about 30% to 40% after ASCT and most of patients will relapse at a median time of 2 to 3 years. Bortezomib has been demonstrated synergistic effects with melphalan. Ex-vitro study showed that the bortezomib using after HD-melphalan could induce more appotosis. We performed a pilot study by using high-dose melphalan followed by two doses of bortezomib as conditioning regimen for ASCT in Chinese patients with MM to evaluate its safety and effi cacy in improving response rate and survival. Methods: Patients younger than 65 years with newly diagnosed MM were enrolled. The induction regimen had no limited. The conditioning regimen consisted of administration of melphalan 200 mg/m 2 on day -2 and bortezomib 1.0 mg/m 2 on days +4 and +1 after peripheral blood stem cell infusion. Melphalan was given 140 mg/m 2 in patients older than 55 years or patients with mild to moderate organ insuffi ciency. Maintenance therapy with thalidomide was given 2 to 3 months post-ASCT. Results: Overall 35 patients with newly diagnosed MM were enrolled between November 2008 and November 2011. The median age of enrolled patient was 49 years (range, 34-65) years. Before ASCT patients' remission status included CR (n=14), near CR (nCR, n=9), very good partial remission (VGPR) (n=3), partial remission (PR, n=7), minimal remission (MR, n=1), relapse (n=1). Eighteen patients developed grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal adverse events after conditioning. No grade 3 to 4 peripheral neuropathy (PN) was reported. There was no treatment-related death.

Objectives: CD28, inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) belong to the same family of T-cell costimulatory molecules. After activation, three effector pathways have been described for T-cell cytotoxicity: granzyme B/perforin, Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) and secreted molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Near recently, several important polymorphisms have been identifi ed and reported to be associated with the risk of autoimmune diseases, malignancies and allograft rejection in solid organ transplantation patients. However, such information is less available in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In this study, we fi rst investigated the infl uence of those polymorphic features on the abilities of T-cell alloimmune responses, including inducing GVHD, prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and recurrence of the malignancy in allo-HSCT setting. Methods: We analyzed 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4, Granzyme B, Fas and FasL genes in 2 independent cohorts including 138 pairs of recipients and their unrelated donors (URDs) and 102 pairs of recipients and their HLA-identical sibling donors. Results: (1) We found unrelated donor with Granzyme B +55 mutated genotype (AA) was an independent risk factors for grades II-IV aGVHD (P =0.024, RR=1.811). While unrelated donor with CTLA-4 CT60 mutated genotype (AA) was protective (P =0.025, RR=3.806). (2) However, donors with CTLA-4 CT60 AA genotype were contributed to the development of early CMV infection (P<0.0001, RR=0.383) and relapse post-HSCT in AML patients (P=0.047, RR=2.792). Furthermore, AML patients with Fas -670 homogeneous mutated allele (TT genotype) also had a higher risk of relapse (P= 0.003, RR=3.823). (3) Patients were stratifi ed into 2 groups including 131 patient-donor pairs were with at least one susceptible allele (patients receiving CTLA-4 CT60 AA donor, patients receiving GranzymeB +55 AA donor, AML patients with Fas -670 TT genotype or with all), and 109 patient-donor pairs were with wild-type genotypes. The presence of those susceptible alleles in donor and/ or recipient resulted in a reduced overall survival ( Figure) . Conclusions: Our data highlight the important effect of genetic variations in T-cell activation and effector pathways from the donors and recipients on the outcomes of allo-HSCT, which suggests that genotype analysis of these genes can be used for pre-HSCT risk assessment.",

Finke Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, DE) Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important pathogen recognition receptor. Recent evidence suggests that the ability to respond properly to TLR ligands may be impaired by single nucleotide polymorphisms within TLR genes. HSCT is associated with several complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and an increased risk of infections. Therefore polymorphisms on TLR4 may infl uence individual susceptibility to GVHD or infectious complications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the infl uence of TLR4 polymorphism on complications after allogeneic HSCT. A total of 264 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT and their respective donors were retrospectively genotyped using pyrosequencing for two polymorphisms in TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile). Allele frequency of TLR4 was similar in the patients and donors group. The wild type AA and CC genotype was present in 89% of the patients. No homozygous mutated genotype was found for both polymorphisms. An increased relative risk of acute GVHD was observed in the group of patients with the AG genotype (RR 2.09 95% CI:1.17-3.37) although the difference was not signifi cant (p=0.08) in univariate analysis. In addition, the incidence of fungal infections in patients bearing the AG genotype was signifi cantly higher compared with the AA genotype (p=0.044). TLR4 Thr399Ile polymorphism was not associated with clinical complications or transplantation outcome. Other post transplant characteristics such as cytomegalovirus reactivation, chronic GVHD, overall survival and disease free survival were unrelated to the presence of these polymorphisms. Typing for the Asp299Gly polymorphism in TLR4 may result in a reduced incidence of fungal infections in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. A larger prospective study is required to defi ne genetic susceptibility to complications after allogeneic HSCT. Introduction: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and severe sepsis (SS) are major complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) whit signifi cant impact on early transplant related mortality (TRM). In both conditions early specifi cally tailored therapy is mandatory therefore identifi cation of serum markers with high sensitivity and specifi city for diagnosis could have an impact on survival. Objective: This retrospective analyze aimed at evaluating the importance of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) assessment in early detection of VOD and SS. Method The study group consisted of 11 recipients of allo-HSCT with a mean age of 33.18\u00b117.42 and a sex ratio of 4.5:1 (male:female). Indications for allo-HSCT included both malignant (10/11) and nonmalignant (1/11) hemopathies. Busulfan based conditioning regimens were applied in 90.9% of case, without use of total body irradiation. All patients received primary prophylaxis for infections with cyprofl oxacine, fl uconazole, TMP/SMX, acyclovir and for VOD with unfractionated heparine (120UI/kg). The nursing of patients was performed in laminar airfl ow rooms. Diagnosis of VOD was established based on Baltimore criteria. Electrochemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay was used for measuring plasma BNP before (day -7, 0) and after (day +7, +14) allo-HSCT. Results: VOD and SS were each diagnosed in 36.36% of patients.

The main complication after allo-HSCT which affects survival remains graft versus host disease (GvHD). The genetic polymorphisms in genes coding cytokines, chemokines and metabolic enzymes have been shown to infl uence GvHD, toxic complications and outcome after allo-HSCT. This study aimed to determine association between polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) genotypes with the outcome of allo-HSCT performed between August 2003 and October 2011 in our center. Materials and Methods: The allelic variants of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were determined in 109 patient/donor pairs by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients characteristics were: median age-36 (range 18-65), underlying diseaseshematologic malignancies-in 103 and aplastic anemia-in 6 cases. Donors were HLA-identical sibling-in 70 and unrelated-in 39 transplants, the median age-37 (range 14-65). The studied end points were GvHD, haemorrhagic cystitis, toxicity and venooclusive disease (VOD) of the liver and survival. The Spearman's rank correlation test and the Kaplan-Meier method were used in statistical analysis. Results: The allelic distribution of examined polymorhisms was similar to that reported in Caucasoid population. Acute-GvHD was recognized in 42/109 (38,5%) and chronic -in 51/109 (46,8%) of patients. Overall survival in analysed group was 66,1%. Our study revealed signifi cant correlation between the occurrence of aGvHD and the GSTM1-positive/GSTT1 -null genotype in recipients (P=0.0167). Besides we found a signifi cant correlation between the GSTT1 -positive genotype in donors and increased treatment related mortality at the 180 day in patients (P=0.029). We also revealed some relations indicative of the trend between increased risk of mortality and GSTM1-positive/GSTT1-positive genotype (P=0.077) and GSTM1-positive/GSTT1-null genotype (P=0.082) in recipients. We couldn't fi nd any signifi cant correlations between examined polymorphisms and the rest of analysed end points (P=ns). Conclusion: Our data revealed that GSTM1-positive genotype is correlated with aGvHD and increased risk of mortality after allo-HSCT.

P\u00e9rez, E. Allende, A. Gelabert, F. Bosch, D. Valcarcel Hospital Vall Hebron Barcelona (Barcelona, ES) Introduction: Liver biopsy might be necessary in the diagnosis of liver dysfunction after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Due to the complications related to transparietal (TP) access, transjugular liver biopsies (TJLB) are usually preferred, specially in the early period. We retrospectively analyzed the role of TJLB in the diagnosis of early hepatic dysfunction after allo-SCT. Methods: All consecutive allo-SCT recipients undergoing TJLB in our centre from May 1997 to September 2011 were included. Median follow-up for survivors was 28 months . According to our protocol, TJLB instead of TP access was preferred in patients with platelet count <50x10e9/L, coagulation abnormalities or unstable medical condition. TJLB were performed using a plastic needle guide through jugular access. Pathological samples were analyzed by an experienced pathologist in the centre and revised retrospectively. Results: A total of 23 TJLB were performed on 20 patients (13% of the 153 allo-SCT performed during the study period). Median age was 29 years (range 17-64). Most patients received myeloablative allo-SCT mainly for AML. Most frequent clinical suspicions before TJLB were venooclusive disease (VOD) (n=10, 44%) and GVHD (n=10, 44%). Transjugular access was chosen because of thrombocytopenia (n=11, 47%), coagulation abnormalities (n=2, 4%) or both (n=10, 43%). Median bilirrubin level at the time of TJLB was 8 mg/dL . Median time from transplantation to TJLB was 38 days (range 12-152). The most common histological fi ndings were iron overload (n=10, 43%), cholestasis (n=8, 35%), and portal fi brosis (n=7, 30%). A defi nitive histopathological diagnosis was obtained from 15 out of 23 biopsies (65%), including 5 (21%) VOD, 5 toxic hepatitis (21%), 2 liver GVHD (8%), 2 cholangitis lenta due to sepsis (8%) and 1 CMV hepatitis (4%). Eight (35%) biopsies were non-diagnostic, 6 due to unspecifi c fi ndings/mild iron overload and 2 due to insuffi cient sample size. Main clinical suspicion was confi rmed after the biopsy in 8 (35%) cases while in 9 (39%) it revealed another diagnosis which led to a new therapeutic approach. Most frequent TJLB-related complications were subcutaneous hematoma (n=3, 13%). There was 1 (4%) TJLB-related death because of severe bleeding. Conclusion: TJLB appears to be relatively safe in the early post-allo-SCT period although its usefulness as a diagnostic tool might be impaired due to unspecifi c fi ndings or small sample size.",

Our results support that while high levels both of CRP and PCT associated with infection, only high level of CRP (PCT hight not accompanied) related with engraftment in periengraftment period.",

Roziakova (1) Background: Cardiac complications are frequently found lifethreatening conditions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Serial measurements of cardiospecifi c biomarkers can be a valid diagnostic tool for early identifi cation, assessment, and monitoring of cardiotoxicity. The aim of the study was the assessment of the cardiotoxicity using cardiac biomarkers -N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) during HSCT. Methods: Thirty-seven patients who were treated with allogeneic HSCT for hematologic diseases at median age of 28 years (range: 19-58) at time of HSCT were studied. Conditioning regimen included either chemotherapy without total body irradiation (TBI) or combination of chemotherapy with TBI. Twenty-nine (78,3%) patients were treated with prior ANT therapy (with median cumulative dose 250 mg/m 2 , range: 100-470). Together 148 blood samples were evaluated. Cardiac biomarkers were measured serially before conditioning regimen and at days 1, 14 and 30 after HSCT. In all patients, echocardiograms were performed before conditioning regimen and 1 month after HSCT. Only patients with persistently increased NT-proBNP had signifi cant elevations in hs-cTnT concentrations at day 14 (P<0,01) and a signifi cant worsening of the left ventricular diastolic and systolic parameters were found after 1 month. Five of 11 (45,4%) patients with persistently increased NT-proBNP developed clinical manifestation of cardiotoxicity. Conclusions: Persistently increased NT-proBNP for a period exceeding 14 days after HSCT is strongly associated with development of echocardiographic abnormalities and might be used for identifi cation of patients at risk of developing cardiotoxicity and requiring further cardiological follow up.

Afanasyev Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We analyzed relationship between VEGF levels, risk and severity of veno-occlusive disease (VOD), early relapse and impact on engraftment. Study group comprised 32 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (16), chronic myeloid leukemia (7), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3) and other hematologic malignancies (7). Mean age was 41 years (range 16-60). 23 were grafted from unrelated and 9 from related donor. Majority of patients received reduced intensity conditioning. VEGF was measured by ELISA before conditioning, on day 0, upon engraftment and in case of VOD. Moderate to severe VOD with capillary leak syndrome developed in 15% of patients. VEGF levels were not different in patients who developed VOD compared to other alloSCT patients (p>0.05) and control group (p>0.05). Higher levels of VEGF were observed in patients with early relapse after alloSCT (p=0.03) and were associated with delayed engraftment (p<0.01). Elevation of VEGF after conditioning, on day 0, was of highest prognostic signifi cance for disease progression during 100 days after alloSCT. Our preliminary data indicates that high level of VEGF may be considered as unfavorable factor for engraftment and early relapse after alloSCT in patients with hematologic malignancies. Development of VOD was not associated with alteration of VEGF concentrations.",

We hypothesized that polymorphisms of this gene might affect clinical outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Three calcitriol receptor gene polymorphisms (BsmI G>A: rs1544410, ApaI G>T: rs7975232 and TaqI T>C: rs731236) were genotyped in 152 patients who underwent HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT in a single institution between 1998 and 2005. Frequencies of infection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared according to genotypes and haplotypes. Results: For ApaI, infection was more frequent in patients with the non-TT genotypes (GG or GT) than those with the TT genotype (87.3% vs. 61.6%; p=0.061). Grade II-IV acute GVHD developed less frequently in patients with the ApaI TT genotype than those with the non-TT genotypes (7.7% vs 35.3%; p=0.059). For TaqI and BsmI genotypes, there were no statistical differences in frequency of infection and acute GVHD (p=0.84 and p=0.30, respectively). However, no calcitriol receptor genotype of recipients showed association with development of chronic GVHD. In the ApaI-TaqI haplotype analysis, patients with TC haplotype had signifi cantly longer OS and DFS than those without TC haplotype in univariate analysis (p=0.022 and p=0.038, respectively). In multivariable analysis, ApaI-TaqI haplotype as well as ApaI and TaqI genotype were independent prognostic factors of OS (HR=3.03, 95% CI: 1.320-6.937; p=0.009 for ApaI-TaqI haplotype and TaqI genotype, and HR=3.03, 95% CI: 1.084-8.403; p=0.035 for ApaI genotype), and TaqI genotype and the ApaI-TaqI haplotype were also independent prognostic factors of DFS (HR=5.24, 95% CI: 1.255-21.849; p=0.023 for both). Conclusion: Our results showed that ApaI genotype might be associated with acute GVHD and infection, and TaqI genotype and ApaI-TaqI haplotype were independent prognostic factors in terms of OS and DFS. This study suggests that the genotype and haplotype of calcitriol receptor in recipient might be associated with clinical outcome of sibling HLA-matched HSCT. (1), A.

            "text": "Background: Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) are essential nutrients for haematopoiesis, immunocompetence, antioxidant defence, DNA structure and replication. Their status maybe altered in SCT recipients due to increased requirements, impaired intake or losses secondary to disease or treatment side effects. Monitoring of Zn, Cu and Se in patients receiving artifi cial nutrition support (ANS) is recommended however the systemic infl ammatory response (SIR) alters levels irrespective of intake. Plasma Zn and Se fall due to increased capillary permeability and tissue redistribution whereas plasma Cu rises with elevated caeruloplasmin synthesis. This observational study aimed to consider SIR and identify subjects at risk of defi ciency during SCT. Methods: Plasma Zn, Cu and Se were measured prospectively from pre-assessment to discharge on days -1, +6, +20, +34, +48 and +62 of SCT. CRP was simultaneously measured to indicate a SIR. Data regarding ANS was recorded. Results: 60 subjects were analysed according to transplant type; autologous (auto n=19), reduced intensity conditioned (RIC n=23) myeloablative conditioned allogeneic (MA n=18). Plasma Zn and Se were negatively correlated with CRP whereas plasma Cu showed positive association therefore values recorded when CRP >20 mg/L were excluded to avoid confounding by SIR. Pre/post-SCT plasma Zn was within range for auto and RIC groups however medians for MA SCT were 9.3 \u03bcmol/L (n=13, IQR 8.2-10.7) pre and 10.0 \u03bcmol/L (n=18 IQR 8.9-11.1) post SCT. Overall, Zn was below the reference range in 28% (n=11) prior to and 19% (n=6) post SCT. Adjusted Cu values were within range pre and post SCT. Median Se was normal pre-SCT but reduced post-SCT in auto (p=0.006) and MA (p=0.003) subjects. Levels suggested defi ciency in the auto group post SCT; median Se 0.73 (n=11, IQR 0.70-0.89). Overall the proportion with Se < reference range increased from 9% (n=4) pre-compared to 20% (n=12) post SCT (p=0.004). ANS use of > 4 days by group was 5% (n=1) autos, 52% (n=12) RIC and 89% (n=16) MA (p=0.000). Discussion: Plasma Zn was low pre MA SCT and remained borderline defi cient despite ANS use in 89% of subjects. Increased Zn intake may benefi t this group, but inappropriate supplementation causes iatrogenic Cu defi ciency hence a targeted approach is needed. Plasma Se signifi cantly reduced in MA and auto SCT. Final levels approached defi ciency in auto recipients who also received the least ANS suggesting oral Se intakes maybe inadequate.",

Immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with a compromised innate and adaptive immune response. Phagocytic activity in monocyte subpopulations may be similarly altered during the post-transplant period and during adverse events after HSCT. We analyzed phagocytic activity of three monocytes subpopulations before, during and up to one year after HSCT, as well as during transplant-related adverse events. Patients and Methods: 25 children and young adults with hemato-oncological malignancies and immunodefi ciency disorders (median age of 11.0 years) were enrolled after informed written consent. FITC-labeled Escherichia coli bacteria were used to assess phagocytic activity of monocyte subpopulations CD14++/CD16-(M1), CD14++/CD16+ (M2) and CD14+/ CD16++ (M3) from a control group of healthy children (n=36) and the patient group. by fl ow cytometry ( Figure 1 ). Results: Median data acquisition period of phagocytic activity in monocyte subpopulations for the patient group was 213 days (range 45-382 days). By analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) phagocytic activity was not infl uenced in any of the three monocyte subpopulations by age or sex in the healthy control group. During the post transplant period, a signifi cant increase of phagocytic activity of M2 CD14++/CD16+ monocytes was observed on day 30 after HSCT (P < 0.001). Phagocytosis was signifi cantly reduced in M3 CD14+/CD16++ monocytes during sepsis or bacteremia (P < 0.01). During veno-occlusive disease (VOD), a signifi cant increase of M2 CD14++/CD16+ monocytes (P=0.001) and a signifi cant decrease of phagocytic activity in M1 CD14++/CD16-monocytes (P < 0.001) was observed. During VOD therapy, M2 CD14++/CD16+ monocytes (P < 0.01) decreased signifi cantly and reached baseline levels. Phagocytic activity was not altered in any of the three monocyte subpopulations during GvHD and during treatment of acute GvHD. Conclusion: Different patterns of phagocytic activity of monocytes subpopulations were observed during adverse events after HSCT. We conclude that these alterations contribute to the altered immune response accompanying the adverse events after HSCT.",

This is exacerbated by the patient's psychological state with many being depressed or showing features of food avoidance and lack of appetite related to experience of nausea post chemotherapy. Most patients are managed using oral nutritional support.

Hunter Leicester Royal Infi rmary (Leicester, UK) The outcome of patients undergoing intensive chemo-radiation therapy associated with HPCT is adversely affected by the nutritional status of the patient. Pretransplant many patients have already undergone chemotherapy associated with severe [P619] S194 nausea and mucositis and may be nutritionally stressed at the outset. Combining the pre transplant state with the effect of mucositis during transplantation and the issue of gut GVHD is a potent cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Many units use parental nutrition in this population but this is not without risk and does not aid gut health and performance. We have previously reported on our experience of the use of elective PEG-J insertion in this population group. The data presented here is an expansion of this previous work in a larger cohort of patients. Method: All patients undergoing allo-HPCT are assessed pre transplant by a nutritional team. PEG-J insertion is carried out 2-4 weeks prior to transplantation. Patients who are malnourished at referral are commenced on nighttime PEG-J feeding prior to admission. All other patients are commenced at the time of admission and continued until discharge or post discharge when a preset target weight has been reached and maintained. Results: 64 patients were transplanted between Nov 2008 and Sept 2011 54 of whom are evaluable. Male 37, Female 27, Mean Age 48.6 (range 20-73 years). Indications for transplantation are 20AML, 5ALL, 12NHL, 5HD, 4CLL , 1CML 1MM, 1AA. Donor sourse matched sibling or MUD. At admission the average BMI was 26. 1 (16.4-41.1) . 38 patients had a PEG-J inserted. Average length of PEG-J feeding was 75 days (0-651). Average weight loss at discharge was 1.95 kg (9.9 loss to 4.75 kg gain) and 3.73 kg (19.8 loss to 1.8 kg gain) for PEG-J and non-PEG-J patients respectively. At 100 days post HPCT average weight loss was 0.98 (9 loss to 9.9 kg gain) versus 5.02 kg (21.8 loss to 5.15 kg gain) in PEG-J and non-PEG-J feed patients. 28% of non-PEG-J managed patients required PN versus only 15% in the PEG-J group. 18.5% patients had an infection at the insertion site requiring antibiotics. Tube removal occurred 227 (35-658) days after removal. Conclusion: PEG-J feeding can be safely undertaken in patients undergoing Allo-HPCT. PEG-J feeding reduces weight loss and minimises PN use and aids in patients recovery. Background: There is an unmet need for developing the reliable and useful screening methods evaluating nutritional risk in lymphoma patients. PURPOSE: To evaluate effects of high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (AHCT) on selected parameters of nutritional status in patients with lymphoma and to identify patients at risk of acute malnutrition posttransplant. Methods: We evaluated outcome of 15 consecutive patients treated for lymphoma as well as selected parameters of nutritional status and searched for possible predictive factors for development of the acute malnutrition syndrome and other complications of treatment. Serum prealbumin, albumin, transferrin, and CRP levels were determined before the start of conditioning treatment, on day 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 after transplantation. Variation of the results of nutritional markers in the period of hospitalization after AHCT in relation to the value before treatment and the correlation with the course of the post-transplant period were evaluated. Results: Statistical analysis showed a signifi cant reduction in the level of albumin and prealbumin on day 7 and 10 after AHCT. Transferrin levels were decreased on day 3 after AHCT, as well as on day 7 and 10. In a group of patients with BMI below 20, all patients developed diarrhea and a severe infection during post transplant period. In addition, there was a correlation between selected parameters and the occurrence of infection, fever and diarrhea. Conclusions: Patients that undergoing AHCT are exposed to an acute condition protein-caloric malnutrition that may have an adverse impact on the course in post-transplantation period. In addition, we found that changes in concentrations of biochemical parameters at different time points in relation to AHCT may be predictive of complications during posttransplantation period. Attention should be paid to a lower concentration of prealbumin in the period prior to treatment that is correlated with diarrhea post-transplant. The nutritional status of patients may determine the risk of complications and may thus guide prophylactic interventions like nutritional therapy. Patients with reduced BMI values prior to treatment are at increased risk of complications during post transplant period.",

Patients and Methods: There were 16 patients (M: 10, F: 6) who had been estimated about physiological functions after allo-HSCT between February 2010 and July 2011 in Imamura Bunin Hospital. Median age of patients was 58 (range: 28-65) yrs. Physical therapies, which were consisted 20 to 40 minutes per day and performed 5 days a week, were carried out by physical therapists. Physiological functions wear evaluated by 6 minute walking distance (6MD) and handgrip. Body composition was evaluated using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Evaluations were carried out at the timings of 2 weeks before allo-HSCT and after neutrophil recovery. We statistically analyzed about changes of physical strengths and body compositions. Results: Median time to evaluate after allo-HSCT was 39 (range: 18-70) days. Change rates of physical strength before and after were -2.1% of 6MD and -8.6% handgrip respectively. This results indicated 6MD maintained but handgrip (p=0.03). Change rates of body compositions were -2.9% of total body muscle mass, -4.9% upper extremity muscle mass (-5.8% upper arm, -3.4% forearm), 2.7% lower extremity muscle mass (-1.1% femur, 10.5% lower leg), -6.2% trunk muscle mass, -10.2% fat body mass, -2.6% lean body mass, -4.6% bone mass, -2.6% body water volume, and -4.1% body weigh respectively. Upper extremity muscle mass (p=0.03), trunk muscle mass (p=0.04), body weight (p<0.01), fat body mass (p=0.02), lean body mass (p<0.01) were signifi cantly reduced after allo-HSCT respectively.

Material and Methods: HRQoL questionnaire was prepared for all transplanted patients. A total of 45 patients were included for assessment during 2010-2011 (13 patients treated with allogeneic HSCT and 32 with autologous HSCT). EORTC QLQ was used as a questionnaire for assessment, consisted of 29 items and 6 multi item scales and 8 single items concerning risk factors, age, comorbidity, conditioning, support, GVHD, emotional, social and physical functioning. The patients were assessed 1, 3, 6 and 12 months posttransplant. Results: One year EFS was 71% in auto and 81% in allo recipients respectively.

Main decision maker to switch from 4QD scheme to QD IV Bu is haematologist. Main drivers of the decision are publications showing similar effi cacy and toxicity for both schemes and the opportunity to get 'smoother organisations' in pharmacies and BMT units. Few barriers are mentioned except that QD is unlabeled. Overall perception of QD versus 4QD IV Bu is very positive. Globally, stakeholders evaluate both options equivalent in terms of effi cacy, perceive a better safety with QD IV Bu, a signifi cantly better convenience and improvement of patients' comfort. It reduces the risk of errors and staff exposure during preparation, avoids complications for patients related to repeated infusions (e.g. infections) and constitutes a signifi cant benefi t for patients avoiding night infusions with stress and anxiety. Switching from 4QD IV Bu to QD IV Bu signifi cantly impacts on health care organisation. With QD, IV Bu preparation is better integrated in the global management and usual timelines of other anti-cancer drugs in the pharmacy and in BMT units. For nurses, QD IV Bu contributed to smoother timings of overall conditioning therapies administration. In addition, it reduces the needs of in-ward preparation to palliate the unavailability of teams in central pharmacies during the week-end. Time spent to prepare and administer IV Bu once daily was signifi cantly reduced: >1 hour nursing time and about 40 minutes pharmacy technician time saved per patient and per day, respectively 70% and 60% time savings. In addition, QD IV Bu reduces the use of small medical devices and concomitant drugs (e.g. anti-emetics, parenteral nutrition, anxiolytics). This leads to substantial fi nancial savings.",

Georgievski University Hematology Hospital (Skopje, MK) Introduction: DMSO is one of the contributors for morbidity during transplant procedures with cryopreserved stem cells. The safety profi le of DMSO is still to be evaluated, concerning the concentration used in the freezing procedures, as well as the amount during infusion in the transplant setting. Aim: To evaluate the incidence of DMSO side effects among autologous recipient with lymphoid malignancies in a single center experience of infusion of cryopreserved autologous stem cells with 10% and 5% DMSO solutions. Material and Methods: A total of 81 patients with lymphoid malignancies have been evaluated for DMSO related toxicity during the autologous transplant setting, 32 myeloma patients, 19 with lymphoma, 30 patients with Hodgkin disease. The frozen cell concentration was limited in the cryopreservation bags up to 1x10(8)/ml. DMSO was not washed out from the preserved grafts and was administered through a fi lter in the infusion line. The returning of the frozen cells was performed in split doses depending on the amount of the graft. The upper limit in the amount of DMSO given per day was 1 g/kg. Results: PBSC autologous grafts were 224ml in volume (62-600) before freezing, median 480,66ml (140-1000) after freezing, MNC number 3,39x10(8)/kg (1, (4) (5) (6) (7) 5) , CD34+cells/kg median 2,5 x10(6)/kg (1, 8) viability of 74% (20-90), median 42 days (8-150) of storage. Statistical analysis of DMSO toxicity revealed moderate to mild reactions in the lymphoma group, nausea or vomiting and hypo or hypertension with the incidence of 1,2%. In the myeloma group the incidence was signifi cantly higher 2,7%. The odds ratio (OR) in the myeloma patients was 1,41 (0, 07 ) and the lymphoma patients had OR 2, 9 (1, 89) . Conclusion: The incidence of DMSO related toxicity is higher among myeloma patients that received melphalan conditioning. Does the dose of melphalan have its infl uence on the severity of this side effects is a question that has to be evaluated in a randomized study. Strategies to reduce DMSO exposure are still to be analyzed and can avoid some of the complications of autologouse transplantation.",

Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the incidence, manifestations, and clinical outcomes of PES in SCT recipients, who had received SCT at the Department of Pediatrics Hokkaido University. Patients and Methods: We reviewed medical records of consecutive 186 child SCT recipients between April 1996 and September 2011. Indications for SCT were: hematological malignancies in 106 patients, bone marrow failure in 27, solid tumor in 35, congenital immunodefi ciency in 14, and congenital metabolic diseases in 4 patients. Preparative conditioning regimen consisted of myeloaberative conditioning (MAC) was provided to 163 patients, and non-myeloabelative (NMAC) was to 23 patients. Eighty-eight patients received prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (FK) in combination with methotrexate, and fi fty-four patients received CsA or FK with methylprednisolone. PES was defi ned with noninfectious fever and skin rashes with or without the evidence of fl uid retention and/or respiratory distress occurring before three days of neutrophil engraftment; an absolute neutrophil count of >0.5x10 9 /l. Results: PES developed in 29 of the 104 allo-BMT/PBSCT, 32 of the 53 allo-CBT, and 5 of the 29 auto-SCT patients. In allo-SCT, the incidence of acute GVHD following PES was signifi cantly higher than in the non-PES group (p=0.016). In allo-CBT, the incidence of PES in the patients receiving MAC was signifi cantly higher than in those receiving NMAC (p=0.035). Venoocculusive disease (VOD) and intracranial hemorrhage (IH) were recognized in only the PES group, and the incidence of VOD in the PES group was signifi cantly higher than that in the non-PES group in auto-SCT patients (p=0.005). Corticosteroids were required in 13 patients, and one patient died due to PES. There was no signifi cant association between the development of PES and the donor engraftment, the speed of neutrophil recovery, non-relapse mortality, virus reactivation, or survival. Conclusion: PES was more common after CBT. Although the differentiation with PES and early onset GVHD was diffi cult, corticosteroid therapy should not hesitate because virus reactivation did not have signifi cant difference, and PES was associated with early severe complications of SCT such as VOD and IH.

Results: Transplant characteristics were as follows: median age 7 years; median weight, 23.5kg; 58.0% male; 41.2% doubleunit CBT; 83.1% hematologic malignant disease; and myeloablative regimen in 68.3%. pES developed in 99 patients (26.1%) at a median of 6 days after transplant. Clinical manifestations associated with pES included fever (93.9%), skin rash (81.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), weight gain >3% (27.3%), pulmonary edema (13.3%), and central nervous system symptoms (8.0%).

Introduction: Engraftment syndrome (ES) is an infl ammatory condition during neutrophil recovery following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) characterized by noninfectious fever, skin rash, noncardiogenic pulmonary infi ltrates. But data of ES in pediatric double-unit cord blood transplantation (DUCBT) are scarce. Because of unique engraftment kinetics of DUCBT, distinctive patterns of ES could be defi ned as periengraftment syndrome (peri-ES). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of 298 patients (355 transplantations) who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT from October 2004 to April 2011. Diagnosis of peri-ES was established by the presence of all three major criteria or two major criteria and one or more minor criteria suggested by Spitzer, excluding 'within 96 hours of engraftment' criteria. Results: Of 298 patients (355 transplantations), 32 patients (32 transplantations) developed peri-ES with the estimated cumulative incidence of 9.0%. High cumulative incidence (56%) was shown in patients who had undergone a DUCBT (27 of 48 patients, p<0.05). The mean onset day of peri-ES of DUCBT cohort was day -5 (range, day -28 to 17) from neutrophil engraftment with mean duration of 4.5 days long (range, 1 to 22 days). In a univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis in DUCBT cohort, use of TBI (p=0.032 and p=0.043, respectively) was identifi ed as risk factor predisposing for the development of peri-ES. However, the total infused CD3+ and CD34+ cell count were not statistically signifi cant risk factors. There was no association between the development of peri-ES and aGVHD, cGVHD, VOD, time to neutrophil engraftment. With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, disease-free survival (p=0.51), overall survival (p=0.53) and non-relapse mortality (p=.993) did not differ between peri-ES group and the other in DUCBT cohort. Conclusions: Not only neutrophil engraftment, but immune reactions within two cord blood units might contribute to the development of ES. So the concept of peri-ES could be applied to the patients who underwent DUCBT, particularly. Conditioning regimen with TBI was identifi ed as a signifi cant risk factor predisposing for peri-ES in DUCBT cohort. Further study about the pathophysiology of peri-ES in DUCBT is warranted.",

This syndrome associates microangiopathic hemolysis with renal and/or neurologic impairment. The relation between allogeneic HSCT and endothelial injury are complex. To examine this association, we retrospectively studied 1,503 allogeneic patients (median age 48, range 13-73 years) between January 2002 and September 2011. Among these patients, 1028 (68.4%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) (523 pts (38.4%) had a severe aGvHD of grade \u2265 II). We followed 18 patients (12 male, 6 female) in whom concomitant presence of megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (<25/nl), Coombs\u00b4-negative hemolytic anemia (<10 g/dl), absent or reduced plasma haptoglobin levels, fragmented erythrocytes and increased serum level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with no other identifi able cause for those abnormalities, characteristics for TMA. Sepsis and autoimmune hemolysis were excluded. The median age at transplant was 45.5 (range, 19-60) years. Onset of TMA was at day 29 range, 15-48) after HSCT. Median level profi le of enzymatic activity of the plasma metalloprotease (ADAMTS13), von Willebrand factor (VWF): AG and VWF: multimers showed not signifi cant difference in the group of TMA versus controls without TMA. TMA had a higher prevalence in older adults and in male patients. TMA occurred in 94% in patients, who were transplanted with G-CSF mobilized and peripherally collected stem cells (PSC), but in only 6% in patients with bone marrow (BM) source, comparing all transplanted patients (1342 PSC, 161 BM). Stem cell grafts from matched unrelated donor (67%) versus related donors were associated with a higher risk of TMA. Severe aGvHD of grade \u2265 III occurred more frequently in the groups with TMA (10/18 vs. 523/1503), and extensive chronic GvHD (28%) was ascertained in TMA patients vs. 19.3% in all transplanted patients. All patients with TMA died from multiple organ failure. In conclusion, our evaluation confi rms a strong association between G-CSF mobilized PSC, severe aGvHD, unrelated donors and the development of TMA.",

Sureda Cambridge University Hosptal Foundation Trust (Cambridge, UK) A 51 year old lady with stage IV diffuse large B cell lymphoma previously treated with RCHOP and RESHAP resulting in a partial response was admitted for sibling allogeneic transplant. She deteriorated clinically at day 34 and developed a rash and abnormal liver function and was diagnosed with grade 2 graft-versus-host disease which was treated with high dose steroids. Concurrently it was noticed that her renal function was deteriorating with a falling platelet count and a high LDH. A blood fi lm showed red cell fragments, spherocytosis and polychromasia. She was diagnosed with transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA). Her calcineurin inhibitor was stopped and plasma exchange was started. This was stopped after 6 days due to poor response and a high ADAMSTS13 level of 41%. Her renal function deteriorated further and she was started on haemodialysis. Due to previously reported benefi t in renal transplant patients with TA-TMA Eculuzimab was obtained on a compassionate use basis and the patient received a dose of 900 mg weekly for 4 weeks. Within 2 weeks of starting her treatment with Eculuzimab she was dialysis independent with a 50% reduction in the number of fragments seen on her blood fi lm. Her platelet count has remained low and a repeat marrow has shown hypoplastic changes with no evidence of lymphoma. We describe for the fi rst time the successful treatment of TA-TMA with Eculuzimab. Given the poor prognosis of this condition this treatment may offer new hope to transplant patients who develop this rare but life threatening complication.",

Anagnostopoulos George Papanicolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) We studied prospectively, risk factors and VOD-incidence in relation to anti-VOD prophylaxis, in 336 patients who consecutively underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) between 3/2004-3/2011. Patients were randomized to receiving Heparin (Group A) or 2fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)/day+Heparin (Group B). FFP administration during conditioning was based on our retrospective study in which FFP+Heparin reduced VOD, probably by minimizing the drop of natural anticoagulants post conditioning. AT/ProteinC levels were measured per week up to day 28. Patients with median age 36(5-68) years underwent autologous (n=152) or allogeneic (sibling=117, volun-teer=61, alternative=6) HCT from blood (n=315), bm (n=19) or cord blood (n=3) following mainly, myeloablative conditioning (292/336). The majority were transplanted at advanced disease and 24 patients twice. In groupA were randomized 164 and in groupB 172 patients with similar baseline characteristics. The cumulative VOD-incidence was 2% (7/336, severe:5/7, moderate:2/7), the VOD-associated mortality 57% and the day-100 mortality 70% (vs 6% in no-VOD patients, p<0.0001). Anti-VOD prophylaxis didn't infl uence VOD incidence (Group A:3/7, Group B:4/7). All patients with lethal VOD had more than one known risk factors. In Busulfan (BU)-conditioned patients, VOD-incidence was 50% (3/6) and 2.5% (3/119) with oral and iv administration respectively, without difference in VOD-induced mortality. Univariate analysis demonstrated signifi cant correlations between VOD and diagnosis, AT/ProteinC levels (d14 and 21), use of hepato-nephrotoxic drugs, baseline liver status, conditioning, mode of BU administration. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the allo-HCT (95%CI, OR:14.1, p=0.04 vs auto-HCT) and oral BU (95%CI, OR:75.4, p<0.001 vs iv BU) as factors signifi cantly associated with VOD. We observed signifi cant reduction in Alpha Tau /Prot-C levels as compared to baseline, both in VOD-(AT:d14-28/Prot-C:d21-28, p\u22640.03) and no-VODpatients (AT:d7-21/Prot-C:d0-21, p\u22640.00002). However, VODsubjects had lower Alpha Tau (d14-28) and Prot-C(d0-d28) values vs no-VOD individuals (p\u22640.02). Overall, the improved pharmacokinetics of iv BU leads to a dramatic decrease in VOD incidence. The drop of natural anticoagulants occurs independently of VOD and their higher reduction at VOD rather represents an epiphenomenon. Replenishment with FFP, although it may correct the anticoagulant values, it cannot stem the syndrome's progression.",

Patients and Methods:. This retrospective study was performed on a cohort of 38 patients consecutively receiving a matched related or unrelated donor allo HSCT after myeloablative conditioning in our centre between 2003-2011. All patients received post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine and short course methotrexate. The diagnostic criteria were in accordance with the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network consensus or the International Working Group consensus. Graft-versus-host disease, infections and cyclosporine toxicity were considered as possible triggers of TMA, if present at diagnosis or occurring at maximum 1 week prior to the onset of TMA. Results: Five years projected overall survival (p OS) for the whole studied cohort was 53.4 %. Four cases, representing 10.5 % of all patients, fulfi lled the diagnostic criteria for transplantassociated TMA. Median time of onset of TMA was 23 days post-transplant. Possible factors triggering TMA were cyclosporine toxicity in one case and sepsis in the other three cases. All patients with TMA developed renal impairment and three out of four developed neurological dysfunction. After diagnosis, cyclosporine was reduced or temporarily stopped. Treatment of TMA was supportive. One patient responded to treatment and is alive and disease-free at 39 months post-transplant. The other three patients died of multiorgan failure at a median time of 20 days after diagnosis of TMA. Conclusion: The incidence of transplant -related TMA was similar with that reported in literature although its assessment may be very diffi cult if other severe co-morbidities are present such as severe infections. In our patients TMA was associated with high mortality, only one patient responding to reduction of cyclosporine, confi rming the possible toxic cause for this complication.",

Kato (1) The activation of macrophages in the bone marrow early in the post-transplantation period, which often results in hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), is a previously unrecognized complication with a negative impact on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (AHSCT). We retrospectively analyzed the relationship between HPS and bacteremia/viremia after AHSCT, as well as its impact on subsequent outcome. We reviewed 71 consecutive patients who received AHSCT between July 2008 and July 2011 at our institution. Multiplex PCR was performed weekly from day 0 of AHSCT on all patients to detect a fi xed set of viruses. Diagnostic criteria of AHSCT-associated HPS are as follows; fulfi llment of two major criteria (histological evidence of bone marrow hemophagocytosis and impaired engraftment after AHSCT) or one major and all four minor criterion (high grade fever, hepato-splenomegaly, elevated ferritin, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase value). This study was approved by the institutional review board. The median age was 52 (range, 17-69) years. Diagnosis included myeloid malignancy (n=43), lymphoid malignancy (n=27), and benign hematologic disease (n=1). Stem cell sources were bone marrow (n=52), peripheral blood (n=8), and cord blood (n=11). 34 patients had high risk diseases. 39 patients received myeloablative conditioning regimens. HLA was matched in the Graft-versus-host direction in 44 patients. Among 71 patients, 8 developed HPS (HPS group) at a median of 21 days after AHSCT and died because of graft failure (n=2), thrombotic microangiopathy (n=2), infection (n=3), or intra cranial hemorrhage (n=1). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the development of HPS had a signifi cantly worse impact on day 100 survival after AHSCT. {HPS group 50 % and non-HPS group 89 %, p<0.01}. In the HPS group, 6 experienced viremia (4 with CMV, 2 with EBV) shortly before the occurrence of HPS. EBV was not detected in the non-HPS group. Although CMV viremia was also occasionally observed in the non-HPS group, the copy number of CMV detected was considerably higher in the HPS group. When background characteristics were statistically compared, only high-risk disease was associated with the development of HPS. The development of HPS considerably increased therapyrelated mortality and lowered day 100 survival. The development of HPS associated with high-risk disease and the reactivation of EBV or CMV may contribute to its development in a considerable proportion of patients. Objectives: The cause of late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis (LOHC) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has remained obscure. Methods: We limited our analyses to patients with advanced leukemia underwent a haploidentical HSCT and treated with ATG-contained regimens to defi ne the infl uence of different doses of ATG in conditioning on LOHC. Results: From January 2003 to February 2011, we enrolled 75 patients in this retrospective study. Thirty-nine patients transplanted before June 2008 were treated with high-dose ATG (10 mg/Kg), whereas subsequent 36 patients received low-dose ATG (6 mg/Kg) in conditioning. There was no signifi cant difference between the two groups in engraftment, survival, leukemia relapse and non-relapse mortality, GVHD and cytomegalovirus reactivation. However, LOHC occurred in the 16.7% of patients receiving low-dose ATG and 38.5% of patients receiving high-dose ATG (P=0.027). High-dose ATG in conditioning, male sex, early donor lymphocyte infusion and cytomegalovirus reactivation were signifi cant risk factors for LOHC. However, only the high-dose ATG in conditioning (HR 2.96, 95% CI 1.143-7.663, P=0.025) and male sex (HR 4.033, 95% CI 1.355-12.008, P=0.012) are independent risk factors on the multivariate analyses. Conclusion: LOHC was more prevalent in the male patients and recipients of high-dose ATG in conditioning in the setting of haploidentical HSCT.",

Methods: Consecutive HRCT scans of the chest in 45 pediatric HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms and/or suspicion for infection were scored by two independent radiologists for various airway and parenchyma abnormalities. Clinical diagnosis was established after the disease episode resolved by an expert physician who had access to all available information. Maximum disease severity during the disease episode was graded from 0 (asymptomatic) till 4 (death). Results: HRCT scoring was reproducible for the composite HRCT-score and all items, except airway wall and septa thickening. Abnormalities overlapped between infectious and non-infectious complications, but the severity score was signifi cantly higher in all allo-LS for HRCT-composite, HRCT-ground glass (only for early allo-LS), HRCT-bronchiectasis (late allo-LS) an HRCT-air trapping (late allo-LS) when compared to infectious disease. The composite HRCT-score predicted maximum disease severity, a 10-points (scale 0-100) increase in composite HRCT score corresponded to a severity score increase by 1.

Yakushijin (1) (1) (1)National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, JP); (2)Kyoto University (Kyoto, JP) Introduction: Although it is well known that hyperglycemia is common after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), its mechanism causing hyperglycemia is still to be determined, especially during the early phase after HSCT. To explore the cause of hyperglycemia, we prospectively monitored the glycemic status. Patients and Methods: From October 2008 to September 2009, a total of 90 patients who underwent HSCT (allogeneic n=79, autologous n=11) were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The target of glucose level was set from 80 to 150 mg/dL. The fasting glycemic status was monitored immediately before the conditioning regimen, at the day of HSCT, and weekly up to 1 month after HSCT. To assess the insulin resistance (IR), we used the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR, using the following formula: [fasting insulin (\u03bcU/mL) x fasting glucose (mg/dL)]/405. Results: Mean blood glucose level was 94, 109, 114, 121, 122, and 117 mg/dL, and mean serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI) level was 11.1, 25.4, 28.8, 30.3, 29.3, and 23 .1 \u03bcU/mL at pretransplant, day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. Serum C-peptide elevated at the day of HSCT compared to the baseline, and it decreased afterward even though glucose level serially elevated (mean serum C-peptide level was 2.5, 4.1, 2.9, 3.0, 2.5, and 2.2 ng/ml at pre-transplant, day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively). Mean HOMA-IR score was 2.6, 7. 5, 8.6, 9.9, 10.3 and 7 .5 at pre-transplant, day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. HOMA-IR signifi cantly elevated after HSCT, which was statistically higher after allogeneic HSCT compared to autologous HSCT at day 14 and day 21 ( Figure 1 ). Patients who received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after HSCT had signifi cantly higher HOMA-IR at day 7, day 14, day 21 and day 28 compared to those who did not receive TPN. There was a signifi cant correlation between C-reactive protein level and HOMA-IR at day 7, day 14, day 21 and day 28 (P<0.05). Patients who received myeloablative conditioning regimen had signifi cantly higher HOMA-IR at day 14 and day 21 compared to patients who received reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. Conclusions: Signifi cantly elevated IR was observed during the early phase after HSCT. Glucose level should be closely monitored after HSCT even if the patients don't have diabetes before transplant.",

            "text": "Background: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most common adverse events during treatment of patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM). However, there is still a paucity of reports on clinical courses and risk factors regarding PN. Methods: We previously performed KMM51 study using vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) followed by bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) and bortezomib consolidation for newly diagnosed MM (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00378755; Kim HJ, et al. Ann Hematol 2011). Using toxicity data of this study, we analyzed clinical courses of PN and risk factors related to PN. Results: A total of 71 pts were included. Median age was 57 (range, 31-64) years. The male to female ratio was 42: 29 (59.2%: 40.8%). Median follow-up duration was 52.0 (range, 3.5-63.0) months. Before study entry, pts with grade (Gr) \u22652 PN were excluded. Among 71 pts receiving VAD, Gr \u22652 PN developed in 5 pts (7.0%). Among 62 pts receiving VTD, 10 pts (16.1%) had a new-onset Gr \u22652 PN. After VTD, among 4 pts with Gr \u22652 PN induced by VAD, 3 pts maintained the same severity, and 1 pt became asymptomatic. Among 51 pts receiving auto-SCT, 3 pts (5.9%) had a new-onset Gr \u22652 PN. After auto-SCT, among 9 pts with pre-existing Gr \u22652 PN, 2 pts maintained the same severity, and 7 pts became asymptomatic. Among 42 pts receiving bortezomib consolidation, 3 pts (7.1%) had a new-onset Gr \u22652 PN. After bortezomib consolidation, among 5 pts with pre-existing Gr \u22652 PN, 1 pt maintained the same severity, and 4 pts became asymptomatic. In relation to VAD, pts with Gr \u22652 PN tended to have shorter overall survival (OS) (p=0.061; Figure 1 ). In relation to VTD, serum creatinine (Cr) \u22652.0 mg/dL at diagnosis was signifi cantly associated with Gr \u22653 PN (p=0.016). In addition, Gr \u2265;3 PN was signifi cantly associated with shorter OS (p=0.021; Figure 2 ) along with a tendency toward a shorter progression-free survival (p=0.162). However, Gr \u22653 PN did not infl uence complete remission (CR) and near CR rate (p=0.636). Conclusions: During KMM51 study, the incidence of PN was substantial although some of them were reversible. During VTD, serum Cr \u22652.0 mg/dL at diagnosis was signifi cantly associated with Gr \u22653 PN. Gr \u22653 PN during VTD resulting in treatment delay and dose modifi cation signifi cantly infl uenced the prognosis of pts.",

            "text": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation V. Schmidt, T. Prell, A. Treschl, A. Hochhaus, H. G. Sayer University Hospital (Jena, DE) Posterior reversible encephalopathy-syndrome (PRES) is a rare, but serious complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Even though PRES is clearly characterised by the rapid development of typical neurological symptoms together with specifi c fi ndings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), controversy about risk factors and therapeutic management is quite obvious. We retrospectively analysed data from 137 consecutive patients who underwent alloSCT in our department from January 2007 to August 2011 and identifi ed 5 patients with PRES (3.6%, age 23 to 59 years, 3 male, 2 female). In all cases PRES was diagnosed by MRI and occurred between day +6 and day +15 after alloSCT (mean day +11). Symptoms at presentation were altered level of consciousness (n=5), seizures (n=4), headache (n=4), visual disturbance (n=3), or paralysis (n=1). Disease stadium, conditioning regimen, stem cell source, age and gender seemed not to infl uence development of PRES. All patients received a GvHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine (CSA) together with low-dose methotrexate (n=3) or rabbit ATG (n=2). As additional risk factors we identifi ed a phase of hypertensive dysregulation and a systemic infl ammatory reaction in all patients preceding PRES. At the onset of PRES all patients received a 2nd line antibiotic therapy based on a carbapenem together with either a glycopeptide (n=3) or linezolide (n=2). None of the patients had signs of acute GvHD preceding PRES. In 3 patients immunsuppression with CSA was stopped immediately and after bridging with mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone the mTor inhibitor everolimus was commenced. Further applying an intensifi ed anti-hypertensive treatment PRES was completely reversible within a few days. Interestingly, in one patient PRES was also completely reversible after medical normalisation of blood pressure even though CSA was continued. One patient developed a systemic infl ammatory response syndrome and died after 3 weeks of intensive care treatment due to a multi-organ failure. In all patients with seizures the administration of levetiracetam was effective in preventing further seizures. Conclusion: Irrespective of hypertension and CSA, a systemic infl ammation and/or medication with a carbapenem might be an additional risk factor for PRES. Normalisation of blood pressure and switching the GvHD prophylaxis to the mTor inhibitor everolimus are recommended to treat PRES.",

Methods: To identify the occurrence, the spectrum and the risk factors inducing neurological diseases, we carried out a retrospective cohort study including 391 adult patients followed up after allogeneic HSCT. All patients were affected by oncohematological diseases and received transplantation between January 1997 and June 2011. One hundred nine patients received an in vivo T depletion by ATG or Alemtuzumab. Results: Encephalitis was documented in 18/391 patients (4,6%) and occurred as an early complication in 10/18 pts. The time-trend of encephalitis incidence is illustrated in Figure 1 , showing a fast increase since 2008. The percentage of patients receiving T depletion in the same period is also indicated. Vascular diseases were the most frequent causes of encephalitis (39%). Infectious encephalitis was reported in 11% of patients. Detected agents were represented by: CMV 1 pt; HHV6 1 pt; Aspergillus 2 pts, and Pseudomonas 1pt. Two patients developed a late toxic encephalic disease related to radiotherapy, one patient had a cerebral vasculitis and one a posterior reversible encephalopathy. The etiology of encephalitis was not identifi ed in 3 patients. Sixteen patient affected by encephalitis died, but encephalitis was the direct cause of death in only 13 patients. Univariate logistic regression models for potential risk factors identifi ed T-cell depletion (OR=7.5, p=0.001), time of transplant (3-year calendar periods of transplant, linear trend between 1997-2011) (OR=2.3, p=0.001) and unrelated donor (OR=3.5, p=0.001), as signifi cant risk factors. In multivariate logistic analysis including also disease status at transplantation, conditioning regimen and acute Graft versus Host Disease, T-depletion (OR=3.9, p=0.017) and time of transplant (OR=2.5, p= 0.002) were the only signifi cant risk factors for encephalitis. Conclusions: Our analysis confi rms a strong association between the use of in vivo T cell depletion and risk of encephalitis. Moreover, the increasing time-trend in incidence of encephalitis could be associated to a more frequent use of T depletion in our Centre in the last decade.",

Methods: This was a prospective observational study on patients admitted to a BMT unit at a comprehensive cancer center in Jordan between October 2010 and March 2011. ADRs were defi ned as \" any response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for the modifi cation of physiologic function \" .

Identifi ed ADRs were verifi ed by a BMT consultant physician. The ADRs were characterized according to medication involved, system affected, severity, and preventability. Myelosuppression was excluded since it was an anticipated and intended effect. The outcome of an ADR was determined based on the required management according to the Hartwig's severity assessment scale. Results: Over the 6-month period, there was a total of 118 admissions. Eighty-two of them were male patients (69.5%). The median age was 22 years (range 1-57 years). Total number of reported ADRs was 206.

The aim of the study was to analyze the organ related complications in early, up to 30 days post-transplant period in lymphoma pts and to explore pts' age impact on incidence and grade of adverse events. Methods: Between January 2005 and November 2011, 315 consecutive lymphoma pts underwent high dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantations (ASCT) (n=325). Median age of pts was 42 years (range 18-67). 44 pts were above 60 year old. Conditioning regimens were: BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) in 216, melphalan 200 in 64, CBV (carmustune, etoposide, cyclphosphamide) in 17, cytarabine, melphalan or cyclophosphamide -in 28 pts. 32% pts above 60 year had some comorbidities: in 71 % cardiovascular. Results: Early non hematologic complications within 30 days after ASCT were reported in 91% of pts. The most common event was neutropenic fever (70% of transplants) with septic shock in 1.9% of pts. Oral mucositis occurred in 54% of pts, with grade 3-4 in 27% of pts, 48% pts had diarrhea, 22% -abdominal pain. Prolonged, more than 7 days, nausea and vomiting occurred in 36% of pts. There was no difference in the incidence of early complications between younger (18-59 years) and older (above 60) patients (Table 1) . Median hospitalization for younger pts was 22 days (range 12-61) and 21 days (range 16-38, p>0,5) for older pts. There were no toxic deaths. Conclusions: HDT resulted in remarkable incidence of toxicity during early post-transplant period. The most common complications were: neutropenic fever, infections, oral mucositis and diarrhea. There was no difference in the incidence of toxic events between younger and older pts. Age and comorbidities did not increase the risk of serious adverse events in early posttransplant period.",

Williams, J. Murray, S. Kulkarni, A. Bloor Christie NHS Foundation Trust (Manchester, UK) There has been considerable recent interest in the use of comorbidity indices to risk stratify patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), although the optimal scoring system is unknown. The utility of the haematopoietic cell transplantation specifi c co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) is not clearly established. We report the results of using the HCT-CI in a single centre. 96 sequential patients transplanted during 2007-9 were included. Patient demographics, diagnosis and transplant procedures are summarised in Figure 1 . Co-morbidities were assessed according to the HCT-CI. Clinical evaluation and blood tests were available in all patients. Cardiac function results (echocardiogram/MUGA) were available in 95 of 96 patients; respiratory function results (assessed in specialist lung function laboratories) were available in 90 of 96. 50 of 96 (52%) are currently alive at a median follow-up of 24 months (range 1-56).

In univariate and multivariate analysis, underlying diagnosis was the most signifi cant determinant of post transplant outcome ( Figure 1 ). Patients referred for transplantation are highly selected, and typically have little clinical co-morbidity. Conventional co-morbidity indices are of limited value in risk stratifi cation. Inclusion of laboratory assessment of organ function appears to over estimate risk and as applied within the HCT-CI, did not increase the sensitivity of the analysis. In this series, the HCT-CI did not predict outcome following allo-SCT. This may be explained in part by differences in patient demographics and diagnosis compared to those used in the original series and questions its broad applicability.",

Gasior, K. Humala, R. Guerrero, I. Rivas, A. Marcos, R. Arrieta La Paz University Hospital (Madrid, ES) Objectives: To evaluate the infl uence of different types of ABO Incompatibility in transfusion requirements (TR) during the fi rst 2 months following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (AST) in patients diagnosed of Primary Immune Defi ciency (PID). Materials and Methods: Medical records of 21 patients aged from 2 months to 7 year-old diagnosed of PID treated with AST were reviewed restrospectively. The AST were conducted in our Centre between July 2001 and July 2011. Data about ABO Incompatibility and TR were collected. TR were studied as the ratio between the number of red blood cells (RBC) and platelets units transfused and the patient\u00b4s volemia during the fi rst 2 months following AST. Results: Stem cell sources were: Bone marrow in 7 patients (33,3%), Peripheral blood in 8 (38,1%) and cord blood in 6 (28,6%). 20 patients received Conditioning treatment and 13 patients received Graft versus Host Disease prophylaxis (the remaining 8 patients received T-cell-depleted AST through CD34+ selection). Nine out of the 21 patients received an ABO-incompatible AST, with major ABO-mismatch in 6 patients (28,6%) and minor ABO-mismatch in 3 patients (14,3%). The remaining 12 AST were ABO-compatible (57,1%). The mean TR were 1,39 (0,69-1,62) for RBC units and 2,78 (0-16,26) for platelets units. Mean TR for RBC units were 0,43 (0-0,76) in the major ABO-mismatch group, 1,35 (0,95-1,99) in minor ABOmismatch and 1,88 (0, in ABO-compatible group. Mean TR for platelets units were 1,52 (0-4,28) in major ABO-mismatch, 2,95 (0, 82) in minor ABO-mismatch and 3,36 (0, 26) for ABO-compatible AST. In our Centre, TR for ABO-incompatible-mismatch in non-PID patients were 0,52 for RBC units and 0,55 for platelets units, and TR for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant were 0,23 for RBC units and 0,18 for platelets units. Conclusion: Patients diagnosed of PID who receive AST present higher TR, independently of age and weight, than non-IPD patients. No clear relation with ABO-incompatibility was found. Aim: The disadvantages of a short course of methotrexate for GVHD prevention in allogeneic stem cell transplantation are mucositis and delayed hematologic recovery. We have omitted methotrexate infusion on day 11 posttransplant in patients that had severe mucositis or life-threatening infection after conditioning. The aim of this study is to know if this modifi cation may increase the risk of GVHD and lower the survival of those patients. Method: We analyzed the transplant outcomes comparatively between patients who received the full schedule of methotrexate (standard group) and patients who did not receive methotrexate on day 11 posttransplant because of severe mucositis or lifethreatening infection (modifi ed B). A total of 51 patients were enrolled. Twenty four patients were in the standard group and twenty seven were in the modifi ed group.",

Benakli, F. Mehdid, R. Belhadj, N. Rahmoune, M. Baazizi, D. Ait ouali, R.M Hamladji Pierre and Marie Curie Center (Algiers, DZ) Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantion (HSCT) patients often require blood and platelet support. Actually, the use of new reduced toxicity regimens conditioning with a shorter duration of aplasia may have an infl uence on the transfusions needs. In the ABO mismatched transplantation, the transfusion needs seems higher. This study is a review of transfusions needs during 12 years for 1123 procedures of allograft. Patients and Methods: Between March 1998 to December 2010, 1123 HSCT were performed in 1110 pts, (316 for nonmalignancy affection, and 794 for malignant disorders).The median age is 27 years (3-61)and sex-ratio:1,3. The type of conditioning regimen used is: myeloablative (MA) in 783 pts, reduced regimen (RIC) in 209 pts, reduced toxicity conditioning (RTC) in 110 pts. Blood transfusion concerned pts with a hemoglobin rate <7g/dl. For the platelets, the transfusion rate is <10.000/mm3 (pts without bleeding or fever). The stem cell sources were (PBSC:1077, bone marrow:53, cord blood:9). A cryopreservation of PBSC or depletion of erythrocytes in bone marrow were done in 217 cases (19,3%), for major ABO or RH mismatch. The median duration of the aplasia is 14 days (7-86), the median time to achieve HB>7g/dl is 15 days, in the case of major ABO incompatibility the duration of aplasia is longer, the median time to achieve HB>7g/dl is 85 days (7-338). Results: 2807 blood units (BU) for 711 pts (64%) and 2765 Platelet Concentrates (PC) for 901 pts (81,1%) were necessary, with a transfusion quotient (TQ) of 2,5 units/pt for both blood and platelets. The Blood needs looked higher in the (MA) procedures, 2740 BU with a TQ of 3,5 BU/pt were used versus only 38 BU with a TQ of 0,59 BU/pt in RIC (p=10-8), and just 29 BU, with a TQ of 0,8 BU/pt (p=10-8) in the RTC were used at least. In the particular case of a Major ABO mismatched between donor and recipient, the blood transfusion needs are also higher, the rate is about 6 BU/pt in (MA) regimen (p=10-9) versus 1,1 in RIC (p=10-8) and about 1,42 in RTC (p=10-8). For the use of the PC, in (MA) regimen the needs are higher than in RIC, with 2604 PC used with a TQ of 3,5/pt versus 24 PC with a TQ of 1,1 in RIC (p=10-8), but no differences are noted in platelets needs between (RTC) and (MA) regimen. Conclusion: The transfusion needs are clearly higher in myeloablatives procedures, they are also very important in the case of Major ABO mismatch. The blood group must be an important criteria for choosing the donor.",

Chalandon HUG (Geneva, CH) Aim: To analyze the outcome of two different rabbit polyclonal antilymphocyte globulins in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for hematological malignancies. Methods: In order to avoid cost containment measures we alternated between the 2 ATG sources (Thymoglobulin and ATG-F) in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. In this single-center retrospective analysis, we included 30 alloHSC recipients transplanted between 2007 and 2010, 15 patients received Thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg/day from day -5 to day -3 before transplant) and 15 received ATG-F (5 mg/kg/day from day -6 to day -2 before transplant). In addition the conditioning regimen consisted of busulphan and fl udarabine. We compared the incidence of adverse effects, graft failure, relapse, infection, graft versus host disease (GvHD), immune reconstitution and death. Results: The two groups were homogeneous. Median follow up was 29 months. Out of the 30 patients included, 15 in each group, a signifi cantly earlier relapse is noticed in the Thymoglobulin group (median time to relapse 91 days) compared to the ATG-F group (325 days) (p=0.01). This was not related with T-depletion neither with the number of cells in the add back of T cells. The number of relapse was similar in both groups. There was a tendency to show more adverse events during the Thymoglobulin perfusion than with that of ATG-F (p=0.14), less acute graft versus host disease grade II-IV (p=0.23) and an",

Engraftment was similar in both group, as well as rejection, infections after aplasia, CMV reactivation, secondary neoplasm and immune reconstitution. The OS, relapse incidence and TRM at 2 years were 60\u00b118%, 42\u00b120% and 26\u00b116% respectively for the entire population and there was no statistical difference between both groups. Conclusion: In patients with hematologic malignancies, conditioning with Thymoglobulin seems to be associated with a signifi cantly shorter time to relapse compared to the ATG-F group, and a tendency to die earlier and to present more perfusion adverse events, but less grade II-IV GVHD. The immunosuppressive power of Thymoglobulin seems to be greater than that of ATG-F. Background: Caphosol (a supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse) for oral care has been shown to decrease the incidence, severity and duration of oral mucositis (OM) caused by chemotherapy. (OM) leads to a higher incidence of fever, infections, opioid and antibiotic use and prolonged hospital stay. In the prospective OM audit (POMA study) autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) recipients received 200 mg/ M\u00b2 of melphalan (HDM) (1) . Recalculation of the given dose per kilogram bodyweight was the key factor determining OM incidence and severity. All patients that received \u2265 5.25 mg/kg melphalan besides standard oral care (OC) developed OM with 65% severe OM (WHO grade [3] [4] . Aim: To evaluate the prevention of severe OM with Caphosol in ASCT recipients receiving \u2265 5.25 mg/kg Melphalan. Method: A multicenter, observational prospective cohort audit was performed in 154 ASCT recipients treated with HDM (200 mg/M\u00b2) for multiple myeloma. Patients with melphalan \u22655.25 mg/kg after recalculation received standard OC and Caphosol 4 times daily. Patients with < 5.25 mg/kg melphalan received standard OC only. OM was assessed daily using the WHO oral toxicity scale (0-4) from day 1 of starting HDM in the fi rst 20 days afterwards. Neutropenic fever (defi ned as temperature > 38\u00b0C and a neutrophil count of < 0.5 109/L), time to neutrophil engraftment, duration of hospitalisation, concomitant medications and incidence of infections were also monitored. Results: 47 patients received actually \u2265 5.25 mg/kg melphalan and were ordered Caphosol treatment. The maximum mean WHO OM grade was not signifi cantly different of the group with standard OC only. The incidence of severe OM in the Caphosol group was only 45% in stead of expected incidence of 65% (POMA). Neutropenic fever occured in 25 patients in the Caphosol group (53%) and in 81 patients (76%) in the group with standard OC (p=0.0055). Conclusion: Caphosol is effective in prevention of (severe) OM and neutropenic fever in ASCT recipients after HDM. (1) Background: Early complications of vascular origin including hepatic SOS, TMA after HSCT remain serious problems. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of DIC. Recently successful treatment of hepatic SOS has been reported although in a small study. We report here results of retrospective analysis in a group of 67 patients (pts) who received rTM after HSCT. Patients and Methods: Enrolled in this study were children and adolescents with autologous and allogeneic HSCT who were treated with rTM. The data were collected retrospectively from 30 unselected Japanese centers that joined in the JPLSG. Pts were divided into 4 cohorts based on the aim of rTM, treatment of DIC (group 1), treatment of SOS (group 2), treatment of TMA (group 3), pre-emptive or prophylactic treatment of SOS/TMA (group 4). When indicated, rTM was given as a single daily infusion at a dose of 380 U/kg. Complete response (CR) was defined as resolution of each complication-related symptoms with the related laboratory fi ndings decrease to less than diagnostic range. Treatment failure was defi ned as either unable to obtain CR in treatment or newly development of each complication in pre-emptive or prophylactic treatment. Results: The median age at HSCT was 6.4 years (range, 0.6 to 18 years), 39 were male and 28 were female. The underlying diseases were ALL (22), AML (16), other malignancies (21), and nonmalignant disease (8). Thirty-six pts were in early stage (1CR or 2CR), 23 pts were in advanced stage (3CR or more). The donor was HLA-identical sibling in 7, other related in 15, unrelated BM in 14, unrelated CB in 20, autologous in 10, unknown in 1, respectively. Once daily administration of rTM was started between day +1 and day +96 (median day +10). Fifteen pts received rTM for the treatment of DIC, 21 pts for SOS, 16 pts for TMA, and 15 pts for pre-emptive treatment or prophylaxis. CR rate was 73% (11/15 pts) in group 1, 90% (19/21 pts) in group 2, 69% (11/16 pts) in group 3, respectively. Survival rate was 67% (10/15 pts) in group 1, 71% (19/21 pts), 63% (10/16 pts) in group 3, respectively. In group 4, 2 pts developed TMA, and 67% (10/15 pts) are surviving. Adverse event was recognized in 3 TMA pts. Conclusions: Although this study is a retrospective analysis about limited number of pts, rTM may be highly effective in early complications of vascular origin after HSCT, especially in hepatic SOS. Thrombocytopenia following chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (SCT) results in increased used of blood products and hospital resources, reduced quality of life and in general increased morbidity and mortality. Romiplostim (Rom) is a thrombopoietin analogue indicated for chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura as second line treatment in adults failing or not eligible to splenectomy. We report 3 cases of successful off-label use of Rom for chemotherapy or SCT related thrombocytopenia. A 68 years old female had unexplained failure of platelet (plt) recovery following autologous SCT (6.5x10 6 CD34/kg) for acute S210 myeloid leukemia. Despite receiving multiple platelet transfusions, her plt count remained <10x10 9 /L ( Figure) . Autoimmune thrombocytopenia was suspected, supported by the concomitant development of Guillen Barr\u00e8 syndrome. Standard therapy was ineffective including steroids, immunoglobulins (Ig), plasmaexchange (PEX), intravenous (iv) and intrabone (ib) autologous boosts. Because severe thrombocytopenia was limiting physiotherapy and therefore neurologic recovery, Rom was started at 1 mcg/kg escalated to 4 mcg/kg for a total of 4 weekly subcutaneous doses. Nine days after the last administration plt rose to 100x10 9 /L. Discontinuation resulted in reduction of plt count but further 0.5 mcg/kg monthly maintenance injections were successful in keeping plt >30x10 9 /L. A 68 years old male underwent unrelated SCT for high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Primary failure of platelet recovery occurred following hyperacute, acute and overlap chronic GVHD. Because of an important muco-cutanous hemorrhagic diathesis, Rom was initiated at 2 mcg/kg weekly. Injections were stopped after 2 months as plt counts reached 47x10 9 /L. Two months from Rom completion, plt continue to rise and are currently 100x10 9 /L. A 65 years old male affected by relapsed multiple myeloma was candidate to lenalidomide treatment but, in spite of disease response, he was unable to continue because of dose limiting thrombocytopenia. Rom was started at escalating doses of 1 mcg/kg to 4 mcg/kg. When plt reached 100x10 9 /L Rom was stopped. One month later, whilst continuing lenalidomide, plt dropped again but further injections were successful in allowing continuation of lenalidomide courses. In conclusion, in selected cases, Rom could be cautiously used to treat chemotherapy or transplant related thrombocytopenia. Early identifi cation of primary graft failure is essential to guide rescue strategies due to high mortality of prolonged aplasia. Two recent cases of primary graft failure received salvage T replete haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) at our Institution. A 62-year-old CMV+0+male received a volunteer unrelated donor (VUD) SCT for idiopathic JAK-2neg myelofi brosis with splenomegaly and transfusion related hemocromatosis (Figure) . Conditioning: Busulfan 12 mg/kg, Fludarabine (Flu) 160 mg/mq, ATG-thymo 5 mg/kg. Stem cell source: 5.3x10 6 CD34/kg peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) from a CMV-AB+ male, 10/10 HLA matched. Day 28 bone marrow (BM) showed aplasia with 0% donor chimerism (CMV/HSV6/parvo neg). The haplo 32 years old CMV-B-son underwent urgent mobilization. Conditioning: treosulfan (treo) 42 g/mq, Flu 150 mg/mq, ATG-F 30 mg/kg and Rituximab 500 mg. PBSCs: 8.02x10 6 /kg CD34+/kg, 2.1x10 8 CD3/kg. GvHD prophylaxis: MTX and rapamycin. Post transplant complications: BKvirus hemorrhagic cystitis and HHV6 viremia. Day 55 BM showed 100% donor chimerism. Because of poor graft function on day 83 an intra-bone boost of 1.37x10 6 /kg CD34+ donor PBSCs was given. Engraftment: neutrophil on day 70 post boost, plt on day 8. At 13 months follow-up the patient is in remission, with moderate de novo chronic GVHD. A 56-year-old pluriparous CMV+A+ female received a VUD SCT as upfront treatment for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Stem cell source: 8.3x10 6 CD34/kg PBSCs from a CMV+A+ male, mismatched at HLA-B and DPB1. Conditioning: Thiotepa 10 mg/kg, treo 42 g/mq, Flu 150 mg/mq, ATG-F 30 mg/kg and Rituximab 500 mg. Day 22 BM showed aplasia with 0% donor chimerism (CMV/HSV6/parvo neg). The haplo 18 yrs old CMV-A + son underwent urgent mobilization. Conditioning: Flu120mg/mq, ATG-thymo 15 mg/kg, Rituximab 600mg and TBI 2Gy. PBSC: 7.02 x10 6 CD34+/kg, 0.87x10 8 CD3/kg. GvHD prophylaxis: MTX and rapamycin. Engraftment: neutrophil >500/mcL on day 20 and plt >20,000/mcL on day 40. Post transplant complications: grade III febrile neutropenia, interstitial pulmonitis, acute pulmonary edema and CMV viremia. Day 30 BM showed 100% donor chimerism. At a 4 months follow-up the patient is in remission, without GVHD and off immunosoppression.",

Introduction: Complete protection from nausea/vomiting is currently achieved in a small number of patients (pts) receiving high-dose chemotherapy (HDC). Currently the use of 5-HT3antagonists and dexamethasone (Dexa) represent the standard of care. The role of the NK-1-antagonist aprepitant (Aprep) in HDC remains to be better defi ned; however, recently have been reported good responses with triple antiemetic combination (5-HT3-antagonists, Dexa and Aprep). This study describes the addition of Aprep to palonosetron with or without Dexa with the aim of preventing nausea and vomiting associated with HDC in autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) patients. Patients: We treated 14 pts (5 Non Hodgkin Lymphoma, 1 Hodgkin disease and 8 Multiple Myeloma (MM)). The pts with lymphoma underwent to HDC with BEAM (carmustine 300 mg/ m 2 on day -7, etoposide 200 mg/m 2 and cytarabine 400 mg/ m 2 on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and melphalan 140 mg/m 2 on day -2) and the pts with MM with Melphalan 200 mg/m 2 on day -1. The Aprep was used p.o. at a dose of 125 mg on day -7 and 80 mg on days -6, -5 in pts treated with BEAM and at a dose of 125 mg on day -1 and 80 mg on days 0 and +1 in pts treated with M200; the palonosetron was used at a dose of 250 \u03bcg on days -7 and -4 nei pts treated with BEAM and on day -1 nei pts treated with MEL200; the Dexa has been used only in pts treated with BEAM at a dose of 12 mg e.v. on day -7 and 8 mg e.v. in the remaining days of HDC. Results: Complete remission was defi ned as no emesis and no use of rescue therapy during day of HDC (acute phase) and until 5 days after the end of HDC (delayed phase). For the overall evaluation phase the primary end point of CR was achieved in 5 (36%) patients. For the acute phase, CR was achieved in 10 pts (71,4%). Delayed nausea (grade 1 according to WHO) was observed in 7 pts (50%) and delayed vomiting in 2 pts (14,3%).",

Thrombocytopenia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a common complication, but some patients present with secondary failure of platelet recovery (SFPR) defi ned as a decline of platelet counts below 20,000/\u03bcL for 7 consecutive days or requiring transfusion support after achieving sustained platelet counts \u226550,000/\u03bcL for 7 consecutive days after allo-SCT. We report on seven patients treated with Rm after allo-SCT for a SFPR not due to disease relapse. Our therapeutic strategy was to start Rm at 1\u03bcg/kg and to increase dose weekly until platelet count had reached 50,000/\u03bcL. Transplantations were performed between 2009 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range, 25 to 60).

There was a median time of 54 days (range, 24 to 84) between onset of Rm and the fi rst day when platelet count was >50,000/\u03bcL. Median duration of treatment was 13 weeks (range, 4 to 16). Rm was well tolerated and no patient needed to discontinue drug. Four patients developed SFPR within 2 months of developing acute GvHD II-IV. Two patients had an acute GvHD II-IV before and had 2 episodes of CMV or EBV infection. The last patient did not develop GvHD II-IV but had a CMV infection 1 month before SFPR. These observations underline the occurrence of SFPR shortly after episodes of acute GvHD II-IV, BOOP, EBV or CMV infections. At the last follow-up, one patient had died of a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia while others were alive, in remission without recurrence of SFPR after discontinuation of Rm. We conclude that Rm can be a therapeutic option after allo-SCT for patients with severe thrombocytopenia caused by SFPR. However, these preliminary data need to be confi rmed in larger studies with a longer follow-up time to improve assessment of effi cacy and safety profi les within this setting. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of trombopoetin receptor agonist romiplostim in patients (pts) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) who developed severe refractory thrombocytopenia due to posttransplant complications. Methods: To date 3 male pts with acute leukemia with median age 22,3 (18-30) years were included in the study. At the time of allo-HSCT one pt was in chemorefractory relapse and two pts in second complete remission (CR). After reduced intensity conditioning two pts received haploidentical bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and 1 pt received matched unrelated donor PBSC transplantation. Engraftment was achieved in the median of 17 days (12-21), full donor chimerism and CR were observed during follow-up period. Reconstitution of platelet count: \u226520x10 9 /l in the median of 14,6 days (12-19), \u2265100x10 9 /l in the median of 24,3 days (21-27). All pts developed thrombocytopenia due to persistent cytomegaloviral (CMV) infection, acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in the median of 64,6 days after allo-HSCT (range 38-80 days). All of them were treated with methylprednisolone 1mg/kg, gancyclovir 5-10 mg/kg, immunoglobulin 0,5 g/kg (2 pts), rituximab 375 mg/kg (1 pt) but remained profound thrombocytopenic (5-10X10 9 /l) and transfusion dependent with severe hemorrhagic complications in two cases. Romiplostim was administered in the initial dose 1 mkg/kg weekly with dose escalation to 4 mkg/kg (2 pts) and 5 mkg/kg (1 pt). Treatment period was 5 weeks (2 pts) and 8 week (1 pt). Results: In two weeks all pts achieved stabilization of platelet count \u2265 15x10 9 /l with transfusion independency and completion of bleeding. After 5 weeks of treatment platelet count was more than 30x10 9 /l, 50x10 9 /l and 150x10 9 /l accordingly. No romiplostim associated toxicity and recurrence of thrombocytopenia was observed during follow-up period. Conclusions: Using of romiplostim in pts after allo-HSCT who developed refractory thrombocytopenia due to TTP, CMV infection and aGVHD seems to be effective and well tolerated. The study is ongoing.

Urbano-Ispizua Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, ES) Aim: To analyse the clinical outcome of home care autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients older than 60 years diagnosed with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and Methods: At home ASCT (since day +1) was offered to patients with a good performance status, a travelling time to the hospital < 60 minutes, and a caregiver available 24h a day. The preparative regimen was administered in the hospital: BEAM for patients with lymphoma and melphalan 200 (MEL200) for patients with MM. All patients received prophylactic i.v. ceftriaxone once daily. The nurse visited the patient at home once or twice daily, while the physician in the hospital visited the patient only in case of clinical complications. Indications for re-admission to the hospital were: willingness of the patient or caregiver; uncontrolled nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea; mucositis requiring total parenteral nutrition or i.v. morphics; fever with focal infection or signs of severe sepsis. Results: 107 patients were included (73 received BEAM and 34 MEL200), with a median (range) age of 47 (17-67) years. Twenty-two (20%) of them were older than 60 years, median (range) of 64 (60-67), 11 BEAM and 11 MEL200. Main clinical outcomes are shown in the table. Whereas in the MEL200 group the age did not infl uence the degree of toxicity after ASCT, older patients receiving BEAM showed more prominent toxicity than younger patients treated with the same conditioning regimen. Thus, older lymphoma patients showed higher grade II-IV intestinal toxicity (64% vs. 14%, p=0.001), required two daily visits by nurses more frequently (82% vs. 45%, p=0.05), a more frequent need of physician visits (p=0.004), and more frequent readmission (45% vs. 13%, p=0.03).

Yeshurun Beilinson Hospital (Pethah Tikva, IL) Background: In pts with multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), induction therapy has evolved from chemotherapy-based therapy to novel agents-based regimens. Objectives: We aimed to compare HCT-associated toxicities in patients receiving combined chemotherapy and novel agentsbased treatment compared to those receiving novel agents only-based therapy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all charts of patients with multiple myeloma who were given induction therapy and HCT. Patients given combined regimen (dexamethasone, thalidomide, bortezomib cisplatinum, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide, DTPACE) were defi ned as DTPACE group. Patients given only novel agent-based regimens were defi ned as non-DTPACE group. Results: Between the years 2005 and 2011, 38 pts received DTPACE-based regimen and 31 pts were given non-DTPACEbased regimen prior to HCT. There was no statistically signifi cant difference between the two groups in patients' age, sex, percentage of patients with ISS>1, comorbidity index score (HCT-CI)>1 and disease status at HCT. Patients given DTPACE had a prolonged neutropenic period (mean, 7 vs. 6 days, respectively p=.0002) despite a higher mean CD34 cell transfused dose (6.5x10 6 vs. 4.7x10 6 , p=.06, respectively). Eight patients (12%) developed clinically documented infections and 11 patients (16%) developed microbiology documented infection (Gram negative bacteremia, n=5, Gram positive bacteremia, n=3, PCP infection, n=3). There was no difference in the incidence of fever or documented (clinically or microbiologic) infections and in blood or platelets transfusion rate between the two group. There was a trend for higher percentage of patients consuming morphine for severe mucositis in patients given DTPACE (35% vs. 13%, p=.07). One transplantation associated death (1.4%) was documented in the DTPACE arm. By landmark analysis the median time to next treatment was 38 months in the DTPACE group and was not reached in the non-DTPACE group (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.16-2.2, p=.3, Figure) . At 3-years post HCT, there was no difference in overall survival between the two groups (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.08-1.4, p=.2). Conclusions: Higher intensity induction chemotherapy has only a modest impact on HCT-associated morbidity. Longer follow up is warranted to determine its impact on time to next treatment and overall survival.",

Vogel, L. Kanz, W.A. Bethge Hematology & Oncology (T\u00fcbingen, DE) The prognosis in patients with relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is dismal. Salvage allogeneic HCT is one possible treatment option besides palliative care or donor lymphocyte infusions with or without chemotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed our experience with salvage HCT from 2000-2011 to further defi ne patients groups potentially benefi tting most from such approach. 47 patients (f=20, m=27) received more than 1 allogeneic HCT (2. HCT=44, 3. HCT=3). Median age of the patients was 40 (range, 18-65) years. Diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (n=28), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=11), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=2), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=2), osteomyelofi brosis (n=2), multiple myeloma (n=1), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=1). Reasons for salvage HCT were relapse (n=49) or primary graft failure (n=1). Median time between 1. and 2. HCT was 17 months (range, , between 2. and 3. HCT 12 months (range, 10-16). For the 2. HCT 16 patients received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and 31 reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). For the 3. HCT RIC was used in all patients. In 8 patients the same donor as for primary HCT was used while in 39 patients an alternative donor was chosen. Before salvage HCT 14 patients were in complete remission (CR), 33 in partial remission (PR). 12 of 47 patients (26%) after 2. HCT are alive (CR=11, PR=1) and 1 of 3 patients after 3. HCT is alive and in CR.",

Outcome was better for patients in CR at HCT (3-year OS with 43% vs. 24%, p=0.13). Older age had no negative impact on survival as 3-year OS in patients 40 years was 43% compared to 15% in patients <40 years (p=0.04). Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality at 3 years after 2. HCT was 43%. The use of RIC was associated with an inferior 3-year OS compared to MAC (18% vs. 53%, p=0.08). Outcome was inferior if the 2. HCT was within 6 months after 1. HCT (3- year OS of 0% vs. 31%, p=0.02). Incidence of grade II-IV graft-versus host disease (GVHD) was 17%, of chronic GVHD 30%. cGVHD after 2. allo HCT was associated with better survival vs. 26%, p=0.31) especially after RIC (33% vs. 11%, p=0.09). Salvage HCT after failing primary HCT is feasible and can achieve long term disease free survival in up to a third of patients. It appears to be the most promising salvage strategy besides DLI for relapse >6 months after HCT. Background: Primary or secondary graft failure after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still a major problem in patients affected by SAA, and a second allograft is often a needed alternative. We analyzed retrospectively the outcome of the second HSCTs recorded in the EBMT Registry from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2009. Patients and Methods: 63 SAA-patients who underwent a second unrelated HSCT for primary or secondary graft failure were the case-patients (pts). 120 SAA-pts who received a second related matched HSCT in the same period were the control group. Results: Related and unrelated HSCT group presented the following characteristics: median age at second HSCT 21.9 y (range 1.5-64.6) vs 20.3 y (range 4.4-56.3); myeloablative conditioning regimen: 23 pts (36,5%) vs 55 pts (45.8%); RIC conditioning regimen: 26 pts (41.3%) vs 44 pts (36.7%); TBIconditioning regimen: 22% pts vs 17.5% pts. Stem cell source was peripheral blood in 38 pts (60%), bone marrow in 15 pts (24%) and cord blood in 10 pts (16%). Neutrophils engraftment was achieved in 42/63 (67%) of case-pts and in 88/120 (73%) of control-pts. Graft failure/rejection was 25% in the case-group and 28% in the control cohort. Grade I-II, grade III-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 35%, 6% and 21% in casegroup vs 20%, 7.5%, and 17.5% in control-group. The main causes of death were infections and GVHD. Overall TRM and 100 day-TRM were 32% and 24% vs 29% and 14%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2.9 y (range 0.2-9.5) for case-group and of 3.5 y (range 0.2-10.6) for control-group, no difference in OS was found: 50% vs 61% (p=.3). OS was similar for related and matched unrelated donor (62.1% vs 60.8%), whereas a lower OS was found with a mismatched unrelated donor: 35%, H.R. 2.21 (CI 95%, 1.21-4.03). In univariate analysis, a longer interval from fi rst to second transplant (> the median time of 119 days) and the use of myeloablative regimen were associated to a better outcome, OS being 74% and 67% vs 39% and 50%, p<.01. In the subgroup of unrelated HSCT, OS was infl uenced by HLA match (matched vs mismatched: 60.8 vs 34.6, p=.017) and by the intensity of conditioning regimen (myeloablative vs RIC: 78.2% vs 16.4% (p=.0013). Conclusion: second HSCT in SAA-pts has a comparable outcome both with an unrelated and a related donor. The factors associated to OS were HLA match, intensity of conditioning regimen and interval between 1st and 2nd transplant. Two types of graft rejection can occur following allo-BMT: primary graft failure (PGF) where there is no evidence of recovery of donor cells beyond D+21, and secondary graft failure (SGF) associated with loss of donor chimerism after achieving primary engraftment. On the other hand, SGF can be separated in: autologous recovery (AR) where the recovery of host hematopoiesis can only be determined if sequential chimerism studies are undertaken; or in late graft failure (LGF) where definitive pancytopenia occurs with progressive mixed chimerism without subsequent autologous rescue. AR and LGF seems to be different complications with different outcomes. Here, we describe the incidences of AR and LGF of 62 SAA patients transplanted between 1992 and 2011 at HCFMRP. Sequential chimerism was done at D+100, +180, +360 in the fi rst year of transplant, annually after the fi rst year until fi ve years, and in hematological situations where a relapse was suspected. Chimerism was determined by cytogenetics, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), or blood group serology. Four patients developed AR. Tow of them achieved AR after treatment with CSA + prednisone, other followed treatment with GAL + CSA and the other one did not needed any treatment since he never developed hematologic recurrence (the AR was detected only by the chimerism study in this patient). All four patients are alive and without signs of aplastic anemia 5854, 3209, 4589 and 2133 days after the transplantation respectively. Six patients developed LGF. Tree of them died of sepsis despite the use of CSA + prednisone (two patients) or second transplant with the same donor (one patient). The tree remaining are alive. One of them was treated with a second transplant, other with a bust of donor's peripheral CD34+ cells mobilized with GCS-F and infused without manipulation, and the other with GAL + CSA. These tree treated patients had allo rescue after that treatments. Five of the 62 transplanted patients died of sepsis without engraftment before D+21. None of the 57 patients that survived beyond D+21 coursed with PGF. The incidence of AR and LGF were 7% and 10% respectively. The incidence of AR and LGF, in this Brazilian cohort of SAA transplanted patients was higher them that found by Piccin A, et al 2010, in a European cohort of SAA transplanted patients (45 with AR and 20 with LGF in a total of 1270 without PGF -incidence of 3.5% and 1.5% respectively). How this difference is signifi cant or a due to chance is not possible to answer with our data.",

George, V. Mathews, R. Ahmed, A. Abraham, A. Srivastava Christian Medical College (Vellore, Tamilnadu, IN) Between January 2004 and June 2011, 105 patients (68 men and 37 women) with a median age of 20 years (range: 2-53) with SAA underwent related HLA identical stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The conditioning regimen consisted of Fludarabine (180 mg/m 2 over 6 days), Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg over 2 days) + Anti-thymocyte globulin (40 mg/kg over 4 days). Cyclosporine with mini methotrexate was used for GVHD prophylaxis. Graft source included peripheral blood stem cells (96) or G-CSF stimulated bone marrow (9) . One hundred patients engrafted (95.2%) at a median time to neutrophil engraftment of 13 days (range: 8-19) and platelet engraftment of 11 days (range: 7-28). The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 24% with grade III-IV GVHD in 12% and Grade IV GVHD in 6%. Majority of the patients with grade III-IV GVHD required second line therapy for steroid refractory GVHD. Chronic GVHD occurred in 42% of evaluable patients with equal numbers having limited or extensive chronic GVHD. The 3 year overall survival is 79.1 + 2.3 % with a survival of 90 + 3.6% in patients without GVHD and 63.5 + 10.1% in patients with GVHD. Though the incidence of acute GVHD is not very high with the use of fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide as the conditioning regimen, it still has an adverse impact on survival. Strategies to reduce the incidence of GVHD need to be explored in prospective trials. Background: Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHSCT) from matched sibling donor (MSD) is the therapy of choice for children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), although graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or graft rejection remain the major concerns. Children with SAA who lack a MSD and fail to respond to immunosuppressive (IS) treatment should be considered for alternative donor such as from manipulated haploidentical parents. We present a case of child with SAA complicated with lung aspergillosis, treated with haploidentical HSCT (HHCST) with TCR alpha/beta (TCR-a/b) and B cell depletion. Methods: A 4-year-old female with SAA not responded to IS treatment, presented persistent fever due to lung aspergillosis. In the absence of MSD and prompt available alternative donor, she was subjected to HHCST TCRa/b and B depleted cell from maternal PBSC, using immunomagnetic separation with Clini-MACS System (Miltenyi Biotec). Depletion of a/b T cells was 4.5 log. The recovery of CD34+ was 74.6%.The number of infused CD34+,TCRa/b,TCRgamma/delta(TCRg/d) and CD20+ was 11.6X10(6)/kg, 25,092/Kg, 2.57X10(6)/kg, 38,596/kg respectively. Myeloablative conditioning regimen (MCR) included thiotepa (TT) and cyclophosphamide (Cy). IS prophylaxis consisted of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) and ciclosporin (CsA) (1 mg/Kg i.v. from day -6 to day -1). Despite initial engraftment of absolute neutrophilis count (ANC) and platelets (PLTs) (day +12 and +15 respectively), graft rejection occurred at day +20. After 38 days, a second HHCST TCRa/b and B depleted cell from paternal PBSC was performed. Depletion of a/b T cells was 3.85 log. The recovery of CD34+ was 88.6%. The number of infused CD34+, TCRa/b, TCRg/d and CD20+ was 19.3X10(6)/ kg, 94,313/Kg, 5.9X10(6)/kg, 106,000/kg respectively. MCR included TT, Cy and total nodal irradiation. rATG and CsA (3 mg/Kg i.v. from day -6) were used as IS prophylaxis. Results: Stable ANC and PLTs engraftment occurred from day +14, with clinical and radiological improvement. Mild acute GvHD on the gut occurred at day +30, with complete response to CsA that is gradually tapering. CMV reactivation was controlled with antiviral therapy. Five months later, our patient is still in good clinical conditions with complete donor engraftment and immune reconstitution. Conclusion: HHCST TCRa/b and B depleted cell is feasible in patients with SAA, due to quick engraftment, reduction of GvHD without impairing pathogen-specifi c immunity and prompt availability of the donor.",

A single-centre experience P. Gasperini, R. Masetti, D. Zama, F. Vendemini, A. Pession, A. Prete Lalla Ser\u00e0gnoli, University of Bologna (Bologna, IT) Objectives: In children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donor (UD-HSCT), treatment-related mortality (TRM) and rejection are major cause of failure. Best results were obtained in patients (pts) receiving HSCT from matched sibling donors (MSD); but because of the frequent unavailability of MSD and the controversial results of immunosuppressive treatment (IST), UD-HSCT is increasingly used. The technique of short tandem repeat (STR), allows better monitoring of the transplant and early intervention in cases at risk of rejection. This study evaluates the outcome of 10 children with SAA undergoing to UD-HSCT after reduced intensity regimen (RIC) based on Fludarabine (FLU), Cyclophosphamide (CY) and ATG. Methods: Between 1997 and 2010, 10 pts (4 M), median age 10 y, with SAA underwent HSCT from UD after failure of 2 courses of IST. The median interval between diagnosis and HSCT was 24 months. The source of HSCs was bone marrow in 8 and peripheral blood 2. 6/10 was full match donors, while 4 were mis-matched in 1 or more loci. RIC consisted of FLU 120 mg/kg, CY 1200 mg/kg, ATG 15 mg/sqm in 9/10 cases. In 2 case was added 200 cGy Total Body Irradiation. Prophylaxis of aGVHD was made with Cyclosporine (1 mg/kg/die iv from day -5, 2 mg/kg/die iv from day -1, 6-10 mg/kg/die orally for at least 6 months) and short term Methotrexate. Pts received a median of 5.7x10 8 /kg BM mononucleated cells or 7x10 6 /kg CD34+ PBSC. The study of complete or mixed chimerism (CC or MC), was performed on BM using STR-PCR technique from the day of take and then every 3 months. Results: All pts had an initial granulocyte and platelet engraftment, after a median time of 14 and 23 days respectively. There was one case of secondary graft failure with subsequent autologous reconstruction. aGVHD occurred in 2 cases (1 grade II and 1 grade IV) (22%); 4 pts (40%) had a limited chronic GVHD. After a mean follow up of 6.5 years, 9/10 pts are alive and disease free and 8/9 are carriers of CC. The patient who presented secondary graft failure is alive, with a state of MC with autologous prevalence and transfusion independent. One patient died because of grade IV aGVHD. Conclusion: UD-HSCT in SAA can be currently considered an effective and low toxic procedure even in children. A careful selection of the donor, a low toxic RIC regimen and a high number of infused HSCs can favorably affect the outcome.",

Mistrik University Hospital (Bratislava, SK) Aim: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonal hematopoetic stem cell disease which can lead to life-threatening complications including intravascular hemolysis, thrombotic events and kidney disease. Improvements in understanding and utilization of high sensitivity diagnostic tests and availability of targeted terminal complement blockade treatment have led to improved awareness and prognosis of PNH. Patients and Methods: We present data from 6 patients (pts) with PNH who underwent hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2001-2011: 4 from match HLA-identical sibling and 2 from matched unrelated donor (MUD). Median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 19 (1-95) months. Indication for allogeneic HSCT was aplastic/hypoplastic bone marrow (2/6 pts), severe course of PNH with hemolytic crisis and/or thrombosis (5/6 pts), transfusion dependency (6/6 pts). Conditioning regimen included total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (CY 60 mg/kg 2 days) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in 3 pts, fl udarabine (FLU 30 mg/m 2 for 4 days) and busulfan (BU 4 mg/kg 2 days) in 1 pt. Before MUD HSCT conditioning regimen contained FLU 30 mg/m 2 , BU 4 mg/kg 2 days and ATG (2 pts). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was provided by combination of methotrexate (MTX) + cyclosporin A (CsA) in 5 patients, in 1 patient was MTX replaced with mycophenolate mofetil because of serious gastrointestinal complications. Source of stem cells were dominantly peripheral blood stem cells (5 patients) with median 7.4x10 8 nuclear cells/kg (1.6-12.3) and 5.2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (3.6-5.8).",

More and more patients receive fl udarabine-based conditioning regimen without TBI in these days for reducing toxicities of TBI especially in case of UD and elderly patients. We retrospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of alloHSCT from UD without TBI and compared fl udarabine-based (fl udarabine group) and cyclophosphamide-ATG (non-fl udarabine group) conditioning regimen. Total 62 patients had received non-TBI conditioning regimen for alloHSCT from UD. Male were 53.2% and 80.6% received immune suppression therapy (IST) prior to alloHSCT. Half patients received alloHSCT from HLA full matching donor. Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 200 mg/kg and fl udarabine were used for conditioning in 45.2% and 53.2% patients. The median age at alloHSCT was 24.4 (range 14.2-63.6) years. Gender, prior IST, HLA full matching, ABO compatibility and stem cell source were not different between fl udarabine group and non-fl udarabine group. Cy 200 mg/kg (p<0.001) and horse ATG (p=0.002) were mostly used in non-Fludarabine group.

            "text": "Background: The hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) microenvironment consists of osteoblastic and vascular niches. During normal hematopoiesis, early hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are located in the osteoblastic niches, whereas the more mature, proliferating, and migrating HSC are located in the vascular niches. Alterations of theses cellular components are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia (AA). The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics of the cellular components of the BM microenvironment in AA patients and normal controls (NC). Methods: We performed immunohistochemistry for osteopontin, osteonectin, osteocalcin, nestin, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1, CXCL12), lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD56), macrophages (CD169) and mast cells, as well as hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (CD34, CD117) and megakaryocytes, on BM biopsy specimens from 10 AA patients and 10 NC (lymphomas without BM involvement). Cells positive for all the markers except osteocalcin were counted in 10 high power fi elds (\u00d7400, HPF), and their averages per HPF were calculated. Cells positive for osteocalcin were counted on the peritrabecular line on each slide, and corrected by the mean length measured. Results: The numbers of CD34+ cells, CD117+ cells, and megakaryocytes were signifi cantly lower in the AA than in the NC samples. On the other hand, the numbers of osteopontin+, nestin+, sdf-1+, CD56+ and CD169+ cells were signifi cantly higher in the AA samples. There were signifi cant positive correlations between the number of CD34+ cells and the number of nestin+ and of sdf-1+ cells in the AA samples, but not in the NC samples. However, there were non-signifi cant tendencies for negative correlations between the number of CD117+ cells and the number of nestin+ cells and of sdf-1+ cells in the AA samples. Conclusions: Higher numbers of mesenchymal stromal cell components in the BM niches in AA may promote the retention and quiescence of HSCs. In addition, they may contribute to reducing the numbers of more mature, proliferating progenitors by inhibiting entry into the cell cycle.",

Among 84 screened patients, 80 patients confi rmed as having acquired AA, and 84 age and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed consecutively. We genotyped 10 polymorphisms in three cytokine genes (IFNG, TNF, and TGFB1) and FAS gene. We assessed the association between polymorphisms and AA risk, and the association between polymorphisms and response to IST in three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive). The IFNG -2353 T allele (dominant model, OR=0.43, p=.012) and TCA haplotype (dominant model, OR=0.50, p=.038) were signifi cantly associated with the development of AA. In addition, this relevant IFNG -2353 T allele and TCA haplotype were related to the response of IST (dominant model, OR=0.076, p=.034). Concerning TGFB1, although its polymorphisms are not related to AA susceptibility, P10L T allele (recessive model, OR=0.18, p=.038) and CT haplotype (dominant model, OR=5.68, p=.038) were associated with response to IST.",

In addition, it was found that polymorphisms in IFNG and TGFB1 are associated with response to IST. Further studies in other population by a larger prospective design are needed to better elucidate the determinants of risk of AA and responsiveness to IST. Background: In the last decade, several studies have reported an improved outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a voluntary unrelated donor (VUD) in patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA). This has led to a marked increase in the utilization of unrelated donor transplantation for patients with marrow failure. However, despite these recent results, the decision to transplant patients who are refractory to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with VUD remains diffi cult, the alternative being repeated courses of IST that may be benefi cial. In this study, we aimed to shed light on the question of the utility of unrelated HSCT by comparing the outcome of patients with or without a VUD identifi ed. Methods: We conducted a multicenter donor versus no-donor comparison in 249 pediatric and adult patients with acquired SAA qualifying for a VUD search through the French and Italian donor registries over the 1994-2005 period. In median, the recipient age at diagnosis of SAA was 16 years (range=0-61) and the time interval between diagnosis and donor search initiation was 6 months (range=0-190). HLA matching was defi ned on low-resolution typing for HLA-A and B class I antigens and highresolution DNA testing for HLA-DRB1. Results: Comparing 161 patients in whom a HLA-A, -B and -DR matched donor was identifi ed with 88 patients without such a donor, we show no difference in survival with a median followup of 4.3 years from donor search initiation. However, among 179 patients who received IST using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), those who were 17 year-old or younger at the time of VUD search initiation had a survival benefi t when belonging to the donor group (4-year probability of survival from donor search initiation = 79% \u00b1 6% vs 53% \u00b1 10% for the no-donor group, p=0.01). In the same ATG-treated patients (pediatric and adult), the donor group also showed a survival advantage when donor search was initiated within the more recent 2000-2005 study period (4-year survival = 74% \u00b1 6% vs 47% \u00b1 10%, p<0.05). Conclusion: HSCT from an HLA-matched VUD offers a better survival than alternative options in several subgroups of ATGtreated SAA patients. This fi rstly confi rms, in an intent-to-treat manner, the conclusion of a previous prospective study conducted in children with ATG-refractory SAA. It also suggests that, in the more recent period, unrelated donor HSCT would be the best option in ATG-treated patients independently of their age.",

A second HSCT may be the only therapeutic option. We aimed to report associated complications and overall survival. Patients and Methods: Data on patients who suffered from EF or GR after a 1st HSCT, and who underwent a second HLA -matched related HSCT between April 1999 and December 2010 were recorded. Results: Twenty one patients underwent a 2nd HSCT. Diagnosis was acquired aplastic anemia in 12 patients, Fanconi anemia (FA) in 3 patients, acute leukemia in 1 patient and supposed FA which was not confi rmed thereafter in 5 patients. All received bone marrow (BM) graft for the 1st transplant. The 2nd HSCT was performed for EF in 5 patients and for GR in 16 patients. The median time between the fi rst and the second HSCT was 11 months (1.75-68). The conditioning regimens used were Cyclophosphamide200-ATGAM90 (n=13) Cyclo-phosphamide100-ATGAM90 (n=3) and fl udarabine containing regimens (n=4). One patient was not conditioned. Seventeen patients received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts and four BM grafts from the same donors. The median number of CD 34+ PBSC/kg was 4.5 x10 6 (1.65-10x10 6 ). Twenty patients engrafted (95.2%). One patient died on day 0 of the 2nd transplant from DMSO toxicity and was not assessable for engraftment. Graft rejection occurred in 2 patients, respectively on day 30 and day 75 post 2nd transplant and was followed by death from invasive sinusal aspergillosis on day 171 in the 2nd patient. Grade IV acute GVHD occurred in 2 patients and induced death in one of them on day 80. Extensive cGVHD occured in 1 patient after 21 months from transplant. Toxicity related mortality was 14%. After a median follow-up of 50 months (0-138) after 2nd transplant, 18 patients (86%) are alive with a good performans status and a normal blood count. Conclusion: As it is relatively safe and it offers a real chance to cure, 2nd allogeneic HSCT should be offered to patients who don't engraft or who reject their fi rst graft.",

Ibrahim, O. Chamdine, N. Yassine, A. Mugharbil, T. Jisr Makassed Hospital (Beirut, LB) Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only curative treatment for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). The main goal of BMT in SAA is to achieve successful engraftment without major complications particularly graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Radiation therapy (TBI or TN1) promoted effi cient engraftment in SAA but was associated with late toxicity and secondary malignancies. Presently, the combination of Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG) and Cyclophosphamide (Cy) given at the total dose of 200 mg/kg is considered the standard conditioning regimen for SAA in the setting of matched related BMT. Because the administration of ATG is associated with signifi cant major side effects and due to its prohibitive cost, ATG had been replaced by Fludarabine (Flu) for immunoablation/ lymphoablation in combination with Cy given at the total dose of 200 mg/kg. We report the experience of our BMT Unit in the use of Flu/Cy: Flu (120 mg/m 2 ) in combination with Cy given at lower total dose (120 mg/kg) in matched related BMT for SAA. Between 1/2009 and 10/2010, 4 patients (pts) who met the criteria of acquired SAA underwent BMT. Median age was 20 years (9-58). There were 3 females and one male. All the pts were treatment na\u00efve. Median time from diagnosis to BMT was 8 months (m) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Conditioning regimen included Flu: 30 mg/m 2 /d for 4 days (-7, -6, -5, -4) and Cy: 60 mg/kg/d for 2 days (-3, -2). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of Ciclosporin and Methotrexate (15 mg/m 2 on d+1, 10 mg/m 2 on d+3 and d+6). Ciclosporin tapering was started on d+120 using 10% dose reduction every 2 weeks. Stem cell source was unmanipulated bone marrow in all pts. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 2.81x106/kg (1.83-6.8). Engraftment was obtained in all pts. The median time for engraftment of neutrophils and platelets was 16 days (12-25) and 18 days (15-22), respectively. All pts maintained donor chimerism which was evaluated using probes specifi c for polymorphic DNA sequence (short tandem repeats). Only one patient (pt) developed a grade 3 mucositis. Febrile neutropenia occurred in all pts. Two pts developed a positive CMV antigenemia in blood successfully treated with ganciclovir. Acute grade 3 GVHD occurred in one pt and was steroids sensitive. All the 4 pts are alive with no evidence of disease at 14m+, 18m+, 20m+ and 35m+ respectively. Flu (120 mg/m 2 )/Cy (120mg/kg) was a well tolerated conditioning regimen with no rejection. However, this needs to be validated in larger series.",

Phase I data suggested CY dose 150 mg/kg as the optimal dose level for Phase II testing. However, after an additional eight patients were treated at this dose, the level was closed to further accrual due to excess toxicity. Seven of the 14 patients receiving 150 mg/kg of CY (and 7 of the last 8 enrolled) died. Causes of death were (multi)organ failure (n=4), ARDS (n=2), and viral pneumonia (n=1). Bayesian evaluation of the two remaining dose levels indicates similar desirability scores, hence accrual continues at both the CY 100 and 50 mg/kg levels. As of November 15, 2011, sixty-four patients have been enrolled, 17 on the two closed levels, 35 and 12 on the 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg levels, respectively. Conclusions: Early analysis of this trial, prompted by these unexpected adverse events, revealed two important fi ndings: 1) CY dose 0 mg/kg is associated with higher than expected graft failure; and, 2) CY dose 150 mg/kg is associated with excess transplant-related toxicity. To date, CY dose levels 100 and 50 mg/kg have not crossed the graft failure or fatality stopping boundaries and accrual continues. Introduction: Aquired aplastic anemia (AA) is characterized by pancytopenia with a hypocellular, often\"empty'' bone marrow. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) cures AA. We report our experiment of this procedure with retrospective comparative study between two myeloablative conditioning regimen (MCR) protocols. Materials and Methods: From may 1998 to june 2011, 196 patients (pts) with AA underwent myeloablative allogeneic HSCT from identical sibling donors. Two MCR protocols were used: association of cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m 2 , procarbazine 37,5 mg/Kg and ATG (Fresenius) 40 mg/kg (C1) for 97 pts (from may 1998 to february 2007), cyclophosphamide alone 200 mg/ m 2 (C2) for 99 pts (from may 2007 to june 2011). The median age of C1 and C2 pts is 19 years (5,5 to 40) and 21,7 years (4 to 40) (p= 0, 9) , the sex ratio 2,2 and 1,25 (p= 0,02) and AA was found idiopathic in 81 pts (83,5%) and in 66 pts (66,6%) (p<0,0001) respectively. Interval diagnosis was the same for C1 and C2 group with 11,6 months (1 to 114) and 11,7 (1 to 196) respectively. Multitransfused pts in C1 group (52 pts; 53,6%) was superior than C2 group (18 pts; 18,1%) (p<0,001). The grafts used an peripheral blood stem cells (C1: 88, C2: 99) and bone marrow (C1: 9). All pts had ciclosporine and short course of methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. At December 2011 maximal follow-up is 163 months for C1 and 55 months for C2, and minimal 56 months and 6 months respectively. Results: The time to engrafment is no different for the two groups with a median of 13,9 days (8 to 30) (p=0,5). At December 2011, 68 C1 pts (70,1%) and 84 C2 pts (85%) are alive with a median follow-up of 87 months (56 to 158) and 26 months (6 to 55) respectively. The incidence of acute GVHD is a same for C1 and C2 groups (p=0,68) with 20 pts (24,6%) and 20 pts (21,2%) respectively and the incidence of chronic GVHD was also the same (p=0,68) with 21 pts (29,3%) and 22 pts (25,5%) respectively. The transplant related mortality was observed in 26 C1 pts (26,8%) and 11 C2 pts (11,1%) with signifi cant difference (p<0,001). The incidence of graft failure was identical in the 2 groups, 6 C1 pts (6,2%) and 6 C2 pts (6,1%) (p=0,74). The overall survival (OS) is 64,9% at 13 years, 77,1% at 60 months for C1 group and 82,3% at 60 months for C2 group (p=0,02).",

Ghavamzadeh Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of HSCT in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) and severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 58 patients with FA (34 male and 24 female) and 41 patients with SAA (27 male and 14 female) who had undergone allo-HSCT between June 1992 and November 2011 in our institution. The patients included in this review were under 15 years. The median age at transplantation was 8 years in FA patients and 11 years in SAA patients. FA patients received fl udarabine-based or low dose busulfan-based conditioning regimen and SAA patients received cyclophosphamide plus antithymocyte globulin as conditioning regimen. No radiation therapy was given. Ninety patients received transplants from HLA-matched donors (73 from sibling and 17 from other related donors) and six from one-antigen locus mismatched donor. Moreover, three patients received cord blood stem cell from partially matched unrelated donor. Cyclosporine \u00b1 methotrexate was used as Graft-versushost disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Results: The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (range, 7-41 days) in FA and 13 days (5-22 days) in SAA. The median time to platelet engraftment was 18 days (range, 9-79 days) in FA and 21 days (13-86 days) in SAA. At a median follow-up of 13 months, OS and DFS were 65.2% (SE=6.3%) and 65.6% (SE=7.2%), respectively in FA patients. Seventeen deaths occurred among FA patients. Five SAA patients died at a median follow-up of 47 months. The OS and DFS in SAA patients were 89.8 (SE=4.8%) and 75.9% (SE=7.2%), respectively. The most common causes of death in FA patients were relapse (n=4), graft-versus-host disease (GvHD, n=3) and infection (n=3). Among the patients with SAA, 2 deaths were attributable to infection and one died of GvHD. Thirty nine patients developed acute GVHD in FA and 22 in SAA. Conclusion: Our good results in SAA patients are comparable in many respects with the results of other studies. Although the outcome obtained from FA patients was not as good as outcome of previous studies, the results have been improved since March 2007. Evaluation of mutations in Fanconi anemia genes among Iranians and their effects on HSCT outcome can help to improve the transplantation outcome. Objective: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) still represents the only option able to defi nitively cure the marrow failure associated with Fanconi anemia (FA). Fludarabine-based conditioning regimens, capable of intense T-cell immuno suppression, have been reported to lead to early, stable engraftment with minimal toxicity in patients with several malignant and non-malignant diseases unable to tolerate conventional myeloablative therapy. Here we report the results of the twenty FA patients who underwent HSCT with using fl udarabine containing conditioning regimen.",

            "text": "Introduction: Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A (CyA) is the standard treatment for children with acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) lacking a matched donor. In our previous study of 42 children with AAA diagnosed from January 1991 to December 1999 and treated with IST we observed an overall survival of 83% at 10 years and a cumulative incidence of relapse of 16% at 10 years that resulted signifi cantly associated with rapid CyA discontinuation. The CyA-dependence without a predictive marker was observed in 18% of responders and the cumulative incidence of MDS/AML was 8% at 10 years, with a signifi cant correlation with both G-CSF cumulative dose and second IST. We concluded that IST with a slow CyA tapering course is an effective treatment with a low-relapse rate in these cases (Saracco et al, BJH 2007) . In this report we provide an update of our previous study with a 5yrs longer follow up. Methods and Results: We updated follow up of the 29 alive patients after IST at 1st December 2011. A comprehensive surveillance protocol for relapse, minor PNH clones and MDS/AML evolution was designed and applied. Overall survival at the last follow-up was 83%. The 29 survivors have been followed for a median of 160 months (range: 49-244): 22 are in remission and off CyA, 3 are still CyA-dependent (median time of CyA treatment 96 months, range 47-98 months), and 1 has mild haemolysis PNH. Two children were lost to follow up. A slow CyA tapering schedule was performed in 84% of patients. Cumulative incidence of MDS/AML was 8% at 12 years; no additional evolution to MDS/AML was observed in our cohort. Analysis of minor PNH clones is under investigation (prospective study ongoing). Discussion: This updated long-term follow-up of children with AAA confi rms that IST with a slow CyA tapering is an effective treatment with a low-relapse rate even if a persistent long-term CyA dependence is still present in 10% of alive patients. Considering the risk of clonal evolution we strongly recommend a focused surveillance strategy.",

Saracco Regina Margherita Children Hospital (Turin, IT) Objectives: Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with a combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporin (CyA) is the fi rst-line treatment for children with aplastic anemia (AA) lacking a family matched donor. However a signifi cant risk of relapse and clonal evolution is present and careful follow up is needed. We describe a comprehensive follow up workup protocol (table 1) to assess clonal surveillance and treatment-related toxicities in children with AA. Methods and Results: Protocol was applied to a cohort of 28/34 patients (diagnosed between 1990-2010) treated with IST according to EBMT/AIEOP recommendations (horse ATG before 2008). Median age 7.6 years, 18 males, 10 females, 9 very severe AA, 16 severe AA and 3 moderate AA, 14 responders after fi rst IST, 6 responders after 2 IST and 4 non responders (and then transplanted), 2 died of sepsis within 6 months from diagnosis. Among 14 patients responders to fi rst IST marrow biopsy was performed between day +90 and +120 and thereafter marrow aspirate alone was routinely evaluated; in the remaining patients, both marrow aspirate and biopsy were performed every 6/12 months. In only 30% of cases cellularity was concordant on both aspirate and biopsy. Response rate and clonal surveillance were also performed by using fl ow cytometry evaluation of peripheral CD34+ apoptotic rate (AR) and counts and minor PNH clones analysis (Timeus F, 2005 and . Clonal disease developed in 2 patients with a cumulative incidence of 13% at 20 years. Relapse occurred in 2/14 (14%) concomitantly with a decrease in circulating CD34+ cell absolute count and an increase in AR. Among non responders to IST, analysis for telomerase gene mutations was performed and in 1 child a compound heterozygosity for 2 new TERT mutations was found (Aspesi A, 2010). In the patient 5q-positive at diagnosis, chromosomal abnormality disappeared after remission. Periodical Hb F evaluation during follow up confi rmed correlation with stressed haematopoiesis (normalization during stable remission and persistent high levels, up to 24%, among partial or CSA dependent responders). Viral load monitoring showed a viral reactivation (EBV in 3 and CMV in 1) in 4/6 patients treated with fi rst line rabbit ATG. No signifi cant therapy related toxicity was reported. Conclusion: A comprehensive follow up monitoring protocol is useful to early detect relapse, toxicities and clonal evolution in children with AA and treated with IST. Background: Treatment decision making in AA patients failed fi rst line IST with ATG and CsA remains a controversial area. Standard second-line treatment options include repeated IST or HSCT from alternative donor. Thus early identifi cation of patients who are unlikely to respond to IST is an actual problem. The focus of this study is to investigate the results of second line ATG-based IST with particular emphasis on predictors of response. Methods: In the total cohort of 207 patients we analyzed the outcome in 38 patients (23 M and 15 F, median age 17, 1-60) with refractory moderate (8), severe (17) and very severe (13) AA who received repeated courses of ATG in two centers between March 2000 and June 2011. Refractory AA was defi ned as FBCs satisfying the criteria for initial diagnosis and/or persistence of transfusion dependence 4 months following fi rst course of ATG. This study includes both retrospective and prospective phases. PNH clones were tested by high sensitive multicolor fl ow cytometry. End-points of the study were hematological response, overall (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS). The hematological response was evaluated according to the strict response criteria (Camitta B., 2000) . Results: A total of 23 patients (60 %) responded to IST. Nine of 15 non-responders received HSCT. Median follow-up of living patients was 53 months . The 5-year OS and FFS were 74 % (95 % CI, 59-89 %) and 31 % (95 % CI, 13-48 %). Prognostic factors were analyzed in 31 patients with complete baseline data mainly treated in prospective study. Between the responder and non-responder groups, no signifi cant differences in gender, AA severity or interval from diagnosis were observed. Median age of non-responders and responders was 15.7 (1-60) and 18 (2-30) years respectively (p=0.02). Both PNH clone presence and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) increment after fi rst line IST predicted better response rate and OS. Nine of 10 PNH+ patients with ARC > 25x10 9 /l achieved PR, while none of the 8 PNH-patients with ARC < 25x10 9 /l responded to salvage IST. Conclusion: These data confi rm effi cacy of salvage IST in selected AA patients. The absence of PNH clone and the poor ARC increment after fi rst line IST could be considered as candidate markers for early identifi cation of true refractory AA. Further larger studies are warranted for the validation of these prognostic factors in the treatment decision making process, in particular timing of unrelated donor HSCT.",

            "text": "Results: The treatment was completed in all patients without any serious adverse event; the median follow up is now 42 months. Severe lymphocytopenia developed immediately and lasted several months (especially for CD4+ T-cells). Nevertheless, infectious events were infrequent and clinically mild, with exception of 1 fatal sepsis and 1 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (occurring in a PRCA patient relapsed with metastatic thymic carcinoma, during salvage chemotherapy). No CMV disease nor EBV-related disease was observed; 5 patients developed asymptomatic CMV reactivation cleared by pre-emptive valganciclovir. The response rates were 77% (38.5% CR) for AA and 84.5% (61.5% CR) for PRCA patients; both PWCA achieved durable CR. Current stable remission were achieved in 38.5% of AA and 23% of PRCA; the majority of long-term responders have received an additional dose of alemtuzumab to sustain the response. Long-term failures were due to refractory relapses (15% for AA and 7.5% for PRCA) or to clonal evolution (15% for AA and 23% for PRCA). Overall survival at 42 months was 73% for AA (all deaths due to refractory disease), and only 40% in PRCA (most deaths due to clonal evolution or associated comorbidities). Conclusion: Long-term follow up of patients treated with alemtuzumab confi rms that this agent has a remarkable effi cacy for the treatment of immune-mediated marrow failures, with acceptable safety profi le and promising response rates. Even if the current regimen has been not optimized yet, alemtuzumabbased IST may represent the best alternative to h-ATG, and could be considered for large head-to-head prospective comparative studies. Objective: To analyze the durability of the responses after Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) for severe autoimmune diseases (SAD) and whether the Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) remained stable over time, we aimed to evaluate the longer outcome of patients (pts) originally described (1) type. The overall day 100 TRM was 5% and has not varied in the last 5yrs (2006-2011: 5%, 2001-2005: 4% and 1996-2000: 7%) depending on AD category. Conclusions: This extended report from the ADWP EBMT data base confi rms that AHSCT can induce sustained remissions in patients with SAD refractory to conventional therapy with durable responses at 5 up to 7 yrs after AHSCT. Early identifi cation of patients with adequate fi tness for AHSCT in accordance with current EBMT guidelines (2) and growth factor mobilization but did not proceed to HSCT due to stabilization of AID (n=1), progressive AID (n=1) and severe complications of chemotherapy (n=1). AID indications included: multiple sclerosis (n=32), myasthenia gravis (n=7), Crohn's disease (n=4), rheumatoid arthritis (n=3), chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (n=2), scleroderma (n=2), stiff person syndrome (n=2), neuromyelitis optica (n=1), and systemic lupus erythematosis with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (n=1). Four of the patients had AID coincident with a hematological malignancy. Three of these patients underwent allogeneic HSCT from matched related (n=2) or matched unrelated (n=1) donor, while one patient received an unmanipulated autologous graft. The remaining 50 patients underwent autologous HSCT for refractory AID using CTX and growth factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cell grafts. Allogeneic recipients received unselected bone marrow grafts while 49 of the autologous grafts were immune depleted using CD34(+) CliniMACS immunomagnetic selection. Condition regimens included Busulphan with CTX (n=44), CTX with total body irradiation (TBI) (n=5), CTX (n=4) and Etoposide with Melphalan and TBI (n=1). Antithymocyte globulin was administered to 48 patients. Graft versus Host disease occurred in 2 of the 3 allograft recipients. Overall survival is 92% with the longest followup being 169 months. Two of the deaths (3.7%) were due to regimen related toxicity occurring -3 and 62 days from HSCT. Two deaths occurred 24 and 30 months after HSCT due to progression of concurrent lymphoma (n=1) and progression of scleroderma (n=1). There have been no deaths among the last 29 HSCT recipients. HSCT remains a viable therapy with an acceptable regimen-related mortality for patients with severe refractory AID.",

Indications were predominantly rheumatological (74%), while MS was rare (4%). Median time from diagnosis was 5 yrs. PBSC predominated as SC source in autoSCT (90%), with both BM (40%) and PBSC (60%) used in alloSCT (6 related, 9 unrelated). Conditioning was mainly cyclophosphamide-based (85%) \u00b1 ATG (53%) in autoSCT and fl udarabine-based (87%) in alloSCT. Engraftment was generally prompt; neutrophils >0.5 x10 9 /L median 12 days for autoSCT, 13 days for alloSCT; platelets>20 x10 9 /L 11 days for autoSCT, 16 days for alloSCT. Prospective clinical trial enrolment was reported in 20%. Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 5 yrs was 85% (73-92%) and 78% (63-87%) in autoSCT, and 87% (61-99%) and 65% (36-84%) in alloSCT respectively. Progression free survival (PFS) at 1 and 5 yrs was 51% (37-64%) and 33% (20-47%) in autoSCT and 80% (50-93%) and 65% (36-84%) in alloSCT respectively. 100 day and 1 yr non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 13% (6-23%) and 15% (7-25%) in autoSCT and 7% (1-41%) and 13% (2-35%) in alloSCT respectively, mainly from infection and pulmonary toxicity. Secondary autoimmune diseases were reported in 6% of autoSCT. For fi rst autoSCT, univariate analysis confi rmed signifi cant associations between OS and age (5 yr OS 95% in the 18-39 yr age group vs 67% in <18 years and 64% in >40 yrs, p=0.03), in males vs females (OS at 5 yrs 95% versus 70%, p=0.02) and with connective tissue diseases (CTD) having inferior OS and NRM compared with non-CTD indications (5 yr OS 56% vs 88%, p=0.0006; NRM 29% vs 8%, p=0.04).

This is the fi rst reported national analysis of SCT in SADs in the context of the translational and developmental phases of this approach to poor prognosis and refractory SADs.

We longitudinally analyzed the immune reconstitution of these patients to identify predictive cellular or serologic markers for long-term remissions.

            "text": "S226 Findings: Clinical remission (SLEDAI \u2264 3) could be achieved in all patients accompanied with disappearance of anti-dsDNA antibodies and protective antibodies in serum. Two patients died due to transplant-related infections. From the remaining six patients, three patients are in long-term clinical remission for up to thirteen years after HSCT, while three patients suffered a relapse of SLE at 18, 36 and 80 months post-transplantation, respectively. Patients with early relapses (\u226436 months) had lower baseline complement levels (C3 \u2264 67 mg/dl), showed persistence of antinuclear antibodies and had slower repopulation of CD31+ CD45RA+ thymic-derived CD4+ T cells after HSCT when compared to long-term responders. In contrast, antinuclear antibodies in the patient with late relapse (80 months) initially disappeared but later redeveloped, preceding the lupus-fl are by 4 years. Conclusion: We identifi ed low baseline complement levels, persistence of antinuclear antibodies and delayed thymic reactivity as risk factors for development of lupus fl ares after HSCT. Since ATG-mediated apoptosis is complement-dependent we conclude that low serum complement is directly associated with incomplete depletion of autoreactive memory cells in these patients. Our data suggest that normalization of serum complement levels before conditioning should be considered in SLE patients, either through substitution or transplantation during a period of lower disease activity. Objective: Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) has shown some benefi ts in patients with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Our data indicate that Olf1/EBF associated zinc fi nger protein (OAZ), a novel lupus susceptibility gene down-regulated after MSCT, is involved in the production of antinuclear antibody (ANA). Because this gene is highly expressed in MSCs, the role of OAZ in MSC-B cell regulation is explored. Method: Study protocol was approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee. MSCs isolated and expanded after culturing for 3 passages from bone marrow of 4 female SLE patients, were incubated with siRNAs targeting OAZ or non-targeting sequence. Three days later, cells were collected for measuring mRNA levels of OAZ and ID1-3, downstream genes of OAZ, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and levels of cytokines and chemokines in cultured supernatants were detected by ELISA. Splenic B cells from C57BL/6 mice were purifi ed using anti-CD43 antibody, co-cultured with SLE MSCs at 10:1 ratio in the presence or absence of OAZ siRNAs, and then harvested for the detection of proliferation by using BrdU assay. Result: Silencing OAZ in SLE MSCs 1) signifi cantly reduced mRNA levels of OAZ and its downstream ID1-3 by 67.9 \u00b1 7.2% and ~50% respectively, 2) signifi cantly increased expression levels of CCL2, a MSC-derived chemokine involved in plasmablast proliferation, in both mRNA and protein of cultured supernatants, and had no effects in IL-21 levels. LPS stimulated proliferation of mouse B cells was not affected by co-culturing with human MSCs at 1:10 ratio (28 \u00b10.4% vs 31 \u00b1 0.8%, n= 3 and p > 0.05), but was impaired (18 \u00b1 1.6%, p<0.05) by the addition of siRNAs targeting human OAZ gene in the co-cultures. Interestingly, when anti-CCL2 neutralizing antibody (1 ng/ml) was added to MSC-B cell co-cultures, the ability of B cell proliferation was fully restored. Conclusion: Down-regulating of OAZ in MSCs increases CCL2 levels and inhibits B cells proliferation in MSC-B cell co-cultures, implicating a role of OAZ in SLE MSCT. Objective: Our previous data showed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) had potentially therapeutic effects on autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), based on their immunosuppressive properties and low immunogenicity. This study focused on the roles of allogeneic MSCs transplantation (MSCT) in SLE patients with refractory cytopenia. Methods: Thirty-fi ve SLE patients with refractory cytopenia were enrolled in a MSCT trial. Hematological changes of pre-and post-transplantation were evaluated. Mechanisms for MSCT effects focused on the analysis of percentage of peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17. Results: Our results showed that in 35 SLE patients, 24 patients had leukopenia, 24 with anemia and 24 with thrombocytopenia. The median follow-up periods after MSCT was 21 months (range 6-45 months). Signifi cant improvements in blood cell count were found after MSCT for most of patients, in parallel with the decline of disease activity. Clinical remission was accompanied by increased Treg and decreased Th17 cells. Two patients died of uncontrolled disease recurrence after infection and adverse events related to transplantation were not observed. Conclusion: The data suggested that MSCT resulted in hematological improvements in SLE patients with refractory cytopenia, which might be associated with reconstitution of Treg and Th17 cells. Further studies for long-term larger-scale and the mechanism explorations for MSCT effects are necessary. Objective: Previous studies have indicated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit impaired capacities of proliferation, differentiation, secretion of cytokines and immune modulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether apoptosis and senescence of BMSCs from SLE patients were dysregulated. Methods: BMSCs were isolated from bone marrow of SLE patients and healthy controls by density centrifugation and adhesive culture in vitro TNF-alpha was added to detect its effect on the activation of apoptosis. The apoptosis of BMSCs was evaluated by TUNEL assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection. Real-time PCR technique was used to determine the gene expressions of Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-w, Caspase 8 and TNFR or without with TNF-alpha. Cytochrome C was detected by immunocytochemistry. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Fas, TNFR and Caspase 8. The expressions of Fas, Bcl-2 and the activity of Caspase 8 were detected by fl ow cytometry. Meanwhile, serum levels of FasL and TNF-alpha were measured by ELISA. Results: The frequencies of apoptotic and ageing BMSCs from SLE patients were signifi cantly increased in culture when compared with those of healthy controls. Notably, levels of Bcl-2 expression in BMSCs from SLE patients were markedly deceased both at mRNA and protein levels. When BMSCs were induced to apoptosis in vitro stimulated by TNF-alpha the Bax and Caspase 8 expressions in BMSCs from SLE patients were signifi cantly inceased at mRNA levels. The activity of Caspase 8 was enhanced in BMSCs from SLE patients. More cytochrome C positive pellets in the cytosolic fraction were detected in BMSCs from SLE patients compared with healthy controls. The expressions of Fas and TNFR1 on BMSCs from SLE patients were signifi cantly upregulated compared to healthy controls as well as serum level of FasL and TNF-alpha. Moreover, intracellular ROS levels of BMSCs from SLE patients were higher than those of healthy controls characterized with the activation of PI3K/AKT/FoxO3 signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our results have demonstrated increased apoptosis and senescence in BMSCs from SLE patients, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of SLE.",

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifi er: NCT00698191. Methods: A single-arm trial involved 87 refractory SLE patients, aged from 12 to 56 years old. Disease duration was 37.5 months (range, 2 to 264 months). 51 of 87 patients were each given a total of 0.6~2.4 gm of CYC intravenously. The other 36 patients received no CYC due to bad physical conditions at baseline. Thirty-one and 51 patients were infused with bone marrow (BM) or umbilical cord (UC) derived MSC, respectively. One million cells per kilogram of bodyweight were administered intravenously. The clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters were compared pre-and post-MSCT, with a mean follow-up of 27 months (range, 12 to 48 months). Adverse event was monitored all the time during and post-MSCT. Results: During the 4 years follow up, the overall rate of survival was 94% (82/87). Five patients died 5, 6, 6, 10 and 18 months post-MSCT respectively, due to uncontrolled infection or disease relapses. Disease-free survival was 28% at 1 year (23/83), 31% at 2 years (12/39), 42% at 3 years (5/12) and 50% at 4 years (3/6). Rates of relapse were 12% (10/83) at 1 year, 18% (7/39) at 2 years, 17% (2/12) at 3 years and 17% (1/6) at 4 years. The overall rate of relapse was 23% (20/87). Signifi cant improvements in SLEDAI score, serum albumin and complement 3 were examined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years post transplantation. Renal function assessed by 24-hour proteinuria improved 1, 2, 3 and 4 years after MSCT. Serum creatinine and urea nitrogen declined signifi cantly 1 and 2 years after MSCT. Glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) was detected and signifi cant improvement was found. No differences were found in disease remission, SLEDAI score, proteinuria and serum albumin levels between those with or without CYC pretreatment, those infused with BM or UC MSC. During 4 years follow up, no transplantation-related adverse event was observed for all the patients. For 93% (76/82) patients, dose of glucocorticoid was tapered to less than 10mg per day, and dose of immunosuppressant was tapered to maintenance level for 60% (49/82) patients at the last follow up. Conclusion: Allogeneic MSC transplantation is a safe and effective therapeutic option for severe and refractory SLE patients.",

Alix, D. Blackburn, D. Sokhi, C. Dalley, H. Jessop, B. Sharrack, J. Snowden Sheffi eld Teaching Hospitals (Sheffi eld, UK) Current EBMT guidelines1 recommend autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for refractory malignant multiple sclerosis (MS), but advise against AHSCT in severe disability and respiratory muscle compromise. We describe a patient with rapid onset malignant MS, refractory to conventional treatments and requiring high dependency support, in whom repeated pulse high dose cyclophosphamide (CY) resulted in suffi cient functional recovery and stem cell mobilization for safe delivery of AHSCT. A 21-year-old woman presented with progressive sensory and motor disturbance to both arms and legs in April 2011. Neuro-imagining demonstrated evidence of demyelination with enhancement and CSF had 47 white cells and was positive for oligoclonal bands. Two courses of IV methylprednisolone were given, followed by 7 sessions of plasma exchange. Despite this, symptoms progressed with increasing weakness, ataxia, nystagmus and oscillopsia; repeat imaging demonstrated multiple new white matter lesions in the brain and longitudinally extensive myelitis. Clinical deterioration continued and within 2 months she was tetraplegic and requiring ventilatory support, at which time she was treated with alemtuzumab and IV methylprednisolone without immediate response. A decision was made to intensify treatment with CY 2g/m 2 and Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in July 2011, following which stem cell harvesting was performed. Clinical improvement was noted, although the patient remained bedbound, dependent on ventilatory support and MRI continued to show new lesions and pathological enhancement in the brain and spinal cord. Repeat CSF examination revealed 10 white cells. Plasma and CSF neuromyelitis optica antibodies were negative. A further pulse of CY 2 g/m 2 was given, after which MRI appearances improved, with loss of enhancing lesions. Subsequently, in November 2011, underwent CY 200 mg/kg + anti-thymocyte globulin, and AHSCT. Routine toxicity, including neutropenic sepsis, was successfully managed and engraftment was prompt. Continued neurological improvement has been observed; she has good functional control of her upper limbs and is able to stand with assistance. Repeat MRI scanning shows a stable lesion load with no post-contrast enhancement.",

Here we report a stable clinical remission after alloSCT in two patients affected by severe forms of Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), a neurological autoimmune disorder associated with a poor prognosis and often resistant to current standard treatments. Both treated patients had aggressive NMO, positive for aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4). Upn#1 is a 30 yrs old male affected by severe relapsing longitudinally extensive trasverse myelitis (LETM). Upn#2 is a 28 yrs female with optic neuritis (ON) and LETM. Both had received multiple lines of treatment without benefi t, including corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, plasma exchange, thiotepa/cyclophosphamide and BEAM/ATG/CsA with ASCT rescue. Upn#1 was transplanted from a HLA-id sibling, upn#2 from a 9/10 MUD. Conditioning regimen consisted of full-dose treosulfan, fl udarabine, rituximab and ATG-Fresenius. GvHD prophylaxis was MTX and CsA (upn#1) or mycophenolate and rapamycin (upn#2). Hematopoietic recovery occurred within day 30, achieving full donor chimerism in both patients. There was one episode of febrile neutropenia and one of CMV reactivation, both responsive to medical therapy; no serious adverse events were reported. None of the patients experienced neither acute nor chronic GvHD. Neurological function was markedly improved in both treated patients (EDSS score dropped from 6 to 5 in upn#1 and from 8.5 to 7.5 in upn#2), and both are relapse-free at last follow up (31 and 18 months respectively). MRI did not evidence any new lesions. Importantly, AQP4 antibodies became negative in both patients.

Greco (1) Background: Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), an infl ammatory and demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, previously considered to be a severe variant of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), is characterized by recurrent attacks of optic neuritis (ON) and by longitudinally extensive trasverse myelitis (LETM). More recently NMO has been recognized as a distinct disorder with positivity for anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibodies, a poorer prognosis and an unsatisfactory response to most treatments currently in use for MS. Methods: We evaluated the outcome after high dose immunosuppressive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) of four patients with aggressive forms of NMO, unresponsive to conventional therapies. All patients had a LETM and 1 also a ON. Patients had a median of 36 years, 3 females and 1 male. Previous treatments included high dose steroids, Cyclophosphamide (CTX), Rituximab, Natalizumab, Plasma Exchange (PEX), Azathioprine, Methotrexate. Mobilization was obtained with CTX 4 gr/mq at day 0 followed by granulocyte colony stimulating factor 5 mcg/Kg/day from day +2 to stem cell harvest. HSC harvest was not manipulated before cryopreservation. Three patients received a Thiotepa-CTX based conditioning regimen before ASCT, while one patient a BEAM/ATG/Cyclosporin. Results: Mobilization was successfull in all cases, with a median of 23,23x10 6 collected and 6,1x10 6 infused CD34+cells/Kg. Hematopoietic recovery was documented in all patients, with a median of 13,5 days for neutrophil engraftment and 11 days for platelet. All patients developed febrile neutropenia, two a CMV reactivation, without serious adverse events. Two patients experienced a neurological worsening during the aplasia. All patients are alive. Relapses were observed in all patients within 1 year after ASCT, requiring other treatments, included high dose steroids, Rituximab, PEX, Alemtuzumab and for two patients allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT). Conclusions: ASCT has been unsatisfactory to maintain long term disease remissions and to reduce disability progression in four patients with aggressive NMO spectrum disorders.

Ballerini University of Florence (Florence, IT) Objectives: In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterised by progressive demyelination of brain and spinal cord axons, mesenchy-mal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as cell therapy for their ability in modulate disease processes. MSCs may modulate immune response, as it has been shown in animal models, and may act through the secretion of many substances that provide support for the damaged CNS. The use of autologous MSCs will bypass the risk of the use of an allogenic MSC Bank, therefore we study the characteristic of MSCs isolated from MS patients compared to healthy donors (HD) as a crucial step before transplantation. Methods: In the present work we characterised bone marrow (BM) MSCs isolated from 12 MS patients and 20 HD. We investigated phenotype by Flow cytometry, proliferation and colony forming unit (CFU) number, differentiation ability by osteogenic and adipogenic in vitro differentiation, immunomodulation capacity by inhibition of T cell proliferative response, toll like receptor (TLR) expression by real time (RT) PCR, cytokine production by ELISA and cell signalling pathways by Milliplex Millipore (ERK #44-611, p38 #46-610A, creb#46-631A, jnk#46-613A, STAT1#46-655A). Results: MSCs isolated from MS patients show a signifi cant (p<0.003) increased production of IP10, a T cell recall chemokine, at several in vitro passages together with increased phosphorylation of p38, CREB, JNK, and STAT1. All tests were performed before and after TLR4 stimulation. Interestingly, the basal level of activation for all these factors was higher in MS MSCs, except for STAT1. At the same time, MSC immunomodulatory action was not altered. Conclusions: The increased production of IP10 in MS MSCs goes together with an altered basal activation state and an increased phosphorylation after TLR4 stimulation of factors forming signalling cascade responsible of IP10 production and secretion. This may represent a disease marker or an effect of previous therapies or both. Our data indicate that an attentive evaluation of cells is mandatory in MS and autoimmune diseases as stem cell therapies may form an important part of the therapeutic approach in the future. High-dose immunosuppressive therapy with AHSCT offers promising results in the treatment of MS patients. Reduced intensity conditioning regimens (mini-AHSCT) is a way to improve the balance between benefi ts and side effects of this treatment approach. The patient selection criteria for this treatment modality are still unclear. We report the results of a prospective phase II open-label single center study with the analysis of the safety and effi cacy of mini-AHSCT in MS patients depending on the type of transplantation.",

The conditioning regimen included reduced or modifi ed BEAM. Median EDSS at base-line was 3.5 (range 1.5-8.5). Forty-two patients underwent early (EDSS 1, 0) , 50 patients -late (EDSS 3, (5) (6) 5) , and 3 patients -salvage (EDSS 7,0-8,0) mini-AHSCT. Neurological assessment using EDSS was performed at baseline, at discharge, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation, every 6 months thereafter up to 48 months, and then at yearly intervals. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. No transplant related deaths were reported. The mobilization and transplantation procedures were well tolerated. 39 patients after early transplantation and 51 patients after late/salvage transplantation with the follow-up period of \u2265 9 months were included in the clinical outcome analysis. After early transplantation all the patients responded to the treatment; after late/salvage transplantation all the patients, except one, were stable or had disease improvement. At long-term follow-up (median 46 months) in the group after early transplantation the clinical response was classifi ed as an improvement in 46% of patients, 48% of patients remained stable, and 6% of patients progressed. In the group after late/salvage transplantation (median 43.5 months) 32% of patients achieved improvement, 37% -stabilization, and 31% progressed. The estimated PFS at 5 years was 92% in the group after early mini-AHSCT versus 73% after late/salvage mini-AHSCT. Thus, mini-AHSCT is an effective treatment option in MS patients. The results of our study support the feasibility of early AHSCT in MS patients. Multicentre cooperative studies should be done to optimize the treatment protocol of mini-AHSCT in this patient population.

In sequence, the patients received high dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) plus rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (4.5 mg/kg), followed by infusion of autologous, non-selected HSC. One patient died after mobilization due to aspiration pneumonia associated with very severe scleroderma. A second patient died 22 days after HSCT due to bacterial sepsis. One patient abandoned follow-up after successful mobilization, with improvement of skin fi brosis. Twenty-two patients were followed for a median of 24 (6-60) months. Modifi ed Rodnan Skin Score decreased signifi cantly (p<0.0001), beginning 6 months after transplantation.

One patient relapsed 6 months after HSCT, and one patient was non-responsive to HSCT. Two patients had a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) overlap, with SLE relapse after HSCT (cytopenias). Both were successfully treated with Rituximab.

Onida (1) Background and aims: Over the past 15 years, the use of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in severe autoimmune diseases resistant to conventional treatment has constantly increased. Here we report an update on our experience with unselected stem cell autotransplantation in refractory Crohn's disease (CD). Patients and Methods: Since November 2005, ten patients (4 males, 6 females) with active moderate-severe CD (median CDAI 340, range 236-395; four with perianal disease), all refractory or intolerant to multiple drugs including anti-TNF-alpha agents and various immunosuppressive agents, were enrolled. Median age was 35 years (22 to 46). Unselected PBSCs were collected after mobilisation with CTX 1.5 g/m 2 and G-CSF 10 \u03bcg/kg. Conditioning regimen included CTX 50 mg/kg on days -5 to -2 and rabbit ATG 2.5 mg/kg on days -4 to -2. Toxicity, clinical remission (CDAI < 150), endoscopic remission (SES-CD) and extramucosal response (ultrasound sonography [US]) were assessed after mobilisation and at 3, 12 months and then every year after stem cells reinfusion. Results: No improvement was confi rmed after mobilisation (median CDAI 364, range 201-404). Neutrophils and platelets engraftment occurred at a median of +12 and +9 days, respectively. At the third month following transplantation, all patients were in clinical remission with a CDAI less than 150 (median 91, range 56-132) despite discontinuation of all medications. After a median follow-up of 56 months (range 23-68), clinical remission was maintained in 80%, 50%, 40%, 30% and 30% of the evaluable patients at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year after HSCT, respectively. Complete mucosal healing was observed in 50% and 60% after 3 and 12 months, respectively, but maintained in only 30% at their last visit. Perianal fi stulas closure was observed in 3/4 patients. No deaths or life-threatening infections occurred. Adverse events included a perianal abscess after mobilisation in one patient, pleural and pericardial effusions in another, BK virus-related macrohaematuria in one case, acute pielonephritis in another patient, all rapidly resolved with conservative treatment. Conclusions: Although relapses have occurred, we observed tsreatment-free remissions for as long as 5 years. We conclude that unselected CD34+ cells transplantation can induce and maintain both clinical and endoscopic remission in refractory CD patients.",

Snarski (1) Secondary autoimmune diseases are common complication after HSCT for autoimmune diseases and can be present in about 10% of transplanted patients. Diabetes type 1 is an autoimmune disorder in which autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is applied. Diabetes is often accompanied by various autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disorders, celiac disease or vitiligo. As high as 40% of diabetic patients have second autoimmune disorder. We report here the occurrence of autoimmune thyroid dis orders in diabetic patients that underwent HSCT at our institution (n=15). The patients were treated with conditioning regiment containing cyclophosphamide and rabbit antithymocyte globulin. The median follow up is 26 months. During that period we identifi ed 7 cases of autoimmune thyroid disorder (46% of the patients) with presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Only one patient had secured diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis prior to transplantation. All patients had thyroid-stimulating hormone within normal values prior to HSCT, but the antithyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were not measured for most of the patients before transplantation. Time range from transplantation to thyroid dysfunction was 5,5 to 15 months. Five of seven patients were females. The autoimmune thyroid disorder so far required treatment in 2 patients (1 Graves-Basedov disease, 1autoimmune thyroiditis). Of note is that 4 of 7 patients with autoimmune thyroid disorder returned to insulin dependence but at lower doses than before transplantation. Conclusion: The patients after HSCT for diabetes might be prone to autoimmune thyroid disorders -however at the rates typical for diabetes. The routine testing for anti-thyroid antibodies should be included in screening and follow up tests in this group of patients.",

Grzasko, P. Klimek, A. Nowaczynska, M. Gorska-Kosicka Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Objectives: Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to mobilise haematopoietic stem cells. Biosimilar fi lgrastim is now available in Europe. No differences were observed between biosimilar fi lgrastim (n=40) and a retrospective cohort of patients receiving originator fi lgrastim for stem cell mobilisation in a previous comparison, although no safety fi ndings were reported (Lefr\u00e8re et al. Adv Ther 2011; 28:304-10) . We compared the effi cacy and safety of a biosimilar fi lgrastim (Zarzio\u00ae, Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals) with originator fi lgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae, Amgen) in patients with haematological malignancies. Methods: A total of 108 patients were included in this study, 59 of whom were female (49 male), with an overall median age of 51 years (range 19-69). Patients had multiple myeloma (n=46), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=26), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=28) or other diagnosis (n=8). Median time from diagnosis to mobilisation was 10 months (range 3-122). After administration of mobilising regimens (primarily high-dose etoposide, high-dose cyclophosphamide, intermediate-dose Ara C or ESHAP) , patients were randomised to a standard daily 10 \u03bcg/kg dose of Zarzio\u00ae (n=54) or Neupogen\u00ae (n=54). Results: Median duration of G-CSF administration was 8 days with both Zarzio\u00ae (range [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and Neupogen\u00ae (range [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Both groups had a median of one apheresis with a median time until fi rst apheresis of 11 days. There were no statistically signifi cant differences between groups in the median (range) number of mobilised CD34+ cells/\u03bcL in peripheral blood (Zarzio\u00ae, 62.0 ; Neupogen\u00ae, 47.5 ) or the number of CD34+ cells/ kg body weight (Zarzio\u00ae, Neupogen\u00ae, ). Five patients (9%) in each group did not mobilise suffi cient CD34+ cells. The adverse event profi le was comparable between the Zarzio\u00ae and Neupogen\u00ae groups, with similar occurrence of neutropenic fever (9 vs 11 patients) and bone pain (8 vs 6 patients). Conclusion: Zarzio\u00ae demonstrated similar effi cacy and safety as the reference fi lgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae) in haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in patients with haematological malignancies. Objectives: Following apheresis and cyropreservation, the precise enumeration of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) as key parameter of graft quality is mandatory for the clinical course after transplantation. Currently, fl ow cytometry based on beads technology performed as single-platform (SP) technique represents the \"gold standard\" for such determinations. We compared a classic SP method (M1) for enumeration of CD45+ or CD34+ cells with a new device allowing direct volumetric measurements (M2) of HPC. Methods: Fresh samples, 14 from mobilized peripheral blood (PB) and 9 from apheresis products, and 13 samples from frozen-thawed HPC grafts were analyzed for CD34+ cells, CD45+ cells, and in frozen-thawed samples for viability by M1 and in parallel by M2. Results: Correlation analysis for CD34+ cells revealed a signifi cant (p<0.01) correlation between both techniques with r = 0.95, r = 0.933, and r = 0.929, respectively, for each material. Additionally, measured median numbers of CD34+ cells/\u03bcL did not differ comparing results resulting from M1 with results from M2 for the different analyzed materials (fresh PB: 41.5 versus 41; apheresis products: 2,680 versus 2,355; frozen-thawed samples: 2,170 versus 2,399). For analysis of CD45+ cells/\u03bcL, the correlation was signifi cant (p<0.01) for fresh PB samples and for frozen-thawed samples between M1 and M2 measurements. Furthermore, the median number of CD45+ cells/\u03bcL evaluated with the different techniques did not differ between the three analyzed materials. In frozen-thawed samples, the analysis of viability was comparable and without differences for M1 and M2. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that a direct volumetric analysis of CD34+ cells/\u03bcL or CD45+ cells/\u03bcL is feasible in different materials and that the results do not differ from the results derived from the standard SP method. This volumetric technique may represent a new and cheaper approach to further standardize HPC analyses.",

Renders, A. G\u00fcnther, T. Valerius, U. Buwitt-Beckmann, M. Gramatzki, A. Humpe Section of Stem Cell and Immunotherapy (Kiel, DE) Objectives: Relapse of Non Hodgkin`s lymphoma (NHL) occurring several years after autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (aHPCT) rises the question of the availability of HPC for a second transplantation (Tx). Data regarding feasibility of mobilization and harvest of HPC after fi rst myeloablative conditioning and HPCT are rare. Therefore, we report two cases of successful mobilization, harvest, and for one of the two patients Tx of HPC more than 10 years after fi rst Tx. Case Reports: In two patients with a NHL diagnosed in 1996 (a 47-years-old man) and 1997 (a 23-years-old woman) initial chemotherapy was followed by harvest of autologous HPC after mobilization with Dexa-BEAM (dexamethasone, BCNU, etoposide, cytosin-arabinoside, melphalan) and G-CSF. Both patients were successfully transplantated with aHPC after total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Relapse occurred in both patients in 2011, 13 and 15 years after fi rst Tx. After reinduction of another complete remission, mobilization therapy was given. This consisted of Cy (3 g/sqm) for the female patient and due to previous toxicity of R-DHA (rituximab, dexamethasone and high-dose cytosine-arabinoside) for the male patient followed by G-CSF. A total of 5.5x10E+06 CD34+ cells/kg of bw (female patient) and 8.1x10E+06 CD34+ cells/kg of bw (male patient) were harvested in one apheresis processing 5.5 times (female) and 3.6 times (male) the total peripheral blood volume of the respective patient. Analysis of clonogenic growth in samples of satellite tubes of the grafts after freezing and thawing revealed results comparable to data from patients without previous aHPCT. Until now, only the female patient was transplanted a second time. She received the complete dose of harvested aHPC after conditioning with BEAM. The patient exhibited regular engraftment parameters with respect to a neutrophil count > 500/\u03bcl on day +11 and a platelet count > 20,000/\u03bcl without transfusion support on day +11 after Tx. The patient could be discharged from hospital on day +13 after Tx in good clinical condition and is in complete remission 3 months after Tx. Conclusions: In patients with relapse of NHL more than 10 years after myeloablative conditioning and autologous Tx a new attempt to mobilize HPC after reinduced remission is feasible. Even a TBI based previous therapy does not exclude successful remobilization, harvest, and retransplantation in such patients.",

Humpe (1), S. Schill (1) , P. Schlenke (2) Objectives: Transplantation (Tx) of allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is a therapeutic option for patients with hematological malignancies. For bone marrow (BM) grafts, the suffi cient dose of HPC for successful engraftment is usually defi ned by the number of nucleated cells (NC) per kg of body weight (bw). In case of AB0 blood group incompatibility between donor and recipient, red cell depletion or plasma reduction are necessary with the result, that NC are decreased and are no longer a reliable parameter of graft quality. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of graft parameters of consecutive HPC transplantation with BM at two German centers (Kiel, M\u00fcnster). Results: During the analyzed time period, at total of 131 BM Tx were performed. The key parameters age of recipient, volume of the graft, number of NC/CD45+ cells per kg of bw, and number of CD34+ cells/kg of bw were analyzed. Results: At the time of analysis, one or more key parameters were available for a total of 101 Tx, 67 performed with a manipulated (GI) and 34 with an unmanipulated graft (GII). The median age of recipient was comparable between GI and GII. The median volume of the graft of GI before manipulation and of the graft of GII were comparable (1,020 ml and 1,094 ml, respectively). The fi nal median volume (140 ml) of the graft in GI after manipulation was signifi cantly (p<0.01) smaller compared with the other volumes. Neither the median number of NC/CD45+ cells per kg of bw nor the median number of CD34+ cells/kg of bw were different between GI before manipulation and GII (3.1x10E+08 versus 3.1x10E+08, 2.8x10E+06 versus 3.4x10E+06). In addition, the median number of CD34+ cells/kg of bw in GI after manipulation (3.0x10E+06) was not different compared with the above values. But the number of NC/CD45+ cells per kg of bw decreased signifi cantly (p<0.001) to a median of 1.05x10E+08 when compared with the values of GI before manipulation and the values of GII. In addition, this was below the accepted threshold dosage of 2-3x10E+08 NC per kg of bw for Tx. Conclusions: Red cell depletion and/or plasma reduction in AB0 blood group incompatible BM Tx led to a signifi cant decrease of graft volume and of the number of NC/CD45+ cells per kg of bw. The number of CD34+ cells/kg of bw was not infl uenced by such manipulations and seemed to be the more reliable parameter for such BM grafts. Although, a potential correlation to engraftment should still be analyzed. Objectives: Successful mobilization of suffi cient or even optimal amounts of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is necessary for transplantation after high-dose therapy. In patients who do not mobilize suffi cient numbers of HPC, the addition of Plerixafor offers a new therapeutic option.",

            "text": "Methods: We analyzed a series of patient undergoing mobilization with plerixafor for intraapheresis recruitment (IR) of HPC. IR was defi ned as difference of the total number of CD34+ cells/ kg of body weight (bw) in the harvest and the total number of CD34+ cells/kg of bw in the peripheral blood (PB) before apheresis. Data from 98 aphereses of 55 different patients being mobilized with chemotherapy and/or G-CSF and Plerixafor were retrospectively analyzed regarding number of CD34+ cells in PB before apheresis and number of CD34+ cells in the graft. Results: 27 of the patients were female and 28 were male. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range: 14-75 years) Patients` diagnosis were multiple myeloma (n=23), Non Hodgkin ' s lymphoma (n=27), Hodgkin ' s disease (n=2), germ cell tumor (n=1), Ewing ' s sarcoma (n=1), and B-CLL (n=1). A median of 2 aphereses (range: 1-5) per patient were performed processing a median of 4 times (range: 1.4-7.7 times) the total PB volume. The median number of CD34+ cells/\u03bcl in PB before apheresis was 15 (range: 2-148). A median amount of 1.77x10E+06 CD34+ cells/kg of bw (range: 0.14x10E+06 -17.5x10E+06) was harvested per apheresis. The median IR per apheresis was 0.87x10E+06 CD34+ cells/kg of bw (range: -0.66x10E+06 to 7.40x10E+06). A nonparametric correlation (according to Spearman) analysis between the number of processed total PB volume and the IR revealed a weak (r=0.36) but signifi cant (p<0.01) correlation. Conclusions: The presented data demonstrate, that the addition of plerixafor in poorly mobilizing patients can induce an IR of HPC during harvest. In addition, expanding the apheresis size seems to further improve and optimize the potential yield of HPC by increasing the intraapheresis recruitment. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a treatment strategy for restoring hematopoietic function in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM) and/ or Hodgkin's lymphoma. We conducted a monocentric retrospective study on the mobilization procedure to 1) determine the place of pleri xafor in the mobilization strategy and to 2) defi ne an algo rithm of mobilization procedure. Twenty-four patients were analyzed, 9 NHL and 15 MM, with a median age of 56,4 years . For the fi rst 20 patients, the mobilization strategy was the use of G-CSF and chemotherapy (group 1) (n=17) or G-CSF alone (group 2) (n=3). All these patients failed to mobilize enough PBSC. The median of circulating CD 34+ cells before apheresis was 4.25\u03bc/L [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and 4\u03bc/L [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] respectively for the group 1 and 2. The characteristics of these 20 patients have shown predictive factors associated to poor mobilization. For these 20 patients, we decided to use the combination of G-CSF followed by daily plerixafor for the second mobilization procedure.This second attempt to mobilize PBSC was successful for 17 patients (85%). The median number of circulating CD34+ was 35.5 on day 2 of plerixafor. The number of CD34+ cells collected for transplantation was 6.05 [0 to 43.08 x 10 6 CD34+/kg]. The median number of apheresis sessions for these 20 patients was 1.6 [1] [2] [3] (Figure 1a-b) . According to the results of the 20 fi rst patients and based on the results of Micallef et al (ASH 2009 , abstract 3211), we designed a algorithm for the decision to use G-CSF + plerixafor in fi rst mobilization procedure (Figure 2 ). The following 4 patients with predictive factors to poor mobilization (75% were >60 y, 75% received previous intensive chemotherapy, 50% have a platelet count <100x10 9 /L before apheresis, and 100% have principally a number of circulating CD34+ cells insuffi cient to proceed to apheresis after G-CSF alone). With this strategy, at day 5, patients received plerixafor and the mobilization was successful for 100% of the patients [4.57-8 .14 x 10 6 CD34+/Kg] with a low number of apheresis sessions.",

Objectives We aimed at establishing the effi ciency of Plerixafor administration in 'poor mobilizers' multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphoma patients. Methods: In a unicentric retrospective study data records on 7 patients enrolled between 2009-2011 were analyzed. Pathological background consisted of MM (n=4) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n=3) with a mean age of 43.85 yr (range 23-61) and a sex ratio of 1.33:1 (male:female). Two NHL patients received previous radiotherapy and 2 of the MM cases were treated with Alkeran based regimens before chemomobilization. All patients received chemotherapy followed by administration of G-CSF (10 ug/kg/day) and Plerixafor was added starting with day 6. Apheresis procedures were performed on Cobe Spectra-MNC protocol. Results: Plerixafor was administrated in 4 patients with failure to achieve an absolute count of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood >10/uL while in 3 cases, the prior apheresis products contained insuffi cient CD34+ cells (<2.5x10 6 /kg). Standard dose for Plerixafor was 0.24 mg/kg, with an average number of 2.4\u00b10.69",

In 3 patients chemomobilization with Plerixafor was applied 2 times, while the remaining subjects received only 1 chemomobilization cycle. We performed 14 apheresis procedures (AP), more than 2.5x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg being collected after 2 AP in 3 patients, 1 AP in 2 cases and 4 AP in 1 case; in 1 patient the established target of CD34+ cells/kg was not achieved after 2 mobilization cycles with Plerixafor. After Plerixafor administration the absolute value of CD34+ cells increased 2 folds in 3 subjects, 4 folds in 2 patients and more than 4 folds in 2 patients. Five patients (3-MM; 2-NHL) underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and mean engraftment day for granulocytes and platelets was 16.25\u00b12.21 respectively 22\u00b10.81; one patient ceased 7 days after stem cells infusion. Conclusion: Plerixafor combined with chemomobilization was signifi cantly more effective in collecting the target number of CD34+ cells in 6 subjects from our population of 'poor mobilizers' with a good impact on engraftment time points.",

Rebmann University of Essen (Essen, DE) Introduction: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and under certain circumstances Plerixafor, an antagonist of the CXCR4-SDF 1a axis, are used for stem cell (SC) mobilization in autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Earlier studies indicated a down-regulating effect of GCSF on T cell activity. Here we asked for the immune modulating capability of these agents towards NK cell effector functions. Methods: Cytotoxicity and cytokine release of NK cells were studied in peripheral SC donors (N = 20) before and 5 days after GCSF administration (in-vivo stimulation). In addition, NK cell functions were analysed after culturing of peripheral blood cells from healthy blood donors (N =12) in presence and absence of GCSF and Plerixafor (in-vitro stimulation). NK cells were isolated by negative selection and their functions were studied using the HLA-E*01:03 transfected K562 cells and the parental HLA class I negative K562 cell line as target cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by fl ow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. IFN-gamma and sFasL release were detected in culture medium by ELISA. Receptor expression and adhesion molecule profi ling were performed for CD3, CD56, CD45, CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, CD2, CD18, CD50, CD58 and CD62L. Results: The NK cells showed a reduced cytotoxicity towards K562/K562:HLA-E*01:03 target cells after in-vivo or in-vitro GCSF stimulation compared to not-treated NK cells (p<0.05). The proportion of HLA-E specifi c receptors (CD94+NKG2A+) is reduced by GCSF (p=0.011). GCSF reduces the IFN gamma and sFasL release of NK cells in-vivo (p=0.004) and in-vitro (p=0.03). The percentage of CD56bright cells on total NK cells and the expression of the CD2, CD50 and CD62L on CD56bright NK cells are signifi cantly decreased by GCSF stimulation (p<0.01). Contrary to GCSF, Plerixafor leads to enhanced NK cytotoxicity and sFasL release (p<0.05) and tentatively to increased expression of the adhesion molecules CD2, CD18 and CD58 on CD56dim cells. The IFN gamma release seems not to be affected by Plerixafor. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this study is the fi rst one showing that GCSF impairs NK functions, whereas Plerixafor leads to an enhanced NK alloreactivity. Thus, Plerixafor might lead to a more benefi cial immune reconstitution -which may be especially relevant in the haploidentical SCT setting.",

Morabito, G. Andreola, A. Babic, A. Montinaro, R. Elezi, C. Rabascio, G. Martinelli, D. Laszlo European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Background: G-CSF with or without chemotherapy is the most common strategy for PBSC mobilization. Recently biosimilar forms of G-CSF have been approved for the same indication as the reference fi lgrastim. Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, has been shown to increase the number of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood in pts with lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) and to rescue pts unable to mobilize with traditional approach with a good safety profi le. Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) form a religious group of about six million members worldwide that, for religious reasons, refuse transfusion of any major blood products; the use of full dose of mobilizing chemotherapy is therefore not recommended in these pts. A mobilization approach that allows an adequate PBSC collection and avoids risks of myelosuppression is strongly preferred in JW pts. Aim: To assess the effi cacy of the combination of originator fi lgrastim or Filgrastim XM02 (Tevagastrim) and plerixafor in achieving the optimal required dose of CD34+ cells for ASCT (\u22654x10 6 CD34+ cells/Kg) in JW pts affected by MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed mobilization procedures of 7 JW pts, median age 56 years , affected by MM (#6) and NHL (#1), scheduled to receive an ASCT. Six out of seven pts had never been mobilized before, while 1 had already received a previous ASCT. Tevagrastim (#4) or originator fi lgrastim (#3) was self-administered at 10ug/kg/die for 3 days; on day 4 plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg) was administered 12 hours before the apheresis procedure. Results: The median number of circulating CD34+ cells following plerixafor administration was 91/ul (13-138). Median number of CD34+/kg cells collected was 5.6x10 6 /kg (2.4-8.4 ) by 1 procedure in 5 pts and 2 in the others; the only patient who collected \u22644x10 6 cells/kg was the who had already received a previous ASCT; 4/6 pts affected by MM collected the amount of CD34+ cells/kg needed for a tandem transplant (\u22654x10 6 cells/ kg) by 1 procedure, with a median number of 6.7x10 6 cells/kg (4.1-8.4) . No major side effects were reported. All the pts underwent stem cell transplantation with Melphalan (140 mg/sqm) and engrafted. Conclusions: Our data show that originator fi lgrastim or Tevagrastim in combination with plerixafor is a feasible and safe approach in JW pts and allows collection of adequate number of PBSC needed for ASCT avoiding chemotherapy related side effects.",

            "text": "Plerixafor in combination with originator or biosimilar XM02-G-CSF as fi rst-line peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation strategy in patients with lymphomas and multiple myeloma candidate to ASCT: a single-centre experience D. Laszlo, G. Andreola, A. Babic, C. Rabascio, A. Montinaro, L. Morabito, R. Elezi, A. Vanazzi, G. Martinelli European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Plerixafor, a CXCR4 chemokine antagonist, has shown to increase the number of circulating CD34+ cells in cancer patients alone or in combination with G-CSF and to be able to rescue patients (pts) unable to mobilize with traditional approach. Recently, several forms of biosimilar nonglycosylated recombinant human G-CSF have been approved for the same indications as the reference fi lgrastim on the basis of comparable quality, effi cacy, and safety. Biosimilars also provide a more cost-effective strategy and their use in clinical setting may provide cost savings. We therefore used plerixafor in combination with originator G-CSF or biosimilar version of G-CSF (Tevagrastim) as fi rst line mobilization strategy in pts with Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma (MM) scheduled to receive an ASCT. The primary endpoint was the proportion of pts mobilizing \u226520 cells/\u03bcl on day 5 and collecting \u22652.0 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg on the same day. From April 2010 to November 2011, 28 pts, median age 57 yrs (17-68), affected by Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (#12), Hodgkin Disease (#3) and MM (#13), received a combination of G-CSF (#7) or Tevagrastim (#21) and plerixafor as fi rst line strategy for peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilization; median lines of previous chemotherapy was 2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Filgrastim or Tevagrastim was self-administered (10ug/kg/die) for 3 days; on day 4 plerixafor was injected (0.24mg/kg) 12 hours before the scheduled apheresis. On day 5 median number of circulating CD34+ cells was 52/ul (10-138) in 24 pts; 4/28 pts (14%) were unable to mobilize \u226520 cells/\u03bcl on day 5 and required a second plerixafor administration. All 28 patients were able to collect an adequate number of CD34+ cells necessary for the transplantation procedure with a median number of 4x10 6 (2.2-10.6) CD34+cells/kg in a median number of 1 procedure (1-2); 19/28 (68%) pts harvested the required CD34+ dose on day 5. For pts with MM, 7/13 (53%) collected \u22654\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg in a single procedure. In terms of mobilization, no difference was observed with the use of G-CSF or biosimilar Tevagastrim and no major side effect was reported either with G-CSF or biosimilar Tevagastrim. The combination of G-CSF or tevagrastim and plerixafor is safe and effective in mobilizing PBSC and allows a collection of a more than adequate number of cells in most of the pts in a maximum of 2 apheresis procedure, even in pts with MM who need to collect a double amount of cells for a tandem transplant. Reported rates of stem cell mobilisation failure prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are variable (5-40%) according to the study population, target yield and mobilisation protocol. There has been recent interest in using Plerixafor to enhance mobilisation, although a lack of consensus about indications for use. We report the outcome of stem cell mobilisation at a single centre using a uniform treatment strategy. 154 sequential patients treated during 2010-11 were included. Patient demographics & treatment are shown in table 1. Target yield was >2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg in \u22643 harvests; >4x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg were collected if possible for myeloma patients to allow a potential second transplant. Harvesting was attempted if circulating CD34+ count was >10x10 6 /l. 94.2% (145/154) of patients mobilised >2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (median 4.73x10 6 range 0-38.9) after a total of 201 harvests (1-3 per patient). 67% (32/48) of myeloma patients achieved >4x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. Median circulating CD34+ cell count on day 1 of fi rst harvest was 57.9x10 6 /l (range 0-990); 10/154 patients had a count of <10 x10 6 /l and harvesting was not attempted. Circulating CD34+ cell count correlated with yield (Spearman's rho 0.85). The optimal predictive CD34+ count for successful harvest was >15x10 6 /l (ROC analysis: sensitivity 97%, specifi city 83%). 14 patients required re-mobilisation (total 18 procedures) utilising a Plerixafor based regimen (6/18) or GCSF\u00b1chemotherapy (12/18). 67% achieved the target yield using Plerixafor vs 33% where Plerixafor was not used (p=NS). 61% (94/154) of patients proceeded to ASCT; most common reasons not to proceed were progressive disease, allogeneic transplant or patient choice. All transplanted patients engrafted with median time to neutrophil (>0.5x10 9 /l) and platelet (>20x10 9 /l) recovery of 12 days (range 9-20) and 13 days (range 9-62) respectively. The majority of patients achieved yield >2x10 6 CD34+ cells/ kg and prompt engraftment following ASCT. Plerixafor could potentially facilitate a higher yield although this is not routine practice in the UK. CD34+ cell yield correlated strongly with circulating count on the day of harvest and Plerixafor should be considered if predictive CD34+ count is low; our results suggest an optimal cutoff of <15x10 6 /l. This may obviate the need for re-mobilisation (required in 9.1% of the cohort) although further studies are needed to confi rm the effi cacy & cost-effectiveness of this approach.",

Marktel Scientifi c Institute H S Raffaele (Milan, IT) Low numbers of infused progenitors is a risk factor for primary graft failure, especially for patients receiving a T-depleted haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT), where megadoses are required for engraftment. Plerixafor (Mozobil\u00ae) causes mobilization by disrupting the SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction. At our Institute, 2 healthy donors for patients candidate to haplo-SCT did not achieve the expected target of 7x10 6 CD34+/kg recipient with conventional mobilization (G-CSF 10 mcg/kg daily) and were successfully mobilized with plerixafor. A 61 yrs old male (86kg) affected by high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was candidate to a T-depleted haplo-SCT. On day 4 of G-CSF mobilization, the 37 yrs old female donor (50kg) had 33/mcL circulating CD34+(WBC42x10 3 /mcL) resulting in a harvest of 1.27x10 6 CD34+/kg recipient (0.9x10 6 CD34+/kg post CliniMACS Milteni positive immunoselection). Following informed consent for off-label use, the donor received a single subcutaneous (sc) injection of 24 mgs plerixafor (0.48 mg/kg) in combination with G-CSF with no side effects; 8 hrs later: circulating CD34+: 134/mcL (WBC 64x10 3 /mcL), harvest: 7.04x10 6 CD34/Kg recipient (post selection 5.64x10 6 CD34+/Kg, effi ciency 80%, 0.5x10 4 CD3+/Kg). Engraftment: neutrophil >500/mcL day 20, >1000/mcL day 24; platelets >20,000/mcL day 18, >50,000/mcL day 21. A 62 yrs old female (55 kg) affected by high risk AML was candidate to a T-depleted haplo-SCT. On day 5 and 6 of G-CSF mobilization, the 58 yrs old male donor (70kg) had 29 and 35/mcL circulating CD34+ (WBC36 and 37x10 3 /mcL) resulting in a harvest of 3.93 and 3.42x10 6 CD34+/kg recipient (total dose post immunoselection 4.59x10 6 CD34+/kg, effi ciency 62%, 0.39x10e4 CD3+/kg). To increase the cell dose, following informed consent, the donor received a sc injection of 24 mgs plerixafor (0.34 mg/kg) in combination with G-CSF with no side effects; 8 hrs later: circulating CD34+: 77/mcL(WBC71x10 3 /mcL); harvest 8.2x10 6 CD34+/Kg recipient (post selection 4.9x10 6 CD34+/ kg, effi ciency 59%, 0.19x10 4 CD3+/Kg).

Kanold CHU Clermont-Ferrand (Clermont-Ferrand, FR) Background: The rapid kinetics of hematopoietic stem cells induced by plerixafor (Mozobil\u00ae, Genzyme) could be valuable in children. We conducted a prospective trial to determine whether a one-day mobilization by plerixafor alone was suffi ciently effi cient in children with cancer. Methods: Children with solid malignancies were consecutively recruited for this phase IIA, Bayesian single-centre prospective trial. Mobilization consisted of one subcutaneous injection of 240 \u03bcg/kg body weight plerixafor at 8 a.m. (h0). Collection by apheresis began at h5 provided the level of CD34+ exceeded 10x10 6 /L. Our main evaluation criterion was the percentage of children in whom at least 5x10 6 CD34+/kg could be collected during the fi rst apheresis. Results: No patient met the success criterion, so the trial ceased after fi ve patients on set stop criteria. All the patients reached the threshold value of 10x10 6 CD34+cells/L after injection, and apheresis could be performed in all cases. The median number of CD34+ cells collected was 1.62x10 6 /kg BW [0.47-3.5] . Three out of the fi ve patients yielded >1.5x10 6 CD34+/kg BW. The peak levels of CD34+cells ranged from 11x10 6 /L to 44x10 6 /L and were reached in 4 to 6 hours. No side-effects were observed. Conclusion: A one-day mobilization regimen consisting of one injection of 240 \u03bcg/kg plerixafor alone with collection of HSC starting at h3 was not effi cient enough to collect a complete graft, but may be an attractive option for completing an insuffi cient graft.",

Results: For all treated with Plerixafor patients, the number of CD34+ in previous collections was under the limit for successful transplantation. After Mozobil application the number of CD34+ increased over 20 cells/\u03bcl and suffi ecient harvest was obtained. For all patients mobilisations were successful without serious complications. The number of apheresis was 17, median number of Mozobil application was 1.7 vials per patient, and median number of collected CD34+ was 3.07 x10 6 kg. All patients were successfully transplanted. The median time to neutrophil and platelets engraftment was at 12 days and 12.9 days, respectively. Conclusions: For all \"poor mobilizers\" adequate transplant CD34+ cell dose was obtained by combination of Plerixafor with G-CSF. Patients mobilized with Plerixafor have the same post transplant recovery and long-term outcome. There are pharmacoeconomic's advanteges in the long term prices of ASCT. Our data suggest that Plerixafor (Mozobil) administered with standard mobilisation cytokine (G-CSF) could be effective to patients previously failed G-CSF PBSC mobilisation attempts.",

Josefsen, G. Hetland, H. Holte, G. Kvalheim Oslo University Hospital (Oslo, NO) In our hospital mobilization of autologous hematopoietic stem cells in lymphoma patients is done by standard induction chemotherapy and G-CSF. To obtain a quick and sustained engraftment after high dose therapy, a minimal number of 2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg are desirable. However, in 15-20% of the lymphoma patients characterized as poor mobilizers, insuffi cient numbers of CD34+ cells are harvested, either prompting remobilization, or can not be offered high dose therapy even if it could be curative. Recently, new mobilizing agents including plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, have been developed. Our own experiences have shown that when a low concentration of CD34+ cells (4-10 cells/\u03bcL) and a total white cell count >10x10 9 /L is seen in patients given chemotherapy and G-CSF they are hard to mobilize and addition of plerixafor should be considered. In the present study, we have mobilized and harvested 12 poor mobilizing lymphoma patients. Two patients were remobilized with G-CSF and plerixafor, whereas 10 patients were given plerixafor up-front in the primary mobilization attempt in addition to chemotherapy and G-CSF. The patients were then followed after reinfusion of autologous stem cells with regard to short and long term engraftment. All patients were successfully harvested (median: 4.2x10 6 CD34+cells/kg; range: 1.8-7.2x10 6 CD34 cells/kg).Then, all patients received high dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell support. Time to short term engraftment, defi ned by neutrophils >0.5x10 9 /L and thrombocytes >20x10 9 /L were 10.5 days (median; range 9-16) and 14.5 days (median; range 11-100). As an estimate on long term engraftment we also examined the thrombocyte levels at day 100 after reinfusion. The median level was 114x10 9 /L (range 27-398). Notably, the patient with a thrombocyte value of 27, received only 1.8x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg, but had a satisfactory number of CFU-GM/kg S239 at the time of infusion. He has later developed a pancytopenia, and further examination has revealed myelodysplasia in this patient. For comparison, we examined the thrombocyte levels of 12 consecutive lymphoma patients receiving high dose therapy with autologous stem cell support after a normal stem cell mobilization, and observed day 100 thrombocyte levels of 213x10 9 /L (median; range 95-338). We conclude that our recommendation to use up-front plerixafor in hard to mobilize lymphoma patients is successful in 10 out of 10 patients. Furthermore, only 1 or 2 days of apheresis was needed.",

Lanza (1), D. Laszlo (2) , A Pasini (1) Plerixafor is an inhibitor of CXCR4 receptor /SDF-1 binding used in combination with G-CSF for mobilization of autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cells (auto-PBSCT). In this study, we collected data from 211 patients with various hematological disorders (multiple myeloma, MM, n 81, non Hodgkin lymphoma, n. 105, Hodgkin lymphoma, n 25). 144 patients were considered proven poor mobilizer, since they have had a previous mobilization failure, and 65 were classifi ed as predicted poor mobilizer according to GITMO criteria (BMT, 2011, May 30:1-10). All patients received plerixafor (Mozobil-Genzyme-Sanofi ) plus G-CSF with or without chemotherapy in 23 Italian centres. A total of 140 patients (68%) collected \u2265 2 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The collection yield was signifi cantly higher in MM patients (82%) than in HL (70%) and NHL (57%). Eighteen patients were mobilised using G-CSF biosimilar (Tevagrastim-Teva) plus Plerixafor in proven poor mobilizer patients; 15 of them mobilized \u2265 2 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells. Overall, 83% of patients reached \u2265 20 CD34+ cells/uL with plerixafor plus fi lgrastim biosimilar, after a median of 3.6 fold increase in CD34+ cells/uL from day 4 to day 5. No side effects were observed in the cases examined. Eighty % of the patient subgroup having \u2265 2 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells, were transplanted with CD34+ cells mobilised with the combination of G-CSF biosimilar and plerixafor. Short term recovery of platelet and neutrophil counts after auto-PBSCT, and safety profi le post-PBSCT were found to be comparable with that of the patient subgroup receiving plerixafor plus originator fi lgrastim. These data show the combination of biosimilar fi lgrastim and plerixafor is effective and provides a non-toxic approach to mobilise stem cells. Background: Stem cell mobilization is diffi cult in a signifi cant proportion of patients intended for ASCT. Recently plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, has become for clinical use to facilitate more effective mobilization of blood stem cells in patients who appear to mobilize poorly. We have evaluated our experience on plerixafor use added to chemomobilization. Patients and Methods: Between VIII/2009 and IX/2011 altogether 40 patients have received plerixafor pre-emptively in our hematology ward. There were 15 females and 25 males (median age of 57 years, range 20-68 years). Twenty-nine patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, seven patients myeloma and four patients Hodgkin lymphoma. The indications to use plerixafor included low blood CD34+ (B-CD34+) counts (median 4 x 10 6 /L) at the time of marrow recovery (n=30), poor prior collection (<1 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells) (n=7) and/or low/decreasing B-CD34+ counts (n=3). The median number of plerixafor injections was 1 (1) (2) (3) (4) . Results : The median fold increase in B-CD34+ cell counts to the next morning after the fi rst plerixafor dose was 4. Stem cell collections were started altogether in 34 patients (81%). The median number of CD34+ cells collected was 2.9 x 10 6 /kg (0.5-7 .8 x 10 6 /kg) with median of two aphereses. The minimum collection target (\u22652 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cells) was achieved in 31 patients (78%). In six patients the maximum B-CD34+ cell counts were only 1-6 x 10 6 /L and no aphereses were attempted. The nine patients who failed to reach the minimum collection target were comparable to successful mobilizers in regard to gender (males 67% vs. 61) %), age (59 vs. 57 years) or diagnosis (myeloma vs. lymphoma) (29% vs. 24%). Patients who failed the minimum collection target had lower B-CD34+ counts before plerixafor (median <1 vs. 7 x 10 6 /L, p<0.001) as well after the fi rst plerixafor dose (2 vs. 41 x 10 6 /L, p<0.001). If those patients with suboptimal collections are excluded, all patients who failed the collection had the peak B-CD34+ counts \u226410 x 10 6 /L after 1-4 plerixafor injections. Conclusions: Plerixafor in effi cient in the majority of chemomobilized patients mobilizing poorly or having poor collections. Baseline characteristics are not different in those failing to mobilize even with the addition of plerixafor, except for lower B-CD34+ counts.",

Jantunen (1) Background: Mobilization and collection of blood stem cells is diffi cult in a signifi cant proportion of patients intended for autologous stem cell transplantation. Recently a CXCXR4 antagonist, plerixafor, has been approved for clinical use in patients who appear to mobilize poorly but algorithms for optimal use of this expensive drug are lacking. We have therefore analyzed kinetics of blood CD34+ cells (B-CD34+) mobilization in relation to recovery of white blood cell (WBC) counts after chemomobilization in poor and standard mobilizers to fi nd out in which circumstances to use plerixafor. Patients and Methods: Altogether 390 chemomobilized patients were included into this retrospective analysis. We classifi ed patients with maximum B-CD34+ cell counts \u22645 x 10 6 /L as very poor mobilizers, those with maximum B-CD34+ cell counts 6-10x10 6 /L as poor mobilizers, and patients with collections \u22652 x 10 6 /kg CD34+ cell with maximum of three aphereses as standard mobilizers, respectively. Results: There were 43 patients (11%) fulfi lling the criteria for poor or inadequate mobilization. The proportion was highest in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17%) followed by Hodgkin lymphoma (9 %) and myeloma (3%). In these patients B-CD34+ counts rarely rose after recovery of WBC > 5-10x10 9 /L unlike the situation in standard mobilizers. Considering all patients having B-CD34+ peak \u2264 10 x 10 6 /L as candidates for preemptive plerixafor use, four algorithms were constructed: model A WBC > 5 x 10 9 /L and B-CD34+ \u2264 5 x 10 6 /L, model B WBC > 5 S240 x 10 9 /L and B-CD34+ \u2264 10 x 10 6 /L, model C WBC > 10 x 10 9 /L and B-CD34+ \u22645 x 10 6 /L, and model D WBC > 10 x 10 9 /L and B-CD34+ \u2264 10 x 10 6 /L. Of these models B and D were the best (sensitivity 0.97 and 1.0, respectively) but model B was more widely applicable in poor mobilizers in this series. Conclusions: Based on this retrospective study, plerixafor should be considered in chemomobilized patients if WBC is rising and > 5 x 10 9 /L and B-CD34+ cell count remain \u226410 x 10 6 /L. This simple model needs a prospective validation.",

Sancho (1) Background and Objective: Mobilization failure of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) constitutes a frequent reason for not performing autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM). Pre-emptive or immediate salvage mobilization with plerixafor through early identifi cation of poor mobilizers could avoid repeated attempts of mobilization, decreasing resource utilization, morbidity and delaying of SCT. Patients and Methods: Data from fi rst mobilization of 287 patients with lymphoma or MM consecutively referred to a transplant unit for autologous SCT between 2000 and 2010 were collected. Poor mobilization was defi ned as the collection of CD34+ cell dose of less than 2x10 6 /Kg BW. Results: Median of age was 54 years (range 9-70) and 180 (63%) were males. Diagnosis was multiple myeloma (MM) in 133 cases, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 112, and Hodgkin's lymphoma in 42. A total of 34 patients has received 3 or more therapy lines, including alkylating agents in 225 (78 %), purine analogues in 30 (11%) and radiotherapy in 47 (16%). At the time of mobilization 103 (37%) patients were in complete remission (CR) whereas 184 had active disease. Mobilization regimen consisted of G-CSF in 245 patients (85%) and chemotherapy followed by G-CSF (C + G-CSF) in 42 (15%). Poor mobilization was observed in 73 patients (25%) (36% in lymphomas and 13% in MM), without differences according to mobilization schedule. At the multivariate analysis, diagnosis, previous therapy with purine analogues, prior chemotherapy lines \u2265 3 and low platelet count were predictive factors for poor mobilization. A CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood (PB) higher than 13.8 CD34 cells /\u03bcL was enough to ensure adequate PBSC collect (\u22652x106 CD34+ cells/Kg BW), with high sensitivity (91%) and specifi city (91%). Conclusions: The prevalence of poor mobilization was high. The diagnosis of lymphoma (compared to MM), therapy with purine analogs or multiple chemotherapy regimens and low platelet count were associated with mobilization failure. A peak CD34+ cell count in PB <13.8/\u03bcL was associated with harvest of <2x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg BW and can be useful to guide preemptive or immediate plerixafor.

At present, G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are the preferred stem cell source for autologous HSCT. Fludarabine and lenalidomide are essential drugs in the front line treatment of NHL and MM respectively. Data suggests that fl udarabine and lenalidomide may have a deleterious effect on stem cell mobilization. Prior to the drug approval in Europe, a plerixafor compassionate use program (CUP) was available from July 2008 to August 2010 to provide access to the drug for patients with MM or lymphoma who had previously failed a mobilization attempt, and who were not eligible for another plerixafor trial. In the European CUP, 48 patients (median age 57 years; range, 36-69), previously treated with fl udarabine (median 5 cycles; range, 1-7 cycles) were given plerixafor plus G-CSF for remobilization following a primary mobilisation attempt.

In fl udarabine-exposed patients, only 58% of patients will achieve successful salvage mobilization with plerixafor plus G-CSF, suggesting the need for large prospective studies evaluating the effi cacy of plerixafor for frontline mobilization in this patients. Stem cell transplantation is an integral part of the management of several haematological disorders and autologous S241 transplantation is part of standard of care in myeloma and relapsed lymphomas. Historically around 30% of all patients fail to mobilise suffi cient CD34+ cells, thus are potentially denied access to this standard of care. Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist was approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium in January 2010 within its licensed indication for patients with lymphoma and myeloma whose stem cells mobilise poorly. Mobilisation with GCSF and Plerixafor costs around 16 times more than with cyclophosphamide and GCSF. Therefore we need to identify the most cost-effective way of using Plerixafor. From our local apheresis database, we identifi ed all stem cell collection attempts and the dose of CD34+ cells collected, from January 2000 to July 2011. Over this 11\u00bd year period, stem cell collection was attempted on 389 occasions from 371 individuals. 30 of these were healthy donors who readily mobilised suffi cient numbers of stem cells. Locally we aim for a minimum autologous collection of 3.5x10 6 CD34+ cells/Kg body weight. 100 collections (25.7%) failed to reach this threshold. 13.6% failed to mobilise our minimum accepted threshold for autologous stem cell transplantation of 2x10 6 /Kg CD34+ cells. 18 patients were mobilised with Plerixafor. Most had failed previous mobilisation attempts with standard regimens. 3 were felt to be at high risk of mobilisation failure, therefore received Plerixafor up front. CD34+ doses collected ranged from 1.01-22.4x10 6 /Kg and 16 patients (89%) achieved the minimum stem cell dose required of >2x10 6 /Kg. There was a linear relationship between peripheral blood CD34 counts and CD34+ dose collected (correlation coeffi cient 0.74). 75% of patients with peak peripheral blood CD34 counts of <15x10 6 /L, failed to mobilise 2x10 6 /Kg CD34+ cells.

Konstantinov, D. Bobev Specialized Hospital for POH (Sofi a, BG) High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support is a salvage treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Plerixafor (Mozobil) is a selective and reversible CXCR4 antagonist and interrupts interaction of CXCR4 with SDF-1, thus resulting in rapid mobilization of stem cells in peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation. We present our experience with mobilization of PBSC using Plerixafor plus G-CSF. Between March 2010 and May 2011 eight patients with different cancers were mobilized with Plerixafor plus G-CSF and seven of them later were transplanted with autologous graft in our center. The median age was 27, 5 years (7-44). Three of the patients were children. Four patients were with Hodgkin disease (two children and two adults), one with NHL, one with multiple myeloma and two with germ cells tumors (1 child and 1 adult). Five patients had previously one and three patients -two unsuccessful mobilizations. Plerixafor was obtained on a compassionate basis from Genzyme Bulgaria. In six patients mobilization not including chemotherapy was started during patient's hematological steady state with a 4-day subcutaneous administration of G-CSF at 10 \u03bcg/kg once daily. In the evening of the day 4 and in some patients on the day 5 and 6, at 11 h before apheresis, Plerixafor at 240 \u03bcg/kg was subcutaneously administered. G-CSF was given on day 5, 6 and 7 at 1 h before apheresis. In two patients Plerixafor was administrated before the second leukapheresis after mobilization with chemotherapy and G-CSF due to very low collected cells count after fi rst leukapheresis. Three patients underwent one apheresis, three patients two and two patients three aphereses. Median collected CD34+ cells from one apheresis was 3,25x10 6 /kg (0, 93) . Only in one patient the collected CD34+ cells number after 2 applications of Plerixafor was not suffi cient for transplantation (\u22642 x10 6 /kg). Seven of the patients were transplanted successfully after a different long period from collection. Based on this report and the reviewed literature, we consider G-CSF and Plerixafor to be a suitable combination for PBSC mobilization in patients with different malignant diseases and failures in previous conventional mobilization attempts. Myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant are traditionally harvested using high dose G-CSF (fi lgrastim) for stem cell mobilisation. Pegylated G-CSF (Peglasta) is G-CSF bound covalently to a 20kDa PEG molecule which increases the serum half-life of G-CSF due to decreased renal elimination. We present a non-randomised, prospective study of a single-centre experience in 37 myeloma patients who underwent stem cell mobilisation, of which 7 (19%) patients had Peglasta, over the time period from Dec 2006 to Jul 2011. All the myeloma patients were treated with bortezomib-based regimen for 4-6 cycles before stem cell harvesting. After induction therapy with vinorelbine 25 mg/m 2 Day 1 and cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m 2 Day 2, each patient was given a single dose of Peglasta 6mg at Day 4 or daily doses of fi lgrastim at 10mcg/kg/day from Day 4 onwards till stem cell harvesting at Day 8 (at least 5 doses in total). Median patient age was 54 (range 40-67); 12 patients were female. Both Peglasta and fi lgrastim patients had their stem cell harvesting done at a similar median time of 8 days (7-9) following induction therapy,. During stem cell harvesting, 15 litres (approximately 3 blood volumes) are processed using COBE Spectra\u00ae cell separator. Our local institutional minimum CD34+ dose for subsequent double autologous transplant was 6x10 6 /kg. The success rate in achieving the minimum CD34+ dose in the Peglasta group was 42% (3/7) at fi rst day of harvesting and 100% (4/4) at 2nd day of harvesting. In the fi lgrastim group, the success rate in achieving the minimum CD34+ dose was 33% (10/30) at fi rst day of harvesting, and 90% (18/20) at 2nd day of harvesting. In the Peglasta group, the median CD34+ dose ultimately achieved was 9.94 x 10 6 /kg (6.16-19.87), after a median of 2 aphereses per patient (range 1-3). Compared with the fi lgrastim group, median CD34+ dose ultimately achieved was 12.8 x 10 6 /kg (5.44-32.83) , after a median of 2 aphereses per patient (range 1-3). This study demonstrates that a single dose of Peglasta is comparable to that of fi lgrastim in the time for stem cell harvesting post induction and success rate in achieving the minimum CD34+ dose. The advantages of using Peglasta are drug savings of approximately US$420 to each individual patient as well as a reduction of 4 days of subcutanous injection. Future studies evaluating the optimal dose, timing of Peglasta as well as long-term outcome in larger cohorts of patients would be required.",

            "text": "Pegfi lgrastim is superior compared to fi lgrastim after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant in patients treated for lymphoma and multiple myeloma Z. Koristek, H. Svabova, Z. Kral, J. Mayer Masaryk University Hospital Brno (Brno, CZ) Introduction: To reduce the duration of neutropenia after highdose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is commonly administered. Pegylated fi lgrastim (pegG-CSF) has different pharmacokinetics than fi lgrastim (G-CSF) and, therefore, the neutrophil recovery could be faster. Shorter duration of neutropenia, lower risk of severe infection complications, shorter hospitalizations, and lower costs could be the results. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of pegG-CSF compared to G-CSF in patients with lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and other gammapathies. Patients and Methods: We compared 50 consecutive patients treated in our institution from 6/2010 to 7/2011, who received peg-CSF day +1 after high-dose chemotherapy (Mel200, Mel 140, BEAM) for lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and other gammapathies with 51 patients previously treated patients, who received G-CSF from day+7 (80%) or earlier until neutrophil engraftment. Thirteen patients were fi rst transplanted with G-CSF and later with pegG-CSF. Both groups were comparable with no signifi cant difference in age, sex, weight, diagnosis, high-dose chemotherapy, CD34+ cell and CFU-GM doses. Results: Duration of neutropenia (GRN<0.5) was signifi cantly (p<0,01) shorter in pegG-CSF group (2-9, median 5 days) compared to G-CSF group (3-15, median 6 days). Similar results were observed for time to GRN>0.5 (9 vs. 11 days, p<0,001), GRN>1 (p<0,001), and WBC>1 (p<0,001). Number of days in hospital after transplant was also signifi cantly lower in pegG-CSF group (9-22, median 13) compared to G-CSF group (11-30, median 14, p<0,005) . There were no differences in duration of thrombocytopenia and time to platelet engraftment (>20 and >50) as well as in numbers of days with fever, with iv. antibiotics, and with parenteral nutrition. Conclusion: Based on our experience we conclude that pegfi lgrastim given in a single dose on day +1 after autologous transplant has a superior effect on leukocyte and granulocyte engraftment compared to daily dose of fi lgrastim as well as on the length of hospitalization after transplantation in patients with lymphomas and gammapathies. The same results were seen in subgroups of patients transplanted fi rst with G-CSF support and later transplanted with pegG-CSF support. Introduction: We investigated on two cohorts the effi cacy and safety of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization by either the biosimilar or the reference G-CSF. Material and Methods: We analyzed two cohorts, one cohort of 11 patients and donors receiving the biosimilar Ratiograstim\u00ae versus another cohort of 11 patients and donors receiving reference G-CSF for the parameters described below. Results: In HD receiving subcutan. Ratiograstim\u00ae, WBC counts in the peripheral blood ranged from 29.9 G/L to 64.6 G/L (mean 48.9 G/L) and the CD34+ cells count from 19.3/\u03bcl to 114.6\u03bcl (mean 67.6/\u03bcl). In a mean of 1.45 apheresis procedures 172.5x10 6 up to 494x10 6 CD34+ cells (mean 354.7x10 6 ) were collected. This resulted in CD34+ cell numbers of 2.28x10 6 up to 1x10 7 (mean 5.17x10 6 ) per kg body weight of the patients. Grafts contained 0.77 up to 2.55 x10 10 (mean 1.45 x10 10 ) CD3+ T cells and 3.71 up to 9.90 x10 10 (mean 6.98 x10 10 ) nucleated cells (NC). In HD receiving subcutan. the reference G-CSF, WBC counts ranged from 27.1 G/L up to 62.5 G/L (mean 43.3 G/L) and the CD34+ cell counts from 13.55/\u03bcl up to 122.4/\u03bcl (mean 57.3/\u03bcl). A mean of 1.27 apheresis procedures were necessary to collect 181.74x10 6 up to 598.00x10 6 CD34+ cells (mean 370.49x10 6 ) absolutely. This translates into 2.33x10 6 up to 7.9x10 6 (mean 4.95x10 6 ) CD34+ cells per kg body weight of the patients. Grafts contained 1.01 up to 2.31 x10 10 (mean 1.55 x10 10 ) CD3+ T cells and 3.61 up to 9.55 x10 10 (mean 5.57 x10 10 ) NC. In the Ratiograstim\u00ae cohort, patients regenerated WBC >0.5 and >1 G/L within 13 and 14 days, neutrophils >0.5 G/L within 15 days and platelets >50 G/L within 17 days. In the reference G-CSF group, patients regenerated WBC >0.5 and >1 G/L within 14 and 16 days, neutrophils >0.5 G/L within 17 days and pletelets >50 G/L within 15 days. No differences in side effects were observed in both cohorts. Summary: Effi cacy and safety of the biosimilar Ratiograstim\u00ae, when compared to the reference G-CSF, was comparable in our cohort of patients in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Sever, D. Domanovic, B. Vrtovec, L. Lezaic, J. Pretnar, G. Poglajen, A. Socan, D. Zontar, P. Cernelc University Medical Center Ljubljana (Ljubljana, SI) Introduction: Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) fi lgrastim is standard of care in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization either as monotherapy or in combination after chemotherapy. Biosimilars such as TevaGrastim were extensively studied in the setting of neutropenia in cancer patients. They were also licensed for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization for which clinical experience is limited. Methods: We performed autologous HSC transplant intracoronary or intramyocardialy for advanced heart failure in eligible patients on waiting list for the heart transplant. Biosimilar TevaGrastim was used for bone marrow stem cell mobilization according to standard protocol 10 \u03bcg/kg body weight daily for fi ve days. On day fi ve CD34+ cell level above 15x10 6 /l was considered adequate for the start of apheresis. Peripheral HSC collection was performed using Amicus cell separator. Results: Twenty four patients (men=20) with dilative (n=17) and ischemic (n=7) cardiomiopathy were mobilized with TevaGrastim. Their median age was 59 (24-68) years. TevaGrastim was administered for fi ve (4-6) days. On day 5 the median white blood cell count, CD34+ cell count and their percentage were 46.8 (25.0-70.1) x10 9 /l, 28.49 (7.5-167.72) x10 6 /l and 0.11% (0.02-0.37), respectively. Three patients were poor mobilizers not reaching 15x10 6 /l CD34+ cells level. No serious adverse event was observed with only mild muscle and bone pain (n=4). Conclusion: Use of biosimilar G-CSF TevaGrastim in HSC mobilization is feasible with success rates similar to fi lgrastim S244 according to our experience and historic reports by others with comparable side effects. Further studies in other patient groups and long term follow up are necessary.",

A single-centre experience AY Oliva, A. S\u00e1nchez, C. Notario, P. R\u00edos, J. Bre\u00f1a, C. Marrero, N. Hern\u00e1nz, M. R\u00edos, V. Afonso, A. Cabello, M. Trujillo, M.C. Mesa, S. Jover, M. Herrera, G. P\u00e9rez, J. Garcia-Talavera Hospital Universitario Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Candelaria (Santa Cruz de Tenerife, ES) Introduction: The number of CD 34 + cells collected is essential for proper hematopoietic graft in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). To mobilizate hematopoietic progenitors (HP) changes of mechanisms of adhesion and microenvironment are needed. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with chemoterapy have been used as mobilizers to obtain HP. G-CSF has proven effective as a single mobilizing agent altering these adhesion mechanisms. Methods: We reviewed data of mobilization with G-CSF as a single agent in transplant patients (auto-HSCT) in our center over a period of 13 years (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . All HP apheresis were performed with the cell separator CS-3000plus Fenwall (Baxter). We reviewed a) variables prior to mobilization: diagnosis, sex, age, prior chemotherapy, b) variables related to mobilization: mobilization schemes with G-CSF, number of mobilizations, apheresis number and CD34+/kg number obtained (measured by fl ow cytometry), and c) post mobilization and autologous transplantation variables: median graft days for neutrophils (> 0.5 x 10e9 / L) and platelets (> 20 x 10e9 / L on two consecutive days). Results: 125 patients were mobilized, 84 men and 61 women, who subsequently underwent auto-HSCT. The median age was 52 (15-69) years. The diagnoses were: a) Multiple Myeloma (n=64), b) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=36), c) Hodgkin lymphoma (n=20), d) acute leukemias (n=17), e) plasma cell leukemias (n=4), f) Solid tumors (breast and germ) (n=4). The median number of previous treatment lines was 2 in all conditions except in Multiple Myeloma (MM), that was 1 (in 89% of MM). The mobilizing scheme used was G-CSF at doses of 10 \u03bcg/kg/12h, collecting on the fi fth day. The type of access used was Hickman catheter (73%) and Quinton-Mahurca (27%). The mean volemia processed was 2, needing a single apheresis in 115 patients. 14 requires 2 mobilizations. The average CD34 +/ kg collected was 2.7 (1-9) x 10 6 /kg of actual weight. Average days to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 12 and 17, respectively, without registering any graft failure. Conclusions: Our experience shows that mobilization with G-CSF is a simple and effective method for obtaining an adequate number of CD34 for leukocyte and platelet graft in auto-HSCT, independently of diagnosis and treatment used. Bendamustine is a bifunctional alkylating agent with promising activity in Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma (MM). A prospective, randomized, phase III trial demonstrated that bendamustine in combination with prednisone (BP) was superior to the standard combination of melphalan/prednisone (MP) with respect to complete response rate, mean number of cycles to maximum response, time to treatment failure and quality of life in patients with newly diagnosed MM (Poenisch et al, Res Clin Oncol 132: 205-212; 2006) . Unfortunately, the previous development of this agent did not provide suffi cient information on stem cell toxicity and mobilization of stem cells for autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) after Bendamustine therapy. A retrospective analysis of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and autologous SCT was performed in 63 patients with multiple myeloma who had received Bendamustine pretreatment at the university Hospitals Leipzig and Heidelberg over a period of sixteen years. Patients had a median age of 59 (range, 31-72) years. The cumulative dosis of Bendamustine per patient was 960 (range 120-2400) mg/qm and was administered during a median of three (range 1-10) cycles. The mobilization regimen consisted of Cyclophosphamide 4g/qm (n=41) or 7g/qm (n=4) and G-CSF (2x5ug/kg). Alternative regimens such as CAD, CED, TCED and others were also used in the remaining patients. Apheresis was started as soon as peripheral blood CD34+ counts exceeded 10x10 6 /l with a harvest target of 4x106 CD34+/kg using 4 times the blood volume. The minimal accepted target was 2x10 6 CD34+/kg. Stem cell mobilization and harvest was successful in 60 of the 63 patients (95%). In 19 of 60 patients (32%) a single apharesis was suffi cient to reach the target. The median number of aphareses was two (range 1-7) and the median CD34+ cell-count/kg was 5.9 (range 1.7-20.4) x10 6 . Information on autologous SCT is available from all 60 patients with successful harvest. Engraftment was successful in 59 of 60 patients. The median time to leucocytes count >l\u00d710 9 /l was reached after 12 days and the time to untransfused platelet count of >50\u00d710 9 /l was 14 days. 54 patients (90%) responded after the autologous SCT with 6 CR, 4 nCR, 12 VGPR, and 32 PR. The event free survival at 36 months was 31% and overall survival was 68%. In conclusion, the stem cell mobilization and autologous SCT is feasible in multiple myeloma patients who have received Bendamustine pretreatment.",

Richardson Gloucester Hospitals Trust (Gloucester, UK) Standard treatment of Multiple Myeloma has changed with combination regimes of Vincristine, Adriamycin and Dexamethasone (VAD) being superseded by newer chemo-therapeutic approaches or novel agents. Consolidation of fi rst line S246 treatment with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) is still considered treatment of choice. However, the impact of novel agents upon peripheral blood stem cell collection (PBSCC) has not yet been explored. This small centre retrospective study of PBSCC yields in patients who have only received one line of treatment, Cyclophosphamide, Thalidomide and Dexamethosone (CTD), VAD or CVAD (with the inclusion of Cyclophosphamide). Local anecdotal evidence suggested that collection and yield were not as successful in patients who received CTD as compared with VAD/CVAD. Clinical discussion appeared to indicate that the combination of Cyclophosphamide and Thalidomide may inhibit stem cell mobilisation. Data on CD34 yield obtained at apheresis were collected for patients attending NHSBT for PBSCC from 2006 to 2011. Sixty fi ve patients were identifi ed, representing 87 PBSCC episodes. These patients were subdivided by fi rst line therapy received. Patients who had received multiple chemotherapy regimes prior to collection were excluded from the analysis. The desired therapeutic yield for each patient was a minimum of CD34 2.0. Twenty six patients were identifi ed as having received CTD only prior to PBSCC. This accounted for 36 PBSCC episodes, averaging 1.38 collections per person to achieve minimum therapeutic dose. Four patients failed to achieve minimum collection and did not proceed to SCT. The average yield per patient for the CTD group was 3.03; 2.19 per PBSCC episode. The yield obtained in a single PBSCC episode (duration 1-3 days) ranged from 0.82 to 6.97, excluding those who failed to collect a measurable amount of stem cells. The comparison group was patients who received either VAD or CVAD at fi rst line. This cohort is 11 patients. They represent 13 PBSCC episodes with a mean yield per collection of 3.26 and per person of 3.86. These fi gures are notably higher than that the mean yields obtained in the CTD group. Additionally, the VAD or CVAD group had a lower incidence of failed collection and a mean of 1.18 collections per patient. Analysis found that the CTD cohort were twice as likely to require second mobilisation to achieve minimum therapeutic CD34 count.",

Milone (1) Identifi cation of factors able to predict mobilization failure could lead to use of Plerixafor already during fi rst mobilization, avoiding repetition of a second mobilization course. Clinical features already known at baseline, before start of mobilization, fail, however, to predict \"failure of mobilization\" in a sustantial number of patients. No data are available on predictive value of other parameters generated early during fi rst mobilization attempt. To address this issue, we studied the value of CD34 counts in PB measured early, at day +10, +11, +12 and +13, in predicting the mobilization outcome in the ensuing days. We have retrospectively collected data on patients at fi rst or second attempt of mobilization, affected by Multiple Myeloma or by Lymphoma that received as mobilizing treatment cyclophosphamide 4 gr/mq and G-CSF. Variability on kinetics of CD34 upsurge was studied in two hundred and thirty-three patients (Figure 1 ). To measure diagnostic value of PB CD34 value in respect of \"failure of mobilization\", we considered a failed mobilization as \"disease\" and value of CD34+ cells, at a specifi c day, in PB, as a \"diagnostic test\". We measured sensitivity (n\u00b0 of patients who had a positive test and a failed mobilization/all patients who failed mobilization); false positive rate (n\u00b0 of patients who had test positive and a successful mobilization/ all patients who had a successful mobilization); specifi city (negative test and successful mobilization/all patients who had a successful mobilization) and positive predictive value (n\u00b0 of patients who had a positive test and a failed mobilization/all patients with positive test). Different threshold of CD34 cells (CD34 in PB= 6 cells/ mmc and 10 cells/mmc) at different time point (day 10th-11th -12th -13th) lead to results reported in table 1. A count of CD34+ cells below 10/mmc at day 13th had a high sensitivity and high specifi city in predicting a failure of mobilization. However, good predictive result was obtained using a lower threshold (CD34+: 6 cells/mmc) at a earlier time. Thus, to start \"early on demand\" Plerixafor for PBSC mobilization, it can be proposed to use a level of CD34 cells below 6/mmc at day 12th or a CD34 cell level below 10 cells/mmc at day 13th. The criteria we proposed to start early \"on demand Plerixafor\" have high positive predictive values and are, therefore, able to avoid an inappropriate use of this expensive agent.",

It is critical to know to which extent CD34+ mobilization failure or a poor CD34 harvest can be predicted in Myeloma (MM) patients using data available at start of mobilization. We evaluated in a retrospective study, factors already known at start of mobilization (baseline) for their predictive value in respect of failure of PBSC mobilization. Selection criteria was: diagnosis of MM, age below 70 years, fi rst attempt of PBSC mobilization done using CTX 4 gr/m 2 plus G-CSF, mobilizing attempt done during the years 2006-2011. A total of 171 mobilization were selected. As induction treatment, 98 patients received lenalidomide or thalidomide. Criteria used to start of apheresis was a PB CD34 value over 20 mmc. Logistic regression was utilized to study factors predictive for: a) a successful CD34+ cells mobilization (defi ned as a CD34 count in PB>20 cells/mmc). b) an harvest suffi cient for at least one High Dose treatment (defi ned as CD34+ dose >2x10e6/Kg). c) an harvest suffi cient for two High Dose treatments (defi ned as CD34+ dose >5x10e6/Kg). A failure of CD34 cell mobilization in PB was registered in 6% of patients, a failure to collect cells for 1 high dose treatment in 12.5% of all patients, a failure to collect cells for 2 high dose courses was registered in 36%.

All but one patient (98%) reached >15 CD34+ cells/uL in peripheral blood, which was required to start leukapheresis. Median level was 136 (5-780) CD34+ cells/uL. Leukaphereses started on day +14 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . 50 (98%) patients collected \u22652x10e6 CD34+ cells/kg with the median 15.6 (2-65.1), which was achieved with a single leukapheresis in 45 (90%) patients. 46 (90%) patients collected \u22654x10e6 CD34+ cells/kg required for tandem autoPBSCT. Results were compared with the historical control of 67 unselected patients with similar clinical characteristics, in whom mobilization was based on CTX (total 1.5-4 g/m2) +G-CSF. AraC+G-CSF was found signifi cantly more effective (see Table) .",

The level of mobilized CD34+ cells is four times higher compared to protocol based on CTX+G-CSF. Poor graft function (PGF) is defi ned as an inability to achieve adequate blood counts in at least two lines after allogeneic HSCT in the presence of complete donor hematopoietic cell chimerism and absence of viral reactivation, signs of GvHD or drug-related myelosupression. It could be primary, developing in the fi rst 28 days post-transplant, or secondary in case engraftment had already been achieved. The incidence of PGF after allogeneic HSCT varies from 5% to 27% in published reports. In this 2 center retrospective study we investigated the use of CD34\u00b1selected stem cell boost (SCB) without prior conditioning in 32 PGF patients (pts, male, n=22, female, n=10; median age of 54 years (20-69)). The median interval between HSCT and SCB was 5 months . The median amounts of CD34+ and CD3+ cells were 3.4x10 6 /kg b.w. (0.96-8.30 ) and 9x10 3 /kg b.w. . Hematological improvement (HI; neutrophils >1.5x10 9 /L, platelets >30x10 9 /L and hemoglobin >8.5 g/dL) was observed in 26/32 pts (81%). Almost 40% of pts showed signs of HI already at day +14 after boost. The recipients of related grafts responded earlier (day +20 vs. day +30, p=0.039) and more frequently (100% vs. 71%, p=0.07) than recipients of unrelated grafts. Pts experienced hematological response (neutrophils >2.5x10 9 /L, platelets >100x10 9 /L and hemoglobin >10 g/dL) were younger as non-responding pts (39 vs. 54 years, p=0.041) and received grafts from younger donors (35 vs. 43 years, p=0.036). The CD34+ and CD3+ cell doses had no impact on the HI/response. The incidence of acute and chronic GvHD was 17% and 26%, respectively. Pts with acute, but not chronic GvHD received a signifi cantly higher median CD3+ cell dose (32 vs. 8x10 3 /kg b.w., p=0.02). At a median follow up of 30 months (4 -107) a number of 16 pts (of those 5 no-responders) had died. The causes of death were: sepsis, n=8; aGvHD, n=3; cGvHD with concomitant infection, n=1; relapse/disease progression, n=3; cerebral hemorrhage, n=1. The 1-year probabilities of OS and PFS were 57% and 56%, respectively. The achievement of HI had a positive impact on the OS (HR 2.7; p=0.08).",

Patients and Methods: 54 patients (21 female, 33 male, age 55\u00b113 years) received autologous HSCT containing 7,5% DMSO. Underlying diseases were multiple myeloma (n=29), lymphoid neoplasia (n=14), acute leukemia (n=5), others (n=6). Blood samples were taken immediately before, 15 min and 16-18 hours after HSCT. We tested whole-blood platelet aggregation (adenosine-diphosphate [ADP 6.4mcM], collagen [COL 3.2 mcg/ml], thrombin receptor activating peptide [TRAP 32 mcM], and arachidonate [AA 0.5 mM]), fi brinogen (FBG), d-dimers (DD), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF: Ag), and cell-membrane microparticle activity (MPA) measured as thrombin-generation. Results: Mean MPA (16\u00b19 nM, 27\u00b118 nM, 14\u00b18 nM, p<0.001) and TAT (4\u00b12, 17\u00b113, 4\u00b14 mcg/L, p<0.001) increased signifi cantly immediately after HSCT, returning to baseline the day after. Minor but signifi cant changes were seen in FBG, DD and VWF:Ag. Only a trend for reduction of platelet aggregation with ADP (449\u00b1263, 380\u00b1277 AU, p=0.06) was found immediately after HSCT. Ten of 54 (19%) patients presented fever and/or urticaria immediately after transfusion of HSC, accompanied by higher VWF (p<0.01) but not DD, MPA, FBG or TAT changes. Engraftment was seen at 15\u00b17 days, no differences were found in patients with high increase of TAT or MPA. Patients with high increase in TAT or MPA had received signifi cantly higher numbers of total cells and higher transplant volumes. Discussion: We observed an activation of hemostasis, measured as increase of MPA and TAT immediately after HSCT. This effect is short-lasting and might be attributed to cell-components of the HSC preparation and/or DMSO. Engraftment was",

Chabannon (1) The main criteria to assess quality of autologous blood stem cell products that are obtained as the fi rst step for intensive chemotherapy supported with autologous transplantation is their content in CD34+ progenitors. However, CD34+ cells represent only a minor fraction of collected cells that are diluted in maturing and terminally differentiated cells, especially of the monocytic and neutrophil lineages. We and others have shown that contamination of collected blood cell therapy products with with high numbers of cells of the neutrophil lineage produce deleterious effects at various stages of subsequent processing, as well as predispose to the occurrence of grade III-IV adverse events at the time of infusion. We compared the neutrophil contamination of paired aphaeresis products alternatively obtained by using the Terumo BCT SPECTRA (semi-automated program v4.7) and OPTIA cell separators in 18 adult patients (9 with lymphoma, 3 with myeloma, 5 with solid tumors and 1 with AML) candidate for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation at a single JACIE-accredited program. Ten patients were collected during the G-CSF supported recovery phase of cytopenia induced by myelo-suppressive chemotherapy (\"chemotherapy + rhG-CSF\"). 8 patients were collected after mobilization with rhG-CSF alone. The average numbers of neutrophils were 32 x 10 9 \u00b1 25.5 and 51.7 x 10 9 \u00b1 51.2 in products collected with the OPTIA and SPECTRA cell separators respectively (p = 0.09). When focusing on the subset of 8 patients mobilized with rhG-CSF who displayed more stable blood counts over the two consecutive days when they underwent aphaeresis, a similar difference was observed (22.8 x 10 9 \u00b1 17.8 and 38.4 x 10 9 \u00b1 27.1; p=0.08). The percentages of neutrophils in aphaeresis products were not different with the two cell separators.

            "text": "Introduction: Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients less than 65 years old. Although CD34+ cell number is the most important factor in predicting neutrophil and platelet engraftment, adhesion receptor molecules on stem cells have been shown to modulate homing and engraftment after transplantation. Objectives: To defi ne and correlate the pattern of different cell adhesion receptor expression by the CD34+ cells from apheresis products with the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in MM patients undergoing autologous PBSCT. Patients and methods: A total of 22 newly diagnosed MM patients (12 male, 10 female; median age 51 years, range 32-70) who received autologous PBSCT were retrospectively evaluated. According to ISS, 10 pts (45.5%) were in stage I, 7 pts (31.8%) in stage II and 5 pts (22.7%) in stage III. Different induction based therapies were used: lenalidomide (5 pts), bortezomib (7 pts) and VAD like (10 pts). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on cryopreserved apheresis samples, using the following three colours antibodies combinations (FITC/PE/PerCP): CD34/CD11a/CD45, CD34/CD44/CD45, CD34/CD49d/CD45, CD34/CD49e/CD45, CD34/CD184/CD45. All CD34+ cell subsets were correlated with the kinetics of early haematopoietic engraftment following auto-PBSCT. Results: All patients undergoing autologous PBSCT received at least 2.0x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. Median CD34+ cell number/ kg infused was 4.90x10 6 /kg (range: 2.50-13.80). The median time to achieve early engraftment of neutrophils (ANC>500 \u03bcL) and platelets (plt>20000 \u03bcL) was 11 days (range 9-14) and 13 days (range 9-30), respectively. Spearman correlations showed that higher expression of CD34+/CD49d+ signifi cantly correlated with more rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment after transplant (r=-0.44, p=0.03 for ANC and r=-0.50, p=0.01 for plts, respectively). In addition, the number of infused CD34+/ CD11a+ (p=0.02), CD34+/CD49e+ (p=0.02) and CD34+/ CD184+ (p=0.03) better correlated with the time to plt engraftment than that of infused CD34+ cells (p=0.05). Conclusion: Haematopoietic stem cells infused expressing high level of CD34+/CD49d+ best predicted early neutrophil and platelet reconstitution in MM patients after autologous transplant. (1), MJ Majado (2) Background and Objectives: In the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the bone marrow, apheresis has been described to have a mobilizing effect, so that the processing of more than three volume blood volumes increase the yield of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). For this reason large volumes apheresis (LVA) are processed in some centres. The aim of this study is to establish if LVA is equally effi cient in patients with low pre-apheresis CD34+ cells than in those with higher counts. Material and Methods: LVA performed in the past ten years in our hospital are reported. Four times the calculated blood volume have been processed in each apheresis. Mononuclear cells (MNC), CD34+ cells and clonogenic CFU-GM and BFU-E measures were performed: in peripheral blood pre-apheresis, in the product obtained after the fi rst two volumes (1st bag) and after the second two volumes (2nd bag). Recovery of these variables in each one of the two bags was calculated as percentage of the pre-apheresis values; and the results of the two bags were compared. Results: A total of 517 apheresis, performed to 352 patients, were included; the median of the pre-apheresis CD34+ cells was 8.8/microL. Results are shown in the table. Curiously, the recovery of CD34+ cells in both bags was signifi cantly higher (111 % and 146%) in the group lower than in the higher preapheresis (86% and 99%) CD34+ cells, p<0.001. The cell cultures gave variable results; whilst CFU-GM recovery was higher in the group with more basal CD34+ cells, BFU-E recovery was lower in the same group. Conclusions: LVA is equally effective in all patients, independently of the basal amount of CD34+ cells, allowing the recovery of signifi cant number of PBPCs in poor mobilizer patients (almost 20% of all cases with autologous transplantation indication). Our results agree with the mobilizing role of the apheresis itself.",

Parody (1) Background: In order to preserve 100% viability of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (PBSC), the standard practice in allogeneic stem cell transplant in most centers is to infuse PBSC collected the same day or the day before transplantation (SCT). To obtain and freeze PBSC prior to SCT would be desirable in order to get a better logistic and to confi rm the availability and quality of the product in unrelated SCT prior the exposure of the patient to the conditioning regimen. Unfortunately comparative studies are lacking AIM: In this retrospective study (period study 1997-2011) we report all products consecutively obtained in three centers with different policy (Cryopreservation versus fresh infusion) to analyze the impact of using fresh (FSH) (N:107) or previously frozen (FRZ) PBSC (N 224) on overall outcomes in the setting of alloPBSCT from a matched related donor. Results: Both groups were paired in global characteristics although patients in the FSH group had a higher median age (47 vs 38) and more commonly received reduced intensity conditionings. Total CD34+ cells infused were slightly higher in the FRZ group (5.6 vs 5 x 10e6/kg, p=0.04), and engraftment (granulocytes more than 500/ml) were achieved earlier in the FRZ Group (14 vs 16 days, respectively; p=0.001), with no signifi cant differences on platelet recovery (13 days for both). Patients receiving FRZ PBSC had a higher incidence of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) (63 vs 44%, p <0.001) mostly involving skin and liver, and at an earlier onset (13 vs 30 days, p <0.001). Grades II-IV aGVHD was more common in FRZ group (45 vs 30%, P 0.008). 28/57 (49%) vs 3/44 (13%) of cases of cutaneous aGVHD were diagnosed before 14 days in the FRZ group. Response to fi rst line treatment with corticoids was similar in both groups (87 vs 80% in FRZ and FSH group respectively). No statistically signifi cant differences were found regarding chronic GVHD (58 vs 66%) nor overall survival (44 vs 48%), disease free-survival (39 vs 33%), non-relapse mortality (26 vs 19%) and relapse rates (29 vs 32%) in FRZ vs FSH group, respectively.",

Plerixafor may be added to G-CSF in patients who mobilize poorly or can be used in addition to chemomobilization to boost mobilization. Limited data is available on graft content collected after various mobilization methods in myeloma patients. Patients and Methods: Altogether grafts collected in 21 MM patients were analyzed. We analyzed CD34+ subclasses, lymphocyte subsets and plasmacytoid dendritic cells from cryopreserved grafts collected on the next morning after plerixafor injection in 10 MM patients mobilized with G-CSF with or without preceding cyclophosphamide. As controls we had the fi rst collections from 11 MM patients mobilized without plerixafor; all had received cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF. Results: The median CD34+ content of the analyzed grafts was 2.1 x 10 6 /kg in the plerixafor group compared to 4.0 x10 6 /kg in the controls (p = 0.006). The proportion of the most primitive stem cells (CD34+, CD133+, CD38-) from all CD34+ cells in the graft was higher in the plerixafor group (3.5% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.001). The amount of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ lymphocytes as well as NK cells in the graft tended to be higher in the plerixafor group. Proportion of nonviable lymphocytes and the amount of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was comparable between the groups. The detailed data is presented in Table 1 . Altogether 18 patients have been treated with high-dose chemo therapy. No treatment-related mortality was seen. The median time to reach neutrophils >0.5 x 10 9 /L was 11 days in the plerixafor group and 10 days in the control group. Time to reach platelets >20 x 10 9 /L was also comparable (11 d vs. 10 d, respectively.). Conclusions: Plerixafor seems to have an effect on graft cell composition in myeloma patients mobilizing poorly with traditional regimens.

This quality control should be made 14 days before the reinfusion to have the result of the functional test on the proliferative capacity of haematopoietic progenitors. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the potential of the Nucleocounter NC-3000 (Chemometec, Denmark) in our clinical routine. Methods: The study was performed on 62 vials control that were carried out on HPC-A from 40 patients with various onco-hematologic malignancies. The number of total and viable CD34+ cells and viability were evaluated using 1 mL of thawed samples taken after DMSO washing. Viability was measured by the ISHAGE guidelines. The proliferative potential was assessed by specifi c clonogenic tests using a commercial medium. Furthermore, we evaluated the cellular functionality with NucleoCounter, by using two protocols: Vitality assay (analysis of the level of cellular thiols-GSH) and Mitochondrial potential assay (JC-1). Results: The viability evaluated through fl ow cytometry of CD45 +/7AAD-and CD45 +/CD34 +/7AAD-are of 58% (23.69-92.38, SD 17.88) and 82% (5.14-100, SD 22.63) respectively. The evaluation of cells in pre-apoptosis measured by JC-1 assay showed a negative correlation (r = -0.40) with the total number of colonies obtained after seeding of 50.000/ml viable cells. We observed a statistically signifi cant difference (p=0.009) comparing the median number of colonies (187.15&\u00b1SD 157.27) obtained with a value of JC-1 <30% to the number of colonies (41.77\u00b1SD 68.42) obtained with a value of JC-1>30%. No signifi cantly difference was observed between the median number of colonies obtained and the analysis of the level of cellular thiols.

This difference was statistically signifi cant (p=0.004). Conclusion: The effi cacy of the ICS led to an optimal purity without affecting the cell recovery, which resulted to be higher in the group 1. Overall, our data suggest that the Ficoll procedure for HPC-A concentrates before incubation of CD34+ is suitable for the clinical routine in the immunomagnetic cell selection for haploidentical stem cell transplantation in thalassemic patients. Background: High dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a well established treatment modality for some hematological malignancies. The number of CD34+ cells correlates with the leukapheresis CD34+ count and is a guide to the optimal timing to harvest peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). At present, the determination of CD34+ cells is performed by fl ow cytometry, however the method is time consuming and economically demanding. Detection of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) using hematology analyzer Sysmex XE-2100 is a quick and inexpensive test which is available as a part of complete blood count. HPCs are immature myeloid cells that are identifi ed according to the cell size and their inner density. We evaluated whether HPC count could refi ne the prediction of PBPC harvest beginning. Methods: From August 2007 to November 2011 we examined 133 persons before PBPC harvest (73 males, 60 females, median 59 years, range 19-68) suffering from multiple myeloma (n=79), lymphoma (n=139), acute leukemia (n=1), solid tumor (n=2), and also relative donors (n=12). In fi rst 54 patients we examined the HPC count in the peripheral blood (PB) before the collection and in the collection bag, in next 79 patients only the HPC count in PB before the collection. We correlated the amount of HPC with the CD34+ cells count using Spearman rank correlation coeffi cient to fi nd the minimum count of HPC for the optimal harvest beginning.",

However, the correlation of CD34+cells vs. HPC (R=0.244, n=254; CI=95%) in collection bag was very low. The HPC count 30/\u03bcl (sensitivity 92.3%, specifi city 60.3%) in PB may be considered for the minimum to start the PBPC collection. The HPC count 10/\u03bcl (high sensitivity -96.9%) in PB correlates with very low count level of CD 34 cells and may be the limit to exclude the collection. We established an algorithm to guide PBPC harvest beginning in our center. We begin with leukapheresis when the HPC count exceeded 30/\u03bcl. Conclusions: Enumeration of HPC appears to be very fast and an acceptable tool for the improvement of PBPC harvest. Our data show a close correlation between HPC and CD 34 cell counts in accord with some other reports. However, the CD 34+ cells remain a useful predictor for both the PBPC harvest timing and successful PBPC collection. Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is becoming a practical and realistic alternative to unrelated donor transplantation. In an effort to hasten immune reconstitution and reduce mortality from viral related complications, the Tubingen transplant group has pioneered the CD3/CD19 depletion procedure which is now practiced in several centers worldwide including Oman. The current technique involves the coordination of the conditioning, the PBSC collection and depletion procedure such that the fi nal product is ready for infusion on the scheduled transplant day. In view of the relatively short shelf life of the antibodies and due to logistical reasons of order and supply of reagents in Oman, we were faced with the possibility of the expiry of expensive antibodies at a signifi cant cost to the institution in case the trans-",

            "text": "Graft versus host disease (GvHD) can be prevented by Fas-mediated selective depletion of host-sensitized donor lymphocytes ex vivo. This fi nding, together with the known trophic effects that Fas-ligand (FasL) exerts on hematopoietic stem cells, makes FasL treatment an attractive tool for graft engineering to enhance engraftment while reducing the risk of GvHD in patients. Host sensitization of allografts is, unfortunately, a laborious and technically challenging procedure that is likely to have limited appeal in the clinical setting. We tested the hypothesis that brief incubation of lymphocytes with recombinant FasL in the absence of host-specifi c antigenic stimulation can also alleviate GvHD. Brief exposure (24 hours) of unstimulated donor lymphocytes to recombinant FasL ex vivo results in balanced apoptosis of CD8+ and CD4+ subsets, while maintaining sustained responses to mitogenic stimulation. Infusion of lymphocytes so treated in the context of haploidentical transplant under conditions conducive to the development of severe GvHD resulted in attenuated weight loss following transplant as compared to mice infused with untreated lymphocytes; the clinical and histological score of skin and gastrointestinal GvHD were similarly improved following FasL treated T cell-replete haploidentical stem cell transplantation as compared to controls. Fatal GvHD was not precipitated by subsequent administration of LPS to mice after transplant of FasL treated lymphocytes, as opposed to high mortality rates in control animals. Although FasL-resistant donor T cells that survived the ex vivo incubation are less potent effectors of GvHD, they continued to facilitate hematopoietic progenitor engraftment, retained responsiveness to third party antigens, and were capable of elaborating graft versus tumor reactions. These fi ndings in a preclinical model using a one-step culture procedure that can be easily performed in most clinical laboratories suggest that brief ex vivo incubation of hematopoietic grafts with FasL may improve the outcome and safety of clinical allogeneic and haploidentical transplants, abrogating the need for physical T-cell depletion. Introduction: Donor stem cells are traditionally infused fresh into recipients in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We investigated outcomes of 133 sibling allografts using cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells. Cryopreservation had no impact on engraftment when compared to data from registry studies. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were within acceptable limits. Methods: We identifi ed recipients of HLA-matched sibling peripheral stem cells cryopreserved for a minimum of 7 days, who underwent allo-SCT at Hammersmith Hospital from 1998 until 2011(n=133). Thirty-fi ve (26%) were transplanted for CML, 42(31%) for AML, 11(8%) for ALL, 14(11%) for myeloma and 13(10%) for other causes. Fifty-six (42%) had myeloablative and 77(58%) had reduced intensity conditioning. Using validated institutional protocols hematopoietic progenitor cell collections were cryopreserved the same day after collection or on following morning. Median CD-34+ cell dose infused was 9.83 \u00d710 6 /kg (range 2.4-33\u00d710 6 /kg). Engraftment was defi ned as a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5\u00d710 9 /L for 2 successive days and platelet count of >50\u00d710 9 /L for 2 consecutive days, both without support. Results: Overall 125(93%) achieved neutrophil engraftment and median time to engraftment was 19(range 10-42) days. Delayed neutrophil engraftment (>30 days) was present in 4 patients. Cumulative probability of achieving ANC> of 0.5\u00d710 9 /L for the whole cohort was 94%(88-95). One hundred and thirteen patients (84%) recovered platelets to >50\u00d710 9 /L within a median time of 21 (range 0-240) days.

Methods: 5x10e5 AML blasts were injected into 6-8 week-old irradiated (150cGy) NSG mice to achieve >1% AML engraftment in bone marrow (BM) within 18 d resembling minimal residual disease. Subsequently, 5x10e6 alloreactive CD8+ CTL expanded over 14, 21, 28, and 56 d in vitro were transfused into these mice. Controls consisted of mice receiving leukemia alone or AML and CTL of irrelevant antiviral specifi city. Mice were supplemented with human interleukin (IL)-2, IL7-Fc, and additionally IL-15 upon transfer of HLA-identical T cells. AML infi ltration was analyzed in kinetic studies 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, 7 d and 28 d after CTL transfer. Results: We observed complete eradication of FLT3-ITD+ AML blasts in BM, spleen and peripheral blood of mice one week after transfer of single HLA-mismatched CTL cultured for 14, 21, or 28 d, respectively. In contrast, control mice showed 25-61% (median, 35%) leukemia infi ltration in BM. Kinetic analysis demonstrated almost complete AML remission as early as 48 h after T cell transfer, and no relapse was detected for up to 42 d. Ex vivo analysis of CTL re-isolated 24 and 48 h after injection showed persistent reactivity to AML blasts, but not to NSG-derived murine dendritic cells. Interestingly, CTL expanded over 56 d in vitro appeared less capable to eradicate AML in vivo. Results were reproducible in 2 different donor-patient pairs. Moreover, signifi cant reduction of leukemia infi ltration could also be observed in mice that had received HLA-matched AML-reactive CTL (n=2). Further experiments on kinetics, T cell dose and repetitive injections are currently ongoing. Conclusion: We show herein that NSG mice engrafted with primary human AML blasts can be successfully treated with human alloreactive CTL. The model will be further optimized to serve as a general platform for testing the anti-leukemia effect of T cell grafts before adoptive transfer into humans.",

Buser, C. Bucher, S. Gerull, L. Graf, D. Heim, A. Rovo, J. Sigle, M. Stern, D. Tsakiris, J. Passweg, A. Tichelli University Hospital Basel (Basel, CH) Objectives: During bone marrow harvesting used for for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) large volumes of bone marrow are collected. To minimize the risk of ABO-induced transfusion reactions, volume overload during marrow transfusion and direct hemoglobin toxicity in case of the use of cryopreserved units, a volume reduction with red blood cell (RBC) depletion may be indicated. During each processing step it is critical to maintain an optimal CD34+ cell recovery. We present preliminary data of the new fully-automated Sepax 2 (Biosafe, Eysins, Switzerland) cell separation device, which has a versatile platform designed for effi cient processing of bone marrow. Methods: A two step approach was designed: fi rst a volume reduction to 50-150ml per maximal 880 mL initial bone marrow volume and secondly a density gradient based sedimentation to eliminate the residual RBCs. During this pilot phase only the surplus of the harvest (surplus of 2x10e8 total nucleated cell (TNC)/kg)) was processed. We evaluated TNC, CD34+ cells, and yield before and after each step, as well as the residual RBCs at the end of the procedure. Results: Within the last 6 months, we processed 4 bone marrow units. The volume processed ranged between 185 mL and 692 mL. The results of the volume reduction and RBC depletion are listed in Table 1 . In all four processed bone marrow units, the RBC depletion was effective, reaching values below the fi xed cut-off of 15ml needed in case of major ABO barrier. The CD34+ yield was diverse: two procedures ended with a yield of 90% or more, and two others with a yield of 32 and 37% respectively. The reason for this variability is not yet clear. In one case (BS 9511) it could be due to a bone marrow of an aged donor (over 65 year) with a high fat content. Volume reduction achieved good results in respect of CD34+ yield in all cases. In one case of unsatisfactory CD34 recovery (BS 8411) the rescue by re-processing the waste bag was tested: we could extract an absolute CD34+ cell count of 105.7x10e6. Discussion: Our preliminary results with the new Sepax 2 system look promising, approaching the results obtained with the standard methods of bone marrow processing with COBE Spectra or Amicus. This new method has the advantages to be fully automated and working as a closed system, which is mandatory to conform to the JACIE criteria of stem cell engineering.",

The new device (Sepax\u00ae 2) is also a fully-automated system with a versatile platform designed for effi cient processing of umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and other cellular material. The aim of the study was to compare the effi cacy of a new device, compared to the previous system for CBU volume reduction. Methods: In the Cord-Blood Bank Basel 110 CBU were processed with the new device from July 14th until end of October 2011. The results were compared with 195 processed CBU performed between January and July 13th 2011 with the previous Processing System. Following parameters were evaluated: total nucleated cell counts (TNC), absolute viable CD34+ cells at collection/before cryopreservation as well as recovery rates (Yields). According to the new rules of Swisscord (established since November 1st 2011) only CBU with a minimal TNC of 150 x10e7 at collection are processed. Thus, we were especially interested in the effi cacy of recovery in cord blood with high TNC counts. Results: There was no statistical difference between the two systems for TNC and CD34 counts before and after collection and no difference in overall recovery (Table 1) . We compared a subgroup of the CBU with TNC counts \u2265150x10e7 at collection (66 CBU with Sepax1; 45 with Sepax2). With the new device we found a signifi cant higher TNC count after processing (median 136.2 x10e7 (range, 70.-263.2) vs 146.0x10e7 (111.6-300.8; p 0.015) and an improved TNC-recovery (median 75.4%; range 40.0-91.3; vs 77.59%; range 63.3-86.9; p 0.029) as well (Figure 1 ). Conclusion: Overall both devices showed good TNC, CD34 counts after volume reduction and excellent recovery rates of TNC and CD34. In a subgroup of CBU with a higher TNC at collection the Sepax 2 yielded better TNC counts and an improved TNC-recovery. Considering that Cord Blood Banks concentrate increasingly their collection activity on CBU with high cellular counts, this fi nding could contribute to achieve this goal.",

            "text": "Therapeutic applications of T cells in immunotherapy have recently gained momentum with the promising results in adoptive transfer of antigen-specifi c T cells for infectious complications after allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation or for immunotherapy of malignant diseases. Activation and expansion of these cells for clinical application under controlled conditions require GMP-grade reagents including appropriate antibodies, cytokines and media. For standardized, reproducible cell cultivation and ex vivo differentiation procedures, a new serum and xeno-component free, GMP-grade medium for clinical use has been developed. High lot-to-lot consistency has been achieved by eliminating protein components not relevant for T cell expansion leaving human serum albumin as the only protein component. Using soluble antibodies against CD3 and CD28, more than 30%-higher expansion rates of viable and functional T cells after 6 days of expansion have been achieved with the new xeno-component free medium compared with other serum-free media. Transferring the same protocol to a high density cell culture system such as a gas permeable rapid expansion device, high densities of T cells with more than 1.5x10 7 cells/ mL were reached. The generation of antigen-specifi c T cells using the Cytokine Capture System IFN-gamma and the serum and xeno-component free T cell medium showed similar results regarding purity, recovery and background stimulation compared to the use of a standard basal medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum. For the automation of such complex procedures, a new cell processing device was developed. All steps for the anti genspecifi c T cell processing, i.e. antigen-specifi c re-stimulation, magnetic enrichment, and in vitro expansion with this T cell medium are performed in this fully automated device, in a closed system under sterile conditions. In conclusion, the newly developed GMP-grade, serum and xeno-component free T cell medium demonstrated high lot-tolot consistency and was superior in its performance to other commercially available serum-free media in high density cell culture systems. The new medium can be used to replace human AB serum supplementation for the clinical manufacturing of T cells resulting in easier handling and higher consistency. J. Stuth, M. Fahrendorff, D.

Miltenyi Miltenyi Biotec GmbH (Bergisch-Gladbach, DE) An automated clinical-grade process to separate CD133+ cells from human bone marrow aspirates (BM) was developed. The separated cells are intended to be used for cellular therapies in the fi eld of regenerative medicine such as cardiovascular, peripheral artery, and liver disease. The process is intended to fulfi ll all requirements for an automated sample preparation and separation of CD133+ cells from human BM. To determine the performance of the fully automated separation process, CD133+ cells were separated from sternal bone marrow. The initial frequency of CD133+ cells amounted to 0.34% (range: 0.1% to 0.7%) and the number of isolated CD133+ cells was 7.3x10 5 (range: 3.7x10 5 to 1.9x10 6 ). The yield was 53% (range: 18.6% to 90%) and the average viability of the separated CD133+ cells achieved 86% (range: 70% to 97%). The depletion of CD133 negative cells was greater than 99.9%. To demonstrate cell functionality colony-forming unit assays were performed to evaluate the differentiation potential of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. As expected, the CD133+",

An important determinant of successful stem cell transplantation is the ability of transplanted cells to mobilize, home, migrate, and effi ciently engraft and repair damaged tissues with functional cells. The chemokine SDF-1alpha plays a central role as a chemoattractant for CD133+ stem and progenitor cells, regulating their motility, homing to, and retention, survival, and proliferation in the BM. To determine the motility of enriched CD133+ cells to SDF-1alpha, transmigration assays were performed. First results showed that 43% of CD133+ cells, separated from bone marrow aspirates, migrated to SDF-1alpha. Without SDF-1alpha, 0.7% of CD133+ cells migrated. At the end of the process the enriched CD133+ cells were available in around 6 mL sodium chloride solution (NaCl). To provide a more physiological environment for CD133+ cells the isotonic NaCl can be optionally automatically supplemented with 10% autologous plasma for storage or transport of cells. The described cell separation system provides an effi cient and convenient way to purify CD133+ cells from BM within 2.5 h without any intermediate manual steps. The cell preparation in a closed, sterile system facilitates a fast and robust enrichment of CD133+ cells. After separation the CD133+ cells are eluted in a small volume and can immediately be used for further applications.",

Human adenovirus, Epstein-Barr-virus, and cytomegalovirus infections are frequently observed and often cause life-threatening complications following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Multi-virus-specifi c CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells can rapidly be generated by a short-term antigen-specifi c restimulation of peripheral blood cells with a combination of pools of peptides covering complete viral antigens and a subsequent isolation using the Cytokine Capture System IFN-gamma. A novel cell processing device was developed, which performs all steps of the CCS procedure, i.e. restimulation, magnetic enrichment, and potentially in vitro expansion fully automated under sterile conditions. All components for the generation of the cellular product including the cellular starting material (e.g. leukapheresis), antigen(s), reagents, buffer, and media are connected to a sterile single-use functionally closed tubing set via sterile fi lters or docking technique. Cell processing can run overnight and the isolated cells might be used directly after magnetic enrichment or after an additional phase of in vitro expansion. Using this cell processing device, IFNgamma secreting multi-virus-specifi c T-cells can be enriched to the same purity as with the semi-automated procedure and cell loss is markedly reduced, leading to an increased yield of IFN-gamma positive cells. Furthermore, observing an improved cell viability using the automated compared to the semi-automated process, resulting in better in vitro T cell expansion rates. Restimulation of isolated and expanded multi-virus-specifi c T cells with an antigen mixture resulted in a high proportion of T-cells re-expressing IFN-gamma, confi rming their functionality. Analysis of the composition of the multi-virus-specifi c T-cell population in respect to single antigen specifi cities revealed the relative frequencies of T-cells specifi c for each single antigen were comparable before and after the co-enrichment and co-expansion process, showing the protocol works for T-cells independent of their pathogen specifi city. In conclusion, the automation enables with minimal manual intervention, reduced workload and also clean room requirements the easy, safe, fast, robust generation of antigen-specifi c T-cells for adoptive immunotherapy.

The fi rst CD34 positive selection in Turkey was carried out in Gulhane Military Medical Academy Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) center in February 1998 using immunomagnetic method (CliniMACS). Methods: One hundred sixty-eight selection processes have done until October 2011. Sixty-eight and one hundred selections were made for autologous transplantation and for haploidentical transplantation, respectively . Of the 68 autologous transplantation process, number of diagnosis were as follows: 29 breast cancer, 13 Non-hodgkin lymphoma, 15 neuroblastoma, 2 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 1 scleroderma, 1 multiple sclerosis, 4 Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 2 multiple myeloma and 1 osteosarcoma. Among the 100 process of haploidentical allogeneic transplantation, 53 Severe Combined Immunodefi ciency, 13 Fanconi anemia, 5 osteopetrosis, 17 Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 4 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, 1 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 1 Chronic Myeloid Monocytic Leukemia, 1 MHC Class II defi ciency, 1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome, 1 hemophagocytic syndrome, 2 amegacaryoctic thrombocytopenia and 1 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Syndrome were identifi ed. Normal column was used in 35 selection and large column was used in 133 selection. Peripheral blood was used in 159 selection and bone marrow in 9 selection. Manual washing was used for 69 cases and automatic washing for 99 cases. Results: The median rate of purity and recovery ratio of CD 34 (+) cells were 94% (30-99) and 66% (27-100), respectively. The median T-cell depletion was 4:52 log (1.31-5.82 ) and Bcell depletion was 2.86 log (1.11-4.82) . For the > 94 purity rate, tumor cell depletion was between 3-4 log. Selections administered in healthy subjects had higher purity and recovery rates than in patients. The performance of the system was not compromised even though the number of cells were higher than the capacity (provided the total column CD34 (+) cell capacity of CliniMACS is not exceeded). Conclusion: In Conclusion, immunomagnetic selection of CD34 (+) cells using CliniMACS is an effective method for both autologous and allogeneic transplantation, providing high purity and protection rates of CD34 and high depletion rates of T and B cells.",

            "text": "We report our preliminary experience on the use of the Optia MNC version 5 for collection of donor lymphocytes from normal donors for use in donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in allogeneic transplantation. Methods and Materials: 10 non-mobilized allogeneic donors have had DLI apheresis collections on Optia MNC version 5. Collection preference was set to deliver a low haematocrit fi nal product. ACD-A anticoagulation was used and apheresis completed at an AC ratio of 13.5 and infusion rate of 0.8mL/min/L total blood volume (TBV). Run data were recorded collected from the Spectra OptiaTM apheresis reporting system at the end of each procedure. Full blood count S257 data and CD3+/CD19+ target cell numbers were completed for the donor before and after apheresis and from the fi nal product. Performance was measured by target cell yield and collection effi ciency together with fi nal product volume and haematocrit. Platelet loss to the donor was also measured after apheresis. Results: Performance data are summarized in Table 1 . Conclusion: We conclude the Optia MNC version 5 delivers a high purity MNC product with low fi nal volume. CD3+ target cells were collected with high overall effi ciency, with an acceptable yield for escalating doses of DLI. Residual red cell volume and granulocyte numbers in the fi nal product was low and platelet loss to the donor was acceptable. Since immunotherapy seems to be more effective in stages of impending, rather than overt relapse, perhaps the most appropriate platform for donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) is in a prophylactic setting. Fifty-seven patients with haemato logical malignancies received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with low dose (10-20 mg) alemtuzumab and were prospectively screened for prophylactic DLI (pDLI), if they had, high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or increasing mixed chimerism (MC). Patients had to be out of immunosuppression and not to have a history of acute GvHD\u2265 grade II or an active GvHD at time of the planned pDLI. Finally, 15 (37%) patients (AML 8, ALL 7) received a total of 47 pDLIs administrations. pDLIs from sibling donors (n=7) were given after second leukapheresis without growth factor mobilization, and from unrelated donors (n=8) from frozen aliquots taken from the mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSCT) graft. At the time of fi rst pDLI, 8 patients (53%) revealed MC (median 7.5%, 5-15). The fi rst pDLI was given at a median of 162 days (78-426) after HCT, the median number of infusions was 3 (1-6) and the median cumulative dose given was 2x10 6 CD3+ cells/kg (0.7-7). 75% pDLI recipients converted their MC to stable complete chimerism and 25% improved to \u22645%. 47% pDLI recipients developed graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD; acute GvHD n=4, chronic GvHD n=3) after a median cumulative CD3+ dose of 2x10 6 /kg (0.7-7) and median 75 (33-343) and 36 days after the fi rst and the last pDLI, respectively. After a median follow up of 529 days (374-1606) from HCT, 11 (73%) pDLI recipients are alive and 4 (27%) died, all due to GvHD related causes. None of the patients that received pDLIs relapsed. In contrast, 3 out of 7 (43%) of the patients who were screened as potential pDLI candidates but did not receive lymphocytes because of logistical hurdles relapsed. Taken together, our prospective feasibility study shows that pDLIs are feasible and probably maintain signifi cant anti-leukemic activity, as suggested by the high chimerism conversion rate and the zero relapse rates. However, the high incidence of GvHD, even after low CD3+ dose, emphasizes the need for more careful selection of patients receiving pDLI or the use of safer innovative cellular products, such as suicide-gene engineered lymphocytes. We report immune recovery after HSCT in 444 patients according to donor type: HLA identical Siblings (MSD) (n=176), 1 antigen mismatched family donors-unrelated donors (n=125) (ALT), unrelated cord blood (n=103) and haplo-identical mismatched family donors (HAPLO) (n=40). Methods: All patients received unmanipulated bone marrow: 283 after a myeloablative (MA) conditioning regimen (CY-TBI or BU-CY) and 161 after a fl udarabine based reduced intensity regimen (RIC). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporin methotrexate (CyA+MTX) for all patients except for CBIB (CyA and mycophenolate,MMF) and for HAPLO transplants which consisted of CyA+MMF and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (HDCY). Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was used only for ALT transplants. We compared T cell reconstitution (CD3+, CD4+ CD8+) and B cell recovery (IgA levels) separately after MA and RIC transplants, according to donor type, on days +30, +90, +180 post BMT. Results: T cell recovery. As shown in Figure 1 , following NMA regimens, CB transplants had the slowest CD4 recovery; HAPLO CD4 recovery was comparable to MSD until day +90, but exceeded all other donor types on day +180. Non-Relapse Mortality (CI-NRM) was 30% (MSD), 33% (ALT), 45% (CBIB), 0% (HAPLO) (p=0.02).",

IF studies were perfomed on erythrocyte-lysed BM aspirate samples: CD 138 FITC/CD 38 PE/CD 19 PerCP; CD 138 FITC/CD 38 PE/CD 117 PerCP (c-cit) Cy 5.5; CD 138 FITC/CD 38 PerCP Cy 5.5/CD 56 PE (monoclonal antibodies BD). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was estimated according to abberant antigen expression (AAE)CD 19, CD 117, CD 56 from gate with coexpression CD 138/38. The analysis was based on at least 50,000 events. Threshold level of cells with abnormal antigen expression of CD 138/CD 38 population was 10%. The IF results were compared with immunofi xation and morphology studies. Results: 1 patient achieved complete response (CR)before SCM, that was confi rmed by immunofi xation (IMF)and by morphology (0, 8 % BMPCs) and was MRD (-) by MFC. 4 patients were in very good partial response (VGPR) (trace secretion in serum and/or urine M-protein and 0-1,2 % BMPCs), among 3 of them was MRD (+) by IF, in 1 case MRD was undetectable. Partial response (PR) was achieved in 1 patient (serum M-protein-13 g/l; 3,5 % BMPCs) and MRD (+) by IF. IF of BMC among 4 patients after ASCT confi rmed achievement of stringent complete response (sCR): absence of AAE CD 19, CD 117, CD 56 on cells with coexpression 138/38, absence of M-protein in serum and urine, 0-0,5 % PCs in BM. There were 1 patient in CR before SCM and 3 patients with VGPR. Another patient with VGPR before SCM still had the same data after ASCT: trace secretion in serum; 1,2 % BMPCs and MRD (+).

Vallejo Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Objectives: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a progressive and incurable disease with classical chemotherapy or high-dose therapy (HDT). However, the clinical course can be very variable, including patients very short progression-free survival, and patients with prolonged symptom-free survival. The development of new techniques for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) has led to the need for further refi nement of MM response criteria used so far. We evaluated the infl uence of the MRD detection by multiparameter fl ow cytometry (MFC) on progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment-free interval (TFI) in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients and Methods: we retrospectively reviewed 76 patients treated according to the Spanish multicenter protocol GEM 2000: induction with 6 alternating cycles of VBCMP/VBAD followed by auto-HSCT conditioned high-dose melphalan. MRD status by MFC was determined pre-transplant and at day +100 post-transplant. Immunophenotyping was performed in bone marrow samples with a FACSCalibur fl ow cytometer (4colours) . For each sample \u2265 10 5 cells were acquired. Results: MDR by MFC was negative [-] in 28% prior to HSCT as compared to 51% after transplantation. All patients who were MRD S260 pared to those who reached the MDR [-] status post-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, MRD status by MFC at day +100 after HSCT was the most important independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR=6.7, P=0.007) and TFI (HR =6.1, P=0.005). Conclusion: our fi ndings confi rm the importance of MRD monitoring by MFC in MM patients undergoing HSCT and supports the need to incorporate the technique in routine clinical practice. Particularly, the strong impact of the MRD status by MFC at day +100 on the future course of the disease, may help to decide what patients might benefi t from consolidation therapies or early allogeneic transplant.

Bosi UF Ematologia (Florence, IT) Background: The lack of effective therapies for the treatment of leukemia relapse after allogeneic transplant (HSCT) underlines the need to prevent relapse occurrence. Thus, the identifi cation of reliable predictors of impending relapse would support a rational use of post HSCT procedures, such as reduction/ suspension of immunosuppression or donor leukocytes infusion (DLI), aimed to reduce or delay overt reoccurrence of leukemia. Methods and Aims: The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive power of MRD by fl ow cytometry (FC) on post-HSCT relapse prediction in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Since February 2010 to September 2011, 9 AML patients with an available leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype received an allo-HSCT. Median age was 48 (range 16-59). Based on clinical-biological characteristics at diagnosis, 8 and 1 patients were classifi ed as having high and intermediate risk disease, respectively. We prospectively studied the MRD levels by FC at days 30, 90, 180, 270 and 365 after HSCT. Results: After a median follow-up of 13 months, 8 patients are in CCR. Two patients experienced relapse; one of them had a meaningful clinical and biologic behavior. The HSCT source was HLA-identical sibling donor; the patient had a complete peripheral recovery at day +30 in spite of a mixed chimerism status (20%). As his peripheral values declined at day +80, one BM aspirate was carried out: MRD by FC resulted negative. Due to blood count worsening, a further evaluation (day +120) showed BM infi ltration by blast cells at morphology; at the same time, the patient experienced pleural effusion due to extra-hematological localization. As depicted in fi gure 1, the phenotypic profi le of cells showed a complete shift from diagnosis to relapse with loss of CD34 and CD117 and with a tendency to monocytic differentiation that was not present at the outset. A donor origin of AML was ruled out; the biologic re-assessment showed normal karyotype, negativity for NPM1 and FLT3 mutations, as highlighted at diagnosis. The patient received a salvage therapy based on high doses cytarabine and died during aplasia without any available evaluation of response. Conclusions: The occurrence of a phenotypic shift by blasts can be relatively frequent after allo-HSCT; it can impair signifi cantly the sensitivity of MRD assessment by FC. A wide AML phenotypic characterization and the use of multiple combinations on its basis are crucial to avoid a relapse misdiagnosis. S261 the need to prevent relapse occurrence. Thus, the identifi cation of reliable predictors of impending relapse would support a rational use of post HSCT procedures, such as the reduction/suspension of immunosuppression or donor leukocytes infusion (DLI), aimed to reduce or delay overt reoccurrence of leukemia. Methods and Aims: The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive power of WT1 transcript monitoring post-HSCT, in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), on relapse prediction. Since February 2010 to July 2011, 10 AML patients received HSCT while on fi rst complete remission (CR); their median age was 48 (range 16-59). Based on clinical-biological characteristics at diagnosis, 9 and 1 patients were classifi ed as having high and intermediate risk disease, respectively. We prospectively analyzed the patients at specifi c time points: day 30, 90, 180, 270 and 365 after HSCT. At each time-point, the expression of WT1 by RT-PCR on bone marrow was planned. Results. Six out of 10 patients over-expressed WT1 at diagnosis and were therefore eligible for our study. In all these cases WT1 levels reduced below the adopted threshold of normality (250 WT1 copies per Abl copies) before HSCT. All patients are in continuous CR after a median follow-up of 13 months (range",

Of note, 2 patients showed increasing levels of WT1 at the planned time-points, as displayed by Figure 1 , and they are both in CR at 8 and 12 months from HSCT respectively. The correlation between WT1 kinetics and hematological relapse has been reported as variable after HSCT. In the majority of patients, the elevation of WT1 is quickly followed by relapse (after 30-40 days); in some other patients, the latency from WT1 increase to relapse seems to be longer (Candoni et al, Eur J Hematol 2008) . The latter occurrence would render the management of immunosuppression potentially more effective. On the other hand our observation might suggest to be cautious about treating patients upon WT1 levels. Conclusions: Wide studies with long follow-up are needed in order to deepen the kinetics of WT1 post HSCT and thus to hypothesize its prospective clinical use. The outcome of adult AML still remains unsatisfactory due to two main reasons: 1) the risk-category allocation based on the sole defi nition of pre-treatment biological features may fail to distinguish some high-risk patients, which are not timely addressed to allogeneic SCT (ASCT); 2) the ASCT option may be hampered by the paucity of candidates (25-30%) with a full matched family donor. Nevertheless, upfront genetics/cytogenetics and minimal residual disease (MRD), when properly combined, represent powerful tools to predict relapse risk on an individual basis. We designed a risk-adapted strategy in which high-risk patients, defined according to pretreatment genetics/cytogenetics (poor-risk K or of FLT3-ITD) and/or a positive post-consolidation MRD status (\u22653.5x10e-4 residual leukemic cells), should timely receive ASCT whatever the source. For comparison, we analyzed the outcome of a matched historical cohort of high-risk patients who were submitted to ASCT if a full matched family donor was available, or to autologous transplant. The prospective and the retrospective cohort included 23 (4 MRD+ good-K, 9 MRD+ int-K, 4 adverse-K and 6 FLT3-ITD) and 59 patients (8 MRD+ good-K, 33 MRD+ int-K, 1 adverse-K, 10 FLT3-ITD and 7 MRD+), respectively. After a median follow-up of 20 months, survival estimates of the prospective cohort were superior as compared to the retrospective one (DFS 73% vs 15%, p=0.011; OS 69% vs 20%, p=0.020; CIR 21% vs 76%, p<0.001; relapse rate 22% vs 69%, p<0.001). All 19 patients in the prospective cohort received ASCT (8 from a matched family donor, 5 haploidentical, 6 matched unrelated donor/umbilical cord blood) as compared to 14/47 (29%) in the retrospective cohort (p<0.001). We conclude that a transplant policy based on a risk-driven \"transplant versus no transplant\" rather than \"donor versus no donor\" strategy might improve the outcome of high-risk AML patients. Objective: The aim of our study was to develop methods for determining minimal residual disease (MRD) for patients with acute leukemia, using deletions in gene IKZF1 (transcription factor IKAROS) as a marker. Methods: The presence of deletions delta 2-7 and delta 4-7 IKZF1 was examined in 95 patients with acute leukemia (AML -26, ALL -64, biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) -5) at different stages of disease. Locus-specifi c primers and TaqMan probes for real-time PCR were designed to quantify deletions delta 2-7 and delta 4-7 mutIKZF1. Results: The frequency of deletions IKZF1 in the general population of patients with acute leukemia was 11% (n=10), and in patients with ALL, 12% (n=8). But, at the same time, deletions were detected for 31% (5 of 16) of patients with Ph-positive ALL. Two patients with BAL had a deletion in the IKZF1 gene. Within the group of patients with AML and healthy volunteers the above-mentioned mutations were not detected. IKZF1 mutations were found in the group of patients with detected chromosomal aberrations as well as in patients with normal karyotype tumor cells. The IKZF1 gene deletion was not detected in patients at molecular remission. At the same time the number of cells with deletion proportionally increased data on other markers: cytogenetic and molecular (defi nition of the chimeric transcripts) at relapse. We found out a correlation between mutIKZF1amplifi cation and a number of blasts (R=0.62, p=0.017), chimeric transcripts level (R=0.91, p=0.000001) and donor chimerism (R= -0.63, p=0.02). The sensitivity of mutIKZF1 detection is less then chimeric transcripts level measurement S263 (88%), but the specifi city was observed the same (100%). Conclusion: Deletions in the gene IKZF1 can be used as a marker for evaluation of minimal residual disease in patients with ALL without other informative molecular markers.",

            "text": "Background: Relapse is the major cause of treatment failure after HSCT for childhood ALL. A high level of minimal residual disease (MRD) at HSCT is associated with a high risk of relapse after HSCT. Materials and Methods: From May 2001 to May 2011, 101 children and young adults with ALL in complete remission (CR) underwent a fi rst allogeneic HSCT at the Clinica Pediatrica in Monza and 82 of them (54 males, median age at HSCT 9,2) could be studied for MRD. 26 patients were in CR1, 46 in CR2, 10 in CR3. HSC source was BM in 67, PB in 11, CB and BM in 3 and CB in 1 and the donor was an HLA identical sibling in 24, an haploidentical parent in 7, and an unrelated donor in 51. Follow-up was up-dated as of November 30, 2011 and the median follow-up was 4 years after HSCT. MRD was analyzed at HSCT and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after HCT; analyses were performed according to EuroMRD Group guidelines. MRD was considered positive when its level was 5x10 -4 or higher at the time of HSCT and at any level after HSCT. Results: 54 of 82 patients remained in CCR, 20 relapsed and 8 died of treatment related mortality (TRM). All patients were evaluable for MRD before HSCT and 79%, 83%, 85%, 89% and 77% of the patients at risk could be studied at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. MRD at HSCT. 46 MRD negative patients reported a 5-year event free survival (EFS) of 74.7% (SE 6.6) accounting for 5 relapses and 6 non-leukemic death; 36 MRD positive patients reported a 5-year EFS of 48.8%, (SE 8.9), accounting for 15 relapses and 2 deaths. 5-year EFS in CR1 was 91.7% (SE 8.0) for 12 MRD negative and 55.6% (SE 15.2) for 14 MRD positive patients; 5-year EFS in CR2 was 79.7% (SE 8.1) for 26 MRD negative and 48.5% (SE 11.4) for 20 MRD positive patients. Of 9 patients with MRD \u226510 -3 , 5 relapsed. MRD after HSCT. Of the MRD positive patients at 1 (n=19), 3 (n=9), 6 (n=6), 9 (n=11) and 12 months (n=6), 53%, 56%, 100%, 55%, 67% relapsed, respectively. Of the 36 MRD positive patients at HSCT, 22 had at least one positive value after HSCT, which was associated with a subsequent relapse in 13 of the cases, while of the 5 who became persistently negative, 0 developed a relapse. Of the 46 MRD negative patients at HSCT, 36 remained persistently negative, and 2 of them relapsed, and of the 8 patients who became positive at some point after HSCT 3 relapsed. Conclusions: MRD positivity in transplanted ALL is associated with a dismal prognosis, particularly when \u226510 -3 and mostly in CR2 patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) and has a signifi cant effect on quality of life and mortality. It has been shown that anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) reduced incidence and severity of acute and chronic GvHD in patients after unrelated alloSCT. A small number of studies suggest the role of ATG in match related (MRD) alloSCT. The aim of this study is to assess the risk of acute and chronic GvHD, survival, mortality, and chimerism date in patients according to receiving ATG prior MRD alloSCT. The prospective single-centre study included 11 patients underwent MRD alloSCT and receiving ATG in additional to conventional GvHD prophylaxis (ATG+). Control group consist 11 MRD alloSCT transplanted patients with cyclosporine/methotrexate prophylaxis (non-ATG). These groups were matched for age, disease, cytogenetic risk group at the time of diagnosis, and disease phase at MRD alloSCT. All patients followed by stable myeloid and platelet engraftment. Leukocyte engraftment in ATG+ and non-ATG groups was at median 16 and 15 days, respectively. Platelet engraftment varied from 12 to 20 days in ATG+ and from 10 to 20 days in control group. On day +28, 91% of ATG+ and 73% of non-ATG patents showed complete chimerism (P 0.03). Chimerism analyses between day +56 and the last follow-up did not reveal any switch of chimerism status. Acute GvHD was evaluable in 55% of ATG+ and in 64% of non-ATG groups. Severe acute GvHD was diagnosed in 18% and 36% patient from ATG+ and non-ATG groups, respectively (P 0.07). Chronic GvHD was evaluable in 67% of patients from ATG+ group and in all patients from control group, who alive more 100 days after alloSCT (P 0.0001). Extended chronic GvHD was present in 22% and 50% of patients from ATG+ and non-ATG groups, respectively (P 0,05). The differences in relapse, mortality, and overall survival between patients received ATG and patients with standard GvHD prophylaxis were not signifi cant.",

ATG may help to decrease the rate or severity of GvHD in this setting. Background: Incompatibility in red blood cell (RBC) systems can induce a hemolytic reaction, but not have an impact on outcome following allogeneic stem cell (SC) transplant. Besides clinical, hematological and cytogenetic monitoring, testing for immunohematological markers is useful for confi rmation of allogeneic SC engraftment. Outcome of allogeneic SC transplants can be predicted by kinetics of conversion of the blood groups -that is by donor-specifi c RBC appearance and disappearance of recipient-specifi c RBC antigens, as well as by verifi cation of specifi c ABO antibody alterations. Aim: To investigate conversions of RBC phenotype using semiquantifi cation of the mixed fi elds in the solid phase (column agglutination technology) after SC transplant, as well as to determine the type and degree of donor himerism. The goal was also to determine the correlation between RBC phenotyping and fi ndings of cytogenetic and molecular testing. Patients and Methods: Total of 22 patients were underwent to allogeneic SC transplant form HLA-matched, but ABO-incompatible (major, bidirectional or minor incompatibility) donors. In control group, patients by ABO-compatible transplants were treated. Acceptance of the allograft was assessed on the basis of semiquantitative testing of ABO, Rhesus, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, P, MNSs and Lewis blood group antigens before and after transplants -using column agglutination technology in the solid phase (BioVue Ortho System). Analysis of the presence/titer of ABO antibodies in recipient's serum (ABO-incompatible setting) was also performed. Results: By RBC phenotyping in solid-phase, the proportion of donor-specifi c RBCs (DS-RBCs) at levels from 50% to 100% between the 39. and 155. posttransplant day was observed. The existence of 100% of DS-RBCs in the patients' circulation or complete disappearance of recipient-specifi c RBC antigens on the 87.9\u00b136.2 day after SC transplant was detected in average. Alteration in the specifi city and/or titer of ABO alloantibodies was a less important marker of allograft acceptance. A statistically signifi cant correlation between immunohematological fi ndings and results of cytogenetic and molecular testing was confi rmed. Summary/Conclusions: The use of semiquantitative column RBC phenotyping, and investigation of ABO seroconversion considerably could be improve the monitoring of SC engraftment -especially when cytogenetic and molecular testing is diffi cult or impossible.",

Since mixed CHM of certain lineages may have negative prognostic implications, three leukemic patients with SMC (based on STRs) were evaluated in relation to PCR-MRD, and lineage specifi c chimerism for cd3-T, cd19-B, cd56-NK and cd33/66-myeloid cells. Patients were selected that displayed on routine longitudinal, STR-based CHM analysis the following features: (1) SMC (<95% donor) for at least 5 weeks; (2) >6 sequential samples with chimeric variance < \u00b1 5% across samples; (3) PCR initially negative for MRD markers during SMC interval. Duration of NM-SMC and follow-up was: 47/47 wk, 128/128 wk, 43 wk-intermittent/336 wk. Multi-Lineage CHM Analysis (MLA) showed for case #1 (AML) -T cell (mainly) and myeloid MC; case #2 (ALL) -Pan-lineage MC; case #3 (CML) -solitary NK cell MC. Only case #3 with isolated NK cell NM-SMC eventually developed MRD positivity, without clinical relapse. These observations raise points in two directions. In a CLINICAL vein: (1) long-term, SMC may occur that is due to non-malignant recipient hematopoiesis; (2) the risk for molecular relapse may depend on the specifi c chimeric lineage, e.g. NK cells here. These fi ndings also raise the following TECHNICAL issues in regards to post-transplantation monitoring of leukemia: (1) A longitudinal approach to CHM analysis is necessary to detect the occurrence of SMC; (2) MRD testing is needed to establish that SMC is non-malignant;",

Aim of the Study: Primary end point was to evaluate the effi cacy of the kit in providing informative markers. Secondary end points was to defi ne the more and the less useful markers in CS analysis considering two different kinds of D/R couples: familiar in ST and not familiar in UTD. Result: The panel provide at least one informative marker for the CS analysis in 99% of UTD and 98% of SB. The majority of D/R couples had 2 informative markers (42% in ST and 40% in UTD), 19% and 13% had only 1 marker and 39% and 48% had from 3 to 6 markers in ST and UTD respectively. Considering the single markers, we have seen that 10 of them have an high frequency of informativeness either in ST or in UTD, despite there are 3 markers that are useless because rarely signifi cant and never single. The single STR markers in order of signifi cance are: Penta D, TH01, Amelogenin, Penta E, D18S51, TPOX, D13S317, D8S1179, D7S820, D21S11, D16S539, D3S1358, FGA, D5S818, Vwa, CSF1PO. These data have been confi rmed also with a statistical analysis based on the linear regression test which compares the level of signifi cance of each marker in our population with the level of variability of each STR allele in the general population. We have seen a direct correlation of these two variables (R 2 : 0,20). We have also seen that in our population 12 STR alleles are suffi cient to provide at least 1 markers for CS in 99% of D/R couples, but considering the general population and the level of variability of each markers we estimate that only the last 3 ones could be eliminated. Conclusion: These data confi rm the high effi cacy of this panel in providing informative markers for CS study. We retain that some STR alleles which have a low variability level in the population could be replaced with other more informative.",

Recently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has improved overall survival and some reports have suggested that graft versus tumor effect might exist. As in other refractory diseases, umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has been considered in ATLL patients. Some investigators have sugge-sted that a chimaerism study using multicolor FACS analysis with anti-HLA antibodies would be a useful method in HSCT recipients from HLA mismatched donors. On the other hand, using multicolor FACS analysis, a recent study has suggested CD3dim+CD7dim+CD4+ cells and CD3dim+CD7-CD4+ cells are specifi cally expressed in acute type ATLL. In this study, we report a case which was able to investigate engraftment and minimal residual disease (MRD) simultaneously using multicolor FACS analysis. The patient was a 51 year old female who was diagnosed as acute type ATLL. She underwent UCBT using HLA mismatched cord blood and we analyzed her peripheral blood at 7, 14, 22, 28, 37 and 58 days after SCT. At day 7, 74.7% of CD4+cells were residual recipient type cells. Also, 56.7% of these recipient cells were CD7-cell, so these cells were considered as ATLL cells. At day 14, recipient type CD4+cells rapidly reduced to 1.6%. A brief expansion of recipient's CD4+cells occurred after day 22, however, after day 37 recipient's CD4+cells reduced again. Morphologically, all sorted CD7-CD4+cells of the recipient at day 7 had complicatedly shaped nuclei which were considered as ATLL cells.",

Finke Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, DE) Quantitative hematopoietic chimerism testing mainly relies on PCR amplifi cation of polymorphic short tandem DNA repeats (STR) and capillary electrophoresis analysis of PCR products. Few studies had addressed STR performance in hematopoietic chimerism testing. Quality control (QC) procedures are routinely used in clinical laboratories. Applications of such procedures to hematopoietic chimerism are scarcely reported. The aim of this study was to asses the impact of STR validation parameters on the quantifi cation of hematopoietic chimerism and to analyze the analytical process through the application of QC procedures. STR used in this study were SE33, D1S80 and THO1. In addition, PCR for amelogenin and FISH for X and Y chromosomes were used. Analytical chimerism testing was assessed using male/female artifi cial cellular mixtures prepared in known proportions (0% 0.5% 1% 2% 5% 10% 30% 50% 100%). To evaluate the clinical hematopoietic chimerism performance 152 samples from 96 sex-mismatched transplanted patients were used. The 2% DNA mixture was used to generate Levey-Jennings QC charts. A precision profi le for each STR (mixed chimerism range 0.5-30%) was performed. Detection limits for SE33, THO1 and D1S80 were 81, 85 and 61 relative fl uorescence units respectively. Analytical sensitivity of artifi cial DNA mixtures for all STRs was 1% (range 0.5-1.6%). Analytical sensitivity for FISH and amelogenin was 0.5% (range 0.1-1.1%). SE33 and THO1 did not show allelic imbalance while severe allelic imbalance (allele peak ratio <0.60) for D1S80 was detected at 0.25 ng of DNA template mass. The detected allelic imbalance resulted in a 50% overestimation in the mixed chimerism calculation. Sensitivity in clinical samples was 1% (range 0.4-2%) for all STRs. Correlation between the STR and non-STR markers (mixed chimerism range: 0-90%) in clinical samples was high (regression coeffi cient >0.90). At low mixed chimerism percentage (1%) THO1, SE33 and D1S80 variation coeffi cient was 23, 19 and 16% respectively.",

Mazzi (1) The status of Hematopoietic Chimerism (HC) after allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) can be an early indicator of adverse events including disease relapse. Classical HC analysis by Short Tandem Repeats (STR) is hampered by a relatively low sensitivity and inter-marker competition in multiplex PCR. In HLA mismatched HSCT, HLA has been shown to be a sensitive marker for HC analysis, however this method does not detect leukemia relapse involving selective loss of the non-shared HLA, a frequent phenomenon in this setting. In order to overcome these problems, in this study we have tested HC analysis by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) using the AlleleSEQR\u00ae Chimerism Research Use Only Assay (Celera Corp., Alameda, CA) which comprises 34 Ins/Del polymorphic markers covering 19 different chromosomes. Using 50ng genomic DNA template, this assay had a sensitivity of 0.2% with excellent inter-marker reproducibility and effi ciency (91-100%). HC was studied in 173 follow-up samples of 28 patients after myeloablative haploidentical HSCT for high risk leukemia, comparatively by Q-PCR, STR and HLA. At least 2 different informative markers were found for all patients. The overall concordance of Q-PCR was 71.1% and 72.3% with STR and HLA, respectively. All discordances were due to a positive signal in Q-PCR with a negative result for the other method. Correlation between HC results and relapse was analyzed in 17 informative patients based on the available time of follow-up. 13 relapses (7 with and 6 without HLA loss) occurred in 11 patients and were predicted in 11/13 (84.6%), 4/13 (30.7%) and 6/13 (46.1%) cases by a positive signal in Q-PCR, STR and HLA, respectively, with a median time from fi rst signal to relapse of 227, 102 and 172 days, respectively. Importantly, 6/7 HLA loss relapses were detected by Q-PCR with a median time from fi rst signal to relapse of 364 days. In 6 patients without relapse during the time of observation, no positive signals were seen by either method with the exception of one patient with a series of positive Q-PCR results during active acute graft versus host disease which turned negative after successful treatment of the condition. Overall, the positive and negative predictive value was 92% and 71% for Q-PCR, 100% and 40% for STR and 100% and 46% for HLA. Taken together, our data show that Q-PCR for Ins/Del polymorphisms holds promise for improving the sensitivity and informative value of HC in allogeneic HSCT.",

No other parameter (ATG dose, Donor type\u2026) achieved this level of individual prognostic. These results, in a very homogenous population, raise the question concerning the utility of routine chimerism surveillance in patients presenting an acute GvHD following RIC Allo-SCT and that can imply a not negligible saving in terms of economic and human resources. Umbilical cord blood (CB) transplant is an alternative for patients with hematological malignancies lacking HLA-matched adult donors for allogeneic transplantation. The co-infusion of CD34+ cells from a third party HLA-mismatched donor (TPD), so called dual transplant, has shown to reduce the period of postransplant neutropenia and related complications of single CB transplant. The aim of this study was to analyze the value of early postransplant peripheral blood (PB) and T lymphocytes (TL) chimerism analysis after dual transplant regarding CB engraftment. Methods: 17 patients underwent 18 dual transplants between 2004 and 2011. Chimerism analysis was performerd weekly until complete chimerism (CC) by STR-PCR (AmpFlSTR SGM Plus; Applied Biosystems) in PB and TL. CC was defi ned as <1% recipient in PB and <5% in TL (95% purity of enriched samples). Results: From the 18 transplants, 12 (Figure 1a -n) showed engraftment (>500 TNC) in a median of 16 days reaching full CB chimerism in a median of 24 days. Early postransplant PB chimerism showed increasing CB cells in 9 cases (Figure 1a-i) . Only 2 cases showed low (<15%) percentages of CB cells on day +14 (Figure 1h-i) , however both exhibited a signifi cant increase in the second sample (day +21). In the remaining 5 cases the proportion of CB cells in PB remained stable or decreased from day +14 to day +21 (Figure 1j-n) , however TL chimerism showed a signifi cant increase or remained near 100% CB cells in both samples. One case showed low percentages of CB on days +14, +21 and +28 (Figure 1n ) together with TNC<500 compatible with graft failure, however CB cells in TL showed a signifi cant increase on day +28.

After dUCBT, one cord blood (CB) unit usually emerges as the dominant one and is responsible for long-term immune reconstitution. However, long-term mixed chimerism has also been described. We report here the case of a patient who received a dUCBT as rescue after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) from a voluntary unrelated donor (VUD) and whose long-term chimerism showed the persistence of cells from the 3 grafts. Case Report: A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and received 8 cycles of R-CHOP leading to complete remission (CR). He relapsed 7 months later and achieved CR2 after 4 cycles of R-ICE. After consolidation chemotherapy, he received a 9/10 HLA-matched VUD HCT conditioned with 4-Gy total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Chimerism analysis was done by either real time PCR of In/Del polymorphisms for the minority component or STR PCR, on total nucleated cells (TNC) of peripheral blood (PB). At 7 weeks, a mixed chimerism with 37% recipient cells was documented, leading to stop cyclosporin. After transient improvement of chimerism, pancytopenia occurred and graft rejection was confi rmed by (i) a marrow biopsy showing severe hypoplasia and (ii) 75% recipient cells in PB. A rescue dUCBT was urgently performed after conditioning with fl udarabine, cyclo-",

Two weeks after dUCBT, chimerism showed 45% cells from CB1, 52% from CB2 and 2.6% cells from the VUD. This feature, with an unexpected long-term detection of the VUD cells (3 to 4.6% of TNC) and of the 2 CBs in similar proportions, persisted over time (Figure 1 ). Seven months after dUCBT, chimerism was performed on the CD3+, CD19+ and CD 56+ cell compartments and showed results comparable to TNC (Table 1) . At 21 months after dUCBT, this uncommon triple-donor immune reconstitution is still observed and stable, and associated with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia around 40 g/L. Conclusion: This case confi rms the rare occurrence of longterm mixed chimerism after dUCBT, but additionally suggests (i) that mixed chimerism may be equitable between 2 CB units, (ii) that it may concern several cell lineages and (iii) that dUCBT could be associated with a tolerance status allowing long-term detection of VUD cells.",

G-CSF was administered from day +2 until neutrophil recovery on day +14 (ANC>500/mm 3 ). Platelet recovery (PLT>20x10 9 /L) was observed on day +20. No major complications developed during the aplastic phase. The molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease and donor chimerism on bone marrow is reported in Figure 1 . On day +30 donor chimerism was 35.8% and residual disease was 0.02 BCR-ABL/ABL% IS, so we started dasatinib therapy (140 mg/day) and reduced cyclosporine that was definitively withdrawn on day +131. Any toxicities were observed during dasatinib therapy that is still ongoing. Results: Pre-emptive dasatinib treatment determined a progressive decrease in molecular transcript levels and an improvement in donor chimerism (Figure 1 ). At last follow up, 6 months after transplant, the bone marrow chimerism is 95.4% donor on lymphocytes and 96.7% donor on neutrophils and the minimal residual disease is undetectable at molecular level.

Okinaka National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Donor-Recipient Chimerism (D/R chimerism) analysis of CD3(+) cells is recognized as an important diagnostic tool in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) . In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of D/R chimerism of CD3(-) cells as a prediction marker and an early detection marker after ASCT. Methods: Fifty hematological malignancy patients receiving ASCT were enrolled in this study. We obtained 30 ml of peripheral blood samples on days 30, 60, 120, 150, 180 after a written informed consent. Mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected using Lymphosepal separation solution and CD3(+) cells were separated using the MACS system according to the manufacture's protocols. After obtaining DNA from PBMC, CD3(+) cells, CD3(-) cells and granulocyte, STR analysis were proceeded using AmpFLSTR\u00ae Identifi ler PCR Amplifi cation Kit. We also tested other molecular markers including WT1 mRNA quantitative analysis, and evaluated the relationship between CD3(-) chimerism and clinical diagnosis. Result and Discussion: Fifty patients (AML 24pts, MDS overt AML 5pts, MDS 9pts, CMMoL 1pt, and ALL 11pts) receiving ASCT were enrolled in this study. Thirteen pts. relapsed, 8 pts. died without relapse and 1 pt. withdrew the consent until day 180. Median relapse date is day 89 (32-164) and MST after AST is day 255. Thirteen patients of 50 pts. showed \u22652 percent decrease of CD3(-) chimerism, and 10 pts. from the 13 pts. showed early relapse and one showed non-relapse death. Two pts. fi nally reached 100% chimerism of CD3(-) cells and still alive. All of 10 hematological relapse patients showed decrease of CD3(-) chimerism without decrease of CD3(+) chimerism nor granulocyte chimerism. As results of our experiments, 80% of patients showing \u2265 2% decrease of CD3(-) chimerism relapsed until day 180 after ASCT, especially 90 % of pts. with \u2265 2% decrease of CD3(-) chimerism without decrease of CD3(+) chimerism relapsed. These results suggested mixed chimerism of CD3(-) cells is a prediction marker of relapse and \u2265 2% decrease of CD3 (-) cell chimerism is an early detection marker of relapse.",

Discussion: The described material shows the unique case of longtime-persistence of 2 CBU that leads to the serious alloimmune reactions: FES, Rh-confl ict etc. This situation requires the additional immunosuppressive therapy, special warnings on the chimerism monitoring and blood serology. Intensive immunosupression and HLA-identity lead to the simultaneous existence of 2 CBU. But the signifi cantly fast engraftment achieved in case of such type HSCT. Conclusion: HSCT of 2 CBU shows the several advantages in case of SCID. The special attention must be paid on GvHD prevention and treatment. The described material shows the importance of the linear chimerism investigation as a control method. The usage of this type HSCT (in case of possibility) is indicated for SCID patients in such severe condition.

Furthermore, T cell activation marker HLA-DR reached its highest expression between days 60 and 90 when KIR receptors were expressed at their lowest level (27% vs. 8%, p<0,0001). Conclusions: We conclude that KIR receptors were differentially expressed on NK and T cells.

However, only limited data about the association between outcome and functional parameters of recovering lymphocytes are available so far. In this prospective study of 20 pediatric SCT recipients, we serially evaluated immune parameters quantitatively and qualitatively before and throughout allogeneic SCT. This data was analyzed with respect to survival. Age, gender, GvHD, and type of graft were not different between relapsing and nonrelapsing patients. Notably, in our cohort there was no case of transplant-related or infectious mortality. However, with the exception of two patients with advanced MDS, all patients not in complete remission (CR) relapsed in addition to three patients in higher CR (n=7). Uni-and multivariate analysis showed that relapsing patients had higher TGF \u03b2 serum levels as well as lower percentages of IFNgamma-producing T cells before and early after transplantation. Furthermore, relapsing patients had a further decline in their thymic function between day 60-120 whereas nonrelapsing patients already showed increasing TREC values during this time interval. Collectively, patients who later relapse show a different pattern of immune reconstitution before and at early time points posttransplantation. Background: T cell-depleted HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is characterized by a delayed T-cell reconstitution, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections. Among these, CMV reactivation syndromes are the major cause of non-relapse mortality during the fi rst year after transplant. With the aim of accelerating immune reconstitution, different T cell-based strategies have been proposed. The development of these strategies is however limited by the current lack of validated T-cell biomarkers predictive of clinical events. Aim: To identify T-cell biomarkers predictive of the risk of CMV reactivation as a \"model\" clinical event during the fi rst year after T-cell based haplo-HSCT. Results : In this study, we considered 89 patients undergoing haplo-HSCT and receiving polyclonal donor T cells either as delayed infusions (n=18) or in the form of an unmanipulated graft (n=71) followed by immune suppression with rapamycin. All patients were prospectively studied for polyclonal and CMV-specifi c T-cell biomarkers starting from day 30 until day 360. During this period, CMV",

Polyclonal T-cell reconstitution was accelerated: at day 30, median CD3+ cells were 154 per \u03bcl (range 0-2146), CD4+ 52 (0-996), CD8+ 81 (0-1373); at day 90, median CD3+ cells were 378 per \u03bcl (0-2817), CD4+ 127 (0-804), CD8+ 173 . Higher T-cell counts, however, did not associate with a lower risk of subsequent CMV reactivation. Differential counts of TNA, TCM, TEM or TEMRA cells, or a higher TCR spectratyping complexity score also failed to predict viral reactivation. Median CMV-specifi c IFN-g spots were 100 per mL (range 0-7400) at day 30 and 200 per mL (range 0-35,800) at day 90. At both time points, higher values of CMV-specifi c spots protected from viral reactivation (P<0.05). Interestingly, when CMV-specifi c spots were >1000 per mL, CMV reactivation was exceedingly infrequent (2% of all episodes, self-limiting). Conclusions: Early reconstitution of functional CMV immunity protects from viral reactivation. A threshold of 1000 CMV-specifi c IFN-g spots per mL should be investigated as a surrogate marker in prospective trials.",

            "text": "Objective: Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been recognized to augment antileukemic mechanisms after hemato poietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). CMV has furthermore been shown to induce activation of non-licensed natural killer (NK) cells that have only non-self specifi c inhibitory killer immunoglobulinelike receptors (KIR). This may occur in case of HLA-C KIR ligand group 1/1 or 2/2 homozygosity of the recipient. Methods: We have retrospectively analyzed the effect of CMV serology and CMV reactivation in 264 peripheral blood SCT recipients stratifi ed by HLA-C KIR ligand status. Results: Following transplants to HLA-C-group 1/1 or 2/2 homozygous recipients, CMV reactivation favourably infl uenced the cumulative incidence of relapse (28% vs 44% at 4 years; p=0.013) and the probability of progression-free survival (PFS; 44% vs 24%; p=0.015). In contrast, in HLA-C-group 1/2 heterozygous recipients, CMV reactivation had a rather detrimental effect on relapse incidence (33% vs 20%; p=0.17) and PFS (32% vs 43%; p=0.55). Vice versa, HLA-C group homozygosity was an adverse factor exclusively in recipients who never experienced CMV reactivation (relapse, 44% vs 20%; p=0.002; PFS, 24% vs 43%; p=0.003), and in CMV seronegative recipients (relapse, 40% vs 16%; p=0.03; PFS, 30% vs 51%, p=0.1). Conclusion: These data suggest that reactivation of CMV per se does not exert an antileukemic effect after SCT, but rather enables graft-versus-leukemia effects specifi cally in HLA-C KIR-ligand group homozygous recipients who may otherwise have hyporesponsive NK cells due to a non-licensed state.",

            "text": "Introduction: Children with high-risk and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) following myeloablative conditioning. Monitoring of peripheral blood and bone marrow chimerism after SCT has been demonstrated to be a valuable parameter to predict leukemia recurrence. In patients with mixed chimerism, cessation of immune suppression and infusion of donor lymphocytes may result in elimination of residual recipient hematopoiesis, achievement of full donor chimerism and prevention of leukemia relapse. Patients and Methods: To obtain further insight in chimerism profi les after myeloablative SCT in children with ALL (particularly performed in fi rst and second continuous remission), we performed a retrospective analysis in a cohort of n=71 consecutive and evaluable ALL patients transplanted with (mis)matched family and unrelated donors between 2000-2010. Chimerism was routinely performed once in 2-4 weeks within the fi rst 3 months and once monthly thereafter until 1 year postSCT in both peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and granulocyte fractions. Results: Within this cohort, n= 31/71 patients relapsed which was mostly preceded by mixed chimerism in both PBMC and granulocyte fractions. In the group of ALL patients with continuous complete remission (n=40/71), n=2/40 (5%) had persistent mixed chimerism (>5% recipient signal beyond day +60) which lasted 8 and >12 months, respectively. Mixed chimerism did not respond to tapering of ciclosporin A. Notably, repetitive analysis of bone marrow aspirates in these patients revealed complete donor chimerism and molecular remission. Detailed analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte fractions demonstrated that mixed chimerism was exclusively found within CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets. In both patients, the episode of mixed T lymphocyte chimerism coincided with adenovirus and cytomegalovirus reactivation, respectively. Adenovirus-specifi c T lymphocytes could be isolated and were found to be completely of recipient origin. Conclusion: These data indicate that recipient memory T lymphocytes may resist successful myeloablative and anti-leukemic SCT conditioning and contribute to anti-viral immunity postSCT. Thus, prolonged mixed chimerism, when restricted to the T lymphocyte fraction, is not correlated with ALL relapse. In these particular cases, potentially harmful immunotherapeutic interventions to prevent suspected relapse may be avoided. Objectives: In vivo confocal laserscanning microscopy (CLSM) is a new noninvasive method to visualize changes in cell distribution within tissues such as the cornea. Here, we investigated whether the distribution of dendritic cells (DC), seen as hyperrefl ective cells, is changing in epithelial cornea and oral mucous membranes after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A correlation to the development of donor specifi c chimerism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was evaluated. Methods: After total body irradiation of 2 Gy, enriched HSC from canine bone marrow were transplanted in DLA-identical siblings by intra bone marrow application into the humerus and femur. As immunosuppressive drugs a combination of CSA (15 mg/kg BID; days -1 to +35) and MMF (20 mg/kg BID; days 0 to +27) was applied. PBMC samples for chimerism analyses were taken once before and then biweekly after HSCT. Chimerism was determined by a PCR of polymorphic nucleotide repeats using a capillary gel electrophoresis. On days -1, +28, +56 and +112 images of epithelial layers of canine cornea and of oral mucous membranes were taken by CLSM. The installation for the in vivo imaging consisted of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT II) with the Rostock Cornea Module (RCM), which enables measurements of the ocular surface. Results: Before HSCT, DC were rarely visible in the examined tissues. An increase of DC after HSCT was detected in each of the fi ve dogs examined at one time point of measurement, both in epithelia of cornea and of oral mucous membranes. The magnitude of increase and the time point of the highest DC density varied between the animals. After HSCT, an increase of donor derived PBMC was observed with peaks on d+28 in all fi ve dogs (range 9.7 -21.6 %). The two dogs with the highest donor chimerism showed the highest DC density in epithelia of cornea and oral mucous membranes, respectively. The increase in DC density occurred delayed in regard to the PBMC chimerism. Conclusions: After HSCT, changes in DC distribution can be visualized in vivo in canine epithelia by the CLSM. In parallel to the development of PBMC chimerism, an appearance and increase of DC within the respective epithelium could be detected. The CLSM is a new excellent tool to visualize changes in cell composition within tissues after HSCT. ",

In such defense, dendritic cells (DC), which act as specialized antigen-presenting cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems, are essential cell components. Objectives: To monitor the recovery of different subsets of DC after unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB), bone marrow (BM), and peripheral blood (PBSC) HSCT and to evaluate the impact of the distribution of these cell subsets on the outcome of the transplant. Methods: DC [lineage negative, HLA-DR+ and CD123+ plasmacytoid (p) DC, CD11c+ myeloid (m) DC, and CD16+ monocytoid (mo) DC] were quantifi ed by multiparametric fl ow cytometry at 6 sequential time points (at engraftment, and at days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 60 after engraftment). Overall, 34 patients (19 male; median age 13y, range 1-63y) receiving a UCB (n=15), BM (n=14) or PBSC (n=5) unrelated HSCT were studied. The most common diagnosis was acute leukemia (ALL, 12 cases; AML, 10; CML, 5; aplastic anemia/MDS, 6; Hodgkin lymphoma, 1; SCID, 1). Most patients received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens (73%). Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was used in 38% and total body irradiation (TBI) in 41% of cases. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 18 days (range: 12-45). Median follow up time was 6 months. Results: Patients who died from early transplantation-related causes (TRM) had signifi cantly lower counts of pDC and mDC during the fi rst 3 weeks after HSCT. At day 21 after engraftment, the median number of pDC and mDC was 0.9 and 2.0/uL among patients who died from TRM vs. 7.1 (p=.006) and 8.4/uL (p=.01) in the remainder, respectively. Patients presenting grade II-IV acute GVHD also had signifi cantly lower pDC counts at days 14 and 21. There was no signifi cant association of both the hematopoietic stem cell source and the conditioning regimen on the risk of TRM or acute GVHD. Conclusion: Low pDC counts in the fi rst weeks after unrelated HSCT are associated with an increased incidence of GVHD and mortality. The precise mechanisms that might explain the role of pDC on immunity early after HSCT deserve further investigations.",

            "text": "Introduction: It is known that biological and functional properties of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) have a signifi cant role in infl uencing the transplant outcome. Based on this consideration, we have established and applied an internal operative protocol of quality controls, with the aim of defi ning the graft validation, respecting international guidelines. Methods: We established type and timing of the tests to perform during all phases of PBSC processing. We evaluated the parameters recognized as indicators of graft quality: total nucleated cells (TNC), mononuclear cells (MNC), cell viability, CD34+ cells count, colony forming unit-Granulocyte Macrophage (CFU-GM, Methocult Stem Cell Technologies), microbial and minimal residual disease (MRD) contamination. At collection: PBSCs, collected using a leukapheresis cell separator (Fresenius COM-TEC), are tested for microbial contamination. At Processing: assessment of TNC, MNC, CD34+(FacsCalibur Becton Dickinson;ISHAGE Protocol) and cell viability (7-AAD), CFU-GM, microbial and MRD contamination. After 30 days of cryopreservation and storage: revaluation of cell viability (trypan blue) on aliquots stored together with PBSC unit. This test is repeated immediately before transplant to verify the effective performance of the product. At PBSCs release: count of TNC, MNC, CD34+ (ISHAGE) and cell viability (7-AAD, trypan blue) and microbial contamination. Results: From January 2010 to November 2011 we evaluated 175 autologous cryopreserved PBSCs, comparing the data obtained in all steps defi ned by our protocol with the fi nal results of release. We observed a satisfying recovery for each parameter tested, in line with our expectations, and a reproducibility of the data at each time points. All data are shown as percentage of recovery: TNC 88,6% (r.62-100); TNC viability 69% (42-94); MNC 78% (r.50-93); CD34 71% (r.43-99). No case of microbial contamination. Conclusions: Quality tests provided by our operative protocol allow us to evaluate the graft characteristics and to monitor all different steps of PBSCs production, from collection until distribution. An other important advantage is the possibility to keep critical points of the process under control. Introduction: In the cryopreservation process of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) the viability control after thawing has a crucial role. Such control is useful to confi rm the validity of cryopreservation, storage and thawing processes. Therefore, we set up a internal protocol to determine how much the cell viability verifi ed on the samples is representative of the correspondent cryopreserved HPC products. In our protocol, the viability must be available at HPC thawing time and carried out previously on an accompanying sample cryopreserved and stored in the same conditions of HPC product. Methods: 109 HPC products and relative samples have been valued after thawing at 37\u00b0C to check the viability of total nuclear cells (TNC) using a vital test (7-AAD). The data have been analyzed using the independent sample test (T Test). Results: The viability average on TNC was 76% (SD 17.6) on samples and 80,3% (SD 14,1) on HPC products. The HPC products' viability is confi rmed by the clinical output. In fact, we have infused 4.9x10E6 (SD 1.3) CD34/Kg (average); the engraftment of polymorphonucleated cells (PMN) (>100) has been at +10.9 days (SD 1.4) and of platelets (PLT) (>30.000) at +14.2 days (SD 0.1). Conclusion: There are a few works in literature related to cell viability's validation on samples in comparison of correspondent HPC products. Our data show that the viability value (%) of the samples is signifi cantly lower than respective HPC products. Finally, we can affi rm that cell viability of the samples can be a reliable and prognostic indicator of the viability recovery of respective thawed HPC products. Introduction: Cryopreserved autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSCs) are commonly used in treatment of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Transplant outcome, considered as achievement of a rapid and durable granulocytes and platelets recovery, is strictly related to the biological and functional properties of graft, particularly regarding its CD34+ count. An important aspect is to adequately cryopreserve and store PBSCs, guaranteeing their integrity until transplant. Aim: To apply a standardized protocol for evaluating the main biological properties of PBSCs for predicting approximately, just at collection time, the real CD34+ count expected at transplant. Methods: We analyzed PBSCs collected from 63 patients with different diseases (31 MM; 11 HD; 11 AL; 8 NHL; 2 MS), submitted to collection and autologous transplant from 2009 to 2011. PBSCs were obtained by leukapheresis with continuous-fl ow (Fresenius COM-TEC). Test and timing of our protocol are reported as follows. Collection and processing: count of total nucleated and mononuclear cells (TNC-MNC), CD34+ count (FacsCalibur, BD ISHAGE). At this step we calculated, using MNC% value, the probable CD34+ performance. At 30 days after cryopreservation and storage in liquid N2: cell viability (trypan blue) and evaluation of approximate CD34+ count expected at release. At transplant: after thawing and washing PBSC unit, we evaluated TNC, MNC, cell viability (tryoan blue and 7-AAD) and CD34+ count to defi nitively establish graft quality before releasing. Results: All data are shown as mean value. At collection: TNC 180x10E8 (130-210); MNC 67,9% (r.40-87), CD34+ 4x10E6/ Kg (r.0,54-7,4), CD34+ performance 2,7x10E6/Kg (r.0,38-5,2). At 30 days: TNC viability 67% (r.39-82), CD34+ performance 2,6x10E6/Kg (r.0,33-5,1). At transplant: TNC 158x10E8 (r.114-184); TNC viability 68,8% (r.42-92), CD34+ performance 2,8x10E6/Kg (r.0,37-5,8). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that just at collection time we are able to establish the effective performance of cryopreserved PBSCs, particularly referred to CD34+ count. We consider that this could be mainly explained by the close correlation existing among MNC collected, cell viability and CD34+ count calculated at transplant. Background: Risk management is the identifi cation and assessment of every critical situation followed by coordinated application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events. In a SCT programme, this assumes that the Quality Management System (QMS) is well established and set up to identify potential risks for patient and donor safety. Our center is JACIE accredited since 2008 for all facilities-Clinical Unit (CU), Apheresis Unit (AU) and Cell Proces-sing Laboratory (CPL). These parts represent complex SCT transplantation programme with a single QMS. Methods:based on the analysis of adverse event reporting we retrospectively (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) identifi ed some critical situation during the transplant process and determined the risk factors. According to the ISO risk analysis technique the Composite Risk Index (CRI) was established. For the CRI calculation following procedure was used: impact of the risk event (IR) x probability of occurrence (PO). IR and PO were assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 and 5 represent the minimum and maximum possible impact of an occurrence of a risk). CRI thus took values ranging from 1 through 25, and this range was divided into three sub-ranges: Low (1-8), Medium (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) and High (17-25), depending on the sub-range containing the calculated value of the CRI. Results: during the years 2008-2011, we identifi ed a total of 154 adverse events (73 in the CPL, 65 in the CU and 17 in the AU). In the CPL were assessed as Medium risk: lower number of CD34+ (16/73), labeling (7/73) and as Low risk: errors in documentation (3/73), technical problems (6/73), positive steritity testing (6/73). In the CU have been as Medium risk identifi ed: errors in documentation (26/65) and as Low risk: technical problems (7/65), complication during transplantation (6/65), complications after platelet transfusion (4/65), pneumothorax after central venous catheter insertion (3/65).",

The association of JACIE with improved patient outcome was recently documented. Conditions in which quality management systems were introduced and actual benefi ts remain to be fully evaluated. The study explores one aspect of quality management: introduction and use of indicators. Through a questionnaire sent to JACIE accredited centers, we aimed at identifying indicators (name, domain of application, category, longevity and general description), understanding how they were set in place, whether or not similar indicators were used by different programs, and whether all of the HSCT processes were monitored. The survey was fi rst sent to 14 French accredited HSCT centers and next to 68 other programs in 11 European countries. Categorization was double-checked against published criteria. The response rate was 40% (32 programs). Two-hundred and ninety-three indicators were collected, including 224 (76%) that were introduced during the preparatory phase of JACIE accreditation. Indicators were associated with the following processes: measurement, analysis and improvement (54/293 or 18%); donor collection (49/293 or 16%); processing and storage of cell therapy products (37 /293 or 12.5%), administration of HPC (67/293 or 23%). Mapping reveals an uneven distribution of indicators across the different sub-processes that contribute to this highly-specialized medical procedure. Moreover, we found that only 101/293 indicators (34%) comply with the rules for implementation of a quality indicator, as defi ned by the FDX 50-171 standard. This suggests that risks to donors / recipients are unevenly monitored, leaving critical medical steps with low levels of monitoring.",

In order to better understand the impact of AC on unit capacity we developed a computer model to simulate dynamic pt fl ows through our haemato-oncology unit when AC was used to treat a range of pts with haematologic cancer. Methods: A simulation model was developed in Simul8 based on a hypothetical haemo-oncology unit with 9 HEPA fi ltered single rooms. Treatment pathways (pws) for pts needing SCT or IC for lymphoma, myeloma or AML consolidation were predefi ned, together with AC pws: i) all inpatient care, ii) ambulatory care in hospital sited fl ats, iii) ambulatory care at home. The model was populated with representative data from our unit, including pt numbers and treatment variables. In a model example, it was possible to perform a baseline of 92 SCT/IC treatments per year using conventional inpatient care pathways. In order to assess the impact of AC on this model, we assumed that 50% of pts needing SCT/IC would be suitable for AC, and that only those pts who lived within 30 minutes of the unit would be eligible for AC at home. We then ran simulations with varying degrees of AC. Results: Despite a fi xed number of HEPA rooms, our model predicted that 11-18 additional SCT/IC treatments per year would be possible with AC using 1-2 AC fl ats \u00b1 home care. Provision of a second AC fl at had less impact than the one fl at only, allowing only an additional 4 SCT per year, but with lower fl at occupancy. AC with home care, in addition to a single AC fl at, allowed an additional 7 SCT/IC per year. Conclusions: Our simulation modelling predicts the availability of additional bed resource through using AC pathways in pts with haematologic cancer. Using this approach, it is also possible to determine the increased bed capacity predictions for specifi c treatment subgroups, including autologous and allogeneic SCT.",

Finally a joint response from 17 out of 19 centres was sent to JACIE. The joint response was also accorded with HOVON SCT group. In accordance a discussion was held about the goals this group would like to achieve. The three main items formulated are: to implement a uniform interpretation of JACIE standards, to share 'Best Practice' and to standardize processes/indicators. In October 2011 a follow up meeting was held. The subjects to be discussed were: Comparison of a JACIE audit evaluation of 2 children hospitals, description of the process concerning donor trajectory and presentation of the quality system of the hospital attended. At this meeting 11 quality offi cers were present out of 19 centres (adults and children). Structure: meetings twice a year at different locations. Time span: 4 hours.

A modifi ed EBMT risk score and HCT-CI score was evaluated on autologous recipients in a single center experience. Material and Methods: We stratifi ed outcomes among 156 consecutive adult autologous recipients (35 MM, 20 NHL, 30HD, 9 ALL, 61AML, 1 Ewing). Median age was 35 years (7-63). In 40% of patients with lymphoproliferative diseases were with refractory/relapsed disease and other patients were in complete remission before SCT. Results: HCT-CI risk was low in 19 (12%), intermediate in 42 (27%) high in 86(55%) and undetermined in 9 (6%). Two year OS was 45% (95%CI: 24-64%), 55% (95%CI: 40-68%) and 42% (95%CI: 24-64%) in the low, intermediate and high-risk HCT-CI groups respectively. Two year NRM was 36% (95% CI: 17-36%), 26% (95% CI 15-39%) and 30% (95% CI: 22-39%) in the low, intermediate and high-risk HCT-CI groups respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that HCT-CI failed in prediction of OS and NRM but KPS (<90%) was a strong predictor of NRM as an independent predictor. According to the modifi ed EBMT score 15 (9, 6%) patients had a score 0-3, 131 (83, 9%) had score 4-7, 10 (6, 4%) patients had score >8. OS two year was >80% in the low risk, 40% in the intermediate group and 25% in the high risk group. Conclusion: HCT-CI and PS showed to be an effective tool in prediction of transplant outcome, mainly 2 year survival including variables that are independent to stem cell source, mobilizing regimen and conditioning.

Taniguchi Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: Although donor-specifi c anti-HLA antibody (DSA) was clearly associated with graft failure in cord blood transplantation (CBT), clinical signifi cance of anti-HLA antibodies without corresponding HLA antigens on cord blood (non-DSA) remains unclear. The present study evaluated the impact of non-DSA on engraftment in 176 CBT recipients. Methods: From 2008, we prospectively screened anti-HLA antibodies before transplant to avoid selection of cord blood with corresponded to DSA in the recipient. Anti-HLA antibodies were tested using a Flow PRA method, and the specifi city was identifi ed by LAB Screen PRA and Single Antigen. Median fl uorescence intensity of >1000 was considered to be positive. Results: One hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent single CBT between 2008 and 2011 in our institute were included in this study. Their median age was 59 (range, 17-74). Overall, 60.7% were male, 88% were in high risk disease status, 94.8% were conditioned with Fludarabine-based regimen, and 82.3% received tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. Median total nucleated cells and CD34+ cells infused were 2.56 (1.67-5. 65) x 10 7 /kg and 0.91 (0.13-2.97) x 10 5 /kg, respectively. HLA disparities at antigen for HLA-A, -B, and -DR locus was 6/6 (n=2), 5/6 (n=31), 4/6 (n=133), and 3/6 (n=10). Anti-HLA antibodies were present in 64 of the 176 patients (36.3%) (ab-positive group). Among ab-positive group, 53 (82.8%) had antibodies against an HLA class I antigen, 9.3% against an HLA class II, and 7.8% against both class I and class II. Median number of the positive antibodies was 3 (range, 1-60). Cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at 42 after CBT was 81.2% for ab-positive group and 79.5% for ab-negative group (P=0.7). The type of antibodies (class I vs class II vs class I + II) and the number of antibodies (high; > 5 vs low; <5) had no signifi cant infl uence on neutrophil recovery. In multivariate analysis, high degree of HLA disparities in host-versus graft direction (2-3/6 vs 0-1/6) was only signifi cant negative factor for neutrophil recovery (Hazard ratio; 0.78, P=0.01). Even in the subgroup analysis of patients with high degree of HLA disparities, non-DSA had no effect on engraftment (p=0.3). Conclusion: These results suggest that presence of non-DSA itself does not have any effect on engraftment.",

Boruczkowski (1) Introduction: Now a days, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are new and giving new opportunities for therapies of various inherited and acquired disorders. Recently, the possibility of treatment of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) with MSC is the aim of intensive studies. MSC can be isolated from many sources. The most commonly used in clinical practice are bone marrow-derived cells, however their harvest is invasive for donor's health. Coll-ection of UCB is easy, safe for both: newborn and mother, but it usually contains MSC in a very limited number. WJ as a source of MSC has all advantages of UCB and it is reach in cells which can be isolate, proliferate to a required number and cryopreserved. In the present publication we describe the results of collection, culture, investigation, and cryopreservation of cells derived from more than 500 UC collected by our group of stem cells banks (www.famicord.eu). Material and Methods: UC were collected after natural deliveries as well as caesarian sections. After that WJ was isolated by mechanical dissection of cord's blood vessels. Plastic-adherent cells were isolated without enzymatic treatment and cultured in a MSC intended medium in the 37 \u00b0C, in the atmosphere of 5% CO2 in the air. Cells were enumerated and their viability was evaluated. Then the cells were cryopreserved in the presence of 10% DMSO and placed in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen. The repeated cell counting, viability test, fl ow cytometric immunophenotyping, and functional in vitro differentiation assays were performed from thawed reference samples.

Huang Peking University Institute of Hematology, The People's Hospital (Beijing, CN) Objectives: Our aim was to assess the leukemia-free survival (LFS) and some main results such as hematologic recovery, risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after unrelated cord-blood translations compared with the outcomes of transplantations from the other unrelated graft source. Methods: The clinical outcomes of 112 consecutive patients with acute leukemia and received umbilical cord blood (CBT) as a primary unrelated stem-cell source (n=38), or bone marrow transplant (BMT n=28, transplanted before Jan 2003) or peripheral blood stem-cell transplant (PBSCT n=46, transplanted after Jan 2003) during July 2000 and July 2008 were analyzed. Results: Except for the patients were much younger in the CBT group (median age 10.5 in CBT, 30 in PBSCT, 20 in BMT), the other pre-transplant parameters such as gender, diagnosis, the phase of disease were comparative. All patients received myeloablative regimens mainly including BUCY; however, there were less anti-thymocyte globulin used for the BMT patients (3/38 without ATG in CBT, 0/46 in PBSCT and 18/28 in BMT) . Signifi cant delays in engraftment occurred after CBT for both white blood cell and platelet. The cumulative allo-engraftment rates were also signifi cant lower (86.8% vs 97.8% vs 100% for WBC; 77.0% vs 97.5% vs 89.5% for PLT) for CBT. The incidence of II-IV aGVHD or III-IV aGVHD were much higher in the BMT group, but did not differ for the other groups (51%,13.2% vs 41%,10.5% vs 77.4%,41.5% for the CBT vs PBSCT vs BMT). The occurrence of extensive cGVHD was signifi cant decreased for recipients with CBT (4%) compared with PBSCT (39.1%) and BMT (49.1%), although the rates of whole cGVDH were not reached statistically difference ( Conclusion: Our data showed that the OS, LFS and RR were similar among the three groups, although the hematologic recovery were lower and took longer in the CBT patients. The patients received CBT also had less occurrence of extensive cGVHD. These data support the use of umbilical cord blood donor as an alternative allogeneic donor as the unrelated adult donor.",

Jalali, L. Sharifi Aliabadi, A. Ghavamzadeh Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center (Tehran, IR) Objective: To review the results of umbilical cord blood transplantation in our center. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) due to the lower incidence of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) is an increasing available source of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients without suitably matched related or unrelated donor. Methods: Fourty patients who received UCB transplantation (41 UCB units, one case of retransplantation) between 1998 and 2011 enrolled in the study. The male to female ratio of recipients was 26:14 with a median age of 5 years (range: 8 months-30 years). The most common diseases were major beta-thalassemia (10 patients; 25%), then acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8 patients; 20%) and severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) (5 patients; 12.5%). Thirteen patients (31.7%) received UCB from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched-identical siblings, two (4.9%) from HLA-matched unrelated and 26(63.4%) from HLA mismatched unrelated. Five patients received doubleunit cord blood transplantation (DCBT). Results: The median number of post-thawing nucleated cells infused was 79\u00d710 7 /kg. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 1.62\u00d710 6 /kg. The median number of CD3+ cells infused was 97.2\u00d710 6 /kg. Thirty patients had neutrophil recovery and 25 had platelet recovery till 100-day post transplantation. The median time to absolute neutrophil count recovery (\u22650.5\u00d710 9 /L) was 21 days (range: 12-56). The median time to platelet recovery (count \u226520\u00d710 9 /L) was 33 days (range: 19-62). The median follow-up time was 154 days. Ten patients (25%) did not engraft until day 100 after transplantation. Acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) occurred in 20(50%) patients at median time of 11 days after transplantation. The most prevalent grade of aGVHD was grade III, in 9 (45%) patients. At present, 26 (65%) patients are still alive. Eight (20%) patients relapsed. The most common cause of death was infection. The six-month disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 44.5% (SE: 9.2%) and 63.2% (SE: 8.5%), respectively. Conclusion: Despite other studies, we found higher grade of aGvHD and graft failure among patients, which might be associated with a large number of mismatched alleles. Higher rate of infection observed because of delayed immune system reconstitution in recipients. Although the median time to engraftment is longer with using UCB but it is still a potentially available source for hematopoietic stem cells.",

Okamoto Kanto Study Group for Cell Therapy (Tokyo, JP) Background: Although unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) has been widely performed as a curative therapy for hematological malignancies, the optimal methods of transplantation including conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis have yet to be established. In this multi-institutional study, safety and effi cacy of CBT for hematological malignancies using myeloablative conditioning were prospectively evaluated. Patients and Methods: Patient eligibility was adult patients with AML, ALL, CML or MDS either lacking HLA-identical sibling donor and HLA-matched unrelated donor or requiring immediate allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conditioning consisted of total body irradiation 12 Gy, cytarabine 2-3 g/m 2 every 12 hours for 2 days, and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days as previously reported (Takahashi S, et al. 2004; 104:3813) . Continuous infusion of G-CSF (5 mcg/kg/day) was combined with cytarabine in patients with myeloid malignancies. Cyclosporine A and short-term methotrexate were used for the prophylaxis of GVHD. Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled and could be evaluated (Median age 37 years; range 21-54). Diagnoses were AML (n=20), ALL (n=6), CML (n=4), and MDS (n=3). Disease status at CBT was CR1 (n=12), CR2 or CP2 (n=5), and other advanced stages (n=16). Of the 33 patients, 31 achieved engraftment and 15 developed acute GVHD grades II-IV. With a median follow-up period 46.2 months (range: 31.0-65.8 months) in 16 surviving patients, 1-year non-relapse mortality rate was 15.2% (95%CI: 3.0-27.4) . Causes of death were infection (n=4) and graft failure (n=1). Overall disease-free survival rates were 66.7% (95%CI: 40.0-93.4) and 50.0% (95%CI: 21.8-78.2) in standard-risk patients, and 42.3% (95%CI: 20.9-63.7) and 38.1% (95%CI: 17.3-58.9) in high-risk patients, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that CBT can safely provide a high disease-free survival rate even in patients with highrisk hematological malignancies, and our transplant procedure could be one of the optimal methods of CBT.",

Human umbilical cord (UC) tissue provides a new source of MSC that exhibit differentiation and proliferation capacity. Several studies have indicated that MSC are immune privileged cells, unable to induce alloreactivity in humans. However, it has been documented that activated natural killer (NK) lymphocytes mediate MSC cytolysis, even though MSC can suppress NK-cell functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate immunomodulatory properties of human UC-MSC, with particular interest in their capacity to modulate lymphocyte proliferation as well as NK and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity. HLA-G surface expression and soluble (s)-HLA-G release were also investigated. Eleven UC, collected after obtaining informed consent from mothers of full-term infants delivered by caesarean section, were evaluated. For each sample, we were able to expand MSC. UC-MSC were characterized for plastic adherence, morphology, antigen surface expression, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. UC-MSC exhibited typical morphology and surface markers. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential was reduced compared to that reported for bone marrow derived MSC. Co-cultures of 5 UC-MSC lots with PBMC of the same healthy donor, at different MSC:PBMC ratios, were carried out in order to evaluate UC-MSC capacity to modulate PHAactivated lymphocyte proliferation, UC-MSC-directed cytotoxic activity, NK activity and CD3-redirected CTL activity. sHLA-G was quantifi ed by ELISA in supernatants obtained under the same culture conditions. UC-MSC suppressed PHA-lymphocyte proliferation at 1:2 and 1:20 MSC:PBMC ratios, when high s-HLA-G levels were detected, while a moderate increase in PHA-induced proliferation was observed at lower ratios (representative exp in Fig) . Three of 5 UC-MSC lots induced UC-MSC-directed cytotoxic activity; 5 of 5 UC-MSC lots suppressed NK activity and 4 of 5, CD3-redirected CTL activity. After co-culture, T lymphocyte subset number increased in 3 out of 5 exps, while NK cell number was reduced in all exps. Our results show remarkable variability in immune regulatory functions for UC-MSC; further studies are needed to defi ne their use in clinical applications.",

Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, IL) Background: Tissue adult stem cells are rare and their number and potency signifi cantly decrease with age and concomitant diseases. These problems stimulate the search for alternative cell sources for infarct repair. The umbilical cord stroma can provide an attractive source since it contains a high number of fresh allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Objective: To examine whether MSCs from umbilical cord stroma are able to repair or regenerate the infarcted myocardium in rat. Methods and Results: We developed a method that can be readily used to isolate and expand MSCs (Wharton's jelly cells) from human umbilical cord tissue. These cells display a fi broblast-like morphology, express mesenchymal markers, and have the potential to differentiate into osteogenic and myogenic cells. The in vitro study focused on their differentiation potential into cardiomyocytes using medium culture with 5-azacytidine. The in vivo study was performed in a rat model of MI: 7 days after MI, Wharton's jelly, bone marrow-derived MSCs (1*106 cells in 150\u03bcl sodium chloride) and saline were injected into the scar tissue, rats were injected with cyclosporine-A (15mg per 1kg) for a period of 30 days after cell transplantation. Serial echocardiography studies before and 60 days after injection showed that injection of Wharton's jelly stromal cells or bone marrow MSCs into a 7-day old infarct did not attenuate left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dilatation and dysfunction. Postmortem morphometric analysis of the hearts showed a signifi cant increase in wall thickness in the bone marrow MSCs treated group compared with control group (2.2\u00b10.6 vs. 1.6\u00b10.3, P=0.02). Conclusions: The present work suggests that human MSCs (Wharton's jelly or bone marrow) transplantation does not prevent LV remodeling and dysfunction after MI in rat. However, further research is warranted to determine the optimal dose, timing and mode of delivery of Warrton jelly-derived MSCs for infarct repair.",

Tinelli, A. Ierullo, A. Marchesi, V. Genovese, B. Romano, S. Sachetto, M. Truglio, M. Viola, M. Repossi, R. Poma, F. Perotti, A. Spinillo, M. Zecca, L. Salvaneschi Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo (Pavia, IT) Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-G is a non classical HLA class I gene which generates 4 membrane-bound (HLA-G1,G2,G3,G4) and 3 soluble (HLA-G5,G6,G7) protein isoforms by alternative splicing. A further soluble isoform (shedHLA-G1) is then produced by HLA-G1cleavage. During pregnancy HLA-G plays a major role in the maternal acceptance of the fetal allograft, downregulating uterine NK cells cytolytic activity and also inhibiting most T cell subsets response. For these tolerogenic properties, high soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels have been correlated with better graft acceptance in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation and reduced incidence of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Cord blood (CB) is collected at time of the infant donor's birth and its content of sHLA-G may be relevant for tolerance in the transplantation setting as CB is an alternative HSC source. Despite sHLA-G levels decrease in the second and third trimester of pregnancy compared to the fi rst one, we formerly reported that detectable levels of sHLA-G can be found in CB plasma after delivery and also after cryopreservation and long term storage (data not shown). As labor has been reported to correlate with sHLA-G levels at the end of pregnancy, the aim of this study is to verify if the type of delivery infl uences sHLA-G content of CB. For this purpose we evaluated the concentration of G5 and shedG1 molecules by ELISA assay in cord blood (CB) plasma obtained from physiological pregnancies, all at term (>37 weeks), 24 CB units being collected after scheduled cesarean and 55 after vaginal delivery. Signifi cantly higher sHLA-G levels were found in the group of CB obtained after scheduled cesarean (44 ng/ml) compared to vaginal delivery (35 ng/ml) (p=0.0462). While for unrelated HSC transplantation, plasma is routinely removed from CB units due to space saving for a cost-effective long term storage, directed CB units are cryopreserved as unmanipulated maintaining the benefi cial of their sHLA-G content. In our hands labor may be the difference as CB derived from caesarean section contains more sHLA-G than CB derived from vaginal delivery. This may suggest that programming cesarean sections for collection of directed CB units could be of benefi t, not only because of the increasing number of twin pregnancies and the relevance of logistics in this setting.",

Most patients received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens (73%). Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was used in 38% and total body irradiation (TBI) in 41% of cases. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 18 days (range: 12-45). Median follow up time was 6 months. Results: As compared to BM/PBSC, UCB was associated with a delayed neutrophil engraftment (28 days vs. 17 days; p=.01), and a trend to lower counts of all T-cell in the fi rst 3 weeks. At day 14 after engraftment, the median number of total T CD3+ cells was 149/uL for UCB vs. 828/uL for BM/PBSC recipients (p=.0004). The median number of CD4-CD8-T-cell was signifi cantly lower in UCB recipients as compared to BM and PBSC at all times during the fi rst 3 weeks (median 2/uL vs. 22/uL at day 3, p=.001; 2/uL vs. 13/uL at day 7, p=.003; 3/uL vs. 27/uL at day 14, p=.005; and 3/uL vs. 45/uL at day 21 after engraftment, p=.04). At day 60, Total T and CD4-8-cells counts were comparable between UCB and BM/PBSC recipients (11/uL vs. 30/uL, p=.13) . No signifi cant differences were observed between both groups as regards the distribution of NK cells subsets at any time. There was no signifi cant infl uence of MAC, ATG or TBI on the differences in T-cell counts observed between the two groups. Conclusion: UCB recipients have lower counts of CD4-/CD8-T-cells during the fi rst weeks after HSCT as compared to BM or PBSC recipients. The impact of this fi nding on the transplant outcome remains to be determined. ",

In recent years, cryopreservation of allogeneic HPC has been performed more frequently to store excess HPC or T cells for donor lymphocyte infusions or to circumvent issues of donor availability / product transport, particularly in light of recent worldwide events (Sept 11, swine fl u and fl ight disruptions due to volcanic ash). During 2006 to 2009, 30 allogeneic and 349 autologous HPC, Apheresis products were cryopreserved in this laboratory. It was noted that the post-thaw viable CD34+ recovery was lower in the allogeneic (median = 63%, range 16-92) than autologous products (72%, 13-151; p<0.0004). Hence this study aimed to determine factors that infl uence post-thaw CD34 recovery. Univariate analysis demonstrated weak inverse correlations between viable CD34 recovery and the collection to freeze time interval (Spearman r=-0.10, p=0.048), frozen nucleated cell concentration (NCC; r=-0.17, p<0.0001) and neutrophil content (r=-0.19, p=0.0008) . Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that collection to freeze interval (p=0.006), neutrophil content (p<0.0001) and allogeneic donors (p<0.001) signifi cantly affected viable CD34 recovery, but NCC did not (p=0.14). Nine of the cryopreserved allogeneic products have been infused, with patients attaining an absolute neutrophil count of >0.5x109/L in a median of 18 days (range 11-31) and platelets >20x109/L in 27 days (14-58), which is not signifi cantly different to that observed following infusion of 133 fresh HPC (neutrophil median 17 (9-45) days, p=0.9; platelets median 18 (10-101) days, p=0.2). This data indicates that the lower post-thaw viable CD34 recovery in allogeneic HPC, Apheresis may be due to intrinsic properties of allogeneic donors in addition to the higher neutrophil content and more prolonged pre-cryopreservation storage periods for these products. Post-thaw analysis of viable CD34+ content is recommended to ensure suffi cient viable CD34+ to facilitate engraftment.",

Gozzini, C. Nozzoli, R. Saccardi, A. Bosi BMT (Florence, IT) High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation represents an important therapeutic option in numerous malignant diseases. The number of CD34+ cells infused is considered to be a predictor of hematopoietic engraftment. The aim of this study is to evaluate if CD34+ cell dose measured post-thaw may represent a better predictor of engraftment than CD34+ cell dose evaluate pre-freezing. Total and viable CD34+ cells were counted using single platform fl ow cytometry and viability dye7-amino actinomycin D (7-ADD) before freezing and afterthaw. Stem cells were cryopreserved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). 113 consecutive peripheral stem cells autologous transplantations performed between November 2009 and November 2011 in 99 patients (pts) affected from hematological malignancies were analyzed. Patients' median age was 56 years (range 18-67); 14 were double transplants; 57 pts were affected by multiple myeloma, 27 by non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 15 by Hodgkin lymphoma. Melphalan 200mg/m 2 was the conditioning regimen utilized in 72/113 procedures, BEAM in 38/113 and FEAM in 3/113. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered to all pts from day +6. The median number of CD34+ re-infused cells evaluated prefreezing was 5,94x106/kg (range 1,99-13,49) versus 2,86 x106/kg (range 0,33-7,80) post-thaw. Only in 4/113 transplants (4.5%) infused CD34+ cells were less than 2,5x106/kg at prefreezing evaluation while in 60/113 (68%) they showed to be less then 2,5x106/kg at post-thaw evaluation. Median neutrophil engraftment (>0.5x109/l) was 12 days (range 8-21) and median platelet engraftment (>20 x109/l) was 14 days (range 9-49). Using Cox regression analysis, only the number of CD34+ cells evaluated prior to re-infusion (post-thaw) signifi cantly correlated with neutrophil (p .00) and platelet engraftment (p .001). Even if no standardized method for thawed CD34+ cells enumeration has been so far assessed, this data may indicate that estimation of viable CD34+ cells at re-infusion may be a better predictor of engraftment than the CD34+ cells count before freezing.

Vicente Hospital Universitario Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Introduction: The infl uence of graft composition on the clinical outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), including CD34+ cell dose, remains controversial. Aim: To analyze the infl uence of graft cell subset composition on allogeneic HSCT clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: Retrospective study of 115 consecutive patients undergoing HSCT between January 2005 and January 2011 in our center. The dose of cell subpopulations of the infused graft: total nucleated cells (TNC), CD34, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 was analyzed and correlated with engraftment, chimerism, incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), relapse and overall survival. Results: The median age was 42 years (range 10-69) and 58% (n=68) were male. Forty seven percent (n=54) received myeloablative conditioning, 68% (n=78) received progenitors from related donor and 97 patients (85%) received peripheral blood progenitor, 10 (9%) bone marrow and the rest umbilical cord blood progenitors. The median CD34 infused was 4.19 x 10 6 /kg (range 0.06-32.5) (other cell subsets are detailed in Table 1 ). In univariate analysis, infusion of higher doses of TNC, CD34, CD3, CD56 and CD19, was signifi cantly associated with faster neutrophil engraftment (\u2265 0.5x10 9 /L) (p 0.011; 0.016; p 0.012; p 0.031; p 0.012 respectively) and faster lymphocyte engraftment (\u22650.1x10 9 /L) (p<0.001, 0.016, 0.003, <0.001 and 0.003 respectively). The platelet engraftment (>20 x10 9 /L) was signifi cantly related only with CNT, CD34 and CD56 dose infused (p<0.001, 0.004 and 0.004 respectively). There was a signifi cant correlation among complete chimerism at day +360 with higher CD3+ cells dose infused (p=0.014). Patients who achieved neutrophil engraftment before day +10 had a signifi cantly higher overall survival (p 0.037). However, the multivariate analysis did not confi rm any signifi cant association between cell dose infused and the incidence of GVHD, relapse of the underlying disease or survival. Conclusions: This study confi rms that not only infusion of higher doses of CD34+ and TNC are followed by a faster hematologic engraftment, but also the infusion of higher dose of CD56+, CD19+ and CD3+. Interestingly, the dose of CD3+ infuse is signifi cantly correlated with a higher rate of complete donor chimerism on day +360. However, we cannot demonstrate signifi cant relationship between the studied cell subsets dose infused and the incidence of GVHD, disease recurrence or survival.",

Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou, E. Terpos, E. Kastritis, D Christoulas, M. MIgkou, M.A. Dimopoulos, C. Papadimitriou Alexandra Hospital (Athens, GR) Available manual apheresis systems generally produce stem cell yields of consistently high quality that can be safely used for autologous transplantation. However, manual apheresis needs continuous interface monitoring/adjustement, suffers from interface instability in poor mobilizers, high collection variability, high platelet loss and failure to electronically document parameters. A new advanced apheresis system, Spectra Optia v5.0, was designed to override these disadvantages.In our study, we evaluated data of 10 stem cell leukaphereses performed in 8 patients with various malignancies using Spectra Optia during 2011 to test its feasibility and effectiveness. We compared our data with those obtained from 225 patients that had undergone a stem cell collection for autologous transplantation in our Department between 2004 and 2011, using the COBE Spectra machine. The use and function of automatic interface control of Spectra were satisfactory. Due to the application of lower inlet volumes/min, as compared to corresponding volumes with the COBE Spectra machine, our apheresis with Spectra Optia usually took a longer time (median 447 min versus 317 min, p<0.005). Regarding other collection parameters, such as the percentage of CD34+ cells in the fi nal leukapheresis product, total yield of CD34+ cells, and product volume data were comparable for both devices (0.74% versus 0.97% CD34+, p=0.103; 6.85 versus 7.1x10 6 CD34+/kg, p=0.752; and 403.5 versus 353 ml graft volume, p=0.094, respectively). Time to engraftment was also comparable for both apheresis devices. Time interval to neutrophil counts >500/\u03bcl, neutrophil counts >1500/\u03bcl did not signifi cantly differ (10 days versus 9 days, p=0.386 and 11 days versus 10 days, p=0.229, respectively). However a delay in platelet recovery with Optia device need to be confi rmed with additional data from apheresis procedures (12 vs 11 days to platelet counts >25000/\u03bcl, respectively; p=0.037). Platelet loss with Optia was less than with COBE Spectra (1278 versus 2415 x 103/\u03bcl, p=0.014). No signifi cant differences were observed for product hematocrit between Optia and COBE Spectra (5.7% versus 6.6%, p=0.392).In conclusion, the automatic Spectra Optia aphereses were associated with similar and equally variable stem cell collections as aphereses with COBE Spectra. Further data are needed to clarify the potential benefi t of lower platelet loss using Optia. Updated results will be presented in the meeting.",

Chang Hospital Ampang (Ampang, MY) Introduction: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is currently the standard treatment for various haematological malignancies. We would like to evaluate the effi cacy and quality of stem cell mobilization as well as storage in our centre for the last 5 years. Method and Results: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 404 patients between January 2007 and December 2011 who underwent peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization, using G-CSF with chemotherapy mainly consists of high dose cyclophosphamide or etoposide. Majority were lymphoma patients (Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 166; 41.08% and Hodgkin's disease (HD) 105; 25.99%), followed by multiple myeloma (MM) 70; 17.33% and acute leukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 57; 14.11% and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 6; 1.40%). There was no signifi cant difference in gender distribution but the age distribution was highly infl uenced by the type of disease with MM represented the oldest group (median age 54 year old) and HD the youngest group (median age 24 year old) respectively. We mobilized patients based on peripheral blood CD34 count (PB-CD34) cutoff points at least 10/uL; and with this criteria, 341 (84.41%) patients were successfully collected a minimal target cell dose of 2x10 6 cells/kg with the most successful groups being MM (98.48%) and HD (92.78%) as compared to others (NHL 90.08%; AML 88.10%; ALL 80%). Most of them achieved the target cell dose after fi rst apheresis (MM 84.62%; HD 78.89%; NHL 71.55%; AML 67.50%; ALL 60%). The collected stem cells were immediately sent to our stem cell laboratory for cryopreservation using 5% DMSO. The mean of stem cells viability prior cryopreservation was 99.45% (range: 92.72%-100%) and post thawing was 96.88% (range: 91.0%-99.0%) respectively.

Farafonova Federal Medical Biophisical Center n.a. A.I. Burnazian (Moscow, RU) Background: The use of G-CSF is most widespread method of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilization during past decade. This cytokine may be applied alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. When pegfi lgrastim became available, great interest appeared to replace multiple injections of conventional form of G-CSF by single injection of pegilated form. Formerly we had estimated mobilizing activity of pegfi lgrastim given as single dose of 18 mg following chemotherapy (CT). Our experience demonstrated that combination CT with pegfi lgrastim for PBSC mobilization is safe and effective. Cyclophosphamide 6 g per b.s.m. (CY6) followed by pegfi lgrastim, single dose of 18 mg (Peg-F18), shows high CD-34+ cell PB peaks, laid in restrict, well predictable time. Now we take an attempt to estimate potency of hemopoietic reconstitution after autologous transplantation (AutoT) of PBSC mobilized by CY6 and Peg-F18. The aims of our research were: to estimate the time of neutrophyl recovery and transfusiondependent thrombocytopenia resolution. Methods: Nineteen consecutive cancer patients (pts) were treated from July 2010 to December 2011. There were 7 female and 12 male, age was 20-53 y.o (median 48). Diagnoses were: aggressive lymphoma (6), multiple myeloma (6), poor-risk Hogkin lymphoma (7). They all were mobilized by CY6+ Peg-F18 regimen. Then AutoT of received material were performed. It is important to note, that all pts were in the phase of fi rst partial response to \"fi rst line\" CT. Indication for AutoT was: to achieve the complete response. Conditioning regimens were following: Melphalan 200 mg per bsm (multiple myeloma), CBV (lymphoma), BEAM (Hogkin lymphoma). The PBSC dose estimated by CD34+ cells consisted of 3,0 -16,3 (median 4,6) million per kilo b.w. Every pt received pegilated G-CSF 6mg the next day after AutoPBSC infusion. Results: There were no transplant-related deaths in our group. Day of AutoT marked as \"day 0\". Neutrophyl recovery (more, then 0,5 thousand per microliter) was registered on day 8-17 (median 10). Transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia was resolved on day 6-17 (median 11). We did not observe transplant failure in our group. Conclusion: Our experience demonstrates that combination CY6+ Peg-F18 for PBSC mobilization allows to collect the material, suitable for further AutoT. The hematologic recovery was fast and sustained. However, this group is good-risk selective. This mobilizing regimen needs further investigation.",

The stem cell dose is the most important factor for determining speed of engraftment and outcome in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A modifi ed two-step collection technique in which the initial collection is followed by placental perfusion with 50 ml heparinised 0.9% saline has shown a 15% increase in the number of nucleated cells. Our study aim was to assess whether plerixafor could enhance recovery of CD34+ cells and change the immune profi le of the perfusate. Ten cord blood units were collected as per our standard operating procedures. After cord blood collection, 5 placentas were perfused with 50 ml heparinised 0.9% saline by slow infusion over 50 minutes and perfusate collected after 5 minutes of starting the infusion over 50 minutes (controls). The other 5 placentas were treated the same way except for the addition of 24 mg Plerixafor to the 50 ml heparinised 0.9% saline (plerixafor arm). The samples were analysed by multicolour fl ow cytometry using a combination of antibody cocktails to identify and enumerate CD34+ stem cells, T cells, T cell precursors, T cell subsets, T regulatory cells, B cells, NK and NK cell precursors, and dendritic cells. The CD34+ cells were further quantifi ed by CFU. Successful recovery of perfusate was achieved from 9 placentas (mean volume 44 ml). Percentage increase in numbers of cells recovered by perfusing the placenta was calculated from total numbers of CD34+ and CD45+ cells collected from each cord and placenta pair. There was no signifi cant difference in the perfusate volumes (48ml v 38ml, P=0.152) or recovery of CD34+ (5.06% v 5.79%, p=0.74) or CD45+ (4.69% v 2.61%, p=0.74) cells from the placenta between the 2 arms. The number of progenitor cells was similar between the cords and the perfusates. Viability of haematopoietic stem cell progenitors by CFU was also similar in the two arms. Clonal effi ciency between the 2 groups was similar (unpaired t test, p=0.2). No statistically signifi cant differences was found in the CD3, CD4, CD8 T cells, Tregs, NK, DCs, progenitor T and NK cells between the 2 groups. In this pilot study plerixafor did not signifi cantly increase the CD34+ stem cells and other cell subsets. It is possible that the duration of infusion was too short to mobilise the stem cells. Further studies are warranted to investigate this further.",

Patients/Methods: Between April 2003 and January 2011 there were 256 HSCs washing processes for autologous transplantation. Until June 2009 thawing was performed in a bath at 37\u00b0C (n=181) and then in a dry heat bath (n=75). 25% of the freezing process (n=64) had a frozen process volume >400 ml (range 100-1100) and a freezing time >3 months (range 0,2-92). The variables studied were the following: total nucleated cells (TNC), CD34+ cells, viability, absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), microbial contamination and adverse effects (AE) of the infusion. Results: The median volume infused was 197 ml (range 70-473). The median pre and post-processing TNC was 5,6 and 4,4x10 8 /kg respectively, recovery of 80%. The median pre and post CD34+ cells was 3,2 and 3,1x10 6 /kg respectively, with a recovery of 94%. The viability post wash was more than 75% to 90% of the products. There was no relationship between cell recovery and freezing time. The median ANC reduction in pre and post-process product was 70%. The median TNC in the stock liquid waste was 0,02x10 8 /kg. Microbial contamination was detected in 11% of the processes (n=25: 18 coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS), 1 Acinetobacter iwoffi , 1 Alcaligenes sp., 1 Neisseria cinerea, 1 Serratia plumutica, 1 Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 2 Streptococcus). In only one case, CNS was isolated in blood cultures of a patient. Of the contaminated products, 22 were thawed in a bath at 37\u00b0 and 3 in a dry bath (p=0,02). There were no relevant technical problems during the washing of HSCs. During infusion, the following reactions were noted: desaturation (n=2), nausea and vomiting (n=8), and vasovagal syncope (n=5), although none of them were serious. Conclusion: The semi-automatic washing HSCs is associated with a low percentage of infusional AE without causing signifi cant cell loss or contamination of the product obtained, and this is even lower if the thawing is done in dry heat bath.",

Labrador, A. Rodr\u00edguez, P. G\u00f3mez, F. Martinez, M. Alvarez, A. Torres Reina Sofi a Hospital (Cordoba, ES) Objectives: Many clinical advances in the management of allohematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) have been made. We analyze if these advances improve on the outcome of allo-HSCT in our center. Methods: 712 allo-HSCT were done in the last 30 years in our hospital: 565 related and 147 unrelated. The source of progenitor cells was bone marrow in 577, peripheral blood in 97 and cord blood in 38. We divided patients according to the decade in which the allo-HSCT was done: 1980-1990 (n=166); 1991-2000 (n=248) y 2001-2010 (n=298) .We analyzed the characteristis of donors and receptors, source of stem cells,conditionig regimen, aGVHD prophylaxis, aGVHD incidence,transplant related mortality (TRM), relapse and survival. Results: The mean age of the receptor has increase: 20 y in the fi rst, 28 y in the second and 31 y in the third decade (p<0,05). Bone marrow was the only source of stem cells in the fi rst decade dropping to a 57% in the third decade. Unrelated allo-HSCTs were a 12,5% in the second decade and a 38,5 % in the third. Mortality has decreased signifi cantly in each decade (59,6% in the fi rst and 45% in the third; p<0,05). In related allo-HSCT we observe a reduction of mortality (50,4% in the second decade and 41,5% in the third), but this reduction is seems remarkably in unrelated allo-HSCT with a mortality of 71% in the second decade and 50,4% (p=0,041) in the third decade. In idintical-sibling allo-HSCT, the MRT-100 has dropped from 10,6% in the fi rst decade to 7,2% in the third (p<0,05). Mortality due to relapse has fallen (30,6% in the fi rst decade and 17,9% in the third; p<0,05) as well as mortality due to aGVHD (12,8% in the fi rst decade vs 6% in the third; p<0,05.The appearance of aGVHD grade II-IV vs grade 0-I was associated with an increase in mortality in receptors with non-malignant diseases (42,8% vs 14,4%; p=0,023) but in receptors with malignant diseases was lesser (35,9% vs 41,4%; p=0,02). Conclusions: Despite an increase in the mean age of the receptors and an increase in the complexity of allo-HSCT we observe a signifi cant reduction in the mortality in the last decade as well as a signifi cant reduction in the TRM-100 and in the mortality due to relapse (probably due to an indication of the transplantation in early phases of the diseases). We observe a signifi cant reduction of relapse in receptors with aGVHD II-IV and a signifi cant improvement in the survival of receptors that receive an unrelated allo-HSCT in the last decade. We examined retrospectively in our center the outcome of 30 patients who received unrelated HSCT with a HLA-DRB3 or -DRB4 mismatched donor (study group) and we compared with a cohort of 30 patients (control group) with the same characteristics except for the DRB3 or DRB4 donor mismatching. In the study group, there were 16 patients with 10/10 HLA identical donor among them 11 had a DRB3 mismatch and 5 had a DRB4 mismatch. There were 14 patients with 9/10 HLA identical donor among them 9 had a DRB3 mismatch and 5 had a DRB4 mismatch. In the control group, there were 16 patients with 10/10 HLA identical donor and 14 patients with 9/10 HLA identical donor. After HSCT, 27 (90%) patients in the study group engrafted while 29 (96%) engrafted in the control group. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD\u22652 at 3 months was 37% (95%CI, 28-46) and 30% (95%CI, 22-39) for the study and control groups respectively, with a same cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at one year of 20% (95%CI, 12-28). At day 90 post HSCT, 17 (63%) patients in the study group were in CR and 25 (86%) in CR in the control group. After a median follow-up of 5 months (range, 0.2-46) and 13 months (range, 0.5-60) for study and control groups respectively, the median OS was 7 months (range, and 21 months (range, 11-NR) with a 2-years probability of 25% (95%CI, 12-51) and 41% (95%CI, 25-69) respectively; the median PFS was 3 months (range, 0.2-46) and 10 months (range, 1-60) with a 2-years probability of 16% (95%CI, 6-42) and 37% (95%CI, 21-63) respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 year was the same for the two groups with 30% (95%CI, 22-39); the cumulative incidence of TRM at 3 months and 1 year were 17% (95%CI, 10-24) vs. 3% (95%CI, 0-7) and 37% (95%CI, (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) vs. 10% (95%CI, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] for study and control groups respectively. The multivariate analysis showed a signifi cant worse OS in 9/10 mismatched patients with or without a DRB3 or DRB4 mismatch (HR=5.3; [95%CI, 1.6-18] p=0.006); 10/10 matched patients with a DRB3 or DRB4 mismatch (HR=3.9; [95%CI, 1.2-12] p=0.02) and patients not in CR at transplantation (HR= 4.4; [95%CI, p=0.004); similarly, the same groups had a worse TRM in multivariate analysis, (HR=6; [95%CI, p=0.02) and (HR=3.5; [95%CI, 1.02-12] p=0.04) respectively. In view of the important impact of these loci mismatches on clinical outcomes, it should be considered in the unrelated donor selection. O. Paina, N. Stancheva, E. Babenko, E. Semenova, B.

Afanasyev R.Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of children hematology and transplantation (St. Petersburg, RU) Introduction: Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) has made tremendous progress over the past 20 years and has become a feasible option for leukemia patients without HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. The early complications including severe acute graft-versushost disease (aGVHD), graft failure, delayed engraftment and in addition, disease recurrence limited the usage of this approach. NK-cell alloreactivity is determined by the presence in the donor of NK cells expressing inhibitory killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) that recognize HLA class I allotypes present in the donor but lacking in the recipient. This phenomenon can improve event-free survival (EFS) after haplo-HSCT, especially in AML patients.",

Methods: Fifteen children and adolescents with ALL were included in the study. Median age 8 y.o. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , sex ratio F:M 9:5. The median number of infused CD34+ cells was 10,2\u00d7106 (range 4,5-25,8) per kg b.w. Children with evidence of donor engraftment who survived more than 14 days and more than 90 days from transplantation were evaluated for occurrence of aGVHD and chronic GVHD, respectively, according to established criteria. aGvHD I-II0 -4pts, aGvHD III-IV0 -3pts; chGvHD limited -2pts, chGvHD extensive -3pts. Results: One-year overall survival (OS) was higher in patients after KIR-ligand mismatched haplo-HSCT compared with KIR-ligand matched haplo-HSCT: 43% and 18% respectively. aGVHD was investigated in 7 pts, but it was not the main reason of mortality (III-IV stage in 3 pts). Five patients alive and achieved complete remission. Conclusions: Haplo-HSCT is effective therapy for patients with very high risk acute leukemia. Apparently, NK-alloreactivity increased OS in patient with very high risk ALL. The main reason of treatment failure after haplo-HSCT was relapse which requires continuing therapy by immunotherapy with/without chemotherapy.",

Bo, Q. Wang, Y. Zhao, Y. Jing, S. Wang, H. Zhu, L. Dou, L. Wang Chinese PLA General Hospital (Beijing, CN) Objectives: Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been increasingly applied in high-risk hematologic patients due to the absence of HLA matched donors. The aim of this study is to investigate the effi cacy and safety of unmanipulated haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells transplantation (PBSCT) for hematologic malignancies. Study Design and Methods: Patients who underwent unmanipulated HLA-mismatched/haploidentical PBSCT from July 2007 to March 2010 with high-risk hematologic malignancies were enrolled for retrospective analysis. Results: Twenty-one patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies underwent unmanipulated HLA-mismatched/haploidentical PBSCT with myeloablative conditioning. The numbers of CD34+ cells infused at transplantation were 4.81 (2.61-11.47 ) \u00d7106/kg. Patients achieved myeloid and platelet engraftment at a median of 16.5 days and 20 days, respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) on day 100 was 52.7\u00b110.7%, and the 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was 39.5\u00b110.6%. Cumulative incidence of CMV antigenemia and hemorrhagic cystitis within 100 days after PBSCT were 59.5\u00b116.7% and 34.8\u00b113.3%, respectively. One hundred-day transplantation related mortality (TRM) rate and the 2-year cumulative TRM rate were 14.3% and 20.5\u00b17.8%, respectively. The 2-year cumulative overall survival was 62.1\u00b111.4% and the probability of disease-free survival at 2-years was 55.6\u00b110.7% with a 16-months median follow-up. Conclusion: Unmanipulated PBSCT is a promising protocol in HLA-mismatched/haploidentical transplant settings.",

Recently, Liu et al have used modifi ed a reduced intensity protocol in an older cohort of patients, reproducing the early engraftment kinetics, but also leading to persistent mixed chimerism and raising concerns about the risk of relapse in this setting. Here, we present our own experience with a non-TBI myeloablative dual transplant strategy in older patients with high-risk AML. Methods: Eight consecutive high-risk MDS/AML patients (age 50 years, 32-64; 5 refractory to >1 chemotherapy lines, 2 relapsed after previous BMT, 2 with active AML at time of BMT (17% and 22% blasts); 02/2009-07/2011; Table 1 ), received 12 mg/kg Busulfan, 100 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide, 120 mg/m 2 Fludarabine, and 4 mg/kg Thymoglobulin, followed by UCB single units (2.84x10 7 /kg median TNC and 1.16x10 5 /kg CD34+ cells), and haploidentical mobilized CD34+ cells (median 4.72x10 6 /kg, with <1x10 4 /Kg CD3+). GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine and prednisone. Results: All cases engrafted neutrophils (>0.5x10 9 /L; day +11, 10-17) and platelets (>20 x10 9 /L; +21, 12-95), and there were no secondary graft failures. Two cases had grade II acute GVHD, and 1 case had a quiescent chronic limited GVHD. Opportunistic infections occurred mainly after granulocyte engraftment: 3 CMV reactivations (2 in the context of treatment for of acute GHVD) and 2 hemorrhagic cystitis by BK virus.",

Conclusions: These data reproduce the promising results of the UCB-haploidentical strategy in an independent series of patients.

Median age in this cohort of pts was 23 (16-32) years, M/F ratio 11/7. Pts were suffering from various diseases: 2 AML, 9 ALL, 4 CML, 1 MDS, 2 AA. Median follow up is 35 (range months. Relapse had occured at a median of 19,1 months after fi rst allo SCT (range 7-73). Graft rejection was observed after one year from fi rst SCT in both cases with aplastic anaemia. Pts with acute and chronic leukemias had received \" salvage \" chemotherapy (Flag-IDA) and afterwards despite of marrow fi ndings, underwent second allogeneic SCT with reduced intensity conditioning. Pts with aplastic anaemia were conditioned with Cyclophosphamide and ATG. All pts had received stem cells from same identical sibling donor. Peripheral blood was source of stem cells in 16 pts and \" primed \" bone marrow in 2 pts. Prevention of graft versus host disease (GvHD) was modifi ed according to specifi c situation (complete absence of prophylaxis in the cases of leukemia relapses or combination of Cyclosporin A with Metothrexate or MMF in the graft rejection or graft failure). Results: Engraftment was observed in all pts with respect to count of polymorphonuclears after 16 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) days and platlets after 21 (12-37) days. Acute (a) GvHD was observed in 6 pts (33,3%) and chronic (c) GvHD in 12 pts (66,6%). Overall survival (OS) of all our pts is 33,3% with median follow up 35 months. Vast majority of alive pts had mild or moderate cGvHD without serious infl uence on their quality of life. Conclusion: Our modest results have showed benefi t of second SCT as treatment option for selected cohort of pts who have failed after fi rst allografting. Further investigation on larger, homogenuos groups of pts is needed.",

Marcos, R. Arrieta La Paz University Hospital (Madrid, ES) Objective: To analyze outcomes of 15 patients with severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from haploidentical donors (HD), unrelated cord blood donors (UCBD) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) unrelated donor (URD), at six months from transplant. Methods: A retrospective study of medical records from 15 patients transplanted for SCID who received HSCT between 2001 and 2011 at our center (Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain). Results: 15 patients with SCID were treated with HSCT, 7 received HD from peripheral blood (group A), 6 UCSCD (group B) and 2 URD from bone marrow (group C). Median age at transplant was 17.2 months. The molecular defects were known in 66% of our patients, being the most frequent those who have mutations in the gene encoding the common gamma chain, RAG1/RAG2 and HLA class II defi ciency (Table 1) . Survival rate at six months was 71% in group B, 100% in group C and 50% in group A. Incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versushost-disease (GVHD) were 16% in group A, 33% in group B and 50% in group C. About post transplant infections, only four patients (26.6% of the total) from group A did not develop infection by gram negative. Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis after HSCT was observed in 28.5% of patients from group A and 33.3% in group B. Chimerism was evaluated at six month, 43% of patients in group A presented complete chimera (CC), 67% in group B and 50% in group C. Conclusions: Our study suggests that other sources of hematopietic stem cells as haploidentical and cord blood donors should be consider in the absence of a relative with identical HLA.",

The use of xenogenic protein free GMP-compliant growth media, is a mandatory prerequisite for clinical-grade MSC isolation and expansion. Pooled Human Platelet Lysate (HPL) has been effi ciently implemented into MSC clinical scale manufacturing as an animal serum substitute. In this study, we compared HPL as a supplement of MSC culture medium to Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) usually used for MSC expansion. Moreover, to upgrade quality/safety we decided to test inactivated HPL (iHPL) compared to non-inactivated HPL for use in the clinicalscale expansion of MSCs. Methods: BM samples were directly plated at a density of 10000 cells/cm 2 using 3 different culture mediums: 1) alphaMEM+10 % HPL; 2) alpha MEM+10% HPL (iHPL ) both with+ 2U/ml of heparin; 3) MSC medium (Stem Cell Technologies) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), usually used for MSC isolation and expansion. HPL was obtained from 10 to 15 Buffy-Coats derived platelet concentrates (BC-PCs) and iHPL was inactivated with INTERCEPT Blood System (Cerus). At each passage, MSC morphology, cellular growth (cPD), immunophenotype (CD90, CD73, CD105, 45-34-14, CD271 and CD146), kariotype and sterility were analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed with Wilcoxon signed Rank Test-paired samples. Results: MSCs cultivated in alphaMEM+10% HPL (HPL group) appeared smaller and more numerous than MSCs in MSC medium (MSC medium group). Between the two groups, no differences were observed in the number of fi broblast colonyforming cells (CFU-F), but the CFU-F of HPL group are richer in the number of cells than those of MSC medium group. At the 3rd passage, the cPD of MSCs was 10% higher in the HPL cell group than in the MSC medium group, while no differences were observed in terms of immunophenotype, multipotent capacity or kariotype. The sterility was negative in all the samples analyzed. No statistical differences were found among iHPL and HPL in terms of MSC expansion effi ciency. Conclusion: HPL represents a good GMP-compliant alternative to animal serum for MSC clinical production and is more advantageous especially in terms of cellular growth. Moreover, the inactivation procedure improves HPL quality in terms of safety.",

Gruhn, J. Voigt, N. Pfaffendorf-Regler, I. Wolff, F. Zintl, J.F. Beck University Hospital Jena (Jena, DE) Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pivotal immunomodulatory cytokine, which can promote the growth of activated CD8+ T cells leading to the maintenance of antitumor function in vivo. The IL10-592 CC genotype is associated with higher production of IL-10 than the AC or AA genotype. Because IL-10 may promote the development of alloimmunity we hypothesized that the IL-10-592 CC genotype in the donor reduces the risk of relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A cohort of 211 children (median age, 12 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=100), acute myeloid leukemia (n=62), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=30) or chronic myeloid leukemia (n=19) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow (n=153) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (n=58; T-cell depleted: n=26) in a single center and/or their respective donors was genotyped of IL-10 gene for rs1800872 using TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Cell samples from the donor were available in 174 cases and from the patient in 197 cases. The IL-10-592 CC genotype was present in 82 of the 174 donors (47.1%) and in 104 of the 197 patients (52.8%). Interestingly, we found a signifi cantly reduced incidence of relapse in patients who were transplanted from a donor with the IL-10-592 CC genotype (15.9% versus 30.4%; p=0.016). In addition, we observed a signifi cant increase of event-free survival (p=0.019) and a signifi cant increase of overall survival (p=0.040) if the IL-10-592 CC genotype was present in the donor. The occurrence of the IL10-592 CC genotype, in either donors or recipients, had no signifi cant impact on treatment related mortality, acute and chronic graft-versus host disease. In conclusion, IL-10-592 CC genotype in the donor confers strong protection against relapse leading to a signifi cant increase of event-free survival and overall survival after HSCT in children with hematological malignancies. This is the fi rst study to describe an association of IL-10 gene polymorphism with relapse rate after HSCT. Selecting a donor with the IL-10-592 CC genotype could be a useful therapeutic strategy for improving the fi nal outcome after allogeneic HSCT.",

Each country has one or more national HPC donor registries and, in Italy, the unrelated healthy donors (HDs) have to sign the initial consent acknowledging that they have been informed about registration on a donor list, giving their availability to be called until their 55th birthday. Aim: To evaluate whether Lenograstim-mobilized HPC in \"elderly\" HDs (i.e. aged more than 55 years at the day of apheresis) is safe and effective as in young HDs (i.e. younger than 55 years at the day of apheresis). Material and Methods: 231 consecutive, non selected related HDs were compared: young HDs (n=185, mean age 40.6 years, range 15-54.8) and elderly HDs (n=46, mean age 59.6, range 55.1-70.0 years). Results: The two groups were comparable in terms of gender, body-weight, G-CSF dose and days of administration. CD34+ cell blood peak value (cells/microl) was higher in the young HDs group on day 4 (48\u00b135 vs 34\u00b126 R=-0-16 p=0.01) but not on day 5 (72\u00b150 vs 72\u00b1107, R=.0.02 p=0.7).

Panico\" Hospital (Tricase, IT) Introduction: The apheresis of peripheral blood stem cells (aPBSC) is generally safe but not completely risk-free. The adverse events in PBSC healthy donors (HD) were reported in 0.6% of cases, the great majority of which were represented by hypocalcemia, vasovagal reactions, thrombocytopenia and problems with vascular access. Hypokalemia has not been suffi ciently considered. The pathogenesis of hypokalemia during a PBSC collection is unknown and it may be due to the metabolic processing of the dextrose that stimulates the release of insulin and cause intracellular shifting of potassium. Patients. Between 2006 and 2011, 45 HD were subjected to 88 aPBSC. The mean age of HD was 47.6 years. The HD have been subject to assessments in accordance with the standards GITMO for PBSC donors. G-CSF was administered at a dose of 10 \u03bcg/Kg/day s.c. On average 7.94 (\u00b12.22) x 10\u02c66 CD34+/Kg were collected processing average 11.8 L (2-18 L) of blood (on average 2.3 blood volume). The mean ACD-A infused was 1.08 L (\u00b10.281 L). On average were administered 3 fl of calcium(Ca)-gluconate for aPBSC: 40 HD received Ca-gluconate in continuous infusion and 3 HD at the onset of paresthesias. Results. In 72.4% of HD was observed a signifi cant reduction in the levels of potassium (K+) after aPBSC: the mean before aPBSC was 4.09mEq/L and after aPBSC was 3.1 mEq/L (p<0.0001). In 42 HD (93.3%), hypokalemia was corrected with oral K+ supplementation, while in 3 HD (6.7%) the therapy was performed i.v. with 1-2 fl KCl. One female donor of 50-year-old developed asymptomatic and moderate hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L) after aPBSC (the baseline K+ was 3.8 mEq/L). Despite the correction of K+ orally, about 10 hours after the end of aPBSC, the donor showed an episode of micturition syncope associated with paroxysmal atrial fi brillation (PAF). Conclusion. The problem of hypokalemia is not negligible, in our study involving up to more than 70% of HD undergoing aPBSC. K+ supplementation and dosing are largely empirical and guided by serum K+ levels. I.v. K+ supplementation is reserved for the treatment of severe or symptomatic hypokalemia. In one case of asymptomatic and moderate hypokalemia the correction of K+ orally has not been suffi cient to prevent the onset of PAF. Perhaps the rapid development of hypokalemia after aPBSC would have required a treatment with i.v. K+ in order to correct more quikkly hypokalemia, to cancel the risk of arrhythmia and to preserve the physical integrity of the HD.",

Sachs University Hospital Marburg (Marburg, DE) Background: Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are the most common stem cell source for autologous or allogeneic transplantation. Since 2008, three different collection systems were used in our hospital. Fresenius COM.TEC (Fresenius Healthcare, Bad Homburg, Germany) works with continuous blood fl ow by collecting PBPC cyclically at the end of each individually determined separation cycle in a one stage separation chamber. Both COBE Spectra and Optia (Caridian BCT, Garching, Germany) work with continuous blood fl ow too. While the COBE Spectra MNC apheresis system permits manually controlled continuous PBPC harvesting, the Spectra Optia provides an automated buffy coat interface control and combines centrifugation with subsequent cellular collection into an elutriation chamber with intermittent PBPC harvesting. Methods: Between 2008 and 2011, in a single-center trial, 119 autologous and 53 allogenic apheresis procedures were compared to validate feasibility and effectiveness of the different systems. Results: All three groups were comparable with regard to donor characteristics and the quality of the fi nal product. In contrast, collection effi cacy (CE1=[CD34+ cells collected]/[mean of CD34+ cells processed]) varied signifi cantly with lowest results obtained with the Spectra. CE1 for COM.TEC and Optia was comparable; both instruments also produced lower white blood cell contamination in the product compared to the Spectra, but at the expenses of a higher product volume and longer apheresis time. The highest volume was obtained with COM.TEC. There was no signifi cant difference in platelet loss between all three systems; however, a subgroup of allogeneic donors with high platelet counts lost more platelets with COM.TEC than with the other systems. Detailed results (mean and range) are given in Table 1 . Conclusions: Replacing COBE Spectra by Spectra Optia leads to signifi cantly higher collection effi cacy but longer procedure time which may be improvable with extended experience. Both Optia and COM.TEC have comparable collection effi cacy. A lower product volume and less platelet loss in allogeneic donors may be favourable characteristics of the Optia system.",

The recipient needs enough hematopoietic stem cells for a successful allograft but there is no need to collect a higher quantity of cells than required, which would imply for bone marrow harvest a longer time of anaesthesia, a higher volume harvested and a higher quantity of cells collected, consequently a longer time of recuperation. We try to discriminate the elements which can explain this difference between requested and collected quantities in the aim of improving the process. Material and Methods: Between January 2009 and November 2011, 2086 graft products were collected for French patients. Among them, 1472 are peripheral blood stem cells and 614 bone marrow harvests. For each couple donor/patient, the difference (higher or lower) between requested and collected product is noted, both in the case of bone marrow and in the case of peripheral blood stem cells. The proportional weight between donor and recipient related to the TNC/kg donor requested in bone marrow harvest, and the CD34/kg donor requested in PBSC collection are both specifi cally studied. Discussion: For each couple donor/patient, a difference superior to 20% between requested and collected product is noted in about 70% of the products. Over a 20% difference, 50% of products collected are higher than requested, and 17% are lower. If we consider Bone Marrow harvest, 25% are 20% lower than expected and 32% higher.

If we consider Peripheral Blood Stem Cell collection, 12% are lower than expected, and 59% higher. The proportional weight between donor and recipient shows that for PBSC it has no incidence at all on the result. This allows us to inscribe low weight donors for adults as well as for children.

Boga, H. Ozdogu Baskent University Hospital (Adana, TR) Background: The process of peripheral blood stem cell collection from patients and donors is similar to a normal blood donation, while the application is similar to blood transfusion. However, patients/donors carry anxiety concerning feeling of discomfort and pain during the process and possible side effects after the application. The use of audiovisual method during the informing process may reduce worries and may have a positive effect on the process of approval. To our knowledge, there has not been adequate study on this method of informing for stem cell transplantation (SCT). The effectiveness of the approval process was examined by performing the audiovisual informing method to the patients/donors. Method: All the cases, that are implemented patient/donor informing process between the years 2008-2011, were included in the study. In the process, until the year 2010, an information Form including appropriate expressions to the laws and regulations were used. Since 2010, in addition to this form for patient/donor informing process, a DVD animation program that was produced for our center and offers several language options (Technical Media, Adana, Turkey) has been used. Informing process was evaluated by using Patient/donor Informing Functionality Form. Patient compliance was evaluated by the patient's physician, clinical directors and transplant nurse with compliance scoring. Results: During the informatory process, within a total of 96 patient/donor, that the audiovisual method was not used, 9 (9.2%), within a total of 122 patient/donor, that the audiovisual method was used, 12 (9.4%), did not give consent to the procedure (P> 0.05). One patient (0,8%) despite the language problem, all the cases completed the informing process. While from the group, that gets the information without audiovisual method, 4 (4.2%) cases returned because of the some complaints related with hospital care, 2 (1.6%) within the used group, fi lled in complaint form. (P<0.05). The patient non-compliance score was found similar in the audio visual method used in compared to notused group (0,505 vs 0,506; p>0.05). Comment: The use of audiovisual method at the Patient/Donor Informatory Meetings for the purpose of stem cell collection and transplantation is an easy process to implement. It was found that using this method has not signifi cantly infl uenced the approval process, however has been effective in reducing the patient/donor complaints.",

Valkova, M. Dobrovolna, M. Markova, M. Vrana, M. Hricinova, B. Prochazka, P. Cetkovsky, A. Vitek Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion (Prague, CZ) We performed a retrospective analysis of allogeneic transplants from January 1995 -August 2010. A total of 614 patients, 223 were transplanted from related donors (203 from identical siblings (IS), 20 from mismatched relatives), 391 pts were transplanted from unrelated donors, of whom 200 were matched (MUD) 10/10, 112 with 9/10 single HLA antigen/allele mismatch and 79 with \u22648/10 mismatches. Different diagnoses were represented as follows: AML 182, ALL 70, MDS 103, CML 119, lymphoproliferation 95, myelofi brosis 39, SAA 5, FA1. A more detailed analysis was then performed for unrelated transplants only, comparing MUD 10/10 vs 9/10 mismatch in the individual loci (A, B, C, DR, DQ) and vs \u22648/10 mismatched donors. Results: The results of 10/10 IS and 10/10 MUD were comparable in all investigated parameters. When comparing the results of MUD 10/10 vs 9/10 (at any HLA locus), the groups did not differ in terms of OS, PFS and NRM. In transplants using donors \u22648/10, the OS, PFS and NRM were signifi cantly worse than 10/10. In terms of other prognostic factors, in the univariate analysis we identifi ed: the presence of aGVHD signifi cantly worsened OS and NRM, while cGVHD signifi cantly improved OS and decreased relapse incidence without affecting the NRM. We observed less cGVHD when using ATG, less aGVHD when using RIC, less aGVHD when using bone marrow and signifi cantly worse OS, PFS, NRM in advanced disease. Age (\u226550 years and \u226560) had no impact in terms of OS, PFS and NRM. We observed signifi cantly worse OS, PFS and NRM for the period 1995-1999. We did not demonstrate the infl uence of neither the AB0 mismatch nor sex mismatch. In multivariate analysis, the following factors were identifi ed as signifi cant for OS: age, disease stage, diagnosis and HLA mismatch \u22648/10, for PFS: disease stage, diagnosis and HLA mismatch \u22648/10, for NRM: age, disease stage, HLA mismatch \u22648/10, for aGVHD: age and conditioning, for cGVHD: disease stage, conditioning and ATG administration. Conclusions: Comparable results of transplants from IS and MUD. Probably acceptable mismatch 9/10 (small groups for meaningful comparisons). Worse results in mismatches 8/10 and more. Better results in patients with cGVHD. Acute GVHD does not bring any benefi t. Administration of ATG reduces the incidence of cGVHD with no differences in OS. Much worse results of advanced disease in all monitored parameters.",

Comparison with transplants from 10/10 HLA unrelated donors and siblings M. Michallet, M. Sobh, S. Morisset, M. Detrait, H. Labussiere, N. Tedone, S. Ducastelle, F. Barraco, Y. Chelghoum, X. Thomas, F. Nicolini Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud (Pierre Benite, FR) To evaluate the outcome of allo-HSCT from 9/10 HLA mismatched unrelated donors compared to those from 10/10 HLA identical unrelated donors and siblings; we retrospectively studied the outcome of 213 patients who received allo-HSCT for different hematological malignancies, 121 (57%) from HLA identical siblings, 63 (29%) from 10/10 HLA identical unrelated donors and 29 (14%) from 9/10 HLA mismatched unrelated donors between 2006 and 2011 at our institution. The different patient characteristics are described in Table 1 . After HSCT, engraftment was signifi cantly lower in the 9/10 HLA group (90%) than in the 10/10 HLA group (95%) than in the sibling group (99%), (p=0.03); the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD\u22652 at 3 months was 32% (23-41), 20% (15-26) and 27% (23-32) respectively; the cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD at one year was 21% (13-30), 9% (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) and 17% (14-21) for the 3 groups respectively. After a median follow-up of 8 months in the 9/10 HLA group, 10 months (0-60) in the 10/10 HLA group and 18 months in the siblings group, the median OS was 10 months (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) , 18 months and 60 months (31-NR) respectively with a 2-years probability of 19% (8-44), 43% (31-59) and 63% (54-74) respectively. There was a higher but not signifi cant relapse incidence at one year in the 9/10 HLA group compared to other groups while the TRM was signifi cantly higher with a cumulative incidence at 1 year of 45% (35-55) vs. 33% (27-39) for 10/10 and 12%(9-15) for siblings, (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, OS was negatively affected by unrelated donors [9/10 HR=5 (2.7-10), p=0.0001; 10/10 HR=2 (1.2-4) , p=0.01], female donors [HR=2 (1.4-4) , p=0.03] and disease status <CR1 or <chronic phase 1 [HR=3 (1.4-6) , p=0.003]; while the TRM was negatively affected by unrelated donors , p<0.001; 10/10 HR=4 (1.2-10), p=0.03], female donors [HR=3 (1.2-7); p=0.01] and ABO minor incompatibility [HR=2. 5 (1.2-5) , p=0.01]. We showed that allo-HSCT from 9/10 HLA mismatched unrelated donors have a signifi cantly worse OS than those from matched unrelated donors and siblings; this was mainly due to an increased TRM in this group. Patients in fi rst CR or CP could benefi t the more from matched or 9/10 unrelated allo-HSCT while the use of transplants from 9/10 HLA unrelated donors in patients not in CR1 should be limited to clinical trials.",

When considering matching variables between the 2 CBUs and the recipient, for sex matching: in 10 cases, CBUs were both matched with the recipient, in 1 case both mismatched and in 20 cases, only 1 CBU was mismatched with recipient. For ABO compatibility, in 7 cases, CBUs were both compatible with the recipient, in 13 cases both were incompatible and in 1 case, only one was incompatible. For HLA matching, in 18 cases, both CBUs were 4/6 with the recipient and in 13 cases, only one CBU was 5/6. When considering HLA matching between the 2 CBUs, there were 7 with 3/6 HLA matching, 17 with 4/6, 6 with 5/6 and 1 with 6/6. After transplantation, 25 (81%) patients engrafted among them, 6 had mixed chimerism (presence of the 2 CBUs) and 19 had one dominant CBU. Non-engrafted patients were in relapse or progressive disease and received RIC before allo-HSCT. There were 13 patients who developed acute GVHD\u22652 (8 grade III-IV) and 6 chronic GVHD (3 limited and 3 extensive). After a median follow-up of 6.5 months (range: 1-54), the median OS was not reached with a 1 year probability of 58% (95%CI: 42-80), only 3 patients relapsed. The cumulative incidence of TRM was 37% (95%CI: 28-46). A multivariate model that studied the different matching possibilities (sex, ABO and HLA) between the 2 CBUs together and then between the 2 CBUs with the recipient combined to CNT and CD34 cells number, showed that only the sex matching between the 3 partners can determine the dominant CBU later (p=0.04). In multivariate analysis, no factor impacted the engraftment while factors that impacted on OS were age [HR=1. In conclusion, sex matching between the 3 partners seems to play a role in the determination of the dominant CBU later and its installation in the recipient.",

Ostadali Dehaghi, S.A. Mousavi, M. Iravani, B. Bahar, M. Jahani, F. Ghaffari, A. Jalali, A. Ghavamzadeh Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center (Tehran, IR) Objectives: To assess the effect of mismatched relative transplantation on Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and survival. Only 30% of patients who need transplantation have Human-Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor. Therefore we are forced to use other related matched donors. The impact of HLA mismatching on transplantation outcome remains unclear. Methods: This study included 95 patients (age: 5 months to 52 yrs) had undergone transplantation from 1992 to 2011 in our center. The patients were transplanted from other-related donors (not siblings), except haploidentical ones. Eighty percent of donors were fully HLA -matched and 20% were one antigen HLA -mismatched. Sixty three percent of donors were parents, 20% uncle/aunt, 12% grandparents, 4% cousins and 1% offspring. Patients were transplanted with bone marrow (58%) and peripheral blood (42%). The most common diseases were major beta-thalassemia, Fanconi anemia and acute leukemias. Results: The median age of recipients was 6 years old. The male to female ratio was 58:37. All of the patients underwent successful graft procedures. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 14 days (range: 9-62) in matched and 12 (range: 10-22) in mismatched group, (P=0.684). The median time to platelet engraftment was 21 (range: 9-75) and 18 (range:15-51) days (P=0.914) in matched and mismatched groups, respectively. The median onset of aGvHD was 10 (range: 3-38) in matched versus 8 days (range: 3-17) in mismatched group. The most common grade of aGVHD in the matched group was I, II while II, III in mismatched one. The cumulative incidence of acute GvHD, 17 days after transplantation was 43.4% (95% CI: 32%-54.2%) in matched and 78.9% (95% CI: 50.6%-92.1%) in mismatched (P<0.001), respectively. Median follow-up time was 317 days (range: 30-3632). The one-year overall survival was 77.7% (SE: 5.9%) in matched and 54.3% (SE: 12.5%) in mismatched group which was statistically signifi cant (P=0.037). The most common causes of death were GvHD and infection in matched while GvHD and drug toxicity in mismatched group. Conclusion: The overall survival was signifi cantly less in mismatched group; however, they were fi rst and second degree relatives of recipients. Although engraftment occurred a bit sooner (not signifi cant) in mismatched group, the cumulative incidence of aGvHD was higher and onset time was earlier. The conditioning regimen and immunosuppressive therapy for mismatched transplantation must be revised. A.A. Hamidieh, M.R. Ostadali, A. Hamdi, K. Alimoghaddam, M. Jahani, B. Bahar, S.A. Mousavi, M. Iravani, A. Jalali, M. Jalili, M. Behfar, L. Sharifi , A. Ghavamzadeh Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Objectives: To investigate the outcome of HLA-matched otherrelated HSCT and compare the results of HLA-matched sibling HSCT in Beta-thalassemia major pediatric patients. Methods: We evaluated the outcome of transplantation in 25 consecutive children with severe thalassemia who underwent allo-HSCT from other-related-donor (group 1). We also compared the results obtained from 25 thalassemia major children who received sibling-donor cells for allo-HSCT (group 2). Group 2 was matched with group 1 with respect to age, gender of donor to recipient, thalassemia risk class, and the year of transplantation. Patients in both groups received the same busulfanbased conditioning regimen. Results: The median age of patients was 9 years (72% male). In each group, 4 patients were classifi ed into risk class 1; 13 risk class 2; and 8 risk class 3 of the Pesaro classifi cation system. The most common source of stem cells in group 1 was bone marrow while in group 2 was peripheral blood stem cells (p=0.024). There was no signifi cant difference between two groups for the time of neutrophil and platelet engraftments. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease by 21 days after transplantation for group 1 and group 2 was 60% (95% confi dence interval (CI) of 38%-77%) and 40% (95% CI of 21%-59%), respectively (p=0.219). With a median follow-up period of 6 months (range: 1-43 months), the overall survival (OS) for thalassemia children in group 1 was 72.8% (SE 10.7%) compared with 85.3%% (SE 7.9%) for patients in group 2 (P=0.614). The difference between OS in two groups after adjustment for stem cell source was not signifi cant (0.677). Conclusion: The present study provides evidence supporting the consideration of other-related allo-HSCT as an appropriate therapeutic approach in thalassemia major children without matched-sibling-donors.",

Methods: Alleles of 11 mHA: HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1, ACC-1, ACC-2, HwA-9, HwA-1, UGT2B17, HY were analyzed in search of immunogenic mismatches in 62 sibling donor-recipient pairs after allo-HCT performed between 2000-2008. The median age of pts was 38(14-59) yrs. Indication for allo-HCT was AML, ALL, MDS, CML and NHL 0.6(0.2-12.9) yrs from dgn. Preparative regimen was Bu+Cy or Treo+Flu. mHA alleles were determined using Dynal AllSet mHA typing kit and PCR-SSP method. Only immunogenic mHA mismatches established according to dbMinor Database with consideration of direction (HVG or GVH) and tissue distribution were evaluated. Results: Relapse occurred in 15(24.2%) pts. Immunogenic mHA mismatches were identifi ed in 42(68%) pairs, 20(32%) pairs showed no mHA immunogenicity. 24(39%) pairs had mHA mismatched in HVG direction [autosomal 10(16%), HY 12(19%), both 2(3%)] and 24(39%) in GVH direction [autosomal 12(19%) , HY 9(15%), both 3(5%)]. Bi-directional mHA disparity was detected in 6(10%) pairs. Pts with GVH-directed HY disparity had lower both overall survival Conclusion: Immunogenic mHA mismatches may be present after alloHCT from HLA-matched siblings and may impact OS, DFS and relapse rate. The infl uence of GVH-directed HY disparity helps to understand the role donor/recipient sex difference in transplantation. Continuation of the study is necessary to establish the associations of specifi c autosomal mHA mismatches with alloHCT results.",

Methods: Retrospectively, 380 consecutive patients (median age 39, range 0.5-67 years) who underwent HSCT using HLA -A, -B, and -DRB1 allele level-matched unrelated donors at our centre during 1995-2010, were included in the study. Most patients underwent HSCT in the treatment for hematological malignancies (81%), whereas 7% and 12% of all patients were transplanted in the treatment for non-hematological malignancies and non-malignant disorders, respectively. HLA typing using PCR-SSP (Olerup-SSP) or PCR-SSO on a Luminex plat-form (One Lambda) was performed and revealed 55 HLA-DP (A1 and B1) matched and 325 mismatched donor pairs. HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 mismatch was noted in 35% and 85% of all recipient donor pairs, respectively. Results: HLA-DP (A1 or B1) mismatch compared to DP match did not affect the incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV (33% vs. 27%; P=0.20), or grades III-IV (6% vs. 8%; P=0.87). Furthermore, the incidence of chronic GVHD was similar (28% vs. 27%; P=0.49), and there was no impact on patient overall survival using DP mismatched compared to DP matched donors (55% vs. 50%, P=0.72). However, in separate analysis DPA1 mismatch was associated with decreased overall survival (HR 1.50, P=0.02), when compared to matched recipients irrespective of HLA-DPB1 and HLA-C match. In univariate analysis, HLA-DPA1 mismatch was associated with increased risk of transplant-related mortality (P=0.04), although incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were similar. Furthermore, a tendency to an increased risk of infection-related mortality was noted in patients mismatched for HLA-DPA1 (P=0.07). Conclusions: This study suggests that HLA-DPA1 mismatch is associated with inferior survival, which may be caused by an increased risk of infection-related mortality. At present there are few publications available, which investigate the role of DPA1 and DPB1 mismatch separately, and future studies to uncover the importance of DPA1 and DPB1 compatibility in unrelated HSCT are warranted.",

Methods: We analyzed 39 consecutive mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation performed from 2005 to 2011. Median age was 38 years (range, 12-63 years). Patients had been diagnosed with 10 acute myeloid leukemia, 9 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 biphenotype leukemia), 4 myelodysplastic syndromes, 4 myeloproliferative neoplasms, 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 lymphoma, 2 aplastic anemia. The median number of prior regimen was 2 (range, [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . 8 patients (21%) had received a previous hematopoietic cell transplantation (7 autologous and 1 allogeneic) and 13 patients had an advanced/active disease. The Sorror Comorbidity index was intermediate/high in 17 patients (44%). A total of 31 patients were conditioned with highdose myeloablative therapy and 8 patients were conditioned with reduced-intensity regimens. Anti-T-cell globulin (ATG) was part of the conditioning therapy in 13 patients. Standard GVHD prophylaxis consisted of calcineurin inhibitor and a short course of MTX in 28 patients or calcineurina inhibitor with mycophenolate in 11 patients. 30 (76%) patients were transplanted with bone marrow and 9 (23%) patients were transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells. All patients were HLA typed by molecular methods for 10 alleles (HLA-A, -B and -C as well as -DRB1 and -DQB1). HLA antigens were 1-locimismatched in 30 (77%) patients and 2-loci-mismatched in 9 (23%). Results: 37 patients achieved primary engraftment. 2 patients experienced a primary graft failure. By 30 days post-HSCT, complete donor chimerism was observed in 33 patients and mixed chimerism in 2 patients. The incidences of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) grade II-IV and aGVHD grado III-IV were 41% (n=16) and 18% (n=7), respectively. 7 of the patients with acute GVHD grade III-IV showed steroid resistant. The incidence of chronic GVHD in 31 evaluable patients was 26% (n=8). Five patients developed extensive chronic GVHD. After a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 3-77 months), 21 (55%) patients are alive. 15 patients of the 39 patients transplanted have died, mostly related to aGVHD (n=8) and relapse disease (n=5).

Chugreeva, E. Parovichnikova Research Centre for Hematology (Moscow, RU) Natural killer (NK) cells are the fi rst lymphocyte subset, which reconstitute the peripheral blood after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. NK cells are implicated in bone marrow engraftment, the mediation of graft-versus-leukemia effect and in the suppression of graft-versus-host disease. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) of NK cells recognize the absence of self MHC class I molecules and defi ne immune \"self\". The KIR genes are located on chromosome 19q13.4, and the genes of their HLA ligands are located on chromosome 6, so these genes segregate independently of each other. Despite the independent segregation of genes encoding KIR and HLA, there are evidences of some kind of co-evolution. If there is no dependence one could expect that KIR genotype identity between patient and sibling (potential donor of hematopoietic stem cells) in HLA-matched pairs will be the same as in not HLA-identical pa-tient/sibling pairs. The objectives of our study were to investigate the frequency of KIR genotype identity in HLA-matched patient/sibling pairs and not HLA-identical pairs. Methods: 68 patients with different hematological diseases and their 68 siblings were studied. They were divided into two groups: fi rst group consisted of 33 HLA-identical patient/sibling pairs and the second group consisted of 35 not HLA-identical patient/sibling pairs (22 HLA-haploidentical pairs and 13 pairs different for the both HLA-haplotypes). KIR genotyping was done using KIR Genotyping SSP Kit (Invitrogen, WI, USA). Differences in the frequencies of pairs carrying the same and the different KIR genotypes for patient and sibling in each group were estimated by Fisher exact test. Results: In the fi rst group there were 48.5% of KIR-genotype identical of pairs, in the second group there were only 37% of KIR-genotype identical pairs (p<0.05). 51.5% of the pairs in the fi rst group vs. 63% of pairs in the second group had different KIR genotypes. The frequencies of KIR-genotype identity in HLAhaploidentical pairs and in pairs different for the both HLA-haplotypes were the same (36.5% and 38.5%, correspondingly). Conclusion: HLA matched sibling donors share the same KIR genotypes with patients more frequently than not HLA-identical siblings. Nearly the half of HLA matched sibling donors have the same KIR genotypes as the recipients. The data do not allow excluding of the possibility of HLA infl uence on the KIR gene segregation.",

Dubois (1) To refi ne and accelerate the process of donor search by combining the results of Tiercy and EasyMatch programs and defi ne a new score for donor fi nding probability, in order to be timeand cost-effi cient, we retrospectively analyzed 104 adult and 34 pediatric patients transplanted between 2009 and 2011 after fi nding an unrelated donor (identical or not) or cord blood units. Firstly, we analyzed the HLA characteristics of each patient as previously described by Tiercy et al. to provide a HLA score with Low, intermediate or high probability to identify a suitable identical donor. Then, we used the EasyMatch software which realize a \"qualitative\" analysis that consist on checking that each HLA recipient phenotype was found among all possible pair wise combinations of 2 haplotypes of the different sets of haplotypes. Various \"quantitative\" analyses calculated the likelihood associated to each recipient phenotype for a given set of HLA genes, in a given population, at low versus high resolution typing. The EasyMatch software gives for each patient a number of potential donors sharing the same phenotype as the patient. Results: Our 138 patients were classifi ed in 5 different categories (A to E) according to the combined results of the HLA score (Tiercy) and the EasyMatch software (Table) .",

Score 0 (group A): 0% of chances to identify a 10/10 identical donor for the recipient. The choice of the source will be defi ned considering the HLA characteristics of the recipient; in case of class I rare allele or rare HLA-BC linkage disequilibrium; a cord blood unit will be easier and more rapidly available. A complementary help should be given by an associated analysis with 4-digit haplotypes as defi ned by Maiers (Human Immunology 2007, 68; 779-788) . Score 1 (groups B and C): 50% of chances to identify a suitable 10/10 identical donor. Score 2 (groups D and E): from 75 to 100% of chances to identify a suitable 10/10 identical donor. In conclusion, the use of this new scoring system allows time and cost spare. In case of low chance to fi nd a donor, physicians can have a fast redirection to fi nd another treatment alternative in order to keep an optimal results. Objectives: Although anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies (anti-HLA Abs) are important factors responsible for graft rejection in solid organ transplantation, their role in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to defi ne the incidence and profi les of anti-HLA Abs produced after allo-HSCT from HLA-mismatched unrelated donors and their impact on allo-HSCT results. Methods Anti-HLA A, B, C, DR, DQ, DP Abs were identifi ed in sera collected from 30 recipients of allo-HSCT from HLA-mismatched unrelated donors. Indication for allo-HSCT was CML (17), AML (7), ALL (4), SAA (2pts). Preparative regimen was myeloablative: treosulfan-based in 16, busulfan/cyclophosphamide(Cy) in 8, TBI/Cy in 5 and Cy/ATG in 1 pt. Standard GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine, methotrexate and pre-transplant ATG (13pts) or thymoglobulin (17pts). Source of cells was bone marrow (17pts) or peripheral blood (13pts). Sera were collected 115 to 2156 days after allo-HSCT. Two methods were used for detection of anti-HLA Abs: 1-LabScreen microbeads coated with purifi ed Class I and II HLA antigens; 2-automated DynaChip assay which uses microchips bearing HLA class I or II antigens. Results: Anti-HLA Abs were detected in 17(57%) and were not in 13(43%) pts. Anti-HLA Abs class I, II or both were detected in 5(29%), 5(29%) and 7(42%) pts, respectively. Abs were directed against HLA-A,B,C,DR,DQ. Neither anti HLA-DP nor donor-specifi c anti-HLA Abs were detected, although recipientspecifi c anti-HLA Abs were detected in one pt. Acute GVHD was observed in 14(82%) or 6(46%) pts with or without anti-HLA Abs: grade I,II,III and IV respectively in 8,4,1,1 or 4,1,0,1 pt. Chronic GVHD occurred in 10(59%) or 5(38%) pts: limited in 8 or 3 and extensive in 2 or 2 pts. Acute infections (sepsis, pneumonia) have developed in 5(29%) or 5 (38%) pts; relapse occurred in 3(17%) or 5(38%) pts with or without anti-HLA Abs. 100% donor chimerism was achieved by 16(94%) or 13(100%) pts and decreased to 25% in 8(50%) pts with Abs and to 58% in 4(30%) pts without anti-HLA Abs. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that anti-HLA Abs can appear post-transplant in mismatched allo-HSCT recipients and may be potentially responsible for the occurrence of post-transplant complications.",

Al-Zaben, H. Abu-Jazar, O. AL-Rawi, N. Hussain, F. Abdel-Rahman King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, JO) Purpose: To evaluate the probability of fi nding HLA-matched related donor for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Jordan which represent an example of developing country in general and Arabic country in particular, as data in this fi eld are scanty. Patients and Methods: Retrospective review of medical records of patients and their families who did HLA typing study at King Hussein Cancer Center between January 2003 and November 2011 was performed. Results: A total of 1200 patients were included. 65% (n=810) were pediatric (<18 years), and 35% (n=440) were adults. Fifty six percent (n=672) had malignant diseases, including acute leukemia 69% (n=470), chronic leukemia 9.4% (n=63), lymphoma 12.4% (n=83), myelodysplastic syndrome 3% (n=20), myeloproliferative diseases 3% (n=19), plasma cell disorders 1.1% (n=8), and solid tumors 0.8% (n=5). While 44% (n=528) hand non-malignant disorders including haemoglobinopathy 67.5% (n=353), bone marrow failure diseases 17.4% (n=92), primary immunodefi ciency disorders 10.7% (n=56), and inherited metabolic diseases 4.4% (n=23). The Probability of fi nding matched related donor from immediate and extended families was 65.4% (n=817), with 11.1% (n=91) having non-siblings related donors from extended family search. The chance of having a donor was 61% (n=491) for pediatric and 74% (n=322) for adult patients. It was 71% (n=477) for patients with malignant diseases, and 61% (n=321) for patients with non-malignant disorders. Median family size was 5(range of 1 to 14); it was 5 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) for patients with donors and 4(1-10) for patients without donors. The average number of donors was 2(range of 1-6) for all patients with donor. Conclusion: The chance of fi nding matched related family donor for HSCT in Jordan is much higher than Western countries and Asia (65% versus 25%). We expect a similar trend in other developing and Arab countries. This high probability was observed in both malignant and non-malignant (inherited) disorders; which might highlight important genetic factors in our patients with malignant disorders. Our data provided directional considerations of searching for matched donor,and may have impact on HSCT outcome. We recommend screening extended family donor prior to unrelated donor search. Also, ethnic pool in Jordan is likely homogenous, which is refl ected by favorable chance of fi nding a matched donor. This provides strong incentive to establish national and regional unrelated donor registries and cord blood banks.",

Liu, X. Huang, L. Xu, K. Liu, Y. Wang Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University (Beijing, CN) Objective: To answer whether the outcomes of related haploidentical HSCT was inferior to those of identical sibling HSCT in pediatric patients 18 years or less with high risk acute leukemia that were indicated for allogeneic hematopoieyic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: 286 patients with high risk acute leukemia between June of 2000 and December of 2010 were enrolled. The order of preference of donor selection was identical sibling donor (ISD), unrelated donor or umbilical cord blood, followed by related haploidentical donor (HID). Conditioning for ISD group was modifi ed BuCy2. ATG was used for patients with HID. Cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil and short-term methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Donors were primed with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF mobilized bone marrow (G-BM) and peripheral blood cells (G-PB) were used as graft. All patients in HID group received G-CSF from day 6 to myeloid recovery after transplant. All pediatric patients with refractory, relapsed acute leukemia and beyond CR2 were considered to receive allo-HSCT. High risk acute leukemia in CR1 or CR2 was defi ned as: poor and intermediate risk ALL, all AML except for those with good risk chromosomes. Surviving patients were followed up to 31 October, 2011. Study endpoints were leukemia-free survival (LFS), engraftment, GVHD, relapse, overall survival (OS) and transplantation related mortality (TRM). Results: Patients with less than 90% in Play-Performance Scale before HSCT had a higher risk for chronic GVHD (relative risk [RR]=4.29, P=0.00) and relapse (RR=3.83, P=0.00). Patients in CR1 or CR2 without t(9;22) or t(4;11) had lower risk for relapse (RR=0.41, P=0.01). Patients with acute GVHD 2-4 and more than 90% score in Play-Performance Scale before transplant had superior LFS (RR=2.58, P=0.01; RR=3.428, P=0.00) and OS (RR=3.37, P=0.00; RR = 3.95, P=0.00). Thirty-three patients died of transplantation related toxicities. Fifteen (45.5%) died of infections, nine (27.3%) patients died of GVHD. Four (12.1%) patients died of post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Conclusion: Comparable outcomes of unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT were showed for pediatric patients with high risk acute leukemia with those of identical sibling HSCT in terms of LFS, as well as engraftment, acute GVHD grade 3-4, relapse, TRM and overall survival.",

In conclusion, this approach was successful in achieving donor engraftment and achievement of CR in all 5 patients with high marrow blasts.

After 48 hours maturation cocktail (GM-CSF, IL-4, TNF-alpha IL-1 beta and PgE2) was added and the cells were incubated for additional maximum 24 hours. Mature Fast DCs were then transfected with hTERT mRNA and Survivin mRNA by electroporation. After over night culture in Tefl on bags with CellGro DC medium, without any cytokines added, the fast DC vaccines were frozen and stored until use. About 50% of the total cells at start of culture were recovered at the end of the production. Fast DCs had strong expression of HLA-DR, CD83, CD86 and CCR7 and weak expression of CD1a. Viability was in all cases <90%. The fast DC vaccines have been given to 13 metastatic patients with recurrences after standard therapy (pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer). So fare 10 patients have been evaluated and among them eight show antigen specifi c immunresponses against hTERT and Survivin. Immunresponses was directly related to improved clinical outcome and as will be shown several of the patients have durable remissions. We conclude that our new fast DC protocol not only is facilitating the production of DCs but also appear to give higher specifi c immunresponses that the standard 7 days produced DCs.",

In contrast to vaccinations, T cells for adoptive T-cell therapy are generated ex vivo to be re-infused into the recipient. This enables treatment of immunocompromized hosts and use of allogeneic T cells to exploit graft versus tumor effects. Adoptive T-cell therapy involving CD4+ T-helper cells (Th cells), intends to induce sustained T-cell responses in vivo. The Th1 cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has not only an effect in orchestrating cytotoxic T-cell responses, IFN-gamma by itself has antitumor effects. Transferring T cells into a lymphopenic host furthermore offers access to homeostatic cytokines and elimination of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The aim of our study was the translation of a preclinical protocols into a GMP conform clinical scale protocol to generate specifi c T cells for adoptive T-cell therapy against tumor associated antigens (TAA). Large scale generations of NY-ESO-1 or Survivin specifi c T cells was performed according to current GMP regulations in a GMP facility. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were primed with an overlapping TAA 15-mer peptide mix. The priming was done in the presence of IL-7 and IL-2. T cells were enriched using IFN-gamma capture technique and expanded for two weeks in autologous culture conditions with IL-7, IL-15 and IL-2. The T-cell products showed high specifi city, cytotoxic capacities of T cells and the Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma; and TNF-alpha. Tolerogenic cytokines like IL-10 were absent and Tregs excluded. Both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an effector memory phenotype proliferated in response to TAA. The T-cell product did not include alloreactive T cells. In summary GMP-conform generation of TAA specifi c T cells was established. Although tumor associated antigens are potential self antigens, it is possible to induce a functional Th1 response in peripheral blood T cells from healthy donors. Adoptive T-cell therapy against tumor associated antigens could have implications for multiple tumor entities in autologous as well as allogeneic treatment approaches.",

In this prospective study, the composition of 101 HSC grafts was analysed and in particular, investigated whether CD3+CD4+CD25+ FOXP3+CD127dim regulatory T-cells (Treg) (relative (%CD4) and absolute counts) were signifi cantly associated with engraftment, CMV reactivation, relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS). The median CD34, Treg, CD3, CD4 T-cell and NK cell count transplanted was 6.1x10 6 /kg (0-19.8), 4.6x10 6 /kg (0.2-20.6 ), 274x10 6 /kg (21-801), 170x10 6 /kg (12-694) and 31x10 6/ kg (2-101) respectively. Tregs represented 2.94% (0.81-8.56%) of the CD4 T-cells. Absolute Treg counts showed a strong correlation with T-cells but only a weak correlation with CD34 counts (Spearman coeffi cient 0.69 (P<0.0001) and 0.23 (P=0.02) respectively). In univariate analysis, patients transplanted with HSC grafts containing Tregs (%CD4) in the lowest quartile (<2.17% CD4 T cells) had inferior neutrophil and platelet engraftment (76.0 v 96.0% at day 40; P=0.03 and 68.0 v 85.5%; P=0.03 respectively), higher non-relapse mortality (38.6 v 16.0% at 2 years; P=0.02) and lower overall survival (41.1 v 67.8% at 2 years; P=0.007). However, Tregs were not signifi cantly associated with CMV reactivation or disease relapse. In multivariate analysis, low Tregs (%CD4) (HR=0.57 (0.35-0.94); P=0.02) and low CD34 counts (HR=0.39 (0.25-0.59); P=8.4x 10-6) were independent predictors of neutrophil engraftment. Similarly, low Tregs (%CD4) (HR=0.53 (0.32-0.89); P=0.02) and low CD34 counts (HR=0.32 (0.20-0.52); P=2.3x10-6) were independent predictors of platelet engraftment. Low Tregs (%CD4) were also independently associated with non-relapse mortality and reduced overall survival (HR=3.04 (1.15-8.04 ); P=0.03 and HR=2.58 (1.24-5.35 ); P=0.01 respectively). Other variables independently associated with NRM and reduced OS were low NK counts (HR=4.19 (1.55-11.30 ); P=0.004 and HR=3.08 (1.47-6.46) ; P=0.003 respectively) and recipient positive CMV status (HR=2.94 (1.12-7.70 ); P=0.03 and HR=2.54 (1.21-5.31 ); P=0.01.) This data supports the hypothesis that graft composition, and in particular Tregs (%CD4), may infl uence transplant outcomes (engraftment, NRM and OS) and suggests that Treg cell therapies may be a useful strategy to improve allogeneic HSCT.",

The graft is usually infused through a central venous line following bedside thawing and without further manipulation, resulting in some toxicity related to a number of product components. Washing a thawed Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) graft before infusion in a cell therapy facility involves the risk of losing progenitors and additional S306 costs, mainly because procedures are carried out manually and are time-consuming and operator-dependent. A prospective, observational trial was designed in 4 European Centers (Basel, Florence, Marseille and Murcia) to assess the reproducibility and feasibility of a fully automated, closed system for washing thawed cellular products. We report here the outcome of the pre-clinical phase. Methods: Cryopreserved PBSC Units from patients who permanently lost the indication to the transplant were used for this pre-clinical study. An ISHAGE-modifi ed fl ow cytometry method was developed to improve the assessment of CD34+ cells after thawing. Units were thawed at 37\u00b0C and split in two fractions: one was washed with the Sepax\u00ae 2 system (Biosafe, Eysins, CH), the other left in the cryopreservation medium. Clinical grade hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven\u00ae 6%, Fresenius, Germany) was validated and used as washing solution. A sample was drawn in parallel from both washed and unwashed fractions at the end of the process and thereafter at 1, 4 and 24 hours, respectively; both fractions were kept at room temperature. Cell characterization and clonogenic tests were carried out at each time-point. Data and fl ow-cytometer scatters were centralized for the analysis. Results: The washing procedures were carried out without any problem in all Centers. Recovery of viable CD34+ cells (as compared to post-thaw data) is shown in Fig 1. At all timepoints, recovery of washed CD34+ cells was higher than in the unwashed controls. A recovery above 100% after washing may be related to the downregulation of CD34 antigen by DMSO. Recovery of viable CD34+ cells was above 50% at 24hrs after the procedure, confi rming the stability of the washed product. Conclusion: Sepax\u00ae 2 is an effi cient and safe automated device to wash thawed PBSC graft. Its feasibility and reproducibility was confi rmed in an International, multicenter, research protocol. The washed product is stable and clinically usable for several hours after thawing. Background: Natural Killer (NK) cells show high cytotoxic activity against tumour cells, act as major effector population of antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), and contribute to the anti-leukemic effect in haploidentical transplantation by killing target cells, which lack MHC class I molecules, without inducing graft-versus-host-disease. The haploidentical transplantation program established at our institution1 comprises CD34-selected stem cells and an additional transfer of high numbers of CD3-/CD56+ NK cells. With a novel bioreactor system we succeeded in mass expansion of effective NK cells under GMP compliant conditions, allowing high dose and repeated treatments. Methods: NK cells were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors (n=6) by CD56+selection and CD3-depletion by magnetically labelled bead technology. Suspensions of purifi ed CD56+CD3-NK cells (Median 2x10e6 cells; CD3+ T cells <3%) were transferred into the disposable bioreactor system. After sedimentation, NK cells were cultured under continuous laminar fl ow for a median of 28 days (range 25-40) without feeder cells. Feeding rates, pH and pO2 values as well as temperature were controlled automatically by the bioreactor system. Harvested NK cells were analysed for puritiy, NK cell phenotype and natural cytotoxicity against K562 cell line (in standard calcein cytotoxicity assay). ADCC was analysed using the anti-CD20-antibody Rituximab and the CD20+ lymphoma cell line Raji. Results: CD3-/CD56+ cells expanded 250 to 400-fold. Further expansion by more than 100-fold was possible in a larger disposable bioreactor. The mean NK cell purity was >95% (range 93-100%) if the initial purity of >97% CD3-/CD56+ NK cells was achieved. Viability was >80% directly after harvest from the reactor. Expanded NK cells showed a very strong lysis (median of 42% lysis of K562 cells at E/T ratio of 10:1, range 17-55%) compared to freshly isolated NK cells (median 27%, range 15-41%). Analysis of ADCC demonstrated high lytic activity (median 57%, range 20-70%) towards otherwise resistant lymphoma cells. Conclusions: Novel GMP-compatible components allow rapid expansion and enrichment of NK cells. The availability of nearly unlimited numbers of activated NK cells with high lytic activity against various tumour targets in vitro offers new treatment options for leukemia patients receiving haploidentical transplantats by strengthening of the anti-leukemic effect of the approach.",

However, a multivariate Cox analysis for the impact of source, corrected for risk factors at SCT and DLI, did not confi rm the signifi cance of PBSCT as a risk factor for decreased OS for the patients transplanted in CP1 (HR 1.036, 95%CI 0.619-1.734).

The previously observed difference in OS was most likely caused by overlapping of PBSCT with other factors for which signifi cance was confi rmed: advanced phase at alloSCT (HR 2.26, , interval from alloSCT to relapse (HR 0.975 per month difference, 95%CI 0.958-0.993), cytogenetic (HR 3.05 at DLI, ; decreasing effect over time) or hematologic grade of relapse (HR 14.97, ; idem). Conclusions: The stem cell source does not affect the OS of CML patients who underwent PBSCT in CP1, relapsed and were treated with DLI. However, when the patients were transplanted in advanced phases, previous PBSCT seems to negatively affect OS after DLI, compared to BMT. D. Pastore, A. Mestice, P. Carluccio, T. Perrone, F.

Specchia Hematology (Bari, IT) Introduction: The therapeutic effi cacy of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for hematological malignancies relies largely on the graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect exerted by the donor CD3 cells, but an uncontrolled graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) bears a risk of complications. On the other hand, T regs cells (CD4+CD25high Foxp3+) are believed to maintain tolerance and to inhibit GvHD after alloSCT; also, the Foxp3 gene encodes a transcription factor that is a key for thymic development, so T regs cells could preserve an optimal microenviroment for the reconstitution of functional immunity after alloSCT. Patients and Methods: In this study we analyzed the graft CD3+/Tregs ratio (gCD3/Tregs R) and determined its impact on acute GVHD (aGVHD), immunological recovery and survival rates (OS and DFS) after myeloablative alloPBSCT. We analyzed 75 consecutive patients transplanted with unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA identical related donor (n=50) or an HLA identical unrelated donor (n=25); diagnoses were acute myeloid leukaemia (n=62), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=13).The median CD3+ and Tregs dose administered was 238 (range (r): 67-550) and 12,5x10 6 /Kg (r: 2-21), respectively; the median gCD3/Tregs R was 19 (r: 8-250). Patients were subdivided into a high gCD3/Tregs R (\u226536) group (n=31) and a low gCD3/Tregs R (<36) group (n=44). Results: The incidence of aGVHD (grade II-IV) in the low gCD3/ Tregs R (LR) group was lower than in the high gCD3/Tregs R (HR) group (9/44 or 20% vs 24/31 or 77%, p<.001). At multivariate logistic regression, gCD3/Tregs R was correlated both with aGVHD (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.60, 95% CI (1.35,4.90) , p=.05) and with CMV infection/disease (OR: 2.45, 95% CI (0.8,5.50), p=.05). The relapse rate at 2 years was signifi cantly affected by the number of transplanted T regs (35% vs 20% in the L and H gCD3/Tregs R group, respectively, p=.05); on the contrary, OS was not affected by gCD3/Tregs R. Conclusions: Taken together, our data may suggest that Tregs content is able to mediate protective effects against aGVHD, but a longer follow-up after alloSCT is needed to understand the real contribution of gCD3/Tregs R on survival rates.",

Iudicone (3) Background: Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are typically differentiated in vitro with interferon (IFN)-gamma and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), followed by the repeated provision of interleukin (IL)-2. We have previously shown that thymoglobulin (TG) fosters the effi cient generation of functional CIK cells, with no concomitant expansion of potentially tumorsuppressive regulatory T cells, when used in combination with interferon-gamma and IL-2 (ITG2 protocol). It is presently unknown whether the infusion of autologous immune effector cells generated with this novel protocol is feasible and safe. Methods: Five patients with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors (4 cervical carcinoma and 1 melanoma) who failed previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens were enrolled in the present phase I/II study, which was reviewed and approved by the local Ethical Committee. PBMC collected by leukapheresis from consented patients were stimulated under GMP-conditions with IFN-gamma, followed by TG and IL-2. The median time from enrollment into the study to infusion of the expanded CIK cells was 30 days. Results: The ITG2 protocol allowed the generation of clinically applicable numbers of CIK cells in all patients in the intention-to-treat analysis. The minimum target dose of 1x10 6 CD3+CD16+CD56+ CIK cells/kg of recipient's bw was obtained in all patients. After 2-3 weeks in culture, a median of 4.65x10 6 immune effectors/kg of recipient's bw were infused intravenously. One patient with advanced melanoma died from disease progression before receiving the adoptive transfer of CIK cells. In the remaining 4 patients, CIK cells were administered without any measurable toxicity. Challenge with IFNgamma, TG and IL-2 translated into a remarkable increase in the frequency of CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, whereas NK cells slightly declined in the cultures. Conversely, the frequency of both CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells did not change after in vitro culture compared with baseline, but CD19+ B cells were dramatically reduced at the end of the culture period. From a clinical standpoint, the median survival was 4.5 months (range 1-13) from the fi rst infusion of CIK cells. Discussion: This phase I/II study highlighted the feasibility and safety of the administration of CIK cells generated with the ITG2 protocol. Whether CIK cells may control disease burden in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced malignancies will be determined in larger clinical trials.",

Bethge Medical University Hospital (T\u00fcbingen, DE) Objective: Delayed engraftment and graft rejection after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can result in life-threatening complications during prolonged aplasia. The discrimination between graft failure and delayed engraftment can be challenging. Early biomarkers indicating the incipient recovery of immunocompetent cells could guide clinical decisions. Uric acid (UA) is one of the most important danger signals to the immune system. We analyzed UA serum levels of patients undergoing HCT and -as a control group -patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for leukemia to evaluate the applicability of uric acid as a sensitive biomarker for bone marrow function. Methods: Serum levels of UA, as well as differential blood counts of 50 consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic HCT were analyzed. As control, we used patients undergoing autologous HCT (n=50) and induction chemotherapy for leukemia (n=50) during a total of 202 cycles of therapy. Groups were balanced for age and sex. In the transplantation groups indications for therapy were ALL (n=7), chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=2), lymphoma (n=28), AML (n=29), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=1), myelodysplastic syndromes (n=7), myeloproliferative disease (n=3), multiple myeloma (n=12), Ewing-sarkoma (n=2), and germinal cell cancer (n=9). Results: A signifi cant decrease of UA serum levels was observed in all patients (4.7 mg/dl before vs. 1.8 mg/dl after therapy). UA levels remained low independently from allopurinol application. During allogeneic HCT, patients had a single re-increase of UA which occurred earlier (day 9.1 vs. day 11.5, p<0 .001) than the detection of fi rst leukocytes (detection limit 50/\u03bcl) and was indicative for the incipient rise of leukocytes in the following days. Patients undergoing autologous HCT had a mean of 1.4 increases which occurred concomitantly with increasing leukocytes. Patients in the leukemia group 2.8 increases of UA during aplasia which were hence not indicative for a leukocyte increase. Moreover, in patients suffering from graft failure (n=3), we observed a drop of UA 3 to 4 days before vanishing leukocytes. Conclusion: UA serum levels can serve as a more sensitive biomarker for incipient bone marrow function of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT as compared to differential blood counts. Changes in UA serum levels could guide clinical decisions towards stimulation of hematopoiesis with G-CSF or towards a second transplantation in case of graft failure.",

This is one of the areas of tissue engineering and cell therapy. There are a variety of publications and studies using a combination of PRP with collagen-containing biologically active agents. GKB #13 has the experience of PRP in the treatment of chronic nonhealing wounds of various etiologies. Given the presence of wound defects predominantly in soft tissues, PRP is used in the form of a fl at gel clot, sometimes in the form of the membrane. Also tested the application of PRP in combination with a collagen preparation \"Collost.\" To obtain PRP we used onestage centrifugation using a specialized apparatus BTI. Preparation time a bunch of time prior to blood sampling dressing for 20-30 minutes. In 2011 we used the described biologics in the treatment of 38 patients with chronic wounds: one in 24 people a topical treatment was carried out using only PRP, in 5 patients -only \"Collost\", in 9 patients used a combination of PRP with \"Collost.\" Dressings were performed using both standard and advanced interactive dressings: Tender Wet, Atrauman Ag, Hydrotul, allowing noninvasive cover the membrane from the PRP. Conclusion: The use of PRP range is wide, as if it were in the form of an independent method, in combination with other biologically active agents that action aimed at stimulation of wound S309 healing. It should be noted that all patients after treatment with PRP showed a decrease in pain sensitivity. Choice of treatment with the use of PRP is preferred in patients with chronic nonhealing wounds of various etiology and localization, particularly given the ineffectiveness of other methods of treatment. The use of PRP not only reduces the duration and cost of treatment, but also reduces the number of dressings, reduced length of stay of the patient to hospital treatment, as most patients can be observed outpatient, considering the period between dressings in 6-8 days, and also improves the quality of life for patients. The advantages of PRP using: 1. Safer to use autologous materials than allogeneic (homogeneous). 2. Severe soft tissue patronage. 3. Faster mineralization of collagen in the defect area. 4. Growth factors and cytokines fall into the wound, which is impossible, for example, by using a fi brin gel. 5. There is no risk of disease transmission when using autologous blood.",

The median number of DLI was 2 (1-5) the median interval between transplant and DLI was 8 months , the median number of infused CD3 cells /kg of recipients body weight was 2,8x10 7 (1x10 6 -11,8x10 7 ).

Setting: University Hospital Patients: Thirty seven pediatric oncology patients with febrile neutropenia and proven or suspected serious infection. Interventions: These 37 patients received a total of 51 courses of GTFs Measurements and Main Results: WBC count was assessed before and 2h and 24h post transfusion. In thirty fi ve courses of GTFs patients had leukemia and in sixteen courses of GTFs patients had solid tumors. 80.4% (n=41) of the patients were not in remission (new diagnosis, relapse, refractory to treatment). Mean duration of the fever and neutropenia was 18\u00b117days. The indications for granulocyte transfusion were bacterial infection (43%, n=22), fever of unknown origin (41.2%, n=21), fungal infection (9.8%, n=5), both bacterial and fungal infection (2%, n=1), antibiotic resistant bacteremia (2%, n=1) and prophylactic (2%, n=1). Granulocyte yield was 3,1\u00b11,2 x1010 and mean WBC count before, 2h and 24h after transfusion were 465\u00b1522 mm 3 , 4411\u00b16709 mm 3 , 3525\u00b14022 mm 3 respectively.

According to experimental animal data, to achieve clinically relevant effector to target ratios in vivo, particularly in patients with partial remission and persistent tumor burden, multiple infusions of mega doses of cytokine-activated NK cells with minimal T cell contamination are needed. Here we describe the fi rst clinical expansion of NK cells at the good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility of the Hematology Clinic, University Hospital Basel for multiple NK-DLI after haploidentical HSCT. NK cells were purifi ed from 8.9L unstimulated leukapheresis of a haploidentical stem cell donor by T cell depletion and subsequent NK cells selection using CliniMACS. Starting from 119x10e8 total nucleated cells, 4.3x10e8 NK cells were obtained with a purity of 94.9% and a residual T cell contamination of 0.63x10e6 cells corresponding to a T cell depletion effi cacy of 4.07 log. Purifi ed NK cells were expanded using our recently described protocol. Cells were cultured in airpermeable bags in up to 11.5L medium containing human serum, IL-2, IL-15, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and irradiated autologous feeder cells. After 19 days NK cell numbers increased 74-fold, i.e. 301x10e8 cells with a viability of 78%. CD3+ T cells concomitantly expanded to 43x10e6 cells. A second CliniMACS T cell depletion was performed to decrease the T cell number below the limit of 0.5x10e5 cells/ kg BW of the recipient. T cell content was reduced by 2.06 log to 0.1x10e5 cells/kg BW, however with a signifi cant NK cell loss of 21%. The NK cell product was divided and cryopreserved as 6 escalating doses ranging from 1.0x10e6 to maximally 1.0x10e8 cells/kg BW. All 6 NK-DLIs given within 30 days of haploidentical HSCT were tolerated without any acute adverse effects. These results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale expansion under GMP conditions and multiple mega dose infusions of human NK cells as immunotherapy after allogeneic HSCT for malignant disease.",

            "text": "The reactivation of CMV and EBV after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) impacts negatively on outcomes. Following allogeneic SCT approximately 20-30% of all patients reactivate EBV and 40-50% CMV, respectively. Specific antiviral therapy is only available for CMV. With the exception of Ganciclovir all drugs are being used outside their approved indication. Similarly, the use of Rituximab as B-cell depleting antibody seems to be effective in case of EBV reactivation, but bears strong side effects including long term B-cell depletion making frequent transfusion of immunoglobulins a must. Furthermore, all antiviral therapies are cost-intensive. In this study we developed a manufacturing protocol according to GMP standards that allows the generation and expansion of T-cells with specifi city for CMV and EBV out of the G-CSF mobilized stem cell graft from EBV and CMV seropositive donors. G-CSF mobilized PBMC were purifi ed using Ficoll gradient centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen for generation of T-cells after engraftment had occurred. After thawing, up to 1x109 PMBC were stimulated with 21 peptides derived from CMV and 29 peptides derived from EBV. All peptides exhibit a defi ned HLA restriction, which covers 80% of haplotypes within the central European population. After peptide stimulation cells were transferred into closed system culture bags and incubated for 9 days at 37 \u00b0 C, 5% CO 2 in GMP certifi ed media supplemented with 50IU/ml IL-2. Reactivity of PBMC for both viruses prior to peptide stimulation ranged from 0.1% to 0.7%, as tested by ELISpot; after incubation on average 15% of cells displayed reactivity against EBV and CMV, resulting in an up to 100-fold expansion. Flow cytometric analyses by pentamer staining confi rmed ELISpot results showing up to 60% specificity and an activated phenotype. Cells could be stored in liquid nitrogen and remained stable for more than 100 days by to date. In summary, this protocol exhibits several advantages: (i) Donor safety: the stem cell graft can be used as a source for PBMC, no second apheresis is required. (ii) Timing: PBMC as raw material can be stored stably until generation of T-cells is desired. (iii) The manufacturing process makes use of standard clean room equipment. (iv) The protocol can be easily adapted to local requirements and preferences. (v) Costs for production would be competitively low compared to current prices for antiviral therapies and associated complications. A. Casini, M. Andres, S. Gerull, S. Masouridi, B. Mohty, C.

We report a retrospective analysis on the impact of T-cell depletion (TDEP) in prophylaxis of GvHD on the outcome of HSCT in MF. Methods: Between 06.1997 and 05.2011 35 patients (24 M/11 F) with a median age of 55 years (range 25-69) underwent HSCT from an identical sibling donor (51%), a MUD or MMUD (43%) or an alternative donor (6%). At transplant most patients had an intermediate-2 DIPPS, 31% had a prior splenectomy and 40% had a JAK2V617F mutation. 18 patients received a RIC regimen mostly fl udarabine-based while 17 patients received a myeloablative regimen with BU-CY (71%) or CY-TBI\u00b1VP16. Ex vivo TDEP (Campath in the bag) was used in 11 patients, in vivo TDEP (ATG) in 13 and no TDEP in 11. GvHD prophylaxis included CSA \u00b1 MTX or MMF. Results: Thirty-two patients engrafted. Two patients in the in vitro TDEP group did not engraft and died from infection. Seven patients died from relapse and 5 from non-relapse mortality (NRM). A total of 21 (60%) patients developed acute GvHD grades I-IV (grades II-IV in 28%). There was signifi cantly less acute GvHD after in vitro TDEP (p=0.01) (due to decreased acute GVHD grade I in this group). Chronic GvHD developed in 21 patients, without statistical difference according to the TDEP status. 7 of the 13 patients who relapsed were in the in vitro TDEP group. 3 were successfully treated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and 3 additional patients receiving DLI because of mixed chimerism achieved a long term remission. Hematological remission and histological response was achieved in 80% of patients. There was no difference in full donor chimerism incidence or in the time to engraftment between the TDEP groups. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range 3-420), 3-years overall survival (OS) and current disease-free survival (cDFS) were both 68% (95% CI 52-84%), 3-years NRM was 20% (95% CI 4-36%) and relapse incidence was 25% (95% CI 7-43%). OS did not differ according to TDEP (p=0.30), stem cells source (p=0.40), type of conditioning (p=0.99), JAK2 mutation (p=0.47) or prior splenectomy (p=0.57); there was a tendency of lower incidence of relapse in the in vivo TDEP group (p=0.05). Conclusion: A signifi cant proportion of patients with MF achieved long-term survival after HSCT. In vitro TDEP was associated with increased incidence of relapse. DLI was an effective salvage therapy for many of those patients.",

Chalandon University Hospital of Geneva (Geneva, CH) Objective: We investigated whether the EBMT risk score, which is broadly predictive of the outcome after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is also valid in our center, where 73% of patients are transplanted with T-cell depleted grafts (TDEP). Methods: We analyzed 513 patients with various hematological diseases transplanted between 1984 and February 2011 with grafts from identical siblings (312, 61%), MUD (121, 25%), MMUD (21, 4%) or alternative donors (59, 12%). The median follow up for alive patients was 7 yrs (range 0.5-27 yrs). The median age of patients (368 M, 145 F) was 38 years (range 1-70). TDEP was with CAMPATH (1M,1G or 1H).Stem cell source was bone marrow (35%), peripheral blood stem cells (64%) or cord blood (1%). Ninety-one patients received a fl udarabine based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen and 422 patients a myeloablative regimen (MAC) with BU-CY (17%) or CY-TBI\u00b1VP16 (83%).GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA\u00b1MTX or MMF. Results: OS at 5 years was 51\u00b14%, the incidence of relapse, relapse death or transplant-related mortality (TRM) were 42\u00b15%, 26\u00b14% and 26\u00b14% respectively. OS at 5 years of patients with risk score 0/1 was 79\u00b111% and 44\u00b124% for patients with risk score 6/7 (p<0.0001). Patients with a higher EBMT risk score had a higher incidence of relapse and relapse death (p<0.0001) and more TRM (38\u00b126 vs 14\u00b110%), but this was not statistically signifi cant (p=0.14). Patients receiving RIC, who had higher risk scores than patients after MAC (p<0.0001) had a higher rate of relapse (52\u00b112% vs 33\u00b15%, p<0.0001) and relapse death (45\u00b112% vs 24\u00b15%, p<0.0001) and a lower OS (43\u00b111 vs 58\u00b15% p=0.044), but, the EBMT score on OS, TRM, relapse and relapse death of patients after MAC or RIC was similar. The EBMT score affected OS, relapse rate and relapse death in recipients of T cell depleted/replete grafts comparably but had only a marginal impact (p=0.042) on TRM in patients after TDEP and no impact in patients receiving unmanipulated grafts. Conclusion: Our study confi rms the prognostic value of the EBMT risk score on OS and relapse rates. By contrast, we only found a marginal impact on TRM. Hence, the EBMT risk score represents a simple and reliable tool for systematic and standardized pretransplant risk assessment. Nevertheless, risk assessment for an individual patient remains complex, while outcome depends not only on the pretransplant parameters of the EBMT score but also on many peritransplant and posttransplant factors.",

Martino's Hospital (Genoa, IT) Background: The use of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) from HLA mismatched donors, is associated with a high risk of acute GvHD. In the Perugia studies the threshold is set at 10 3 CD3/ kg. In one study (Huang X, BBMT 2009) a median T-cell dose of 2.4x10 8 /kg (from mobilized PBSC) was administered to recipients of haploidentical stem cell transplantation : the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD exceeded 50%. Aim of the Study: We tested the feasibility and occurrence of GVHD following 12 haploidentical DLI in seven patients, who relapsed after unmanipulated haploidentical T-cell replete BMT, without additional immunosuppression. Patients and Methods: All patients were transplanted from haploidentical related donor after myeloablative conditioning (n=3) or non myeloablative conditioning (n=4), and received high-dose of CY post-transplant as GVHD prophylaxis, in association with cyclosporin and micophenolate. The diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=3), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=2), acute myeloid leukemia (n=1), chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (n=1). The median time of relapse was 200 days from BMT (range 45-350 days). DLI were collected by apheresis from the haploidentical donor. The median time of fi rst infusion was 72 days from relapse (range 28-342 days) and 235 days from BMT (range 119-519). At time of fi rst DLI all patients were off GVHD prophylaxis. The minimum dose of CD3+ cells was 1x10 3 /kg; two patients received two DLIs, with dose escalation of half log in the second administration, another patient received four DLIs, at the dose of 1x10 5 /kg and 1x10 6 /kg respectively. In all cases DLI were given after a course of chemotherapy. Median time of DLI was 12 days from chemotherapy (range 10-14 days). Chimerism was 100% donor in all patients at time of fi rst DLI. Results: The infusions were well tolerated and no major adverse effect were observed. No patient developed GVHD; no aplasia related to DLI occurred. Two patients died with progressive disease; fi ve patients are alive, three of them are disease-free. The median follow-up from the last DLI was 125 days (range 40-342 days). Conclusions: These data suggest that HLA haploidentical DLI can be administrated at doses ranging from 1x10 3 /kg to 1x10 6 /kg. Further exploration of this therapeutic approach seems warranted.",

            "text": "Objectives: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are increasingly being considered as tools to induce tolerance post-transplantation, with recent clinical trials of adult Tregs and Tregs lines from cord blood (CB) being performed. Since only expanded cord Treg lines have currently been used in this context, we focused, in a pre-clinical study, on ascertaining if minimally manipulated CB Tregs can be a source for therapy; comparing the conditions that allow for suppression by both CB or adult Tregs. Methods: The function of freshly isolated cord Tregs (using the CD25 CliniMACS reagent; Milteni Biotec), to polyclonal stimuli (1\u03bcg/ml soluble anti-CD3 and 2\u03bcg/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibodies) were assessed and compared with an equivalent population of adult Tregs, to determine if there are conditional requirements for full cord Treg functionality ex-vivo. Results: CB effector cell (CD4+CD25-; Teff) responses to anti-CD3/28 were weak compared to adult cells and, unlike adult, with no maximal response observed in a cell dose response curve from combined data. Under these conditions, only adult Tregs demonstrated consistent suppression. However, in the presence of exogenous IL2 (800 IU/ml), CB Tregs achieved a cell dose response curve similar to that seen with adult and demonstrated suppression (6 CB, 4 adult). With both adult and CB, it was found that an optimal Teff cell dose/response existed at which Tregs demonstrated the highest levels of inhibition (at a fi xed Teff:Treg ratio of 3:1). At these optimal conditions (1x10 5 Teff, 800 IU/ml IL-2 and anti-CD3/28) suppression of adult Teff by CB Tregs and CB Teff by adult Tregs was similarly observed. Conclusion: These data indicate that the effector dose/response is an important factor in determining suppression. Moreover, when assessing suppression to a particular stimulus (especially alloreactivity and antigen responses), the response of the target cells needs to be considered. In optimal conditions cord Tregs can be functional against cord and adult Teff and if target cell responses are strong then cord Tregs should be functional without extensive manipulation making these cells attractive for therapy. Zouwen, A.B. Kruisselbrink, J.H.F. Falkenburg, I. Jedema Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, NL) Donor T cells directed against hematopoiesis-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) are assumed to give rise to a specifi c graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect without graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, It has been observed that overt GvL responses, associated with occurrence of T-cells directed against hematopoiesis-restricted MiHA can coincide with limited GvHD. To analyze whether T cells mediating a specifi c GvL response may under certain conditions induce damage to surrounding non-hematopoietic tissues, we stimulated MiHAspecifi c T cells with MiHA-positive hematopoietic targets on a monolayer of MiHA-negative primary human fi broblasts seeded in the same well. We demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 MiHA-specifi c T cells activated by MiHA-positive hematopoietic stimulator cells (EBV-LCL/DCs), induced 60-100% bystander cytotoxicity to the surrounding fi broblasts at a 5/1 T-cell/fi broblast-ratio. T-cell activation by the hematopoietic cells was pivotal for the induction of this collateral damage. We demonstrated that increased strength of T-cell activation correlated with increased severity of collateral damage. Using T-cell activation in a cell free (PHA or antiCD3/CD28 beads), we illustrated that the MiHA-negative fi broblasts are not attacked due to cross-presentation of HLA/peptide complexes from apoptotic hematopoietic cells. Next, we investigated the prerequisites for collateral damage induction to occur. Using a transwell system, we demonstrated that direct T-cell-fi broblast interaction was required. By inhibition of the death receptor-, mitochondrial-, or granzyme-B (GzB)-mediated apoptosis induction pathways via retroviral transduction of the anti-apoptotic proteins c-FLIP, Bcl-2 or PI-9 in fi broblasts and inhibition of T cell degranulation with EGTA, we demonstrated that the main effector mechanism underlying collateral damage is release of GzB-and perforincontaining granules by T-cells upon activation. Misdirection of release of cytotoxic granules towards the MiHA-negative nonhematopoietic targets may underlie the induction of collateral damage. In conclusion, these data suggest that hematopoiesisrestricted T-cells actively participating in an overt GvL response can induce GvHD by inducing collateral damage to MiHA-negative non-hematopoietic targets via misdirection of their cytotoxic execution machinery when they are in close proximity of the non-hematopoietic tissues.",

We have reported that adoptive transfer of allogeneic CIK cells in a murine model caused minimal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with retention of antitumor activity mediated by NKG2D, which is an activating receptor expressed on NK cells. The mechanism of suppression of GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is, in part, due to the abundant production of IFN-gamma from the CIK cells, which has protective effect against GVHD. We have also demonstrated that allogeneic CIK cells displayed a signifi cant lower acquisition of homing molecules, required for the entry of infl amed and GVHD target organs and a higher susceptibility to apoptosis compared to allogeneic splenocytes. There also might be some causes other than we mentioned above. Host residual dendritic cells (DCs) have a crucial role for initiating GVHD reaction, because they present recipient alloantigens to donor T cells, which fi nally attack on recipient tissues. Murine alloreactive NK cells, even when infused in large numbers, do not cause GVHD in the mouse by killing recipient DCs. Similarly, it remains a possibility that the reduced GVHD in CIK cells receiving mice was due to the elimination of residual host DCs by CIK cells. To test this, DCs generated from bone marrow cells were used for 51-Cr release cytotoxicity assays as target cells. Although autologous CIK cells (Balb/c) had relatively strong killing activity against DCs (Balb/c), allogeneic CIK cells (B6) had much more killing activity even from at a 5:1 effector -target ratio. Allogeneic CD8 positive cells did not show any killing activity against DCs. In addition, killing activity against DCs did not changed with/ without adding NKG2D blocking antibody, suggesting that other mechanisms to undergo cell lysis should exist in CIK cells in addition to NKG2D/NKG2D ligand system. To further evaluate whether allogeneic CIK cells kill host DCs in vivo, lethally irradiated Balb/c recipients were given BM (B6) with CIK cells or splenocytes to compare the percent of residual host-typed DCs in the spleen fi ve days after bone marrow transplantation. Percent of host-typed DCs tended to be lower in the mice receiving alllogeneic CIK cells compared with those receiving fresh splenocytes or BM alone. In conclusion, allogeneic CIK cells caused less GVHD due in part to elimination of host DCs. (1) S315 depleted from the stem cell graft to reduce the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Donor T-cells are re-administered later as donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to preserve graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) reactivity. Various studies have demonstrated that not only T-cells, but also antibodies are induced after alloSCT. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether antibodies can be used to follow clinical responses after treatment with alloSCT and DLI. Methods: We developed a Luminex bead assay to measure antibodies against multiple antigens encoded by the Y-chromosome (H-Y antigens) and their respective X-variants in small sample volumes. RPS4Y, ZFY and DBY and their X-variants were produced as overlapping protein fragments in E Coli. The protein fragments were coupled on Luminex beads, and 400 serum/plasma samples from 43 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia collected before and during treatment with alloSCT and DLI were screened for antibody binding to the antigencoupled beads. Results: Antibodies against H-Y were measured in 3/16 female and 9/27 male patients. ZFY was most frequently targeted (9x), but (simultaneous) antibodies against DBY (5x) and RPS4Y (6x) were also found. Antibodies against H-Y were most frequently observed in female-to-male (6/9) as compared to maleto-male (3/18), male-to-female (2/10) and female-to-female (1/6) transplantations, and were often induced after alloSCT or DLI. Notably, all male patients transplanted with female donors with treatment-induced antibodies against H-Y had also detectable antibodies against X-variants. Conclusions: Antibodies against multiple protein targets can be successfully measured in small sample volumes by a Luminex bead assay. Strong humoral responses against H-Y were measured most frequently in male patients transplanted with female donors after DLI. Our data therefore show that antibodies can be used to follow clinical responses after alloSCT and DLI. The data also suggest that antibodies against ubiquitously expressed intracellular H-Y antigens develop as a result of cellular debris induced by treatment with alloSCT and DLI, and that these antibodies often display cross-reactivity towards X-encoded homologues.

Herr University Medical Centre Mainz (Mainz, DE) The graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is mainly mediated by T cells of donor origin that recognize HLA-associated antigens on patient-derived leukaemia cells. Previous research has mainly focused on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes representing a major part of GvL effector cells. However, CD4+ T cells, commonly regarded as helper cells of the adaptive immune system, are also capable of executing direct cytolytic activity. This as well as the virtual absence of HLA class II expression on non-haematopoietic cells under non-infl ammatory conditions makes CD4+ T cells also attractive mediators of the GvL response. Here we sorted phenotypically naive CD4+ T cells from healthy donor PBMC by immunomagnetic or fl ow cytometry means and stimulated them against primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts matched for HLA-DR and -DQ but not -DP alleles, refl ecting the common clinical situation. AML-reactive CD4+ T-cell populations were analysed for cytokine secretion, HLA restriction, and T cell receptor V-beta chain usage. Their ability to lyse target cells was measured in 5h chromiumrelease assays. In 3 extensively studied donor/patient models, leukaemia-reactive CD4+ T-cell clones could be expanded that were mainly restricted by HLA-DP alleles according to antibody blocking experiments. T cells showed functional properties of Th1 type cells, producing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, but not IL-4 upon AML stimulation. They lysed primary AML blasts as well as patient-derived EBV-B cells at moderate to strong levels (i.e. up to 100% at effector/target ratio of 60/1). Moreover, CD4+ T cell clones cross-reacted with AML blasts derived from other patients expressing the same single HLA-DP mismatch allele as patient cells used for initial stimulation, suggesting that these T cells are directed against disparate HLA-DP alleles. In summary, we demonstrate herein that AML-reactive CD4+ T cells can be reliably isolated and expanded from naive precursors of HLA-DR and -DQ matched healthy donors. Most of them appear to recognize HLA-DP mismatch alleles, indicating a potentially important role of these alleles as targets of the GvL response.",

Ammer Haematology & Clinical Oncology (Regensburg, DE) In Graft-versus-Host Disease(GvHD) T cell activation leads to a cytokine storm involving IFNgamma(IFNg) and TNFalpha. Although IFNg is a typical infl ammatory cytokine, it is also discussed to have immunomodulatory effects by induction of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase(IDO) the intracellular enzyme converting tryptophan(Trp) to kynurenine catabolites. Kynurenines(Kyn) exert immunosuppressive functions by suppression of effector T cells and generation of regulatory T cells. To address the question whether IFNg treatment can infl uence GvHD via induction of IDO and its metabolites we used a human in vitro model of skin GvHD-the skin explant assay (SE). In brief, fi rst a mismatched(mm) MLR was set up for 7 days with responder cells of the donor and irradiated patient cells. After further three days of co-culture of recipient skin and MLR the skin explants were histopathologically graded according to Lerner. In different set-ups MLR or skin were incubated with different concentrations of IFNg. Induction of IDO was assessed by measurement of Kyn in tissue culture supernatants by tandem-mass spectrometry. Kyn concentrations were correlated with GvHD stage. To check the endogenous contribution of IDO we incubated the SE with the IDO-inhibitor 1-methyl-Ltryptophan (1-MT). In SE we observed similar values of Trp and Kyn catabolites for medium and MLR control.IFNg increased Kyn, anthranilic acid and 3-OH-anthranilic acid in a concentration dependent way in MLR alone, skin alone and the SE. 1-MT resulted in inhibition of Kyn synthesis in MLR and SE only in the presence of IFNg. Pre-incubation of the skin with IFNg for different intervals before adding the MLR had no effect on Kyn production. There was neither improvement nor deterioration of the histopathological GvHD grading during IFNg treatment but damage in the mm MLR control was already at highest level. Our experiments show that IFNg leads to in vitro induction of IDO both in activated peripheral blood cells as well as in cutaneous cells during alloreaction. The failure to improve histopathological GvHD grading and the lack of 1-MT activity in the absence of IFNg suggest a minor role of IDO in the baseline alloreaction at least in the model of the mm skin explant assay. Further experiments including qRT-PCR for IDO are planned to clarify the exact contribution of the IDO pathway. Our data may contribute to explain why clinical use of IFNg fails to exacerbate GvHD and provide additional insights in its immunomodulatory mechanisms.",

Czerw, T. Kruzel, M. Sadus-Wojciechowska, J. Najda, J. Holowiecki, S. Giebel Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial, Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology (Gliwice, PL) Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, including fi lgrastim are widely used to support neutrophil recovery after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (autoPBSCT). In recent years biosimilars of originally developed fi lgrastim became available and are postulated to provide the same safety and effi cacy profi le. The goal of the current study was to compare for the fi rst time Neupogen (Amgen, original formulation) with Zarzio (Sandoz, biosimilar) in a setting of autoPBSCT. 35 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma (MM) were treated with Neupogen between 04.2010-05.2011 while 55 patients received Zarzio between 06.2011-11.2011. Filgrastim 5 ug/kg was administered since day +7 until neutrophil recovery >0.5 x10e9/L for two consecutive days. Median age was 59 (47-66) years in the Neupogen group and 57 (47-69) years in the Zarzio group. The proportion of fi rst and second of the planned tandem transplantations was 29(83%)/6(17%) for Neupogen and 31(56%)/24(44%) for Zarzio. The number of transplanted CD34+ cells was signifi cantly higher in the Zarzio compared to Neupogen group (6.7\u00b13 x10e6/kg vs. 3.9 \u00b13 x10e6/kg, respectively). Patients were administered a uniform anti-infectious prophylaxis consisting of ciprofl oxacin and fl uconasole. Median time to WBC >1.0x10e9/L and neutriphil >0.5x10e9/L recovery was 12 days regardless the fi lgrastim formulation used (see : Table) . However, there was a trend to faster platelet >50x10e9/L recovery and less need for platelet transfusions in the Zarzio group. The use of red blood cell transfusions did not differ for two study cohorts. Patients receiving Zarzio were discharged from the hospital one day earlier compared to those receiving Neupogen (p=0.03). There was a tendency to fewer grade 3 or 4 infectious complications in the Zarzio compared to Neupogen group (16% vs. 31%, p=0.09) and signifi cantly less neutropenic fever (7% vs. 20%, p=0.03). No severe injectionrelated complications were observed. No transplantation related mortality was noted.",

Dmoszynska Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Objectives: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to accelerate haematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Approval of biosimilar G-CSF in Europe has been on the basis of comparable effi cacy, safety and quality as the originator product. However, data are not presently available in all clinical settings. This is the fi rst reported use of a biosimilar G-CSF for neutrophil recovery after BMT. Methods: A total of 23 consecutive patients (12 male, 11 female; mean\u00b1SD age 47\u00b113 years) with haematological malignancy (multiple myeloma, n=12; Hodgkin's lymphoma, n=6; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, n=4; acute myeloid leukaemia, n=1) were recruited at a single-centre. Nineteen patients were receiving their fi rst BMT while it was the second autograft for 4 patients. Mobilisation chemotherapy consisted of high-dose (HD) VEP (n=14), ESHAP (n=4), HD Ara-C (n=3), HD cyclophosphamide (n=2) or ICE (n=1).

Gimona (1) Despite recent advances in the application of non-hematopoietic stem cells for novel regenerative therapies our understanding of the basic cellular mechanisms involved in therapeutic neovascularization remains incomplete. We have used coimplantation of autologous human mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) and endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) in NSG mice to study formation of patent pericyte-lined and perfused vessels in vivo. Matrigel plugs containing either MSPCs, ECFCs, a 20/80 mixture of MSPC and ECFCs, or Matrigel alone, were harvested after 24h to identify potential early invivo signaling events by antibody microarray analysis. Potential regulatory targets were selected by in-silico interactome analysis and validated in vitro at the cellular level. Expression of the discoidin domain-containing membrane tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (DDR2) in MSPCs was downregulated 2.4 fold in the 20/80 mixture compared to MSPC-only implants. DDR2 has been shown to interact with collagen to sense and modulate matrix stiffness, and to regulate cell migration. Immunofl uorescence microscopy revealed components of the mechanotransduction machinery (Paxillin, ILK, p416-Src kinase, cortactin) and pericyte-specifi c markers (e.g. h1CaP) in MSPCs. Additionally, MSPCs responded to alterations in mechanotransduction elicited by pharmacological manipulation of cytoskeletal integrity with phorbol dibutyrate and the RhoKinase inhibitor Y-27632. We further detected accumulation of DDR2 at the periphery of migrating MSPCs in 2D culture. We also probed MSPC extracts for mRNA and miRNA content in response to different matrix conditions including collagen, Matrigel and human platelet lysate gels. Employing both 2D and 3D culture strategies we identifi ed changes in the levels of DDR2 mRNA and the regulatory miRNAs (29b, 199a, 331) in response to collagen compared to human platelet lysate, together with signifi cant alterations in cell morphology. Taken together our data point towards a mechanosensitive regulation of MSPC function. Direct or indirect (via miRNA) regulation of the collagen receptor DDR2 could have a central role in modulating MSPC function during stem-cell induced neo-vascularization in vivo. In consequence, a collagen-free 3D carrier may be superior in supporting the pericyte-like proangiogenic capacity of MSPCs.",

Villaron, M. Lopez-Parra, A. Benito, S. Muntion, L. Lopez-Anglada, L. Lopez-Corral, M. Diez-Campelo, L. Vazquez, J.F. San Miguel, D. Caballero, M.C. del Ca\u00f1izo Hospital Universitario de Salamanca (Salamanca, ES) Introduction: Peripheral cytopenias are a severe complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), often in the context of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Standard treatment includes steroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), but some cases are resistant. We have recently published the fi rst experience with the use of MSC (Sanchez-Guijo FM et al. Transfusion 2011 epub 24 Oct) in four cases. In the current work we report our experience with 10 patients treated by a compassionate use program with third party allogeneic MSC, including two pediatric patients. A standardized infusion protocol was recorded in each intravenous infusion to specifi cally assess safety and adverse events. Premedication with paracetamol and dexchlorpheniramine was given to each patient prior to MSC administration. Methods: MSC were expanded from 100 mL of bone marrow from third-party donors (different to that of the allo-SCT) obtained under standard conditions in the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Cell Production Unit at the Hospital Universitario de Salamanca. Quality control of the administered cellular product was performed by immunophenotypic analysis by fl ow cytometry, in vitro differentiation assays to show multilineage differentiation and karyotyping. Results: Eight adult (mean age: 42.5 years-old, range: 23-61 years) and two pediatric (19 and 34 months-old) patients were treated with MSC for refractory cytopenias after allo-SCT. Reason for MSC therapy were thrombocytopenia (n:5), anemia (n:2), pancytopenia (n:2) and neutropenia (n:1). Total number of doses of MSC administered was 43. Median number of doses per patient was 4 (range: 1-12) and median number of MSC per dose per patient was 1.01x10e6 MSC (range: 0.85-1.45x10e6) in the adult population whereas it was notably higher in the two pediatric patients (4.56x10e6 MSC/dose/patient). No complications nor adverse events recorded regarding cell administration for any of the reported patients in the 43 doses administered were observed. Regarding responses, seven out of ten patients achieved a complete response with full recovery of normal peripheral blood counts. Median follow up is 10 months. One patient did not respond, one patient had a partial response, and the remaining one achieved a complete response and relapsed after 10 months of the last MSC dose. Conclusion: MSC from a third-party donor is a safe and potentially useful therapeutic approach for patients with refractory cytopenias after allo-SCT. Objective: Beh\u00e7et disease (BD) is a chronic vasculitis of autoimmune origin. A T-lymphocytes helper type-1(Th1) response is documented in affected patients (pts) together with CD56+ NK cells increase. The treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT) for patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy. As recurrent vasculitis is the hallmark of the disease, organ damage can occur in severely affected pts, thus precluding SCT. MSC have been successfully used to treat autoimmune disorders. Early in vivo results hint at the ability of MSC to skew a Th1 towards a Th2 response, and to increase CD4+CD25+CD127dim/neg regulatory T cells, thus possibly acting as immunosuppressant. Methods: After signing written informed consent a 19-year old patient affected with severe, resistant BC received 3rd-party bone marrow-derived MSCs. The patient exhibited BC with ocular, neurological, lung, skin and bowel involvement, and renal impairment precluded her to receive SCT. At the time of MSC infusion she was treated with steroids, azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporine. Combined analgesic treatment was needed to control chronic pain. The clinical activity of the disease was assessed with the BD Current Activity Form 2006 (BDCAF). She received 2 i.v. infusions of 10 6 MSCs/kg body-weight on day 1 and +30 after the fi rst clinical assessment. BDCAF was administered monthly till day +30 after MSC infusion. Immunosuppressive and analgesic treatments were recorded at the same time points. Blood samples were collected weekly to analyze the patient\u00b4s lymphocyte and cytokines subsets. Results: MSCs where infused with no side-effects. No symptomatic benefi t was observed after the treatment as documented in the BDCAF. Immunosuppressant and analgesic treatment could not be tapered after MSC infusion. Immunological monitoring of leukocytes subsets did not show any major change into the lymphocyte subpopulations, not even in the T helper/T regulatory ratio, the cytokine pattern showed reduction in IL-8, IL-6 and IL12p70 values whereas IL-17, IL-10, IL-5 and TNFalpha remained unaltered. Conclusions: Though clinical feasible and scientifi cally reasonable, allogeneic MSC infusion in a patient with severe resistant BD did not prove to be of any benefi t. Reasons for treatment failure could imply possible MSC rejection or a chronic phase of a long-lasting disease, where acute infl ammation plays no longer a major role in the infl ammation process. Objective: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are used in clinical trials to treat graft versus host disease (GvHD) after stem cell transplantation (SCT). In vitro studies demonstrated MSC broad immunosuppressive activity, documenting interactions with B and T-lymphocytes as well as dendritic cells. As infections represent a major risk after SCT, it is important to comprehend any possible infl uence of MSC in this context. Method: We analyzed the clinical course of 11 patients (pts) receiving MSC for GvHD in our Unit between 2009 and 2011. We recorded viral reactivations as measured in whole blood with polymerase chain reaction for 100 days following MSC administration. In pts who had documented viral reactivations in the fi rst 3 days following MSCs infusion the frequency of virusspecifi c IFN gamma-producing cells was determined through enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Infectious events (viral, bacterial and fungal) requiring cardio-pulmonary support in the 100 days after MSC infusion were also analyzed. Results: 8 pts presented with viral reactivations after MSC administration, 7 of them while receiving other immunosuppressive treatment. All of them received preemptive treatment according to institutional policy and none developed viral dissemination or overt disease with regard to Epstein Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus or Adenovirus. Two pts developed viral reactivation the day after MSC infusion. One of them was cytopenic and therefore virus specifi c IFN gamma-producing cells could not be tested. The 2nd patient showed an increase in CMV-specifi c T cells after in vitro stimulation with viral antigens. One patient experienced a lung infection requiring oxygen administration during the observation time span. The cause of the lung infection was syncitial respiratory virus and the infant recovered in 2 weeks time without further problems. Conclusion: In our cohort of patients viral reactivation after MSC infusion occurred in 72% of the cases, comparably to other reports dealing with pts affected by resistant GvHD. No patient presented severe form of infection. As all of them were receiving immunosuppression, it is very unlikely to draw fi rm conclusions about the role of MSC in triggering these events. A single case could be checked for immunological response to viral stimulus and demonstrated virus specifi c T-cytotoxic lymphocyte activity.",

Acquafredda (1) Human in vitro expanded multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have recently gained wide interest in view of their clinical use in several cell therapy approaches. However, in vitro cell expansion, which selects for rapidly dividing cells, may increase the risk of spontaneous malignant transformation. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that extends telomere length by adding TTAGGG repeats to the telomeric ends of chromosomes and plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Telomerase activity is silent in the vast majority of adult human cells; an increase in telomerase activity permits the maintenance or lengthening of telomeres, rendering cells immortal and permitting cancer progression. Even though no critical side effects, including tumour formation, have been described in patients receiving MSCs in clinical trials, the use of MSCs for clinical approaches requires that the bio-safety of these cells be carefully investigated by appropriate and sensitive tests. The aim of this study was to investigate susceptibility to transformation of human bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs, by measuring the expression of telomerase activity. We analyzed 14 MSC lots at early (P2-P4) and late (P10-P12) passages, all obtained from healthy donors. Results were compared with those obtained in 4 samples of leukaemia blasts from patients at disease diagnosis and in 1 sample of sarcoma cells, as recent evidence suggests that sarcomas arise through aberrant differentiation of MSCs. Telomerase activity was assessed by a quantitative real time PCR-based telomeric repeat amplifi cation protocol (TRAP); results were expressed as attomole of telomerase repeat sequences in 1 \u03bcg protein (attomol/\u03bcg protein). All MSC samples showed very low levels of telomerase activity both at early-(Mean: 2.6 -4 attomol/\u03bcg protein, SD:\u00b10.87 -4 ) and late passages (Mean: 0.56 -4 attomol/\u03bcg protein, SD:\u00b13.34 -4 ). As expected, telomerase activity in leukaemia blasts was higher than in MSC samples (Mean: 0.84 -1 attomol/\u03bcg protein, SD:\u00b1 0.31 -1 ) while in sarcoma cells the level was intermediate (0.99 -2 ) . These results suggest that human in vitro expanded BM-derived MSCs show very low levels of telomerase activity at early passages and maintain the same levels of telomerase activity also after long term in vitro culture, suggesting that these cells do not display susceptibility to malignant transformation.",

MSPC expansion is the prerequisite for dose fi nding studies as well as for most applications in adult patients. A major safety concern for MSPC expansion is the risk of malignant transformation or premature senescence hampering MSPC function. We have previously shown that long-term expanded MSPCs acquired senescence-related gene expression changes independent of culture conditions (Haematologica 2010). It has been hypothesized that elevated oxygen (20% air O2) contributes to genomic instability and malignant transformation in vitro. We therefore analyzed the infl uence of different oxygen conditions during long-term expansion on MSPC behavior including osteogenic differentiation. A gene panel previously defi ned as senescence markers was tested for differential expression after varying culture conditions. Bone marrow-derived MSPCs were expanded in alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% human platelet lysate replacing fetal bovine serum under physiologic conditions (5% O 2 ) or air oxygen (20% O 2 ) until spontaneous cessation of proliferation. Osteogenic induction was analyzed by Alizarin red. RNA was isolated from corresponding early and late passages and analyzed by qRT-PCR for p16ink4a, PARG1, CDKN2B, PTN and MCM6. In total, MSPCs could be cultured for 5 passages at 30 cells/ cm 2 and for 10 passages at 3,000 cells/cm 2 for up to 85 days resulting in more cumulative population doublings (PDs) of MSPCs at air O 2 compared to 5% O 2 and in cultures with low compared to standard seeding density. Long-term cultured MSPCs after 40 PDs (air O 2 ) and 35 PDs (5% O 2 ) retained their osteogenic differentiation capacity. Compared to early passages, RT-PCR in late passages revealed an up-regulation of p16ink4a, PARG1 and CDKN2B without specifi c infl uence of culture conditions. PTN and MCM6 were signifi cantly downregulated, mainly in air O 2 cultures with high seeding density correlating with diminished cell proliferation compared to low density cultures. There was no evidence of immortalization or malignant transformation. MSPC large-scale and long-term propagation under animal serum-free conditions at air oxygen in low seeding density was most effi cient and safe.",

Shipounova, N.V. Sats, A.E. Bigildeev, E.N. Parovichnikova, N.J. Drize, V.G. Savchenko National Hematological Research Center (Moscow, RU) The alterations in stromal precursor cells in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) are obscure. The aim of the study was to investigate the dynamics of colony forming unit fi broblasts (CFU-F) and proliferative potential of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSC) in patients during one year after alloHSCT. AlloHSCT was performed to 12 patients (6 male and 6 female): 3 patients with CML, 5 with AML, 3 with ALL and 1 with B-CLL. Conditioning was myeloblative in 8 patients and reduced intensity in 4. After informed consent bone marrow was aspirated before conditioning, and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180-240 and 360 days after transplantation. CFU-F was counted in 14 days. MMSC were cultured in alfaMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cumulative MMSC production was counted after 5 passages. In 30 days after alloHSCT concentration of CFU-F in bone marrow of patients decreased more than 4 fold (29.6\u00b17.9 per 106 bone marrow cells before alloHSCT and 7.2\u00b13.1-30 days after). Further it gradually increased and one year after alloHSCT mount to 75% (22.4\u00b114.8) of value before transplantation. No differences were revealed between patients received myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimen. The growth parameters of patients and donors MMSC are signifi cantly different. Even before alloHSCT average time to passage is 1.5 fold longer in patients' MMSC (9.0\u00b10.8 days) than in donors' ones (6.6\u00b10.4). In 30 days after alloHSCT average time to passage increased 3 fold in comparison with donors (20.6\u00b15.0), than it gradually decreased remaining longer than before alloHSCT up to one year. Before transplantation cumulative cell production of MMSC is more than ten times lower than in donors' MMSC. In 30 days after alloHSCT cumulative cell production decreased 1000 fold, and only in one year it attends basic level. The results demonstrate that stromal precursor cells -MMSC and CFU-F are altered in patients after alloHSCT. MMSC from patients have reduced proliferative potential in comparison with MMSC from donors which does not restored even in one year after alloHSCT. So the data suggest that stromal cells are violently damaged by alloHSCT procedure and do not regenerate completely even in one year. The status of hematopoietic microenvironment could infl uence the hematopoiesis in patients after alloHSCT. Further investigations of stromal precursor cells are needed. (1) Clinical trials using endothelial progenitor transplantation for therapeutic vasculogenesis have been of rather limited effi ciency. We and others have shown that despite hypoxic stimulation, somatic endothelial colony-forming progenitor cells (ECFCs) in vivo only form patent vessels in the presence of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs). Here we show that MSPCs but not ECFCs are the oxygen sensors enabling sustained vasculogenesis after stem/progenitor transplantation in vivo. Adult human ECFCs were isolated from whole venous blood and MSPCs from human bone marrow aspirates. Progenitor phenotype, long-term proliferation, wound repair, migratory and vasculogenic functions were monitored at different oxygen conditions. ECFC and MSPC interaction in vivo were studied in immune-defi cient NSG mice after subcutaneous co-transplantation using immune histochemistry and TUNEL assays. Chemical and genetic inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha; YC-1, shRNA) were employed to delineate the role of MSPCs and ECFCs during therapeutic vasculogenesis under hypoxia in vivo. In vitro ECFC and MSPC proliferation and function was reduced with declining oxygen levels. ECFCs stabilized HIF-1alpha only at 1% O 2 , while MSPCs stabilized HIF-1alpha at 1% and 5% O 2 .",

ECFCs co-transplanted with MSPCs formed perfused human vessels within 7 days independent of matrix protein composition. Perivascular cells, but not ECFCs accumulated HIF-1alpha in vivo. Inhibition of MSPC but not ECFC protein synthesis and S320 HIF-1alpha stabilization prior to co-transplantation completely blocked vessel formation. Our data show that MSPCs react to the low oxygen environment by HIF-1alpha stabilization and rescue ECFCs from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that MSPCs and not ECFCs act as oxygen sensors during vascular regeneration. This supports a shift of focus from endothelial cells to perivascular cells in regenerative medicine and also as a therapeutic target in anti-angiogenic therapy. Co-transplantation of endothelial and mural precursors appears to be more promising than previous strategies for therapeutic vasculogenesis. Problem: Allogenic SCT and DLI are promising T-cell based therapies to cure AML-pts. DC based specifi c T-cell stimulations could possibly further improve the antileukemic T-cell reactivity -before or after SCT. We could already show, that leukemia-derived DC (DCleu), generated from blasts, are the most effective antileukemic stimulators for T-cells, although not effectful in every case. Methods: The aim of our study was to further enlighten the role of the composition of T-cell subpopulations Na\u00efve(Tnaive), nonna\u00efve(Tnon-na\u00efve), effector(Teff), effector memory(Tem) and central memory(Tcm))for the mediation of antileukemic reactions. Moreover we investigated possible shifts of expressions of activation markers (CD69, CD71, CD28, CD137 and CD154) or of beta-Integrins beta 7-Integrin and CD29 on T-cells. In 0-7 days' mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) we stimulated autologous (n=5) or T-cells after SCT(n=6) with leukemia derived DC or blasts and studied their antileukemic reactivity compared to unstimulated T-cells in a functional Fluorolysis assay. Results: 1. Unstimulated and stimulated T-cells of AML-pts before or after SCT were characterized by higher proportions of Teff (p=0.02) and lower proportions of Tcm (p=0.08) in CD4+ and CD8+ compared to healthy T-cells. Moreover healthy T-cells showed a higher degree of activation (p=0.01-0.002) as well as higher proportions of \u00df-Integrin positive T-cells (p=0.001-0.05) before stimulation 2. Kinetic studies of AML samples showed that the T-cellular profi les developed during the fi rst 5 days of DC/blast stimulation. 3. Antileukemic functionality of T-cells was achieved in 7 of 11 (64%) cases after DC-stimulation compared to 4 of 10 cases (40%) after blast stimulation. 4. T-cell profiles correlate with antileukemic functionality of DC stimulated T-cells: In general lytically active T-cells present with a higher expression of activation markers (p=0.006-0.05) and higher proportions of Tcm and Teff, \u00df7+ and CD29+ Tnon-na\u00efve compared to non-lytic T-cells. Conclusion: Our data confi rm the central role of DC in the mediation of antileukemic T-cell response: Cases with lytic activity are characterized by higher proportions of activated Tcells, Tcm and Teff as well as \u00df7 or CD29 expressing T-cells. Our data contribute to enlighten the role of T cell subtypes in the mediation of antileukemic reactions, to predict their antileukemic function and possibly to identify and separate T cells mediating GvL without GvHD.",

Their danger signaling interactions could make them promising tools to improve leukemic antigen presentation on DC, generated from AML-patients' blasts and improve the DC-stimulation of antileukemic T-cells. Methods: The aim of our study was to elicit, whether the addition of different PINDs (Zylexis (ZY, o) Conpind (o, a), HP(a), 3P(o), HP-3P(o, a)) during DC cultures and mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) with autologous(n=2), allogeneic (n=3) or T-cells after SCT(n=3) would alter the quality and quantity of DC, composition of T-cell subsets, and/or their antileukemic functionality(AF) as studied by FACS and functional Fluorolysis assays. Results: 1. Effects of PINDs on DC: a) PINDs generally increased maturity (61 vs. 50%, p=.23) and the proportions of DCleu (65 vs. 57%, p=.55), but reduced their quantity (30 vs. 41%, p=.14) and viability (55 vs. 60%, p=.29). b) ZY displayed the best overall performance, particularly benefi tting maturity (71 vs. 50%, p=.04). 2. Effects of ZY on MLR: ZY induced early T-cell activation (CD69), mainly in the CD4+ subset (+613 vs. +170%), while late activation-and proliferation-markers (CD137, CD154, CD28, CD71 and CD25) behaved similar to MLR without ZY. T-cell differentiation to effector-T-cells and regulatory-T-cells was impaired. 3. AF was achieved in 5 of 8 cases after conventional DC-stimulation, compared to only 1 of 8 cases employing ZY (less than in the control with blast-stimulated T-cells (3 of 8)). Additionally, a blast-proliferation of up to 400% was observed under ZY. Conclusion: Our data show promising results from the usage of PINDs regarding DC-maturity, proportions of DCleu and early T-cell-induction, though resulting in an opposite effect on AF, showing an almost protective capacity towards blasts. This should raise awareness on unspecifi c infl uences of PINDs, indicating, that thorough analysis on their whole range of effects in different settings (e.g: in/ex-vivo environment, infectious/malignant) is required, before utilization in man. Nevertheless our results hint the potential of PINDs to evolve into a powerful tool in manipulating immune-processes in the future. Introduction: CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell based immunotherapies address LAA (WT1,PR1,PRAME) or minor histocompatibility antigens (HA1). We present profi les and functional characteristics of LAA directed CD4+ and CD8+ cells and provide strategies for immunotherapies. Methods: LAA-peptide specifi c CD8+ T-cells were identifi ed by MHC-multimer technology (MMT) and spectratyping (n=7). LAA/HA1-protein specifi c CD4+ T-cells were isolated after stimulation with LAA/HA1-protein loaded CD4-depleted MNCs as APC (n=6). Cells were characterized by PCR, FACS, (intracellular) cytokine, Fluorolysis/Chromium release assays. Results: 1.CD8+ T-cells: a.LAA-peptide specifi c CD8+ T-cells were found in all of 7 AML-pts after SCT. In 5 of 7 cases two different types of LAA-specifi c CD8+ T-cells were simultaneously detected. b.4 of 5 pts with two different types of LAA-specifi c CD8+ T-cells showed long lasting remissions. c.MMT selected LAA-specifi c CD8+ T-cells revealed a restricted TCR V\u00df-repertoire. 2.CD4+ T-cells: a.We provide a LAA/HA1 stimulation system using LAA/ HA1-protein-loaded CD4 depleted MNCs as APC. b.We provide a refi ned cloning system for proliferating, CD40L+CD4+ T-cells after LAA/HA1 stimulation. c.We show that in general CD4+ Tcells can mediate antileukemic activity and differentially compare the grade of cytotoxic activity in different CD4 subsets. d.Cellular profi les of stimulated/cloned as well as CD4+ T-cells isolated directly from a patient in general revealed an effector/ effector-memory profi le with a predominant inverse correlation of antileukemic activity with proportions of regulatory T-cells. e.Specifi c cytokine release in T-cells was seen not until at least 7 LAA/HA1 stimulation passages. Conclusion: We identifi ed LAA/minor antigen specifi c CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in AML pts, demonstrate their anti-leukemic function and provide stimulation and cloning strategies, that in general qualify as immunotherapeutic tools and enable a monitoring of antigen specifi c T-cells. We show, that a high antileukemic functionality or stable remissions correlate with high proportions of LAA-specifi c CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells and that certain enriched CD4+ subtypes might be even more promising candidates for GvL-without GvH-reactions. Future strategies could focus on an enrichment of anti-leukemia directed T-cells before or after stimulation with LAA/HA antigens or the depletion of certain unwanted, inhibitory T-cell fractions.",

This observation supports the notion that antitumor T lymphocytes may effectively participate in the control of Ph+ leukemic proliferation, and represents the rationale for a BCR-ABL-targeted cell therapy approach to prophylactically treat leukemic relapse after HSCT in patients with Ph+ALL. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of expanding BCR-ABL specifi c CTL from HSCT donors, to be employed as specifi c DLI after HSCT for Ph+ALL.

The T-cell lines showed specifi c INFg production in Elispot assays consistently higher (median 130 SFU/10e5 cells, range 0-198) than non-cultured donor PBMC (median 4 SFU/10e5 cells). In a standard 51chromium release assay, 5 of 6 T-cell lines presented specifi c cytotoxic activity against PHA blasts pulsed with BCR-ABL peptide mix (median lysis 30%, range 6-65), CD3-redirected activity against P815 cells (median lysis 38%, range 36-52) with minimal residual alloreactivity (median lysis 4%, range 0-15). Our data indicate that BCR-ABL-specifi c T-cell lines with limited alloreactivity may be expanded from HSCT donors after stimulation with BCR-ABL fusion regionderived peptides. Their effi cacy in containment of MRD after allogeneic HSCT for Ph+ALL remains to be evaluated in clinical trials.",

Velghe, B. Vandekerckhove, T. Kerre UGent (Ghent, BE) Therapies aimed at eliminating the leukemic stem cell (LSC) could be used to cure Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). As chemotherapy often fails to kill the quiescent LSC, the potent Graftversus-Leukemia effect, as observed in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, supports a role for immunotherapy in the treatment of AML, using cytotoxic T cells recognizing an AML specifi c antigen on the LSC. It was shown in vaccination trials that RHAMM (Receptor for Hyaluronic Acid Mediated Motility) generates a cellular immune response in patients with AML. However, it is not clear whether this response actually targets the true LSC. Therefore, we evaluated the expression pattern of RHAMM in LSCs compared to HSCs of healthy donors, the latter population prior to and after in vitro and in vivo expansion. We isolated two subpopulations from bone marrow/apheresis of both AML patients (diagnosis or relapse) and healthy donors by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting: CD34+CD38-(LSCs) and CD34+CD38+ from AML patients, and their normal counterparts from healthy donors. Real-time qPCR could not demonstrate signifi cant expression of RHAMM in HSCs of healthy donors. Overexpression could be clearly visualized in the AML samples, but strikingly, the overexpression in the LSC was minimal, compared with the CD34+CD38+ fraction of the same patients. Subsequently, human cord blood-derived CD34+ cells were isolated and expression of RHAMM was compared in fresh, non-expanded cells versus cells cultured for 7 days on the OP9 stromal cell line: a clear up-regulation of RHAMM was observed in the expanded CD34+ HSCs compared with baseline expression. To evaluate RHAMM expression during in vivo engraftment, we are currently assessing CD34+ cells from cord blood in a NOD scid gamma (NSG) mouse model. In conclusion, we were able to confi rm that healthy resting HSCs do not express RHAMM. However, our data suggest that immunotherapy targeting RHAMM will not recognize the true LSC and might be capable of eliminating only the progeny of the LSC. Strikingly, in vitro expansion of healthy HSCs causes a robust up-regulation of RHAMM. This might be a major limitation for immunotherapy targeting RHAMM in the clinical setting of a stem cell transplantation, because RHAMM-specifi c cytotoxic T cells might not be able to discriminate engrafting donor HSCs versus LSCs. Therefore, RHAMM may not be an ideal AML specifi c antigen and we advocate caution to use RHAMMdirected immunotherapy in patients. Introduction: The recent and extraordinaire clinical successes of T cells redirected with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) indicate this strategy as the new frontier for the immunotherapy of hematological malignancies. A widespread application of the strategy is however limited by the current lack of CARs for diseases different from B-cell tumors. The variant isoform 6 of CD44 (CD44v6) is expressed on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM) cells, but not on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The possible involvement of CD44v6 in chemoresistance and relapse makes it an attractive target for disease eradication. Aim: To develop a CAR strategy for safely eradicating AML and MM through the elimination of chemoresistant cells. Results: We recently found that CD44v6 is crucially involved in stroma-induced chemoresistance and in vivo tumorigenicity in both AML and MM. We therefore constructed a novel CAR specifi c for CD44v6 including the CD28 endodomain (CDD4v6 CAR). To provide a safety switch in case of toxicity, the CD44v6 CAR was cloned in a LV carrying a bi-directional promoter for its co-expression with the HSV-tk suicide gene. After LV transduction, T cells were highly cytotoxic against autologous primary AML and MM cells, and could be ablated with the prodrug ganciclovir. In the presence of chemoresistance-inducing stroma, CD44v6-redirected T cells completely cleared tumor cells. Once infused in NSG mice, redirected T cells persisted long term and eradicated AML (THP1 cells and autologous primary cells) and MM xenografts (MM1.S cells). Interestingly, the eradicating effect was dependent on both the CD28 endodomain and on CD28 costimulation used for transduction (beads). As expected, CD44v6-redirected T cells were not cytotoxic against HSC, however they recognized mature monocytes, suggesting the need of a suicide gene for controlling late toxicities. Since the rapidity of suicide-gene activation is critical to ensure the safety of potent effectors such as CAR-redirected T cells, we explored the novel inducible form of caspase 9 (iCasp9) as an alternative to HSVtk and crucially demonstrated a much faster kinetics (hrs vs days). Conclusions: CD44v6-redirected T cells have the potential to selectively eliminate AML and MM cells that resist chemotherapy. Once the eradicating effect is achieved, CD44v6-redirected could be ablated through suicide-gene activation not to interfere with full hematopoietic reconstitution.",

Catenacci (1) In virtue of their biological properties human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been identifi ed as a promising therapeutic tool in a variety of human diseases. Results reported in seminal studies prompted the hypothesis that MSC are immune privileged as they do not activate immune cells capable of rejecting them. However, subsequent reports have demonstrated that activated NK lymphocytes mediate cytolysis of MSC even though MSC suppress functions of resting NK cells. Moreover, an experimental model of HSCT documented that donor-derived murine MSC are immunogenic in an allogeneic host and stimulate donor graft rejection. We employed an in vitro approach to investigate the interaction pattern of cord blood-derived MSC with immune cells obtained from PBMC of a potential allogeneic host. Several parameters of the cell-mediated immune response were evaluated in effector cells derived from PBMC/MSC mixed cultures in comparison with PBMC cultured in complete medium alone (ctrl-cultures, spontaneous activation). Results documented a remarkable variability in respect to MSC immunogenicity and immunomodulatory properties. MSC stimulated the proliferation of CD4 T-lymphocytes in 9 of 10 exp (p<0.05) including both conventionally activated CD25 and CD25/foxp3 Treg, and CD8 T-cells in 7 of 10 exp, while they inhibited the NK proliferation in 7 of 10 exp (p<0.025). In 4 of 10 exp, effectors from mixed cultures displayed increased MSC-directed cytotoxic activity compared with ctrl-cultures (p<0.025), while in 4 of 10 exp we observed an inhibitory effect (p<0.05). MSC variably induced potential cytotoxic activity (CD107a expression) in a small % of T-CD4, T-CD8, T-CD56 and NK cells. Results of mixed cultures performed at least in duplicate employing the same lot of MSC with PBMC of the same donor obtained at different time points, also showed intra-experimental variability. The presence of neutralizing anti-HLA-G mAb (G1/ G5 specifi c) in mixed cultures strongly increased MSC-directed cytolysis in one exp and was irrelevant in another exp. MSC suppressed NK activity in 2 of 4 exp and enhanced it in 1 exp; a similar pattern was observed investigating CD3-redirected CTL activity. Altogether, results suggest that MSC may interact with T and NK lymphocytes with an inhibitory or activating pattern depending on the immune cells state of activation. Activated T or NK cells able to mediate cytolysis of MSC could counteract their immunomodulatory properties. ",

Methods: Patients (N =122) with a hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia who underwent allogeneic stem celltransplantation from sibling donors at Seoul National University Hospital between July 1998 and June 2005 were included. The-318C>T and +49A>G polymorphisms of CTLA-4 gene were genotypedusing peripheral blood DNA of 122 patients andtheirdonors. Results: Two donors were excluded because of a failure of genotyping, and a total of 242 subjects were genotyped. The genotypes of +49A>G in 122 recipients were AA in 6, AG in 46, and GG in 70; the genotypes in 120 donors were AA in 8, AG in 45, and GG in 67.

This fi nding needs further validation in welldesigned prospective clinical trials. Objectives: The aim of this study was to monitor several cytokines early after HSCT in T-cell replete, T-cell deplete and autologous HSCT and to establish their specifi c roles on GVHD occurrence and TRM. Patients and Methods: We analysed the serum levels of IL2R, TNFR1, CCL8, HGF, IL12, and IL8 before and after HSCT in 170 paediatric patients of allogeneic T-cell replete grafts, 13 patients of haploidentical T-cell depleted grafts and 14 patients underwent autologous HSCT. Serum cytokines were analysed on day -1, days +1, +7, +14, +21, +28 and +60 by a human 12-Bio-Plex assay kit in triplicate experiments (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). Student's T test was used for group comparisons of continuous variables. Thereafter, acute, chronic GVHD and 5-y TRM were calculated according to cumulative incidence (CI) probabilities. Results: The analysis of IL2R and TNFR1 serum levels did not differ among recipients of T-replete or deplete allogeneic grafts, while they were higher for allogeneic graft recipients compared to autologous grafts at each time point (P<0.000). The IL8 serum level was signifi cantly higher on days +1, +7 and +14 for allogeneic transplant vs. autologous transplants. IL12p70 was signifi cantly higher on day +1 for T replete grafts compared to T-cell depleted grafts (P=0.01), while no differences where observed between allogeneic and autologous grafts at any time points. The CCL8 serum concentration was signifi cantly higher on day +28 for allogeneic transplant recipients compared to autologous recipients (P=0.02). HGF serum levels were signifi cantly higher for allogeneic vs. autologous transplants at days +1, +7, +14, +21 and +28. To evaluate GVHD incidence, we normalized the serum cytokine increase according to the baseline value for each patient receiving unmanipulated transplants. The crude aGVHD incidence (grade III-IV) was signifi cantly higher for patients with higher IL2R at days +7 and +14, higher CCL8 at day +14, and higher levels of TNFR1 at days +14, +21 and +28. The CIs of aGVHD grade II-IV, cGVHD and TRM were 57.7% vs. 28%, 23.8% vs. 16% and 15.8% vs. 4% (all with P<0.001), for patients having CCL8, IL2R and TNFR1 over the median fold increase, respectively. Conclusion: Our data shows a different pattern of cytokine storm in myeloablative autologous and allogeneic transplants and that an early increase of pro-infl ammatory cytokines is related to severe aGVHD occurrence, translating later into higher TRM risk.

Targeting the driving oncogenic machinery of a malignancy by antigen specifi c T-cells is an attractive strategy for several reasons: (i) The oncogene is expressed within all tumor cells. (ii) in case of c-myc, silencing of oncogenic activity results in growth arrest, differentiation or cell death and therefore (iii) due to oncogene addiction of malignant cells, development of antigen loss variants is less likely. The homology between murine and human c-MYC is approximately 87%. Several non-homologous regions of the human c-MYC protein give rise to immunogenic epitopes in H2b context according to peptide prediction. Mice immunized with peptides derived from non-homologous regions of the human c-MYC protein developed a c-MYC specifi c T-cell response. As demonstrated by intracellular IFN-gamma staining this response comprised CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and frequency ranged from 0.5-3.0% of CD3+ T-cells. Animals immunized with a H2Db restricted c-MYC peptide specifi cally lysed peptide loaded target cells in vivo. Transfer of 0.1 Mio human c-MYC overexpressing lymphoma cells in mice immunized with a c-MYC specifi c CD8 epitope resulted in 30% rejection of the lymphoma. In contrast, immunization of recipient mice with irrelevant or with CD4 restricted epitopes failed to rescue mice from lymphoma challenge. Depletion of T-regulatory cells by antibody treatment prior to immunization increased survival rate up to 60% after lymphoma challenge. Frequency of c-MYC-multimer specifi c CD8+ T-cells after immunization was approximately 0,2-2% of the CD8+ compartment. After lymphoma challenge animals pertained or expanded the number of c-MYC specifi c CD8+ cells. However, adoptive transfer of CD90.2 selected T-cells after prime-boost immunization of GFP-transgenic donor mice into lambda-hu-c-myc mice resulted in long term persistence of GFP positive cells in the peripheral blood for up to 1 year, but was not associated with improved survival compared to mice receiving T-cells from irrelevant peptide immunized donors. We conclude that c-myc specifi c T-cells undergo peripheral tolerization due to the permanent expression of c-myc within the B-cell compartment. Protection from lymphoma challenge in lymphoma transfer experiments therefore may be a result of MYC acting as foreign antigen in this setting.",

Although naked RNAs are unstable, exosome-encapsulated RNAs (eRNA) are stable even in serum or plasma. Moreover, the levels and composition of plasma eRNAs may correspond to certain physiological or disease conditions by representing tissues origins of exosome. We assumed that bone marrow precursor cells also produce exosomes, which release to peripheral blood. Thus, by measuring bone marrow precursor cells-specifi c mRNAs in plasma exosome, bone marrow condition may be evaluated without invasive bone marrow aspiration. This study has focused on uncovering the potential role of extracellular eRNAs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) as non-invasive biomarkers for bone marrow engraftment. Patients and Methods: Plasma was collected form 18 patients before, 14, and 28 days after allo-HSCT. Using 300 \u03bcL of plasma, exosome was isolated and poly(A)+ mRNA was purifi ed. Then quantitative PCR was carried out to amplify control (ACTB and B2M), myeloid (DEFA3 and SRGN), erythroid (HBB and UROD), and megakaryocyte (CD61 and ITGA2B) -lineage specifi c mRNAs. The results were compared with complete blood count (CBC). Results: Among 2 sets of genes, DEFA3 and HBB were better than SRGN and UROD, respectively. The performance of CD61 was similar to that of ITGA2B. The slope of mRNA increase (DeltaCt/day) was well correlated with the slope of WBC (Del-taWBC/day) with r2 more than 0.9 for both DEFA3 and SRGN. The DeltaCt/day of HBB was correlated with the slope of reticulocyte (DeltaRet/day) with r2 0.47. The DeltaCt/day of CD61 and ITGA2B were correlated with the slope of platelet (DeltaPlt/ day) with r2 more than 0.39. More interestingly, the increase of mRNAs happened much earlier than that of CBC. Conclusion: Our results indicate that plasma eRNAs analysis could be a useful tool for the evaluation of bone marrow recovery and might be alternative to conventional bone marrow aspiration which forced mental and physical burden.",

            "text": "Objective: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent cells characterized by immunomodulatory properties and are therefore considered a promising cell therapy for autoimmune diseases. It has been shown that BM-MSCs from healthy donors are able to inhibit the activation of B cells in vitro and in vivo. Our previous study revealed that BM-MSCs from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) possessed some dysfunctions. This study aimed to assess whether inhibition on B cell activation by BM-MSCs in MRL/lpr mice, an animal model of SLE, was impaired and the possible mechanisms involved in this process. Methods: BM-MSCs were isolated and expanded from either C57BL/6J or MRL/lpr mice. The effects of BM-MSCs on the proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells of normal splenic B cell isolated from C57BL/6J mice were evaluated in vitro. And the differential expression of CCL2 on BM-MSCs from C57BL/6J or MRL/lpr mice was detected. Lupus mice were treated with these two different BM-MSCs respectively, and the levels of serum autoantibodies and immunoglobulin deposition in the kidney were monitored. Results: BM-MSCs from C57BL/6J mice inhibited the proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells of B cells in vitro. This inhibitory effect was mediated by soluble factors, including CCL2, as neutralizing CCL2 could abolish the suppressive effect on B cells mediated by normal BM-MSCs. Inhibition on B-cell proliferation and differentiation by BM-MSCs from MRL/ lpr mice was impaired, partially resulted from down-regulated expression of CCL2. The addition of processed CCL2 restored inhibitory effects of BM-MSCs from MRL/lpr mice on B-cells. In vivo treatment with BM-MSCs from MRL/lpr mice did not reduce the levels of serum pathological antibody production and immunoglobulin deposition in the kidney compared with treatment with BM-MSCs from C57BL/6J mice. Conclusions: Our fi ndings suggest that inhibitory effects of BM-MSCs on B-cell are mediated by soluble factors including CCL2. Impaired inhibition of BM-MSCs from MRL/lpr mice on B-cell maybe attributes to the down-regulation of CCL2 expression, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE. (1) Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and relapse of disease remain major problems after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), and adoptive transfer of antigen-specifi c alpha-beta-T-cells has been proposed as a treatment strategy. However, transfer of antigen-specifi c alpha-beta-T-cells is substantially hampered by their MHC-restriction and the fact that suffi cient numbers of e.g. CMV-reactive alpha-beta-T-cells can be exclusively isolated from CMV-positive donors. Great promise as an alternative strategy, with a potential use for very broad patient population, arises from the non-MHC-restricted target-recognition of cancer cells and virally-infected cells by gamma-delta-T-cells. Therefore, we investigated the role of gamma-delta-T-cells after allo-SCT and CMV infection. An increase in selectively Vdelta1-positive gamma-delta-T-cells was observed in CMV-reactivating patients from CMV-positive conventional donors. Even more important, gamma-delta-T-cell expansions were also observed after CMV-negative cordblood transplantation. However, in contrast to expansions from CMVpositive donors, gamma-delta-T-cells from cordblood donors did not only include Vdelta1-positive but also Vdelta3-positive cells. Expanded Vdelta2-negative gamma-delta-T-cells were not only able to lyse CMV-infected fi broblasts, but also to partially mature dendritic cells (DCs) and to kill primary leukemic blasts. In order to investigate whether these different functions observed in gamma-delta-T-cells which expand after CMV-infection are restricted to one cell type or to a diverse gamma-delta-T-cell repertoire which expands after CMV-infection, gamma-delta-Tcells were further cloned by limiting dilution. CMV-and leukemia-reactivity were restricted to the same clonal population and separated from DC-maturation capacities of Vdelta2-negative T-cells. Finally, gamma-delta-T-cell receptor (TCR)-gene transfer experiments indicated that here-isolated Vdelta2-negative gamma-delta-TCRs selectively mediate anti-leukemia-reactivity and that activation of T-cells depends also on the presence of NKG2D. This makes CMV-reactive gamma-delta-T-cells e.g. from cordblood donors as well as individual Vdelta2-negative gamma-delta-TCRs interesting candidates for adoptive immunotherapy strategies.",

To this end, in this study, we focused on helper functions mediated by similarly redirected CD4+ T cells using the identical TCR gene transfer. Methods: Using our novel TCR gene transfer vector encoding silencers for endogenous TCRs (WT1-siTCR vector), we retrovirally transduced HLA-A*2402-restricted and WT1 235-243-specifi c TCR alpha/beta genes into CD4+ T cells. Then we in detail examined helper functions mediated by those redirected CD4+ T cells; (i) cognate epitope-responsive cytokine production, (ii) impacts on the epitope-specifi c cytotoxicity, epitope-responsive proliferation and formation of CD45RA+CD62L-central memory T-cell (Tcm) subset mediated by WT1-siTCR transduced autologous CD8+ T cells, (iii) epitope-responsive chemokine production, (iv) anti-leukemia reactivity mediated by similarly redirected CD8+ T cells in the presence or absence of those redirected CD4+ T cells. Results: In response to cognate WT1 epitope, WT1-siTCRtransduced CD4+ T cells produced Th1 cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but not IL-10 or IL-17 in a HLA-A*2402 restricted fashion. In our transfection system, those redirected CD4+ T cells hardly displayed intracellular FoxP3, a key signature of regulatory T cell. In the presence of these helper functions mediated by redirected CD4+ T cells, WT1-siTCR-transduced CD8+ T cells successfully enhanced the reactivity both to cognate epitope and leukemia cells, including cytocidal activity, IFN-gamma production, proliferation and formation of Tcm subset. Redirected CD4+ T cells produced epitope-responsive CCL3 and CCL4, resulted in migration activity mediated by similarly redirected CD8+ T cells. Finally, WT1-siTCR transduced CD8+ T cells implemented the enhanced cytocidal activity, proliferation and formation of Tcm subset against autologous leukemia cells, but not normal cells, only in the presence of redirected CD4+ T cells using the identical WT1-siTCR vector. Conclusion: Redirected CD4+ T cells seem of multifactorial help for similarly redirected CD8+ T cells using the identical TCR gene transfer. Notably, the augmented Tcm subset formation might be able to contribute to the persistent anti-leukemia effi cacy in vivo. Thus, further studies are underway.",

            "text": "Targeting self antigens by specifi c T cells for anti-tumor therapy bears the risk of fatal autoimmunity. Appropriate self antigens are characterized by restricted expression in a specifi c cell compartment and are ideally highly expressed in malignant cells. Potential autoimmunity against those antigens must be tolerable for the host. The CD19 molecule is a transmembrane protein whose expression is restricted to B cells in mouse and human. CD19 is expressed on virtually all B-cell malignancies and is known to contribute to delivering a survival signal to B cells. Targeting CD19 by antibodies appears to be effective in disease control making it an interesting target for T-cell therapy. Using homozygous CD19cre mice as a model for CD19 deficiency we show that transfer of lethal doses of lambda-myc transgenic B-cell lymphoma cells (0.1-1.0x10 6 291cells), which form lymphomas in 85% of wild type recipients, can be rejected long term (100 days) in up to 60% (15/25) of CD19 defi cient mice. After s.c. injection 8/25 of CD19-/-animals transiently form tumors at the site of injection which eventually disappear as a sign of rejection. Depletion of T cells prevents rejection of lymphoma cells in all CD19-defi cient animals (16/16). In case of shrinking tumors as well as in some outgrowing tumors we observed an infi ltration by CD4 T cells, which was completely absent in wild type recipients. Heterotypic prime-boost-vaccination of CD19-defi cient mice using a CD19 expression vector and long peptides results in a strong CD4 T-cell response, which improves rejection of 291 lymphoma cells. A CD19-specifi c CD4 T-cell line (T27), which detects CD19+ lymphoma cells in vitro, as indicated by IFNgamma ELISPOT and ELISA assay, could be generated from vaccinated animals. In a prophylactic setting intravenous application of 1x10 6 T27 cells prior to transfer of 1x10 6 291 cells enhanced the survival of CD19-defi cient mice. Taken together our data indicate that CD19 serves as a T-cell rejection antigen in our model and provide evidence that CD4 T cells are important for rejection of lymphoma cells. (1) Problem: Allogenic SCT and DLI are promising T-cell based therapies to cure AML-pts. Dendritic cells (DC) based specifi c T-cell stimulations could possibly further improve the antileukemic T-cell reactivity before or after SCT. We could already show, that leukemia-derived DC (DCleu), are the most effective antileukemic stimulators for T-cells, although not effectful in every case. Aim: The aim of our study was to further enlighten the development and composition of regulatory T-cell (Treg) subpopulations especially in the context of T-cells' antileukemic functionality: Na\u00efve (Tnaive reg), central memory (Tcm reg), effector (memory) Treg (Teff/emm reg), regulatory ectoenzymes (CD39) or DC contact relevant Tregs (CD152) for the mediation of antileukemic reactions were analysed. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) we stimulated autologous (n=6) or allogeneic T-cells (n=1) or T-cells after SCT (n=5) with DCleu or blasts and studied their antileukemic reactivity compared to unstimulated T-cells in a functional Fluorolysis assay. Results: 1. Unstimulated T-cells of AML-pts before or after SCT were characterized by signifi cantly higher proportions of Treg subpopulations (CD4+Treg, CD8+Treg, Tnaive reg, Teff/ em reg, Tcm reg, CD39+ Treg) compared to healthy T-cells. 2. 'DC' (as well as blast) stimulated T-cells of AML-pts showed signifi cantly higher proportions of Treg subpopulations (Teff/ em reg Tcm reg Tnaive reg CD8+ Treg CD4+ Treg) and similar expression profi les of the other surface markers compared to healthy probands. 3. Kinetic analyses over time revealed a continuous increase of all Treg subpopulations during DC and blast stimulation in AML as well as healthy T-cells. 4. Functional correlations revealed signifi cantly higher proportions of CD8+ Treg, Teff/em reg and tendentially CD39+ T-cells in cases without antileukemic activity after DC-, but not after blast stimulation. 5. Low proportions of Treg subpopulation correlate with antileukemic functionality of DC stimulated T-cells: Cases with <60% of CD8+ Treg, <60% of Teff/em reg and <70% of Tcm reg showed in 80-100% antileukemic functionality. Conclusion: Higher proportions of different Treg subpopulations are found in AML patients compared to healthy probands and after DC-stimulation CD8+ Treg, Teff/em reg and CD39+ T-cells clearly correlate with reduced antileukemic activity. Refi ned analyses in the context of clinical responses to immunotherapies and GvH reactions are required.",

Gerull (1) The role of allogeneic stem cell transplantion (allo-HSCT) in the therapeutic armamentarium of multiple myeloma (MM) is very controversial. To assess the effi cacy and safety of this procedure, we performed a retrospective analysis of all MM patients allografted in Switzerland. Between October 1988 and February 2011, 94 MM patients received an allo-HSCT in the 3 national tranplant centers. Their median age at transplant was 47 (range, 24-66) years and the median interval from diagnosis to allo-HSCT was 22 (range, 3-156) months. 59 (63%) patients had IgG, 22 (23%) IgA, 5 (5%) IgD and 8 (9%) light chains MM. The median number of chemotherapy lines prior to allo-HSCT was 2 (range, 1-7). 40 (42%) patients were transplanted after achieving a fi rst remission. 51 (54%) patients had been treated with novel drugs prior to allo-HSCT and 68 (72%) had received at least 1 autologous transplantation. 67 (71%) patients were transplanted with an HLA identical sibling donor. Conditioning regimen were non-myeloablative in 78% (n=64) of the patients. At time of allo-HSCT, 35 (37%) patients were in CR/VGPR, 35 (37%) in PR, 17 (18%) in SD and 9 (10%) in PD. At time of data cut-off, the median follow up of survivors was 49 (5-233) months. Acute GVHD grade 2-4 and chronic extensive GVHD occurred in 46 (49%) and 42 (47%) patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality at 2 years was 17% (95% CI: 9%-25%). Median PFS was 430 days, with a 5 year PFS of 31% (95% CI: 22%-46%). Median OS was 5.7 years, with a 5 year OS of 51% (95% CI: 41%-61%). When comparing patients who received allo-HSCT in fi rst remission versus in later stages of the disease, the former group had a signifi cantly better 2 year OS (75% versus 60%, p=0.043) and PFS (65% versus 30%, p=0.007). Patients with chronic GvHD had an improved OS (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.45-1.72) and PFS (HR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.46-1.67), although this difference was not statistically signifi cant. Finally, while PFS was not infl uenced by the type of donor, we observed an improved 2 year OS for patients with a related donor (74% versus 48%, p=0.007). We found no impact of novels drugs administration or conditioning regimen intensity on PFS and OS. Although GVHD and transplant related mortaliy remain major limitations compromising the benefi t of the graft-versusmyeloma effect, our series suggest that an early allo-HSCT in the disease course may provide the best results in a subset of selected patients.",

Overall, from 2000 through 2009, 196 myeloma patients, median age 51 years (32-67), were transplanted at 34 Centers. Fifty-two (28.1%), 69 (37.3%), and 64 (34.6%) patients were treated with myeloablative, reduced-intensity and non-myeloablative conditioning respectively. Incidence of acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was 46.4% whereas chronic GVHD was 45.1%. There was no difference in GVHD incidence among the 3 cohorts. Complete and partial remissions in patients who survived at least 3 months post-transplant were 27% and 28%. At a median follow up of 32 (0-118) months post-transplant, in the entire study population, median OS from diagnosis was 70.6 months while OS and EFS from the allograft were 18.9 and 14.9 months. Overall, the cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) was 29.6% at 1 year and 32.4% at 5 years. OS from diagnosis and EFS from transplant were 70.6 and 28.2 months; 66.8 and 9.1 months; 111.9 and 22.4 months in patients who respectively underwent a myeloablative, a reduced-intensity and a non-myeloablative transplant. One-year and 5-year TRM was 33.3% and 35.7%, 32.2% and 34.4%, and 22.1% and 26.5% respectively. By univariate analysis, lower number of chemotherapy lines before the allograft, disease status at transplant, a fully HLA-identical donor, the use of peripheral hematopoietic cells rather than bone marrow were statistically signifi cant variables for better OS whereas disease status at transplant, a fully HLA-identical donor, chronic GVHD (either limited or extensive) were statistically signifi cant for better EFS. However, by multivariate analysis, only the development of chronic GVHD (HR 0.50; p<0.001) and a better response posttransplant (HR 2.11; p<0.03) were signifi cantly associated with longer OS whereas chronic GVHD was the only variable associated with better EFS (HR 0.32; p<0.001). Acute GVHD was associated with both poorer OS (HR 2.35; p<0.001)) and EFS (HR 3.19; p<0.001). In conclusion there appears to be a strong association between chronic GVHD and graft-vs.-myeloma effects. However, long term disease control remains an issue regardless of the conditioning employed. Prospective trials may allow to defi ne which patient category may most benefi t from an unrelated donor allograft.",

Baazizi, R. Belhadj, D. Ait ouali, R.M. Hamladji Pierre and Marie Curie Center (Algiers, DZ) Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is probably the only curative option for patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we retrospectively studied a series of allo-SCT in 25 pts with MM in our center. Patients and Methods: from April 1998 to december 2010, 25 pts with MM underwent allo-SCT with an HLA-identical sibling donor. Initially, 14 pts had MM with Ig G, 3 with IgA, 3 light chains, 3 non-secretory and two undetermined. Three pts were stage II and 22 stage III. At time of allo-SCT, 11 pts were in complete remission and 14 in refractory/progressive disease (4 received prior autologous transplant). Median age was 37 years (28-60) and the sex-ratio (M/F) 2,1. Median time from diagnosis to allo-SCT was 12 months . Two conditioning regimen used: Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with Fludarabine 150 mg/m 2 and Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 performed in 18 pts and Myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) with Busulfan 16 mg/kg associated with Cicophosphamide 120 mg/kg (7 pts). GVHD prophylaxis consisted on association cyclosporine (cSA)-mycophenolate (MMF) in RIC and CSA-methotrexate in MAC. All pts received G-CSF mobilised peripheral blood stem cells, with a median CD34+ cell count: 5,34.10 6 /kg (1.9-13) . Results: Neutropenia occurred in all pts and the median duration of aplasia was 11 days (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Only 10 pts (40%) required red blood cells transfusions and 21 pts (84%) needed platelets transfusions. Acute GVHD was observed in 12 cases (48%) including 10 cases of grade II-IV. Ten pts (58,8%) had chronic GVHD, with 7 an extensive form. Five pts (20%) had CMV reactivation. Seven pts (30,4%) relapsed at a median time of 13 months (8-45) with complete remission obtained in 3 pts (50%) after Donor Lymphocyte infusion with CD3 cells median dose: 7,5 10 7 /kg. TRM was 40%. With a median follow-up of 110 months (17-137), 10 pts (40%) are still alive in complete remission with full donor chimerism. Fifteen pts (60 %) died (2 early severe infections, 6 GVHD, 4 after relapse, one sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, one myocardial infarction, and one public highway accident). Overall survival was 38,2% (40,6% in RIC and 33,3% in MAC) and progressionfree survival was 24,4% (21,3% in RIC and 33,3% in MAC) respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests that allo-SCT is a potential therapy for refractory MM. However, TRM and relapse remain a matter of concern. Place of HSCT in the era of novels drugs is still in discussion.",

Byrne, C.D. Williams, E. Dasgupta, N.H. Russell City Hospital Campus, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (Nottingham, UK) The role of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allograft for myeloma remains controversial. Most studies have focussed on sibling allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in newly diagnosed patients following initial induction chemotherapy and autologous HSCT. Information is lacking on patients with adverse clinical features, such as poor response to initial treatment. Here we report the singlecentre outcome of 19 patients with myeloma undergoing RIC allo-HSCT using a Fludarabine/TBI (2 Gy) based conditioning regimen. Median age at HSCT was 51 years. Patients were analysed in 2 groups; patients transplanted \u2264 18 months (median 10 months; range 7-18 months) from presentation with adverse clinical features (up-front group, n=9), and patients transplanted >18 months (median 44.5 months; range 26-123 months) from presentation (delayed group, n=10). Patients in the up-front group included plasma cell leukaemia (n=2), extramedullary disease (n=3) and poor responders to fi rst-line chemotherapy/ autologous HSCT (n=2), whereas all patients in the delayed group had multiply relapsed disease. Median number of lines of chemotherapy in up-front vs. delayed groups were 2 vs. 6 respectively, with 18 patients having received \u2265 1 autograft. Patients in the up-front group were treated with tandem autograft/allograft (n=8), compared with only 2 patients in the delayed group. Donors were 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donors (n=9), sibling donors (n=9), and 4/6 matched single cord (n=1). Median follow-up was 26 (4-47) months. All but one patient engrafted (cord transplant). Of the 9 patients in the up-front group, 6 achieved CR post allo-HSCT of whom 5 remain in CR, compared with 4 out of 10 patients in the delayed group achieving CR, of whom only one remains in CR. Of the remaining patients, there were 2 deaths (TRM n=1, relapse n=1) and one stable VGPR in the up-front group, compared with 4 deaths (TRM n=2, relapse n=2), 4 relapses and 1 stable PR in the delayed group. One patient in each group died from GvHD in CR. The incidence of acute GvHD was similar in both groups (33 vs. 30%), whereas chronic GvHD was less prominent in the up-front group (40 vs. 67%). Overall survival at 2 years was 60% [up-front group (74%); delayed group (40%)]. We conclude that RIC allo-HSCT for myeloma is effective therapy for patients with adverse risk disease treated early compared to patients with multiply relapsed myeloma.",

St\u00fcbig, C. Wolschke, M. Heinzelmann, A. Badbaran, F. Ayuk, F. Bernhard, N. Kr\u00f6ger Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation (Hamburg, DE) We investigated the immune modulating effects of a combined application of bortezomib and lenalidomide as maintenance therapy for Multiple Myeloma patients after allografting. We treated 3 patients, starting between day 104 and 284 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Patients received 4 cycles of 5mg lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day schedule and 1 mg/m2 bortezomib once weekly for the same period. We measured NK, T, and B cell subset frequencies and function in peripheral blood samples. Interferon gamma (IFNg) producing T cells, especially TH1 cells, but not NK cells were signifi cantly reduced (11% vs. 4.2%; p<0.05) . Along with the TH1 cells, central memory CD4 T cells, showed a signifi cant decrease after one month of treatment (4.3% vs. 0.4%; p<0.05). Furthermore, mature but not na\u00efve T and B cells were inhibited by the lenalidomide/ bortezomib combination. We did not observe a single case of GvHD, signifi cant polyneuropathy, or haematotoxicity. However, virus infections were major adverse events. This may a direct consequence of the suppression of TH1-cells as well as mature B-and central memory T-cells. We conclude, that the combination of lenalidomide / bortezomib showed acceptable toxicity, but requires careful monitoring of viral infections. The use of anti-viral prophylaxis is strongly recommended.",

Pezzatti, A. Belotti, E. Doni, E. Pogliani Ospedale S. Gerardo (Monza, IT) In the last years Bortezomib Treatment (BT) has demonstrated an high response rate in Multiple Myeloma, both in fi rst-line and in relapsed/refractory patients (pts). We present a group of 44 pts who have been treated in the last fi ve years with Bortezomib based regimens in fi rst line (25 pts) or after failure of the fi rst-line treatment to achieve a Complete Remission or Very Good Partial Remission (CR/ VGPR) (19 pts). After BT, all these pts have been submitted to single or double Autologous Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) as consolidation program. Pts who received BT at diagnosis had advanced disease or adverse prognostic factors. Aim of the Study: Primary end points were the response rate after BT and after AHSCT, the Progression Free Survival (PFS) and the Overall Survivall (OS). Secondary end points were incidence of severe complication in AHSCT and the difference between pts treated in fi rst and second line. Results: 29/44 (65%) pts obtained a CR/VGPR after BT, 14/44 (32%) pts had partial remission (PR) and only 1 pt showed refractory disease. CR/VGPR was observed in 20/25 (80%) and 9/19 (47%) pts treated in fi rst and in second line respectively. After AHSCT 37/44 (83%) pts were in CR/VGPR and only 7/44 (14%) pts remained in PR. Relapse after AHSCT were observed in16/44 (36%) pts. 15 of them were in CR/VGPR and 1 in PR after AHSCT. 7 pts received BT in fi rst line and 9 pts in second line. 2 pts have been submitted to Allogeneic Transplant: one who relapsed and one with PR after AHSCT. 7/44 (16%) pts died, 6 for progression of disease and 1 for transplant related mortality (TRM) after allogeneic transplant. Median PFS from AHSCT is 24 months (median OS not yet reached) with a median follow-up of 22 months. TRM after AHSCT is 0/44, we observed 2 cases of life threatening infections (pneumonia), and 3 CMV reactivations. No signifi cant differences appeared between pts treated in fi rst or in second line with BT in terms of PFS and OS. Conclusion: BT seems to be very effi cient in order to obtain a CR/VGPR also in pts who did not responded or partially responded to other treatment. HSCT can improve the response obtained after BT. Despite these results 15/37 (40%) pts who achieved a CR/VGPR had a progression of the disease. These data suggest to explore which is the role of the AHSCT as consolidation treatment and to evaluate the strategy to maintain the CR/VGPR after its obtaining.",

Both of them improve the survival of these patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze retrospectively the rate of responses and safety in patients suffering from multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide after AHSCT. Methods: 22 patients undergoing ASCT between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. They received lenalidomide 25 mg/day for 21 days every month and dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4 of the cycle. Nineteen patients were started on lenalidomide because of the progression of the disease, while three ones were started as the maintenance therapy because of their age (<40 years). All patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis with aspirin 100 mg/d. Results: Twenty-two patients were analyzed, 40% women and 60% male. The median age was 64 years (32-68). Pre AHSCT induction treatment consisted on receiving VAD (n=14), VBCMP/VBAD (n=2), Bortezomib/dexamethasone (n=4) and dexamethasone alone (n=2). As for the post ASCT evaluation, 15 patients reached a partial response (PR); three, a very good partial response (VGPR); two, a complete response (CR); 1, the stable disease (SD) and 1, the progressive disease. Treatment toxicity was primarily hematologic (45%) with grade 3-4 neutropenia in 22% and 2-3 grade thrombocytopenia in 18%, forcing doses reduction in 3 cases. After a follow-up median since the beginning of lenalidomide application for 18 months , all patients achieved any degree of response (6CR, 6VGPR, 10PR), and 45% improved the post AHSCT response. Six patients had started the maintenance treatment with thalidomide after transplantation but they were switched to lenalidomide because of the toxicity. During the follow-up, 5 patients (23%) have progressed with an average time to progression of 10.8 months. Three have died from disease progression. Overall the survival after a follow-up average from diagnosis of 48 months is 86.3%. Conclusions: In our experience, lenalidomide is safe and effective treatment while it maintains and even improves the responses obtained after transplantation in multiple myeloma disease.",

Blanes (1), J.J. Lahuerta (2), J.D. Gonz\u00e1lez (3) , P. Ribas (4), C. Solano (5) Melphalan 200 mg/m 2 (MEL200) is the standard conditioning regimen administered to newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In fact, few alternatives have been explored in order to improve the antimyeloma activity of this conditioning. Here we compare intravenous (iv) busulfan (BU) 9.6 mg/kg and melphalan (MEL) 140 mg/m 2 (BUMEL) versus melphalan, MEL200 as conditioning regimen before ASCT for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. For this purpose, 51 patients receiving BUMEL undergoing ASCT between 2005 and 2009 were compared in a 1:2 matched control analysis to 102 patients receiving MEL200 transplanted from 2001 to 2005 (control group). Patients in the control group were included in the PETHEMA (Programa Espa\u00f1ol de Tratamientos en Hematolog\u00eda)/GEM2000 study. Matching criteria included age, clinical stage at diagnosis, and response to induction therapy. No differences in the overall and complete response rates were observed after ASCT between both groups. After a median follow-up of 63 and 37 months in control and BUMEL groups, progression-free survival (PFS) was 24 and 38 months, respectively. The 5-year PFS was 22% (95% CI: 18-26%) in the control group compared to 35% (95% CI: 27-43%) in the BUMEL (P=0.1). Time to progression was 26 and 39 months in the control and BUMEL groups, correspondingly (P=0.1). Hematopoietic reconstitution was similar in the two groups and the toxicities most frequently observed included mucositis and febrile neutropenia in both groups. Seven (14%) out of the 51 patients conditioned with BUMEL developed grade I/II liver toxicity that did not require any specifi c therapy. Interestingly, however no case of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was observed in the BUMEL cohort. Transplant-related mortality was 4% and 2% in BUMEL and control groups, respectively. ASCT conditioned with iv BUMEL may be considered an effective and well-tolerated alternative to a MEL200 transplant-based approach as conditioning regimen for MM patients who are candidates for ASCT.",

Results: No marked differences in oral mucositis, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), newly occurring symptoms of nervous system, duration of neutropenia, and incidence of fever were observed between the two groups. No transplantation-related mortality was observed. Both groups had similar myeloid and platelet engraftment after ASCT. Response of ASCT was comparable for two group. The median time to progression of disease in Bor-HDM group and HDM group were 20 months and 22 months, respectively. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 41.1% for Bor-HDM group and 48.6% for HDM group.

M Ramzi, M Dehghani, R Vojdani, M Zakerinia, H Nourani, M. Karimi, H. Haghighi nejad shiraz university of medical sciences (Shiraz, IR) Hematologic malignancy currently represents the main indication for HSCT. Clearly, autologous and allogeneic HSCT are established therapies in many of hematologic malignancies. High dose therapy (HDT) supported by autologous HSCT are the preferred choice for lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple myeloma. Several clinical trials have shown the superiority of high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) over conventional dose therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. During 7 years, we treated 57 patients with multiple myeloma (mean age=50, range: 31-70) with a preparative regimen of Melphalan 140-200 mg/m 2 . Patients were treated by intensive chemotherapy followed by reinfusion of non-cryopreserved autologous stem cells. The source of stem cell in all patients was peripheral blood. The median time of hospitalization was 21 days (range: 16-36). The median time to platelet count >20\u00d710 9 /L was 14 days (range: 10-33). Also, the median time to absolute neutrophil count >0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 11 days (range: 9-21). All the 57 patients were engrafted and there was not graft failure in this study group. Responses (complete and partial response) were seen in all the 57 patients. One hundred days transplant-related mortality was 1.7%. We concluded HDT and autologous stem cell transplantation without cryopreservation is an effective and safe method which simplifi es the procedure and is feasible and cost saving in our patients.",

Ivanova, A. Mihova, L. Garcheva, St. Toshkov NSBALHZ (Sofi a, BG) Since 2004 year a total of 191 eligible patients are treated with autologous (ASCT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) as a standard therapeutic procedure according to the universally accepted guidelines in Bone Marrow Transplantation ward at NSBALHZ, Sofi a, Bulgaria (CIC 859). Aim: The aim of the study was to analyze the outcome, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse rate (RR) and transplanted related mortality (TRM) for the procedure of transplanted patients at NSBALHZ during the period of 2004 to July 2011 year. The response assessment post-transplantation was defi ned as: complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and no answer/progression (PROG) rates. Patients and Methods: 184 patients received auto-SCT were included. The auto-SCT group comprised of multiple myeloma patients (MM, n=78), Morbus Hodgkin (MH, n=52), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, n=44), acute leukemia (AL) and solid tumour (n=3). Due to the small number allogeneic transplanted patients, this group was excluded from the analysis. Results: In all ASCT were used myeloablative conditioning regimen according to the patient's diagnosis and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC). In NHL auto-transplanted patients group were registrated CR rate of 48%, PR 9%, RR 2%, PROG 18%, TRM 5%. The 3-year OS was 63% and the 3-year PFS 49%. MH group after ASCT CR was 40%, PR 15.4%, RR 0%, PROG 34.6% and TRM 5.8%. OS and PFS were respectively 54% and 46%. In myeloma patients CR was 19.6%, VGPR 56%, PR 21.3%, PROG 0% and TRM 3%. OS 85.6% and PFS 63.1%. Due to ASCT 85.6% of AL patients attained CR on 3th month. Nowadays only 1 patient is still alive in CR and the other died because of relapse. Conclusion: The presented results of our eight-year experience in the HSCT fi eld show that transplantation of hematopoietic stem cell now is a preferable method of treatment in eligible patients with high risk and relapsed oncohematological malignancies. Unfortunately the problem of late decision sending patients for ASCT and the professional understanding of the role of stem cell transplantation still exist. This is why our future efforts are aimed at increasing transplanted patients number and incorporating HLA incompatible unrelated donor and HLA haploidentical sibling donor in routine clinical practice.",

Alessandrino Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.Matteo (Pavia, IT) High dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/ASCT) was investigated in AL amyloidosis based on its success in treating multiple myeloma patients. A complete hematologic response has been reported up to 72% of pts. The greatest matter is the transplant related mortality (TRM) which ranges from 5% to 14% in single centre studies and from 24% to 43% in multicenter studies. We report the results of a single centre study performed at BMT Unit in Pavia, from 2000 to 2010. Nineteen pts with amyloidosis received HDM rescued by ASCT. The median age of pts was 53 years (range 38-60), 8 male and 11 female. The median interval from diagnosis to ASCT was 277 days (range 133-1900) . In all but one pt peripheral hemopoietic stem cells (PHSC) were harvested by one or two leukapheresis after mobilization with G-CSF subcutaneously at the dose of 10 mcg/kg for 4 or 5 days. In one pt (UPN 1132) PHSC mobilization was performed by intermediate dose of cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. The majority of pts had ASCT with active disease, only one (UPN 1076) received ASCT in complete remission. Three pts with heart failure had cardiac transplantation followed by HDM and ASCT. As far as the dose of melphalan, 6 of 19 received a melphalan reduced dose (140-160 mg/m 2) . All pts, in the attempt to reduce the risk of arrhythmias or sudden death, had washed stem cells: DMSO was removed by centrifugation, performed immediately prior to infusion. The hemopoietic recovery was documented at day + 13 (range +11-+42). At the time of the present evaluation 17 of 19 pts are alive, one pt died of transplant related complication at day +6, another pt died of disease progression at day + 190. Complete remission was achieved in 9 pts. The actuarial probability of survival at 5 years is 84% with a median survival of 934 days (range 190-4430) . The progression free survival is 45% at 5 years. Eight pts with persistent clonal disease after ASCT received further treatment with either thalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib or dexamethasone alone. The low TRM (5%) and the long survival suggest that this approach is safe and lead to an improved overall survival.",

Kim Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital (Jeollanam-do, KR) Background: CTD regimen has been known as an effective induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM. But, there were inconsistent results for the autologous stem cell yield for transplantation. The aim of present study was to identify the infl uence of CTD therapy on outcome of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection. Methods: Forty-eight patients received 4 cycles of CTD therapy. Stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (3.0 g/m 2 ) and G-CSF (10 \u03bcg/kg, daily) or G-CSF alone. Patients failing to collect \u2264 4.0 x 10 6 CD34+ cells /kg received a second mobilization courses. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 39-69). Median duration from start of CTD therapy to fi rst collection was 4.6 months (range, 3.3-8.7). Forty-four patients were mobilized with cyclophosphamide following with G-CSF and 4 patients with G-CSF alone. The median day of apheresis was 3 days (range, 2-7). The response rate for CTD regimen at mobilization was 10% (5/48) of CR, 25% (12/48) of VGPR and 63% (30/48) of PR. A median number of harvested CD34+ cells was 8.6 x 10 6 cells/kg. At the fi rst mobilization, 83% (40/48) of patients had been reached the minimal PBSC collection target of \u22652.0 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg and 71% (34/48) of patients achieved the collection \u22654.0 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. At the end of second mobilization, 90%(43/48) of patients had yields of at least \u22652.0 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg and 77% (37/48) of patients had yields of \u22654.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. During mobilization period, three patients were developed grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse events. Conclusion: CTD regimen is an effective induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM showing high response rate and acceptable rate of autologuos stem cell yield without any detrimental effect for the following stem cell collection.",

Costa, J. Abbas, K. McDonald, K. Hogan, C. Kramer, K. Shoptaw, C. Butcher, A. Littleton, Y. Kang, R. Stuart Medical University of South Carolina (Charleston, US) Objective: Lenalidomide, a component of several modern induction regimens in multiple myeloma (MM), leads to suboptimal autologous hematopoietic stem cell (AHSC) mobilization. Cyclophosphamide + fi lgrastim mobilization at least partially overcomes the negative impact of lenalidomide but leads to higher cost and toxicity. We hypothesized that growth factor + preemptive plerixafor is a safe and highly effi cient strategy for initial AHSC mobilization in MM despite prior exposure to lenalidomide. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patient characteristics and mobilization outcomes of 89 consecutive MM patients undergoing fi rst steady state mobilization with fi lgrastim or pegfi lgrastim \u00b1 preemptive plerixafor using a previously validated algorithm based on day 4 peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (PB-CD34+) and mobilization target. Mobilization outcomes were analyzed for three distinct groups according to the extent of prior exposure to lenalidomide: no prior exposure (group A, N=40), 1 to 4 cycles (group B, N=30) and > 4 cycles (group C, N=19). Results: Median age was 57.5 years and similar across groups. Median number of prior lines of therapy was 1 in A and B and 2 in C. Median PB-CD34+ was 27/mm 3 , 14.5/mm 3 and 10/mm 3 for groups A, B and C, respectively ( Figure  1 , P<0.001). Multivariate analysis with PB-CD34+ as the dependent variable yielded only age, number of prior cycles of lenalidomide and mobilization with pegfi lgrastim as signifi cantly associated with PB-CD34+. Only 45% of patients in A required plerixafor vs. 63% in B and 84% in C, P=0.01. The median yield of CD34+ collected was 8.1 x 10 6 CD34+/kg in A, 7.4 x 10 6 CD34+/kg in B and 7 x 10 6 CD34+/kg in C. A higher proportion of patients in A (100%) met the mobilization target (6 x 10 6 CD34+/kg for most patients) than in B (90%) or C (79%), P=0.008. All patients collect at least 2 x 10 6 CD34+/ kg. HSC collection was completed after a median of 1.5 daily apheresis sessions in A and B and 2 in C. The estimated cost of mobilization and collection was similar between A (median US$ 22,280) and B (US$ 22,280), but substantially higher in C (US$ 35,020). Conclusion: Steady state growth factor mobilization with a validated algorithm for preemptive use of plerixafor is an adequate upfront mobilization strategy for MM patients regardless of prior exposure to lenalidomide negating the need for chemotherapy mobilization.",

            "text": "The stem cell mobilising potential of vinorelbine chemotherapy in myeloma patients is more effi cient with G-CSF than with plerixafor (PAV-trial) T. Pabst, J. Raschle, M. Bleckmann, B. Mansouri Taleghani, D. Friess University Hospital (Berne, CH) Background: Vinorelbine chemotherapy in combination with G-CSF is the standard regimen to mobilize autologous stem cells in myeloma patients in Switzerland. The potential of the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor is unclear within this concept. In addition, the stem cell mobilizing capacity of plerixafor together with chemotherapy, in the absence of G-CSF, is unknown in myeloma patients. Methods: In this single arm phase II study, we analyzed 4 consecutive cohorts of 10 myeloma patients undergoing peripheral stem cell collection before high-dose chemotherapy in fi rst remission. All 40 patients received 240 \u03bcg/kg plerixafor (P) at stem cell collection on day 8 (and, if necessary, day 9). In cohort 1 (VGP), patients received vinorelbine (V) 35 mg/m 2 on day 1 and G-CSF (G) 1 Mio U/kg/day starting at day 4, whereas no G-CSF was applied in cohort 2 (VP). In cohort 3, G-CSF was given, but not vinorelbine chemotherapy (GP). Finally, patients in cohort 4 received no G-CSF, but vinorelbine and delayed plerixafor (VPd) at the fi rst day of a CD34+ increase exceeding 15,000 CD34+ cells/ml, (but not later than day 12). Results were compared to a historical control (68 patients) of our standard VG regimen with a median CD34+ mobilization of 99,120 CD34+ cells/ml. Plerixafor was given i.v. for 30 minutes at 8AM and apheresis started at 12PM to test stem cell collection in a one day procedure. Results: We observed excellent stem cell mobilization (median 174,800 CD34+/ml) using the triple regimen VGP, whereas VP (cohort 2) resulted in a poor stem cell mobilization of only 9,390 CD34+ cells including one collection failure. Omitting vinorelbine in cohort 3 (GP) allowed stem cell mobilization (102,000 CD34+/ml) similar to our VG standard regimen. Individualizing the day of apheresis in cohort 4 (VPd), while omitting G-CSF, did not improve the inferior mobilization of VP (median 15,200 CD34+/ml). The i.v. plerixafor administration was well tolerated and allowed collection of stem cells in cohorts 1 (VGP) and 3 (GP) in a one day procedure in all patients. Conclusion: Our results indicate that plerixafor can be safely added to mobilization chemotherapy with vinorelbine. Plerixafor and chemotherapy in the absence of G-CSF have a poor mobilization potential, whereas plerixafor together with G-CSF can replace vinorelbine chemotherapy allowing potent stem cell mobilization. Intravenously administered plerixafor (VGP or GP) offers convenient stem cell collection in a one day procedure.",

Mans, B. Mueller, T. Pabst University Hospital (Berne, CH) Background: A variety of factors have been reported to affect prognosis in patients with multiple myeloma including cytogenetic abnormalities, molecular markers, cytokine profi ling, and clinical parameters. In contrast, markers are widely lacking to characterize patients who preferentially benefi t from high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation which represents a cornerstone in the fi rst-line treatment of multiple myeloma patients. Therefore, we investigated whether varying levels of mobilized CD34+ cells confer prognostic information in myeloma patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy. Methods: In this retrospective study, we determined circulating CD34+ cells at the day of peripheral stem cell collection in 158 consecutive myeloma patients between January 2001 and August 2010 in a single academic center. Patients were stratifi ed into two groups (super versus normal mobilizers) with a cut-off of 100,000 peripheral CD34+ cells/ml. We hypothesized that excellent stem cell mobilization is associated with an intact bone marrow homeostasis and thus confers favorable prognostic information. Results: We found that patients with more than 100,000 circulating CD34+ cells/ml peripheral blood (69 pts.) had a better overall survival (P=.005) and a prolonged time to progression (P=.0398) than patients with CD34+ cell counts below 100,000 CD34+ cells/ml (89 pts.). After a median follow-up of 32.5 months, 12 deaths occurred in the super mobilizer and 30 in the normal mobilizer group (P=.0289). Whereas the group of super mobilizers did not yet reach the median survival, the group of normal mobilizers had a median survival of 50 months. Patient characteristics did not differ between the two groups. High levels of CD34+ cells were an independent marker for better overall survival and time to progression in a multivariate analysis that included disease stage, response at transplant, light chain subtype, age, sex, and height. Conclusion: Our results suggest that high levels of mobilized peripheral CD34+ cells are associated with favorable outcome in myeloma patients undergoing autologous transplantation. We propose that this biomarker might be considered to be integrated into future risk stratifi cation in myeloma patients to select patients for a post-transplant maintenance or consolidation strategy.",

Gaponova, E. Gretsov, A. Panteleev, N. Kalinin, E. Parovichnikova, V. Savchenko Research Center for Hematology (Moscow, RU) Background: Cyclophosphomide (CY) combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is commonly used to mobilize blood progenitor stem cells to support high-dose therapy with melphalan in patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM). Aim: To defi ne the optimal terms of G-CSF initiation in patients with MM receiving high-dose CY for blood progenitor stem cell mobilization. Methods: We have analyzed stem cell mobilization effi cacy in 59 pts with newly diagnosed MM previously treated with VAD or bortezomib-containing courses in the department of highly-dose Chemotherapy and Bone Marrow Transplantation from June 2000 to December 2008. There were 32 male, and 27 female, median age 51, 5 (range 36-68) . In mobilization procedure pts received CY 6 g/m 2 followed by daily administration of G-CSF 5 mcg/kg. G-CSF was prescribed on day +3 after CY in 28 cases (fi rst group), on day +5 in 7 cases (second group) and in 24 cases (third group) after the reduction in the number of WBC <1x10 6 /l (+6-+9 day after CY, median +8 day). Results: The date of the fi rst apheresis procedure did not differed in three groups and was on the day +15 after CY administration. The longitude of G-CSF administration was 11-20 (median 14) days in the fi rst group, 9-15 (median 12) days in the second group and 6-13 (median 9) days in the third group (p<0,05). The median number of aphereses performed in each group was 2 (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The regimens proved to be effective in the progenitor cell mobilization. In the fi rst group 31,4 (1, 8) x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg were collected, in the second group the number of CD34+ cells was 29,2 (2,06-100)x10 6 /kg and in the third group -31,2 (5,5-106)x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg. The terms of G-CSF administration did not infl uence on the highest yield of peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cells. The highest yield of PB CD34+ cells was 326740\u00b180728 cells/ml in the fi rst group, 335391\u00b164505 cells/ml in the second group and 311043\u00b139678 cells/ml in the third group. Conclusion: The date of the fi rst leukapheresis was not in dependence on the terms of G-CSF initiation. The effi cacy of stem cell mobilization was the same in 3 groups of pts in spite of the term of G-CSF initiation or the longitude of its administration. As the analysis showed that economy of 3-5 doses of G-CSF due to the later administration of drug never reduce the effi cacy of stem cell mobilization leaving to the collection quantity of CD34+ cells that is enough for double autologous stem cell transplantation.",

Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: Antithymocyte globulines (ATG) are widely used in allogeneic stem cell transplantation for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease and known to induce cytotoxicity against various human cells. Preclinical studies have reported ATG-induced apoptosis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in human myeloma cells in vitro and in a mouse model. Antibody-based treatment for myeloma has been unsuccessful in part due to the heterogynous phenotype of myeloma cells. Methods: In an effort to improve the anti-myeloma effect and reduce toxicity of polyclonal antibodies, antimyeloma globulins (AMG) were produced by immunizing rabbits with myeloma cell lines RPMI-8226 (AMG-8226) or KMS12BM (AMG-12BM) and purifi ed (Fresenius Biotech) using the same procedure as for ATG. Cytotoxicity of ATG-Fresenius and the AMGs was compared in primary T cells, myeloma cells (RPMI-8226, KMS12-BM, OPM-2) and non-haematopoietic cell (Hacat and Panc1). NK cell mediated antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) was studied using chromium release assay, while other cytotoxicity assays were analysed by fl ow cytometry after staining with 7AAD. Combination effects of the polyclonals and bortezomib or melphalan were analysed using Calcusyn\u00ae. Results: AMGs demonstrated stronger cytotoxicity against myeloma cells and T cells compared to ATG. Cytotoxicity against non-haematopoietic cell lines tended to be higher for ATG compared to both AMGs. AMG-8266 was used for further comparisons. Competitive blocking assays revealed that AMG-8266 contained 4x more specifi c antibodies against CD38 compared to ATG. At high concentrations of 100-500 ug/ml both ATG and AMG inhibited NK mediated ADCC (p<0.001 in both cases) compared to control with only NK cells. ATG thereby inhibited ADCC signifi cantly more than AMG-8266 (p<0.001). Both polyclonals augmented NK cytotoxicity in low concentrations of 0.1-10 ug/ml (p<0.001 in both cases) compared to NK cells alone. Combinations of ATG with melphalan or bortezomib showed synergistic cytotoxic effects on KMS-12BM cells with combination effects (CI) ranging from 0.69 to 0.94 and 0.69 to 1.10 respectively. Combination of AMG with melphalan and bortezomib showed similar synergistic effects with CI 0.70 to 0.98 and 0.70 to 1.0 respectively. Conclusion: Our data show favorable anti-myeloma effects of AMG compared to ATG, toxicity however remains considerable. There is still need for development of more specifi c antibodies for the treatment of myeloma.",

Loseto, G. Guaragna, A. Giannotta, M. Brocca, M. Girasoli, A. Melpignano, G. Quarta A. Perrino Hospital (Brindisi, IT) Background: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) were initially recognized in solid organ transplant recipients where its incidence can range from 1% to 6%. Among patients undergoing haematopoietic cell transplantation, PTLDs occur almost exclusively in recipients of allogeneic grafts with an overall incidence rate of 1% to 2% and manifest early posttransplantation within the fi rst years. PTLDs are extremely rare in patients undergoing auto-SCT and the median time from diagnosis of MM is 56 months (Fenk 2011). Case Report: We report the case of a 70 year-old male patient underwent a fi rst auto-SCT for MM who manifested early PTLD. He was conditioned with melphalan 140 mg/m 2 ; on day 0, he received cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cell (4x106 CD34+ cells/kg). Engraftment was prompt, neutrophil recovery > 0,5 x 10 9 /l and platelets > 20x10 9 /l occurring on days +11 and +13, respectively. Surprisingly, on day +43 from auto-SCT, peripheral blood smear showed absolute lymphocytosis (WBC count 14.9x10 9 cells/L; absolute lymphocytic count 9.5x10 9 cells/L). The bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow trephine biopsy confi rmed the presence of a population of large granular lymphocytes, mimicking a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Immunohistochemistry and fl ow cytometry immunophenotyping, performed on fresh cells obtained both from bone marrow and peripheral blood, showed T-cell-associated antigens (CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD56-).",

Conclusions: T-LGL leukemia has been seen after solid organ transplantation and allo-SCT; the PTLDs are extremely rare in auto-SCT patients. In allo/auto-SCT, EBV serologic status and viral infections represent a pathologic state in which chronic antigenic stimulation may result in T-cell clonal expansions; in addition, incidence of PTLDs is related to intensity of immunosuppression and additional genotoxic stress of therapeutic programs. In our case, both the negativity of all viral serological tests and very short time interval of occurrence, we push to hypothesize that T-LGL leukemia derives from coexisting undetected small-sized clone of T-cells.",

Methods: We here report a 58 years old male patient with POEMS syndrome treated with ASCT at our institution. Rapidly progressive polyneuropathy ultimately evolving to tetraparesis and paresis of the diaphragm, associated with monoclonal gammopathy (type IgG lambda), mild hepatosplenomegaly, multiple endocrine abnormalities and sclerotic bone lesions led to the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. Typically, VEGF levels were elevated. The patient was bedridden and required noninvasive ventilation support. The cardiac situation was complicated by a sino-atrial and a complete atrio-ventricular block requiring implantation of a pacemaker. Results: Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor without chemotherapy. Highdose melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) was used as conditioning regimen. Early post-transplant complications included neutropenic fever, septic shock and respiratory failure, necessitating temporary treatment in the intensive care unit. After hematologic recovery, continuous neurologic improvement was observed. Six months after ASCT, the patient was able to walk short distances without assistance but neuropathic pain persisted during follow-up. VEGF and lambda light chain levels remained normal, and no monoclonal gammopathy was detectable in the serum. Conclusion: This report of a patient with POEMS syndrome treated with ASCT suggests that severe polyneuropathy and critical overall clinical condition can improve dramatically and rather rapidly, consistent with other reports of patients with POEMS syndrome treated with ASCT. Even patients severely debilitated by POEMS syndrome appear to benefi t from aggressive treatment with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. These benefi ts need to be weighed against severe treatment related side effects. (2) Osp.

The incidence of extramedullary MM localizations in soft tissues has increased in the last decade and a \"biological\" effect of new drugs as well as the immunosuppression secondary to allogeneic transplantation have been advocated as potential causes. Herein we report an unusual case of MM who developed class switch after ABMT and multiple bilateral breast localization after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. A 56 years old lady diagnosed IgAL MM on November 2005, she received induction therapy with thalidomide dexametasone (DEX) followed by ABMT attaining a complete remission (CR). Relapse occurred after 23 months. Noteworthy, the immunohistochemical investigation highlighted that plasmacellular infi ltrate was IgA negative and expressed only L light chain. Immunofi xation showed a L monoclonal component (MC) in the urine and serum while the IgA MC was no more detectable. The patients received a second lines therapy with bortezomib-DEX followed, for partial response, to therapy with lenalidomide (LEN) and DEX. RIC bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA identical sibling was then performed on December 2009; At day 100 full chimerism and CR were documented and subsequently a limited chronic cutaneus developed. Eighteen months after RIC transplant the patients discovered a small lump (1.5 cm) in the left breast. Both mammography and echography were suspicious for malignancy and prompted a fi ne-needle biopsy. The histological assessment revealed a massive infi ltration of L restricted IgA -IgG negative plasma cell providing the diagnosis of extramedullary relapse. In couple of weeks new breast lumps developed,L BJ proteinuria was again detected and new osteolitic lesions were documented while bone marrow showed less than 4% plasma cells and the chimerism was full donor. We started again treatment with LEN-DEX. The breast is an unusual reported site of MM localization. Imaging studies are unspecifi c and small lesions can be misdiagnosed as a benign process. In our opinion in MM patients, particularly if they have received immunomodulatory drugs or allogeneic BMT, even small breast lesions should cautionary undergo histological evaluation by means of fi ne needle biopsy.",

Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou, E. Terpos, D. Christoulas, M. MIgkou, E. Kastritis, M. Gkotzamanidou, N. Nikitas, E. Manios, M.A. Dimopoulos, C. Papadimitriou Alexandra Hospital (Athens, GR) Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are at a higher risk of infections compared to general population. Up to 80% of MM patients who undergo autologous transplantation with stem cell support (ASCT) develop neutropenic fever. The mannan binding leptin (MBL) pathway of the complement system is part of the innate immune system and seems to infl uence the risk of infections in cancer patients during treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of MBL levels on the risk of infections and on the risk of development of febrile episodes in MM patients who receive HDM and ASCT. We studied 100 MM patients who underwent an ASCT between 1996-2011 in a single center. Sixty-seven patients participated in a randomized study, where in the fi rst arm patients received prophylactic antibiotics, while in the arm B there was no antibiotic prophylaxis. In case of neutropenic fever, prophylactic antibiotics were interrupted and fi rst line regimen was administered. In case of failure of fi rst line treatment, a second line antibiotic combination was administered. MBL serum levels were measured in all patients on the day of mobilization, using an ELISA methodology (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Seventeen (17%) patients had MBL levels <500 mg/L. Of those, 11 received antibiotics prophylaxis and 6 did not. In general, there was no statistical difference regarding the development of fever or neutropenic fever between patients with MBL serum levels of <500 mg/L or \u2265500 mg/L. However, among 17 patients with MBL levels of <500 mg/L, 6 /11 patients who received antibiotics prophylaxis developed a febrile episode compared to 6/6 patients who did not receive antibiotics prophylaxis and developed a febrile episode (p=0.049). Nevertheless, patients with MBL levels <500 mg/L attained a lower response rate to fi rst line therapy with antibiotics, i.e. lower percentage of fever resolution and higher incidence of necessitated administration of a second line antibiotic regimens, compared to patients with MBL levels of \u2265500 mg/L (66.7% versus 88.9%, respectively; p=0.05). The results of our study suggests that MM patients who underwent ASCT and had low levels of MBL had a lower response rate in fi rst line antibiotic regimens, requiring more often administration of a second more advanced line of antibiotics. Furthermore, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics to these patients seems to reduce the number of febrile episodes.",

            "text": "Weight loss of more than ten per cent and radiographic fi ndings are the most important predictive factor for suspecting tuberculosis in patients with multiple myeloma post autologous transplant G. Linga, S. Gundeti, N. Thota, P. Coca, R. Digumarti Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences (Hyderabad, IN) Purpose: The incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis is high in India. In today's practice young multiple myeloma patients are treated with induction chemotherapy followed with high dose melphalan and maintenance chemotherapy. In our clinical practice we came across patients with multiple myeloma post transplant, are highly susceptible to tuberculosis and high degree of suspicion is required. Aim: To determine the predictive factors to suspect the tuberculosis in patients with multiple myeloma post transplant. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients with multiple myeloma who underwent autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) from January 2005 to November 2011. The entire patient fulfi lled the criteria for diagnosis symptomatic myeloma. After induction chemotherapy with standard regimen patient were transplanted with 200mg/m2 melphalan as myeloablative regimen. We analyzed the predictive factors for suspecting tuberculosis in these patients. Results: There were total of 16 patients who underwent autologous transplant, (18.7%) three patients developed tuberculosis with 6 months post BMT. We analysed for complete remission status pre trasnpalnt (p=1.15), complete remission status post transplant (p=0.56), median no of days for neutrophil to engraftment (p=0.48), fatigue (p=0.21), loss of appetite (p=0.20), loss of weight >10% of pretransplant (p=0.007), chest X ray abnormality (p=0.01). Conclusion: Weight loss of more than 10% and chest radiological fi ndings are most important predictive factors to diagnose tuberculosis in patients with multiple myeloma post BMT. Chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD)with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) affecting the lungs is a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). It occurs in about 5-10% of the patients surviving > 100 days, and lung transplantation (LTx) may be the only treatment option for progressive respiratory failure. However, it is uncertain whether LTx is safe and justifi ed in these patients, given the lack of organs and the risk of relapse of the underlying disease. For these reasons it is common to wait for a minimum of two years after treatment of malignant disease for patients to be eligible for LTx. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate this treatment based on the cases of LTx performed after ASCT in Scandinavia. All lung transplant centres in Sweden, Norway and Denmark were contacted, and data on patients with LTx after ASCT was recorded. Survival data from the Scandiatransplant register was used for comparison using log-rank test. LTx after ASCT was performed in 11 patients (<1% of all LTx in Scandinavia in the time interval). ACT was done due to chro-nic myeloid leukaemia (n=3), acute myeloid leukaemia (n=4), acute lymphatic leukaemia (n=2), immunodefi ciency (n=1) and aplastic anaemia (n=1). All patients had clinical cGVHD, and pathological examination of the extirpated lungs showed obliterative bronchiolitis in 10 patients while one showed nonspecifi c fi brosis. All patients received bilateral LTx. Median age at LTx was 34 years (range 16 to 55), and the median interval from ASCT to LTx was 8 years (range 8 months to 16 years). The median observation time after LTx was 5 years (range 2 months to 15 years). Two patients have died, one due to septicaemia, the other due to relapsing leukaemia, 2 and 14 months after LTx, respectively. In these patients, the time from ASCT to LTx was 10 years and 13 months, respectively. Of the remaining, 4 patients developed BOS, of which one was retransplanted. Survival was not different in the 11 patients lung transplanted after ASCT than in patients matched for age, transplantation year and country. Survival in our cohort is not inferior to the survival in matched controls from the Scandiatransplant register. We therefore suggest that LTx may be considered in carefully selected patients with BOS after ASCT.",

Todd Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) Patients receiving high-dose chemoradiotherapy prior to haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) compared to normal populations. CVRFs include hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes. In this study we have looked at the relationship between the average amount of exercise undertaken per week and the likelihood of developing two or more of these CVRFs in long term survivors of HSCT for haematological malignancy. Data from routine follow up was collected on 49 consecutive patients attending a dedicated haematology-endocrine follow up clinic. The average amount of exercise done per week over the preceding year was recorded together with details of medication, blood pressure readings and laboratory data relating to lipid and glucose measurements. A patient was considered to be dyslipidaemic if they were taking a statin, if they had a cholesterol-HDL ratio above 5 or an LDL persistently above 4. Of 49 patients, 25 were female and the median age at followup was 53 years (range 33-76). 41 had been treated for CML and 8 for acute leukaemia. The median follow-up time was 20 years (range 8-32) and the median dose of TBI received was 12Gy (range 10-14Gy). Patients were divided into three groups according to average weekly exercise. Group A: <2 hours (n=18), Group B: 2-4 hours (n=15) and Group C: >4 hours (n=16) . In group A, 9 /18 (50%) had 2-3 CVRF; in group B, 4/15 (27%) had 2-3 CVRF and in group C, 2/16 (12.5%) had 2-3 CVRF. This trend was statistically signifi cant (p=0.019) on a chi-squared trend test. The prevalence of 2-3 CVRF in combined groups B+C was 6/31 (19%) which was signifi cantly lower than that for group A with a p value of 0.025 by chi-squared tests. Patient age and duration of follow up are additional variables which have been linked to the acquisition of CVRFs. In this study, there was no signifi cant difference between the median ages of patients in groups A, B, C nor between transplant-follow up time.",

Terpos Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) Skeletal abnormalities are well described following HSCT and include fractures, AVN, reduced bone density and alterations in markers of bone metabolism. We have previously described signifi cant increases in markers of both bone formation and bone resorption in our very long term survivors of transplant. It is not clear, however, what the key infl uences on bone metabolism might be in ambulant very long term survivors of HSCT who are not taking steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. We have investigated this by measuring osteoprotegerin (OPG), soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) and dikkopf-1 (DKK-1) as important regulators of osteoclast and osteoblast function. 18 patients (9 female) were investigated a median of 16 years (range 9-29) post SCT. The median age at evaluation was 48 years (range 39-71). Patients had received cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and TBI at a median dose of 13.2 Gy (range 10-14.4 Gy) as pre-transplant conditioning. All patients were euthyroid and normocalcemic and all male patients had normal testosterone levels at analysis. A pairwise comparison between patients and controls was performed using Wilcoxon signed ranks test for non-parametric samples. Median serum levels of RANKL were 0.3 pmol/l (range 0. 1-1.4) in the patient group compared to 0.08 pmol/l (range 0.001-0.96) in the controls representing a non-signifi cant increase. Median serum levels of OPG were signifi cantly elevated at 6.2 pmol/l (range 2.8-8.9) compared to 3.2 pmol/l (range 1. 1-5-2) in the control group (p=0.001). Median serum levels of Dkk-1 were signifi cantly increased in the patient group at 83.2 ng/ml (range 41.8-249.4) compared to 34.6 ng/ml (range 13.8-54.3) in the control group (p=0.0001). The RANKL/OPG ratio was normal. RANKL is the major activator of osteoclast function, while OPG is the decoy receptor of RANKL and inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Dkk-1 is a member of the Dkk family of proteins which are negative regulators of the Wnt-signalling pathway and play a central role in bone formation. Dkk-1 enhances levels of RANKL and suppresses osteoblastogenesis. Our data demonstrating a signifi cantly elevated Dkk-1 implicates alterations in Wnt -signaling in the pathogenesis of altered bone metabolism in very long-term survivors of HSCT. The rise in OPG despite elevated Dkk-1 may represent a compensatory balance effect against increased osteoclast function; the normal ratio of RANKL / OPG would support this.",

Ray\u00f3n, C. Vallejo University Central Hospital of Asturias (Oviedo, ES) Introduction: Gonadal failure (GF) is an important risk factor for osteopenia, cardiovascular disease, sexual dysfunction, and growth delay. GF has been associated with the use of conditioning regimens (Cx) with TBI, Busulphan, and, to a lesser extent Cyclophosphamide. But the impact of other Cx on gonadal function has been less described. Patients and Methods: We evaluated FSH (U/L), LH (U/L), estradiol (pg/mL) and testosterone (ng/mL) pre and post-HSCT (days +100 and +365) in 253 pts (140 males and 113 females) who underwent HSCT between 2008 and 2011 in our Center. Median age was 54 years (range 2-70). 109 pts had received alkylating agents (43.8%) and 39 radiotherapy (15.6%) before HSCT for the management of the disease. 37 pts had received a previous autologous HSTC. 88 (34,8%) HSCT were allogeneic (47 from family members and 41 unrelated donors). Cx consisted of: Mel 200 (76), BEAM (66), Flu-Mel (40), BEA (16), Cy-TBI (13), Flu-Bu (13), , Flu-Cy-TBI (9), TNI (4) and others (6). 47 pts received RIC regimens (18.6%). Sources of SC were peripheral blood (n=216), bone marrow (n=29) y cord blood (n=16). Results: Table 1 shows evolution of gonadotropins and sex hormones during de fi rst year post-SCT according to sex and age. Among the women between 10 and 40 years old, the estradiol levels were lower than they should be for their age in 32,2% (pre-HSCT), 40% (day +100), and 54,1% (day +365), although 15,78% showed later recovery. A single case of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism was found in a child with TBI. A 8 years old girl, without prior pubertal development, showed hormones levels consistent with menopause. Among the men aged over 50 years old testosterone levels descended in 13,8% of cases (5 over 60, 1 previous STC, 1 TBI) . Only three men between 17 and 50 years had descended levels (all over 40 and with previous alkylating agents). Conclusions: The most common hormonal alteration in our series was the hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. A high percentage of women developed premature menopause and irreversible ovarian failure. Age was a very important factor for the development of GF in women. Few women recovered gonadal function spontaneously. Among men, the most frequent pattern was the increase in LH with normal testosterone levels (compensated hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism). In our series, melphalan conditioning was a frequent cause of gonadal failure.",

Compared to pre-HSCT values, TSH increased signifi cantly in autologous HSTC, in patients previosuly treated with alkylating agents and in patients conditioned with Melphalan based regimens. Conclusion: Hypothyroidism was frequently seen during the post-HSCT period (28,5%). Conditioning regimens with highdose melphalan had an important effect on thyroid function. Changes in thyroid hormones were not observed in patients who received RIC regimens.",

Application of fertility preservation technics before HSCT in females with leukemia is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ovarian reserve in patients after HSCT with different conditioning regimens and to perform fertility preservation in young women with diminished ovarian reserve. Patients and Methods: Ovarian reserve (AMH, AFC) was evaluated in 35 females recipients of HSCT with myeloablative (busulfan-or melphalan-based) or nonmyeloablative (cyclophosphamide-based) conditioning regimens. Mean age at HSCT was 14.5 years (range 13-17), median age at time of the study was 21 years (range 17-24). Vitrifi cation of oocytes and embryos was performed by Cryotop method. Results: All pts who received busulfan-based conditioning regimen (n=12) had undetectable levels of AMH and ovarian failure, whereas pts who received melphalan-based conditioning (n=8) showed diminished ovarian reserve (AMH 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 ng/ ml, AFC 4.08 \u00b1 1.67). Ovarian reserve was normal in all (n=15) but one girl who received cyclophosphamide-based conditioning regimen; this pt developed prolonged GVHD and required long term immunosupressive therapy including steroids. Ovulation induction, OPU, vitrifi cation of oocytes was performed in 3 patients (2 -AML, 1 -AA). Mean number of retrieved/vitrifi ed oocytes was 5/4. Vitrifi cation of embryos (n=3) was performed in 1 patient with AML. Conclusion: Vitrifi cation of oocytes or embryos is feasible in young women after HSCT and can be regarded as a preferred fertility preservation method. Early planning of fertility preservation gives a chance to realize reproductive function in future in patients with diminished ovarian reserve.",

Hussein, A. Al-zaben, H. Abujazar, O. Alrawi, A. Saad, N. Hussein, F. Abdel-rahman King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, JO) Introduction: The risk of abnormal thyroid function after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well-known especially in pediatric patients. There are fewer studies about adult patients that showed 3-year cumulative incidence ranges between 8-23%. In our study we studied the incidence of abnormal thyroid function in patients older than 18 years, and reviewed the predicting factors for it. Patients and Method: This is a retrospective study for all adult patients who underwent HSCT at KHCC stem cell transplant program from 2007-2011. 138 fi le were reviewed, 30 of it were excluded because the patients had abnormal thyroid function before transplant, so our cohort consisted of 108 patients who had normal thyroid function before transplant. In our cohort 66% were males. Lymphoma & myeloma constituted 57.4%, Acute leukemia accounted for 24%, aplastic anemia for 5.6%. From the group 13.9% had more than one transplant, 54.8% had autologus transplant, 45.2% had allogenic transplant from which 94.6% had myeloablatibe transplant. The conditioning regimen was TBI-based in 29%. Results: With median follow up of 1.1 year, 34 patients (31%) developed abnormal thyroid function tests, high TSH accounted for 40.7%, low TSH for 38.9%, low T4 for 11.1%, with high TSH and low T4 for 3.7%. The predicting factors which showed signifi cant p value were: Gender: the incidence in the female group was 42.9%, compared to 24.2% in the male group (p 0.042) Type of transplant: the incidence in the allogenic group was 40.5% compared to 19.6% in the autologus group (p 0.027) TBI-based conditioning versus non-TBI: the incidence in the TBI group was 44.4% compared to 22.7% in non-TBI group (p 0.036). The disease category, number of transplants, and myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative were not predictors of the occurrence of abnormal thyroid function test. From the 34 patients who developed abnormal test after transplant, 61.7% of them developed this in the fi rst year post transplant, and 20.5% in the second year. Conclusion: The incidence of abnormal thyroid function after HSCT in our study is around 30%. The most common abnormalities are high or low TSH. Most of the abnormalities happened in the fi rst 2 years after transplant. Female gender, allogenic transplant, and TBI-based conditioning were associated with more occurrences of thyroid function abnormalities.",

Orofi no, M. Addari, M.B. Piludu, A. Piroddi, F. Rizzo Ospedale Microcitemico (Cagliari, IT) Bone mineral density (BMD) reduction is a known complication in thalassemia major and Allogenic Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Allo-HSCT). Several factors are implicated in bone mass reduction in thalassemia such us delayed sexual maturation, hypothyroidism, ineffective haemopoiesis with progressive marrow expansion. Therefore, these patients present osteoporosis or osteopenia at HSCT. In controlled studies calcium Vit D3 and bisphophonates (BI) have been used to prevent and cure severe bone loss following HSCT. To evaluate the safety and effi cacy of BI to cure bone loss and acute bone pain after HSCT,14 thalassemic major patients (7 M/7 F;age 5-25 yrs),who had undergone HSCT from matched unrelated and sibling donors between 2007-2010, were enrolled. BMD was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 months following HSCT,while bone metabolism by urinary C-telopeptide (C-T) of collagen type I and serum Osteocalcin (OC, alkaline phosfatase (bALP) levels, were evaluated at DEXA. Six-twelve months after transplant,four patients reported severe back and leg pain with motor diffi culties. In these patients, calcium and D3 vit was initiated at 6 months after transplant and sex hormone replacement therapy as soon as was possible. Therapy with cloridronate i.e. at 300 mg 3 times a week for 2 weeks and once a week for 4-5 weeks was also started. As soon as a decrease in pain was observed, intravenous neridronate therapy, 25 mg once a month for 2-3 yrs was initiated. The remaining 10 patients received 25 mg of neridronate i.e once a month for 2-3 yrs. Notable response to cloridronate and neridronate treatment was seen in all 4 patients with severe bone pain. A marked BMD increase was also observed in all 14 patients in the L1-L4 and femoral neck regions. The T-score range for adult patients and the Z-score range for child patients prior to osteoporosis treatment was > -2.5-5.5 DS and following therapy -1.5 -0.5 DS, P value 0.004. No statistical differences prior to or after BI treatment in OC, bALP, C-T levels; P value 0,11 were observed .Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that BMD reduction in the L1-L4 and femoral neck regions is common in thalassemic transplantation patients. Cloridronate was found be safe and effective in the management of bone pain resulting from osteoporosis and Neridronate was highly effective in increasing BMD and decreasing severe osteoporosis in the post transplantation period.",

One patient has lost >3 cm in length; one man experienced an elbow fracture; one man and one woman got unilateral aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. Four patients with the lowest Z-score at the total hip had also the lowest Z-score at the femoral neck. Values of studied hormones are showed in Table 2 . An elevated level of plasma PTH was disclosed in 6 of 20 (30%) patients. One patient had hypercalcemia due to parathyroid adenoma; in 5 patients there was no clear explanation for the PTH elevation. A low value of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (<45 nmol/L) was seen in 9 of 20 (45%) patients. Three of 6 patients with elevated PTH concentrations had low vitamin D values. All women received estrogen replacement therapy after allo-SCT until expected age of menopause. One man received testosterone; 4 other men had testosterone below the lower normal limit. Elevated FSH values were present in 8 men. All but one patient showed normal values of the thyroid tests. Three patients had IGF-1 values below the lower limit of the reference range. Conclusions: Adult long-term survivors of allo-SCT have relatively well preserved BMD 10-15 years after allo-SCT. Prophylactic treatment of osteopenia should be individualized, but control of BMD is necessary as a part of follow-up. Low levels of vitamin D and hyperparathyroidism were common. Control of PTH and vitamin D levels before and after allo-SCT is recommended and vitamin D supplementation should be considered if indicated.",

Major blood group incompatibility (patient A Rh positive, donor O positive) represented a risk of haemolytic anaemia. Engraftment was uneventful and cutaneous GvHD grade I developed one month later. Chimerism was of 100% donor origin. The patient developed a mild renal thrombotic microangiopathy associated with renal failure and severe haemolytic anaemia that was treated with corticosteroids. Persisting A/O Rh positive blood group was observed using monoclonal gel method (Diaclon ABO/D Bio-Rad) due to A and O blood transfusion after allo-HSCT. At 22",

Blood group determination was repeated after washing the red blood cells with NaCl 0.9% and proceeding with enzymatic digestion with papaine that result in the donor's O Rh positive blood group. Conclusion: Blood group determination is an important analysis in the follow up of patients after HSCT, predicting relapse and, in case of differences of blood groups between donor and recipient, haemolytic anaemia. Our case shows technical diffi culties of blood group determination of unknown reaction in a dysimmune status probably due to presence of high titer of auto-(or allo-) antibodies. Transplant physicians should be aware of such complications and be in closed contact with the immuno-hematology laboratory to be able to determine the real group and adapt treatment strategy.",

Sucak, S.Z. Aki, E. Suyani, Z.A. Yegin, O.T. Pasaoglu, U. Bagriacik, H. Pasaoglu Gazi University Faculty of Medicine (Ankara, TR) In recent years clinical and laboratory fi ndings of metabolic syndrome (MS) with an incidence of 25-49% have been reported in adult and pediatric long term survivors of HSCT. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and MS in long term survivors of HSCT.A total of 83 HSCT recipients (39 autologous, 44 allogeneic; median age 33 years, range 16-64) who survived \u2265 1 year after HSCT were included in the study. Patients were median 3 years (range 1-7 years) status post HSCT. Nineteen of forty four patients (43.8%) of allogeneic HSCT recipients had chronic GVHD during enrollement. The conditioning regimen included total body irradiation in 11 out of 44 (13.3%) recipients while it was non-myeloablative in 13 out of 44 (29.54%) allogeneic HSCT recipients. MS was diagnosed",

IGT was detected in 9/39 (23.07%) of autologous and 6/44 (13.63%) of allogeneic HSCT recipients. IGT was more frequent in patients with MS compared to ones without MS (5 out of 15 patients with MS vs 9 out of 68 patients without MS) (p=0.06). Median age of patients with MS was 43 years (range 31-60) while it was 28 years (range 16-64) in patients without MS (p=0.002). Four of the 14 patients with MS and 10 out of 69 patients without MS had active underlying disease (p=0.241) during the time of evaluation. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha, ESR, CRP in patients with and without MS did not show a signifi cant difference (p>0.05). Plasma adiponectin levels were signifi cantly higher in patients with MS (p=0.019). However plasma leptin levels were signifi cantly lower in patients with MS (p=0.013). Plasma endothelin-1, IGF-1, and iron parameters were similar in patient with and without MS (p>0.05). Median plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were signifi cantly higher in women than men (p<0.05). Conclusion: Prevalence of MS in adult Turkish population was reported as 26-28%. The frequency of MS is relatively lower than the previous reports which might be due to the shorter follow-up time. Chronic GVHD and immunosuppressive treatment was present in a signifi cant proportion of our allogeneic HSCT recipients including the 2 patients with MS. Altered adipocytokine levels and IGT seems to play role in the development of MS. Our results should be validated with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up.",

Ozcan Ankara University (Ankara, TR) The oral cavity is one of the most affected organs of cGvHD. In this retrospective study, we aimed to present our experience on the incidence and risk factors oral cavity cGvHD. Patients and Methods: Total 503 patients underwent allo-HCT between Jan 2000 and Dec 2010. We observed cGvHD in 226 patients (55.8%) surviving more than 100 days after the transplantation (n=405). Oral cavity cGVHD was seen in 74 out (32.7%) of the patients with cGVHD. But we retrospectively evaluated only 64 patients (31M; 33F) deve loping oral cavity cGvHD with acceptable data. Median age was 38 years (range: 14-57 ys). Using the NIH assessment criteria oral chronic GVHD was scored as mild, moderate and severe. Results: The distributions of severity of oral cavity cGVHD were 28.1% mild (n=18), 42.2% moderate (n=27) and 29.7% (n=19) severe as the scoring system at median 6.2 months from the transplantation. In two patients oral cavity GvHD developed as a part of acute GvHD and progressed to cGVHD. Isolated oral cavity cGVHD was seen in only two patients. Oral cavity GvHD developed in 20.3% of the patients prior to systemic extensive GvHD. In our cohort analysis, 53.1% of the patients had a history of smoking prior to transplantation. In univariate analysis we did not observe any preand postransplantation risk factors on severity of oral cavity GvHD (Table) . Most of the patients required systemic immunosuppressive treatment with topical agents. We observed that oral cavity cGVHD improved in only three patients with only topical treatment. Conclusion: Isolated oral cavity involvement may predict the development of extensive GvHD. Therefore, we should determine in which patients require systemic immunosuppressive treatment or not. In addition, large-well design comparative studies needed to evaluate the risk factors of the development and severity of oral cavity cGVHD.",

Methods: Phase IV, open-label, multicenter trial. Main eligibility criteria: age \u226518 years old, SCT at least 6 months before inclusion, transfusional iron overload (serum ferritin (SF) \u22651000 ng/mL or >20 units red blood cell transfusions), serum creatinine (SCr) \u22642-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min. Treatment regimen consisted of 10 mg/Kg/day of deferasirox 52 weeks or until SF\u2264400 ng/mL; subsequent adjustments were based on SF levels and safety markers. Primary objective was to assess the reduction of SF after 52 weeks of treatment. Results: From December 2008 to April 2010, 30 pts were enrolled in 18 centers. Median age was 46 years (range 20-65). Underlying primary diseases included acute myeloid leukemia (n=17), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=6) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=5). Pts had received the SCT a median of 12.3 months before deferasirox initiation (range 5.9-39.2). At week 52 there was a signifi cant reduction in median SF from baseline (by LOCF: -670 ng/mL; p<0.05). Median SF (range) at baseline was 1444 ng/mL (788-4055; n=30) , and at week 52 was 756 ng/ mL (96-7326; n=30 LOCF). Liver iron concentration (LIC) was assessed by MRI (gradient echo sequences). At week 52 there was a signifi cant reduction in median LIC (-8.9 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw); p<0.05). Median LIC at baseline was 13.4 mg/g (range 5.6-19.0; n=12) and after 52 weeks was 4.6 mg/g (range 0. 0-12.3; n=8) . Eight pts completed the study after achieving SF\u2264400 ng/mL before week 52. Eight pts discontinued the study prematurely due to: disease progression (n=3), death (n=2), consent withdrawal, SCr increase (<2xULN) and unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Most common investigator-assessed drug-related AEs were gastro intestinal events (n=4 pts,1 3.3%), SCr increase (<2xULN) (n=4 pts,13.3%) and increased transaminases (n=2 pts, 6.7%). Nine Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 8 pts: 3 primary disease progressions, 1 febrile neutropenia, 1 herpes zoster, 1 fever with rhinorrhea, 1 leuko cytosis, 1 massive acute subdural hematoma and 1 febrile syndrome; none of them considered to be related to deferasirox. Conclusion: Deferasirox provided signifi cant reduction in SF levels and LIC over 1-yr treatment in patients post allogeneic SCT, with a safety profi le similar to that reported in previous studies.",

Bacigalupo (2) (1)Centro Microcitemie Ospedale Galliera (Genoa, IT); (2) IRCCS S.Martino's Hospital (Genoa, IT) Aim of the Study: We evaluated liver iron overload (LIO) in 77 patients who underwent an allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), because of haematologic malignancies. Patients: The patients were considered eligible for iron overload evaluation, if they had a positive history of transfusional and a serum ferritin (SF) level > 500 ng/ml. Iron overload was assessed by Biosuscettometry Magnetic Iron Detector (MID) and expressed as grams of iron in the whole liver: our current cut-offs are as follows; <1gr no LIO detectable, 1-3 gr mild LIO; >3 g high LIO. Stiffness was assessed by Fibro-scan\u00ae and converted in Metavir hepatic fi brosis score. Results: 25 patients had undetecable LIO with median SF 1413 ng/ml (507-5000), median stiffness 6.3 KPa (3.7-11) equal to metavir F0-F1. 30 patients (38%) and had mild LIO with median SF 2015 ng/ml (576-4288) and median stiffness 5.85KPa (3.8-9) equal to metavir F0-1. 22 patients (28%) had high LIO with median SF 4311 ng/ml (537-5000) equal to metavir F0-F1and median stiffness 9.5 KPa (3.8-14) equal to metavir F2. Patients with undectable LIO had a transfusional intake <25 RBCU (8-24), patients with mild and high LIO had a transfusional intake >25 RBCU (25-85). We then stratifi ed patients for time from SCT in 3 groups: less than 6 months, 6-214 months, over 2 years. The Stiffness and LIO were similar in the 3 groups; there was a modest decrease in ferritin levels, from a median of 3513 (<6 months) to 2000 (>2 years), In conclusion liver iron overload is present in a high percentage of patients (66% -moderate or severe-) following SCT. Iron overload does not seem to decrease with time. This result calls for appropriate chelating treatment post-SCT.",

Few studies have analyzed iron depletion strategies in alloHSCT patients. This retrospective study aimed to assess the feasibility and effi cacy of therapeutic phlebotomy in allo-HSCT recipients. Chart review was performed for all patients from our centre who were included in a phlebotomy program between january 2005 and january 2011. During the study period, 23 allo-HSCT patients (78 % male) were treated by regular phlebotomy. Initial disease was acute leukemia in 16 patients (70%). Ten patients (44%) were transplanted with an HLA-identical sibling donor. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 14 (61%) patients. The median age at time of phlebotomy initiation was 46 (26-67) years and the median time elapsed from transplantation to the fi rst phlebo tomy was 7 (1.6-196) months. Notably, 11 patients (47 %) started therapy within the fi rst 6 months post-transplantation. All patients were transfusion independent at time of therapy initiation.",

In total, a median of 4.8 L (range, 0.9-23.8) of whole blood was removed from each patient. The median ferritin level was 1949 (range, 720-5536) ug/l before phlebotomy initiation compared to 467 (89-2051) ug/l after completion of the program (p<0.001). Interestingly, patients who completed the program exhibited signifi cantly improved liver function tests, as shown in Table 1 . Overall, phlebotomies were well tolerated and no adverse events were recorded during or after blood collection. Our study shows that phlebotomy is a safe and effective method for reducing iron overload in allo-HSCT recipients, and in that respect, it should be considered the treatment of choice because of its low-cost. In patients with persistent anemia, notably in the early post-transplant period when the risk of ironoverload related complications is relatively high, the use of an ESA should be considered since it may substantially facilitate phlebotomy.",

Saleemi, M. Khan, B. Khan, M. Bakr, A. Mobeireek, F. Almohareb, N. Chaudhri King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (Riyadh, SA) Introduction: Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) is a signifi cant and serious late complication in HSCT recipients. It affects 6-10% of post-HSCT patients with overall survival of only 13% at 5 years. The etiology of BOS is poorly understood and is believed to be heterogeneous with multiple factors infl uencing its pathogenesis and progression. Most commonly accepted view is an immunological theory which involves lymphocyte mediated infl ammatory and fi brotic process that affects the epithelium and sub-epithelium of the airways, leading to narrowing and airfl ow limitation. Recent data is emerging to refl ect an association of BOS with gastro esophageal refl ux disease (GERD) mainly in post lung transplant patient. There are no studies on post-HSCT patients with BOS and its association with GERD.",

Total acid exposure time, using pH values of 4.0 or below in the distal esophagus, was used to quantify refl ux. A DeMeester score (normal value < 14.72) was also calculated for each patient for day 1, day 2. Results: Six out of seven patients completed BRAVO pH study for 48 hours while one patient recorded only for 12 hours due to technical failure. Five patients, four males and one female, with a mean age of 34.2 years were reported to have positive acid refl ux study. Three patients had severe while two had mild refl ux. Transient dysphagia and/or chest discomfort were reported by 3 patients. Conclusion: The above study suggests that GERD is a possible contributing factor for BOS and/or its progression in post HSCT patients. Larger studies are needed to confi rm these fi ndings. Our study may help in future management of BOS patients post allogeneic HSCT with aggressive anti GERD therapy including gastric fundoplication as a benefi cial response of aggressive anti GERD therapy has been documented in post lung transplant patients with BOS.",

Overall, 4/11 patients obtained a partial response after steroids alone or combined with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil. The remaining 7 patients were unresponsive to salvage treatments; six of them died at a median of 6,5 months after the diagnosis of LONIPCs due to respiratory failure or infections. Two-year TRM cumulative incidence was signifi cantly higher in LONIPC than in non-LONIPC patients (64% vs. 23%, p=0.006). However, since 2-year relapse incidence was signifi cantly lower in LONIPC than in non-LONIPC patients (0% vs. 43%, p=0.002), we couldn't observe any signifi cant difference in OS. Univariate analysis showed that GvHD prophylaxis with ATG is a protective factor (0.17, p=0.03) , while moderate to severe chronic GvHD is a strong signifi cant risk factor for LONIPCs (R 16.9, p=0.008) and is the only signifi cative factor in multivariate analysis. PFTs before transplant did not differ between the 2 groups. However, FEV1 and FVC values signifi cantly differed since the 3th month after HSCT and through the fi rst year of transplant between LONIPCs and non-LONIPCs patients (p<0.007 and p<0.008, respectively). DLCO values had a trend to become lower in LONIPCs patients in comparison with unaffected ones only at 12 months after HSCT (p=0.06). We conclude that the development of LONIPCs after RIC HSCT signifi cantly increased TRM and was strongly associated with moderate and severe chronic GVHD. This complication could be prevented by the administration of ATG before HSCT and by periodical PFTs through the fi rst year after transplant.",

Miyamura Japasese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital (Aichi, Nagoya, JP) Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the common complications following allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT). However, there have been few detailed clinicopathological investigations of CKD after allo SCT. Purpose: To investigate the clinicopathological features of treatment-related injury to renal tissue, and to investigate glomerular changes associated with immunological abnormality. Methods: We performed clinicopathological analysis of 10 patients who had undergone renal biopsy in our institution between 2003 and 2010 for CKD post allo SCT. Results: Median age at SCT was 36.5. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative for 7 cases and non-myeloablative for 3 cases. GVHD prophylaxis was FK/CyA base for 6/4 cases, respectively. Renal biopsies were conducted at a median of 591 days (range 226 to 4995 days) after allo SCT. Indications for renal biopsy included decreased eGFR (7 cases), proteinuria and edema (7), or both (4) . The treatment-related renal tissue damage, mainly ischemic changes were seen in most of the cases. The median period of calcineurin inhibitor administration was 711.5 days (56-4995). There were correlations between the total period of calcineurin inhibitor administration and the calcineurin inhibitor toxicity score (CNIT score) consisting of pathological tubular and inter stitial changes and glomerular changes. Five of 10 cases had glomerular fi ndings associated with immunological abnormalities (3 membranous nephritis, 1 focal segmental glomerulonephritis, and 1 minimal change nephrotic syndrome). They received immunosuppressive therapy and two had developed brochiolitis obliterance. Clinical nephrotic syndrome had occurred not only in these fi ve cases showing specifi c changes in glomeruli, but also in other cases which had severe renal tissue injury. Conclusion: The total period of calcineurin inhibitor administration correlated with the severity of pathological renal impairment. Glomerular diseases associated with immunological abnormalities occurred post allo SCT, and responded well to immunosuppressive therapy. In nephrotic syndrome, renal biopsy may be useful to determine whether to use immunosuppressive therapy.",

Di Donato (2) Objectives: Hemoragic Cystitis (HC) is a common cause of morbidity and extended hospitalization after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Many therapies have been investigated to prevent or treat HC (mesna, hyperhydratation, ciprofl oxacin, antiviral agents, prostaglandin, etc.) based on multifactorial ethio-pathogenesis, but effective treatment is still indeterminate. While the effi cacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT) has been established for HC due to chemotherapy and/ or radiation therapy, its role in HC occurring after transplant has yet to be defi ned. We report our single center experience with HOT in late onset grade II-III HC after HSCT. Methods: HC was defi ned as the presence of persistent gross hematuria and symptoms of bladder irritability without urinary tract infection. A preventive treatment with prehydration and mesna has been administered in patients (pts) receiving cyclophosphamide. HOT has been associated with a concomitant treatment with oral oxybutynin, hyperhydratation and/or irrigation of the bladder through catheter. Cidofovir has been administered based on demonstration of viral infection. Treatment with HOT consisted of breathing 100%O2 for 75 minutes total in the hyperbaric chamber (3 cycles of 25 min each with 3 min break) to the absolute pressure of 2.5 atmospheres with a minimum of eight sessions. The resolution of the HC was defi ned as hematuria disappearance within 7 days from the stop therapy. Results: During the period 2005 HSCT have been performed c/o our institution in 158 pediatric pts. Ten pts out of 186 (6%) developed grade II-III HC. Clinical and transplant features have been summarized in Table 1 . HC developed in the median day+26 (range:+20;+47) after the HSCT. HOT was started in the median day+31 (range: +20;+56). After a median of 10 sessions (range:8-30) 7/10 pts (70%) achieved a complete remission (CR). The procedure was well tolerated. No pts died for HC. Two children did not benefi t from HOT: one needed a cistostomy and the other interrupted HOT after 26 sessions because of no response. Conclusions: HOT is a well tolerated procedure also in the paediatric setting. To date, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of HC. Our data show that the precocious beginning of HOT might be effective in the treatment of HC offering advantages in terms of prognosis, potential sequelae and resolution of hospitalization. Each patient needed of a variable number of sessions to reduce symptoms.",

Borovkova, M. Tretyakova, S. Razumova, T. Bykova, A. Gudkova, L. Zubarovskaya, B. Afanasyev R.Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of children hematology and transplantation (RU) Background: Allogeniec haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is the treatment of choice in patients (pts) with different hematological and inherited diseases. Increasing numbers of alloHSCT are being performed annually with a greater number of long-term survivors. There is increasing concern regarding the late complications and long-term effects that are secondary to performed therapy. Recipients experience mortality rates higher than the general population and the risk of premature cardiovascular death is increased 2.3-fold compared with the general population. One of leading cause is development metabolic syndrome with activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The Aim of this Study: To study cardiac function in pts after alloHSCT, investigate RAAS as a marker of myocardial fi brosis. Patients: After alloHSCT 20 pts were under investigation (12boys, 8-girls) with follow-up 4-12 year (median -7,8+ 2.2 y). At the moment of alloHSCT age of patients was 2-15.6 yo (median 8.4+3.2). Type of diagnosis: ALL-11 (55%), AML-5 (25%), CML-3 (15%), MDS -1 (5%) pts. Routinely ECG, echocardiography, the level of aldosterone and rennin were performed. Results: All pts did not have any signs of heart failure and any structural changes in myocardium: ejection fraction (EF) was 50-75% (median 61.5+7.6%). But boundary values EF (50-53%) were revealed in 2 pts (10%), 8 pts (40%) had hypertension in pulmonary artery. The level of renin and aldosterone were higher in transplanted pts than in the control group: 1.07 vs 0.32 ng/ml*h, 106.0 vs 41.2 pg/ml*h, respectively. These changes were correlated with period of follow-up after alloHSCT. In pts with long-term follow-up hormone levels was higher than the others. Conclusion: There were not signs of cardiac dysfunction by clinical date, ECG, echocardiography up to 8 years after alloHSCT. But activation of RAAS was found as possible marker of initial structural damage of heard. Monitoring will determine participation of RAAS in pathogenesis of myocardium damage after alloHSCT and develop protocols for support of cardiac dysfunction in initial subclinical stage.",

Gerull, T. Lehmann, J.R. Passweg, A. Tichelli University Hospital (Basel, CH) Objectives: Howell Jolly bodies (HJB) are nuclear fragments within the red blood cells that are normally removed by the spleen. The appearance of HJB in the peripheral blood smear is the most characteristic abnormality after splenectomy or in patients with functional asplenia and can be used as surrogate marker of hyposplenism. We observed in a number of patients following allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) HJB in the blood smear. We hypothesize, that patients with chronic Graft versus Host disease (cGvHD) have a high prevalence of functional hyposplenism, and are therefore at risk for severe infections. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of all outpatients seen between 1.7.2009 and 30.6 .2011 following autologous or allogeneic HSCT at our Transplantation Center. Patients with surgical splenectomy were excluded. The total number of patients included into the study was 511. There were 389 (76%) patients treated with allogeneic, and 122 (24%) with autologous HSCT, with a median follow up after HSCT of 72 months (range, . Patients with HJB after allogeneic HSZT were compared with those without HJB, using a univariate and multivariate analysis (logistical regression). The patients' characteristics are shown on Table 1 . Results: 63/511 patients presented HJB in their blood smear during the study period. The probability of fi nding HJB was signifi cantly higher (p<0.0001) in patients following allogeneic HSCT (61;97%) than in patients following autologous HSCT (2;3%). Due to the low number of patients with HJB after autologous HSCT, the subsequent analysis was resricted to patients after allogeneic HSCT only. 87% of the patients with HJB had cGvHD compared to 59% of the patients without HJB (p<0.0001). Furthermore, patients conditioned with TBI, those who received peripheral blood stem cells (instead of BM), and male patients had signifi cantly more often HJB (Table 2 ). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of cGVHD (RR, 7.04; 95%CI p<0.0001), TBI (RR, 2.185; 95%CI, p=0 .020) and male recipients (RR2.517; p=0.012) were associated with a higher probability of HJB. Conclusion: Chronic GvHD is the most important independent risk factor for the development of hyposplenism after allogeneic HSCT and is only rarely observed after autologous HSCT. The clinical relevance of these fi ndings and the consequences in the management of transplanted patients will be discussed.",

On day +25 the pt showed a diffuse skin rash treated with steroid therapy. CSA was the only immunosuppressive drug after the fi rst 100 days from ABMT and was tapered to suspension for neurological toxicity (tremor). For the persistence of the tremor during the week of suspension, the pt underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and lumbar puncture, which were negative. Cerebrospinal fl uid was analyzed and the PCR for BKV, JCV, CMV, EBV, HSV 1-2 was negative. For appearance of skin rash, the CSA was restored (50 mg/daily) in association with steroid therapy. On day +264, the pt exposed herself to sun and heat (outside temperature of 29 \u00b0C) showing of headache, mental confusion, aphasia, generalized seizures and only an episode of high temperature (39\u00b0C). The EEG showed diffuse slow activity (theta-delta) mainly in the frontal lobe. The MRI of the brain showed bilateral perivascular white matter low density lesions in parieto-occipital lobes. It was the diagnosis of PRES. We withdrew CSA and the pt showed the disappearance of neurological symptoms within 36 hours. MRI control performed after one month was completely negative. Conclusion: We suppose in this case that the PRES has been triggered by the combination of effects on cerebral vessels by CSA, by the exposure to heat and by the consequent hyperthermia. O.

K\u00fcrek\u00e7i Gulhane Military Medical Faculty (Ankara, TR) Occurrence of transverse myelitis during or following varicella infection is uncommon. No diagnostic test is completely accurate, since varicella zoster (VZV) can not usually be isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) in VZV myelitis. We describe a case of transverse myelitis in a patient with thalassemia major, during a proven VZV infection following hematopioetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A 16-year-old girl with thalassemia major underwent HSCT from her full matched brother. Full engraftment was achieved after partial splenic arterial embolization and second transplantion because of the fi rst graft failure. Acyclovir prophylaxis were given in the early post-transplantation period. She was transfusion-independent with full single-donor chimerism and with good health condition after 7 months of the second transplant, until she had presented in February 2011 with low back pain, paresthesia and weakness in both legs, a painful itchy vesicular eruption in her lumbosacral area and urinary incontinence. Neurologic examination revealed normal levels of cooperation, orientation and intact cranial nerves. The patient exhibited 2/5 lower extremity weakness on the right and 3/5 on the left, absent abdominal refl exes below the level of T2 dermatom. Her gait was markedly ataxic. Deep tendon refl exes were normal in the upper extremities, but decreased in the lower extremities. Babinski sign was bilateral positive. CSF was positive for VZV PCR. Spinal cord MRI at the time showed intramedullary lesions of high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences between the T2 and L1 levels, fi ndings which are consistent with myelitis. The patient was diagnosed with transverse myelitis, but despite the treatment with acyclovir, methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, hyperbaric oxygen and physical therapy there is no improvement in her situation. There is no consensus on the dose, duration and type of the antiviral prophylaxis after HSCT, but it is known that antiviral prophylaxis is effective at delaying the onset of VZV after HSCT, but not affect the overall incidence of infection. Further studies are needed to show whether more prolonged prophylaxis, given until effective cellular immunity is re-established, can further reduce or even totally abrogate excess susceptibility to VZV reactivation.",

Krasowska-Kwiecien, O. Wiecha, W. Czogala, K. Sztefko, J. Starzyk, M. Siedlar Jagiellonian University (Krakow, PL) Background: Metabolic syndrome (MS) incidence in patients treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is higher than in general population and similar to that found in obese people. The most important consequence of MS is low-level systemic infl ammation supported by adipose-specifi c synthesis of proinfl ammatory soluble molecules. Hormones from adipose tissue are also strongly involved in MS development. The purpose of the study was to determine concentration of chosen peptides secreted from adipose tissue in children treated with HSCT. Patients and Methods: Nine patients (pts.) 3,3-17,8 (average 10,6) years old, 6 boys and 3 girls, diagnosed with AA-3, ALL-4, CGD-2 treated with HSCT according to EBMT protocols were included to the study. The control group was composed of 9 children 3,6-14,6 (average 10,7) years old, 6 boys and 3 girls with obesity. The blood was collected in fasting state, and at 60 and 120 minutes during oral glucose tolerance test. The HSCT children were studied before and after HSCT (mean 9 months), the control group was tested once. There were no signs and symptoms of the primary disease in children after HSCT, all of them completed immunosuppressive treatment. Plasma levels of resistin, apelin, visfatin, adiponectin, leptin and leptin soluble receptor were measured using commercially available EIA kits. Results: BMI before HSCT was 12, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] 4 (average 19, 7) , BMI Z-score -2,88-2,05 (average 0,1). BMI after HSCT was 13, 9-28 (average 20,4) , BMI Z-score -1,2-2,01 (average 0,35) . BMI in the obesity group was 21,8-36,4 (average 29), BMI Z-score 1,57-3,9 (average 2,3) . The only signifi cant difference was increase in mean apelin concentrations in fasting state and 60 min after glucose intake comparing to mean concentrations before HSCT. The same relationship were noticed compering obesity group and children before HSCT in third time point (120 min. after glucose intake). Conclusion: As apelin is strongly involved in development of MS due to its role in decreasing insulin secretion, downregulation of catecholamine-mediated lipolysis and insulin resistance, it is possible that increased concentrations of apelin observed in children after HSCT may be a reason of higher incidence of MS in patients treated with HSCT.

Remission induction was achieved by 2 cycles of chemotherapy with ADE, followed by consolidation treatment with HDAC. Stem cell mobilization was performed by chemotherapy and G-CSF, including VP-16 2 g/m 2 and G-CSF in the fi rst patient and HDAC and G-CSF in the second which resulted in poor mobilization and insuffi cient graft. BM was chosen as source instead. Both cases received Bu-Cy conditioning and PBSC as source in one patient 2,8x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells and the other patient received cryopreserved BM with 3,2x10 8 /kg mononuclear cells. Engraftment was registered after day +12 in the PBSC patient and on day +17 in BM patient. Both patients were followed by an outpatient basis during 3 years after transplant. Disease relapse was registered after 12 years in the fi rst case and after 7 years in the second case. Flowcytometry revealed no change in the leukemia initial immunophenotype which ruled out the possibility for \"de novo\" AML. Conclusion: The mortality rates of AML patients who receive an autologous HCT and stay in remission for 2-years are similar to that of the general population. However, late effects of transplantation such as second cancers and other organ specifi c late complications can take many years to develop and studies that include an adequate number of very long-term survivors are still needed to realize the complete risks and impact of late mortality following autologous HCT for AML. Also the possibility of late relapse of the same malignancy should not be underestimated which opens the questions of how long do we need to follow up transplant survivors.",

Kata, S. Kyrcz-Krzemien, G. Helbig, M. Markiewicz, M. Kopera, A. Waclawik, J. Korzenski, K. Torba, M. Misiek Medical University of Silesia (Katowice, PL) Introduction: Isolated extramedullary relapses (IEMR) are increasingly reported as long-term complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the optimal treatment strategies for IEMR following alloHSCT remain uncertain. Aims and Methods: We retrospectively analysed incidence, clinical features, treatment options and long-term outcome of this pattern of leukemia recurrence in a group of 459 consecutive patients (pts) (169 with ALL, 290 with AML) who underwent alloHSCT in our institution between June 1993 and June 2010. 78 pts (36 with ALL, 42 with AML) relapsed (any site). RESULTS. 12 (15%) out of all pts who relapsed (4 with highrisk B-line ALL, 1 with T-line ALL, 7 with AML, F/M 7/5, median age 35 years, range 28 -54 years) developed histologically proven IEMR after a median time of 14 months (mts) (range, 6 -80 mts) following alloHSCT. 5 pts (3 with ALL, 2 with AML) developed skin and/or subcutaneous tissue infi ltrates. Other sites of IEMR included (No. of cases/diagnosis): leptomeninges of the brain (1/ Ph+ ALL), paraspinal soft tissues (1/AML), small intestine (1/AML), lymph nodes (1/AML), paranasal sinuses (1/AML), pleura (1/ALL), breast (1/AML). Treatment plans for those IEMR included (No. of cases/diagnosis): 1/involvedfi eld radiotherapy (IF-RT) followed by chemotherapy (CHT) and interferon-alpha (2/ ALL), 2/ imatinib + CHT + steroids and methotrexate intrathecally (1/ ALL), 3/ imatinib + CHT (1/ ALL), 4/ CHT (2/ AML, 2/ALL), 5/ dasatinib (1/ CD117+ AML), 6/surgery (1/AML), 7/ CHT and secondary alloHSCT (2/AML). 8/12 pts died after a median time of 13,5 mts (range, 1 -30 mts) due to resistant systemic relapse and/or infectious complications, 4/12 pts are currently under CHT or after secondary alloHSCT.",

Sites of relapses vary widely among the pts, however, in most of them leukemic infi ltrates are localized outside the well-defi ned sanctuaries (central nervous system or testis), predominantly within the skin and/or subcutaneous tissue. IF-RT seems to be effective initial treatment option, but it does not prevent from systemic relapse and should be followed by other therapeutic modalities. Due to the lack of effi cacious treatment strategies, there is a need for novel approaches to manage IEMR after alloHSCT.",

Salmenniemi, M. It\u00e4l\u00e4-Remes Turku University Hospital (Turku, FI) A risk of secondary (sec) malignancies increases after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We analyzed posttransplant malignancies in 370 allogeneic HCT recipients (335 adults/35 children) transplanted at Turku University Hospital in years 1981 to 2011. We found 16 (4.8%) adult patients with 19 sec malignancies and one child with lymphoma. Median age at transplant was 38 years. The indications for HCT were: acute myeloid leukemia 7, chronic leukemia 3, aplastic anemia 2, lymphoma 2, multiple myeloma 2, myelodysblastic syndrome (MDS) 1. Secondary malignancies (n=20): The areas of sec malignancies were: head-neck-mouth 7 patients (35% of malignancies), gastrointestinal tract 5 (25%), lungs 3 (15%), and one of each in mammae, prostata, gynaecological, MDS and carsinoma (ca) in situ abdominis. 35% of all were squamocellular-cas. One adult had four different malignancies post HCT. The median time from transplant to diagnosis of malignancy was 6.8 (0.6-18.2) years. Ten patients (63%) died of the sec malignancy with a median of 1.5 (week-10.3 years) years from the diagnosis. The sec malignancy was the primary cause of death in 6% of all posttransplant deaths. A sec malignancy occurs most often after one year from HCT. In our cohort there were 221 patients (60%) who had survived longer than one year from HCT. Of them, 78% had received myeloablative (MA) conditioning and 22% reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), and in these groups 12 (7%) and 2 (4%) patients, respectively, had developed a sec malignancy. With regard to occurrence of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), 19% of patients had extensive cGVHD and 81% had it not, and the respective fi gures for sec malignancies were 7 (16%) and 7 (3.9%), respectively. In conclusion, we found 17 patients (5%) out of 370 transplanted patients with a sec malignancy, and 14 patients (6%) in patients surviving more than one year posttransplant. A sec malignancy was the primary cause of death in 6% of all posttransplant mortality. The risk of sec malignancy was 8.8 times higher than that in the general Finnish population. The size of our transplant cohort is relatively small but it seems that there is a relationship between extensive cGVHD and malignancy. On the contrary, the impact of myeloablative conditioning vs RIC on occurrence of sec malignancy was not evident.",

We reviewed our series of ASCT patients retrospectively to assess late toxicity and effi cacy. Patients and Methods: From November 2001 to November 2011, 77 ASCT were performed to 73 patients for hematologic malignancies, 50 male and 27 female of median age 48.5 years (23-69). Primary diagnoses included 33 multiple myeloma (MM), 21 non hodgkin lymphoma(9 DLCBL,8 follicular lymphoma (FL), 1 anaplastic lymphoma and 3 peripheral T cell lymphoma), 17 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 4 acute leukemia (3 myeloid,1 lymphoblastic) and 2 amyloidosis. 41.5% patients received a transplantation in complete remission, 50.6% in partial remission and 7.8% were refractory. 61% of them in fi rst line and the rest as salvage therapy. PBSC (peripheral blood stem cell) mobilization was performed with G-CSF in 41 and G-CSF + chemotherapy in 36 cases. The conditioning regimen was melphalan 200 for MM, escalated CBV and BEAM for lymphoma, BEA for AML and BUCY2 for ALL.Ten patients received radiotherapy before and 5 after ASCT. Median number of chemotherapy regimens before transplant was 1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Results: Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 8.5 months (m.Early TRM was 1.3%. With a median follow up of 62.5 m (0.25-121) 72.8% of patients are alive and 54.5% without progression. Late mortality was 25.9% and the main cause of death was relapse (95%); NRM was 1.3%: one patient suffered a sudden death of cardiac origin. Median time to death was 20 months . Two patients (2.6%) has developed secondary solid tumors: 1 colon cancer and 1 testicular cancer. One patient has a myelodysplastic syndrome (1.3%). The 5 years OS (overall survival) and PFS (progression free survival) for MM was 72.7% and 56.5%, for DLBCL 66.7% and 77.8%, for FL 62.5% and 50% and for HL 64.7% and 35.3%. Conclusion: ASCT is a safe procedure in our experience, with a low early TRM (1.3%). Relapse was the main cause of mortality (24.7%). NRM was also low (1.3%). We have not found a high incidence of secondary MDS/AML (1.3%) or solid tumors (2.6%), may be because of a relatively short follow-up and a cohort of patients not heavily pretreated.",

Szer Royal Melbourne Hospital (Melbourne, AU) Introduction: Prior to the widespread availability of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), this disease was the commonest indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (BMT). The majority of patients (pts) treated with BMT were apparently cured. The observation that some relapses occurred late after BMT prompted a review of these pts to identify their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Patients and Methods: 157 consecutive pts undergoing BMT for CML between 1986 and 2002 were evaluated and eligible pts were those who survived at least 2 years and then relapsed with CML. Patient characteristics and post-transplant events were identifi ed from the databases of the units and detailed chart reviews. No pts were excluded from the analyses. At the time of transplant, 15 pts were in fi rst chronic phase, and 4 were in accelerated phase, with a median age of 40 (range 19-55 years). Conditioning regimens were BuCy (n=13), CyTBI (n=4), FluMel (n=1) and BuMel (n=1). Donor types included sibling (n=17), matched unrelated (n=1) and one antigen mismatched family member (n=1), with stem cell sources of bone marrow (n=18) and peripheral blood (n=1). Graft versus host disease prophylaxis for all pts was with cyclosporin and methotrexate . Results: Eligible pts were identifi ed of whom 19 relapsed with CML more than 2 years post transplant. Median time to relapse was 96 months (range 26-246 months). The majority of pts relapsed with molecular or cytogenetic markers only (n=17), with 2 having overt haematologic disease. All pts received treatment post relapse. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (n=7), IM (n=9) or both DLI and IM (n=1) were given to the non-haematologic relapses who were treated with a second BMT or chemotherapy. 17 pts achieved a molecular remission and are alive in ongoing molecular remission, while 2 pts died from disease progression (see Figure) . Of 10 pts treated with IM, 8 have ceased the drug and remain in molecular complete remission (CR) more than 2 years post cessation. Conclusion: While BMT is curative for the majority of pts with CML in chronic phase, a proportion will relapse, sometimes up to 20 years post BMT. Ongoing vigilance with molecular",

Lupo-Stanghellini, E. Sala, A. Crotta, M. Marcatti, A. Assanelli, M. Carrabba, S. Marktel, L. Camba, F. Lunghi, C. Corti, M. Bernardi, J. Peccatori, F. Ciceri San Raffaele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Background: In the attempt to clarify if allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) provides a better outcome than non-transplant strategy in high-risk hematological malignancies, several algorithms were developed to assess the pretransplant risk. Optimize the pre-transplant risk assessment is a crucial point to improve the allo-HSCT decision making process. To date 2 major algorithms are of use in the clinical practice: the EBMT risk score and the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) risk score. We are here reporting the results of the evaluation of both the EBMT and the HCT-CI risk-assessment in our patient population to guide decisions making process in a patient oriented transplant strategy. Methods: Risk assessment score and outcome analysis included consecutive patients receiving transplant at our Institution. Data were obtained from local database. Results: Between Jan-2004 and Nov-2011, 427 pts received an allo-HSCT in the fulfi llment of clinical indications of EBMT recommendations. Data for a complete evaluation of both EBMT and HCT-CI were available for 247 allo-HSCT (pts and disease characteristics are listed in Table 1 ). The median HCT-CI score was 2 and the EBMT risk score 4. In our patient population we observed a correlation between lower EBMT risk score and lower HCT-CI risk score (chi-squared test, p0.058 - Table 2) . We were not able to demonstrate an impact on OS dependent on HCT-CI score, while the impact was demonstrated according to EBMT risk score. The overall survival (OS) at 26 months was 52% (\u00b14%). Among 107 pts dead, 47/107 died due to disease relapse, 60/107 due to transplant related mortality (TRM). The 26 moths OS according to EBMT risk score stratifi cation was: 83% score 0-2, 56% score 3-4, 36% score 5-7 (p <0.001); 68% score <4 versus 42% score \u22654 (p <0.001). The evaluation of the HCT-CI impact after EBMT risk score stratifi cation was not able to show a signifi cant difference in outcome, despite the correlation between lower EBMT risk score / lower HCT-CI. Conclusions: We are aware of some major limitation of our analysis -such as the sample size, the heterogeneity of the disease under treatment, the short follow-up -but it is of interest to observe how, in this setting, HCT-CI was not able to predict outcome while EBMT risk score did. Further evaluation, in a larger and more homogeneous setting, will be recommended to better evaluate the correlation between this two risk score algorithms. A.R. Mart\u00edn, L. Gonz\u00e1lez, D.

S354 were: Non-Hodgkin\u203as Lymphoma (NHL) in 8 patients (41.7%), monoclonal gammapathy (MG) in 14 (29.2%), Hodgkin disease (HD) in 8 (16.7%), leukemia Acute in 5 (10.4%) and prolymphocytic leukemia in 1 patient (2.1%). Establish the incidence and timing of relapse, overall survival and mortality unrelated to the transplant. We analyze the impact of age, diagnosis and the radiation therapy prior to transplantation (RTpre) and during conditioning (RTcond). Results: We estimated the incidence of relapse in our series in 42.9% (21 patients) with a median of 7 months (2-31) and 12.2% (6 patients) showed continuous progression of the disease after transplant. The median overall survival was 3.2 years (0-12) from diagnosis and 1.4 years (0.1 to 4) from transplantation. Fourteen patients died (28.6%): median of 3 years (0.4 to 8) from diagnosis and 16.5 months (5-38) from transplant. The following table shows the impact factors analyzed in contrast to the frequency of relapse after transplantation and mortality: (* Table) .

Bautista (1) Introduction: Multiple different factors infl uence the outcome of HSCT, being the conditioning regimen one of those more relevant. Due to lack of prior evaluation of its infl uence in our strategy employed in the treatment of high risk neoplastic diseases (co-infusion of umbilical cord blood and purifi ed CD34+ stem cells from a third-party donor, DUCBT), here we show the outcome analysis of our patients regarding their conditioning regimen. Patients and Methods: We included for evaluation consecutive DUCBT patients treated in 3 institutions until December 2010 and retrospectively analyzed their outcome according to the use of total body irradiation (TBI group) or not (CHEMO group) in the conditioning regimen. TBI group received hyperfractionated 1000cGy with pulmonary shielding combined with different chemotherapies and CHEMO group received only myeloablative chemotherapy combinations, both with ATG, cyclosporine A and steroids as GVHD prophylaxis. Results: We identifi ed 98 DUCBT, 50 in the TBI and 48 in the CHEMO group (Table 1 ). The TBI group included younger patients (median 33 vs 41 years) and more ALL patients (27 vs 5). The CHEMO group had more AML patients (16 vs 30). Most patients in both groups were 4-5/6 HLA identical (85%) and there were no differences in CD34+ cells/kg or TNC/kg contained in the grafts (median 0.12 x10 6 and 2.47 x107 respectively). Times to ANC and platelets engraftment were not different between both groups. Global graft failure incidence was low (7%) but it was higher in the CHEMO group (2% vs 12.5%). Grade II-IV acute GVHD rates were similar but grade III-IV affected more the TBI group (0% vs 10%) , causing death in 4 cases. With a median follow-up of 60 months for survivors, 1 year-TRM was higher for the TBI group (45% vs 22%) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was lower in the TBI group (10% vs 23%), rendering similar EFS and OS at 5y (44%% vs 52% and 48 % vs 56%, for TBI and CHEMO respectively). In the subgroup of AML/MDS patients (n=51, TBI 15/CHEMO 36), subtle but non signifi cant differences in DFS (44% vs 53%) and in OS (50% vs 57%) favour the CHEMO group. Conclusions: With the limitations of a retrospective analysis and patient selection bias between the groups, global results seem equal between TBI and CHEMO groups in our DUCBT platform. Lower CIR and graft failures favour TBI use but higher TRM penalize its results. Further strategies directed to reduce TRM are needed in this context to improve DUCBT results.",

Kanamori (1) Background: To predict the outcome in patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), several methods for assessment of risk score have been reported. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score in patients receiving HSCT at a Japanese single center. Patients and Methods: The EBMT risk score was retrospectively evaluated in consecutive patients with hematologic disorder who underwent HSCT between 2000 and 2010. The patients were divided into four risk groups according to the EBMT risk score: low risk (LR, score 0-2), intermediate risk-1 (IR-1, score 3), intermediate risk-2 (IR-2, score 4) and high risk (HR, score 5-7). Results: There were 152 male and 130 female, with a median age of 44 (range, 16-65 years). A median follow-up period was 5.5 (range, 0.2-11 years) . The study included 137 patients with AML, 72 ALL, 35 MDS, 19 CML, 9 aplastic anemia, 5 multiple myeloma, and 5 others. HSCT following myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for hematologic malignancies were carried out in 205 and 68 patients, respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of LR (n = 71), IR-1 (n = 70), IR-2 (n = 71) and HR (n = 70) group was 74, 59, 42 and 25%, respectively (P < 0.001). The transplant-related mortality at 5-year was 15% in LR, 24% in IR-1, 29% in IR-2 and 36% in HR group (P = 0.041). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 15% in LR, 15% in IR-1, 36% in IR-2 and 42% in HR group (P < 0.001). On univariate and multivariate analyses for individual risk factors consisting of scoring system, disease stage, donor type, and donor-recipient sex combination were signifi cantly associated with the outcomes, whereas age and time interval from diagnosis to transplant were not signifi cant predictors. In the subgroup analysis, the prognostic value of the EBMT risk score was confi rmed in patients with MAC, but not RIC (5-year OS were 85%, 36%, 53%, and 36%, respectively, for patients with LR, IR-1, IR-2, and HR group, P = 0.101). Conclusions: The results suggest that the EBMT risk score is a useful tool predicting the transplant outcome for patients with MAC and is benefi cial for stratifying patients in clinical studies, although reassessment of variables might be necessary to predict outcome in adult patients with RIC.",

Benesova (1) Background: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is standard therapeutic procedure in many haematological diseases. HSCT has curative potential for many patients but at the same time it can signifi cantly worse the patient's life. Quality of life was studied in a series studies of transplants patients. We decided to perform this analysis on the whole group of patients who underwent transplant in the Czech Republic. Methods: Our project has a retrospective and a prospective part. We present the fi rst data from the retrospective part. There were 5130 autologous and 2260 allogeneic stem cell transplant resp. (ASCT and AlloSCT resp.) performed in years 1986 -2010. 58% patients were recognized to be alive longer than one year after HSCT, 39% dead and 3% unknown. The standard FACT-G test was used, we have added couple of question employment status and possible recommendation of this procedure to the other patient. Results: During January 2011 to December 2011 we have received 708 questionars from patients, who underwent HSCT 1-21 (mean 4,6) years ago. The patients are divided into two groups: after ASCT (471 pts) and after AlloHSCT (237 pts). Most frequent diagnosis leading to transplantation were acute leukemia (116) and chronic myeloid leukemia (32) in AlloHSCT and myeloma (183) and lymphoma (226) in ASCT. More than one half of the patients after AlloHSCT (51%) considered their current health status and QOL as good to excellent, and 81% would recommend transplantation to their friends. Only one quarter (24%) of AlloSCT pts were able to return to their jobs. In ASCT group 80% pts reported their current QOL was the same or better than before transplantation, 40% considered their current health status and QOL as good to excellent, 35% were able to return to their jobs and 67 % would recommend transplantation to their friends. These preliminary results of QOL will be correlated to the current status of the patient\u00b4s disease. Supported by IGA of the Czech Ministery of Health -grant No. NT 11299. Introduction: The long-term consequences of an intensive care unit (ICU) admission for survivors of treatment for a haematological malignancy are unknown. Long-term healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) as well as fatigue, cognitive functioning, anxiety and depression were compared for patients that were admitted to the ICU during their treatment for a haematological disease (HaemICU+), with those that were not (HaemICU-) and medical ICU patients without haematological disease (MedICU+). Patients and Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out. HRQoL was measured using the short form-36 (SF-36), checklist individual strength (CIS-fatigue), cognitive failure questionnaire (CFQ) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). At median of 18 months after admission, questionnaires were sent to 143 patients with haematological malignancies (HaemICU+ Objective: Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly used as a treatment outcome along with traditional clinical outcomes in pediatric patients after allo-HCT. It's worthwhile that the majority of symptoms experienced by children after one year posttransplant are related with chronic GVHD. The aim of our study was to assess the QoL parameters in children at long-term follow up after allo-HCT and to analyze the impact of GVHD on child's QoL. Methods: 34 children (girls/boys-15/19; mean age 9 y.o., range: 3 to 19 y.o.) after HCT for acute leukemia (n=23), aplastic anemia (n=3), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=3), Fanconi anemia (n=3) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n=2) were enrolled in the study. Myeloablative conditional regimen (CR) was used in 17 pts (50%), reduced intensity CR -in 17 pts (50%). Median follow-up after HCT was 25.5 months (range 10-79). For comparison 133 healthy controls matched to survivors by age and gender were included in the study. The PedsQL\u2122 self-report and parent-report forms for corresponding age groups were used for children QoL assessment. To determine differences between groups we used t-test for independent samples or Mann-Whitney test to compare means or medians. An overall alpha level of 0.05 was used as a cut-off point for statistical signifi cance and statistical tests were two-sided. Results : Pediatric patients at long-term follow-up posttransplant had lower QoL parameters as compared with healthy children in the age groups: 2-4 y.o, 8-12 y.o and 13-18 y.o. Statistically signifi cant differences were found for physical (64.4 vs 80.1) and social functioning (77.5 vs 86.7) in 8-12 y.o. patients (p<0.05). In the age group 5-7 y.o. QoL parameters were similar in HCT recipients and healthy children. Recipients with cGVHD demonstrated a tendency of worse QoL parameters, as compared with those without cGVHD. Differences were observed for both self-reports and parentreports. QoL parameters were lower for parent reports than for self-reports. Conclusion: Children with blood disorders have decreased QoL at long-term after allo-HCT as compared to healthy children in the age groups: 2-4 y.o, 8-12 y.o and 13-18 y.o. The signifi cant impairment was observed for physical and social functioning in the age group of 8-12 y.o. In children with cGVHD QoL parameters are worse than in those without cGVHD. This confi rms the importance to monitor and control QoL in pediatric recipients of allo-HCT at long-term follow up. Introduction: Neurological manifestations of chronic GVHD are rare and can affect both the peripheral and central nervous system. The chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an unusual but important complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) occurring with a frequency of 1-2%. Material and Methods: We describe a series of 6 pts (AML: 3; CML: 1; AA: 2) who underwent allogeneic HSCT and developed CIDP as part of graft-versus-host disease. The median age 26 years (17-41), and sex-ratio: 0,2 (M/F: 1/5). Median interval from diagnosis to transplant was 6 months (4 to 9). The conditioning regimen consist on a myeloablative chemotherapy only. GVHD prophylaxis associated Ciclosporin (CsA) and Methotrexate. All pts received peripheral SCT from an HLA identical sibling donor. Investigations concern detection of high cerebrospinal fl uid protein, sensory-motor demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy by electrophysiological study and radiological abnormalies by CTscan. Results: The fi rst neurologic symptoms appear within an average of 23 months (6-56): diplopia, generalized muscle pain, paresthesia, functional impairment of the lower, syndrome of the cauda equina, pyramidal syndrome and posterior cord. Symptoms were observed in 5 pts since immunossuppressive therapy for prophylaxis or GVHD treatment. Four pts had presented CMV infection before the neurological symptoms. Cerebrospinal fl uid protein was negative for 4/4 pts. CT brain and/or lumbosacral performed in four pts was normal. Electromyography performed in all pts showed sensory-motor demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. The treatment involves injecting intravenous (IV) gammaglobulins at 0.4 g/kg/day dose for 5 days, 4 to 6 cures. Gammaglobulins are associated with continues of ciclosporin and corticosteroids (5 cases). In terms of response: complete regression was obtained in 4 cases (66,6%), a failure is observed in one case, even after the addition of rituximab and one patient died of severe infection after only one cure. Conclusion: Neurological manifestations in chronic GVHD are rare, but they can have a major impact on the disease course after allogeneic HSCT. Early recognition of neurological complications is important to treat pts properly. IV gammaglobulin, associated to cyclosporine and corticosteroids, appears to be an effective treatment as shown in our series.",

M\u00fcller Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, DK) Background: The infl ammatory response induced during the conditioning regimen may be related to the outcome in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Although previous studies have suggested a role of infl ammatory cytokines, the results of these studies have been inconsistent due to highly variable levels of cytokines during the course of transplantation. However, C -reactive protein (CRP) released by hepatocytes in response to IL-6, has proven a sensitive and reliable marker of infl ammation in infectious and infl ammatory disorders. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the infl ammatory tonus expressed as mean CRP levels throughout the conditioning is associated with the outcome in SCT. Moreover, we evaluated associations between clinical baseline parameters and CRP levels. Patients and Methods: During the period 2000 to 2009 777 patients underwent SCT at the National Danish SCT centre. Of those CRP levels were available from 349 patients (aged 27.3 years (0.3 years-60.3 years), transplanted for malignant haematological diseases (n=288) or benignant diseases (n=61). Donors included matched siblings (SIB, n=170) and matched unrelated donors (MUD, n=179). A mean of 6.5 (interquartiles range 6-8) CRP measurements were available from day -7 to day 0 from each patient. Results: The mean CRP level during the conditioning was elevated (27 mg/l) compared to normal range (0-10 mg/l). Mean CRP levels above normal range were associated with reduced overall survival (OAS, p<0.0001), increased risk of relapse (p=0.001) and increased treatment related mortality (TRM, p=0.032). An analysis stratifi ed of CRP levels revealed increased TRM in the SIB group (p=0.004) and increased risk of relapse in the MUD group (p=0.02). Mean CRP levels were not associated with the risk of acute GvHD. A high mean CRP level was associated with high risk leukemia vs. standard risk leukemia (21 mg/l vs. 33 mg/l, p<0.0001), MUD vs. SIB (19 mg/l vs. 34 mg/l, p<0.0001), conditioning with TBI/Cy (29 mg/l) vs. TBI/V16 (22 mg/l) and Bu/Cy (23 mg/l) (p=0.028) and \u00b1ATG (43 mg/l vs. 15 mg/l, p<0.0001). Perspective: Risk of relapse, treatment related mortality and overall survival are associated with a high infl ammatory tonus as expressed by CRP measurements during the conditioning. The potential important prognostic information given by this easily obtained analysis should be addressed in prospective studies.",

Pts and Methods: we retrospectively studied 87 pts (51 male, 36 female) with a median age of 49 years (15-65), who underwent allo-HSCT in our center between January 2007 and January 2011. The patients' baseline diseases were: MM (30%), AML (22%), NHL (12.5%), ALL (10%), HL (4.5%), CLL (4.5%), SMD (4.5%), CML (2.3%), WM (2.3%), AA (2.3%), MF (2.3%), and others (5%). 60% pts received allo-HSCT from HLA identical siblings, and 40% from unrelated donors. 26.4 % pts received RIC regimens. Median and maximum followup were 16 and 59 months, respectively. Results: for PAM, 9.2% pts had low risk, 64.4% intermediate risk, 21.8% high risk, and 4.6% very high risk; for HCT-CI, 71.3% pts had low risk, 18.4% intermediate risk, and 10.3% high risk. After allografting, 53% pts had complications, the most frequent being: infections (32%), nephrotoxicity (32%), pulmonary toxicities (9.2%), and hepatotoxicity (9.2%). Only 45% of pts included in low and intermediate levels of PAM score presented any complications vs 74% of pts with high/very high risk (p: 0.018). Acute GVHD developed in 36.8% pts, and chronic GVHD in 35%. For PAM score: 29.5% of pts with low/intermediate risk had aGVHD vs 63.6% of pts with high/very high risk (p: 0.018). Contrarily, the HCT-CI index was not good predictor of complications or GVHD. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 23%. Causes of NRM included infections (50%), hemorrhage (20%), pulmonary toxicities (15%), GVHD (5%), cardiotoxicity (5%), and hepatic toxicity (5%). The PAM score effectively risk-stratifi ed the pts for NRM: 0%, 18%, 42%, and 50% in the low, intermediate, high and very high risk groups, respectively, showing a clear distinction by categories (p<0.05). However, we found no impact in NRM when using the HCT-CI model. The correlation between both indexes was poor (see Figure 1 ). Conclusions: In our series of pts, risk groups based on the PAM score provided much better discrimination of post-HSCT complications and NRM than the HCT-CI model.",

Cetin Erciyes University (Kayseri, TR) Objectives and Aim: Serum albumin level is mainly a marker of nutritional status in both healthy subjects and patients with malignancies. Our objective was to investigate the association of pre-transplant serum albumin levels with prognosis in autologous HSCT recipients. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analysed 106 patients' data who had undergone autologous HSCT diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Serum albumin, phosphorus, D-dimer and uric acid, CD34+ cell count, BMI, presence of neutropenic fever of 106 patients were evaluated. The patients' data were obtained from the fi le records. Results: 33 (31.1%) of the patients were female, and 73 (68.9%) were male. The diagnosis of the patients were; Hodgkin Lyphoma (33 patients, 31.1%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (34 patients, 32.1%), and multiple myeloma (39 patients, 36.8%). The median age was found 42 years (min-max: 17-67). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that low albumin levels (<3.2 g/dL) were associated with decreased overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with normal albumin levels (p=0.016 and p=0.001 respectively). A higher risk of death was observed in low-albumin group (HR=2.69, CI:1.17-6.24, p=0.016 for OS and HR=2.69,CI:1.17-6.24 p=0.001 for DFS). Cox regression analysis showed that; low albumin levels were associated with increased risk of relapse but this was not statistically signifi cant (HR:0.97 with %95 CI:0.28-3.32, p=0.96). Serum uric acid, D-dimer, phosphorus levels, CD34+ cell count, BMI, presence of neutropenic fever, age and gender were not associated with poor OS and DFS (p>0.05). Conclusion: Pre-transplant serum albumin levels may be associated with poor outcomes in patients who had undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation regardless with primary diagnosis.",

Pretnar University Medical Center Ljubljana (Ljubljana, SI) Background: Heart failure (HF) after alloHSCT affects up to 5% patients in 5 years and 9% patients in 15 years after the pro-cedure. Intracardial HSCT could lead to improved ventricular remodeling, better exercise tolerance, and potentially improved survival. We report a case of a patient successfully treated with intracardial autoHSCT 18 years after alloHSCT. In 1990, a 35-year old male patient was referred for AML. He received induction course and, subsequently, 12 maintenance courses of DAT. His sister was a matched donor and alloHSCT was performed in 1992. He was prepared with Cy/TBI and received methotrexate and cyclosporin for GvHD prophylaxis. Grade I skin aGvHD was treated with topical steroids. Otherwise, posttransplant course was unremarkable and he remains in continued remission. In 2005, he developed HF attributed to a combination of ischemic and post HSCT cardiomyopathy. Because of HF progression, intracardial autoHSCT was proposed. Before the procedure, full donor chimerism was confi rmed. In September 2010, 55.9x10 6 CD34+ cells were collected after fi lgrastim mobilization, and after immunoselection, 11.5x10 6 CD34+ cells were delivered intramyocardialy. Posttransplant course was unremarkable. Results of cardiovascular parameters before and after the procedure are presented in Table 1 . Discussion: Anthracyclines are well known cardiotoxic agents. Cyclophosphamide and TBI are similarly associated with cardiotoxicity, while cyclosporin and steroids are associated with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. All the mentioned factors can contribute to HF either directly or through increase of risk factors. HF has a progressive course and at some point, pharmacological therapy fails. Intracardial autoHSCT can improve both ejection fraction of left ventricle and overall performance. Conclusion: Intramyocardial autoHSCT was performed for progressive HF in AML patient after alloHSCT. The patient's condition improved and he is still in 1st remisison more than 1 year after procedure.",

Final regimen dose AUC attained was 3754 microM*min in the 4BU group and was not measured in the 16 BU group. All patients in the 4BU group engrafted while there were two cases of graft failure (cord blood stem cell source) in the 16BU group.

Haematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) is curative, but there is signifi cant morbidity and mortality associated with conventional Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide containing myelo-ablative conditioning regimens. We examined results in a series of patients who received treosulfan and fl udarabine as chemotherapy. Sixteen patients received treosulfan 42 g/m 2 or 36 g/m 2 (1), fl udarabine 150 mg/m 2 with Alemtuzumab (15), prior to HCT for CGD between 2009 and October 2011 in 3 centres (Newcastle upon Tyne 8, Great Ormond Street Hospital London 5 and Prague 3). Median age at transplant was 9.3 years (range: 18 months to 15 years). 9 had previous colitis and 5 previous fungal infection. Donors were: unrelated (15) and 1 matched sibling donor. Stem cell source was: PBSC (12), BM (4) . Median follow up is short: 15 months (range: 2 to 30). Overall survival was 87.5%. 2 patients died: 1 was 23 months post transplant with severe GVHD and the other day +1 following MSD transplant in a child with severe infl ammatory complications, colitis, fungal and mycobacterial disease. 9 had GVHD, only 1 > grade II. One patient had graft loss, 1 died prior to engraftment and the patient who died from GVHD had 100% donor chimerism.10 are alive and well with 100% donor myeloid chimerism. The 3 from Prague are also alive and well with either 50-60% neutrophil oxidative burst or myeloid chimerism. Increased use of PBSC may favour improved donor myeloid chimerism and with the use of Alemtuzumab the incidence of signifi cant GVHD was not increased. Long-term follow up is required to determine the gonadotoxic effects of this approach in comparison to Busulfan containing regimens, but the combination of Treosulfan, Fludarabine and Alemtuzumab is an ideal choice of conditioning for HCT in CGD, associated with good myeloid engraftment and low regimen related toxicity.",

Kuci, A. Willasch, S. Fulda, H. Boenig, T. Klingebiel, P. Bader Goethe University (Frankfurt, DE) Objectives: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) has become an important treatment modality for patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is also under investigation for soft tissue sarcomas. The therapeutic success of allo-SCT is still limited by relapse. Adoptive donor lymphocyte infusions, based on minimal residual disease status, using IL-15-expanded cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells or CIK cell products with reduced alloreactive-potential, i.e. irradiated and CD56-enriched CIK cells may prevent relapse without causing graft versus host disease (GvHD). To generate preclinical data we studied anti-leukemic-and anti-tumor-potential of CIK cells and CIK cell products in vivo. Methods: Immunodefi cient mice were injected intravenously with human AML cell lines THP-1, SH-2 and primary human AML cells or with human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines RH41 and RH30 at minimal doses required for leukemia or tumor engraftment. Mice were randomly assigned for analysis of CIK cell treatment. Organs of mice were analyzed by fl ow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for engraftment of malignant cells and CIK cells. Potential of CIK cells to induce GvHD was determined by histological analysis. Results : In spite of delayed CIK cell expansion compared with malignant cells, CIK cells injected once at effector to target cell (E:T) ratios of 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5 or 1:25 were suffi cient for signifi cant reduction or elimination of RH41, primary AML, SH-2 or RH30 cells, whereas against fast-expanding THP-1 cells an E: T ratio of 250:1 was needed to achieve comparable results. Mice injected with SH2, primary AML or RH30 cells, which once received conventional CIK cell treatment or monthly injections of CIK cell products, showed an increased disease free survival (DFS) compared with untreated controls. However, DFS was not markedly improved in SH-2-injected mice treated with irradiated CIK cells. Flow cytometric-and PCR-based detection of malignant cells showed that a one-time treatment with conventional CIK cells resulted in the lowest degree of malignant cells compared with repeated injections of CD56-enriched or irradiated CIK cells. Histological analysis of GvHD-targeted organs showed minimal alloreactivity after CIK cell treatment. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data demonstrated that IL-15activated CIK cells and even CIK cell products have potent cytotoxic capacity against AML and RMS cells without causing GvHD. The most common indications for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were thalassemia major, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Other allo-HSCT indications were osteopetrorickets, Fanconi anemia, myelodysplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia, severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, aplastic anemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, langerhans cell histiocytosis, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) was performed mostly for neuroblastoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Other indications for auto-HSCT were Ewing sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, langerhans cell histiocytosis, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, Wilms tumor and germ cell tumor. The median age of the patients was 8 years (0.5-18 years) , with 48 (57%) of patients were male and 35 (43%) were female. Allogeneic was %66 (57) of all transplants while autologous was %34 (30). Of the autologous %3.3 (1) was bone marrow derived, %93.4 (28) from peripheral blood stem cells, and %3.3 (1) was combined transplants. Of the allogeneic transplants, %86 (49) were bone marrow and %14 (8) were peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Of the allogeneic grafts, %89 (51) were taken from matched family members, and %11 (6) were haploidentical. Myeloablative conditioning was given, except the two patients with SCID. Complete hematopoietic engraftment was achieved in 78 (%90) transplants with the median time for neutrophile engraftment was 18 days (9-48 days) . Methotrexate, cyclosporine and methylprednisolone or different combinations were used for Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Fifteen patients developed aGvHD while 3 developed cGVHD. Among 15 patients with aGvHD 2 patients died, both of whom were grade IV aGvHD. The 3 patients with cGvHD are alive. The median follow-up period for survivors was 33 months (1-287 months) . 57 patients are alive (%68) and 26 patients died (%32). The leading cause of death was persistence or relapse of the underlying disease accounting for 55% of deaths within 100 days and 70% of deaths within 1 year of transplant.",

Sachdeva Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (Delhi, IN) Introduction: There is lack of data for pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) from a developing country like India. We describe here our experience of allo-SCT programme at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a tertiary hospital in North India. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of all children who underwent allo-SCT from Jan 2008 to Oct 2011 was done. Results: A total of 28 children (17 males and 11 females) underwent allo-SCT. The mean age was 11.2 years (11 months-18 years). The indications were Thalassemia-13, Aplastic anemia-6, Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-3, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-1, Juvenile myelomocytic leukemia-1, Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-2, Fanconi Anemia-1, Hurler syndrome-1. Donors were HLA-matched sibling-23 and unrelated cord blood-5. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood (PB)-11, bone marrow (BM)-12 and cord blood (CB)-6. One patient received CB and BM from same sibling. 23 patients underwent myeloablative transplants and 5 had reduced intensity conditioning (HLH-2, Thalassemia-1, AML-1, Fanconi-1). Three donor lymphocyte infusions were given to one patient. Neutrophil engrafted in 26 patients at a median of 14 days (range 11 to 44). Four patients had rejection (Thalassemia-2, aplastic-1, Fanconi-1) but all are alive with disease. Eighteen patients (64%) are alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 253 days (65-591 days). Day-100 mortality was 3/28 (11%). Cause of death was Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD)-1, Veno Occlusive Disease-1 and Candida meningitis-1. Three patients died post day-100 due to relapse-1, cytomegalovirus-1 and aspergillus-1. Engraftment syndrome was seen post CB transplant in one child. Acute GVHD was seen in 12 patients (PB-8, CB-1, BM-3), grade III-IV was seen in 4 patients (PB-4). Chronic GVHD was seen in 6 /28 (source BM-1, PB-4). Massive bleeding (gastro-intestinal-2 and pulmonary-1) occurred in three children. Two patients developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Among 5 unrelated CB transplant patients, 4 engrafted. One with AML relapsed at 184 days and died, another with HLH who had received campath based conditioning died of cytomegalovirus infection at day 154 days and one with thalassemia had rejection but is alive post autologous transplant. Two patients are alive and disease free (Thalassemia-1, Hurler-1). Conclusion: Our results are encouraging and give hope to many children who need allogeneic stem cell transplant in the developing world.",

Im (3) Background: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is very rare in children than in adults. Although the optimal treatment for children with MDS without matched sibling donor (MSD) is presently undetermined, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative donors should be considered for severe cytopenia. We analyzed the result of allogeneic HSCT for children with MDS in a Korean single center. It is the fi rst report about the outcome of HSCT for Pediatric MDS in Korea. Methods: Between November 1997 and June 2011, 16 children with MDS underwent allogeneic HSCT. These patients had refractory cytopenia (RC) (n=7), and refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n=9). Median age was 8.9 years (range 1.6-20.3). Cytogenetic analysis revealed that ten had a normal karyotype, six had miscellaneous chromosomal changes, but nobody had monosomy 7. Six patients were grafted from MSD, another 6 patients from mismatched unrelated donor, 3 patients from umbilical cord blood, and one from haploidentical related donor. Results: Sustained neutrophil engraftment was achieved in 11 patients after fi rst transplantation. One patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage on day 1, and 4 patients experienced graft failure; all patients were regrafted from haploidentical related donors. With a median follow-up of 6.0 years (range 0.1-14), the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 0.27, and extensive chronic GVHD was 0.12. The cumulative incidence of treatment related mortality and relapse was 0.19 and 0.20. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and event-free survival at 5 years were 0.65 and 0.49. Graft failure was associated with the diagnosis of RC (RR 3.67, 95% CI 1.4-9.6, P=0.026) and HLA-mismatched transplant (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.3-6.0, P=0.05). Over grade 2 acute GVHD increased the risk of extensive chronic GVHD (RR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8-23.2, P=0.05), and extensive chronic GVHD signifi cantly affected OS (P=0.001). Conclusions: Despite most of patients with RC received myeloablative conditioning including busulfan and cyclophosphamide, they showed high engraftment failure rates, especially in mismatched transplants. However, all of them were successfully regrafted form haploidentical related donors, and showed comparable treatment outcome. This study demonstrated that haploidentical HSCT could be successfully used for graft failure of pediatric MDS.",

Chan KK Women's and Children's Hospital (Singapore, SG) Haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) is the only cure for children with high risk/relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) since 1970's. In SE Asian population, matched sibling remains the main source of stem cells. Unrelated matched donors for minority races are often diffi cult to fi nd from international bone marrow registries. Unrelated cord blood is an alternative source of stem cells in a multiracial population like Singapore. We describe our results for children from a single transplant center. Methods: We performed allogeneic HSCT for 55 children with leukemia over a period 12 years from May 1998 to Dec 2010. There were a total 56 HSCT, one patient had 2 transplants, 2nd HSCT using MUD after relapse of leukemia from the fi rst unrelated cord blood transplant (CBT). During this period 31 (55%) MSD, 3 (5%) related cord, 5 (10%) MUD and 17 (30%) unrelated cord blood transplants were performed. The underlying conditions were 27 (49%) for ALL,18 (33%) for MDS/AML and 10 (18%) for CML/CMML. Conditioning regimes consisted of myeloablative busulphan and cyclophosphamide (CPA) for AML/CML and TBI +CPA with testicular/CNS \u00b1 RT boost for ALL. ATG were added in unrelated sources of stem cells. Graft vs host disease (GVHD)prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin \u00b1methotrexate \u00b1 methylprednisolone. Results: All engrafted well except for one chlid had graft failure after unrelated CBT for relapse ALL but he remained disease-free 6 years post transplant. TRM was 14% (8/55); 3 from infection, 2 from pneumonitis, 1 AGVHD with CMV infection, 2 chronic GVHD (lung/liver). 2 died from late effect of transplant; 1 had brain tumor (PNET) died 8 yrs later and 1 died of chronic lung disease 5 yrs post transplant. Both received TBI in conditioning regime.The median neutrophil engraftment were D+16 (range D+11 to D+27) for BMT and D+26 (range +13 to +46) for CBT. The median platelet engraftment were D+22 and D+35 for BMT and CBT respectively. 2 yrs OS were 65%, 71% while 5 yrs OS were 61% and 55% for BMT and CBT respectively. 2 yrs EFS were 54% and 51% and 5yrs EFS were 45% and 44% for BMT and CBT respectively. Conclusion: Our results showed that cord blood can form at least 30% stem cell source. This is an important alternative source of stem cell especially in our population with diverse racial groups. The outcomes of CBT are comparable with BMT inspite of slower neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive, primary immunodefi ciency characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia with microplatelets, recurrent infection, and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease and lymphoreticular malignancies. To date, the only curative therapy for WAS is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We describe a case of WAS who was conditioned with fl udarabine-based regimen and transplanted by using highly-purifi ed CD34+ stem cells from his HLA 2-loci mismatched mother and achieved sustained full donor-type engraftment and immunologic reconstitution. A nine-month-old boy presented with eczema, microthrombocytopenia and recurrent infection was diagnosed as severe WAS (score 5) by fl ow cytometric and mutation analysis. A missence g.5640C>A, c.1455C>A mutation on exon 12 was detected. Because of lacking donor, he underwent haploidentical HSCT from his mother at 20 months of age. He received myeloablative regimen consisting of busulfan (16 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg), rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (10 mg/kg) and fl udarabine (160 mg/m 2 ). He also received methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. T celldepletion and positive selection of peripheral CD34+ stem cells from his G-CSF stimulated mother was performed using the method of immunomagnetic separation (CliniMACS). The number of infused CD34+ cells was 16.11x10 6 /kg. He achieved full hematopoietic engraftment with the time for neutrophil, platelet, and erythrocyte recovery being 11 days, 14 days and 19 days, respectively. He developed grade II aGVHD on day +12, and grade I cGVHD on day +240, resolution achieved in aGVHD with i.v. methylprednisolone and cyclosporine, in cGVHD with oral prednisolone. He was positive for cytomegalovirus which was detected by PCR in his blood, urine and stool samples on day +6 and resolved with ganciclovir. He is now at 30 months of age, he did'nt have any serious infection and fl uorescence",

Arpaci Gulhane Military Medical Faculty (Ankara, TR) Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) has provided an alternative option particularly for those who urgently need an allogeneic transplant. Here, we report the haplo-HSCT results of our centre with G-CSF mobilized, CD34\u00b1selected peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) by using the CliniMACS immunomagnetic selection technology. Six children (osteopetrorickets, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (M4) transformed from Fanconi's Anemia (FA), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) and relapsed AML) with a median age of 7 years (7 months-13 years) underwent 2- (2), 3- (2), and 5-(2)-loci mismatched-haplo-HSCT from related donors. The recipients received myeloablative conditioning regimen except for SCID patient. The children with hematological malignancies were conditioned with fl udarabine-based regimen including total body irradiation. Except for the patients with SCID and relapsed AML, the recipients received different immunosuppressants consisting of methotrexate, cyclosporine and methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. G-CSF alone was used for mobilization at a dose of 10 mcg/kg/day for 5 days. Leukopheresis were performed on the fi fth day of the G-CSF therapy. The median number of infused CD34+ cells were 13.17 (5.58-19 .07) x 10 6 /kg. Five patients achieved full hematopoietic engraftment with the median time for neutrophil, platelet and erythrocyte recovery being 13 days, 17 days and 23 days, respectively. The patient with osteopetrorickets, MDS and FA+AML died at 4, 5 and 9 months after transplantation due to primary engraftment failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and sepsis, respectively. The others are currently alive in complete remission at a median follow-up of 14 months (range 2-30 months), but the antibody responses of the patient with SCID remained low only for IgA. Five patients achieved full donortype engraftment. The patient with WAS developed grade II aGVHD on day +12 and the patient with FA+AML developed grade I gastrointestinal aGVHD on day +60. None of patients developed cGVHD. The results here suggest that haplo-HSCT might provide an opportunity for benign and malign diseases, especially for immunodefi ciency syndromes who do not have available donor and urgently need an allogeneic transplant.",

G\u00fcrsel, I. Eker, O. Babacan, E. K\u00fcrek\u00e7i Gulhane Military Medical Faculty (Ankara, TR) Platelet distribution width (PDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV) are indices which increase during platelet activation. Accelerated thrombopoiesis is one of the reasons of platelet activation. We hypothesized that PDW and MPV may increase towards the platelet engraftment due to accelerated thrombopoiesis and if so can be markers. We studied the relationship between platelet engraftment time and PDW and MPV values in patients, who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT). Haemogram parameters with PDW and MPV of 20 patients with a median age of 7 years (range, 2-13), who underwent allo HSCT were studied. The parameters on the fi rst day of myeloablative regimen (MR), product infusion date (ID), 6 days (-6BE) and 3 days (-3BE) before platelet engraftment, the day of platelet engraftment (ED) and 3 days (+3AE) and 6 days (+6AE) after engraftment were evaluated. Median time for ED was 17 days (range, 14-32). There weren't signifi cant difference between MR and ID in PDW and MPV values, also no signifi cant difference were present between -6BE, -3BE and ED in these values. But there were signifi cant difference between ID,-6BE,-3BE and ED in PDW (14.6\u00b12.3%; 13.4\u00b11.4%; 13.2\u00b11.4% and 13.2\u00b11.3% respectively; p=0.018) and MPV (6.6\u00b10.9 fl ; 7.3\u00b13.3 fl ; 7.3\u00b11.2 fl and 8.2\u00b11 fl respectively; p=0.007). There weren't signifi cant difference between ED and +3AE in PDW and MPV. But there were signifi cant difference between +3AE and +6AE in PDW (13.0\u00b11.5% and 14.4\u00b13.4% respectively; p=0.017) and MPV (8.3\u00b10.7 fl and 7.5\u00b11.1 fl respectively; p=0.046). There weren't signifi cant difference between MR and +6AE in PDW and MPV. These results shows that there is a gradually signifi cant increase in MPV and signifi cantly decrease in PDW towards the engraftment, which returns to MR values on +6AE. Activated platelets seem larger in analyzers, independently of the principle used. PDW doesn't increase during platelet distention caused by platelet swelling, while this situation increases MPV. In conclusion accelerated thrombopoiesis towards the platelet engraftment seems to be causing the production of uniformly large, swollen platelets, which may be the reason of signifi cant increase in MPV while decrease in PDW, starting from -6BE until to +6AE, the time that MPV and PDW returns to MR values.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University School of Medicine (Antalya, TR) Objectives and Materials: We report the outcome of 42 unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantations (UCBT) performed in Akdeniz University Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit between 2005-2011. One patient received double cord blood infusions. Seven patients were treated for hematologic malignancies and 35 patients were for non-malign diseases. Eight patients were suffering from inherited genetic diseases, 8 patients had bone marrow failure, 19 patients had primary immune defi ciencies. Median age was 2 years (range, 3 months-17 years) and the median weight was 10.8 kg (range, 2.4-47.5 kg). The preparative regimen was busulphan based myeloablative in 35 patients. HLA DRB1 high resolution molecular typing was available for 35 CB units and matching between donor and recipient was 2 of 6 in 1 patient, 3 of 6 in 2 patients, 4 of 6 in 6 patients, 5 of 6 in 21 patients and 6 of 6 in 5 patients. The median nucleated cell dose was 10.3 5 x10 7 /kg (range, 1.5-41.5x10 7 /kg) and the median CD 34+ cell dose was 2.1x10 5 /kg (range, 0.7-20.5x10 5 /kg). Graft versus host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and steroids or MMF. Results: The median number of days to an absolute neutrophil count of 500/\u03bcL was 23 (range, 8-66 days). The median time to an untransfused platelet count of more than 20.000/\u03bcL was 44 days (range, 20-87 days). Eight patients experienced grade II-IV acute GVHD. The one year overall and event-free survival were 62.4 and 39%, respectively. Engraftment was achieved in 17 patients, 8 patients had graft failure, 11 patients had autologous reconstitution. rejected and 6 patients died within the fi rst month after transplantation before engraftment. Twenty-three patients were alive at a median follow up of 18 months (range, 2-75 months). The primary cause of death was the infection. Conclusions: These results suggest that unrelated umbilical cord blood is a viable stem cell source for patients who require urgent transplantation and if the family donor is not available.",

Boruczkowski (1) Introduction: Today, the cord blood (CB) is widely recognized as a source of haematopoetic stem cells (HSC) and Wharton jelly (WJ) -as a novel source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Here we report the fi rst use in Europe, autologous (auto) CB-derived-neurally-committed cells (CBNC), fi rst use of WJ derived MSC from \"third party donor\" and 11 usage attempts of allogeneic (allo) CB units (CBU) from PBKM SA. Materials and Methods: From January 2007 to November 2011, PBKM SA received 12 requests concerning stored CBU and one request concerning WJ-MSC from \"third party donor\". 11 standard requests for allo transplantations (tx), resulted in 7 allo tx and 4 remaining CB requests were withdrawn due to lack of HLA match. Recipients of allo HSC were the children with: early relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -2, neuroblastoma (NBL) relapse after auto HSC tx -1, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) -1, Fanconi anemia -1, Langerhans cell histiocytosis -1, chronic granulomatous disease -1. All above listed HSC tx, with the exception girl with NBL were fi rst transplants. In one case, the CBU request regarded regenerative procedure, in a boy with cardiac-arrest induced cerebral ischemia (CI) in a permanent vegetative state, who received three auto CBNC tx. The recipient of WJ-MSC, was a 17 year old girl with MDS and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) after allo tx from matched unrelated donor, who experienced steroid resistant gut GvHD fl are. Preparation, freezing and storage of all CBU and WJ-MSC were done in PBKM SA. The conditioning regimens were carried out, according to appropriate protocols. Both, boy with CI auto transplanted with partly pre-labeled by iron oxide nanoparticles CBNC and a girl with MDS and cGvHD, didn't required conditioning regimen before tx. Results: All CBU engrafted. No adverse events or abnormal reactions, except for transient increases in body temperature in pt with CI, were observed. The pt with NBL relapsed in 18 month and one pt with ALL relapsed in 11 month after transplantation. Other children remain in complete remission. In the boy with CI, mild functional improvement was found -decreased vegetative state, amelioration of spasticity and nystagmus. The girl with GvHD was successfully treated with 2 infusions of WJ-MSC, achieved full remission and was discharged home. Conclusion: The course of transplantations confi rm that CBU and WJ from PBKM SA are the suitable source of HSCs and MSCs, when are used for the treatment.",

Zaidman, R. Gefen, I. Kasis, H. Mandel, I. Porat, R. Ofi r, S. Hadad, M. Ben Arush Rambam Medical Center (Haifa, IL) Indroduction: Pediatric patients with immunodefi ciency and severe organ dysfunction from previous infections as well as children with lung, heart and liver injury secondary to metabolic diseases or drug induced are at very high risk for lifethreatening adverse events and mortality during and after allogeneic BMT. The standard myeloablative conditioning regimen (Busulphan with Cyclophosphamide or TBI protocol) is associated with severe mucositis, lung toxicity and venoocclusive disease of the liver and causes signifi cant morbidity in patients with previous organ injury. Treosulphan is an alkylating agent with myeloablative,immunosuppressive and neoplastic effects. It has been used as a conditioning agent recently with promising favorable toxicity profi le compared with Busulphan and TBI. Patients: We describe our experience in using Treosulphan in place of Busulphan for myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen in allogeneic BMT for high risk patients.Five children (3 boys and 2 girls) were included. Two patients, 1 -SCID with respiratory failure and severe lung infections and 1 -ALL with cardiomyopathy and severe previous infections who underwent a second BMT -received RIC including: Treosulphan, Fludarabine and Antithymoglobuline (ATG). Three children had myeloablative regimen including: Treosulphan, Cyclophosphamide and ATG (for unrelated donor). Three patients had immunodefi ciency (1 SCID, 2 CGD), 1 -Niemann-Pick type C, and 1 ALL for second BMT. Three patients underwent BMT from bone marrow of matched sibling donor, 1 from an unrelated donor and 1 unrelated cord with 1 minor mismatch in DR. Results: All patients engrafted donor stem cells. The child with Niemann-Pick syndrome and unrelated cord blood developed disseminated adenoviral infection post engraftment and rejected the donor cells. She is alive 5 months after fi rst BMT. The rest had complete or mixed stable chimerism. No patient developed gastrointestinal or upper respiratory mucositis, venoocclusive or severe infections. All patients continued enteral nutrition. None received antalgics or morphin.All were given less blood products or antibiotics. Conclusions: Treosulphan may substitute Busulphan for conditioning before Allogeneic BMT especially for non-malignant diseases, providing favorable acute toxicity profi le and good primary engraftment, and could be less toxic for children at high-risk.",

Szpecht, D. Boruczkowski, J. Wachowiak University of Medical Sciences (Poznan, PL) Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) improves outcome of refractory haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), but the risk of morbidity and mortality related to myeloablative preparative regimen is high. The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in children with refractory HLH and LCH conditioned for allo-HSCT with reduced toxicity treosulfan-based preparative regimen. Patients and Methods: Between 2001 and 2011, 3 children with disseminated, multi-organ refractory LCH (2 boys, 1 girl; 8, 12 and 24 months of age) and 8 years old boy with refractory HLH underwent allo-HSCT. The reduced-intensity conditioning regimen applied consisted of treosulfan (3 x 10 g/m 2 ) in combination with etoposide 30 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 2 x 60 mg/kg (n=2) or with fl udarabin (5 x 30 mg/m 2 ) and Melfalan 140 mg/m 2 (n=1) in children with LCH, whilst in patient with HLH in combination with fl udarabin (5 x 30 mg/m 2 ) and MabCampath (anti-CD52 antibody). Patients with LCH were transplanted from matched sibling donors (MSD) (bone marrow, n=2; cord blood, n=1), a child with HLH received peripheral stem cells from matched unrelated donor. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA for all patients, boy with HLH additionally received mycophenolate mofetil. Results: All patients engrafted (ANC >0.5 x 10 9 /L on days 15, 18, 24, 50; platelet count >20 x 10 9 /L on days 13, 16, 18, 41) with complete donor chimerism at engraftment, and subsequently developed mixed chimerism with graft rejection in 2 of them (24 and 12 months after allo-HSCT). As regimen-related toxicity exlusively mucositis of grade 2 to 3 was seen in 2 patients. Two patients demonstrated reactivation of herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and EBV. All 4 patients are alive and remain in continuous complete clinical remission at 3, 14, 108, and 121 months after allo-HSCT. Conclusion: In 4 reported children with refractory LCH and HLH the preparative regimen based on treosulfan at the total dose of 30 g/m 2 demonstrated the myeloablative effect suffi cient for development of curative immunotherapeutic effect of allo-HSCT and no signifi cant organ toxicity. To achieve stable complete donor chimerism in children with histiocytic malignancy a higher total dose of treosulfan should be administered (36-42 g/m 2 ) . Introduction: Graft versus Host disease (GvHD) can severely affect quality of life of patients after allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT). To prevent GvHD, ATG is used during the conditioning regimen, which can have an impact on the immune reconstitution. We performed an analysis of the lymphocytes subpopulations at different time points after allo-HSCT to evaluate the impact of the use of ATG on immune reconstitution. Materials and Methods: The cellular immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT was studied in 32 pediatric patients, with a minimum survival of 3 months. Evaluations were performed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months or until death or relapse. Patients with diagnosis of T-cell immune defi ciency and patients transplanted after CD34 positive selection of the graft were excluded for this analysis. ATG Thymoglobulin\u00ae in most of the cases at a dose of 10 mg/ kg was used in 21 pts and 11 pts did not receive any ATG during the allo-HSCT. Results: Three months after allo-HSCT, the median lymphocyte count is 597/\u03bcL. Within the lymphocytes, the population of CD4+ cells is the most severely affected with a median of 122/\u03bcl and only 12% of the patients achieving normal CD4 values for age. Patients who received in vivo T-cell depletion have even lower age-related CD4 levels than those who did not receive this kind of immune modulation of the graft (p=0.02). The CD8+ cells are less affected, with normal CD8 counts and NK cells in 62% and 50% of the patients respectively. At 6 months post allo-HSCT, CD8+ reconstitution as well as NK count is normal in 76% of the pts, but CD4 cells are still severely impaired, with a median count of 265/\u03bcL and only 19% of the patients having normal counts.",

Laureys, C. Dhooge Ghent University Hospital (Ghent, BE) Introduction: Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) is a congenital disorder characterized by impairment of bone remodeling due to osteoclast dysfunction, resulting in impaired bone resorption with decrease of the bone marrow space. Clinical consequences include bone marrow failure and compression of cranial nerves leading to different neurological defi cits. Though genetically heterogenous, over 50% of ARO patients have mutations in the TCIRG1 gene, encoding the osteoclastspecifi c H\u00b1ATPase proton pump A3 subunit. So far the only available curative treatment is Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT). Here we describe the characteristics and outcome of 2 patients with ARO who received Cord Blood (CBU) as grafts. Patients and Methods: Two patients with confi rmed TCIRG1 ARO received allo-HSCT with CBU as graft in our Center. Patient's age, Transplant and CBU characteristics are summarized in the Table 1 . Patient 1 received 2 CBU, not as part of double CBU program but due to low viability (30%) of the 1st infused CBU. Discussion: Patients with osteopetrosis are characterized by having a high risk of graft failure, which has been more notorious using CBU as graft. However, in patients with ARO a prompt allo-HSCT is needed to prevent irreversible neurological impairment. We performed unrelated CBU in two patients lacking a HLA-matched donor. The allo-HSCT was successful in both cases without major complications. This suggest that allo-HSCT with CBU as graft is feasible and should be evaluated in those patients without a good matched donor. The CBU must have a good cellularity and the conditioning regimen should be fully myeloablative, for which we suggest the use of Busulfan (full dose), Fludarabine and Melphalan.",

Guidelines are being elaborated regarding the monitoring of immune recovery post HSCT, especially in heavily pre-treated patients. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the immune recovery in 7 children with very high risk leukemia 12 months and antigen proliferation between 12 and 36 months post HSCT. Antibody responses to all the antigens tested were normal at 12 months post HSCT; however, there was a continuing decline in all, especially to pneumococcal antibodies, resulting in non protective titers at 36 months, therefore necessitating booster vaccinations. Conclusions: We described a limited number of transplanted young pediatric patients with very high-risk leukemia. This small study confi rms that for heavily treated leukemia patients, complete immune recovery is achieved 3 years post HSCT. Nevertheless, antibody titers against protein and polysaccharide antigens are very low despite previous vaccinations. These patients should, therefore, receive booster vaccinations at three years post transplantation. We suggest that specifi c antibody responses be checked yearly in this group of patients.",

We analyzed HSCTs performed in our center over the last decade, with the aim to evaluate risk factors for aGVHD, scored according to Glucksberg and NIH criteria, and its infl uence on transplant-related mortality (TRM) and malignant recurrence. Patients and Methods: Data were analyzed as of June 11'. Recipients of 2nd or subsequent HSCT and of in vitro T-cell depleted graft were excluded from analysis.Recipient gender and age, diagnosis(malignant vs non-malignant), donor type (match-related donor-MRD vs AD), stem cells source (BM vs PBSC vs UCB), type of preparative regimen (myeloablative vs non-myeloablative: MA vs nMA) were considered as potential risk factors. Results: 197 pts (median age 8.5 yrs: range 0.3-18) were eligible for the study; 66% of HSCTs were performed for malignant diseases and AD was used in 72% of cases. BM was used in 81% (PBSC:6%; UCB:13%),whereas the majority of pts (76%) received MA regimen. Children who failed to engraft (6%) or died/relapsed before engraftment (3%) were excluded from the analysis, thus allowing 179 evaluable pts. AGVHD occurred after 134/179 (75%) HSCTs and classifi ed as follow: grades 0-I:48%; II-IV:52%; III-IV24%; classic 69%; persistent/recurrent/late onset:31%. In univariate analysis, none of the evaluated factors infl uenced the risk of developing severe Glucksberg grades of aGvHD; when evaluated according to NIH criteria, pts with malignancies and those receiving MA regimens resulted at increased risk for classic form of aGvHD (p<0.01). After a median follow-up of 3,4 yrs (range 0,07-11,3), probabilities of overall survival (OS) and TRM were 72% (CI: 64-78) and 15% (10-21), signifi cantly infl uenced by the degree of aGVHD (0-I:81% and 2%; II-IV:63% and 26%; p<0.05). In malignant disorders, more severe aGVHD correlated with a reduced risk of malignant recurrence (II-IV:19%; 0-I:28%) but also with increased TRM (II-IV:21%; 0-I:3%; p<0.01). In non-malignant disorders, degree of aGVHD signifi cantly infl uenced TRM and OS (p<0.01). Conclusions: In our experience, the probability of severe aGvHD was similar regardless of type of donor and source of stem cells, while children with malignancies and use of MA correlated with an increased risk for classic aGvHD. Children with non malignant diseases are best candidates to benefi t of novel approaches to prevent aGVHD. O. Lopez-Villar, F.M. Sanchez-Guijo, A. Benito, S. Muntion, E.M. Villaron, M.C. del Ca\u00f1izo University Hospital of Salamanca (Salamanca, ES) Introduction: The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the subset of paediatric patients is particularly scanty. In the literature, the MSC administered in these patients have been expanded using fetal calf serum, however in our institution we have implemented the expansion protocol from bone marrow derived MSC under GMP conditions using platelet lysate without any other supplementary factor in the culture medium and cryopreserving cells in AB plasma with 10% of DMSO. In the general practice, MSC are administered in our institution for adults that develop a complication of the allogeneic transplant of haematopoietic cells, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) or peripheral cytopenias. The use of cells is regulated by either clinical trials or compassionate use. However in children there is no clinical trial available, so there are no paediatric doses of MSC usually available. Objective: The aim of this work is to describe our experience using clinical grade bone marrow derived MSC (BM-MSC) in children, expanded using platelet lysate, cryopreserved and infusing them after thawing. Patients and Methods: Four children have been treated with BM-MSC. All of them had received a matched unrelated donor for the following diseases: major thalasemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, haemophagocytic syndrome and Hurler syndrome respectively.",

The exact age/weight in which washing is no longer necessary remains to be determined. Calcineurine inhibitors have played a major role in the immunosuppressive regimen in the stem cell transplant setting since their introduction in 1980. Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus are the two drugs in this class and are used in most transplant settings with out a major difference in their effi cacy. Both drugs act via the T cell activator protein calcineurine, inhibiting T cell activation and cytokine gene expression. Dyslipidemia occurs in 45% to 80% of solid organ transplantation patients on immunosuppressive therapy. Tacrolimus shows less frequent and milder effect on the lipid profi le compared to cyclosporine. There are no documented reports of dyslipidemia in any pediatric stem cell transplant patients to our knowledge. We report a case of Cyclosporine induced dyslipidemia in an 11 year old male patient. The patient received a matched sibling bone marrow following a preparative regimen of Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine and ATG to treat his idiopathic severe aplastic anemia. He received methotrexate day +1, +3 and +6 along with Cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis with the plan to continue Cyclosporine for at least 9 months due to his underlying disease. He had a family history of dyslipidemia with father on lipid lowering agents. His weight and BMI at the start of conditioning were 69.4 kg and 28.5 respectively. His pre-transplant full lipid profi le is unavailable but his serum triglyceride was normal at 150 mg/dl. At the time of engraftment he received 3 days of pulsed steroids for engraftment syndrome. During the fi rst month post transplant, his blood was persistently lipemic, creating diffi culty obtaining accurate chemistry panels. He failed a conservative approach to control his altered lipid levels with maximum triglyceride reaching 1117 mg/ dl. At 5 months following transplant, fi bric acid derivative was added and his cyclosporine was changed to Tacrolimus. His lipid profi le started trending down 4 weeks in to this change and is in the range of 200 mg/dl at this stage. He is on a tapering schedule of Tacrolimus and will be off in 1 month. Dyslipidemia can occur with calcineurine inhibitors in the pediatric stem cell transplant setting in high risk individuals. Monitoring for this potential complication is warranted in high risk indivi-duals. Tacrolimus may have an advantage over Cyclosporine in this setting.",

Messina (2) (1)University of Padua (Verona, IT); (2)Paediatric Hematology Oncology (Padua, IT) CMV infection is the most frequent viral complication in the early post-transplant period. In adults, the pre-emptive use of ganciclovir and foscarnet resulted comparable as effi cacy, the toxicity profi le being slightly different. Limited data are available on the safety and effi cacy of foscarnet in pediatric patients. We analyze retrospectively the risk factors, results of treatment, and outcome of CMV infection in 177 pediatric patients who had undergone a fi rst allogeneic HSCT between April 1997 and March 2009. CMV reactivation was defi ned by any positivity of pp65 early antigen on leukocytes or a DNAmia > 300 genomic copies/105 mononucleated cells. The incidence of CMV reactivation was 40% (70/177) at a median of 38 days (range: 3-118 days) after HSCT. In univariate analysis, CMV reactivation was associated to unrelated donor source of stem cells, conditioning regimen containing ATG, and GVHD prophylaxis with CSA-MTX (p<0.015). In multivariate analysis, the only factor that remained signifi cant for CMV reactivation was the prophylaxis with CSA-MTX whilst recipient/donor CMV seronegativity resulted protective for CMV reactivation (p<0.0018). Most of the episodes (52/70, 74%) were treated pre-emptively with foscarnet alone or in combination with ganciclovir (7/70, 10%). The remaining episodes (18/70, 26%) were treated only with ganciclovir. Overall, pre-emptive treatment with foscarnet or ganciclovir was well-tolerated. According to WHO scale, grade II and III renal toxicity was recorded in 8 and 2 patients, respectively, both treated with foscarnet. A complete resolution of CMV infection was obtained in 58/70 episodes (83%) whereas in 14 of 70 episodes (20%) there was a progression to CMV disease, i.e. 9 had interstitial pneumonia (1 patient had also pancreatitis and retinitis) and 5 patients had fever. Three of the 14 patients with CMV disease developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and died (21%). Importantly, no difference in 1-year OS was found between patients with or without CMV reactivation/infection: 71% vs 74% respectively, p = 0.69, I.C:95%. In conclusion, strict monitoring and pre-emptive treatment are a successful strategy also in pediatric patients. Despite the retrospective nature of the study, we provide evidence that foscarnet is a valid option to ganciclovir also in pediatric patients as fi rst-line treatment of CMV infection, renal toxicity being mild.",

Calore (5) (1)Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata (Verona, IT); (2) Objectives: To assess the effi cacy of pegfi lgrastim vs. daily fi lgrastim in pediatric patients who underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) by a randomized, multicenter, phase III, non inferiority study. Methods: The primary endpoint was the time to polimorphonuclear cell (PMN) engraftment. Patient sample size was calculated on the hyphotesis that a single dose of pegfi lgrastim of 100 ug/kg was not inferior to 9 or more doses of fi lgrastim of 5 ug/kg/day as time of PMN recovery. Platelet (PLT) engraftment, iatrogenic toxicity, and safety were secondary endpoints. Results: From May 2007 to June 2011 , 38 M, 23 F, were recruited in 4 centres: 29 pts were randomized to fi lgrastim arm and 32 pts to the pegfi lgrastim arm. Median age at PBSC transplantation was 11.5, range 1.6-17.4; median body weight was 36, range 9.6-106; 20% of patients were affected by lymphoma/leukaemia, 80% by solid tumours; 79% of patients were in complete remission (32) or in very good partial remission (16) at PBSC infusion. The median value of CD34+ infused was 6.4x 10 6 /kg, range 3-300. The mean time to PMN engraftment was 10.48 days (standard deviation (SD) 1.57) and 10.44 days (SD 2.44) in fi lgrastim and pegfi lgrastim group, respectively. Having fi xed a non inferiority margin Delta = 3, the primary endpoint was reached, determining the non inferiority of pegfi lgrastim. Other enpoints in the fi lgrastim and pegfi lgrastim group were as follows: PLT engraftment, 100% vs. 97%; median time to recovery to PLT > 50 x 10 9 /L, 22 days, range 10-84 vs. 28 days, range 10-132; one or two episodes of FUO, 79% vs. 78%; proven infection, 34% vs.28%; WHO grade II-IV mucositis, 76% vs. 59% . No signifi cant differences were found in terms of toxicity between 2 arms and no toxic death was reported within the fi rst 100 days post-PBSCT. After a median follow-up of 2.3 years (95% C.I.: 1.5-3.3) , 20 deaths were observed, 9 in the fi lgrastim and 11 in the pegfi lgrastim group, all due to progression of disease. Conclusion: A single dose of pegfi lgrastim is not inferior to daily fi lgrastim in pediatric patients who underwent PBSCT. Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) has been reported usually in neonatal period, but may have been seen in immunocompromized patients such as patients after organ transplantation at older children age. The etiology of PI is thought to be mechanical cause or bacterial infection, but has not been known yet. Case: A 10 year old female girl diagnosed as severe aplastic anemia, who has CMV (Cytomegalovirus) seropositive. She was transplanted with peripheral stem cell from a matched (6/6 high resolution human leukocyte antigens) unrelated donor who has CMV seropositive. The conditioning regimens used at transplantation were Busulfan, Fludarabine, ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin). She was neutrophil engrafted at D (day) +12 after transplantion. GVHD (graft versus host disease) was developed from D+15 and Grade III GI (gastro-intestinal) GVHD and has been controlled with methyl-prednisolone and tacrolimus. The symptom of GI GVHD was wax and wane. At D+114 abdominal pain and distention was developed and at D+115 she got mild fever and watery diarrhea with blood tinged stool. We treated with methyl-prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg and tacrolimus 0.003 mg/kg intravenous injection. At D+116, PI was detected on simple abdominal X-ray and CT (computed tomography), Conservative management such as NPO (nothing per oral) and transfusion was maintained. Vital sign was stable, distended abdomen but tenderness was not severe at physical examination. CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR (erythrocyte sediment ratio) was not elevated. Ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice a day) was injected intravenously because CMV antigenemia was detected at D+117. AT D+119, PI sign was disappeared on simple abdominal X-ray, and hematochezia decreased gradually. No bacteria was detected at Stool culture, and clostridium diffi cile toxin A test was negative, CMV antigenemia was disappeared by the day after using of ganciclovir for 10 days. Conclusion: We describe a 10 year old female who developed PI with CMV infection suffered from gastro-intestinal graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation due to severe aplastic anemia and was treated with ganciclovir successfully.",

M\u00fcller Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, DK) Pulmonary complications are associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality following stem cell transplantation (SCT), but reported incidence and severity is highly variable. This retrospective study describes lung function in a national paediatric cohort that underwent regular monitoring starting one month pre-SCT. Methods: Children aged 6-16 years at SCT from 1990 to 2010 (n=180) were included. Lung function tests performed pre-SCT and subsequently [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and beyond 18 months post-SCT were collected, and included forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO), all presented as percent predicted. Results: Median age at inclusion was 9.8 years (range 6-15.8). At 3 months post-SCT a signifi cant decrease in FEV1 (mean 89.1 vs. 79.2%), FVC (87.5 vs. 78.3%) and DLCO (77.1 vs. 67.4%) (Wilcoxon paired sum test p<0.001) was observed compared to baseline. This decline persisted after 9-18 months in FEV1 (82.4%) and FVC (81.7%) (p< 0.001). However, at last assessment beyond 18 months, lung function did not differ signifi cantly from pre-SCT levels. The proportion of patients with FEV1 <80% at 3-9 months was higher among patients with acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD n=114) (52.9 vs. 32.6%, p=0.05) and CMV mismatch (64.5 vs. 38.2%, p=0.018) (Fisher exact test), a difference that persisted beyond 18 months (GvHD; 49.9 vs. 19.2%, p=0.035, CMV mismatch; 50 vs. 25%, p=0.038). Eighteen months post-SCT, aGvHD patients had a reduced FEV1 compared to baseline (mean 84.7 vs. 91.5%, p=0.025).",

            "text": "S374 HLA-mismatch was more common among patients with reduced DLCO (<80%) at 3-9 months (91.9 vs. 67.7%, p=0.015) and 9-18 months (82.8 vs.47.8% p=0.016) . Older age at SCT was associated with DLCO reduction at 9-18 months (10 vs. 12.6 years, p=0.004) and beyond 18 months (10 vs. 12.6 years, p=0.002). Variables without association to lung function included sex mismatch, source of stem cells, diagnosis, conditioning with total body irradiation or busulfan p.o (n=26) or i.v. (n=36), Karnofsky score and donor/recipient CMVstatus. Conclusions: Marked transient reduction in FEV1, FVC and DLCO appears to affect the majority of children undergoing SCT. FEV1 reduction appears to be more common and persistent in patients with aGvHD and in CMV-mismatched transplants, while DLCO reduction is associated with HLA-mismatch. Interestingly, we found no association between decreased lung function and busulfan treatment. Objectives: Vitamin D (vD) has a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and normal bone structure. Several studies reported vD defi ciency as a long-term effect of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) because of reduction in sun exposure, lack of vD in diet, steroid therapy and altered gastrointestinal absorption consequent to intestinal GVHD after HSCT. Little is known about early modifi cations of vD levels following HSCT and its correlation with bone mineral density (MBD). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of vD status of 31 paediatric pts (19 male) who underwent 42 HSCT (35 allogeneic, 7 autologous) treated in our Institution for cancer and haematologic diseases between 2006 and 2011. The serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were determined before HSCT and every 3 months for 1 year after HSCT. In addition 6 months after HSCT, BMD modifi cations were analyzed by Dual-Energy x-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) that allows a non-invasive assessment of bone mineral content. No pts were receiving vD supplements. Median age at HSCT was 9 (range 5-12). vD status was classifi ed on the basis of 25(OH)D serum level according to value reported by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as: Defi ciency: <15 ng/ml, Insuffi ciency: 15-29 ng/ml, Adequate: >30 ng/ml. Results: Median pre-HSCT 25(OH)D serum concentration was 24.6 ng/ml (range 12-55.1), with 1 pt/31 (3%) showing defi cient levels, 23/31 (74%) insuffi cient and 7 (23%) adequate levels. Median concentration of 25(OH)D post-HSCT was 13.4 (range 6. 3-36.4) [P<0.0001]: 21 pts (68%) has deficient serum level, 7 (22%) insuffi cient and 3 (10%) adequate (Table 1) . BMD evaluated by DXA 6 months after HSCT showed a trend in line with 25(OH)D serum level: Z-score of global BMD was evocative of osteopenia in 15/31 (48%) pts (range -1.1/-2.1) and of osteoporosis in 1/31 (3%) pt (-2.9). Z-score calculated at lumbar vertebrae revealed osteopenia in 4/31 (13%) pts (range -1.1/-2.3) and osteoporosis in 1 pt (-2.6). Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed that 25(OH)D serum level decreases markedly and precociously in children treated with HSCT and this is associated with an early reduction of global BMD in nearly 50% of the patients at DXA evaluation. These fi ndings suggest the importance of early monitoring of vD status and BMD in HSCT patients in order to start vD supplementation able to prevent severe vD defi ciency and its complications.",

He responded to immunoglobulin and prednisolone with minor evident haemolysis. But he hasn't subsequently done well and progressed to pancytopaenia with further haemolysis after 30 days from the first haemolysis, despite full chimerism. Bone marrow biopsy at day +76 revealed aplastic anemia. He failed to respond supportive care and donor leucocyte infusion (DLI) and died from pulmonary hemorrhage. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a very early onset nonalloimmune warm antibodies associated hemolytic anemia. The time course of hemolysis and full chimerism of the recipient in the case suggest that the antibody was produced by donor-derived lymphocytes. Warm type autoantibodies associated with non-alloimmune haemolysis are relatively difficult to treat. Considering the very poor prognosis of TCD, haplo-identical HSCT patients who develop this complication it is very important to choose and perform the most appropriate treatment for the patient immediately.",

Patients and Methods: The 33 children have been included in our study. All patients received GVHD prophylaxis after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): for pts with ALL / MDS/ CML/ CMML/ NHL/AF consist of CSA and MTX; for pts with SAA -CSA+MMF; for pts with AML -CSA and MTX, for pts with AF methylprednisolone + tacrolimus. For the treatment of GVHD all pts received methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg, however developed steroidresistant acute (grade II-IV) and chronic extensive GVHD. Patients were divided into two groups: 1 group -22 patients (median age was 10,6 years, male/ female: 18/4) with AML-5, MDS-1, NHL-1, ALL-9, SAA/AF-6 were underwent MSCs infusions after HSCT for treatment of steroid-resistant acute or chronic GVHD. Ten pts received MSCs once and twelve -twice. The median first dose of MSCs was 1,7 (0.5-5.4)x10 6 /kg and second dose -1,0 (0.7-2.5)x10 6 /kg. The MSCs were derived from bone marrow of HSCs donors (HLA-identical donors) (n = 10) and third-party HLA-mismatched donors (n = 12). 2 group -11 children, (median age was 15 years, male/ female: 5/6) with AML-2, ALL-4, SAA/ AF-3, HML-1, HMML-1, who weren't received MSC presented as the control. Results: No patients had side-effects during or immediately after the infusions of MSCs. The incidence of death from GVHD amounted to 9,1% in group of patients given MSCs (2 pts died from GVHD and sepsis) compare with 55% in group of children which received immunosuppressive therapy alone (6 pts died from GVHD) (p=0,02). Median duration of survival from allogenic HSCT was 33 (6-58) months in group of patients with MSCs and 5 (2-65) months in group pts with out MSC (p=0,02). Immunosuppressive drug were withdrawal in 10 pts from 22 children which have got MSC and in 1 pts without MSCs. Conclusion: This study confi rm rational of MSC administration for treatment of steroid-resistant GVHD for reduction death from DVHD and increase of duration of survival from allo genic HSCT in children. Our date suggest that MSCs infusion allows completely withdrawal immunosuppressive therapy in most patients of steroid-resistant GVHD.",

Benoit, V. Bordon, C. Dhooge Ghent University Hospital (Ghent, BE) Background: The focus of care for transplanted patients has partially been switched to Quality of Life(QoL) within this population. The long term impact of hematopoietic transplantation is more documented in adults. Pediatric patients are a growing point of interest. A multidisciplinary follow-up started in september 2010 to evaluate QoL. We wanted to adress the degree of physical and psychosocial rehabilitation. Additional to logg the data resulting in psychological distress, social dysfunctioning and underachievement at school or work. And fi nally to get visibility on the individual sympton burden. Methods: The objective was to collect relevant data and to improve patient care. 36 patients(pre-school to young adults) were seen on the outpatient consultation. The time since transplant ranged between 1 and 17 years, with most of them between 2 and 5 years (16 patients) and between 5 and 10 years (15 patients). Initially we wanted to collect both, quantitative and qualitative data. The PedsQL (4.0 Generic core scales and the PedsQL 3.0 cancer module) generally used to evaluate QoL during active treatment were not suitable for a long term follow up. Although we have a better instrument for this purpose, it could yet not be used as it has to be adapted for our Dutch-speaking population. A semi-structured interview to question the different life domains was done by the transplantnurse and psychologist parallel to the medical consultation. Results: In general the QoL is relatively good, but with a variety of residual diffi culties in a number of patients. These are situated in the area of less endurance and more fatigue, lack of energy, sleep problems, nightmares and fl ash-backs and problems with physical appearance. Emotionally they report feelings of loneliness, sadness and anger, worrier thoughts, feeling otherwise than peers and sometimes diffi culties in social interaction. On the cognitive level we registered learning problems and a lower capacity in terms of attention and concentration with a potential impact on the choice of study and type of work. Conclusions and Future Objectives: A multidisciplinary long term follow-up is essential for both research purposes as a better patient care. Our aims are to continue with baseline and regular measurements for QoL before and after transplantation. Additional, collecting quantitative data with an appropriate instrument. And eventually the drafting of curative and preventive protocols.",

            "text": "Variable clinical presentation and HSCT outcome in patients with infantile osteopetrosis among two ethnic groups E. Sakharovskaya (1) Background: Osteopetrosis (OP) is a descriptive term that refers to a group of rare, heritable disorders of the skeleton characterized by increased bone density results from abnormalities in osteoclast differentiation or function. Recently it was shown an unusually high prevalence of OP in the Middle Volga basin (Chuvashia, Russia) and an unique splice site mutation c.807+5G>A at the TCIRG1 in 11 Chuvashian patients (Bliznetz et al., 2009) . Until recently, HSCT was not used to treat OP patients in Russia. Aims: (1) comparing OP phenotype of Middle Volga basin and Middle East areas; (2) evaluating the role of the conditioning protocol in HSCT outcome. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated clinical presentation of OP in 43 patients: 17 from Russia and 26 from Israel. Results: While the age at diagnosis was almost the same (average 6.5 vs 8 mo), the structure of symptoms was statistically signifi cant, p=0.004 (Figure 1 ). Despite high prevalence of at least one neurological symptom at the median age in this group was 40 mo (range from 5 to 86 mo) without transplantation 10/17 patients have relatively mild disease course and still have no intellectual damage and therefore can be good candidates for BMT. One possible explanation of this difference could be different genetic background. In 13/14 Chuvashian children c.807+5G>A mutation was found (8/13 are homozygose); with two patients 4 new TCIRG1 mutations were detected (data not presented). One patient of Ukrainian origin was screened for Chuvashian mutation and found to be negative. Subsequently different mutations in TCIRG1 were found. Three patients were already transplanted in St. Petersburg (Russia), are alive and well up to 36 months. Analysis of 26 patients transplanted at Hadassah (Israel) showed signifi cant (p=0.0153) improvement of survival rate with those transplanted 2000-ies vs 1983 to 1999 (Figure 2 ). The introduction of fl udarabine-based conditioning protocol in all resent subgroup of the patients makes the major difference between these two groups. Conclusions: Bone marrow transplantation can be considered for older age OP, especially if the patient is intellectually saved. Screening for c.807+5G>A TCIRG1 mutation is reasonable as the fi rst step approach but not enough for genetic counseling in extended Volga basin population. Experience with different conditioning protocols planned to be used for subsequent PBSC/BMT.",

Patients and Methods: From 9/1998-9/2011, we performed 89 ASCT, 26 HL pts (29%), male 18/female 8 (r2,25-1), median age at ASCT was 13,5 years (r7-18y), stage at diagnosis: II 9 pts (34,5%), III 7pts (27%), IV 10 pts (38,5%), Bulky disease 6pts (23%), B symptoms 19 pts (73%). Histology: nodular sclerosis 18 pts (69,3%), mixed cellularity 6 pts (23%), lymphocyte depletion 2 pt (7,7%). Previous treatments COPP-ABVD 14 pts (54%), AVBD 9 pts (35%), others (11%). 17 pts (65,4%) received additional radiotherapy in involved areas. Rescued protocols: ESHAP 8 pts (30,7%), IEP/ABVD 7 pts (27%), ICE 4 pts (15,3%), others 7 pts (27 %). Status at ASCT: 1st CR 2 pts, 2nd CR 17 pts, 3rd CR 2 pts and PR 5 pts. Results: Median time from diagnosis to relapse was 26.2 months, (r 8-83 m), median time from relapsed to ASCT 10 months (r 4-29 m). Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) was used in all patients, 15 pts received CPM/G-CSF and 11 pts only G-CSF. Median CD34 was 5,85x10 6 Kg (1, 3) and median TNC was 16,43x 10 8 Kg (2, 1) . Conditioning regimens were CVB in 24 pts (92,3%), others 2 pts (7,7%) ARA-C/Mel/Carmustine 1 pt and Bu/Cy/Mel 1pt Median time neutrophil engraftment (\u2265500/10 9 \u00d7 L) was 10,9 days (9-33d), and for platelets (\u226520/10 9 \u00d7 L) 15,5 days (9-33d). The TRM was 0%. At 120 months the KM probability of overall survival (OS) was 0.66\u00b10.13%, and event free survival (EFS) 0.62\u00b10.13%. for those patients in CR at ASCT, the OS was 0.68\u00b10.14 and the EFS 0.64\u00b1013, in PR 0.66\u00b10.27 and 0.67\u00b10.27 respectively, (log rank NS). Cumulative incidence of relapse: 38%. Conclusions: ASCT in HL in CR or PR is an effective and safe procedure. In our preliminary analysis the status of disease did not impact on the results, but longer follow-up is necessary. S378 to be possibly associated with the onset of seizures (infections, cerebral disease, bleeding, drug toxicity, hypomagnesaemia). Aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate incidence and features of crises in children tranplanted c/o our center during the last ten years. Methods: 345 HSCT procedures (180 autologus, 155 allogeneic, 10 haploidentical) in 261 consecutive children tranplanted between 2000 and 2010 have been reviewed. The medical history, transplant variables, EEG and neuroimaging of patients between 0 and 18 years with a defi nite diagnosis of seizures within one year after transplant were analyzed. Results: 27/261 (10.34%) patients had seizures, of these, 23 received allogeneic and 4 autologous HSCT. Nine patients (33%) are still alive and well after a follow-up of six years, eighteen patients (67%) are died ( Table 1 ). The etiology of the crisis was: reversible posterior encephalopathy (PRES) in 14, CNS infections in 4, dimethyl sulfoxide toxicity in one case. 4 patients had epilepsy secondary to underlying disease and in other 4 we have not been able to identify the etiology. The crises have raised an average of 100 days after HSCT [-2, +352] . Crises often begin with ocular and visual signs and/or symptoms, particularly in PRES. 14/27 patients had status epilepticus (SE), in 5 cases non-convulsive; 12 of them were cases of PRES. 83% of patients with SE needed for intensive care life support. In children with PRES, both critical and postcritical EEG showed peculiar abnormalities in the electrical activity prevailing on the posterior regions, in others there was not a specifi c pattern EEG. Conclusions: Our data confi rm that crises are a common and severe complication of HSCT they are a poor prognostic indicator. PRES is the most common cause of crisis. At the onset ocular and visual signs and symptoms are often present. These features tend to be of long duration and they are related to EEG abnormalities on posterior regions. The recognition of this pattern is suggestive, so the use of a close EEG monitoring could be useful for making a correct diagnosis, treatment and management of these patients.",

Masetti (1) Objectives: Hepatic conditions like steatosis, haemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) are rare in children but are reported to be common after intensive treatment for pediatric cancer and particularly after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Many risk factors linked to the HSCT procedure like mediactions, infection, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, acute and chronic GVHD, and iron overload, have been identifi ed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In most of these conditions the biochemical parameters of liver function are normal. Here we report how a prospective serial ultrasound (US) monitoring of the liver can detect hepatic abnormalities in children with normal liver function after HSCT. Methods: A pre-HSCT liver US and serial liver US at 3 or 6-monthly intervals for a median time of 3 years after HSCT has been performed in 70 children c/o our Institution between 2006 and 2011. Three-monthly assessment of liver function was evaluated by serological determination of transaminases, gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, ferritine, albumin and coagulation status.",

In the pre-HSCT evaluation 6/70 pts presented mild hepatomegaly without steatosis and 1/70 pts presented signs of iron overload. In the post HSCT US evaluation, 4/6 pts with hepatomegaly presented normal liver size after a median FUP time of 8 months while the others persisted with hepatomegaly over 2 years. The signs of iron overload progressively decreased and were no more evident after 2 years. Twenty new diagnoses (see Table  1 for clinical features) of hepatic abnormalities were performed: 3/70 (4.2%) and 9/70 (12.8%) presented hepatomegaly alone and associated to steatosis respectively, while 3/70 (4.2%) had mild hepatic fi brosis. In 2/70 (2.8%) pts a hemangioma not previously detected was diagnosed. Three out of 70 pts (4.2%) developed a FNH at a median FUP time of 30 months. No NRH, cirrosis or malignant neoplasms of the liver were detected. All of the 20/70 (25.5%) cases with hepatic abnormalities were asymptomatic and the liver function was normal. Conclusions: Serial post-HSCT liver US is a useful tool to facilitate diagnosis of novel hepatic benign conditions in absence of any signs of liver dysfunction. In transplanted children steatosis and FNH appear to be the most common abnormalities.",

            "text": "Introduction: Busulfan is commonly used in preparative conditioning regimens prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children and young adults for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. For many years Busulfan was only available in an oral form, resulting in large inter-and intra-patients variability in plasma exposure, associated with higher graft failure rate as well as higher toxicity such as veno-occlusive disease. With the development of an intravenous formulation of Busulfan, a more accurate control of both the inter-and intrapatient variability has been provided. Objectives: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use and effi cacy of intravenous Busulfan (BuIV) in comparison with the oral formulation (BuPO) in children undergoing an autologous transplantation after conditioning with Busulfan. Methods: Twenty-seven paediatric patients who underwent autologous HSCT between January 2008 and December 2010 in Belgium and received intravenous or oral busulfan as part of their conditioning regimen were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The diagnosis included Ewing Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma and Burkitt Lymphoma. Epidemiologic and transplantation data were collected using the EBMT database (form A). Results: Bu was administered in all children as part of their conditioning regimens before transplantation. Twelve patients received oral Bu and 15 patients intravenous Bu. All except 2 patients received standard Bu-Mel regimen followed by autologous HSCT as consolidation therapy. One patient received additional doses of Aracytine and one patient Bu alone. The use of a 5-level dose schedule defi ned by body weight resulted in an effi cient engraftment with marked reduction in the incidence of veno-occlusive disease in the BuIV group compared with BuPO (p=0.028). In terms of disease-free outcome, survival and event-free survival, similar results have been obtained in both groups. Conclusion: Despite the small number of patients, this study confi rmed the apparent benefi t of intravenous Busulfan in children undergoing an autologous HSCT. The choice of this formulation of Busulfan should therefore be considered.",

C. Pasqualini, C. Dufour, G. Goma, M. Raquin, D. Valteau-Couanet Institut Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, FR) The administration of Bu-Mel and ASCT has been recently demonstrated to allow the best prognosis for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL-1 SIOPEN Study). However, patients with less than a partial remission after 2 lines of conventional chemotherapy and adolescents and considered as very high risk (VHR) patients. We developed an intensifi ed HDC strategy with 2 courses of HDC to improve VHR patients prognosis. The fi rst course consisted in thiotepa (300 mg/m 2 /d x3) followed by ASCT. In absence of major toxicity or disease progression, a 2nd course of melphalan (140 mg/m 2 ) Busulphan (600 mg/m 2 ) and ASCT was administered 2 months later. From April 1986 to April 2009, 22 patients (12 males, 10 females), median age 3.5 y (0.9-15.9) entered this programme. 20/22 had less than a partial remission after conventional chemo therapy. 2 were adolescents with a metastatic CR, 1 had a MYCN amplifi ed tumour. Thiotepa-related toxicity was mainly digestive with a grade >2 mucositis and diarrhoea in 14 and 16 patients, respectively. Hospitalisation duration was 25 days (19-49). Bu-Mel was administered in 18 patients since 4 patients had a progressive disease after thiotepa. Toxicity was digestive with a grade >2 mucositis and diarrhoea in 13 and 7/18 patients, respectively and hepatic with 6/18 hepatic veno occlusive disease. Toxic related death occurred in 1 patient due to alveolar haemorrhage. The 3-year EFS survival is 42.6% (24-64). This intensifi ed HDC strategy in VHR patients seems to be feasible and to improve survival. It will be compared to a combined mIBG-Bu-Mel strategy in the future VHR neuroblastoma European Protocol. Radio-labelled 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) therapy is used in the treatment of high risk neuroblastoma as a part of conditioning regimen in combination with other chemotherapeutics. The maximum-tolerated dose of 131I-MIBG was reported as 12 mCi/kg. However, mucositis as well as myelosuppression was the major toxicity. 131I-MIBG may increase the toxicity of the drugs combinated. Herein, we report and discuss I131 MIBG dose and toxicity on two children that were treated with 131I-MIBG, followed by myeloablative doses of carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan with stem cell rescue. First case, a 9-month-old female presented with right abdominal palpable mass. She was diagnosed with stage IV neuroblastoma and treated with chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide, cisplatin, dacarbazine, ifosfamide, and adriamycine for 6 courses in addition to surgical resection resulting with a 2 cms residual right adrenal mass. She underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), including 100 mCi (10 mCi/kg) 131 I-MIBG treatment on day -21 and melphalan 45 mg/m 2 /day; on day -8 to -5, etoposide 200 mg/m 2 /day, carboplatine 300 mg/m 2 /day; on day -5 to -2 . On day +15, she presented with grade 4 mucositis and massive gastrointestinal bleeding without any evidence of engrafment. After all vigorous efforts, she died on day +18.",

Juergens University Children\u00b4s Hospital (M\u00fcnster, DE) Objective: In the last decade, treosulfan has increasingly been used in pediatric high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) regimens prior to autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) mainly for its antitumour activity and its favourable toxicity profi le compared to busulfan. In this single-institution analysis, we have studied the observed toxicities following treosulfan-containing high dose chemotherapy protocols with the aim to identify risk factors related to patient or disease characteristics as well as to the drug itself. Methods: 25 patients, age 1-17 years, mean 8.3 years, with solid tumours (21; neuroblastoma 9, Ewing sarcoma 8, soft tissue sarcoma 4) and haematological malignancies (4; acute leukaemia 3, lymphoma 1), were assessed for toxicities within 100 days after autologous or allogeneic HSCT with treosulfancontaining high dose chemotherapy regimens. Results: All patients (pts) engrafted. Treosulfan was administered according to body surface area (BSA) in a dose range of 36-42 g/m\u00b2. The equivalent kg BW (body weight)-based dose revealed a wide span of 875-1980 mg/kg. Within the group receiving more than 1400 mg/kg BW (higher dose group), 8/9 children were \u22644years and \u2264 18 kg of weight. The most frequent diagnoses in this higher dose/kg BW group were solid tumours (7/9). Stomatitis grades 3/4 were diagnosed in 14/25 (56%) pts, but in 7/9 (78%) in the higher dose group. Hyperbilirubinemia grades 3/4 and veno-occlusive disease (2 pts) were exclusively observed in the higher dose group. With one exception, respiratory events grade 2 (4/5 pts) were only detected in the higher dose group. Adverse events requiring intensive care unit care occurred in 3 pts, 2 of these in the higher dose group. In the higher dose group 3/9 (33%) pts have relapsed or are dead, in the lower dose group 13/16 (81%). Conclusions: In children above a body weight of 18 kg, calculating treosulfan according to BSA is associated with a favourable toxicity profi le. In children with a BW of <18 kg a BSA-based dosing schedule is associated with higher toxicities. Body weight adapted dosing schedules need to be established for this group of younger patients. More patients in the higher dose group were in remission at the time of evaluation; however, in this cohort of heterogeneous diagnoses and treatment protocols no further conclusion is possible.",

Patients and Methods: Patients with solid tumors treated with high-dose thiotepa with ASCT at Institute Gustave Roussy between May 1987 and March 2011 were retrospectively identifi ed through the pediatric transplantation database. Clinico-biological data were collected and neurological adverse events (NAE) were identifi ed from medical and nursing records. Toxicity was graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 classifi cation. Results: 251 patients received 307 courses (56 patients received twice) of high-dose thiotepa (600 mg/m\u00b2: 82 courses; 720 mg/m\u00b2: 76 courses; 900 mg/m\u00b2: 149 courses) with ASCT for a solid tumor. The median age was 8.33 years (range, 1-31.2 years). 67 NAE (22%) were described in the nursing records, and 37 (12%) in medical records. In 22 courses, NAE were considered possibly related to thiotepa. In these 22 NAE, neurological symptoms appeared at a median time of 2 days (range, 0-4 days) after the introduction of thiotepa. The neurological symptoms were tremor in 4 patients, seizure in 6 patients, pyramidal tract syndrome in 2 patients, cerebellar syndrome in 3 patients, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome grade 2 in 1 patient, headache, dizziness and confusion in 4 patients, blurred vision, diplopia, nystagmus and eye pain in 4 patients, and coma in 1 case. These events disappeared without sequelea in a median time of 3 days (range, 1-8 days). After these NAE, thiotepa was reintroduced in 7 cases. One patient had tremor grade 2 and syncope grade 3, one child had headache grade 3. Three patients who presented seizure during the fi rst course of thiotepa, received clonazepam during the second course. Thus, reintroduction of thiotepa was carried out without NAE for 5 of 7 patients. Conclusion: In our study, the incidence of NAE related to thiotepa was 7.2%. The evolution was favorable without sequelea in all cases. Thiotepa could be reintroduced after NAE. To continue our research, we will perform a correlation analysis to fi nd potential risk factors to develop NAE related to thiotepa.",

            "text": "Quantifi cation of sulfolane, a metabolite of busulfan in plasma by gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry: a new method for evaluating the role of sulfolane and metabolic fate of busulfan C. Uppugunduri (1) Busulfan (Bu) is commonly used as a component of conditioning regimen in pediatric patients before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Bu undergoes metabolism by conjugation with glutathione conjugating enzymes yielding intermediary unstable metabolites sulfonium ion and tetrahydrothiophene (THT). Tetrahydrothiophene undergoes oxidation into sulfolane (Su) which is relatively stable than THT. The role played by these metabolites on the events seen during busulfan treatment is not completely known. Lack of established analytical methods for estimation of busulfan metabolites limits our understanding of their role. Measurement of unstable metabolites may not be possible for routine investigations, because of the special precautions and procedures. Hence, we attempted to develop a new method for the measurement of Su by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric assay (GC-MS/MS) along with Bu. Bu and Su were simultaneously extracted from 100 micro liters of plasma by ethyl acetate. Two separated GC runs were developed for Bu and Su. MS detection of the analytes was performed in the selected reaction monitoring mode on a triple quadrupole instrument after electronic impact ionization. The method was validated for the concentration range of 50-2000 ng/mL for Bu and 40-400 ng/mL for Su. In a preliminary study, clinical samples taken from two children after doses 1, 2, 3, and 9 showed to have detectable levels of Su in plasma starting from four hours after the fi rst dose. We observed increased levels of Su after the 9th dose of Bu (greater than 200 ng/mL) in the plasma of a children receiving Bu prior to HSCT. Later, sulfolane was analyzed in EBMT cohort plasma samples collected 4 hours after 1st dose (n=46), before 7th dose (n=57) and after 9th dose infusion (n=54). We observed mean sulfolane values of 24.6, 181 and 249.9 ng/mL, at 4 hours after 1st dose, before 7th dose and after 9th dose infusion, respectively. The mean busulfan levels measured at these three time points were 266 (n=68), 393 (n=63), and 1271 ng/mL (n=57). Clinical studies may adopt this novel method for investigating busulfan metabolic fate and its mechanisms of toxicity. Understanding the kinetics of sulfolane in subjects undergoing busulfan infusion and its role in the adverse effects seen with busulfan is possible with this method.",

            "text": "Haematologic recovery in tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in children with high-risk solid tumours: platelet and RBC recovery are signifi cantly delayed in the second transplantation M.H. Son, D.H. Kim, N.H. Lee, H.W. Chueh, S.H. Lee, K.H. Yoo, K.W. Sung, H. Koo, D.W. Kim Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, KR) Background: Recently, reports employing tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/ autoSCT) for the treatment of high-risk pediatric solid tumor are increasing. Stem cell dose in tandem HDCT/autoSCT is generally lower than that in single HDCT/autoSCT. However, data about hematologic recovery during tandem HDCT/autoSCT, particularly in relation to CD34+ cells dose, are very limited to date. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the hematologic recovery in 236 children with high-risk solid tumors who underwent tandem HDCT/autoSCT between April 1998 and June 2011. Results: The median numbers of CD34+ cells transplanted in the fi rst and second HDCT/autoSCT were 4.24x10 6 /kg and 3.99x10 6 /kg (P=0.653). There was no difference in neutrophil recovery between the fi rst and second HDCT/autoSCT (median 10 days vs. 10 days to reach absolute neutrophil count of 500/uL, P=0.134). However, platelet and RBC recovery were signifi cantly delayed in the second HDCT/autoSCT. The median time to reach a platelet count of 20,000/uL without transfusion for the previous 7days in the fi rst and second HDCT/autoSCT were 22 (range 8-79) days and 28 (range 13-596) days, respectively (P<0.001). The median time for RBC recovery (fi rst day of hemoglobin \u22658.0 g/dL without transfusion for previous 28 days) in the fi rst and second HDCT/autoSCT were 40 (range 30-132) days and 44 (range 31-452) days, respectively (P=0.001). Similarly, the number of platelet and RBC transfusion were higher in the second HDCT/autoSCT than in the fi rst HDCT/autoSCT (median 7 vs. 9, P<0.001; median 3 vs. 4, P=0.001). Differences in hematologic recovery and transfusion requirement were more signifi cant when the analysis was confi ned to patients who were transplanted with CD34+ cells less than 5x10 6 /kg, particularly less than 2x10 6 /kg. Accordingly, ferritin levels at 1 year after tandem HDCT/autoSCT were higher in patients who were transplanted with CD34+ cells less than 2x10 6 /kg (median 1149.2 vs 739.65 mg/mL, P<0.004). Conclusion: Our results strongly support the notion that further modalities of collecting more CD34+ cells must be researched in order to accelerate hematologic recovery after tandem HDCT/autoSCT, reduce transfusion amount, lower ferritin level, and possibly decrease organ dysfunction related to iron overload in patients with high-risk solid tumors. Objectives: Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been considered a curative treatment modality for primary immunodefi ciency diseases (PIDs), data on allo-HSCT for PIDs are scarce in Korea. This study was aimed to evaluate the feasibility of allo-HSCT for various PIDs. Methods: We have performed 14 transplants for 12 patients with PIDs. For X-linked severe combined immune defi ciency (X-SCID), small volume of donor marrow was infused without conditioning and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. For non-SCID, busulfan-based conditioning regimen was applied and GVHD prophylaxis was variable according to the source of stem cells. Results: The underlying diseases were X-SCID (n=3), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS; n=3), hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM; n=2), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD; n=2), and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL; n=2). An HLA-identical sibling donor was available in 6 patients and the other half received grafts from alternative donors. Their median age at transplant was 3.6 y (range, 0.3-13.2). Nine patients achieved sustained engraftment, one of whom died of severe chronic GVHD. Of 3 patients who had poor graft function, one died of cytomegalovirus pneumonia and one of the other two who received second transplantation was successfully rescued. All 3 deaths exclusively occurred among those who received alternative donor graft. Ultimately, 9 out of 12 patients are alive disease-free with a median follow-up of 56 mo (range, 2-167). All X-SCID patients achieved normal lymphocyte counts and immunoglobulin levels as well as normal lymphocyte proliferative response to mitogen. Two CGD patients showed normal dihydrorhodamine test at 2 mo post-transplant. Conclusion: Allo-HSCT was feasible as a curative modality for both SCID and non-SCID. Given the high transplant-related mortality following alternative donor transplants, whether transplant or not should be determined carefully after weighing the pros and cons especially if matched familial donor is not available. Objectives: Primary immunodefi ciency diseases (PID) are rare but associated with high mortality rate due to infectious problems. As the vast majority of PID patients are affected by infection at the time of transplantation and the use of myeloablative conditioning regimens may lead to higher mortality rate, we conducted a prospective study of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) as preparation for patients. Methods: Twenty-eight patients (8 female, 20 male) who had undergone allo-HSCT between 2006 and 2010 were enrolled in the study. Eleven patients received stem cell from healthy full human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched siblings, 7 from HLA matched other related donors (4 patients from parents, 2 from grandfather and one from uncle), three from their haploidentical parents and 7 from unrelated donors. Stem cells were collected from the bone marrow (n=7), peripheral blood (n=14) and cord blood (n=7). Median age at HSCT was 19 months (4 months-14 years). The various types of diseases observed in patients were Leukocyte Adhesion Defi ciency type one (n=12), Wiskott Aldrich Syndrom (n=6), Griscelli syndrome (n=3), Severe Combined Immunodefi ciency (n=2), Chediak-higashi, Familial Erythrophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and primary CD4 defi ciency (n=1). All patients were conditioned with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen containing fl udarabine, melfalan and antithymocyte globulin. For graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, cyclosporine plus prednisolone at the standard doses were used. Results: All patients but one engrafted successfully. 24 (85.7%) patients with sustained engraftment were alive with a median follow-up of 9 months. No evidence of recurrent infection was seen among these patients. The causes of death among 5 patients were acute GvHD (n=3), non-engraftment infectious complications (n=1) and aspiration pneumonia (n=1). Conclusions: The PID patients can take advantage from HSCT, but early diagnosis is important for rescue patients from lethal disease complications. The use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimen in the PID patients who suffer from co-morbidity at the time of transplantation, may reduce the treatment-related mortality (TRM). We investigated a cohort of 13 pediatric patients with non-malignant diseases transplanted with T-and B-cell depleted peripheral stem cell grafts from haploidentical donors between 2004 and 2011. 5 patients had myelodyslastic syndrome with refractory cytopenia (MDS-RC), 5 had severe aplastic anemias (SAA) and 3 patients had hemoglobinopathies. 3 out of 13 patients received a 2nd SCT after rejecting the graft from matched related or unrelated donors. Median age was 8.3 years. Standard conditioning regimen consisted of Fludarabin (4x40 mg/m 2 ), Thiotepa (1x10 mg/kg), Melphalan (2x70 mg/m 2 ) and OKT3. Since 2009, patients received upfront additional total lymphoid irradiation (TLI, n=3) to prevent graft rejection. In the current protocol, OKT3 will be substituted by ATG. Graft manipulation was carried out by direct depletion using antiCD3/19 coated magnetic microbeads. A median number of 15.6x10 6 CD34+ Progenitorcells and 53x10 3 T-cells/kg body weight (BW) were transfused. Pharmacological Graft vs.Host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was carried out with Mycofenolate until day 60, if residual T-cells in the graft exceeded 25000/kg BW. Primary engraftment occurred in all patients. 5/10 patients with non irradiation regimen rejected the haplo graft and needed reconditioning with Fludarabine (3x40 mg/m 2 ), Thiotepa (1x5 mg/kg), ATG, OKT3, 7 Gy TLI and a second stem cell donation from a different parental donor. Thus, fi nal engraftment was achieved in 13/13 patients. None of the patients rejected the second graft. None of the patients receiving upfront preventive TLI rejected the fi rst graft. Median time to reach 500/\u03bcl neutrophiles was 9 days (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Independence from platelet substitution was reached after 11 days (8-16). 7/13 patients (54%) had no signs of GvHD or GvHD grade I, 5 patients (38%) had GvHD grade II, 1 patient developed grade III (8%). TRM at day+100 and after 1 year was 0% and 15%, respectively. Event free survival (EFS) at 3 years was 85%.",

Kowalczyk Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Aim: In the retrospective study we evaluated the clinical impact of chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patient and Methods: Between 2000 and 2010 twenty fi ve children suffering from SAA was referred to our center for transplantation. There were 14 boys and median age of the group was 9 years (range 8 months to 15 years). Transplant from match related donor bone marrow was performed in 14 children and alloHSCT was primary treatment of these patients. Eight children was transplanted from match unrelated donors (MUD) and the procedure was introduced as a salvage therapy after failure of immunosuppressive therapy (IST). One patient was transplanted from haploidentical donor and one patient received sibling graft after IST. Post transplant chimerism was evaluated at following time periods: 1, 3, 6, 12 months post alloHSCT and at least once a year therefore. Multiplex short tandem repeated PCR (STR-PCR) was used as a method of chimerism evaluation. Results: 21/24 patients engrafted and 3/20 did not show engraftment (2 unrelated donor and one sibling donor after IST) and one boy was rescued by the second graft from the same unrelated donor. Three patients died from transplant related complication: two girls died from multi-organ failure caused by infections (one before engraftment and one after re-transplantation) one girl died from lymphoproliferative disease which occurred after re-transplantation and IST failure. 22/25 children are alive, in good clinical and hematological condition, median 5 years after transplantation (range 1-10 years). One patient (4%) experienced autologous recovery after MSD alloHSCT. In 9/21 (43%) survivals we observed full donor chimerism during observation time. Eleven patients (53%) developed mixed chimerism, ranging from 6,4 to 39 percent recipient cells in peripheral blood. Mixed chimerism increased in eight patients and in three children was stable. 3/24 patients (2 MUD and 1 MUD) after primary engraftment rejected their graft 2,3 and 22 months after alloHSCT and 2 of them were successfully re-transplanted from the same donor. Remaining eight patients have normal peripheral blood count despite having mixed chimerism. All surviving patients are off immunosuppression, without symptoms of GvHD. Conclusion: In our material mixed chimerism does not impair the outcome of children with Severe Aplastic Anemia after alloHSCT.",

Yabe (1) Objective: Inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) is a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by cytopenias usually in association with one or more physical malformations. We report the outcome of 11 IBMFS patients (pts), who were given alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using low-dose irradiation and fl udarabine-based conditioning. Methods: Between 1/2002 and 7/2011, 11 IBMFS pts received HSCT. They are all excluded from Fanconi anemia and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome by clinical features, chromosome instability and/or genetic subtypes. Three children had dyskeratosis congenita and other eight were unclassifi able IBMFS by Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry criteria. There were 5 males and 6 females, aged 10 months to 11.8 years old at HSCT. Hematological diagnosis included transfusion dependent severe aplastic anemia (n=10) and RCMD (n=1). Donors were HLA-matched unrelated (n=4), mismatched unrelated (n=5), haploidentical mother (n=1) and matched unrelated cord blood (n=1). Conditioning regimen was TAI (3Gy) + fl udarabine + CY \u00b1 ATG, which is used as a conditioning for acquired aplastic anemia or RA in our hospital. GVHD prophylaxis included tacrolimus + MTX \u00b1 MMF for all pts. Results: All pts engrafted. None of the pts showed grade III/ VI regimen-related organ toxicity using the Bearman criteria. Acute GVHD, I, II, and chronic GVHD were observed in 2, 3, 3 pts, respectively. All pts remain alive and well at a median of 51 months following HSCT (range 4-118mo). Conclusion: Our study indicates that signifi cant advances have been made in the use of alternative HSCT to treat IBMFS using low-dose irradiation and fl udarabine-based conditioning regimen. Furthermore, the low dose ATG administered prior to transplant might exert a preventive effect on GVHD in conjunction with tacrolimus and short-term MTX.",

Benesch, V. Strenger, M. Seidel, C. Urban Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Introduction: Treosulfan demonstrates cytotoxic/antiproliferative activity against a wide range of malignancies, as well as myeloablative and potent immunosuppressive effects, and has a favorable toxicity profi le. Treosulfan-based preparative regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been used in children with hematological malignancies and non-malignant disorders. We report our experience on 6 patients receiving treosulfan-based conditioning between 2009 and 2011. Patients and Methods: Diagnoses of the 6 patients (m:f=4:2; median age: 2.1 years; range: 0.5-23.2 ) were: Hurler's disease (n=2), X-linked-lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), Griscelli syndrome type 2, high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CR1), relapsed juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia. Donors were matched unrelated (n=3), haploidentical parents (n=2) and one matched sibling. Grafts were peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC; CD3/19 depleted \u00b1 CD34 selected) in 4 patients, bone marrow (BM) in 1, and BM plus PBSC in 1 patient, containing in median 19.8 x10 6 CD34+/kg. Conditioning consisted of Treosulfan (14 g/m 2 : n=5; infant:12 g/m 2 ), Fludarabine (150-150 mg/m 2 ), Thiotepa (7.5-10 mg/kg) and ATG Fresenius (n=5: 30-60 mg/kg) or Thymoglobulin (n=1: 3 mg/kg x2). Results: Leukocyte engraftment (WBC>1.0 G/l) was achieved by all patients on median day +13.5 (+9 to +19), platelet engraftment by 5 patients on day +10 (+8 to +13). Five patients established a stable donor chimerism of \u226595% from median day +10. The infant with Griscelli syndrome experienced reactivation of hemophagocytosis around day +13 leading to graft rejection and is being prepared for second HSCT. Prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVH) consisted of Mycophenolate-mofetil (n=4) or Cyclosporine A (n=2); no signs of acute or chronic GVH were noted so far. Acute extramedullary toxicity was mainly moderate mucositits (n=3), diarrhea (n=1) and mild skin toxicity (n=2). All patients are alive for a median of 13.5 (1-31) months. During immune reconstitution (IR) the patient with XLP developed IR-infl ammatory syndrome leading to permanent CNS compromise. Conclusions: Treosulfan-based conditioning lead to stable hematopoietic engraftment with early complete donor chimerism in 5/6 patients including 3 patients with nonmalignant diseases with mild acute toxicity but was not able to prevent early reactivation of hemophagocytosis leading to graft rejection in the patient with Griscelli syndrome.",

            "text": "Fludarabine as second-line treatment in paediatric steroid refractory allo-immune lung syndromes M. Raphael (1) S385 ing pneumonia (BOOP) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) are life-threatening complications after either hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or lung transplantation (LTX). Respiratory viral infections are suggested to trigger these alloLS. Methods: In patients with steroid refractory alloLS (no improvement or progressive alloLS despite methylprednisolone) the methylpredisolone-pulses were replaced by fl udarabine as immunosuppressive treatment. Corticosteroids were tapered off while fl udarabine was given in a dose of 30 mg/m 2 every three weeks, for a maximum of 6 courses. Every time response to fl udarabine gifts was noted, another course was scheduled. Response was defi ned as improvement/normalization of PFTs compared to baseline pre-HSCT and/or resolved respiratory symptoms, with either reduction or no extra oxygen requirement. Results: 5 patients were included: all (4 HSCT and 1 LTX) showed good allogenic donor cell engraftment and/or function of the graft. Patients developed respiratory signs and symptoms of alloLS 2 months (median time) after transplantation (range 2-8 months) for which radiologic and pulmonary function tests were performed (Table 1) . These 5 patients with eventually steroid refractory alloLS were treated with fl udarabine. Fludarabine was started at a median of 5.5 months after transplantation (range 3-10.5 months). All showed either partial or complete fl udarabine response after a median of 4 courses (range 2-6 courses) ( Table 2) . Despite a high load of respiratory viral infections none of these patients showed progression of viral disease. Conclusion: Fludarabine is a feasible and an effective second line treatment of steroid refractory alloLS, without an increase in viral load and possible associated viral disease. Pericardial effusion and cardiac complications are rare complications in patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT). Life-threatening cardiac toxicity is occuring in less than %2 of all patients after HSCT. The incidence of cardiac complications after HSCT in pediatric population is exactly unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence, risk factors and outcome of 240 pediatric HSCT recipients for benign diseases. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 240 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT from 1998 to 2011 for the development of post transplant cardiac complications. Cardiac complications occured in 19 patients (7.9%). These cardiac complications are consisted of pericardial effusion (n=9), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=3), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (n=3), hypertension (n=2) and tacyhycardia (n=2). There was no correlation between overall results of cardiologic evaluation before SCT and cardiac toxicity. Male/female ratio was 12/7. The mean of age was 9.7\u00b16.8 years. Donors were matched unrelated (MUD) in 9, matched sibling donor (MSD) in 7, matched family donor in 3 transplantations. Peripheral blood stem cell was used in 63.2%. All of patients received cyclophosphamide as conditioning regimen. Cardiac complications with MUD were seen signifi cantly more than MSD (p=0.016). Cardiac complications were developed signifi cantly more in patients with aGvHD (p=0.001). In patients developed cardiac complication, mortality rates was signifi cantly higher (p<0.001). Conclusion: In our pediatric transplant unit, the frequency of cardiac complications was 7.9%. We showed that MUD, aGvHD, Grade II-IV aGvHD were signifi cantly affecting to development of cardiac complication. Cardiac complications were signifi cantly related high mortality. We concluded that pediatric transplant patients especially GvHD group must be followed closely for development cardiac complications. For MUD, the further studies about factors affecting cardiac complication development is needed. Background: Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a rare primary immunodefi ciency predisposing to infection and infl ammation, is managed with lifelong prophylactic antimicrobials and treatment of complications, or potentially curative HSCT or gene therapy. Chronic illness has an impact on quality of life and mental health. There has been little assessment of this in CGD. Other infl ammatory conditions can be associated with cognitive decline. We present preliminary data from quality of life and cognitive assessment of the UK CGD cohort. Methods: The UK and Ireland CGD registry was compiled in 2000. Most CGD patients are cared for at 3 centres in the UK. Cognitive function was assessed using the Wechsler Abreiviated Scale of Intelligence. Age appropriate standardised questionniares were used to measure emotional, behavioural and self esteem issues and quality of life. Results: 26 patients (25 male) have been recruited. All have undergone cognitive assessment (median age 13 years, 8 post-HSCT). Mean IQ 95.19 (range 58-130, std 19.6) was not signifi cantly different from the expected value of 100. Mean for those post-HSCT was 93.5 (std 22.6) and 95.94 (std 18.7) for those not transplanted. More patients than expected in a normal population had IQ <85 (30.8%, p=0.032), 2 (7.7%) had IQ <70 indicating severe cognitive diffi culties. 10 parents and 7 children (4 post HSCT), have completed Strengths & Diffi culties Questionnaires (SDQ). 12 parents and 9 children (5 post HSCT), have completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale (PedsQL). Parent reported peer and self reported emotional diffi culties were signifi cantly higher in those who had not undergone HSCT compared to the population norm using the SDQ (p=0.009 and p=0.012 respectively). Parent and self reported emotional functioning scores were signifi cantly lower for those that had not undergone HSCT compared to those that had on the PedsQL (p=0.044 and p=0.039 respectively). Conclusion: Although these are interim results, it is interesting that quality of life appears better following HSCT. The mean",

AL-Zahrani (1) Objectives: Reticular dysgenesis (RD) is the most sever form of sever combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) that characterized by sever agranulocytosis and impairment of T-and B-lymphocytes. During uncertainty of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we confi rmed RD form of SCID by mutations in adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) gene thereafter successfully treated with Bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Method: 4-month-old infant had persistent neutopenia and recurrent sepsis (documented: staphylococcus epidermidis). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) was used, but without improvement of the neutrophil counts. Repeatedly bone marrow biopsy showed 30-50% blasts cells consistent with AML. The cells were positive for CD13, CD34, CD117, CD33 and HLADR and were negative for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD61, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD14 , CD20, cyCD79a, MPO, CD15 and TDT markers. Full immunologic evaluation was performed. Result: Complete blood count showed persistent sever neutropenia (leucocytes 600 cells/\u03bcl, neutrophils 60 cells/\u03bcl, monocytes 40 cells/\u03bcl, lymphocytes 480 cells/\u03bcl, haemoglobin 10.7 g/dl, and thrombocytes 410,000 cells/\u03bcl). The immunological work up showed panhypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA <0.05 g/l, IgG <1.08 g/l and IgM <0.05 g/l ) and sever panlymphopenia (CD3+ 150 cells/\u03bcl, CD3+/CD4+ 50 cells/\u03bcl, CD3+/CD8+ 100 cells/\u03bcl, CD3-/CD19+ 280 cells/\u03bcl and CD3-/CD16+/CD56+ 60 cells/\u03bcl ). T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) using realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction on DNA showed undetectable TREC circties. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial energy metabolism enzyme AK2 confi rmed RD form of SCID. Fluorescence in situ hybridization study showed no evidence of leukemic gene rearrangement. He had BMT with successful myeloid and lymphoid engraftments. Conclusion: GCSF has no proven benefi ts for RD patients, but can cause malignant transformation. The price mechanism behind the appearance of malignant clone of cells when sever congenital neutropenia treated with GCSF is not yet clearly defi ned. It is critical to differentiate RD form of SCID from other causes of leukopenias in neonates, because RD is a lethal condition and rapidly fatal disorder. To achieve the best success in such cases, patient with RD should receive bone marrow transplantation treatment as curative therapy of choice. Background: Recently a great deal of attention has been given on doctors' work related stress and possibility of improving their quality of life. Several studies report that oncologists are overloaded psychologically. Contact with serious diseases, excessive working pressure, structural weaknesses, are some of the factors that predispose oncologists to stress. In 2008, at the ASPHO annual meeting, pediatric hematologists/oncologists noted burnout (considered as a result of protracted stress at work) was a signifi cant challenge in their lives. To date, no studies have extensively ruled out on protective factors from work stress among pediatric oncologists. Aims: Our research investigates the relationship between Work Stress, Work Engagement and Personal Well-being in a sample of doctors working in Italian hospitals. Specifi cally, the study investigates whether Organizational Support, Self-effi cacy Perceived, adaptive Coping styles and specifi c training on social and relational skills mediate between Work Stress, Personal Well-being and Work Engagement. In addition, it investigates the differences between oncologists, pediatricians and other kind of physician. Materials and Methods: The research included 176 physicians (M=89; F=83; MS=4) working in Italian healthcare units of oncology and onco-haematology; 15 of them work in pediatric unit. Doctors fi lled self-report questionnaires to evaluate Work Stress and Coping Strategies (Health Professions Stress and Coping Scale), Personal Well-being (General Health Questionnaire), Work Engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale) and two purpose-built scales to measure the degree of perceived Organizational Support and the level of specifi c training on social and relational skills. Result: It was found negative and signifi cant correlations between the scores of the scales that measure the use of adaptive coping strategies and stress levels. Moreover, physicians who obtained higher levels of specifi c training on social and relational skills reported lower levels of stress. Finally, it was highlighted signifi cant differences between pediatricians and other physicians, especially on the use of adaptive coping strategies. Conclusions: Our results seem to confi rm that well-being of physicians is mediated by typical aspects of the profession, such as social skills in relationship with patients.",

Veljkovic (1) Background: High dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue has been show to impruve event -free survival for children with solid tumors, relapsed or refactory lymphoma, and high -risk form Ewing's sarcoma. PBSC collections using automated or semiautomated blood cell separator in pediatric patients are much more complicated and risky than in adults. It is diffi cult to maintain adequate vascular access proving a suffi cient blood fl ow rate because of small size of their blood vessels and a lack of compliance of the child during procedure. The aim of this study is to present vascular access for the collection of PBSC in pediatric patients with evaluation feasibility, effi cacy and safety of procedure. Methods: Since November 2002. to August 2011, 93. children (64 male, and 29 female) underwent 124 autologous PBSC collection. The primary diagnosis in 42. children (45%) was neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma in 19 (20%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 14 (15%), Hodgkin lymphoma in 9 (10%) other tumors in 8 (7%), and AML in 1 (3%) patient. The median age of the patients was 7 years (range, 7 months-18 years), and the median body weight was 31 kg (range, 7-105). Blood was withdrawn through a temporary catheter inserted into radial artery before leukapheresis in 75 procedures (60%), the femoral artery in 16 (13%), femoral vein in 14 (11%), jugular vein in 13 (10), and cubital vein in 6 (5%) procedures. The processed blood was returned through a central venous catheter in 61 (49%), temporary catheter inserted into femoral vein in 35 (28%), jugular vein in 16 (13%) and the cubital vein in 12 (10%) cases. Median fl ow rate was 29 mL/min (range, and average leukapheresis time was 276 min (range, 136-303). Catheters were removed 4-5 hours after completion of PBSC harvest. There were no immediate or long term complications. Switching the radial catheter to diferent blood vessels during the collection was necessery in eight (6%) procedures. Two (1.6%) of the stem cells products were infected. Tareget dose of 5x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells was realized in 76 (82%) patients. Conclusion: It is possible to harvest target dose of CD34+ cells in most of children with malignancy using temporary vascular access.",

Hale Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Trust (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) The collection and reinfusion of peripheral blood stem cells in children is an integral part of many current treatment options. We tested two versions of a newly developed stem cell collection program on the Spectra Optia apheresis system, version 3(V3) and version 5(V5). 53 procedures were carried out (31 patients), 45 procedures were eligible for further analysis, (19 V3; 26 V5). Patient diagnosis included neuroblastoma 10, Ewings sarcoma 7, Brain tumour 7, Hodgkins lymphoma 2, germ cell tumour 1, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 1 and Wilms tumour 3. Stem cell mobilization was with GCSF either following chemotherapy or using a steady state mobilization. Plerixafor was used for one mobilization in conjunction with GCSF after prior failed mobilization. Collection preference was set to maximize collection effi ciency of CD34+ cells and to limit cross-cellular contamination. Standard blood analysis and CD34+ counting were done preapheresis and on the collected stem cell product. The CD34+ collection effi ciency was calculated using pre-CD34+ counts and product CD34+ counts only. Patients who underwent collections on V3 were smaller than on V5 (17 kg (12-59) vs 22kg (9.5-67); p<0.02). More blood needed to be processed using V3 (4.5 litres (2.0-8.7) V3; 3.2 litres (1.9-7.8) V5; p<0.009) already indicating that blood can be processed more effi ciently on V5. In addition, collection time was lower on V5 (median 244 min V5 vs 265 min V3). Stem cell product parameters and effi ciencies are summarized in the table below as median values.

Recently the OPTIA\u2122 (Caridian BCT, USA) apheresis system was introduced to the medical community. Data are available for the adult population but not in children. We made the following fi eld evaluation as a part of our in-house validation system to gain data about the performance of this new apheresis device in children and young adults. Patients and Methods: From January to September 2011 we performed 6 autologous stem cell harvests in 6 patients suffering from various malignant diseases (neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, ATRT, PNET, AML and Ewing's sarcoma) with the OPTIA\u2122 system. 1 female, 5 male, median age 8.5 y (min 1max 20), median bodyweight (bw) 27 kg (10.3-54.5), 3/6 with a bw <20 kg, for all of them the set was primed with blood according to the blood priming procedure provided by the system. Buffy coat collection was activated in one patient manually and in the other runs by the algorithm of the system. In total a median 4 cycles (3-13) were collected. Sample were drawn immediately before and after the run from patients blood and from the apheresis product for blood smear, CD34+ cell count, and leukocyte subpopulations according to our in-house protocol. The collection effi ciency of leukocyte subpopulations and the loss of hematocrit and platelets were calculated. Mobilisation was performed according to the treatment protocol of the underlying disease. Results: The CD34+ cell count before was in median 53/\u03bcl (25-270), with 28.7 G/l Leukozytes (7.1-55), and 30% hct (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) . In all patients a suffi cient number of stem cells could have been harvested in one apheresis procedure (yield in median 4.8 \u00d7 10E06 CD34+ cells/kg bw; 2.2-17). The amount of total MNC in the product was 76% (69-97). The collection effi ciency for CD34+ cells was 67% (27-72), and for total MNC 58% (24-73). There was a signifi cant loss in platelet counts after the procedure (in median 48%; 32-54). No severe side effects in the patients were observed. Once we have observed a leakage in a set. Conclusion: The Optia\u2122 system showed a good performance in harvesting autologous stem cells also in a pediatric and adolescent population. The procedure is feasible even in pediatric",

Patients and Results: At the fi rst, we observed two beta-thalassaemia major cases which were candidates for BMT: the fi rst thalassaemic patient, rejected at +40 days after BMT and the second one at +90 days after transplant. The autologous recovery was documented by the DNA molecular analysis that detected 0% residual donor cells in both cases. Transfusion therapy was required to support anaemia until +118 and +162 days after transplant in the fi rst and in the second case respectively. Afterwards the Hb levels were steadily over 11.8 and 10.2 g/dl respectively without the use of transfusion support and the Hb electrophoresis revealed HbF 99.8% in both cases. As we write this at +69 and +57 months respectively of ongoing follow-up after graft failure, both patients maintain the sustained and full (99.8%) production of HbF and are transfusion-free. (See the Figure) . The third case is a sickle cell anaemia patient with pre-transplant HbS level of 77.3%. The patient failed to engraft and the autologous recovery was documented +48 days after the aploidentical stem cell transplant.Twenty months after the BMT failure, the HbF levels increased to 49.2 and the patient remains free of transfusion therapy with stable Hb level over 11.4 gr/dl and without vaso-occlusive symptoms (Figures). Conclusions: The three cases show that the reactivation of HbF synthesis can occur in the adult age and the high levels of HbF provide a therapeutic benefi t to the beta-disorders. Although the mechanisms underlying the switch back to stable HbF production after BMT failure need further investigation, these cases strongly support the research efforts to reverse the haemoglobin switch and induce the HbF production in adults in order to treat the beta-haemoglobin disorders.",

Abu-Jazar, O. AL-Rawi, N. Hussain, F. Abdel-Rahman King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, JO) Purpose: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option for patients with thalassemia. The best results were observed following matched related HSCT. Information regarding the likelihood of fi nding suitable matched related donors for patients with thalassemia is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate this potential in Jordan, which might refl ect other developing and Arab countries. Patients and Methods: Retrospective review of medical records of all patients with Thalassemia and their families who did HLA typing study at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) in Amman (which has the only comprehensive bone marrow transplantation program in Jordan), between January 2003 and November 2011 was performed. Results: A total of 341 patients were included, 55% (n=185) were males, and 45% (n=156) were females. The median patient age was 9 year (0.3-32). The median family size was 4, with a range of 1 to 10. The probability of fi nding a matched related donor from immediate and extended families was 61% (n=208) for all patients, among them; 13.5% (n=28) were found to have non-siblings related donors from extended family search. Among those patients with donors, 46 patients received HSCT at KHCC, with 98% overall survival and 88% thalassemia free survival. The average number of donors was 1.3 (with a range of 1-4) for patients who had sibling donors, and 1 (1-2) for patients with non-sibling related donors. Conclusion: The chance of fi nding a matched related donor for HSCT for patients with thalassemia is high as compared to Western countries and Asia.

Nwogoh Hematologist (Benin, NG) Objective: Sickle Cell Anemia has a prevalence of 3% in Nigeria (population of 150 million) and Allogeneic HSCT is an approved curative therapy. We present our fi rst Allogeneic HSCT for a 7 years old patient with severe Sickle Cell Anemia.The patient had a stable Hemoglobin of 7.0g/dl, a previous history of cerebrovascular accident and debilitating right sided hemiparaparesis. Method: The Patient was HLA identical with his 14 year old sibling. Both patient and donor had an ABO blood group A rhesus positive, were seronegative for CMV. No malaria parasitemia, no evidence of tuberculosis and HIV I and II infection were found. A CT scan of the neurocranum showed few old cerebral micro-infarcts. Conditioning was with (Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC)). and Bulsulphan 400 mg (4x25 mg 6 hly days -5 to -1) and ATGAM 500 mg (days -4 to-2)]. GVHD prophylaxis was with Cyclosporine A (2x50 mg daily) And Mycophenolate Mofetil (2 \u00d7 500 mg/ day). Stem cell source was unmanipulated bone marrow harvested on the 28th of September 2011 with 9.8 \u00d7 10 6 nucleated cells per kg body weight in a total product volume of 900mls. Infectious disease prophylaxis was with Bactrim, Variconazole, Acyclovir and Proguanil. Result: Neutrophil engraftment was day 18 and platelet engraftment day 21. At day 32, chimerism was 36% and hemoglobin electrophoresis since day 12 has been HbAA. Day 70 full blood count was a total white blood cell count of 3100/\u03bcl, Neutophils 1200/\u03bcl, Hb 11.3 g/dl, Platelet 198,000/\u03bcl, and chimerism 69%. Adverse effects were hypertension and prolonged clotting time due to volume overload (over 4 hrs) during the infusion of the stem cells and heparin in the bag whic was managed with Antihypertensive and and protamine sulphate. An exit site Infection of the central femoral Catheter with pseudomonas was the only infectious complication. To date there are no signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Patient had a total of two units of irradiated red cell concentrate and 4 units of platelets concentrate. The Patient was discharged on day 71 and he is currently clinically stable and responding to physiotherapy. Conclusion: Sickle cell disease is the most prevalent Hemaglobinopathy in Nigeria. With Allogeneic HSCT from a HLA matched sibling we have successfully transplanted a 7 year old Sickle Cell Anaemia. With the assistance of Government and improved Health Insurance Policy we could make HSCT available to many Nigerians who have both malignant and nonmalignant disorders.",

Ertem, E. \u00dcnal Ince, Z. Uysal Ankara University (Ankara, TR) Splenectomy is a critical decision for thalassemia major (TM) patients because of the blunted primary immune response to encapsulated organisms. Hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) produces additional risk for these patients due to intense immunesuppression. A retrospective study was designed to determine the role of pretransplant splenectomy in early and late bacterial infections and survival among 54 patients following fi rst HLA-identical HSCT for TM. Fifteen (27%) of the 54 patients were splenectomized pretransplant. The median follow up time was 65.5 months (12. 0-168.3 months) .Splenectomized patients were older (14.6\u00b13.0 vs 7.7\u00b14.2 yr; p<0.001) and majority of the splenectomized patients were classifi ed as class III high risk group (%86.7 vs %13.3; p<0.01). Splenectomized patients had a signifi cantly shorter time to ANC >500/mm 3 (12.2\u00b12.0 vs 17.2\u00b14.1 days; p<0.001). There were no signifi cant difference in peritransplant infection rate between patient groups. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, SOS were similar for splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients. Based on Kaplan-Meier analyses, patients with splenectomy had a signifi cantly higher overall mortality (fi ve year OS rate: 78.3\u00b11.1 vs. 97.4\u00b10.2%). On a multivariate analysis older age and infection had a signifi cant impact on OS. During the peri-transplant period (<100 days) one patient in non-splenectomized group and one patient in splenectomized group died due to infection and acute GVHD, respectively. During long term follow-up period two additional patients died because of sepsis within 13 months after HSCT and both of these patients were in the splenectomized group. In summary, our study showed no signifi cant infl uence of splenectomy on early posttransplant infections and mortality rate probably because early intervention is possible during early post HSCT period. Unfortunately, during the long term follow-up period risk of infection increases signifi cantly because of additive effects of immunosuppression to the unfavorable effect of splenectomy and it is not possible to achieve early intervention after hospital discharge in a developing country. For this reason the decision of splenectomy should be considered carefully for patients with benign diseases like TM who will undergo transplantation. Prevention of splenomegaly with regular transfusion program should be the main purpose of treatment of the patients with TM.",

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 58 patients with Betathalassemia major (median age: 8 years; range: 2.6-20 years; 65.5% male) in this study. In each patient, we performed liver stiffness measurement using TE expressed in kilo pascals (kPa) and liver biopsy assessed according to the Ishak score.

Hazar Akdeniz University (Antalya, TR) Alpha-mannosidosis is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by immune defi ciency, facial and skeletal abnormalities, hearing impairment and mental retardation. Although HSCT is considered the only clinically available approach to enzyme replacement, effi cacy and safety data are very limited.We report two siblings who successfully underwent HSCT from MUDs. Case 1: The girl fi rst came to clinical attention due to delay in speech and pectus carinatum at age of 8 y old. She was diagnosed as Alpha-mannosidosis by absent of Alpha-mannosidase enzyme activity in the leukocytes. She had coarse facial features with frontal bossing, skeletal abnormalities. Last 3 years she was suffering from hearing impairment, swallowing diffi culty and weakness in the legs. At the age of 11 years old, she underwent BMT from a HLA-C allel MMUD. The conditioning regimen was consisted of Bu+CY and ATG . She received CsA and MTX for GVHD prophylaxis. The number of TNC was 4x10 8 /kg and CD34+ cells number was 1,8x10 6 /kg CD34+ cells/kg, recipient weight. She achieved successful neutrophil and platelet engrafment on day 20. After 2 years, she is now well, swallowing function is improved and put on weight, her communication skills get better. In the last visit, chimerism analysis is revealed 100% of donor cells and her enzyme activity is normal. Case 2: A 6 y old boy was admitted to the hospital because of skeletal deformity and the family history of Alpha-mannosidosis. He diagnosed as Alpha-mannosidosis by absent Alpha-mannosidase enzyme activity in the leukocytes. He had not expressive speech and was using hearing aid. During following examination, strabismus was determined. At 8 years old, he underwent BMT from 10/10 MUD. He received BU+CY and ATG as conditioning regimen. CsA and MTX were used as GVHD prophylaxis. The number of infused TNC was 13,6x10 8 /kg and CD34+cells number was 10,6x10 6 /kg. He achieved successful neutrophil and platelet engraftment on day 14 and 10 respectively. At 6th month examination, communication skills get better, his coarse facial features start to improve. The last chimerism analyses showed 100% of donor cells and his enzyme level is normal. In conclusion, HSCT should be considered as a therapeutic approach in patients with alpha mannosidosis. The benefi ts are greater in younger patients before disease related complications have developed. MUDs may use as a stem cell source if MFDs are not available. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive disorder of immune regulation that carries a grave prognosis; stem cell transplant (SCT) after induction therapy is the recommended defi nitive treatment. Unrelated donors (UD) are used for patients (pts) lacking a matched family donor, and for those lacking a molecular diagnosis (as sibling donors might themselves be genetically at risk but not yet affected). Two pediatric centers collectively transplanted 22 pts with HLH between 1991 and 2011. Etiologies included mutations of Perforin (7 pts), Munc 13 (2), Munc 18 (3), Syntaxin (1), as well as T-cell lymphoma (1) and EBV infection (1) . No molecular or infectious etiology was identifi ed in two extensively evaluated pts, and treatment predated the availability of molecular diagnosis in 5 pts. Twelve pts were in complete response at the time of transplant and 6 had less than a complete response; response data were unavailable in 4 pts. Unrelated donors were used for 10 children. Grafts were derived from marrow (12), peripheral blood (8), cord blood (1), or cord blood + marrow (1) . Six pts, mostly transplanted in the 1990's, received fully ablative conditioning; others received fl udarabine containing regimens; 91% received serotherapy during conditioning. Cyclosporine was administered after transplant usually in combination with either methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Fifteen patients (68%) are alive (8/10 UD, 7/12 related donors) without evidence of disease, four of whom have stable mixed donor chimerism of less than 70%. Four of 6 pts with signs of active HLH at the time of SCT survive, as did 4/5 children with HLH involvement of the central nervous system at diagnosis (two without apparent developmental delay). Fatal cases of pneumonia were caused by CMV (1), RSV (2), and adenovirus together with aspergillus (1), suggesting that aggressive anti-viral and anti-fungal prophylaxis is imperative in this high-risk population. The child with lymphoma died of multi-organ failure 1 day after transplant, and an additional pt succumbed to pulmonary venoocclusive disease 5 months after SCT. Severe graft vs. host disease occurred in only one child. SCT from related and unrelated donors using fl udarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning with the addition of serotherapy is an effective treatment for HLH.",

Ussowicz, J. Musial, J. Owoc-Lempach, E. Gorczynska, A. Chybicka, K. Kalwak Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL) Here we report the matched sibling donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in a 3 year old boy with ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome (ATS) and acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. The child was treated for leukemia with an ALL-BFM 2002 protocol, with chemotherapy dosage adjusted for patients with ATS. The indication for BMT was poor prednisone response on the 8. day of induction therapy. Method: The donor was the HLA-matched brother, in whom ATS was excluded. Conditioning regimen consisted of a protocol used in Fanconi Anemia (GEFA): intravenous Busilvex 2x1 mg/kg body weight (BW), Fludarabine 5x30 mg/m 2 , ATG-Fresenius 3x20 mg/kg BW. Graft material was bone marrow (BM) containing 3,64 x10 6 CD34+/kg recipient BW. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A, methylprednisolone and OKT-3 (from day +1 to +20). Results: The chemotherapy induced toxicities after BMT were leukopenia (0.25 k/uL) with agranulocytosis (0.13 k/uL) and mucositis (grade II). Immunosuppression induced multiple viral infections with adenovirus, BKV hemorrhagic cystitis, and EBV-LPD, which course was relatively mild and were successfully treated with cidofovir and rituximab. The ANC recovery was achieved on day +15, with a mixed chimerism (MC) with 66% of cells of recipient origin. The patient received 4 donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI's) for persistent and increasing MC.",

Further DLI's and attempts for second BMT procedure were refused by the patient's parent. Despite MC, the patient remains 3 years after BMT in complete hematological remission with normal complete blood count values. The transplantation did not worsen the patient's neurological status. Conclusions: The GEFA protocol was earlier used in our centre in patients with Fanconi Anemia, and in 1 child with Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome. The patient with ATS recovered after conditioning regimen with mild toxicities, confi rming that BMT in patients with malignancy and ATS remains a feasible and promising option. Low hematological toxicities and MC in our patient suggest that ATS patients could be conditioned more intensively than other chromosomal-breakage syndrome patients.",

Slatter, V. Bigley, R. Dickinson, M. Haniffa, N. McGovern, L. Jardine, G. Jackson, A. Cant, A. Gennery, S. Hambleton, M. Collin Newcastle University (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) The novel syndrome of Dendritic Cell, Monocyte, B and NK lymphocyte (DCML) defi ciency has recently been characterised and found to be caused by mutations in the transcription factor GATA-2. We describe a series of 10 patients and show that there is a high risk of death unless haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is performed. We describe 10 patients; 4 sporadic cases and 6 cases from 2 pedigrees showing autosomal dominant inheritance. 7 patients died before DCML defi ciency was recognised. Of the 3 patients currently alive, 2 were transplanted and show marked resolution of their disease with a follow up of 36 and 11 months, respectively. Causes of death in the patients who died include disseminated mycobacterium avium infection (2) H1N1 infl uenza (1) candidiasis (1) pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (2) and CMV pneumonitis (1). All patients had monocytopenia and decreased B and NK cells with normal T cells at presentation. Haemoglobin, platelets and neutrophil counts were within normal ranges or mildly reduced. In 4 patients, near absolute DC defi ciency and elevated Flt-3 ligand were also confi rmed. BM aspirate showed dysplastic megakaryocytes and increased fi brosis in some instances. GATA-2 mutation was confi rmed by Sanger sequencing in all cases. Two patients underwent reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT with PBMC from unrelated adult donors (patient 1-10/12 HLA match; patient 2-9/12); transplant conditioning was with Fludarabine 150 mg/m 2 , Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 and Alemtuzumab 60 mg (patient 1), and Fludarabine 150 mg/m 2 , Busulphan 6.4 mg/kg, Alemtuzumab 60 mg (patient 2). GVHD prophylaxis was with Ciclosporin and Mycophenolate Mofetil. Both transplants were uneventful. Patient 1 is now 32 months post-transplantation, well and off all medication. The DC count, monocyte count, lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulins are normal and there were good responses to tetanus and HIB vaccinations. Patient 2 is now 9 months post-transplantation with signifi cant improvement in respiratory function and no longer requiring oxygen. DCs and monocytes are in the normal range. Myeloid chimerism is 100% and T cell chimerism >85% in both. Lung function tests have improved to within 90% of predicted normal and radiology shows almost complete clearing of pulmonary infi ltrates. Follow-up continues with gynaecology for VIN3 associated with HPV16/18 infection. Neither patient has developed GVHD.",

The aim of this study was to expand the search for cGVHD biomarkers, to validate candidate proteins using high-throughput assays in a series of 152 consecutive patients treated in a single center, and to determine a composite prognostic score for prediction of extensive cGVHD. Patients included in the analysis were treated between 2005 and 2008 and had a median follow-up of 2.3 y (Table 1 ). In this series, 70 patients were diagnosed with cGVHD (23 with a limited form and 47 with an extensive form) after a median of 7.14 months after allo-SCT. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of extensive cGVHD was 40% and overall survival of the whole cohort was 69%. Serum samples were collected around day 100 (range, 83-119) after allo-SCT. Forty-one cytokines were studied using Luminex xMAP technology. In multivariate analysis, 2 clinical factors were associated with extensive cGVHD occurrence: history of prior acute GVHD (P=0.001) and the use of PBSCs as graft source (P=0.006). Ten cytokines were found to be signifi cantly correlated with the incidence of extensive cGVHD. High levels of IP10 (p=0.001), IL15 (p=0.028), IL10 (p=0.011), IL2RA (p=0.026) and MIP-1beta (p=0.010) were associated with higher incidence of extensive cGVHD, while high levels of Fractalkine (p=0.008), MDC (p=0.001), RANTES (p=0,008), TARC(p=0.004), IL12p40 (p=0.015) were associated with a lower risk of developing extensive cGVHD. Then, we established a practical prognostic score that was calculated using the multivariate Cox model combined with the statistical approach called \"time-dependent ROC curves\". We have focused on the 2 signifi cant clinical variables and the most signifi cant cytokines found in order to obtain a useful tool in the daily medical practice. Based on 0,632 bootstrap resampling method for repeated cross-validation, the AUC was 0.80 (95%CI, 0.72-0.87) indicating that such composite score is a powerful predictor of the risk of extensive cGVHD at 2 years. In summary, results from this study allowed to build a new noninvasive score to accurately predict the risk of extensive cGVHD occurrence after allo-SCT. Such score could be used as a decision tool in the clinical management of allo-SCT. We are currently undertaking an additional validation of this score on another independent cohort.",

Saillard (1) Background: Severity of chronic graft versus host disease (CGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is strongly related with outcome. Several staging systems have been developed. Revised Seattle classifi cation stratifi es CGVHD into limited or extensive form. In 2005, the NIH published consensus criteria for diagnosis, organ scoring and global assessment of CGVHD severity (mild, moderate or severe). We retrospectively reclassifi ed a cohort of patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT, using both Seattle and NIH classifi cation and determined the impact of cGVHD severity on the outcome. Patients and Methods: We evaluated all adult patients with hematological lymphoid or myeloid malignancies who received HSCT from related or unrelated donor, using peripheral blood stem cells, after RIC regimen (fl udarabine-busulfan-ATG) between 1998 and 2010 at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, France). CGVHD was classifi ed with both classifi cations, and was correlated with overall survival (OS), non relapse mortality (NRM), and relapse. CGVHD was considered as time-dependent variable, and included in uni-and multivariate models, after adjusting for age, disease risk, HLA compatibility, graft source and comorbidity score. Relapse or death before CGVHD was considered as a competing event. Results: 318 patients were evaluated, 130 developped CGVHD (27 limited, 95 extensive forms). Median follow up was 607 days, median age was 50, transplanted for acute leukemia (120), lymphoma (79), multiple myeloma (49), MDS (22), CLL (12), CML (17) or others (19) . Peripheral stem cells were mostly used (297 versus 21 bone marrow), from related (228) and unrelated (90) donors. There were 52 de novo, 43 quiescent and 30 progressive forms. Using NIH criteria, we got 28 mild, 52 moderate and 41 severe forms. 22 of 27 limited forms were reclassifi ed as mild, extensive forms were divided into 49 moderate and 39 severe forms. In multivariate analysis, mild and moderate forms were associated with better OS. Severe cGVHD was associated with signifi cant increase in NRM. Only age was statistically signifi cative in OS and NRM models. Conclusion: Mild to moderate CGVHD have a better OS than patients without or with severe cGVHD, due to lower NRM than patients with severe CGVHD and at least a comparable antitumoral effect with respect to patients without CGVHD. This invites developing strategies limiting severity of CGVHD but not abrogating it.",

Thrombocytopenia as one important risk factor for the outcome of chronic GvHD showed signifi cantly worse overall survival after 1, 2, 5 and 10 years with 65%, 49%, 37% and 37% for thrombocytopenic patients (platelet count below 100.000 per microliter) in contrast to 94%, 88%, 72% and 60% for the other group (p<0,001). Defi ned by the NIH consensus criteria 74 patients (37%) suffered from classic chronic GvHD and 127 (63%) developed an overlap syndrome. The survival rates were 96% for classic chronic GvHD versus 70% for overlap patients after 1 year, 87% versus 59% after 2 years, 64% versus 48% and 49% versus 47% after ten years. Thus the overlap syndrome signifi cantly impaired the probability of survival after 1, 2 and 5 years whereas the survival rates after 10 years were nearly similar. In conclusion the onset of chronic GvHD, thrombocytopenia and type of chronic GvHD were confi rmed as prognostic factors for survival in chronic GvHD patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Blaise Institut Paoli-Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Introduction: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is known to be associated with lower relapse risk, due to graftversus-tumor effect. Extensive form of cGvHD is associated with high transplant-related mortality (TRM), mainly due to infectious complications as a consequence of the immunosuppressive treatment (IS). Data on main registries and publications deal with maximum grade of cGvHD and its day of presentation post-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); however, they did not include information on evolution under treatment and duration of IS delivered. Patients and Methods: study population was represented by adult patients receiving HSCT after fl udarabine-busulfan-ATG conditioning between May 1999 and June 2010 at out Institution for a hematological malignancy. cGvHD was retrospectively classifi ed according to NIH criteria and presentation.",

Correlation with TRM, OS and relapse/progression was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox model after adjustment for main transplant variables. Results: On 313 transplanted patients transplanted in the above mentioned period,130 developed cGvHD and 129 were evaluable. Multivariate Hazard Ratios on OS, TRM and relapse/progression are shown in Table 2 . A moderate or severe cGvHD persisting without improvement at 12 months after HSCT is predictive of signifi cantly higher TRM and inferior OS.Importantly, forms of cGvHD that are responsive to IS and that allow complete or partial tapering of IS within 12 months after HSCT were associated with better outcome, despite a moderate or severe initial presentation ( Table 2) . Conclusion: Not only severity but also presentation of cGvHD and duration of IS showed to be predictive of TRM and OS after HSCT; in particular, response to IS and cGvHD severity at 12 months post-HSCT seem to be predictive of fi nal outcome. The present approach allows to better describe the complexity of post-transplant reality, where severity and duration of IS can change overtime and are associated with patients' outcome. Multi-state model will be further used and implemented to better assess risk changes according to post-transplant events.",

Slack, J. Leis, C. Reeder, J. Mikhael, P. Noel, R. Mesa, R. Tibes, J. Betcher, R. Adams Mayo Clinic Arizona (Phoenix, US) Transplant options are limited for adult patients (pts) who lack a fully matched related or unrelated donor. We hypothesized that in-vivo T-cell depletion with thymoglobulin (thymo) would allow safe allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) from mismatched, unrelated donors, thus expanding the potential donor pool for pts with hematologic malignancies who require allo-SCT. Patients and Methods: Thirty eight adult pts (age 20-70, median 46) underwent a fi rst unrelated, mismatched, allo-SCT between 1/1/2006 and 9/30/2011 at Mayo Clinic Arizona for hematologic malignancy (36 PBSC, 2 marrow). All pts had at least a one allele or one antigen mismatch (MM) at HLA-A, -B, -C, or -DRB1, and all except one pt received thymo as part of the GVHD prophylaxis strategy. One pt received Campath after experiencing anaphylaxis to thymo. Pts were transplanted for AML (n=20), ALL(8), CML (1), MDS (5), or NHL (4). Conditioning was myeloablative in 20, reduced intensity in 18. Mismatches were as follows: 1-allele MM (11); 1 antigen MM (19); 1 antigen, 1 allele MM (5); and 2 antigen MM (3). Additional GVHD prophylaxis included tacrolimus plus either methotrexate (n=22), mycophenolate mofetil (n=14), or other (n=2). Results: The median follow-up for surviving pts is 16 months. As of 11/30/11, 30 pts were alive, and 8 had died (4 NRM, 4 relapse). There have been no deaths related to acute or chronic GVHD. The 1-and 2-year estimated rates of overall survival are 83%/77%; of progression-free survival 79%/71%. The estimated rate of relapse at 1 and 2 years is 12%/19%, and of non-relapse mortality 9.3%/12.4%. Four pts (10.8%) have developed severe (grades III-IV) acute GVHD. Moderate to severe NIH-defi ned chronic GVHD occurred in a single pt at risk. Five pts have reactivated EBV, with two developing PTLD (one late death possibly related to EBV-PTLD). CMV reactivation was seen in 24 pts (65%), CMV disease in 4, with no deaths directly related to CMV. Conclusions: In vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit ATG (thymoglobulin) abrogates severe acute and (particularly) chronic GVHD, and allows use of mismatched, unrelated donors for allo-SCT in adult pts with otherwise incurable hematologic malignancies. Long-term survivors are generally free of severe chronic GVHD, with good quality of life. There does not appear to be an increased incidence of disease relapse, and non-relapse mortality is low. This approach is safe, effective, and considerably expands the donor pool for adult pts who require allo-SCT.",

Mohty for the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT We analyzed the effects of growth factor on outcome after HSCT with >9 years of follow-up. Of 1,887 adult patients with acute leukaemia who received bone marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors and who were treated with myeloablative conditioning, 459 (24%) were treated with growth factor. Growth factor hastened engraftment of neutrophils (p<0.0001), but reduced platelet counts (p=0.0002). GVHD-free survival (no acute GVHD of grades II-IV or chronic GVHD) at 10 years was 12\u00b12% (\u00b1SE) in the growth factor group, as opposed to 17\u00b12% in the controls (hazards ratio (HR) 0.81, p=0.001). Similar differences in GVHD-free survival were seen in patients with or without conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was higher in the growth factor group irrespective of whether or not there was conditioning with TBI (HR=1.48; 95%CI: 1.15-1.9; p=0.002; HR=1.59; 95%CI: 1.07-2.37; p=0.02, respectively). Both groups had similar probabilities of leukaemic relapse (HR=0.96; 95%CI: 0.78-1.18; p=0.71). Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) at ten years was 35\u00b12% in those receiving growth factor prophylaxis, as opposed to 44\u00b11% in the controls (HR=0.70; 95% CI: 0.60-0.82; p=0.00001). Prophylaxis with growth factor increases the risk of GVHD, does not affect relapse, increases NRM and reduces LFS more than 10 years after HSCT, regardless of conditioning with TBI.",

Methods: We prospectively analyzed 82 hematological malignancy patients, median age 51 years (range 20-69), who underwent HSCT. We evaluated immunological recovery by fl ow-cytometry, hematopoietic chimerism by STR-PCR in whole peripheral blood (PB), granulocyte fraction and immunomagnetically sorted CD19+ cells, and BAFF serum levels before HSCT and at day 90, 120 and 180. Results: Forty-three patients developed cGvHD at a median of 5 months after HSCT, with at least 2 organs involved and a median score of 3 according to the Organ Scoring System.

The CD19+ cell counts were similar between the two groups through the fi rst 120 days, but they increased at 180 day more in cGvHD negative patients then in positive ones (141/\u03bcl versus 61/\u03bcl). BAFF kinetics was similar in the two cohorts. BAFF levels raised to a peak at day 90 in both groups (7368 pg/ml in cGvHD-versus 7764 pg/ml in cGvHD+) and then progressively decreased at day 180 (respectively 6157 pg/ml and 6422 pg/ml). Mean BAFF/CD19+ cell ratio was lower in the cGvHD negative patients at 180 days (406 versus 119) and this correlates with a faster B cell recovery. Conclusions: Although severe B lymphocytopenia persisted through the fi rst 180 days in patients with and without cGvHD, the B cell compartment presented a complete donor engraftment ad day 120 in all patients. We observed that patients who do not developed cGVHD achieved a more rapid B cell recovery and showed a lower BAFF/CD19+ ratio.

Taylor The Rotherham Foundation Trust (Rotherham, UK) Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) is characterized by new development of fi xed airfl ow obstruction after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with a prevalence of 5.5% post HSCT and 14% in patients with chronic graft-versushost disease (cGVHD). The prognosis of refractory BOS remains poor with an overall survival of 13% at 5 years. Given the limited success with traditional treatment, Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) has been used as a therapeutic option, with a suggestion that it has a stabilizing effect on BOS. Aim: To analyse the impact of ECP on patients identifi ed with BOS in terms of improvement in Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) and clinical symptoms with a retrospective case note review. Methods: In our institution we reviewed the records of 186 patients referred over a 14 year period and applied the NIH criteria to identify patients with BOS. ECP was delivered as a paired treatment every fortnight for a 14 week assessment period, which based on response, was reduced to 4 weekly. Results: We identifi ed 9 patients (6 male, 3 female) who at the time of initiation of ECP met the diagnostic criteria for BOS. The median age was 42 years (range 17-51 yrs). The underlying diagnoses were AML=5, ALL=1, Primary Myelofi brosis=1, CML=1 and NHL=1. In 5 TBI was part of the conditioning regime. 3 underwent matched unrelated donor transplant and 1 underwent haploidentical transplant. All patients had additional non-respiratory cGVHD with 3 having >3 sites involved. The median time to initiation of ECP was 27 months (range 12-60 months) with a median follow up of 170 months . The median number of immunosuppressants used was 3 (range 2-5). Only 1 patient (11%) showed an objective improvement based on PFTs. One patient was able to be weaned off supplemental oxygen despite not showing an improvement in PFTs. No signifi cant improvements in PFTs or symptoms were noted in the remainder of the group. Conclusion: Though ECP is effective in certain forms of steroid refractory cGvHD, our data suggest that its role in the treatment of BOS remains limited and needs further evaluation. We were unable to demonstrate a stabilization of PFTs as previously reported (Lucid, 2011) . More effort needs to be focused on early detection of respiratory GVHD with a stringent PFT screening strategy post HSCT. Biomarkers may also have a role to play in help identifying those patients who may be poor responders to ECP and may require alternative therapy (Whittle, 2011)",

Disease progression might be slowed down by modern immunosuppressive regimens however include the side effects of increased immunosuppression. An innovative therapeutical option for BOS is the Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) and data about the effi cacy of ECP in BOS are limited. Methods: A 33 year-old male patient with severe hereditary pulmonary fi brosis presented with a BOS 42 months after doublelung transplantation. Even under a triple drug therapy with steroids, a calcineurin inhibitor and a cell-cycle inhibitor and additional steroid boli he experienced a progressive decline in lung function. With a BOS grade 3 basing on a vital capacity (VC) of 5,100 ml (former BOS grade 1: VC of 5,940 ml) and a forced exspiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2,120 ml (former BOS grade 1: FEV1 of 4,930 ml) he was transferred to our unit for photopheresis therapy. A Vortex\u2122 port was implanted and thereafter an intensive ECP treatment twice weekly for 8 weeks was started. Then the ECP treatment schedule was changed to twice weekly every second week for 10 weeks, thereafter twice weekly every third week for 9 weeks and then extended to twice weekly every month. Results: The patient tolerated well the intensive ECP therapy with no severe infectious disease complications during the ECP treatments. Twelve weeks after begin of the ECP no further decline of lung function was measured by spirometry with a VC of 5,070 ml and a FEV1 of 2,160 ml. Furthermore, 27 weeks after begin of the ECP treatment an improvement of the lung function with a VC of 5,360 ml and a FEV1 of 2,410 ml was confi rmed. Conclusion: Even the intensive ECP treatment is well tolerated by the patient. Furthermore the immunosuppressive medicinal therapy going along with toxicity and an increased risk of infectious diseases can be reduced under ECP treatment. Beyond that intensive ECP treatment might slow down the rate of decline in lung function and moreover might even improve lung function. Therefore, an innovative promising therapeutic option in patients with BOS after lung transplantation is the ECP therapy. Background: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) of the lung is a devastating late-onset non-infectious pulmonary complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with high morbidity and mortality. Treatment options are limited to immunosuppression, antiinfl ammatory and antiobstructive drugs, inhibitors of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)/transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) pathways, or lung transplantation. Here, we present results from an observational audit on the use of extracorporeal phototherapy (ECP), a modality with promising activity in other cGvHD manifestations, in the setting of pulmonary cGvHD. Patients and Methods: Twenty-seven patients received ECP for pulmonary cGvHD after allogeneic HSCT for AML (15), CML/ CMPN (6), ALL (3) or lymphoma (3) . Median age at transplant had been 40 years (range: 16 to 59); 10 patients were female and 17 male. Initial severity of pulmonary cGvHD according to NIH criteria was mild (3), moderate (17), or severe (7 patients). All patients had already been treated with 2 to 8 (median 4) lines of therapies including steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate, sirolimus, imatinib, macrolides, beta-2-mimetics, or montelukast, leading to improvement (6), no change (16), or deterioration (5 patients). ECP was started with the intent to (i) either stabilize rapidly declining lung function in patients with severe pulmonary cGvHD, or (ii) improve patients with stable but unsatisfactory prior results. Response to ECP was evaluated by lung function testing, according to NIH criteria. Results: Over a period of 2 to 76 (median 15) months, 5 to 80 (median 23) ECP cycles were applied to every patient. Decline of lung function was stopped in all 5 patients with prior progressive severe pulmonary cGvHD. 4 of 6 patients with stable severe pulmonary cGvHD improved to moderate severity. Conversely, only 2 patients with stable mild and none of 9 patients with stable moderate pulmonary cGvHD showed any signifi cant further improvement after ECP. 21 of 27 patients are still alive after a median follow-up of 46 (range: 6 to 143) months from diagnosis of pulmonary cGvHD; overall survival is 80% after 5 years and 64% after 10 years, which compares favourably with historical controls. Conclusion: ECP appears to represent a valuable therapeutic rescue option, especially for patients with severe pulmonary cGvHD. Prospective studies are warranted to confi rm these encouraging fi ndings.",

Two closed THERAKOS\u2122 Photopheresis Systems are used: the UVAR\u2122 XTS\u2122; and more recently, the CELLEX\u2122. The mechanism of ECP is not fully elucidated, and the potential infl uence of the treatment bag cell differential is of interest. We examined the relationship between peripheral blood WBCs and the cells harvested in the bag, compared adult and paediatric collection compositions, and whether the XTS\u2122 and CELLEX\u2122 devices were similar in their collection of cellular subsets. Methods: Samples were taken from: 537 treatment collections from 70 adults with GvHD undergoing ECP therapy using the CELLEX\u2122 device; 355 collections from 45 adults treated with the XTS\u2122; and 126 collections from 16 children treated with the CELLEX\u2122 incorporating a blood prime. Total WBC counts and cell differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) were obtained. Results: In the peripheral blood, adult patients had signifi cantly higher mean numbers per kilogram body weight (kg bw) of total WBCs and neutophils, than children, and lower lymphocytes. This was consistent with the differences found between collection samples from CELLEX\u2122-treated adults and children, plus mean monocytes per kg bw were greater in children. Comparisons of the 2 devices revealed higher mean total WBC and neutrophil, and lower monocyte numbers per kg bw, in adult collections obtained with CELLEX\u2122 use, compared to the XTS\u2122. No differences were found in adult collection mean lymphocyte numbers per kg bw between the 2 devices. Conclusion: WBCs collected during ECP therapy are representative of the peripheral blood population, which we found differed between paediatric and adult patients. Not all differences between adult and paediatric collections were attributable to the peripheral blood composition, however, as collections from children were higher in mean monocytes per kg bw. Despite the smaller volume of blood we treat during ECP in children, the mean numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes obtained per kg bw were similar to adult values. The XTS\u2122 and CELLEX\u2122 devices yielded similar mean lymphocyte numbers per kg bw in adults.",

Martinelli, F. Bertolini European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease are a common complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In animal models acute GVHD (aGVHD) is associated with increased neovascularization and number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), while patients with sclerodermatous chronic GVHD (cGVHD) show a signifi cant decrease in the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in peripheral blood as compared to patients with non sclerodermatous cGVHD or controls. To evaluate the role of CECs and EPCs in patients with cGVHD, we analysed a total of 15 patients affected by hematological malignancies having undergone ASCT following reduced intensity conditioning. Donors were HLA identical in 14 patients and HLA aploidentical in 1. Acute GVHD and cGVHD were defi ned on the basis of time of manifestation, \u2264100 days for aGVHD and >100 days for cGVHD. At the time of the blood sample collection, 8 patients, median age 42 years (28-51), with a median time after transplant of 177 days (21-1373), had no evidence of GVHD; of those 5/8 were evaluable for aGVHD and cGVHD, 2 only for aGVHD; 4/8 were on calcineurin inhibitors immunosuppressive therapy; 7 other patients, median age 51 years (38-64), with a median time after transplant of 844 days (314-1779), were all evaluable for acute and cGVHD and had evidence of cGVHD as follows: sclerodermatous in 3 patients requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy, oral mucosa lichen in 1 patient taking oral corticosteroid and cutaneous erythematous and dischromic cGVHD in the other 3 patients, with only 1 patient on systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Viable and apoptotic CECs and EPCs were evaluated by six color fl ow cytometry. Briefl y, CECs were defi ned as DNA+CD45-CD31+ CD146+, EPCs as CD45-CD34+. The combination of Syto16 and 7-AAD was used to discriminate between viable (syto16bright/7-AAD-) and apoptotic (syto16weakly pos/7-AAD+) endothelial cells, and to exclude from analysis, platelets and endothelial macroparticles. The results, expressed as median of cells/mL, are summarized in Table 1 . These preliminary data indicate a signifi cant reduction in apoptotic circulating mature endothelial cells, likely refl ecting a poor vascularization of multiple organs and tissues targeted by cGVHD and a trend towards a decreased number of EPCs in patients with cGVHD.

We prospectively evaluated the tolerability of combining rituximab and total nodal irradiation (R-TNI) in pts with extensive cGvHD after suboptimal responses to conventional systemic immunosuppression (SI). Study design and patient characteristics: The primary endpoint was toxicity at 3 months(m) with response rate and durability of response as secondary endpoints. Pts with active or recurrent cGVHD despite maximally tolerable SI received a single dose of 1000 mg R followed by 1Gy TNI within 7d. Maintenance R (500 mg) at 3-monthly interval for 12m was provided for pts achieving a stable (1-49% reduction of SI) or partial (>50% reduction of SI) response at 3m. The median age of 19 study pts (treated from 2007-2011) was 48 years (range: 19-71); 13 had prior total body irradiation; 11 were matched unrelated donor transplants. All pts (except one) were receiving prednisolone at study entry (median dose of 25 mg/d) with 14 pts receiving concurrent two or more SI. The median time from allograft to R-TNI was 1124d (range: 187-2721). 17 pts had extensive skin cGvHD including 12 with predominantly sclerodermatous changes; two pts had refractory oral cGvHD; fi ve pts had multi-organ disease. Seven pts were B-cell lymphopenic. Results: Mild transient thrombocytopenia occurred in all pts (grade 1-2 n=18; grade 3 n=1). Neutropenia occurred in 11 pts (58%): grade 1-2 (n=8); grade 3-4 (n=3). Grade 3-5 sepsis was experienced by six pts (31%) including one death from bacterial septicaemia in week 9. Seventeen pts were evaluable for initial response at 3m: 6 pts (35%) had progressive cGvHD, while 11 pts (65%) had either stable (n=9) or partial response (n=2) with a median reduction of total SI by 25%. With a median follow up of 9m (range: , the median duration of response was 16m (range: 3-36) with one complete responder. Overall survival was 84% with three deaths (relapsed leukaemia; sepsis; cGvHD). During maintenance R, four pts with hypogammaglobinaemia and infection required initiation of IVIg, while one pt had transient grade 3 neutropenia. Conclusion: For patients with extensive cGvHD inadequately controlled by SI, R-TNI induces transient tolerable haematological toxicity and achieves a modest rate of durable responses.",

Here, we report the case of a 42-year-old woman with the diagnosis of AML with no chromosome abnormalities who received an allogeneic PBSC transplantation from an HLA-identical unrelated donor in Israel 3 months after achieving CR with chemotherapy (7+3). A myeloablative conditioning consisted of busulfan and cyclophosphomide, cyclosporin and methotrexate for the prophylaxis of GVHD were used. Limited stage acute GVHD with skin involvement was the only complication in the early post-HCT period. Six months later she presented with chronic GVHD with skin involvement that was controlled by tacrolimus and four rituximab infusions. 18 months post HSCT she appeared in our clinic with anasarca, lower limbs edema, hypoalbuminemia (21 g/L), massive proteinuria (increased from 3.5 to 37 g/day during a week). There was mild hematuria and normal renal function with no evidence of other autoimmune disease due to immunological tests. Ultrasound showed normal-sized and normoechoic kidneys, no hydronephrosis. A renal biopsy showed membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). According to these fi ndings, the diagnosis of MGN was established. We immediately restarted tacrolimus 0.5 mg/kg/day, prednisone 2-10 mg/kg/day and enalapril (10 mg/day) with no effect. In this case we decided to use rituximab in the standard dosage 375 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22 . The edema resolved with furosemide and albumin transfusions. A month after the last infusion of rituximab she was asymptomatic with normal urine test, serum albumin was 38 g/L and renal function remained stable.Conclusion.

Here, we report our experience with Everolimus, a novel mTOR inhibitor, in patients with treatment-refractory cGVHD. Methods: We treated 31 patients with a median age of 57 (19-70) years suffering from refractory cGVHD with Everolimus. We assessed potential toxicities and the response to treatment using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and cGVHD Severity Score according to NIH Consensus Criteria as well as Everolimus plasma levels in a retrospective manner using patients' records. After written informed consent, we also performed actual and retrospective assessments of the subjective quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire) and of the degree of bother experienced by cGVHD symptoms (Lee Scale) in 22 out of these 31 patients. Nine patients were not assessable due to death (n=4), inability to comply (n=4), or refused participation (n=1). Results: Thirty-one patients were treated with an average daily dose of 1.1 (0.5-3.5) mg Everolimus for a median duration of 320 (44-819) days. Average plasma levels were ranging from 1.4 to 9.2 ng/mL. Most frequent observed grade 3/4 CTC toxicities were infections (n=16) and thrombocytopenia (n=6). Four patients died of infectious causes, three of whom were still on Everolimus treatment. No disease relapse occurred. Regarding the objective response to treatment, 12 patients improved, 17 remained formally stable, and 2 worsened. However, 17 of 22 patients showed an improved QoL according to EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (37.5% vs. 70.0%; p<0.001) and a decline in the median Lee Scale was noted in 20 of 22 patients (28 vs. 17; p<0.001). Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis, we found the majority of our patients to benefi t from Everolimus salvage therapy as shown by the signifi cant improvement of QoL and decline of bother even in cases where the formal cGVHD assessment suggested stability.

Pamuk, E. K\u00fcrek\u00e7i Gulhane Military Medical Faculty (Ankara, TR) Prolonged use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) could result in vitamin B12 defi ciency as a consequence of impaired release of protein-bound dietary vitamin B12 from food in a nonacid environment. We describe a case of vitamin B12 defi ciency associated with three months use of PPI in a patient with thalassemia major, during a chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) following hematopioetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A 12-year-old boy with thalassemia major underwent HSCT from his full matched 2 year old sister. His pretransplant vitamin B12 level was 202,6 pg/mL. Full engraftment was achieved, he was transfusion-independent with full single-donor chimerism and with good health condition until 13 months after the transplant. At that time he had presented with chronic cough and respiratory distress. He was diagnosed with cGvHD of the lungs. His vitamin B12 level was 345 pg/mL at that time. He received 2 mg/kg/day prednisolone and 1 mg/kg/day lansoprazole for three months until he had presented with paresthesia and weakness in his both arms and legs. Neurologic examination revealed normal except for a little sensation loss in his lower extremity. Spinal cord MRI and EMG fi ndings were normal. Vitamin B12 defi ciency because of prolonged use of PPI was suspected, his vitamin B12 level at the time was 94 pg/mL with macrocytosis and neutrophilic hypersegmentation on peripheral blood smear. Lansoprazole therapy was discontinued, he received parenteral 100 microgram/kg/week vitamin B12 for four weeks and all of his signs and symptoms resolved within that period. Malabsorption of dietary protein-bound vitamin B12 has been demonstrated with the prolonged use of PPIs. The malabsorption of dietary vitamin B(12) is thought to be a result of its impaired release from food protein, which requires gastric acid and pepsin as the initial step in the absorption process. It is recommended that patients taking these medications for extended periods of time, particularly >4 years, should be monitored for vitamin B12 status. This is the fi rst case in the literature who developed vitamin B12 defi ciency within a very short time of three months longstanding PPI therapy. The children with chronic graft versus host disease who are receiving prolonged PPI therapy should be closely monitored for vitamin B12 status independent of the therapy period.",

Bosi BMT (Florence, IT) Background: Immune-mediated hemolysis, allo/autoimmune, is a well-recognized complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The most common pathogenetic mechanism is incompatibility in red blood cell (RBC) antigens, mainly of the ABO system, between donor and recipient. However, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rarely recognized complication of HSCT, generally associated to chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). We report two cases of AIHA in a cohort of HSCT recipients from unrelated donor umbilical cord blood (UCB). Methods and Materials: From May 2006 to August 2011, 27 UCB transplantations (4/6 or 5/6 HLA matched) were performed by Our Centre (14 female, 13 male, median age 40 y, range 16-65). Diagnosis included 16 AML, 3 CML, 4 lymphoproliferative disease, one SAA, one ALL and one MDS. Six patients were transplanted with double UCB; six pts received a reduced intensity conditioning. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine + mycophenolate mofetil; 18 pts received also in vivo T depletion with antithymocyte globulin (ATG). AIHA occurred in two pts (both transplanted with a 4/6 HLA matched single cord blood unit after conditioning with Thiotepa, Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG): patient one was a 53 y old woman, affected by AML M4FAB, relapsed after autoHSCT. She developed at +235 cutaneous late onset acuteGVHD with atypical features, partially responding to steroids and extracorporeal photoapheresis. At +630, she manifested AIHA (Hb 4.7 g/dl, direct and indirect Coombs test +) resistant to immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and rituximab. Thereafter, she was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone, with improved level of hemoglobin at 4 months of follow-up. The second case was a 16 years old boy, affected by AML M2FAB, FLT3neg, t(6;9). He was transplanted without complications and developed AIHA at +115 days (Hb 5.5 g/dl, direct and indirect Coombs test+), resistant immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide and splenectomy. Therefore, he was treated by rituximab 100 mg/weekly and alemtuzumab 10 mg for 3 consecutive days with improved level of hemoglobin after 6 months of follow-up. Conclusions: AIHA is a rare complications after HSCT of adults recipients specially with CB graft, probably related to posttransplant immunosuppression inducing an immune dysregulation and graft directed cell destruction. We report two cases of AIHA steroids refractory in a cohort of 27 UCB HSCT adults recipients.",

Papanikolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) The frequency of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC-allo HSCT) is steadily increasing the last few years reaching nowadays approximately 40% of all transplantations. ATG is thought to facilitate engraftment and GVHD prevention although no randomized clinical trials have been conducted to test this. We retrospectively analyzed (11/1999-12/2010 ) the impact of ATG on the outcome of RIC-allo HSCT in 49 patients [31M, 18F, Deltam 52 years (14-63)] with various hematological malignancies who received preparative regimens containing fl udarabine and an alkylating agent either along with ATG -7,5 mg/kg (group A, n=28)-or without (group B, n=21). Most patients had unfavorable prognostic factors at diagnosis with no major differences between groups A and B in their baseline characteristics (33/49) being submitted to transplantation at an advanced stage of disease (29/49). Hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) was \u22652 in 22/49 patients being similar in the 2 groups. 7/28 (25%) and 11/21 (52%) developed acute GvHD (gr II-IV) from groups Alpha and Beta respectively, while 3 patients from each group succumbed due to gr IV aGvHD. Chronic GvHD was observed in 13/23 (56%) evaluated patients from group A and in 14/18 (78%) from group Beta (1 and 3 patients succumbed, respectively). Infections did not differ between the 2 groups neither during the fi rst 100 days nor later. Within a Deltam time from transplantation 10 (1-102) months, 15/20 (75%) evaluated patients from group A were refractory or relapsed (11 deaths) while from group B the respective percentage was 42% (4 deaths). The administration of ATG seemed to negatively infl uence overall survival (OS) [estimated 5year OS for groups A and B: 12% versus 41% respectively, (p=0,07)] while it did not affect Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) and Relapse Rate (RR), perhaps due to the small number of patients studied. Moreover, HCT-CI\u2265 2 had a negative impact on OS, TRM and RR (p<0,05), while the status of the disease was an adverse prognostic factor for RR (p<0,05). In conclusion, the results from this retrospective study may suggest that the a priori administration of ATG on RIC-allo HSCT should be reconsidered and may be limited to unrelated donor transplantations or to cases of incompatibility between donor and recipient.",

Blaise U2T (Marseille, FR) Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains a major concern affecting morbidity and mortality after AHSCT. We retrospec-tively reviewed 71 consecutive adult patients who underwent UCBT after reduced intensity conditioning regimen at our center to evaluate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD according to Seattle (classic) criteria and NIH consensus criteria, recently described. Cumulative Incidence (CI) of classic acute GVHD grade II-IV, grade III-IVand NIH acute GVHD were 0,34; 0,18 and 0.38 respectively. CI of Classic and NIH Chronic GVHDat 1-year were 0,35 and 0,29 respectively. There was no severe NIH cGVHD following UCBT. Overall response to immuno suppressive therapy for aGVHD and cGVHD were 89% and 100% respectively. OS and PFS at 3-years were 47% and 40% respectively. There was no impact of aGVHD on survival. We conclude NIH criteria are relevant for assessing GVHD following UCBT. Future clinical studies are warranted to evaluate prospectively GVHD through NIH criteria. These may allow a better understanding of biological mechanisms of GVHD following UCBT to establish adequate therapeutic strategy.",

Pastano, G. Andreola, F. Gigli, A. Gardellini, A. Montinaro, S. Liptrott, G. Martinelli European Institute of Oncology (Milan, IT) Haploidentical bone marrow transplantation using non-myeloablative conditioning and high-dose, post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) has been shown to be a feasible approach for patients lacking an HLA identical donor with acceptable rates of acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GVHD); in the attempt to reduce the associated risk of graft failure and relapse incidence we decided to apply the same conditioning regimen using unmanipolated mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBMSC). From April 2010 to November 2011, 10 patients, median age 54 (21-70), affected by high-risk hematological malignancies (4 acute myeloid leukemia, 3 lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 Hodgkin's Lymphoma, 1 myelodysplastic syndrome) and with no available HLA identical donor neither related or unrelated received the following conditioning regimen: Cy 14.5 mg/kg/day iv on days -6 and -5, fl udarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day iv on days -6 to -2, and 200 cGy of TBI on day -1. On day 0, patients received a median of 5.9x10 6 (4.4-8.8) CD34+ cells/kg with a median of CD3+ of 2.5x10 8 /kg (1.3-4.7) . On day +3 and +4 Cy 50 mg/kg was administered. From Day +5 patients received tacrolimus daily which was tapered off by day +180. Micofenolate Mofetile was given until day +35, 15 mg/kg orally tid. Patients received G-CSF 5 mg/kg/day from day +5 and continuing until ANC \u2265500/uL for 3 days. Disease status at transplant was the following: 3 progressive disease (PD), 1 SD, 5 complete remission (CR), 1 partial response. At a median follow-up of 152 days (42-463), OS is 60% with 3 patients in CR and 3 in PD. Grade I/II acute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (20%). No cGvHD was observed in 7 of 10 evaluable patients with a median time follow-up of 216 days (131-463). CMV reactivation occurred in 5/10 patients, resolved with preemptive therapy in 4 and caused a fatal infection in 1 heavily pretreated patient, with a cumulative non relapse mortality of 10%. Notably, no graft failure was observed. Achievement of full donor chimerism was rapid and complete on CD3+ cells in 7/10 evaluable patients by day +84. Our data show that haploidentical non-myeloablative PBMSC transplantation with high-dose post-transplant Cy is a feasible and safe approach for patients lacking an HLA identical donor. The use of unmanipulated PBMSC with the infusion of a greater number of CD3+ cells allows a rapid and sustained engraftment, reduces the risk of graft failure and seems not to increase the risk of GVHD. S420 progression-free survival and overall survival at 2 years from SCT were 67% and 80%, respectively.",

Beguin CHU of Li\u00e8ge (Li\u00e8ge, BE) Background: PET scan is increasingly used in the follow-up of lymphoma patients (pts). Whereas several studies addressed the question of the impact of PET positivity after autologous transplantation on transplantation outcomes, very few have been performed after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT). This is the aim of the current retrospective study. Methods: We analyzed data from 50 lymphoma pts who underwent an allo-HCT after non-myeloablative conditioning. The diagnoses were Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=8) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=42). PET scans were scheduled on days 100,180 and 365 and then yearly for a total of 5 years. Results: Day 100 PET scans were not performed in 5 patients. Among the remaining 45 patients, 20 (44.4%) presented hypermetabolic lesions, including 9 patients (20%) with lesions evocative of lymphoma.1-year overall survival (OS) (Figure 1 ) was lower in patients with typical lymphoma lesions than for those whose PET scan was negative or positive for infectious/ infl ammatory reasons (44% vs 85%, p=0.0013). Figure 1 : OS according to 1st PET scan on day 100 (0=complete response, 1=infl ammatory/infectious, 2=probably infl ammatory/ infectious, 3=residual disease, 4=progression or new lymphomatous lesion, 5=suspicion of other neoplasia). During follow-up, twenty pts (44.4%) never presented hypermetabolic lesions after transplant and 25 (55.6%) had at least one abnormal PET scan. Among the 25 patients, only 9 (20%) had probable/proven lymphoma: 3 residual diseases, 5 relapses and 1 non-biopsy proven progression. Two others pts (4.4%) presented another neoplasia (1 lung cancer and 1 lung PTLD). The 14 remaining pts (31.1%) had suspicious lesions at one of the follow-up PET scans, but none of these proved to be a relapse. Biopsies were performed in 6 of these cases, including 2 lymph node (1 normal and 1 lymphoid hyperplasia), 2 lung (1 normal and 1 aspergillosis) and 2 gastro-intestinal (1 normal and 1 Graft-versus-Host disease) biopsies. For 6 pts, imaging studies were normal or demonstrated infectious or infl ammatory disorders. The last 2 pts were thought to relapse based on both PET and CT scans, refused biopsies, but then their lesions regressed spontaneously.",

Todisco (1) Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients often have poor prognosis when primary refractory or relapsed after fi rst line treatment; salvage chemotherapy followed by high-doses chemotherapy and stem cells reinfusion (auto-SCT) represents the standard therapy. This treatment cures 15-30% of primary refractory and 50% of relapsed patients. New therapeutic strategies are necessary for those patients. Autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) followed by reduced intensity allogeneic SCT (tandem autoSCT-alloRIC) is a feasible approach exploiting high dose chemotherapy effect and graft vs. HL effect. In this retrospective study we compared the outcome of two groups of patients, not in complete remission (CR) after one or multiple salvage chemotherapy lines which performed a single autoSCT (n=34) or, in case of availability of an allogeneic donor, a tandem autoSCT-alloRIC (n=35). Patients groups were balanced: 70% were primary refractory and 30% relapses in both groups; 79% of autoSCT group and 69% of tandem group received one salvage chemotherapy line; 56% of autoSCT group and 40% of tandem group where in partial remission (RP) whereas the remaining patients in both stable (SD) or progressive (PD) disease before transplant. In comparing the two groups there wasn't difference in disease response after transplant procedures (30 days). Univariate analysis showed a statistically signifi cant advantage in progression free survival (PFS) for the tandem vs. the autoSCT group (11.5 vs. 6.6 months, p=0.013) and an advantage in overall survival (OS) not reaching statistical signifi cance (Nr vs. 35.3 months, p=0.165). In multivariate analysis patients treated with autoSCT have a progression risk 3 times higher compared to patients treated with tandem (HR 3.11 (1.67; 5.85 ), p<0.001). After autoSCT 24/34 patients progressed (70%) whereas 18/35 patients after tandem (51%). After a median follow up of 52 months, 20/34 patients (59%) of autoSCT group and 23/35 patients (66%) of the tandem group were alive, of those 16 (80%) and 19 (83%) respectively",

Autologous tumor cell lines, used as targets, were generated from all our patients and confi rmed to express membrane molecules (MIC A/B, ULBPs) recognized by CIK cells. We investigated the ability of CIK cells to kill mTIC. To identify mTIC, we transduced bulk melanoma cells with a lentiviral vector encoding for the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) regulated by the human OCT4 promoter. The underlying idea is that mTIC can be visualized based on their exclusive ability, proper of both normal and cancer stem cells, to activate the OCT4 promoter and consequently express eGFP. The average presence of eGFP+mTIC within bulk melanoma cells was 12.4 \u00b1 6.7%. CIK cells effi ciently killed autologous, eGFP+ sorted, mTIC; the average killing was 68%, 55%, 43% and 33% at 40:1, 20:1, 10:1 and 5:1 effector/target ratio respectively (n=5), results overlaid those observed against the counterpart of eGFP-tumor cells. We reported for the fi rst time the activity of CIK cells against autologous metastatic melanoma. The easy ex-vivo expansion and the MHC-unrestricted killing of CIK cells may favour their clinical translation. The effi cacy against putative mTIC can potentially address relevant clinical issues, targeting tumor cells responsible for chemo-resistance and disease relapse.",

Finlay Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, USC (Los Angeles, US) We report our to date experience in one child with recurrent metastatic anaplastic/large cell (A/LC) medulloblastoma. A 2.5 year old male presented in December 2008 with disseminated A/LC medulloblastoma. He received multi-agent induction chemotherapy January-April 2009, with radio graphic MRI response, followed by consolidation chemotherapy through June 2009, when brain and spine MRI demonstrated widespread leptomeningeal recurrence. He received 3600cGY craniospinal irradiation with 5400cGy posterior fossa boost July-August 2009. Within 4 months he began complaining of back and leg pains; brain and spine MRI were negative for CNS tumor; pelvic and spine MRI demonstrated widespread bone metastases. Iliac crest biopsy was positive for medulloblastoma. He received salvage chemotherapy April-August 2010 with achievement of incomplete remission with radiological evidence of persistence bone and bone marrow disease and no evidence of residual CNS disease. Attempt at harvesting autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells was unsuccessful. His 9 year old brother was histocompatible and the patient undergone conditioning chemotherapy with thiotepa, melphalan, etoposide and fl udarabine followed by Hematopoietic Stem Cell Stem Transplantation (HSCT) from his brother's bone marrow in September 2010. Pre-HSCT evaluation of his bone marrow with Low Density Arrays (LDA) showed evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) which resolved on re-evaluation post-HSCT. Radiological evidence of residual disease resolved approximately 6 month after BMT. He tolerated treatment uneventfully, and was discharged from hospital on day +47. He subsequently developed mild, transient skin chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). On Day+304 post-HSCT patient had asymptomatic radiological evidence of local recurrence in the brain posterior fossa of the brain with no evidence of extra-cranial metastases/recurrence. Subsequently, he received intra-omaya chemotherapy with stabilization of his recurrent disease and is currently receiving intra-omaya radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies with activity against GD2 protein.",

            "text": "Haploidentical SCT for neuroblastoma. A subtle balance between \"mini\" conditionings and \"mega\" grafts J. Kanold (1) The few reports analyzing outcomes of haploSCT in neuroblastoma (NB) that are available in the literature are heterogeneous because they include patients with refractory disease as well as patients who relapsed, patients in complete remission as well as patients in progressive disease (PD), pts transplanted after different conditioning regimens and with grafts obtained after relatively hetrogenous procedures of T-cell depletion. All of these factors preclude the possibility of drawing a reliable conclusion on the role of haploSCT in NB. We evaluated the feasibility and effi cacy of using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and transplantation of haploidentical PBSC to treat high-risk (initially stage IV refractory/relapsing) NB. 5 patients were enrolled, all after autoSCT: 4 after relapse and 1 with refractory disease. Median time from diagnosis to haploSCT was 28 months (13-77). The RIC included fl udarabine 180 mg/m 2 , busulfan 8 mg/kg and TBI 2Gy. CD3/CD19 cell-depleted maternal stem cells were infused on day 0 and no immunosuppression was given. 3 received post transplant donor NK cell infusions. RIC was very well tolerated with no TRM. 3 pts engrafted and 2 experienced graft failure (one patient rejected the graft and was rescued with autologous backup and one experienced \"nonengraftment\" and was retransplanted with stem cell from his father. One primary grade I acute GvHD was observed and successfully treated. One patient died of PD 6 months after transplantation (he was transplanted when in PD and received post SCT immunosuppressive treatment because of high dose of CD3+ cells in the graft). 4 patients are alive: 2 in PD (1 who was rescued with autologous cells), 2 are alive and well with short follow-up (1 after 2nd haploSCT). The fi rst aim of our study was to analyze faesability of haploSCT in NB. While it is diffi cult to draw defi nitive conclusions based on this low number of patients a speculative explanation for the poor result is the imbalance between transplantation-related factors, such as the type of conditioning, the lack of serotherapy, and the number of CD34+ and CD3+ cells, which infl uence on successful engraftment. To improve outcome of haplo for high-risk NB we shall reconsider: use of antithymocyte globulin, giving a graft with higher number of CD34+ cells and reassess amount of T-cell depletion. The last message of our study is that haploSCT should not be considered an option if stable remission is not achieved before transplantation. response (8pts), complete response (14pts), refractory disease (1pt). The conditioning regimen was busulfan and melphalan. Stem cell source was peripheral blood stem cells in 21 pts and autologous bone marrow in 2 pts. A medium of 6.73x10 6 nucleated cells per kg was infused. All pts achieved engraftment. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 12 days (range: 10-16 days), and to platelet engraftment was 11 days (range: 7-34 days). Two pts failed to achieve platelet engraftment. Transplant related complications were: hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (2pts), febrile neutropenia (21pts), bacteremia (4pts), candidemia (1pt), clostridium diffi cile colitis (1pt), pneumonia (1pt) and grade IV mucositis (15pts). One death occurred on day+20, due to VOD complicated by multi-organ failure. One secondary acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed 12 months after ASCT. Ten pts died due to progressive disease, which occurred at a median of 9 months after ASCT. Thirteen pts are alive with a median follow-up of 13 months after ASCT and 10 of them remain in complete remission. Conclusion: In this cohort of pts, conditioning regimen had acceptable toxicity, with only one death conditioning regimen-related. Metastatic disease was registered in 74% pts, which may contribute to poor prognosis, although, 43% of pts remain disease free.",

However, pts with primary pulmonary metastases treated either by conventional therapy or by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) fared better than pts with other metastatic sites. The experience of two centers, Rambam medical center and Tel Aviv medical center is described herein. Patients: Sixteen consecutive pts, 11 boys and 5 girls, underwent ASCT between the years 1999-2011. Median follow-up was 36 months (range: 7.9-152 months). Median age was 14 years (range: 2-21 years). Primary tumor site was in the pelvic area in 7 pts, chest in 3 pts, tibia in 2 pts, and spine, axila, humerus, and femor in 1 pt each. Degree of tumor necrosis after surgery was >90% in 9 pts, <90% in 6 pts, and no surgery in 1 pt. Thirteen pts were in 1st complete remission (CR) before transplantation, 2 were in 2nd CR, and 1 pt was in progressive disease. Indications for transplantation were pulmonary metastasis in 7 pts, relapse in 2 pts, poor response to chemotherapy in 5 pts, bone and BM spread in 1 pt, and pelvic mass >200 ml in 1 pt. Conditioning regimen included busulfan and melfalan (Bu/Mel) in 12 pts, and other regimens in 4 pts. Pharmacokinetic analysis of Bu plasma concentrations was preformed after the second dose of Bu. When the area under the curve (AUC) was found to be outside the therapeutic window 200 M\u00d7min), the drug dose was adjusted at the fi fth dose. Results: All 16 patients engrafted. Median time for neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (range: 10-17 days). No patient developed veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Eleven patients are alive. Causes of death were relapse post SCT in 4 pts and death due to CMV infection post SCT in 1 pt. Six years overall survival (OS) was 56%.Conditioning regimen with Bu/Mel achieved statistically signifi cant better OS compared to other regimens (P=0.0362). Eight years disease free survival was 41%. Six patients relapsed after SCT, only 2 survived. Conclusion: Six years OS of 56% was documented in a cohort of 16 consecutive ES pts after ASCT. Statistically signifi cant better OS was documented in patients receiving BU/Mel as conditioning regimen. Adjusting BU dose is important and may account for the lack of VOD demonstrated in our pts. , the TI-CE regimen is a new multi-cycle highdose chemotherapy (HDCT) regimen comprising a mobilizing phase with paclitaxel and ifosfamide (TI) followed by 3 HDCT courses with carboplatin and etoposide (CE) and hematopoietic progenitor cell support. We present preliminary results obtained at the Romagna Cancer Institute (I.R.S.T.) using this regimen at either fi rst or further relapse. Methods: From August 2009 to December 2011, 22 patients with relapsed/refractory GCT were referred to our Institute for salvage HDCT. Median age was 34 years. HDCT as fi rstrelapse salvage therapy was scheduled for 16 patients and as second-relapse treatment for the remaining 6.

Gevorgian (1) Aim: Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the second most common pediatric malignancies with an about 30% 5-year overall survival rate in high-risk group. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of single or tandem high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in this patient group. Methods: From October 2006 to September 2011, 11 pediatric patients with high-risk medulloblastoma (N=6), supratentorial PNET (N=3), and germinoma (N=2) received HDCT with auto-HSCT after induction chemotherapy and surgical treatment. At the moment of HDCT 3 patients were in complete remission (CR), 4 patients were in partial remission (PR) and 4 patients had stable disease (SD). Patients with germinoma received single auto-HSCT, patients with medulloblastoma or supratentorial PNET received tandem auto-HSCT. The conditioning regimen in the case of single auto-HDCT consisted of cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide. In tandem HDCT, a carboplatin and etoposide regimen \u00b1 thiotepa was followed by a thiotepa and cyclophosphamide regimen. Bone marrow (n=4), peripheral blood stem cells (n=4) or both (n=3) were used for stem cell sources. The mean transplanted CD34+ cell dose was 5.27x10 6 /kg (range, 1.0-8.9x10 6 /kg). Results: The median follow-up for living patients is 10 months (range, 3-60). All patients with SD at the moment of transplantation died due to progression. Three of 7 patients with CR or PR relapsed 1-9 months after HDCT, 2 of them were in 2nd remission prior to HDCT, the other 4 patients are currently in CR. The conditioning regimens used were characterized by reasonable toxicity (5 patients had grade 3-4 mucositis, 6 patients had grade 3-4 infection). The median time to engraftment was 16 (range 12-30) and 17 (range 13-86) days after the fi rst and second auto-HSCT respectively. Conclusions: HDCT with auto-SCT in pediatric patients with high-risk CNS tumors is characterized by acceptable toxicity and may be a feasible option for patients in CR or PR after induction chemotherapy. It is ineffective as a salvage therapy in refractory patients. using buffy coat pp65 CMV antigenemia before March 2005, and whole blood CMV DNA quantitative PCR thereafter. Positive CMV results were treated with pre-emptive IV ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Foscarnet was substituted in neutropenic patients or refractory cases. Seventy-three (87%) recipients were CMV seropositive before transplant and 68 (81%) received the graft from CMV seropositive donors. CMV reactivation was observed in 56 patients (67%) including 3 with organ CMV disease, 2 pneumonitis and 1 retinitis. At a 6.4 year median follow up, CML relapsed in 42 (50%) patients; 19 hematological and 23 molecular. Relapse free survival was signifi cantly better in CMV reactivating patients (10 year relapse free survival 31% vs 12%: P=0.004). Relapse was signifi cantly lower in CMV reactivating patients (10 year actuarial relapse probability 53% vs 79%: P= 0.004). In multivariate analysis, only CMV reactivation, donor-recipient sex match (female to male vs other) and disease stage (chronic phase vs more advanced) remained an independent factor for relapse and relapse free survival (p <0.01, <0.05, <0.001 respectively). We conclude that CMV reactivation in the recipient contributes to a benefi cial GVL effect in CML transplant recipients at any stage of disease. The mechanism is unclear but may be related to a bystander activation of innate or adoptive immunity by CMV in the bone marrow reservoir leading to enhanced cytotoxicity of leukemia cells.",

Beelen University of Duisburg-Essen (Essen, DE) Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) based on the WHO classifi cation is a leukemic disorder that demonstrates myelodysplastic as well as myeloproliferative features at the time of initial diagnosis. In approximately 25-40% of patients (pts), aCML evolves to acute leukemia, whereas the remainder die of marrow failure with a median survival time of less than 20 months with conventional therapy. The only potentially curative therapy is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A review of our database identifi ed 26 pts (17 male, 9 female) with aCML (Onida score: 0=14 pts, 1=8 pts, 2=4 pts) underwent allogeneic HSCT. The median age at diagnosis was 53 (19-64) years and at transplant 54 (20-66) years. Conditioning therapy included myeloablative regimens in 23 pts (15 TBI based and 8 chemotherapy based) and reduced intensity regimes in 3 pts. Stem cell source was 20 PBSC, 1 CD34 enriched PBSC and 5 BM. Nine pts received stem cell graft from HLA-identical sibling donor (1 twin donor) and 17 pts from matched unrelated donor (7 mismatched). GvHD prophylaxis consisted 21 CSA/MTX, one CSA/MMF, one CSA/antiCD52, one CSA only, and two without (twin and CD34 enriched). Twenty fi ve pts engrafted for granulocytes (ANC>0.5/nl) at median of 21 days (8-31) and 24 pts for platelets at 20 days , respectively. The most non hematological side effect grade \u22653 was mucositis. Early complete donor chimerism (>95%) was observed in 25/26 pts. Acute GvHD of grade \u2265 II occurred in 14 pts and chronic GvHD in 15 pts (10 limited and 5 extensive), respectivity. TRM was observed in 5 cases: sepsis (n=3), MOF/ GvHD (n=1), and cerebral toxoplasmosis (n=1). Two pts (twin and transplanted with highly selected CD34+ cells) relapsed after allogeneic HSCT and these pts were successfully retransplanted. 21 pts (80.8%) are still alive at median survival time of 91 months. Our fi ndings suggest that the outcome of allogeneic or syngeneic transplantation in pts with aCML are be feasible without severe TRM and may not be worse than the outcome of transplantation for bcr-abl positive CML.",

Analysis of the variables related to relapse and survival M. Cuadrado, A. Garc\u00eda-Noblejas, J. Cannata-Ortiz, A. Velasco, N. Acedo, B. Quereda, R. De la C\u00e1mara, \u00c1. Figuera, A. Alegre, J.L. Steegmann Hospital de La Princesa (Madrid, ES) Introduction: TKIs are the standard treatment for CML. As TKIs cannot be abandoned without almost 50% of relapse, allo-SCT remains the only curative option and the treatment of choice in advanced phases or failure to TKIs. Objectives: To analyze overall (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) after allo-SCT, and to study variables associated to relapse. Methods: Retrospective analysis to evaluate OS and RFS in CML patients recipients of allo-SCT in our hospital (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . Analyses were performed with SPSS 15.0. Results: Between 1995 In that period of time, only 25 were performed between since 2001. Most part of these patients were previously treated with Interferon and just 18 took TKIs treatment before transplantation. At transplant time, 75% were in chronic phase (CP) with a median age of 37 years (16-59). In 70% of them the donor was familial HLA identical. The 8 years OS was 60% and RFS 55%. Twelve patients died in the early time post-transplant (<120 days). Variables related to higher probability of death were: engrafment failure (HR: 13,9; p=0,003) score EBMT >2 ( HR: 5,2; p=0,02); and acute GVHD ( HR: 5; p=0,04). Previous treatment with TKIs was not signifi cant. The 12 years OS in patients in fi rst chronic phase was 65%. For relapse analysis, 123 patients were evaluable. 39 (31%) patients relapsed. Relapses were as follows: 39% molecular, 21% cytogenetic, 4% CP, and 36% blast crises (BC). The 8 year-PFS was 55%. Using Cox analysis we identifi ed two variables which were associated with statistically signifi cant lower probability for PFS: not achieving complete chimerism in any moment (HR 0,24: p=0.001), and having advanced phases at transplant (HR: 1,8 p= 0.066). The 12 years RFS in patients in fi rst phase chronic was 58%. Conclusion: In our study, median OS and RFS post-transplant is about 10 and 8 years respectively. Nearly 33% of patients relapsed and 39% of them did it as BC. The engrafment failure, score EBMT>2 and acute GVHD were signifi cantly linked to higher probability of death; and not to achieve complete chimerism and to have advanced phases at transplant were signifi cantly associated with relapse. These data emphasize the need of a closer control in patients treated with TKI's in order not to delay the transplant. Previous TKI's treatment doesn't seem to affect survival outcomes in allo-SCT.",

            "text": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard treatment for patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). Reported results show high rates of complete cytogenetic remissions and excellent long-term survival. Despite these impressive results, approximately 15% of CML CP patients receiving imatinib (IM) therapy will lose their hematologic or cytogenetic response and 1-3% will progress to more advanced phases of disease with inferior survival. For these pts allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains a potentially curative treatment option. Between Jan 2002 and Dec 2010, 23 pts initially diagnosed with CML in CP and treated with IM, (PFS) as primary endpoint. The randomized EBMT-Intergroup trial on the value of high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) compared to observation in fi rst or second remission of CLL demonstrated a substantial improvement of PFS without showing improved overall survival for transplanted patients (Michallet, Blood, 2011) . Here we report quality of life (QoL) information from that study. Methods: 222 patients were enrolled into the study and allocated to either ASCT or observation. QoL was assessed with the EORTC QLQ C30 version 3.0. QoL forms had to be completed at randomization and at months 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36. The QoL results are based on data from 186 patients. QoL-outcomes were analyzed with mixed models (1) according to the intent to treat (ITT) principle, (2) per protocol (PP) with the day of ASCT as time origin and (3) for the subpopulation of relapsed patients with the day of relapse as time origin. Time, the interaction of time and treatment arm (for (1)), remission status at SCT (for (1) and (2)), age, gender and group/country were modeled as fi xed effects. Results: The effects from the ITT model were largest at 4 months and signifi cant for almost all outcomes: e.g., global health status/ QoL -8.1* compared to observation arm; physical -10.3**, role -15.8** and social functioning -15.3**; fatigue +11.9** and appetite loss +15.0** (*p<.05; **p<.01). It seemed to take circa 12 months until resolution of the impact of ASCT. In the observation arm QoL did not decrease signifi cantly in the fi rst two years after randomization but most outcomes were worse after three years. Most likely, this was the result of the increasing percentage of patients with relapse which clearly affected QoL on all subsequent measurements negatively. Figure 1 shows the estimates of models (1)-(3) for 2 outcomes. Conclusions: High-dose therapy and ASCT delayed relapse, yet resulted in a substantial but transient decrease of QoL. The net effect in the ASCT arm was an inferior QoL in the fi rst year and comparable QoL until circa three years after randomization. Relapse resulted in a long lasting negative effect on QoL. Although currently ASCT plays no role in the treatment of CLL, this study demonstrates that in general QoL information should be taken into account when treatment decisions are based on an improvement of PFS.",

Since a signifi cant proportion of CLL patients never require antitumor therapy, we hypothesized that an autologous tumor-specifi c immune response is capable of controlling malignant disease.

Among sera of 87 untreated patients with CLL, 22 (25.1% with anti-ROR1 IgG antibodies) and 19 (21.8% with anti-ROR1 IgM antibodies) had detectable ROR1-antibodies. IgG subclass analyses showed a predominant IgG1 and IgG3 response. Notably, ROR1-antibodies were capable of recognizing and selectively killing ROR1-expressing CLL cells in complementmediated and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays. In 17 CLL patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), 88% exhibited signifi cant titers of anti-ROR1 IgG antibodies. In retrospective analysis we show that untreated CLL patients had a longer progression free survival, if patients' immune system is capable of developing anti-ROR1 antibodies. Our data provide evidence for the existence of a tumor specifi c humoral immune control in CLL patients.",

It\u00e4l\u00e4-Remes, M. Kauppila, M. Putkonen, K. Remes, M. R\u00e4met, U. Salmenniemi Turku University Central Hospital (Turku, FI) Outcome of patients with CLL double-refractory to fl udarabinebased regimens and alemtuzumab has been dismal, without any existing possibility of cure. The median survival has been only few months, and all patients succumb of their disease within one to two years. We describe a patient with refractory CLL, successfully treated with alloHSCT using sequential therapy including induction with FLAMSA (fl udarabine, HD-AraC, amsacrine) followed by slightly reduced myeloablative conditioning. A 47-year old female was diagnosed to have CLL in 2009, with normal karyotype and unmutated IgH gene. Disease progressed rapidly in January 2010, when blood leukocytes rose above 400x10 9 /l, lymph nodes being widely enlarged. Due to the aggressive course of the disease, treatment was started with fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide, and alemtuzumab. Because of liver toxicity, cytotoxic agents were omitted, and treatment was continued with single-agent alemtuzumab up to May 2010, which resulted in PR. ASCT was performed in December 2010. The response remained very short, with a blood lymphocyte rise already within one month after ASCT. Before the planned alloHSCT in March 2011, a rapid progression of the disease occurred. Blood leukocytes rose to 160x10 9 /l, and massive lymph nodes grew especially in the neck and abdomen. Instead of standard conditioning, FLAMSA induction was administered, with a rapid decrease of tumour burden. After three days rest, conditioning with HD-CY (120 mg/kg) and 8Gy TBI was administered. CyA, ATG, and short MTX were used as immunosuppression (IS). The patient recovered without any primary complications, and had CR and molecular CR in the bone marrow (ASO-qPCR <0.006%, FC <0.005%). Later she developed grade II skin GVHD at wk +4, and methylprednisolone (MP) was added. IS was tapered from wk 10 posttransplant, but was restarted at 3 months because of grade II skin GVHD. Skin GVHD responded well to MMF and MP but grade IV gut GVHD developed, being steroid-refractory but responding to alemtuzumab. In addition, tacrolimus and everolimus were administered until September 2011 when they all could be tapered off. Nine months posttransplant the patient is in molecular CR, symptomless and without any signs of GVHD. In conclusion, GvL effect obviously exists in CLL, and may have a curative potential even in the refractory disease. Moreover, sequential conditioning including induction with FLAMSA, as described in AML, seems to be feasible also in severe CLL.",

Biopsy specimens: skin (n=14), gastrointestinal tract (n=6) and oral mucosa (n=3) were analyzed for the composition of cellular infi ltrates (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD138) including detection of IL-17, FOXP3 and CCR6 positive cells. Co-expression of CCR6+/IL-17+ and IL-17+/CD138+ were verifi ed by double immunostaining. Results: (i) CD8+ prevailed over CD4+ lymphocytes in all oral and gut mucous biopsies but only in 8/14 skin biopsies (p=0.048). (ii) IL-17+ cells were seen in both mucosa (9/9) and skin biopsies (13/14) but in the mucosa they were signifi cantly more frequent (p=0.007) with a median value >10 cells in 5 HPF. (iii) IL-17+ cells infi ltrating the mucosa tissue were less frequently CCR6+ but more frequently CD138+ especially in the gut lesions as compared to the skin. (iv) FoxP3+ cells were rarely present at the tissue site but if seen their abundant presence was associated with mild clinical activity. (v) Presence of IL-17+ cells was associated with the severity of clinical manifestation and cases with tissue infi ltrations rich in IL-17+ had more frequently elevated levels of serum CRP than those with scarce presence of IL-17+ cells (8/11vs 2/11 respectively; p=0.03). Conclusions: CCR6 positivity of skin infi ltrating IL-17+ cells and CD138 positivity of those in the gut suggest different mechanism of IL17+ cells accumulation. Activity of IL-17+ cells is associated with the infl ammatory process refl ected by elevated levels of serum CRP.

Nevertheless, not all patients tolerate myeloablative conditioning due to age and comorbidities. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors for outcome of patients with MDS and MPN receiving myeloablative (MAC) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for HCT. Patients and Methods: The outcome of 109 patients transplanted between 2000 and 2010 with a median age of 57 (range 18-70) years and a median follow up of 46 (range 1-119) months were analyzed. Patients were diagnosed with MDS (n=71), MPN (n=25) and MDS/MPN (n=13). A total of 34 patients received MAC-HCT, consisting of 12 Gy TBI (n=21) or 16 mg/kg Busulfan (n=13) in combination with 120 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide, while 75 patients were treated with low dose TBI (either 2 or 3 Gy; n=69) or 8 mg/kg Busulfan (n=6) combined with Fludarabine. Patients undergoing RIC-HCT were signifi cantly older, had a higher EBMT risk score, more advanced diseases than patients in the MAC-HCT cohort. Results: Estimated overall survival (OS) was 64% and 33% (p=0.05), event free survival (EFS) 64% and 27% (p=0.1) and relapse incidence (RI) 8% and 42% (p=0.1) at 6 years following MAC-HCT and RIC-HCT, respectively. There was no difference in non relapse mortality (NRM) between the two groups (p=0.35). Patients after RIC had a signifi cantly lower incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GvHD; p=0.05), but not of chronic GvHD (p=0.28). In multivariate analysis testing age, EBMT score, lines of pre-treatment and GvHD severity there was no difference in OS for patients after RIC-HCT or MAC-HCT (p=0.11). However results confi rm a lower EFS (p=0.05) and a trend towards higher RI (p=0.09) after RIC-HCT. As expected, there was a higher RI for patients with advanced disease, while combined acute (grade I and II) and chronic limited GvHD had an impact on better OS (p=0.001), better EFS (p=0.01) and lower NRM (p=0.03)",

The cumulative incidence (CI) of NRM was 12% at 1 year [9% versus 16% for alloSCT from SIB and MUD (p=0.3)]. In total only 13 of 54 patients had acute GVHD (n=10 grade II, n=3 grade III) with an estimated CI of 23% at 100 days. Interestingly, acute GVHD was inferior in pts allografted from MUD donor where the ATG and R combination was used (11% versus 29% from MUD and SIB donors, respectively). The main infectious complications were: n=4 (8%) sepsis, n=10 (19%) pneumonia, n=3 (6%) viral (no CMV), n=2 (4%) fungal.

Conclusions: In our experience, ASCT plays a role in 2000\u00b4s in IL. It achieves high CR rate with prolonged PFS & OS. Relapses after ASCT can be rescued with new therapies including rituximab and novel agents in lymphoma, as lenalidomide, bortezomib and new monoclonal antibodies. So, long OS as aim in IL is nearer than ever. Introduction: The outcome of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains poor. Maintenance treatment with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab as well as high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) have improved survival of MCL patients. Based on this, we investigated the role of ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), a 90Yttrium labeled CD20 targeting antibody, as part of the conditioning regimen in MCL patients undergoing ASCT. Methods: This retrospective single center study analyzed 27 consecutive MCL patients receiving HDCT with rituximab and BEAM (R-BEAM) or Zevalin prior to BEAM (Z-BEAM) followed by peripheral ASCT. Zevalin was given at 14.8 MBq/kg on day -14 prior to ASCT while Rituximab was administered on the fi rst day of BEAM conditioning. Results: 18 patients received HDCT with R-BEAM and 9 patients had Z-BEAM. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 35-67). 85% had advanced-stage disease (stage III or IV), with 74% showing bone marrow infi ltration at diagnosis. 16% had blastoid variant and 84% had classical MCL.

The combination of CSP-A with methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can further reduce the risk of GVHD. Presented analysis retrospectively assessed the results of allogeneic SCT in regard of used three regimens of posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis -CSP-A only, CSP-A + MTX and CSP-A + MMF. Patients and Methods: CSP-A only was administered in 56 (37%), CSP-A + MTX in 38 (26%) and CSP-A+MMF in 56 (37%) allografted patients.

Gilleece  St James's University Hospital (Leeds, UK)    The major circulating vitamin D (VitD) is 25-hydroxyvitamin D3(25-OH-D3), produced by ultra-violet B irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin & subsequent hydroxylation in liver to 25-OH-D3. Further hydroxylation in kidney yields biologically active 1,25-OH-D3. VitD has immunomodulatory effects & low levels are epidemiologically associated with immune dysfunction, susceptibility to infection & malignancy. VitD therapy may ameliorate chronic graft-versus-host disease. United Kingdom prevalence of suboptimal VitD levels, varying with season, is 61-90%. Routine assay of VitD was incorporated in the pre-allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) evaluation at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) in 2009. 25-OH-D3 ranges (nmol/L) are defi ned: defi ciency <30, depletion 30-50, insuffi ciency 50-75 and replete >75 nmol/L. Overall, 96% of patients admitted for HSCT & assayed for VitD from 01/2009-06/2010 were non-replete, with no seasonal pattern. Routine prescribing practice was daily oral Calceos (50 mmol calcium & colecalciferol 800 international units (IU)). Cohort 1 (01/2009-06/2010): VitD assayed pre-HSCT in 47/55 indicated 40% defi cient, 33% deplete, 11% insuffi cient & 2% replete. Following regular Calceos therapy, VitD, measured at 3 months (m) post-HSCT, rose by a median of 9% (range 56-249) overall, with changes respectively of 46% (0-249), 7% (41-56) & 17%",

Volkova(1)   (1)The Russian Children's Hospital (Moscow, RU);(2)The Federal Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology (Moscow, RU); (3)The Russian National Research Medical University named by N.I. Pirogov (Moscow, RU)Effectiveness of Autologus hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in case of very severe forms multiple sclerosis (MS) is undoubted. The optimal conditioning regimen is the combination of cyclophosphamide and ATG/Campath. There are only a small number of AHSCT cases in very severe refractory secondary-progressive pediatric MS according the international experience. T-regulatory cells (T-regs) play a signifi cant role in immunological tolerance maintenance and inhibition of autoimmune aggression. Objective: Evaluation of the AHSCT effectiveness in very severe refractory cases of secondary-progressive pediatric multiple sclerosis. T-regs level assessment at a patients with MS in the context of AHSCT. Patients and Methods: The survey includes 5 cases of pediatric MS duration 3-4 years treated with corticosteroids, interferonbeta and plasmapheresis with negative dynamics on this therapy. Patient's EDSS score and dynamics described on picture 1.All the patients had approved MS diagnosis with signifi cant neurological disturbances, severe infl ammatory lesions with the contrast accumulation on MRI and positive oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fl uid. Mean EDSS -7.0 points. S230 Procedures: Stem cell mobilization: Cyclophosphomide, G-CSF. Conditioning: Cyclophosphomide 200 mg/kg and ATG \"Fresenius\" 40 mg/kg or equivalent. Myeloinfusion on day 0. G-SCF stimulation from day +5. Intravenous immunoglobulins 10% (IVIGs) administration according the IgG serum level. Study design: 1. Clinical examination; 2. MRI; 3. Lymphocytes subpopulation assessment; 4. T-regs level evaluation; 5. Toxicity control. Results: All the patients showed fast improvement during early post-AHSCT period. Maximal EDSS improvement -5.5 points, mean -3.5 points. In patient 4 -to 1.0 points. All the patients in remission now. Maximal observation period -22 months.Expressed positive dynamics registered on MRI too. T-regs assessment showed its level increasing and stabilization after the AHSCT. Usage of IVIGs allows protecting patients against the infections during the cytopenic period and improving neurological status in prolonged period. Conclusion: AHSCT is the effective way of autoimmune infl ammation reduction and successful approach for treatment of very severe secondary-progressive pediatric MS. This approach is not only life-saving method, but signifi cantly improves quality of patient's life. In-time AHSCT can minimize the disability level.P696Early versus late autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in multiple sclerosis patients: analysis of treatment outcomes A.A.

Cellular therapy with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) following transplant allows to improve immune reconstitution and enhances graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. Materials and Methods: We present our results of 43 transplants performed in children with hematologic malignancies from 2004 to 2011. Main diagnosis was: ALL (n=19), AML (n=16), CML (n=3), MDS (n=1) and NHL (n=4). They were transplanted using a fl udarabine-RIC and grafted with CD34+ selected PBPC of an HLA-identical (n=39) or one mismatched related donor (n=4). Median age was 8 years (range, 1-16 years) . There were 25 male and 18 female. Disease status was 1st CR in 26, 2nd CR in 13 and >2nd CR in 4. It was the 2nd transplant for 2 patients. All conditioning regimens included fl udarabine combined with melphalan from 2004 to 2005 (n=12) and with iv busulphan and thiotepa since 2006 to 2011 (n=31). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted on cyclosporine \u00b1 methotrexate. A median of 2 DLI (range, 0-8) with 1x10 6 CD3+/Kg (range, were infused after transplant. Results : With a median follow-up of 3 years, disease-free-survival (DFS) was 73\u00b17% ( Figure 1 ). Relapse incidence was 27% and transplant-related-mortality was 5%. Acute and chronic GvHD incidence was 17% and 35%, respectively. Ratio CD4+/ CD8+ normalized 6 months after transplant. In multivariate analysis of DFS the prognostic factors were conditioning (86\u00b17% with fl udarabine-busulfan-thiotepa and 46\u00b115% with fl udarabine-melphalan, p<0.005) and age (93\u00b16% in children and 54\u00b111% in infants and adolescents, p<0.005). Conclusion: The combination of RIC and transplantation of CD34+ selected grafts resulted on fast engraftment and immunological recovery avoiding severe GvHD preserving the GvL effect.",

Patients and Methods: Between 2000 and 2010 in 14 Polish centers 1607 patients were diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Based on cytogenetic or molecular study 64 patients (4%) were found to have Philadelphia positive ALL (Ph+ALL).There were 36 (56%) males and 28 (44%) females, median age of these patients was 8 years and 2 months. Patients with Ph+ALL were classifi ed as high risk group and their treatment included induction with prednisone, vincristin, doxorubicin and asparaginase (phase 1) followed by cyclophosphamide, ARA-C and merkaptopurin Patients with identifi ed match related donor were offered allo-HSCT after third course of consolidation therapy. Results : Induction failure occured in 3 patients (5%), two of them, however, responded to treatment and achieved late remission and fi nally underwent HSCT. Seven (10%) patients died in remission from treatment related complications during induction and consolidation. Thirty one patients (31/56) underwent allo-HSCT in fi rst CR. Thirteen children were treated with imatinib along with induction and/or consolidation therapy. Decision to add imatinib to treatment protocol was made on individual basis by the local physician and twelve of these patients underwent allo-HSCT. Overall survival (OS) of the Ph+ALL patients in our group was 0,69 at 3-years and 0,55 at 5 years follow-up. There were no differences in OS between transplanted and not transplanted patients: 3-year OS was 0,71 and 0,68 and 5-years OS was 0,52 and 0,58 subsequently. No difference in OS was found also between patients treated and not with imatinib: 3-years OS was 0,66 and 0,68 subsequently. In group treated with imatinib we noted signifi cantly lower relapse rate (1/13, 8%) as compare to remaining patients achieving fi rst CR (14/43, 27%) however in this group higher number of treatment related deaths occurred after HSCT 5/13 (38%) as compare to patients treated without imatinib 4/43 (9%). Conclusion: We concluded that alloHSCT in fi rst CR may not improve outcome of pediatric Ph+ALL patients. Adding imatinib to treatment protocol could be associated with higher treatment related mortality but seems to improve remission rate in this patients. Further study are necessary for optimizing treatment of Ph+ALL pediatric patients.",

The anti CD3 specifi c OKT3 antibody was routinely used as rejection prophylaxis without affecting CD56+ NK cells. However, due to its restricted availability, the substance has to be substituted by polyclonal ATG preparations comprising also the CD56 antigen. We present data with reduced ATG doses given at start of the conditioning regimen in order not to impair cotransfused NK cells. A total of 15 patients (ALL n=4, relapsed solid tumors n=9, SAA, SCID n=2) received either 3x5 mg/kg (n=7) or 3x10 mg/kg (n=8) ATG-F (Fresenius) starting at day -12, followed by fl udarabine (160mg/m 2 , day -8 to -5) thiotepa (10 mg/m 2 day -4) and melphalan (140 mg/m 2 day -3 to -2). A median number of 13,8x106 CD34/kg and 64x106 NK cells/kg with 16x103 T cells/kg was infused. Median time to ANC>500 was 9 days in both groups. Graft rejection occurred in 3/7 patients with 15 mgATG (42%) and in 0/8 patients with 30 mg ATG. After reconditioning, fi nal engraftment was achieved in all patients. Acute GvHD grade II-IV was observed in 1/7 (15 mg) and 0/8 (30 mg) patients. Chronic GvHD occurred in 1 patient (15 mg group). Immune recovery of CD56+ NK cells was fast with a mean number of 461 vs 413 cells/\u03bcl at day +14, 448 vs 294 cells/\u03bcl at day +30 and 206 vs 147 cells/\u03bcl at day +90. CD3+ T cells reached 109 vs 16/\u03bcl at day +30 and 120 vs 68/\u03bcl at day +90 (15 vs 30 mg group). ATG serum levels were measured in 8 patients with fl ow cytometry (amount of ATG binding to the Jurkat cell line, defi ned as specifi c rabbit IgG). Median peak levels of 11.4 \u03bcg/ml (15 mg group) and 15.8 \u03bcg/ml (30 mg group) specifi c rabbit IgG were reached between day -8 and -6 and dropped to 1.2 and 3.1 \u03bcg/ml at day 0. Conclusions: Our aim was to substitute OKT3 by ATG in patients who receive CD3/19 depleted haploidentical peripheral stem cells without hampering immune recovery and donor NK cells infused on day 0. Administration of 15 or 30 mg/kg ATG-F was started at an early time point (day -12) of the regimen. Both doses resulted in low serum levels of specifi c ATG at day 0 and in a fast NK cell recovery. T cells recovered slightly faster after 15 mg/kg than after 30 mg/kg of ATG. However, 15 mg/kg seemed to be less effective in preventing graft rejection. Thus, we recommend to use 30 mg/kg of ATG-F in this setting. Further investigations are necesssary to confi rm these data.",

Gaslini Children's Hospital (Genoa, IT) ; (2) Galliera Hospital (Genoa, IT) Introduction: Children are generally considered at reduced risk of severe acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD), even Chronic Granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited dis order of the NADPH oxidase characterized by severe bacterial and fungal infections and excessive infl ammation affecting 1 in 200,000 persons. Even with the best antimicrobial prophylactic treatment, patients experience frequent hospitalizations and only 50% of patients are alive at 30 years. Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) provides curative therapy for patients with CGD, although controversy exists over the requirement for BMT in all patients, and the optimal timing for any BMT procedure. This patient was diagnosed at age 16 months with X linked CGD (CYBB gene mutation)after poor response to antimicrobial therapy for bilobar pneumonia. After no clinical response following 3 months of antimicrobial therapy he was referred to the surgical team for decortication by VATS procedure at age 19 months. Pulmonary complications included ECMO therapy, mechanical ventilation and several surgical procedures. He was treated on an outpatient basis with a 9 month prolonged combination of three antimicrobial agents and steroid pulses. He was observed off antimicrobial therapy for 6 months followed by serial ESR and CRP biweekly. He was then brought to Reduce Intensity Conditioning (RIC) Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) BMT utilizing distal Alemtuzumab days -23 to -21 at 10, 15 and 20 mg followed by 150 mg/m 2 of Fludarabine over 5 days (-8 to -4) and 140 mg/m 2 of Melphalan on Day -3. He received 12/12 MUD Bone Marrow at TNC of 4.35 \u00d7 10 8 /m 2 . GVHD prophylaxis used Methotrexate 7.5 mg/m 2 Days +1,3 & 6 along with Tacrolimus and Methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone was started at Day +7 and initially planned to taper off by day +56 but prolonged to Day + 90 due to skin GVHD. He tolerated the transplant well with the one functioning lung. He engrafted neutrophils at Day +13 and at 6 month follow up maintains a 100% donor chimerism with a normal dihydrorhodamine-1, 2, 3 test. Reduce Intensity Conditioning with subsequent Bone Marrow Transplant is a promising treatment modality for fragile CGD patients and should be considered and offered even in the Matched Unrelated Donor setting.",

K\u00fcrek\u00e7i Gulhane Military Medical Faculty (Ankara, TR) Glutamine (Gln) is a conditionally essential amino acid during high dose chemo-radiotherapy especially for enterocytes. It isS386 unclear whether supplemental glutamine is of benefi t in hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Reviews and guidelines in the area have given confl icting advice. We therefore conducted a retrospective study to determine the effect of oral Gln supplementation in children undergoing HSCT. A retrospective study of 76 (42 male, 34 female) HSCT recipients with a mean age of 8 years (1, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , who received myeloablative regimen at our center between July 2001 and October 2011 was undertaken. Of these patients 19 didn't receive Gln (control group), 25 received 1 g/m\u00b2/day (group 1), 32 received 2 g/m\u00b2/day (group 2) oral Gln. Gln was given beginning on the day of myeloablative regimen until discharge as swish and swallow administiration every twelve hours. Patients were examined daily and OM was graded, based on WHO scale. Analyses examined the difference of clinical outcomes between groups including beginning, incidence and duration of the OM, incidence and duration of fever and diarrhea, number of documented infection, neutrophil engraftment, aGVHD, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), inpatient days and mortality rates. Patients in the supplemented group (group 2 and 1) had statistically signifi cant shorter fever duration than patients in the control group (4,0 \u00b1 2,4; 4,2 \u00b1 2,7 and 6,0 \u00b1 2,7 days respectively; p = 0.001). Patients in group 2 had statistically signifi cant lower SOS incidence than patients in the group 1 and control group (0/32; 2/25; 5/19 respectively; p=0.031 ). There were no statistically signifi cant difference between the groups in OM and also in the other selected outcomes above. Gln doesn't appear to be benefi cial in reducing mucositis and most of the other complications of HSCT. In our study, the duration of fever was found to be signifi cantly decreased in the supplemented group. However, there was no signifi cant difference in the incidence of documented infection between groups. Several reports like ours suggest benefi cial effects of gln supplementation in HSCT in protection from SOS. But there are also studies reporting increased relapse risk with glutamine. Careful consideration should be given to include oral Gln supplementation as a routine part of supportive care of children underwent HSCT.",

Aric \u00f3 AOU Meyer Children Hospital (Florence, IT) Background: Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a congenital immune defi ciency, resulting from biallelic mutations in the PRF1 (FHL2), Munc13-4 (FHL3), Syntaxin11 (FHL4), STXBP2 (FHL5) genes which cause variable defects of the cellular cytotoxicity machinery. Chemo-immunotherapy allows temporary disease control, but HSCT holds as the only procedure with potential for cure. Myeloablative conditioning regimens have been largely used in the past, providing stable graft in the majority of patients but at the price of relevant toxicity. To minimize the TRM, reduced intensity conditioning regimens were introduced, but this was associated with a higher proportion of patients resulting in mixed chimerism. Thus, the selection of the conditioning regimen with or without immunotherapy may turn to be crucial for the outcome of SCT and fi nal cure. Results: The main features of the four female children, consecutively treated in our center, are summarized in the table. GVHD prophylaxis was based on cyclosporine + methotrexate; methotrexate was omitted in case 1, with UCB donor. All children are alive after a follow-up time comprised between 3 months and 3 years. None of the children developed VOD nor FHL reactivation. Yet, the only patient who did not receive serotherapy (either ATG or Alemtuzumab) developed mixed chimerism with a residual proportion of donor cells of 10%, despite DLIs. Conclusion: In our experience serotherapy contributed to successful engraftment and disease control in FHL. Optimal dose and time of administration should further addressed.",

We analysed risk factors infl uencing engraftment. In univariate analysis; HLA-match was associated with increased risk of engraftment (p=0.005). While 10/10 HLA-matched transplants compared with HLA-1 mismathed, HLA-matched transplants showed better engraftment rate (p=0.005). In cord blood group, engraftment rate was lower (BM & CB p=0.003; PBSC & CB p=0.01). In cord blood group, graft failure was seen 25%. While in BM group, TNC and CD34+ cell dose were associated high engraftment rate (p=0.001); in PBSC group CD34+ cell dose was found more signifi cant (p=0.001). In cord blood group; CD34+ cell dose was more important for engraftment (=0.002). However, there is no difference in multivariate analysis. The gender, patient's age, donor's age, conditioning regimen, mismatch locus, ABO mismatching and patient-donor CMV sero status have no effect on engraftment. We didn't fi nd any difference between MSD and MUD transplant results about engraftment. Conclusion: Graft failure is still contributing factor to morbidity and mortality of HSCT. This study suggested that HLA-matching, stem cell source and cell dose are infl uencing factors on engraftment in patients with benign disease. Cord blood seems to be an important factor to development of graft failure. Further studies are needed to fi nd risk factors infl uencing engraftment.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University (Antalya, TR) Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment modality for a range of life-threatening diseae in children. The long-term survival rates in children and adolescents have been increased over last years. Neurological complications are considered an important cause of treatmentrelated morbidity and mortality after HSCT. In the present study, we therefore analysed incidence and etiological factors of neurological complications following paediatric HSCT. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 240 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at Akdeniz University Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit for benign diseases from 1998 to June 2011 for the development of post transplant neurological complications. After HSCT, neurological complications developed at 27 (11.2%) patients. The mean of age was 8.8\u00b15.8 years. Male/female ratio was 14/13. The diagnosis of patients were shown Table 1 . Donors were matched sibling donor (MSD) in 6 (51.9%), matched family donor (MFD) in 7 (25.9%), unrelated donor in 6 (22.2%). Peripheral blood stem cell was used in 16 (59.3%) tranplantation. These neurological symptoms were consisted of convulsion (n=19), headache and vomiting (n=5), encephalopathy (n=3), visual abnormalities (n=3). These neurologic symptoms were cause of PRESS (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) probably due to cyclosporine-A and tacrolimus (n=7), drug toxicity-cyclosporine-A and busulphan (n=8), infections (n=5), intracranial hemorrhage (n=3), hypomagnesemia (n=2), hyperviscosity (n=1). Neurological complications with MFD were seen signifi cantly more than MSD transplantation (p=0.02). Neurological complications were developed signifi cantly more in patients with acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD), grade II-IV aGvHD and cGVHD than without GvHD (respectively p=0.002, p=0.001 and p=0.007). Mortality was signifi cantly more high in patients with neurological complication (p<0.005). Conclusion: In this study; the frequency of neurological complications was %11.2. We showed that MFD, aGvHD, Grade II-IV aGvHD and cGvHD were signifi cant risk factors to development of neurological complication. Neurological complications were signifi cantly associated high mortality. We concluded that pediatric transplant patients especially received profound immunesuppressive drugs used must be followed closely for development of neurological complications because of high morbidity and mortality rates.[P1023]",

Castagnola, E. Lampugnani, S. Giardino G. Gaslini Children's Hospital (Genoa, IT) Introduction: Survival of children treated with chemo and/or radiotherapy is improved over the last decades, but some patients might need to be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for the occurrence of life threatening complications. Aims of this study were to report incidence,different causes and risk factors for ICU admission;and 60 days survival after ICU admission by different risk factors. Patients and Methods: Pediatric patients (0-18) yrs in treatment at the Hemato-Oncology Department of Gaslini Children Research Institute during the period January 1999 October 2010 were eligible, with exclusion of children with brain tumours. Data were collected on age at study entry, gender, underlying disease, type of stem cell transplantation (SCT) (autologous; allogeneic matched related donor, MRD; matched unrelated, familiar not fully matched, alternative donor (AD); and umbilical cord blood transplant, UCB). Results: 1278 patients were eligible and 54 (4%) were admitted in ICU. Table 1 reports frequency and risk factors analysis for ICU admission. Probability of ICU admission varied by underlying disease (p<0.001) with higher frequency for inborn errors, Fanconi anemia and immunodefi ciency (22%). Older children (p=0.016), those treated with SCT (p<0.001) and in particular those who received AD (p<0.001) were some likely associated with ICU admission. Respiratory failure was the cause of ICU admission in 23 patients (43%), septic shock in 8 (15%),severe neurological events in 18 (32%), and severe toxicity chemo/ radiotherapy/SCT related in 5 (10%) . Within 60 days from ICU admission 27 children died for a overall survival of 50%. Mortality was higher in children with malignancy respect other disease (60% vrs 25%, p=0.017) and in those who needed mechanical intubation (p<0.001), while gender, type of diagnosis, age at ICU admission (<9 yrs vrs \u22659 yrs), year of ICU admission (<2005 vrs \u22652005), cause of ICU admission, SCT and type of SCT, type of conditioning regimen were not statistically associated with 60 days mortality. Conclusions: In our experience age at study entry, underlying disease and SCT represent the risk factors for ICU admission. Regarding the cause of admission, respiratory failure was the most frequent but did not infl uenced the mortality of these patients, while malignancy and mechanical intubation were associated with higher mortality. The effort should be to early recognized patients who need to assisted ventilation and when possible to perform not invasive ventilation in department of belonging.[P1033] Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the mainstay of curative treatment for thalassemia major. None the less, this therapeutic procedure can potentially compromise health related quality of life (HRQoL) and social life. There is generally a lack of evidence-based data on the long term effects of HSCT, when patients are no longer under the care of the transplant center. This is the fi rst report to provide a cross sectional assessment of HRQoL in thalassemia-free patients after a mean of 20 years from HSCT. One hundred and eight Sardinian patients, transplanted from a sibling donor in Pesaro and Cagliari during the eighties and nineties were selected from the Sardinian Regional Government Health Department's Registry. From August to November 2011, an internationally validated HRQoL questionnaire (SF-36) and a demographic/clinical form were sent to patients and their sibling donors. By the end of November 2011, we received fully completed questionnaires from 54 patients (26 females and 28 males) and 41 sibling donors. Mean age at transplantation was 13.9 (currently 37.9 yrs) and 17.9 (currently 41 yrs) for patients and donors, respectively. The medium follow up from HSCT was 20.8 years (range 13.6-29.4). Sixty-seven percent of patients and 80% of donors are currently working. Among patients, 40% are living with a spouse/partner (donors=61%) and 14.8% had 1 or more healthy babies (donors=31%). Sixty-three percent of patients belong to a social network (donors=46%). Acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) were reported in 29.6% and 18.5% of patients, respectively. An active illness was reported in 74% of patients (hepatic, pulmonary, endocrinologic, infectious) and 54% are still taking drugs. Patients and donors reported similar HRQoL scores in 5 of 8 subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire (role-physical, body pain, general health, roleemotional and mental health). Signifi cantly lower scores were registered among patients for physical functioning, social functioning and vitality. Clinical, socio-demographic and HRQoL data collected 20 years after HSCT show that thalassemia-free patients experience favorable social and working conditions. Most dimensions of HRQoL were comparable to those of the control population of sibling donors. Lower scores in some scales can possibly be explained by current illness and drug therapies. These data provide further insight into the choice of HSCT for a chronic and non life-threatening disease.",

Based on this observation, recent studies provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of the haemoglobin switching in order to induce the HbF production in adult haemopoietic cells. A strong support to such novel approaches comes from recent clinical",

Experience with HSCT is available but limited, and outcome data is needed to plan the best treatment regimen. Aim: We report data on 28 patients with a severe OP phenotype who underwent HSCT in our center from 1983 to 2011. Methods: 22 boys and 6 girls (aged 1 month to 3 years, median 6 months), who underwent 29 allogeneic HSCTs were included in this retrospective study. In the fi rst twelve patients (group 1) transplanted prior to 1996 the conditioning regimens included busulfan (Bu) 16 mg/kg with cyclophosphamide (Cy) 200 mg/kg in 5 patients, in four patients Bu 16 mg/kg + Cy 200 mg/kg was augmented with thiotepa, two additional children were conditioned with a combination of total body irradiation and Cy and one more patient received Bu-mitoxantron-Cy. In four of these 12 patients alemtuzumab was added to the conditioning regimen. Sixteen children transplanted after 1998 (group 2) received a fl udarabine-based regimen. Nine patients were conditioned with fl udarabine-busulfex and in fi ve children thiotepa was added to the fl udarabine-busulfex backbone. Two patients who underwent haploidentical transplantation were prepared with fl udarabine-busulfex-melphalan and treosulfancyclophosphamide, respectively. All but two children from this group received additional serotherapy (ATG). In the fi rst group, donors included 10 matched siblings, 1 matched family and one mismatched family donor. In the second group 10 donors were full matched siblings, four matched family donors and two family mismatched donors. Follow up through November 2011 ranged from 2 to 280 months. Results: In group 1, 5 patients (42%) are alive with a median follow up of 216 months. All of them survive with complete clinical, immunologic and hematologic recovery. In group 2, all children survive, with 15/16 showing stable long term engraftment. One child who underwent a haploidentical transplantation demonstrated graft loss and was successfully retransplanted. Three of fi ve surviving patients in group 1 developed cGvHD compared with none in group 2. Conclusion: HSCT in children with OP is associated with a very favorable outcome after fl udarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning. Further studies to determine the best conditioning regimen and optimal alternative donor selection are required.Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease P1045 NIH-defi ned chronic graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-leukaemia effects in patients receiving allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia T.H. Terwey, T.M. Le Duc, P.G. Hemmati, L.G. Vuong, P. le Coutre, B. D\u00f6rken, R. Arnold Charit\u00e9, Campus Virchow-Klinikum (Berlin, DE) Objective: In 2005 a NIH consensus conference has introduced precise diagnostic criteria and a new severity score for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). The new criteria are well accepted by the community but data regarding their prognostic value in specifi c indications remains limited. We therefore retrospectively analyzed NIH-defi ned cGVHD in 147 consecutive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received a fi rst myeloablative transplant at our center between 1995 and 2009. A subgroup analysis was performed in patients who received pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Methods: Median age was 31 years. Disease status was CR1 (50%), CR>1 (22%) or no CR (28%). Conditioning consisted of 12 Gy TBI \u00b1 etoposide \u00b1 cyclophosphamide. Donors were HLA-matched related (42%), -matched unrelated (46%) or -mismatched (12%) and peripheral blood stem cells (74%) or bone marrow (26%) were given. GVHD-prophylaxis consisted of CSA/MTX (72%), CSA/prednisolone (19%) or other CSA-based regimens (9%). 44 patients with mixed chimerism or minimal residual disease without GVHD after cessation of immunosuppression received DLI at a median of 138 days. Results: Median follow-up was 60 months. Projected overall survival (OS) at 1, 2 and 5 years was 61%, 52% and 43%. 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 33% and of non-relapse mortality (NRM) 26%. Median time until onset of cGVHD was 121 days (ranger: 24-464) after transplant and 92 days (14-294) after DLI (P=NS). The cumulative incidence of cGVHD was 36% after transplant (mild 7%, moderate 11%, severe 18%) and 58% in patients who received DLI (mild 21%, moderate 14%, severe 23%). cGVHD was subclassifi ed as overlap syndrome vs. classic cGVHD in 62% vs. 38% of transplant cases and 56% vs. 44% of DLI cases (P=NS). Organ involvement was similar for transplant and DLI, with the exception of GVHD of the lung which was not observed after DLI. In multivariate Cox regression analysis with GVHD as time-dependent covariate cGVHD was associated with superior OS which was due to lower relapse incidence (Table 1) . Classic and overlap cGVHD",

Freund (1), R. Andreesen (2) , E. Holler (2) (1)University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) ; (2) University of Regensburg (Regensburg, DE) Introduction: The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (R) is frequently applied for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD) or transplant-related autoimmune-conditions like immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). We retrospectively evaluated the effi cacy of R for the treatment of cGvHD within the Regensburg and Rostock University transplant program. Methods: 32 allogeneic stem cell recipients with a median age of 47.5 years (range 19-65) receiving R for cGvHD (moderate n=10, severe n=16) or isolated transplant-associated ITP (n=6) at a median of 913 d (range 127-2878) after stem cell transplantation were evaluated with a median follow-up of 912 d (range 36-2152) after R therapy. Cutaneous manifestations were observed in 24 patients and 16 patients suffered from fasciitis. 14 patients (ITP n=4, cGvHD n=10) received R as 2nd-line treatment and 17 patients (ITP n=1, cGvHD n=16) after failure of 2nd-line treatment, while 1 ITP-patient received R as 1st-line treatment. One treatment course consisted of 4 doses of 375mg/m 2 applied at weekly intervals. Seven patients received 2 courses of R. Results: In the ITP group complete response (CR) was achieved in 4 patients, partial response (PR) in one patient, no response in one patient. Four patients received steroids as additional therapy, two R as monotherapy. In the cGvHD group response was evaluable 24 of 26 patients: 4 patients achieved a CR, 8 patients a PR, 7 patients showed a non durable minor response and 6 patients failed R treatment. Apart from one non-responder all patients received R as part of a multi-agent regimen. All 6 cGVHD-patients receiving a 2nd course of R as part of a multi-agent regimen achieved a PR. Of note, 15 patients (47%) developed severe infectious complications requiring hospitalization at a median of 123 d (range 53-891) after treatment initiation, including 3 patients with intensive care treatment. Six patients died between day 36 and 567 after their 1st R course, from infectious complications (n=5) or pulmonary embolism (n=1). Conclusions: R as part of a multi-agent therapy was associated with a signifi cant response rate in ITP and to a lesser extent in cGvHD. Patients with severe cGVHD suffer from immunodefi ciency per se and the high frequency of infectious complications after R therapy suggests that it should be reserved for patients failing 2nd-line treatment and requires monitoring for opportunistic infections and intensifi ed anti-infectious prophylaxis should be considered. The introduction of toxicity-reduced conditioning opened up the vista of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) also for elderly patients (pts), aged 60y or more. However, up to date published evidence on the outcome of allo-SCT in this pt cohort is fairly limited by small pt numbers and/or short followup. This report summarizes our cumulative experience in a cohort of 163 consecutive elderly pts (age 60-73, median 63y) allografted from 2000 to 2010. Diagnoses were acute leukemia with active disease (group 1: induction failure n=25, untreated relapse n=22, refractory relapse n=12, RAEB n=25, CML-BC n=2), high risk acute leukemia in CR (group 2: n=28), and chronic diseases (group 3: mpn n=23, mds/mpn n=7, rcmd n=4, myeloma n=9, low grade B-cell neoplasm n=6). All pts received toxicity-reduced conditioning. For group 1 and 2 most often FLAMSA-RIC was applied, whereas in group 3 protocols based on intravenous busulfan or melphalan combined with fl udarabine were utilized in the majority of pts. 25% of pts were grafted from a sibling donor and 75% from a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Stem cell source were peripheral blood stem cells in most cases. Eligible pts (being alive and free of leukaemia at day +120) conditioned with the FLAMSA-RIC protocol also received adjuvant donor lymphocyte infusions. After a median follow-up of more than 3y (range 0.6-11y) for surviving pts the Kaplan-Meyer procedure estimates a 38% probability of survival at 5y after transplantation for the whole cohort. When analyzing the different disease groups probability of survival at 5y was best in group 3 with 50%, followed by 47% in group 2 and 30% in group 1. Relapse occurred in 23% of group 1 pts and 7% in group 2 pts and was fatal in these 2 groups for all but 1 pt currently receiving irradiation for extramedullary relapse. In group 3 16 pts relapsed, however, 6 of these pts could be salvaged either by chemotherapy or second allotransplantation. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) for the whole cohort was 19% at day +100 and 38% during the entire observation period. NRM was highest in group 2 (46%), followed by group 1 (42%), and lowest in group 3 (27%). However, these differences were not signifi cant. No difference in survival was observed in MUD or sibling transplants. Our data support the notion that toxicityreduced conditioning followed by allo-SCT from sibling donors or MUD can be applied in elderly pts with high-risk disease and has excellent anti-leukemic effi cacy. However, more efforts are needed to further reduce NRM.",

Shem-Tov, Y. Volchek, R. Yerushalmi, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel-Hashomer, IL) Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allows SCT in elderly patients (pts), not eligible for myeloablation. However, there is still paucity of data on the expected outcome and prognostic factors in the late 7th and 8th decade of life. We retrospectively analyzed SCT outcomes in 90 pts older than 65 years given allogeneic SCT in a single institution between the years 2001 and 2011. Median age was 68 years (65-76), 24 were age >70. Diagnoses included AML (n=45), MDS (n=21), lymphatic malignancies (n=19) or others (n=5). 21, 19 and 50 pts had early, intermediate and advanced disease status at SCT. 20 pts had a comorbidity score (HCT-CI) >2. The donor was sibling (n=47), matched unrelated (n=40), mismatched related (n=2) or cord blood (n=1). The conditioning regimen was RIC (n=54) or a more intensive reduced toxicity myeloablative conditioning (RTC, n=36). 84 pts engrafted in a median of 14 days, 5 died prior to engraftment and one had primary graft failure. With a median follow-up of 15 months (2-120), 27 are alive; 63 died of relapse (n=33) or non-relapse causes (NRM, n=30). The cumulative incidence of NRM was 16%, 28% and 31% at day +100, 1 and 2 years after SCT, respectively and was not different among pts age 65-69 and pts age >70 years. The only predicting factors for NRM in multivariate analysis (MVA) were HCT-CI >2 (HR 4.0, p=0.01) and advanced disease status (HR 4.6, p=0.008). Acute GVHD occurred in 30 pts, and was associated with 13 deaths (16% of all pts, all 13 pts with Gr III-IV acute GVHD subsequently died). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 39% with advanced disease been the most signifi cant predicting factor (HR 5.0, p=0.002). The 2-year overall survival (OS) of the entire group was 37%. It was 34% and 37% for pts age 65-69 and >70 years, respectively (p=NS). 2-year OS was 57%, 37% and 28% in pts with early, intermediate and advanced disease status at SCT, respectively (p=0.006) and 40% and 23% for pts with HCT-CI >2 or 0-2, respectively (p=0.2). In MVA these were the only predictive factors with HR 3.0 (p=0.003) and 2.1 (p=0.03), respectively. The 2-year OS of the 28 pts with no comorbidities and no advanced disease was 51%. Age alone, donor or disease type were not predicting for outcome. In conclusion, allogeneic SCT is feasible in a subset of older pts in the late 7th and 8th decade of life with reasonable outcome, if they have no signifi cant comorbidities and no advanced disease status, when using RIC and RTC conditioning.",

We included recipients of HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-DRB1-identical unmanipulated grafts from related or unrelated donors. The primary endpoint was transplant-related mortality (TRM). Secondary endpoints included relapse, survival, chimerism, and toxicity. The RIC patients had faster platelet engraftment (p<0.01), required fewer erythrocyte and platelet transfusions (p<0.001), and required less total parenteral nutrition (TPN) than the MAC group (p<0.01). Cytomegalovirus reactivation was commoner in the MAC group (14/19) than in the RIC group (6/18) (p=0.02). Haemorrhagic cystitis occurred in eight of the MAC patients and in none of the RIC patients (p<0.01). Donor chimerism was similar in the two groups regarding CD19 and CD33, but was delayed for CD3 in the RIC group. Later chimerism status was similar. Incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were similar in the two groups, but two MAC patients and no RIC patients died of GVHD. Five-year TRM was around 11% in both groups, and relapse and survival were not signifi cantly different. The MAC patients with intermediate cytogenetic acute myeloid leukaemia had a three-year survival of 73%, as compared to 90% in the RIC patients. TRM was low with RIC and MAC. RIC had several advantages such as faster platelet engraftment, fewer transfusions, less TPN, fewer CMV reactivations, and less haemorrhagic cystitis.",

Kalhs, M. Mitterbauer, W. Rabitsch, A. Schulenburg, S. W\u00f6hrer, Z. Kuzmina, HT. Greinix Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, AT) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an effective treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been developed with the aim to perform safer allogeneic HCT in patient populations previously discarded because of higher HCT-related mortality. Between April 1999 and December 2009, a total of 95 consecutive patients (44 male, 51 female) with de novo AML (n=62), secondary AML (n=23) and MDS (n=10) underwent reducedintensity conditioning (RIC) followed by allogeneic HCT. RIC consisted of fl udarabine/total body irradiation of 2 Gy according to the Seattle protocol in 21 patients (22%), the FLAMSA protocol in 70 (74%) and other chemotherapy regimens in 4 patients (4%). All patients were ineligible for myeloablative HCT because of age or comorbidities. Donors were siblings in 31 (33%) patients and unrelated (URD) in 64 (67%) patients. The majority of patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (n=91, 96%). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil in the majority of patients. With a median follow-up of 37 (range, 6-137) months, 39 patients (41%) are alive. Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) rates at 5 years for the whole cohort were 40% and 57%, respectively. OS and DFS at 5 years for patients with AML was 43% and 56%, for patients with MDS 20% and 71%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 5 years was 30% and was signifi cantly higher for patients with MDS (70%) than for patients with AML (24%; p<0.01). No difference in OS and DFS projected at 5-years could be observed comparing different RIC protocols (Seattle 41% and 45% vs. FLAMSA 42% and 50%) or donor type (Sibling 43% and 38% vs. URD 41% and 60%). Patients with AML had a signifi cantly (p=0.01) better OS when transplanted in 1st or 2nd completeS417 remission (CR) than in 3rd CR or with refractory disease ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, patients with AML in 3rd CR or with refractory disease had a signifi cantly (p<0.001) higher risk for relapse than patients transplanted in 1st or 2nd CR ( Figure 2 ). RIC followed by allogeneic HCT is an effective therapy for patients with AML in 1st and 2nd remission at time of transplant. For patients with refractory disease and MDS investigation of less toxic but effi cient novel regimens are warranted. Benefi t of myeloablative HLA-matched related ASCT is limited to pts with FLT3-ITD or genotype consisting of WT NPM1 and CEBPA without FLT3-ITD (triple neg) and provided a better RFS not translating into a better OS. To investigate the role of reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT (RIC-ASCT) as post-remission therapy in adult FLT3-ITD or triple neg intermediate-risk AML pts as post-CR1 therapy, we conducted a single center retrospective analysis. Methods: pts aged 18 up to 65 diagnosed with FLT3-ITD or Triple neg de novo AML between Jan 2001 and Dec 2010 in CR1 were reviewed, excluding secondary AML, APL, AML with favorable or unfavorable karyotypes (according to D\u00f6hner, Blood 2010). Pts excluded from ASCT because of a poor performance status were excluded as were pts deceased before the median time between CR1 and ASCT. The only reason for not performing ASCT was the absence of a suitable donor. Results: 67 pts were included, 37 treated with ASCT the \"ASCT\" group and 30 treated with non-ASCT therapies, the \"no-ASCT\" group. Both groups were comparable with respect to med age at dg, WBC at dg, sex ratio, proportion of normal/abnormal karyotype, or FLT3-ITD/triple neg genotype, and nb of chemotherapy to reach CR1. Med time between CR1 and ASCT was 114 days (24-295). Conditioning were fl udarabine+busulfan+ATG, fl udarabine+cyclophosphamide+TBI2Gy, fl udarabine+TBI2Gy, fl udarabine+treosulfan+ATG (n=20/4/10/3).

As part of the quality of life assessment we also looked into the number of inpatient days in the fi rst 100 days post transplant and correlated them with patients' pretransplant characteristics. Materials and Methods: 47 patients(26 male and 21 female) above the age of 60 with lymphomas from 2 transplant centres were included in the study. The median follow up length was 26 months (range 1-96 months) and the median age 64 years (range 60-70). 17 patients had follicular lymphoma, 12 had CLL, 2 had Waldenstroms, 5 with Hodgkins, 3 diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 3 splenic marginal zone lymphoma. 31 patients received a peripheral stem cell graft from a fully matched unrelated donor and 16 from a sibling donor.26 patients were transplanted in CR and 21 in PR. 18 received conditioning with Fludarabine/Melphalan/alemtuzumab 14 patients with BEAM/alemtuzumab,9 with Fludarabine/ BEAM/alemtuzumab, 6 with Fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/ Alemtuzumab.Sorror comorbidity scoring was performed in all patients. 12 patients had a comorbidity index of 3 and above. Results: All patients engrafted. The two years OS was 56% .TRM in the 1st year was 61% for those with a Sorror comorbidity index of \u22653 but only 12% for those with a score <3. The relapse rate was 30% in 2 years. Two factors were associated with decreased OS and reduced DFS: a sorror comorbidity index of \u22653 and partial remission pre transplant. CMV status,stem cell dose and graft source were not signifi cant on OS and DFS. A Sorror modifi ed comorbidity index for HCT of 3 and above was associated with increased inpatient stay (P:0.001) Conclusion: These data demonstrate that alemtuzumab RIC allografts can be delivered safely in selected patients above the age of 60. Sorror comorbidity scoring is a simple method which can identify older patients with inferior outcomes and should form the basis for pre-transplant assessment in this patient population. Background: Rh D incompatibility between donor and recipient occurs commonly in allogeneic HSCT and some recipients may be alloimmunized to Rh D prior to transplantation. With increasing use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, the safety of antigen-incompatible transplants remains a concern. Study Design and Methods: All patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT between 2000 and 2010 at a large Canadian teaching hospital were reviewed for Rh D incompatibility. The primary endpoint was the development of Rh D antibodies. Results: A total of 419 patients underwent allogeneic transplantation between 2000 and 2010. 79 patients (19 %) were mismatched for the Rh D antigen. Of 16 patients who underwent RIC transplant, none showed evidence of anti-D alloimmunization post-transplant. None of the patients who underwent myeloablative conditioning developed new Rh D antibodies after transplant. One Rh D negative patient with evidence of anti-D before transplantation underwent myeoloablative conditioning and received an Rh D-positive donor graft. The patient experienced signifi cant hemolysis that resolved within 30 days of transplantation, despite persistence of anti-D at last follow-up, 16 months after transplantation.",

Therefore new break-through approaches should be expected in order to improve survival. We hypothesized that unmanipulated haploidentical hematopoietc stem cell transplantation (UH-SCT) could be a novel platform of immunotherapy based on powerful graft-versus-tumor effect induced by alloreactive T and NK cells. However lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure should be overcome to perform UH-SCT safely. Objectives and Methods: This study presents a series of transplant experiments aiming to evaluate the effi cacy and feasibility of UH-SCT for refractory or relapsed pediatric solid tumors. Eight cases with refractory/relapsed pediatric solid tumors were enrolled in this study from July 2007 to December 2011. One patient had a second transplantation due to tumor progression at 1 year after fi rst transplantation. Among 8 patients, there are 3 cases of relapsed neuroblastoma, 1 case of relapsed mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, 2 cases of relapsed Ewing sarcoma, 1 case of refractory alveolar soft part sarcoma with multiple lung metastases, and 1 case of refractory primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Conditioning regimens were fl udarabine+Melphalan+ra bbit-anti-thymocyte-globulin. (ATG) and GVHD prophylaxis consisted of the combination of tacrolimus, methotrexate, and predonisolone. Results: All patients achieved primary engraftment however secondary graft rejection was observed in one patient. HLA disparities were 3/8 in 2, 4/8 in 6, and 2/8 with KIR mismatched in 1. Five patients received peripheral blood stem cells and 4 patients received bone marrow stem cells. Incidence of acute GVHD was 5/8 cases (grade II-IV: 2 , II-IV: 1), chronic GVHD was observed in all 6 evaluable patients. Four cases received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) due to tumor progression. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was not observed. Five cases had tumor progression, and 3 of 5 cases died, the other 2 cases are alive with additional treatment. Three cases are alive and well for 3, 16 and 17 months after transplantation without progression. With the median follow up of 16 (3-43) months, the two-year probability of overall survival was 71.4% in this study. Conclusion: These results indicated the feasibility and the effi cacy of UH-SCT for relapsed or refractory pediatric solid tumors. (4) (1",

In that model, graft/receptors were not conditioned to generate immunity responses, and frequently, the patients were immune-suppressed. Over the past few years, our team has developed an Autologous Heterotopic Transplant Of Peripheral Blood (AHTOPB), a procedure including a strong conditioning of graft/receptors to elicit antitumoral responses. Methods: The state of art in AHTOPB confi guration is reported here for the fi rst time: 1. Week 1 to 4: Patient conditioning with drugs that switch the malignancy-induced-tumor-progressive conditioning of the systemic microenvironment (neoangiogenesis/immunetolerance). 2. Week 5 to 8: Transplant ex-vivo conditioning to generate a subcutaneous/intramuscular site where injections of specifi c antitumoral immunization do not elicit tolerogenic responses. 3. Finally, thermostable autologous plasma fraction, previously reported as a fraction containing antigens released from tumors and conserved inside thermostable stress shock proteins, was injected in the prepared immunogenic site. The evidence in independent reports for each step of this confi guration is revisited. Patients: From clinical trials performed to test AHTOPB and previously published, control and treated patients, accomplishing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were selected and the assessments statistically analyzed.

Graftversus-leukemia (GvL) induces by removal of cyclosporine (CSA) have been documented in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but these reports do not extend beyond anecdotal examples. We present a case of rapid molecular remission in conjunction with the development of chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) after abrupt interruption of CSA. Patient: A 38-year-old man and 65 Kg of body weight was admitted to our department with 90% of myeloid blasts in peripheral blood (PB) and in bone marrow (BM), 8% of basophils granulocytes in peripheral blood (PB) and splenomegaly. In fl ow cytometry the blasts expressed CD13, CD33, and CD34. He was diagnosed with myeloid blastic crisis (BC) of CML despite an absence of a clinical history of a hematologic disorder. Chromosome analysis showed t(9;22)(q34;q11) traslocation in 90% of metaphases. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis on PB sample detected a BCR-ABL-ABL ratio of 255%. The mutation BCR/ABL\u02c6351NS was evident. The patient underwent one course of idarubicin and cytosine arabinose therapy combined with imatinib 800 mg/day. At month +3 the BCR-ABL transcripts was no detectable on PB samples and positive (ratio 0.14%) on BM sample (Figure 1 ). At month +4 the patient was treated with myeloablative Busulfan/Cyclophosfamide conditioning and allogeneic BM transplantation (ABMT) from sibling donor. Imatinib was discontinued before ABMT. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred at day +11 and +17 respectively. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CSA (3 mg/ kg/twice daily i.v. from day -1 to +15 and 300 mg/daily orally from day +16) and i.v. MTX (10 mg/Kg/day on day +1 and 8 mg/Kg on day +3, +6 and +11). There was no evidence of acute GVHD. At day +32 from ABMT, the BCR-ABL transcript measured was no detectable on PB and BM samples; at day +70 from ABMT we observed molecular relapse in BM and we reduced the CSA up to a dose of 100 mg/day. At day +82 there was an increase of Ratio (0,2% in PB and 0,8% in BM) ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, the CSA was abruptly suspended. Cutaneous and mucosal manifestation of extensive cGvHD developed and the BCR-ABL transcripts measured on PB and BM samples were no detectable (days +120 from ABMT). cGVHD was treated fi rst with prednisone and then with the addition of CSA. Conclusion: Our case confi rms the existence of GVL effect in CB of CML after abrupt interruption of CSA. Background: Myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms resulting from translocation t(8;9)(p21-23;p23-24) fusing the human autoantigen pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1) gene and the janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) gene are very rare disorders.Until now 17 patients with PCM1-JAK2 fusion gene were described. Case Report: In a 22-year-old woman in 28th week of gestation idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome was diagnosed according WHO in December 2008. Pregnancy was terminated at 38th week, delivering healthy newborn. This woman was treated with INFalpha; and hydroxyurea. In March 2010,the BM was still hypercellular (90%) with proliferation of eosinophils and granulocytes. Large nodules composed of erythrobla sts,proerythroblasts and some immature cells were observed. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated erythroid nature of these cells. Moreover, increase in reticulin fi brosis was observed (grade 2). From September 2010 signifi cant anemia developed. The patient was qualifi ed for alloHSCT from the HLA-matched sibling, but because of the pregnancy of the donor, the procedure was postponed.In March 2011, before alloHSCT, karyotype revealed translocation t(8;9)(p22;p24) and chimeric PCM1-JAK2 detected by RT-PCR in BM sample. Sequencing confi rmed exon to exon in-frame fusion between PCM1 exon 36 and JAK2 exon 9 with the breakpoint at position 6281-6282 and 1710-1711, respectively. In trephine biopsy, peritrabecular nodules substituted about 50% of marrow cellularity and exhibited increased number of immature erythroid cells, expressing hemoglobin A, CD71 and p53, with proliferation fraction about 90% in Ki67 stain. Blasts markers CD34, CD117 were negative. Reticulin fi brosis was signifi cant (grade 3). Previous diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome was verifi ed to chronic eosinophlic leukemia, not otherwise specifi ed (CEL, NOS) with erythroblastic proliferation of unclear signifi cance. In May 2011, alloHSCT was S434 performed with conditioning BuFlu (busulphan i.v. 3,2 mg/kg a day, days -7 to -4 and fl udarabine 30mg/m2 a day, days -7 to -3). Prophylaxis of GvHD included CsA/MTX. On day +180, 100% donor chimerism was confi rmed in STR-PCR.Cytogenetic analysis of BM aspirate revealed normal karyotype. No GvHD was observed. Conclusions: Our report is unique as it illustrates diagnostic diffi culties within 2.5-year follow-up and presents the study of evolution of this rare disease.Such detailed case descriptions are important,as they will greatly facilitate constructing defi nition criteria in the future and help to fi nd the best therapeutic option.",

The cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment, grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and transplantation-related mortality after HSCT, were 98%, 48%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. After a median followup time of 56.8 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 29% and 53%, respectively, for all patients. Comparing OS & EFS between frontline HSCT group and HMT bridging group, the survival rates were not signifi cantly different (log-rank test p=.58 & p=.98 respectively). In conclusion, HMT followed by alloHCST was feasible and effective treatment strategy for patients with MDS who need considerable time until alloHSCT.Objectives: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of stem cell disorders characterized by bone marrow dysplasia, peripheral cytopenia, and an enhanced risk to transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In most patients, treatment options are limited to supportive care and palliative cytoreduction. However, in a group of patients, intensive therapy can be offered. The only established curative treatment approach for these patients is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Methods: In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 60 adult patients (33 males, 27 females) with MDS (n=28) or MDS transforming into secondary AML (n=33), who underwent SCT at our institution between 1988 and 2010. Twenty-eight patients had an HLAidentical related transplant donor, and 32 had an HLA-matched unrelated donor. The median age at time of SCT was 44 years (range: 18 to 68 years). According to the WHO classifi cation, 4 patients had RA, 1 RARS, 3 RCMD, 1 RCMD-RS, 6 RAEB-1, 12 RAEB-2, 1 CMML, and 32 had AML following RAEB at SCT. Conditioning consisted of chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (55/60 patients) or chemotherapy alone (5/60 patients). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of a combination of low-dose methotrexate and cyclosporine A (37/60 patients) or cyclosporine A plus mycophenolat mofetil (23/60 patients). Results: Patients were followed up with a median observation time of 16 months (range: 1-218). Currently, 34 patients (57%) are alive at. Of the 26 patients who died, post-transplantation relapse occurred in 12 patients, and14 patients died of treatment-related causes (multi-organ failure, sepsis, haemorrhage). Conclusions: In summary, a substantial number of patients with MDS achieve long term disease-free survival after SCT. In our small cohort of patients, the overall outcome and survival after SCT was independent of IPSS risk categories or the WHO classifi cation. However, we identifi ed co-morbidity -assessed by HCT-CI -as a signifi cant adverse prognostic variable in our MDS patients, confi rming previous data. Therefore, we believe that it is important to use score systems/prognostic factors to optimally predict survival in MDS patients who are considered candidates for SCT.",

Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) Indications, timing of HCT in MDS and best pre-transplant treatment, are debated. We thus investigated local practices of indications and transplant outcomes, from the referral perspective. Outcomes of MDS patients, who underwent HCT between 1994 and 2011 in our center, were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-one consecutive patients allotransplanted for MDS were enrolled, with a median age of 52 y Median interval from diagnosis to HCT was 9.5 months (1-91). Before transplantation, induction chemotherapy (IC) and azacitidine (AZA) were administered in 48% and 20% of the whole cohort and 93% and 12% of patients with sAML/RAEB-T, respectively. CR rate after IC was 48% and median response duration 11 months. After a median of 5 cycles of AZA, 50% and 33% of patients achieved partial response and hematological improvement, respectively. Percentage of marrow blasts at HCT was <10 and \u226510% in 50% of patients each. Donors were siblings for 71% of patients and the rest were alternative transplants. Myeloablative (MA, mainly BUCY) and reducedintensity conditioning (RIC, mainly FLUBUATG) were administered in 63% and 37% of patients, respectively. The 5-y overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM), were 20%, 35.6% and 38%, respectively. Prognostic factors for longer OS were % of marrow blasts <10% (33 vs. 5 months with \u226510%, P=0.01) and, as a trend, CR (24 vs. 6 months without CR, P=0.17). Monosomal and very poor KT adversely affected relapse mortality (HR 3.7, P=0.07; HR=2.6, P=0.002). No predictive factor was identifi ed for NRM among age, sex, donor and conditioning type. All but one of the survivors had undergone HCT less than two years after MDS diagnosis. In conclusion, percentage of marrow blasts was the strongest prognostic factor for overall survival after HCT, inciting to cytoreductive treatment in advanced MDS and/or early referral. Adverse outcome of patients with newly defi ned very poor karyotype urges for alternative HCT modalities. The choice of RIC vs. MA conditioning should be based on personalised decisions, mainly comorbidity.",

Passweg, J. Halter University Hospital Basel (Basel, CH) Background: Sweet's syndrome (or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) consists of the abrupt onset of red, tender, cutaneous plaques on the face, extremities, and upper trunk, accompanied by fever, malaise, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Histologically, there are distinctive, dense, dermal infi ltrates of neutrophils. Response to systemic steroids is typically dramatic. Characteristically, Sweet's syndrome occurs in the clinical setting of a disease-related myeloid malignancy or is medication triggered. Case Report: A 59-year old male patient presented with multiple red, tender, cutaneous plaques on the face, the extremities and the trunk. He had continuous fever preceded by many months of active arthritis of large joints. He required high doses of steroids to control his symptoms. Skin biopsy revealed neutrophilic infi ltration but no signs of malignancy or vasculitis. The patient developed heart failure caused by an atrio-ventricular block requiring implantation of a pacemaker. Heart biopsy revealed patchy neutrophilic infi ltrations. The general condition increasingly deteriorated with fever, malaise and peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. A diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome was made. In a search for an underlying hematologic malignancy, a bone marrow examination was performed and indicated a myeloproliferative disorder unclassifi able (MPD). A JAK2 mutation was negative and BCR-ABL could be excluded by molecular diagnostics. Cytogenetics were normal. A cytoreductive treatment with hydroxyurea was initiated with clinical slight improvement of the skin manifestations. Finally, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after fl udarabin/busulphan conditioning was performed using stem cells from a 10/10 HLA-identical unrelated donor. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of ATG, methotrexate and cyclosporine. He achieved full donor chimerism without clinically manifest GvHD. Manifestations of Sweet's syndrome and arthritis disappeared within two weeks following transplantation and remained in complete remission.",

Jebavy, A. Hellmann, D. Sibon, R. Oneto, J. Luan, P. Dreger, L. Castagna, A. Sureda on behalf of the Lymphoma Working Party of the EBMT and the GITMO.Objectives: To evaluate outcome of patients with relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and to distinguish different risk groups using identifi ed prognostic factors. Patients and Methods: We reviewed 511 adult patients registered in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) databases between 1996 and 2005. Tandem ASCT and patients receiving only palliative care after relapse were not included in the study. Results: Median time from ASCT to relapse or progression was 7 months (range, 1-78). Treatment following ASCT failure consisted on conventional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in 294 patients (64%), second ASCT in 35 (8%), and allogeneic SCT in 133 (29%). After a median follow-up of 49 months, overall survival (OS) was 32% at 5 years. OS at 4 years for patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens was 48% in comparison with 32% for those receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for OS were early relapse within the fi rst 6 moths after ASCT, stage IV, bulky disease, poor performance status, and age > 50 years at relapse. For patients with no risk factors OS at 5 years was 62% compared with 37% and 12% for those having 1, and >2 factors, respectively. This score was also predictive for outcome in each group of rescue treatment after ASCT failure. Conclusion: In the EBMT database, most HL patients with ASCT failure are treated with chemo-radiotherapy and some of them with a second transplantation. Early relapse, stage IV, bulky disease, poor performance status and age > 50 at relapse are relevant factors and could be used to guide the choice of treatment for individual patients and to understand the results of novel different therapeutic approaches.",

The only B-cell origin was associated with longer cDFS (p=0,027). NRM was signifi cantly higher in pts with Karnovsky <80% (p=0,048). Conclusions: Our analysis of mixed-types NHL cohort confi rms effi cacy of allo-HSCT in heavily pretreated/refractory patients showing promising 5 years OS and acceptable NRM rate. In this series, OS was found to be independent of NHL type and cDFS was not infl uenced by type of conditioning regimen or graft T-cell depletion. A proportion of pts relapsing after allo-HSCT can be rescued by DLIs with achievement of prolonged CR. Background: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with FL grades I-IIIA treated by allogeneic HSCT and to defi ne subgroups which benefi t most from allogeneic HSCT. Patients and Methods: In the DRST database 146 patients (male: 89; female: 57) with FL were identifi ed who underwent allogeneic HSCT between 1998 and 2007. 90/146 patients were pre-treated with autologous HSCT. Median age at allogeneic HSCT was 48 years (range 29-70). 110/146 patients were either in complete (CR, n=36) or partial (PR, n=74) remission whereas 33/146 patients had refractory disease (RD). Median time from diagnosis to allogeneic HSCT was 44 months (range 7-205). Median time interval between autologous and allogeneic HSCT was 23 months (range 1-165). The conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic HSCT was reduced intensity (RIC, 96/146; chemotherapy-only: n=55; TBI-based: n=41) and myeloablative (MA, 50/146; TBI-based: n=24; chemotherapy-only: n=26). Median donor age was 40 years (range 21-69; female: n=54; male n=92). 81% of the patients had fully HLA-matched donors either siblings (42%) or unrelated (39%). At the present state of evaluation, univariate statistical analysis was performed. Results: Engraftment was seen in 95% of the cases (median: 13 d). Incidence of acute GvHD was 74% in the MA group and 55% in the RIC group (p=0.04). Extensive chronic GvHD was more common in patients with elderly donors (p=0.016). For the entire study population, estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 52%. Of 51 evaluable patients surviving more than 5 years, only one patient relapsed (2%). Cumulative 100d TRM was 16%. Limited chronic GvHD (p=0.015) and use of donors <40 years (p=0.07) were correlated with improved OS. After allogeneic HSCT 75% (56/74) of the patients with PR and 65% (21/33) with RD achieved CR. The 5-year OS rates for patients with CR, PR and RD at the time of transplant were 64%/52%/39% (p=n.s.). Pretreatment with autologous HSCT had no impact on OS after allogeneic transplant. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT in non-transformed FL is a feasible approach with a 100 d TRM of only 16%. 52% of the patients survived for more than 5 years with a minimal risk of late relapse. Even for patients with RD a substantial number of patients survived long-term.

Autologous HSCT was associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates but high relapse rates remained a matter of concern. Presently it is unclear whether the use of allogeneic HSCT can improve clinical outcome or even cure transformed FL. Patients and Methods: In the DRST database 34 patients with transformed FL were identifi ed who underwent allogeneic HSCT between 1998 and 2007. 28/34 patients were pretreated with autologous HSCT. At time of allogeneic HSCT median age of patients was 51 years (range 28-59). 24/34 patients were either in complete (CR, n=3) or partial (PR, n=21) remission whereas 9 patients had refractory disease (RD). The conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic HSCT was reduced intensity in 25 and myeloablative in 9 of the 34 patients. All related donors (n=18) were HLA-identical siblings and of the unrelated donors (n=16) 69% were fully HLA-matched. Results: All patients showed engraftment. 52% (11/21) of the patients with PR and 44% (4/9) of the patients with RD achieved a CR after allogeneic HSCT. For the whole study population, estimated 1, 2, 5-year DFS rates were 58%/46%33% and corresponding OS rates were 61%/49%/34%. Cumulative 100 d treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 26%. Post transplant, 4 patients relapsed (including one late relapse after 2.5 years) and 6 patients showed progressive disease. Best results after allogeneic HSCT were obtained for the subgroup of patients with controlled disease (CR/PR), use of RIC and matched donors (n=16) with a TRM of 13%, 1, 2, 5-year DFS rates of 71%/63%/52% and OS rates of 76%/68%/57%. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT is a therapeutical option in patients with transformed FL. Best results were obtained for patients with controlled disease (CR/PR) prior to transplant, use of RIC and fully matched related/unrelated donors.

            "text": "Introduction: Relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains the most important cause of failure among high-risk lymphomas. In order to improve outcome, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) is used to exploit graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect; on the other hand, feasibility of AlloSCT is limited by the high risk of infections and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data on 34 high-risk NHL patients who underwent ASCT followed closely S440 by reduced-intensity AlloSCT (\"tandem auto-allo\") from January 2002 to November 2010. The tandem transplantation decision relied on the high-risk disease, needing some consolidation therapy after ASCT, and on the hypothesis of a high GVL effect when a signifi cant cytoreduction occurred after AlloSCT. The search for an allogeneic donor was started at the beginning of salvage regimen. GvHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine alone or in combination with methotrexate. Only HLA-identical sibling or 10/10-matched unrelated were allowed. Results: median patients' age at AlloSCT was 47 (27-68). Main patient's and transplant characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Peripheral stem cell was used in all patients but one. Median interval between ASCT and AlloSCT was 77 days . Successful allogeneic engraftment occurred in all patients. At a median follow-up of 46 (8-108) months since AlloSCT, 5-year overall survival (OS) is 77% (61-93) and progressionfree survival (PFS) is 68% (51-85) (Figure 1) . Disease relapse or progression occurred in six patients (cumulative incidence at 2 years=22%), 100-day treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 0%, 2-year estimate of cumulative incidence was 6%. Causes of TRM were sepsis with subsequent multiorgan failure in two patients and severe extensive chronic GvHD in one patient. Ten patients developed grade \u22652 acute GvHD and fi fteen patients chronic GvHD, with a cumulative incidence of 29% (14-44) and 45% (27-63) respectively. Conclusions: Fandem transplantation is feasible in high-risk NHL patients having a HLA-identical allogeneic stem cell donor, with 0% early TRM and 6% 2-year TRM incidence. This tandem approach could represent a suitable therapeutic option for those patients with high-risk NHL potentially benefi tting from further therapy after ASCT, that is here GVL effect, after disease debulking by salvage therapy and ASCT. Donor search should promptly be started whether such an approach is chosen.",

Conventional chemotherapy may initially lead to a complete remission, which, however, tends to be followed by relapse within less than a year. Currently the only promising approach to successful treatment appears to be allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which has been reported to improve 5 year overall survival rates to around 50%. In cases of relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation the prognosis has been considered utterly dismal. We report here on a 25-year-old patient who presented with fever, nightsweats, fatigue and hepatosplenomegaly and was diagnosed with hepatosplenic t-cell-lymphoma with 30% bone marrow infi ltration. Four blocks of chemotherapy did not manage to control the disease but after undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related donor with TBI8Gy/fl udarabine conditioning the patient achieved complete remission. However, a relapse occurred only four months later. Upon diagnosis of relapse a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was given (10x10 6 CD3+ cells/kg), followed by two courses of lenalidomide (5 mg/d) one and two months later. Three months after the DLI the patient suffered a severe bout of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) of the liver but also managed to achieve complete remission of the t-cell-lymphoma. An immuno suppressive therapy with corticosteroids, cyclosporine and mycophenolate was started, with which the GvHD of the liver was successfully controlled. Under mycophenolate and tapering doses of cyclosporine the patient is now well and free of symptoms while still remaining in complete remission, one year after transplantation.[P1125]",

            "text": "Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease when treated with standard chemotherapy. The only possibility to provide cure is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). CLL patients aged less than 55 account for about 15% of patients and these cases allo-SCT should be taken into consideration. The indications for allo-SCT are del17p, resistance to chemoimmunotherapy, Richter's syndrome or recurrent disease. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of allo-SCT in 31 patients (18 males, 13 females) with CLL transplanted in years 2000-2011 was performed. The aim of the study was to assess the long term follow-up outcome of allo-SCT in CLL patients. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 43ys (range: 35-55). The sibling donor was available in 29 cases (2 pts were mismatched), unrelated donors were in 2 cases (1 mismatched). Median lymphocytosis before allo-SCT was 1.6 G/l. Peripheral blood was the source of stem cells in 21 cases (68%), and bone marrow in the remaining 10 cases, 2 pts were transplanted with stem cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood. 4 pts (13%) underwent the allograft procedure twice or more. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was performed in 27 pts (13 of them -with alemtuzmab), myeloablative regimen in 4 cases and RIC with rituximab in one case. The median number of CD34+cellsx10 6 /kg was 4.2 (range: 0.86-9.64). Four patients suffered from graft failure. Acute graft-versus host disease (GvHD) was noted in 45% of pts (only in 3 pts grade IV). Extensive GvHD was observed in 8 pts. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was performed in 11 pts (35,5%). With a median follow-up of 42 months (range: 1,8-129) for surviving patients, the fi veyear Kaplan-Meier of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) was 48% and 34%, respectively. At fi ve years, the cumulative probability of non-relapse mortality was 16%. Conclusions: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment in CLL and should be indicated for a selected group of patients.",

We are reporting 13 patients (8 F; 5 M) with a median age of 52 years (range 41-64 yrs) affected by advanced CTCL. Diagnosis were: panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (n=1) large T-cell lymphoma (n=3), NK T-cell lymphoma (n=1), Mycosis Fungoides (MF, n=2), Sezary Syndrome (SS, n=6). Seven patients had a relapsed/refractory disease, 4 patients were in partial remission and 2 in complete remission. All patients but 1 were heavily pretreated and 3 had undergone a previous autologous transplant. Six patients were transplanted from a HLA identical sibling, 1 from a HLA mismatched sibling, 4 patients were transplanted from a matched unrelated donor and 2 from umbilical cord blood (UCB) unit. Nine patients received a RIC regimen consisted of thiotepa, fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide (n=7) and thiotepa, fl udarabine and busulfan (n=2). Four patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) consisted of cyclophosphamide and busulfan in 2 patients and thiotepa and fl udarabine and busulfan in 2. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used as GVHD prophylaxis in HLA identical transplant. UCB transplant received cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine and prednisone, respectively. Thymoglobulin was added in mismatched transplant. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were achieved in all but one patients. A grade I-II acute GVHD developed in 4 patients, grade III-IV in one. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was observed in 11 patients: 9 limited and two extended. Eleven patients were evaluable for response (2 too early) and achieved a complete remission. Five patients experienced relapse at 3, 8, 9, 10, 17 months from HSCT. Three of them infused donor lymphocyte: a second durable remission was obtained in 2 SS patients, no response was observed in patient with NK T lymphoma. Transplant-related mortality occurred in four patients (3 MAC regimen, 1 RIC regimen). They died as result of multiorgan failure (n=3) and infection plus extensive cGVHD (n=1), 2 at 3 months, 1 at 7 months, 1 at 11. To date at median follow up of 45 months (range 20-85) 9 patients are alive, 6 without evidence of lymphoma. Our results show a lower transplant-related toxicity by using RIC regimen, suggest a potential curative effect of allogeneic RIC transplant and indicate the existence of a graft versus tumor effect in CTCL.",

            "text": "Background: Autologous stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the standard of care for relapsed/refractory lymphoma. While auto-HSCT is not curative in the majority of cases, allogeneic HSCT can provide a further rescue option. Previously, we reported on our experience of allo-HSCT after conditioning with BEAM/ Fludarabine/total body irradiation (TBI) in 10 patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma, an approach that combines the cytoreductive properties of BEAM with the graft-versus-tumor effect of transplantation. After treating 50 consecutive patients with this regimen, we now provide a fi nal analysis. Patients and Methods: Between 2002 and 2011, 28 male and 22 female patients age 22 to 64 (median 49) were included. All patients had refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (13 patients), Hodgkin's lymphoma (8) or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (29). Patients had undergone a median of 5 previous treatment lines (range 1-8), including auto-HSCT in 44%. Disease status at transplant was progressive in 8 (16%), stable disease in 8, partial remission in 21 (42%) and complete remission in 13 (26%). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (58%), 10/10 matched unrelated (38%) or 9/10 matched unrelated (4%). The conditioning regimen consisted of 3x25 mg/m 2 Fludarabine administered overlapping standard BEAM chemotherapy, followed by a single dose of TBI (2Gy) on the day of transplantation. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and a short course of mycophenolate mofetil. Results: With a median follow-up of 3.4 years, 30 patients (60%) are alive. All patients achieved engraftment and full donor chimerism. The major transplant-associated toxicity was mucositis (WHO grade 4 in 62%, 3 in 30% and 2 in 8%). Acute GvHD grade 2-4 arose in 64% and chronic GvHD in 51% of patients. At three years, Kaplan-Meier estimated progression free survival was 58%, with 30% transplant-related mortality S442 and a relapse incidence of 12% (Figure) . Causes of death were GvHD (n=10), infection (n=4), cerebral haemorrhage (n=1) and relapse (n=5). Disease classifi cation, stage at transplant and type of previous treatment all had no signifi cant impact on transplant outcome. Conclusion: Allo-HSCT after BEAM/Fludarabine/TBI provides excellent disease control in patients with advanced lymphoma. High rates of GvHD and GvHD-related mortality associated with this regimen are a major concern and may warrant modifi cation of the regimen in the future. The status of unrelated cord blood transplantation (uCBT) for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) has not been determined yet. We retrospectively analyzed 31 patients who received uCBT for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-NHL from January 2005 to Jun 2011 in Toranomon Hospital. In this analysis, the patients with 2nd allogeneic transplant, PS 3-4, and active infectious diseases at transplant were excluded. Nineteen (61.3%) were male and the median age at uCBT was 51 y.o. (20-66). Eighteen patients (58.1%) were 50 y.o. or older. Concerning histological diagnosis, 25 were DLBCL-NOS, 4 were transformed lymphoma, and 2 were Burkitt lymphoma. Eleven patients (35.5%) had chemosensitive disease and disease status was CR in only one case. Twelve (38.7%) had previous history of autologous transplantation and 15 (48.4%) had received prior >3 regimens. LDH level at transplant was more than upper normal limits in 25 (80.6%) cases. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were used in all but 3 cases. All cases were transplanted with single cord blood unit.Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 12.2% and 30.6%, respectively. The median followup period of survivors was 23 months . The rates of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and disease progression at 2 years after uCBT were 29.7% and 58.1%, respectively. The number of regimens before uCBT (>3 regimens) and grade 2-4 acute GvHD were poor prognostic factors for OS. No factors were attributed to PFS. Time from diagnosis to uCBT (> 1 year) and grade 3-4 acute GvHD were risk factors for NRM, and non-TBI regimen was a risk factor for disease progression. Two-year PFS and OS were higher in chemosensitive group (PFS: CR/ PR 12.7% vs. SD/PD 6.6%, OS: CR/PR 40% vs. SD/PD 25%), but not signifi cantly different. Because long-term suivival can be expected in spite of high disease-progression rate, unrelated RIC-CBT can be a option for treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive B-NHL. We should consider another therapeutic strategies, such as timing of transplantation, choice of autologous or allogeneic, strength of conditioning regimen, and maintainance therapy after uCBT.",

Salvage treatment with Rituximab 375 mg/ mq on day 1 and Benda on day 2-3 every 28 days was planned. Benda, always preceded by adequate premedication, was administered at the dose of 120 mg/mq/day in 3/5 pts, 90 mg/ mq/day in 1/5 pts and 70 mg/mq/day in 1/5 pts. CT cycles and concomitant supportive treatments were administered in outpatient regimen. To assess treatment related toxicities weekly blood examinations and clinical monitoring were performed. Results: a median of 4 cycles of R-Benda (range 1-6) was administered. One patient progressed prior to the fi rst re-evaluation and died rapidly from HD. In 4 evaluable pts, we observed 1 case of grade IV thrombocytopenia and 3 cases of grade IV neutropenia, but no severe infectious events were reported. In 1 case the induced cytopenia required a Benda dose reduction (from 120 mg/mq/day to 90 mg/mq/day) and concomitant treatment delay. Only one case of grade II gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea) and 1 case of cutaneous rash following Benda infusion were observed. No admission was necessary. To date, 2 pts died from disease progression, and 3 are alive after a median follow up of 155 days (range 101-328); 3/3 achieved a partial response at the last TC/PET disease evaluation. Conclusions: R-Benda salvage regimen has a good tolerability profi le with manageable hematological toxicities and no severe extra-hematological complications in pts with relapsed HD after allo-SCT. A larger series of pts is needed to validate these data and assess the effi cacy of Benda in treating HD relapsed post allo-SCT. J. Engels, M. Stern, C. Bucher, J. Halter, D. Heim, J. Passweg, S. Gerull University Hospital Basel (Basel, CH) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment for refractory/relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD). Treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) has recently shown encouraging results in refractory HD. However, there is little experience with potential interactions of treatment with BV and subsequent HSCT. Methods: We report on 3 male Caucasian patients in whom treatment with BV made allogeneic HSCT possible. Patients received conditioning with BEAM combined with fl udarabine and 2Gy TBI which has been previously described. Case series: Patient 1, 26y, was diagnosed with nodular slerosing HD in 08/09 and treated with 4 lines of therapy including autologous HSCT. He received 4 cycles of BV for massively progressive lung disease achieving PR, and received an allogeneic HSCT in 06/11. Posttransplant complications included acute graftversus-host disease (aGvHD) grade III (cutaneous and intestinal), and haemorrhagic cystitis. He was discharged on day +33 and later rehospitalized for CMV oesophagitis and pneumonia, which resolved. Patient 2, 25y, was diagnosed with lymphocyte depleted HD in 03/09. He failed 7 lines of therapy before receiving 10 cycles of BV achieving a PR. After autologous HSCT he received an allogeneic HSCT in 09/11. He subsequently developed mucositis and alveolar haemorrhage, but no GvHD. He was discharged on day +23 and rehospitalized for bilateral pneumonia on day +54. He developed an EBV-associated haemophagocytic syndrome, required mechanical ventilation and died on day +69 due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patient 3, 32y, diagnosed with nodular slerosing HD in 05/09, was treated with 3 lines of therapy and autologous HSCT with early relapse, received 10 cycles of BV with a transient response and subsequent progression. In 09/11 he received an allogeneic HSCT. He developed transplant-associated microangiopathy and aGvHD grade III (cutaneous and intestinal) with pneumatosis intestinalis. 78 days after HSCT, he remains in hospital with GvHD. Conclusion: All 3 patients who received BV before allogeneic HSCT showed important toxicity and severe complications. It is unclear whether this is due to previous treatment with BV, multiple previous therapies, or both. Patients with refractory HD have a poor prognosis and chemosensitivity is usually a prerequisite for HSCT. It remains to be shown whether response to BV may benefi t previously refractory patients longterm if combined with allogeneic HSCT.",

Thus, only a minority of patients became candidate for allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), however it remains the only curative option for refractory HL. We report a retrospective analysis of 33 relapsed or refractory HL patients, median age 33 (range 18-55) years, treated with reduced intensity (n 26/33, 79%) or myeloablative (n 7/33, 21%) allo-SCT between May 2000 and December 2010. Donors were HLA identical siblings (n 13/33, 39%) or matched unrelated (n 20/33, 61%). Twenty-nine/33 (88%) patients received more than 2 lines of treatment before allo-SCT, and 8/33 (24%) patients had chemorefractory disease at the time of transplant. Thirty-one/33 (94%) patients received at least one autologous-SCT, and 23/33 (70%) were treated with radiotherapy before allo-SCT. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 12,3% at 12 months from transplant. All NRM events occurred in patients treated with reduced intensity conditioning. The cumulative incidence of any grades acute graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) was 43% at day 100, whereasS444 that of overall chronic GvHD was 52% at 400 days.

Among patients with OS longer than 46 months (n=12, 36%), 8/12 (67%) were disease-free. With the limitation of a small sample size no difference in terms of OS and EFS were detected between the conventional and reduced intensity conditionings. Allo-SCT is a feasible option in heavily pre-treated relapsed or refractory HL patients with low NRM, and can induce durable clinical remissions. Furthermore, this study suggests graft-vs-HL effect exists and gives rise to long term disease control.",

Kyrcz-Krzemien Sileasian Medical University (Katowice, PL) Hodgkin lymphoma (HD) is one of the frequently and potentially curable haematological neoplasm, most patients (pts) are curable with chemo-and radiotherapy but the rests achieve only partial remission or have relapse after treatment. In Department of Hematology and BMT Medical University of Silesia, between January and November, 2011, 10 pts with refractory or relapsed HD-CR was not reached at least after two lines of therapies (8 male, 2 female, median age 34 (19-56 years) -were undergone high dose myeloablative chemotherapy with BeEAM. Ann Arbor stage was as follow: II-3 patients, III-3 patient, IV-3 pts; 50% presented B-symptoms. The primary involved sites were: lymph nodes (n=10), bone marrow (n=1), lung (n=1). Every patients achieved a partial remission (PR) defi ned as the reduction of measurable disease by \u226550% without the appearance of any new lesions after ad least three lines of therapy (ABVD, BEACOPP, ESHAP, radiotherapy). Then pts were qualifi ed to autologous hematopietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) using conditioning: Bendamustine 160 mg/m 2 iv in -8-7d, Etoposide 200 mg/m 2 iv in-6-3 d, AraC 600 mg/m 2 iv in -6-3d, Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 iv in -2d. Mobilization and transplantations procedures were performed during hospitalization.Nowadays around 80% of patients with Morbus Hodgkin can be cured and the prognosis for this subset of patients has substantially improved. This goal was achieved with introduction of effective combination of chemotherapy regimens, progress in radiation techniques, and constant optimization of treatment methods. Although, Hodgkin lymphoma is considered a curable disease in approximately 75% of the cases, approximately 50% of patients relapsing after the fi rst-line chemotherapy can be rescued by an autologous stem cell transplantation, whereas the others, which account for approximately 10-15% of the overall population, have a very poor prognosis. Randomized trials support the use of high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplanatation in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, having shown that this management improved disease-free survival. We retrospectively analyzed effi cacy and prognostic factors in 29 patients (20M/9F) with chemosensitive/chemoresistant relapse or refractory disease who underwent high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation from 2000-2010 in our institution. All patients were initially treated with ABVD regiment as fi rstline treatment. DHAP regimen was used as salvage protocol for relapsed/refractory patients. Patients have been harvested during salvage regiment. BEAM was the main conditioning regiment. There was no treatment related deaths. The fi ve years overall survival rate was 53%. The presence of active disease at transplant, and two or more lines of therapy before transplantation were adverse prognostic factors for outcome. Signifi cant prognostic factor that infl uence the overall survival is disease status before transplant. Overall survival was signifi cantly better in patients with in fi rst relapse (67%) than in patients with primary refractory -induction failure and advanced disease (25%). High-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation seems to be highly effective and safe procedure in patient with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. There is still room for improvement in the subset of patients relapsing after autologous transplant or patients with chemoresistant disease.",

B symptoms were present in four patients. Four of the patients had International Prognostic Score \u2265 3 at diagnosis. The analysis included nine relapsed HL and one primary refractory case.

All the four patients in CR before ASCT continued to be in CR and four of six patients who were in PR achieved CR after ASCT. Three year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ASCT were 50% and 76% with a median follow-up duration of 41.2 months. CR at time of ASCT seemed to be associated with better PFS despite lack of statistical signifi cance due to small sample size (HR 0.223, 95% confi dence interval 0.024-2.050, p=0.185). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the effi cacy of high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT in Korean patients with refractory or relapsed HL may be comparable with previous reports from mainly Caucasian patients.",

Garc\u00eda-Talavera Hospital Universitario Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Candelaria (Santa Cruz de Tenerife, ES) Introduction: The prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) primarily refractory or who relapse worsens considerably. Treatment usually includes high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Auto-HSCT) rescue with good results. We present our experience in HL and Auto-HSCT. Objectives: To analyze retrospectively the response to auto-HSCT in patients with HL The variables included are: pre auto-HSCT state, response to auto-HSCT, overall survival and median survival, treatment-related mortality and cause of mortality. Materials and Methods: During the period from May 98 to November 2011, 25 patients diagnosed of HL underwent auto-HSCT. One patient received a double auto-HSCT. The treatment at diagnosis was ABVD (n=18), COPPABV (n=3) and MOPPABV (n=2). Patients elegible for Auto-HSCT were: a) primary refractory patients (didn't reach complete response (CR) after initial treatment, progress during treatment, duration of CR <2 months) (n=10) and b) patients with late relapse (n=15). The conditioning treatment used was BEAC (n=20), BEAM (n=3), ICE (n=1) and CBV (n=1). In 2 cases the response was consolidated with radiotherapy. Post auto-HSCT reevaluations were performed by image studies on day + 100, then every 3 months and after 2 years every 4 months. Results: The response to auto-HSCT on day + 100 was: CR (n=18), RP (n=4), progression or stable disease (n=3). The median survival was 47.1 months from auto-HSCT with an overall survival of 64%. The transplant related mortality (before day + 100) was n=1 (4%) for pulmonary toxicity. The cause of death of the other 8 patients were due to progression (n=3), malignancies (n=3) and cardiovascular complications (n=2). Of the survivors, 1 developed high-risk MDS, and one rectal cancer. Conclusions: 1. -Auto-HSCT rescue therapy is effective in our environment with a low procedure-related mortality. 2. -In our short series, there seems to be no difference in overall survival between refractory transplant patients and those with late relapse.

Arpaci Gulhane Military Medical Academy (Gulhane, TR) Background: Approximately 15 to 30% of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) do not have a long-term remission with conventional therapy. Autologous peripheral blood stem-cell S446 transplantation (APBSCT) represents a potentially curative treatment for some patients with recurrent or progressive HL after failure of initial combination chemotherapy. Unfortunately, APBSCT is only effective in approximately 50% of such patients. Brentuximab vedotin comprises an anti-CD30 antibody conjugated by a plasma-stable linker to the potent antimicrotubule agent, monomethyl auristatin. Brentuximab vedotin selectively induces apoptotic death of CD30+ cells. Methods: We evaluated the effi cacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in patients (pts) with relapsed HL after APBSCT. Pts received brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg q3 weeks (wks) as a 30 minute outpatient IV infusion for up to 10 cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) and toxicity. Results: Five pts were enrolled; four pts were male and median age was 25 yrs (range, 18-28 yrs). Pts had received a median of 4 (range 3-5) prior cancer-related systemic therapies excluding APBSCT. Eighty percent of pts had primary refractory disease and 80% had not responded to their most recent prior therapy. Tumor regression occurred in 80% of patients and the overall objective response rate was 40% (n=2), with partial remissions (PRs) in 2 pts. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were alopecia, abdominal pain, fatigue, insomnia and diarrhea. AEs \u2265 grade 3 occurred in \u2265 60% of pts were fatigue, insomnia artralgia and diarrhea. Conclusions: With manageable AEs, single-agent brentuximab vedotin induced objective responses in 40% of pts with relapsed HL after APBSCT. In this heavily pretreated population, 2 of 5 pts (40%) achieved PR and tumor regression and clinical improvement occurred in 80% of patients.",

Osmani, M. Brahimi, S. Talhi, S. Bekadja, S. Belkhodja University (Oran, DZ) Objectives: The effi cacy of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has been reported, but an optimal conditioning regimen has not been determined. Several chemotherapy preparative regimens are used, however, there has not been a randomized clinical trial to support the superiority of one regimen over another. We report treatment results achieved for refractory or relapsed HL in adult patients with a new conditioning regimen. Patients and Methods: From March to September 2011, all patients with HL were treated with high-dose Etoposide (800 mg/m\u00b2), Aracytine (8 g/m\u00b2) and Melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2) followed by reinfusion of peripheral ASCT (EAM). Results: A total of 14 patients were retrospectively evaluated. The median age was 27 years (range; 17-47), median number of CD34+ cells was 3,86x10 6 /l (2, 15) . All patients had a full haematopoietic reconstitution. Median time to achieve neutrophils >500/\u03bcl was 13 days (range;10-19) and median time to achieve an unsupported platelet count >20000/\u03bcl was16 days (range; 14-25).Toxicities included grade 4 hematologic in 14/14 patients, grade 3 mucositis in 4, grade 3 infectious in 2. No case of transplant-related mortality occurred. After a median follow up of 6 months, all patients are alive and all are in continuous CR.In conclusion, the EAM regimen would be an effective and tolerable conditioning regimen with acceptable engraftment and toxicity for ASCT for refractory or relapsed HL. Although these outcomes are encouraging, longer followup is required and comparison with other traditional ASCT regimens used for patients with refractory or relapsed HL is warranted.",

Pytlik, M. Trnkova, M. Trneny Charles University General Hospital (Prague, CZ) Background: Salvage chemotherapy (CHT) followed by highdose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Rituximab (R) improves outcome of salvage CHT in R naive pts. However, the impact of R-salvage CHT in pts who have failed after R-containing induction remains questionable. Aims: We retrospectively analysed the impact of addition of rituximab to CHT followed by HDT and ASCT and the role of PET in staging of DLBCL. Methods: There were 219 pts with DLBCL who underwent ASCT at our institution between 1994-2010. The median age at the time of ASCT was 45 years (18-70). Median follow-up was 4.9 y (0.1 -9.6) in R-CHT group (152 pts) and 13.2 y (0. 1-17.3) in CHT group (67pts). 81 pts underwent HDT with ASCT as a part of intensive induction therapy, 60 pts as a consolidation after standard induction treatment and 78 pts for relapse or progression (R/P). There were 3 groups of pts in R/P cohort: 22 pts received R in induction as well as in salvage therapy, 24 pts were treated with R only in salvage therapy and 35 pts never received R. Results: At 5 years from the date of ASCT, the estimated overall survival (OS) was 79% in R-CHT group vs 57% in CHT group (p=0.001) and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 72% vs 51% (p=0.001). A signifi cant difference in OS and PFS was observed in favor of R-CHT group in pts who underwent HDT with ASCT as a part of induction therapy or consolidation: OS 83% vs 64%, (p=0.02), PFS 77% vs 58%, (p=0.03) in 5y. In R/P cohort, pts who received R-CHT as a salvage treatment without prior exposure to R had signifi cantly better outcome compared to R-naive pts: OS 79% vs 48% (p=0,03), PFS 70% vs 41% at 5y (p=0,03). There was no signifi cant difference compared to pts who were treated with R in induction as well as in R/P: OS and PFS were 56%, resp. 47% (p=0,09, resp. p=0,12) for this group of pts. Pts with negative pretransplant PET had signifi cantly better outcome compared to PET positive pts: OS 84% vs 58% (p=0,001), PFS 75% vs 58% (p=0,02) in 5y. Positive predictive value (PPV) of pretransplant PET was 44%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 81%. After ASCT, PPV of PET was 66%, NPV 88%. Conclusion: R signifi cantly improved OS and PFS in pts transplanted in induction treatment as well as in pts who have failed after induction therapy without R. Pts who have failed after R-containing induction had a comparable benefi t from ASCT as pts who were R-naive. NPV of PET is high prior as well as after ASCT, PPV of PET increased after ASCT.",

Bramanti, L. Giordano, A. Chiti, E. Mauro, S. Gandolfi , B. Sarina, E. Todisco, M. Balzarotti, C. Carlo Stella, A. Santoro Istituto Clinico Humanitas (Rozzano, IT) Background: High dose chemotherapy (HDC) with peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) is the treatment of choice for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) relapsed/progressed after fi rst line chemotherapy (CT). This treatment is applied also for patients with high risk IPI as frontline therapy It is usual to consider eligible, for this kind of treatment, patients reaching complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) after CT. In many P1143 High-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell support in FDG PET-refractory lymphoma patients is effective and safe therapy as bridge to second transplant L. Castagna, S. Bramanti, L. Giordano, E. Mauro, S. Gandolfi , B. Sarina, E. Todisco, M. Balzarotti, A. Anastasia, M. Magagnoli, A. Santoro Istituto Clinico Humanitas (Rozzano, IT) Background: Disease status before high dose chemotherapy (HDC) is the strongest factor predicting the outcome of lymphoma patients (LP). Patients obtaining a complete (CR)or partial remission (PR) after salvage chemotherapy (CT) are considered chemosensitive and are allocated to HDC with survival estimated to be almost 50%. FDG PET is now the standard to evaluate disease response, and the prognosis of LP with PR seems to be worse than those in CR. The treatment of LP not reaching CR after a fi rst salvage CT with conventional salvage regimens does not seem effective. We previously published the effi cacy of HD melphalan (PAM) in 42 patients with active disease, without FDG PET evaluation. In this analysis were included only the patients with active disease after salvage CT, evaluated by FDG PET. These patients were all candidates to tandem auto-auto or auto-allo program, based on donor availability. The aims were to establish the activity of HD PAM in the FDG PET-era and to defi ne the probability to proceed towards the therapeutic program. Patients and Methods: From 2002, 44 LP with active disease, defi ned as less than PET-defi ned CR after the last salvage CT, were analysed. Main patient characteristics are reported in the table. Forty patients were evaluable because disease response was evaluated by FDG PET. Results were reported as intention to treat (ITT) and per treatment. Results: The median time between HD PAM and FGD PET evaluation was 31 days (range 14-54). The overall response rate (ORR) was 70% and 77%, in ITT and per treatment analysis. In ITT, CR and PR rate were 38% and 31%, respectively. ORR to HD PAM was analysed based on the disease status before CT (PR vs SD/PD), and not signifi cative difference was observed (ORR PR-group 80% vs ORR SD/PD group 73%). The established therapeutic program was maintained in 70% of patients scheduled for an auto-auto and 73% for those scheduled for auto-allo. The median time to absolute neutrophil count above 0.5/mm 3 was 11 days (range 9-17). Infectious complications were mild and one patient developed non severe neutropenic enterocolitis. The incidence of severe (G3-4) oral mucositis was 50%. No toxic deaths were observed after HD PAM. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed that: 1) HD PAM is effective in LP with FDG PET active disease, and the ORR seems higher than reported in the literature using conventional salvage CT (almost 30%); 2) in two third of patients, HD PAM is an effective bridge to second transplant. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered the standard salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin (HD) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 18F-fl uoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was largely used to explore the predictive value in early evaluation of treatment and at the end of therapy. We want to evaluate the role of FDG-PET performed before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Between January 2005 and August 2010 in our centre were performed 122 autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin (HD) and non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Eighty one out 122 transplanted patients are retrospectively evaluable to have performed an FDG-PET before ASCT. The median age was 42 years (range 19-67 years); patients received autografts for NHL (44 pts) and HD (37 pts). At time of transplant 48 pts (59%) were in complete remission (CR), 5 pts (6%) in partial remission (PR) and 28 pts (35%) with refractory disease. The FDG-PET before ASCT was negative in 48 pts Introduction: The role of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the treatment of T-cell lymphoma (TCL) either as consolidation after induction chemotherapy or as a salvage treatment is still a rather controversial issue, albeit the approach is advocated by a party of investigators. We aimed to evaluate the role of ASCT as a salvage treatment for relapsed T or NK-cell lymphoma compared with conventional salvage chemotherapy. Methods: We made a retrospective comparison in a single center cohort of relapsed TCL who underwent ASCT (n=30) or conventional chemotherapy (n=18) between January 1998 and March 2011. Results: Twenty four patients had peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specifi ed (PTCL-NOS), 14 extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, 5 anaplastic large cell lymphoma and 5 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Patient characteristics including international prognostic index, histology, Ann-Arbor stage and serum lactate dehydrogenase did not signifi cantly differ between the treatment arms except age (median, 45 [range, 26-70] in ASCT arm vs. 61 [range, 20-78] in conventional chemotherapy arm, p=0.001). The complete response (CR) rate seemed to be comparable between two treatment (44.4% in ASCT arm and 50.0% in conventional chemotherapy arm, p=0.77). The median progression free survival (PFS) in those undergoing ASCT and salvage chemotherapy were 9.7 months and 4.4 months, respectively (p=0.50). The median overall survival in each group of patients were 17.7 months and 7.5 months (p=0.59). When we made a comparison on only those with chemo sensitive relapse, median PFS and OS for ASCT and conventional chemotherapy group also did not signifi cantly differ (median PFS, 9.7 months and 15.2 months, p=0.29; median OS, 17.7 months and 21.8 months, p=0.28) . Conclusion: There seems to be no signifi cant difference in clinical outcomes including CR rate, median PFS and OS between ASCT and conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed TCL in this cohort. Considering dismal prognosis in these patients as well as toxicity associated with high dose chemotherapy, our data do not support the role of ASCT in the treatment of relapsed TCL. Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and they have shown the shorter survival compared with B cell lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) for PTCLs has a potential meaning of consolidating remission for PTCLs. However, the effectiveness of ASCT on distinct conditioning regimens, the optimal transplant timing in the frontline or relapsed are still unclear. We investigated the clinical outcomes of HDT/ASCT as frontline intensifi cation in 46 patients with newly diagnosed PTCLs except ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients underwent ASCT with a uniform conditioning regimen (busulfex, cyclophosphamide and etoposide). The median age was 47 years (17-65). The histological subtypes were 47.9% PTCL-There is no unique treatment for all patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Different subgroup of patients with DLBCL needs different treatment. In the pre-rutuximab era International Prognostic Index (IPI) was considered to be the most important prognostic factor for survival and the strongest indicator for identifi cation of high-risk patients, who are unlikely to be cured with standard chemotherapy. Having in mind that IPI is based on 5 clinical characteristics (age, performance status, stage, extranodal involvement, LDH level) and it is constructed in the pre-rituximab is clear that R-IPI should be tested in rituximab era to provide any information of its validity. We retrospectively analyzed unselected population of 80 patients with confi rmed diagnose of diffuse large B cell lymphoma treated at University hematology department in the period of 2005-2010. All patients were uniformly treated with R-CHOP regiment as initial treatment with curative intent. There were 80 patients with mean age 54, 5 years (15-84), male 35 and female 45. Older than 60 years were 29 patients (36, 25%) . More than half of the patients (42) were diagnosed in advanced stage of the disease. We analyzed fi ve prognostic factors: age, performance status, stage, extranodal involvement, LDH level and through the multifactorial analyses we selected two groups of patients. One with 0 to 2 factors as patients with low risk. Patients with more than 3 factors are considered as high risk. There is statistically signifi cant difference in overall survival between two groups with fi ve years overall survival 70% for low risk patients and 47% for high risk. High-risk patients may be candidates for autologous transplantation as initial treatment, having in mind that in the rituximab era relapses occur very early in the fi rst year and are diffi cult to be treated. R-IPI score is signifi cant predictor and should be used for risk stratifi cation of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. However, these fi ndings should be validated prospectively in an independent population of patients.",

Komarnicki Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Poznan, PL) The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of CD34+ cells dose given in a graft and the number of aphereses required for harvesting adequate number of CD34+ cells on hematopoietic recovery and survival of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma treated with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHCT). We evaluated a total of 124 patients, median age 34 (19-60) years, with refractory and relapsed lymphoma who underwent haematopoietic stem cell mobilization using chemotherapy and G-CSF and fi rst autoHCT between 2006-2010 in our department. The patients S450 were treated with the median 2 (range 1-6) chemotherapy lines prior to stem cell mobilization. Harvesting \u2265 3x10 6 CD34+ cells/ kg required 1-3 or > 3 aphereses in 92/124 (74%) and 32/124 (26%) patients, respectively. The impact of increased number of aphereses (>3 vs 1-3) on platelet recovery was found (p 0.008), whereas the number of transplanted CD34+ did not infl uence platelet recovery. The 3-year OS for all patients was 79% estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. In univariate analysis, prognostic factors associated with OS were the number of prior chemotherapy lines (1-2 vs >2: 91% vs 59%, p 0.002), the number of infused CD34+ cells (>4 vs 3-4x10 6 /kg: 85% vs 59%, p 0.039) and the number of aphereses required for harvesting CD34+ cells (1-3 vs >3: 86% vs 61%, p 0.016). In multivariate analysis, only the number of prior chemotherapy lines remained statistically signifi cant (HR 6.5, p 0.005) for OS. We conclude that platelets recovery after autoHCT depends on the number of aphereses required to obtain the adequate number of CD34+ cells in patients with lymphoma. We found an association between the number of aphereses, as well as CD34+ cells dose in a graft and survival of lymphoma patients after autoHCT, but only the number of chemotherapy lines prior to autoHCT is the independent prognostic factor for survival. (1) (1)University Hospital (D\u00fcsseldorf, DE) ; (2)Hospital L\u00fcdenscheid (L\u00fcenscheid, DE) Introduction: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents about 6% of all non-Hodgkin\u203as lymphoma (NHL) cases and is associated with a disappointing long term prognosis. Median overall survival (OS) ranges between 3 to 6 years. Although high response rates can be achieved with fi rstline immuno-chemotherapy, remissions are of relatively short duration. Thus, intensive treatment regimens including high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been explored in the past. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcome of patients with MCL who had undergone HSCT at the Heinrich-Heine-University of Duesseldorf. Between 1993 and 2011, 31 patients (6 female, 25 male) received an autologous transplant for MCL. All patients except of one presented with advanced disease (stage III and IV) at diagnosis. The median age at time of transplantation was 56 years (range, 34-75). 18 patients received an autologous transplant in fi rst remission, whereas 13 patients underwent HSCT as second line salvage therapy. Results: Median follow up of surviving patients is 1023 days (range 175-2845). Sixteen patients (52%) are alive. There was no TRM. Sixteen patients (52%) have relapsed at a median time of 406 days after autografting (range, 54-1673) . Of these 13 (81%) have died either of lymphoma (10) or infection (3) after allogeneic transplantation. Two more patients died in CR of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. The 2 year and 5 year PFS were 68% and 35% and the 2 year and 5 year OS were 83% and 69%, respectively. Univariate analysis of pre-transplantation variables revealed a signifi cantly inferior outcome for patients relapsing within 6 months following fi rst-line chemotherapy (OS p<0.0001 and PFS p<0.0001). Of note, patients achieving a pre-transplant second remsission after late (>6mo) relapse had the same OS after HSCT as patients in fi rst remission. Conclusion: Autologous transplantation is an effective fi rst line treatment option for patients with MCL. Patients with early relapse after initial chemotherapy should be treated with innovative treatment approaches including allogeneic transplantation and/or novel agents.",

Papanicolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) During the last two years, given the carmustine unavailability, in our centre we have used the combination of Busilvex 3.2 mg/kg/day for 3 days, Etoposide 400 mg/m 2 /day for 2 days and Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 (BuEM) since 2009. Sixty-seven patients (pts) have already been enrolled, 40 males, 27 females, aged Deltam 33 (15-65) years, diagnosed with Hodgkin's (HL) (41) and non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (26), after Deltam 3 (2-9) lines of treatment. Disease status at AHCT was complete remission (CR) 17, primary refractory (PrimRef) 37 (chemosensitive 14/37) and relapse (Rel) 13 (chemosensitive 5/13). To date 59 pts have been evaluated for at least +3 months' (m) disease response [Deltam follow up 12 (1.4-31.6 )m]. Engraftment time was 10 (8-31) for neutrophils and 11 (6-150) days for platelets in 56/59 pts. In terms of engraftment, we have observed 1 graft failure followed by allogeneic double cord blood transplant, 1 late engraftment rescued by a second infusion of autologous cells and 1 haemophagocytic syndrome post 2nd AHCT for refractory relapsed HL. Toxicity was acceptable with bacteraemias grade II (WHO), no serious pulmonary infections and moderate, resolved liver venoocclussive disease in 1 pt. According to response assessment at +3m in CR were 32/59 (54%), stable disease 9, partial remission (PR) 3 and progression 13 pts which subsequently reached to 21/59(35.6%). At last follow up, 50(84.7%) pts are alive and 32 in CR. No death was attributed to treatment related toxicity. For the whole cohort of pts the estimated progression free survival (PFS) is 65.9% at 2 years and for those in +3m CR 96% (vs 30.9% for not CR, p<0.0001) at 2 years. Chemosensitive disease (PFS: 93.5% vs 36.7%, p<0.001) and pre-transplant disease status (PFS: CR 100%, PrimRef 54%, Rel 54.5%, p=0.03) were signifi cant favorable factors. PFS was signifi cantly higher in HL rather in NHL (74.8% vs 51.4%, p=0.017) and notably in chemoresistant HL pts (HL: 55.6% vs NHL: 9.1%, p=0.0005). The achievement of +3m CR was signifi cant factor for higher PFS in both chemosensitive (100% vs 68.6%, p=0.02) and resistant disease (85.7% vs 20%, p=0.0017). These preliminary results are encouraging, offering high PFS and a signifi cant rescue probability in chemo resistant pts. Toxicity was acceptable so far, but long term adverse events are not still accessible.",

Shin (1) Objectives: Optimal conditioning regimen prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has yet to be determined in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We investigated the outcomes of patients underwent ASCT with several conditioning regimens. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with advanced disease in fi rst remission, or relapsed/refractory patients who received ASCT at 5 hospitals in Korea was performed. Total 68 patients were analyzed. The median age was 49 years (range, 15-71). Histology was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 31 (46%) patients, peripheral T cell lymphoma in 14 (21%), mantle cell lymphoma in 7 (10%), follicular lymphoma in 3 (4%), and others in 13 (19%) patients. BEAM/BEAC, BuCyEto (busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide), FluTBI (fl udarabine plus total body irradiation), or BuMelEto (busulfan, melphalan, and etoposide) conditioning regimens were used for ASCT in these patients. Results: Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 52.3% and 65.3%, respectively. Patients who received BuCyEto and BuMelEto regimens (3yr-OS rates, 73.5% and 75.0%, respectively) had better OS compared to those with BEAM/BEAC regimen (3yr-OS rate, 33.8%) (P=0.038). Younger age, stage I-II disease, high risk in fi rst remission or second remission after fi rst relapse, achievement of complete remission after ASCT, and no occurrence of veno-occlussive disease (VOD) showed better outcomes in terms of EFS and OS after ASCT. Response status before ASCT did not have any impact on survival after ASCT. Bone marrow (BM) involvement did not have an impact on EFS or OS, which means ASCT after achievement of CR with front-line chemotherapy might have survival advantages in patients with BM involvement. Patients with advanced DLBCL who underwent ASCT in fi rst remission (3yr EFS and OS, 66.7% and 77.8%, respectively) had better survival than those underwent ASCT in second or third remission after relapse (3yr EFS and OS, 36.9% and 50.5%, respectively). It suggested that up-front ASCT in fi rst remission might have survival benefi t in DLBCL patients with advanced disease. VOD was occurred in 4 patients and all of them received BuCyEto chemotherapy as conditioning regimen (4/46 patients, 8 .7%).Conclusion: BuCyEto and BuMelEto are effective conditioning regimens before ASCT in lymphoma patients. It is prefer to undergo up-front ASCT in DLBCL patients with advanced disease who achieved remission with fi rst-line chemotherapy.",

Ganguly, A. Kasi Loknath, C. Williams, C. Divine, O. Aljitawi, S. Abhyankar, J. McGuirk University of Kansas Medical Center (Westwood, US) High-dose chemotherapy with carmustine, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and melphalan (BEAM) or cyclophosphamide (BEAC) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered as a standard therapy for many patients with high-risk/relapsed non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). Whether addition of rituximab to the preparative regimens (R-BEAM or R-BEAC) improves outcome in patients previously exposed to rituximab, is not clear. We retrospectively evaluated our center's experience of ASCT between January 2007-December 2009 and attempted to compare effi cacy, outcome, and toxicity of BEAM with or without rituximab (\u00b1 R) (n=34) and BEAC with or without rituximab (\u00b1 R) (n=19) in patients with high-risk/relapsed NHL. Out of 53 patients (median age 58 y; range 25-72 y), 44 patients received preparative regimen with rituximab (R-BEAM n=29; R-BEAC n=15) and 9 patients without rituximab (BEAM n=5; BEAC n=4). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the entire cohort (n=53) at 2-years were 88% and 67% respectively. The probability of OS of BEAM/BEAC group (85%) versus R-BEAM/R-BEAC group (89%) and DFS of BEAM/BEAC group (67%) and R-BEAM/R-BEAC group (71%) were similar at 2 years (p=0.11 and 0.19 respectively). The probability of OS of BEAM group (\u00b1 R) (90%) and BEAC group (\u00b1 R) (89%) and DFS of BEAM group (\u00b1 R) (63%) and BEAC group (\u00b1 R) (60%) were also similar at 2 years (p=0.86 and 0.78 respectively). No statistically signifi cant difference was noted in engraftment kinetics, grade III-IV toxicities, and average lengths of stay among different groups. We observed signifi cantly increased charge and cost with BEAM (\u00b1 R) compared to BEAC (\u00b1 R) (median charge: BEAM $71,000; R-BEAM $75,000; BEAC $44,000; and R-BEAC $63,000) which was attributed to the higher inpatient charges for high-dose melphalan.In conclusion, addition of rituximab to the preparative regimens did not add any benefi t to our patients undergoing ASCT for B-cell NHL. It is possible that universal use of rituximab with prior therapies might have abrogated the benefi t of R-BEAM/ R-BEAC over BEAM/BEAC. In the era of managed care and increasing cost scrutiny, BEAC may have an advantage especially when the outcomes and safety of the regimens were comparable. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in a larger cohort with longer follow-up.",

Patients and Methods: We investigated 45 (25F/20M) patients -aged 30.9 (20-46) years -with relapsed or refractory HL who were initially treated with ABVD therapy during the period 2005-2010. In the course of relapse or refractory disease, all patients received DHAP as salvage, and BEAM as conditioning regimen due to autologous SCT. Results: There were 13 patients in II CS defi ned as early unfavorable group, while 32 patients had advanced disease in III and IV CS. Treatment outcome on the initial therapy was: CR in 19 (42.2%), PR in 3 (6.7%), SD in 11 (24.4%), and PD in 12 (26.7%) of patients. Among clinical characteristics bulky mediastinal mass was present in 60%, lymphadenopathy in 88.8%, splenomegaly in 13.3%, hepatomegaly in 8.9%, and lung infi ltration in 35.6% of patients. Laboratory parameters demonstrated anemia in 55.6%, lekocytosis in 42.2%, as well as lymphopenia and trombocytosis in 71.1% patients. Low albumins were present in 71.1%, and elevated ESR, CRP and beta2microglobulin in more than 90% of patients. Median duration of mobilzation (G-CSF 10 \u03bcg/kgbm) was 6 days, CD34+ cuont was 8.97 range 2-29 (x10E6/kgbm), median CD34+ cell viability was 78.6%. Median duration of period for WBC engrftment was 13.9 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) days, and for PLT was 13.1 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) days. Survival after auto SCT was 31 (1-45) months, and overall survival (OS) was 86 (12-144) months. Overall response rate at d+100 was 68.8%, with 48% of CR. Also, bulky mediastinal mass, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, trombocytosis, and anemia had negative impact on OS. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis the most predictive prognostic factor for OS was treatment outcome at day +100. Summary/Conclusion: High-dose therapy and autologous SCT are adequate therapeutic options for poor prognosis refractory/ relapsed patients with HL, and posttransplant CR could be the most predictive factor for long term survival.",

George (1) Objectives: To analyse the impact of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) international prognostic index (MIPI) and absolute lymphocyte count on day +15 (ALC15) post autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) on patient outcome after Rituximab+HyperCVAD followed by ASCT with Busulphan (Bu)+Melphalan (Mel) conditioning as initial therapy in patients with MCL. Background: Improved complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS) rates have been reported in MCL patients treated with R-HyperCVAD regimen (JCO 2005) . ASCT provides a further incremental improvement (Ann Hematol 2006). MIPI predicts outcome in non-ASCT treatment of MCL, but is not associated with outcome in patients treated with R-HyperCVAD (Blood 2008). ALC recovery after ASCT predicts OS in MCL patients treated with CHOP/CHOP-like regimens (BMT 2006), but has not been assessed in those treated with R-HyperCVAD and ASCT. Method: We retrospectively analysed the outcome of 28 patients with MCL enrolled in our treatment protocol of R-HyperCVAD followed by BuMel ASCT. One patient in CR post R-HyperCVAD refused ASCT. MIPI was calculated pretreatment. ALC15 was obtained from serial blood counts after ASCT. Results: CR was achieved after R-HyperCVAD in 92.6%. 100% of pts were in CR after ASCT. At a median follow up of 53 months, estimated EFS (Event Free Survival) was 68 % and OS was 92.7%. EFS and OS rates at 53months in patients with ALC15 >0.5x10 9 /L (n=17) were 94% and 100% compared to 34% and 80% in those with ALC15 <0.5x10 9 /L (p=.02 and .005 respectively). These rates in patients with low MIPI (n=21) were 81% and 95% compared to 34% and 85% in those with intermediate/high MIPI (p=.03 and .004 respectively). TRM occurred in one patient by day 100. There have been no therapy-related MDS/AML. Conclusion: R-HyperCVAD followed by ASCT with BuMel conditioning achieves high CR rates and durable remissions in patients with MCL, in particular those with low MIPI and early ALC recovery. Patients with high MIPI or poor ALC recovery justify consideration of post-ASCT maintenance therapy.",

Haghshenas Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, IR) Hematologic malignancy currently represents the main indication for HSCT. Clearly, autologous and allogeneic HSCT are established therapies in many of hematologic malignancies. High dose therapy (HDT) supported by autologous HSCT are the preferred choice for lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Between Jan 2004 and Nov 2010, 117 patients with diagnosis of lymphoma including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in our center in Shiraz University of medical sciences. Patients were treated by intensive chemo therapy followed by reinfusion of non-cryopreserved auto logous stem cells. The pretransplant conditioning chemotherapy regimen was CEAM (lomustin 200 mg/m 2 , etoposide 1000 mg/m 2 , cytarabine 1000 mg/m 2 and melphalan 140 mg/m 2 ) for Lymphoma. During this time, 59 HD patients with median age 27 years (range; 16-50), 58 NHL patients with median age 29 years (range; 18-55) underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The median time to platelet count >20\u00d710 9 /L was 14 days (range; 9-31).The median time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >0.5\u00d710 9 /L was 11 days (range; 8-21). All patients have engrafted and there were not graft failure in this study group. 100 days transplant related mortality rate was 3.4% in HD and 5.2% in NHL group respectively. Our data refl ects the important role of HDT followed by HSCT in improvement of outcome for a lymphoma patients of in our center. We concluded high dose therapy with this modifi ed conditioning regimen rescued with non-cryopreserved auto SCT is safe and effective method that is feasible in our lymphoma patients.",

Garc\u00eda-Ruiz Hospital Cruces (Baracaldo. Vizcaya, ES) Background: Indolent lymphoma (IL) is a heterogeneous diseases group whose treatment is not really well established. The principal aim of therapy is to prolong overall survival (OS) with the best quality of life. Rituximab, a relatively non-toxic therapy, when combined with chemotherapy lengthens progression-free survival (PFS) and OS, both as initial therapies as at Background: High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has become the standard approach for relapsed or high risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Several different high dose therapy (HDT) conditioning regimens have been used for NHL, such as BEAM, BEAC and CBV. Carmustine is an active drug in the HDT of NHL but the supply of carmustine is limited in some countries including Korea The purpose of this prospective multicenter phase II study was evaluate the effi cacy and safety of iv busulfan/melphalan/etoposide regimen as a conditioining regimen for high dose chemotherapy in the patients with relapsed or high risk NHL. Methods: Patients with relapsed or primary refractory NHL or chemosensitive high risk NHL underwent high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT at 12 centers in Korea. The conditioning regimen consisted of iv busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day i.v. on days -8, -7 and -6, etoposide 400 mg/m 2 /day i.v. on days -5 and -4 and melphalan 50 mg/m 2 /day i.v. on days -3 and -2. Results: Fifty one patients were enrolled onto the study. Main subgroups were DLBCL (n=25, 49%) and T cell lymphoma (n=19, 37%). All patients had successful stem cell engraftment with a median time to neutrophil recovery of more than 500/mm 3 of 10 days (range, 2 to 30 days). Platelet recovery of more than 20,000/mm 3 was seen after a median of 10 days (range, 2 to 51 days) with delayed recovery in one patient. Treatment related toxicities included nausea/vomiting in 28 patients (55%), diarrhea in 28 patients (55%) and mucositis in 33S455 patients (65%), which were grade I or II in the majority of cases. There were no VOD and treatment related death. Forty one patients (80%) achieved a complete response 1 month after ASCT, while three patients showed progressive disease. At a median follow up of 14.7 months, 21(41%) patients exhibited a relapse or progression, while 11 patients had died of disease and one patient had died of heart failure. The estimated 2-year overall and progression free survival for all patients was 64% and 40%, respectively. Conclusion: This preliminary analysis suggests that conditioning regimen of i.v. busulfan/melphalan/etoposide would be well tolerated and effective in patients with relapsed or high risk NHL. Accordingly, this regimen may be regarded as an important treatment option to substitute for BEAM regimen.",

In one patient it was his second ASCT. Results: The median of infused CD34+ cell was 3.28 (range 1,92-5.7)\u00d710 6 /Kg and after patients received G-CSF for a median of 7 (3-13) days. Engraftment was achieved in all patients. The median time for neutrophil engraftment (>500/mm 3 ) was day +11 (8-14) and for platelet engraftment (>20,000/mm 3 ) was day +14 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Infection during neutropenia developed in 15 patients (bacteremias mostly). 15 patients developed mucositis (grade I: 2, II: 6, III: 5 and IV: 2) and 4 patients received parenteral nutrition. 4 developed liver toxicity and 9 gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea). The median days of hospitalization was 24 (21-36) days. 8 patients were admitted to hospital during post-ASCT period because of infectious causes, with a median of 1 (1-6) hospital admissions. At last follow up, 14 patients are alive: 8 in CR, 1 in PR, 3 in relapse and 2 are awaiting reevaluation. Transplant related mortality at day 100 is 0%. 3 patients died as consequence of their disease. With a median follow-up of 15 months (1-59), the estimated 5-year overall survival is 75\u00b112.7% and progression-free survival is 50.6\u00b113.4%. Conclusions: With the limitation of the small number of patients and short follow-up, the addition of Zevalin in the high-dose chemotherapy regimen given prior to ASCT is feasible and with no added toxicity. This approach may have an advantage in reducing relapse rate and improve outcome.",

D. Berger, J. Hoffman, K. Moor, B. Klaeser, T. Pabst University Hospital (Berne, CH) Treatment options for pediatric patients with B cell malignancies refractory to standard therapy are limited and patients display poor prognosis. Thus novel treatment approaches are urgently required. Here we follow up nine children diseased with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) or acute leukemia being treated with FBTA05, a trifunctional anti-CD3 x anti-CD20 antibody in compassionate use. According to patient history, all children presented extensively pretreated and refractory to standard treatment (radiation, chemotherapy) including rituximab and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (fi ve patients) before treatment with FBTA05. Within individual treatment schedules, two different treatment strategies were studied. Either weekly applications of FBTA05 up to 300 \u03bcg to dissect GvL and GvHD and induce cellular immunity after allogeneic transplantation or daily applications with escalated doses up to maximal 1,000 \u03bcg to reduce tumour burden or to eradicate minimal residual disease. In context of allogeneic transplantation FBTA05 was followed by DLI in two patients. Here, in one case of NHL FBTA05 and DLI were additionally combined with lenalidomide within a second and third treatment cycle. All other children were treated stand alone with FBTA05. Eight of the nine children displayed a clinical response: two stable diseases, one partial remission and fi ve complete responses (CR). Of note, in one of these patients a molecular CR was achieved after stand alone treatment with FBTA05.In follow up overall survival (OS) is currently in the range of 59 up to 829 days. Three out of these eight responders died. Two children due to relapse or tumor progression (OS 59 days to 129 days), one due to suspected pulmonary embolism (OS 829 days). The other patients still sustain in complete or partial remission. Within follow up analysis human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs) were detectable only in one case appearing four weeks after start of FBTA05 therapy. Interestingly, two additional applications of FBTA05 could be administered safely. Thereby HAMAs disappeared four months later. Graft-versus-host disease (grade III-IV) could be observed in two patients (in one case after DLI), and resolved by further immunosuppressive therapies. Taken together, despite poor clinical prognosis of pediatric patients refractory to standard therapy follow up of 9 patients treated with FBTA05 revealed a favorable clinical outcome including partial and complete remissions.",
