The questionnaire includes questions about signalment, vaccination/injection history, microchips, topical insecticides, and occurrence of abscesses/bite wound. Controls have been recruited from the same defined population as the cases -PVS who routinely submit histopathology samples to the five collaborating diagnostic pathology services. Each time a case is identified 4 practices have been randomly selected to distribute a questionnaire to an owner of a cat visiting their practice. For each case and control a second questionnaire about vaccine protocols has been distributed to the PVS, and the medical records for each cat have also been obtained at this time.",

Epigenetics is the field of biology that deals with the study of potentially heritable DNA changes that do not involve sequence alteration in DNA, but nonetheless regulate gene expression. Covalent attachment of methyl to cytosine in CpG nucleotides is an example of an epigenetic change that may lead to gene silencing. Hypermethylation of CpG-rich areas in the promoter region of the p16 tumor suppressor gene has been identified in DNA isolated from a variety of human cancers, and environmental exposures to various agents have been shown to affect methylation status in other genes. We hypothesized that hypermethylation of CpG-rich areas of the p16 gene promoter in genomic DNA is a potential risk factor for cancer development in pet dogs.",

With written owner consent, whole blood was collected into EDTA from 48 dogs with a histological or cytological diagnosis of cancer; 59 dogs with no history of cancer were identified from the discarded samples from the PUVTH clinical pathology laboratory and also provided from a Great Dane breeding colony. Genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood specimens, and following bisulfite modification of the DNA, methylation-specific PCR was used to identify hypermethylation in the promoter region of the p16 tumor suppressor gene. Thirty (62.5%) of 48 cancer-bearing dogs had p16 promoter hypermethylation compared with 4 (6.8%) of 59 dogs without cancer. The strong association (OR 5 22.9; 95% CL, 6.6, 98.1; p , 0.00000001) between p16 promoter hypermethylation and cancer supports the concept that genomic methylation disturbances may be important for cancer development. If epigenetic changes, such as p16 promoter hypermethylation, can be identified in genomic DNA before the diagnosis of cancer, it has the potential to become a useful tool for predicting cancer risk. Because DNA methylation can be modified with a variety of drugs, it may also represent an important therapeutic and preventive target.",

Later a Calcium-dependant precipitate consisting of C-reactive protein and Very low density lipoprotein was identified as the cause of BPW (Toh et al., 2002) .

Pentatrichomonas hominis is a trichomonad that inhabits the large intestine of a number of mammalian hosts and is considered to be a commensal. Trichomonads are frequently observed in the feces of young dogs with diarrhea, where they are presumed to be P. hominis, and are of unknown pathogenic significance. Development of a sensitive and specific means to identify P. hominis in fecal samples of patients with trichomonosis and diarrhea would facilitate investigations of its pathogenicity and prompt recognition of other species of trichomonads that may infect the gastrointestinal tract.",

Our objective was to compare the hematology of dogs with A. platys and E. canis coinfection (concurrent or sequential) to dogs infected with a single agent. Six groups of 6 dogs each were evaluated: non-infected controls, A. platys infected, E. canis infected, coinfected with A. platys and E. canis, A. platys infected with E. canis administered 16 weeks later, and E. canis infected with A. platys administered 16 weeks later. Six-month old, female hound-type dogs were inoculated intravenously with Louisiana isolates of A. platys and/or E. canis. The study was conducted under compliance of an IACUC-approved protocol. Platelet and total leukocyte concentrations and hematocrits were determined weekly for 7 months after inoculation using the Bayer Advia 120. Blood PCR and serology tests confirmed that all dogs developed the specific infection(s) predicted by group assignments. Dogs in all groups initially infected with E. canis and/or A. platys developed marked thrombocytopenia; the mean platelet concentration in all infected groups was , 100 3 10 3 /mL at 3 weeks post infection. The mean platelet concentrations then gradually increased to a range of 130 to 200 3 10 3 /mL in groups with either A. platys or E. canis infection at 16 weeks post inoculation, but remained significantly lower (, 100 3 10 3 /mL) in the A. platys and E. canis coinfected group. Transient decreases in hematocrit and total leukocyte concentrations also occurred in all groups initially infected with E. canis and/or A. platys, but the mean hematocrit was significantly lower in the A. platys and E. canis coinfected group at 16 weeks postinfection. When the groups with A. platys or E. canis infections were coinfected with the alternate agent at 16 weeks after initial infection, marked thrombocytopenia occurred again in both groups. In addition, a significant but transient decrease in hematocrit and total leukocyte concentration occurred in the A. platys-infected group coinfected with E. canis. While the mechanisms of these hematologic changes are not completely understood, the thrombocytopenia and anemia that occurred in dogs coinfected with A. platys and E. canis, whether concurrent or sequential, were more persistent compared to dogs with single infections of A. platys or E. canis.",

            "text": "In the spring of 2004 an influenza A virus was recovered from the lung tissue of a racing greyhound that had succumbed to severe respiratory illness. Sequence analysis of the viral genome revealed that the canine isolate was closely related to an equine H3N8 influenza virus. Since 2004, outbreaks of canine influenza have occurred across the United States with over 35 States reporting positive cases. The widespread circulation of the H3N8 influenza virus in the dog population of the United States establishes influenza as a new threat to canine health. As rapid and accurate detection of infection in a population is a critical factor in the diagnosis and control of canine influenza, we established a one-step real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for detection and quantification of canine influenza virus. Primers and probe were chosen to detect a highly conserved region in the matrix (M) gene of equine and canine lineage H3N8 influenza A viruses. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was evaluated by use of dilution series of H3N8 influenza virus reference strains. For quantification of the viral M gene, RNA was synthesized from plasmid DNA encoding the A/Eq/WI/1/03 M gene and used as the standard to calculate the M gene copy number. Over 100 nasal and/or pharyngeal swab samples collected from dogs with clinical signs of respiratory disease were tested to evaluate the performance of the real-time RT-PCR assay. The results of the real-time RT-PCR assay were compared with results of virus isolation in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, detection of influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) using a commercially available optical immunoassay (OIA) kit (Directigen Flu AH, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), as well as serology. Nasal influenza virus shedding detected by real-time RT-PCR was in the range of 10 3 to 10 7 M gene RNA copies per 140 ml of swab sample. Increased sensitivity was found in overall virus detection with the real-time RT-PCR compared to both virus isolation and the OIA assay. In conclusion, the realtime RT-PCR assay can be used to improve the early and rapid detection of canine influenza virus during outbreaks of respiratory disease. The assay is an excellent diagnostic tool with high sensitivity, specificity, and fast turnaround time.",

The seropositive dogs were located at tracks involved in respiratory disease outbreaks of unknown etiology that involved thousands of dogs across the U.S. This suggests that CIV may have been the causative agent of those outbreaks. Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an integral component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and is the major toxin that triggers septic shock. LPS engages with the innate immune system of mammals via pattern recognition receptors on a range of host cells and the result can be both beneficial and detrimental to the host. These processes have been widely examined in vitro and in experimental animal models, including the dog. A range of methods for detection of LPS have been developed, with the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay as the most widespread. However, it is notoriously difficult to produce reliable results with the LAL on biological fluids because of numerous interfering reactions and the presence of endogenous LPS-binding factors in blood and plasma. Reliable detection of circulating LPS is, however, necessary if the value of LPS as a clinical marker in canine sepsis were to be assessed.",

This novel type of assay uses the priming effects of complement opsonized immune complexes on the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils as an analytical chemiluminiscence (CL) platform. In short, one assay tube (blank) reflects baseline neutrophil activation in the absence of exogenous immune complexes. A second tube (test) contains a specific anti-LPS IgM that stimulates neutrophil activity in proportion to the concentration of LPS in the blood. The third tube (max) contains specific anti-LPS IgM and an excess of LPS (2 ng/mL) so that the CL reflects the maximum response of the individual patient sample. The differences in neutrophil activation and cell count between individual samples are normalized by subtracting the light integral of the blank from the test and max tubes and expressing the EA as the ratio of the test (minus blank) to the max (minus blank). To assess sensitivity, freshly drawn EDTA-stabilized blood from 5 healthy donors was incubated with E.coli LPS (Sigma) at various concentrations (0 to 2 ng/mL) and subsequently analyzed for EA running unspiked samples as controls. To assess clinical specificity in the lack of a golden standard test for circulating LPS, the EA was obtained from (A) healthy dogs (n522), (B) diseased dogs without an acute phase reaction [APR] (n55) and (C) dogs with an APR and circulating toxic neutrophils (n58), expecting a significantly higher mean level of EA in group C.",

Optimizing infection control and biosecurity is vital to delivery of the highest quality care to veterinary patients and clients. Though veterinarians are typically aware of the importance of infection control practices, there are no published studies characterizing components of infection control programs used at major hospitals such as Veterinary Teaching Hospitals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize biosecurity practices used at American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) accredited VTHs. The Hospital Directors at all 38 AVMA accredited facilities were asked to identify the person most knowledgeable about the biosecurity and infection control practices at their institution. The identified expert was invited to participate in a 15-20 minute confidential phone interview. The survey instrument was designed to be brief and focused on the major principles of optimal biosecurity programs; interviews included questions regarding hygiene, surveillance, patient contact, education and awareness, program structure, and opinions about important issues. Results indicated that most VTHs had biosecurity programs documented in written policies and supported by an infection control committee. Hygiene protocols and surveillance activities varied among VTHs and were more stringent among institutions that had documented outbreaks of nosocomial infections within the past five years. Experts interviewed often had difficulty in comparing the rigor of their institution's program relative to others as they often were not aware of the programs used at other hospitals. Characterizing and describing infection control at AVMA accredited institutions will help hospital administrators to better optimize patient care through infection control and biosecurity at their facilities.",

The way of transmission of these agents between cats is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to investigate indirect, direct and interspecies transmission of feline hemoplasmas by examining fleas, ticks and rodents as well as saliva and feces from hemoplasma infected cats for the presence the agents. A total of 2,198 ticks and 77 fleas were collected from pet animals or vegetation in Switzerland. Furthermore, blood or tissue samples from 256 free-living Swiss rodents were available. Salivary and fecal swabs were regularly collected from two cats experimentally infected with 'Candidatus M. turicensis' until days 226 and 186 post infection, respectively, and from privately owned cats infected with 'Candidatus M. haemominutum' (4 cats), M. haemofelis (1 cat) or 'Candidatus M. turicensis' (1 cat). DNA was extracted from all samples and subjected to specific real-time PCR assays to investigate the presence of haemoplasmas; some positive samples were confirmed by sequencing. Feline hemoplasmas were detected in cat fleas and in few Ixodes sp. and Rhipicephalus sp. ticks directly collected from animals, but not in ticks collected from vegetation or in rodent samples, although the latter were frequently Mycoplasma coccoides PCR-positive. When investigating shedding patterns of feline hemoplasmas, 'Candidatus M. turicensis' DNA was detected in salivary and fecal swabs up to nine weeks after infection; all swabs collected at later stages of the infection or at time points with undetectable bacteremia tested PCR negative. M. haemofelis and 'Candidatus M. haemominutum' DNA was not amplified from saliva and feces of naturally infected cats, despite of high hemoplasma blood loads. Our results suggest that, besides an ostensible indirect transmission by fleas, a direct transmission through saliva and feces in the early phase of infection could play a role in the epidemiology of feline hemoplasmas. Rodents and ticks were not found to be relevant reservoirs of feline hemoplasmas in Switzerland. Tritrichomonas foetus (TF) is a protozoal pathogen of cats where intestinal infection results in inflammatory colitis and intractable large bowel diarrhea. A 5-nitromidazole, ronidazole, was effective in eradicating experimental TF infection in cats (on the basis of PCR) but is not approved for use in the U.S. and is moderately neurotoxic. Tinidazole (TDZ) is a 5-nitroimidazole licensed in the U.S. for treatment of Giardia, Entamoeba, and T.vaginalis infections in people and has a wide margin of safety. The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of TDZ for treatment of cats with experimentally-induced TF infection.",

Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor which is useful during management of hyperdynamic shock. The expected hemodynamic response to an infusion of norepinephrine is an increase in arterial blood pressure. In normal foals, norepinephrine increased arterial blood pressure without changing renal function. Fenoldopam is a dopamine-1 receptor agonist which increased urine output without affecting systemic hemodynamics in normotensive foals. The combination of norepinephrine and fenoldopam may therefore be beneficial. 5 pony foals, 30 to 56 hours of age, were studied. All were born at term and considered to be healthy on the basis of clinical examination, hematology and baseline measurements of cardiac output (lithium dilution) and arterial blood pressure. The foals were sedated with 5-10 mg of intravenous diazepam and instrumented with jugular venous, dorsal metatarsal arterial and urinary catheters for the study. The foals were allowed to stand and nurse from the dam, and given a recovery period of 1 hour from the administration of diazepam. The foals were then restrained in lateral recumbency on a foal mat and given an infusion of norepinephrine (0.3 mcg/kg/min), a combined norepinephrine (0.3 mcg/kg/min) and fenoldopam (0.04 mcg/kg/min) infusion and a control dose of saline, in a double blind, randomized study. Each infusion was maintained for 30 minutes, and measurements were performed during the last 20 minutes of infusion. The washout period was at least 40 minutes between infusions.

Oligofructose alters the bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract and causes triggering factors to be released into the blood. These intestinal events may also create systemic disturbances that could contribute to the development of laminitis. We hypothesized that OF administration would significantly alter glucose dynamics in horses. All horses were fed 1 g/kg body weight (bwt) OF mixed with oats each morning for 6 days (pre-induction period).

The majority (86/89) had an altered mentation ranging from lethargic to comatose, and 79/86 displayed abnormal behavior. Cranial nerve deficits were common (60/69). Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities (82/ 85) were characterized by increased protein (mean 139 mg/dL), pleocytosis (mean 257 nucleated cells/ml) with high proportion of neutrophils (mean 46%). Most horses deteriorated rapidly and either died (9) or were euthanized (77). Seizures occurred in 39% of horses. Confirmation of EEE was based on necropsy (49), serology (11) or both (35). A complete necropsy was performed in 84 horses. Common histopathologic findings included acute lymphocytic or neutrophilic meningoencephalitis. Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is characterized by severe and highly fatal diffuse brain disease in young horses. Medical records from 72 horses, donkeys and ponies with hypertriglyceridemia were reviewed retrospectively. No age predilection was apparent. 46/ 72 of the horses were female, and only 11 were lactating or pregnant. The most common breeds that were represented were the American Miniature Horse (21/72), stock breeds (19/72), Arabians and Arabian crosses (13/72) and Miniature Sicilian Donkeys (7/72). Common concurrent problems included colitis (20/72), colic (15/72) and pneumonia (5/72). The equids were divided into groups based on the severity of their hypertriglyceridemia and whether they had been treated or not treated with insulin. Groups A and B consisted of equids with triglyceride concentrations ,500 mg/dl on admission. Group A was not treated with insulin while Group B received insulin. Group C consisted of equids with triglyceride concentrations .500 mg/dl on admission and were treated with insulin. Mean triglyceride concentrations did not differ significantly between Groups A and B on admission (2186140.3 mg/dl vs. 2896116.4 mg/dl; p50.106) but triglycerides dropped significantly after insulin treatment in Group B (62.1627.2 mg/dl; p,0.001) and were significantly lower than in Group A after treatment (331.56286.5 mg/dl; p,0.001). Group A pre and post-treatment values were not significantly different from each other (p50.267). Group C also had a significant decrease in triglyceride concentrations after insulin treatment (pre: 881 mg/dl vs. post: 107 mg/dl; p50.002). These findings suggest that all ages, breeds and genders of equids with a variety of commonly encountered disease states are susceptible to hypertriglyceridemia and that insulin treatment decreases triglyceride concentrations in equids with moderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Neonatal septicemia is the leading cause of foal mortality. Hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations have been associated with mortality in other species and adult horses. The blood concentrations of ionized calcium (Ca 2+ ), magnesium (Mg 2+ ), and the endocrine response of calcium-regulating hormones have not been investigated in septic foals.",

Initially, 3 foals received IV butorphanol and 3 foals received IM butorphanol at 0.05 mg/kg; after a washout period treatments were reversed. Both for the IV and IM study, blood samples were collected prior to butorphanol administration and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 , and 360 min. Butorphanol concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. During the washout period, the foals were used as their own control group for the physiologic and behavioral data. The control study mimicked the interventions used in the treatment groups. Physiological data was obtained at the same time blood samples were collected and included heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and gastrointestinal motility. Behavioral data was obtained using a 2 h real-time video recording beginning at time 0 by calculating time budgets of behavior (active, inactive, nursing, and recumbent). Data were assessed using noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The terminal half-life of butorphanol was 2.1 h and C 0 was 33.2612.1 ng/mL after the IV injection. Systemic clearance was very rapid at 3164.3 mL/kg/min and the apparent volume of distribution (steady-state) was 3.861.9 L/kg. For the IM injection, C max and T max were 20.163.5 ng/ml and 5.962.1 min respectively. The terminal half-life was shorter at 0.94 h after the IM injection, but with systemic absorption of 66.1611.9% the terminal slope may not have been captured. Butorphanol administration caused minimal effects on heart rate, respiratory rate, and gastrointestinal motility. Rectal temperatures ranged from 100.6 uF to 102.4 uF in all foals. However, temperatures from foals that received butorphanol were significantly higher than temperatures from foals in the control group. Compared to an earlier study in adult horses, the clearance of butorphanol is much faster in foals and the apparent volume of distribution larger, but the systemic absorption is higher (66% in this study versus 37% in adult horses). Other than the transient sedative effects observed after butorphanol administration, no adverse effects were associated with the use of butorphanol in neonatal foals. Video taped behavioral data analysis is in progress. Sepsis is the number one cause of foal mortality. The cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) responses to sepsis are well documented in human critical care medicine; however limited data exists in foals.",

Blood samples from all calves were collected 24 hours after colostrum administration and analyzed for serum total protein concentration using a digital reftractometer and immunoglobulin (IgG) concentration using radial immunodiffusion by an independent laboratory. Calves fed fresh colostrum (group 1) had significantly higher serum total protein levels (5.4 6 0.5 g/dl) and IgG concentrations (1,760 6 560 mg/dl) as compared to calves in either group 2 (4.4 6 0.3 g/dl, 750 6 130 mg/dl) or group 3 (4.7 6 0.5 g/dl, 910 6 550 mg/dl). Calves fed the colostrum replacer also had a significantly higher percentage of the group with failure of passive transfer (serum IgG , 1,000 mg/dL), as the percentage of calves with inadequate passive transfer were 5%, 95%, and 76% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Feeding three packages of the replacer product tended to increase the serum IgG concentrations and decrease the percentage of calves with failure of passive transfer over feeding two packages; however, the mean serum IgG remained significantly lower, and there was a significantly higher percentage of calves with failure of passive transfer when compared to group 1.",

Therefore, it should not be used as a colostrum replacer. Furthermore, measuring the mass of IgG contained in a colostrum replacer product appears to be an inadequate method of determining the effectiveness of these products at preventing failure of passive transfer. Commercial colostrum replacer (CR) products may offer producers a convenient and clean immunoglobulin (Ig) source. Interest in CR has increased as a method for ensuring adequate colostrum supplies and preventing transmission of infectious diseases. However, concerns about the ability of CR to provide successful passive transfer continue to inhibit widespread use.

Comparing IgG in crias to recommendations used for calves suggests that in many instances, two or more units of plasma may be required to achieve plasma IgG concentrations exceeding 1000 mg/dL. In order to evaluate factors relating to survival in sick alpaca crias, records from 65 hospitalized crias aged # 60 days were examined. In total 83 variables were recorded. Factors for evaluation included physical and diagnostic findings assessed within 12 hours of admission to the hospital. Physical exam findings included heart and respiratory rates, temperature, and body position. Diagnostic findings included blood gas analyses, complete blood cell counts, and biochemistry profiles. Specific clinical pathology parameters included white blood cell and platelet counts, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios (N:L ratio), liver enzyme activities and concentrations of electrolytes, fibrinogen, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, b-hydroxybutyrate, and non-esterified fatty acids. Other variables assessed included the body system affected by disease, and the primary medical condition. Of the 65 crias evaluated, 45 survived and 20 died or were euthanized. Survival of crias was not associated with gender. Of the 45 crias that survived 24 were female and 21 were male. Of the 20 crias that died 9 were female and 11 were male. The average age at admission of crias that survived was 15.1 6 18.3 days. The average age at admission of crias that died was 17.9 6 19.3 days. Univariate analysis showed multiple variables associated with death. Several models were identified by forward stepwise selection into multivariate logistic regression to explain the variability in the data. Overall, measurable variables such as blood pH, BUN, N:L ratio and serum total protein were more significantly associated with death than categorical variables such as the presence or absence of pneumonia, recumbency or degree of mentation. The final logistic regression model that best predicted survival outcome included blood pH, total serum protein and N:L ratio. These findings suggest that measurable variables can be used to predict probability of survival in alpaca crias. Third compartment (C3) ulcers are a serious medical condition in stressed and sick camelids. Usually, ulcers are treated by the use of orally administered anti-ulcer medications including H-2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors. Previous work has shown that many of these medications currently used in veterinary medicine, such as ranitidine and cimetidine, are ineffective in altering C3 pH in camelids. Research in dromedary camels demonstrated that omeprazole, currently marketed for horses as Gastro-Gard, has detectable blood levels when administered orally. However, the pharmacokinetics of orally administered omeprazole in llamas suggests that it will be ineffective at raising C3 pH. To date, there is no published research evaluating the effect of omeprazole on C3 pH. The goal of this research was to measure the C3 pH in 6 healthy male alpacas administered orally 4 mg/kg of omeprazole paste daily.",

Determination of free (protein unbound) drug concentrations in the interstitial fluid (ISF) -the site of most bacterial infections -is important to assess whether dosing regimens are meeting targeted concentrations.

The calves in group 2 received 1 oz. of TAHITIAN NONI TM puree q12h in milk replacer. Calves had access to 7 oz. calf starter and 1 gallon of water per day. Two milliters of EDTA anticoagulated blood was collected from each calf on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Day 0 signified the day after arrival, before the first puree feeding between 36 and 48 h of age. Gram negative and gram positive phagocytic assays were performed as follows: E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis from frozen stocks were inoculated separately onto trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood and incubated at 37uC for 18-24 hrs. Bacteria were resuspended in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and then for each sample, 450 ml blood (5 3 10 6 cells/ml) was added to RPMI medium and 50 ml of bacteria. Growth controls were prepared by adding diluted bacteria to RPMI. Samples and controls were incubated for 2 h at 37uC, serially diluted ten fold in TSB, plated in duplicate on blood agar plates and incubated 18-24 h at 37uC. Plates with 30 to 300 colonies were counted and colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml) were determined to calculate percentage killing. Differences were computed for each calf pair for % bacterial kill. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared the median differences between the Noni TM and control calves. Analyses were stratified by day (0, 3, 7, or 14 days) for gram negative and gram positive results. The experiment-wise error rate was controlled at the 5% level within each response using a Bonferroni p-value correction. TAHITIAN NONI TM puree treated calves had progressively greater gram-negative bacterial killing than control calves over time, and achieved significance on day 14. There was no difference between groups for gram-positive killing. Controlled clinical trials are warranted to test the clinical application of TAHITIAN NONI TM puree in promoting calf health and production. Urine is an aqueous biological solution containing 5 strong ions (high Na, K, Cl, and low Ca, Mg concentrations) and 4 buffers over the physiologic range for urine pH (2 volatile buffers [bicarbonate and ammonia] and 2 nonvolatile buffers [monobasic phosphate, creatinine]. Translating physicochemical approach to urine it is hypothesized that the primary determinants of the urinary pH is simplified SID as expressed as [(Na +K)2 (Cl)].",

There was good correlation between pH calc and pH meas in this small sample size. Electroneutrality (table E-neutrality) was off, likely indicating measurement problems with ion specific electrodes. In conclusion pH and bicarbonate concentration (TCO 2 ) of urine are primarily dependent on SID suggesting that traditional pathophysiologic interpretation of paradoxical aciduria in cows with longstanding hypochloremic alkalosis and mechanisms of renal tubular acidosis will have to be revisited by using the strong ion approach.

Results of this study indicate that a serious situation for control of nematode parasites is emerging in goats in Indiana. The aims of this study were to describe the echocardiographic appearance of the adult Jersey (J) cow and Holstein Friesian (HF) cows and to establish normal dimensions for adult cattle. Ten healthy non-lactating J cows (438626 Kg) and twelve lactating HF cows (636655 Kg) were recruited; 1 J cow was excluded due to the appearance of pulmonary valve prolapse. Standard images were obtained using a previously described technique through left and right imaging windows. Inter-and intra-operator repeatability was assessed. Statistical tests used included Student's T-test and repeated measures ANOVA. All images were obtained in all twenty-three cattle but required some physical effort. The os chordis was visible as a subaortic hyperechoic area that cast a shadow and was more frequently identified in J cows than HF cows (40% and 10% respectively in the caudal right long axis view of the LV and in 100% and 30% respectively in the cranial right long axis view). Mean (6SD) standard echocardiographic dimensions are displayed in table 1. No significant differences were found between repeated measures and only the pulmonary artery diameter was significantly different between operators (p50.03). In conclusion this is a relatively straightforward technique that is repeatable. Differences seen between breeds can be explained by body size except for the left ventricular and interventricular septal thickness in systole, which was relatively larger in J cows. The os chordis may be seen less in HF cows than J cows which may represent breed difference or an effect of lactation. The aims of this study were to describe the echocardiographic appearance of the adult sheep and goat and to establish normal dimensions. Seven healthy sheep (5 rams and 2 ewes) (79611 Kg) and six healthy goats (1 castrated male and 5 females) (43.568 Kg) were recruited. Standard echocardiographic images were obtained using a previously described technique through left and right imaging windows. Inter-and intra-operator repeatability was assessed. Statistical tests used included Student's T-test and repeated measures ANOVA. All images were obtained in all thirteen sheep and goats, and the technique was very well tolerated in the female animals and castrated goat and adequately tolerated in the rams. One goat and two rams had very small imaging windows because of the presence of lung tissue. Standard echocardiographic dimensions are displayed in table 1. There were no differences between repeated measures of echocardiographic dimensions or between operators. When dimensions were corrected for body size, significant differences in dimension existed between species. In conclusion, echocardiographic measurements show good repeatability within and between operators, and differences in cardiac dimensions between sheep and goats are cannot be explained by differences in body weight alone. Sheep and goats therefore need separate normal ranges for cardiac parameters. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are elevated in dogs with congestive heart failure. Moreover, BNP has been reported to be higher in dogs with occult dilated cardiomyopathy and mitral valve disease (MVD), and severe increases in BNP could predict cardiac mortality. The natriuretic peptides have been suggested to be useful in detecting clinically inapparent MVD as an alternative to more expensive and time-consuming diagnostic modalities. Therefore, we sought to determine the ability of plasma ANP and BNP determinations to detect clinically inapparent MVD, and to investigate if the natriuretic peptides were associated with progression of MVD.",

Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction plays a fundamental role in congestive heart failure. Diastolic function can be assessed by measuring the peak early (E-wave) and peak late (A-wave) myocardial tissue velocity during diastole using echocardiographic tissue Doppler velocity imaging (TVI). In cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) E-waves measured using TVI differed from those of healthy cats and were comparable to those reported in humans with HCM and restrictive cardiomyopathy, respectively. To use TVI measurements as a clinical tool for the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction, it is therefore necessary to know potential influence factors on the measurements. E-and A-waves fuse commonly with high heart rates. However, it is unknown how this fusion might effect TVI measurements.

Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MVD) is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. There appears to be a difference in disease progression and myocardial function between small and large breed dogs, but assessment of myocardial function is difficult due to preload dependency of conventional echocardiographic methods. Myocardial strain (S) and strain rate (SR) imaging are new echocardiographic imaging methods that reflect the deformation and rate of deformation, respectively. They allow quantitative assessment of regional myocardial function and are reported to be relatively pre-and afterload independent.

Intravenous LEV (IV-LEV) has recently become available, and has the potential use as a safe and effective emergency therapy for cluster seizures and status epilepticus. Prior studies of IV-LEV in humans and dogs have shown that large IV doses of the drug are well-tolerated; however, the pharmacokinetics of IV-LEV in dogs has not been thoroughly described in the veterinary literature. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of a 60 mg/kg IV bolus of sterile LEV in normal dogs.",

IV-LEV is well-tolerated in normal dogs when bolused at 60 mg/kg and rapidly achieves serum [LEV] well above this range. In addition, [LEV] was maintained within or above this range at all time periods in all dogs. The clinical utility of IV-LEV in epileptic dogs remains to be determined. Twenty-two dogs with idiopathic epilepsy which were pharmacoresistant to phenobarbitone and bromide were treated with levetiracetam as an addon medication. Records of eight dogs were used retrospectively to determine a safe, efficient levetiracetam dosage. Fourteen dogs were entered into a prospective, open label, non-comparative study. Oral levetiracetam was administered as an additional therapy, first at 10 mg/kg and later at 20 mg/ kg three times daily until seizure frequency was reduced by $50% or greater. Eight dogs responded initially to 10 mg/kg and one to 20 mg/kg three times daily. Levetiracetam-Responders had a significant decrease in seizure frequency by 77% (7.965.2 to 1.861.7) and a decrease in seizure days per month by 68% (3.861.7 to 1.261.1). However, six out of nine Levetiracetam-Responders experienced an increase in seizure frequency and seizure days after four to eight months. One of the initial Levetiracetam-Responders was weaned off levetiracetam after it had lost its effectiveness for seizure control. Then only the dog's cluster seizures were controlled successfully by levetiracetam 20 mg/kg three times daily. After each cluster the dog's levetiracetam dosage was tapered off over a three day period. Levetiracetam was well-tolerated by all dogs; sedation was the only side-effect reported in one out of fourteen dogs. In conclusion, levetiracetam was only effective in reducing seizure frequency initially for the first four to eight months in the majority of dogs with phenobarbitone and bromide resistant epilepsy. Intermittent pulsed treatment of cluster seizures could be an efficacious and cost effective alternative. Four cats were diagnosed with a polyneuropathy based on clinical signs (n54), electrodiagnostic evaluation (n53), CSF analysis (n54), and nerve and muscle histopathology (n54). Two domestic short hair cats, one Abyssinian, and one Bengal cat were included. All cats were neutered males and were ten months to two years of age. All four cats presented for the evaluation of progressive pelvic limb weakness ranging from one to five months duration. Neurological findings included trembling (n51), weakness (n54), muscle atrophy (n53), spinal hyperpathia (n51), and reduced reflexes (n53). Blood chemistry abnormalities included elevated (1.5-43 normal) serum creatine kinase concentrations in two cats. Complete blood count revealed neutropenia in the Abyssinian. Serological testing was negative for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline corona virus, and Toxoplasma gondii in all four cats. Lumbar CSF protein was ,40 mg/dl (n53) and 91 mg/dl (n51) with white blood cell counts of 0/ uL (n52), 4/uL (n51), and 6/uL (n51). Electrodiagnostic evaluation performed in three cats revealed widespread appendicular fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, complex repetitive discharges, reduced nerve conduction velocity, and reduced M wave amplitudes.",

Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB is a lysosomal storage disorder with severe neurological and mild somatic signs. Biochemically, MPS IIIB is characterized by the primary lysosomal storage of heparan sulfate, which is caused by an autosomally inherited deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyl-alpha-Dglucosaminidase. In humans no effective therapy exists and patients succumb to disease usually in their teens. Lack of therapies and the rarity of MPS IIIB make animal models critical to development of novel therapies.

The Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER) is currently the standard testing method for the evaluation of hearing in dogs. Where asymmetrical hearing loss is present, the simultaneous presentation of masking noise to the non-test ear is routinely performed during human BAER in order to eliminate the cross-over effect.

Previous studies of human oligodendroglial neoplasms have demonstrated the diagnostic and prognostic values of histomorphologic features and immunocytochemical markers. Primary spontaneous canine intracranial tumors share many biologic behaviors and pathologic features of their human counterparts. The objectives of this study were to determine if associations existed between five histomorphologic features (mitoses, cellular atypia, necrosis, vascular hypertrophy, and vascular proliferation), and three immunocytochemical markers (GFAP, EGFR, and Ki-67 labeling index) and the degree of malignancy, as defined by WHO grading criteria, of 15 canine oligodendroglial tumors. Of the histomorphologic variables examined, mitoses and cellular atypia were significantly greater in Grade III oligodendrogliomas than in Grade II oligodendrogliomas (p 5 0.002, and p 5 0.004, respectively), but no differences were noted between these features and Grade II oligoastrocytomas and Grade II or Grade III oligodendrogliomas. No significant associations were found between GFAP or EGFR immunoreactivity and tumor type or grade. The median percentage of Ki-67 immunoreactivity was significantly different between all tumor types and grades (p ,0.05), and was significantly higher in Grade III oligodendrogliomas than in both oligoastrocytomas (p 5 0.014) and Grade II oligodendrogliomas (p 5 0.006). These results indicate that although mitoses and cellular atypia are useful histomorphologic features for the differentiation of oligodendroglial tumors, none of the variables examined reliably distinguished mixed gliomas from oligodendrogliomas. The presence of GFAP immunoreactivity in all tumor types suggests that oligodendroglial tumors may arise from a common multipotential cellular lineage. Similar to what has been demonstrated in humans, the Ki-67 labeling index correlated well with the degree of malignancy in the tumors studied. Oral iodine-containing cholecystographic agents have been used for treatment of hyperthyroidism in humans and cats.

            "text": "Our finding that pet cats in the U.S. have high PBDE serum levels is in good accord with the most consistently identified risk factor for development of FH, namely indoor living. We further propose that house cats -because of their meticulous grooming behavior -not only come in direct contact with these consumer products, they readily ingest any volatilized PBDE-like material or PBDE-laden dust that deposits on their fur. Future studies are needed to elucidate if and how PBDE bioaccumulation of this magnitude in cats can disrupt maintenance of their thyroid-endocrine-axis. These findings may have public health ramifications. (This abstract does not reflect USEPA policy). Epidemiological studies of hyperthyroid cats have implicated consistent risk factors for the disease to include age and exposure to canned cat food. Flavonoids which are soy proteins and known endocrine disruptors have been found in high concentrations in cat food. As cats are obligate carnivores, such plant proteins may represent a novel food source, not encountered in the wild. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of flavonoids on thyroid cell activation in culture. A previously characterized feline hyperthyroid cell line, PetCat2, was used for this study. Cells were passed onto coverslips and starved for 6 days to reduce cell activation to basal levels. One hundred mM thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 1 nM-10 mM Quercetin, or vehicle was added along with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cells were incubated for 48 hours, and positive fluorescence was assessed using epifluorscence microscopy. Mitogenesis was assessed by quantifying the cells positively stained with BrdU as a percentage of the total cells present in the same microscopic field. Basal mitogenesis of the starved PetCat 2 cells in culture was 5 +/22%. Upon the addition of TSH, BrdU positive cells increased significantly (p50.01) to 23 +/216%. Quercetin caused an increase in BrdU uptake in the cells to 77 +/2 18%. This was significantly higher than stimulation by TSH (p ,0.001). Stimulation of mitogenesis by Quercetin was concentration-dependent with the greatest effect seen at 100 mM. These results demonstrate that Quercetin, a flavonoid, can mitogenically activate feline hyperthyroid cells in culture. Early diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats is confounded by the common occurrence of stress hyperglycemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum fructosamine concentration as an indicator of abnormal glucose homeostasis in obese cats without overt DM. Loss of bi-phasic insulin secretion in response to IV glucose, a hallmark of DM in people, has been demonstrated in obese cats. Body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), age, diet and serum total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations were determined prospectively in 30 non-diabetic cats. All cats were healthy (excluding obesity) neutered males. Mean age was 10.4 6 2.2 years (range 6-15 years), mean BW was 6.0 6 1.6 kg (range 3.7-10.9 kg), and mean BCS was 6 6 1.5 (range 3-9). All cats had normal serum TT4 concentrations. Mean serum fructosamine was 304.3 6 39.5 mmol/L (range 219-399, reference range 142-450 mmol/L). No correlations were found between fructosamine and BW (r 5 0.102, P 5 0.591), fructosamine and BCS (r 5 0.08, P 5 0.675), fructosamine and age (r 5 0.044, P 5 0.819) and fructosamine and TT4 (r 5 20.009, P 5 0.968). Fructosamine concentrations were not significantly different (P 5 0.844) when cats were divided into two groups on either side of the mean BW (6.0 kg), or when cats weighing , 4.6 kg were compared to those weighing . 6 kg (P 5 0.682). Fructosamine was not significantly different (P 5 0.732) when cats were divided into two groups separated by mean BCS (6), or when cats with BCS , 5 were compared with those with BCS . 6 (P 5 0.196). It is unlikely that prediabetic conditions characterized by mild increases in average blood glucose can be detected by changes in serum fructosamine concentrations in cats. Diabetic dogs are insulin deficient but the remainder of the hormonal milieu is unclear. We hypothesized that there are abnormalities in other glucoregulatory hormones (cortisol, glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) in diabetic dogs. In a prospective, observational study, we investigated the hormonal status of diabetic (D) and nondiabetic dogs (N). Blood was collected from 65 dogs (17 N, 48 D). The serum ketone concentrations were significantly different (N, 18 [7 to 26] ; D, 162 [31 to 21148] mmol/L, median, 5 to 95% range, p,.001), as were fasting serum glucose concentrations (N, 10069; D, 4526124 mg/dl, p,0.001, mean6SD). The concentration of insulin was not significantly different between groups, even though the diabetic dogs had not received insulin for $ 12 hours before sampling (N, 564.5; D, 12623.4 mU/ml, p50.23). Glucagon (N, 40.468.9; D, 110693 pg/ ml, p50.003), norepinephrine (N, 3606140; D, 5206294 pg/ml, p50.036), and dopamine (N, 28.7614.5; D, 73.9680.3, p50 .025) concentrations all differed significantly between groups. Cortisol (N, 2.14 60.89; D, 5.2166.95 mg/dl, p50.076) and epinephrine concentrations (N, 2156169; D, 1606150 pg/ml, p50.213) were not different between groups. There was a strong relationship between serum ketone and glucagon concentrations (P, 0.001, R 2 adj 5 0.48) but not between serum ketone and insulin concentrations (P50.15, R 2 adj 50.02). There were significant relationships between serum ketone and cortisol (P , 0.001, R 2 adj 5 0.69), norepinephrine (P , 0.001, R 2 adj 5 0.37) and dopamine (P , 0.001, R 2 adj 5 0.22), but not epinephrine, concentrations. We conclude that the degree of ketosis is related to the overall hormonal status of the dog and not solely to serum insulin concentration. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn human analogue insulin (Humulin NH) is commonly used for treatment of canine diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this insulin have not been reported in dogs with naturally-occurring DM. The goal of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Humulin NH in a clinical setting of dogs with naturally-occurring DM.",

Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) is increasingly used for TSHstimulation tests in dogs. Several stimulation protocols have been proposed and dosage of rhTSH still is a matter of debate but has not been assessed systematically in a clinical setting. Because a major limiting factor for the use of rhTSH resides in the cost of the product, the aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible influence of the dosage of rhTSH on the magnitude of stimulation in suspected hypothyroid dogs. Dogs presented to the Clinic for Small Animals at the University of Zurich with clinical signs consistent with hypothyroidism were stimulated with 75 mg rhTSH (ThyrogenH) IV per dog independent of their body weight (first stimulation). Blood samples were taken before and 6 hours after rhTSH administration for determination of total serum thyroxine (T4) concentration. Dogs were placed into 1 of 3 groups as follows: those with normal (i.e., post-stimulation values indicative of euthyroidism), unchanged (i.e., post-stimulation values indicative of hypothyroidism; no thyroid gland stimulation), or intermediate (i.e., poststimulation values between unchanged and normal values) post-TSH T4 concentrations. Dogs were included in the present study, if they did not have a normal stimulation in response to rhTSH administration (i.e. unchanged or intermediate), if they had a body weight of .20 kg and if owners agreed. Within 1 to 4 weeks after the first stimulation those dogs received a higher dose of rhTSH, which was twice the original dose (150 mg rhTSH IV, second stimulation). T4 concentrations were determined in blood samples before and 6 hours after the rhTSH administration. Thirteen dogs of different breeds with a median age of 6 years (range 5-12) and median body weight of 32 kg (range 23.5-104.0) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. None of the dogs showed adverse reactions after neither the first nor the second rhTSH administration. Median (range) T4 concentrations after the first and second stimulation were 1.2 mg/dl (0.8-3.5) and 1.3 mg/dl (0.5-2.0), respectively, which were not statistically significantly different. Post-TSH T4 concentrations after the first and second stimulation were 2.0 mg/dl (1.1-4.7) and 2.5 mg/dl (1.2-3.5), respectively, revealing that the higher dose did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in thyroid gland stimulation. Although the number of dogs in our study was small, the results of our study show that TSH-stimulation test using rhTSH is a safe diagnostic tool even after repeated stimulation. The dosage does not seem to influence the magnitude of stimulation suggesting that 75 mg rhTSH per dog can be used independent of the dog's body weight. In people biliary sludge is considered a risk factor for the formation of choleliths. Important components of sludge are cholesterol and bilirubin crystals. Altered biliary cholesterol, calcium and bilirubin concentrations, as well as a shift towards the more hydrophobic bile salts are considered to contribute to sludge formation. In dogs biliary sludge is a common finding upon abdominal ultrasonographic examination, and we commonly encounter gallbladder sludge in our patients with hypercortisolism. Recent data implicate, that gallbladder mucocele is frequently associated with hypercortisolism. However, cause and effect between hypercortisolism and formation of gallbladder mucocele is unknown. Furthermore it is not known, if mucoceles are formed due to changes in bile composition, altered gallbladder motility with biliary stasis, altered water absorption or epithelial mucus hypersecretion. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of iatrogenic hypercortisolism on biliary sludge formation and bile composition in dogs.",

No change in pH that could affect solubility of BA was found. The decrease in cholesterol may be a consequence of increased cholic acid turn-over and synthesis. The increased occurrence of biliary sludge in hypercortisolism may result from increases in various free BA, as they precipitate more easily due to a higher pKa compared to conjugated BA. Finally, the increase in the more hydrophobic deoxycholic acid may have affected gallbladder motility and decelerated bile flow. Although definitive diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism is usually achieved with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test using 250 mcg/dog of synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin or tetracosactrin), increased costs have prompted a search for less expensive diagnostic methods. In healthy dogs and dogs with untreated hyperadrenocorticism, a dose of 5 mcg/kg of ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortices as effectively as a dose of 250 mcg/dog. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine whether a low-dose ACTH stimulation test (5 mcg/kg) would distinguish between dogs with non-adrenal illness and those with hypoadrenocorticism. A preliminary study confirmed the validity of performing two ACTH stimulation tests 22-24 hours apart.",

            "text": "In a prospective clinical study, 17 client-owned dogs with signs suggestive of hypoadrenocorticism received two ACTH stimulation tests approximately 24 hours apart. In a crossover design, subjects randomly received either a dose of 5 mcg/kg or 250 mcg/dog on the first day, and the alternate dose on the second day. All samples from each patient were assayed in the same run. Response to ACTH was determined by the post-ACTH stimulation cortisol concentration, and difference between pre-and post-stimulation cortisol concentrations. Final diagnosis for each test and effect on clinical decision making was also determined. Mean (6 SD) cortisol responses to ACTH in the 5 mcg/kg dose [17.0 6 8.8 mcg] and 250 mcg/dog dose [16.7 6 6.5 mcg] were statistically equivalent (p for equivalence 50.843). The use of 5 mcg/kg cosyntropin in stimulation testing appears to be effective for diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism in dogs. Trilostane (Vetoryl), an enzyme blocker, has been recommended for the treatment of naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism (HC) in dogs with an initial dosing frequency recommendation of once daily (OD). However, OD therapy has been inconsistent in achieving resolution of clinical signs, especially polyuria. Experience indicates that a dramatic decrease in 2 to 3 hour-post-trilostane ACTH stimulation (ACTHS) serum cortisol concentration (scc) may fail to correlate with resolution of polyuria in some dogs. Persistent polyuria does appear to correlate with persistently abnormal urine cortisol creatinine ratio (UCCR) results from urine samples obtained by owners at home prior to administering trilostane. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the duration of action of trilostane after morning administration. For inclusion, each dog must have had clinical signs and routine biochemistry changes consistent with HC. Each dog must have had the diagnosis of HC supported with at least one abnormal HC screening test result (ACTHS; UCCR; or low dose dexamethasone test). After at least 5 weeks of once daily trilostane treatment, owners were instructed to treat their dog with trilostane in the morning and bring their dog to our hospital for ACTHS test 2 to 3 hours and again 8 to 10 hours later (Group I). Some owners were instructed to bring their dog to our hospital 8 to 10 hours after trilostane administration and then again 2 to 3 hours after trilostane administration the following morning (Group II). ACTH stimulation was performed by obtaining blood, administering 0.25 mg Cortrosyn IM and obtaining a second blood sample one hour later. Data is presented as mean 6 SD; all scc are in mg/dl; significance was defined as a P , 0.05. 20 dogs met the criteria for inclusion with 12 dogs in Group I and 8 dogs in Group II. There was no significant difference comparing results between Group I and Group II, therefore results were grouped. For all 20 dogs, the 2hour post-trilostane basal scc was 2.5 61.6 and the post-ACTHS scc was 3.2 61.7. For all 20 dogs the 8-hour post-trilostane basal scc was 3.3 61.7 and the post ACTHS scc was 6.6 63.3. If the goal in therapy was a post-ACTHS scc at 2 hours post-trilostane between 1.5 and 5.5, 15 dogs met that criterion, 3 had results ,1.5 and 2 had results .5.5 (range 0.3 to 7.1). If those same criteria are used for the 8-hour post-trilostane test, 4 dogs had scc between 1.5 and 5.5; 2 had scc ,1.5 and 14 had scc .5.5 (range 0.8-11.3). The 2-hour post-trilostane post-ACTHS result was not significantly different from the 8hour post trilostane basal scc. The 8-hour post trilostane post-ACTHS scc was significantly higher than the 2-hour post ACTHS result. 14 dogs had higher basal scc at 8-hours post trilostane than the post-ACTHS scc at 2 hours post-trilostane. 17 of 20 dogs had higher scc results post-ACTHS at the 8-hour post-Rx than at the 2-hour post-Rx.",

Hyperphosphatemia has a negative impact in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In human beings, hyperphosphatemia decrease quality of life and increase the risk of mortality. Moreover, phosphorus retention occurs early in the course of the disease, even before the serum phosphorus concentration is elevated over the laboratory reference values. In dogs and cats with an experimental reduction of the kidney functional mass, progression the disease is directly related to serum phosphorus concentration. Despite these facts, prevalence of hyperphosphatemia in large populations of animals with natural CKD according to severity of the disease has not been previously reported. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia in a group of dogs with CKD at the different stages of the IRIS staging scheme using leishmaniasis as a natural model of CKD.",

Recent outbreaks of equine herpes virus (EHV) infections in horses have stimulated interest in effective antiherpetic drugs for the prophylaxis and treatment of EHV. EHV-1 isolates appear to vary in their sensitivity to acyclovir (ACV), with reported in vitro inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) ranging from 0.3-7 mg/mL, with a median of 1-2 mg/mL. As human studies indicate that ACV concentrations should remain above the IC 50 for at least K of the dosing interval, serum ACV concentrations exceeding 1-2 mg/mL serve as an appropriate preliminary target for EHV in horses.",

            "text": "Based on previously published in vitro susceptibility patterns of EHV isolates to acyclovir, orally administered acyclovir may only be effective against highly susceptible strains of EHV. In contrast, the higher serum acyclovir concentrations obtained from valacylovir administration are more likely to be effective against EHV infections in horses. Sustained administration of dexamethasone results in insulin resistance in the horse which may predispose the horse to laminitis, especially in horses suspected to have Cushing's disease and/or a history of laminitis. The objectives of this research were to determine whether and to what extent a single suppressive dose of dexamethasone, as used in endocrine testing of Cushing's disease, may affect glucose homeostasis and to characterize the intravenous combined glucose-insulin test (IVCGIT) profile caused by dexamethasone in order to assist in the development of interpretation guidelines for the IVCGIT. The IVCGIT (AJVR 66:1598 (AJVR 66: -1604 (AJVR 66: , 2005 ) is a recently developed clinical test that combines two well-known procedures: glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests in an effort to enhance diagnostic information and circumvent the technical complexity of more elaborate testing. Six clinically healthy adult geldings of various breeds were given an intravenous combined glucose (150 mg/kg), insulin (0.10 U/kg) test via a pre-placed jugular catheter. Blood glucose was determined (by a handheld glucometer) in samples collected at 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150 min. (insulin and cortisol were determined in selected samples). After the initial IVCGIT the horses were administered dexamethasone (40 ug/kg, IV), and the IVCGIT was repeated 24 h later. Subsequently, the IVCGIT was repeated at 2 h and 72 h post dexamethasone with at least 4 weeks between experiments. The IVCGIT successfully detected, through changes in the positive (hyperglycemia) and negative (hypoglycemia) phases, that glucose homeostasis was disrupted by dexamethasone in three ways: (1) at 2 h, dexamethasone shortened the ascending branch of the negative phase (P,0.0001) of the test which suggests moderate and non-genomic antiinsulin effect; (2) at 24 h, dexamethasone caused a clear diabetogenic effect by both extending the positive phase and eliminating the negative phase of the test while insulin was elevated, which suggest a marked insulin resistance; and (3) at 72 h, dexamethasone caused both a left-shift of the negative phase of the test and a deeper nadir (P,0.0001) value compared to controls, which suggest increased sensitivity to insulin. Increased sensitivity to insulin 72 h post-dexamethasone is paradoxical, and to our knowledge this is the first time it has been reported. In theory, the above information suggests that one dose of dexamethasone may act as a physiological trigger for laminitis in horses at high risk. However, the 72 h compensatory increase insulin sensitivity found in this work, may contribute to cancel out the anti-insulin effects developed at 24 h post-dexamethasone. This may explain in part, why a single dose of dexamethasone as used in endocrine testing is unlikely to result in laminitis in contrast with long-term dexamethasone administration. Nutritional supplementation of horses receiving prolonged intravenous fluid support, generally in the form of total parenteral nutrition, is becoming a more common practice in many equine hospitals. However, in horses with an adequate fat mass it is likely that partial parenteral nutritional support, through addition of dextrose to a polyionic fluid, may be all the additional energy that is required during a 5-10 day of reduced feed intake. To investigate the effects of dextrose supplementation, glucose, triglyceride, and insulin concentrations and glycogen content of hepatic and skeletal muscle were compared in 6 horses that were deprived of feed and water while supported with three fluids (1.5 ml/kg/h) with varying ionic composition and energy content (Normosol-R2 Abbot [R], Normosol-M2 Abbot [M, 50 g/l dextrose], and modified Normosol-M2 [M+, 68 g/l dextrose] supplemented with additional dextrose, potassium chloride, potassium acetate, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate). The experiment was a randomized crossover design. Glucose, triglyceride, and insulin concentrations were measured daily for a 3 d baseline period (with hay and water intake), during a 5 d period of feed and water deprivation (fluid infusion period), and during a 3 d recovery period (with hay and water intake). Glycogen content of muscle (middle gluteal) and liver were determined in biopsy samples collected during the baseline period and the final day of the fluid infusion. Glucose and insulin concentrations increased significantly during the infusion period with M and M+ but remained unchanged from the baseline period with R. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the increases between M and M+ but glucosuria was detected on five infusion days with M+ as compared to only once with M. In contrast, triglyceride concentrations increased significantly with R but remained unchanged with M or M+. By the end of the infusion period, liver glycogen content increased by 30% and 47% with M and M+, respectively, but decreased by 86% with R. Changes in muscle glycogen content were not detected. In conclusion, although insulin secretion and tissue glucose uptake were increased with both the 5% (M, 75 mg/kg/h) and 6.8% (M+, 102 mg/kg/h) dextrose solutions, they were inadequate to prevent mild to moderate hyperglycemia and glucosuria. However, both dextrose-containing solutions were effective in preventing an increase in triglyceride concentration during a period of food deprivation. Due to the variable rate at which intravenous fluid products are administered to hospitalized horses, it is unlikely that a standardized dextrose concentration can be recommended for inclusion in a maintenance fluid for horses. Insulin resistance (IR) may predispose horses to laminitis by compromising glucose delivery to hoof tissues. Endotoxemia has been anecdotally associated with laminitis and is a systemic condition that could affect insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that a low-dose intravenous endotoxin challenge would induce transient IR in horses. Sixteen adult mares were evaluated and each mare received one treatment per week for 2 weeks according to a random order. Treatments consisted of 20 ng/kg body weight Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered intravenously over a 30-minute period in 50 mL sterile saline (treatment) or sterile saline alone (control). Frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) procedures were performed at 224 h, 24 h, and 48 h, and data were assessed by minimal model analysis. Responses to LPS or saline over time were compared by repeated measures ANOVA.",

Results of this study provide evidence that endotoxemia induces IR in horses. Increased somnolence has been reported in horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), however the pathologic mechanism for this is unknown. Hypocretin-1 is a neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus that is involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Injection of hypocretin-1 into the ventricles of awake animals produces longer duration of wakefulness. Ablation of hypocretin-1 yields animals with increased sleep time and narcolepsy. Loss of hypocretin-1 containing neurons and decreased hypocretin-1 concentration is observed in humans with narcolepsy and other neurodegenerative diseases in which sleep cycle is disrupted. We hypothesize that horses with PPID have a deficiency in hypocretin-1 that contributes to somnolence.",

This included 2 weeks acclimation, a high concentrate (4 kg/d), high roughage (5 kg alfalfa hay/d) diet for 4 weeks, followed by a high concentrate (5 kg/d), low roughage (3 kg alfalfa hay/d) diet for 4 weeks. The horses were then turned out to pasture in a herd for 6 weeks (20 acres, tropical and native grass mix). Horses were exercised on a horsewalker at a walk and trot 5 days a week for a total of 30 minutes from week 0 to 10. Gastroscopy was performed and recorded on video at the beginning of the study (week 0) then every 2 weeks throughout the study (16 weeks). Gastric ulcers were scored from the videos on lesion number (0-4 scale) and severity (0-5 scale) by 2 people blinded to each other and the horse. 11/12 horses developed lesions on the high concentrate diet. Lesions increased in severity score (SS) from week 0 (mean SS 0.54) to week 8 (mean SS 2.83) (P,0.001), with the increase evident from week 2 (P,0.05).

Further, healthy horses do not appear to shed L. intracellularis in feces. The role of diseased foals in the transmission of PE remains to be investigated. Based on molecular detection of L. intracellularis in feces, domestic and wild animals represent possible sources of infection for resident horses. Myocardial degeneration, as documented by serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) has been reported in the presence of septicemia in foals, human adults and children. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether endotoxemia in the equine adult with intestinal ischemia resulted in myocardial degeneration; specifically whether cTnI concentrations were increased in animals with surgical colic and whether any increases correlated with endotoxin concentrations (ETx) or other factors. Thirty horses requiring surgery (sx) for correction of small intestinal strangulating lesions were included in the study. Parameters recorded at admission, post-sx and 24, 32 and 56 h post-SX included: heart rate, packed cell volume, total protein and blood lactate concentrations, serum concentrations of ETx and cTnI and serum activities of creatine kinase (CK) were determined. Differences in serum ETx and cTnI were determined using multivariate ANOVA. Selected data is displayed in the table below as mean6 standard deviation. Serum concentrations of ETx were only outside the reference range for three horses and only at one time point whereas mean cTnI concentrations were above the normal range at all time points. There were significant associations with: lactate concentrations at admission and cTnI 24 h post-sx (p50.001), and lactate concentrations post-sx and cTnI at admission (p50.001), 24 h (p50.035), 32 h (p50.012) and 56 h post-sx (p50.029). In addition, there were significant associations between lactate and CK at admission (p50.027). In conclusion, there is an increase in cTnI in this group of surgical colic patients, even though majority of these animals do not have detectable circulating ETx. However there is a significant association between lactate concentrations and cTnI and therefore hypoperfusion may lead to ischemic myocardial degeneration. The association between lactate concentrations and CK may be a reflection of the time and severity of colic signs. The increase in serum concentrations of cTnI in horses undergoing colic sx in animals without apparent cardiac disease should be considered when evaluating suspected cardiac disease in these individuals. Serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is considered the gold standard biochemical test for diagnosis of myocardial damage in humans. An accurate on-site point of care test for cTnI would greatly improve our evaluation of myocardial injury in horses. Our hypotheses were that cTnI will be a reliable biomarker of toxin-induced cardiac injury and will increase following administration of an established sublethal dose of monensin. This will allow us to 1) determine if a known cardiac insult causes an increase in cTnI concentration in the horse; 2) determine if this point of care analyzer will detect plasma cTnI and compare i-STATH 1 values to those obtained by bench testing [ACCESSH-immunoassay, (serum),] and 3) compare serum versus plasma for evaluating cTnI.",

Diets to help prevent or manage canine obesity should ideally reduce calorie intake while providing satiety. Increased dietary fiber has been studied in weight loss diet formulas but the effects of digestible carbohydrate types including high vs. low glycemic index varieties have not. Also reduced fat formulas have been employed but less is known about the type and form of dietary fats used. The present study investigated metabolic effects of diacylglycerol-rich vegetable oil (DAG) vs. triacylglycerol oil (TAG) in combination with high (HGI) and low (LGI) glycemic index starches in obese dogs during weight loss. Twelve obese adult, female beagles with body condition scores of 8.460.1 (SEM)/9 and 48.963.3% body fat (SEM) were randomly divided into 4 groups. Four diets were formulated containing poultry by-product meal, DAG or TAG oil, low-(LGI, high amylose corn) or high-(HGI, waxy corn) glycemic index starch, and vitamin/mineral premix (ca. 4200 kcal/kg DM). After acclimation to a similar gruel-based diet, the experimental diets were fed mixed with water as a gruel for 9 wk (n53 per group). Dogs were offered the equivalent calories each day to maintain their starting obese body weights, weighed weekly, and food consumption recorded daily. After weight loss, obesity was re-induced over 10 weeks, dogs assigned to the diet with exactly the opposite fat and starch source, and the study repeated. Digestibilites of the diets were determined during wk 3 of each period. On wks 1 and 8, post-prandial blood samples were collected via jugular catheter after feeding a test meal with cooked chicken breast meat in place of poultry by-product meal in the diet mixture. Plasma was obtained; insulin, triglyceride, b-hydroxy buyrate (b-HB), glucose, and non-esterifed fatty acids (NEFA) were determined. The dogs consumed 6864 (SEM)% of diet offered and all dogs lost weight and relative % body fat. All groups consumed similar amounts of food on a dry matter basis, but dogs fed the LGI diets lost a larger percentage of their starting body weights: 2% per week for the LGI groups vs 1% for HGI (p , 0.05). This was due to statistically significant differences in carbohydrate and total digestibilities of the LGI vs HGI diets. Plasma glucose was similar in all groups but insulin concentrations were significantly lower in the LGI groups compared to HGI (p , 0.05); NEFA were also increased with LGI. DAG effects included decreased post-prandial plasma triacylglycerol (TG) and increased beta-hydroxy butyrate vs TAG. These findings support the possibility of less TG entering the bloodstream after eating (DAG effect) with increased relative amounts of NEFA made available in a lower insulin environment (LGI effect) while maintaining glucose homeostasis Increased b-HB reflects increased b-oxidation of fatty acids after eating (DAG effect). These DAG effects combined with the LGI effects of lower digestibility, increased rates of weight loss, effective loss of % body fat, and improved insulin response, demonstrate that the DAG/LGI combination is preferred over the other diets studied for canine weight loss. Obesity and diabetes mellitus are suggested eventual consequences of feeding cats dry-type (extruded) diets, which typically contain , 40% carbohydrate by weight. To evaluate validity of this, body fat mass, insulin sensitivity, and first-and late-phase insulin responses were determined in young (, 3 years) and older (. 3 years) sexually-intact cats in closedcolonies where principally dry-type (25 females) or canned-type (, 10% carbohydrate, 10 females & 8 males) diets were fed. Increasing body fat and changes toward a diabetic insulin profile with age were hypothesized for cats chronically given dry diets for ad libitum consumption.",

The gain in body fat appears to have a greater impact than long-term consumption of ''high'' carbohydrate diets on reducing insulin sensitivity and producing a ''prediabetic'' plasma insulin response to an intravenous glucose load. The glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) described in dogs closely resembles (genetically and clinically) the human GSD-Ia. GSD-Ia human and canine patients have a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, a key enzyme catalyzing the formation of glucose from glycogen. Affected and untreated dogs show chronic hypoglycemia, lethargy, growth retardation, coma, and death at early age. A published study employing gene therapy with an adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) vector resulted in successful delivery of the canine glucose-6-phosphatase gene into the liver of 3 affected pups treated at 3 or 4 days of age, however, clinical and biochemical correction following vector administration was moderate and all 3 pups eventually died of complications of GSD-Ia at few months of age (ranging from 20 to 86 days of life). They were all under intensive nutritional management to provide glucose or cornstarch several times daily. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of an AAV2 vector crosspackaged as AAV8 (AAV2/8 vector) (n 5 3) encoding human glucose-6phosphatase (G6Pase), and a helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) vector (n 5 1) encoding canine G6Pase. The vectors were administered to Maltese-Beagle cross canine pups at 3 days of age born to carrier bitches that were artificially inseminated using carrier males. All 3 pups treated with the AAV2/8 vector and 1 pup treated with the HDAd vector responded very well within the first week following vector administration and have required minimal clinical attention; no special nutritional therapy has been given and they all show biochemical correction of hypoglycemia after 2 hour fasting and normal liver function parameters. Three other pups were treated with a different AAV2/8 vector conferring partial efficacy; 1 died at 28 days of life, and the other 2 were kept alive with intensive nutritional care accompanied by glucose injections as needed and regular feeding with cornstarch via a gastric tube. The latter two pups were first administered an AAV2/1 vector, and then were subsequently treated with the HDAd vector.

These risks should be considered carefully when using these catheters, particularly in diabetic patients. feG-COOH, an immunomodulating tripeptide released from the submandibular gland in response to autonomic stimulation, has been shown to decrease allergen-induced airway inflammation in murine models of asthma. We hypothesized that feG-COOH would decrease allergen-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation in experimental feline asthma. In a small pilot study, four adult cats were sensitized to Bermuda grass allergen (BGA) to induce an asthmatic phenotype. The cats were then randomized in a crossover design to receive either feG-COOH (1 mg/kg, PO) or placebo (saline 0.1 ml/kg, PO) immediately prior to BGA aerosol challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 24 hours after challenge and differential cell counts were performed on cytospins stained with a modified Wright's stain. There was a 10-day washout period before crossover to the other treatment. A paired t-test was used to compare differential BALF cell counts between the feG-COOH and placebo treatment groups. A p-value of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. The group mean percent BALF eosinophils (feG, 2764%; placebo, 41611% p50.039) was significantly lower after feG treatment compared to placebo. There was a concomitant significant increase in the feG group mean BALF macrophage percentage (feG, 6469%; placebo, 51610% p50.012), but not in the group mean percent BALF neutrophils (feG, 965%; placebo, 865% p50.841) in the feG group. These data indicate that feG-COOH partially attenuates eosinophilic airway inflammation in an experimental model of feline asthma. Further study in larger numbers of cats is warranted before determining if feG-COOH would be beneficial in the treatment of naturally occurring asthma in cats. Nasal aspergillosis is a common cause of chronic nasal discharge. Diagnosis is based on a combination of computed tomography, rhinoscopy, histopathology, tissue fungal culture, and serology. The most commonly used treatment is application of topical antifungal medication such as clotrimazole or enilconazole. Clinical success rates for cure of nasal aspergillosis reported previously for clotrimazole infusion were 65% with one treatment and 87% with multiple treatments. The aim of this study was to determine the success rate of topical clotrimazole in dogs with nasal aspergillosis using follow-up rhinoscopic evaluation to confirm efficacy of treatment.",

Measurement of B-type Natriuretic Peptide concentrations (BNP) is helpful in distinguishing cardiac from non cardiac cause of dyspnea in humans.

An initial dosing protocol of 2-4 mg/kg PO q 24 hrs appears to be adequate for clinical platelet inhibition in the dog. An oral loading dose of no more than 10 mg/kg should provide sufficient maximal platelet inhibition by 90 minutes which persists for 24 hours. It is interesting to note that the platelet-inhibitive response appeared to increase with repeated dosing, suggesting that a dose of 1 mg/kg is adequate with repeated dosing in dogs. This may reflect activation of the hepatic enzymes responsible for the conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. There were no adverse effects noted during any dose trial during the study. Clopidogrel (PlavixH) is a potent antiplatelet drug that requires conversion of the parent compound to an active metabolite through hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 CYP3A enzymes. Rifampin has been shown to be a strong inducer of the hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP3A12 enzyme in canine hepatocytes while cimetidine exhibits weak inhibition. This study evaluated the effect of rifampin and cimetidine therapy indirectly on clopidogrel metabolism by measuring the change in platelet inhibition as determined by whole-blood platelet aggregation.",

Feline SAA is a minimally responsive protein in FIBD in contrast to AGP and HAP. Elevations in HAP and AGP following therapy of FIBD may be attributable to exogenous glucocorticoid administration. The lack of concordance between serum APP and clinical scores of FIBD suggests that they may not be suitable laboratory markers of disease activity. Increased serum APP before therapy may aid in the diagnosis of FRE. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in humans and mice is thought to result from a dysregulated interaction between the host immune system and its commensal microflora. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns on microbes and ligand recognition results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, upregulation of costimulatory molecules, and synthesis of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. The purpose of this study was to determine the mRNA expression of canine TLR2, 4 and 9 in healthy intestine and to test the hypothesis, that there is a dysregulation of these TLRs in the intestine of dogs with IBD.",

The lower expression of these TLRs in the healthy bacterial-enriched colon compared to the duodenum supports this hypothesis. The absence of significant changes after therapy despite clinical improvement might point towards genetical predisposition for IBD in dogs as already known from human patients. Evidence for concurrent chronic pancreatitis (CP) is reported in approximately 2% of human patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the actual frequency could be much higher since concurrent chronic pancreatitis may be subclinical. The prevalence and characteristics of concurrent CP in dogs with IBD has not been reported in the literature.

Also, findings from this study suggest that both the prevalence and severity of hypertriglyceridemia increase with age. The number of reported adverse side effects associated with NSAID use far exceeds any other companion animal drug. Despite ongoing research to improve NSAID safety (COX-2 selective inhibition, COX/LOX inhibition) gastro-intestinal side effects still occur. The role of COX-2 in pyloric and duodenal mucosa is unknown in canines, as is the effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors on its function. In canine whole blood, carprofen is approximately 3-5 fold selective, and deracoxib in excess of 36-fold selective, for COX-2. The hypothesis that COX-2 protein is constitutively expressed in pyloric and duodenal mucosa and its inhibition by a selective COX-2 inhibitor has less effect on prostanoid production compared to non-selective NSAIDs was investigated. This study was a randomized, placebo controlled, blinded, cross-over design. Eight purpose bred mongrel dogs (8-13 kg) were used.

We compared portal blood flow between 3D-CTP and portography after temporal shunt vessel ligation (P-ATSVL) and categorized them into 4 patterns according to surgical implications in 35 congenital extrahepatic PSS dogs. Pattern 1 (P1) were rich intrahepatic portal blood flow (IHPBF) on 3D-CTP and P-ATSVL; P2 were cases of poor IHPBF on 3D-CTP, however, rich IHPBF on P-ATSVL; P3 were cases of very poor IHPBF on 3D-CTP and P-ATSVL ; P4 were cases of very poor IHPBF and poor hepatic vein blood flow on 3D-CTP. Patterns and clinical implications in 35 PSS dogs are summarized in the Table. P1 is clinically and surgically an excellent group which does not create any problems. Portal blood flow is well maintained in this pattern especially shunt vessel run along diaphragm. P2 develops portal vasculature which receives suddenly increased portal blood flow after shunt vessel manipulation (hypoperfusion) and severe hypoglycemic episode occurred. Since the sustained severe hypoglycemic episode would be the genesis of post ligation seizure syndrome, aggressive therapy to maintain normal blood glucose level. P3 has variable portal vasculature development and has relatively higher hepatic vascular resistance and cellophane bandage or partial ligation methods were utilized. Partial ligation requires 2 nd or 3 rd operation 2-3 month later for complete ligation. P4 demonstrating almost none hepatic venous blood flow. These cases experience severe clinical symptoms and surgical attenuation is difficult since we lost 2/3 after the surgical attenuation of the shunt. Tramadol and its metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1) have centrallyacting analgesic properties that are attributed to opiate receptor effects and inhibition of the re-uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Its pharmacokinetics have been published for dogs, but only reported in cats after IV administration as an abstract. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and the active metabolite M1 in cats after oral administration. Eight cats (4 males, 4 females) were used for single dose administration. After an oral dose of 4 mg/kg of an immediate-release tablet, plasma samples were collected at regular intervals for 36 hours. Plasma was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for tramadol and the M1 metabolite. Tramadol was generally well-tolerated except that it was observed to be unpalatable.

Practitioners considering use of tramadol in cats should be aware of potential neurologic adverse effects. Of the newer, selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), there is limited research in cats. In many species, including man, dogs, and rats, inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity while sparing cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) has been shown to decrease inflammatory mediators and signs, with a much improved gastrointestinal toxicity profile. One method of assessment of NSAID is determining the relative ratio of isoenzyme (COX-1 & COX-2) inhibition at different concentrations of drug. In vitro whole blood assays have become the gold standard for this evaluation. Data generated directly from the target species is paramount as species variability in drug activity has been reported.

The pharmacokinetics have been published for dogs, but only for an immediate release tablet that produced rapid absorption and clearance. An extended-release tramadol tablet (ULTRAMH ER) is available for use once-daily in people. The release of active drug is controlled in the gastrointestinal tract by using a barrier coating. To examine whether these tablets would perform similarly in dogs, the absorption and plasma profile of ULTRAMH ER tablets were examined in dogs. The in vivo absorption profile was compared with in vitro dissolution analysis of ULTRAMH ER tablets.

Dissolution was complete by 24 hours under these conditions. When tablets were broken into 4 pieces to mimic chewing by a dog after administration, 98% release occurred within 30 minutes. This rapid release could lead to potential toxicity. Except for early time points, there was excellent in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) between in vitro release of the tablets and the plasma concentration profile in dogs. This indicates that the plasma profile of ULTRAMH ER tablets in dogs is controlled by the release of the tablets in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs. However, an ER tablet based on a barrier coating for release control may potentially cause a catastrophic drug dumping if chewed by dogs. Other ER formulations such as a matrix tablet may be more chew-resistant.

            "text": "Integrated PK-PD modeling of MOR provided a high correlation between the observed and predicted antinociceptive effect of MOR. An advantage of the indirect response model is that the effect does not have to be directly related with the plasma concentration. Previous studies have demonstrated that a lag for MOR penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs, as well as a lag for the elimination of MOR from the CSF in dogs. Previous PD models related the effect of MOR to plasma concentrations with a lower correlation (r 2 50.92) compared to the indirect response model. Cephalexin and cefpodoxime are two oral cephalosporins frequently prescribed for treating skin and soft tissue infections in dogs. Cefpodoxime proxetil (Simplicef) is registered for once-daily administration and cephalexin (generic) is usually prescribed for twice-daily administration. This study compared plasma concentrations, protein binding and free (unbound) tissue concentrations in dogs after oral administration. Determination of free (protein unbound) drug concentrations in the interstitial fluid (ISF)the site of most bacterial infections -was done to assess whether dosing regimens are meeting targeted concentrations. In vivo ultrafiltration was used to collect tissue fluid because of several advantages over tissue cages or tissue homogenates. After placing ultrafiltration probes for collecting interstitial fluid (ISF) and jugular catheters for collecting plasma, 6 dogs were administered cephalexin (mean dose 25 mg/kg) and cefpodoxime proxetil (mean cefpodoxime dose 9.6 mg/kg) orally in a crossover design with at least one-week washout between crossovers. Plasma and tissue fluid were collected for 48 hours and analyzed for each drug using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Protein binding of each drug in pooled canine plasma was measured using microcentrifugation. The tissue probes were well tolerated and reliably produced fluid from tissue that could be collected every two hours. The protein binding for cefpodoxime varied from 82% to as high as 91%, except at the high concentration (30 mg/mL) where it was 66%. Thus, the free drug fraction (fu) ranged from 0.34 to 0.09 (mean fu was 0.17). The protein binding for cephalexin was 26% and 16% at low and high concentrations, respectively, representing a fu of 0.74 and 0.84, respectively. For cephalexin, the peak plasma concentration (C MAX ) was 31.5 (611.5)mg/mL, area-under-the-curve (AUC) 155.6 (629.5)mg hr/mL, and terminal half-life (tK) was 4.7 (61.2) hr. The corresponding values for the free (unbound) cephalexin in the ISF were 16.3 (65.8) mg/mL, 87.8 (621.0) mg hr/mL, and 3.2 (6 0.6) hr. For cefpodoxime the C MAX was 33.0 (66.9) mg/mL, AUC 282.8 (644.0) mg hr/mL, and tK 5.7 (60.9) hr. The corresponding values for the free cefpodoxime in the ISF were 4.3 (62.0) mg/ mL, 57.5 (617.4) mg hr/mL, and 10.4 (63.3) hr. The tissue penetration factor was 0.58 (60.17) and 0.20 (60.06) for cephalexin and cefpodoxime, respectively. For cefpodoxime, the ISF unbound (active) drug concentrations were maintained above the MIC 90 for E. coli and Staphylococcus for approximately 24 hours. For cephalexin, these concentrations were maintained above the MIC 90 for Staphylococcus for approximately 14 hours and did not reach the MIC 90 for E. coli at any time. We conclude that free (active) drug in tissue was similar to the free plasma drug concentration for cefpodoxime, but for cephalexin, free (active) drug in tissue was lower than free drug in plasma. In addition, we found that active drug concentrations are maintained in tissues longer for cefpodoxime than for cephalexin. Antipyrine (AP) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that distributes to total body fluid, is not highly protein bound, and is used as a marker drug for cytochrome P-450 (CYP) mediated oxidative metabolism. Inulin is a polysaccharide that distributes to extracellular fluid, is not highly protein bound, and is eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration. The purpose of this study was to compare the oxidative metabolism, glomerular filtration rate, and extracellular and total body fluid content of Beagles and Greyhounds as determined by the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the marker drugs antipyrine and inulin.",

The extracellular fluid volume was similar between the two dog breeds, but the total body fluid content was significantly larger in Greyhounds. The larger total body fluid content in Greyhounds may be due to the larger muscle mass as compared to Beagles.

Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) has recently caused several devastating neurological outbreaks associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early identification of equine patients with herpes-virus induced encephalomyelitis is imperative to prevent transmission. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting EHV-1 in blood samples, but the relatively limited duration of EHV-1 viremia following infection and degradation of the sample during transport necessitates application of this method to testing of cell-free nasal swabs. The purpose of our study was to (1) perform qPCR on nasal swab samples and normalize EHV-1 copy numbers to control for DNA purification efficiency, (2) determine the sensitivity and specificity of qPCR versus viral isolation (VI) on nasal swabs and (3) compare the duration of viral shedding as detected by PCR and VI.",

Intravenous fluid support is an integral component to the practice of high quality equine medicine and surgery. However, all commercially available fluid products packaged in volumes greater than 1 liter are designed as replacement fluids with an ionic composition similar to extracellular fluid. That is, they are high in sodium (Na + ) and low in potassium (K + ) and provide no nutritive value. After initial replacement of fluid deficits, continued use of replacement fluid products delivers an excessive Na + load and can exacerbate total body K + deficit. A commercial fluid product designed for maintenance needs and packaged in 5-liter bags is needed in equine medicine. In an attempt to design such a maintenance fluid for horses, we compared water and electrolyte balance in 6 horses that were deprived of feed and water while supported with three fluids (1.5 ml/kg/h) with varying ionic composition and energy content (Normosol-R2 Abbot [R], Normosol-M2 Abbot [M] , and modified Normosol-M2 [M+] supplemented with additional dextrose, potassium chloride, potassium acetate, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate). The experiment was a randomized crossover design. Clinical hydration status, body mass (BM), and water and electrolyte balance were measured daily for a 3 d baseline period (with hay and water intake), during a 5 d period of feed and water deprivation (fluid infusion period), and during a 3 d recovery period (with hay and water intake). Horses experienced a 3-9% BM loss during the fluid infusion period and several developed mild diarrhea from day 3-5 of the infusion period; however, clinical examination revealed normal hydration status in all horses during all infusion periods. Of interest, no horse drank water when it was offered once daily during each infusion period. Although there were mild variations in plasma electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance with the different treatments, none were significant. However, both urine and fecal Na + and chloride (Cl 2 ) excretion were significantly greater with R than with M or M+. All horses experienced a negative K + balance during infusion with all fluid products but the magnitude of the estimated K + deficit was less with M or M+ than with R. Increased urine output with hyposthenuria was seen in all horses with all fluids but urinary losses of calcium and magnesium were attenuated with M+ as compared to R or M.",

Thus, development of a maintenance fluid for use in horses requires an ionic composition that is currently unavailable in any commercial product. Fat metabolism predominates over glycogen metabolism during prolonged low-intensity exercise; however, some glycogen is continuously utilized with aerobic exercise in order to provide oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle (CAC). Without adequate oxaloacetate, depletion of CAC intermediates occurs and generation of ATP by either fat or glycogen is impaired contributing to fatigue. A novel odd chain synthetic fat, triheptanoin, (C7) generates acetyl-CoA (C2) and propionyl-CoA (C3) that can replenish the CAC by providing succinyl-CoA. We hypothesized that provision of C7, in comparison to corn oil (C18) in the diet would provide C3 that could enter the CAC and attenuate energy depletion in skeletal muscle during sub-maximal exercise. Eight fit Thoroughbred horses consumed a 23 MCal/day diet consisting of ration balancer and grass hay and 650 mls of either C7 or C18 for 14 days in a randomized crossover design. Muscle biopsies were obtained pre, post and 24 h after a 90 min submaximal exercise test for each diet. Prior to exercise, dosing horses with triheptanoin resulted in increased plasma [ Feeding triheptanoin increases plasma insulin, C7, C5 and C3, however, during exercise, this did not appear to have a detectible effect on muscle substrate and metabolite concentrations. In the recovery period, enhanced muscle glucose uptake and an expansion of the pool of CAC intermediates was suggested by higher muscle [glucose-6-phosphate] and [citrate] in horses fed triheptanoin compared to corn oil. Since horses are well known to have extremely slow glycogen repletion following exhaustive exercise, triheptanoin's potential effect on muscle gluconeogenesis and glycogen repletion warrants further study. Horses with polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) develop exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) and a deficit in energy generation during short-term aerobic exercise. We hypothesized that repeated rhabdomyolysis may result in loss of citric acid cycle (CAC) intermediates further disrupting energy generation. Repletion of CAC intermediates could be accomplished by provision of a synthetic odd carbon fat called triheptanoin (C7) that would replenish CAC cycle intermediates by generating both acetyl CoA (C2) and propionyl-CoA (C3), which enters the CAC as succinyl-CoA. Traditional management of PSSM involves decreasing starch intake and provision of even chain fat (primarily linoleic C18) that undergo beta oxidation entering the CAC as C2. A low starch, fat enriched diet decreases ER in PSSM horses as indicated by lower serum creatine kinase activity (CK). The purpose of this study was to determine whether feeding C7 as a source of dietary fat to PSSM horses would decrease serum CK activity following submaximal exercise more effectively than corn oil (C18). Initially, we gave fasted PSSM horses 0.5 gm/kg of triheptanoin via nasogastric tube and demonstrated peak plasma C7 [acylcarnitine] occurred 90 min and peak plasma C5 and C3",

An individual exercise regime was first established for each horse while horses were fed 0.05 MCal/kg/day diet consisting of sweet feed/rice bran and grass hay. Horses exercised 5 days per week for 3 weeks on each diet with 1 week wash out period between diets. Blood samples were obtained 4 h after exercise for measurement of serum CK activity and acylcarnitines. Muscle biopsies were obtained pre and post exercise on the last day of each diet. All horses completed their daily exercise regime on the C18 diet with declining CK activities over the diet period. 3/8 horses were unable to complete their daily exercise regime on C7 due to muscle pain and stiffness. Mean serum CK activities were higher on C7 (4,9406626 U/L) vs. C18 (767697 U/L) and grain (2,4616418 U/L). Both C7 and C18 increase plasma [acylcarnitines], however C18 decreases and C7 increases plasma insulin concentrations. Therefore, the beneficial effect of C18 on serum CK activity may not be related to provision of fat as an energy substrate. Rather, the detrimental effect of C7 on ER in PSSM horses may have been due to increased glucose uptake and formation of gluconeogenic precursors in skeletal muscle, further dysregulating cellular energy metabolism. Further analysis of muscle substrates and metabolism in these horses will test this supposition. Adoption of retired racing Greyhounds has become increasingly popular over the past decade. To date, research has focused on the physiologic and hematologic peculiarities of Greyhounds but there is little published data discussing disease prevalence in the breed. Some diseases are thought to be common in the breed, such as tick-born illness and hypothyroidism, but no scientific data have ever been used to confirm the relevance of these ''common diseases''.

There were 392 females (51.4%) and 370 males (48.6%), with a median age of 8 years (range 2 to 11 years). The 4 most prevalent causes of death reported were cancer (57.4%); other causes (20%), mainly orthopedic problems; kidney disease; and bleeding disorders (7.8% each). In addition, 12.9% (n594) of the Greyhounds (both alive and deceased) had at least one form of cancer; 42% had osteosarcoma (OSA). In addition, 32.6% (n5239) of the dogs were described as being diagnosed with another bone disease such as osteoarthritis (OA), fractures, or racing injuries. Of these, 55% (n5131) had been diagnosed with OA. Other prevalent diseases reported were skin diseases (28.1%), such as bald thighs (59%) and corns (21%); endocrine diseases (11.8%), with hypothyroidism (93%) listed as the most common disease. Tick-born diseases represented 6.6% of the responses; Babesia canis infections was most common. Finally, bleeding problems accounted for 3.3% of the responses, and ''strokes'' was listed as the most common problem.",

Breed health surveys are commonly utilized to study disease prevalence in a subpopulation of dogs. A criticism of these surveys is that most are convenience-based (not a random sample of the population) and owner-answered questions. The current survey, although answered by owners was randomly selected from a group of owners that spanned the entire country. As a follow up, veterinary records are being used to confirm answers. The gain-of-function mutations within c-kit, a protooncogene encoding KIT, induce constitutive ligand-independent kinase activation and play important roles in the pathogenesis of mast cell proliferative disease in humans as well as in dogs. In cats, mutations within c-kit gene have been scarcely studied despite the clinical importance of mast cell tumor (MCT). Recently, we reported a feline MCT case harboring mutation of 12-bp internal tandem duplication (ITD) in c-kit exon 8, which encodes the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of KIT. The tumor responded to the kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, suggesting the contribution of the mutation in the neoplastic transformation of the mast cells by enhancing KIT phosphorylation. In the present study, we examined c-kit exon 8 mutation in 13 feline MCT cases.",

Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common nonhematopoietic feline hepatic neoplasm. It is locally aggressive with a high metastatic rate and survival is typically less than 6 months. In humans, chronic biliary tract inflammation is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme induced in the presence of inflammation, plays a role in carcinogenesis via decreased immune surveillance, inhibition of apoptosis, and stimulation of angiogenesis. In vitro, overexpression of COX-2 can induce malignant transformation of biliary cells. The enzyme is also overexpressed in human cholangiocarcinoma biopsy samples compared to normal liver and is thought to play a key role in the transition from hepatic inflammation to neoplasia.",

Vaults are ribonucleoprotein particles found in the cytoplasm of eucaryotic cells. Although the existence of vaults was first reported in the mid-1980s, no function has yet been attributed to this organelle. The structure of the vault complex and its localization indicate a possible function in intracellular transport. The idea that vaults might play a role in drug resistance was suggested by the identification of the lung resistancerelated protein (LRP) known as the human major vault protein (MVP). LRP was found to be overexpressed in many chemoresistant cancer cell lines and primary tumors of different origins, including lymphomas that did not express P-gp. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible expression of LRP gene and its protein in dogs with multicentric lymphoma. Lymph node samples at the diagnosis and at relapse from 15 dogs with multicentric lymphoma treated with COP protocol were obtained. The expression of LRP gene and protein were determined by RT-PCR using the primers LRP-S 59-GGG TTG TGC CCA TCA CCA CC-39 and LRP-AS 59-GGT CCG CGG ATG AGC CAG TGG-39, and dot-blotting. Expression of LRP gene was 93.3% at diagnosis and the protein was 85.8%. The expression increased to 100% for the gene and protein at relapse during chemotherapy. It's necessary to analyze if this mechanism can induce the multidrug resistance phenotype in canine multicentric lymphoma and if it can be considered a negative prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy and/or diseasefree survival. Resistance to chemically different anticancer drugs (multidrug resistance or MDR) results from decreased drug accumulation, resulting from expression of ATP-dependent efflux pumps. Multidrug resistance phenotype in cancer cells is associated with overexpression of the transmembrane drug carrier such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that decreases intracellular drug bioavailability leading to impaired treatment efficacy in the case of cytotoxic agents.",

Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder is the most common neoplasia of the canine urinary tract. Animals frequently present late in the disease process which limits therapeutic options. Early detection of TCC could improve clinical results. The Veterinary Bladder Tumor Antigen (VBTA) test utilizes antibodies to a bladder-associated glycoprotein complex present in the urine of dogs with TCC. The VBTA test may be a good screening test, however, due to interference by protein, bacteria and/ or inflammatory cells, it has low specificity (high number of false positives). In humans, evaluation of microsatellite instability (MSI) on urine samples appears to be a promising diagnostic test for TCC. Microsatellites (MS) are short tandem repeats (varying from 1-6 DNA bases) and are the most abundant class of repetitive DNA in the canine genome.

This data suggests that the APR is an important component of canine IMHA. Glucocorticoids with or without other immunotherapy are the initial treatment of choice for dogs with severe immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (IMT). The majority of treated dogs will have significant improvements in platelet counts within 5 to 7 days of commencing therapy, but complications due to hemorrhage often occur before this response is seen. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) has been safely and successfully used in other canine hematologic disorders, such as immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, and it is used in people with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The purpose of this study was to describe adverse effects and benefit of hIVIG in addition to conventional immunosuppressive therapy in five client-owned dogs with severe primary IMT. The hospital database was searched for dogs with IMT treated with hIVIG. Diagnosis of IMT was made by exclusion of other known etiologies of severe thrombocytopenia. Medical records were reviewed for the following information: dosage and effect of hIVIG on platelet count, duration of hospitalization, clinical signs, transfusion requirement, and adverse effects. Human IVIG was administered after 3 days of initiation of immunosuppressive therapy in 4 dogs, and after 2 days in 1 dog. In all cases, mean platelet counts pre-and 24 hours post-hIVIG infusion (0.28-0.76 g/kg) were 2,500/mL and 50,600/mL (62,750/ mL for the four responders), respectively. One dog failed to respond as promptly to hIVIG (0.34 g/kg) and the platelet count increased up to 66,000/ mL after 9 days of immunosuppressive therapy. Mean duration of hospitalization post-hIVIG in all five cases was 1.8 days (12 hours for responders) and mean total length of hospitalization was 4.6 days (3.5 days for responders). Active hemorrhage resolved and no packed red blood cell transfusions were required after hIVIG infusion for responders. No adverse effects were noted during or after hIVIG infusion in any case.

The antiglobulin test (also known as Coombs' test) detects allo-and autoantibodies on the surface of red blood cells or in plasma. Various techniques, protocols, and reagents have been used, including the conventional tube and microplate assays, to detect immune-mediated hemolytic anemias (IMHA) and hemolytic transfusion reactions. In this study, we introduced a novel canine antiglobulin gel column technique with a polyspecific (rabbit anti-IgG, anti-IgM and anti-C3) reagent (DiaMed, Switzerland). Briefly, for the direct antiglobulin test (DAT), the patient's red cells in a diluent were placed on top of the antiglobulin gel column and centrifuged for 10 minutes in a specific centrifuge. The red cell retention in the gel was graded 0 to 4+. Seventy EDTA samples from 48 anemic dogs requiring transfusion and 6 non-anemic dogs were tested over one year. On 14 samples the routine tube technique was also performed. Of the 70 DATs, 31 were from dogs with suspected IMHA (i.e. slide agglutination or spherocytes). The remaining samples were from dogs actively bleeding or with non immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. The DEA 1.1 type of all dogs was determined by a gel column technique (DiaMed).",

In all six cases, those alloantibodies were determined to be anti-DEA 7. The incidence of alloantibodies in this study was found to be lower in dogs with known history of pregnancy (11.4%) when compared with the control group (13.3%). In comparison, the incidence of canine serum alloantibodies was previously found to be 13.5% on a survey of 2500 potential canine blood donors, with 9.2% of these antibodies classified as anti-DEA 7. These data support that, in contrast to what occurs in women, pregnancy does not sensitize dogs to red blood cell antigens. Consequently, excluding dogs with prior history of pregnancy from blood donor programs is unjustified, especially in a time of constantly growing demand for blood. Similarly, a prior history of pregnancy is not by itself, a reason to perform additional pre-transfusion compatibility studies. Blood transfusions play an increasing role in the management of anemic cats. Advantages of hemoglobin-based oxygen carrying solutions such as OxyglobinH over blood transfusions include its long shelf live, immediate availability, lack of need of blood typing/crossmatching, and the impossibility of transmission of infectious diseases. Little information about the use of OxyglobinH in cats is available since only very few studies are published to date. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was the evaluation of OxyglobinH infusions in cats over a 4-year-period. In Germany, OxyglobinH is not licensed for cats, it was administered under off-label use with owner consent. The following parameters were evaluated: indication, infusion volume/24 hrs., pre-and 24 hour postinfusion blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, adverse events and patient outcome. Maximal infusion rate was 5 ml/kg/hr. From 2002 till 2006 46 anemic cats received 61 OxyglobinH infusions over a time period of 1 to 3 days (median [m] 1 day). 23 cats suffered from acute (22) or chronic (1) blood loss anemia, 13 from hemolytic anemia, 8 from ineffective erythropoiesis, and in 2 cats the cause of anemia was unknown. The reason for choosing OxyglobinH rather than feline blood was a lack of compatible type B blood (5), a lack of readily available feline blood or to limit the use of feline RBC, respectively. 29 cats received blood transfusions in addition to OxyglobinH; 10 of them during the same 24-hour evaluation interval within OxyglobinH was administered. In these 10 cats the change of Hb concentration was not evaluated. The preinfusion Hb concentration ranged from 2-7.8 g/dl (m 4.9), the dose administered was 4.4-25 ml/kg/day (m 10). In 22 of the 46 cats the OxyglobinH infusion volume was divided and given approximately 12 hrs. apart. The Hb change postinfusion ranged from 21.5 to 5.2 g/dl (m 1). An increase in Hb was noted in 38 of 51 infusion events. Six cats developed pulmonary edema (5) and/or pleural effusion (3), 4 of them died, 1 cat was euthanized. These 6 cats received 6.7-19.8 ml/day (m 11.3), in 2 cats the OxyglobinH volume of 11.3 and 13.3 ml was split. Three of these 6 cats received additional blood transfusions on the same day. All 6 cats suffered from cardiac disease diagnosed by echocardiography or histopathology. The overall 24-hour survival rate was 71%. 25 cats (54%) were discharged from the hospital.

A search of medical records for dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis from January 2001 to April 2006 was made. Variables recorded included signalment, zip code, living environment, presentation date, vaccination history, presenting signs and laboratory abnormalities, results of leptospira serology, and outcome. Ninety dogs met the inclusion criteria, 55 from CA and 35 from MN. The proportion of small breed dogs was greater in the MN group compared with the CA group (40% vs 16%, P 5 0.02). Case numbers peaked in fall in MN and winter in CA. Titers were highest to serogroup pomona in 64% of CA but only 14% of MN dogs. Titers were highest to serogroup grippotyphosa in 34% of MN but only 2% of CA dogs. Creatinine, BUN, and phosphorus concentrations were lower (P values .01, ,.001, and ,.001, respectively), and albumin concentration and ALP activity were higher (P values .001 and .03, respectively) in the MN compared with the CA group. Hemodialysis was performed in 53% of the CA and none of the MN dogs. Euthanasia or death related to leptospirosis was recorded in 18% of the CA and 14% of the MN dogs.

Vaccination recommendations may require modification depending on geographic location. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia canis is a highly prevalent disease in Brazil. We have previously shown that dogs naturallyinfected with E. canis have increased troponin I and may be at a higher risk of developing myocardial injury. The aim of the present study was therefore, to characterize myocardial changes, and to estimate the severity of the cardiac apoptosis in dogs naturally-infected with E. canis. The study was approved by the Medical Ethic and Animal Care Committee of S\u00e3 o Paulo State University. At a Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Southeast Brazil, myocardial samples were obtained from twenty dogs which died with clinicopathological abnormalities consistent with a tick-borne disease. Dogs were included if they had at least three of the following criteria: presence of ticks, fever, bleeding, neurological signs, inflammatory ocular disorders, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or hyperproteinemia. Infection with E. canis was diagnosed by 16S rRNA PCR. Dogs were also tested by PCR for infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis vogeli, Bartonella spp, E. canis, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, and Rickettsia rickettsii. Four healthy dogs with negative PCR results and no seroreactivity to A. phagocytophilum, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella vinsonii subsp berkhoffii, E. canis, Leishmania chagasi, Leptospira interrogans, and R. rickettsii were selected as negative controls. Myocardial samples were initially evaluated in Hematoxilin-Eosin-stained slides, and the apoptotic index was assessed by immunohistochemistry to detect the cleaved form of caspase-3 enzyme. Lymph nodes from negative control dogs and canine embryonic hearts were used as positive controls for apoptotic cells. Nineteen of 20 ill dogs were infected with E. canis. Four dogs were coinfected with A. platys, whereas 4 different dogs were also coinfected with B. canis vogeli. One dog was negative for all pathogens evaluated. Myocardial necrosis and hemorrhage were present in all coinfected dogs, and in 9 of 11 dogs infected only with E. canis. Lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrates were identified in 7 of 8 coinfected dogs and in 8 of 11 dogs infected only with E. canis. The apoptotic index was 36 times higher in E. canis-infected dogs (mean 6 SD: 0.126 6 0.093 cells/mm 2 ; median 5 0.108 cells/mm 2 ; P75 5 0.179 cells/mm 2 ) than in healthy dogs (mean 6 SD: 0.005 6 0.006 cells/mm 2 ; median 5 0.003 cells/mm 2 ; P75 5 0.009 cells/mm 2 ; p50.003). These data suggest that monocytic ehrlichiosis may lead to myocardial damage by necrosis and apoptosis. However, we cannot completely rule out other causes of myocardial injury because our protocol selected patients with advanced disease. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by Ehrlichia ewingii and infects neutrophils. Clinical signs in dogs infected with E. ewingii include fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, lameness, neutrophilic polyarthritis, severe but transient thrombocytopenia, and transient mild nonregenerative anemia with ineffective erythropoeisis.",

This tick species is a known vector for Ehrlichia canis, Babesia canis, Anaplasma platys and potentially Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii in North America. Frequent R. sanguineus infestations of dogs on a Hopi Indian reservation located in northeastern Arizona raised concerns about the role of this tick as a vector for pathogens affecting dogs and people. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of selected tick-borne pathogens in the dogs on the Hopi reservation. During the annual wellness clinic, performed by USAMRIID personnel, blood samples were obtained and 442 attached ticks were collected and identified from 145 pet and stray dogs. PCR targeting genes of selected tick-borne pathogens included: the A. platys, E. canis, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Ehrlichia ewingii 16S rRNA gene, the Anaplasma phagocytophilum GroEL gene, the Rickettsia OmpA gene, and the Bartonella 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer region. The SnapH 4DxH test was used to detect Anaplasma and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies, Borrelia burgdorferi C6 peptide antibody and Dirofilaria immitis antigens. All ticks were identified as R. sanguineus. E. canis DNA was detected in 37% (53/145) of the dogs, and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies were detected in 38% (55/144). Anaplasma spp. antibodies were detected in 12% (17/144). A. platys DNA was amplified from 12 dogs (8.3%); of which 8 dogs were co-infected with E. canis. A. phagocytophilum, Bartonella spp., E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii and Rickettsia spp. DNA was not amplified from any sample and there was no serological evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi or D. immitis. Gender, age, tick attachment, red blood cell count, white blood cell count and platelet count were included in a logistic regression model, which indicated that a thrombocytopenic dog from the Hopi reservation was 9 times more likely to be infected with E. canis (OR 95% CI 5 2.6-31.9; p , 0.001) and 10 times more likely to be infected with A. platys (OR 95% CI 1.8-56.9; p 5 0.009) than a non-thrombocytopenic dog. E. canis infected dogs were more likely to be anemic (low hematocrit, p,0.001; low hemoglobin concentration, p,0.005) than E. canis negative dogs. Both E. canis infected dogs and E. canis/A. platys co-infected dogs were thrombocytopenic (low platelet counts, p,0.001) compared to negative dogs. When comparing E. canis PCR with Snap 4Dx test results, there was 80% agreement between both methods (McNemar's test, p50.71). Only 51% (73/144) of the dogs were negative for all tests. These data indicate that one in two dogs on the Hopi reservation has been exposed to E. canis and/or A. platys, and also suggest that R. sanguineus attachment correlates with this high prevalence. Canine Lyme disease vaccines currently provide protection by inducing borreliacidal outer surface protein (Osp)A antibodies that eliminate B. burgdorferi spirochetes from the midguts of feeding ticks. The spirochetes, however, down-regulate OspA expression immediately after the tick begins acquiring a blood meal, so protection is effective only during the early stage of the bite. As a precursor to studies to validate additional vaccination strategies, we exposed young dogs to infected ticks, determined the ability to induce infection with B. burgdorferi, and characterized the development of limb/joint disorders. Twenty (10 female, 10 male) I. scapularis ticks collected from a highly endemic Lyme disease focus were attached for 7 days to each of 15 normal 8 week-old beagles. Fourteen (93%) dogs became infected as evidenced by recovery of spirochetes from skin biopsies and the development of IgG antibodies that bound at least 7 B. burgdorferi proteins, including antibodies specific for an approximately 20 kDa protein. In addition, sera from 10 (71%) infected dogs contained specific borreliacidal antibodies. In contrast, only one (7%) dog developed lameness and spirochetes were recovered from the elbow of the affected limb. However, immunosuppression induced by administration of dexamethasone resulted in lameness in three additional dogs (21%), and spirochetes were also recovered from two animals. Moreover, histopathological examination revealed significant synovitis in one or more joints from 6 (55%) of the 11 remaining infected dogs. The findings therefore confirm the ability of challenge with ticks to infect young dogs with B. burgdorferi and highlight the utility of the challenge model to evaluate the efficacy of future vaccine formulations. The results also affirm previous reports that canine Lyme disease manifests most often as non-suppurative, sub-clinical synovitis affecting synovial membranes, joint capsules, and associated tendon sheaths. Current canine Lyme disease vaccines provide protection by inducing borreliacidal outer surface protein (Osp)A antibodies that destroy B. burgdorferi spirochetes in the midguts of feeding ticks. The spirochetes, however, rapidly downregulate OspA and upregulate OspC as the tick acquires a blood-meal, so a vaccine that also induces borreliacidal OspC antibodies could provide more comprehensive protection. We therefore evaluated the ability of vaccination with intact spirochetes to induce OspA and OspC borreliacidal antibodies, and evaluated the ability of the responses to eliminate spirochetes from the midguts of feeding ticks. Eight-week-old beagles were vaccinated (day 0) and boosted (day 21) with placebo or an adjuvanted bacterin comprised of a traditional B. burgdorferi isolate (S-1-10), a novel ospA 2 /ospB 2 isolate (90109), or a combination of both. One week after the booster, a blood sample was collected, and the dogs were challenged by allowing field-collected I. scapularis female ticks to feed to repletion. The immune sera from the dogs vaccinated with S-1-10 or 90109 contained high concentrations (titers .1:2560) of borreliacidal OspA or OspC antibodies, respectively. In addition, the vaccinations resulted in decreased detection of spirochetes in the midguts of engorged ticks from the dogs vaccinated with S-1-10 (4 of 9 dogs [44%], p 5 0.3348) or 90109 (5 of 9 [56%], p 5 0.6199) compared to the ticks removed from the dogs that received placebo (7 of 9 [78%]). More significantly, the combination bacterin induced high levels (titers . 1:2560) of OspA and OspC borreliacidal antibodies, and the percentage of engorged ticks infected with B. burgdorferi was reduced significantly further (1 of 9 [11%], p 5 0.0152). The findings suggest that a canine Lyme disease vaccine that induces borreliacidal OspA and OspC antibodies will provide significantly improved protection. The SNAPH 4DxH test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the simultaneous detection of canine heartworm antigen, antibodies to Ehrlichia canis, antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum in canine serum, plasma or whole blood. The A. phagocytophilum antibody assay utilizes a synthetic peptide derived from the major outer surface protein (p44/Msp2). The SNAP 4Dx assay uses the same assay reagents for heartworm, E. canis and B. burgdorferi as in the current SNAPH 3DxH test.",

            "text": "In conclusion, clinical findings in dogs with anaplasmosis were nonspecific. Thrombocytopenia was a common laboratory abnormality; preliminary findings suggest that immune-mediated platelet destruction might be an important pathologic mechanism. Disease can be transmitted by blood transfusion, therefore, blood donor screening and tick control is recommended. In the case of correct diagnosis and therapy prognosis of anaplasmosis is good. Hemoplasmas, also known as hemotropic mycoplasmas, have been reported in several mammalian species. In dogs, two distinct hemoplasmas have been described: Mycoplasma haemocanis and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum'. Infection can lead to anemia mainly in splenectomized or immunosuppressed dogs, but the clinical importance of the two distinct canine hemoplasma species needs to be further investigated. No data on the presence of canine hemoplasmas in Switzerland is available, but the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus, a vector for canine hemoplasmas, is occasionally encountered in Southern Switzerland. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of M. haemocanis and 'Candidatus M. haematoparvum' in the Swiss dog population. Blood samples collected from 889 dogs presented at the Clinic for Small Animals of the University of Zurich, Switzerland, were analyzed by two sensitive real-time PCR assays. To confirm the PCR results and for phylogenetic analyses, the 16S rRNA gene of four isolates was sequenced. Overall, hemoplasma infections were rarely detected in Swiss dogs: M. haemocanis was found in 8 (0.9%) and 'Candidatus M. haematoparvum' in 3 (0.3%) of the tested samples. Phylogenetic analyses of one 'Candidatus M. haematoparvum' and three M. haemocanis isolates revealed at least 99% similarity to the concerning published sequences. Only two infected dogs showed mild anemia. In three PCR-positive animals a chronic carrier stage of 3 to 9 months was demonstrated. Interestingly, the majority of the infected dogs had paid a visit to regions where R. sanguineus is frequently found. According to our results, canine hemoplasma infections play only a subordinate role in dogs in Switzerland. There are increasing reports of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) infection and colonization in companion animals and evidence that MRS can be transmitted between animals and humans. The object of this study was to detect MRS among bacterial isolates from clinical specimens of animal and veterinary personnel in veterinary teaching hospital and to investigate their relation for the possibility of interspecies transmission. The clinical samples collected from various infectious disease processes including pyoderma, panniculitis, cystitis, arthritis, uveitis, and infections of the respiratory tract and urogenital tract. Nasal and hand swab samples were also collected from the 30 volunteer veterinarians and from the 7 owners whose animals were confirmed to be infected with MRS. MRS was isolated from 12 animals (10%), 11 veterinary personnel (36.7%), and 3 owners yielding a total 34 MRS isolates. Among 29 MRS from animals and veterinary personnel, 13 strains were Staphylococcus aureus and 16 were Stapylococcus intermedius. The species of five MRS isolates from the 3 animal owners were identical with those from their animals. PFGE types showed significant distinct patterns between animals and veterinary personnel but comparison of the isolates from animals and their owners revealed that one pair was indistinguishable and one pair was possibly related.",

The dynamics of staphylococcal transmission is poorly understood, however, it is possible that interspecies transmission of staphylococci is a common but unrecognized occurrence in households. Interspecies transmission of potentially pathogenic coagulase positive staphylococci may contribute to the development of infection or allow for dissemination of antimicrobial resistant strains (i.e. MRSA).

Upper respiratory infections (URI) in cats are common, especially in animal shelters and facilities where cats are densely housed. Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), calicivirus, Mycoplasma spp., Bordetella bronchiseptica and Chlamydophila felis are the most common primary causes of upper respiratory infections (URI) in cats. While secondary bacterial infections are often successfully managed with antibiotics of the beta-lactam class, primary bacterial infections frequently are not.

Thus, while presence of mycoplasmal DNA was associated with polyps in this small sample set, further studies evaluating fresh samples taken from additional normal cats and polyps of cats in several different populations are needed to verify the results. Feline respiratory disease is a symptom complex frequently occurring in small animal practice, to which however long time no special attention was given. The recent occurrence of severe and even lethal cases and the current vaccine discussion brings this disease back into focus. Clinical signs can vary between mild sneezing and coughing, conjunctivitis and ulceration of the tongue to severe rhinotracheitis and pneumonia. Most common etiological agents in this disease are Feline Herpes-(FHV) and Feline Calici-Virus (FCV), but also Chlamydophila felis, Bartonella henselae and Mycoplasma felis can play a major role in the localisation and development of the disease. In a study we performed in our laboratory in the year 2006, 68 cats with clinical signs of ''cat flu'' were testes for the presence of the above agents by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of each cat a conjunctival-and a mouth swab were taken. Conjunctival swabs were examined for the occurrence of FHV and FCV, Mycoplasma felis and Chlamydophila felis and mouth swabs for FHV and FCV, Mycoplasma felis and Bartonella henselae. All cats were tested for infections with Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV) and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) by serology. Aim of these study was to find out which organism prevails and whether and how often co-infections arise. Surprisingly and in contrast to other studies none of the mouth swabs and only 1.5% of the conjunctival swabs were positive for FHV, whereas 35.8% of the mouth swabs and 44% of the conjunctival swabs were positive for FCV. In 1.5% of the cases Chlamydophila felis was detected in conjunctival swabs and 9% of the mouth swabs were positive for Bartonella henselae. More astonishing was the high number of positive results for Mycoplasma felis in both conjunctival-(4.5%) and mouth swabs (46.3%). Co-infection with FCV occurred only in eight (mouth) respectively three (conjunctiva) of these cats and only two of the Bartonella-infected cats were as well positive for FCV. These results suggest a higher incidence of the non-viral organisms in feline respiratory diseases. Part of this outcome might be the more sensitive diagnostic method by PCR in comparison to culture. Using these methods in a diagnostic screening panel for feline respiratory diseases cannot only be reasonable regarding the therapy of the individual patients; it can be helpful in managing problems in breeding catteries and shelters too.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is induced by one of feline coronaviruses, FIPV. Although several antiviral treatment strategies, including ribavirin, interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-omega, had been proposed, an effective therapeutic strategy against FIP has yet to be established. Recently, the cellular receptor of feline coronavirus (FCoV) was identified. The cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN) was confirmed to be a receptor for type II FIPV; however, details of receptor usage remain to be fully elucidated. It has also been reported that cats that develop FIP have a high viral load. Thus, blocking virus-receptor binding appears effective to reduce viral replication and might be a new candidate for a therapeutic strategy. In the present study, we focused on a competitive antagonist of APN, ubenimex, and evaluated its toxicity to cells and inhibitory effects of FIPV replication in vitro.",

Briefly, fcwf-4 cells were exposed to serially diluted virus within culture media containing 0, 0.2, 2.0 or 20 ug/ml of ubenimex. After the 7-day cultivation, 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) were calculated by the method of Reed and M\u00fc nch. The percent inhibition was calculated by the following formula: Percent inhibition 5 TCID50 in ubenimex treated cells / TCID50 in ubenimex untreated cells 3 100. The replication of the FIPV UCD-1 strain was inhibited on average 20-45% by the addition of ubenimex. However, dose dependency was not observed. On the other hand, the replication of the FIPV 79-1146 strain was significantly inhibited in a ubenimex's dose dependent manner. Especially, 2.0 and 20 ug/ml of ubenimex treatment reduced more than 80% of the virus replication.

Studies on the pharmacological actions, effects on APN expression and in vivo toxicities of ubenimex are still necessary. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and hematologic variables associated with hemoplasma infection in cats with suspected hemoplasmosis from the US. Blood samples were collected through IDEXX Laboratories from 310 cats from California and Hawaii that had CBCs performed. These cats showed cytologic evidence of hemoplasmosis or the presence of acute and/or regenerative anemia without overt blood loss. Each sample was subjected to conventional and real-time PCR for 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (Mhm), M. haemofelis (Mhf), and 'Candidatus M. turicensis' (Mtc). Amplicons from samples testing positive by conventional but not real-time PCR were sequenced. The prevalence of Mhf was 4.8%, Mtc 6.1% and Mhm 23.5%. Mixed infections were detected in 6.5% of cats, including 74% of Mtc-infected cats and 67% of Mhf-infected cats. Two cats were infected with all three species. Cats infected with hemoplasmas were more likely male and infected with FIV. The mean nRBC count, MCV, and TP were higher and the mean BUN and creatinine lower in cats testing positive for any hemoplasma. Organisms were seen only in cats positive for Mhf. Mhf infection was associated with a higher mean reticulocyte and nRBC count compared with uninfected cats. Mtc infection was associated with a higher mean eosinophil count but not reticulocyte or nRBC counts. Mhm infection was associated only with a higher mean nRBC count. These data support differential pathogenicity of Mhf, Mtc, and Mhm, with Mhf having a higher hemolytic capacity. Organisms reported on blood smears are most likely Mhf. Mycoplasma haemofelis-negative cats (n 5 23) were inoculated IV with 1 ml of Mhf-infected blood and assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: doxycycline (5 cats; 5 mg/kg, PO, q12 hr), low-dose pradofloxacin (6 cats; 5 mg/kg, PO, q24 hr), high-dose pradofloxacin (6 cats; 10 mg/kg, PO, q24 hr), and an untreated control group (6 cats). Treatment was initiated for 14 days when Mhf infection was documented by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fever or anemia were detected. Cats were evaluated clinically daily and intermittently by CBC, conventional PCR, and quantitative PCR. Cats that were PCR negative on day 42 were administered methylprednisolone acetate (20 mg/kg, IM) and evaluated for another 28 days.",

Therefore, we conclude that the collection of a standard unit of blood (i.e. approximately 50 ml) for transfusion in healthy blood donor cats is safe, despite a significant decrease in arterial blood pressure, PCV, and HR. We investigated whether the hemodynamics of isoflurane anesthesia are influenced by the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in cats. Seven cats received placebo or enalapril 0.5 mg/kg orally. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, preceded by the administration of atropine, and then maintained with isoflurane. During anesthesia, systolic blood pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), body temperature, respiratory rate, and isoflurane concentrations in the expiratory and inspiratory gases were measured, as was plasma ACE activity. ACE activity was 17.864.6 in cats receiving the placebo and 3.962.3 in those receiving the ACEI. HR in cats receiving placebo were 188636, 162642, and 144641 beats/min at baseline, 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. In cats administered an ACEI, the HR were 172635, 170648, 151645 beats/min at baseline, 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. SAP in animals receiving the placebo were 113625, 91614, 86614 mmHg at baseline and 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. In animals administered the ACEI, SAP were 116619, 69613, 73619 mmHg at baseline and 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively, showing a significant decrease in blood pressure 30 and 60 min after induction, compared with placebo. This study indicated that general anesthesia may induce hypotension after administration of an ACEI. Thus, it may be necessary to withdraw ACEI therapy the day before or on the day of anesthesia to reduce the risk of hypotension during anesthesia in cats. This study compared healthy dogs (HDs) and dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) to examine the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on hemodynamics following administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Three hours before induction of anesthesia, study dogs received placebo or enalapril 0.5 mg/kg orally. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane for 1 h. During anesthesia, systolic blood pressure (SAP), and heart rate (HR) were measured. HRs in HDs receiving placebo were 82628, 96612, and 96615 bpm at baseline and 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. After ACEI administration, HRs were 84625, 8769, and 106616 bpm at baseline and 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. In MR dogs receiving placebo, HRs were 117630, 106618, and 117627 bpm at baseline and 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. After ACEI administration, HRs were 105616, 101614, and 109615 bpm at baseline and 30 and 60 min after induction, respectively. SAP values in HDs receiving placebo were 120610, 76612, 8164 mmHg, respectively. After ACEI administration, SAPs were 113611, 68613, 7569 beats/min, respectively. SAP values in MR dogs receiving placebo were 126632, 79621, and 92620 mmHg, respectively. With ACEI, SAP values were 115613, 54614, and 75612 mmHg, respectively. MR dogs receiving ACEI exhibited significantly decreased SAPs after anesthesia. Thus, general anesthesia may induce hypotension after administration of an ACEI and it may be necessary to withdraw the ACEI to reduce the risk of hypotension during anesthesia in dogs with MR.

ECG findings of ST-segment and T-wave changes were evident in animals with hypercapnia and reflect myocardial hypoxia a disorder that should be promptly corrected with assisted or controlled ventilation to prevent more complicated arrhythmias. Myocardial tissue velocity (TVI), Strain (S) and strain rate (SR) imaging are new echocardiographic imaging methods that allow quantitative assessment of segmental myocardial function. These parameters are usually measured by single point measurements placing a region of interest into the basal, mid and apical segments of the myocardial wall. EchoPac 2D-Strain software (General Electric) is a new software that calculates TVI, S and SR by 3 different methods. The first method uses grayscale pixels for automatic tracking and processing overlaying tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) data for the analysis of TVI, S and SR. The second method uses a combination of TDI-data and grayscale pixel tracking. The third method uses pure 2dimensional speckle tracking. Results of all software methods are displayed as averages over segments (AOS), but not as single point measurements. It is unclear, however, if these results are comparable to those obtained by the commonly used single point (SP) measurements of myocardial segments.

Abnormal patency of the ductus arteriosus is one of the most common congenital cardiovascular disease of the dog. Clinical management for left to right shunting consists on ductal closure, whether by surgical ligation or transcatheter closure (TCC). Angiographic measurements and anatomic type of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) are generally used to determine the suitability of TCC and device type/dimension selection. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a practical non invasive method for the diagnosis of this pathology, providing also information about the severity (grade of volume overload) of the disease and ductus dimensions.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the second most common heart disease in dogs. Such disease has a high mortality rate besides reducing the quality of life of the affected animals. The definitive diagnosis is based upon echocardiography which is characterized by dilation of cardiac chambers, mainly the left ones, and by reduced systolic function. Human medicine studies have reported that the diastolic dysfunction also plays an important role; so, echocardiographic variables which represent the ventricular diastolic filling, have a great prognostic value in terms of survival and symptoms status (heart failure functional class). The management of DCM traditionally consists of digitalis, diuretics and vasodilators, however, in the late years, some attention has being paid to the importance of the sympathetic nervous system on the pathophysiology of this disorder; being so, b-blockers have been included in the therapy. Many authors have reported that these drugs improve the left ventricle systolic and diastolic function, and so they increase the survival rate and reduce the symptoms progression.",

Myocardial strain (S) and strain rate (SR) calculated from Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) have been shown to be superior to myocardial velocities for the assessment of regional myocardial function in humans. However, TDIbased strain measurements are angle dependent due to the Doppler effect. Two-dimensional speckle tracking (2D Strain) is an echocardiographic method based on tracking of characteristic speckle patterns created by interference of ultrasound beams in the myocardium. As the tracking and calculation of S and SR is based on grayscale B-mode images, it is in principle angle independent. Alternatively, two-dimensional speckles can be used for automatic tracking only and overlaying TDI data, but no speckles are used for the S and SR analysis.

Pacing at the right ventricular apex (RVA) causes dysynchronous ventricular activation resulting in reduced cardiac function. The detrimental effects of RVA pacing have been demonstrated; whereas pacing at left ventricular (LV) sites or simultaneous biventricular (BiV) pacing have been shown to improve LV function.

The development of HCM in cats is likely due to genetic mutations of certain sarcomeric proteins; however, there is little information exploring the effects of environmental influences, such as diet or growth patterns, on the development of the disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are epidemiologic or anatomical features unique to cats with HCM. Cats with HCM and healthy cats, based on echocardiography, were enrolled in the study. Data collected included diet history; body weight; body condition score (BCS; 1-9 scale); humerus length; vertebral length [4 th (V4) and 12 th (V12) thoracic vertebra]; head length and width; and abdominal and leg circumference. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was measured by HPLC. Categorical variables were compared between the HCM and control groups with Chi square analysis and continuous variables were compared with Mann Whitney U tests. Twenty-four cats with HCM and 16 controls were enrolled in the study. Age, sex, and breed were not significantly different between the two groups. Cats with HCM weighed more than healthy controls but mean BCS was not different between the two groups. Median head width and median lengths of the head, V12, and humerus were significantly larger in the HCM group compared to healthy controls; other anatomical measurements were not different between the two groups. Serum IGF-1 concentrations (analyzed for 16 of 40 cats) were numerically, but not significantly, higher in the cats with HCM. Finally, significantly more healthy controls ate ad libitum compared to HCM cats, despite the fact that the HCM group had similar or higher BCS and body weight. These data suggest that cats with HCM are larger, but not fatter, than healthy cats. Determination of whether this size difference is related to early growth, different feeding patterns, or other genetic modifiers requires additional research. Hypertension is commonly encountered in both humans and dogs with endogeneous or exogeneous hypercortisolism (HC). Despite the recognized importance of cortisol as a mediator of hypertension, the mechanism is not completely understood. Recently, downregulation of the nitric oxide (NO) system has been proposed as a major cause for glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in humans. To address this aspect in dogs, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the NO system in hydrocortisone-induced hypertension in dogs.",

The microglial cell pellets were examined via quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with SYBR-green using the Mx3005P Quantitative PCR System2 (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal Wallis test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test with the significance level set at p # 0.05.",

However, in single dogs elevated cytokine expression was found, such as in granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) for IL-1b, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-a, and for IL-6 in meningeomas with high cerebrospinal fluid IgA levels. In conclusion, microglial expression of cytokines seems to follow a rather unspecific pattern which is irrespective to the underlying pathological event, however the course of the disease might be influenced by specific cytokine expression. Convection enhanced delivery (CED) is a local delivery technique that utilizes a bulk-flow mechanism to deliver and distribute macromolecules over clinically relevant volumes of targeted tissue. Real time in vivo imaging of CED is essential if adequate drug distribution is to be confirmed ante mortem, minimizing distribution or leakage of drugs to normal tissues during delivery and resulting in increased therapeutic index The purpose of this study was to develop an MRI compatible system for CED of liposomal nanoparticles into canine brain incorporating real-time MR imaging. Additionally any possible toxicity of liposomes containing gadolinium and the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan (CPT-11) was assessed.",

CED was monitored in real-time by sequential MRI and volumes of distribution were calculated from MR images and sequential histological sections. Assessment of any toxicity of liposomes, gadolinium and CPT-11 was based on clinical and histopathological evaluation. A total of 11 infusions were done using up to 300 ul liposomes per infusion, resulting in robust volumes of distribution in both thalamus and corona radiata. Volumes of distribution (V d ) and volumes of infusion (V i ) for both corona radiata and thalamic infusions were strongly correlated (R 2 $ 0.89). V d :V i for corona radiata infusions was approximately 2.8. V d :V i for thalamic infusions was more variable due to a higher incidence of leakage into ventricular or subarachnoid spaces and varied from , 1.2 to 3.4. Correlation between MRI V d and histologically confirmed V d was high suggesting that real time MRI gives an accurate measurement of actual tissue distribution of infused liposomes. Complications were minimal and included mild transient proprioceptive deficits, minor focal hemorrhage in one dog, and focal, mild perivascular, nonsuppurative encephalitis in one dog. Results indicate that CED of liposomal gadolinium/CPT-11 to clinically significant volumes of brain tissue is feasible in dogs, and is associated with minimal adverse effects. Real-time imaging of infusions is essential for optimization of infusion parameters and minimization of toxicity secondary to non targeted distribution. We reviewed the records of 468 dogs with histopathologically confirmed tumors involving the spinal columns that were seen through the biopsy or necropsy service of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania between the years 1986 and 2006. Our goal was to examine the prevalence of spinal tumors that compress or involve the spinal cord of the dog. A total of 399 tumors were included in this retrospective study. Each of these tumors resulted in spinal cord compression and/or involvement of the spinal parenchyma. Spinal tumors were placed in four categories: extradural tumors, intradural/extramedullary tumors, intramedullary tumors, and mixed compartment tumors. Extradural tumors included primary vertebral body (n586), secondary vertebral body (n538) and non-vertebral body or epidural tumors (n568), and constituted 192/399 (,48%) of the total number of masses. Intradural/extramedullary masses and intramedullary masses made up 51/399 (,13%) and 24/399 (,6%), respectively, of the total number of tumors. A mixed compartment category (involving more than one of the extradural, intradural/extramedullary, or intramedullary compartments), made up the remaining masses, 132/399 cases (,33%).",

The p53 wild type overexpression may be most common than p53 mutate expression in canine meningioma. The present study, like meningioma in people, is suggesting that p53 mutation may be not a frequent event in development of meningiomas. Meningioma is the most commonly diagnosed intracranial neoplasm of both canines and felines. In contrast to feline meningioma, canines tend to have biologically aggressive tumors that often recur after surgery and carry a more guarded prognosis. The reasons for this more aggressive behavior are unknown, but may be related to a higher proliferation rate of tumor cells or enzymatic digestion of surrounding neuropil, allowing local brain invasion. Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that is expressed only in the proliferative phases of the cell cycle. Ki-67 expression is routinely used in human meningioma cases to predict which tumors will likely recur with a lower staining index correlating with longer survival. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that have been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix and cellular basement membranes. Specifically, MMP2 expression positively correlates with invasiveness and a higher likelihood of recurrence in human meningioma. Cathepsin B is a lysosomal protease shown to contribute to tumor invasion and there is a significant correlation between cathepsin B expression and the atypical or malignant character of human meningiomas.",

It is possible that canine meningiomas achieve a more biologically aggressive phenotype through the over expression of MMP2 and cathepsin B, facilitating invasion of adjacent brain. Increased expression of Ki-67 reflects an increased proliferation rate and may explain rapid recurrence of canine tumors following surgical excision. The authors suggest that routine Ki-67 staining of all meningioma cases could predict cases that are likely to recur. Future therapies aimed at decreasing MMP2 and cathepsin B activity in canine meningiomas may prolong survival times. However, further studies are needed to validate the functional activity of MMP2 and cathepsin B in canine meningiomas. Dogs with intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) commonly have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. The pleocytosis is reported as variable, with a neutrophilic pleocytosis often noted in dogs with severe acute lesions and a milder, mixed or predominantly mononuclear pleocytosis present with chronic disease. On examination of CSF prior to myelography, we have observed that many dogs with type I IVDD have a moderate to marked lymphocytic pleocytosis, which may indicate the presence of concurrent infectious or inflammatory disease. The purpose of this study is to characterize CSF findings from a large cohort of dogs with type I IVDD, to determine the prevalence of lymphocytic pleocytosis in this group, and to determine whether chronicity of neurologic signs prior to presentation influences inflammatory cell types in CSF.",

Pleocytosis (.5 total nucleated cells/mL) was present in 213/441 (48%) dogs. Detailed information was obtained from patient records including breed, prior history of spinal hyperesthesia or paresis, time from onset of signs to presentation, and neurologic status (graded 1-5). Dogs with prior episodes of spinal hyperesthesia, paresis, and/or intra-operative evidence of chronic type I IVDD in addition to an acute disc herniation were considered to have an acute-on-chronic presentation. The CSF differential white blood cell counts for each dog were reviewed. Pleocytosis was characterized by the predominant cell type (defined as $40% with no other cell type $33%), or mixed if no cell type was $ 40% of the total or if two cell types were each .33% of the total). There was a trend for increased percentage of lymphocytes (p50.032) and decreased TNCC (p,0.0001) the longer the interval from onset of clinical signs to presentation. There was a significant increase in TNCC with higher grades of neurologic dysfunction (p50.050). Dogs with acute-on-chronic type I IVDD were more likely to have a lymphocytic pleocytosis (54/101; 53%) than were dogs with acute disc herniation (34/112; 30%) (p50.0013). Further research is required to characterize the type of lymphocytic response in these patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the MRI and CSF findings in a population of dogs with histologically confirmed primary and secondary intracranial tumors in order to determine the accuracy of MRI to distinguish between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions and to know whether or not some MRI features can be used to predict tumor type. Medical records of 30 dogs with histologically confirmed primary and secondary brain tumors that had undergone brain MRI were reviewed. MRI images were obtained with a 1.5-Tesla unit in 6 dogs and with a 0.2-Tesla unit in 24 dogs. The following MRI features were assessed: size, location, signal intensity, margins, presence of mass effect and peritumoral edema, contrast enhancement, cyst formation and presence of hemorrhage. CSF cell count, protein concentration and cytologic examination were performed in 13 dogs. Thirty dogs were included in the study. Thirty-one brain tumors were diagnosed by means of MRI and confirmed histologically. Histological diagnosis of primary tumors included: glioma (9), meningioma (5), pituitary adenoma (2), choroid plexus papilloma (2) trigeminal schwanoma (1), and ependimoblastoma (1). Secondary tumors were divided into metastatic (5), and secondary with direct extension to the brain (6). Twenty-one tumors were supratentorial, 6 were infratentorial, and 4 were multifocal. Primary tumors were more frequent in the supratentorial region (16/20-80%), whereas secondary tumors were located both in the supra-and infratentorial regions with similar frequency. In all cases, MRI images allowed detection of an intracranial lesion. MRI findings allowed differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in 27/31 (87%) cases. Three of the misdiagnosed cases were unusual gliomas, and the other tumour was a meningeal sarcoma. Prediction of tumour type based on MRI findings for primary brain tumours was correct in 13/20 (65%) tumors. For primary brain tumors, the differential diagnosis could be narrowed to two tumor types based on MRI features in four dogs, and the MRI diagnosis was incorrect in another three animals. For secondary tumours, the accuracy of MRI to diagnose nasal tumours was excellent (6/6), whereas for metastatic tumors, MRI findings permitted to predict tumour type in 3/5 (60%) of the cases. CSF disclosed an elevated total cell count in 10/13 cases and the total protein concentration was increased in 11/13 cases. Albuminocytologic dissociation was observed in one case. MRI findings such as size, location, contrast enhancement pattern and signal intensity were important features to distinguish between primary and secondary brain tumors. However, accurate diagnosis of a neoplastic lesion was not possible on the basis of the MRI appearance in 13% of cases. Accurate diagnosis of tumor type was not always possible because the unusual appearance of some neoplasms, and the similar MRI features of some tumor types.

Contraindications for medetomidine and atipamezole use include patients with cardiac disease, shock, respiratory disorders, certain liver and kidney disorders, shock, or in dogs that are severely debilitated. Cervical spinal cord infarction is purportedly uncommon in cats. We describe 11 cats diagnosed with cervical spinal cord infarction, based on clinical signs and MRI findings. Eleven DSH (4FS, 7MC) cats presented with an acute onset of tetraparesis that appeared non-painful. Median age at the time of presentation was 15 years. Seven cats had pre-existing medical conditions that could predispose to infarction, including cardiomegaly (1), hypertension (1), hyperthyroidism (4), and chronic renal failure (1). One cat had an episode of tetraparesis in the past. On presentation, all cats were nonambulatory tetraparetic. The neuroanatomic diagnosis was a C1-C5 myelopathy in 8 cats and a C6-T2 myelopathy in 3 cats. Six cats had cervical ventroflexion, characterized by an inability to hold the head up, move the head and neck, or support the head when lifted. Heart murmurs were ausculted in 4 cats. Blood pressure was measured in all cats and 4 were hypertensive with a median systolic blood pressure of 238 mmHg (range 177-255 mmHg). Biochemical profiles indicated renal insufficiency in 2 cats. Coagulation profiles were performed in 3 cats, two of which had elevated fibrinogen levels. All cats underwent MRI. Abnormalities on MRI included lesions that were iso-to hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images with varying enhancement with gadolinium. Lesions were hyperintense on FLAIR images for the 5 cats in which this was performed. Eight of the MRIs were remarkably similar, characterized by a lesion located in the ventral aspect of the gray matter overlying the caudal aspect of C1 and the cranial aspect of C2. Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 5 cats, of which 2 were normal, 1 had elevated protein, and 2 had a neutrophilic pleocytosis. A cardiology work-up was performed in 9 cats; 7/9 were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1 with restrictive cardiomyopathy, and 1 had a normal echocardiogram. Treatment consisted of supportive care, physical therapy, and therapy aimed at the primary disorder. Three cats were euthanized within days of diagnosis; necropsy was declined by all owners. One of the three cats showed marked improvement within the first 36 hours after diagnosis, but was euthanized due to his concurrent illnesses (hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.) The remaining 8 cats all became ambulatory within 1 week to 2 months and no relapses have been reported (follow-up for 7 cats ranged from 2 to 31 months, 1 cat was lost to follow-up.) Magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic procedure of choice for identifying spinal cord infarction in humans and should be considered as such in cats, although a definitive diagnosis can only be obtained by histological examination of the spinal cord. Cats with acute spinal cord infarction may display cervical ventroflexion as a clinical feature of their disease and often there is a pre-existing condition that may be the cause of infarction. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common cause of morbidity in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). Urine retention, overflow incontinence, urinary catheterization and treatment with high doses of corticosteroids are some of the factors that increase the risk for UTI in SCI patients. Despite the perception that there is an increased incidence of UTI in dogs with spinal cord injury, there have been very few reports on this subject. The goal of this study was to determine the perioperative and one and three month postsurgical incidence of urinary tract infection in dogs following spinal cord injury caused by thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion.",

This study is presently ongoing and will continue to investigate the potential association between urine protein excretion and abnormal renal function in hyperthyroid cats. The prevalence of feline diabetes mellitus has increased several-fold over the last 3 decades. In cats, abnormal insulin secretion appears to play a major role in the progression from the lean to the overweight and diabetic state. In obese humans, progression to type 2 diabetes is marked by changes in the release of proinsulin. A feline specific proinsulin assay has not been available to examine changes in proinsulin secretion in obese cats. In order to test the hypothesis that feline proinsulin secretion is altered in obesity, we cloned feline proinsulin (FPI; Hoenig et al., Dom. Animal. Endocrinol. 2006) . Monoclonal antibodies were developed against recombinant FPI and used in a two-site sandwich immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Tubes were coated with an affinity-purified antibody and a capture antibody was conjugated to biotin and, following incubation and washing, sandwiches were detected using 125 I-streptavidin. The antibody pair chosen had negligible crossreactivity with bovine, porcine, and human insulin, and feline C-peptide. The working range was 11-667 pmol/L. A 120 min intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed in 12 neutered adult healthy cats (6 long-term obese, 6 lean) and serum glucose (DCL, Oxford, CT), serum insulin (Hoenig and Ferguson, J. Endocrinol. 1989) , and serum recombinant FPI concentrations were determined at each timepoint. Fasting glucose concentrations were similar between lean and obese cats at baseline but glucose concentrations were significantly higher at 120 min in obese cats (p , 0.0001). Although serum proinsulin and insulin concentration were lower in lean than obese cats at baseline, this was only significant for insulin (p , 0.05). The proinsulin and insulin secretion pattern in response to glucose was significantly different between lean and obese cats but the pattern was similar within a group. Obese cats released the majority of these hormones in the last 30 min of the IVGTT .The peak of secretion for both hormones was seen at 90 minutes.",

However, BE is not a specific indicator of organic metabolic acidosis and can be influenced by in vivo respiratory changes. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of these metabolic indexes when evaluating a dog suspected of having diabetic ketoacidosis. In human medicine, 3-b-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) is the predominant ketone body produced during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Thus, blood ketone testing methods that quantify 3HB are largely used for diagnosing and monitoring DKA. Furthermore, false-positive and false-negative results may occur using urine or blood acetoacetate testing methods. An accurate and precise handheld electrochemical sensor for rapid measuring of whole blood 3HB has recently been introduced in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the ketone meter in diabetic dogs. This study showed that the performance of this ketone sensor is acceptable in distinguishing a moderate to markedly elevated 3HB level from that of normal. Furthermore, its ease of use, small sample volume, short test time (30 s) and early detection of ketosis suggest that this sensor may be a potential tool for diagnosing and monitoring DKA in diabetic dogs. Further extensive studies in diabetic dogs are needed to assess the performance of this ketone meter in a clinical setting where a broad spectrum of metabolic conditions could interfere with the accuracy of these devices. The contribution of ketones, lactate, and electrolytes to acid-base abnormalities in diabetic dogs is poorly characterized. We hypothesize that acidosis in diabetic dogs is caused predominantly by accumulation of ketones. Blood was collected from 48 diabetic (fasting blood glucose . 200 mg/dl and glucosuria, (D) and 17 nondiabetic (N) adult dogs. There was no difference in blood pH between non-diabetic and diabetic dogs (N, 7.3760.04; D, 7.3660.07, p50.75) The results of a previous study performed by the authors to investigate the cause of idiopathic vacuolar hepatopathy (IVH) in Scottish terriers (ST) revealed abnormal results to a standard adrenocortical steroid panel (ASP) pre-and post-ACTH stimulation in both clinically normal ST and those with elevated alkaline phosphatase and presumed IVH. In addition, a large number of ST evaluated through the University of Tennessee Endocrinology Laboratory (UTEL) have abnormal ASP results. These findings suggest that the current reference ranges for a standard ASP at the UTEL may be inappropriate for ST. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference between adrenocortical steroids of ST and normal control dogs pre-and post-ACTH stimulation.",

Ex vivo tissue slice methodology offers an advantage over cell culture in that cell-to-cell adhesions and communication are maintained, more accurately reflecting normal organ function. To our knowledge, this system has not been applied to canine adrenal glands.

Study 2: Compared to the media concentration at the preceding time of collection, cortisol increased 63, 20, 259 and 199% at 2, 3, 5 and 7 hr, respectively (n53 glands). Cortisol concentrations were significantly different between 3 and 5 hr and 5 and 7 hr. In contrast, the addition of trilostane at 3 hr caused cortisol to increase only by 55, 37, 277 and 31%, respectively (n56 glands). Cortisol concentrations between 3 and 5 hr and 5 and 7 hr were significantly different. The % change between 5 and 7 hr was significantly lower when trilostane was present compared to control. Therefore, Study 1 showed that, without ACTH, a large amount of cortisol is released within the first 2 hr after slicing and then secretion slows and media concentration changes little over time. Study 2 demonstrated that cultured slices were sufficiently healthy to respond to ACTH by increasing cortisol production (199% over the final 2 hrs). Further, trilostane inhibited this response (cortisol increased only 31% over the final 2 hrs if trilostane was present). This study proves the study of adrenal slices ex vivo is a feasible alternative to tissue culture methods. The ACTH stimulation test is widely used for evaluation of adrenocortical function in dogs. However, very few studies have described the plasma disposition of low doses of cosyntropin. Establishing the plasma disposition and adrenal response profile may aid in more accurate diagnoses of pituitary-adrenal axis perturbations. The purpose of this study was to determine plasma ACTH disposition following 5 low doses of cosyntropin in clinically healthy dogs.",

More than half of the adrenal tumors responsible of hyperadrenocorticism are malignant. They can be metastasized by the time of diagnosis or after surgical resection. Medical management is then necessary for control of clinical signs. Because of its adrenocorticolytic potential, o,p'-DDD is the treatment of choice for this indication. However, high amounts of o,p'-DDD are necessary to reach a clinical and biological response, making adverse clinical signs present in more than half of the dogs treated. In a previous survey, o,p'-DDD was tested on 8 dogs with metastatic secreting adrenocortical tumor (MSAT).

Dogs with glomerular lesions may present moderate to severe proteinuria before azotemia will be present. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered the gold standard method to evaluate kidney function. However, its usefulness in patients at initial stages of natural CKD of glomerular origin (i.e. leishmaniasis), where routine laboratory techniques are not sensitive enough, remains unproved. The plasma exogenous creatinine clearance test (PECCT) is an accurate indicator of GFR that can be performed in routine veterinary practice.

A urine sample was obtained by cystocentesis for complete urinalysis. The urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPC) was determined in all cases and GFR was calculated by performing the PECCT. Dogs were separated in several groups according to the reference values proposed by the IRIS group for proteinuria and serum creatinine (SCr) as follows: Group A (healthy dogs; n54): UPC , 0.2 and SCr , 1.4 mg/dl; group B (n57): UPC 0.2-0.5 and SCr , 1.4 mg/dl; group C (n59): UPC . 0.5 and SCr , 1.4 mg/dl; group D (n55): SCr 1.4-2 mg/dl and; group E (n53): SCr . 2 mg/dl.

Urodynamic studies in cats can be a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating normal micturition as well as the pathophysiology of various bladder disorders. Normal parameters must be established under strict, standard anesthetic regimens and urodynamic protocols. In this study, five healthy cats were anesthetized, intubated (when possible) and anesthetized with either isoflurane (1.75% and 2% end-tidal, n53) or propofol (2 mg/kg and either 0.2 mg/kg/min or 0.4 mg/kg/min, n52). A 6 Fr double lumen urinary catheter was placed aseptically in the urethra and urine was removed from the bladder. The catheter was connected to a pressure transducer and bladder pressure was recorded. Warm sterile water was infused at 4 ml/min until a detrusor reflex was noted. The threshold pressures and volumes were recorded as well the heart rate and respiratory rate just prior to the detrusor reflex. The results are shown in Table 1 . These data suggest that there may be a trend for higher threshold pressures in cats anesthetized under the low propofol regimen. Spontaneous bladder contractions in the early filling phase were seen consistently in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4 th CMGs for each cat, suggesting possible activation of local reflexes. Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a well-recognized cause of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in cats. It has also been implicated as a cause of feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). Urethral plug formation and urinary obstruction are common sequelae of FIC. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of FCV urinary tract infection and FCV antibodies in cats with and without FIC. The study population included 47 client-owned cats with nonobstructive FIC, 22 client-owned cats with urethral plug-induced obstructive FIC, 56 client-owned, sheltered, or feral cats with signs of URTD, and 46 client-owned asymptomatic cats. A diagnosis of FIC was established by exclusion of other causes of lower urinary tract signs with a complete urinalysis, quantitative urine culture, survey abdominal radiography, and contrast urethrocystography, urethrocystoscopy, or ultrasonography. Samples of oropharyngeal secretions, urine, and serum were collected from each cat. Urine specimens were collected by cystocentesis or urethral catheterization after disinfection of the sampling site. Total RNA was isolated from urine and oropharyngeal samples within 24 hours of collection and evaluated with a previously validated FCV p30 gene-based real-time RT-PCR assay. Serum virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers were determined by a modified microtiter assay. All cats with nonobstructive or obstructive FIC and asymptomatic cats had been previously vaccinated for FCV; the vaccination status of URTD cats was largely unknown. The mean time between vaccination and evaluation was significantly greater in nonobstructive FIC cats (17.1615.4.1 months) or obstructive FIC cats (21.5618.5 months) than in asymptomatic cats (8.967.1 months; P, 0.004). Access to outdoors was similar in cats with nonobstructive or obstructive FIC and asymptomatic cats; however, a significantly greater number of asymptomatic cats came from multiple cat homes (P.0.01). The lifestyle of URTD cats was largely unknown. FCV was detected in urine from 3 (6%) nonobstructive FIC cats, 1 (5%) obstructive FIC cat, and 4 (7%) URTD cats; FCV was not detected in urine from any asymptomatic cat. In 4 cats, FCV was detected in urine, but not in oropharyngeal secretions. FCV was detected significantly more frequently in oropharyngeal secretions from cats with URTD (45% positive; P,0.003) compared to cats with nonobstructive FIC (11% positive), obstructive FIC (9% positive) or asymptomatic cats (9% positive). None of the FCV RT-PCR positive cats had been vaccinated within 90 days of sampling. Geometric mean VN antibody titers for cats with nonobstructive FIC, obstructive FIC, and URTD were 1:97, 1:198, and 1:170 respectively and were significantly higher than the mean titer of asymptomatic control cats (1:15; P,0.001). Our results confirm urinary shedding of FCV in cats with and without respiratory signs and suggest increased exposure to FCV in cats with FIC compared to asymptomatic controls. Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a well-recognized cause of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in cats. It has also been implicated as a cause of feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical, microbiologic, serologic, histopathologic, immuno-histopathologic, and molecular biologic findings of cats exposed to a urinary (FCV-U1) or respiratory (FCV-R) strain of FCV. Three groups of specific-pathogen-free cats were inoculated oronasally with 1310 5 TCID 50 of FCV-U1 (n516) or FCV-R (n516), or a non-infected control inoculum (n59). Clinical signs, urinalyses, oral and urinary viral shedding, and virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies were monitored serially for 42 days. Complete necropsies were performed on 10 FCV-U1 cats, 10 FCR-R cats, and 5 control cats. Twentyeight tissue specimens were collected from the oropharynx and the respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts from each cat. Total RNA was isolated from all oral secretion, urine, serum, and tissues samples and evaluated with a previously validated FCV p30 gene-based realtime RT-PCR assay. All tissues were evaluated by light microscopy after staining with hematoxylin and eosin, and after immunohistochemical staining for FCV antigen using an anti-FCV monoclonal antibody. Serum VN antibody titers were determined by a modified microtiter assay. FCV-R induced significantly more severe URTD signs than FCV-U1 (p,0.03); only mild dehydration was observed in control cats. The frequency of hematuria and pollakiuria observed in all three groups was similar. Oral viral shedding was detected by RT-PCR in 100% of FCV-U1 and FCV-R infected cats, whereas urine viral shedding was detected in 13% of FCV-U1 and 25% of FCV-R infected cats. Both FCV strains induced high VN antibody titers.",

Our results confirm localization of FCV in upper and lower urinary tract tissues in FCV infected cats. Both FCV-U1 (urinary strain) and FCV-R (respiratory strain) induce a similar spectrum of clinical and pathologic findings, but vary in the frequency and severity of specific signs and lesions. The prevalence of UTIs in cats presenting with only lower urinary tract signs (LUTS), regardless of etiology, is reported to be low. Risk factors for UTIs in cats have not been well established, but may include disorders that promote dilute urine such as chronic kidney disease ( CKD), hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus (DM). Medical records from cats presenting to UC Davis VMTH between 1995-2002 with these disorders that had urine cultures submitted were reviewed. Cats were eliminated if a concurrent disease was diagnosed, recent use of antimicrobial therapy, or urinary catheterization was performed within two weeks of urine collection. Multivariate models were created for each variable of interest while controlling for the confounding effect of disease group. Prevalence odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression. Six hundred fifteen cats met the inclusion criteria. Urine culture was positive in 5/103 (4.9%) with LUTS, 58/344 (16.9%) with CKD, 16/121 (13.2%) with DM, and 10/46 with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism (21.7%). Decreasing urine specific gravity was not associated with a risk of positive urine culture outcome (p50.344 , OR50.94). The presence of pyuria, bacteriuria, and hematuria were all significantly associated with positive urine culture results, irrespective of disease status. Persian cats, female cats, increasing age, and decreasing body weight were also associated with increased risk of UTI (p,0.05). Although E. Coli was the most common isolate from cats, that isolate was not identified from cats with only LUTS. Further studies are warranted to investigate host abnormalities in cats that have UTIs. The intestinal microflora plays an important role in gastrointestinal health. It has previously been reported that, in contrast to the canine intestinal microflora, the feline intestinal microflora harbors predominantly anaerobic bacterial species. These studies were based on direct culture of intestinal content to identify bacterial species. Additionally, only samples obtained from the proximal portion of the small intestine or the colon had been analyzed. Recently, it has been shown that standard culture techniques are less sensitive for the detection of some, especially anaerobic, bacterial species when compared to molecular techniques. Therefore, previous studies using standard culture techniques may have underestimated the overall bacterial diversity present in the intestinal tract of cats. The aim of this study was to describe the microflora along the intestinal tract in healthy cats based on direct sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA).",

As in humans, cCP is a heterodimer with two subunits, S100A8 and S100A9. Calprotectin (CP) belongs to a group of calcium-binding proteins that exhibit antimicrobial properties. Calprotectin is abundant in neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages. In humans, the concentration of calprotectin in serum, urine, and fecal samples has been shown to be clinically useful as a marker of disease activity for diseases associated with increased neutrophil activity, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Currently, there is no inflammatory marker available that is both sensitive and specific for monitoring canine patients with IBD. An immunoassay for the measurement of CP is currently only available for human patients, and immunoassays for proteins such as CP are usually species-specific. The objective of this study was to develop and analytically validate a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the quantification of serum canine calprotectin (cCP) as a potential marker for inflammatory disease activity in dogs.",

Disturbances, especially a reduction, in bacterial diversity in the intestine have been associated with the development of acute as well as chronic enteropathies in humans.

Lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis (LPE) is the most common histopathological finding in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

The aim of this study is to examine the immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin and a-catenin in canine intestinal specimens diagnosed with LPE and to compare these results with in terms of intestinal permeability and with respect to other clinical findings.",

Colonic vascular ectasia is described as nests of dilated, tortuous, thinwalled arteries, veins, and capillaries located in the submucosa and mucosa of the colon. These vascular abnormalities are not visible from the serosal surface of the colon, requiring colonoscopy for diagnosis. While colonic vascular malformations are one of the most common causes of gastrointestinal tract bleeding in human patients greater than 65 years of age, this disease is rarely diagnosed in veterinary medicine. Of the three cases reported in the veterinary literature, surgery was elected to control bleeding. This contrasts with the human literature where conservative management utilizing hormone therapy and endoscopic-guided laser coagulation is preferred.

The presenting complaints were hematchezia and severe, chronic microcytic anemia. The dogs required transfusions for their profound blood loss; one dog required multiple transfusions. Diagnosis was made by direct visualization of the vascular malformations with colonoscopy. These lesions were distributed diffusely throughout the colon. Subtotal colectomy was offered initially as treatment. Each owner elected to attempt medical management instead of surgery due to the complications and the level of morbidity associated with the surgical procedure. Laser therapy was not an option due to the large number of lesions present in each dog. The dogs were managed with combination estrogen-progesterone therapy. In the first case, diethystilbestrol (0.27 mg/kg, PO, twice weekly) and altrenogest (0.09 mg/ kg, PO, once daily) were used. Clinical signs were well controlled and the hematocrit stabilized. This dog, who had required more than four transfusions prior to treatment, required no additional transfusions over the next nine months after initiating therapy. This dog subsequently died from unrelated causes. In the second case, a preparation of ethinyl estradiol (35 mg) and norethindrone (0.4 mg) orally once daily was used. This dog has continued to do well with no episodes of significant bleeding and no further transfusions in ten months. Neither dog had any side effects secondary to hormonal therapy. In both cases, hormone therapy led to resolution of acute clinical signs, maintenance of a stable hematocrit, and prevention of further transfusions. We propose that hormone therapy is a safe and effective treatment option for colonic vascular ectasia in dogs. Hepatopathy is common in cocker spaniels, but no report details the pathophysiology. We evaluated the pathophysiology of the hepatopathy in seven American cocker spaniels with ascites examined at Nihon University between October 2001 and April 2006. The dogs averaged 5.8 years old (range 2-7 years), and included four males (three castrated) and three females (one spayed). Four dogs were anorectic and one developed subcutaneous edema.

On laparoscopy, the liver was stiff and atrophied, and appeared irregular. No typical regenerative nodes were recognized in any dog. Splenoportography showed acquired multiple portacaval shunts in all dogs, and the splenic pulp pressure was high in six dogs. Liver biopsies revealed hepatitis, liver fibrosis and lymphocytosis, with plasmacytes and fibroblasts infiltrating between Glisson's capsule domain and hepatic cells in all dogs. These pathological findings were similar to the lobular dissecting hepatitis seen in standard poodles. The main treatment was steroids. Overall, the clinical symptoms and blood tests improved in six dogs, of which four are still alive. Since the pathophysiological findings differ from those reported by Hardy et al. (1993) , some of American cocker spaniels may develop a different type of hepatopathy. Noninvasive assessment of intestinal permeability in vivo has traditionally been based on measurement of the urinary excretion of orally administered inert sugar probes. Commonly used probes are lactulose (L), rhamnose (R), xylose (X), 3-O-methylglucose (M), and sucrose (S). Ratios of these sugar concentrations in urine are used for the evaluation of gastrointestinal permeability and mucosal absorptive capacity in dogs. Measurement of urinary sugar excretion typically requires a 5-6 hour urine collection, which can be affected by incomplete urine collection. Development of an accurate method for the measurement of these sugars in serum samples would facilitate permeability and absorptive function testing under clinical conditions. The goal of this study was to validate a gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of L, R, X, M, and S in serum samples from dogs.",

Immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD) has been reported in German Shepherd Dogs (GSD), and an increased risk for the development of chronic gastrointestinal disease has been associated with IgAD in this breed. This IgAD in GSD is thought to be caused by an impaired function of IgA secreting plasma cells. The Q8MJZ1_CANFA gene on canine chromosome 7 encodes the production of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor containing the secretory component and is located in close proximity (0.28 mega bases (Mb)) to the canine microsatellite marker FH2226. The gene encoding the immunoglobulin J-chain (IGJ) is located on chromosome 13 in dogs. The canine microsatellite marker FH3800 resides at a distance of about 0.4 Mb from that gene. Currently, only one (variant C) of four allelic variants (A-D) of the gene encoding the IgA heavy chain (IGHA) in dogs has been identified in GSD (JIM 2005; 304:60-7) . The objective of this study was to investigate whether certain alleles of FH2226 and FH3800 are associated with IgAD in GSD and to analyze whether certain allelic variants of the canine IGHA gene are linked with IgAD in GSD.",

Identifying further functional elements of this response (eg, phagocytosis of non-opsonized particles, intracellular bacterial killing) may elucidate potential targets for pharmacological intervention in these critically-ill patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the serum titers of antibodies to canine distemper (CDV), canine adenovirus type II (CAV-2), and canine parvovirus (CPV) in trained Alaskan sled dogs before and after the 2006 Iditarod Trail Race. Blood samples were collected from all dogs within one month of the race start. As part of race rules, the dogs were certified as having been vaccinated against these diseases within the previous year, but the type of vaccine and frequency was not recorded. After the race, blood was collected from a convenience sample of 195 dogs and retrospectively matched with each dog's pre-race sample. Serum titers were determined using serum neutralization assays. Geometric mean titers (GMT) for CDV were significantly higher after racing (82 [11 to 362, 5% to 95% range] and 166 [32-1024], respectively, p50.001). GMT for CPV were also significantly higher after racing (2495 [321-16384] and 6323 , respectively, p50.013). Fifty eight dogs had increases in CPV titer $ 4 fold. In contrast, GMT for CAV-2 decreased significantly during racing (223 [39-1448] and 194 [23-1448] , respectively, p5 0.009). The titers to CDV, CPV, and CAV before racing varied significantly by team (p#0.013) Twenty seven dogs had CDV titers , 1:32, and 3 dogs had CPV titers , 1:80 before racing. Increases in CDV and CPV titer during racing might have been a result of exposure of dogs to these agents immediately before or during racing. No disease attributable to these agents was detected and the clinical significance of these changes in titer is uncertain. Research findings have implicated aberrant immune responses to the resident microflora in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical studies in animals and humans suggest that treatment with metronidazole (MTZ), tylosin, or select nutraceuticals decrease IBD activity, possibly due to their immunomodulatory effects. We explored the actions of MTZ, tylosin, conjugated-linoleic acid (CLA), and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on in vitro proliferation of mitogen-stimulated canine lymphocytes.",

There were 208 one year old dogs, participating in this study, representing 34 breeds. The mean % body fat of this group was 24.667.2%. Gender differences among the 1 year old dogs were also observed. Males (n5110) had 22.866.6% body fat while females (n598) were 26.667.4% body fat. This difference was significantly higher in female compared to male dogs. There are some reports that indicate that a dog with more than 1.15 times more body weight than that dog's body weight at 1 year of age is obese. We have observed in dogs that %body fat in the case was 1.3-1.4 times of %body fat in the 1 year old. Taking the information into consideration, their result showed that male dogs which had more than 31% body fat and female dogs which had more than 36% body fat were categorized as obese. In our study, 33.4% male dogs had .531% body fat and 25.9% female had .536% body fat. Many different colloid products are used for intravenous therapy in veterinary practice. The main indication for colloid therapy is to raise plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP). COP is reduced in a variety of conditions in which hypoproteinaemia is present. Plasma COP is one of the main forces that modulates fluid fluxes between different fluid compartments. It therefore plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of peripheral oedema. There are three main classes of colloids; those based on starches, gelatins and dextrans. The extent to which different colloids can influence a patient's COP is poorly understood. However, one factor is the inherent COP of the different solutions. The purpose of this study is to measure the COP of the synthetic colloids available in practice via membrane colloid osmometry (Wescor 4420 Colloid Osmometer2; Wescor Inc, Logan, Utah).",

            "text": "Dietary diacylglycerols (DAG) are naturally occurring components of edible oils. Human and rodent studies have found beneficial effects of DAG on long term lipid response, obesity prevention, and post-prandial (p-p) lipemia compared with triacylglycerols (TAG). We have previously shown in non-obese Beagles fed a single meal containing dietary vegetable oils enriched in DAG and high or low glycemic index starch (HGI/LGI) significantly decreased p-p plasma triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations. Therefore, we hypothesized that feeding DAG to obese dogs over a longer period during weight loss would modify aspects of lipid metabolism while providing healthy weight loss. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the long term effect of DAG plus HGI/LGI diets. Four diets containing 24.8%ME protein, 39.6%ME fat and 35.6%ME NFE were prepared containing oil and starch combinations and fed to obese Beagles for 8 weeks: HGI/TAG (HT diet), HGI/DAG (HD diet), LGI/TAG (LT diet), and LGI/DAG (LD diet). Poultry by-product meal was the protein source. Twelve obese intact female adult Beagles with body condition scores of 8.460.1 (SEM)/9 and % body fat of 48.963.3 (SEM) were used (n53 per group). The p-p studies, conducted during wk 1 and 8, used boiled chicken breast meat instead of poultry by-product meal. The p-p blood samples were taken via jugular catheters at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. During these same weeks, fasting post-heparin plasma samples were collected 10 min after intravenous injection of 100 I.U. Na heparin/kg-body wt into the opposite cephalic vein and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities determined using a radiolabeled substrate. At wk 1, 4 and 8, food was withheld overnight and fasting blood samples were collected. During wk 3, feces from all dogs were collected for analysis. Water was offered ad libitum and weekly body weights, daily kcal and diet consumed were recorded. Paired t-tests and one-way ANOVA with LSD comparison (a50.05) where appropriate were conducted for data analysis. Both starch and oil effects were found. Although all dogs lost body weight, dogs fed the LGI diets lost a higher % body weight than the HGI group overall (2% vs 1%). The LGI diets had a 12% lower metabolizable energy than the HGI diets. Total cholesterol of plasma and all lipoprotein fractions were significantly higher in the HT group at wk 4 and, tended to be higher with the HD diet but were more variable. No differences were found in fasting plasma TG, LPL and HL activities. However, p-p TG elevations were seen with the LT diet at both wk 1 and 8, with significance at wk 8. The bHB response at wk 8 was significantly increased with the LD diet. It is concluded that LGI containing diets enhanced weight loss vs HGI and, when in combination with DAG, suppressed p-p triglyceridemia and enhanced fatty acid oxidation without significant alteration of lipoprotein metabolism. Neutering increases the risk of obesity in dogs but effects of dietary factors are not fully understood. Resveratrol may alter this risk as it has mixed agonistic/antagonistic estrogenic effects and estradiol benzoate normalizes body weight in ovariectomized rats. L-carnitine may also alter this risk as it is required for energy production from fat. We have previously reported that dogs receiving dietary resveratrol supplementation had a greater body weight gain after neutering than those supplemented with L-carnitine. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the effects of resveratrol and L-carnitine on changes in body fat percentage and energetic efficiency of body weight gain. Thirty-five entire (18 male, 17 female) mixed-breed healthy young adult dogs were studied. A double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted on local shelter dogs prior to their adoption. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: resveratrol (60 mg/ day), L-carnitine (12 mg/day) and placebo. Dogs were neutered two weeks prior to commencing the 16 week study. They received a canine growth diet and supplements or placebo orally in capsules. Dogs were fed once daily and had free access to food for 14 hours overnight. Body fat and lean mass were assessed by DEXA (Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) scans before and after the 16 week feeding trial. The energetic efficiency of body weight gain was calculated by subtracting 2 3 Resting Energy Requirement, from the total energy intake, divided by body weight gained. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in % body fat at the time of neutering (p50.975). The mean % body fat at this time for resveratrol, L-carnitine and placebo were 11.2, 11.6 and 11.6 respectively. However, at the end of the feeding trial, supplement type was significantly associated with % body fat (p50.046) and in a pair-wise comparison, supplementation with resveratrol resulted in a significantly greater increase in % body fat than supplementation with L-carnitine (p50.015). The % mean body fat for resveratrol, Lcarnitine and placebo were 19.9, 15.5 and 18.4, respectively. There was no significant effect of diet on energetic efficiency of body weight gain (p50.45) and supplementation with resveratrol did not result in substantially higher energy requirements for tissue gain than did supplementation with Lcarnitine (mean for resveratrol less mean for L-carnitine 27911 kcal/kg body weight gain; 95% confidence interval of difference 221,558, 5308). We conclude that dietary supplementation with resveratrol after neutering results in greater body fat percentage than supplementation with L-carnitine in healthy young adult dogs and we infer that the greater body weight gain seen in resveratrol supplemented dogs is mainly due to deposition of larger amounts of body fat unassociated with a substantial increase in energetic requirements for body weight gain. Large breed dogs are known to have poorer fecal quality and higher fecal moisture than small breed dogs when given the same diet. Previous work in our laboratory indicated that this difference would be due, at least in part, to a higher fermentative activity in the hindgut. High protein diets increase delivery of protein to the colon and might have deleterious effects through generation of bioactive or toxic products. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect of protein level as well as protein source on fecal quality and key fermentation products in dogs differing in body size. 24 female dogs of 5 breeds (miniature poodle, Jack Russel, standard schnauzer, giant schnauzer and German shepherd) were included in the study. Two diets were tested in a cross-over design. The main protein source of diet A was poultry and poultry by-products (ME53750 kcal/kg, CP535.2%, fat516.0%, TDF57.7%) and the one of diet B was wheat gluten (ME53870 kcal/kg, CP519.9%, fat518.0%, TDF59.0%). Fecal scores and fecal dry matter (DM) were measured for each diet. Fresh stools were collected and analyzed for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), branchedchain fatty acids (BCFA), lactate, ammonia, phenols and indoles. Urine was collected and analyzed for indoles and phenols. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD post hoc test.",

            "text": "This study showed that a lower protein content in the diet ameliorates fecal quality. Large and small dogs although react in a different manner to this variation. Diets with higher protein concentration could be responsible for a higher quantity of undigested protein reaching the colon where protein fermentation could become significant enough to impact stool quality. A considerably higher concentration of protein fermentation products in the faeces would increase the quantity of water that would not be reabsorbed from the intestinal lumen. Dietary protein content and quality might thus be responsible for large dogs' predisposition to produce faeces of poorer quality. Hematocrit increases during exercise but then often decreases over time in dogs undertaking repetitive exercise. An increase in red cell fragility has been implicated. It has been suggested that this may be due to the action of lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase (LCAT) during exercise catalyzing the transfer of a fatty acyl group from lecithin to cholesterol to form lysolethicin and cholesterol ester in the membranes of red blood cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate this phenomenon in greyhounds racing over 500 m twice weekly. Eight trained greyhounds were fed either a high (43%ME) fat and medium (31%ME) fat diet for 8 weeks per diet in a randomized cross-over design. Dogs were fed a mixture of the two diets before the study and during a 4 week wash out period between diet treatments. Fatty acid profiles were the same in both diets. Blood parameters were measured before and 5 min after racing during the last week of each diet period and compared using a repeated measures ANOVA. No diet effects were seen so data were combined.",

Furthermore, in red cell membrane (ghosts), the PC/lysophosphtidyl choline (LPC) ratio within red blood cell membranes was lower in the post race samples (p ,0.001). This finding is consistent with the plasma PC decrease and the LCAT increase noted above. It suggests that red cell membrane PC may be a substrate during racing for LCAT and that as CE is formed and taken up by the liver, LPC accumulates in the red cell membrane. This accumulation may contribute to membrane disruption in vivo, red cell fragility and exercise-induced anemia. Nevertheless, plasma EC concentrations were lower at the post-race time point. This may reflect the possibility that reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) has occurred after LCAT lipid transfer either during or immediately after racing indicating rapid hepatic uptake of this lipid fraction (i.e. the cholesteryl ester).",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of dietary dl-alphalipoic acid on hepatic and immune function in aged adult beagle dogs as compared to young adult dogs. We postulated that old dogs may have decreased bromosulfophthalein (BSP) clearance, attributable to decreased intracellular glutathione concentration, and that supplementation of food with dl-alpha lipoic acid may improve clearance. Ten young (4-6 years of age) and 20 older beagles (9-14 years of age) were fed control food for 2 weeks. Baseline measures for BSP clearance, immune function and clinical chemistry were taken at the end of this period. Old dogs were randomly assigned to two groups to be fed either the control food (n510) or a test food (n510) containing 150 ppm of dl-alpha-lipoic acid on a dry matter basis for the subsequent 6 weeks at which time all baseline measures were repeated. Young dogs (n510) were also maintained on control food for another 6 weeks at which time all measures were repeated. The group of old dogs assigned to the lipoic acid containing food did indeed have significantly impaired BSP clearance compared to young dogs. Interestingly, the group of old dogs assigned to the control food was not impaired in BSP clearance as compared to the young dogs. The group of old dogs on the supplemented food also had impaired natural killer (NK) cell activity compared to the old and young control groups at baseline. Following 6 weeks of feeding the respective foods it was found that older dogs in the supplemented food group had BSP and NK cell activities that were significantly improved from baseline and no different from either the young or old controls. We conclude that inclusion of lipoic acid was not deleterious when administered to old dogs with impaired hepatic function and may contribute to improved BSP clearance and NK cell activity. In addition, improved BSP clearance and NK cell activity may result in better xenobiotic elimination and infection or cancer surveillance by the immune system of older dogs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dogs become hypothermic during general anaesthesia (GA) and whether this can be prevented using heat conservation methods. A randomised controlled clinical trial was used to compare two heat conservation methods in preventing hypothermia during GA for radiological examination. Dogs were selected for inclusion in the study from inpatients at the Animal Health Trust secondary referral centre admitted for an imaging work up that included radiography under GA. Dogs were assigned to treatment group using stratified randomisation according to body weight group and body condition score (BCS). Group 1 was the control group with no heat conservation, group 2 used a heat and moisture exchange (HME) device and group 3 HME, under blanket and circulating warm air blanket. Rectal temperature was monitored using a digital temperature probe and recorded every five minutes. The effect of treatment group and potential confounding variables (age, breed, coat type, body weight, BCS, length of anaesthesia, pre-medication, induction agent and depth of anaesthesia) on body temperature was assessed using linear regression.",

Method of heat conservation (P50.006) and ambient temperature (P50.04) were significant predictors of the change in body temperature during GA. After 35 minutes of anaesthesia, the body temperatures in the treatment groups diverged from the control group and active warming resulted in smaller decreases in body temperature. Body temperature continued to fall during recovery, regardless of treatment group. Fifteen percent of dogs had a temperature ,37.0uC during GA and this increased to 40% during recovery. The results of this study illustrate the importance of active warming in reducing hypothermia during GA. Toxoplasma gondii is transmitted mainly through the ingestion of oocysts excreted in the feces of infected cats or by meat from an intermediate host containing cysts. Free-living animals such as stray cats can be used as sentinels for the environmental spread of T. gondii in densely built urban areas because they are exposed to all the infective forms of the parasite without any protection. Ground-feeding animals such as outdoor living dogs would likely become infected by oocysts from soil contaminated with T. gondii. Canine and feline toxoplasmosis might be an important epidemiological indicator of the risk of toxoplasmosis to humans. This survey was carried out in the province of Kyunggi and Daejeon city. The 138 dogs (65 females and 73 males) examined were all German shepherd dogs from March 2006 to September 2006, which used for guarding or hunting. The 106 stray cats (61 females and 45 males) investigated were collected from March 2005 to October 2006. The dog samples were chosen randomly from those entering the veterinary clinics for a Dirofilaria immitis examination and/or annual vaccination. All the dogs and cats were asymptomatic, and had not received any prophylaxis and/or treatment for T. gondii. The ages of the dogs ranged from less than one year to more than seven years (mean 7.1 years old), and the ages of the stray cats are unknown. Nested PCR was performed using the previously described primers (Jones et al., 2000) , which were designed to detect the B1 gene of T. gondii. The statistical analysis of the prevalence between the age, genders and dogs and stray cats, was carried out using a chi-squared test (SPSS ver. 10.0, IL, USA). In the positive controls, two bands, 198 bp and 96 bp, were identified. In the first amplification, there was no positive result in all the samples from the dogs and cats. However, in the nested PCR, 64 (46.3%) out of 138 German shepherd dogs showed positive results. Female dogs showed a higher prevalence than male dogs, but there was no statistically significant difference. In ages, although ,3 group had a higher prevalence than .3 group, there was no significant difference in gender. In the 106 stray cats, 50 (47.2%) tested positive by the nested PCR assay. There was no significant difference between genders (females, 50.1% vs. males, 42.2%). The effect of age was not evaluated in due to the lack of data on the stray cats. The nucleotide partial sequence of the B1 gene of T. gondii from each of the 5 samples of 64 positive dogs and 5 samples from 50 positive cats was successfully determined. All the sequences were identical both to each other and to the corresponding sequence, the B1 gene of T. gondii (accession no. AF179871).",

The performance of routine diagnostic procedures (e.g., bone marrow aspiration, joint tap for articular fluid, fine-needle aspirate cytology, etc.) is an integral function of veterinary practitioners in clinical practice. Currently, experience with learning these technical skills is sporadic and insufficient for veterinary students to successfully master these procedures prior to graduation. There is an urgent need for a concise, readily-accessible, and well illustrated teaching resource that can be quickly and conveniently reviewed by students prior to performing diagnostic techniques. The aim of this project was to develop a novel, computer-aided instructional program for veterinary students which demonstrated performance of routine diagnostic procedures in dogs and cats. Key to the development of this interactive program were several criteria: 1) identification of an interdisciplinary team of faculty/staff which had expertise in veterinary clinical sciences, instructional development/outcome assessment, and computer graphics and technologies; 2) design of a cross-platform educational program which could be accessed at anytime in the clinics; and 3) provisions for student outcomes assessment using multiple parameter formats.",

Commonly reported signs of bleeding in dogs with von Willebrand Disease (vWD) include epistaxis, hematuria, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, prolonged estral bleeding, gingival bleeding at tooth eruption, hematomas, ecchymoses and excessive hemorrhage after surgery or trauma. However, vWD positive animals do present without a significant bleeding history, and the vWF:Ag concentration does not accurately reflect hemorrhagic tendencies. Availability of a method to predict risk of hemorrhage in dogs with vWD would be beneficial in patient management. In human medicine, bleeding questionnaires are most frequently used to aid in strategic diagnostic testing of vWD.

Using Spearman correlation, a statistical association was found between the questionnaire and the vWF:Ag ELISA (20.27, p50.0004), vWF:CBA (20.31, p,0.0001) and PFA-100 (0.32, p,0.0001). However, a corresponding pattern was not apparent in the raw data, and therefore this association did not have a clinically useful impact.",

Although the sensitivity was not ideal as a screening tool, the bleeding questionnaire did have some discriminatory power in the prediction of vWD status. The neurosteroids, alfaxalone and alfadolone, were first introduced into veterinary medicine as SaffanH in 1971 as an intravenous (IV) anaesthetic agent solubilised with CremophorH-EL. However, adverse effects in the dog and cat were attributed to the release of histamine associated with the excipient, CremophorH-EL. Alfaxalone has been reformulated as AlfaxanH (Jurox Pty Ltd, Australia) using only the alfaxalone active with the much safer excipient, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta cyclodextrin (HPCD). Sight-hounds are known to respond differently to some anesthetics than other dog breeds. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the comparative pharmacokinetics of alfaxalone when administered at the recommended clinical dose in Greyhounds with or without intramuscular premedication with 0.03 mg acepromazine/kg and 0.3 mg morphine/kg, twenty minutes before AlfaxanH administration.",

In addition, the volume of distribution of the central compartment (V c ) in premedicated Greyhounds was less than when un-premedicated, which may partially explain why premedicated dogs require less anaesthetic. The pharmacokinetics of alfaxalone in greyhounds and beagles are similar. Morphine is the prototypical opioid analgesic. Morphine is primarily eliminated in dogs by hepatic metabolism through formation of glucuronide conjugates. The pharmacokinetics of morphine have been described in dogs, but no reports of the disposition of morphine in Greyhounds are available. Previous studies have indicated Greyhounds metabolize some drugs (thiopental, propofol) , slower than other breeds. Thiopental and propofol are metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. The purpose of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and behavioral effects of morphine in Greyhounds.",

Since a direct comparison with another dog breed was not a part of the study protocol, it is difficult to assess whether Greyhounds truly eliminate morphine slower than other dog breeds. The clearance and half-life were rapid therefore it is unlikely a clinical difference would be noted in Greyhounds. The volume of distribution for morphine in Greyhounds was similar to previous reports in other dog breeds. Although morphine is a lipophilic drug and Greyhounds have a lower body fat content than other dog breeds, the volume of distribution was similar. This is probably due to morphine being a weak base, being ion trapped intracellularly in myocytes and due to Greyhounds having a larger muscle mass than other dog breeds. These data suggest the dose of morphine in Greyhounds should be similar to other dog breeds. A morphine sulfate dose suggested for future pharmacodynamic or efficacy studies in Greyhounds is 0.5 mg/kg IV q 2-3 h. Diminazene is drug that is commonly used in the treatment of canine babesiosis. Most of the pharmacokinetic work on diminazene has been undertaken in healthy individuals. The influence of disease on diminazene pharmacokinetics (PK) has been investigated to a limited degree. Population pharmacokinetics (PPK) allows for the investigation of factors (covariates) that influence PK parameters. The aim of this study was to provide a descriptive model of the PPK of intramuscular administered diminazene in naturally infected Babesia canis infected dogs. Thirty-nine dogs had 142 plasma samples collected. Another 56 samples from 8 healthy dogs, from a previous study, were added to data set. PPK was performed using WinNonMixH (Pharsight, Cary, NC). A one-compartment model was fitted to the data. Health status (presence or absence of babesiosis), pact cell volume (PCV) and serum albumin concentrations significantly influenced the PPK model. The PCV lost its significance when these covariates were modelled concurrently, due to its correlation to the health status. In the final model, the volume of distribution (health status and PCV) and K01 (health status) was significantly influenced by covariates. The final PK estimates (values are given as mean 6 standard deviation for normal distributed results and median (25%-75%) for non-normally distributed data) for healthy vs. babesia-infected animals were:",

Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in response to antimicrobial therapy is of great concern in antimicrobial therapy in both human and animal medicine. Resistance contributes to infection-related morbidity and mortality and limits alternative therapeutic choices. Antimicrobial-induced resistance is generally based on studies that associate drug use with increasing rates of resistance rather than measuring resistance in the individual patient. The purpose of this study was to associate routine use of popular antimcirobials with the advent of resistance in the animal, using fecal coliforms as sentinel organisms. Each of two dogs were treated orally with either a beta-lactam (amoxicillin; 10 mg/kg twice daily; G1), or fluorinated quinolone (enrofloxacin; 5 mg/kg once daily; G2) at the routine doses for 7 days); a third group received no treatment (control; G3). Animals had been drug free and maintained on a standard diet for at least 6 months prior to study. Fecal samples were collected prior to, and on days (D) 1, 3, 5, 7 of antimicrobial therapy, and days (P) 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 posttherapy. Total coliform counts, gram positive counts, percent Escherichia coli resistance to either drug, multi-drug resistance (MDR) based on antibiogram with 13 drug panels and MIC90 (EtestH) were determined. Resistance to all drugs was equal to or less than 25% at baseline. Percents coliform resistance (approximately 100%) to amoxicillin developed in both G1 and G2, but not G3, by day 3. Resistance to enrofloxacin also emerged by day 3 and was greater in G2 compared to G1 or G3. All G2 isolates resistant to enrofloxacin exhibited multidrug resistance (MRD); whereas only those isolates in G1 that were resistant to enrofloxacin exhibited MDR. In G1, amoxicillin resistance resolved by 21 days post-antimicrobial, whereas neither amoxicillin nor enrofloxacin resistance resolved in G2. MIC90 for resistant isolates exceeded the breakpoint MIC for either drug by at least 8 fold These data indicate that both antimicrobial therapies at the routine dose facilitated the emergence of high-level antimicrobial resistance to the drug in the majority of fecal coliforms, especially E. coli, by day 3 of therapy; that resistance to amoxicillin tends to resolve whereas and resistance to enrofloxacin persists for at least 3 weeks after the drug withdrawal; and that resistance to enrofloxacin tends to be associated with MDR. The results of this study suggest that efforts be made to limit the use of fluroquinolones and should resistance develop, it is likely to be persistant and associated with MDR. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) in horses previously has been associated with aortic root rupture, endocarditis, congestive heart failure, pheochromocytoma, myocardial toxins, renal disease, and exhaustive exercise.

Plasma cardiac troponin-I was .100 ng/ml (normal range 0.01-0.03 ng/ml). A 6 y.o. QH gelding was presented with severe acute hemorrhage after a laceration to the palmaromedial aspect of the distal right forelimb. A pregnant 6 y.o. QH broodmare was presented with a history of colic and fever and signs of acute hemolysis (brown mucous membranes, serum, and urine; severe anemia despite more normal plasma [Hb] ). In all horses, hematocrits (HCT) ranged between 11 and 15% upon presentation or after initial LRS fluid therapy. Whole blood transfusion to all horses increased HCT (18-25%) but tachycardia persisted despite amelioration of the anemia. ECGs revealed either single or multifocal VT. Lidocaine HCl (1.3 mg/kg IV over 15 mins followed by 50 mg/kg/min constant rate infusion (CRI)) resolved the tachycardia over 12-36 hrs in 2 of 3 horses. In 1 case where lidocaine therapy was not instituted immediately upon VT diagnosis, focal VT progressed to multifocal VT at which point lidocaine eventually proved curative. The horse with acute hemolysis died despite transfusion and lidocaine CRI, but gross and histological changes at necropsy did not document ischemic myocardial damage (normal hematoxylin basic fuchsin picric acid stain).",

It was concluded that VT should be considered as a differential in horses with persistent tachycardia after whole blood transfusion for treatment of acute anemia. ECG was diagnostic of VT and lidocaine CRI proved to be beneficial in 2 of 3 horses. Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, and recurrent laminitis. Metabolic syndrome in humans is associated with a proinflammatory state. We hypothesized that increased systemic inflammation in horses with EMS may predispose them to laminitis. We utilized flow cytometry to determine neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst activity, and real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to quantitate cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of horses with EMS (n510) and in control horses (n510). Resting insulin, body mass index (BMI), and mean neck circumference was measured in all horses. Horses with EMS had a mean BMI of 221 vs. 199 in the controls. Mean plasma insulin in horses with EMS was 124 microunits/ml, whereas horses in the control group had a mean insulin concentration of 16 microunits/ml. There was no statistical difference in mean cytokine expression between control and metabolic horses for IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or c-IFN. Neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst was determined by flow cytometry utilizing propidium iodide stained killed Staphylococcus aureus and Dihydrorhodamine 123. Oxidative burst activity (mean fluorescence) was significantly higher in metabolic horses (2832+/2 550 vs. 1989 +/2 660 in controls; p 5 0.006). Neutrophils in horses with EMS appear to be primed for increased oxidative burst activity which may predispose them to laminitis. It has been recognized that gastric emptying in horses is delayed in cases of colic, gastric ulcer, and postoperative ileus, to mention only a few. It is important to accelerate delayed gastric emptying. The prokinetics that have been clinically given to horses include bethanechol, neostigmine, metoclopramide, erythromycin, cisapride and lidocaine. However, prokinetics when clinically given to horses can have side effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Mosapride citrate (mosapride), a benzamide derivative and a selective agonist for the 5-HT 4 receptors, has recently been developed in the hope of improving upon the faults of other prokinetics. Mosapride is a drug with very little of the intracerebral dopamine D 2 receptor and produces little of the cardiac K + channel blockade actions observed in other prokinetics, and therefore there is little fear of side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms and ventricular arrhythmia with QT interval prolongation. Mosapride has been used in human clinical treatments. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prokinetic effects of orally administrated mosapride on horses with regard to the solid-phase gastric emptying rate. We also examined the issue of an adequate dose based on an evaluation of the prokinetic effect.",

In order to determine mortality rates and identify potential risk factors for mortality of horses treated for colic at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, we retrospectively examined the records of all colic cases admitted between January 2003 and June 2006. Parameters included age, sex, breed, treatment modality (medical vs. surgical), colic history, mucous membrane (mm) color, capillary refill time (CRT), red blood cell (RBC) count, packed cell volume (PCV) and heart rate (HR) upon arrival. The location (large intestinal vs. small intestinal) and severity of lesion (strangulating vs. non-strangulating) was recorded in horses that underwent surgery. Results of 208 cases (95%CI) reveal an overall mortality of 25% (19%-30%). Mortality of cases treated medically was 7% (1%-13%) and those treated surgically was 34% (26%-42%). Mortality in strangulating colic was 60% (46%-74%) and in nonstrangulating colic was 18% (9%-26%). Mortality in surgical cases involving small intestinal lesions was 63% (43%-82%) and in large intestinal lesions was 25% (17%-34%). Parameters found to be significantly associated with death by univariate analysis (x 2 for categorical data and Student t-test for continuous data) at p-values of ,0.005, were treatment modality, location of lesion, severity of lesion, mm color, CRT, RBC count, PCV and HR. Only CRT, HR and severity of lesion remained in a multivariate logistic regression model. Correlation between HR and CRT was low. Mortality was similar to reported rates as was HR upon arrival as a risk factor, but PCV, breed and age were not significant. Many aspects of the immune system of the horse develop during fetal life, yet foals are dependent on the transfer of maternally-derived antibodies during the neonatal period for protection against environmental pathogens. In addition, studies involving infectious organisms have indicated delayed production in certain immunoglobulin isotypes in the foal, which could increase their susceptibility to pathogens. One difficulty in determining the expression of immunoglobulin isotypes in the foal is the presence of circulating maternal antibodies. Therefore, the use of methods that reliably identify age-dependent limitations in the B cell development and response would provide a better understanding of disease mechanisms and means of prophylaxis.",

The low production of immunoglobulins during gestation does not confer protection at birth but indicates functional humoral response, which can be explored for prophylaxis. Due to increasing evidence that the same inflammatory pathways involved in organ failure in human sepsis play a prominent role in laminar failure in equine laminitis, we assessed the Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activation of Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway as a potential component (and therapeutic target) of laminar inflammation. We investigated the activation of STAT1, a transcription factor important in the induction of the innate immune response, and STAT3, better known for its involvement in anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling. Archived tissue samples from the black walnut extract (BWE) model were used from the following groups: control animals (n55), 2 developmental time points (1.5 h post-BWE administration [n55] and 3 hours [H] post BWE administration, [n55] and at the onset of lameness (n55). Western hybridization analysis was performed to determine levels of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (indicating activation) of STAT1 and STAT3. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was also performed to assess mRNA concentrations of target genes of STAT1 (interferon response factor-1 [IRF-1]) and STAT3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 [SOCS3]). Marked increases in serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 were present in laminar tissue at all stages of laminitis. Phospho-tyrosine 705 STAT3 concentrations were increased at the same time points; all anti-phosphotyrosine 701 STAT1antibodies used failed to recognize the equine epitope. However, at the 3H time point, a significant increase (15-fold, P50.0004) in laminar mRNA concentrations for IRF-1 (a target gene that requires both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1) indicates that STAT1 is most likely phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues. An increase in SOCS3 mRNA concentration (16-fold, P50.03) at the 3H time point is consistent with the increased level of STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. Interestingly, in two ''target organs'' of human sepsis that are not normally affected in the equine laminitis case, the lung and liver, there were much smaller increases in IRF-1 mRNA concentrations at the 3H time point (approx. 2-fold), whereas SOCS3 mRNA concentrations were still markedly increased (8-to 12-fold) in both tissues at the same time point. This suggests an imbalance in STAT signaling compared to the laminae, with the STAT signaling being more suggestive of an anti-inflammatory response in the lung and liver, consistent with the lack of clinical signs of disease (and recently reported decreased cytokine response compared to the laminae) in these organs in the equine patient with acute laminitis. These results suggest that JAK-STAT signaling may play an important role in the early stages of laminitis, and should be further explored for potential therapeutic targets to treat equine laminitis. Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is the major cause of viral abortion in mares and is associated with significant financial implications to breeding farms. The degree of viral shedding in horses residing on endemic farms in North America following either primary exposure or viral reactivation is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the possible biological source of infective EHV-1 virus in Thoroughbred horses residing on a breeding farm using real-time PCR and serology.",

Horses were in active training and had a mean age of 3.1 years (SD 6 2.1). Samples were tested for Salmonella spp. and C. difficile. A CDMN enrichment broth followed by alcohol shock and anaerobic culture was used for C. difficile isolation. Clostridium difficile colonies were identified by morphology, gram stain, smell and production of L-proline aminopeptidase. For presumptive Salmonella spp. identification, migration on MSRV agar was used after pre-enrichment of the sample. This was confirmed by subculture on MacConkey agar, biochemical characterization and slide agglutination. Serotyping was performed for final identification. Fecal examination for parasite eggs was performed on 252 of the samples using a saturated sucrose centrifugation technique.",

In order to determine if the high prevalence of C. difficile is due to specific racehorse management practices or to the use of an enrichment broth, further studies are required. The similarity in apparent prevalence of intestinal helminth infections in racetrack horses to that of the general horse population in Ontario is perhaps surprising and warrants further investigation. Arthritis is a chronic disease that cripples the lives of millions of horses each year around the world. This study was carried out to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of glycosylated undenatured type II collagen (UC-II) in arthritic horses. Horses received either placebo (Group I) or UC-II active at varying doses (20 mg, Group II; 40 mg, Group III; and 80 mg, Group IV) daily for 150 days. Capsules were administered orally everyday in a handful of grain. On a monthly basis, horses were given a physical exam and flexion test to observe for overall pain, pain upon limb manipulation, and pain from physical exertion. At the same time intervals, horses were checked for body weight, pulse rate, respiration rate, body temperature, in addition to serum chemistry for liver (ALP, GGT, and bilirubin), heart and renal (BUN and creatinine) functions. Horses receiving placebo showed no changes in arthritic condition, while those in Groups II and III showed moderate improvement. Horses receiving the highest dose of UC-II (80 mg/ day) showed the greater improvement. In this group of horses, UC-II reduced overall pain by 79%, pain upon limb manipulation by 71%, and pain after physical exertion by 68%. Overall, there was increase in mobility/ flexibility of joints and physical activity, because the pain associated with arthritis was significantly decreased. Throughout the study, body weight, temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate remained unchanged. Neither placebo nor UC-II caused any change in liver, heart or renal function markers, suggesting that UC-II is well tolerated by arthritic horses. It is concluded that UC-II (80 mg/day) ameliorates signs and symptoms of arthritis without producing any adverse events.",

The decrease at 15 minutes during GTT for IL-6 and TNF-a has not previously been reported; the increase in TNF-a has been reported in man. As previously reported in other species, glucose and increased body fat are associated with increases of circulating inflammatory cytokines in the horse. Multiple topical antimicrobial and anti-fungal medications as well as proteinase inhibitors are frequently administered to horses with infectious keratitis. A sub-palpebral lavage system is commonly used to allow frequent administration of medications. The medications mix within the catheter if air is not used to separate each drug; the latter procedure causes discomfort to the horse and is more labor intensive, but if not employed, drugs can be exposed to light and ambient temperatures whilst in the catheter, and drug interactions may occur which could decrease their efficacy. The purpose of this study was to assess the anti-microbial activity of different combinations of commonly used ophthalmic drugs at one and six hours after mixing and exposure to room temperature and ambient light. Combinations were selected from the following: tobramycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, neomycin-polymixin-bacitracin, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, serum and atropine. Aliquots of the mixtures were placed into pre-cut wells on agar plates and zones of inhibition measured after overnight incubation. The agar was inoculated with either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus spp to provide a constant concentration of each organism for all tests. There were no significant differences in zones of inhibition for drug mixtures at either time interval. Based on this study, mixing of drugs and exposure to light and room temperature for up to 6 hours did not adversely affect their antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp. Post-exercise hypotension (PEH) is being increasingly recognized in normotensive human athletes following cessation of strenuous endurance exercise. A transient period of PEH appears to be a physiological phenomenon in most athletes but can also cause dizziness and syncope. In fact, PEH is now recognized as a more important cause of collapse in people competing in marathons than dehydration. To investigate whether PEH occurs in endurance horses, indirect blood pressure was measured in 16 horses competing over 50 miles and 8 horses competing over 100 miles at the AERC National Championship Ride held in Virginia in October, 2006. On the afternoon prior to the ride start and within 60 minutes of successful completion, body mass (BM, load bar scale) was determined and heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures (Critikon Dinamap2 Veterinary Blood Pressure Monitor 8300 with a small adult cuff placed at the base of the tail) were measured in triplicate. Mean speed was 11.3 and 9.5 km/h and mean 6 S.D. BM loss was 4.2 6 1.6% (n513) and 6.5% 6 1.8% (n58) for the 50-mile and 100-mile horses, respectively. Pre-and postride heart rates and systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures are presented in the Table. Post-exercise hypotension was demonstrated in horses that successfully completed 50-miles but was not detected in horses that successfully completed 100 miles. However, power estimates of the paired t tests for the 100-mile blood pressure data were low (systolic 0.35, diastolic 0.05, and mean 0.05) due to the limited number of horses. In addition, 100-mile horses competed at a lower speed (exercise intensity), especially during the second half of the ride. In conclusion, PEH also occurs in equine endurance athletes but both the mechanism(s) involved and the potential role of PEH in development of medical problems in horses that fail to finish remains to be determined. Vitamin E is a proven antioxidant used routinely in equine veterinary medicine for treatment of neurologic and neuromuscular conditions. Horses have been previously shown to be capable of absorbing orally supplemented vitamin E based on measured increases in serum levels. However, levels of vitamin E in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of horses receiving vitamin E supplementation has yet to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if oral supplementation of vitamin E at two different dosages would lead to increased levels in serum and CSF in healthy horses.",

However, confirmation of the diagnosis is usually requires invasive measures. The prognosis after surgical removal of the cysts is fair, but relapses may occur. Studies on the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) have indicated the important role of subchondral bone. Adverse changes in bone due to trauma or disease are thought to promote degradative processes in cartilage. These processes are associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases, and aggrecanases. The cellular constituents of bone produce the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which regulates the synthesis of prostaglandin (PGE 2 ). As a key mediator of inflammation, PGE 2 also functions as a pain transmitter. Bone has nerve innervation and responds to pain stimuli. To clarify the cellular involvement of bone cell constituents in the pathogenesis of OA, we have evaluated the response of equine osteoblasts to inflammatory stimuli. We also determined whether avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU), glucosamine (Glu), and chondroitin sulfate (CS) modulate the expression of COX-2 and PGE 2 . Previous research indicates that these materials alone or in combination exert antiinflammatory activity and inhibit PGE 2 synthesis in chondrocytes and other cell types. Little is known about the effect of the combination of the three agents on osteoblasts. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the combination of ASU, Glu, and CS down-regulates COX-2 gene expression and inhibits synthesis of PGE 2 in equine osteoblasts.",

The combination of ASU, Glu, and CS significantly reduced expression of COX-2 back to levels similar to non-activated control levels. The significant downregulation of COX-2 gene expression corresponded with significant inhibition of PGE 2 synthesis in activated cells by as much as 60%. The present study demonstrates for the first time that the combination of ASU, Glu, and CS modulates the anti-inflammatory response in equine osteoblasts. The anti-inflammatory effect of the combination ASU, Glu, and CS product on bone cells may help provide pain relief and alleviate OA symptoms. The pathogenesis of endocrinopathic laminitis remains unclear with both glucotoxic and glucose deprivation hypotheses reported. The glucose deprivation hypothesis suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) causes impairment of glucose uptake into metabolically active tissue, such as the equine hoof lamellae. Glucose transport into cells by insulin is mediated by translocation of the insulin-dependent GLUT-4 from intracellular organelles to the cell membrane. The GLUT-1 isoform is expressed in many tissues, and contributes to basal glucose uptake independently of insulin, being localised mostly in the plasma membrane in the basal state. The purpose of this study was to measure the acute and chronic effects of insulin on glucose uptake in the equine hoof using a lamellar explant model, and to determine the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT) type 1 and 4 mRNA in equine lamellae via PCR analysis.",

Intrapulmonary blood accumulation causes small airway inflammation and may impair gaseous exchange. Bronchoconstriction may develop secondary to the bronchiolitis leading to increased pulmonary resistance and exacerbation of EIPH. We have recently demonstrated that racehorses have increased prevalence and severity of EIPH at sea level compared to high altitude. Intra-pulmonary proinflammatory cytokines may modulate pulmonary inflammation and enter the venous bloodstream. Our aim was to identify venous inflammation by measuring cytokine mRNA expression in racehorses with EIPH in South Africa, a racing jurisdiction that does not permit race day administration of furosemide, and in which horses race at both sea level and at high altitude.",

Typically MLTB is a slow growing tumor consisting of multiple contiguous lobules of cartilage and/or bone matrix surrounded by spindle cell mesenchyme. MLTB may be locally invasive or may metastasize. Responses to treatment and survival times of dogs with calvarial MLTB in the literature are variable.

Chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the oral mucosa and gingiva of Feline Immunodeficiency V\u00edrus (FIV)-infected cats are commonly seen in veterinary practice. The role of FIV in the aetiology of persistent stomatitis is still undetermined. Oral manifestations often found in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected people are frequently the first clinical signs of the infection and can be considered as indicators of the progression of the HIV infection. The HIV-infection is characterized by hypercortisolemia at all stages. It has been postulated that augmented serum and saliva glucocorticoid levels may play a role in impaired oral immunity and thus amplification of oral lesions.",

KE Schober, JD Bonagura, B Scansen, N Ponzio, J Stern. The Ohio State University, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Columbus, OH.Estimation of left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) is an important part of the hemodynamic evaluation of dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF). In the past, several conventional and tissue Doppler variables have been used to predict LVFP in dogs, however, validation studies are sparse. The objective of the study was to compare Doppler echocardiographic (DE) variables of LVFP with those simultaneously obtained via cardiac catheterization under a range of hemodynamic conditions. We hypothesized that DE would be useful in the prediction of LVFP.Seven healthy experimental dogs were anesthetized and instrumented to directly measure left atrial pressure (LAP), LV pressure, aortic pressure, right atrial pressure, and cardiac output.Echocardiographic variables of LVFP (ratio of early to late transmitral flow velocity [E:A], ratio of E to isovolumic relaxation time [E:IVRT], ratio of A to pulmonary venous atrial reversal flow duration [A duration:AR duration], ratio of E to mitral annulus tissue Doppler early diastolic velocity [E:Ea], ratio of E to early LV flow propagation velocity [E:Vp], and deceleration time of E [DT E ] were measured simultaneously over a range of 6 hemodynamic states induced by gradual volume loading. At all states, dogs were examined in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) followed by right atrial pacing at 150 bpm causing fusion of E and A. Correlation between invasive and noninvasive measures of LVFP was determined by univariate and multivariate regression analyses using pooled data.",

An estimated 50,000 animals may have been left behind when most of the human population was evacuated. Temporary mass shelters became operational in Louisiana and Mississippi within days of the disaster. In the following weeks, thousands of animals that were not reunited with their owners or adopted to new homes were sent to animal welfare groups throughout North America. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of infectious agents in animals that were transferred from the Gulf Coast disaster area.Rescue groups that received animals transferred from Louisiana and Mississippi were asked to submit EDTA whole blood and serum for testing. Samples from 414 dogs and 55 cats were submitted by 21 rescue groups in 13 states. Canine sera were tested for antibodies (AB) to B. burgdorferi, canine influenza virus (CIV), and West Nile virus (WNV) as well as Dirofilaria immitis antigen (AG). Feline sera were tested for AB to FIV and WNV as well as FeLV and D. immitis AG. DNA extracted from blood was assessed in PCR assays that amplify DNA of Ehrlichia/Anaplasma/Neorickettsia/ Wolbachia (Ehrlichia group), Bartonella spp., and hemoplasmas (only cat samples tested to date). Testing is not yet complete for all samples.In the dog samples tested to date, WNV AB (236/352; 67%) was most common, followed by D. immitis AG (202/411; 49%), Ehrlichia group DNA (28/175; 16%), B. burgdorferi AB (1/50; 2%), and CIV AB (2/394; 0.5%).

The objective of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that the combined use of FM and PBZ is more efficacious than a narcotic (NARC).Eight adult TB horses shod unilaterally with adjustable heart bar shoes were studied over a 2-week period. Non-weight bearing lameness was induced with tightening of the shoe. One hr later, horses received 1 of 2 treatments: PBZ (4.4 mg/kg IV) and FM (1.1 mg/kg IV), or meperidine HCl (1 mg/kg IM). Meperidine was administered IM to avoid the common excitatory side-effects of IV narcotic administration in horses. Responses (HR and lameness score (LS) determined blindly) were recorded at 20-min intervals for 1 hr prior to and another 12 hrs after drug administration. One week later, treatment assignments were reversed and the experiment was repeated. Data were analyzed using RMANOVA and Tukey's test post hoc with P,0.05 considered significant.HR and LS were lower in NARC trials from 2.3 through 3.6 hrs postadministration (P,0.05). In PBZ+FM trials, HR and LS were lower from 1 through 12 hrs (P,0.05) and were lower earlier and longer than NARC (P,0.05). It was concluded that the combination of PBZ+FM was considerably more effective in alleviating lameness than a narcotic universally-prohibited during competition. An association between calcium activated chloride channel 1 (CLCA1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), interleukin (IL)-13, interferon (IFN)-c and mucus hyperproduction has been reported in airways of patients with human asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as in animal models of these diseases. Therefore, we chose to analyse the expression of these genes in horses with inflammatory airway disease (IAD) and recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). Cells of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and epithelial brushings (BR) from 11 clinically healthy, 7 IAD-and 12 RAO-affected horses were analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, we compared mRNA levels of these genes in BALF and brushing samples from 7 of the 12 RAO-affected horses before and after allergen challenge.",

Furthermore, IL-13 expression decreased in RAO-affected horses after hay challenge (p 5 0.03). None of the other genes showed significant differences either between groups or after hay challenge of RAO horses. IAD-affected horses showed very similar, but less pronounced results.Since intratracheal mucus accumulation increased significantly (p 5 0.01) with disease severity, our results suggest that mucus production in equine IAD and RAO are induced by pathways that are independent of IL-13, CLCA1, EGFR, MUC5AC and Bcl-2 mRNA levels. West Nile virus (WNV) is a single stranded, enveloped RNA virus capable of causing encephalitic disease in horses. Unvaccinated horses are at risk for developing WNV disease in endemic geographic regions. Effective vaccination reduces disease frequency in horses and diminishes disease severity in vaccinated individuals that become infected with WNV. Recent data indicate CD4+ lymphocytes are required for effective protection against disease, in particular, cross talk between CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes must be functional. The objective of this project was to investigate immune responses in horses throughout a series of 3 vaccinations using a commercial inactivated vaccine.",

Conditioned media (CM) were harvested and frozen. Serum was obtained from cattle with confirmed: acute sepsis (peritonitis n54; septic myositis n51); chronic lung abscess (n51); chronic mastitis (n51), and sera from healthy animals (routine Johnes' surveillance). Concentrated PMN CM and serum proteins were subjected to affinity chromatography to purify Hp-MMP 9 complexes. Fractions containing MMP 9 monomer (105 kDa), dimer (210 kDa) and high molecular mass gelatinolytic complexes (.300 kDa-1000 kDa) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. High molecular mass gelatinolytic complexes upon reduction are converted to: MMP 9 monomer (105 kDa), b-Hp (38 kDa) and a-Hp (15-18 kDa). Peptide analysis of proteins confirm identity. These complexes retain the functional properties of each constituent protein (bind hemoglobin, protease activity).Hp-MMP 9 complexes are present in the sera of septic cattle, but not chronically ill or healthy animals. These complexes may prove useful as a marker of neutrophil activation and be indicative of sepsis. The purpose of this report is: 1) to define neutrophil accumulation after intra-bronchial LPS; 2) Characterize the effects of matrix metalloproteinase inhibition on LPS induced lung inflammation.Holstein bull calves (21-35 days of age), were fed milk re-placer and administered LPS intrabronchially (LPS; n 5 8) or an MMP inhibitor (n56) prior to intrabronchial LPS. The MMP inhibitor (HMR 1035; 15 mg/kg) was added to milk re-placer 12 h before LPS and immediately after recovery from anesthesia. The calves were anesthetized and a broncho-alveolar lavage catheter was placed, (location determined by radiography) and 2.34 mg M. hemolytica LPS/kg body weight in 20 mL of sterile saline was infused. The calves were re-anesthetized for BAL and euthanized for necropsy 24 h later. The trachea was cannulated for formalin fixation in situ (25 cm H 2 O). After fixation, lung tissue sections were acquired. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned for H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of MMP 9 expression.LPS infusion produced neutrophil influx, macrophage accumulation, hemorrhage and tissue injury. This was localized to the region served by the bronchus infused with LPS. Immunohistochemically, there was marked increases in MMP 9 within macrophages. Few PMN were positive for MMP 9 by IHC suggesting degranulation during the process of transmigration. Calves receiving the MMP inhibitor prior to LPS had minimal changes in their lungs in terms of tissue morphology and IHC. Matrix metalloproteinases appear to play a role in PMN transmigration and influx in LPS injured calf lung. Condensed tannins are secondary plant metabolites able reducing the burden of gastro-intestinal parasites in ruminants by direct anthelmintic effects or indirect effects inducing an enhanced immune response. Several studies have demonstrated that orally administrated Quebracho extracts reduce faecal egg counts (FEC) and total worm burden in experimentally infected sheep and goats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether orally administrated Quebracho extracts had anthelmintic effects in naturally infected grazing lambs.Thirty-six non-weaned French Texel lambs were investigated six weeks after start of the grazing period (T6). They were divided in three homogenous groups of similar body weight, FEC, gender and parity. Group 1 (n512) was treated at T6 and T10 with orally administrated moxidectin (0.2 mg/kg), group 2 (n512) was placebo-treated (50 ml of H2O) and group 3 was treated at T6 with a single dose of dissolved Quebraco extract (1 mg/ kg) and was treated at T10 with two doses of Quebraco extract (1 mg/kg) that were administrated 24 h apart. Body weight and faecal egg count were determined 6 (T6), 7 (T7), 10 (T10), 11 (T11) and 14 (T14) weeks after start of the grazing period. Parasitological analysis was performed using the McMaster technique in order to establish a FEC. Separate counts and scores were established for nematodes, Moniezia expansa and Eimeria spp. Data are shown as means 6 SE; statistical analysis was performed after logtransformation for variance stabilization.No differences of bodyweight were recorded between groups throughout the investigation period (T6: 9.360.8 kg versus T14: 28.661.7 kg, p,0.001). Eimeria spp infestation significantly decreased over time (T6: 3300069700 eggs/g feces versus T14: 7006270 eggs/g feces, p,0.001), treatment-related differences were not detected. Moniezia expansa infestation was non detectable at T6 and was maximal at T10 (4006200 eggs/g feces); treatment-related differences were not detected. Nematode infestation included Trichostrongylo\u00efdes, Chabertia, Nematodirus and Trichostrongylus. Given the low infestation, a collective count of nematodes was performed. Infestation remained stable in placebo-and Quebracho-treated groups throughout the investigation period (T6: 320696 eggs/g feces versus T14: 4206115 eggs/g feces, NS), whereas a significant decrease of FEC was recorded at T7, T10, T11 and T14 in moxidectin-treated lambs (T6: 4506116 eggs/g feces versus T7: 27619; T10: 90663; T11: 969; T14: 63639 eggs/g feces, p,0.01).This field study suggests that a single or double oral administration of Quebracho extracts at the dose of 1 mg/kg does not exert an anthelmintic effect in naturally infected grazing lambs. No adverse effects of tannin administration on bodyweight were noted and further studies could test whether other dose regimens or administration types are efficient under field conditions. Pepsinogen C (Pg C) is a minor proenzyme secreted primarily by the gastric mucosa. Under acidic conditions in the stomach, Pg C is activated to pepsin C, and participates in the digestion of dietary proteins. Like the major proenzyme, pepsinogen A (Pg A), Pg C can be found in the vascular space in measurable quantities. In humans, the ratio of serum concentrations of Pg A to Pg C is used as marker for specific gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis, duodenal ulceration, gastric cancer, and Helicobacter pylori infection. In pigs, gastric ulceration is a worldwide problem and minimally-invasive diagnosis of gastric lesions would be of great value as early diagnosis may allow early intervention and lead to improved longevity of affected pigs. The overall goal of this project was to develop immunoassays for porcine pepsinogens A and C and to evaluate the utility of the ratio of Pg A / Pg C for the diagnosis of gastric ulcers in pigs. We recently developed an immunoassay for porcine pepsinogen A. However, there is no commercial source for either purified porcine Pg C or antiporcine Pg C antibodies. Therefore, the present research was undertaken to develop a protocol for the purification of porcine pepsinogen C that would allow the purification of ample quantities of pure Pg C for the development of a radioimmunoassay for the quantification of porcine Pg C in blood.",
